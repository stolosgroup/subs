00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,448
(Police siren wails)

3
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,998
- Hi, hon!
- Hey.

4
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:38,917
Thank you.

5
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,794
- This is it then.
- Hmm.

6
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:43,463
- Nervous?
- A bit.

7
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:44,756
You'll be all right.

8
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:46,966
First in every
morning, last out.

9
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,426
How are my panda eyes?

10
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:52,222
They're fine. Bad night?

11
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:56,184
Er, no, this is actually me
after a good night's sleep.

12
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:01,606
I value each and every
member of my team

13
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,191
and I let head office know this.

14
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:06,403
But the new management have
pushed for a list of six of you

15
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,196
for the super team.

16
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:12,409
So, the names I've put
forward are Brodie...

17
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,952
- Jamie.
- (Man) Yes!

18
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:15,412
- Laura.
- (Woman) Brilliant!

19
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,038
- Andy.
- Right!

20
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:18,498
- Daniel.
- Yeah!

21
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:19,624
And, er...

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,711
- Kirsty.
- Oh.

23
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:24,587
So congratulations to those six.

24
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,631
Let's have a few minutes
to digest everything

25
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:28,091
and then back to work.

26
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:31,845
I can't believe it.

27
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:33,972
- Not now.
- Yeah.

28
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:35,598
- No.
- Yeah, now.

29
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:39,602
(Woman) Kirsty? She hasn't
been here five minutes!

30
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,689
(Manager) I think you're very
competent and valued, Philippa.

31
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,983
But after careful
consideration, I have decided

32
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:47,360
that you are at the
right level for you.

33
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:49,529
Are you actually reading
from an hr manual?

34
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:51,239
No, no.

35
00:03:51,322 --> 00:03:53,742
Look, we both know
you've had issues.

36
00:03:54,993 --> 00:03:58,663
Me isn't skiving. I suffer
from chronic fatigue, Tony.

37
00:03:58,747 --> 00:04:00,081
It's a real illness.

38
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:01,916
And yet have I ever
missed a deadline?

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,960
I thought it was time
to give the younger ones

40
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,044
a chance to shine.

41
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:07,589
Well, if you want people who
are good at being under 40,

42
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:09,924
I will admit I am
struggling there.

43
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:12,135
But so are you.

44
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,763
Hair wax isn't fooling anyone.

45
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:16,556
It's Clay, actually.

46
00:04:25,106 --> 00:04:27,317
I can't face it.

47
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,154
What would improve
things for you?

48
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:34,365
A penis.

49
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:38,036
Well, you can have mine. It's
not very busy these days.

50
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:40,455
Trying to make me laugh
isn't helping much, John.

51
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,876
I just keep getting horrible
flashbacks to when I was ill.

52
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,504
Yeah, don't do anything
impetuous. That's all I ask.

53
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:51,257
We have two households to run
and we need your wages too.

54
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,717
(Philippa) Boys!

55
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:58,389
Wait a minute, are you
not eating with us too?

56
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:02,018
No. I'm, er, going out
for dinner with a woman.

57
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,436
Tomato sauce and salad.

58
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,271
Yes, I met her on
plenty of fish.

59
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,940
No, I don't know much about her.

60
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:08,483
John, please, can't
you rearrange?

61
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:11,152
I can't face having to
go to this play tonight.

62
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:13,071
Not on my own.
Boys, come on now!

63
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:15,156
Yes, I could, but
I'm not going to.

64
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,283
And one day, you'll
thank me for it.

65
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:21,329
Oh. You wearing that
jacket, are you?

66
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:22,956
Yes, I am.

67
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,793
Good luck, biggles.

68
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:31,965
- My guy's going down.
- My blues are terrible.

69
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:34,634
- (Philippa) Boys!
- Deploy my troops!

70
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,636
Dinner is served.

71
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,474
- Mum, what are you doing?
- Mum?

72
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,601
- What are you doing?
- You're not listening to me.

73
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:44,978
You're coming to the theatre.

74
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,563
You're going round
your grandma's.

75
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,190
Come on. Max, it's not me
that has to write that essay.

76
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:50,358
- Quicker.
- Crazy woman.

77
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:52,735
- Er, thank you! I wonder why.
- You're a crazy woman.

78
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,280
Don't copy your brother, raife.

79
00:05:56,197 --> 00:06:00,368
(Man) Now is the winter
of our discontent

80
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:04,497
made glorious summer
by this son of York.

81
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:08,543
And all the clouds that
lour'd upon our house

82
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:11,838
in the deep bosom
of the ocean buried.

83
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:17,051
But I, that am rudely stamp'd,

84
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,929
and want love's majesty,

85
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:23,892
I, that am curtail'd of
this fair proportion,

86
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,564
cheated of feature by
dissembling nature,

87
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:33,234
deformed, unfinish'd,

88
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:36,112
sent before my time into
this breathing world,

89
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,822
scarce half made up,

90
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:40,700
and that so lamely
and unfashionable

91
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:44,412
that dogs bark at me
as I halt by them,

92
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:47,790
why, I...

93
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:53,630
In this weak piping
time of peace...

94
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:58,217
Have no delight to
pass away the time,

95
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,139
unless to spy my
shadow in the sun

96
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,351
and descant on
mine own deformity.

97
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:12,065
Therefore, since I
cannot prove a lover,

98
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:16,778
I am determined to
prove a villain.

99
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:24,827
(Chatter)

100
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:27,705
Can we just stay here, please?

101
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,333
Look, I know it's tough when
you start a new school, Max,

102
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,251
but you've got to make
an effort, darling.

103
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:34,504
Just talk about the
play, yeah? Come on.

104
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:39,509
Hello. I'm Philippa, Max's mum.

105
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,969
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

106
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:42,720
- Alex, Lucy's father.
- How do you do?

107
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:44,389
- Hey.
- And this is my wife, Susan.

108
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:45,473
- Hello.
- Hi.

109
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:47,436
- (Philippa) Hi.
- We were just trying to tot up

110
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:49,435
how many more the wicked
bugger's got to murder

111
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,604
before he gets his sticky
mitts on the crown.

112
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:53,231
I actually felt
quite sorry for him.

113
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:55,608
- Because of his hump?
- Oh, no.

114
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:58,152
It was, erm, all that stuff
about him feeling so ugly,

115
00:07:58,236 --> 00:08:00,446
he couldn't look at
himself in the mirror.

116
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,865
Still, it's not real,
is it? It's just a play.

117
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,951
Yeah, but it's a
historical play.

118
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:08,037
Shakespeare was writing about
what was to him recent history.

119
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,455
Well, I just don't believe

120
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,791
someone would be that wicked
because of a disability.

121
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:13,501
Doesn't ring true to me.

122
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:16,212
And that's your critique
of Shakespeare, is it?

123
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,296
"Doesn't ring true"?

124
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,923
(Bell rings)

125
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:21,509
Well, see how you feel about him

126
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:23,219
after he murders his
two little nephews

127
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,430
in the second half. (Chuckles)

128
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:28,391
I wish the bastards dead

129
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:32,562
and I would have it
suddenly perform'd.

130
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:37,108
What sayest thou? Speak
suddenly, be brief.

131
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:39,610
Your grace may do your pleasure.

132
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:40,695
(Richard) Hmm.

133
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:43,948
(Buckingham) Be happy then,
for it is done, my lord.

134
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:45,950
(Snores)

135
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:51,831
I think there be six
richmonds in the field.

136
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:54,834
Five have I slain
today instead of him.

137
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,669
(Swords unsheathe)

138
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,380
A horse! A horse!

139
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:01,632
My kingdom for a horse!

140
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,676
(Groans)

141
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:18,649
God and your arms be
praised, victorious friends.

142
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,027
The day is ours.

143
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,821
The bloody dog is dead.

144
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,158
(Car horn)

145
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,328
(Susan) Sorry. Excuse
us. Come on, Lucy!

146
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,624
Mum, what are you doing? Mum!

147
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:39,754
Hello, Philippa.

148
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:43,091
Richard III died in 1485.

149
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:47,345
Shakespeare didn't write
his play until around 1593.

150
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:49,263
Sorry, I'm not following you.

151
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:51,891
You said Shakespeare was
writing about recent history.

152
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:54,268
He wasn't. He wrote it
over a hundred years

153
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:56,145
after Richard's death.

154
00:09:57,105 --> 00:09:58,106
All right.

155
00:09:58,189 --> 00:09:59,690
And they reckon he
probably made it up

156
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:01,109
that he was a hunchback.

157
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,778
But it's just a play, isn't it?

158
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:05,905
That's what I said.

159
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:10,910
Ok. Bye.

160
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:16,624
Max, come on.

161
00:10:18,793 --> 00:10:19,877
I just don't like it

162
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:22,213
when people put others
down for no reason.

163
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,092
So, your dad's got a
new girlfriend then?

164
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,302
(Max) Her name's Sarah
and she likes seafood,

165
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:30,263
so dad's taking her
to a fish restaurant.

166
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,223
(Philippa) He'll have the steak.

167
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,109
If it's a call,
introduce yourself.

168
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:45,528
If it's a man, I
talk about the footy.

169
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,447
But throughout all your
conversations, remember,

170
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:51,200
put on a happy face, and smile.

171
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,869
It's on the phone, Tony.

172
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:57,373
Well, your voice can
still have a smile in it.

173
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,292
"Hello. And how are you today?"

174
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,460
Thank you, Kirsty. Yes.

175
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:04,422
You don't have to see a smile
to know that it's there.

176
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:07,300
Very important.
Please, continue.

177
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:10,720
(Kirsty) If it's a new client,
say something to disarm them.

178
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,055
"Sorry, I've been a
bit hectic today."

179
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,099
Or if it's towards
the end of the week,

180
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:17,810
tell them about how much
you're looking forward to...

181
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,562
(Voice fades)

182
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,324
(Gasps)

183
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,508
(Kirsty) If they're
an existing client,

184
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:53,221
do make sure that you offer
them new opportunities

185
00:11:53,304 --> 00:11:55,848
or alternative
campaign strategies.

186
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,267
(Tony) That's good, but you
don't want to get trapped.

187
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,686
So, what you need is an...

188
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,357
Exit strategy.

189
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,128
(Sighs)

190
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:27,630
(Gasps)

191
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:56,158
(Engine runs)

192
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,160
- Come on. Quick, quick, quick.
- Morning, boys.

193
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,246
- Quick, quick, quicker.
- Quick as you like.

194
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:01,664
- Gym bag.
- (Max) Thank you.

195
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,916
Ok, mind your head.

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,335
Don't let the bastards
grind you down.

197
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,420
- Thanks.
- Bye, mum.

198
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:08,754
- Bye, mum.
- Bye.

199
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,331
Hi, erm, do you have any
books on Richard III?

200
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:46,375
- The king?
- I know who you mean.

201
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,047
Historical books, not
Shakespeare, please.

202
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,215
(Keyboard clicks)

203
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,718
We have eight titles.

204
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,596
Yes, please. I'll take them.

205
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,097
Which ones?

206
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,392
All of them.

207
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:33,381
(Man) Thank you.

208
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,020
(Philippa) Look, I...

209
00:15:30,104 --> 00:15:32,982
I know you're some sort
of apparition, so...

210
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,278
You can just go away
and leave me alone.

211
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:38,779
Please.

212
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:43,909
This is private property.

213
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:59,091
(Philippa) What is it
you're going to see?

214
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:02,011
- Skyfall. James Bond.
- Oh.

215
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,345
- Mum?
- Yes, darling?

216
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,473
Can you actually get
a licence to kill?

217
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:06,891
Max says you can.

218
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:09,393
You just get a form from the
post office and apply for it.

219
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:11,517
- Like a driving licence.
- You can't, can you, mum?

220
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:13,522
- No, he's being daft.
- They only cost 15 quid.

221
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,607
Max!

222
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,275
(John) You sure you
don't wanna come?

223
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:18,110
No. I'm gonna put my feet up.

224
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:20,279
Enjoy the film.

225
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,823
- See you later.
- Bye, mum.

226
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:24,366
Bye, boys.

227
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:04,907
(Woman) They love to paint
him as some kind of monster,

228
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,368
devoid of compassion and pity.

229
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,121
But I read a
contemporary article

230
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:13,207
from the croyland
chronicle the other day...

231
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,583
Ah, the croyland.

232
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:18,087
That noted and oft-quoted
medieval organ.

233
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,007
(Woman) ...About when king
Richard lost his only son.

234
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,096
"On hearing the news of
his death at Nottingham,

235
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,973
where they were then residing,

236
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:31,642
you might have seen
his father and mother

237
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:34,979
in a state almost
bordering on madness

238
00:17:35,062 --> 00:17:37,648
by reason of their
sudden grief."

239
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,068
And then, a few months later,

240
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:43,487
his own wife dies
of tuberculosis.

241
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:46,740
Poor man. Must've
been heartbroken.

242
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:49,034
Doesn't sound much like
Shakespeare's villain.

243
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:51,912
Thank you. And this is just
the circumstantial stuff.

244
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:54,039
We have facts. We
have hard evidence

245
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:55,416
to refute every accusation

246
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:57,418
that Richard's detractors
would put to us.

247
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:58,752
If we ever get the opportunity.

248
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:00,671
Exactly! But we're
shouting into the void

249
00:18:00,754 --> 00:18:03,048
- and nobody's listening.
- (Man) Oh, shut up.

250
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:04,466
Thank you.

251
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:09,179
Because Shakespeare's play is
more attractive than the truth.

252
00:18:09,263 --> 00:18:11,223
I'm sorry, my name's Philippa.

253
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,225
You must be the
Richard III society.

254
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,351
(Man) Correct!

255
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:17,479
Brackets, Edinburgh
branch, close brackets.

256
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,608
At your... disposal.

257
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:22,026
(Chuckles)

258
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,738
(Dramatic music, gunfire)

259
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:28,949
(Helicopter rotors whir)

260
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:36,832
There's so many people who seem
to take such a dim view of him.

261
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,459
They do indeed.

262
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,336
Well, they can't all
be wrong, can they?

263
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,713
(Man) Have you ever heard
gossip about yourself

264
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:44,965
and thought, "how can
they say that about me

265
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,508
when they don't even know me?"

266
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,802
(Woman) Most of what is
written about king Richard

267
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:50,596
is based on tudor history

268
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,516
because Henry vii won
the battle of bosworth.

269
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,685
(Man) If you get in
quick with the first lie,

270
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,271
and repeat it often enough,
then it becomes the truth.

271
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:01,440
And Richard wasn't around
to defend himself, was he?

272
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,027
I'd like to join your society.

273
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,780
Oh, hail fellow well met!

274
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,698
You must commune
with us, Philippa.

275
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:13,535
I'm about to procure a round of
hook Norton's old hooky ales.

276
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,872
Oh, thanks. I'll just have
a ginger beer, please.

277
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,167
(Man) "If you can bear to
hear the truth you've spoken

278
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,213
twisted by knaves to
make a trap for fools,

279
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:28,133
or watch the things you
gave your life to, broken,

280
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:31,428
and stoop and build them up

281
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:33,430
with worn-out tools."

282
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:39,603
I'll get the drinks in.

283
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:42,648
Six pints of old hooky ale,

284
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:44,608
and a ginger beer, please.

285
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:48,320
He's very eloquent. Does
he work in a theatre?

286
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,072
No. Carphone warehouse.

287
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,658
Just till he gets back
on his feet again.

288
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,411
You sure you want
to join this group?

289
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,247
You look quite normal.

290
00:20:00,374 --> 00:20:01,792
I'm not.

291
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:07,131
So, why are you all
interested in Richard III?

292
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:09,133
Everyone has their own
reasons, I suppose.

293
00:20:09,216 --> 00:20:12,344
But the one thing that
binds us ricardians

294
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:15,931
is that we stand united
against lies and falsehoods,

295
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:19,351
whether they be peddled
on tudor printing presses

296
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:20,644
or on Twitter.

297
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:25,524
- What about you?
- Oh. Not quite sure.

298
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:29,153
I'd quite like to pay
my respects, though.

299
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:31,196
You know, maybe visit
his grave one day.

300
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,074
Oh, you'll have a
job. There isn't one.

301
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:36,160
Depending on who you talk to,

302
00:20:36,243 --> 00:20:38,370
he was either thrown
into the river soar

303
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:41,331
or his mortal remains
are lost to history.

304
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,884
(Engine revs)

305
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,274
- (Max) Hi, mum.
- Hey. How was it?

306
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:08,817
- (Max) Really good.
- Yeah?

307
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,445
- (Max) M dies at the end.
- Oh, great.

308
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:13,530
- Forty people were killed.
- (Philippa) Yeah?

309
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:14,948
But James Bond only killed

310
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:16,950
- 17 people.
- Right.

311
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:21,580
Which means 23 of them were
killed by unlicensed people.

312
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:24,666
Oh. Oh, dear. Er, don't
get too comfortable.

313
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,961
It's a school night. Remember?
Go on, I'll be up in a minute.

314
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:29,129
Goodnight.

315
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:32,508
- Night, Max.
- (Max) Goodnight.

316
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:34,927
Did you manage to relax?

317
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,513
Yeah, it was nice
and quiet, really.

318
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,724
You went out?

319
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:43,268
Yeah, just to the corner shop.

320
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:45,437
For... tomatoes.

321
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,107
Right. I'm away home.

322
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:50,609
- (Philippa) Goodnight.
- Night.

323
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:20,931
Mum, you look like a panda.

324
00:22:21,014 --> 00:22:23,141
Oh, thanks, darling.

325
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,435
Don't go to work today, mum.

326
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,145
Stay at home until
you feel better.

327
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:29,523
Thanks, sweetheart.
Think I will.

328
00:22:29,606 --> 00:22:31,149
Look after your
brother, all right?

329
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:58,051
(Philippa) I have a condition...

330
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:02,806
Which I have to manage.

331
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:09,187
It's called me and, erm...

332
00:23:10,314 --> 00:23:12,858
It flares up when I'm stressed.

333
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:19,489
It's funny, people find out
this one thing about you

334
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:21,325
and that's all they can see.

335
00:23:26,663 --> 00:23:28,457
But there's more
to me than that.

336
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:39,760
I've been trying to work
out why you're here.

337
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:43,305
I'm wondering if it's
because you're lost.

338
00:23:49,102 --> 00:23:51,271
- (Philippa) Hi.
- (Both) Hi.

339
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:54,983
We think you might be having
some sort of breakdown.

340
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,653
We think you need
to talk to someone.

341
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,614
Sorry, is this some
kind of intervention?

342
00:24:00,697 --> 00:24:02,866
No. You haven't
answered our calls,

343
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,410
you haven't answered our texts.
What have you been doing?

344
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:07,621
And you should know Tony's
saying that you left

345
00:24:07,704 --> 00:24:09,081
because of your health.

346
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:12,084
He says he's been covering up
the extent of your me for years.

347
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,378
How can he say that?
It's not even true.

348
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:17,172
But you're not there to defend
yourself though, are you?

349
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:23,637
Do you know the principle
"innocent until proven guilty"

350
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,223
was introduced 500 years ago?

351
00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:28,225
By Richard III, actually.

352
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,394
(Woman) No.

353
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:34,189
No, neither did I until
about two days ago.

354
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,732
Excuse me.

355
00:24:35,816 --> 00:24:37,317
Where are you going?

356
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:41,863
- Not back to work.
- What'll you do, Phil?

357
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,409
I don't know. Maybe,
erm... have an adventure?

358
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:59,089
(Philippa) Jessica,
nice to meet you.

359
00:24:59,172 --> 00:25:00,590
Pleased to meet
you too, Philippa.

360
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:02,592
Welcome to the king
Richard family.

361
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:06,596
You wrote to me about
greyfriars church and the king?

362
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,683
Yes, nobody now knows where
the church is located,

363
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:12,310
but you believe that's
where they buried Richard

364
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:13,687
after the battle of bosworth?

365
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,273
All the sources suggest
he could have been.

366
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:18,817
My guess is he'd
be under the choir.

367
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,694
It's the part of the
church where they buried

368
00:25:20,777 --> 00:25:22,988
- all the important people.
- Ah, ok.

369
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:25,323
Er, but, you know, you
really should have a word

370
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:26,450
with Graham naismith.

371
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:28,493
He's an amateur
historian I came across.

372
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:29,786
Lives over there in cornwall.

373
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,665
- (Raife) Mum!
- Yes, in here. Hey, love.

374
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:35,208
Did you stay at home all day?

375
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:36,877
No, I wasn't feeling very well.

376
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,421
- I'm feeling much better now.
- (Raife) What's for dinner?

377
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,215
Erm, I don't know. I haven't...
I'll do it in a minute.

378
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,968
Can we just order some pizza?
Max knows how to do it.

379
00:25:45,052 --> 00:25:47,679
Yes, ok. Take my
card, it's just there.

380
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:52,142
Don't tell your dad, ok?
Where is he, by the way?

381
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:53,852
Entertaining his female suitor.

382
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:55,687
Ah, makes sense.

383
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:58,815
I was talking to Jessica
in San Diego and she said

384
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:01,068
you were the man to speak
to about Richard's grave.

385
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:03,570
Ah, the holy grail.

386
00:26:03,653 --> 00:26:05,739
Well, if you're
interested in all that,

387
00:26:05,822 --> 00:26:07,157
I can send you a
link if you like.

388
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,910
Oh, Graham, that'd be...
That'd be fantastic, thank you.

389
00:26:09,993 --> 00:26:13,622
The key is to find
Robert herrick's garden.

390
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,665
- Whose?
- Robert herrick.

391
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:17,375
He was a former
mayor of Leicester

392
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:20,295
who supposedly built a shrine
in the grounds of his mansion

393
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:24,382
in the early 1600s to Mark the
spot where Richard was buried.

394
00:26:25,258 --> 00:26:28,136
Sorry, Graham, I can't
help noticing your hair.

395
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:32,766
It looks a lot
like Richard III's.

396
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:34,434
Is that deliberate?

397
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:36,853
Yes.

398
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:40,774
Robert herrick was mayor
of Leicester in 1593

399
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:43,151
and I think again in 1605.

400
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,779
There's a map somewhere
in the city archives

401
00:26:45,862 --> 00:26:47,823
which shows where
he built his mansion

402
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,407
and the layout of the grounds.

403
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:52,577
Graham this is all
so useful. Thank you.

404
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,665
I really like your hair
like that, by the way.

405
00:26:57,499 --> 00:27:00,919
It's like I've been sitting
here talking to Richard himself.

406
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:29,823
"naked of all clothing
and laid upon horseback

407
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:32,868
with the arms and legs
hanging down on both sides,

408
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,495
the body of king
Richard was brought

409
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:38,290
to the Abbey of monks
franciscans at Leicester."

410
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:40,959
"A miserable spectacle."

411
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:07,485
- Did the boys get off ok?
- (John) Er, yeah, fine, fine.

412
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:09,738
You know, I've got a
good feeling about today.

413
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,239
Do you?

414
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,658
Well, I mean, if Tony's
sending you on this course

415
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:16,703
then he obviously still
thinks highly of you.

416
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:19,039
Yeah, no, I wouldn't get
too excited, it's just...

417
00:28:19,122 --> 00:28:20,999
And you'll be back by 7:30?

418
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:23,210
I've got to be away by
then, 7:45 the latest.

419
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:25,879
Yeah, I know. Don't wanna keep
seafood Sarah waiting, do we?

420
00:28:25,962 --> 00:28:27,589
Pardon?

421
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,257
Ok, bye.

422
00:28:31,134 --> 00:28:32,677
As you've probably worked out,

423
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:36,473
I'm not going on a work
training day thing.

424
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:40,769
Going to Leicester,
for a lecture.

425
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,104
About you, actually.

426
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,191
In fact, today's all about you.

427
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:52,489
You're quite young,
aren't you? Thirty-two.

428
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:55,659
Same age as Alexander
the great when he died.

429
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,370
I'm...

430
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,248
Forty-five.

431
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,502
I've been told I could
easily pass for 37.

432
00:29:07,504 --> 00:29:10,090
Well, some days, I feel like 97.

433
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,470
I was reading that you were an
advocate for the printing press

434
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:19,307
at a time when it was considered
the work of the devil.

435
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,767
And those same machines

436
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,727
were used to print
lies about you.

437
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:26,439
Five hundred years of lies.

438
00:29:38,702 --> 00:29:40,704
Upon Edward iv's death,

439
00:29:40,787 --> 00:29:44,457
Richard put the king's
young sons, his own nephews,

440
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:45,875
in the tower of London.

441
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:48,253
Then he made his move.

442
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:50,588
First he put it about that
these boys were illegitimate.

443
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:52,465
Then on June the 26th,

444
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:56,094
he declared himself
king Richard III.

445
00:29:56,177 --> 00:29:58,763
The classic coup d'etat.

446
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:00,890
And of course, the
princes in the tower

447
00:30:00,974 --> 00:30:02,600
were never seen
or heard of again.

448
00:30:02,684 --> 00:30:04,686
- Er...
- Oh. Yes?

449
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,648
Sorry, but his nephews
were illegitimate.

450
00:30:08,732 --> 00:30:12,819
Edward iv had already
married lady Eleanor Butler,

451
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:14,946
so his marriage to
the princes' mother,

452
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,282
Elizabeth woodville,
was unlawful.

453
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:19,534
Those boys would never
have been crowned.

454
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:22,037
They were born out of
an illegal marriage.

455
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,497
Madam, on the royal
family's own website,

456
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:27,917
you will find Richard
listed there as a usurper.

457
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:29,836
Then people are
being misinformed.

458
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,963
There's actually no
contemporary evidence

459
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:33,673
to say he murdered the princes.

460
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:35,884
Tyrrell's admission
that he killed the boys

461
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,218
on Richard's orders?

462
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:40,513
Or the writings of the
Italian courtier Mancini.

463
00:30:40,597 --> 00:30:42,682
Unsupported tudor propaganda.

464
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:46,353
And wilful misrepresentation
of Mancini.

465
00:30:46,436 --> 00:30:47,854
Respectively.

466
00:30:49,522 --> 00:30:52,400
I strongly feel that he's
innocent of their murders.

467
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:56,154
Oh, you "feel" strongly.
You have a feeling.

468
00:30:56,237 --> 00:30:57,864
A hunch, perhaps?

469
00:30:57,947 --> 00:31:00,158
Like Richard?

470
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:01,910
(Laughter)

471
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,037
Actually, no one who met
him when he was alive

472
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,497
said he had a hunchback.

473
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,791
(Lecturer) The opinions
of the greatest historians

474
00:31:07,874 --> 00:31:11,127
of the modern age are in
almost unanimous agreement

475
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:13,588
that Richard III, who of
course met his ignominious end

476
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,840
not ten miles away
from where we now sit,

477
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:19,844
was a usurper and,
all things considered,

478
00:31:19,928 --> 00:31:22,389
a pretty unsavoury individual.

479
00:31:22,472 --> 00:31:24,724
The evidence is that...
That he brought the country

480
00:31:24,808 --> 00:31:27,727
the strong leadership it needed
after the death of his brother

481
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:30,230
and went on to create a
fairer and more just society.

482
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:32,941
Perhaps you might
tell us your name?

483
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,443
Erm...

484
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:39,531
Philippa... Langley.

485
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:40,698
And you're from?

486
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:43,743
The Richard III society.

487
00:31:43,827 --> 00:31:45,203
Oh, the fan club.

488
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:47,997
Well, thank you,
Philippa Langley.

489
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:50,583
But you might like to know
that the study of history

490
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:52,168
is an academic discipline

491
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:55,588
based upon rigorous and
dispassionate research

492
00:31:55,672 --> 00:31:59,008
so that one might take
the evidence and study it

493
00:31:59,092 --> 00:32:02,220
and then draw conclusions,
rather than the other way round.

494
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:07,183
Now, that's not a feeling,
that's a fact. Hmm.

495
00:32:12,272 --> 00:32:14,732
Dr ashdown-hill.
I've read your book.

496
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:16,943
I was wondering if you'd
sign my copy, please.

497
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:19,696
Of course! Well done,
by the way, dear.

498
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:21,614
You stood your ground.

499
00:32:21,698 --> 00:32:24,284
You pay no attention to
him, pompous old queen.

500
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:25,952
- There you go.
- (Woman) Thank you.

501
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:28,913
There's a woman in her
60s living in Canada,

502
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:30,957
and a cabinet maker in clapham

503
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,084
who've got more claim to
the throne than Henry vii.

504
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,753
- Or any of the other tudors.
- Pardon?

505
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:37,505
I've just spent
the last 18 months

506
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,216
tracing the mitochondrial
DNA of Richard's sister

507
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,510
all the way down to their
present-day descendants.

508
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,304
I'm about to
publish the results.

509
00:32:44,387 --> 00:32:45,597
That's amazing!

510
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,808
Er, actually, I was wondering
if I could ask you something.

511
00:32:48,892 --> 00:32:50,018
We'll have to walk and talk.

512
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,436
- Of course.
- I'm already late.

513
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,814
(Philippa) What I wanted to say
is that you've so inspired me,

514
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:56,774
I want to try and find
greyfriars church.

515
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:58,693
(Ashdown-hill) Oh,
that's long since gone.

516
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,320
No, that disappeared
centuries ago.

517
00:33:00,403 --> 00:33:01,779
(Philippa) Right. Well, we know

518
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:03,364
it had to be on a
main thoroughfare

519
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,910
so the friars could beg
alms from passers-by, right?

520
00:33:06,993 --> 00:33:09,412
And that's to the south
of st Martin's church.

521
00:33:09,496 --> 00:33:11,498
Now the cathedral,
which is to the east

522
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:13,666
- of the old city wall...
- Taxi!

523
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,752
Yes, that's very impressive.

524
00:33:15,835 --> 00:33:17,587
I know what you're
really looking for,

525
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,631
and, er, it's not an old church.

526
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:20,715
Oh?

527
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,217
Well, I wish you
the best of luck.

528
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,636
Plenty have tried to
find him and failed.

529
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,054
Gateway house, please.

530
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,223
Well, er, do you
have any advice?

531
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,269
There's a good chance Richard
is under a shopping centre,

532
00:33:33,353 --> 00:33:36,481
forever entombed in a
concrete pile beneath topshop.

533
00:33:36,564 --> 00:33:37,565
(Philippa) Right.

534
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,567
But when the
dissolution occurred,

535
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,277
the friaries and monasteries

536
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:43,279
were still regarded
as sacred places.

537
00:33:43,363 --> 00:33:46,032
People are very superstitious
about things like that.

538
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:47,867
So, although they
may have rebuilt

539
00:33:47,951 --> 00:33:49,285
the surrounding buildings,

540
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:51,496
the site of a church like
greyfriars, for instance,

541
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:53,081
was often left undisturbed.

542
00:33:54,374 --> 00:33:56,084
So what are you saying?

543
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:58,878
Look for an open space.

544
00:33:58,962 --> 00:34:01,881
Ok. Thank you. All right.

545
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:05,570
"From this spot were
scattered into the river soar

546
00:35:05,653 --> 00:35:07,405
the remains of Richard III."

547
00:35:24,631 --> 00:35:26,799
(Horn blares)

548
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:50,740
What was that? On the bridge?

549
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:53,493
- I thought it'd be funny.
- Well, it wasn't.

550
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:57,288
Sorry, did you just talk?

551
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,791
How come you've
never spoken before?

552
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:01,793
You've never asked
me anything before.

553
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:02,960
Right.

554
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,422
Wait, you don't happen to
know where you are, do you?

555
00:36:06,506 --> 00:36:07,924
- Might help.
- Watch out.

556
00:36:08,007 --> 00:36:10,593
- (Car horn beeps)
- You were dead. Sorry.

557
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,282
(Bird wings flutter)

558
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,343
(Breathes heavily)

559
00:37:35,762 --> 00:37:38,347
- (Man) Are you lost?
- Sorry?

560
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:40,808
Erm...

561
00:37:42,852 --> 00:37:44,979
Excuse me, could you, erm...

562
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:50,610
Could you tell me what that
letter represents, please?

563
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:53,070
Just means reserved.

564
00:37:53,154 --> 00:37:55,198
It's the social
services car park.

565
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:57,074
That bay's reserved for
one of the managers.

566
00:37:57,158 --> 00:37:58,993
Of course. Reserved.

567
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:01,954
Thanks.

568
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:13,382
Oh.

569
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:15,218
Oh, shit. Shit.

570
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:18,721
Thanks.

571
00:38:20,473 --> 00:38:21,808
Shit, shit.

572
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:24,602
- (Whistle blows)
- Oh, fuck. Sorry.

573
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:28,105
No! No! No, no, no!

574
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:29,565
Oh, no!

575
00:38:37,073 --> 00:38:38,574
I'm so sorry.

576
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,703
Glass?

577
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,080
I'd better not.

578
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:48,501
No, don't want to be ill for,
er, work tomorrow, do we?

579
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,549
Was Sarah ok?

580
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:58,678
Sarah's fine. Sarah's normal.

581
00:39:04,016 --> 00:39:05,226
Tony rang.

582
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,770
I know you haven't been in
work for the last two weeks.

583
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:11,399
I'm not actually that
bothered that you lied to me

584
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:16,237
or selfishly ruined my evening,
but what about the boys?

585
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,656
I told you we can't afford
for you to be out of work.

586
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:20,199
I know, I know.

587
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,458
It's none of my business, but
were you with someone today?

588
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:33,546
No, absolutely not.

589
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:36,424
Sorry, what do you mean, John?

590
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:41,053
Well, I... you're clearly
hiding something from me.

591
00:39:41,137 --> 00:39:43,139
I mean, where were you today?

592
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:45,600
- Erm, Leicester.
- Leicester?

593
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:49,270
Look, I've had an idea.

594
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:50,813
Now, just listen.

595
00:39:52,565 --> 00:39:55,318
It's not as mad as it's...
Probably going to sound,

596
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:58,821
but, erm, well, I've been
doing a lot of research.

597
00:39:58,905 --> 00:40:01,032
All the information
I need to find him,

598
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:03,200
well, it's all out
there but it's in...

599
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:05,912
Lots of different little pieces
scattered all over the place

600
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:09,540
and I... I don't think anybody's
brought it all together before,

601
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:10,791
but I...

602
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:15,338
I know I can find him.

603
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:17,965
Who?

604
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:20,593
Richard.

605
00:40:20,676 --> 00:40:22,136
Richard who?

606
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:25,514
Sorry, the third.

607
00:40:25,598 --> 00:40:26,974
The king?

608
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:29,936
(Philippa) If I can find
him, I can give him a voice.

609
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:32,939
I think you need help.

610
00:40:33,022 --> 00:40:34,357
John, if you...

611
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,193
If you could just understand
the way it's made me feel.

612
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:41,197
You know, when I'm in the
middle of my research,

613
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,824
when I'm thinking about
what I can do for him, I...

614
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:48,996
I feel energised.

615
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,414
I feel happy.

616
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:52,917
- Do you?
- Yes.

617
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,378
And this, is that why
you wanted me to leave?

618
00:40:55,461 --> 00:40:57,672
Because I didn't make you
feel energised or happy?

619
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:00,341
- You walked out, John.
- It was constructive dismissal.

620
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:01,968
(Sighs)

621
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,638
Always looking for something,

622
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:07,974
isn't that what you always
used to say about me?

623
00:41:08,057 --> 00:41:10,768
Well... well, now I actually am.

624
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,982
Richard III. (Chuckles)

625
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:19,610
I remember there was a picture
in the textbook at school

626
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:23,280
of Richard, and
he creeped me out.

627
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:25,825
It's the evil hunchback that
killed the princes in the tower.

628
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:28,995
Yes, but he didn't kill his
nephews and he wasn't evil.

629
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,331
I don't believe he
even had a hunchback.

630
00:41:32,415 --> 00:41:35,835
That's all stuff the tudors put
about to trash his reputation.

631
00:41:35,918 --> 00:41:39,505
He was a good man.
I'm convinced of it.

632
00:41:39,588 --> 00:41:41,090
But nobody's interested.

633
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:45,011
If I can find him,
then they would be.

634
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,514
What are you talking about?

635
00:41:48,597 --> 00:41:51,475
Ok, imagine this.
You're Henry vii.

636
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:55,062
You're... you're the new
king and you need everyone

637
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:57,773
to hate the king that
came before you, Richard.

638
00:41:57,857 --> 00:42:01,193
So you'd think that in your
first speech to the country,

639
00:42:01,277 --> 00:42:04,321
which was recorded in the
parliamentary archives,

640
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:06,907
that you might mention
the fact that he'd killed

641
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,493
those two little
princes, wouldn't you?

642
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:11,412
But he doesn't.

643
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,539
You're starting to
sound slightly mad.

644
00:42:13,622 --> 00:42:16,083
He doesn't mention them. Why?

645
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,335
Because they must've
still been alive.

646
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:22,548
(Sighs)

647
00:42:23,924 --> 00:42:26,510
You know, I... I think
you might be right.

648
00:42:27,595 --> 00:42:30,639
If he didn't kill them and
he wasn't a hunchback...

649
00:42:33,142 --> 00:42:35,811
Oh, my god, I think I've got it.

650
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,398
Of course, the hump.

651
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:44,487
He must've stuffed the princes
up the back of his jumper!

652
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:46,989
There, you've cracked it!

653
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:53,454
(Door opens)

654
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:56,040
(Door slams)

655
00:43:18,312 --> 00:43:20,773
Hello? Yes, I'd like
to speak to, erm,

656
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:23,025
Richard Buckley, please.
Archaeological services.

657
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:24,985
(Teacher) Stay wide.
Keep your shape.

658
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,404
Support the scrum half.

659
00:43:27,488 --> 00:43:30,324
I just thought as a Leicester
company, you might be

660
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,827
interested in sponsoring
the search for a king.

661
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,080
Hello, er, this is a message
from Philippa Langley

662
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:38,082
for Richard Buckley.

663
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:40,209
Think there's a dig that
he might be interested in.

664
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:43,003
My phone number is
07... Oh, my god!

665
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,922
- Did you see that?
- (Teacher) He's fine.

666
00:43:45,005 --> 00:43:47,091
Oh, my god, darling, are you ok?

667
00:43:47,341 --> 00:43:49,301
(Richard) Please don't
take this the wrong way.

668
00:43:49,385 --> 00:43:50,594
No.

669
00:43:50,678 --> 00:43:53,681
But even from my perspective,

670
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:58,310
this is starting to look a bit
like an unhealthy obsession?

671
00:43:58,394 --> 00:44:00,813
I can't believe
you just said that.

672
00:44:00,896 --> 00:44:03,357
I'm doing this for you.

673
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,651
Do you know what
people say about you?

674
00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:08,988
I'm sure it's not
particularly flattering.

675
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:11,824
Do you know who
William Shakespeare is?

676
00:44:13,242 --> 00:44:15,411
Ok, well, he was a
very celebrated writer,

677
00:44:15,494 --> 00:44:19,248
and everyone thinks he's amazing
and he wrote a play about you.

678
00:44:19,331 --> 00:44:21,417
And there's this bit
where you're supposedly

679
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,752
- talking about yourself.
- Go on.

680
00:44:23,836 --> 00:44:25,880
"So lame and unfashionable

681
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,257
that dogs bark at me
as I halt by them."

682
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,636
You're so weird, that
you even freak out dogs.

683
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,055
That's a bit harsh.

684
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,224
(Laptop chimes)

685
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:38,642
Thank you for your enquiry,

686
00:44:38,726 --> 00:44:40,561
but this is not something
we wish to pursue.

687
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,688
Unfortunately, we are
unable to assist you.

688
00:44:42,771 --> 00:44:45,024
This is not the
sort of project...

689
00:44:45,107 --> 00:44:46,984
Is this a joke? It's
getting rather annoying.

690
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:48,861
- The answer is no.
- Sadly, no.

691
00:44:48,944 --> 00:44:51,947
Unfortunately, your
application has been rejected.

692
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:54,950
Your enquiry was
not appropriate.

693
00:44:55,034 --> 00:44:56,285
The answer is no.

694
00:45:00,122 --> 00:45:02,833
As you all know, I've
been doing some research

695
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:05,294
into finding king
Richard's grave,

696
00:45:05,377 --> 00:45:08,005
with the intention of
giving him a proper burial

697
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:09,965
with a royal coat
of arms on his tomb

698
00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:13,177
and restoring him to his
rightful place in history.

699
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,012
And a "hey, nonny nonny" to you.

700
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:17,306
Well, for personal reasons,

701
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:21,393
I'm going to have to suspend
my research indefinitely...

702
00:45:21,477 --> 00:45:23,729
This is a travesty!
You can't stop now!

703
00:45:23,812 --> 00:45:26,482
- I won't allow it!
- Keith!

704
00:45:26,565 --> 00:45:28,108
If you don't mind me saying,

705
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:32,446
perhaps the kindest thing
is to set the girl free.

706
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:33,697
Many a ricardian,

707
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:36,242
and I'm certainly not looking
at you, you personally,

708
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:41,205
has wandered down that same path
only to discover little more

709
00:45:41,288 --> 00:45:44,708
than the calcified remains
of his own ambition.

710
00:45:47,336 --> 00:45:49,088
What's happened, Philippa?

711
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,341
I've been trying to
generate interest

712
00:45:52,424 --> 00:45:54,551
from possible sponsors,
but I haven't had any luck,

713
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:59,098
and I can't get through to a
guy called Richard Buckley,

714
00:45:59,181 --> 00:46:00,432
a Leicester archaeologist.

715
00:46:00,516 --> 00:46:02,518
Philippa, I used
to live next door

716
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:04,353
to the lord mayor of Leicester.

717
00:46:05,688 --> 00:46:08,732
The current lord mayor.
We used to be neighbours.

718
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:12,069
Well, anyway, my
mind's made up on this.

719
00:46:12,152 --> 00:46:14,405
I could ask him if he'd help.

720
00:46:20,995 --> 00:46:23,956
Dad, how heavy is 330 pounds?

721
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:26,250
(Max) Hello! Is anyone in there?

722
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:28,252
About two of me.

723
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:30,045
And that's how heavy
the Cannon balls are.

724
00:46:30,129 --> 00:46:33,090
And they could fire
them two miles!

725
00:46:33,173 --> 00:46:35,467
(John) Imagine one of
those landing on your foot.

726
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:38,470
- (Philippa) Hey.
- (Raife) Hi, mum.

727
00:46:38,554 --> 00:46:40,264
- (John) Hi.
- (Philippa) Hey.

728
00:46:40,347 --> 00:46:42,391
- (John) Found him yet?
- Very funny.

729
00:46:44,977 --> 00:46:46,687
So, how are you?

730
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,732
Psoriasis is back on my elbows.

731
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:51,066
Work's a bit shit,

732
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:54,320
but just trying to make the
best of it, like everyone else.

733
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,614
Well, almost everyone else.

734
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,702
I spoke to awusi, from work.

735
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,787
Hmm! And what did
she have to say?

736
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:07,416
I should know my place?
Start baking cakes?

737
00:47:07,499 --> 00:47:09,126
People do like cake.

738
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,295
Hmm.

739
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:15,883
John, I... I need to
ask you to do something.

740
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:18,761
No.

741
00:47:18,844 --> 00:47:20,512
You don't know what
it is I'm gonna say.

742
00:47:20,596 --> 00:47:21,805
Well, whatever it is, no.

743
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:24,099
I need you to let your flat
go and move back in with us.

744
00:47:24,183 --> 00:47:26,310
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

745
00:47:26,393 --> 00:47:29,355
I feel like I'm being
cuckolded by a ghost.

746
00:47:29,438 --> 00:47:32,524
John, I just... I
really need to do this.

747
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,070
I'm sorry.

748
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,446
(John sighs)

749
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:43,118
It's colossal, isn't it, dad?

750
00:47:43,202 --> 00:47:44,453
It is.

751
00:47:44,536 --> 00:47:48,248
The thing about mons Meg
is it soon became obsolete

752
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:52,544
because it was so heavy, they
couldn't move it anywhere.

753
00:47:52,628 --> 00:47:55,672
So it wasn't so much a
colossal gun in the end

754
00:47:55,756 --> 00:47:58,217
as a colossal waste of time.

755
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,301
He was talking to you,

756
00:47:59,385 --> 00:48:01,345
but really he was
saying that to mum.

757
00:48:01,428 --> 00:48:03,889
Ok, boys, it's nearly time
for the one o'clock gun.

758
00:48:03,972 --> 00:48:05,516
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.

759
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:15,484
(John) The grass
is always greener

760
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:17,903
- for you, Philippa, isn't it?
- (Max) Hurry up, raife.

761
00:48:17,986 --> 00:48:20,406
Other women seem perfectly
happy with their lot.

762
00:48:20,489 --> 00:48:22,366
I don't think they are.

763
00:48:22,449 --> 00:48:25,202
Is, erm, is that the picture
you were shown at school?

764
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:26,745
- That one?
- (John) Yes.

765
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:28,664
The tudors doctored
that painting.

766
00:48:28,747 --> 00:48:29,873
Really?

767
00:48:29,957 --> 00:48:31,959
It was x-rayed and proved
that they retouched it

768
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,128
to make him look evil.
Look at the thumb.

769
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:37,381
It's been sharpened into a
claw. They narrowed his eyes

770
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:39,466
and made his lips
thinner and meaner.

771
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:42,136
That is what he
really looked like.

772
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:45,889
Normal eyes, normal
mouth, normal thumb. See?

773
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:49,560
(John) Yes, but how can you
possibly find him on your own?

774
00:48:49,643 --> 00:48:51,854
And even if you do, what then?

775
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:53,772
You're trying to
make him perfect.

776
00:48:53,856 --> 00:48:56,024
He wasn't. None of us is.

777
00:48:56,108 --> 00:48:58,694
We always try to
demonise people,

778
00:48:58,777 --> 00:49:00,946
or sanctify them.
You know, we're...

779
00:49:01,029 --> 00:49:03,240
You know, we're
all in the middle.

780
00:49:03,323 --> 00:49:05,576
I mean, I'm sure Mother Teresa

781
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:08,495
left the top off the
milk now and then.

782
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,915
And, er, I'll bet
that genghis Khan

783
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:14,084
occasionally picked
up bits of litter.

784
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:16,795
Yeah. Human.

785
00:49:16,879 --> 00:49:19,673
Not perfect and not
a... Not a demon either.

786
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:22,634
(Sighs) You always do
the same thing, Philippa.

787
00:49:22,718 --> 00:49:24,136
You pretend to ask me something,

788
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:27,389
but the truth is, you just
put a gun against my head.

789
00:49:27,473 --> 00:49:28,515
(Cannon fires)

790
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:04,968
Hi. Er, Philippa Langley here
to see mr Buckley, please.

791
00:50:05,052 --> 00:50:07,346
And which company are you from?

792
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:10,599
Oh, no. I'm not with a company,
but he is expecting me.

793
00:50:11,517 --> 00:50:12,893
Cheers.

794
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:19,399
Erm, actually,
sorry. You don't...

795
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:22,861
You don't happen to have
a knife, do you, at all?

796
00:50:22,945 --> 00:50:25,531
You're gonna have to take this
meeting on your own, Mathew.

797
00:50:25,614 --> 00:50:26,615
I've got too much to do.

798
00:50:26,698 --> 00:50:28,492
The bloody thing's been
forced on us anyway.

799
00:50:28,575 --> 00:50:30,786
Richard, this is
Philippa Langley.

800
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:34,623
- Hello. Richard Buckley.
- Hello. Erm...

801
00:50:34,706 --> 00:50:36,959
This is my deputy,
Mathew Morris.

802
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:39,211
Sorry, can I sit down, please?

803
00:50:39,294 --> 00:50:41,046
Er, yes, there,
of course. Erm...

804
00:50:41,129 --> 00:50:42,172
Thank you.

805
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:44,341
Is anything...
Anything the matter?

806
00:50:44,424 --> 00:50:47,261
So sorry, I've got me
and it's a real illness.

807
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,556
It... it comes on
at times of stress.

808
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:52,432
Would you like a glass of water?

809
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,269
(Philippa) Yes, please,
that'd be lovely. Thank you.

810
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,187
- Would you like to reschedule?
- No.

811
00:50:57,271 --> 00:51:02,234
Erm, actually, I've...
I've... got a cake for you.

812
00:51:02,317 --> 00:51:04,236
- Not for me.
- Thank you very much.

813
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,071
(Philippa) It's,
er, lemon drizzle.

814
00:51:06,154 --> 00:51:07,906
Your receptionist
gave me a knife.

815
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:09,032
Thank you.

816
00:51:09,116 --> 00:51:11,410
- (Philippa) Thank you so much.
- Pleasure.

817
00:51:12,077 --> 00:51:14,079
So you're a friend of the mayor?

818
00:51:14,162 --> 00:51:16,415
- No.
- Oh, I thought...

819
00:51:16,498 --> 00:51:20,794
My friend used to live next
door to him, so I sort of...

820
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,380
I sort of used
him to get to you.

821
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,009
- And it worked.
- (Philippa) Hmm.

822
00:51:27,092 --> 00:51:30,596
- So, er, what is it you wanted?
- Thank you.

823
00:51:30,679 --> 00:51:32,598
Erm...

824
00:51:32,681 --> 00:51:35,809
I've... I've got a
archaeological proposal

825
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,145
about Richard III that might...

826
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:39,938
I hope would be of
interest to you.

827
00:51:40,022 --> 00:51:41,690
Ok.

828
00:51:41,773 --> 00:51:44,818
I'm planning to raise the
funds to pay you, of course.

829
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,695
Ok.

830
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:50,699
Do you want me to start
talking about it now?

831
00:51:50,782 --> 00:51:52,784
Please do. (Chuckles)

832
00:51:53,994 --> 00:51:56,955
- I want to dig for Richard.
- For Richard?

833
00:51:57,039 --> 00:51:58,373
Yes.

834
00:51:58,457 --> 00:52:01,418
And what is it you
want to dig for?

835
00:52:03,003 --> 00:52:04,963
Richard.

836
00:52:05,047 --> 00:52:06,298
The third.

837
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:09,718
Yes, in connection
with Richard III,

838
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:11,720
what is it you're
hoping to find?

839
00:52:12,638 --> 00:52:14,014
Him. Him.

840
00:52:16,308 --> 00:52:17,643
- Him?
- (Philippa) Yes.

841
00:52:19,227 --> 00:52:20,729
I think I know where he is.

842
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,526
I'm really sorry. I
think I need some air.

843
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,819
(Buckley) Oh, of course.

844
00:52:27,903 --> 00:52:29,446
- I'm so sorry.
- Let me help you.

845
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:31,156
- Would you mind?
- Could you?

846
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:33,533
- Yes, of course. Of course.
- There we are.

847
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:34,868
There we go.

848
00:52:36,036 --> 00:52:37,829
- Thank you.
- That's the way.

849
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:43,251
(Buckley) So, where
do you think he is?

850
00:52:43,335 --> 00:52:46,588
It's my understanding that his
remains were thrown into...

851
00:52:46,672 --> 00:52:48,548
He wasn't thrown
into the river soar.

852
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,177
I read that in your book

853
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,097
and that rumour has
been since discredited.

854
00:52:56,807 --> 00:53:01,269
Well, you may well be right.
He may be out there somewhere.

855
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:03,605
But even if we... Even
if we can pinpoint

856
00:53:03,689 --> 00:53:05,440
where greyfriars once stood,

857
00:53:05,524 --> 00:53:08,026
finding him would be
virtually impossible.

858
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:11,238
Literally finding a needle in
a haystack would be easier.

859
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:14,282
Well, according to the
historian John ashdown-hill,

860
00:53:14,366 --> 00:53:15,826
the site of greyfriars

861
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:17,911
would probably still be
an open space somewhere.

862
00:53:19,371 --> 00:53:20,789
So, can you help me?

863
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:23,667
No.

864
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:27,212
- Oh.
- I don't look for people.

865
00:53:27,295 --> 00:53:29,172
If you go and look
for a single thing...

866
00:53:29,256 --> 00:53:30,924
He just called me a thing.

867
00:53:32,968 --> 00:53:35,679
Please don't call him that.
He is a person, not a thing.

868
00:53:35,762 --> 00:53:37,305
Ok, I'm just saying,

869
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:40,726
I don't go looking for
one specific thing.

870
00:53:40,809 --> 00:53:42,060
He just said it again.

871
00:53:42,894 --> 00:53:44,688
- You just said it again.
- Sorry.

872
00:53:44,771 --> 00:53:46,606
Er, the point I'm trying to make

873
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,818
is that's not how
archaeology works.

874
00:53:51,403 --> 00:53:52,946
All right, well, erm...

875
00:53:54,656 --> 00:53:56,742
Well, how about we
look for a church?

876
00:53:56,825 --> 00:53:59,035
The whole church,
not just Richard?

877
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,581
What can you show us to back
up any of what you're saying?

878
00:54:02,664 --> 00:54:06,209
Actually, would you
mind? Thank you so much.

879
00:54:07,127 --> 00:54:11,631
Well, here's the relevant
parts of my research.

880
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,800
Well, why don't you
leave this with me,

881
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:17,679
- and I'll get back to you?
- Of course, yes.

882
00:54:17,763 --> 00:54:19,347
I've got copies.
You can keep that.

883
00:54:19,431 --> 00:54:20,682
Thank you.

884
00:54:21,767 --> 00:54:25,562
- So, are you feeling better now?
- Much.

885
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,816
Goodbye, mr Buckley.

886
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,486
- Richard.
- The third, yes.

887
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,863
No. That's my name. Richard.

888
00:54:34,946 --> 00:54:37,491
- (Laughs)
- Of course it is.

889
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,034
Goodbye, Richard.

890
00:54:39,117 --> 00:54:41,620
- Thank you for the cake.
- My pleasure.

891
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:44,915
- Bye, Mathew.
- Goodbye.

892
00:54:44,998 --> 00:54:46,208
- Yes.
- Thank you.

893
00:54:47,876 --> 00:54:50,670
I'll tell the lord mayor's
office that we've met her,

894
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:53,173
duty done, and email her
thanks, but no, thanks.

895
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:54,549
Yep, ok.

896
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:58,678
It's funny. I do
enjoy talking to you.

897
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,430
If it's to tell me
again how ugly I am,

898
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:02,516
i'd, er, rather
you didn't bother.

899
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:03,975
(Philippa sighs)

900
00:55:05,393 --> 00:55:07,771
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

901
00:55:09,648 --> 00:55:12,108
- The princes in the tower.
- Hmm.

902
00:55:12,192 --> 00:55:15,529
- Your nephews.
- What about them?

903
00:55:16,571 --> 00:55:18,824
Well, what... What
happened to them?

904
00:55:22,494 --> 00:55:23,912
What do you think
happened to them?

905
00:55:23,995 --> 00:55:25,705
I don't know.

906
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,124
Well, lots of people say you
killed them or had them killed

907
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:30,836
so you could become king, but...

908
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:33,046
Did you?

909
00:55:34,005 --> 00:55:35,632
You're really asking me that?

910
00:55:37,926 --> 00:55:41,972
Well, I know Edward
also had five daughters.

911
00:55:42,055 --> 00:55:45,684
And then there was your
older brother George's son.

912
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:48,311
And your sister had seven sons,

913
00:55:48,395 --> 00:55:50,814
and they all had
claims to the throne.

914
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:55,652
So if you killed one, you'd
have to kill them all.

915
00:55:55,735 --> 00:55:58,321
And that's what I tell people.

916
00:55:58,405 --> 00:55:59,406
(Chuckles quietly)

917
00:56:04,786 --> 00:56:07,080
No. I... I'm sorry.

918
00:56:07,914 --> 00:56:11,960
Please don't go. I'm just
trying to understand.

919
00:56:18,425 --> 00:56:20,343
I'm sorry.

920
00:56:20,427 --> 00:56:22,429
(Door opens)

921
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,600
(Door shuts)

922
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:30,770
- Hey.
- How did it go?

923
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:36,943
Erm, hard to say. Ok,
I think. I don't know.

924
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:39,654
It's just, suddenly,
it feels like, erm...

925
00:56:39,738 --> 00:56:41,615
Well, it's a bit
scary because it's...

926
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,701
I feel it's the last-chance
saloon, you know?

927
00:56:46,411 --> 00:56:48,830
How'd it go with,
erm, sea... Sarah.

928
00:56:48,914 --> 00:56:50,081
Yes, go on, seafood Sarah.

929
00:56:50,165 --> 00:56:52,083
I know what you and
the boys call her.

930
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:54,878
- Sorry.
- Anyway, we split up.

931
00:56:54,961 --> 00:56:56,713
Oh, no! Why?

932
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:58,757
Because she bored the
bloody pants off me.

933
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,551
A bit too normal, then.

934
00:57:01,635 --> 00:57:04,554
Every sentence started
with, "to tell the truth."

935
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:07,891
Why would she automatically
assume I thought she was lying?

936
00:57:09,476 --> 00:57:10,477
Nothing else?

937
00:57:11,686 --> 00:57:15,607
- (Sighs) She had big feet.
- There it is.

938
00:57:18,026 --> 00:57:19,402
You know, er, Richard III,

939
00:57:19,486 --> 00:57:22,906
he may have been, er,
a wise and just leader

940
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:25,367
and I'm sure had
he lived longer,

941
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,243
he would've avoided
all the bloodshed

942
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:29,829
of the reformation and,
you know, whatever.

943
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,958
But would he have
sold his collection

944
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:36,211
of sex pistols memorabilia to
help pay for a new kitchen?

945
00:57:36,294 --> 00:57:41,091
Oh, yeah, absolutely. All
day long. No question.

946
00:57:41,174 --> 00:57:45,136
Would he have driven
15 miles, on a Sunday,

947
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:48,515
to a service station to
buy his pregnant wife

948
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,600
a greggs cheese and onion pasty?

949
00:57:51,476 --> 00:57:55,522
No, he would've ridden
there. On his white steed.

950
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:57,983
That's what he would have done.

951
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,128
(John sighs)

952
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:20,171
Do we really want to go
down that path again?

953
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,300
- Probably not.
- No.

954
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,059
- Night, love.
- Goodnight.

955
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:36,896
(Philippa) Sleep well.

956
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,333
(Door slams)

957
00:58:58,084 --> 00:58:59,210
How did it go?

958
00:58:59,294 --> 00:59:01,796
"The university faces
challenging times."

959
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,466
"Profound regret.
Blah-di-bloody-blah."

960
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:06,051
They're shutting us down?

961
00:59:06,134 --> 00:59:09,220
They've withdrawn
their funding. Fuck!

962
00:59:09,304 --> 00:59:11,431
I've just ordered new
laptops for everyone.

963
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:14,184
We're not shutting down, ok?

964
00:59:14,267 --> 00:59:17,062
Instead of working exclusively
for the university,

965
00:59:17,145 --> 00:59:20,774
we'll just have to find
funding from other sources.

966
00:59:22,484 --> 00:59:25,570
Mathew, did you send that
email to, er, Philippa?

967
00:59:25,653 --> 00:59:27,197
The cake lady?

968
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,449
Er, no, I don't
think I have yet, no.

969
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:32,452
Good. Don't. Arrange
another meeting.

970
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:40,003
When I got the call, I
was convinced it would be,

971
00:59:40,085 --> 00:59:42,128
- "thanks, but no, thanks."
- Oh, no, no, no.

972
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:44,380
- (Mathew) Don't be silly.
- It's a new era for us.

973
00:59:44,464 --> 00:59:47,759
We are available for
hire. Ah, there we are.

974
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:52,722
Oh, wow.

975
00:59:54,265 --> 00:59:57,435
So, that's st Martin's
church. Now the cathedral.

976
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:01,481
That's Robert herrick's garden.

977
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:05,443
We found it in the
council archives.

978
01:00:05,527 --> 01:00:08,655
I've heard about this map, but
I never thought I'd see it.

979
01:00:10,698 --> 01:00:12,033
What's that there?

980
01:00:12,117 --> 01:00:15,578
Some sort of garden
feature. A pagoda?

981
01:00:16,996 --> 01:00:18,873
Well, herrick was
rumoured to have a king

982
01:00:18,957 --> 01:00:20,875
buried in his back garden.

983
01:00:20,959 --> 01:00:23,336
A circular feature with
four pathways leading to it

984
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,547
says, "come and have a
look at what I've got."

985
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:27,590
Hmm!

986
01:00:27,674 --> 01:00:30,552
It's hard to be precise
about where that is, though.

987
01:00:30,635 --> 01:00:34,931
Erm, maps from that long ago
very often weren't to scale.

988
01:00:35,014 --> 01:00:36,099
Right.

989
01:00:37,976 --> 01:00:39,894
What about if we
just superimpose this

990
01:00:39,978 --> 01:00:41,104
over a modern map?

991
01:00:41,187 --> 01:00:43,773
No, that won't work because...

992
01:00:45,525 --> 01:00:47,861
Well, I don't know
why not, actually.

993
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,155
Erm, has that been
done before, Mathew?

994
01:00:50,238 --> 01:00:52,615
- Worth a try, surely?
- Hmm.

995
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:57,871
(Richard) Hmm.

996
01:00:58,663 --> 01:01:01,332
(Mathew) So, here
is the modern map.

997
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:04,252
And here's the old one.

998
01:01:04,335 --> 01:01:10,466
Er, Leicester cathedral was
then, erm, at st Martin's.

999
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,887
Friar Lane is, er...

1000
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,764
Oh, still the same, just,
er, spelt differently.

1001
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,392
Now, cank street.
Where's cank street?

1002
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:23,104
Cank street is now st Martin's.

1003
01:01:23,188 --> 01:01:27,859
And, er, high street
is southgates.

1004
01:01:27,942 --> 01:01:30,737
(Buckley) Well, if the
herrick map is accurate...

1005
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,988
(Mathew) And to scale.

1006
01:01:32,071 --> 01:01:34,741
(Buckley) ...Whatever it
is in herrick's garden

1007
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:38,411
is now right in the middle of
the social services car park.

1008
01:01:48,546 --> 01:01:50,423
It's still an open space.

1009
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,763
Perhaps we should
start looking there.

1010
01:01:57,764 --> 01:01:59,057
For greyfriars.

1011
01:02:01,643 --> 01:02:04,020
If we're saying this is
about finding the church,

1012
01:02:04,103 --> 01:02:07,440
then on that basis... I'm in.

1013
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:10,652
Thank you.

1014
01:02:10,735 --> 01:02:14,447
- (Buckley) It won't be cheap.
- I'll raise the funds.

1015
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,282
You need the council
to help with that

1016
01:02:16,366 --> 01:02:18,826
- and with all the permits.
- (Mathew) I'll help.

1017
01:02:19,786 --> 01:02:21,037
I know.

1018
01:02:32,757 --> 01:02:35,551
I'm Sarah levitt and I'm
head of arts and museums

1019
01:02:35,635 --> 01:02:37,345
for Leicester city council.

1020
01:02:37,428 --> 01:02:38,846
And now Philippa is here

1021
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:41,432
to answer any queries
that we may have.

1022
01:02:41,516 --> 01:02:42,558
Thank you.

1023
01:02:42,642 --> 01:02:44,811
Philippa. Martin Peters.

1024
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:47,230
I run an organisation which
promotes leicestershire.

1025
01:02:47,313 --> 01:02:50,650
- Hi.
- What's your funding plan?

1026
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:54,445
Well, I wanted to put it out to
a number of interested parties,

1027
01:02:54,529 --> 01:02:55,905
including yourself.

1028
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:58,574
Erm, the council,
Leicester university.

1029
01:02:58,658 --> 01:03:00,660
And then hopefully
make up any shortfall

1030
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:03,037
by pitching it to
potential sponsors.

1031
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,540
Richard Taylor, Leicester uni.

1032
01:03:05,623 --> 01:03:08,001
Now, we, potentially,

1033
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,336
might have some funding
we could put in.

1034
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:14,674
But I'm concerned
about your costs.

1035
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:17,802
I mean, radar
survey of the site.

1036
01:03:17,885 --> 01:03:19,929
Digging up the car park.

1037
01:03:20,013 --> 01:03:22,265
Paying for everyone's
car parking

1038
01:03:22,348 --> 01:03:23,766
whilst the dig is
being carried out.

1039
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:25,351
Reinstating the car park.

1040
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:27,979
I mean... what is your budget?

1041
01:03:28,062 --> 01:03:29,647
Forty, 50k?

1042
01:03:29,731 --> 01:03:31,482
Thirty-five.

1043
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:33,985
And the rest?

1044
01:03:34,068 --> 01:03:36,279
The thing is, we don't know

1045
01:03:36,362 --> 01:03:39,991
how long the car park will
remain just that, a car park.

1046
01:03:40,074 --> 01:03:41,117
There are rumours

1047
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,619
that the site might be
sold and redeveloped.

1048
01:03:43,703 --> 01:03:46,372
And then that chance
is gone forever.

1049
01:03:47,707 --> 01:03:52,795
I... I believe that this is a
very important historical site.

1050
01:03:54,005 --> 01:03:57,050
I've the strongest
feeling about this.

1051
01:03:58,718 --> 01:04:01,471
You see, for me, a
feeling is what you get

1052
01:04:01,554 --> 01:04:03,598
when you sit on a bus
seat that's still warm.

1053
01:04:03,681 --> 01:04:05,516
(Chuckles quietly)

1054
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,354
Supposing, against all the
odds, that you do find a body,

1055
01:04:09,437 --> 01:04:13,441
that you believe to be
that of Richard III,

1056
01:04:13,524 --> 01:04:16,027
how can you possibly
prove that it's him?

1057
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:17,111
Well, actually...

1058
01:04:17,195 --> 01:04:18,654
Because it's got
all the hallmarks

1059
01:04:18,738 --> 01:04:20,031
of being a wild-goose chase.

1060
01:04:20,114 --> 01:04:22,742
If you could just
let Philippa answer.

1061
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:23,993
(Philippa) Thank you.

1062
01:04:25,203 --> 01:04:29,123
Actually, erm, the
historian John ashdown-hill

1063
01:04:29,207 --> 01:04:32,293
has traced living
descendants of Richard's

1064
01:04:33,211 --> 01:04:34,462
back through 500 years

1065
01:04:34,545 --> 01:04:36,506
of the female
mitochondrial DNA line.

1066
01:04:36,589 --> 01:04:42,136
So... a simple DNA test
would establish definitively

1067
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:43,846
whether any remains were his.

1068
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:48,684
Any other questions? No?

1069
01:04:48,768 --> 01:04:50,186
Thank you, Philippa.

1070
01:04:50,269 --> 01:04:51,687
If you'd like to
wait downstairs,

1071
01:04:51,771 --> 01:04:52,980
we'll discuss this further.

1072
01:04:53,064 --> 01:04:54,315
Sure. Thank you.

1073
01:05:01,614 --> 01:05:02,907
Thank you so much.

1074
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:10,998
Now, I'm sure this
woman means well,

1075
01:05:11,082 --> 01:05:12,500
but it's important
to acknowledge

1076
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:14,210
that she's an amateur.

1077
01:05:14,293 --> 01:05:15,837
And she has an emotional dynamic

1078
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,839
which I don't think
is very helpful.

1079
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:21,968
My concern is for the
reputation of the university,

1080
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:23,970
should this whole
thing become a fiasco.

1081
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:30,101
Huh! I mean, Richard III,
under a car park. (Chuckles)

1082
01:05:38,484 --> 01:05:42,029
- Hi.
- Hi. (Clears throat)

1083
01:05:42,113 --> 01:05:43,906
It's been approved.
Congratulations.

1084
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:45,199
- What? No!
- Yes.

1085
01:05:45,283 --> 01:05:46,409
- No!
- Yes.

1086
01:05:46,492 --> 01:05:48,619
Oh, and you are
also fully funded.

1087
01:05:48,703 --> 01:05:51,581
Martin Peters from
leicestershire promotions

1088
01:05:51,664 --> 01:05:53,332
has agreed to give
you the full 35k.

1089
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,668
He thinks the publicity
would be great for the city,

1090
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:57,462
- and I agree.
- Oh, my goodness.

1091
01:05:57,545 --> 01:05:59,172
Oh, thank you so much.

1092
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,132
Now, can I give you
a piece of advice?

1093
01:06:01,215 --> 01:06:02,467
Of course, yes.

1094
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:04,635
Please don't mention
your feelings again.

1095
01:06:05,553 --> 01:06:06,596
Right, yes, of course.

1096
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:07,805
- I keep doing that.
- Yes.

1097
01:06:07,889 --> 01:06:10,099
People love to use that as
a stick to beat you with.

1098
01:06:10,183 --> 01:06:13,227
- Especially if you're a woman.
- Of course. Thank you so much.

1099
01:06:13,311 --> 01:06:15,771
This is the equivalent of
someone with a homemade rocket

1100
01:06:15,855 --> 01:06:17,482
saying they're gonna
reach the moon.

1101
01:06:17,565 --> 01:06:19,066
That's how we
should look at this.

1102
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:22,361
Be hilarious if she actually
found him though, wouldn't it?

1103
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:25,740
Would it? Be hilarious?

1104
01:06:34,373 --> 01:06:36,626
- Hello.
- She seemed nice.

1105
01:06:36,709 --> 01:06:39,378
Sarah? Yeah, she is. Very.

1106
01:06:40,213 --> 01:06:41,214
Erm...

1107
01:06:44,175 --> 01:06:46,177
I didn't think I was
gonna see you again

1108
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:49,597
after, you know,
the other night.

1109
01:06:51,265 --> 01:06:55,186
I'm sorry, I... I mean, I
know it's a touchy subject.

1110
01:06:57,188 --> 01:06:59,899
I believe you, by the way.

1111
01:07:00,942 --> 01:07:04,362
I definitely don't think
you did... kill them.

1112
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,449
Just to clear that up.

1113
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:12,578
I thought you were really
impressive with those people.

1114
01:07:15,915 --> 01:07:17,208
Thank you.

1115
01:07:21,587 --> 01:07:23,256
(Philippa) Exciting, isn't it?

1116
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:26,425
(Buckley) I think it's a waste
of money. In my experience,

1117
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:30,179
you hardly ever get anything
definitive from radar surveys.

1118
01:07:30,263 --> 01:07:31,847
(Machine beeps)

1119
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:51,909
Results from the radar
survey. All negative.

1120
01:07:51,993 --> 01:07:53,953
Well, that can't be right.

1121
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:55,746
They didn't spot anything, John.

1122
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:58,874
There's no walls, no
foundation, no graves.

1123
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:01,210
There must've been something
there before the car park.

1124
01:08:01,294 --> 01:08:03,879
There's no way they'll let
me go ahead with the dig now.

1125
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:06,507
What does Richard say?

1126
01:08:10,928 --> 01:08:12,096
- Richard?
- Hmm.

1127
01:08:12,179 --> 01:08:15,057
- Why don't you ask his opinion?
- He doesn't mean me.

1128
01:08:17,518 --> 01:08:19,353
- Buckley?
- (John) Hmm.

1129
01:08:19,437 --> 01:08:21,063
Richard Buckley, yes, of course.

1130
01:08:21,772 --> 01:08:23,065
I did warn you.

1131
01:08:23,941 --> 01:08:25,568
(Philippa) Yes, I know. I know.

1132
01:08:25,651 --> 01:08:27,278
But what do we do now?

1133
01:08:27,361 --> 01:08:29,864
Well, have you spoken to
Sarah levitt this morning?

1134
01:08:29,947 --> 01:08:31,198
No. Why?

1135
01:08:31,282 --> 01:08:34,452
More bad news, I'm afraid.

1136
01:08:34,535 --> 01:08:37,204
Leicestershire promotions
have pulled out.

1137
01:08:37,288 --> 01:08:38,789
(Gasps)

1138
01:08:39,457 --> 01:08:40,958
But that's all our funding.

1139
01:08:41,042 --> 01:08:44,670
Sarah did say the council will
still support you for now,

1140
01:08:44,754 --> 01:08:48,007
but you're gonna need to raise
new finance very quickly.

1141
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,092
Well, what about
Leicester university?

1142
01:08:50,176 --> 01:08:52,386
Surely with you involved,
they can't just ignore me?

1143
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:55,473
Leicester university is not a
benevolent seat of learning.

1144
01:08:55,556 --> 01:08:56,599
It's a business.

1145
01:08:57,642 --> 01:09:00,186
And they've recently
dispensed with my services.

1146
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:03,856
Oh, Richard, I'm so
sorry. I had no idea. I...

1147
01:09:05,191 --> 01:09:07,902
Have faith in your
research, Philippa.

1148
01:09:09,236 --> 01:09:11,364
Have faith in yourself.

1149
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:15,826
If you're asking if I'm
still in, the answer's yes.

1150
01:09:17,828 --> 01:09:19,205
Thank you. Thank you, Richard.

1151
01:09:20,831 --> 01:09:22,083
Yes, bye.

1152
01:09:27,505 --> 01:09:29,215
Hooray for Richard Buckley.

1153
01:09:30,424 --> 01:09:32,510
At least he hasn't abandoned us.

1154
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:35,596
- What about the funds you need?
- I don't know, really.

1155
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,807
I... suppose I'll have
to think of something.

1156
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:41,477
The main thing is that they
haven't closed us down.

1157
01:09:43,062 --> 01:09:44,355
Completely.

1158
01:09:45,898 --> 01:09:47,858
- Dad?
- Yes, raife?

1159
01:09:48,776 --> 01:09:50,736
Mum talks to herself.

1160
01:09:53,739 --> 01:09:55,783
Well, we all do.

1161
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:03,207
Er, a few blisters, but, er...

1162
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:07,211
- Well?
- He's asking too much for it.

1163
01:10:07,294 --> 01:10:10,381
What you wanna do
is go in at £3,750.

1164
01:10:10,464 --> 01:10:15,469
Tell him four's your top
offer, and settle for £4,250.

1165
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:18,222
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

1166
01:10:18,305 --> 01:10:19,932
- Hi, mum.
- Mum!

1167
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:22,268
- Hello, darlings.
- Any luck?

1168
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:26,021
Erm, managed to claw back £5,000
from leicestershire promotions.

1169
01:10:26,105 --> 01:10:28,023
- But that's about it.
- Oh, that's... good.

1170
01:10:28,107 --> 01:10:29,734
Suddenly everyone's
got cold feet.

1171
01:10:29,817 --> 01:10:31,444
- Mum!
- I don't quite know what to do.

1172
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:34,488
- Yes, darling?
- (John) Ok, well, look. Not now.

1173
01:10:34,572 --> 01:10:36,657
Perhaps it's, you
know, an opportunity

1174
01:10:36,741 --> 01:10:39,618
- to take stock of everything.
- What do you mean?

1175
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:42,288
Well, you know, I don't plan
on spending the rest of my life

1176
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,373
- sleeping on a sofa.
- Mum.

1177
01:10:44,457 --> 01:10:46,917
- Yes?
- Dad's getting a new car!

1178
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:49,503
- Is he really? Very nice.
- (Doorbell rings)

1179
01:10:49,587 --> 01:10:50,713
Perhaps he can drop you

1180
01:10:50,796 --> 01:10:52,882
right in front of the
school now, can't he? Hmm?

1181
01:10:52,965 --> 01:10:55,342
(Doorbell rings)

1182
01:10:55,426 --> 01:10:57,803
She hasn't made us
any dinner again.

1183
01:10:57,887 --> 01:11:00,181
- It's disgraceful.
- Shut up, raife.

1184
01:11:00,264 --> 01:11:01,390
Yeah, shut up, raife.

1185
01:11:01,474 --> 01:11:03,314
(John) Come on, let's go
into town, get a bite.

1186
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:06,270
- Come on through.
- Get out of her hair.

1187
01:11:06,353 --> 01:11:08,606
Everybody, this is,
erm, Annette, Hamish

1188
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:10,566
from the society. Max and raife.

1189
01:11:10,649 --> 01:11:13,194
And this is my, erm...
Well, this is John.

1190
01:11:13,277 --> 01:11:14,320
- Ex-husband.
- Yeah.

1191
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:16,113
What are you doing?
Are you coming, going?

1192
01:11:16,197 --> 01:11:17,865
We're gonna go into
town, get a bite.

1193
01:11:17,948 --> 01:11:19,283
(Philippa) Quick as you can.

1194
01:11:19,366 --> 01:11:21,494
We will stay out as long
as is humanly possible.

1195
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:23,245
Take your time. Come through.

1196
01:11:23,329 --> 01:11:24,663
(Raife) If I had two sons,

1197
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:26,749
I would make sure they
had something to eat

1198
01:11:26,832 --> 01:11:29,043
before I went looking
for Richard III.

1199
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:31,545
(John sighs)

1200
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:34,673
I'm wondering now if
we make a direct appeal

1201
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,384
to the ricardians to raise
some funds for the dig.

1202
01:11:37,468 --> 01:11:40,179
- A crowd fund.
- Yes, exactly that.

1203
01:11:40,888 --> 01:11:42,932
Er, what do you want to call it?

1204
01:11:43,015 --> 01:11:45,768
Oh, I couldn't decide
between digging the king

1205
01:11:45,851 --> 01:11:47,436
because it works on two levels.

1206
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,357
We are actually digging for
him and also want people to...

1207
01:11:52,566 --> 01:11:53,692
"Dig" Richard.

1208
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,862
Yeah, I-I got that.
What's the other title?

1209
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:00,407
- Looking for Richard project.
- (Both) Call it that.

1210
01:12:00,908 --> 01:12:01,992
Right.

1211
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,833
Should that be "sudden
and unexpected shortfall"?

1212
01:12:08,916 --> 01:12:10,084
- Hmm.
- Ok.

1213
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:11,669
That's good.

1214
01:12:15,172 --> 01:12:17,424
- Happy?
- I think so.

1215
01:12:17,508 --> 01:12:19,969
Certainly better
than what I had.

1216
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:21,887
- Send?
- Yeah.

1217
01:12:23,722 --> 01:12:25,349
- (Laptop chimes)
- (Hamish) That's it.

1218
01:12:25,432 --> 01:12:27,685
Three and half thousand
society members.

1219
01:12:27,768 --> 01:12:31,021
If everyone sends in a pound,
be a good start, wouldn't it?

1220
01:12:31,105 --> 01:12:33,440
I'd say. Thank you so much.

1221
01:12:46,036 --> 01:12:48,247
(Couch creaks)

1222
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:52,668
(Sighs)

1223
01:12:56,422 --> 01:12:57,965
(Phone buzzes)

1224
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:08,809
(Phone buzzes)

1225
01:13:14,899 --> 01:13:16,442
(Phone buzzes)

1226
01:13:27,328 --> 01:13:28,704
(Sighs)

1227
01:13:30,831 --> 01:13:32,291
(Phone buzzes)

1228
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:34,627
There are still emails
coming in from america,

1229
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:39,173
Australia, South Africa,
Germany, Canada, Brazil.

1230
01:13:39,256 --> 01:13:41,133
So, how much has been pledged?

1231
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:44,887
Oh, well, the current
total is, er...

1232
01:13:46,013 --> 01:13:48,891
£26,374 and rising.

1233
01:13:48,974 --> 01:13:50,267
I can't believe it.

1234
01:13:50,351 --> 01:13:53,312
Our own chairman has donated
£5,000 all by himself.

1235
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:54,563
- Phil stone?
- Yeah.

1236
01:13:54,647 --> 01:13:57,274
And another £2,000 from
an anonymous source.

1237
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:00,903
People have been so
generous, it's overwhelming.

1238
01:14:01,946 --> 01:14:03,614
I think it's gonna happen.

1239
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:15,459
(Woman) Can we keep
this clear, please?

1240
01:14:16,293 --> 01:14:17,670
(Man) Over here, please.

1241
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,682
Oh, very patriotic.

1242
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:48,951
- Right.
- Thank you.

1243
01:14:49,034 --> 01:14:50,411
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much.

1244
01:14:50,494 --> 01:14:51,578
I'll need it.

1245
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:55,124
(Tannoy) The train now
standing at platform three

1246
01:14:55,207 --> 01:14:58,335
is the 10:25 service
to inverness.

1247
01:14:58,419 --> 01:15:03,674
Calling at haymarket,
falkirk, stirling, dunblane,

1248
01:15:03,757 --> 01:15:07,386
gleneagles, Perth, dunkeld,

1249
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:09,930
pitlochry, Blair atholl...

1250
01:15:12,141 --> 01:15:13,684
What's wrong?

1251
01:15:19,356 --> 01:15:20,899
Where's the new car?

1252
01:15:22,026 --> 01:15:24,069
The boys said you were
getting a new car.

1253
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,530
What?

1254
01:15:26,613 --> 01:15:28,032
It was you, wasn't it?

1255
01:15:29,074 --> 01:15:31,660
Two thousand pounds
for the appeal.

1256
01:15:31,744 --> 01:15:33,370
It was the boys' idea.

1257
01:15:33,454 --> 01:15:34,872
They insisted.

1258
01:15:40,753 --> 01:15:42,337
You're a good man, John.

1259
01:15:43,714 --> 01:15:45,299
Hmm. That's fair.

1260
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,400
Hi, Richard. What's happening?

1261
01:16:03,484 --> 01:16:06,695
As we discussed, three trenches.
Maximum the budget will allow.

1262
01:16:06,779 --> 01:16:08,614
And in order to give
ourselves the best chance

1263
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:11,116
of finding one of the
walls of greyfriars,

1264
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,910
I'm gonna cut them
north to south.

1265
01:16:12,993 --> 01:16:16,413
Here. One there. And
another one over there.

1266
01:16:16,497 --> 01:16:18,999
- Trench one will start here.
- Ok.

1267
01:16:19,083 --> 01:16:22,377
And run all the
way down this way

1268
01:16:22,461 --> 01:16:26,131
to round about here.

1269
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:28,175
- To about here?
- That's right, yeah.

1270
01:16:28,258 --> 01:16:30,094
Ooh, by the way, I
meant to tell you,

1271
01:16:30,177 --> 01:16:32,012
I signed the exhumation licence.

1272
01:16:32,096 --> 01:16:34,640
The paperwork arrived at
the office this morning.

1273
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:36,809
I couldn't remember if
you had any comments.

1274
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:38,644
I just wanted to get
it out of the way.

1275
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,896
Saves a lot of fannying around.

1276
01:16:40,979 --> 01:16:43,857
Course, it's not an
issue unless we find him.

1277
01:16:43,941 --> 01:16:46,443
Er, does it matter
what end we start at?

1278
01:16:47,778 --> 01:16:50,155
Er... no.

1279
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,699
Can we start at this
end, do you think?

1280
01:16:52,783 --> 01:16:55,702
- Any particular reason?
- No.

1281
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,122
- Ok.
- Great.

1282
01:16:58,205 --> 01:17:00,874
- Groovy wellies.
- Thanks.

1283
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:06,088
(Saw whirs)

1284
01:17:17,558 --> 01:17:19,560
(Cheering)

1285
01:17:30,404 --> 01:17:32,698
(Saw whirs)

1286
01:17:59,057 --> 01:18:00,434
Philippa.

1287
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:02,436
John!

1288
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:05,230
So glad you could make it!

1289
01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:07,566
- Who's that fellow over there?
- What?

1290
01:18:09,026 --> 01:18:11,236
Oh, that's, erm...
That's Richard Taylor.

1291
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:14,489
He's from Leicester
university. Why?

1292
01:18:14,573 --> 01:18:17,159
I rather thought you were the
driving force behind this dig,

1293
01:18:17,242 --> 01:18:18,869
but from what I could hear,

1294
01:18:18,952 --> 01:18:21,330
apparently, it's all
down to the university.

1295
01:18:21,413 --> 01:18:22,748
What?

1296
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:24,833
We're very excited about
what we might find.

1297
01:18:24,917 --> 01:18:26,335
Very excited.

1298
01:18:26,418 --> 01:18:29,546
And so, with the university
leading the search,

1299
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:32,841
we can say with confidence
that if he's out there,

1300
01:18:32,925 --> 01:18:34,718
we will find him.

1301
01:18:35,385 --> 01:18:36,511
- Richard.
- Ok?

1302
01:18:36,595 --> 01:18:38,013
- (Reporter) That's great.
- Good.

1303
01:18:38,096 --> 01:18:39,806
- (Reporter) Thank you.
- What's going on?

1304
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:42,142
Just a little interview
for the university website.

1305
01:18:42,226 --> 01:18:46,230
Erm, Leicester uni isn't leading
the search for Richard. I am.

1306
01:18:47,648 --> 01:18:50,067
You put in a little bit of
funding right at the last minute

1307
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:52,152
- and that's it.
- Come on now, Philippa.

1308
01:18:52,236 --> 01:18:54,738
- We're all in this together.
- (Buckley) Philippa.

1309
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:58,951
- Excuse me.
- Hm-hmm.

1310
01:19:00,118 --> 01:19:02,204
Someone getting too big
for their fancy boots.

1311
01:19:02,287 --> 01:19:03,288
(Philippa) What is it?

1312
01:19:03,372 --> 01:19:05,374
(Buckley) Philippa, we've
found some leg bones.

1313
01:19:05,457 --> 01:19:07,042
- Leg bones?
- No feet with them.

1314
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:09,336
Just the lower legs sticking
out into the trench.

1315
01:19:09,419 --> 01:19:11,171
(Buckley) Looks like
the feet were cut off

1316
01:19:11,255 --> 01:19:13,298
when they dug down to
put in sewage pipes

1317
01:19:13,382 --> 01:19:14,800
a couple of hundred years ago.

1318
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:16,343
What about the rest of the body?

1319
01:19:16,426 --> 01:19:18,303
(Buckley) Well, if
it's a complete burial,

1320
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:20,806
it's under there
outside the trench.

1321
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:23,892
It's almost certain this whole
area is outside the church,

1322
01:19:23,976 --> 01:19:25,978
which is our focus, remember?

1323
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:30,357
Probably a friar buried in a
little adjoining graveyard.

1324
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,900
Given the budget constraints

1325
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:34,236
we're not gonna waste time
and money digging it out,

1326
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:35,946
but, er, not a bad start, eh?

1327
01:19:36,029 --> 01:19:38,824
(Thunder)

1328
01:19:49,209 --> 01:19:51,211
(Thunder)

1329
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:34,755
What's the matter?

1330
01:20:37,924 --> 01:20:39,301
I'm worried.

1331
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:41,678
What about?

1332
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:45,223
I won't find you.

1333
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:52,606
Or that I will.

1334
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:57,778
There seems to be some
excitement this morning.

1335
01:20:57,861 --> 01:21:00,489
Yes, we found the
shadow of a stone wall,

1336
01:21:00,572 --> 01:21:02,866
which could be the cloister
wall of greyfriars church

1337
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:04,451
in this trench here.

1338
01:21:04,534 --> 01:21:06,995
And once we work out the
geography of the church,

1339
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:08,747
we need to find the choir,

1340
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:12,334
because that's where they buried
important people, apparently.

1341
01:21:12,417 --> 01:21:16,463
I also believe that the
bones we found in trench one

1342
01:21:16,546 --> 01:21:18,882
could be very significant here.

1343
01:21:20,592 --> 01:21:23,887
- (Philippa) I'm so fed up.
- You're the client, Philippa.

1344
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:26,098
You're entitled to ask
for whatever you want.

1345
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:28,892
They never miss a chance
to put me in my place.

1346
01:21:28,975 --> 01:21:30,811
It's exhausting.

1347
01:21:30,894 --> 01:21:33,063
Don't let them push you around.

1348
01:21:33,146 --> 01:21:34,481
I'll try my best.

1349
01:21:34,564 --> 01:21:35,857
Thanks, John.

1350
01:21:35,941 --> 01:21:37,567
We're all thinking of you here.

1351
01:21:37,651 --> 01:21:39,945
Stay strong and chin
up, eh? Bye-bye.

1352
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:41,154
Bye, love.

1353
01:21:48,578 --> 01:21:51,248
This looks really promising.

1354
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:56,420
I think this trench cuts across
the east end of the church.

1355
01:21:56,503 --> 01:21:59,339
So we are pretty close
to the choir here.

1356
01:21:59,423 --> 01:22:02,050
If we keep working
in this direction,

1357
01:22:02,134 --> 01:22:03,593
- give it another...
- Richard.

1358
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:08,056
- Can I have a word, please?
- Of course.

1359
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:10,058
I want to exhume the
rest of the remains

1360
01:22:10,142 --> 01:22:11,685
in trench one, please.

1361
01:22:11,768 --> 01:22:13,145
Philippa, I've already told you,

1362
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:15,689
those are almost certainly
the remains of a friar.

1363
01:22:15,772 --> 01:22:18,066
I don't think there's any
doubt about it, Richard.

1364
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:19,985
The depth they're buried at,

1365
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:21,945
and they're too far
west to be in the choir.

1366
01:22:22,028 --> 01:22:24,573
- I agree.
- I want to dig him up, please.

1367
01:22:24,656 --> 01:22:26,116
I've stuck my neck out for you

1368
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:30,287
because till now, I felt your
research was sound and thorough.

1369
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:31,580
I think it's him.

1370
01:22:31,663 --> 01:22:34,082
Don't you think you've
become fixated on these bones

1371
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:37,294
just because they were the
first ones we discovered?

1372
01:22:37,377 --> 01:22:41,339
What if that is part of
the choir, hmm? Over there?

1373
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:43,341
What if you're
wrong and it is him?

1374
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:45,510
Myself and all
the professionals,

1375
01:22:45,594 --> 01:22:47,179
the assembled academics

1376
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:49,598
all say concentrate
here in trench three,

1377
01:22:49,681 --> 01:22:51,892
but you say, "no, let's
concentrate over there,"

1378
01:22:51,975 --> 01:22:55,020
because that's where you think
he is. Do you see my problem?

1379
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:57,230
I want to exhume the
rest of those bones!

1380
01:22:57,314 --> 01:22:58,899
We can't. We don't
have the money to!

1381
01:22:58,982 --> 01:23:02,903
I've got about £800 left in
the fund. Will that cover it?

1382
01:23:07,032 --> 01:23:08,116
I suppose so.

1383
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,161
Well, can you just
do it then? Please.

1384
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:18,877
Jo, dig out the
remains in trench one.

1385
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,795
- Really?
- Yes, really.

1386
01:23:20,879 --> 01:23:23,340
She's paying for it. Let's
give her what she wants.

1387
01:23:23,423 --> 01:23:24,925
I'm going home.

1388
01:23:42,692 --> 01:23:44,528
(Philippa) I can't bear it.

1389
01:23:47,781 --> 01:23:49,407
I'm going for a walk.

1390
01:24:30,282 --> 01:24:31,825
Fancy a brew, Jo?

1391
01:24:35,954 --> 01:24:37,455
Hello, Jo?

1392
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:49,884
(Sighs)

1393
01:24:53,096 --> 01:24:55,557
(Horse snorts)

1394
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,392
(Phone buzzes)

1395
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:03,565
(Gasps)

1396
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:08,111
(Horse whinnies)

1397
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:12,157
(Gasps)

1398
01:25:25,503 --> 01:25:26,546
Wait.

1399
01:25:34,471 --> 01:25:35,555
Wait!

1400
01:26:22,894 --> 01:26:25,063
(Breathes heavily)

1401
01:26:50,964 --> 01:26:53,341
There's a wound to the skull.

1402
01:26:53,425 --> 01:26:55,093
It's not visible
from the surface,

1403
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:57,846
but when you turn it over,
you can see a slicing blow

1404
01:26:57,929 --> 01:26:59,973
that has taken
some skull with it.

1405
01:27:00,056 --> 01:27:02,100
It would have killed
him almost instantly.

1406
01:27:02,183 --> 01:27:04,602
"Killed the boar,
shaved his head."

1407
01:27:04,686 --> 01:27:06,312
That's a Welsh
poet's description

1408
01:27:06,396 --> 01:27:08,940
of the death of Richard
from the 15th century.

1409
01:27:09,649 --> 01:27:11,776
Richard's personal
emblem was a boar.

1410
01:27:12,902 --> 01:27:15,905
It's the body of an adult male,

1411
01:27:15,989 --> 01:27:19,075
aged somewhere
between 20 and 40.

1412
01:27:19,159 --> 01:27:20,785
Richard was 32.

1413
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:22,912
(Jo) But there's something else.

1414
01:27:25,331 --> 01:27:27,876
I've just been excavating
the spinal column,

1415
01:27:27,959 --> 01:27:32,714
and if you look at it along
here, it's unmistakable.

1416
01:27:33,631 --> 01:27:36,551
There's an abnormal curvature.

1417
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:40,889
Hello.

1418
01:27:44,934 --> 01:27:47,812
(Jo) These remains are
those of a hunchback.

1419
01:27:52,609 --> 01:27:55,069
Tudor apologists will
have a field day.

1420
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:00,116
It doesn't matter.

1421
01:28:03,578 --> 01:28:04,913
He's perfect.

1422
01:28:49,374 --> 01:28:51,251
(Woman) They're calling
you from the dig.

1423
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:53,962
They're saying to tell you...

1424
01:28:55,505 --> 01:28:58,258
Trauma to the skull
and a curved spine.

1425
01:29:00,176 --> 01:29:02,095
(Dog barks)

1426
01:29:05,723 --> 01:29:07,392
(Tyres screech)

1427
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:16,484
Of course, it's not certain
that this is Richard.

1428
01:29:16,568 --> 01:29:19,529
There are still DNA tests and
so forth to be carried out.

1429
01:29:19,612 --> 01:29:23,032
But I'm struck peering
down at the mortal remains

1430
01:29:23,116 --> 01:29:26,578
that this is a person, a
father, a brother, a son.

1431
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:28,621
Philippa, could we
have a word with you?

1432
01:29:28,705 --> 01:29:30,498
- Yes, of course. Erm...
- (Phone rings)

1433
01:29:30,582 --> 01:29:33,626
Oh, gosh, I'm so
sorry. Hold on, erm...

1434
01:29:34,711 --> 01:29:36,754
I've really got to take
this. I'm sorry, John.

1435
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:38,047
Anything to add, sir?

1436
01:29:38,131 --> 01:29:39,841
It's a testimony
to the research...

1437
01:29:39,924 --> 01:29:41,426
- John?
- Hey.

1438
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:44,053
I just wondered how
everything was going.

1439
01:29:44,137 --> 01:29:46,139
John, you're not
gonna believe this.

1440
01:29:46,222 --> 01:29:48,600
Where the hell is Buckley?

1441
01:29:52,353 --> 01:29:53,563
Found him.

1442
01:29:55,023 --> 01:29:56,649
(Crowd noise on video game)

1443
01:29:57,650 --> 01:29:59,569
- Boys. Boys! Boys.
- What are you doing?

1444
01:29:59,652 --> 01:30:02,405
Your mum, your mother's
just found Richard III.

1445
01:30:02,488 --> 01:30:05,366
- Kingfinder!
- Yeah!

1446
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:06,826
(Boys cheer)

1447
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:08,661
(Max) Yes, mum! I
knew you could do it!

1448
01:30:08,745 --> 01:30:10,288
(Raife) Well done, mum!

1449
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:11,748
Listen, I've got to go.

1450
01:30:11,831 --> 01:30:14,208
- I love you lots, all of you.
- (Max) Love you too.

1451
01:30:14,292 --> 01:30:16,169
Very much.

1452
01:30:19,005 --> 01:30:20,548
He's here. He's here.

1453
01:30:26,262 --> 01:30:29,432
- Where were you?
- I was... busy.

1454
01:30:29,515 --> 01:30:30,850
Is it definitely him?

1455
01:30:30,934 --> 01:30:32,769
Well, I don't think
there's any doubt.

1456
01:30:32,852 --> 01:30:35,438
You've bloody missed it all.
We're playing catch-up now.

1457
01:30:35,521 --> 01:30:37,357
Vice chancellor's
here. Vice chancellor.

1458
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,816
- Could you just...?
- Oh, yeah.

1459
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,360
What do you mean, "we"?

1460
01:30:40,443 --> 01:30:42,987
The university
withdrew my funding.

1461
01:30:43,071 --> 01:30:45,448
It's a very fluid situation.

1462
01:30:45,531 --> 01:30:47,992
- Mr burgess.
- Things can change very rapidly.

1463
01:30:48,076 --> 01:30:49,911
Are changing very rapidly.

1464
01:30:51,287 --> 01:30:53,915
Will change. Mr burgess.

1465
01:30:53,998 --> 01:30:56,250
Philippa! I just
can't believe it!

1466
01:30:56,334 --> 01:30:59,504
He was right where I said
he'd be, in trench one.

1467
01:30:59,587 --> 01:31:01,547
- You went with your feelings?
- I did.

1468
01:31:01,631 --> 01:31:03,633
Oh, god!

1469
01:31:03,716 --> 01:31:05,259
Thank you!

1470
01:31:05,343 --> 01:31:06,552
Who's that?

1471
01:31:06,636 --> 01:31:08,262
(Sighs) Right,
that's Bob burgess.

1472
01:31:08,346 --> 01:31:09,597
He's the vice chancellor.

1473
01:31:09,681 --> 01:31:12,100
The university have got their
big guns here double quick.

1474
01:31:12,183 --> 01:31:13,267
That's nice.

1475
01:31:13,351 --> 01:31:15,770
Archaeology department, the
university of Leicester.

1476
01:31:15,853 --> 01:31:17,605
Look, you have no
idea the impact

1477
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:19,732
that this is gonna
have on the city!

1478
01:31:19,816 --> 01:31:22,485
How he famously promised
his kingdom for a horse.

1479
01:31:22,568 --> 01:31:25,321
But what happened to the
body of king Richard III

1480
01:31:25,405 --> 01:31:27,115
after his defeat at
the battle of bosworth

1481
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:29,367
has remained a mystery
for more than 500 years.

1482
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:31,327
Until now. Maybe.

1483
01:31:31,411 --> 01:31:34,288
(Speaks Russian)

1484
01:31:34,372 --> 01:31:36,916
(Speaks Italian)

1485
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:39,544
They believe they've
uncovered the remains

1486
01:31:39,627 --> 01:31:41,170
of long-lost royalty.

1487
01:31:41,254 --> 01:31:43,756
He happens to be
king Richard III.

1488
01:31:55,268 --> 01:31:59,230
- Richard. Hi.
- Philippa. Hi. Excited?

1489
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:00,356
Nervous.

1490
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:02,775
So how's it gonna work
today? Who says what?

1491
01:32:02,859 --> 01:32:05,987
Leicester uni have a whole
running order worked out.

1492
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:08,156
- Did they not consult you?
- No.

1493
01:32:09,532 --> 01:32:10,825
So who's chairing it?

1494
01:32:13,286 --> 01:32:14,912
- What?
- We'd better get inside.

1495
01:32:23,254 --> 01:32:26,716
(Taylor) Having received the
results of the DNA analysis,

1496
01:32:26,799 --> 01:32:29,260
I now call upon Richard Buckley,

1497
01:32:29,343 --> 01:32:31,888
the lead archaeologist
of this project,

1498
01:32:31,971 --> 01:32:35,641
to deliver today's
astonishing announcement

1499
01:32:35,725 --> 01:32:39,228
from the university of
Leicester. Thank you.

1500
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,440
(Clears throat)

1501
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:46,736
The glare of worldwide publicity
has not detracted in any way

1502
01:32:46,819 --> 01:32:50,364
from our intent and purpose to
conduct world-class research

1503
01:32:50,448 --> 01:32:51,783
on our discovery,

1504
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:55,328
which is a hallmark of the
university of Leicester.

1505
01:32:57,163 --> 01:32:58,873
Ladies and gentlemen,

1506
01:32:58,956 --> 01:33:02,460
it is the academic conclusion
of the university of Leicester

1507
01:33:02,543 --> 01:33:04,879
that beyond reasonable doubt,

1508
01:33:04,962 --> 01:33:07,423
the individual
exhumed at greyfriars

1509
01:33:07,507 --> 01:33:10,301
on the 5th of September 2012...

1510
01:33:11,636 --> 01:33:15,723
Is indeed king Richard
III, son of York,

1511
01:33:15,807 --> 01:33:18,434
the last plantagenet
king of england.

1512
01:33:18,518 --> 01:33:20,520
(Cheering)

1513
01:33:36,452 --> 01:33:38,913
Well done. Well done.

1514
01:33:38,996 --> 01:33:41,874
Philippa should have been
up on that podium with us.

1515
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:45,086
Don't go off-piste. The
world's press is here.

1516
01:33:45,169 --> 01:33:48,256
It's about putting you and the
university front and centre.

1517
01:33:48,339 --> 01:33:50,800
At least I've got the
good grace to feel guilty.

1518
01:33:50,883 --> 01:33:51,884
(Taylor) Now, now.

1519
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:57,181
(Sighs) Must dash.

1520
01:34:04,313 --> 01:34:07,650
Philippa. How are you? Sorry
about the, er, seating.

1521
01:34:07,733 --> 01:34:09,443
You haven't responded
to my emails.

1522
01:34:09,527 --> 01:34:10,945
What's happening
with the burial?

1523
01:34:11,028 --> 01:34:13,447
Oh, the tomb? Have
you seen the design?

1524
01:34:13,531 --> 01:34:15,658
Very striking. I'll get
them to email it to you.

1525
01:34:15,741 --> 01:34:18,202
It needs to have a royal
coat of arms on it.

1526
01:34:18,286 --> 01:34:19,328
That's very important.

1527
01:34:19,412 --> 01:34:21,455
It's a proper acknowledgement
of who he was.

1528
01:34:21,539 --> 01:34:22,832
- A sign of respect.
- Yeah.

1529
01:34:22,915 --> 01:34:25,293
I think this was discussed
by the burial committee,

1530
01:34:25,376 --> 01:34:27,587
and they didn't think
that a coat of arms

1531
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:30,506
- is the correct protocol here.
- Sorry, why not?

1532
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:32,675
The committee felt that
the physical evidence

1533
01:34:32,758 --> 01:34:34,760
gathered from the dig, the...

1534
01:34:34,844 --> 01:34:37,013
Hunch spine and so on,

1535
01:34:37,096 --> 01:34:39,182
does tend to support
the historical view

1536
01:34:39,265 --> 01:34:41,475
that Richard was a usurper.

1537
01:34:41,559 --> 01:34:44,312
Richard. Benedict cumberbatch
has agreed to do a reading

1538
01:34:44,395 --> 01:34:46,814
- at the re-internment!
- Oh, that is...

1539
01:34:46,898 --> 01:34:48,274
- That's a goal!
- (Both laugh)

1540
01:34:48,357 --> 01:34:50,026
Benedict cumberbatch.

1541
01:34:51,194 --> 01:34:52,904
Tell Tom I'll be
there in a minute.

1542
01:34:52,987 --> 01:34:54,113
Yeah.

1543
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:57,241
I was tied up all yesterday

1544
01:34:57,325 --> 01:34:58,993
on what to put on
the souvenir bars

1545
01:34:59,076 --> 01:35:01,162
of the Richard III chocolate.

1546
01:35:01,245 --> 01:35:04,582
Be shot glasses and
bookmarks tomorrow.

1547
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:08,544
Welcome to my world. Ok.

1548
01:35:15,051 --> 01:35:18,763
- He was not a usurper.
- (Taylor sighs)

1549
01:35:18,846 --> 01:35:21,098
And the diagnosis was scoliosis,

1550
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:23,893
curvature of the
spine. Not a hunchback.

1551
01:35:23,976 --> 01:35:26,854
Well, the committee
felt that the condition,

1552
01:35:26,938 --> 01:35:30,483
or whatever its precise
label, does suggest

1553
01:35:30,566 --> 01:35:31,651
that there is more truth

1554
01:35:31,734 --> 01:35:33,819
to Shakespeare's account
of Richard's life

1555
01:35:33,903 --> 01:35:37,281
than perhaps you
and your supporters

1556
01:35:37,365 --> 01:35:38,699
would like to admit to.

1557
01:35:43,162 --> 01:35:47,458
So twisted spine equals
twisted personality, does it?

1558
01:35:48,834 --> 01:35:51,087
No, no, no. (Chuckles)

1559
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:53,464
That's not what the
committee is saying.

1560
01:35:53,547 --> 01:35:56,634
It's... it's...
Let's just calm down.

1561
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:59,053
He was a legitimate king.

1562
01:35:59,136 --> 01:36:02,807
And his right to a royal
coat of arms on his tomb

1563
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:04,684
is unarguable.

1564
01:36:04,767 --> 01:36:07,728
I will fight you all the
way on this, Richard.

1565
01:36:10,523 --> 01:36:12,024
Well, the decision of the burial

1566
01:36:12,108 --> 01:36:14,860
rests with the holder of
the exhumation licence,

1567
01:36:14,944 --> 01:36:18,823
which through Richard Buckley,
is the university of Leicester.

1568
01:36:19,824 --> 01:36:21,284
I thought you fired him.

1569
01:36:21,367 --> 01:36:23,619
We reinstated him.

1570
01:36:23,703 --> 01:36:26,122
And we've awarded
him a doctorate.

1571
01:36:26,205 --> 01:36:27,832
(Philippa) When did that happen?

1572
01:36:27,915 --> 01:36:29,667
Quite recently.

1573
01:36:31,919 --> 01:36:35,047
I specified a royal coat of arms

1574
01:36:35,131 --> 01:36:37,925
as a condition of his reburial.

1575
01:36:38,009 --> 01:36:39,927
But Richard Buckley
didn't include it

1576
01:36:40,011 --> 01:36:41,470
on the exhumation licence.

1577
01:36:41,554 --> 01:36:44,015
Well, that is unfortunate...

1578
01:36:45,141 --> 01:36:46,726
For you.

1579
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:53,107
Sorry.

1580
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:02,742
(Girl) Excuse me.

1581
01:37:03,826 --> 01:37:05,286
Are you Philippa?

1582
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:07,705
Yes.

1583
01:37:07,788 --> 01:37:09,623
Would you come and give
a talk to our school

1584
01:37:09,707 --> 01:37:11,500
about finding
Richard III, please?

1585
01:37:12,418 --> 01:37:14,587
Oh, that's very flattering.

1586
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:16,255
What made you come and ask me?

1587
01:37:16,339 --> 01:37:18,007
That man over there.

1588
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:20,760
He told us that you
were the one to talk to.

1589
01:37:22,136 --> 01:37:23,512
Did he?

1590
01:37:27,933 --> 01:37:30,353
Well, I'm sure we can
arrange something.

1591
01:37:56,712 --> 01:37:58,964
(Horse neighs)

1592
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:20,236
All I ever wanted
was to find you...

1593
01:38:21,695 --> 01:38:24,615
And show everyone you were
always the rightful king.

1594
01:38:28,786 --> 01:38:30,996
But they're taking you
away from me again.

1595
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:33,791
Why don't you say what
you came here to say?

1596
01:38:37,753 --> 01:38:39,922
I don't want to let you go.

1597
01:38:40,005 --> 01:38:41,632
You know the truth.

1598
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:44,635
Nothing else matters.

1599
01:38:47,972 --> 01:38:49,390
Goodbye.

1600
01:38:54,186 --> 01:38:55,604
Thank you, Philippa.

1601
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:58,190
You're welcome.

1602
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:00,085
(Choir sings)

1603
01:40:41,835 --> 01:40:44,547
Hmm. I'm surprised
to see him here.

1604
01:40:45,339 --> 01:40:47,383
He must've joined the fan club.

1605
01:40:47,466 --> 01:40:49,009
(Chuckles)

1606
01:40:57,643 --> 01:40:59,562
- Philippa.
- Oh, hi.

1607
01:41:00,729 --> 01:41:02,231
It's dr Buckley now, is it?

1608
01:41:02,314 --> 01:41:03,816
Oh, no, that's
just for, you know,

1609
01:41:03,899 --> 01:41:06,193
business cards
and stuff. Silly.

1610
01:41:06,277 --> 01:41:08,028
Are you going to the
big banquet later?

1611
01:41:08,112 --> 01:41:11,657
I made sure you got an invite.
I've gotta go and change.

1612
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:14,535
I'll save you a place at the
top table. I'll see you later.

1613
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:21,417
(Girl) Where's mummy?

1614
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,752
- (Man) I don't know, bubba.
- Richard?

1615
01:41:25,296 --> 01:41:29,216
Erm... no, i'm... I'm
Pete. Have we met?

1616
01:41:31,385 --> 01:41:32,886
I'm so sorry, it's my mistake.

1617
01:41:32,970 --> 01:41:34,805
- You're an actor, aren't you?
- Yes.

1618
01:41:34,888 --> 01:41:36,890
I saw you play
Richard in Edinburgh.

1619
01:41:36,974 --> 01:41:39,310
Oh, right. Yeah, well,
we thought we'd come down

1620
01:41:39,393 --> 01:41:41,186
- and see him off.
- Right.

1621
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:43,939
I have to say, you
played him beautifully.

1622
01:41:44,023 --> 01:41:45,107
(Pete) Oh.

1623
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:47,026
Your performance,
it really, erm...

1624
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:50,904
Stayed with me.

1625
01:41:51,572 --> 01:41:53,824
Thank you very much.
That's... thanks.

1626
01:41:53,907 --> 01:41:55,117
(Girl) Where's mummy gone?

1627
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:58,120
Erm, I think we better
go and find mummy.

1628
01:41:58,203 --> 01:41:59,747
Er, very nice to meet you.

1629
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:01,624
- Philippa.
- Philippa.

1630
01:42:01,707 --> 01:42:02,958
- Say bye.
- Bye!

1631
01:42:03,042 --> 01:42:04,335
- Bye, love!
- Have a nice day!

1632
01:42:04,418 --> 01:42:05,753
You too.

1633
01:42:29,985 --> 01:42:31,153
(Both chuckle)

1634
01:42:50,089 --> 01:42:52,299
(Applause)

1635
01:43:09,566 --> 01:43:13,320
Hello. My name is
Philippa Langley.

1636
01:43:13,404 --> 01:43:15,197
And I'm here today
to tell you a story

1637
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:19,743
about a person who was
judged unfairly in life

1638
01:43:19,827 --> 01:43:24,164
and never given the opportunity
to show their true potential.

1639
01:44:05,205 --> 01:44:06,707
Thank you.

1639
01:44:07,305 --> 01:45:07,486
