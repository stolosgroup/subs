3
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,558
Everything looks so
beautiful from up here.

4
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:50,064
I'll say.

5
00:02:57,204 --> 00:02:59,775
I've been thinking
about you all week.

6
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,042
Can't get you out of my mind.

7
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:05,579
I've been
thinking about you too.

8
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,453
God, you're amazing.

9
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:14,555
You know that?

10
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:18,727
What's wrong?

11
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,327
It's just,

12
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:23,431
you deserve more than this.

13
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:25,166
This moment right here...

14
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:28,335
This is all I need.

15
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:30,004
Tom...

16
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:35,943
I'm sorry...

17
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:38,546
I... I can't.

18
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,947
It's OK.

19
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,549
<i>It's OK.</i>

20
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:53,561
Emma, you gotta talk to me?

21
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:02,704
This isn't gonna work.

22
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:06,073
We can't do this
any more.

23
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:10,478
Listen.

24
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:17,051
I know this is not how we
expected things to go.

25
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:21,121
But, I...

26
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:24,291
I really care about you.

27
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:30,231
You can't say you don't
feel the same way about me.

28
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:35,704
How I feel doesn't matter.

29
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:39,741
Emma?

30
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:41,175
Emma, wait!

31
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,577
Look, just meet with me
tomorrow!

32
00:04:44,278 --> 00:04:46,380
I don't want this to be the
last time I see you.

33
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,751
We can't.

34
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:51,619
Why?

35
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:58,693
Because it's my anniversary.

36
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:05,199
I'm sorry.

37
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,501
It's over.

38
00:05:53,414 --> 00:05:55,050
Mark Webster's office.

39
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:56,651
Please hold.

40
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:58,920
Happy anniversary Mrs. Webster.

41
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:01,088
Oh, they're beautiful!
Thank you.

42
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:03,725
Thanks for
waiting. How can I help?

43
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:06,527
No, I've already stated
that we have no comment.

44
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,731
Mark Webster's office.

45
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:03,118
Thanks Selena.

46
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,822
Hello pumpkin.

47
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:10,692
I thought you were going
to wear the red dress?

48
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:15,462
You know that's my favorite.

49
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:16,965
I know.

50
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:18,667
I just thought that,

51
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,300
maybe we could try something a
little different.

52
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:21,803
It's okay.

53
00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:24,939
There's still time to stop
by the apartment and change.

54
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:28,810
What's that?

55
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:30,177
Nothing.

56
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:37,852
Emma?

57
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:39,954
You know that's only going
to trigger your anxiety.

58
00:07:42,222 --> 00:07:43,758
I'm, sorry...

59
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,028
What are you doing
with my file?

60
00:07:47,662 --> 00:07:49,596
They're revoking his
parole.

61
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:52,266
Don't you wish you were
still putting guys like that

62
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,601
in jail instead of
keeping them out?

63
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:01,442
I don't miss living out of
a shoebox

64
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:03,410
in Birmingham, wearing
cheap suits.

65
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:06,480
And I don't miss doing
everyone else's dirty work.

66
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:10,885
Up here everyone else does
the dirty work for me.

67
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,490
Do you know what I do miss
though?

68
00:08:21,062 --> 00:08:23,297
I miss that care-free girl.

69
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:27,702
One of the few photos I have of
you, in front of the camera.

70
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:30,638
What was she thinking?

71
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:34,109
I don't remember.

72
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:52,526
Tom.

73
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:53,762
Sir.

74
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:58,265
- Pardon me.
- You've met my wife?

75
00:08:58,398 --> 00:09:00,635
Haven't you?

76
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:02,837
I don't think so?

77
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:06,007
Emma. This is Tom Gorman.

78
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:08,575
We met at the Christmas
party last year, actually.

79
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:11,012
That's right. You auctioned
off some of your photographs

80
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:12,747
you took for charity.

81
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:14,883
- They were stunning.
- Now, now.

82
00:09:15,415 --> 00:09:17,919
You both know it wasn't the
Christmas party.

83
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:23,124
It was the "Holiday" party.

84
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:25,459
That's where you found the
"P.C" police.

85
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:28,963
Much on for the weekend?

86
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,934
Just paperwork...

87
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:44,712
Emma... darling?

88
00:09:44,846 --> 00:09:45,880
Yes?

89
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:48,817
I drove...

90
00:09:49,316 --> 00:09:50,652
Right...

91
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:52,787
Nice to meet you again.

92
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:55,690
Monday.

93
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:00,695
Now that, was,

94
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:01,628
delicious.

95
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:07,168
Would you
like some dessert?

96
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:08,870
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

97
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,738
How's the Gâteau le
creme?

98
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:12,006
It's to die for.

99
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,174
Perfect.

100
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,009
We'll take two.

101
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,211
Of course.

102
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:25,753
I thought we weren't doing
gifts?

103
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:28,089
I wanted to surprise you
tonight.

104
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,930
They say diamonds are a
girl's best friend.

105
00:10:36,463 --> 00:10:37,632
But 11 years...

106
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:40,668
apparently makes it
our steel anniversary.

107
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:43,004
So, I had this specially-made.

108
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:45,673
It's beautiful.

109
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:48,643
Thank you.

110
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:50,544
Try it on?

111
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:52,546
Oh my god!

112
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:58,385
Bravo!

113
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,825
That was you not so long ago.

114
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:08,162
Hey!

115
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,031
You still with us?

116
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:12,033
Yeah.

117
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:21,142
I thought we weren't doing
gifts?

118
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:26,114
Super Bowl?

119
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:27,949
It's the 50-yard
line. You did always say that

120
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:30,450
you wanted to go and I
thought that maybe this year...

121
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:32,787
The <i>Steelers</i> would be in it?

122
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,856
Not a chance.

123
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:37,859
They suck this year.
Unlike 4 and 12.

124
00:11:39,593 --> 00:11:41,062
Let me.

125
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:04,719
Happy anniversary pumpkin.

126
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:46,493
Are you okay?

127
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:48,528
Yeah, I'm fine.

128
00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:53,434
I know it, is none of my
business.

129
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:54,736
And...

130
00:12:55,003 --> 00:12:56,570
I know that you feel
like you just made

131
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:58,473
a huge commitment out there.

132
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,975
But I just want you to
understand that nothing

133
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:02,176
is set in stone.

134
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:06,647
Yeah, you're right! It's
none of your business...

135
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:08,783
No, I...

136
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,550
I know you're right...

137
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:12,220
I'm sorry.

138
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:19,894
Congratulations.

139
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,178
Thank you.

140
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,840
Before we head on home,
there's one final surprise babe.

141
00:14:06,374 --> 00:14:07,842
Check your pockets.

142
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,347
Can you please just tell
me where we're going?

143
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:47,982
No.

144
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,751
We're almost there. I promise.

145
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:51,986
You've been saying that
for an hour.

146
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,821
Yeah, but this time, I mean it.

147
00:14:54,122 --> 00:14:57,258
Just, try have some fun
would you? C'mon.

148
00:14:57,825 --> 00:15:01,329
Being blindfolded for over an hour
really isn't my idea of fun.

149
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,731
It was when we first got
married.

150
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:20,281
I'm not, I'm not doing this, I
can't do it.

151
00:15:20,414 --> 00:15:22,183
I feel car sick. I'm
taking it off, I don't...

152
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,019
Stop.

153
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:30,358
You're gonna ruin the surprise.

154
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:34,929
Mark...

155
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,331
I really don't know

156
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:38,733
what kind of weird game
you're playing,

157
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:40,768
but I don't want
to fool around.

158
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:55,750
Mark!

159
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:01,956
Mark? Mark, where are we going?

160
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:10,231
Lake House?

161
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:12,600
Surprise!

162
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:15,469
I had them prepare it for
us today.

163
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:19,207
It looks so strange in the
winter.

164
00:16:24,245 --> 00:16:27,081
We have a lot of happy
memories here.

165
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:29,150
I thought maybe we could...

166
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:31,886
rekindle some of them.

167
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,241
...75, 76,

168
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:56,944
77, 78,

169
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:00,381
79...

170
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:01,882
Fuck it!

171
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:30,411
"<i>I love you with</i>
<i>all of my heart."</i>

172
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:32,213
<i>"Till death do us part."</i>

173
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:22,383
Took you long enough.

174
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:26,020
You know, it's really not fair.

175
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:28,122
What?

176
00:20:28,456 --> 00:20:31,325
How you just get
more beautiful as you get older.

177
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:36,430
Well... I started out very ugly.

178
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:38,599
Hm...

179
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:07,762
Emma!

180
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:10,264
I know...

181
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:14,301
that things have been bad
between us.

182
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,570
Been bad for a while.

183
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:19,741
And I'm sorry.

184
00:21:21,075 --> 00:21:22,878
You've been through so much.

185
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,613
And I haven't been a good
husband.

186
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:30,351
I know one stupid
anniversary surprise

187
00:21:30,484 --> 00:21:32,152
isn't gonna fix everything.

188
00:21:34,723 --> 00:21:36,390
But it's a start.

189
00:21:39,493 --> 00:21:41,562
We owe it that much, don't we?

190
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:04,511
Oh my god, it's freezing!

191
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:06,948
Oh!

192
00:23:07,082 --> 00:23:08,950
Morning, sweetheart.

193
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,318
How are you feeling?

194
00:23:12,854 --> 00:23:14,188
Hungover.

195
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:21,595
Did you dream beautiful things?

196
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,872
What the fuck is this?

197
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:34,575
What is this!

198
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:38,212
Mark?

199
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,915
Mark?

200
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:46,788
It's time to wake up.

201
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,623
Help!

202
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:15,777
Please.

203
00:26:11,465 --> 00:26:12,767
Ugh!

204
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,772
Hmm!

205
00:27:59,473 --> 00:28:01,042
Ugh.

206
00:28:28,303 --> 00:28:29,337
Ow.

207
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:39,807
Oh no!

208
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:49,984
Fuck.

209
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:53,788
Oh, come on!

210
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:54,822
Come on!

211
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,992
Please! Please, please!

212
00:30:01,396 --> 00:30:02,296
Yes!

213
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:05,233
No...

214
00:30:05,366 --> 00:30:06,334
No.

215
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:07,402
No! No! No!

216
00:30:07,534 --> 00:30:10,138
No! No! Fuck!

217
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:45,306
Keys!

218
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,573
Fuck yes!

219
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:14,762
Oh!

220
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:37,385
I thought you would be
lighter without all that blood.

221
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:41,789
Okay.

222
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,659
Oh, come on.

223
00:32:43,891 --> 00:32:45,793
Come on. Come on.

224
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:48,696
Yes!

225
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:02,109
No! No! No...

226
00:33:02,476 --> 00:33:03,778
Fuck!

227
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:10,184
Motherfucker.

228
00:33:11,586 --> 00:33:12,987
Why!

229
00:33:21,963 --> 00:33:24,465
Our wedding
song, remember?

230
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,271
<i>I have to admit.</i>

231
00:33:30,404 --> 00:33:32,641
<i>I'm impressed you made it this
far.</i>

232
00:33:33,608 --> 00:33:35,509
<i>You should have knelt at my
feet,</i>

233
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:37,578
<i>after everything I did for you.</i>

234
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:40,848
<i>When I met you, you were
nothing.</i>

235
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:44,118
<i>A failed photographer
with no money, no hope.</i>

236
00:33:44,518 --> 00:33:46,220
<i>My only regret,</i>

237
00:33:46,354 --> 00:33:48,956
<i>is not being there to see the
look on your face right now.</i>

238
00:33:50,858 --> 00:33:53,160
<i>I don't want to give you
the satisfaction of thinking</i>

239
00:33:53,294 --> 00:33:56,764
<i>I put a bullet in my head
because of your disobedience...</i>

240
00:33:57,633 --> 00:33:59,400
<i>But I was being called away</i>

241
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:02,069
<i>and I couldn't just sit back</i>

242
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:04,605
<i>and watch you live happily
ever after...</i>

243
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,507
<i>with him.</i>

244
00:34:06,907 --> 00:34:09,243
<i>Happy anniversary,
pumpkin.</i>

245
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:17,878
Oh fuck!

246
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,381
Argh!

247
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:22,850
Ugh!

248
00:35:24,385 --> 00:35:25,986
No!

249
00:36:18,774 --> 00:36:20,040
Fuck!

250
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:36,658
You can do this!

251
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:40,995
I can do this!

252
00:37:05,419 --> 00:37:06,353
Ow!

253
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:11,625
You fucking hypocrite!

254
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:16,197
How many fucking times did
I wash lipstick

255
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,400
and glitter off of your
fucking <i>shirts!</i>

256
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:47,929
I was dragging around that
lifeless corpse of yours,

257
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:52,266
long before you put a bullet
in that deranged head of yours.

258
00:37:54,201 --> 00:37:56,103
You just didn't know it yet.

259
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,068
I'm gonna cut myself free
of you,

260
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:30,739
if it's the last thing I do.

261
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,324
Ow.

262
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:41,036
<i>It's
11:26am. July 2nd.</i>

263
00:40:41,435 --> 00:40:43,470
<i>I'm the Assistant District
Attorney</i>

264
00:40:43,604 --> 00:40:46,240
<i>and will be personally
overseeing your case</i>

265
00:40:47,742 --> 00:40:50,779
<i>I know you're weak and
tired, but we need you</i>

266
00:40:50,912 --> 00:40:54,314
<i>to tell us everything
about the attack last night?</i>

267
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,553
<i>He came
out of the shadows and he...</i>

268
00:41:00,587 --> 00:41:03,725
<i>And he ripped the camera
out of my... hands.</i>

269
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:07,327
<i>I made a... a run for it.</i>

270
00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:10,799
<i>I tried to run and then
that's when I felt um...</i>

271
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:14,234
<i>the, the knife.</i>

272
00:41:15,502 --> 00:41:18,973
<i>Um... I... I went to
scream for help, but...</i>

273
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,541
<i>It's okay.</i>

274
00:41:22,276 --> 00:41:25,714
<i>The detective mentioned
you... injured your attacker.</i>

275
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:29,316
<i>My keys, um... I had... I
had my keys,</i>

276
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,052
<i>clenched in my fist and um...</i>

277
00:41:33,822 --> 00:41:35,724
<i>That's the last thing that
I remember.</i>

278
00:41:36,024 --> 00:41:40,227
<i>Hey! You're safe now.
You're safe, I promise.</i>

279
00:41:41,295 --> 00:41:43,363
<i>We're apprehended...</i>

280
00:41:43,965 --> 00:41:45,499
Fuck!

281
00:42:38,953 --> 00:42:40,420
No!

282
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:43,825
Ah!

283
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,761
- Ah.
- Tom?

284
00:42:47,128 --> 00:42:48,529
I think you broke my nose.

285
00:42:49,563 --> 00:42:51,532
What are you doing here?

286
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:52,834
You gotta be kidding me right?

287
00:42:53,268 --> 00:42:56,503
Does "I fucked up and I
need your help" ring a bell?

288
00:42:56,638 --> 00:42:58,740
What? The message you sent me.

289
00:42:59,707 --> 00:43:01,542
Tom I didn't send you a message.

290
00:43:01,776 --> 00:43:03,310
Do you have any idea the
shit-storm your husband's caused

291
00:43:03,443 --> 00:43:05,647
back at the office?

292
00:43:08,183 --> 00:43:09,550
Is that blood on your shirt?

293
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,353
Oh Tom...

294
00:43:14,189 --> 00:43:16,456
Mark sent you those messages.

295
00:43:19,127 --> 00:43:20,394
Is he here?

296
00:43:24,265 --> 00:43:26,034
Most of him.

297
00:43:26,935 --> 00:43:28,102
What do you mean?

298
00:43:37,377 --> 00:43:39,346
Jesus fucking Christ.

299
00:43:40,248 --> 00:43:41,916
Mark shot himself.

300
00:43:42,382 --> 00:43:44,351
He what? What the fuck happened?

301
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:46,486
He handcuffed himself to
me and then he shot

302
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,422
himself in the head.

303
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,357
Is it because of us?

304
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:53,127
I'm pretty sure it was
because he was insane.

305
00:43:56,898 --> 00:43:57,932
Okay...

306
00:44:01,035 --> 00:44:02,103
Okay.

307
00:44:03,972 --> 00:44:07,809
Have you, uh... should we...
cover his...

308
00:44:08,442 --> 00:44:09,844
His what?

309
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,613
I'm sorry I haven't seen my
boss in his boxers before

310
00:44:12,747 --> 00:44:14,282
I'm freaking out a little bit.

311
00:44:14,448 --> 00:44:15,850
You're freaked out?

312
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:17,752
Why would, why would he do this?

313
00:44:18,485 --> 00:44:20,088
Shit! The raid.

314
00:44:20,321 --> 00:44:21,689
The what?

315
00:44:21,823 --> 00:44:23,390
Last night the D.A. raided
the entire office.

316
00:44:23,523 --> 00:44:24,893
They placed charges against
Mark...

317
00:44:25,026 --> 00:44:26,593
Evidence of tampering, on
multiple cases!

318
00:44:26,728 --> 00:44:28,029
That's why I tried to call you!

319
00:44:28,162 --> 00:44:30,497
So, this fuck-stain knew his
entire career,

320
00:44:30,632 --> 00:44:31,866
was going down the drain and

321
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,768
so he's
just trying drag me down too.

322
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:35,837
Fuck!

323
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,038
You call the police?

324
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:39,073
He trashed my phone.

325
00:44:40,275 --> 00:44:41,475
Okay.

326
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:43,244
We got time to get our
story straight.

327
00:44:43,645 --> 00:44:45,914
What story? He killed himself.

328
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:48,750
You washed your face?

329
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:52,820
Yeah! I rinsed my dead
husband's blood and

330
00:44:52,954 --> 00:44:54,956
brains off! Why?

331
00:44:56,024 --> 00:44:57,457
Do you think that I did this?

332
00:44:57,591 --> 00:44:58,693
Of course not but...

333
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:00,395
a cop is going to ask you
that question.

334
00:45:00,527 --> 00:45:02,063
Okay so let a cop ask that
question!

335
00:45:02,196 --> 00:45:03,831
I'll tell them the
fucking truth.

336
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:05,633
You gotta understand the
truth is not necessarily your

337
00:45:05,767 --> 00:45:07,068
best friend right now, trust me,
I do this for a living.

338
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:09,404
So, what do I do? I lie to
the police?

339
00:45:09,536 --> 00:45:11,339
No. We manage the truth.

340
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,708
This doesn't look good for
either of us.

341
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:16,878
I don't give a shit about
looking good right now!

342
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:18,445
You gave a shit five minutes
ago,

343
00:45:18,578 --> 00:45:19,681
when you washed the evidence off
your face.

344
00:45:19,814 --> 00:45:21,916
- Call the fucking police!
- Listen.

345
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,217
Have you stopped,

346
00:45:23,351 --> 00:45:26,187
to think about why Mark
sent you that message?

347
00:45:27,055 --> 00:45:28,189
Because I woke up

348
00:45:28,522 --> 00:45:30,590
Handcuffed to my dead
husband, whose...

349
00:45:30,758 --> 00:45:32,592
carcass I've been
dragging around,

350
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:34,461
the entire house.

351
00:45:34,996 --> 00:45:37,231
He siphoned all of the
gas out of the car.

352
00:45:37,365 --> 00:45:40,134
He thought to remove
every sharp object.

353
00:45:40,467 --> 00:45:44,571
I have been <i>chained</i> to
this nightmare all day.

354
00:45:44,706 --> 00:45:48,643
Do you really think, that
he sent you that text,

355
00:45:48,776 --> 00:45:51,012
so you could come here and you
could save me?

356
00:45:51,145 --> 00:45:53,214
Call the police!

357
00:45:53,348 --> 00:45:54,749
Okay, you're right.

358
00:45:55,316 --> 00:45:57,685
Umm, shit.

359
00:45:59,153 --> 00:46:00,455
I left it on charge.

360
00:46:05,326 --> 00:46:06,828
You recognise that car?

361
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:09,664
No.

362
00:46:09,998 --> 00:46:12,400
Passed him about a mile back.

363
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:14,936
He was parked up on the
side of the road.

364
00:46:16,938 --> 00:46:18,605
Tom we have to run.

365
00:46:20,742 --> 00:46:22,509
How do you expect to do that?

366
00:46:24,445 --> 00:46:25,413
Listen.

367
00:46:25,847 --> 00:46:27,648
Okay let me handle this.

368
00:46:28,216 --> 00:46:29,684
- No, you cant go out there...
- Emma!

369
00:46:29,817 --> 00:46:30,752
The only thing this guy
knows for sure,

370
00:46:30,885 --> 00:46:32,253
is that I'm here, that's it.

371
00:46:32,387 --> 00:46:33,721
Lock the door and don't open it
for anybody...

372
00:46:33,855 --> 00:46:34,756
- No! No, no!
- Don't open for anybody,

373
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:35,757
that's not me.

374
00:46:36,024 --> 00:46:38,226
- Shit!
- Lock the door.

375
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,261
Shit.

376
00:46:43,563 --> 00:46:45,532
Tom, be careful.

377
00:47:10,658 --> 00:47:11,558
Can I help you?

378
00:47:11,692 --> 00:47:13,194
Yeah, I sure hope so.

379
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:16,030
Are you the owner of the
property?

380
00:47:16,164 --> 00:47:19,566
No. You gotta come back
another time.

381
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,271
Yeah see... a, a Mr. Webster,
hired us to fix a burst pipe,

382
00:47:23,404 --> 00:47:26,007
you know? He said he'd be
here today to let us inside.

383
00:47:26,841 --> 00:47:28,342
Well, like I said no one's
here so...

384
00:47:29,911 --> 00:47:31,245
How much did he say
he was gonna pay you?

385
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:33,915
I'll cover it and you can
be on your way.

386
00:47:34,048 --> 00:47:35,582
Do you mind if we settle
inside?

387
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:37,418
It's cold as a witch's
tit out here, y'know?

388
00:47:37,552 --> 00:47:38,820
Actually I do.

389
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:40,721
How much?

390
00:47:41,956 --> 00:47:45,693
I uh... we agreed upon, an
even two hundred.

391
00:47:49,997 --> 00:47:51,933
Here's fifty on top.

392
00:47:52,733 --> 00:47:54,202
Well, ain't you a gentleman.

393
00:47:54,802 --> 00:47:56,471
Drive safe.

394
00:47:56,737 --> 00:47:58,439
Actually, uh...

395
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,875
Mind if I use your facilities?

396
00:48:01,142 --> 00:48:02,609
I just drove all the way from
Buffalo

397
00:48:02,743 --> 00:48:04,178
and I'm all-about
ready to burst, you know?

398
00:48:04,879 --> 00:48:06,948
It's out of order.

399
00:48:08,749 --> 00:48:10,685
Out of order?

400
00:48:11,953 --> 00:48:14,589
Listen, you got a problem
with me or something?

401
00:48:16,657 --> 00:48:18,593
You said you drove from
Buffalo...

402
00:48:18,893 --> 00:48:21,896
over 250 miles just to fix
a burst pipe.

403
00:48:22,663 --> 00:48:24,599
With Indiana plates.

404
00:48:24,866 --> 00:48:26,667
I gave you what you came for
and

405
00:48:26,934 --> 00:48:28,202
still you're standing here,

406
00:48:28,336 --> 00:48:30,705
so yeah, I got a problem
with you "or something".

407
00:48:32,907 --> 00:48:34,909
I think you should leave.

408
00:48:47,155 --> 00:48:48,956
Listen, why don't you
just let us inside

409
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,324
so we can do our job, alright?

410
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:52,160
Look, fuck off! Now!

411
00:48:54,695 --> 00:48:56,297
Alright, alright.

412
00:48:58,366 --> 00:49:00,568
We don't have to do this,
alright? We can just walk away.

413
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:01,836
...I already notified the
police,

414
00:49:01,969 --> 00:49:03,604
I suggest you get back in
your car...

415
00:49:05,006 --> 00:49:06,908
- Shit!
- Argh!

416
00:49:33,434 --> 00:49:35,236
Holy shit!

417
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:37,338
Jesus, Bobby.

418
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:40,341
You killed him.
You fucking killed him... fuck.

419
00:49:41,876 --> 00:49:43,811
I'm so sorry...
I'm sorry man.

420
00:49:43,945 --> 00:49:45,046
Hey, hey, careful!

421
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:46,314
They got your
prints on file.

422
00:49:46,447 --> 00:49:47,915
He's already
called the cops!

423
00:49:48,049 --> 00:49:48,950
No, because if
he did we would've

424
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:50,218
heard it over the scanner.

425
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:51,285
Oh shit!

426
00:49:51,419 --> 00:49:53,287
Bobby, we're fucked, man!

427
00:49:53,421 --> 00:49:55,723
Oh my God, I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry.

428
00:49:56,857 --> 00:49:58,526
What are we doing, Bobby?

429
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,461
What are you fucking doing?!

430
00:50:00,595 --> 00:50:02,463
Will you just fucking relax.

431
00:50:04,098 --> 00:50:06,367
What are we doing here,
Bobby? Bobby we gotta go!

432
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,169
- We gotta go, we...
- Jimmy. Jimmy!

433
00:50:08,302 --> 00:50:09,705
- Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.
- What the fuck is this shit?!

434
00:50:09,837 --> 00:50:11,239
- Jimmy, Jimmy!
- No... get off, I don't...

435
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,674
- No!
- Calm down!

436
00:50:12,807 --> 00:50:13,941
- Calm down! Hey! Shh!
- No!

437
00:50:14,075 --> 00:50:15,776
Listen! Listen. It's
fine! It's fine.

438
00:50:15,943 --> 00:50:17,812
You said... you said you
were gonna tie 'em up!

439
00:50:17,945 --> 00:50:19,380
You said nothing about
killing them.

440
00:50:19,513 --> 00:50:20,982
I know and I'm sorry,
okay? But listen, little brother

441
00:50:21,115 --> 00:50:22,450
I need you to focus right now.

442
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:25,186
Okay? We need to find her
still. Alright?

443
00:50:25,386 --> 00:50:27,288
No, wait... what are you
gonna do when you find her?

444
00:50:27,421 --> 00:50:31,425
Listen, you just yell out
if you spot her. Jimmy? Okay?

445
00:52:56,337 --> 00:52:58,005
Ugh!

446
00:53:04,979 --> 00:53:06,614
Agh!

447
00:53:11,986 --> 00:53:13,354
Ugh!

448
00:53:37,945 --> 00:53:40,347
Jesus fucking Christ!

449
00:53:43,384 --> 00:53:44,653
Bobby!

450
00:53:45,687 --> 00:53:47,221
Bobby!

451
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:52,193
It's over there.

452
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,445
What's wrong?

453
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,582
Be careful, the ice could be...

454
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:16,751
thin.

455
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,728
God!

456
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,534
Looks like the wolves
got to him.

457
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:35,503
You ever seen a wolf use
an anchor?

458
00:54:39,908 --> 00:54:42,009
Ah fuck!

459
00:54:42,677 --> 00:54:43,544
It's him.

460
00:54:43,678 --> 00:54:44,612
Who?

461
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,514
The guy who hired us.

462
00:54:48,717 --> 00:54:50,685
What, that's the
guy who hired us?

463
00:54:51,185 --> 00:54:52,353
The lawyer that put you away?

464
00:54:52,486 --> 00:54:54,188
Yeah, we found common ground.

465
00:54:54,689 --> 00:54:57,124
Bobby, what the fuck are
we still doing here then?

466
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:00,160
We're not leaving until
we open that safe.

467
00:55:00,294 --> 00:55:02,129
Well then lets go! Lets
go and do it.

468
00:55:02,263 --> 00:55:04,031
And leave this girl behind. Huh?

469
00:55:04,164 --> 00:55:05,834
The lawyer dude is
fucking dead, huh?

470
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:07,601
- Contract's null and void.
- You don't understand.

471
00:55:07,736 --> 00:55:08,904
There were two people
that knew

472
00:55:09,036 --> 00:55:10,304
the combination to that safe.

473
00:55:10,437 --> 00:55:11,773
One of them
is now missing part of his head.

474
00:55:12,373 --> 00:55:13,708
Just give me a second to think.

475
00:55:14,575 --> 00:55:16,645
She could be miles away by now.

476
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,652
Not without shoes.

477
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:34,221
Bobby!

478
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,423
Yeah?

479
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:40,160
This is some pretty
high-tech shit.

480
00:56:42,764 --> 00:56:44,666
There any chance of
blowing it open?

481
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,637
Not without turning
everything inside into dust.

482
00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:51,238
Shit.

483
00:56:51,472 --> 00:56:52,907
Yeah and that's not the
worst of it.

484
00:56:53,507 --> 00:56:54,909
You see this model?

485
00:56:55,576 --> 00:56:58,278
Well it needs a
combination and a finger-print.

486
00:56:59,213 --> 00:57:00,514
Hers?

487
00:57:01,116 --> 00:57:02,249
Maybe.

488
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:04,184
I mean, It'd have to be
programmed in.

489
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:05,920
So, I'd put money on him.

490
00:57:07,722 --> 00:57:09,490
There's only one way to
find out.

491
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,865
I mean, what do I look
like? The fucking undertaker?

492
00:57:16,998 --> 00:57:18,332
"In and out" you said.

493
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:21,268
We open the safe and we'd
split the diamonds.

494
00:57:21,435 --> 00:57:23,938
Alright. I'll get the
body, you find the girl.

495
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:29,844
Fuck you, man.

496
00:57:43,992 --> 00:57:47,261
Oh come on. You got to be
fucking kidding me.

497
00:57:48,362 --> 00:57:49,798
Oh!

498
00:57:57,571 --> 00:57:58,973
Fucking hell.

499
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:01,743
Twenty fucking minutes.

500
00:58:02,376 --> 00:58:04,578
I'm out here freezing
my nuts off.

501
00:58:05,013 --> 00:58:07,414
Why don't you get the
fucking body?

502
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,041
Oh god.

503
01:01:26,948 --> 01:01:28,615
Shit.

504
01:02:29,576 --> 01:02:31,813
- What did you do?
- Nothing. It wasn't me.

505
01:02:31,946 --> 01:02:33,815
Can you switch it off?

506
01:03:17,557 --> 01:03:18,459
"Twenty minutes,
in and out",

507
01:03:18,592 --> 01:03:19,994
that's what you said!

508
01:03:20,527 --> 01:03:22,629
Bobby! Bobby. Bobby, Bobby.

509
01:03:22,764 --> 01:03:24,165
Just listen to me okay?

510
01:03:24,332 --> 01:03:25,933
She's already put you
behind bars once before,

511
01:03:26,067 --> 01:03:27,802
don't
make the same mistake again.

512
01:03:27,935 --> 01:03:30,304
The only mistake I made
was leaving her still breathing.

513
01:03:30,438 --> 01:03:33,107
She, she could be anywhere
by now, it's over.

514
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:35,676
- No it's not. It's not.
- It's over! It's over!

515
01:03:36,711 --> 01:03:38,246
- Ten years I spent...
- No.

516
01:03:38,379 --> 01:03:41,716
Please, look at me. Ten
years I spent inside that cage.

517
01:03:41,849 --> 01:03:43,351
Ten fucking years.

518
01:03:44,285 --> 01:03:45,686
While they repossessed
our house.

519
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,554
The house that we grew up in.

520
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:50,525
While Pop got sick, this
bitch...

521
01:03:50,892 --> 01:03:52,894
took everything from us Jimmy.

522
01:03:53,027 --> 01:03:55,363
And those diamonds are
compensation for that.

523
01:03:56,064 --> 01:03:58,032
Okay? And we are still in
the game.

524
01:03:58,399 --> 01:04:01,069
How do you think she
triggered the car alarm?

525
01:04:02,737 --> 01:04:04,806
- The keys.
- Why?

526
01:04:05,706 --> 01:04:06,707
Because we were right
next to her.

527
01:04:06,841 --> 01:04:08,543
Yes! She wanted to distract us.

528
01:04:08,676 --> 01:04:11,446
Because she's still in
the house. Okay?

529
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,449
We got this. You take the
back, I'll take the front.

530
01:04:15,149 --> 01:04:17,051
- Okay? Good boy.
- Yeah, alright.

531
01:04:20,888 --> 01:04:22,657
Go on, you're good.

532
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:15,630
Argh!

533
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:21,535
Bobby.

534
01:07:28,376 --> 01:07:29,410
Bobby?

535
01:07:30,544 --> 01:07:31,545
Bobby.

536
01:07:33,848 --> 01:07:36,550
Bobby. Holy shit.

537
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:41,155
Bobby? Bobby, what the
hell happened?

538
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:42,290
Huh?

539
01:07:46,728 --> 01:07:47,663
No! No, no, no!

540
01:07:47,795 --> 01:07:49,630
No! Fuck!

541
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:52,634
Bobby! Bobby get up!

542
01:08:07,649 --> 01:08:09,183
No! No!

543
01:08:13,821 --> 01:08:15,122
Fucker...

544
01:08:17,491 --> 01:08:19,160
<i>911, What's the
emergency?</i>

545
01:08:19,293 --> 01:08:20,394
Help!

546
01:08:21,195 --> 01:08:22,731
<i>Ma'am? Ma'am can you
hear me?</i>

547
01:08:23,264 --> 01:08:24,432
She called the cops?

548
01:08:24,565 --> 01:08:26,033
Yeah, she tried to.

549
01:08:27,435 --> 01:08:29,870
- Shit! We gotta get out of here.
- Jimmy...

550
01:08:30,004 --> 01:08:31,807
Listen, the cops are
gonna trace the call.

551
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:32,907
We're in the middle of
nowhere, okay?

552
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,075
We still have time.

553
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:35,677
Bobby... Bobby. Listen. Listen...

554
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:38,045
No, we're not leaving
here until we're done.

555
01:08:38,245 --> 01:08:39,880
Well, then I'm telling
you, I'm done alright?

556
01:08:40,014 --> 01:08:42,651
Listen to me, you
ungrateful, little prick.

557
01:08:42,784 --> 01:08:44,485
We are five fucking minutes away

558
01:08:44,618 --> 01:08:46,120
from 200 grand in rocks.

559
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,557
Alright, so you drag that
corpse up those stairs

560
01:08:49,691 --> 01:08:51,192
or you fucking become one.

561
01:08:51,325 --> 01:08:52,661
Do you understand me?

562
01:08:52,927 --> 01:08:54,362
Yeah

563
01:08:54,495 --> 01:08:55,963
Fucking go!

564
01:09:02,036 --> 01:09:04,205
I don't know the combination.

565
01:09:05,973 --> 01:09:07,843
We'll see about that.

566
01:09:19,553 --> 01:09:23,023
<i>Emma... Emma, it
could be a beautiful thing...</i>

567
01:09:23,457 --> 01:09:26,961
<i>Time to wake up.
Wake up... Wake up.</i>

568
01:09:33,367 --> 01:09:34,935
Ow.

569
01:09:35,536 --> 01:09:36,470
Urgh.

570
01:09:43,978 --> 01:09:45,747
Figured you'd want to spend your
last precious moments

571
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,548
with the old ball and chain.

572
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:01,830
Such a perfect couple.

573
01:10:02,096 --> 01:10:03,230
I already told you
that I don't know

574
01:10:03,364 --> 01:10:05,399
the combination to the safe.

575
01:10:09,136 --> 01:10:14,975
No, no, no!

576
01:10:15,476 --> 01:10:16,410
Argh!

577
01:10:16,544 --> 01:10:18,579
Bobby... Bobby, we don't
need to do this!

578
01:10:19,613 --> 01:10:20,649
No, no, no...

579
01:10:20,782 --> 01:10:22,950
- No, no, no...
- Stay down! Stay there!

580
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:24,786
There it is.

581
01:10:24,985 --> 01:10:27,689
My shadow.

582
01:10:28,389 --> 01:10:30,859
Half my world went dark
that night.

583
01:10:31,225 --> 01:10:34,796
<i>But</i>... there's a light on
the other side of that door.

584
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,565
And the combination,
according to your husband,

585
01:10:37,732 --> 01:10:40,000
is the day that he proposed to
you.

586
01:10:40,134 --> 01:10:42,671
Okay... what do you expect
me to do?

587
01:10:42,804 --> 01:10:43,971
Just give you the dates so

588
01:10:44,104 --> 01:10:45,740
you can kill me right
afterwards?

589
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:48,810
I expect you to scream.

590
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,479
Argh! No, no, no...
Please stop!

591
01:10:51,612 --> 01:10:53,648
Let's see how quiet you
stay with no fucking toes.

592
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:55,182
Bobby?

593
01:10:55,449 --> 01:10:56,785
Help me!

594
01:10:57,051 --> 01:10:59,788
Stop, Bobby...

595
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:02,523
- Okay.
- Don't you fucking move!

596
01:11:03,624 --> 01:11:06,527
Stay there!

597
01:11:08,028 --> 01:11:10,264
No, no, no!
Please, please...

598
01:11:10,397 --> 01:11:12,734
Please?

599
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:23,544
Jimmy, what are you doing?

600
01:11:24,746 --> 01:11:27,749
No one else
needs to get hurt.

601
01:11:30,084 --> 01:11:31,018
Give me the gun.

602
01:11:31,151 --> 01:11:32,453
No!

603
01:11:32,586 --> 01:11:34,656
- Give me the gun, <i>now</i>.
- Fuck you!

604
01:11:35,089 --> 01:11:37,993
- Fuck me?
- Fuck you, you sick...

605
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:42,296
Go stand by the safe.

606
01:11:43,798 --> 01:11:46,400
And leave the knife.

607
01:11:47,101 --> 01:11:49,203
Man, I swear...

608
01:11:50,705 --> 01:11:51,605
Fuck.

609
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:07,154
Okay. Come on, what the
fuck are you gonna do then?

610
01:12:07,354 --> 01:12:09,724
Okay, here's what's gonna
happen.

611
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:11,091
Alright.

612
01:12:11,225 --> 01:12:12,661
You give us the
combination,

613
01:12:12,794 --> 01:12:14,328
we take the diamonds and leave
you here <i>alive</i>.

614
01:12:14,461 --> 01:12:16,031
Jesus Christ! What do you
think she's gonna do?

615
01:12:16,163 --> 01:12:17,398
The moment she's outta
here,

616
01:12:17,531 --> 01:12:18,399
she's gonna go straight to the
cops...

617
01:12:18,532 --> 01:12:19,600
Shut up!

618
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,168
Fuck!

619
01:12:21,636 --> 01:12:23,304
Who do you think is the
first person the cops are gonna

620
01:12:23,437 --> 01:12:25,740
come looking for when
they find her dead body, huh?

621
01:12:26,073 --> 01:12:29,443
You already put a target
on our backs, you dumb fuck!

622
01:12:29,711 --> 01:12:32,146
We should have
never come here.

623
01:12:32,346 --> 01:12:33,480
I'll give it to you...

624
01:12:33,614 --> 01:12:35,082
but you gotta fucking cut
me loose.

625
01:12:35,215 --> 01:12:36,383
Combination first.

626
01:12:36,517 --> 01:12:37,484
Fuck that! Not as long as
I'm attached

627
01:12:37,618 --> 01:12:38,987
to this fucking piece of shit.

628
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:41,221
Jimmy, we don't have
fucking time.

629
01:12:41,355 --> 01:12:43,692
Just let me cut the date
out of her and we're done!

630
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:45,392
I'll pick open these handcuffs.

631
01:12:45,526 --> 01:12:46,795
You give me the combination

632
01:12:46,928 --> 01:12:48,897
But no one's leaving
until that safe is open.

633
01:12:49,096 --> 01:12:50,765
Alright?

634
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:51,933
Okay?

635
01:12:52,299 --> 01:12:53,668
Fine.

636
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:56,403
Okay, let's hurry up the
fuck along then, shall we?

637
01:12:57,939 --> 01:13:00,274
Come on, Jimmy, let's go!

638
01:13:25,299 --> 01:13:27,234
Okay, let's have that date?

639
01:13:29,236 --> 01:13:31,740
July 29th, 2011.

640
01:13:57,264 --> 01:13:58,900
What the fuck!

641
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:00,300
What?

642
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:12,513
<i>"The diamonds you seek,
lay close to her heart."</i>

643
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:17,418
Necklace... the diamonds
are in the necklace!

644
01:14:17,551 --> 01:14:19,154
It doesn't open. It
doesn't come off...

645
01:14:19,286 --> 01:14:20,421
Let me try.

646
01:14:21,288 --> 01:14:22,724
Where's the clasp?

647
01:14:22,857 --> 01:14:25,292
There isn't one. This
fucker made it so it won't open!

648
01:14:26,861 --> 01:14:28,663
Jesus, what is this thing
made of?

649
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:31,598
He doesn't want us to cut
the necklace off her.

650
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:37,038
He wants us to cut <i>her</i>
off the necklace.

651
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:38,605
No, no, no... No, I got this...

652
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,208
- I got this, I got this.
- Get it off! Get it off! Please!

653
01:14:41,341 --> 01:14:43,011
Break this off... to break
this off...

654
01:14:43,144 --> 01:14:44,679
Shit!

655
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,381
Hold it.

656
01:14:53,855 --> 01:14:54,856
No, no, please!

657
01:14:54,989 --> 01:14:56,323
Jimmy, get out of the
fucking way!...

658
01:14:56,457 --> 01:14:57,491
- Just let me have a go.
- Jimmy!

659
01:14:57,624 --> 01:14:58,893
Let me cut it...

660
01:15:04,298 --> 01:15:06,500
Argh!

661
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,402
No! Bobby! Bobby!

662
01:15:08,535 --> 01:15:10,205
I'm not gonna let you do this!

663
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:14,075
- I'm not losing you today!
- Stop! Get off me!

664
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:15,877
- Jimmy!
- Stop it!

665
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:17,145
Get off me!

666
01:15:38,365 --> 01:15:39,901
No, no, no...

667
01:15:49,343 --> 01:15:51,445
Ugh...

668
01:16:00,554 --> 01:16:03,390
This is all your fault.

669
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,527
You fucking did this.

670
01:16:08,595 --> 01:16:10,899
I'm gonna cut your
fucking head off!

671
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:13,300
<i>Fuck you.</i>

672
01:16:19,941 --> 01:16:20,909
Ahh!

673
01:16:27,148 --> 01:16:29,383
Argh!

674
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:55,043
Argh!

675
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:05,787
Ugh!

676
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:18,166
Oh god!

677
01:17:20,835 --> 01:17:22,971
Please,

678
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:49,496
Fuck!

679
01:17:51,531 --> 01:17:52,700
Ahh!

680
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:56,436
Fuck you!

681
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,743
Shit!

682
01:18:18,192 --> 01:18:19,894
Ugh!

683
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,156
Fuck!

684
01:18:57,131 --> 01:18:59,100
Nowhere to run,
you bitch!

685
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:18,987
Ugh!

686
01:19:23,523 --> 01:19:25,460
Argh!

687
01:19:35,803 --> 01:19:38,039
You fucking bitch!

688
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,742
Argh!
