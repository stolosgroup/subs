Yes. Thank you.

- Angus.
- Stop talking.

17
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,125
Angus!

18
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,416
What the fuck?

19
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,375
Watch it!

20
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,375
Are we done yet, boss? I'm parched.

21
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,458
Yeah. Almost.

22
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,375
Hey, listen. Mind the tools.
I'm gonna go take a leak.

00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:55,875
Aye.

There you are.

27
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,208
- Can I help you?
- Oh. Sorry.

28
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,375
I was just, um... looking for the bathroom.

29
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,000
In the living room?

30
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,000
It's just along here to the left.

31
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,333
Is that your old man?

32
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,416
Yes.

33
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,958
- I can see the resemblance.
- Hm.

34
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Hey!

35
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,000
- Mmm. Smells good in here.
- You're a bit late.

36
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,291
I had a doctor's appointment.

37
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:57,916
Everything okay?

38
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,958
Yeah. Just a checkup.

39
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,000
How was your day?

40
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,500
Yeah, it was fine.

41
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,708
Hey, look at this.

42
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,583
- I was at a judge's house today. Look.
- Hmm.

43
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,083
That gonna be us one day?

44
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,708
In London? Not on a judge's salary, babe.

45
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,250
Probably a wealthy family.
What's the name?

46
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,333
Hector Blake.

47
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,458
Oh! Philip, my tutor,
went to school with him.

48
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,666
- They call him Saint Blake.
- Oh yeah?

49
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,375
Back when he was a QC, he'd take on
inquests on behalf of refugees.

50
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,083
And he'd do it for free.

51
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:38,625
Maybe you could ask him to take a look
at my dissertation proposal?

52
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,916
Maybe you can ask Philip to do it.

53
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,208
- Dickhead!
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

54
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,125
- That's abusive language.
- Abusive?

55
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,208
- Why are you being abusive?
- I don't think it is.

56
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,208
- No?
- No, no...

57
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:56,625
Well, it's too bad.
'Cause you can't get rid of me now.

58
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
And why's that?

59
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,541
I've got news for you.

60
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,625
Aah!

61
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,791
- You got me.
- Yes.

62
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:12,875
Yes, brother.

63
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,708
Ah!

64
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,708
- All right?
- All right.

65
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,083
I really need to eat.

66
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,125
Wow, bro, this place is a rip-off!

67
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,833
Don't worry. I got you. Tuna melt?

68
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,833
- Aw, thanks, love.
- You're welcome, darling.

69
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,333
How many people?

70
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,458
You know what I was reading
about that judge?

71
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,833
His family,
they're all staunch colonialists.

72
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,625
His father was a factory owner,
critical of decolonization...

73
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,476
- The sh...
- Yeah, but people call him a saint.

74
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,708
It's a publicity stunt. You know why?

75
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,541
Hector later gets appointed
as a High Court judge,

76
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,267
but quits after a year, saying the bench...

77
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,934
...is "too white and elitist,"

78
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,583
pissing off the Lord Chancellor, Lord this
and that, then bam, he's back in the news.

79
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,541
But maybe he's just trying
to right the wrongs of his family.

80
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,958
Or to avert attention.

81
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,583
Look.

82
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,375
That's ivory.

83
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,708
I mean, he's going mad for this
imperialist shit. This is illegal now.

84
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,000
It's just a fuckin' piece of antique, man.

85
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,666
Whose side are you on, man?

86
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,791
Hey, look, um...

87
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,041
I can't do this no more.

88
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,625
Naz is pregnant.

89
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,500
- Well, fuck.
- Yeah!

90
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,500
- I know.
- She's not gonna keep it, is she?

91
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,291
Of course she's gonna fucking keep it.

92
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,833
I mean, we're both excited.

93
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,166
Look, I know.
I know it's a bit unexpected.

94
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,125
- But...
- Unexpected?

95
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,708
- Who the fuck wants a kid at 23?
- Um...

96
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,458
Your mum?

97
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,625
She doesn't count.

98
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,250
Yo, listen.

99
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,458
This changes shit.

100
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,000
Look, I... I can't do
no more missions. Yeah?

101
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,541
You know the feds have me on their radar,
and I can't risk going back in pen.

102
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,583
No one is going back in the pen.
You and me run this thing like clockwork.

103
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,333
You know I can't do this on my own.

104
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,708
I know, but maybe
we need to call it a day.

105
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,375
Writing was your thing, Jameel.
Fight the system, remember?

106
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,958
We just give up the fight
'cause you're havin' a kid?

107
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,000
But what difference have we really made?

108
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,791
- We've shown we can get to them.
- Don't.

109
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,125
We can get right inside their homes
any time we want.

110
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,833
Yes, and we've made our point,
so let's just move on.

111
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:30,000
Aah! You don't even want this kid.
You're just doin' this for her.

112
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,708
Fuck you for that, Toby.

113
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,750
Jay, you can't wimp out on me.

114
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,791
- I need you, bro!
- Nah, bro.

115
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,375
My child needs me. Yeah?

116
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,625
Look, I ain't havin' him grow up
the same way that we did.

117
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:48,458
Listen, if you wanna keep writin',
yeah, you do that.

118
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,666
But you keep me out of it.

119
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,333
Cheers. Thank you.

120
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,416
Excuse me, can I get
a takeaway box for this as well?

121
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,625
<i>And what do you want?</i>

122
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,375
Doesn't matter what I want.

123
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,791
Faisal, medical education's
giving you severe anxiety.

124
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,958
You can't even look at blood
without passing out.

125
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,833
So I should man up then, yeah?

126
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,875
I'm here to live their dream.

127
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,125
That's what a good son does.

128
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,708
He completes his parents' vision
of the future.

129
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:30,583
And what about your vision of the future?
What would that look like?

130
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,958
Computers.

131
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,958
I love computers.

132
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,083
But my parents
want their only son to be a doctor.

133
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,625
So it wouldn't work.

134
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,666
I translate that
as your parents don't share your vision,

135
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,291
not that it wouldn't work.

136
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,916
My mum's worked every hour God sends
since she came to this country

137
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,458
to give me and my sisters a better life.

138
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,500
That's what parents do.

139
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,541
It's sort of what we sign up for.

140
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,541
The payoff is seeing your children happy.

141
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,458
They'd be so disappointed if I drop out.

142
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,208
My mum wouldn't ever get over it.

143
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,000
And you don't want to hurt your mum.

144
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,250
No.

145
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,083
So, you'd rather hurt yourself instead?

146
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,666
<i>Morality is dead.</i>

147
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:28,291
<i>Nobody does anything
for a real or meaningful reason anymore.</i>

148
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,166
<i>Everyone is just keepin' face,</i>

149
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,250
<i>makin' sure they're part
of the latest woke movement,</i>

150
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,750
<i>but it's all disingenuous.</i>

151
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,791
<i>So maybe it's time we took a good look
at ourselves as individuals,</i>

152
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,000
<i>and maybe took
a little bit of responsibility,</i>

153
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,208
<i>because real change
must come from the ground up.</i>

154
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,916
<i>Now, talking of meaningful
versus meaningless acts,</i>

155
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,791

"I Came By" taggers.</i>

<i>Two affluent homes were hit

00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,416
Hello?

161
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,750
Toby, I'm home!

162
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,666
<i>So, Rave, you're a graffiti artist.</i>

163
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,875
<i>Writer. Graffiti writer.
There's a difference.</i>

164
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,125
<i>- What do you make of "I Came By"?
- Whoever done it is a fucking toy.</i>

165
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,833
<i>I heard it's not the same crew anymore.</i>

166
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,583
<i>Might be another dickhead
with a tin of paint, playin' the hero.</i>

167
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,041
<i>But graffiti belongs to the streets.
Public places. You know what I mean?</i>

168
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,125
<i>You don't break into people's homes,
no matter who they are. That's a no-go.</i>

169
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,833
<i>That's an interesting point,</i>

170
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,291
<i>because the type of people
these guys are targetin',</i>

171
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,375
<i>isn't that a "fuck you"
to the establishment?</i>

172
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,000
<i>If so, isn't that the point
of the graffiti movement?</i>

173
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,125
<i>No, man. I mean,
who are they even targetin'?</i>

174
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,875
<i>Last month was a banker.
How fuckin' original.</i>

175
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,791
<i>Who's it gonna be next?
Fuckin' Tony Blair?</i>

176
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,875
Oh, you've got to be kiddin' me.

177
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,416
Toby?

178
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,666
Toby?

179
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,791
Toby!

180
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:33,375
Have you seen the remote?
I left it in a visible, normal place.

181
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,666
This can't be the third one we've lost.
I don't get it.

182
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,958
Hello to you too, Mother.

183
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,291
I did say hello. You didn't hear me.

184
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,833
Can you help me look?

185
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,041
Maybe it's
the universe telling you

186
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,625
to stop watchin' fame-hungry
wannabe celebrities selling their souls.

187
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,750
I am so sorry, Mr. Highbrow. So,
what have you learned on YouTube today?

188
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,250
Solved the world's problems, have we?

189
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,500
Cool. Okay. I gotta go now.

190
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,875
Wait. Where?

191
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:02,791
Out.

192
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,666
Well, can you tidy the kitchen
before you go? It's a disaster in there.

193
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,583
- I'll clean it when I get back.
- Don't get too wasted!

194
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,166
You old muppet.

195
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,750
Fuckin' sausage.

196
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,833
Call yourself a policeman?
I thought you guys were meant to be fit.

197
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,083
I barely leave my desk
these days. I don't need to be fit.

198
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,916
- Do you want a breather?
- Yes, please.

199
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,416
- All right, all right.
- Aah.

200
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,875
Aah.

201
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,666
My teenage daughter's
less glued to her phone than you are.

202
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,375
I've gotta go.

203
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,583
- What happened?
- It's an alarm.

204
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,625
Want me to send officers round to check?

205
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,875
No, no, no.
It's just a fire alarm at home.

206
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,625
So, uh... I better go and see to it.
I'll make it up to you.

207
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,250
Okay. Keep me posted.

208
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:52,916
Jesus!

209
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:17,875
Hi, William.

210
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:21,666
Thanks for calling. No, no, it's fine.
No, it was just a false alarm.

211
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,958
You know, just some sort
of gremlin in the works, and...

212
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,583
Yeah, technology's too clever by half.

213
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,291
Hold on.

214
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,166
<i>Hello?</i>

215
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,083
<i>Hello?</i>

216
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,000
<i>Hello? Hector?</i>

217
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,166
<i>You okay?</i>

218
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,000
No, it's all good. Yeah.

219
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:54,041
Look, I'm sorry again about tonight,
but, um... same time next week?

220
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,750
- Why have you come?
- Shh!

221
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,684
- Please leave.
- Let's sit and talk.

222
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,875
Talk? I give you an education,
and this is how...

223
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,559
- We're a family.
- Never come again.

224
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:08,809
- I'm not going.
- Just go.

225
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,666
- No, I don't want to go.
- You broke our family!

226
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,892
- Get out.
- Mum, what is this?

227
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,000
Take your stuff.

228
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,250
- You have to go. Get out of my sight!
- Hey!

229
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,976
- Please!
- Take your stuff. Go.

230
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,416
- Shame on you!
- Come on, she's pregnant!

231
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,416
And you!
You've ruined her life. Take her!

232
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,041
Let's go. Just calm down...

233
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:28,041
- My daughter...
- Please...

234
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,958
Don't worry. Don't worry.

235
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,041
- I don't want...
- Please!

236
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,875
Come on. Come on.

237
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,041
Jesus.

238
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,666
Toby?

239
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:54,208
I need to talk to you.

240
00:27:56,041 --> 00:28:00,166
Babes, um... why don't you go inside
and I'll be there in a sec?

241
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,750
Yeah.

242
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,166
Mate, now is not a good time.

243
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,434
- Naz told her parents about the pregnancy...
- Please, Jay.

244
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,916
Something bad has happened
and I don't know what to do, man.

245
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,916
I broke into that judge's house.
The guy you flagged months ago.

246
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,559
- Nah, nah, nah. I don't want...
- And when I got in there, I saw...

247
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,226
- I don't want...
- I don't know what I saw.

248
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,610
- Will you just listen to me?
- No.

249
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:29,416
No, you listen to me.
I don't wanna hear this.

250
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,583
No need to go mental. We said
if I wanted to keep writin', I could.

251
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:35,458
Yes! Yes.
And I told you to keep me out of it.

252
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,958
Look, whatever mess you got yourself in,
yeah, it's not my problem.

253
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:46,750
You're on your own.

254
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:50,708
Jay. Oh...

255
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,000
What did he want?

256
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,125
Standard Toby dramas.

257
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
<i>Emergency.</i>

258
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,416
<i>- Which service do you require?</i>
- Police.

259
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:08,416
<i>Oh jeez. Hey, what's goin' on, fellas?</i>

260
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,125
<i>Oh jeez, man. Nothin', man.
We're just hangin' out and stuff.</i>

261
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:12,500
<i>I hear that. Oh jeez.</i>

262
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:15,351
<i>I'm supposed to be figurin' out
who robbed the store across the street.</i>

263
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,934
<i>But, oh jeez, I don't know.</i>

264
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,666
<i>Oh jeez, man, that sucks
that your Rick's makin' you do that.</i>

265
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,875
<i>He's not my Rick.</i>

266
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,250
<i>He's my partner. Oh jeez.</i>

267
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,791
<i>Well, maybe the uniform
makes a big difference.</i>

268
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:26,750
<i>Who am I to say?</i>

269
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:29,375
<i>To me, you just look like a sidekick.</i>

270
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:32,000
<i>Call me a sidekick one more time!
Call me a sidekick!</i>

271
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:34,458
<i>- Come on! Oh jeez.
- Do you wanna see how I paint a wall?</i>

272
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,500
<i>It was the Mortytown Locos, man.</i>

273
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,041
<i>The Mortytown Locos. Oh!</i>

274
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,559
<i>Know how many codes you violated?</i>

275
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,041
<i>Oh jeez, Rick,
what do I know about knowin' stuff?</i>

276
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,458
<i>Get in the fuckin' car.</i>

277
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:46,851
<i>More...</i>

278
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:02,750
Officers, what can I do for you?

279
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,791
- Sir Hector Blake?
- Yes.

280
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,000
Mind if we come in?

281
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,125
<i>That's how you run a Citadel.</i>

282
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,916
If you wouldn't mind
taking your shoes off.

283
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,916
<i>...soaring, while Rick
satisfaction levels are plummeting</i>

284
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,416
<i>The divide between the two groups
has never been wider.</i>

285
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,666
<i>Solve that one real quick.</i>

286
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:26,541
Oh, please.
That's patently absurd.

287
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:30,708
Surely it's a bored teenager playing
a sick joke. Too much time on their hands.

288
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:34,000
Might anyone have cause to target you
with an accusation like this?

289
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:36,958
I was a judge,
so, yes, one or two people!

290
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,750
Can I get you a coffee, officers?

291
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,476
- Uh, no, thank you.
- Yeah.

292
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,875
- Mmm!
- Thank you.

293
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,976
- How do you take it?
- White, please.

294
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,017
Is there anyone else living here, sir?

295
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:47,958
No, only me.

296
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,083
Please do look around.

297
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:06,625
<i>I'm Rick D. Sanchez III,
owner of this here wafer establishment,</i>

298
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:08,583
<i>and I say that the Rick in there is right!</i>

299
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,750
<i>He's more Rick than any of you.</i>

300
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:12,273
Is there a basement
in this property?

301
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,333
- Yes.
- Do you mind if we have a look?

302
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,458
I must tell William, William Roy,

303
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:24,500
how diligent his officers are
in responding to crank calls.

304
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:27,750
I'm sure he wouldn't think
it was a waste of police time.

305
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,166
He's your superintendent, isn't he?

306
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,625
Good squash player.
Keeps me on my toes, anyway.

307
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,976
<i>...with walking
the fuck out of here.</i>

308
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,458
<i>Yo, J-22! Give 'em hell!</i>

309
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:57,541
I completely understand,
officers. You're just doing your job.

310
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:59,583
Appreciate it. Thank you, sir.

311
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:01,708
No, no, no, don't go!

312
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:08,041
You spineless fuckin' pigs!

313
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:06,916
Toby!

314
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,708
Toby, open this door!

315
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,125
What?

316
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,750
The mess in the kitchen.

317
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,458
Why is it still there?

318
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:19,916
- Mum, honestly, I had such a shit day.
- Oh, really? Doing what exactly?

319
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,166
Fuck off.

320
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:24,958
Excuse me?

321
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:30,208
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere but here.

322
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,375
Because I can't listen
to this shit right now.

323
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:37,083
No. No, right now, you get in there
and you clean that kitchen.

324
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:39,916
You know, it didn't
just miraculously tidy itself yesterday,

325
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,916
or the day before, or the day before that!

326
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,041
Thank you, Mother, for tidying up
after me. I appreciate what you do.

327
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,125
Do you know what? Give me those keys.

328
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,250
What? What are you doin'?
How am I supposed to get back in?

329
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,458
You can come back
when you show me some respect

330
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:55,083
and stop using my front door
like a cat flap.

331
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:57,541
Your front door?
Dad was the one who bought this place.

332
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,541
I don't recall
you doing anything to earn it.

333
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,583
Toby... I didn't...

334
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:13,708
Why don't you give me the money he left
for me, and I'll duck out of here happily?

335
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,166
It's my money, Mum!

336
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:20,708
I've told you. You're not ready
to handle that kind of cash.

337
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:23,750
I'm twenty-fucking-three!
You need to let me get on with my life!

338
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:27,666
Precisely. You're 23,
and what have you achieved?

339
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,875
You've given up on
everything you've ever started.

340
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:34,333
Music, art college, uni. You can't
hold down a job for longer than a week.

341
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:38,916
I work with kids every day
that are so much worse off than you are,

342
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,583
but they're all
desperately fighting for something.

343
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,041
And you, you...

344
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,916
You've got no idea what I'm fightin' for.

345
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:57,000
Don't wait for me to come back.

346
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,083
Stupid bitch...

347
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:10,708
Fuck you!

348
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,541
Hey.

349
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,375
Don't worry.

350
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,583
I'm here to help you.

351
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:16,708
But we don't have much time.

352
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,125
Okay.

353
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:03,833
Stay here, but be quiet.

354
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,291
No...

355
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,791
He... Please.

356
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:13,958
Look at me.

357
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,750
- Aah...
- I'm gettin' you out of here, okay?

358
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:26,791
Oh, for heaven's sake.

359
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,500
You've wet yourself, have you?

360
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,125
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

361
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,750
This keeps on happening,
doesn't it?

362
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,541
Hmm?

363
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:46,250
Well, I'm not going to clear
it up. You're going to clear it up.

364
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:48,916
Hm?

365
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,583
The things you do.

366
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:27,125
<i>God, I'm getting
emotional. I'm so bloody proud of you.</i>

367
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:36,375
<i>This is, uh...
my celebration of being different.</i>

368
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,250
<i>I mean, that is just amazing.</i>

369
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:43,000
<i>And the rice paper offshoots
are just so beautifully done.</i>

370
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,583
<i>Look at the tiny little letters
and numbers.</i>

371
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,306
<i>I love it. It reminds me</i>

372
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:49,958
<i>of something
from, um, the cartoon </i>Yellow Submarine.

373
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,767
<i>I've never seen
a cake anything like it.</i>

374
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:55,125
<i>I don't think any of us have ever seen
a cake like that.</i>

375
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:57,333
<i>I'd have that on my 40th any day.</i>

376
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:59,416
<i>When it eventually comes round.</i>

377
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,250
Yeah, I've been calling him.
His phone's dead.

378
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:28,458
Can you just let me know
if he gets in touch, please?

379
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:30,166
<i>Yeah...</i>

380
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Thanks.

381
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

382
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,125
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

383
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:43,000
I've been calling round all his friends
to see if anyone's heard from him.

384
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:45,125
Oh, yeah? Didn't know he had any.

385
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:47,625
Sorry.

386
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Uh...

387
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:57,458
This is, um...

388
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:00,916
- I'm so sorry.
- Detective Sergeant Ella Lloyd.

389
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Jameel Agassi. Jay.
I'm one of Toby's mates.

390
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:14,125
As it's been over 72 hours
since anyone last saw or heard from Toby,

391
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:16,208
we will treat this
as a missing persons case.

392
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:21,333
Now, do you have any reason to believe
Toby could be in any danger?

393
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,541
No. He's a good kid. I mean, I...

394
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:27,958
I think he's just trying to punish me.

395
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:30,666
Like I said,
we argued before he stormed out.

396
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:32,916
You didn't say what you argued about.

397
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,750
What we always argue about.
Money, his dad.

398
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:39,750
- And where's his father?
- Dead.

399
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:41,583
I mean, he was old.

400
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:44,583
He was never really around, anyway.
Toby barely knew him.

401
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,250
When was the last time you saw him?

402
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,833
I don't know. Months ago, maybe.

403
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:02,416
Ms. Nealey says you two are best mates.
Almost like brothers.

404
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,041
Yeah. We are.

405
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:07,500
Not seeing your best mate for months
doesn't sound too friendly to me.

406
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:12,166
Yeah. I've got a baby on the way,
so I've just been a bit, um... distracted.

407
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,000
Right.

408
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:22,041
Well, we have a recent photo of Toby,
and you have my details.

409
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:26,000
I'll be your point of contact, so if you
think of anything else, notify me.

410
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:27,963
- Thank you.
- I'll see myself out.

411
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:41,583
You know something, don't you?

412
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:43,708
No.

413
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:47,791
No.

414
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
<i>Hello?</i>

415
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:56,708
- Yo, Tobes...
<i>- Got ya!</i>

416
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,833
<i>Leave a message!</i>

417
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:00,833
<i>I can't promise I'll get back to you.</i>

418
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:03,791
Yo, Tobes.

419
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,291
The fuck are you doin', man?

420
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,666
Ju... Ring me.

421
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,291
Don't take the piss.

422
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:44,625
Oh, fuck.

423
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,333
Open up.

424
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:59,083
Oh, come on, man. What is this?

425
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,041
I told you,
I've been driving round all night.

426
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,791
I'm just trying to get some rest.

427
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:12,250
Guess you lot ain't used to seeing
Black fellas round these ends.

428
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,291
Don't try that shit with me.

429
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,125
Do you wanna explain this?

430
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:30,208
Jameel Benjamin Agassi.

431
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:47,083
- July 2018, vandalism.
- It was an empty building.

432
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:48,583
It was private property.

433
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:55,708
June 2020.

434
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,750
Arrested at a protest at Westminster

435
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:01,375
for not complying
with the Public Order Act.

436
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:03,791
You served six weeks in prison.

437
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:11,625
And now you're in possession
of an illegal substance.

438
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:14,375
Come on, man.
It was a butt end of a spliff.

439
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,333
Which is a serious offense.

440
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:19,416
Especially for someone with priors.

441
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,166
Okay.

442
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:26,291
I'm sorry.

443
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,083
It's just my missus,
she's seven months pregnant, and...

444
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:32,666
I'm working 14-hour days, and...

445
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,541
I ain't slept properly in months.

446
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:39,791
I had a little smoke.
So I was just trying to get my head down.

447
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:45,458
I'm sure you know how that is.

448
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:33,875
Toby?

449
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:40,333
Jesus, Jay. What the hell?

450
00:49:40,416 --> 00:49:44,625
I'm sorry, Liz. I... I did knock, but you
didn't hear, so I just used my key.

451
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:48,125
I thought he'd come home.

452
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:50,666
Shit. Sorry, Liz, I should've thought.

453
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:59,125
I keep waiting for him to walk through
the door, but he's not coming back, is he?

454
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:02,250
I don't wanna hear that.
This is classic Toby.

455
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:06,208
Sorry.

456
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:10,333
I took some Diazepam
and it's making me a bit fuzzy.

457
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:15,291
How are you doing? How's Naz?

458
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:16,541
Yeah, good.

459
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,333
She's gettin' big.

460
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:19,416
Is she?

461
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,583
Wow.

462
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,333
Can't believe that I'm gonna be a dad.

463
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,750
I'm shitting it, if I'm honest.

464
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,291
You're gonna be an amazing father.

465
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:34,833
God.

466
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:37,708
Looks like a bomb's gone off
in this place.

467
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:39,833
Oh, to be fair, some of it was me.

468
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:43,250
I've turned the place upside down.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

469
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,333
Have you looked in his secret stash?

470
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:47,291
His what?

471
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:50,708
I was just about to look in it,
just in case there was any clues.

472
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:15,666
By the way, I didn't wanna
mention this to DS Lloyd,

473
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,750
because, well...
I didn't know what she'd find.

474
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,250
Sir Hector Blake?

475
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:35,666
"In support of the environment, our alumni
newsletter will go digital next month."

476
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:39,125
- What is this? Why has he got this?
- I dunno.

477
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:44,583
Why would he have a letter addressed to
some old Birlstonian hidden in his room?

478
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:49,083
I've looked him up, this Hector Blake.
He's an ex-judge.

479
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:51,625
I can't imagine
Toby ever met him in his life.

480
00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:00,750
What? What are you looking for?

481
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,625
Jesus, can you just say something?
I'm losing my mind here.

482
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:13,375
Sorry.

483
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:17,250
I'm glad you brought this
to my attention. I'll be following it up.

484
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:22,041
Well, what does that mean?
Who is this man?

485
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:24,166
Miss. Nealey, I suggest you go home,

486
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,291
and wait for my call.

487
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:35,166
That live trace we've got on Toby Nealey's
phone. What was the last known location?

488
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,250
Uh... Pitt Road.

489
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:38,625
Why?

490
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:41,916
The mother found this in Toby's bedroom,
addressed to Sir Hector Blake,

491
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,416
who lives on the same road.

492
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,458
We got a call in last week
from a young man

493
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:47,583
reporting that someone
was being held captive

494
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:49,625
in the basement of the same address.

495
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,000
You think that was Toby Nealey.

496
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:53,875
<i>That's what we're gonna find out.</i>

497
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:02,916
Sir Hector Blake? I'm DS Ella Lloyd.
Can we step inside, please, for a chat?

498
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,166
What's this about? I was on my way out.

499
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:09,416
Sir, I have grounds to believe the life of
a person on these premises is in danger.

500
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,375
Not that again.

501
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:14,708
Under Section 17
of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act,

502
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,000
we need to come inside
and search your property.

503
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,083
I'm sure I don't need to explain
Section 17 to someone of your stature.

504
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:22,875
Please take off your shoes.

505
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,083
Are you really looking
for an endangered person in there?

506
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:41,583
- I'd like to have a look at your basement.
- This way, Sarge.

507
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:43,375
<i>...division.</i>

508
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:45,458
<i>Is any officer able to go to...</i>

509
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:53,208
This is my workshop.

510
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:57,541
Workshop for what?

511
00:53:58,083 --> 00:54:02,875
My wife used to be a ceramicist. I took up
pottery to help me feel closer to her.

512
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:05,041
Where's your wife?

513
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:06,958
Chesham House.

514
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:09,750
- The psychiatric hospital?
- Yes.

515
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:11,416
Yes.

516
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:27,125
I didn't say I made all of them.

517
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:31,125
All right, all right. You got me, officer.
Am I under arrest?

518
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:52,375
Is there a door behind this shelving unit?

519
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,250
Open it, please.

520
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,333
It's my panic room.

521
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,166
Hmm.

522
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:00,375
This peephole's
on the outside of the door, looking in.

523
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,625
Must be a builder's mistake.

524
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,666
Ah, I'd never noticed that before.

525
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,625
Is that all you got?
You looked like one of the smart ones.

526
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:14,000
- What did you say?
- Hm?

527
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:15,833
Hector Blake,

528
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,583
I'm arresting you
for obstructing an officer...

529
00:56:19,666 --> 00:56:20,541
Oh, come on.

530
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:21,851
...in the execution of her duty.

531
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,750
- What?
- You do not have to say anything.

532
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,791
But it may harm your defense
if you do not...

533
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:35,708
Cuffs to the front.

534
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:06,166
Thank you very much.

535
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,010
- Don't worry.
- It's all a misunderstanding.

536
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:10,625
No, it's fine.
I know she's doing her job.

537
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:13,125
- She's very keen.
- I'm sure.

538
00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:14,500
- I'll sort it out.
- Of course.

539
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:17,333
- We're gonna play...
- Next week, Wednesday. Usual.

540
00:57:17,416 --> 00:57:19,166
- Wednesday. Okay. Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah.

541
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:46,875
Yes?

542
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,625
So, that's it? You're done?

543
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,430
Aren't you gonna ask
how I did it?

544
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:22,416
How did you do it?

545
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:26,791
I mixed a bunch of sleeping pills

546
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:30,250
and downed them with vodka.

547
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:35,583
And then I woke up in a hospital.

548
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,958
Apparently, I didn't get the dosage right.

549
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:44,833
You're studying medicine.

550
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:47,708
Shouldn't you know
how many pills it takes to kill yourself?

551
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,500
Faisal...

552
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:54,125
Look.

553
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:58,416
Maybe you didn't really want to die.

554
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:01,916
Maybe your suicide attempt

555
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,250
was a declaration
of how much you actually want to live.

556
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:11,208
Your way of telling your parents
what you can't seem to say in words.

557
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:15,416
No.

558
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:19,166
I wanted to die.

559
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:24,458
I wanted my parents
to understand that they'd failed me.

560
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:36,916
Are you okay?

561
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,333
Have you heard from your family at all?

562
01:01:54,416 --> 01:01:58,166
I spoke with my sister a few days ago,
but nothing from my parents.

563
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,625
Where are they again? Tehran?

564
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:05,083
No, Gorgan.
It's, like, a small town, north of Iran.

565
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:06,041
Oh.

566
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:09,250
And my sister, she is in Tehran,
and she tells me how they are.

567
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:12,875
You don't speak with your parents?

568
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:16,333
They've disowned me.

569
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:18,500
Really? Why?

570
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:20,833
Because of who I am, I guess.

571
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,041
Oh God. I'm sorry.

572
01:02:24,416 --> 01:02:27,166
As if living in exile wasn't hard enough.

573
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,750
I'm just happy to be alive, you know?

574
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,000
Hmm.

575
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:36,625
So, how come you're able to work?

576
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:40,875
I'm not doing anything illegal.

577
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:43,583
No, no, no. I wasn't suggesting
for a second that you were.

578
01:02:43,666 --> 01:02:46,125
They rejected my application
first time round.

579
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,833
I mean, look, I'm not sure
what more evidence they need.

580
01:02:51,583 --> 01:02:53,666
Me kissing a guy in front of them?

581
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:58,166
So I appealed, and now I don't know
what's happened to my case.

582
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,666
It's been such a long wait
that I'm eligible to work.

583
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,916
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
to make you feel uncomfortable.

584
01:03:05,416 --> 01:03:07,708
- I need to survive.
- Sure.

585
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,666
It's nice getting to know you
a little bit better.

586
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,333
Maybe I could help you,

587
01:03:16,666 --> 01:03:18,791
if you'd like to discuss it further?

588
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,916
What time do you finish?

589
01:03:42,916 --> 01:03:44,333
Thank you so much.

590
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:55,935
You found me.

591
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,291
- Come in.
- I like your gate.

592
01:03:58,375 --> 01:04:00,015
- Very nice.
- Yeah, it is, yeah.

593
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:01,333
- Come in.
- Yes.

594
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,458
- Let me hang up your coat.
- Thank you.

595
01:04:09,291 --> 01:04:11,625
If you wouldn't mind
taking off your shoes.

596
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:12,791
Mm-hm.

597
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:22,583
- Can I get you a drink?
- Sure, if you're having one.

598
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:25,250
Uh, please don't say beer.
I don't have beer.

599
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:27,666
Whatever you want.

600
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:31,708
- Then you'll join me in a gin and tonic.
- Sure. You know best.

601
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:35,000
I tell you what,
why don't you put on a record?

602
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:37,625
My vinyl's in that,
uh, cupboard over there.

603
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:40,208
It's so old it's back in fashion.

604
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,291
You enjoy classical music.

605
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:08,458
Uh, no. This one has a cool cover,
like a Disney film.

606
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,208
Sweet! Here.

607
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:16,416
Shall I play you my favorite piece
from this record?

608
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:24,125
It's my father.

609
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:27,500
You must love him so much
to put his picture up like that.

610
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:32,791
Well, I'm not sure about love.
It's more complex than that.

611
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:36,708
But, like it or not,

612
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,083
he made me the man I am today.

613
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:41,208
I'm sure he's proud.

614
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:42,708
Oh, I doubt it.

615
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:46,041
I'm sure he's very disappointed
that I resigned.

616
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,083
Well, why did you do that?

617
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:53,000
Didn't want to live according
to his plans anymore, and I was bored.

618
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:57,125
But I feel he can still see me
through that picture,

619
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:58,833
even though he's long gone.

620
01:05:58,916 --> 01:06:02,750
So you keep that painting up
to show him your middle finger every day?

621
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:04,791
Pretty much.

622
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:09,000
He thought I was
going to be prime minister.

623
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:14,375
I didn't even want to read law.

624
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:20,625
No, he didn't care much
for me or my mother.

625
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:21,708
Oh.

626
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:23,083
I'm sorry.

627
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,166
We had a young Parsi helper.

628
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,541
Oh. Persian, like me.

629
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:29,958
Indian Persian.

630
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:33,458
His name was Ravi.
Quite a handsome young man.

631
01:06:33,541 --> 01:06:37,791
He'd moved over here to make money
to provide for his family back in India.

632
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:40,708
My father came across him
working in his factory,

633
01:06:40,791 --> 01:06:42,625
and decided
to take him under his wing.

634
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,500
Very kind. Very charitable.

635
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:48,416
And then he invited him
to live in our house,

636
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:51,333
like a member of the family.

637
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:56,333
And eventually,
he invited him into his bed.

638
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:01,875
My poor mother
was banished to the guest room.

639
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:06,458
And not long after, she took her own life.

640
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:14,583
And I was the little boy who found her
with her wrists sliced open.

641
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:17,083
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

642
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:22,083
Well, there... there wasn't
much consolation from my father.

643
01:07:22,166 --> 01:07:24,708
In fact, he sent me away
to boarding school.

644
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,500
I didn't care. I was quite happy there.

645
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:29,833
In fact, it was better
to be away from him and that boy.

646
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:32,041
I hated that boy so much.

647
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:35,583
To think that he replaced
my mother and me.

648
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:39,875
Living in our house,
eating our food, breathing our air.

649
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:43,708
That... peasant.

650
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:47,291
Okay, that sounds kind of racist.

651
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:50,208
No. No, not at all, no.
If you knew anything about my career,

652
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:52,000
you'd know I'm anything but racist.

653
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:57,291
I really tried to be kind to him.
I really tried.

654
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:03,208
But I had this rage inside of me

655
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:06,333
that was very hard to suppress.

656
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:10,791
Well, maybe he was just a victim.

657
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,291
Maybe he was forced
to be in that situation by your dad.

658
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:19,125
Everyone has a choice.

659
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,708
Not when you're poor with nowhere to go.

660
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:45,125
Anyway, that's all in the past.

661
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:53,708
I only share this story
with very special people like you.

662
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:02,208
Do you want to know what happened to Ravi?

663
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:15,333
Sorry. Can I use the bathroom first?

664
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:19,708
Sure.

665
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:58,500
- What's the matter?
- Where are my shoes?

666
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:00,000
Oh, you don't look so good.

667
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:02,166
- No...
- Come and sit down.

668
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:04,833
No. No, no, no.
I think I really should go.

669
01:10:04,916 --> 01:10:08,125
It's okay. Just take a moment
and you can go.

670
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:10,416
Maybe you drank that too quickly.

671
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,250
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

672
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:21,000
Can I have some water, please?

673
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,208
Sure.

674
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:33,541
So, what...

675
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:36,083
What happened to Ravi?

676
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,583
I thought I'd killed him.

677
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:46,166
One summer when I came back from school,
I pounced on him like a savage beast.

678
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:48,666
Nearly destroyed his face.

679
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:52,375
It was so liberating, so empowering.

680
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:53,458
Hmm.

681
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,250
Almost transcendental.

682
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:23,083
Hey!

683
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:40,666
<i>Race, religion, sexual orientation,
and transgender identity.</i>

684
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:44,958
<i>Now, currently, there is a widely held
view among many in the legal profession,</i>

685
01:11:45,041 --> 01:11:48,416
<i>myself included,
that these sections of society</i>

686
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,708
<i>are not protected
by the criminal justice system equally...</i>

687
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:53,125
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

688
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:57,375
Bloody hell, Jay! Stop doing that or I'm
gonna have to take those keys back.

689
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:59,458
Sorry! I knocked and knocked, but...

690
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:01,708
I guess you couldn't hear me.

691
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,750
Are those Toby's?

692
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:07,708
Yeah.

693
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:16,166
Where have you been?
You don't answer my calls.

694
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,833
I even called your work,
and they said that you're takin' time off.

695
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:26,041
Cup of tea?

696
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:39,291
So, tell me, how are you?

697
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:42,458
Officially a dad now.

698
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:46,458
Really? When?

699
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,500
A few weeks ago.

700
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:53,041
- I'm so sorry. I should've got...
- Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't worry.

701
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:54,208
He came out early.

702
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,375
I guess my little man
couldn't wait to come out.

703
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,166
Well, that's amazing.

704
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:02,375
Congratulations.

705
01:13:12,875 --> 01:13:14,500
- What's his name?
- Who?

706
01:13:15,166 --> 01:13:16,750
- Your baby.
- Oh.

707
01:13:17,416 --> 01:13:18,416
Aydan.

708
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:20,541
Aydan.

709
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:22,041
Yeah.

710
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:27,500
Well, I'll have to come over and say hello
to baby Aydan, introduce myself.

711
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:29,291
Yeah, we'd love that.

712
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:34,083
I mean, you're probably the closest thing
to a gran he's ever gonna have.

713
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:41,791
Liz?

714
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:44,208
What's that?

715
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:50,000
That's Hector Blake.

716
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:54,250
He used to be part of the Law Commission,

717
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:57,000
championing equality
within the justice system.

718
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,916
Which is a joke.

719
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:03,791
But why are you watching it?

720
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:07,875
I'm studying him, I suppose.

721
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:12,500
Saint Blake is the devil
and nobody sees it.

722
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:15,375
I'm sure if that's true,
then the police will find out.

723
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:18,083
The police have already given up.

724
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:19,500
Maybe because he's clean.

725
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:23,083
Maybe because he's connected.

726
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:26,833
But obsessing over him online
ain't gonna get you anywhere.

727
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:28,291
I know.

728
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:32,708
I've been watching him
in the real world too. Not just online.

729
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:34,833
You're following him?

730
01:14:36,416 --> 01:14:38,375
- Oh, Liz...
- I know.

731
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:39,958
This is serious.

732
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,541
Last night, I watched a young man
hurl himself from Hector's window.

733
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:48,958
You should've seen the state of him.
He was completely incoherent at first.

734
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:51,791
He says that Hector invited him back
and spiked his drink.

735
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:56,791
He jumped out of a window to get away
from him. Thank God I was there.

736
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:00,541
Did you go to the police?

737
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:02,750
He didn't want to.

738
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:07,000
He's an asylum seeker.
He's afraid it will affect his case.

739
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:08,708
No, but he has to.

740
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:13,166
I know, but I can't push him. I'm trying
to persuade him, but he's scared.

741
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,708
I think he's right to be scared.

742
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:40,125
- What the fuck do you want?
- I brought your clothes back.

743
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:42,458
- I don't want them.
- Can we just talk?

744
01:15:42,541 --> 01:15:43,791
No. Leave me alone.

745
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:47,250
Your application for permanent settlement
in the UK.

746
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:50,541
I can stop it or expedite it.
You know I can.

747
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:57,625
Look, please just get in the car,
or do I have to shout through a window?

748
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:23,833
Good afternoon.

749
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,791
Please do feel free to return
if you have further questions.

750
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:32,166
- Thank you for your time.
- You're welcome.

751
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:36,625
- What happened?
- Let's go.

752
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:44,208
He's gone AWOL.
No one can get in touch with him.

753
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:45,291
So, what now?

754
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:47,458
I can't accept second-hand evidence.

755
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:50,500
This young man needs to make a statement
if I need to pursue further.

756
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:52,833
But you just said he's gone missing.

757
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:55,583
The guy's an asylum seeker.
He could have gone back home.

758
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:58,583
The whole point of seeking asylum
is that you can't go back home.

759
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:01,583
Isn't your job to protect people?

760
01:17:01,666 --> 01:17:04,541
It is. And I'm trying
to protect you, Lizzie.

761
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,041
What were you doing
outside Hector Blake's house anyway?

762
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,666
I think now I know
how Toby must have felt.

763
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,541
Please let me out. Come on!

764
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:35,541
Please let me out.

765
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,583
Why are you doing this to me?

766
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:46,208
Let me out of here!

767
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:57,833
Please let me out!

768
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:26,250
Hey, Faisal, can I call you back?

769
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:30,458
<i>Hi, Lizzie. I just wanted to say
I cracked the USB password.</i>

770
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:32,500
- Really?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

771
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,041
- What's on it?
<i>- I didn't look.</i>

772
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:37,416
<i>Client-counselor confidentiality,
you know?</i>

773
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:42,291
Hey, babe.

774
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:43,875
There he is.

775
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:49,416
Ah! Lizzie. It's good to see you.

776
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,500
You too.

777
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,541
Look what Lizzie brought for Aydan.

778
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:57,041
Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you, Liz.

779
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:00,541
You're welcome.
Hopefully, you can use it for a few years.

780
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:03,916
Oh!

781
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:05,666
Aah.

782
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,416
Oh, he's such a lovely boy.

783
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:10,000
Oh! Aye.

784
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:12,833
I know, you're so lovely!

785
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:15,166
Are you also a little bit stinky?

786
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:17,833
- Oh no.
- Oh! A little bit.

787
01:20:17,916 --> 01:20:19,083
A little bit!

788
01:20:19,166 --> 01:20:20,708
- Let me just go and change him.
- Aww.

789
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:34,333
So, how are things?

790
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:38,541
Liz?

791
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:49,000
We need to talk.

792
01:20:58,125 --> 01:21:02,791
I've been reading up on the "I Came By"
taggers. Isn't that what you call them?

793
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:06,833
How they break into rich people's homes
and spray-paint the walls.

794
01:21:12,625 --> 01:21:14,416
I knew you were hiding something.

795
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:17,458
How do you know that's me?

796
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:20,750
Jay.

797
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:22,625
Look.

798
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,333
That's you!

799
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:26,916
All right.

800
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:29,958
What you gonna do with these?

801
01:21:30,041 --> 01:21:32,583
Did you two
break into Hector Blake's house?

802
01:21:33,166 --> 01:21:34,166
No.

803
01:21:34,791 --> 01:21:36,041
No, I didn't.

804
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,625
No. I swear.

805
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:47,250
Did you tell Naz?

806
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:52,500
She already knows something's up.
I can feel it.

807
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:56,250
These photos won't prove shit
in Toby's case, okay?

808
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:58,666
It's just gonna come up
and fuck up my life.

809
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:05,250
I want you to help me
break into his house.

810
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:07,583
What? Hector Blake's?

811
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:10,541
I don't know if I can do it on my own.
You've clearly done this before.

812
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,375
Have you lost your mind?

813
01:22:12,458 --> 01:22:14,625
Technically, we wouldn't be breaking in.

814
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:17,333
We'd be using a key.
I saw him hiding one outside.

815
01:22:17,416 --> 01:22:18,833
Think about what you're saying.

816
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:21,583
Look, you just make sure
I get in all right.

817
01:22:21,666 --> 01:22:24,375
- You can just stand outside. Keep watch.
- No.

818
01:22:24,458 --> 01:22:27,416
No way. I can't risk it.
I've got to think about Aydan and Naz.

819
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:31,000
Fine. Fine. Then get out.

820
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,333
- Lizzie, come on.
- Go on. You coward!

821
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:34,583
- Look...
- Get out!

822
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:36,833
Look, calm down. Just...

823
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,958
We can't give up on Toby.

824
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:43,375
I'm not givin' up on him!

825
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:47,666
But, Liz, if I, a Black man, get caught,
I'll go down for years!

826
01:22:48,541 --> 01:22:49,541
You know that.

827
01:22:52,125 --> 01:22:53,125
Do it for me.

828
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,583
You owe me.

829
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:02,666
I came through for you
every time you needed me.

830
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:07,416
Every time your mum had
one of her new fellas knocking you around.

831
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,041
When she kicked you out.

832
01:23:10,791 --> 01:23:14,416
Toby and I have always been there for you.

833
01:23:16,416 --> 01:23:17,916
You've been family to me.

834
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:20,375
Yeah.

835
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,208
But...

836
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,208
I can't.

837
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,208
Just get out.

838
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:50,000
Where's Lizzie?

839
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:51,083
She's left.

840
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:52,875
Just like that?

841
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:54,875
Aydan asleep?

842
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:57,583
- What did she want, Jay?
- Hm?

843
01:24:03,166 --> 01:24:04,250
What did she want?

844
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:06,500
She came to see Aydan.

845
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:13,333
Do you have any respect for me?

846
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:17,583
Of course I do.

847
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:20,958
So, why do you act like I'm stupid?

848
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:24,958
- Wait, wait, wait...
- You did some work at Hector Blake's home.

849
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:28,041
And months later,
Toby shows up at our door, panicked,

850
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:29,958
the night before he goes missing.

851
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:36,250
Then I hear from Lizzie that Hector Blake
is a suspect in Toby's case.

852
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:40,333
- What mess have you got yourself into?
- No, no, no, no, no. No mess.

853
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:43,541
Listen, Jay, if I have to be
Aydan's entire family, I bloody will be.

854
01:24:44,916 --> 01:24:47,791
- Why are you saying that for?
- Because you're scaring me.

855
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:51,625
When my folks said
it's either them or you, I said "Fuck it."

856
01:24:51,708 --> 01:24:55,708
- Yes, because we love each other.
- But I feel like I'm on my own here.

857
01:24:55,791 --> 01:25:00,833
You think you just tattoo my initial
on your hand and that's it? Job done?

858
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:04,500
Naz, please. Everything I'm trying to do,
okay, it is for us.

859
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:06,666
There is no us
if you keep shutting me out!

860
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:07,934
I know, but...

861
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:09,000
No! Fuck off!

862
01:25:11,916 --> 01:25:14,000
Hey, baby. Hey...

863
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,125
No, stop!

864
01:28:04,208 --> 01:28:05,333
Hel...

865
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,500
It's for you.

866
01:28:26,833 --> 01:28:28,250
Go to Mummy.

867
01:28:29,708 --> 01:28:31,375
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

868
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:40,250
What is it?

869
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:42,208
Nothing.

870
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:44,833
Yeah.

871
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:47,166
Don't know why I bothered.

872
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:14,958
This is your doing.

873
01:29:19,416 --> 01:29:20,500
Where's my son?

874
01:29:21,791 --> 01:29:23,916
I flushed his ashes down the toilet.

875
01:29:40,916 --> 01:29:41,916
What?

876
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,833
I have to cut him up
to fit him in the kiln.

877
01:29:45,916 --> 01:29:47,500
You're smaller. It'll be easier.

878
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,291
<i>Hi, this is Elisabeth Nealey.</i>

879
01:29:56,375 --> 01:29:57,559
<i>- Leave a message.</i>
- Liz!

880
01:29:57,583 --> 01:30:00,000
<i>I will probably call you back.</i>

881
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:01,916
<i>Hey, Lizzie.</i>

882
01:30:02,583 --> 01:30:04,916
<i>It's Jay. Again.</i>

883
01:30:06,125 --> 01:30:08,041
<i>Look, this is probably, like,
the 15th message</i>

884
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:09,791
<i>I've left you over the past week.</i>

885
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:11,166
Liz?

886
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:13,458
<i>I've come over a few times.
You haven't been in.</i>

887
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:16,375
<i>In fact, I'm not even sure
you've been at home at all.</i>

888
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:20,416
<i>Look, I just wanna say
thank you for the package,</i>

889
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,750
<i>and I'm very sorry
for not telling you everything.</i>

890
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:28,541
<i>Please just give me the peace of mind
and let me know you're okay.</i>

891
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:44,291
I'm gonna stay with my friend Katie
for a few days. I'm taking Aydan with me.

892
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,875
Gives us time
to figure out who's moving out.

893
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:53,083
What's wrong?

894
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:56,125
It's just that...

895
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:01,500
Lizzie's gone, and...

896
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:05,083
it's... it's my fault.

897
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:08,583
- What?
- It's... it's my fucking fault.

898
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:10,250
Jay. Hey.

899
01:32:10,333 --> 01:32:12,083
Hey.

900
01:32:14,833 --> 01:32:16,916
Hey.

901
01:32:20,333 --> 01:32:24,208
Thanks very much, everyone.
See you next week. Have a great weekend!

902
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:42,958
Hey, Philip.

903
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,500
Hey.

904
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,750
What are you doing, crazy?

905
01:33:23,166 --> 01:33:25,375
Who is it?
It's Mummy. It's Mummy!

906
01:33:28,208 --> 01:33:29,791
- Hey.
- Hey.

907
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:36,250
- Are you gonna invite me in?
- Yeah. Sorry.

908
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:38,333
Hey, mister!

909
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:41,125
Oh!

910
01:33:41,208 --> 01:33:44,166
- How are you doing?
- He's excited to see his mummy.

911
01:33:44,916 --> 01:33:46,583
- How have you been?
- Yeah.

912
01:33:46,666 --> 01:33:49,166
Livin' it up. As you can see.

913
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:53,625
How's your dissertation coming along?

914
01:33:54,625 --> 01:33:55,791
Um...

915
01:33:56,666 --> 01:33:58,708
I wasn't sure if I should tell you.

916
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:01,208
Hector Blake's gonna read it.

917
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:05,875
Philip said their school's tercentenary
celebration's coming up

918
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:09,333
and he's gonna hand him a hard copy
when he sees him there.

919
01:34:12,416 --> 01:34:14,958
- How does he know he'll be there?
- He'll be there.

920
01:34:15,458 --> 01:34:17,833
He's donated shitloads to that school.

921
01:34:19,041 --> 01:34:21,875
They're paying him
some kind of tribute at the ceremony.

922
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:24,833
I hope this helps.

923
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:27,708
Thanks.

924
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:35,250
Hey, it's okay, mister. Come here.

925
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:37,583
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, shh.

926
01:34:37,666 --> 01:34:38,833
Shh, shh.

927
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:45,875
Please be careful. Okay?

928
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:49,291
Aydan needs his dad.

929
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:54,625
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

930
01:34:54,708 --> 01:34:56,208
Wait, wait! Naz!

931
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,541
Do you think, um...

932
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:04,041
Do you think me and you still have a shot?

933
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:07,750
I don't know, Jay.

934
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:36,000
"The world is in a bad state."

935
01:35:36,916 --> 01:35:42,958
"But everything will become still worse
unless each of us does his best."

936
01:35:43,041 --> 01:35:48,541
These are the words of the psychiatrist
and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl.

937
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:51,083
And in my opinion,

938
01:35:51,166 --> 01:35:56,166
they so aptly describe
Sir Hector's mission in life,

939
01:35:56,250 --> 01:36:01,291
for he is a man
who has never ceased to do his best.

940
01:36:02,458 --> 01:36:04,583
So, gentlemen, without further ado,

941
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:07,666
please welcome Sir Hector Blake!

942
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:09,350
- Yes!
- Yes! Hear, hear!

943
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,041
Yes.

944
01:36:18,125 --> 01:36:19,125
Thank you.

945
01:36:21,166 --> 01:36:24,541
Well, thank you, Headmaster,
for those kind words of introduction.

946
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:28,166
You know, I can remember
as if it was yesterday

947
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:32,416
my very first day as a boarder
here at Birlstone, at the junior school.

948
01:36:33,333 --> 01:36:36,125
A young boy, not yet ten years of age,

949
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:39,875
but knowing then that I'd found sanctuary.

950
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:44,166
And I must say,
it feels so good to be back home.

951
01:36:47,416 --> 01:36:49,333
- Well said.
- Very good.

952
01:41:59,666 --> 01:42:01,625
Hector! What did you do to them?

953
01:42:01,708 --> 01:42:04,166
What did you do to them?

954
01:42:05,291 --> 01:42:06,291
Tell me!

955
01:42:07,166 --> 01:42:08,166
Where are they?

956
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:10,375
Where are they?

957
01:43:01,041 --> 01:43:03,750
I've called the police,
and they'll be here soon.

958
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:05,333
Do you understand?

959
01:43:06,166 --> 01:43:07,750
Yeah?

960
01:43:08,375 --> 01:43:10,166
Okay, good.

961
01:43:10,958 --> 01:43:11,958
Can you walk?

962
01:43:13,291 --> 01:43:14,291
Good.

963
01:43:16,125 --> 01:43:18,666
Don't worry, you're safe now.

964
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:39,500

965
