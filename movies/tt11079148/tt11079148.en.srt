00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,603
<i>Rebmemer...</i>

3
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,677
<i>Remember, John.</i>

4
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:05,082
Remember.

5
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:11,856
Remember what?

6
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:14,724
That I love you.

7
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,896
Didn't think
that was in doubt, Zee.

8
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:34,678
I just wanted to say it,

9
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:37,348
- before...
- Before nothing.

10
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:38,615
The League will sort this out

11
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,885
and we'll be havin' pints
by sundown.

12
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:44,922
Or whatever that is
'round here.

13
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,103
I'm glad you joined the League.

14
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,837
I'm here for you, luv.

15
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:03,174
Just don't ask me
to wear a cape.

16
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,612
<i>All Justice League
members, report to the hangar, now.</i>

17
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,549
Way to cock-block, Batsy.

18
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:15,853
Well...

19
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:17,620
time to go.

20
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:32,036
Thank you
for responding so quickly.

21
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,772
Some of you already know
what this is about,

22
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:38,275
but I wanted to get
the new members up to speed.

23
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:41,312
This is Apokolips,

24
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,314
home world of Darkseid,

25
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:44,915
a power-mad despot

26
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:47,985
who has orchestrated two
attempted invasions of Earth,

27
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:51,288
the first of which resulted in the
formation of the Justice League.

28
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:54,158
The second one, an attack
from within our ranks

29
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:57,594
by Cyborg Superman
and his cyber force.

30
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:02,732
Raven, what's wrong?

31
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,970
It's nothing.

32
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:09,572
This image was taken
by surveillance

33
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,176
ten hours ago on the edge
of the solar system.

34
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:14,245
Apokolips phased into
our dimension

35
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:15,779
and released stealth drones,

36
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:17,248
then phased out again.

37
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:19,984
This can only be looked at
as a prelude to war.

38
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:21,785
Darkseid aims
to conquer the Earth

39
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:24,288
and crush it under his heel.

40
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:25,655
Regular Churchill, he is.

41
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,060
Look, I know the guy's
a genocidal maniac,

42
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,062
but are we sure those are
his immediate plans?

43
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,797
Or something he'll try in
like a thousand years?

44
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,802
These are images from worlds
that Darkseid has conquered.

45
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:40,770
<i>Our intel shows</i>

46
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:42,540
<i>that he's now sent
his elite guard</i>

47
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:43,807
<i>and the Furies to act</i>

48
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:45,675
as an occupying force

49
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:48,179
to thwart any resistance.

50
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:51,614
I want to make this
perfectly clear.

51
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:53,750
We are facing
an existential threat

52
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,286
to the planet.

53
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:59,056
We can't wait for Darkseid
to make the first move.

54
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:01,192
That could mean the end of us.

55
00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:05,062
We have to attack.

56
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:07,597
It's a tough job.

57
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,999
Aside from the big bad,

58
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:11,368
this place is jam-packed
with those Parademons.

59
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:13,404
The League's faced them before.

60
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:15,239
We know these are
their weak spots.

61
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,908
With our combined force,
we can cut through them.

62
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:19,910
Then, I'll do what needs
to be done.

63
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:21,644
This is madness.

64
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:24,148
There's always a deal
to be made.

65
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:27,218
Let's at least send
an envoy to Apokolips.

66
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:28,285
No!

67
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:35,126
Darkseid created a monster
that nearly killed me.

68
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,827
What chance
would humanity have?

69
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:41,432
Our only option
is to destroy him.

70
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:44,535
That means Earth could be
ground zero in a world war.

71
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:46,237
Look, I know some of you

72
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:49,607
don't believe the visions I had
about the Flashpoint, but...

73
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:51,308
a truly global war

74
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,012
means death and destruction
on a scale you cannot imagine.

75
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,747
Everyone on the planet
is at risk,

76
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:59,250
everyone we care about.

77
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,153
- Flash is right.
- John.

78
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,720
Sure, this guy
deserves killing,

79
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,222
but you can't kick
this hornet's nest

80
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:08,058
like everyone on Earth
is bulletproof.

81
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:12,263
Look, I won't ask you to give
anything more than I do.

82
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,797
But this isn't up
for discussion.

83
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:16,433
We're going to stop Darkseid

84
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,002
once and for all.

85
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:20,171
Here's how we do it.

86
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:23,607
The main team will attack

87
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:25,910
through this entryway
on Apokolips.

88
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:27,677
Members of the Titans shall
remain on Earth

89
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,013
as a home guard.

90
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:33,417
<i>With the Furies
and his elite guard off-world,</i>

91
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:35,818
<i>and only Parademons
to guard him,</i>

92
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:38,088
<i>Darkseid will be
vulnerable to attack.</i>

93
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,030
Honey, please
get somewhere safe.

94
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,566
<i>Clark, I have a job,
just like you.</i>

95
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:51,902
<i>I may not be able to fight this
war, but I can report the story.</i>

96
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:53,836
<i>Stop worrying.</i>

97
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,342
Just promise to be
as careful as you can.

98
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,444
<i>I will.</i>

99
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:02,012
<i>Now go save the world.</i>

100
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:04,315
I love you.

101
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:06,783
<i>I know.</i>

102
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:27,371
Nervous?

103
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:30,007
Nah.

104
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:31,875
Could use a ciggie, though.

105
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,213
Preparing Javelin
for inter-dimensional portal.

106
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:39,717
I got this, Bats.

107
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:40,851
Sit back and relax.

108
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:46,991
Booyah.

109
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:01,205
Lovely.

110
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:14,817
Picking up lifeform readings coming at us.

111
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:17,187
But they're too big
to be Parademons.

112
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:21,091
Then what the hell
are those things?

113
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:32,036
Bollocks.

114
00:08:40,537 --> 00:08:41,638
Bollocks.

115
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:46,410
And that's the last
of the Glen Luffa.

116
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:49,046
The Glens are full of whiskey,

117
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,682
I mean, lots of whiskey.

118
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:53,617
Ooh. Ah.

119
00:08:57,321 --> 00:09:00,157
The "H"s are gonna be a breeze
after the "G"s.

120
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:03,293
Too many bloody "Glens."

121
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:05,696
You hear that?

122
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:08,399
Still cryin' in your beer, eh?

123
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,001
Eat yer heart out!

124
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:13,437
Hello, my old friend,
Glen Magoogan.

125
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:26,116
We need him.

126
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:32,022
We're doomed.

127
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,658
John Constantine.

128
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:38,962
I'm glad we found you.

129
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:42,099
Find yer own pub.

130
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,301
We're drinking our way
through this one.

131
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:48,005
In fact, the whole street's
ours, pub-wise, so sod off.

132
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:50,174
John, it's me.

133
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:53,243
Clark Kent.

134
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,546
You knew me as Superman.

135
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,858
Oh, it is you.

136
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:08,692
I thought you'd snuffed it.

137
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:14,965
Oh, bloody hell!

138
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,333
Now you've done it.

139
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,670
John, wait.

140
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:20,971
We're not here to fight.

141
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:28,078
You come
to the wrong place, then.

142
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,815
<i>Azarath Metrion...</i>

143
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:34,585
Stop!

144
00:10:36,753 --> 00:10:37,621
Stop it!

145
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:45,762
Quit playin' around, boy scout!
Smash 'em!

146
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:47,364
I can't!

147
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,604
Bloody useless, both of you.

148
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:05,950
A little help would be nice.

149
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:22,833
Ugh!

150
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:24,401
Bloody nuisance.

151
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:32,809
Last call, asshole.

152
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,183
And I'm sober again.

153
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,653
Magic can be such a bitch.

154
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,128
Gift from Darkseid?

155
00:11:51,996 --> 00:11:53,530
Liquid Kryptonite...

156
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:55,632
to keep me
from ever being a threat.

157
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:58,502
So he let you live

158
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:01,438
to wander about
demoralizing everyone.

159
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,976
Impressive.

160
00:12:05,043 --> 00:12:08,612
Stop it, please.

161
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,480
She gets like this,
sometimes.

162
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:17,956
<i>I will exact vengeance
on you, daughter!</i>

163
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:19,023
<i>Release me,</i>

164
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,625
<i>ungrateful spawn of mine!</i>

165
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,495
That's what she hears
all the time.

166
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:27,999
No wonder she's always in pain,

167
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,133
and her healing powers
don't work.

168
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,301
John,

169
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:33,170
where are you going? We have...

170
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:35,472
A plan
to save the world, right?

171
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:38,675
And this time
it will definitely work.

172
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:40,310
Bugger off, Clarkie.

173
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,281
I told you he was
a waste of time.

174
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:45,749
All cowards are.

175
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,855
I didn't lead us all
into a massacre!

176
00:12:50,922 --> 00:12:52,356
You did!

177
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:55,059
Zatanna was a hero
who fought bravely.

178
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,327
But where were you
when she needed you most?

179
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:06,169
Ah, piss off, both of you.

180
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,376
Zatanna would want you
to hear us out.

181
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:16,613
Below the belt, boy scout.

182
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:20,918
More Parademons will be by.

183
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:22,452
Come with if you want.

184
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:24,554
Or not.

185
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:26,823
What about you, Etrigan?

186
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,362
Ugh! Whatever.

187
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,374
Love what you've
done with the place.

188
00:13:46,643 --> 00:13:49,346
What better metaphor
for merry old England today?

189
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:51,949
Drink?

190
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:54,651
You can use the good glasses.

191
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,961
Been all mopey ever since
a friend of his died.

192
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:05,796
Doesn't even rhyme anymore.

193
00:14:06,797 --> 00:14:08,665
What's the point?

194
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:14,271
Look, are you going to help us
or not?

195
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:17,175
Saving your asses in the bar
didn't count, eh?

196
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,911
Offering whiskey
in an unbroken glass?

197
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:21,913
Bloody ingrates, you are.

198
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,881
So,

199
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:25,849
it was crap from the start,

200
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,551
but what went wrong, eh?

201
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,486
Tell me what happened.

202
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:37,895
<i>Darkseid knew
every part of our plan.</i>

203
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:41,264
<i>Those things
that attacked us were</i>

204
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,633
<i>half Parademon, half Doomsday.</i>

205
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,073
<i>Barry and Hal fought hard,</i>

206
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,507
<i>but were taken down.</i>

207
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,381
<i>The rest of us
didn't last much longer.</i>

208
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:08,226
<i>Shazam was wounded,</i>

209
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,027
<i>but Cyborg helped him escape.</i>

210
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:26,244
No!

211
00:15:35,086 --> 00:15:37,287
<i>Darkseid didn't
kill everyone.</i>

212
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,891
<i>Some, he had plans for.</i>

213
00:15:57,942 --> 00:16:00,477
A few days later,
Darkseid sent those...

214
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,512
"Paradooms" to Earth.

215
00:16:03,247 --> 00:16:04,681
We didn't have a chance.

216
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,784
Does it hurt?

217
00:16:12,756 --> 00:16:14,091
Good.

218
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:15,259
Even without powers,

219
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:16,626
Clark is still fighting.

220
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:18,695
You couldn't be
bothered to do it once.

221
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:30,707
John!

222
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:46,123
<i>Don't know why I ran.</i>

223
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:49,559
Been up against
all sorts of bastards

224
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:51,996
and I always stood tall.

225
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:53,697
But this time I just ran.

226
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,566
Why did I do that?

227
00:16:57,134 --> 00:16:58,035
Why?

228
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:07,011
What do you need me for anyway?

229
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:09,846
The magic you have left
works just as good as mine.

230
00:17:09,914 --> 00:17:11,916
We just need a locator spell.

231
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:16,020
A locator spell?

232
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:18,622
And then you'll toddle off,
will ya?

233
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:20,790
Fine.

234
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:27,265
I need some gear, so sit tight.

235
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:28,598
Etrigan,

236
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:30,134
continue loafing.

237
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,003
Done.

238
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,587
The third planet reaper
is on the Earth's surface.

239
00:18:24,654 --> 00:18:26,857
Boring to the magma core
has begun.

240
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,126
With that ordnance,

241
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,527
the guardians of Oa

242
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:32,964
will be forced
to bow before me,

243
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,367
and the entire space sector
will be mine.

244
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:39,669
Why was this not
completed earlier?

245
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:41,439
The damage done
to the Apokolips reactor

246
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:44,875
- during the attack two years ago...
- Your attack.

247
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,844
My solution
is working,

248
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:49,013
but the power generated is

249
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,115
less than
your previous reactor.

250
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:54,852
Perhaps my mind-molding

251
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,889
didn't fully transform you
into a capable servant.

252
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:02,759
Perhaps you'd serve me
better as a mindless drone.

253
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:07,064
I am still your most
competent acolyte,

254
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:08,265
Lord Darkseid.

255
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,336
Your former teammate, Luthor,

256
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:14,038
believes otherwise.

257
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:16,374
Not surprising.

258
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,343
Luthor's only interest
is saving his own skin.

259
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,679
I only perform my duties
at your pleasure, my liege.

260
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:26,350
I won't stand
for further delays.

261
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,085
After all,

262
00:19:28,152 --> 00:19:30,988
a conqueror must conquer.

263
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:41,765
Hmm.

264
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:43,666
I thought there'd be fire.

265
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:46,037
Only when I fart.

266
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,272
<i>We need
to reassess the situation.</i>

267
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:50,607
<i>Gather our forces
to a new location.</i>

268
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:52,842
<i>Another one just
landed in China.</i>

269
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,412
Any idea what they're for?

270
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:55,712
<i>No.</i>

271
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,148
<i>But whatever it is
can't be good.</i>

272
00:19:57,214 --> 00:19:58,581
<i>We need to come up
with a new strat...</i>

273
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,819
Oh, no, come on.

274
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:04,889
Let's get you
on your way, then.

275
00:20:11,495 --> 00:20:12,796
Who am I finding?

276
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:14,899
Damian Wayne.

277
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,302
Are you bloody daft, mate?

278
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:21,505
And how exactly does
the baby bat help?

279
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:22,772
What do you care?

280
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:25,842
Cheers, then.

281
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:42,860
Okay,

282
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:45,795
since I don't have a stocked
magical pantry anymore,

283
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:47,664
I have to conjure a portal
from scratch

284
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,467
big enough for all of us.

285
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:51,402
Hmm, ten hours, give or take.

286
00:20:51,469 --> 00:20:53,670
Oh, and everyone has
to stay still while I do it.

287
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:55,339
Oh, for fuck's sake.

288
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:57,607
- <i>Azarath Metrion Zinthos!</i>
- Raven, no, you're too weak...

289
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:10,254
I... I didn't mean
to imply anything of the sort.

290
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:13,090
When Lord Darkseid asked
if I could do your job,

291
00:21:13,157 --> 00:21:15,658
I answered,
"Maybe one day" but...

292
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:17,361
<i>Luthor, stop sniveling.</i>

293
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,132
<i>Continue your report.</i>

294
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,733
Yes, Batman.

295
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,503
The last
of Earth's resources are

296
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,338
being transferred to Apokolips.

297
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:30,608
Everything will go according
to Darkseid's schedule.

298
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:33,544
Um, do you know if

299
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:36,280
I'm included
in His Lordship's plans?

300
00:21:36,347 --> 00:21:40,683
In a future where I'm alive
to serve you both?

301
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,321
<i>My business is ensuring that
Darkseid's vision is executed</i>

302
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:45,523
<i>so his reign spreads</i>

303
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:47,757
<i>to every corner of the galaxy.</i>

304
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,395
<i>Don't worry about your place
in those plans.</i>

305
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:53,830
<i>Worry about doing
what I tell you.</i>

306
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:56,534
Of course, Batman.

307
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,800
<i>Mmm.</i>

308
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,360
The infidels have breached
our sanctuary!

309
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:24,361
Slay them!

310
00:22:28,332 --> 00:22:29,799
Are you happy now?

311
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:31,135
Assassins!

312
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:36,839
Some challenge.

313
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:38,775
Yawn.

314
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:43,480
Ow!

315
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:03,901
Etrigan the Slayer is here.

316
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:06,470
Woe to you. And you.

317
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:09,273
You also.

318
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:13,177
Die, demon!

319
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:21,619
Whatever.

320
00:23:28,926 --> 00:23:30,127
Enough!

321
00:23:48,312 --> 00:23:49,179
Hi.

322
00:23:51,282 --> 00:23:52,483
You.

323
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:55,486
Damian, please listen to him.

324
00:23:57,154 --> 00:23:58,656
What's wrong with her?

325
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:00,591
How long have you got, mate?

326
00:24:00,658 --> 00:24:02,159
I know you hate me,

327
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:04,395
but I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't necessary.

328
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,800
I'll let you live.

329
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,102
For now.

330
00:24:18,475 --> 00:24:19,977
I like him.

331
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,356
Come on.

332
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:39,029
<i>Ungrateful witch!</i>

333
00:24:39,096 --> 00:24:41,865
- <i>I will exact vengeance on you, daughter!</i>
- No.

334
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:44,435
- I won't let you.
- Release me!

335
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:45,436
Never.

336
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:52,309
It's only a matter
of time now, little bird.

337
00:24:53,944 --> 00:24:56,413
Only a matter of time.

338
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:00,184
You're not getting out, Father.

339
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,553
I have the will to do
what must be done.

340
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:09,993
Impudent daughter!

341
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,195
If you die,

342
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,330
I am trapped in this hell.

343
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:15,032
Free me!

344
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:17,568
Remember what I told you.

345
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:19,570
Release me

346
00:25:19,636 --> 00:25:22,172
or I will kill the boy.

347
00:25:31,014 --> 00:25:32,649
Is there a way
to cure her?

348
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:38,322
You get Trigon out, and yeah,
she'd recover

349
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,257
- but...
- But he destroys the world.

350
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:50,768
Did you get any rest?

351
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:51,902
Enough.

352
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:53,570
Then come with me.

353
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,877
You too, Kent.

354
00:25:58,942 --> 00:26:02,212
I want you to see what this war
has cost my family.

355
00:26:04,748 --> 00:26:07,684
Steal anything
and I'll cut your hands off.

356
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:14,691
Oh, I really like him.

357
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:23,233
I feared your plan
would fail from the beginning.

358
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,069
An army without killers
is no army at all.

359
00:26:26,136 --> 00:26:28,038
But Batman believed in you.

360
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,275
You cost me my father.

361
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:33,410
<i>And my teammates.</i>

362
00:26:37,648 --> 00:26:39,049
<i>I won't forgive that.</i>

363
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:06,878
Nightwing convinced me

364
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:09,379
not to voice
my many objections.

365
00:27:09,446 --> 00:27:11,982
"There are always
risks in war," he said.

366
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:16,720
He's not saying that anymore.

367
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,902
You used the Lazarus Pit.

368
00:27:30,969 --> 00:27:32,236
You said you wouldn't.

369
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,371
You promised.

370
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:38,141
He was my brother.

371
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,110
I had to take a chance.

372
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:44,314
It just didn't work.

373
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:47,084
We can't let what happened

374
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,453
to Dick and everyone else be
in vain.

375
00:27:50,354 --> 00:27:51,722
Help us fix things.

376
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:53,190
How?

377
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:54,658
You're powerless now.

378
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:57,194
We need you
to get through to Batman.

379
00:27:57,261 --> 00:27:59,830
You can break
Darkseid's programming.

380
00:27:59,898 --> 00:28:01,131
You grossly overestimate

381
00:28:01,198 --> 00:28:03,367
the influence I have
on my father.

382
00:28:04,234 --> 00:28:06,036
Batman cares about you.

383
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,073
Even awful parents
care about their kids.

384
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:12,643
I should know.

385
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:15,579
I was there when Bruce
learned about Dick's death.

386
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:16,813
It affected him.

387
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:18,181
It almost got through.

388
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:24,521
He overcame
my mother's brainwashing once.

389
00:28:24,588 --> 00:28:27,190
If anyone could
survive Darkseid's programming,

390
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:28,458
it'd be father.

391
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,427
So you'll try?

392
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:34,197
It's my responsibility
to save him,

393
00:28:34,264 --> 00:28:36,733
or barring that,
kill him if he can't be saved.

394
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:40,604
He would want that.

395
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,742
But the only way to Apokolips
is to use the boom tube

396
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,311
in LexCorp Tower.

397
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:49,246
How do you expect to do that?

398
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:06,296
You're getting worse.

399
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:08,532
Ugh. Great pep talk.

400
00:29:09,934 --> 00:29:11,268
Here, let me help.

401
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:19,242
Lois said she was negotiating
with their leader.

402
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:20,577
She's a people person,

403
00:29:20,644 --> 00:29:23,014
so I'm sure
the situation's well in...

404
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:24,615
...hand.

405
00:29:33,657 --> 00:29:34,725
Nice hook.

406
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:35,860
Where'd you pick that up?

407
00:29:36,928 --> 00:29:38,428
I'm an army brat.

408
00:29:38,495 --> 00:29:41,665
Well, no one out-brats me.

409
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:46,570
Yeah. Ha-ha.

410
00:29:46,637 --> 00:29:47,939
Lois?

411
00:29:48,006 --> 00:29:50,340
- Lois!
- She looks like she can handle herself.

412
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:52,110
Come on, Harley, have at her!

413
00:29:52,175 --> 00:29:53,945
Nothing like having a cold one

414
00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:55,947
while a couple of fine sheilas
beat each other bloody, eh, mate?

415
00:29:56,014 --> 00:29:57,547
Beer?

416
00:29:58,749 --> 00:30:00,350
Break her face...

417
00:30:01,085 --> 00:30:02,686
Clark's wife!

418
00:30:02,753 --> 00:30:04,022
Ugh. Brits.

419
00:30:04,088 --> 00:30:05,155
Aussies.

420
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:06,891
- Poms.
- Convicts.

421
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,059
- Wankers.
- Wankers.

422
00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:09,660
Do your best, honey!

423
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:17,300
Ha-ha!

424
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,738
You've got to be kidding.

425
00:30:21,805 --> 00:30:23,240
Always!

426
00:30:23,306 --> 00:30:25,342
Harley, come on!

427
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:47,798
I tawt I taw a puddy tat.

428
00:30:49,232 --> 00:30:51,234
Ooh!

429
00:30:55,873 --> 00:30:57,507
Way to go, ya beauty!

430
00:30:57,574 --> 00:30:59,810
And the winner
and new champion,

431
00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:01,578
luscious Lois Lane!

432
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,953
Captain Boomerang
at your service.

433
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,587
Have I mentioned that I'm, uh,

434
00:31:10,654 --> 00:31:12,823
quite experienced "down under,"
if ya know what I mean?

435
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:16,793
No means no, Boomerang!

436
00:31:17,895 --> 00:31:18,896
All right, lady.

437
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:20,831
Looks like we've got a deal.

438
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:22,632
Listen up, everybody!

439
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:25,069
Now we ride for Lex Luthor

440
00:31:25,136 --> 00:31:28,005
in his fortress of bald-itude.

441
00:31:28,072 --> 00:31:29,272
So drink up,

442
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:31,175
esteemed ladies and gents

443
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:33,211
of the Suicide Squad,

444
00:31:33,276 --> 00:31:35,245
because tomorrow

445
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:38,149
we take back this planet!

446
00:31:45,957 --> 00:31:47,724
Why do you always
lead with your chin?

447
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,994
I learned
from the best.

448
00:31:51,695 --> 00:31:52,629
Ow!

449
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,970
Oh, bollocks, it's my ex.

450
00:31:59,036 --> 00:32:00,303
You and Harley?

451
00:32:01,072 --> 00:32:02,272
Gross.

452
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,774
Do I look mad?

453
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:14,584
How did Amanda Waller
let a lunatic like you

454
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:16,486
become leader of the Squad?

455
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:19,289
Easy. She died.

456
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:20,590
Cancer!

457
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:31,301
Sorry.
It's a defense mechanism.

458
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:34,138
King Shark

459
00:32:34,205 --> 00:32:35,639
is a shark.

460
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:40,310
A week after that,
my puddin' died.

461
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,345
Thanks to new Batman,

462
00:32:42,412 --> 00:32:44,916
who is no fun, by the way.

463
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:46,817
So, me and my merry band

464
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,586
of suicidals
decided to go freelance.

465
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:51,655
We've been taking our cut
from Luthor's supply trains

466
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,590
since this shitshow started.

467
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:57,028
We're real Robin Hood-types.

468
00:32:57,094 --> 00:33:00,463
Rob from the rich
and sell to the poor.

469
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,966
"Give to the poor."

470
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:03,466
Huh?

471
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:04,801
That can't be right.

472
00:33:05,802 --> 00:33:07,305
Do you have somewhere private?

473
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,772
You need to see this.

474
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:10,274
My office.

475
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,245
We'll discuss everything over
my top-notch bottle of hooch.

476
00:33:14,312 --> 00:33:15,947
Now we're talking.

477
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:20,417
No! I won't let you!

478
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:21,953
Never!

479
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:25,822
I think I need a minute.

480
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,691
Is there a place we could rest?

481
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:31,095
Oh, is that what you kids are
callin' it these days?

482
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,599
Cheetah'll show you the way.

483
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,367
I don't like kids.

484
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:39,070
Sticky hands.

485
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:52,549
Shut up.

486
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,687
Sorry.

487
00:33:57,754 --> 00:34:00,091
Sometimes he gets so loud
I have to answer.

488
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:03,526
You probably think I'm weak.

489
00:34:04,362 --> 00:34:05,695
Raven,

490
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:07,831
you're one of
the strongest people I know.

491
00:34:12,502 --> 00:34:14,537
So, how'd you end up with Kent?

492
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:17,641
You left and I was alone.

493
00:34:20,344 --> 00:34:22,079
<i>I just wanted to end the pain.</i>

494
00:34:46,436 --> 00:34:48,471
I'm sorry for not
coming with you.

495
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:51,943
When I asked you to join me

496
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:54,145
in leading
the League of Assassins,

497
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:56,746
I wasn't doing it
because you're a good fighter,

498
00:34:57,348 --> 00:34:58,215
I...

499
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:01,085
I had feelings for you.

500
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,521
If you didn't,
you made the right decision.

501
00:35:05,622 --> 00:35:07,524
It wasn't that at all.

502
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,094
I left because my father
wants to kill you.

503
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:12,595
After everything,

504
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:14,131
I couldn't risk that.

505
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:36,087
Darkseid's machines
have gone online in the Congo,

506
00:35:36,153 --> 00:35:39,023
China, and off the coast
of England.

507
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:42,159
What the heck are they?

508
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:45,029
They phase the Earth's
magma into Darkseid's base.

509
00:35:46,163 --> 00:35:48,899
So these things
must be destroyed.

510
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:50,901
That's a temporary solution.

511
00:35:50,968 --> 00:35:53,037
We need to blow up Apokolips.

512
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,638
Oh, is that all?

513
00:35:55,705 --> 00:35:56,874
Piece of cake.

514
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:59,143
We can't brute-force this.

515
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:02,446
On Apokolips,
Darkseid has Paradooms.

516
00:36:02,512 --> 00:36:05,149
Parademons upgraded with
Superman's DNA,

517
00:36:06,183 --> 00:36:07,650
like Doomsday was.

518
00:36:07,717 --> 00:36:09,420
Don't rub it in, honey.

519
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:12,589
We have to get them off of
Apokolips to have any chance.

520
00:36:13,623 --> 00:36:14,992
To do that, we plan on mounting

521
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:18,496
simultaneous attacks
on two of the machines.

522
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:19,796
That should cause the Paradooms

523
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:22,532
to be sent to Earth
as reinforcements.

524
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,135
Why not attack all three?

525
00:36:25,403 --> 00:36:29,073
We don't have enough people.

526
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,609
If the two teams do enough
damage, we'll be fine.

527
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:35,712
The boom tube gate is
located in LexCorp Tower.

528
00:36:38,648 --> 00:36:40,583
That's where we come in.

529
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,986
We take the tower.

530
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:44,687
Our strike team
transports to Apokolips,

531
00:36:44,754 --> 00:36:46,790
sets its power generator
to go critical,

532
00:36:46,857 --> 00:36:48,225
reverses the boom tubes,

533
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:50,494
bringing all the Paradooms
back to Apokolips,

534
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,229
then we get out
before it blows up.

535
00:36:53,264 --> 00:36:56,599
Easy peasy, rich n' cheesy.
Ha-ha!

536
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:59,702
King Shark is a shark.

537
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:02,572
Aren't you forgetting
one small detail,

538
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,808
name of Darkseid?

539
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:07,378
"Warm beer, soggy chips" here
is right.

540
00:37:07,445 --> 00:37:09,113
We can't take him.

541
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,514
No one can.

542
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,349
Darkseid is going to Oa.

543
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:14,518
We only begin after he's gone.

544
00:37:14,584 --> 00:37:18,155
Once we're there, we shut down
the portal so he can't come back.

545
00:37:18,222 --> 00:37:21,025
Without Apokolips,
he can't destroy Earth.

546
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:23,693
How do you know he'll be gone?

547
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,130
Did you steal his diary?

548
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:29,300
I have a source in Darkseid's
camp called "Sleeper."

549
00:37:29,366 --> 00:37:32,903
He or she has been slipping me
information for months.

550
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,972
No wonder you and Kent
are together.

551
00:37:35,973 --> 00:37:38,342
You're both gullible fools.

552
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:40,277
Darkseid is playing you.

553
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,012
Or Batman is.

554
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,613
The information
from Lois' source

555
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,118
has led to every victory
we've had since the conquest.

556
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:50,287
You have a strange concept
of "victory," mate.

557
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:53,924
The planet's molten core
will be gone in a week.

558
00:37:53,991 --> 00:37:56,560
Then it's game over.

559
00:37:56,626 --> 00:38:00,663
I know this plan has astronomical
risks and impossible odds,

560
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,099
but we're out of time.

561
00:38:04,935 --> 00:38:08,606
Blah, blah, blah.
Let's do this thing!

562
00:38:18,282 --> 00:38:20,750
Hi, we need your van.

563
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:31,095
Ah, crikey. That's not right.

564
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:43,706
Yeah, g'day.

565
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:50,114
My friend here was
attacked by thugs.

566
00:38:50,181 --> 00:38:52,116
We killed 'em right back. Yup.

567
00:38:52,183 --> 00:38:54,251
Yes, siree Bob. You betcha.

568
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:56,587
Gotta get my friend to a doc. How are you?

569
00:38:56,654 --> 00:38:57,720
Can we go?

570
00:39:07,198 --> 00:39:09,633
Lord Darkseid,
reports indicate that

571
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:11,734
the lanterns
have mostly fallen.

572
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:12,870
Good.

573
00:39:14,038 --> 00:39:17,474
I go to claim Oa for my empire.

574
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,610
Any remaining resistance

575
00:39:19,677 --> 00:39:21,844
shall not be a problem.

576
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:25,983
Do not interrupt me.

577
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:28,818
Yes, master.

578
00:39:47,938 --> 00:39:50,441
It's Sleeper. Darkseid's gone.

579
00:39:50,507 --> 00:39:53,143
I'm sending the signal
to attack the machines.

580
00:39:54,511 --> 00:39:56,213
<i>China team has engaged.</i>

581
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:08,325
North Sea team engaged.

582
00:40:08,392 --> 00:40:10,561
Orchid's with them, John.

583
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:13,864
Wonder where she went after she
kicked me out of the house.

584
00:40:35,586 --> 00:40:37,054
<i>Why have
the rebels been able</i>

585
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:39,590
<i>to stage these attacks
on our reapers?</i>

586
00:40:39,657 --> 00:40:40,991
How the hell should I know?

587
00:40:41,058 --> 00:40:44,061
I don't do security
for the entire Earth.

588
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:45,795
Isn't that your job?

589
00:40:46,664 --> 00:40:48,299
<i>Hmm.</i>

590
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:50,301
I say that
with all due respect.

591
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,506
<i>Stand ready to
transport the Paradooms.</i>

592
00:40:57,074 --> 00:40:58,509
On your mark.

593
00:41:00,077 --> 00:41:01,478
What's wrong?

594
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:03,113
I'm not getting a signal
that any of the Paradooms

595
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,748
have left Apokolips.

596
00:41:04,814 --> 00:41:06,650
- Another debacle.
- Damian.

597
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:07,985
We should have waited,

598
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:09,386
we should have gathered
a third force.

599
00:41:09,453 --> 00:41:10,621
This is my fault.

600
00:41:10,688 --> 00:41:11,821
I'll sort this.

601
00:41:21,432 --> 00:41:22,800
You here?

602
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:26,337
I thought I'd pop by to discuss
fertilizer and the such.

603
00:41:33,143 --> 00:41:35,446
There you are, Swampy.

604
00:41:35,512 --> 00:41:38,949
You are wiser than I
give you credit for.

605
00:41:39,016 --> 00:41:41,752
Well, not a high bar, I gather.

606
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:44,288
One day, Constantine.

607
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:45,589
One day.

608
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:47,257
You're leaving already?

609
00:41:47,324 --> 00:41:48,926
But just know that
this thing here

610
00:41:48,992 --> 00:41:51,528
will be the death
of your precious green.

611
00:41:58,102 --> 00:41:59,236
It...

612
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:02,272
steals the heart of the planet?

613
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:06,276
And you, you walking salad,
you didn't notice, did you?

614
00:42:06,343 --> 00:42:09,780
Just happy that half the people
on the planet are dead, eh?

615
00:42:09,847 --> 00:42:13,283
The humans earned their fate.

616
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:16,420
By that logic
the green has it coming, too.

617
00:42:16,487 --> 00:42:19,156
Like humanity,
it was minding its own business

618
00:42:19,223 --> 00:42:22,659
and, oh, too bad,
death sentence.

619
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:26,397
The green

620
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:29,666
will not die!

621
00:42:41,211 --> 00:42:43,347
Swampy's pretty pissed.

622
00:42:43,414 --> 00:42:46,083
That should bring down
the flyin' uglies.

623
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:49,653
It worked.

624
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,889
Harley, you're up.

625
00:42:50,954 --> 00:42:52,456
<i>Yahtzee!</i>

626
00:42:53,056 --> 00:42:54,324
<i>And out.</i>

627
00:42:55,526 --> 00:42:57,327
No more planning,

628
00:42:57,394 --> 00:42:58,529
just doing.

629
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:05,469
Is there no end
to these minions?

630
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:30,862
<i>♪ If you're happy And you
know it Smash a head ♪</i>

631

<i>♪ If you're happy And you

638

Best boss ever.

639
00:43:59,823 --> 00:44:02,059
King Shark is a shark.

640
00:44:07,866 --> 00:44:10,000
I need a cigarette.

641
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,575
<i>Azarath Metrion Zinthos!</i>

642
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:24,214
Rest well, Shiva.

643
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:37,160
We sent
the Paradooms to help you!

644
00:44:37,227 --> 00:44:39,730
<i>But sir,
they're eating everyone!</i>

645
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,138
HR is going to be furious.

646
00:45:05,355 --> 00:45:06,958
Ah, we're sitting ducks here.

647
00:45:07,025 --> 00:45:08,692
I love duckies.

648
00:45:09,293 --> 00:45:11,128
Worst team ever.

649
00:45:11,194 --> 00:45:12,763
The boom tube gate is there.

650
00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:14,866
One floor up. No stairs.

651
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:16,633
This way. Keep it moving, gang.

652
00:45:18,068 --> 00:45:20,170
You said this would be hard.

653
00:45:20,237 --> 00:45:22,105
It's not hard.

654
00:45:29,914 --> 00:45:33,116
I'm afraid you don't have
the proper clearance.

655
00:45:34,018 --> 00:45:35,752
Ah, bollocks.

656
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:42,326
Damian!

657
00:45:52,803 --> 00:45:54,838
No one
will mourn you!

658
00:45:56,773 --> 00:45:58,141
Raven, no!

659
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:00,044
Stay in control.

660
00:46:11,622 --> 00:46:14,524
Can everyone stop trying
to kill Luthor?

661
00:46:14,591 --> 00:46:15,459
We need him.

662
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:17,561
He's a stinking collaborator.

663
00:46:17,628 --> 00:46:18,729
Too right, he is.

664
00:46:18,795 --> 00:46:20,597
Let me take a little
off the top.

665
00:46:21,298 --> 00:46:22,633
Please,

666
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:24,869
I was surrounded
and the battle was over.

667
00:46:24,936 --> 00:46:26,536
I had to make a choice.

668
00:46:26,603 --> 00:46:28,805
I've been helping
Lois ever since.

669
00:46:29,806 --> 00:46:31,808
You're Sleeper?

670
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:33,077
He's a traitor

671
00:46:33,143 --> 00:46:34,879
who changed sides
when it suited him.

672
00:46:34,946 --> 00:46:37,882
What makes you think
he won't do it again?

673
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:42,020
Because you need me and you
don't have a lot of time.

674
00:46:42,086 --> 00:46:43,921
Batman won't allow it.

675
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,965
Abomination!

676
00:46:54,032 --> 00:46:56,433
You will stand

677
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,769
no more!

678
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:12,716
The Congo reaper is a loss.

679
00:47:12,783 --> 00:47:16,687
Concentrate the forces on the
North Sea and Great Wall reapers.

680
00:47:44,148 --> 00:47:45,649
Shazam!

681
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:00,697
You'll take care of it,
won't you?

682
00:48:02,332 --> 00:48:04,902
If my father gets control.

683
00:48:04,969 --> 00:48:07,972
You want me to add your soul
to my ledger?

684
00:48:09,272 --> 00:48:10,707
The spell has to be...

685
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:12,342
ugly.

686
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:14,578
My body has to be
more than dead.

687
00:48:20,118 --> 00:48:23,487
The last accursed
Dagger of Ostova.

688
00:48:23,553 --> 00:48:26,057
Good. That'll work.

689
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:27,357
Keep Daddy in his pen

690
00:48:27,424 --> 00:48:29,359
and we won't have
to go down that road.

691
00:48:30,393 --> 00:48:31,595
I'm strong.

692
00:48:32,262 --> 00:48:33,430
I can do it.

693
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:46,443
This thing's kind of stuffy.

694
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,779
Hon, you wear two layers
in the summer.

695
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:49,846
You'll live.

696
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:52,749
My finest work.

697
00:48:52,816 --> 00:48:54,518
Fires
kryptonite-infused missiles

698
00:48:54,584 --> 00:48:56,854
and high-explosive rounds.

699
00:48:56,921 --> 00:48:59,322
Perfect for Paradooms.

700
00:48:59,389 --> 00:49:01,491
But you made it
to kill my husband.

701
00:49:01,558 --> 00:49:03,961
What can I say, I had issues.

702
00:49:06,429 --> 00:49:08,431
That's a whole lot
of kryptonite.

703
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,391
We'll hold this end.

704
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:36,359
Lois, you...

705
00:49:36,426 --> 00:49:39,362
Someone has to make sure
the portal stays closed.

706
00:49:39,429 --> 00:49:40,932
- But you need to...
- Hey...

707
00:49:41,665 --> 00:49:42,967
we're in this together.

708
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:47,104
I love you, Lois Lane.

709
00:49:48,471 --> 00:49:49,539
I know.

710
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,945
Now, go save the world.

711
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:55,980
Touching.

712
00:49:56,047 --> 00:49:59,217
Now, can we leave before I
come to my bloody senses?

713
00:49:59,283 --> 00:50:01,484
Why are you still here, John?

714
00:50:01,551 --> 00:50:04,387
Don't exactly know, Clarkie.

715
00:50:04,454 --> 00:50:06,991
Guess I just want to see
how it all turns out.

716
00:50:12,362 --> 00:50:13,998
Come back to me, Smallville.

717
00:50:31,781 --> 00:50:34,118
That should help us blend in,

718
00:50:34,185 --> 00:50:36,020
but I suggest we keep moving.

719
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:46,396
<i>Luthor, there's been
unauthorized use</i>

720
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:48,565
<i>of the portal from LexCorp.</i>

721
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:50,533
<i>I want an explanation.</i>

722
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,236
Just a power surge, Batman.

723
00:50:52,303 --> 00:50:54,205
It's nothing, already handled.

724
00:50:54,272 --> 00:50:55,907
All hail Darkseid.

725
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:59,143
<i>So, you've finally decided</i>

726
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:02,113
<i>to reveal
your traitorous nature.</i>

727
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:05,049
<i>Lord Darkseid
will kill you slowly.</i>

728
00:51:09,287 --> 00:51:12,555
Well,
I guess I'm completely on your side now.

729
00:51:13,423 --> 00:51:14,859
Yay, team.

730
00:51:58,402 --> 00:51:59,703
<i>Lord Darkseid,</i>

731
00:51:59,769 --> 00:52:01,805
<i>apologies for the intrusion.</i>

732
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:05,443
I trust this is
important, Batman.

733
00:52:05,508 --> 00:52:08,645
<i>We had an unauthorized
boom tube from LexCorp.</i>

734
00:52:09,447 --> 00:52:11,082
In brightest day,

735
00:52:11,815 --> 00:52:13,550
in blackest night...

736
00:52:16,988 --> 00:52:20,925
So, Luthor validated
your concerns.

737
00:52:20,992 --> 00:52:23,928
No evil shall escape my sight.

738
00:52:23,995 --> 00:52:26,629
Send the Furies
to capture the invaders.

739
00:52:26,696 --> 00:52:29,632
I will deal with them myself.

740
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:32,535
Let those who worship
evil's might...

741
00:52:32,602 --> 00:52:33,904
And also,

742
00:52:33,971 --> 00:52:36,773
teleport a portion
of Earth's magma here.

743
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,110
I'd like to make a point.

744
00:52:39,176 --> 00:52:41,112
Beware my power...

745
00:52:42,113 --> 00:52:43,713
<i>As you will it.</i>

746
00:52:52,423 --> 00:52:54,557
Green Lantern's light!

747
00:54:10,534 --> 00:54:11,734
Diana.

748
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:14,972
I'm so sorry
this happened to you.

749
00:54:16,107 --> 00:54:17,208
To all of you.

750
00:54:23,547 --> 00:54:26,450
I have to say, I don't fancy
the new look, luv.

751
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:28,185
Makes you look a bit murdery.

752
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:43,267
Kori, it's me!

753
00:54:43,334 --> 00:54:44,634
You're being controlled!

754
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:48,973
<i>Azarath Metrion Zinthos!</i>

755
00:55:32,849 --> 00:55:34,285
Oh, shit.

756
00:55:38,489 --> 00:55:39,789
Easy, Princess.

757
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:46,696
Finally, a challenge.

758
00:55:51,468 --> 00:55:52,735
Took you long enough.

759
00:55:52,802 --> 00:55:55,139
I like to make an entrance.

760
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,268
And so it ends.

761
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,876
My race is run.

762
00:57:06,944 --> 00:57:08,879
I regret nothing.

763
00:57:11,781 --> 00:57:13,951
It was fun.

764
00:57:20,457 --> 00:57:22,926
None of you will last long.

765
00:57:22,993 --> 00:57:25,696
You have no true warriors.

766
00:57:25,763 --> 00:57:27,731
You're right, Princess.

767
00:57:27,797 --> 00:57:29,433
We could use one of those.

768
00:57:37,241 --> 00:57:40,544
Oh, the old magic, that's the stuff.

769
00:57:40,611 --> 00:57:42,413
Cuts both ways, though.

770
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:47,384
Hear me, Wonder Woman
of the Justice League.

771
00:57:47,451 --> 00:57:50,120
You are a paragon for warriors
through the ages,

772
00:57:50,187 --> 00:57:52,489
not Darkseid's minion.

773
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:54,491
Break free, now!

774
00:58:04,668 --> 00:58:06,470
I am...

775
00:58:06,537 --> 00:58:08,372
Diana of Themyscira.

776
00:58:09,106 --> 00:58:10,941
Daughter of Hippolyta.

777
00:58:12,776 --> 00:58:15,112
I follow the old gods

778
00:58:15,179 --> 00:58:18,315
and will never again
bow to the new.

779
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:20,951
Care to do the honors?

780
00:58:35,299 --> 00:58:38,335
There's a tunnel behind you
leading to the power generator.

781
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,071
Leave them to me.

782
00:58:43,407 --> 00:58:46,143
Do not hold what happens next
against me, friends.

783
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:13,837
Always keep the best one
for yourself, Lexy.

784
00:59:13,904 --> 00:59:14,972
Lex...

785
00:59:23,213 --> 00:59:25,382
Well, that's a problem.

786
00:59:25,449 --> 00:59:27,151
For Clark and the team
to have any chance,

787
00:59:27,217 --> 00:59:30,020
those monsters
can't get back to Apokolips.

788
00:59:30,087 --> 00:59:31,588
We have to hold them off.

789
00:59:32,891 --> 00:59:34,291
Last call, then.

790
00:59:36,026 --> 00:59:38,695
King Shark is a shark.

791
00:59:38,762 --> 00:59:41,432
Buckle up, Suicide Squaddies.

792
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:43,967
Today's the day

793
00:59:44,034 --> 00:59:46,203
we earn our name!

794
00:59:57,614 --> 00:59:59,583
Oh, shite and fried eggs.

795
01:00:01,084 --> 01:00:02,519
My God.

796
01:00:43,694 --> 01:00:46,263
Barry? Barry!

797
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:48,332
Clark.

798
01:00:49,366 --> 01:00:50,567
We thought you were dead.

799
01:00:50,634 --> 01:00:53,070
It was phased
when Omega Beam hit.

800
01:00:53,136 --> 01:00:55,439
Apokolips reactor damaged.

801
01:00:55,506 --> 01:00:58,475
Converted me
to replacement.

802
01:00:58,542 --> 01:00:59,543
Make it stop.

803
01:01:00,979 --> 01:01:03,046
You gotta make me stop.

804
01:01:03,113 --> 01:01:04,181
Let me.

805
01:01:06,717 --> 01:01:07,784
Sleep, mate.

806
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,394
He caused it,

807
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:19,931
the Flashpoint.

808
01:01:19,998 --> 01:01:22,199
What are you talking about?

809
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:24,268
If he doesn't go back
to save his mum,

810
01:01:24,334 --> 01:01:26,169
Darkseid isn't here.

811
01:01:26,236 --> 01:01:28,572
But if Flash is
the power generator...

812
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:30,975
there's no generator
to blow up.

813
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:33,644
So we can't stop Darkseid
from coming back.

814
01:01:35,212 --> 01:01:36,280
Well, come on, then.

815
01:01:37,481 --> 01:01:40,217
Too far in to turn around now.

816
01:01:40,284 --> 01:01:42,119
We go through.

817
01:01:42,185 --> 01:01:44,187
What are you
planning, Constantine?

818
01:01:44,856 --> 01:01:46,156
It's magic.

819
01:01:46,223 --> 01:01:47,791
You wouldn't understand.

820
01:01:49,861 --> 01:01:51,295
I hate magic.

821
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:20,892
King Shark...

822
01:02:20,959 --> 01:02:24,528
is a shark!

823
01:02:34,104 --> 01:02:35,439
Come on, you bunch of assholes.

824
01:02:35,505 --> 01:02:37,407
Hey, you want
a boomerang?

825
01:02:37,474 --> 01:02:40,110
Here! Come one, come all!
What about you? And you!

826
01:02:40,177 --> 01:02:43,047
And you have a boomie.
You all have some fucking boomies.

827
01:02:43,113 --> 01:02:45,616
I've got you covered!

828
01:02:56,293 --> 01:02:57,661
Almost out of ammo.

829
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:01,832
We can't let them through!

830
01:03:05,036 --> 01:03:06,670
Everybody, on the platform!

831
01:03:20,918 --> 01:03:22,719
<i>Azarath Metrion Zinthos!</i>

832
01:03:22,786 --> 01:03:23,654
Aah!

833
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:29,593
Can't do this long.

834
01:03:31,896 --> 01:03:33,463
<i>Raven...</i>

835
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:36,034
<i>Let go.</i>

836
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,668
<i>Trust me, daughter.</i>

837
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:40,905
<i>Let go!</i>

838
01:03:58,555 --> 01:04:00,091
Raven!

839
01:04:00,158 --> 01:04:02,726
I'll kill you, boy!

840
01:04:09,399 --> 01:04:13,037
So,
that was my dad.

841
01:04:13,104 --> 01:04:15,672
None can resist Darkseid.

842
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:25,282
Hail Darkseid.

843
01:04:25,348 --> 01:04:27,217
I am the source wall.

844
01:04:28,518 --> 01:04:31,354
Lord Darkseid
has ordered you taken alive

845
01:04:31,421 --> 01:04:33,891
to personally
see to your punishment.

846
01:04:55,712 --> 01:04:58,448
Please wait
for Lord Darkseid's return.

847
01:04:58,515 --> 01:05:00,350
You shall be
dealt with accordingly.

848
01:05:00,417 --> 01:05:04,021
Just stop saying "Darkseid."

849
01:05:04,088 --> 01:05:05,756
I must alert Lord Darkseid.

850
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:07,624
- I am the source wall...
- What are you doing, Constantine?

851
01:05:07,691 --> 01:05:08,993
Techno magic.

852
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:12,029
Feels like taking a test
you haven't studied for.

853
01:05:12,096 --> 01:05:14,464
Luckily, I cheat.

854
01:05:14,531 --> 01:05:15,832
Lord Darkseid.

855
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,301
Lord Darkseid.
What is happening?

856
01:05:18,368 --> 01:05:19,871
Debugging ya, mate.

857
01:05:20,771 --> 01:05:21,805
It's gonna hurt.

858
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:43,027
You've all
acquitted yourselves admirably.

859
01:05:46,763 --> 01:05:49,000
Excellent technique, Mera.

860
01:05:52,103 --> 01:05:53,737
Now, let's find our friends.

861
01:05:57,307 --> 01:05:58,876
What's... What's going on?

862
01:05:58,943 --> 01:05:59,944
No! Stop!

863
01:06:01,245 --> 01:06:04,015
I'm fully integrated, Clark.

864
01:06:04,081 --> 01:06:07,818
There's not enough left of me
to ever leave this place.

865
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:10,520
Now, listen, Batman stepped out
to talk to the big...

866
01:06:10,587 --> 01:06:12,656
Batman's returned.

867
01:06:12,722 --> 01:06:14,926
And with his lord and master.

868
01:06:17,228 --> 01:06:18,930
You!

869
01:06:26,469 --> 01:06:29,006
I knew
Clark would come one day.

870
01:06:29,073 --> 01:06:30,774
It was inevitable.

871
01:06:30,841 --> 01:06:32,409
But I never thought
you'd be part

872
01:06:32,475 --> 01:06:34,544
of a lost cause, Constantine.

873
01:06:34,611 --> 01:06:37,048
I'm here
to level the playing field.

874
01:06:37,114 --> 01:06:39,616
No running this time.

875
01:06:39,683 --> 01:06:43,520
Maybe Zatanna's loss
finally broke you.

876
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:46,523
Was drinking yourself to death
not fast enough?

877
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:49,492
You won't pick us apart
so easily, Father.

878
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:51,628
You dare call me that?

879
01:06:54,664 --> 01:06:58,035
Your mother drugged me
to conceive you,

880
01:06:58,102 --> 01:06:59,971
goaded me into raising you,

881
01:07:00,037 --> 01:07:01,939
and broke me mentally.

882
01:07:02,006 --> 01:07:05,475
But once my eyes were
opened by Lord Darkseid,

883
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:07,744
I see you were never my son.

884
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:11,048
Only a burden.

885
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:13,918
Don't listen to him, Damian.

886
01:07:13,985 --> 01:07:15,052
That's Darkseid talking.

887
01:07:17,221 --> 01:07:18,788
Come, then.

888
01:07:18,856 --> 01:07:21,959
End your burden
once and for all.

889
01:07:22,026 --> 01:07:25,963
Why is the whelp
still alive?

890
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:28,165
Correct this, Batman.

891
01:07:31,903 --> 01:07:35,006
Mobius Chair,
attack protocol Alpha-Red.

892
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:39,176
Shit!

893
01:07:46,783 --> 01:07:48,551
In the past,
I let you win.

894
01:07:48,618 --> 01:07:49,753
This time...

895
01:07:50,388 --> 01:07:51,989
I won't hold back.

896
01:08:35,565 --> 01:08:37,134
Bruce! Don't!

897
01:08:49,113 --> 01:08:50,714
Finish him, Batman.

898
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:52,416
Finish him and take your place

899
01:08:52,482 --> 01:08:55,086
as first among my servants.

900
01:09:10,533 --> 01:09:13,371
You heard me, slave.

901
01:09:13,437 --> 01:09:14,604
Finish him.

902
01:09:20,044 --> 01:09:21,012
Go to hell.

903
01:09:28,518 --> 01:09:30,787
You disappoint me.

904
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:35,092
No!

905
01:09:35,993 --> 01:09:37,061
Damian!

906
01:09:45,403 --> 01:09:47,604
I am...

907
01:09:48,105 --> 01:09:50,607
free!

908
01:09:55,645 --> 01:09:58,082
John! He's coming!

909
01:09:58,149 --> 01:09:59,016
Do it now!

910
01:10:27,545 --> 01:10:29,313
Your bonds are loosened,

911
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,915
but not yet broken...

912
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:34,485
until your oath to me
is spoken!

913
01:10:34,552 --> 01:10:38,255
I'm offering you
a willing magical host.

914
01:10:38,322 --> 01:10:39,890
Let's kill the bastard.

915
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:43,227
I have a better idea.

916
01:10:49,699 --> 01:10:50,767
Bollocks!

917
01:11:12,822 --> 01:11:14,391
What's this?

918
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:17,161
What have you done, Kryptonian?

919
01:11:17,228 --> 01:11:19,530
Not the Kryptonian.

920
01:11:19,597 --> 01:11:21,664
Not anymore.

921
01:11:22,299 --> 01:11:24,034
No matter.

922
01:11:39,116 --> 01:11:40,717
So, you are

923
01:11:40,783 --> 01:11:44,054
one of the so-called new gods.

924
01:11:46,823 --> 01:11:48,791
I am unimpressed.

925
01:11:55,366 --> 01:11:57,201
Damian.

926
01:11:57,268 --> 01:11:59,870
Good to
see you again, Father.

927
01:12:02,106 --> 01:12:03,440
Hold on.

928
01:12:03,507 --> 01:12:04,707
Dad,

929
01:12:04,774 --> 01:12:08,078
I know I wasn't the ideal son,

930
01:12:08,145 --> 01:12:11,748
but you took me in
and welcomed me.

931
01:12:11,814 --> 01:12:13,951
You taught me a better way.

932
01:12:14,018 --> 01:12:16,020
And I thank you for that.

933
01:12:16,086 --> 01:12:17,388
Son.

934
01:12:17,454 --> 01:12:18,989
Remember, Father.

935
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:24,295
Justice, not vengeance.

936
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:27,697
Save them.

937
01:12:28,566 --> 01:12:29,699
Save her.

938
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:42,413
<i>Clark?</i>

939
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:43,614
<i>Clark, are you there?</i>

940
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:44,714
<i>Clark!</i>

941
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:46,450
<i>Honey? Come in! Please!</i>

942
01:13:01,232 --> 01:13:02,099
<i>Clark!</i>

943
01:13:03,701 --> 01:13:05,102
<i>Lois.</i>

944
01:13:05,169 --> 01:13:06,904
Bruce?

945
01:13:06,971 --> 01:13:10,207
<i>Forty seconds
to reach minimum safe distance.</i>

946
01:13:18,015 --> 01:13:19,550
I need to speak with Clark.

947
01:13:19,617 --> 01:13:21,852
There's not a lot of time left.

948
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,794
Vic, send the message
to Clark's mech suit now,

949
01:13:31,862 --> 01:13:33,063
so he can see it.

950
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:35,065
It's good
to have you back, Bats.

951
01:13:43,674 --> 01:13:45,242
<i>Clark, honey,</i>

952
01:13:45,309 --> 01:13:48,811
<i>I know we planned on
always being together,</i>

953
01:13:48,879 --> 01:13:51,081
<i>but that's
not going to happen now.</i>

954
01:13:51,148 --> 01:13:52,049
Lois?

955
01:13:54,752 --> 01:13:57,021
What is this?

956
01:13:57,087 --> 01:13:59,089
King Shark
is a shark!

957
01:13:59,156 --> 01:14:00,858
King Shark is a shark.

958
01:14:00,924 --> 01:14:02,660
King Shark is a shark!

959
01:14:02,726 --> 01:14:06,330
And Captain Boomerang is
a boomerang, you fuck knuckle.

960
01:14:06,397 --> 01:14:09,633
It's been an honor
to fight by your side.

961
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,402
Are you shitting me?

962
01:14:13,037 --> 01:14:15,939
Top of the world, puddin'!

963
01:14:16,006 --> 01:14:19,009
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

964
01:14:19,076 --> 01:14:20,644
<i>seven, six...</i>

965
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:22,845
<i>You'll have to be strong.</i>

966
01:14:22,913 --> 01:14:24,682
- <i>...four, three...</i>
- <i>I know you can do it.</i>

967
01:14:24,748 --> 01:14:26,816
- <i>...two, one.</i>
- Lois?

968
01:14:27,817 --> 01:14:29,019
<i>I love you, Clark.</i>

969
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:35,959
No!

970
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:55,145
This cannot be!

971
01:14:58,649 --> 01:15:01,085
It is impossible!

972
01:15:03,654 --> 01:15:05,389
And now to deal with...

973
01:15:07,524 --> 01:15:08,992
You.

974
01:15:33,617 --> 01:15:35,786
You took everything

975
01:15:35,854 --> 01:15:37,788
from me.

976
01:15:37,856 --> 01:15:40,791
Now, I'm going to make you pay.

977
01:15:46,897 --> 01:15:49,433
You will do nothing but die.

978
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:03,814
Unless I miss my guess,

979
01:16:03,882 --> 01:16:05,983
we'll need Constantine.

980
01:16:06,049 --> 01:16:07,451
Well, that's a problem.

981
01:16:17,694 --> 01:16:18,996
Hello, John.

982
01:16:20,497 --> 01:16:21,565
Hey.

983
01:16:24,301 --> 01:16:27,070
So, I finally bought the farm.

984
01:16:27,137 --> 01:16:29,673
Easy as crossing a street.

985
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:33,010
But how in the hell did you
get me into heaven?

986
01:16:34,311 --> 01:16:36,213
Pulled a few strings.

987
01:16:37,347 --> 01:16:39,450
I needed to apologize

988
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:42,019
for making you run away
when I died.

989
01:16:42,887 --> 01:16:44,087
Remember?

990
01:16:45,823 --> 01:16:47,424
<i>Rebmemer.</i>

991
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:52,095
A compulsion spell.

992
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,468
Batsy.

993
01:16:57,534 --> 01:16:59,102
He thought we should have
a backup plan

994
01:16:59,169 --> 01:17:01,004
in case everything went wrong.

995
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,408
Can you forgive me?

996
01:17:05,843 --> 01:17:07,110
'Course I do!

997
01:17:07,177 --> 01:17:09,413
I get to spend eternity
with you.

998
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,281
First question,

999
01:17:11,348 --> 01:17:13,317
are there any pubs?

1000
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:15,252
If not, we build one.

1001
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:17,254
Next time.

1002
01:17:17,321 --> 01:17:19,423
Today, our friends
still need your help.

1003
01:17:22,259 --> 01:17:23,627
Oh, come on, Zee.

1004
01:17:24,194 --> 01:17:25,562
I did my bit.

1005
01:17:26,497 --> 01:17:27,397
I'm dead.

1006
01:17:28,599 --> 01:17:29,833
John Constantine,

1007
01:17:29,901 --> 01:17:32,636
you of all people should know
that means nothing

1008
01:17:32,703 --> 01:17:34,471
when destiny's involved.

1009
01:17:41,612 --> 01:17:42,613
Damian...

1010
01:17:44,448 --> 01:17:45,315
I...

1011
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:50,787
I love you.

1012
01:18:02,366 --> 01:18:04,234
Goodbye for now, John.

1013
01:18:18,348 --> 01:18:20,684
Holy shit, he's alive.

1014
01:18:20,751 --> 01:18:22,419
How are you alive?

1015
01:18:22,486 --> 01:18:24,621
I can't even be
a corpse in peace!

1016
01:18:24,688 --> 01:18:27,524
Wanking destiny
can go bugger itself.

1017
01:18:42,439 --> 01:18:44,207
You brought me back.

1018
01:18:45,977 --> 01:18:47,678
I had to take the chance.

1019
01:18:51,148 --> 01:18:53,550
Release me!

1020
01:18:53,617 --> 01:18:56,520
Bet you wish you had taken
my offer now, eh, wanker?

1021
01:18:58,355 --> 01:19:00,257
We're going to talk
when this is done.

1022
01:19:01,124 --> 01:19:03,126
Now, what's the bloody plan?

1023
01:19:07,164 --> 01:19:08,832
Vic, do we have a way out?

1024
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,400
Working on it.

1025
01:19:28,987 --> 01:19:30,420
Damian...

1026
01:19:30,487 --> 01:19:32,222
those things I said...

1027
01:19:32,289 --> 01:19:34,358
Don't make this
overly emotional, Father,

1028
01:19:34,424 --> 01:19:36,126
it wasn't your fault.

1029
01:19:36,193 --> 01:19:38,261
I've relinked
with the Mother Box.

1030
01:19:38,328 --> 01:19:39,931
I can transport you
off the station

1031
01:19:39,998 --> 01:19:41,866
and bring back the Paradooms.

1032
01:19:41,933 --> 01:19:45,702
Then I send Apokolips
to no destination at all.

1033
01:19:45,769 --> 01:19:48,505
Darkseid is trapped with
his monsters forever.

1034
01:19:52,442 --> 01:19:54,578
We're not leaving Clark behind.

1035
01:19:54,645 --> 01:19:55,980
That won't work.

1036
01:19:56,047 --> 01:19:58,749
Darkseid needs to be distracted
for me to do my thing.

1037
01:20:02,519 --> 01:20:04,956
Yeah, yeah, let me think.

1038
01:20:05,023 --> 01:20:06,623
Still pissed at you.

1039
01:20:12,396 --> 01:20:13,830
You can't be serious.

1040
01:20:13,898 --> 01:20:14,765
Uh-huh.

1041
01:20:16,868 --> 01:20:18,102
On second thought...

1042
01:20:18,168 --> 01:20:19,736
that's perfect.

1043
01:20:19,803 --> 01:20:21,304
All together now.

1044
01:20:21,371 --> 01:20:24,307
<i>Azarath Metrion Zinthos!</i>

1045
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:34,451
You have spirit, Kryptonian.

1046
01:20:34,518 --> 01:20:37,421
But the strength
of a lost love is only...

1047
01:20:44,227 --> 01:20:46,064
Go!

1048
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:50,233
Unless you would fight me
for the right to destroy him.

1049
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:00,811
And now,

1050
01:21:00,878 --> 01:21:02,412
new god,

1051
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:05,682
let's see who shall rule,

1052
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:09,286
and who shall serve!

1053
01:21:23,134 --> 01:21:25,635
Okay, bus is leaving.
There'll be no better time.

1054
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,808
Victor?

1055
01:21:31,876 --> 01:21:33,211
Can't come.

1056
01:21:33,276 --> 01:21:34,611
Download your consciousness

1057
01:21:34,678 --> 01:21:36,881
into a mother cube, or whatnot.

1058
01:21:36,948 --> 01:21:38,448
It doesn't work
like that, genius.

1059
01:21:38,515 --> 01:21:39,951
Now leave,
before these assholes realize

1060
01:21:40,017 --> 01:21:41,685
they're gonna be
trapped here forever.

1061
01:21:42,954 --> 01:21:43,820
Cheers.

1062
01:21:50,427 --> 01:21:52,262
Go on, I'm right behind you.

1063
01:22:04,775 --> 01:22:07,711
What a wonderful gift,
daughter.

1064
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:09,881
Be well!

1065
01:22:14,152 --> 01:22:15,552
Goodbye, Father.

1066
01:22:19,857 --> 01:22:21,893
Looks like I get the last word.

1067
01:22:24,028 --> 01:22:25,595
Suck it, bitches!

1068
01:22:28,933 --> 01:22:30,902
No!

1069
01:22:31,768 --> 01:22:35,405
You're mad! No!

1070
01:23:42,472 --> 01:23:43,941
What news?

1071
01:23:44,008 --> 01:23:45,709
Even though
the planet reapers were stopped

1072
01:23:45,775 --> 01:23:47,477
before they finished,

1073
01:23:47,544 --> 01:23:48,913
the damage was done.

1074
01:23:49,713 --> 01:23:50,948
How bad?

1075
01:23:51,015 --> 01:23:54,051
We lost 31%
of the Earth's molten core.

1076
01:23:54,118 --> 01:23:56,820
The planet's rotation
is compromised.

1077
01:23:56,888 --> 01:24:00,724
The smallest change either way
will mean freezing or burning.

1078
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:03,027
My best estimate is
another billion deaths

1079
01:24:03,094 --> 01:24:05,695
before we can get anything
under control.

1080
01:24:06,297 --> 01:24:07,764
Provided we can.

1081
01:24:09,499 --> 01:24:11,269
Okay.

1082
01:24:11,335 --> 01:24:13,170
I know everyone's
been through hell,

1083
01:24:13,237 --> 01:24:14,504
but we can't quit.

1084
01:24:14,571 --> 01:24:16,173
The Justice League

1085
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,540
doesn't quit.

1086
01:24:19,709 --> 01:24:22,445
If we work together,
we can do this.

1087
01:24:23,546 --> 01:24:25,649
We can save the planet.

1088
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:30,154
You know what you
have to do, mate.

1089
01:24:31,222 --> 01:24:32,189
Clear the board...

1090
01:24:32,924 --> 01:24:33,925
start again.

1091
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:36,459
Another Flashpoint?

1092
01:24:38,396 --> 01:24:40,730
I promised Iris before she...

1093
01:24:45,102 --> 01:24:46,037
I can't.

1094
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,608
Yeah, figured you'd say that.

1095
01:24:55,413 --> 01:24:56,746
Everything would change.

1096
01:24:57,882 --> 01:24:58,748
Again.

1097
01:25:01,818 --> 01:25:04,855
And some of those changes
may be shite.

1098
01:25:04,922 --> 01:25:07,490
And we may make
the same mistakes again.

1099
01:25:08,825 --> 01:25:10,493
It won't be perfect...

1100
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:15,900
but it'll be a long sight
better than what we got now.

1101
01:26:54,341 --> 01:26:59,341
