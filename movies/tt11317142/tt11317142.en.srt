3
00:01:20,893 --> 00:01:22,360
- Fuck.
- Do it again?

4
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:23,595
Yeah, daddy.

5
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:26,499
Keep going.

6
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:27,666
- Oh, oh my God.
- Oh!

7
00:01:57,832 --> 00:01:59,901
Hi, it's me, it's Mommy.

8
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:02,469
Listen, are you coming to
the funeral today or what?

9
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:04,806
Because we gotta leave soon
and you told me you were.

10
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:06,707
But your dad
just said you're not.

11
00:02:06,774 --> 00:02:08,209
He's always 10 notes
behind, though so...

12
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:11,914
He's still at the gym so who
knows if we'll even get there.

13
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,049
Danielle, your father, useless.

14
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:17,753
I ask him to do one
thing today, one thing.

15
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,922
You know what?
Just call me back, okay?

16
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:21,656
Call, do not text me.

17
00:02:23,624 --> 00:02:24,525
Busy day?

18
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:27,863
Yeah.

19
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:34,069
I have this brunch thing
that I have to get ready for.

20
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:35,872
Oh, is it another client?

21
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:39,976
- Yes.
- Does he have hair?

22
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:43,746
- Yes, some.
- Does he have teeth?

23
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:44,513
Yes.

24
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:47,016
Well, how are you gonna
get through law school

25
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,652
when you're busy screwin'
around with these guys?

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,955
How are you get
through law school

27
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:54,724
when you're busy screwin'
around with these guys?

28
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:00,430
Don't forget, hm?

29
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,837
Thank you.

30
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:07,838
Mm hm.

31
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:23,453
Um, did you remember?

32
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:27,458
Oh yeah.

33
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:29,493
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:40,872
I really wanna help you
with your degree

35
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:43,008
and law school and everything,

36
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:47,712
and I think it's really
great to support females,

37
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,016
particularly
female entrepreneurs.

38
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:51,350
- I know.
- Who will be doing nothing

39
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,485
with their business majors
and sociology minors.

40
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:55,788
- Okay. Cool.
- You're the future.

41
00:03:55,855 --> 00:03:56,789
Great.

42
00:03:56,856 --> 00:03:57,757
Awesome.

43
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:19,612
- Hello.
- Hi.

44
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:20,781
Good to see you guys.

45
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,020
Danielle!

46
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:29,089
- Danielle!
- Please don't yell!

47
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:30,791
I just wanna make sure
that she sees us.

48
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:31,925
You're
embarrassing yourself.

49
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:33,592
Would you leave me alone?

50
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:36,164
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

51
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:38,232
Listen, we could have
given you a ride.

52
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:41,635
It's fine.
Why did you bring the van?

53
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:42,804
Your mother
neglected to tell me

54
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,238
that she was having
her own car fixed.

55
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:45,605
I did tell him.

56
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:46,341
I had to move all my
products here to the back.

57
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:47,607
As a matter of fact,

58
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:49,643
there was no room for
me to drive up front.

59
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:50,610
Your mother had to drive.

60
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:52,013
I did tell you.

61
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,148
He doesn't listen
or he's got Alzheimer's.

62
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:54,916
How was the funeral?

63
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:56,951
Ah, eulogies were shit.

64
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:58,886
- I liked 'em.
- You like everything.

65
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:00,022
You're wearing makeup.

66
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:01,957
You look nice with makeup.

67
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:02,858
Thanks.

68
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:03,959
How do I look?

69
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:05,928
Um, you look great.

70
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:07,930
- Do I?
- Yeah, Mom, you look good.

71
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:09,732
You didn't say that in
a very self-assured way.

72
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:10,933
You look great, Mom.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,901
Where'd you get that bracelet?

74
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:15,137
- I don't know.
- Wow, it looks expensive.

75
00:05:15,204 --> 00:05:17,840
I think you got it for
me in like high school

76
00:05:17,906 --> 00:05:18,741
- or something.
- Really?

77
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:19,908
- Yeah.
- I'm amazing.

78
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:21,810
All right,
shall we go in, everybody?

79
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:23,112
What's my sound bite again?

80
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:25,115
Y'know, just that
you're finishing up finals

81
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:27,616
and you've got a few
job interviews lined up.

82
00:05:27,683 --> 00:05:29,753
Although Moira's here and
her daughter Stephanie...

83
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:30,887
- Jessica.
- Whatever.

84
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:33,757
She's like this
marketing executive,

85
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,656
kind of publicist thing.

86
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:35,759
- Assistant.
- Exactly.

87
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:37,060
You should really
talk to her, y'know?

88
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:39,162
No, she doesn't
want to talk to her.

89
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:40,196
She's not interested
in marketing.

90
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:41,765
It's just a job.

91
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,135
Why is Maya here?

92
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,005
- Shit.
- Oh my God, Dad.

93
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:49,740
We'll be here another hour.

94
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,876
Why did you put them like
that in the first place?

95
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:53,610
There's too much
stuff to get in all at once.

96
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:55,279
But listen to me a second,
all right?

97
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:57,314
Why don't you just tell people

98
00:05:57,381 --> 00:06:00,718
that temporarily you're
gonna be working with me,

99
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:02,253
with your dad, just until
you find something better.

100
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,889
No, no.
She's not gonna say that.

101
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:05,756
Why not?

102
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,024
Tell me truthfully how I look.

103
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:09,326
- You look good, Mom.
- Is the hair better?

104
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:11,162
Deb,
do you have my phone on you?

105
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:13,065
No, you have Alzheimer's.

106
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:13,832
Are you okay?

107
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,167
- Yeah.
- Really?

108
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,304
Can I whisper something to you?

109
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:20,906
Okay.

110
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:23,075
No funny business with Maya.

111
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:24,176
What is that supposed to mean?

112
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:24,943
You know what it means.

113
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,044
Stop.

114
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,345
You're lucky
I'm so open-minded.

115
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:28,679
Okay, yeah you're right,
I should kiss the ground

116
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:31,883
you walk on for not kicking
me out of the house.

117
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,985
You're not in our house,
you're just on our payroll.

118
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:35,087
Can we go?

119
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:36,355
Yeah,
I've been waiting for you.

120
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:37,790
- Right.
- Go.

121
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:39,459
Oh, now you don't wait for me.

122
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,928
- Watch the kids.
- Wait, Mom. Who died?

123
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:43,229
I'm so sorry for your loss.

124
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:46,899
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it's so sad.

125
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:47,867
Yes.

126
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:53,139
She was so full of life,
y'know?

127
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:55,074
She was so... yeah.

128
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:55,775
I'm really...

129
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,855
Oh, Maya, I mean Danielle.

130
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:12,893
Columbia, oh my God.
That's fantastic.

131
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,696
It is. But
it wasn't our first choice.

132
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:17,364
- You must be so proud.
- It's incredible, really,

133
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:18,765
honestly.

134
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:21,368
What's your line of work
that you're interested in?

135
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:24,939
Well, it's sort of
like, it's media, y'know?

136
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:26,107
No.

137
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:27,008
Oh, you look wonderful.

138
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:27,876
Thank you, so do you.

139
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:30,345
Abbie would be so pleased.

140
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:32,247
Does Danielle want to go
to law school or grad school?

141
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:34,115
Neither right now.

142
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:37,886
She's just got a few
job interviews lined up.

143
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:40,788
That's great.

144
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:44,159
- She lost so much weight.
- Yeah. Quite a lot.

145
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:45,426
Is she okay?

146
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:49,999
She just, y'know,
finals, stress... whatever.

147
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:52,101
Is she seeing anyone?

148
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:53,736
Not at the moment, no.

149
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:56,005
Is Maya seeing anyone?

150
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:57,406
Not at the moment, no.

151
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:58,374
How come?

152
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:01,510
Excuse me.

153
00:08:01,577 --> 00:08:02,945
Of course.

154
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:07,082
I feel so bad for Debbie.

155
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:08,851
- So good to see you.
- Thank you.

156
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:09,952
Thank you for coming.

157
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:12,822
There's some bagels
on the table.

158
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:13,790
Oh, I'm gonna go grab one.

159
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:15,325
Yeah.

160
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:18,295
Maya says she's changed her
major at least a dozen times.

161
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:20,864
Do you think
she has an eating disorder?

162
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:24,167
Who's that? He's cute.

163
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:27,537
Janice and Maury's son.
Max, I think.

164
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:28,972

165
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,902

Congrats on law school,

170
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,416
Thanks.

171
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,019
That only took you like
four fuckin' months.

172
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,822
How's babysitting?

173
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:18,056
Good.

174
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:19,524
What are you like, are
you here this summer?

175
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,361
It's just, I didn't know
that I was gonna see you today

176
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:25,031
because I thought that you
would still be taking finals.

177
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,266
I finished them, yesterday.

178
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,234
And what, you just
had to like race home

179
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,902
for your best friend Annie?

180
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,771
Abbie.

181
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,473
That's what I said.

182
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,074
Well I interned for her
in high school.

183
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,243
Oh yeah, course you did.

184
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,444
Yeah, so my mom
and I thought it'd be

185
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,847
like good to be with
the family in this time.

186
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,816
Show you off, very
on brand for Katherine.

187
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,053
Were you um,

188
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,124
were you even at the funeral?

189
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,059
Yeah.

190
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,161
- Really?
- Of course I was.

191
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:55,262
Yeah.

192
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,497
Your dad was kinda
like frazzled,

193
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:59,099
I don't um, he said
you were running late.

194
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,635
Okay, well if he said
that, then why did you ask?

195
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:04,638
You can't just like show
up to like the after party

196
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:07,408
for a shiva and like reap
the benefits of the buffet.

197
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,710
I didn't, I was there.

198
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:10,210
Were you like looking for
me and asking everyone?

199
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,148
No, I was not looking for
you. Let's live in the truth.

200
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:14,349
Where's Danielle?

201
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,584
What was your favorite
part of the service?

202
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:19,387
The whole thing was beautiful.

203
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:22,557
Interesting,
you must just be so sad.

204
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,392
You must be really
grieving your friend Annie.

205
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:27,362
Well, actually our families
are really close, y'know?

206
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:30,899
She actually played bridge
with my bubby.

207
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,434
- Bubby?
- Yeah.

208
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,668
Okay, you've never met
your grandma.

209
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:36,105
Well, thank you for
reminding me, Maya.

210
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:37,473
I'll be right back.

211
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,408
- It is so good to see you.
- We need to catch up.

212
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:40,876
Yeah, come find me.

213
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:43,646
- Come find me.
- What?

214
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:52,388
Are you like thrilled to be
home with your peak audience?

215
00:10:53,322 --> 00:10:54,690
I'm not thrilled,
I'm grieving.

216
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:55,925
It's a funeral.

217
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:58,594
- Maya!
- I know, I'm sad too.

218
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:02,132
- You remember Gloria?
- Hi, how are you?

219
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,234
I'm good, how are you?

220
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,442
Mom, mom, mom, who died?

221
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:47,379
Abbie, Uncle Morty's
second wife's sister,

222
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:48,180
you remember her.

223
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:49,281
No, I don't think so.

224
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:51,250
She used to play bridge
with Bubby.

225
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:52,384
Really?

226
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:55,254
- Here.
- Oh, Mom I can't eat that.

227
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,455
- Why not?
- I'm vegetarian.

228
00:11:56,522 --> 00:11:57,356
You're killin' me.

229
00:11:57,423 --> 00:11:58,624
I've told you so many times.

230
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,626
You have not eaten a
single thing all day.

231
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:01,960
That's because
we just got here.

232
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:04,696
You look like Gwyneth
Paltrow on food stamps.

233
00:12:04,764 --> 00:12:06,532
- Oh my God.
- And not in a good way.

234
00:12:06,598 --> 00:12:07,599
You know what Aunt Oz says?

235
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,102
She says she thinks
you're anorexic.

236
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:13,206
Danielle.

237
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:17,043
Are you listening to me?
Hey, hey.

238
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:20,547
Oh my God.

239
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:24,217
That's Paul
and Cheryl Shapiro's nephew.

240
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,618
He's so cute.

241
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,721
You know what?

242
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:31,090
He has a cousin
that works in publishing.

243
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:34,694
- Maybe he can help you.
- Mom, stop.

244
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:35,663
I have to go to the bathroom.

245
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,131
- No no no no, let's go.
- Mom.

246
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:37,833
We're gonna do this.

247
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:38,834
I don't want to.

248
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,967
- Come with me.
- I'll go later.

249
00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:40,701
- Now.
- I didn't eat yet and I'm...

250
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,570
Come on, come on.

251
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,805
I'll get his number later.

252
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:44,705
- Now.
- Stop.

253
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:45,539
- Now, now, now.
- No, Mom.

254
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:45,673
- Now, now.
- Mom.

255
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,244
The problem is the interest
rates and the economy...

256
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,746
Hey, look who's here.

257
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,547
Hi, sweetheart.

258
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:56,584
Hey, oh my gosh.

259
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,055
Max worked
for your father years ago.

260
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:01,189
- Really?
- Yeah.

261
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:02,557
Hi.

262
00:13:02,624 --> 00:13:04,192
Joel's your father?

263
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:06,561
Mm hm, yeah.

264
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,097
- Yeah.
- Okay.

265
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,233
Do you kids know each other?

266
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:15,537
Um, yeah.
We met a really long time ago.

267
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:16,538
No kidding, how?

268
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:17,639
At the uh.

269
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:20,141
- Um, at the Beth...
- Beth Torah.

270
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,444
- Israel, Israel, yeah.
- Beth Israel, right.

271
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,413
You met at shul?

272
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,217
Yeah... I was volunteering
for the children.

273
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:29,685
What children?

274
00:13:29,753 --> 00:13:31,420
Really, I can't even get
you to go to services with me.

275
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:32,756
It's a thing, you can...

276
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:35,157
you can volunteer
for the Jewish children.

277
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:36,459
It's like an organization.

278
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:37,761
Aren't you too busy,
I mean like with school

279
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:40,229
and then doing the
babysitting and everything?

280
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:43,499
Oh wow, you babysit?

281
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:45,067
How often do you do that?

282
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:47,538
Just, y'know,
whenever they need me.

283
00:13:47,604 --> 00:13:48,038
They don't give
you a schedule?

284
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:49,139
No.

285
00:13:49,206 --> 00:13:49,874
- No schedule?
- No schedule, Mom.

286
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:51,809
Well, do you enjoy it?

287
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:53,043
Yeah, I mean depends
on the kid,

288
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,145
but it's a great way
to pay the bills, so.

289
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,246
Bills?

290
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:57,715
You've never paid
a bill in your life.

291
00:13:57,782 --> 00:13:59,182
That's... I don't...

292
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:01,184
You know what I mean.

293
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:01,953
That doesn't mean
she's not responsible.

294
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,186
I've paid bills before.

295
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:05,757
Listen, sweetheart, as
soon as graduation comes,

296
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,958
you'll learn all about bills.

297
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:08,760
I'll make sure
you understand everything.

298
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:11,429
Right,
but you're studying business?

299
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:12,397
No, not business.

300
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:14,699
No no, she's studying gender.

301
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,200
The business of gender.

302
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:18,403
It's like gender business.

303
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:20,538
She does this fantastic
program

304
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:21,673
where you kind of design

305
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,207
- your own major.
- It's fascinating.

306
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:25,343
It's a little complex when
it comes to finding employment,

307
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,544
but she's doing terrifically.

308
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:28,379
Well, it can get a
job for a lot of people.

309
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:29,882
Yes, absolutely.

310
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:32,550
You are gonna make
your own job, right?

311
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:33,953
Because she's so talented.

312
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,086
Well now that you're gonna
be going to law school,

313
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:36,555
you won't have to worry
about that.

314
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,792
Law school? Where'd you get
the idea about law school?

315
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:42,528
That's Maya, Maya is
going to law school.

316
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:45,297
Danielle is gender business.

317
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:47,399
I still don't exactly
know what that means,

318
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:48,601
but she's great.

319
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:49,736
What's the post-grad
plan, then?

320
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:51,103
Well,
are they taking care of you?

321
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,472
Are you making enough
money now from babysitting?

322
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:54,908
No, Dad, not nearly enough

323
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,308
considering all the hard
work that I'm doing.

324
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,209
Well, it's a good thing
that you don't need the money.

325
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:58,444
I'm saving up for something.

326
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,380
Oh yeah, well what
are you saving up for?

327
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:01,281
Your own apartment?

328
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:02,783
Yes. She's doing just that.

329
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,284
Daddy's not going to be paying
for that apartment forever.

330
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:07,520
- But she's very hard-working.
- Listen, maybe you and Max

331
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:08,889
could discuss this in
more detail together.

332
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:10,390
Yes, yes.

333
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:13,293
I mean, maybe he could help
you find the ideal position.

334
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,528
Yeah, I'm sure he can
but I already have a plan

335
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:16,764
and a path,
so I don't need that.

336
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:18,231
Look, sweetheart,
feminism isn't exactly

337
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:19,399
what I call a career.

338
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,334
It's not my career.
It's a lens...

339
00:15:23,404 --> 00:15:24,806
...through which
to see my career.

340
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:26,607
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

341
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:29,745
I understand, there's
acting, and there's film,

342
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:31,379
there's comedy, there's
activism,

343
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:32,446
there's all that stuff.

344
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:33,648
But you can't really
support yourself

345
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:35,751
as an adult through
babysitting, y'know?

346
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:37,119
I mean, sooner or later,

347
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:39,253
you're gonna have to narrow
it down to one thing.

348
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,689
Don't you have a cousin
who's in publishing?

349
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:43,624
Sam, sure.

350
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:46,594
Maybe he needs an intern.

351
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:48,230
- Sure.
- Yeah, would it pay?

352
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:51,000
Well, some stipend
or something.

353
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:53,736
I mean, you could work
out an arrangement, right?

354
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:55,738
Get the family deal.

355
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:58,775
Yeah, exactly.
That would be great.

356
00:15:58,841 --> 00:15:59,976
This beautiful thing.

357
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:03,512
Oh look, they
put the desserts out.

358
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:04,847
Hello.

359
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:07,649
Joel.

360
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,385
- Excuse me.
- Let others go first.

361
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:12,923
You go to the gym
in the morning,

362
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,525
you eat your weight
back to lunch.

363
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:17,226
What are you gonna do?

364
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,002
Danielle...

365
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,302
Yeah?

366
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:28,872
Could you come with me to
the kitchen for a second?

367
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,010
He's funny.

368
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,512
Don't go there.
He's not for you.

369
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,915
Go where?

370
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:39,751
Just try to behave yourself
today, for me please?

371
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:40,852
What are you
talking about, Mom?

372
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,553
I'm not gonna blow him
in the bathroom.

373
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:43,788
We are at a shiva.

374
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:45,990
That's what I'm saying,
I'm not gonna do it.

375
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:49,226
And you can't go there anyway,

376
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:51,328
'cause he's married.

377
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:56,768
- He's married?
- Yuh huh.

378
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:01,372
- Are you sure?
- Yuh huh.

379
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:03,475
To a shiksa princess.

380
00:17:05,643 --> 00:17:07,512
Poor guy.

381
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:21,426
Hey.

382
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:28,735
Thank you.

383
00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:30,904
Thank you, Danielle.

384
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,681
So, your folks, they're good?
They're still in Florida?

385
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:46,352
Yeah they are, they've become
quite the snowbirds, actually.

386
00:17:46,418 --> 00:17:47,889
They bounce back and forth
quite a bit.

387
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:50,390
Ah, that's so fantastic,
I love that.

388
00:17:50,457 --> 00:17:52,026
I've been dying
to get down there myself

389
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:53,127
to play
my annual golf tournament.

390
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:54,628
Oh, I didn't know
you golfed, Joel.

391
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:57,364
Yeah, but I had major hip
replacement surgery this year.

392
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,000
- I'm so sorry to hear that.
- Partial.

393
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:00,902
But she won't allow
me to get on a plane.

394
00:18:00,968 --> 00:18:03,137
Well, that makes sense.
It's probably a good idea.

395
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:05,740
So, how's
your brother, Max?

396
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:07,975
Oh, he's good.
He's, y'know, he's...

397
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:11,512
Um yeah, he's
your parents' favorite.

398
00:18:12,848 --> 00:18:13,916
You're funny.

399
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:18,452
- Just kidding.
- I know.

400
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,687
So yeah, but he's good.

401
00:18:19,755 --> 00:18:20,321
He's doing really good,
the practice is...

402
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:22,557
And how's Kate?

403
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,059
Um, Kim.

404
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:26,494
- Kim, sorry.
- Yeah, no, it's okay.

405
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:27,830
She's good.

406
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:30,866
She's doin' really well.
She's on her way, actually.

407
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,333
Oh, that's lovely.

408
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,568
You know, I don't
know how this escaped my mind,

409
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:36,605
but didn't you guys
have a baby this year?

410
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:37,673
Yes we did.

411
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,808
- Oh my God.
- That's fantastic.

412
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,944
- Mazel tov.
- How did I not know that?

413
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,845
What great news.

414
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:43,813
Do you have photos? Let's see.

415
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,948
Sure, of course.

416
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:50,854
Aw, look at that.
Good on you, buddy.

417
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,455
- Oh, she's gorgeous.
- Oh, what a beauty.

418
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:55,959
I think you got a phone call.

419
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:57,760
Oh, sorry, I'll be right back.

420
00:18:57,827 --> 00:18:59,096
Hello?

421
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:01,564
Hi, yeah, we're in the
back. Let me come get you.

422
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:03,100
It's a cute baby.

423
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,601
You thought
that baby was cute?

424
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:05,836
Yes.

425
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:09,439
It was hideous,
freakishly pale and no nose.

426
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:10,506
What the heck?

427
00:19:10,573 --> 00:19:11,809
Where are you going?

428
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:12,609
Because she's
got her own business...

429
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:13,710
I don't get it.

430
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,578
I thought your mom
was watching her.

431
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:16,713
I know, she got sick.

432
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,815
What the fuck?

433
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:19,449
You want the baby
getting sick?

434
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:20,851
No.

435
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:22,119
This is why we need
a new sitter.

436
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:24,722
Okay, fine,
I'll find a new sitter.

437
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:25,489
- Hi.
- Hey!

438
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:26,358
How are you?

439
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:27,391
Hi, good to see you.

440
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,061
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

441
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,695
- Oh you brought the baby!
- She's beautiful.

442
00:19:31,763 --> 00:19:32,964
- I know.
- My goodness.

443
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:35,466
- We need a new sitter.
- I know, I'll find one.

444
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:37,068
- Hi, I'm Debbie.
- I know, we met...

445
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,837
It was at the
Glickman bris?

446
00:19:38,904 --> 00:19:39,971
- The bris.
- Yes.

447
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:42,007
That's right.
That was fun.

448
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:44,109
Well, I mean,
you know what I mean.

449
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:47,914
It was good to see you
guys there, yes exactly.

450
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,118
Oh, look at
you, you little cutie.

451
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:53,853
What a nice button nose
you've got.

452
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,821
Good thing she
doesn't have my nose.

453
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:57,622
Oh my God,
look at her.

454
00:19:57,689 --> 00:19:58,824
Look at those eyes.

455
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:01,593
She's definitely
got her mom's eyes.

456
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,694
Beautiful.

457
00:20:03,796 --> 00:20:05,765
Oh, your jacket's dirty.

458
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,768
Didn't wanna wear the one that
I took to the dry cleaners?

459
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,635
Uh, I guess
I couldn't find it.

460
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:12,105
- It's fine.
- Okay.

461
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:13,974
You know what,
why don't I take her

462
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,042
so you can get something to eat?

463
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:16,276
Oh, it's fine,
it's fine.

464
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:18,912
And I mean,
you'll get me something right?

465
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:20,914
Yeah, here,
can you hold her shoe?

466
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:21,647
- The baby's shoe.
- I am starving.

467
00:20:21,714 --> 00:20:23,016
Oh, sure.

468
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,418
Been running around
all day with this one.

469
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:28,654
- Max had a meeting this morning.
- A meeting on a Sunday?

470
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:29,856
What do you want,
a bagel or something?

471
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:32,826
You know what
I'd love? Arugula.

472
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:34,061
Ooh.

473
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:36,731
Oh, it's rugelach,
not arugula.

474
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:37,865
That's what she said.

475
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:39,167
No,
that's not what she said.

476
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:44,038
She said arugula and you
need your hearing checked.

477
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:45,273
- My hearing is fine.
- Right.

478
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,042
You just don't listen,
that's your problem.

479
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:53,214
Hi!

480
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:54,148
Oh my God.

481
00:20:55,283 --> 00:20:57,185
You look so gorgeous,
sweetheart.

482
00:20:57,251 --> 00:21:00,022
Oh my God, stop, please.
You look gorgeous.

483
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:01,824
Why thank,
you. You're a grown woman.

484
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,359
I know, yeah.

485
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:05,693
Feels like just yesterday
you were the same age as Mason.

486
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:07,129
It's crazy.

487
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:09,664
I know, he's gonna be bar
mitzvahed later this year.

488
00:21:09,732 --> 00:21:10,733
I heard, yeah.

489
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,067
I went and I
bought him a suit.

490
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:16,038
I gotta show you this, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

491
00:21:17,672 --> 00:21:18,673
It's here somewhere.

492
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:20,142
Oh, sorry.

493
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,176
Ah.

494
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:22,946
Now, look at it,
isn't this cute?

495
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:25,048
Of course, it has to be tailored

496
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,217
because he gained
a lot of weight.

497
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:27,884
Oh.

498
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:38,094
Shit.

499
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:39,921
Coming.

500
00:23:39,988 --> 00:23:41,489
One sec, sorry.

501
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:42,656
Just a minute.

502
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,279
Sorry,
didn't mean to startle you,

503
00:24:03,345 --> 00:24:06,282
but is there an open
window or a fan inside?

504
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:07,416
Great, thank you.

505
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:45,856
Danielle?

506
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:48,226
Hi.

507
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:49,393
Hey, you.

508
00:24:50,461 --> 00:24:52,964
- You look stunning.
- Oh, thank you.

509
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,532
Absolutely gorgeous.

510
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,367
- Thanks.
- So, any boyfriends?

511
00:24:56,434 --> 00:24:58,804
No, not yet, or right now.

512
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,440
You must be so excited
about graduating.

513
00:25:01,506 --> 00:25:05,244
Yeah, I mean like
I have some exams left

514
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,313
and then I have some
interviews that I'm gonna do.

515
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,382
Really? You didn't tell me.
Where?

516
00:25:10,449 --> 00:25:12,384
Well, I don't think
you know the places.

517
00:25:12,451 --> 00:25:15,053
Do you still make
those little videos?

518
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,055
I always thought
those were so fun.

519
00:25:17,122 --> 00:25:17,923
I haven't done one in a while.

520
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,292
So, acting is still your goal?

521
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:23,196
No, it's like comedy,
stand-up.

522
00:25:23,263 --> 00:25:25,398
What was your major
again, sweetie?

523
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:27,267
No no, she doesn't have
a major, Mom.

524
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:30,603
She makes it up, but you
like got a diploma, right?

525
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,872
I think
it was politics.

526
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:34,841
Now I'm trying to think
if I know anybody.

527
00:25:34,907 --> 00:25:37,210
I always remember
you were such

528
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:39,145
an humanitarian growing up.

529
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:40,513
Yes.
You wanted to go on that trip

530
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,151
and feed the homeless and
teach English in the Orient.

531
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:47,488
My major was sort of
like women

532
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:49,556
and gender studies
through the lens...

533
00:25:49,623 --> 00:25:52,860
Oh, so you could run marches
like with the pink pussy hats.

534
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,562
Yes, exactly, that's
such a good idea, right?

535
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:59,066
You love to march
and you love to knit.

536
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:03,037
Our friend, Steve Epstein,
his son was like you.

537
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:08,008
He was studying what,
philosophy or photography.

538
00:26:08,075 --> 00:26:09,543
One of those things.

539
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:14,249
And his parents were terrified,
naturally, about his future.

540
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:16,451
I mean, how's he going
to make any money?

541
00:26:16,518 --> 00:26:17,819
Right?

542
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:21,956
But I mean, 20 years later,
he's a brain surgeon.

543
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:24,125
You never know.

544
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:25,527
Yeah, you never know.

545
00:26:27,562 --> 00:26:29,431
You may end up
being a brain surgeon.

546
00:26:29,497 --> 00:26:33,935
Yeah.

547
00:26:34,002 --> 00:26:35,404
Oh Sheila, I can do that.

548
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:36,605
- What?
- I can take that for you.

549
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,541
Oh, you are so lovely.
Thank you, darling.

550
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:39,141
Eli vomited
all over the kids' room.

551
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:40,309
It's okay.

552
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:41,010
- It's a mess in there.
- Yeah, I got it.

553
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:42,078
Okay, thank you.

554
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:45,181
Perfect,
babysitter to the rescue.

555
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:46,315
That's so sweet.

556
00:26:46,382 --> 00:26:47,283
You're a darling.

557
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,384
- I can help you.
- It's fine.

558
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:49,852
No, I want to.

559
00:26:51,053 --> 00:26:53,289
Such nice girls.

560
00:26:53,356 --> 00:26:54,490
Oh my God.

561
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:56,926
Why do people even
bring kids to shivas?

562
00:26:56,992 --> 00:27:00,931
Here, let me help you. I
don't want to get it on you.

563
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:01,898
Thanks.

564
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:05,469
I was trying to build
an app for...

565
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:09,206
Weren't you wearing
tights before?

566
00:27:09,272 --> 00:27:10,307
No.

567
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:12,075
No?

568
00:27:12,142 --> 00:27:13,543
Wait, why are you bleeding?

569
00:27:14,711 --> 00:27:16,012
As you know, I...

570
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,415
Really neat.

571
00:27:18,482 --> 00:27:20,951
It just got caught in
something, it's fine.

572
00:27:21,017 --> 00:27:23,421
Well, you have an
open wound on your leg.

573
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:25,623
It's a scratch.

574
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,177
Why do you keep
looking over there?

575
00:27:47,246 --> 00:27:50,616
- Where?
- At the skinny blonde woman.

576
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:52,918
I'm not looking at her.

577
00:27:52,985 --> 00:27:56,655
Okay, she's very pretty,
but she's too old for you.

578
00:27:56,722 --> 00:28:00,559
I don't think
she's pretty.

579
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:03,797
Malibu Barbie's not pretty?

580
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:07,065
I mean she's just
like basic, y'know?

581
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:10,336
Like she's just
like generic looking.

582
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:11,772
She's like generic pretty.

583
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,674
She's possibly the most
beautiful person I've ever seen

584
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:15,975
Seriously?

585
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,277
I just wouldn't be into
her is what I'm saying.

586
00:28:17,343 --> 00:28:19,679
She has like the essence
I want in 15 years.

587
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:21,281
What,

588
00:28:21,347 --> 00:28:24,017
like boring?

589
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:29,189
Boring wife who...

590
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:34,361
doesn't have sex
and is like... mean.

591
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:35,864
No, she's like
a hot businesswoman,

592
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:39,768
basically a single mom, so
stressed out but you can't tell

593
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:41,101
It's like, goals.

594
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:45,105
- She's not a businesswoman.
- Yeah, she is.

595
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:46,540
She's an entrepreneur.

596
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:47,943
No, she's not.

597
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:49,443
Yeah, my mom told me she
has like three businesses.

598
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,678
But that's what I'm saying,

599
00:28:50,744 --> 00:28:53,180
you can't tell because
she's so chill about it.

600
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:56,617
Why does she have three?

601
00:28:58,286 --> 00:28:59,488
Did they all just like fail?

602
00:28:59,554 --> 00:29:01,389
Okay, you're projecting
like a lot of misogyny

603
00:29:01,456 --> 00:29:03,658
for a future
woman's march organizer.

604
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:05,560
What's goin' on?

605
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:07,329
- What kinda company?
- It's like a stop-down.

606
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:08,230
What's that?

607
00:29:08,296 --> 00:29:09,731
What kind of company was it?

608
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:10,699
Excuse me.

609
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,668
What are you?

610
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:15,771
Nothing,
thank you for helping me.

611
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:20,375
You're being so weird.

612
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,278
I'm not being weird.

613
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:26,249
- Hi, so good to see you.
- Hi, mazel tov.

614
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:28,217
- Okay, yeah.
- Bye.

615
00:29:28,284 --> 00:29:29,085
Come here.

616
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,687
What? Why are you dragging me?

617
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:33,189
I thought you were
a vegetarian.

618
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:36,225
I am, you said that, you
said that you wanted me to eat.

619
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:39,095
Your behavior right now
is completely unacceptable.

620
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:41,264
Okay, I think you
need to relax.

621
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,632
Don't you tell me to relax.

622
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,367
You are flirting with everyone.

623
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:45,501
You are chugging wine.

624
00:29:45,568 --> 00:29:47,571
You are sitting on a table.

625
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:49,039
What is this, a party?

626
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:52,543
And I thought I told you no
funny business with Maya.

627
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:53,510
I don't know what that means.

628
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:54,244
Oh yes you do.

629
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:55,412
Don't play dumb with me.

630
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:57,648
I thought you were
done experimenting.

631
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,550
You think everyone
that's bi is experimenting.

632
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:02,119
You don't know anything.
You have zero gaydar.

633
00:30:02,185 --> 00:30:03,186
Excuse me, kid?

634
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:04,756
I lived through New York
in the '80s.

635
00:30:04,822 --> 00:30:06,723
My gaydar is strong as a bull.

636
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:08,659
- Look at this waist!
- Oh my God.

637
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:11,129
Hi darling,
how was spin class?

638
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:13,331
Oh, it was good,
but look at this one.

639
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:14,365
Is she not eating?

640
00:30:14,432 --> 00:30:15,099
- Right?
- How much does she weigh?

641
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,534
How much you weigh?

642
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:18,303
Uh, I don't know.

643
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:21,139
Oh, come on.

644
00:30:21,205 --> 00:30:22,574
Do you want me
to get on a scale?

645
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,609
You're so funny,
look at this punum.

646
00:30:27,345 --> 00:30:27,745
You're okay.

647
00:30:28,948 --> 00:30:30,816
Who the fuck brings
a baby to a shiva?

648
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:32,650
She doesn't know,
she's not Jewish.

649
00:30:32,717 --> 00:30:34,386
What do you mean, you
told me she converted?

650
00:30:34,453 --> 00:30:35,621
Converted, shmerted,

651
00:30:35,688 --> 00:30:37,456
she doesn't even know
how to say rugelach.

652
00:30:37,523 --> 00:30:38,324
You know what?

653
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,492
I heard her dad was Jewish.

654
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,294
That doesn't count.

655
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:44,330
Anyway, she's very charming.

656
00:30:44,396 --> 00:30:47,333
They seem very happy,
very happy, sweet couple.

657
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:48,802
She seems like a pill to me.

658
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:50,703
She's very hard-working.

659
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,806
Oh yeah, okay,
a hard-working pill.

660
00:30:52,872 --> 00:30:54,440
You know what
I don't understand?

661
00:30:54,506 --> 00:30:55,407
What?

662
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:57,944
Nice Jewish boy
marries a shiksa

663
00:30:58,011 --> 00:31:00,781
when he could have any
wonderful woman here.

664
00:31:00,848 --> 00:31:02,749
Like look at
this beautiful girl.

665
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:05,886
Right? Oh wait, wait,
sweetie, you got schmutz.

666
00:31:05,953 --> 00:31:07,554
- Stop.
- I'm just helping you.

667
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:09,623
I'm just getting the
schmutz off your face.

668
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:11,324
Anyway, the thing is

669
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,195
- I think she's the breadwinner.
- The breadwinner.

670
00:31:15,261 --> 00:31:16,730
And where do you think
she got that money,

671
00:31:16,797 --> 00:31:18,866
maybe from his dad?

672
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:19,332
Maury?

673
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,433
Maury.

674
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,368
Maury doesn't have
a pot to piss in.

675
00:31:21,434 --> 00:31:23,604
Oh, because he's so generous.

676
00:31:23,671 --> 00:31:25,339
Everybody knows
his business is kaput.

677
00:31:25,406 --> 00:31:26,641
But that's not his fault.

678
00:31:26,707 --> 00:31:29,644
That's not, oh, look
at you defending Maury.

679
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,879
I forgot
you have a crush on him.

680
00:31:30,946 --> 00:31:33,214
- I don't have a crush on him.
- Oh yes you do.

681
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,082
Don't be ridiculous.

682
00:31:34,148 --> 00:31:35,750
He was just very kind at a time.

683
00:31:35,817 --> 00:31:37,052
Oh, very kind, yes. Very kind.

684
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:39,253
- At a time, it was difficult...
- A giant schlong.

685
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,890
- Oh, stop it.
- He schtups like a champ.

686
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:43,457
Oh, where did you hear that?

687
00:31:43,524 --> 00:31:44,191
- I'm sorry.
- Don't answer that.

688
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:45,393
Where did you hear that?

689
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:47,496
Don't answer, don't tell
me, but I'd like to know

690
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:48,263
at a later date.

691
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,498
Excuse me, darling,

692
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:50,900
but I'm not gonna talk
about this anymore.

693
00:31:50,967 --> 00:31:53,235
- We can talk about it later.
- Thank you, thank you.

694
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:55,370
Because the shiksa might
be able to get her a job.

695
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:56,072
- Mom, no.
- Oh, a job?

696
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:57,006
- Go.
- Mom.

697
00:31:57,073 --> 00:31:57,807
Of course, of course, go, go.

698
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,942
Don't be shy, speak up.

699
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:01,778
This is my daughter, Danielle.

700
00:32:01,844 --> 00:32:02,678
What's the matter?

701
00:32:02,744 --> 00:32:03,913
You wanna hold her, sweetie?

702
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,547
You can calm her down,
you're a babysitter.

703
00:32:05,614 --> 00:32:06,949
Um, I'm okay.

704
00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:08,785
Somebody's very tired.

705
00:32:08,851 --> 00:32:10,453
You're good sport,
sweetie.

706
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,889
Needs a nap.

707
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:14,390
She needs
a little nappy nap.

708
00:32:14,457 --> 00:32:17,795
Well, everybody's
crying, it's a shiva.

709
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:19,863
Hi, I'm Kim Beckett.

710
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,731
Hi, nice to meet you.

711
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:23,801
And that's Rose.

712
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:27,537
Hey, that was you not
too long ago, sweetie.

713
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:29,706
Danielle is about to graduate.

714
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:30,908
Congratulations.

715
00:32:30,974 --> 00:32:32,810
Do you know what college
you're going to yet?

716
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:34,545
I'm in college.

717
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:35,947
Oh.

718
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:36,647
Actually.

719
00:32:36,714 --> 00:32:38,215
Yeah, of course.

720
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:43,520
So Joel was saying that maybe
you have a job offer for her?

721
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,588
Yeah, we were
just telling Kim

722
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:46,724
what a fantastic
babysitter you are.

723
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:48,026
I'm looking for someone.

724
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:51,062
I mean, might be good
to fill it in part time

725
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:54,866
while you're looking
for whatever it is

726
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,067
that you're gonna do.

727
00:32:56,134 --> 00:32:58,636
I mean, good babysitters
are so hard to find.

728
00:32:58,703 --> 00:32:59,270
It's impossible.

729
00:32:59,337 --> 00:33:00,773
It sure is.

730
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,308
That's so nice of you to offer,
I'm actually fully booked.

731
00:33:03,374 --> 00:33:04,877
Sweetie, you've only
got one family, right?

732
00:33:04,944 --> 00:33:07,579
- It can't take that much time.
- How would you know that, Dad?

733
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:09,481
You make your deposits
once a month,

734
00:33:09,547 --> 00:33:10,715
it's not rocket science.

735
00:33:10,783 --> 00:33:12,918
Why are you looking
into my account so much?

736
00:33:12,985 --> 00:33:15,353
Because they're ours,
sweetheart, that's why.

737
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,991
Anyway, the point is
that I think Danielle

738
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:22,328
was more interested
in an office job,

739
00:33:22,394 --> 00:33:24,898
like at your office
doing clerical work

740
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:26,900
or something like that.

741
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:29,970
I mean, you're such an
amazing entrepreneur.

742
00:33:30,036 --> 00:33:31,470
A real self-made woman.

743
00:33:31,537 --> 00:33:33,807
Yeah, it's fantastic, you've
got so many different things

744
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:34,640
going on all at once.

745
00:33:34,707 --> 00:33:35,574
Terrific.

746
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:37,643
I have to with his lifestyle.

747
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,045
Really, that's funny.

748
00:33:39,112 --> 00:33:41,915
I never would have pegged
you for a man of luxury, Max.

749
00:33:41,982 --> 00:33:43,016
Oh, are you kidding me?

750
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:44,985
Him and his friends
go to the most

751
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:48,122
ridiculously expensive
restaurants, don't you?

752
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:50,457
I mean, they're foodies.

753
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:52,794
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

754
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,061
- Oh, could you get me one?
- Sure.

755
00:33:54,128 --> 00:33:57,364
So, I don't know, if
you change your mind,

756
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,767
if you find yourself
with some time,

757
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:01,936
I'm actually working
from home right now.

758
00:34:02,003 --> 00:34:04,038
But I really could use somebody

759
00:34:04,105 --> 00:34:07,374
to help with the organizing,
scheduling, things like that.

760
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,576
I mean, we could really
tailor it to something

761
00:34:09,643 --> 00:34:13,048
that you like, if you
think that would suit you.

762
00:34:13,115 --> 00:34:14,917
- That'd be great.
- That sounds wonderful.

763
00:34:14,983 --> 00:34:18,086
Um, no, that's so nice
of you to offer, I just,

764
00:34:18,153 --> 00:34:20,923
I don't think that's
anything that I would like.

765
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:24,525
I don't really wanna be
like a girl boss type of,

766
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:25,894
that's not my thing.

767
00:34:28,163 --> 00:34:31,432
But it's very cool that
that's what you do.

768
00:34:31,499 --> 00:34:32,400
Right.

769
00:34:33,902 --> 00:34:38,842
That's so funny,
I have the same...

770
00:34:38,908 --> 00:34:40,676
...bracelet.

771
00:34:40,742 --> 00:34:42,611
- Really?
- Oh, neat.

772
00:34:43,712 --> 00:34:45,414
Would you look at that?

773
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,548
You do, ah.

774
00:34:46,615 --> 00:34:48,818
I guess we both
have fabulous taste.

775
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:51,020
Well, you and Max.

776
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:53,589
I would say
it's a little bit extravagant.

777
00:34:53,655 --> 00:34:55,091
- Really?
- But um, that's him.

778
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:56,425
Was it a special present?

779
00:34:56,491 --> 00:34:59,063
Was it for your high school
graduation or something?

780
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:00,331
Yeah, I
think so, must have been.

781
00:35:00,396 --> 00:35:02,565
Yeah, something like that.

782
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:03,633
- Sure.
- Yeah.

783
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,135
Oh, I thought you
were in college.

784
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:06,237
I am.

785
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:09,439
It's just that
it's a new collection.

786
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,776
Max, what are you
doing over there?

787
00:35:12,843 --> 00:35:14,744
Listen, if you guys
need a ride,

788
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,046
I happen to have
the van outside.

789
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:18,883
Sweetie, are you sure
we got you that bracelet?

790
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:21,118
Yeah, I mean
I can't afford this.

791
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,122
We can't afford it, either.

792
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,858
Yeah, I'm pretty sure,
it must have been you.

793
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,593
- It had to have been.
- I guess so.

794
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,729
Shit.

795
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,496
- Whoa.
- I'm sorry.

796
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,899
Somebody's popular.

797
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,000
- Busy guy.
- Work emails,

798
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,433
getting them all at once.

799
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,071
Seriously, the service in
here, it's terrible.

800
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,844
- I got it.
- No no no, I got it.

801
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,649
I'm so sorry.

802
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,451
I'm sorry.

803
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:57,189
Did any of it get on her?

804
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:59,557
- She's okay, are you okay?
- It's okay, it's okay.

805
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,063
Oh my God, are you okay?

806
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,464
- Yeah.
- Oh sweetie, come with me.

807
00:36:08,134 --> 00:36:10,203
I know, I know, I know.

808
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:14,074
I'm so so sorry,
is she all right?

809
00:36:14,141 --> 00:36:17,743
Well thank God Sheila's
coffee is always lukewarm

810
00:36:17,811 --> 00:36:19,980
or you'd have
third degree burns.

811
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:36,197
Are we allowed to use that?

812
00:36:36,264 --> 00:36:38,665
This, oh God'll forgive us.

813
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:40,201
It's too crazy in there.

814
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:47,008
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to, it was...

815
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:48,475
It happens.

816
00:36:55,682 --> 00:36:56,851
Mommy?

817
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:58,253
Yeah, bubala?

818
00:37:01,957 --> 00:37:04,093
Are you disappointed in me?

819
00:37:05,995 --> 00:37:07,029
What?

820
00:37:08,763 --> 00:37:10,032
No.

821
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:12,567
Um, sorry.

822
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:13,902
Excuse me.

823
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:16,071
Bye Gloria, see you next week.

824
00:37:21,243 --> 00:37:22,112
Danny,

825
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:25,849
you're not?

826
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:31,121
Sheila, I can help
you with these chairs.

827
00:37:31,187 --> 00:37:32,789
Oh, you're an angel.

828
00:37:32,856 --> 00:37:34,858
Sheila... okay.

829
00:37:34,924 --> 00:37:36,092
We were having a conversation.

830
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,861
My cleaning lady
got the flu yesterday

831
00:37:37,927 --> 00:37:39,095
and it's just the worst timing.

832
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:39,695
All right, all right.

833
00:37:39,762 --> 00:37:41,097
Thank you.

834
00:37:41,164 --> 00:37:43,266
If you can put 'em up
against that wall over there.

835
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:44,200
Yeah.

836
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:03,720
Hey, I can help you.

837
00:38:09,828 --> 00:38:11,229
- Thanks.
- Mm hm.

838
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:17,701
Nice cum stain.

839
00:38:18,937 --> 00:38:21,840
Seriously, you need to
be less sensitive, okay?

840
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:23,641
Excuse me.

841
00:38:23,707 --> 00:38:24,675
Wait, you need to
stop biting your nails.

842
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:26,845
- It's so gross.
- Can you stop?

843
00:38:26,912 --> 00:38:28,180
This is so pretty.

844
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:29,014
Where did you get it?

845
00:38:29,081 --> 00:38:30,215
I don't know.

846
00:38:30,282 --> 00:38:31,249
What do you
mean you don't know?

847
00:38:31,316 --> 00:38:33,185
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

848
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:34,454
Wait, it's unclasped.

849
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,688
Did you buy it with
your babysitting money?

850
00:38:36,755 --> 00:38:37,622
You're being a bitch.

851
00:38:37,689 --> 00:38:38,791
I'm not being a bitch.

852
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,724
Hi.

853
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:41,794
Hi.

854
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:43,695
Hi, I'm Max.

855
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,764
Maya.

856
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:48,334
Are you Danielle's cousin
or sister or something?

857
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,336
'Cause you guys
look really similar.

858
00:38:50,403 --> 00:38:51,703
Uh, no.

859
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,973
But we do kinda look alike,
it's kinda fucked up.

860
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,074
We grew up together.

861
00:38:55,141 --> 00:38:57,243
Oh, so kinda like family.

862
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,079
I don't know,
we went to prom together.

863
00:38:59,146 --> 00:39:00,814
Oh, that's so sweet.

864
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:03,083
It is so sweet, you're right.

865
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,153
She was like late and
brought me a dead corsage.

866
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,054
It wasn't dead.

867
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:08,721
It was fully a dead flower.

868
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,327
I feel like you two
had a really fun prom.

869
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:14,995
You bet that we did, yeah.

870
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,830
- We like caught a limo.
- Uh huh, yeah.

871
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,165
You spiked the punch, puking

872
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:19,199
everywhere
and like smokin' blunts.

873
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:20,968
- And we like fucked.
- Maya!

874
00:39:21,034 --> 00:39:22,837
She had her first orgasm.

875
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:24,272
What the fuck is wrong with you?

876
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:25,940
What,
it was a night to remember.

877
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:26,673
Ooh, sorry Mort.

878
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,209
Mort, how are ya?

879
00:39:28,276 --> 00:39:30,245
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

880
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:32,280
Just like sisters.

881
00:39:33,448 --> 00:39:35,383
Yeah, like a good
sister fucks her sister.

882
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,618
What the hell?

883
00:39:36,683 --> 00:39:38,853
So, are you
in the arts, as well?

884
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,055
Oh no, absolutely not.
I'm going to law school.

885
00:39:41,122 --> 00:39:43,892
Oh, you're the one
going to law school.

886
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:45,794
As opp..., what do you know me?

887
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:48,864
Danielle hasn't told us
what her post-grad plan is.

888
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:51,000
Yeah I did, I said I
have interviews lined up.

889
00:39:51,066 --> 00:39:53,435
And some
other babysitting gigs?

890
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,972
Or maybe you'd just be
sticking with the one?

891
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,440
No, Danielle doesn't
need to work

892
00:39:58,507 --> 00:40:00,242
because her parents
pay for everything

893
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:02,411
while she does her
like art thing.

894
00:40:02,478 --> 00:40:04,046
Really?

895
00:40:04,113 --> 00:40:06,348
You must be really in love
with this kid

896
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:10,854
if you don't need
to be getting paid.

897
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:19,596
I'm sorry, how do you
guys know each other?

898
00:40:19,663 --> 00:40:21,831
- Oh, we met in temple.
- We met at shul, yeah.

899
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:23,033
Why?

900
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:24,367
- You never go to temple.
- I go sometimes.

901
00:40:24,434 --> 00:40:27,070
So now you're just like
a deeply religious person?

902
00:40:27,137 --> 00:40:29,105
You can go without
being super religious.

903
00:40:29,172 --> 00:40:30,773
- You can be regular...
- Maya.

904
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,042
...religious and go.

905
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:33,443
Questionable.

906
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,146
Maya?

907
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:36,214
Oh, okay.

908
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,049
Bye, nice to meet you.

909
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:47,391
You're full of surprises today.

910
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:54,832
So are we good?

911
00:40:58,937 --> 00:40:59,838
Yeah.

912
00:41:09,248 --> 00:41:10,115
Why wouldn't we be?

913
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:21,326
So, have you seen
the new rabbi?

914
00:41:21,393 --> 00:41:24,597
If Robert De Niro and Gene
Kelly had a Jewish baby.

915
00:41:24,664 --> 00:41:26,399
Cute, so cute.

916
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:27,533
For you cute
or for Danny cute?

917
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,204
For all of us cute.
Cute is cute.

918
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:33,306
But I want someone
good for Danny.

919
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:34,507
Well, of course.

920
00:41:34,574 --> 00:41:36,276
And I'm trying to
find someone, it's just.

921
00:41:36,342 --> 00:41:37,910
- Hey.
- You're back.

922
00:41:40,046 --> 00:41:41,247
- Aw, so pretty.
- Hi, sweetie.

923
00:41:41,314 --> 00:41:42,382
Hi.

924
00:41:42,448 --> 00:41:44,284
So, are you
seeing anyone?

925
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,620
No one we
wanna discuss right now.

926
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:47,121
What?

927
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:51,125
I thought you'd be swatting
the boys away like flies.

928
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:54,028
Well I wish she would swat
them away a little harder.

929
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,496
Uh, I swat.

930
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:57,965
Don't listen to your mother.

931
00:41:58,032 --> 00:42:02,269
Have fun, enjoy, enjoy
this little, little body.

932
00:42:02,336 --> 00:42:04,938
I want her to enjoy
her little, little body,

933
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:07,274
but get a vibrator,
don't get a relationship.

934
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:08,008
Mom.

935
00:42:08,075 --> 00:42:09,109
It's not the same.

936
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:11,313
I just want her
to finish her finals

937
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:12,547
and meet someone after that.

938
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:13,815
Of course, yeah.
That's true, it's true.

939
00:42:13,882 --> 00:42:17,118
Listen to your mother
and don't marry anyone

940
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:20,255
'til you've slept with like
what? At least 10 people.

941
00:42:20,322 --> 00:42:22,290
Because you're gonna
end up with one

942
00:42:22,357 --> 00:42:24,059
and you'll be wiping
his arthritic ass

943
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,493
for the rest of your life.

944
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:28,530
You know
who I ran into recently

945
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:30,932
whose son would be
perfect for her?

946
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:32,067
Who did I run into?

947
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,270
Danny, you know
that guy, tell her.

948
00:42:34,337 --> 00:42:35,371
Tell her.

949
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:37,239
No, Mom, I don't want to.

950
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:38,140
I have to go to the bathroom.

951
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,909
- Oh.
- You tell her.

952
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,345
I'm worried about her.

953
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:43,245
- What are you worried about?
- I don't know.

954
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:45,581
She's acting a little strange.

955
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:49,051
- She is? A little different?
- Yeah, just off.

956
00:42:49,118 --> 00:42:50,119
Off?

957
00:42:50,186 --> 00:42:51,454
- Yeah, a little.
- Like distracted?

958
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,489
- Like distracted.
- Distracted, but distracted.

959
00:42:53,556 --> 00:42:56,192
- It's treatable.
- Very distracted.

960
00:42:56,258 --> 00:42:58,061
- It's not a disease.
- That's true.

961
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:15,145
Just a second.

962
00:43:24,322 --> 00:43:25,957
Sorry about that.

963
00:44:49,945 --> 00:44:51,245
Oh, what a day.

964
00:44:51,312 --> 00:44:53,047
Did you guys get enough to eat?

965
00:44:54,248 --> 00:44:55,249
How are you doing?

966
00:44:55,316 --> 00:44:57,051
You know,
it's just weird.

967
00:44:59,254 --> 00:45:01,122
Hey, Danny, sweetie.

968
00:45:02,424 --> 00:45:03,325
Are you okay?

969
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:04,794
Yeah, can we go
like now please?

970
00:45:04,861 --> 00:45:08,096
Yeah, if you can drag your
father away from everybody.

971
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,464
Okay, I'll do that.

972
00:45:09,531 --> 00:45:11,233
- Sweetie.
- What?

973
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:12,734
Thank you for coming.

974
00:45:12,802 --> 00:45:15,437
Yeah, well you asked me
to be here, so whatever.

975
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:18,206
I know, and I know it's not
something that you like to do.

976
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:21,577
And, obviously, and I
just want you to know

977
00:45:21,644 --> 00:45:23,279
that I appreciate it, okay?

978
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:24,113
You're welcome.

979
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,849
You are such a good kid.

980
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:26,749
Thanks.

981
00:45:26,817 --> 00:45:27,851
You are.

982
00:45:27,918 --> 00:45:29,218
How did I raise get
such a good girl?

983
00:45:29,285 --> 00:45:30,186
Mom.

984
00:45:30,253 --> 00:45:31,220
Are you on drugs?

985
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:32,288
- No.
- Oh, I'm just kidding.

986
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:34,858
No really,
you are such a good girl.

987
00:45:34,925 --> 00:45:37,393
I love you.

988
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,728
I love you too, Mom.

989
00:45:38,795 --> 00:45:40,229
Oh my God.

990
00:45:40,296 --> 00:45:41,497
Wait a sec,

991
00:45:41,564 --> 00:45:43,499
I haven't had a chance
to catch up with you yet.

992
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:44,634
How are you?

993
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,170
Where did you go, Danielle?

994
00:45:47,237 --> 00:45:48,705
Where did you go?

995
00:45:48,772 --> 00:45:50,707
You're skin and
bones.

996
00:45:52,342 --> 00:45:53,811
- Yeah.
- What are you up to?

997
00:45:53,878 --> 00:45:56,814
Besides starving yourself
to death?

998
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:57,748
Just...

999
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:00,617
...studying.

1000
00:46:00,684 --> 00:46:02,653
You have a boyfriend?

1001
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,521
- No.
- Ah, really?

1002
00:46:04,588 --> 00:46:06,390
I don't believe you.

1003
00:46:06,456 --> 00:46:08,559
I have nothing serious.

1004
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:12,664
So you just study
and don't eat

1005
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,633
and go out with your
beautiful friends, is that it?

1006
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,268
Is that your life?

1007
00:46:17,335 --> 00:46:19,604
Yeah, I guess that's my life.

1008
00:46:19,671 --> 00:46:22,206
Well, lucky you.

1009
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:24,309
Um.

1010
00:46:25,677 --> 00:46:27,545
Can you, um, excuse me?

1011
00:46:27,612 --> 00:46:30,315
I haven't eaten yet,
I have to go...

1012
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,420
unstarve myself.

1013
00:46:36,622 --> 00:46:37,690
Excuse me.

1014
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,230
Excuse me.

1015
00:46:47,867 --> 00:46:49,035
- Danielle.
- Yeah.

1016
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:51,337
- Um, I'm just gonna go.
- Oh, there you are.

1017
00:46:52,638 --> 00:46:54,773
Um, I'm just gonna go.

1018
00:47:13,526 --> 00:47:14,427
Hey.

1019
00:47:24,772 --> 00:47:25,807
Are you okay?

1020
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,277
I'm like.

1021
00:47:38,854 --> 00:47:39,754
What?

1022
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:43,724
Nothing.

1023
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:44,225
What, what is it?

1024
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,160
What?

1025
00:47:45,227 --> 00:47:46,461
It's literally nothing, okay?

1026
00:47:46,528 --> 00:47:48,363
Well you're laughing, so
what's so fucking funny?

1027
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,498
Nothing's fucking funny.

1028
00:47:49,564 --> 00:47:50,699
Nothing's funny.

1029
00:47:55,905 --> 00:47:56,806
Okay.

1030
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,178
I miss you, okay?

1031
00:48:07,716 --> 00:48:11,721
And I was like
excited to see you.

1032
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,725
Great, whatever,
it's what a fuck.

1033
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:16,860
I'll fuck off.

1034
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,562
Okay, I miss you too.

1035
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:20,530
Sick.

1036
00:48:21,464 --> 00:48:22,398
That's awesome.

1037
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:23,566
Cool, cool.

1038
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:24,434
Great, awesome.

1039
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,938
Well, I wouldn't know because
you literally never text me.

1040
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,808
That is simply not true,
I text you all the time.

1041
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:31,909
I didn't even know
you were coming today.

1042
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,010
Well you don't text
me either, so I.

1043
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,612
I replied
to your fucking story

1044
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:36,680
and you just like saw it.

1045
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,049
You do not reply
to a reply, okay?

1046
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:39,550
Well, you should.

1047
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:42,419
That's psychotic behavior,
but that makes sense for you.

1048
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:43,787
Why don't you fucking reach out?

1049
00:48:43,855 --> 00:48:44,688
I just told you that I did.

1050
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,057
I told you that I reached out.

1051
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:48,059
Okay, why didn't you
just call me like an adult?

1052
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:49,293
Nobody calls, so.

1053
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,929
Well, grow up.

1054
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,866
Be different than other people.

1055
00:49:19,158 --> 00:49:20,458
Okay, cool.

1056
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:22,428
I'll see you later.

1057
00:49:40,412 --> 00:49:43,817
- Look, she's eating.
- Oh look, she's eating!

1058
00:49:52,626 --> 00:49:53,895
You can go ahead.

1059
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,941
Uh huh.

1060
00:50:38,007 --> 00:50:40,877
It was Lucy's graduation
present from me.

1061
00:50:40,944 --> 00:50:42,778
Aw, that's so sweet.

1062
00:50:42,846 --> 00:50:45,982
That's really nice. Can I see?

1063
00:50:47,716 --> 00:50:50,053
Oh, you guys are
at the Holocaust Museum.

1064
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,089
You look so...

1065
00:50:53,156 --> 00:50:54,423
happy.

1066
00:51:03,968 --> 00:51:05,435
I'm just wondering.

1067
00:51:07,171 --> 00:51:08,038
Uh huh.

1068
00:51:09,672 --> 00:51:10,640
How old is she?

1069
00:51:13,043 --> 00:51:15,946
- Oh, she's 18 months.
- Mm hm.

1070
00:51:20,919 --> 00:51:24,788
You two know each other
because of your parents?

1071
00:51:24,856 --> 00:51:26,457
Yeah.

1072
00:51:26,523 --> 00:51:27,424
No.

1073
00:51:30,561 --> 00:51:31,462
No?

1074
00:51:37,534 --> 00:51:38,870
We met at shul.

1075
00:51:38,937 --> 00:51:40,471
Yeah, shul.

1076
00:51:42,908 --> 00:51:46,678
Ah.

1077
00:51:46,745 --> 00:51:47,512
Or did we?

1078
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,119
I can't remember.

1079
00:51:53,185 --> 00:51:56,421
And this is us in
Israel at Mason's bar mitzvah.

1080
00:51:57,622 --> 00:52:01,160
I mean Israel, Palestine,
whatever they're calling it now

1081
00:52:01,227 --> 00:52:02,261
I don't know.

1082
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,163
- That's a nice photo.
- You think?

1083
00:52:04,964 --> 00:52:06,032
- I love it.
- Danielle.

1084
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:08,000
Danielle, listen,
can you call my phone?

1085
00:52:08,067 --> 00:52:09,769
I lost it,
I can't find it anywhere.

1086
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:10,971
Yeah, sure.

1087
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,508
Shit, I don't have my phone.

1088
00:52:15,574 --> 00:52:18,644
Great, nevermind
I'll ask your mother.

1089
00:52:18,711 --> 00:52:20,180
Deb.

1090
00:52:20,247 --> 00:52:20,847
Deb.

1091
00:52:47,342 --> 00:52:50,211
SUGAR APP: WHAT KIND OF
ARRANGEMENT ARE YOU INTERESTED IN?

1092
00:52:50,278 --> 00:52:53,147
SUGAR APP: BigDaddy481
VIEWED YOUR PROFILE

1093
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,106
You have
a fakakta memory.

1094
00:53:17,172 --> 00:53:18,273
You keep losing everything.

1095
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,807
So, maybe
I do have dementia.

1096
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:23,113
Yeah, you've had
dementia since our wedding day.

1097
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:24,713
Anybody can forget
a ring, you know.

1098
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,781
It's not such a big deal.

1099
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:26,682
You know what,
look for your own phone.

1100
00:53:26,749 --> 00:53:29,019
It's probably by the desserts.

1101
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:30,153
Thank you.

1102
00:53:35,425 --> 00:53:36,259
Hey.

1103
00:53:36,326 --> 00:53:36,993
Hi.

1104
00:53:38,061 --> 00:53:39,695
Have you seen my phone?

1105
00:53:39,762 --> 00:53:40,796
No.

1106
00:53:40,864 --> 00:53:42,999
Shoot, I'm looking
'cause I'm...

1107
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:45,136
I'm trying to find it
because I need it right now.

1108
00:53:45,202 --> 00:53:47,071
Why do you need it right now?

1109
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:52,009
I just like told someone
that I met here

1110
00:53:52,076 --> 00:53:53,277
that I would send
them my resume.

1111
00:53:53,344 --> 00:53:56,914
Oh, feels like you have
so many job prospects.

1112
00:53:56,981 --> 00:53:59,150
I'm sure you can find
more here, y'know?

1113
00:54:01,385 --> 00:54:04,121
Okay,
so you haven't seen it or?

1114
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:06,623
I don't know,
I might have seen it,

1115
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:10,295
like in the kitchen
or in the bathroom.

1116
00:54:10,362 --> 00:54:14,632
But y'know, it was unlocked.

1117
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,703
So you might wanna find it

1118
00:54:21,306 --> 00:54:23,208
before like somebody else does.

1119
00:54:26,945 --> 00:54:29,281
Oh Danielle, I need your
help. I'm running out of lox.

1120
00:54:29,347 --> 00:54:31,749
- One second. Maya...
- Get the fuck off me.

1121
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:35,587
Please don't tell anyone.
Please.

1122
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:40,159
Danielle, I love your parents.

1123
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,065
I just wouldn't
want them to know

1124
00:54:46,132 --> 00:54:48,134
their daughter's
a fuckin' whore.

1125
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,845
Danielle, the
lox is in the kitchen.

1126
00:54:57,911 --> 00:54:58,811
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

1127
00:55:44,092 --> 00:55:45,294
Danielle!

1128
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:46,862
Jerry clogged the toilet again

1129
00:55:46,929 --> 00:55:48,663
and the place smells like shit.

1130
00:55:52,368 --> 00:55:54,036
Bubala,
where you running off to?

1131
00:55:54,103 --> 00:55:56,906
Look at this baby, so adorable.

1132
00:55:56,972 --> 00:55:58,340
Sleeping like a baby.

1133
00:55:58,407 --> 00:56:00,075
Tears of gold, this baby cries.

1134
00:56:00,142 --> 00:56:01,844
Listen, sweetie, you
don't have to worry.

1135
00:56:01,911 --> 00:56:03,145
I found my phone,

1136
00:56:03,212 --> 00:56:04,380
you don't have to think
about looking for it.

1137
00:56:04,446 --> 00:56:05,581
She was never
worried about your phone.

1138
00:56:05,648 --> 00:56:08,317
How long have
you guys been together?

1139
00:56:08,384 --> 00:56:10,353
Almost five years.

1140
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:11,154
Mm hm.

1141
00:56:11,221 --> 00:56:12,989
And how did you meet?

1142
00:56:13,056 --> 00:56:14,024
Online.

1143
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:15,125
Mm hm.

1144
00:56:15,192 --> 00:56:17,793
You're very curious,
aren't you?

1145
00:56:17,861 --> 00:56:21,264
I'm just wondering how
female entrepreneurs do it all.

1146
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:24,834
Well, they need
a great support system.

1147
00:56:26,169 --> 00:56:28,171
Right, you need a
husband who's supportive

1148
00:56:28,238 --> 00:56:30,773
of young female entrepreneurs.

1149
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,209
Right.

1150
00:56:32,275 --> 00:56:37,381
I'm surprised you're able
to work from home, y'know?

1151
00:56:38,082 --> 00:56:39,317
Where do you live again?

1152
00:56:39,383 --> 00:56:41,452
I mean we've always
had the Soho apartment.

1153
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:42,620
Soho.

1154
00:56:42,687 --> 00:56:43,487
Because how could
we let go of that,

1155
00:56:43,554 --> 00:56:46,390
it's just the best location.

1156
00:56:46,457 --> 00:56:50,394
But a few months ago, we
got the house out here.

1157
00:56:50,461 --> 00:56:55,299
Just seemed like
the logical next step,

1158
00:56:55,366 --> 00:56:58,103
especially if we're
gonna have another kid.

1159
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,071
Baby!

1160
00:57:00,339 --> 00:57:01,573
Another wonderful baby.

1161
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,807
Wonderful.

1162
00:57:02,874 --> 00:57:04,009
I wish I could have
my own bachelor pad

1163
00:57:04,076 --> 00:57:07,812
where I could do whatever
the fuck I wanted.

1164
00:57:08,647 --> 00:57:09,081
- Hey.
- What?

1165
00:57:09,147 --> 00:57:09,814
Danielle.

1166
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:11,350
What are you doing?

1167
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:13,185
She's just teasing,

1168
00:57:13,252 --> 00:57:15,954
she's got such a crazy
sense of humor sometimes.

1169
00:57:17,122 --> 00:57:18,190
Are you drunk?

1170
00:57:18,257 --> 00:57:22,262
Do you have a boyfriend
or girlfriend?

1171
00:57:22,328 --> 00:57:24,264
- Well, girlfriend.
- No girlfriends.

1172
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,966
- Please.
- Experimented, but.

1173
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:28,767
No, no.

1174
00:57:29,736 --> 00:57:31,871
It's just so hard
in my generation

1175
00:57:31,938 --> 00:57:35,308
because there's just
weird unconventional ways

1176
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:35,942
of meeting people.

1177
00:57:36,009 --> 00:57:37,043
Sure, sure.

1178
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:38,978
Like in apps
and stuff like that.

1179
00:57:39,045 --> 00:57:41,247
Oh darling, what are you so?

1180
00:57:41,314 --> 00:57:43,149
Of course you're gonna
find somebody soon.

1181
00:57:43,216 --> 00:57:46,120
Listen, Jdate has been
fantastic for me.

1182
00:57:46,186 --> 00:57:47,388
Have you tried JSwipe?

1183
00:57:47,454 --> 00:57:50,357
A little bit of lipstick,
a little bit of lipstick.

1184
00:57:50,424 --> 00:57:52,393
Oh, I always tell her
that about the lipstick.

1185
00:57:52,459 --> 00:57:53,927
You know what,
sweetheart?

1186
00:57:53,994 --> 00:57:56,630
I'm absolutely convinced it's
gonna be much much easier now.

1187
00:57:56,697 --> 00:57:59,967
She had kind of an extended
awkward phase, you know?

1188
00:58:00,034 --> 00:58:02,636
She had the braces and
she was kinda chubby

1189
00:58:02,703 --> 00:58:03,737
for quite a while.

1190
00:58:03,803 --> 00:58:05,239
- No.
- A little chubby.

1191
00:58:05,306 --> 00:58:06,006
Oh, you were so cute.

1192
00:58:06,073 --> 00:58:07,441
There was this boy,

1193
00:58:07,508 --> 00:58:09,978
she had a thing for him
forever, for the longest time.

1194
00:58:10,045 --> 00:58:11,379
His name was Michael, right?

1195
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:15,283
And she asked him to the
dance, and I guess he said no.

1196
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:18,887
Then like everybody at
school knew and saw.

1197
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,889
And I picked her up,
it was so sweet,

1198
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:21,990
the whole ride home,

1199
00:58:22,057 --> 00:58:23,258
there were these
little tears coming down.

1200
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:26,161
I felt bad, but y'know,
like she's my baby,

1201
00:58:26,227 --> 00:58:27,962
but everybody goes through it.

1202
00:58:28,029 --> 00:58:30,231
- It'll happen to your girl.
- Such a cutie.

1203
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,434
Remember the song
we used to sing her?

1204
00:58:32,501 --> 00:58:33,369
Of course.

1205
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:35,137
- Baby shake.
- Baby shake

1206
00:58:35,204 --> 00:58:36,505
When she was Rose's age,

1207
00:58:36,572 --> 00:58:40,676
we used to sing the baby
shake song whenever she cried.

1208
00:58:40,743 --> 00:58:42,978
That's what we should
have been doing with Rose.

1209
00:58:43,045 --> 00:58:45,581
- ♪ Let's make a baby shake ♪
- Stop

1210
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:49,919
- ♪ Let's make a baby shake ♪
- Please stop, Mom.

1211
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:52,321
- ♪ Let's make a baby shake ♪
- Mom.

1212
00:58:52,388 --> 00:58:54,023
- Can you let go?
- No, never.

1213
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:55,124
Everybody let go.

1214
00:58:55,191 --> 00:58:56,192
Never.

1215
00:58:56,258 --> 00:58:57,260
Stop.

1216
00:58:57,327 --> 00:58:58,061
Stop!

1217
00:58:58,128 --> 00:58:59,463
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1218
00:58:59,529 --> 00:59:01,164
- Whoa.
- Let go.

1219
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:03,533
Danny, just take it easy.

1220
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,535
Everything's okay, it's okay.

1221
00:59:05,602 --> 00:59:08,038
Yeah, just go go go go.

1222
00:59:08,105 --> 00:59:09,172
I'm gonna talk to her.

1223
00:59:11,475 --> 00:59:12,743
I know you don't
believe in me,

1224
00:59:12,809 --> 00:59:14,544
I know that you think that
I'm not gonna do anything

1225
00:59:14,611 --> 00:59:17,347
and you think that
I'm a little baby.

1226
00:59:17,414 --> 00:59:19,616
I don't think that
you're a little baby.

1227
00:59:22,286 --> 00:59:23,688
Oh my God.

1228
00:59:23,755 --> 00:59:25,390
Thank you
very much for joining me

1229
00:59:25,456 --> 00:59:29,293
and the Feldmans in
their time of mourning.

1230
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,964
If you would please join me in
reciting the mourner's kaddish.

1231
01:00:40,668 --> 01:00:42,570
Thank you very much.

1232
01:00:54,248 --> 01:00:55,149
Hey.

1233
01:00:55,683 --> 01:00:57,552
Hey hey hey hey hey.

1234
01:00:57,619 --> 01:00:59,154
Stop, stop, stop.

1235
01:00:59,221 --> 01:01:00,121
What?

1236
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:05,760
You know, I think,

1237
01:01:07,496 --> 01:01:10,999
I think it would be best
if we ended this.

1238
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,638
Sure, yeah.

1239
01:01:17,572 --> 01:01:19,374
We probably should
before your wife

1240
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:22,211
runs out of money.

1241
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:24,347
Is there a second bathroom?

1242
01:01:24,413 --> 01:01:26,682
Someone is taking
forever in this one.

1243
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:30,353
Um, I think
there's one upstairs.

1244
01:01:30,419 --> 01:01:31,420
You gotta speak up.

1245
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:33,789
There's another
bathroom upstairs.

1246
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:37,260
Forget it,
I'll wait til I'm home.

1247
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,196
Excuse me.

1248
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:44,668
I think we should
get going soon.

1249
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:51,174
Sure.

1250
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:15,099
Sorry.

1251
01:02:23,775 --> 01:02:26,177
Dad, can we go please?

1252
01:02:26,244 --> 01:02:29,247
Yeah, sure we can.
Just go ask your mother.

1253
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:32,919
Mom, can we go now?

1254
01:02:32,986 --> 01:02:35,654
Sweetie, I'm talking
to the rabbi.

1255
01:02:35,721 --> 01:02:38,657
Don't be rude.
But yes, we can go.

1256
01:02:38,724 --> 01:02:39,758
You wanna take these books back

1257
01:02:39,825 --> 01:02:43,762
and we'll get going soon,
don't worry.

1258
01:02:50,536 --> 01:02:51,437
Hey, Danielle.

1259
01:02:53,606 --> 01:02:55,240
Is this yours?

1260
01:02:59,646 --> 01:03:01,181
Um,

1261
01:03:01,247 --> 01:03:02,482
yeah.

1262
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:04,117
I found it in the bathroom.

1263
01:03:06,686 --> 01:03:08,856
Thanks, thank you.

1264
01:03:08,923 --> 01:03:10,323
Yeah.

1265
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:11,391
Can I borrow you for a second?

1266
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:17,230
She's really hungry and I
need an extra pair of hands.

1267
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:21,836
Can you hold her?

1268
01:03:24,372 --> 01:03:25,539
You really want me to?

1269
01:03:25,606 --> 01:03:26,474
I just need you to
hold her for a second,

1270
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,476
I've got some stuff in the bag.

1271
01:03:28,542 --> 01:03:30,846
And it'd be very helpful.

1272
01:03:30,912 --> 01:03:33,481
Um, I shouldn't, y'know?

1273
01:03:33,547 --> 01:03:34,415
Why?

1274
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,886
You're a babysitter, right?

1275
01:03:37,953 --> 01:03:40,321
Uh, we're gonna go in a sec.

1276
01:03:40,388 --> 01:03:41,756
Your parents are still here.

1277
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:43,892
You're leaving with them,
aren't you?

1278
01:03:43,959 --> 01:03:47,763
I really only work with
like eight year olds.

1279
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:50,298
Well it's not brain surgery.

1280
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:53,903
Just hold her.

1281
01:03:56,438 --> 01:03:57,339
Um.

1282
01:03:58,473 --> 01:03:59,876
It's fine, you'll be fine.

1283
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,496
- Let me, let me take her.
- It's okay.

1284
01:04:20,563 --> 01:04:21,264
Can you call a car?

1285
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:22,198
Yeah, I can do that.

1286
01:04:22,265 --> 01:04:23,067
Honestly, can you call a car?

1287
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:24,168
Yeah, but I can do both.

1288
01:04:24,233 --> 01:04:25,903
- I just need the...
- It's fine, she's fine.

1289
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:26,502
Just call the car first.

1290
01:04:26,569 --> 01:04:27,570
I can do both.

1291
01:04:27,637 --> 01:04:28,172
I'd like you
to call the car.

1292
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:31,474
She's a babysitter, remember?

1293
01:04:31,541 --> 01:04:32,977
- Yeah, I do remember.
- What is the matter with you?

1294
01:04:33,044 --> 01:04:33,577
Honestly.

1295
01:04:33,644 --> 01:04:34,278
Give her back!

1296
01:04:49,526 --> 01:04:50,895
That's 40 years of fasting.

1297
01:04:50,962 --> 01:04:52,296
That's more like 200.

1298
01:04:58,871 --> 01:05:00,405
No no no, you don't
have to worry about that.

1299
01:05:00,472 --> 01:05:02,273
Can we get a broom, please?

1300
01:05:03,641 --> 01:05:04,542
Danny.

1301
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:14,019
Sweetie.

1302
01:05:14,086 --> 01:05:15,353
Danielle, stop.

1303
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:19,390
I'm sorry.

1304
01:05:20,526 --> 01:05:22,028
What are you doing?

1305
01:05:23,096 --> 01:05:24,530
Danny, stop.

1306
01:05:24,597 --> 01:05:25,798
Come on.

1307
01:05:25,866 --> 01:05:26,967
What are you doing?

1308
01:05:28,801 --> 01:05:30,603
What's goin' on, sweetie?

1309
01:05:30,669 --> 01:05:32,838
Bubala, bubala, talk to me.

1310
01:05:33,606 --> 01:05:34,573
I can't.

1311
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,674
Talk to me, talk to me.

1312
01:05:35,741 --> 01:05:36,842
You can't what?

1313
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:38,711
I can't.

1314
01:05:38,778 --> 01:05:41,915
- I can't.
- You can't what, Danielle?

1315
01:05:41,982 --> 01:05:42,883
What?

1316
01:05:45,585 --> 01:05:47,420
What, honey?

1317
01:05:50,657 --> 01:05:51,893
I don't know.

1318
01:05:51,959 --> 01:05:53,895
Oh baby, you don't
need to know

1319
01:05:53,961 --> 01:05:55,129
what you're doing right now.

1320
01:05:55,196 --> 01:05:57,631
- No, I don't know.
- You don't need to know.

1321
01:05:57,697 --> 01:05:59,967
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1322
01:06:00,034 --> 01:06:02,502
Everything's gonna be fine.

1323
01:06:02,569 --> 01:06:04,939
You're gonna get a great job,

1324
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:09,912
you're gonna meet a great man,
you're gonna fall in love.

1325
01:06:10,846 --> 01:06:12,513
Just,
you're gonna figure it out.

1326
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,149
Listen, worst case scenario,

1327
01:06:14,216 --> 01:06:16,484
you can move back
in with Daddy and me.

1328
01:06:16,551 --> 01:06:17,585
No.

1329
01:06:26,727 --> 01:06:28,763
Everybody, looky-loos.

1330
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:29,865
Are you okay?

1331
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,635
Just too pushy, isn't she?

1332
01:06:34,636 --> 01:06:35,437
What is wrong with you?

1333
01:06:35,504 --> 01:06:37,006
Thank you, Maya.

1334
01:06:38,473 --> 01:06:39,474
You know what?

1335
01:06:40,776 --> 01:06:41,945
I'm gonna go get Daddy,

1336
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:44,613
have him bring the car
around for us, okay?

1337
01:06:46,015 --> 01:06:47,951
You just get outta here by going

1338
01:06:48,017 --> 01:06:49,953
and helping Mrs. Bronstein.

1339
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:51,753
Yeah, and I can help too.

1340
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:53,622
Thank you. Thank you, Maya.

1341
01:06:53,689 --> 01:06:55,993
All right, you wanna gonna go?

1342
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,962
Don't you worry
about anybody here.

1343
01:06:58,028 --> 01:07:00,730
They all love you.
It's a sad day, y'know?

1344
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:03,466
It's a sad day, lot of sadness.

1345
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:04,634
Everybody feels it.

1346
01:07:13,043 --> 01:07:15,478
Mrs. Bronstein,
which one is your car?

1347
01:07:15,545 --> 01:07:16,713
You'll see in a minute.

1348
01:07:23,121 --> 01:07:25,056
Can I ask you something?

1349
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:26,925
What?

1350
01:07:28,293 --> 01:07:29,928
Why do you do it?

1351
01:07:31,363 --> 01:07:33,497
- I'm not judging or anything.
- I mean, you clearly are.

1352
01:07:33,564 --> 01:07:35,599
No I'm not,
I just don't know anything

1353
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:36,734
- about it, so.
- I wanted money

1354
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,735
and it was easy.

1355
01:07:39,737 --> 01:07:40,638
Was it?

1356
01:07:41,572 --> 01:07:43,141
Yeah, sometimes.

1357
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:48,513
Felt nice to like have
power and be appreciated.

1358
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:52,550
If you could just put
those in the front seat, hm?

1359
01:07:55,888 --> 01:07:56,755
Thanks.

1360
01:08:00,725 --> 01:08:01,826
Do you need help?

1361
01:08:01,894 --> 01:08:04,063
Oh no, thanks girls.

1362
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:05,965
Do you want me
to pull out for you?

1363
01:08:06,032 --> 01:08:07,832
You drive a car?

1364
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,103
Yeah, I think
I'm a pretty good driver.

1365
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:12,571
Oh, thank you, no.

1366
01:08:13,706 --> 01:08:15,574
All right, be safe.

1367
01:08:18,879 --> 01:08:20,780
Wait, doesn't she
have an expired license?

1368
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:21,915
Yeah, they took it away.

1369
01:08:21,982 --> 01:08:24,784
She's not supposed to.

1370
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:25,718
Whatever.

1371
01:08:33,593 --> 01:08:34,929
Hey, I'm really sorry.

1372
01:08:34,996 --> 01:08:36,030
It's fine.

1373
01:08:38,665 --> 01:08:40,734
I just never thought
about it that way.

1374
01:08:41,936 --> 01:08:43,237
No, get in, Maureen.

1375
01:08:43,304 --> 01:08:44,604
Danielle.

1376
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,239
What?

1377
01:08:45,306 --> 01:08:46,441
You coming?

1378
01:08:46,506 --> 01:08:47,808
I'm literally
walking towards you, Dad.

1379
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:50,979
Sweetie, get over here
before somebody sees the car.

1380
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:52,080
Where were you?

1381
01:08:52,146 --> 01:08:53,414
I was looking all over.

1382
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:56,251
We were helping Mrs.
Bronstein to her car, Mom.

1383
01:08:56,318 --> 01:08:56,751
Why?

1384
01:08:56,818 --> 01:08:58,053
Why?

1385
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,321
Because you're supposed to
help fuckin' old people,

1386
01:08:59,388 --> 01:09:00,289
I don't know.

1387
01:09:00,356 --> 01:09:01,390
Don't you dare
use that language

1388
01:09:01,457 --> 01:09:02,590
or that tone with me,
young lady.

1389
01:09:02,657 --> 01:09:05,194
Katherine, Maya,
you guys need a ride?

1390
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:07,229
No, that's okay.
We'll get a car.

1391
01:09:07,296 --> 01:09:09,231
- Oh good.
- Come on, we got an open van.

1392
01:09:09,298 --> 01:09:12,034
It's fine, Mom, they
live two seconds from us.

1393
01:09:16,171 --> 01:09:19,074
Make sure you
get one with a car seat.

1394
01:09:20,176 --> 01:09:21,777
No,
it's finding nearby drivers.

1395
01:09:21,844 --> 01:09:23,779
Of course, Jesus Christ.

1396
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:27,250
Hey, aren't we
giving you two a lift?

1397
01:09:27,317 --> 01:09:28,151
Uh, three.

1398
01:09:29,019 --> 01:09:30,353
- No.
- Oh no, it's.

1399
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:31,787
No, it's okay, we're getting
a car, so. But thank you.

1400
01:09:31,855 --> 01:09:35,959
Come on, I got the Uber
that's Uber-all-this, let's go.

1401
01:09:36,026 --> 01:09:38,294
Joel, they got a car.

1402
01:09:38,361 --> 01:09:39,595
We got Maureen.

1403
01:09:39,661 --> 01:09:40,363
And he's right around
the corner, he's at...

1404
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:41,464
My phone just died.

1405
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:44,268
Okay. We'll use my phone.

1406
01:09:44,335 --> 01:09:45,735
- Well, where is it?
- Just look, it's somewhere in here.

1407
01:09:45,802 --> 01:09:48,372
- Okay, that's very specific.
- It's somewhere in there.

1408
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:52,609
Honestly, you guys have so
many people between all of you

1409
01:09:52,675 --> 01:09:55,246
and we would have to strap her
in and all of those things.

1410
01:09:55,312 --> 01:09:57,281
When we were all her
age, there was no straps,

1411
01:09:57,348 --> 01:09:59,383
there was no carriers.
Everybody all survived.

1412
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:00,717
Come with us.

1413
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:04,155
Oh, for the love God.
I'm getting in the car.

1414
01:10:04,989 --> 01:10:08,326
Sure.

1415
01:10:08,393 --> 01:10:10,028
Are you fucking kidding me?

1416
01:10:10,095 --> 01:10:12,663
Youngest in first. You
guys to the backy back.

1417
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:13,697
- Seriously?
- Come on.

1418
01:10:13,764 --> 01:10:14,665
Okay.

1419
01:10:17,302 --> 01:10:20,372
Wait, sorry, you gotta lift
up the middle seat. I forgot.

1420
01:10:20,439 --> 01:10:21,306
All right.

1421
01:10:22,507 --> 01:10:23,641
You have to pull the lever.

1422
01:10:23,707 --> 01:10:24,876
I'm literally
pulling the lever.

1423
01:10:24,943 --> 01:10:27,578
- Do you want me to do it?
- No, I got it.

1424
01:10:27,645 --> 01:10:30,982
Come on, Maya, you
gotta use some muscle, y'know?

1425
01:10:31,049 --> 01:10:32,584
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1426
01:10:33,352 --> 01:10:35,821
Okay, who's next?
Kim, Max?

1427
01:10:36,855 --> 01:10:38,291
- You go first.
- Okay.

1428
01:10:40,725 --> 01:10:42,028
Terrific.

1429
01:10:42,095 --> 01:10:44,931
Katherine, you think you can
fit in on that same seat?

1430
01:10:44,997 --> 01:10:45,831
Here we are.

1431
01:10:45,898 --> 01:10:46,999
Thank you.

1432
01:10:47,066 --> 01:10:48,301
Scoot over.

1433
01:10:48,367 --> 01:10:51,404
Okay, last one is Maureen.

1434
01:10:53,005 --> 01:10:54,207
Oh no.

1435
01:10:54,273 --> 01:10:55,808
Shit, I think I might
have overbooked us.

1436
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:56,877
No shit.

1437
01:10:56,944 --> 01:10:58,145
Seriously,
we can honestly get out.

1438
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:58,912
Yeah, we can just get a
car. It's not a big deal.

1439
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:01,115
No no no no, listen.

1440
01:11:01,181 --> 01:11:02,282
Maureen, you get there
in the backy back.

1441
01:11:02,349 --> 01:11:04,817
And then Maya and Danielle,

1442
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:06,420
can you guys squeeze
together into one seat?

1443
01:11:06,487 --> 01:11:08,055
I mean,
you're pretty small, right?

1444
01:11:08,122 --> 01:11:10,124
Really, Joel,
we could take a car.

1445
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:12,392
No no no, this is
gonna work. Believe me.

1446
01:11:12,459 --> 01:11:15,362
I promise you no man left
behind, or woman, sorry.

1447
01:11:15,429 --> 01:11:17,464
You okay back there, Maureen?

1448
01:11:18,731 --> 01:11:20,869
You got a lot of
stuff back here, Joel.

1449
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:22,570
Hi, girls.

1450
01:11:22,636 --> 01:11:23,872
- Hey.
- Hi.

1451
01:11:23,938 --> 01:11:25,974
Got your legs around?
Everybody hands safe?

1452
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,976
- I know, I know.
- All in.

1453
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,315
Off like a herd of turtles.

1454
01:11:34,382 --> 01:11:35,984
- What the?
- No, it's okay.

1455
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:37,085
It's okay.

1456
01:11:37,152 --> 01:11:38,887
All right.

1457
01:11:44,126 --> 01:11:45,727
Hi, baby.

1458
01:11:45,793 --> 01:11:49,999
You wanna play
peek a book? Peek a boo.

1459
01:11:50,065 --> 01:11:50,966
Don't cry.

1460
01:11:52,001 --> 01:11:54,769
All set? Seatbelts on?

1461
01:11:55,837 --> 01:11:58,874
All right, first stop
will be Maureen.

1462
01:11:58,941 --> 01:12:00,309
Oh, thank you.

1463
01:12:01,477 --> 01:12:03,012
Oh shit.

1464
01:12:03,078 --> 01:12:03,979
Oh no.

1465
01:12:06,814 --> 01:12:08,817
You don't
have your phone, again?

1466
01:12:09,586 --> 01:12:10,719
I got it.

1467
01:12:12,189 --> 01:12:14,090
What? Let's go, let's go Joel.

1468
01:12:14,157 --> 01:12:17,826
Yes,
just finding my keys.

1469
01:12:19,095 --> 01:12:21,797
Here we are, okay.

1470
01:12:21,865 --> 01:12:22,966
Everyone ready?

1471
01:12:27,836 --> 01:12:31,241
I'm gonna kill you
when we get home.

1472
01:12:50,855 --> 01:12:55,855
