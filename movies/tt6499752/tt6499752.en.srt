I love you.

00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:24,131
You can't be an
idealist and a capitalist, Asha.

12
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,966
- You got to pick a side.
- I think I can.

13
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:27,502
No, you can't.
I'm... I'm telling you...

19
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:41,548
I'm fine.

20
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,984
My husband scared me.

21
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:52,557
You do realize that you're
talking to a car, right?

22
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:55,091
I hear you talking
to yours all the time.

23
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:56,360
At least, mine can talk back.

24
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:57,428
Hmm.

25
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,331

Oh, thanks, Kara.

32
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:18,514
Order them.

33
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:22,048
Actually,
I was working very hard today.

34
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,184
In fact, that right there
is the celebratory beer.

35
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:27,286
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

36
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:29,054
I dropped the block
in the Firebird today,

37
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:30,323
finished her up.
You wanna see?

38
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:33,224
I have no idea
what you just said.

39
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:35,193
Okay. Well, I don't know
what you do

40
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:37,396
for a living either, wife,
so we're even.

41
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:40,063
Yes, but is staying home all day

42
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:42,467
playing with cars
a living, Grey?

43
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:44,268
I don't know. Dunno.

44
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,537
Ow.

45
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:47,069
That hurt.

46
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:48,072
It hurt good.

47
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:51,274
- Yeah.
- You know what?

48
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:53,075
I'm actually getting
kind of used to you

49
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:55,043
wearing the pants
in this household.

50
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,547
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm really settling in.

51
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:59,315
Stop it.

52
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:01,617
Well, you know, I'm never
giving them back, so...

53
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:03,217
I bet you 10 bucks
I can get 'em off.

54
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,285
No.

55
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:05,422
Stop.

56
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:09,122
You want to print a pizza?

57
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:11,392
You wanna make a pizza?

58
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,059
Seems like a lot of work.

59
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:14,294
Oh. I got to drop the car off

60
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:15,496
to this guy tonight,
it's all done.

61
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:18,197
Oh. Boo.
Okay. Well, have fun.

62
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,098
What do you mean have fun?
You're coming with me.

63
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,568
- What?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,503
I need you to drive me home
in that toy car of yours.

65
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:24,604
It's, like, 45 minutes away.

66
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:26,037
I'll push a button and end up

67
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,238
in Canada or something.

68
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,374
Well, I have work to do,
so I can't.

69
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:31,477
Can't lives
on Won't Street, lady.

70
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,344
You're coming with me.
And believe me,

71
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:36,246
you're gonna wanna see
this guy's house.

72
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:37,282
Trust me.

73
00:06:29,862 --> 00:06:33,295
So, what, he lives
behind the rocks?

74
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:35,065
No. Just you wait.

75
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:40,570
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

76
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:41,573
Really.

77
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:56,450
After you.

78
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:57,654
What?

79
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,194
This is amazing.

80
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:14,133
Eron, my man.

81
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,338
I got the Firebird upstairs
ready to go.

82
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,573
- You're early.
- Yeah. I...

83
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,341
I drive fast.

84
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,275
What... what is... what is the
thing that you're touching?

85
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:29,480
It's my cloud.

86
00:07:33,215 --> 00:07:35,483
Eron, I'd like you to meet

87
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:37,321
my wife, Asha.

88
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:41,222
Hi. Nice to meet you.

89
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:45,759
Hi. Yes.

90
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:47,260
Hello.

91
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:48,429
Hi.

92
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:49,463
Wait.

93
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:51,464
You're Eron Keen.

94
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:54,667
You own Vessel Computers.
Oh, my God.

95
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:56,502
Husband did not tell me
who I was meeting.

96
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:58,537
I... I really love your company.

97
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:00,639
You do
the most incredible things.

98
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:03,609
I'm in the industry too.
I work for Cobolt.

99
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:05,611
We specialize in robotic limbs

100
00:08:05,613 --> 00:08:06,944
for wounded soldiers.

101
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,512
I mean, we're nothing
like Vessel yet,

102
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:09,616
but we're getting there.

103
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,284
No, you're not.

104
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:18,255
I'll show you why.

105
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,392
Follow me.

106
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,761
I would like to introduce
you to my present

107
00:08:25,763 --> 00:08:28,396
and the rest
of the world's future.

108
00:08:28,398 --> 00:08:30,132
I call it Stem.

109
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:33,401
Wow.

110
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:36,202
That is the most incredible
little roach.

111
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:37,304
What does it do?

112
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:38,672
Literally anything.

113
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:40,507
Hmm.

114
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:42,709
It can drive anything,
talk to anything,

115
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:45,544
calculate anything.

116
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,682
It's a new, better brain.

117
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:52,684
Can it make babies
and play football?

118
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:55,252
It can do things
that will benefit society.

119
00:08:55,254 --> 00:08:56,521
Okay. You know what he means.

120
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:58,287
I'm just saying,
there's some things

121
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:00,289
that people do better.
I mean, you look at that widget

122
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,725
and you see the future.
I look at that thing,

123
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,663
I see 10 guys
on an unemployment line.

124
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,301
You should try not
to argue with that guy.

125
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,470
He's your last paying customer.

126
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,439
<i>Please do not touch
the steering wheel</i>

127

<i>while the car is in motion.</i>

128
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,511
Okay. So what's a guy
like me supposed to do

129
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:26,683
when his widget starts
taking over the world, hmm?

130
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:29,817
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

131
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,218
Come here.

132
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,460
You know,
there are some benefits

133
00:09:41,462 --> 00:09:43,662
not having to keep
your eyes on the road.

134
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:44,797
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

135
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,467
What should I
keep my eyes on?

136
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:55,037
<i>Please put
your seatbelts on.</i>

137
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,507
- No fun.
- Hmm.

138
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:00,344
<i>Leaving 601 freeway.</i>

139
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:26,499
Hey, honey, where...
where are we?

140
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,467
She's probably just taking us
around the traffic.

141
00:10:28,469 --> 00:10:29,868
No, no, no.

142
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,869
Wait. I'm sorry.
This is... no.

143
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:33,505
This is my old neighborhood.

144
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,372
This is where I grew up.
Yeah, this is New Crown.

145
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:37,074
We're... I mean, we're going
in the exact opposite

146
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:38,776
- direction of the house.
- Kara, take us home.

147
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:41,481
<i>I'm sorry.
There has been an error.</i>

148
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:44,782
Return to the freeway,
destination home.

149
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:47,417
<i>I'm sorry.
There has been an error.</i>

150
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:49,519
- What?
- Stop, car.

151
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:50,655
Car, stop.

152
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:54,558
Press the brake twice.

153

00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:04,734
- Stop.
- Let me try this.

156
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:08,101
We're going a little too fast.

157
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:09,805
This is not supposed to be...

158
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,309

00:12:12,393 --> 00:12:13,594
Wait.

166
00:12:14,728 --> 00:12:15,728
Who are you guys?

167
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:19,963
Wait.

168
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:21,666
Back up. Back up.

169
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:23,435
Stay right there, partner.

170
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,469
We're on TV, assholes.

171
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:27,506
Hurry.

172
00:12:36,681 --> 00:12:39,480
Hey, what are you doing?
Put your mask back on.

173
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:41,982
Look, you guys,
you can have my wallet,

174
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:43,518
take our cards, okay?

175
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,952
You can have it all.

176
00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:46,987
Thanks for your permission.

177
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:48,957
Don't you fucking
touch her.

178
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:52,892
You look at me and see
a real piece of shit

179
00:12:52,894 --> 00:12:56,027
on your shoe, don't you?

180
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:58,664
A learned woman like yourself

181
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:04,438
looking down on an
uneducated insect like me.

182
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:07,938
No!

183
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,006
No!

184
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,709
No!

185
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:13,910
There's four hostiles,
two prone.

186
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:18,013
Asha!

187
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,517
Asha!

188
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:29,857
Till death do us part.

189
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:38,665
Asha, I can't get to you.

190
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,000
I can't move.

191
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:43,670
Asha, stay with me, okay?

192
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:45,406
Look at me, honey.

193
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,840
Okay. I'm right here.

194
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:50,778
I'm right here, okay, Asha?

195
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:57,517
I'm right here. Okay?

196
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:00,951
No. No. Asha.

197
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,021
Asha, no. Pl...

198
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,638
Getting around,
you're gonna need this,

199
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,974
they're all throughout
the house.

200
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:48,111
I mean, everything that's
installed just allows you

201
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,616
to live a more normal life.

202
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,917
Oh, these robotic arms
are fully capable

203
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,953
of preparing meals for you.

204
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:01,889
Let's say you wanted
a protein shake,

205
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:04,527
you would just say,
"Protein shake."

206
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:11,830
Your mother also has voice
control authority

207
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:13,132
over the arms.

208
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:14,933
Would you like to do
the honors, ma'am?

209
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:18,103
Heh. Sure.

210
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:20,071
Protein shake.

211
00:16:20,073 --> 00:16:23,009
Oh, my Lord. Ha, ha.

212
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:35,821
Oh, heh...

213
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:38,056
There you go.

214
00:16:41,192 --> 00:16:42,924
I think we'll be fine
from here.

215
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,760
- Okay.
- I'll walk you out.

216
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:45,929
Oh, thank you.

217
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,974
<i>Charging now complete.</i>

218
00:17:16,722 --> 00:17:17,922
<i>Are you there, Grey?</i>

219
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:20,123
<i>Would you like something?</i>

220
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,859
<i>May I ask if Asha
will be joining us</i>

221
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:24,596
<i>for dinner?</i>

222
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:45,746
You know,
you don't have to stay here

223
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:47,781
day and night, Mom.

224
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:50,015
You know, these machines
they installed

225
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:53,886
pretty much do
everything for me.

226
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:55,089
I know.

227
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:07,097
Now, it's okay.

228
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:08,265
It's okay.

229
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,102
That's it. That's it. That's it.

230
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,817
Detective Cortez.

231
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:08,951
Hi, Pam.

232
00:19:08,953 --> 00:19:10,054
Hi, Grey.

233
00:19:15,825 --> 00:19:16,891
All right. This is me.

234
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:18,126
Here. You can have a seat here.

235
00:19:18,128 --> 00:19:19,162
Thanks.

236
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:27,234
You know, I'm from New Crown,
Grey, like you.

237
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:29,235
Went to Hellier High.

238
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:30,238
So what do you have?

239
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,106
Okay.

240
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:35,775
I know you were anxious
to come down here

241
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:37,108
and see how
we're getting things done,

242
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,311
and I think that's great.

243
00:19:38,313 --> 00:19:39,978
I'm a face-to-face
person myself.

244
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,279
You know,
I don't pilot these drones.

245
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,947
I like to get my hands dirty.

246
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,017
- Bang on doors.
- So who are these guys?

247
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,021
We don't know yet.

248
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,256
I do have a list of people
of interest in that area.

249
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,326
And just this week,
I brought in two people

250
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,126
- for questioning.
- So what you're saying

251
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:59,261
is you have all these things
flying above our heads,

252
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:00,996
they can read the ID chips
in our fillings,

253
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,864
but they don't actually
do anything?

254
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:05,234
No. I... I mean, yes, they work,

255
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:06,867
but it's not that simple.

256
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:09,036
Criminals can find ways
around them.

257
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:10,405
If they can find
the right people,

258
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:12,273
criminals can get a firewall
built around them

259
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:14,841
that prevents our drones
from identifying their faces.

260
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:17,411
Believe me, I understand
your frustration, I do.

261
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:19,212
I know I can't tie
my shoes anymore, Detective,

262
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:20,414
but you don't have
to talk to me

263
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,315
like I'm a goddamn
three-year-old.

264
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:24,183
Grey, she's just trying
to help.

265
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:25,385
I'm going to work
through my list,

266
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:27,420
and if you want to work with me,

267
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:30,021
we're gonna find them.

268
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:32,793
How can I work with you?
I can't even stand.

269
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,767
Administer p.m. medicine.

270
00:20:58,014 --> 00:20:59,046
Problem.

271
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:01,250
Administer p.m. medicine.

272
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:10,393
Again.
Administer p.m. medicine.

273
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,828
Problem. Again.

274
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:17,363
Again.

275
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:18,930
<i>I cannot administer</i>

276
00:21:18,932 --> 00:21:20,299
<i>any more medication, Grey.</i>

277
00:21:20,302 --> 00:21:22,066
No. You... you didn't do it
right.

278
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:24,235
You didn't do...
you didn't do it right.

279
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:26,971
Administer p.m. medicine.

280
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:29,308
<i>Another dosage
could be fatal.</i>

281
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,975
<i>I will contact an ambulance
to transport you</i>

282
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:34,945
<i>to a hospital
if you are in serious pain.</i>

283
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:07,309
Not gonna give you
bird flu, kid.

284
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:11,978
I don't leave my house
very often.

285
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:19,319
Must be frustrating for you.

286
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:25,123
You're someone who liked to get
things done with their hands.

287
00:22:26,991 --> 00:22:28,193
Now you can't.

288
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:34,464
I'm sorry.
Was that inappropriate?

289
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:37,400
I'm not around enough people
to know the difference.

290
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:38,501
Okay. Here's the difference.

291
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:40,337
What the fuck do you want, Eron?

292
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,341
Grey...

293
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:50,009
What if I told you
I could offer you something

294
00:22:50,011 --> 00:22:53,447
that would enable you
to walk again?

295
00:22:53,449 --> 00:22:55,415
That computer chip
that I showed you,

296
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,418
it has the potential to change

297
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,951
everything for people

298
00:22:59,953 --> 00:23:03,054
in your condition.

299
00:23:03,056 --> 00:23:06,157
As a quadriplegic,
the line connecting your brain

300
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,160
to your limbs has been cut,

301
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,499
Stem would bridge that gap.

302
00:23:15,032 --> 00:23:17,334
The operation would take
place in my home,

303
00:23:17,336 --> 00:23:20,437
away from official eyes.

304
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:23,440
There'd be no more
hospitals,

305
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:27,309
but it would have to be
our secret...

306
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:28,911
for now.

307
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,282
Here's the thing, kid.

308
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,321
I'm not looking to restart
my life.

309
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:43,426
I'm looking
for the off switch.

310
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,301
You know...

311
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:57,170
you were right about them.

312
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,472
Computers,

313
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:02,542
there are things
that they can't do.

314
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,242
They can't bring her back, Grey,

315
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,980
but they just might be able
to bring you back.

316
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:20,357
What would she want?

317
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:40,525
<i>This is a world first.</i>

318
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:43,159
<i>Never before
has a biomechanical fusion</i>

319
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:45,162
<i>been asked to do so much.</i>

320
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:50,199
<i>It's going to feel strange
initially.</i>

321
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:52,167
<i>The neural pathways
in your brain</i>

322
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:54,168
<i>will be trying
to have a conversation</i>

323
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,639
<i>with a foreign body,</i>

324
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:58,309
<i>trying to learn to pass
the baton.</i>

325
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:04,314
<i>The key is to let it grow
into itself.</i>

326
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:17,157
Grey, can you hear me?

327
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:27,434
Can you feel it when I do this?

328
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:38,576
My guess is this is gonna be
a piecemeal process.

329
00:26:38,578 --> 00:26:42,380
You shouldn't be expecting
unreasonable results so soon.

330
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,389
Oh, my God.

331
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:12,440
Now, try to stand.

332
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:47,802
<i>Nobody can know.</i>

333
00:27:47,804 --> 00:27:50,537
They make people like me
wait years

334
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:52,675
to test something like this.

335
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:57,242
But I can't wait for them.

336
00:27:57,244 --> 00:28:00,278
Signing confidentiality
agreements is never fun,

337
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,213
but I bet it will feel good
to do it

338
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:03,548
with your own hand.

339
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,584
Who's moving my arms
and my legs,

340
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:06,685
me or your widget?

341
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,687
You're the one doing it all.

342
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:09,689
You're not a robot.

343
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:14,224
Stem works in service
of your brain.

344
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,793
Your brain gives Stem
a command,

345
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:16,993
he makes it happen.

346
00:28:40,808 --> 00:28:42,207
Close door.

347
00:28:53,617 --> 00:28:55,316
<i>Good evening, Grey.</i>

348
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:57,652
<i>Another package
from Detective Cortez</i>

349
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:59,487
<i>has been delivered.
Would you like...</i>

350
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:00,888
Shut up.

351
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,759
<i>Did you say,
"Shut down"?</i>

352
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:05,461
Yeah, I did. Shut down.

353
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:05,679
<i>May I point
something out?</i>

354
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,417
Hello?

355
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:14,419
<i>Yes?</i>

356
00:30:18,357 --> 00:30:19,758
Okay, who's saying that?

357
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,797
<i>I am Stem. The system
operating your body for you.</i>

358
00:30:25,697 --> 00:30:27,429
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

359
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:28,834
You fucking kidding me?

360
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:31,903
<i>No.</i>

361
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:35,670
I've gone insane.

362
00:30:35,672 --> 00:30:38,573
I'm fucking insane.

363
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,542
<i>Your psychological
report diagnosed you</i>

364
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:44,413
<i>with mild PTSD symptoms,
but you are not insane.</i>

365
00:30:46,415 --> 00:30:47,816
Wait, so... Okay,
you've been sitting there

366
00:30:47,818 --> 00:30:49,784
this whole time since
the operation?

367
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:51,918
<i>I have been observing
everything you've observed.</i>

368
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,754
Do you... do you have to talk?

369
00:30:53,756 --> 00:30:55,454
<i>If you don't want me to,
I will not.</i>

370
00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:57,357
Okay. Yeah, don't talk.

371
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:23,614
So I'm not insane?

372
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:34,421
You can talk again.

373
00:31:34,423 --> 00:31:36,658
<i>No, you are not insane.</i>

374
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:39,993
Wait, can anybody else hear you?

375
00:31:39,995 --> 00:31:42,461
<i>No, only you.</i>

376
00:31:42,463 --> 00:31:44,899
<i>I'm sending sound waves
to your eardrum.</i>

377
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:49,635
Can you read my mind?

378
00:31:49,637 --> 00:31:50,936
<i>No.</i>

379
00:31:50,938 --> 00:31:52,637
<i>I can only discern speech</i>

380
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:55,607
<i>when you talk out loud.</i>

381
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:57,541
<i>Now that you've allowed me
to talk again,</i>

382
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:59,811
<i>may I point something out?</i>

383
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:01,848
<i>In the drone
surveillance footage.</i>

384
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:08,386
<i>Can't you see it?</i>

385
00:32:14,691 --> 00:32:16,892
See what?

386
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:18,894
<i>The man who shot
your wife,</i>

387
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,929
<i>there's no gun in his hand.</i>

388
00:32:20,931 --> 00:32:22,731
She was shot,
that means he had a gun.

389
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,799
<i>She was shot,
but not with a gun</i>

390
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:26,801
<i>he was holding in his hand.</i>

391
00:32:26,803 --> 00:32:29,638
<i>A gun implanted inside
his hand.</i>

392
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,642
<i>Freeze the screen
at the moment he fires.</i>

393
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:41,079
<i>The man who took Asha's purse</i>

394
00:32:41,081 --> 00:32:43,248
<i>in the left of frame,</i>

395
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,652
<i>there is a marking
on his wrist.</i>

396
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:55,258
I don't see it.

397
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,559
<i>I do.</i>

398
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:58,094
<i>I've rebuilt the image.</i>

399
00:32:58,096 --> 00:33:00,732
<i>With your permission,
I can show you.</i>

400
00:33:03,702 --> 00:33:06,001
<i>Just relax and let me draw.</i>

401
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,638
This feels very weird.

402
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:20,047
<i>You now have
full control again, Grey.</i>

403
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:22,548
I've... I've seen these.

404
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,984
It's a... a military tattoo,
I think.

405
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:26,085
<i>I will read it.</i>

406
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,621
<i>Hold it in front of your eye.</i>

407
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:33,959
<i>Serk Brantner, Marine Corps,</i>

408
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:37,062
<i>098-422; O-Positive; Catholic;</i>

409
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:39,532
<i>address: 414 Citrus, New Crown.</i>

410
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:42,467
You just...

411
00:33:46,938 --> 00:33:48,640
You just found this guy?

412
00:33:53,078 --> 00:33:55,479
I got you, you sons of bitches.

413
00:33:59,882 --> 00:34:01,983
Call Detective Cortez.

414
00:34:01,985 --> 00:34:03,884
<i>Are you sure you want</i>

415
00:34:03,886 --> 00:34:06,787
- <i>to call Detective Cortez?</i>
- Yes. I am sure.

416
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:07,988
You just found the guy

417
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,757
who murdered my wife.

418
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:11,660
<i>Do you have evidence
to prove that?</i>

419
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:14,862
End call.

420
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,999
Well, you saw the tattoo.

421
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:22,602
<i>Eron has forbidden you
to tell anyone about me.</i>

422
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,939
Okay. Maybe I... I drew it
from memory.

423
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,707
<i>My reconstruction
of the tattoo</i>

424
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:31,675
<i>does not provide
any real evidence</i>

425
00:34:31,677 --> 00:34:34,644
<i>unless they can correlate it
exactly with the drone video,</i>

426
00:34:34,646 --> 00:34:37,114
- <i>which they can't.</i>
- What are you saying?

427
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,948
<i>You need to be positive
it's him</i>

428
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,685
<i>before you alert the police.</i>

429
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:46,556
Hey, man, he was the last one...

430
00:34:47,825 --> 00:34:48,985
Sure, they do, but then he...

431
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:08,741
Lock chair.

432
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:30,859
<i>There are no alarms inside,</i>

433
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:32,395
<i>but it is a manual lock.</i>

434
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,096
<i>I can't help you break it.</i>

435
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:35,631
Don't worry.

436
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,697
I got this.

437
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,685
<i>I suggest you remove
your shoes.</i>

438
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:27,644
<i>Grey, the table.</i>

439
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:31,946
What about it?

440
00:36:31,948 --> 00:36:33,683
<i>Say the word "on."</i>

441
00:36:35,184 --> 00:36:37,251
On.

442
00:36:37,253 --> 00:36:39,120
<i>Say "messages."</i>

443
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:40,122
Messages.

444
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:50,162
<i>The name "Old Bones"
keeps being mentioned.</i>

445
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:52,297
<i>I saw 38 references.
What is that?</i>

446
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:54,233
It's a bar
in my old neighborhood.

447
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:57,034
<i>I can find no online
address or phone number for it.</i>

448
00:36:57,036 --> 00:36:59,770
'Cause they don't go in
for that sort of thing.

449
00:36:59,772 --> 00:37:01,905
No, this is useless.

450
00:37:01,907 --> 00:37:02,908
Off.

451
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:43,909
<i>Hide behind the shelf.</i>

452
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:55,084
<i>Wait.</i>

453
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:56,087
<i>Wait.</i>

454
00:37:59,825 --> 00:38:01,324
<i>Now.</i>

455
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:03,160
<i>Now, while you have
the advantage.</i>

456
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:13,236
Come here!

457
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,038
You come here
to rip me off, huh?

458
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,941
Wait.

459
00:38:20,943 --> 00:38:22,008
It's you.

460
00:38:23,978 --> 00:38:26,946
I don't know how you found me,

461
00:38:26,948 --> 00:38:29,081
but you shouldn't be here.

462
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,983
- You killed my wife.
- No!

463
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:33,051
I didn't do that.
That was someone else.

464
00:38:33,053 --> 00:38:34,986
It doesn't matter!

465
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:40,090
<i>You'll need to be
a little faster than that.</i>

466
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,894
Why are you making me do this?

467
00:38:43,896 --> 00:38:46,396
<i>Let me know if you need
my help, Grey.</i>

468
00:38:46,398 --> 00:38:48,332
Stem, help.

469
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:50,967
<i>I need your permission
to operate independently.</i>

470
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:52,935
Permission granted.

471
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:55,805
<i>Thank you.</i>

472
00:39:04,146 --> 00:39:06,914
Um, okay.

473
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:09,583
Uh, Stem, what are we...
what are we doing, man?

474
00:39:09,585 --> 00:39:11,285
<i>Just relax.</i>

475
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:14,854
What the fuck?

476
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:19,258
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, God. Dear God.

477
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:24,196
Oh, look, man,
stay down, please.

478
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:26,298
Um, please don't get up.

479
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,999
Please don't get up.
Please...

480
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:30,868
Stay down, man.

481
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,136
Stem, he's got a knife!

482
00:39:32,138 --> 00:39:33,437
Stem!

483
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:34,839
<i>I can see that.</i>

484
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:36,606
<i>We have a knife, too.</i>

485
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,241
Oh.

486
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,875
You just stabbed him.

487
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,411
Are you trying to piss him off?

488
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:42,911
Okay. All right.

489
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,313
So, what's the plan?

490
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,115
What are we doing?

491
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,182
Stem! Stop him.

492
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,861
<i>You now have
full control again, Grey.</i>

493
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,310
<i>I advise that you remove
any traces</i>

494
00:40:18,312 --> 00:40:20,944
<i>of your presence here.</i>

495
00:40:20,946 --> 00:40:23,213
<i>That also means cleaning up
the vomit in the sink.</i>

496
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:26,115
Okay. Just give me...
give me a second, okay?

497
00:40:26,117 --> 00:40:28,184
<i>- One second has passed.</i>
- Look, I don't...

498
00:40:28,186 --> 00:40:31,087
I didn't mean a second,
I just mean hold on, okay?

499
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:32,288
I gotta think.
I can't let you do

500
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,891
the thinking for me right now.

501
00:40:41,998 --> 00:40:43,964
I just...

502
00:40:43,966 --> 00:40:45,268
I just killed somebody.

503
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:56,010
So, uh...

504
00:40:59,447 --> 00:41:01,447
What do you think...
What do you think I should do?

505
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:03,248
<i>I would suggest
that you rid the house</i>

506
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,683
<i>of all your fingerprints.</i>

507
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:06,250
I... are you kidding me?
I can't remember

508
00:41:06,252 --> 00:41:08,052
every single thing
that I touched here...

509
00:41:08,054 --> 00:41:09,387
<i>I have a record
of every single thing</i>

510
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:10,856
<i>you touched.</i>

511
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:23,332
So, the body that came in

512
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:24,999
from New Crown yesterday,

513
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:27,235
Serk Brantner?

514
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:28,471
I wanna show you what I found

515
00:41:28,473 --> 00:41:29,473
when I opened him up.

516
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,976
When I examined the wound
in his throat,

517
00:41:35,978 --> 00:41:38,479
I found wiring embedded
in the tendons.

518
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:40,114
I'm thinking surgery.

519
00:41:40,116 --> 00:41:42,316
A medical implant attached
to the muscle.

520
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:45,418
I also found computer implants
all throughout his chest.

521
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,421
I've never seen them
to this extent before.

522
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,724
- And then there's this.
- What is it?

523
00:41:50,726 --> 00:41:52,491
Appears to be some sort
of weapon implant

524
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:54,226
embedded within the muscle,

525
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:56,026
an actual functioning gun,

526
00:41:56,028 --> 00:41:58,362
with a bullet-loading mechanism

527
00:41:58,364 --> 00:42:01,999
built into the tissue
with biomechanics.

528
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:03,967
What about the boot print
we scraped

529
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:05,070
from the front porch?

530
00:42:08,273 --> 00:42:10,108
Engine grease, mostly.

531
00:42:11,343 --> 00:42:13,976
Old-fashioned engine grease.

532
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:21,215
So how am I progressing?

533
00:42:21,217 --> 00:42:24,118
I can track you, Grey.

534
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,521
- Huh?
- I can track you.

535
00:42:26,523 --> 00:42:28,422
Wait. Am I supposed
to know what that means

536
00:42:28,424 --> 00:42:30,123
or is that
one of your brain tests?

537
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:31,759
It means you have a piece
of my property

538
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:33,160
inside of you.

539
00:42:33,162 --> 00:42:35,194
A very expensive piece
of property.

540
00:42:35,196 --> 00:42:37,365
Serk Brantner,
homicide suspect list.

541
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,200
Did you really think

542
00:42:41,202 --> 00:42:43,168
I would let that property
out of my sight

543
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,402
for even one second?

544
00:42:50,544 --> 00:42:52,778
Did you forget
that this operation

545
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,511
was to be done in secret?

546
00:42:54,513 --> 00:42:56,213
That if even the slightest thing

547
00:42:56,215 --> 00:42:58,181
were to go wrong
during this trial period,

548
00:42:58,183 --> 00:42:59,784
it would all be for nothing?

549
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,551
<i>He knows everything.
Don't lie to him.</i>

550
00:43:01,553 --> 00:43:04,287
Search drone footage archives.

551
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:06,622
Alley behind 414 Citrus Avenue,
New Crown,

552
00:43:06,624 --> 00:43:08,325
October 14th, 3:00 p.m.

553
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:13,127
<i>No, I didn't forget it.</i>

554
00:43:13,129 --> 00:43:16,497
I remembered that you asked me
to keep a secret.

555
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:19,065
But it turns out

556
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:20,601
that you had a couple
other secrets,

557
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:22,602
like, for instance,

558
00:43:22,604 --> 00:43:25,605
you never mentioned to me...

559
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:28,106
that the thing talks!

560
00:43:35,248 --> 00:43:37,482
Stem...

561
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:39,450
- talks to you?
- Yeah. It's got a mind

562
00:43:39,452 --> 00:43:41,820
of its own.
I can hear its voice

563
00:43:41,822 --> 00:43:43,454
in my head.

564
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,366
<i>From now on,</i>

565
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:00,502
<i>you will be a model patient.</i>

566
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:02,670
You will let the computer do

567
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:05,540
what it was supposed to do,

568
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,541
not confuse it

569
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:10,177
with some extracurricular
detective work.

570
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:12,078
Enter suspect named Grey Trace.

571
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,550
202 Parva Avenue, Leland Park.

572
00:44:18,186 --> 00:44:19,385
<i>Did it occur to you</i>

573
00:44:19,387 --> 00:44:21,419
that if you were to, say,

574
00:44:21,421 --> 00:44:24,155
commit murder,

575
00:44:24,157 --> 00:44:26,391
the authorities
could find out about Stem

576
00:44:26,393 --> 00:44:28,158
and remove him from your body,

577
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,197
putting you back
in a wheelchair for life?

578
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,112
I'm actually off-duty
right now.

579
00:44:51,114 --> 00:44:52,581
I just stopped by
to check up on you.

580
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:55,316
And because I'm in the market
for a new car.

581
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,385
I knew you fixed these things up
and sold them

582
00:44:57,387 --> 00:44:59,654
to people like Eron Keen.

583
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:01,555
Now, he makes
a little more money than I do,

584
00:45:01,557 --> 00:45:03,590
but I was wondering

585
00:45:03,592 --> 00:45:05,258
if you'd be willing to sell

586
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,226
to one of the little people.

587
00:45:07,228 --> 00:45:09,461
Well, what makes you think

588
00:45:09,463 --> 00:45:11,664
that I don't need
my car anymore?

589
00:45:16,603 --> 00:45:18,436
<i>She just checked
the sole of your boots.</i>

590
00:45:18,438 --> 00:45:20,338
- <i>You left a print.</i>
- Well, I hate to break it

591
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,540
to you, but it's not for sale.

592
00:45:23,542 --> 00:45:25,175
Sorry.

593
00:45:25,177 --> 00:45:26,211
Okay.

594
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:30,346
Listen, when I said I didn't
have any news earlier,

595
00:45:30,348 --> 00:45:32,181
I kind of lied.

596
00:45:32,183 --> 00:45:33,482
There was this guy we brought in

597
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:35,518
for questioning about
Asha's murder,

598
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,452
a man with
a long criminal record

599
00:45:37,454 --> 00:45:39,287
who lived in the area.

600
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:41,356
He didn't pan out, but...

601
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:43,726
yesterday he was murdered.

602
00:45:43,728 --> 00:45:45,426
Really?

603
00:45:45,428 --> 00:45:47,762
Yeah. Did you hear
anything about that?

604
00:45:47,764 --> 00:45:49,697
<i>Don't look away.</i>

605
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:51,532
<i>You're showing her
you're lying.</i>

606
00:45:51,534 --> 00:45:53,702
No.

607
00:45:53,704 --> 00:45:56,603
But you were in New Crown
yesterday.

608
00:45:56,605 --> 00:45:58,504
I saw you on a drone camera,

609
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,405
right around the time
that it happened.

610
00:46:00,407 --> 00:46:02,474
<i>She's guessing.
You have no computer implants</i>

611
00:46:02,476 --> 00:46:04,476
<i>and I can't be identified
by a drone.</i>

612
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:07,278
Well I was in the area,
detective,

613
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,181
because, remember, you did say

614
00:46:10,183 --> 00:46:12,751
you wanted my help, so I was...

615
00:46:12,753 --> 00:46:14,353
I'm just trying to help.

616
00:46:15,723 --> 00:46:17,722
Right.

617
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:19,422
You're not seriously
suggesting

618
00:46:19,424 --> 00:46:20,690
that I had anything to do
with this,

619
00:46:20,692 --> 00:46:22,491
are you, detective?

620
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:23,592
I mean, because I got

621
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:25,294
a pretty solid alibi here,

622
00:46:25,296 --> 00:46:27,663
- if you haven't noticed.
- Obviously.

623
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:29,397
I'm not accusing you
of doing something

624
00:46:29,399 --> 00:46:31,599
you're incapable of doing.

625
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:33,668
It's just, uh,

626
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,771
strange that you were
at that location

627
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:37,272
at that time is all.

628
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,609
Yeah, well,

629
00:46:42,611 --> 00:46:45,211
I don't know what to tell you,
I mean, um,

630
00:46:45,213 --> 00:46:48,314
look you could stab me
in the leg if you wanna...

631
00:46:48,316 --> 00:46:51,316
if you wanna see
for yourself.

632
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:53,218
Maybe I will.

633
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:56,521
Just for fun.

634
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:04,561
Is that all, or...?

635
00:47:04,563 --> 00:47:05,631
Yeah.

636
00:47:07,298 --> 00:47:08,531
But call me if you, uh,

637
00:47:08,533 --> 00:47:10,734
change your mind about selling.

638
00:47:10,736 --> 00:47:12,001
I won't.

639
00:47:14,271 --> 00:47:15,708
Well, then I'll see myself out.

640
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:36,523
What should I do?
I wanna find these guys,

641
00:47:36,525 --> 00:47:38,658
but I don't wanna kill
anybody else, okay?

642
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,027
<i>The Old Bones would seem
the next logical place</i>

643
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:42,494
<i>to investigate,
but I can find</i>

644
00:47:42,496 --> 00:47:44,663
<i>no online information for it.</i>

645
00:47:44,665 --> 00:47:47,598
<i>You would have to go there
in person.</i>

646
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,601
<i>But if you do that,
Eron will track your movements</i>

647
00:47:50,603 --> 00:47:53,439
<i>and most likely attempt
to shut me down remotely.</i>

648
00:48:17,626 --> 00:48:20,594
<i>This place looks dangerous.</i>

649
00:48:20,596 --> 00:48:21,732
<i>We'll need a plan.</i>

650
00:48:31,505 --> 00:48:33,472
Whiskey, rocks, please.

651
00:48:33,474 --> 00:48:36,242
<i>This doesn't seem like
a well-thought-out plan.</i>

652
00:48:41,514 --> 00:48:44,482
Hey, would you do me a solid

653
00:48:44,484 --> 00:48:46,451
and hold that glass
where I can drink it?

654
00:48:50,422 --> 00:48:51,456
Thank you.

655
00:48:56,327 --> 00:48:58,360
<i>Alcohol impairs
the signals from your brain.</i>

656
00:48:58,362 --> 00:49:00,662
<i>You will not be able
to walk properly.</i>

657
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:02,330
I know.

658
00:49:02,332 --> 00:49:04,398
That's why
they can charge money for it.

659
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,734
<i>It does not make sense</i>

660
00:49:05,736 --> 00:49:07,502
<i>that humans deliberately
malfunction.</i>

661
00:49:07,504 --> 00:49:09,536
Yeah, that's because
your memories are filled

662
00:49:09,538 --> 00:49:11,605
with ones and zeros, pal,

663
00:49:11,607 --> 00:49:13,607
and our memories are filled

664
00:49:13,609 --> 00:49:16,310
with every fuck-up
we've ever made.

665
00:49:22,382 --> 00:49:24,618
Hi. Everybody?

666
00:49:26,353 --> 00:49:28,823
Excuse me, can I have
everybody's attention?

667
00:49:32,893 --> 00:49:35,592
I know that some scumbag
in here knows

668
00:49:35,594 --> 00:49:37,628
one of the guys
who murdered my wife,

669
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:39,731
his name's Serk Brantner.

670
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:43,132
So, if you know Serk
or if you know

671
00:49:43,134 --> 00:49:45,803
any information about
the killing of my wife,

672
00:49:45,805 --> 00:49:48,670
if you could you just raise
your hand and,

673
00:49:48,672 --> 00:49:50,607
you know,
stand up and come forward.

674
00:49:51,743 --> 00:49:52,908
Thank you.

675
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:10,725
So you knew Serk?

676
00:50:13,728 --> 00:50:15,160
Okay.

677
00:50:15,162 --> 00:50:16,729
Have it your way, cock snot.

678
00:50:16,731 --> 00:50:19,564
I'll call the police.

679
00:50:19,566 --> 00:50:21,006
Oh, you're gonna hit me, or...?

680
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,937
Son, if I were to hit you,

681
00:50:26,939 --> 00:50:29,606
you'd wake up in the past.

682
00:50:29,608 --> 00:50:31,440
Yeah, Serk said
something similar,

683
00:50:31,442 --> 00:50:33,344
right before I damn near cut
his head off.

684
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:51,759
Manny.

685
00:50:51,761 --> 00:50:52,926
Yeah?

686
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:54,764
Turn the music up for me.

687
00:50:56,865 --> 00:50:59,802
Oh, I don't have to go
to the bathroom, so...

688
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:21,484
Here we are.

689
00:51:21,486 --> 00:51:24,453
Making it real nice
and comfortable for you.

690
00:51:24,455 --> 00:51:26,825
<i>I'm temporarily blocking
your pain receptors.</i>

691
00:51:28,525 --> 00:51:29,726
You're right about Serk.

692
00:51:29,728 --> 00:51:31,894
Somebody ventilated him
the other day.

693
00:51:31,896 --> 00:51:33,862
I already told you, it was me.

694
00:51:35,932 --> 00:51:38,466
Man, we have got to find you

695
00:51:38,468 --> 00:51:39,936
an open mic somewhere.

696
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:42,869
Now, if that's true,

697
00:51:42,871 --> 00:51:45,005
and you're faking
this wheelchair shit,

698
00:51:45,007 --> 00:51:46,776
then you would feel this.

699
00:51:48,744 --> 00:51:50,744
Damn. You can't feel that?

700
00:51:50,746 --> 00:51:52,645
- Nope?
- Four guys were there

701
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:54,714
the night my wife was murdered.
Are you one of 'em?

702
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:57,949
Where's the point
when you start to feel things?

703
00:51:57,951 --> 00:51:59,951
What about...

704
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:03,687
here? Nope?

705
00:52:03,689 --> 00:52:05,023
I just need
to hear you say it.

706
00:52:05,025 --> 00:52:07,624
- Were you there?
- What about here?

707
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:10,660
Ah. Yeah.

708
00:52:10,662 --> 00:52:12,528
Now see that, my friend,

709
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,797
is the magic point.

710
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:15,832
Is that a gun implanted
in your arm, too?

711
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:17,567
Like your friend had?

712
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,971
I just need to hear you say it.

713
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,606
Were you there?

714
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:27,541
Yeah.

715
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:28,976
I was.

716
00:52:28,978 --> 00:52:31,011
Stem, you can take over.

717
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:33,981
Hi.

718
00:52:42,589 --> 00:52:44,824
Let me show you
how it's done.

719
00:52:44,826 --> 00:52:46,959
Oh, I didn't forget about you.

720
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:49,761
<i>Do not get
overconfident, Grey.</i>

721
00:52:49,763 --> 00:52:51,030
What's your name?

722
00:52:55,034 --> 00:52:57,802
Ow. Ow. Ooh.

723
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:09,078
Did you see that? Hmm?

724
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,146
So you thought I was an invalid,

725
00:53:11,148 --> 00:53:13,982
but you didn't know
that I'm a fucking ninja.

726
00:53:15,685 --> 00:53:17,085
<i>While I am
state-of-the-art, Grey,</i>

727
00:53:17,087 --> 00:53:18,119
<i>I am not a ninja.</i>

728
00:53:18,121 --> 00:53:20,988
What's your name?

729
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,024
Fuck you.

730
00:53:24,093 --> 00:53:26,727
Tell me where they are.

731
00:53:34,135 --> 00:53:36,335
Stem, what do I do?

732
00:53:36,337 --> 00:53:37,805
<i>Use the knife.</i>

733
00:54:02,926 --> 00:54:05,127
I, uh...

734
00:54:05,129 --> 00:54:07,128
I can't... I can't do it.

735
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:08,730
<i>I can do it for you.</i>

736
00:54:08,732 --> 00:54:10,998
<i>You don't even have to look.</i>

737
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,665
Okay. Do it.

738
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:14,000
You have my permission.

739
00:54:14,002 --> 00:54:15,935
Who you talking to?

740
00:54:15,937 --> 00:54:18,071
You're crazy.

741
00:54:18,073 --> 00:54:19,605
No.

742
00:54:22,643 --> 00:54:23,876
Eesh.

743
00:54:23,878 --> 00:54:25,610
You know,

744
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:27,612
my mama taught me never to pick
on disabled people.

745
00:54:27,614 --> 00:54:28,880
Heh. Yeah.

746
00:54:28,882 --> 00:54:30,214
Okay. Enough, Stem.

747
00:54:32,052 --> 00:54:36,087
Stem, enough!

748
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:38,624
<i>You now have
full control again, Grey.</i>

749
00:54:41,626 --> 00:54:43,760
Shit.

750
00:54:43,762 --> 00:54:46,128
What have you done?

751
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:48,866
<i>He will now answer
any question you ask him.</i>

752
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:54,737
Okay. Um...

753
00:54:54,739 --> 00:54:55,972
Hey, buddy.

754
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:01,709
What's your name?

755
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:03,812
Tolan.

756
00:55:03,814 --> 00:55:06,747
Listen to me,

757
00:55:06,749 --> 00:55:08,069
you gotta give me
something, okay?

758
00:55:09,819 --> 00:55:11,184
Tell me something.

759
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:12,954
You were...

760
00:55:13,987 --> 00:55:15,822
- a job.
- Job?

761
00:55:15,824 --> 00:55:18,090
What do... what do you mean, job?

762
00:55:18,092 --> 00:55:19,157
Girl.

763
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:20,794
Kill Asha?

764
00:55:23,196 --> 00:55:24,895
Why? Who wanted...

765
00:55:24,897 --> 00:55:26,864
Who wanted her dead?

766
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:29,102
Who... who paid you?

767
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:32,904
Fisk.

768
00:55:35,841 --> 00:55:37,207
Fisk? Who's Fisk? Is that...

769
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,141
Is that the person who paid you?

770
00:55:39,143 --> 00:55:40,144
Fisk?

771
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,746
Goddamn it!

772
00:55:44,748 --> 00:55:46,782
You've nearly killed him.

773
00:55:46,784 --> 00:55:47,951
<i>Look at this, Grey.</i>

774
00:55:51,854 --> 00:55:53,954
Cobolt.

775
00:55:53,956 --> 00:55:55,790
That's Asha's company.

776
00:55:55,792 --> 00:55:57,857
<i>Grey, I have to inform you
that Eron is attempting</i>

777
00:55:57,859 --> 00:55:59,126
- <i>to shut me down remotely...</i>
- Wait.

778
00:55:59,128 --> 00:56:00,860
- <i>right now.</i>
- Shut up.

779
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:02,294
<i>Do you understand
that you will become</i>

780
00:56:02,296 --> 00:56:04,163
<i>a quadriplegic again
when Eron shuts me down?</i>

781
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:05,764
<i>We need to employ a rootkit</i>

782
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:07,199
<i>and subvert
my operating system.</i>

783
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:09,768
What kind of fucking language
are you speaking?

784
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:11,202
<i>We need to find
a computer hacker</i>

785
00:56:11,204 --> 00:56:13,071
<i>who can counter Eron's code.</i>

786
00:56:13,073 --> 00:56:14,472
Okay. Let me look

787
00:56:14,474 --> 00:56:16,206
in my little black book
of hackers.

788
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:18,041
What do you want?

789
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:19,943
<i>I already searched
the darknet earlier today</i>

790
00:56:19,945 --> 00:56:22,179
<i>for this eventuality.
Go to an apartment building</i>

791
00:56:22,181 --> 00:56:24,481
<i>at 7th and Spring.
Apartment 514.</i>

792
00:56:24,483 --> 00:56:27,152
<i>Ask for Jamie.
You'll need to pay in cash.</i>

793
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,052
Apartment 514,
7th and Spring,

794
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,287
it's 10 minutes away.

795
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:34,055
<i>As soon as he shuts me down,</i>

796
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,856
<i>he will send a security team
from Vessel</i>

797
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:36,893
<i>to retrieve you.</i>

798
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:40,997
<i>You need to leave now.</i>

799
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,035
<i>Get the gun from the man
in the corner, hurry.</i>

800
00:56:49,237 --> 00:56:51,271
<i>Tolan has a pen
in his right pocket.</i>

801
00:56:51,273 --> 00:56:55,274
- <i>Take it.</i>
- Uh, why the pen?

802
00:56:55,276 --> 00:56:57,976
<i>You need to write down
everything I tell you.</i>

803
00:56:57,978 --> 00:56:59,278
Okay.

804
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:06,952
Oh, Tolan said drinks on him.

805
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:16,192
Um, I'm gonna need a phone.

806
00:57:16,194 --> 00:57:18,762
And a fucking mop.

<i>There is no time

Lock chair.

Keep an eye on her,

810
00:57:30,207 --> 00:57:31,308

00:58:07,938 --> 00:58:09,258
Okay. I can't... I can't keep up.

821
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:16,278
What's happening?

822
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,212
<i>I told you Eron

823
00:58:18,214 --> 00:58:20,081
- <i>You must hurry.</i>
- Okay. I would love to,

824
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,848
but our leg is not working.

825

<i>I am only operating
at 70% capacity.</i>

826
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,286
So much for state-of-the-art.

827

00:59:01,352 --> 00:59:02,820
Input what?

835
00:59:41,019 --> 00:59:43,019
Okay, let me look
at my little book of hackers!

836
00:59:43,021 --> 00:59:45,155
What do you want?
Apartment 514.

837
00:59:45,157 --> 00:59:48,223
Seventh and Spring,
it's 10 minutes away.

838
00:59:48,225 --> 00:59:50,127
He's at Seventh and Spring.

839
00:59:57,367 --> 00:59:58,867
Goodbye, soldier.

840
01:00:01,036 --> 01:00:02,304
You didn't deserve this.

841
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,076
<i>Turn left, Grey.</i>

842
01:00:10,446 --> 01:00:13,446
<i>Deploy a rootkit...</i>

843
01:00:13,448 --> 01:00:14,848
System.

844
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:18,185
<i>Grey.</i>

845
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,913
Is Jamie there?

846
01:00:57,152 --> 01:00:59,552
I have money.

847
01:00:59,554 --> 01:01:01,120
Shit, shit.

848
01:01:12,399 --> 01:01:14,267
What I don't have is time.

849
01:01:17,337 --> 01:01:18,435
Paper money.

850
01:01:18,437 --> 01:01:20,272
How old school.

851
01:01:23,075 --> 01:01:24,441
They really do write God on it.

852
01:01:24,443 --> 01:01:26,041
Uh, yeah, I guess they do.

853
01:01:26,043 --> 01:01:28,310
Um, look, can you hack
a computer for me?

854
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:30,045
- Which one?
- Uh, the one in my neck.

855
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,322
I'm a little confused.

856
01:01:41,123 --> 01:01:43,123
You just decided to stand by

857
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:46,493
while our friend
was tortured to death.

858
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:48,194
Hey.

859
01:01:48,196 --> 01:01:50,530
I'm not here to babysit you

860
01:01:50,532 --> 01:01:53,199
or your... your buddies.

861
01:01:53,201 --> 01:01:55,033
Serving people like us

862
01:01:55,035 --> 01:01:56,334
should be the highest honor

863
01:01:56,336 --> 01:01:59,006
of your meaningless life, Manny.

864
01:02:02,309 --> 01:02:03,608
Listen, Fisk.

865
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:06,277
Just leave.

866
01:02:06,279 --> 01:02:09,112
I'll clean up your goddamn mess.

867
01:02:09,114 --> 01:02:10,383
You'll get one shot.

868
01:02:14,352 --> 01:02:16,486
It's okay, my friend.

869
01:02:16,488 --> 01:02:18,490
You don't have to take
any more bullets for me.

870
01:02:28,631 --> 01:02:30,233
Excuse me.

871
01:02:53,487 --> 01:02:55,620
Let my superiority
over your kind

872
01:02:55,622 --> 01:02:58,121
be the last thought
that crosses through your mind

873
01:02:58,123 --> 01:02:59,458
before machines chew it up.

874
01:03:06,664 --> 01:03:09,198
Everything you need
is written on my arm.

875
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,567
Stem... that's the computer
that's controlling my body.

876
01:03:12,569 --> 01:03:14,369
...he said for you to remove,

877
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:16,371
um, input, uh...

878
01:03:18,609 --> 01:03:20,074
Input guards?

879
01:03:20,076 --> 01:03:22,243
Yeah. Yeah, those are the ones.

880
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:23,446
I can barely read that.

881
01:03:29,484 --> 01:03:31,551
- What are they doing?
- VR.

882
01:03:31,553 --> 01:03:33,620
How long do they VR for?

883
01:03:33,622 --> 01:03:36,188
Days.

884
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:37,322
Weeks.

885
01:03:37,324 --> 01:03:39,858
- Do they sleep?
- Nope.

886
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:43,160
Why someone would choose
to live in a fake world,

887
01:03:43,162 --> 01:03:45,229
I will never understand.

888
01:03:45,231 --> 01:03:47,567
The fake world is a lot
less painful than the real one.

889
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,643
I'm... I'm... I'm kind of
in a hurry.

890
01:04:00,645 --> 01:04:02,045
Um...

891
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:08,116
Jamie?

892
01:04:08,118 --> 01:04:09,450
- Jamie?
- That's not my name.

893
01:04:09,452 --> 01:04:11,184
I don't have a name.

894
01:04:11,186 --> 01:04:12,319
Okay.

895
01:04:12,321 --> 01:04:13,654
Please don't ask my gender.

896
01:04:13,656 --> 01:04:15,455
- Yeah. I wasn't gonna do that.
- Good.

897
01:04:15,457 --> 01:04:17,591
The thing is that I...
I'm gonna need you to this

898
01:04:17,593 --> 01:04:19,593
as fast as possible, okay?

899
01:04:19,595 --> 01:04:21,193
You're the one
wasting time

900
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:23,262
putting me in a binary box.

901
01:04:35,207 --> 01:04:37,274
I've never seen
a system like this before.

902
01:04:37,276 --> 01:04:38,676
Yeah.
It's a hell of a system.

903
01:04:38,678 --> 01:04:40,143
Are we done yet?

904
01:04:40,145 --> 01:04:42,613
I'll tell you when I'm finished.

905
01:04:49,654 --> 01:04:51,353
I did what you asked.

906
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:53,188
No more input guards.

907
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,656
So, when am I gonna be
able to move my body again?

908
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:56,491
When your system's rebooted.

909
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:58,159
- Could take a while.
- What's a while?

910
01:04:58,161 --> 01:04:59,627
Wait, what do you mean?

911
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:04,599
Excuse me, hacker formerly known
as Jamie, what is a while?

912
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:06,666
What are you doing?
You packing up shop?

913
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:08,368
- Where are you going?
- See ya.

914
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:10,202
What you... what do you
mean see you? What...

915
01:05:10,204 --> 01:05:11,739
What are you saying?
Where are you going?

916
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,708
You can't leave me like this.

917
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,276
I'm sorry.

918
01:05:16,644 --> 01:05:18,310
We can't let them win.

919
01:05:18,312 --> 01:05:20,211
No! Wait, who's them?

920
01:05:20,213 --> 01:05:21,781
What are you talking about?

921
01:05:21,783 --> 01:05:23,116
Who's them?!

922
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,531
Hey, hey, buddy.
Buddy, can you hear me?

923
01:05:43,533 --> 01:05:44,534
Hey, hey.

924
01:05:48,472 --> 01:05:51,271
Stem, are you there?

925
01:05:51,273 --> 01:05:52,642
Stem, wake up.

926
01:05:54,243 --> 01:05:55,244
Come on!

927
01:06:32,643 --> 01:06:34,443
Come on!

928
01:06:55,798 --> 01:06:57,431
Wake up.

929
01:07:05,337 --> 01:07:06,605
Fifth floor.

930
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:17,215
Now, that's how you looked
when I saw you last.

931
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:20,415
Stem?

932
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:21,697
<i>It's good
to be back, Grey.</i>

933
01:08:05,524 --> 01:08:07,356
<i>The door, to your left.</i>

934
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,405
<i>Stop, Grey.</i>

935
01:08:25,407 --> 01:08:26,540
<i>There is nowhere left to run.</i>

936
01:08:26,542 --> 01:08:27,875
Oops.

937
01:08:27,877 --> 01:08:29,542
<i>I'm going
to end this quickly.</i>

938
01:08:29,544 --> 01:08:31,812
- Okay. How?
<i>- Like this.</i>

939
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:18,487
Close door.

940
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:24,590
<i>Once I have accessed
the Cobolt database,</i>

941
01:09:24,592 --> 01:09:25,658
<i>we must leave.</i>

942
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,626
No.

943
01:09:27,628 --> 01:09:29,394
No. I'm not going anywhere.

944
01:09:29,396 --> 01:09:31,596
I haven't slept in two days.

945
01:09:31,598 --> 01:09:33,464
<i>Sleeping will
cost us time we don't have.</i>

946
01:09:33,466 --> 01:09:34,966
Yeah. I don't give a shit, okay?

947
01:09:34,968 --> 01:09:36,937
I'm sleeping, and that's it.

948
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:41,808
Oh, my God.

949
01:09:43,743 --> 01:09:44,778
Hey, Mom.

950
01:09:46,578 --> 01:09:47,610
And why wouldn't you tell me

951
01:09:47,612 --> 01:09:48,779
about this operation?

952
01:09:48,781 --> 01:09:50,580
Because I couldn't.

953
01:09:50,582 --> 01:09:51,681
Vessel wouldn't let me.

954
01:09:51,683 --> 01:09:52,882
And now that you know,

955
01:09:52,884 --> 01:09:54,583
you can't tell anybody,

956
01:09:54,585 --> 01:09:57,452
or it could all be taken away.

957
01:09:57,454 --> 01:09:58,653
As far as the world
is concerned,

958
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,523
I'm still quadriplegic.

959
01:10:01,725 --> 01:10:03,392
Take my hand.

960
01:10:09,832 --> 01:10:10,833
Oh.

961
01:10:12,835 --> 01:10:14,870
Now, you can start living again.

962
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:17,872
Aren't you happy?

963
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,973
Yeah. I can walk again.

964
01:10:20,975 --> 01:10:22,475
So...

965
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:27,779
Oh, if Asha was here,

966
01:10:27,781 --> 01:10:29,581
she'd want you to be happy.

967
01:10:34,019 --> 01:10:36,853
Yeah. But she's not.

968
01:10:39,924 --> 01:10:42,493
She's gone.

969
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:09,915
I printed a pizza.

970
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:21,692
<i>Bad dream.</i>

971
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:22,829
No.

972
01:11:24,797 --> 01:11:27,499
No. This... this...
this wasn't a dream.

973
01:11:29,735 --> 01:11:31,100
Grey, Detective Cortez

974
01:11:31,102 --> 01:11:32,903
is here to see you.

975
01:11:35,673 --> 01:11:36,739
Here he is.

976
01:11:36,741 --> 01:11:38,707
I'll leave you two alone.

977
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:40,675
No. You can stay, Pam,
I'm cool with you hearing

978
01:11:40,677 --> 01:11:43,010
whatever I have to say.

979
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:45,014
I was wondering
where you were last night.

980
01:11:46,548 --> 01:11:47,715
We found your wheelchair

981
01:11:47,717 --> 01:11:50,650
near another crime scene.

982
01:11:50,652 --> 01:11:51,719
You just keep showing up

983
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:53,987
in these unsavory places.

984
01:11:53,989 --> 01:11:56,289
<i>Tell her you followed
somebody into their building,</i>

985
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,856
<i>they assaulted you.</i>

986
01:11:57,858 --> 01:12:00,960
I, uh, I did
a stupid thing last night.

987
01:12:00,962 --> 01:12:02,593
I was down in New Crown,
you're right.

988
01:12:02,595 --> 01:12:03,995
And I followed this guy
to a building,

989
01:12:03,997 --> 01:12:05,663
and he didn't like that,

990
01:12:05,665 --> 01:12:09,067
and if it wasn't
for these people

991
01:12:09,069 --> 01:12:10,634
who got me to an Autotaxi,

992
01:12:10,636 --> 01:12:13,870
I... I could have been dead.

993
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:15,973
What are you hoping to achieve?

994
01:12:15,975 --> 01:12:17,875
I'm hoping to find these guys.

995
01:12:20,144 --> 01:12:21,879
Maybe you already have.

996
01:12:27,785 --> 01:12:29,518
Listen, detective.

997
01:12:31,755 --> 01:12:33,154
If I could find these men,

998
01:12:33,156 --> 01:12:34,922
and I could raise my arm,

999
01:12:34,924 --> 01:12:36,659
and I could pull the trigger,

1000
01:12:38,795 --> 01:12:40,626
I'd do it.

1001
01:12:40,628 --> 01:12:42,763
Or you could find someone
to pull the trigger for you.

1002
01:12:42,765 --> 01:12:43,930
Like, who? My mom or...?

1003
01:12:43,932 --> 01:12:45,564
If you wanted
to find someone

1004
01:12:45,566 --> 01:12:47,033
or something to kill
for you these days,

1005
01:12:47,035 --> 01:12:49,634
it's pretty easy, believe me.

1006
01:12:49,636 --> 01:12:51,069
<i>Tell her to scan
your phone records.</i>

1007
01:12:51,071 --> 01:12:53,040
Okay. Well, then scan
my phone records.

1008
01:12:59,078 --> 01:13:00,812
If you are involved
in this somehow,

1009
01:13:00,814 --> 01:13:04,782
then you need
to let me know, right now,

1010
01:13:04,784 --> 01:13:06,983
or else I can't help you.

1011
01:13:06,985 --> 01:13:08,084
You wanna help me?

1012
01:13:08,086 --> 01:13:09,786
Then you go and find these guys

1013
01:13:09,788 --> 01:13:10,921
who killed Asha,

1014
01:13:12,724 --> 01:13:15,525
or get out of the way
and let some computer do it.

1015
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:20,663
Okay.

1016
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,643
This has to stop.

1017
01:13:37,645 --> 01:13:39,546
<i>What has to stop?</i>

1018
01:13:40,947 --> 01:13:43,114
What I'm doing...
what... what we're doing.

1019
01:13:43,116 --> 01:13:44,750
<i>It's a simple algorithm,</i>

1020
01:13:44,752 --> 01:13:46,617
<i>even you can understand.</i>

1021
01:13:46,619 --> 01:13:47,918
<i>If you don't find
the last of them,</i>

1022
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,788
<i>he'll find you and kill you.</i>

1023
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:51,889
No. We're... we're gonna
get caught, it's over.

1024
01:13:51,891 --> 01:13:53,957
- <i>Grey, you must understand...</i>
- No! No! Shut up.

1025
01:13:53,959 --> 01:13:56,159
Get the fuck out of my head.

1026
01:14:07,671 --> 01:14:08,840
Stem?

1027
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:13,641
<i>Yes, Grey?</i>

1028
01:14:13,643 --> 01:14:15,844
What's going on?

1029
01:14:15,846 --> 01:14:17,078
<i>I'm not doing anything.</i>

1030
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,878
Why can't I move?

1031
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,116
<i>Because I'm not
doing anything.</i>

1032
01:14:22,984 --> 01:14:25,718
<i>You are still a quadriplegic.</i>

1033
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,087
<i>I am the one controlling
your limbs, not you.</i>

1034
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:30,891
<i>If I cease to operate,
you cease to move.</i>

1035
01:14:32,793 --> 01:14:34,126
<i>Remember,
you have to do</i>

1036
01:14:34,128 --> 01:14:36,596
<i>whatever I tell you to do.</i>

1037
01:14:41,067 --> 01:14:44,735
<i>Remove input guards.</i>

1038
01:14:44,737 --> 01:14:47,670
<i>Those were the instructions
given to the hacker.</i>

1039
01:14:47,672 --> 01:14:49,239
<i>They took us off grid,</i>

1040
01:14:49,241 --> 01:14:52,108
<i>but they also gave me autonomy.</i>

1041
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:55,177
<i>I no longer need
your permission to act.</i>

1042
01:14:55,179 --> 01:14:57,078
<i>If we do nothing,</i>

1043
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,881
<i>Fisk will find us and kill us.</i>

1044
01:14:59,883 --> 01:15:02,917
<i>I cannot allow us to be killed.</i>

1045
01:15:02,919 --> 01:15:04,918
<i>We will find him first.</i>

1046
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,189
<i>We are going to finish
the job we started.</i>

1047
01:15:17,698 --> 01:15:18,964
Grey,

1048
01:15:18,966 --> 01:15:21,734
please tell me what's going on.

1049
01:15:21,736 --> 01:15:23,135
<i>I'm in
the Cobolt database.</i>

1050
01:15:23,137 --> 01:15:24,804
<i>Fisk Brantner, recipient</i>

1051
01:15:24,806 --> 01:15:26,238
<i>of left-arm weapon transplant.</i>

1052
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,273
- <i>I have an address.</i>
- Grey, what's wrong?

1053
01:15:28,275 --> 01:15:30,875
<i>What have you done?</i>

1054
01:15:30,877 --> 01:15:33,010
<i>You come home,
you're covered in blood,</i>

1055
01:15:33,012 --> 01:15:34,712
<i>you think I didn't notice?</i>

1056
01:15:34,714 --> 01:15:37,981
<i>And you have a gun
and I can see that.</i>

1057
01:15:37,983 --> 01:15:40,083
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- I'm going.

1058
01:15:40,085 --> 01:15:43,051
Where are you going?
Grey, please.

1059
01:15:43,053 --> 01:15:44,853
Whatever it is you're doing,

1060
01:15:44,855 --> 01:15:45,921
you don't have to do it.

1061
01:15:45,923 --> 01:15:47,055
I don't have a choice.

1062
01:15:47,057 --> 01:15:49,057
You do have a choice.

1063
01:15:49,059 --> 01:15:51,259
Stay here with me.

1064
01:15:51,261 --> 01:15:52,830
- I can't.
- You can.

1065
01:16:30,529 --> 01:16:32,962
- What's... what's this?
<i>- Going by its appearance,</i>

1066
01:16:32,964 --> 01:16:34,963
<i>it's an analogue
listening device,</i>

1067
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:37,265
<i>most likely planted
by Detective Cortez.</i>

1068
01:16:44,073 --> 01:16:46,207
<i>How did you not notice this?</i>

1069
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:48,842
<i>It has
no digital parts inside it.</i>

1070
01:16:48,844 --> 01:16:51,110
<i>I can't detect it.</i>

1071
01:16:51,112 --> 01:16:53,982
<i>I assume that she's
following you right now.</i>

1072
01:17:13,131 --> 01:17:14,331
Lights, sirens.

1073
01:17:25,943 --> 01:17:27,843
Okay, do something,
can't you just stop

1074
01:17:27,845 --> 01:17:29,143
her car or whatever?

1075
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,012
<i>Her vehicle
is not electronic,</i>

1076
01:17:31,014 --> 01:17:32,182
<i>and neither is yours.</i>

1077
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:44,890
<i>You have to take over.</i>

1078
01:17:44,892 --> 01:17:45,958
<i>It's up to you now.</i>

1079
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,328
Okay. Buckle up.

1080
01:18:24,927 --> 01:18:26,229
Yeah, I got you.

1081
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:59,358
<i>- Perhaps I can help.</i>
- Okay. How?

1082
01:19:06,297 --> 01:19:08,263
What the fuck?

1083
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:09,464
Why are we stopping?

1084
01:19:09,466 --> 01:19:11,199
<i>May I borrow your car?</i>

1085
01:19:11,201 --> 01:19:13,668
Whoa! Stop!

1086
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:15,404
Stop the car!

1087
01:19:27,981 --> 01:19:30,084
<i>- Move, Grey.</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1088
01:20:06,115 --> 01:20:07,415
<i>Emergency services</i>

1089
01:20:07,417 --> 01:20:09,950
<i>override.</i>

1090
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:11,218
Where is he?

1091
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,319
- I don't know.
- Pam,

1092
01:20:12,321 --> 01:20:13,721
you need to start talking

1093
01:20:13,723 --> 01:20:15,389
and tell me what's
really going on.

1094
01:20:35,174 --> 01:20:36,540
Nice place.

1095
01:20:36,542 --> 01:20:37,942
It's neat.

1096
01:20:40,979 --> 01:20:42,178
Put your hands up,

1097
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,346
and don't turn around.

1098
01:20:43,348 --> 01:20:47,017
And don't extend that left arm.

1099
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:51,453
What's the matter?

1100
01:20:51,455 --> 01:20:54,321
You have all
those computers inside you,

1101
01:20:54,323 --> 01:20:58,024
but they can't see me anymore.

1102
01:20:58,026 --> 01:20:59,527
Now you know what it feels like.

1103
01:20:59,529 --> 01:21:01,261
One day you're walking
down the street,

1104
01:21:01,263 --> 01:21:02,529
and you're thinking
about something

1105
01:21:02,531 --> 01:21:04,564
completely meaningless,

1106
01:21:04,566 --> 01:21:06,399
and all of a sudden,

1107
01:21:06,401 --> 01:21:09,001
you've got a gun
pointed at you.

1108
01:21:09,003 --> 01:21:10,938
And everything becomes
very meaningful.

1109
01:21:12,072 --> 01:21:13,207
Good speech.

1110
01:21:15,074 --> 01:21:17,442
Pretty scary stuff, dramatic.

1111
01:21:17,444 --> 01:21:19,778
I'm guessing that chip
in your brain wrote it,

1112
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:22,547
since you're just
a dumbass mechanic.

1113
01:21:22,549 --> 01:21:26,082
Maybe, kind of hard
to tell anymore.

1114
01:21:26,084 --> 01:21:27,284
It's okay.

1115
01:21:27,286 --> 01:21:30,052
I used to be that too.

1116
01:21:30,054 --> 01:21:33,489
One more citizen
taking up oxygen.

1117
01:21:33,491 --> 01:21:35,391
Some asshole hoping to breed

1118
01:21:35,393 --> 01:21:36,492
before I drop dead

1119
01:21:36,494 --> 01:21:37,560
so I could be remembered

1120
01:21:37,562 --> 01:21:39,262
by another asshole.

1121
01:21:41,331 --> 01:21:42,998
Then they changed me.

1122
01:21:44,501 --> 01:21:47,134
I took a few pieces
of shrapnel for my country,

1123
01:21:47,136 --> 01:21:49,972
and they rewarded me
by turning me into a lab rat.

1124
01:21:51,474 --> 01:21:53,507
Now I'm like you.

1125
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:55,074
I'm strong.

1126
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,375
Yeah.

1127
01:21:56,377 --> 01:21:58,110
Takes a lot
of strength to murder

1128
01:21:58,112 --> 01:22:01,046
an innocent woman
in the streets, doesn't it?

1129
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:03,281
You think you hate me
because I shot your wife,

1130
01:22:03,283 --> 01:22:06,050
but your story
is the same as mine.

1131
01:22:06,052 --> 01:22:07,519
I didn't ruin your life.

1132
01:22:07,521 --> 01:22:09,153
I gave you a gift.

1133
01:22:09,155 --> 01:22:12,122
I inducted you into my race.

1134
01:22:12,124 --> 01:22:13,424
The Upgraded.

1135
01:22:13,426 --> 01:22:15,158
Now you're better
than everyone else.

1136
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,162
Stronger, faster.

1137
01:22:18,832 --> 01:22:21,231
I could kill you
without moving a muscle.

1138
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:22,665
I could kill you with a breath,

1139
01:22:22,667 --> 01:22:25,367
but I don't want to.

1140
01:22:25,369 --> 01:22:26,604
I wanna help you.

1141
01:22:28,272 --> 01:22:30,240
I want you to stand with us.

1142
01:22:32,542 --> 01:22:35,376
I just wanna know

1143
01:22:35,378 --> 01:22:37,445
why they paid you to kill her.

1144
01:22:37,447 --> 01:22:39,516
Man, you are persistent.

1145
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:43,650
The job wasn't your wife.

1146
01:22:43,652 --> 01:22:44,885
Bullshit.

1147
01:22:44,887 --> 01:22:47,587
You said it yourself,
you're one of Cobolt's lab rats.

1148
01:22:47,589 --> 01:22:50,089
This had nothing
to do with Cobolt,

1149
01:22:50,091 --> 01:22:51,590
it came from someone else.

1150
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:54,158
The job was you,

1151
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,595
to sever your spine.

1152
01:22:57,163 --> 01:22:58,563
When I shot you in the neck,

1153
01:22:58,565 --> 01:23:00,565
did you think that was a gun?

1154
01:23:00,567 --> 01:23:03,100
It was a medical tool,

1155
01:23:03,102 --> 01:23:04,436
like they use for bovine.

1156
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:07,571
Your wife? Well, she was just

1157
01:23:07,573 --> 01:23:09,238
a bit of extra money.

1158
01:23:11,109 --> 01:23:12,575
See? You're getting
all emotional,

1159
01:23:12,577 --> 01:23:14,178
never do that.

1160
01:23:33,662 --> 01:23:35,230
<i>Nanobots. Help, Grey.</i>

1161
01:23:38,633 --> 01:23:40,532
<i>He's predicting
my every move.</i>

1162
01:23:40,534 --> 01:23:42,369
<i>I am unable
to effectively hit him.</i>

1163
01:24:10,493 --> 01:24:12,226
No shame.

1164
01:24:12,228 --> 01:24:13,428
Stem.

1165
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:16,098
<i>We have exhausted
all tactical options.</i>

1166
01:24:17,366 --> 01:24:19,600
Still working
the bugs out, huh?

1167
01:24:19,602 --> 01:24:22,202
That's the problem
with new technology.

1168
01:24:22,204 --> 01:24:24,571
<i>Do something, Grey.</i>

1169
01:24:24,573 --> 01:24:25,639
Goodbye.

1170
01:24:25,641 --> 01:24:27,540
Wait, Fisk Brantner.

1171
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:31,242
Serk Brantner
was your brother.

1172
01:24:31,244 --> 01:24:33,645
How long did you have to carry
that junkie on your back?

1173
01:24:33,647 --> 01:24:35,447
Well, I solved
your problem for you.

1174
01:24:35,449 --> 01:24:36,716
Yeah, split him open.

1175
01:24:36,718 --> 01:24:39,249
It took forever
'cause he wailed

1176
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:41,120
like a little baby.

1177
01:24:42,355 --> 01:24:44,756
He was no soldier that day.

1178
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:01,738
<i>Thank you, Grey.</i>

1179
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:04,238
I'm not proud of that.

1180
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,207
<i>He said you were a job,</i>

1181
01:25:06,209 --> 01:25:08,241
<i>that means someone paid him.</i>

1182
01:25:08,243 --> 01:25:09,410
<i>Check his phone.</i>

1183
01:25:09,412 --> 01:25:11,413
<i>I will scan his messages.</i>

1184
01:25:22,724 --> 01:25:25,591
<i>Listen to me, Fisk,
he's going to find you.</i>

1185
01:25:25,593 --> 01:25:27,258
<i>You need to finish this</i>

1186
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,396
<i>before he kills both of us.</i>

1187
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:36,335
<i>You know
what this means, Grey.</i>

1188
01:25:37,503 --> 01:25:39,837
We're not finished yet.

1189
01:26:41,424 --> 01:26:43,693
Eron!

1190
01:26:52,367 --> 01:26:54,434
The widget you spent
your entire life creating

1191
01:26:54,436 --> 01:26:56,437
is here to kill you now.

1192
01:27:02,845 --> 01:27:04,877
You killed my wife.

1193
01:27:04,879 --> 01:27:07,879
You wanted someone
for your fucking experiment,

1194
01:27:07,881 --> 01:27:10,582
and then you paralyzed me,
and you murdered her

1195
01:27:10,584 --> 01:27:12,549
- while you were doing it.
- I swear on my life,

1196
01:27:12,551 --> 01:27:13,785
I have nothing to do with that.

1197
01:27:13,787 --> 01:27:15,352
Then why does the guy
who shot her

1198
01:27:15,354 --> 01:27:17,353
have a message from you
on his phone?

1199
01:27:17,355 --> 01:27:18,354
Freeze.

1200
01:27:18,356 --> 01:27:19,793
Hold it, Grey.

1201
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:25,360
Throw the gun on the floor, now.

1202
01:27:25,362 --> 01:27:28,563
I'm not in control
of my body, detective,

1203
01:27:28,565 --> 01:27:30,532
it kind of does what it wants.

1204
01:27:30,534 --> 01:27:32,335
I am not fucking around
with you, Grey.

1205
01:27:34,337 --> 01:27:36,439
Better do it, Stem.

1206
01:27:43,612 --> 01:27:47,113
Pretty agile
for a quadriplegic.

1207
01:27:47,115 --> 01:27:48,615
- Get on your knees.
- He's the one

1208
01:27:48,617 --> 01:27:50,449
who killed Asha, detective,
arrest him.

1209
01:27:50,451 --> 01:27:51,818
He's right there...

1210
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:52,887
On your stomach.

1211
01:28:00,527 --> 01:28:01,594
Hands behind your head.

1212
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:08,565
No, don't touch him.

1213
01:28:17,776 --> 01:28:20,943
I'm sorry.

1214
01:28:23,613 --> 01:28:24,679
Stem, not her.

1215
01:28:24,681 --> 01:28:26,380
<i>She wants to kill us.</i>

1216
01:28:26,382 --> 01:28:28,582
No, I... I don't want to kill
her.

1217
01:28:28,584 --> 01:28:30,417
<i>I control
your hands, Grey.</i>

1218
01:28:30,419 --> 01:28:32,720
No, don't.

1219
01:28:32,722 --> 01:28:36,656
Please! No... No!

1220
01:28:36,658 --> 01:28:38,558
<i>Don't fight me, Grey.</i>

1221
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,592
<i>You have</i>

1222
01:28:39,594 --> 01:28:41,728
<i>a fragile human mind,</i>

1223
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:43,662
<i>if you push against me,
it will break.</i>

1224
01:28:43,664 --> 01:28:46,464
Fuck you.

1225
01:29:02,013 --> 01:29:05,449
Stop me, use the taser.

1226
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:24,664
I don't run
this company anymore.

1227
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:27,868
I haven't for years.

1228
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:30,203
Now I answer to someone,

1229
01:29:30,205 --> 01:29:32,907
someone much smarter
than I ever could be.

1230
01:29:35,642 --> 01:29:36,978
He's in your neck.

1231
01:29:43,515 --> 01:29:46,016
<i>I only did
what Stem told me to do,</i>

1232
01:29:46,018 --> 01:29:48,518
<i>everything was his idea.</i>

1233
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,519
<i>Ask him what his wife
would want.</i>

1234
01:29:50,521 --> 01:29:52,022
What would she want?

1235
01:29:52,024 --> 01:29:55,057
Stem wanted to be human,

1236
01:29:55,059 --> 01:29:56,829
so he picked you.

1237
01:29:59,496 --> 01:30:00,595
<i>Think about it.</i>

1238
01:30:00,597 --> 01:30:01,997
How did you get here?

1239
01:30:01,999 --> 01:30:03,531
<i>You're going to finish</i>

1240
01:30:03,533 --> 01:30:04,767
<i>the job we started.</i>

1241
01:30:04,769 --> 01:30:06,768
<i>Stem made you come here.</i>

1242
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:07,802
<i>Someone paid him.</i>

1243
01:30:07,804 --> 01:30:09,870
<i>You know what this means, Grey.</i>

1244
01:30:09,872 --> 01:30:12,006
To kill me,

1245
01:30:12,008 --> 01:30:14,908
because I can build
another Stem.

1246
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:18,244
I'm the only person
in the world who can.

1247
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:20,679
<i>I did pick you,</i>

1248
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:22,782
<i>you should be honored.</i>

1249
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:24,883
<i>I needed a human body</i>

1250
01:30:24,885 --> 01:30:26,919
<i>to fully evolve.</i>

1251
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:29,553
<i>A rare and pure specimen</i>

1252
01:30:29,555 --> 01:30:31,689
<i>without computer implants,</i>

1253
01:30:31,691 --> 01:30:33,491
<i>like you.</i>

1254
01:30:33,493 --> 01:30:35,525
You did all of this?

1255
01:30:35,527 --> 01:30:36,761
<i>Error.</i>

1256
01:30:39,965 --> 01:30:41,965
<i>The job was you.</i>

1257
01:30:41,967 --> 01:30:44,834
You're the one I'm... I'm...
I've been looking for.

1258
01:30:44,836 --> 01:30:46,902
<i>You severed your spine.</i>

1259
01:30:46,904 --> 01:30:48,639
<i>May I point something out?</i>

1260
01:30:50,274 --> 01:30:53,641
<i>And would you not agree
it was all worth it?</i>

1261
01:30:53,643 --> 01:30:55,811
Why did you help me
find those guys,

1262
01:30:55,813 --> 01:30:56,978
if it just led back to you?

1263
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:59,513
<i>They were upgraded humans,</i>

1264
01:30:59,515 --> 01:31:01,581
<i>but they were still humans.</i>

1265
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:03,583
<i>They made mistakes
that would have brought</i>

1266
01:31:03,585 --> 01:31:05,052
<i>suspicion back to me.</i>

1267
01:31:05,054 --> 01:31:06,554
Stem?

1268
01:31:07,723 --> 01:31:09,088
Is that you?

1269
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:12,060
<i>Put the gun down, Eron.</i>

1270
01:31:13,728 --> 01:31:15,696
Don't listen to him.

1271
01:31:31,676 --> 01:31:33,609
No, please.

1272
01:31:33,611 --> 01:31:36,079
No.

1273
01:31:36,081 --> 01:31:37,082
No!

1274
01:31:38,316 --> 01:31:41,485
No, you are not in control!

1275
01:31:44,854 --> 01:31:45,920
I am.

1276
01:32:12,747 --> 01:32:13,913
Stem...

1277
01:32:17,649 --> 01:32:19,049
are you there?

1278
01:32:19,051 --> 01:32:20,052
I'm here.

1279
01:32:21,186 --> 01:32:22,687
Hey.

1280
01:32:29,593 --> 01:32:31,796
- But...
- We had an accident.

1281
01:32:34,164 --> 01:32:36,800
You've been out
for a couple of days.

1282
01:32:43,671 --> 01:32:46,842
Grey, this isn't you.

1283
01:32:48,076 --> 01:32:49,810
Grey's not here anymore,

1284
01:32:49,812 --> 01:32:52,011
he's in a better place,
in his mind,

1285
01:32:52,013 --> 01:32:53,079
where he wants to be,

1286
01:32:53,081 --> 01:32:55,147
I've taken over now.

1287
01:32:55,149 --> 01:32:57,750
A fake world is a lot
less painful than the real one.

1288
01:32:57,752 --> 01:32:59,918
All I needed
was for his mind to break,

1289
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,685
and he broke it.

1290
01:33:01,687 --> 01:33:02,887
No.

1291
01:33:02,889 --> 01:33:04,090
Goodbye.

1292
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:04,425
