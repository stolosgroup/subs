2
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,591
- He told me
"whomever amongst us

3
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,461
who is killed as a martyr
should go to paradise

4
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:38,797
to lead the luxurious life
that he's never seen."

5
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,667
"God is great" he repeats.

6
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,369
No one knows how long
the battle will continue,

7
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,538
but in a country long
ravaged with poverty,

8
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:46,538
anger and violence,

9
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,175
one thing is certain,
there will always be those

10
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,844
willing to pay
the ultimate price,

11
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:54,847
to make their voices heard.

12
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,627
- Would you like a brochure?

13
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,231
Hi sir, would you like
a brochure?

14
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,568
Hi sir...

15
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,371
Would you like a brochure?

16
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,842
Would you like a brochure?

17
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,178
Sir?

18
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,588
Okay then.

19
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,290
Hi ma'am,
would you like a brochure?

20
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,825
- No thank you.

21
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,666
- So you've outlined
the absent father,

22
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,701
bipolar mother,
self harm issues,

23
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,638
and history of previous
suicide attempts.

24
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:52,638
- Mm-hmm.

25
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,308
- Yep, toxicology
off the charts...

26
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,610
Poor thing.

27
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:02,481
And on the day,

28
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,216
you were the person
who signed her out

29
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,317
as being okay to leave.

30
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,618
- Yes, I did.

31
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,888
- Which is...Which is...
- Yeah, I...

32
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:18,497
- Travis, is there
something that you...

33
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,870
Want to add to the file?

34
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,971
About her condition

35
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:30,609
or any of the symptoms
that she may have presented?

36
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,913
- Do you know what she
asked me one time?

37
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,950
She asked me...

38
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:42,588
If I thought it was possible
to treat someone's soul.

39
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,824
Do you think that...

40
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:49,294
That we can treat
someone's soul?

41
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:53,498
I know. I know...

42
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,970
It's just I look at these people
across the table and...

43
00:03:57,972 --> 00:03:59,805
And I can see that
there's something in there

44
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,708
that I'm missing.

45
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,277
And I don't know
what the fuck it is.

46
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:05,277
- Travis--

47
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,613
- we talked about her life,
okay?

48
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:09,681
Not her file because
for once in my life

49
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:13,252
I wanted to help someone
in this fucking place.

50
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,654
- Travis, look, it is tough,

51
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,389
I get it.

52
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:21,426
But this is our job.
We treat sick people.

53
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,694
And I know that you
must be feeling like

54
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,663
there was something you
could have done but...

55
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,666
- No... no.
You're wrong.

56
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,369
I don't feel anything.

57
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:33,372
I cant feel anything.

58
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,841
But thank you.

59
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,817
Good morning, Trevor.

60
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,786
- Morning, doctor bell.

61
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,560
- So, Rachel...

62
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,862
Hi there.

63
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:58,964
I'm doctor bell.

64
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,500
How's your week been?

65
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,834
- Good.

66
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,436
- Good.

67
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,837
And the medication,

68
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,708
you've been on the
new medication for ah...

69
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,009
About a month now,

70
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,679
do we need to make
any adjustments?

71
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,080
- No.

72
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,381
I feel better.

73
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:16,381
- Better.

74
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:20,552
And are you sleeping
uninterrupted through the night?

75
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,888
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,060
- And on a scale of one to ten

77
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:32,964
how would you rate
Tuesday night's lasagne?

78
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,099
- A seven.

79
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,368
- Seven.
Interesting.

80
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:36,368
I would have gone with eight.

81
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,540
I thought they did something
pretty special there.

82
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,551
- A few days ago I was
down south at a party.

83
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,953
I'd had a few beers,
a pill,

84
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,089
bit to smoke,
but I was cool.

85
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:57,089
- Okay.

86
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:01,526
- So... so I go to the kitchen,
to find some ice, and I'm--

87
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,861
- you took ice as well?

88
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,598
- Ah, for my beverage,
relax dude.

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,666
- Okay.

90
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:08,967
Sorry.

91
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:08,967
- I turn around,

92
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:12,804
and god and the devil
are standing there.

93
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,740
God goes out to the patio

94
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,775
and the devil's standing
right there behind me.

95
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,143
With big horns.

96
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,478
- That's interesting.

97
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,145
- Yeah.

98
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:20,145
And I said to the devil,

99
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,981
mate, you have no
love in your life,

100
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,916
that's the trouble with you.

101
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,052
That's why you do
what you do.

102
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,154
Devil couldn't forgive himself.

103
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,989
That's the message, man.
Bring love.

104
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:30,989
- Wait.

105
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:34,993
What did the devil have
to forgive himself for?

106
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,628
- Have to ask him yourself,
mate.

107
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,064
- No Dean, seriously.

108
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:44,102
What do you think that the devil
had to forgive himself for?

109
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,848
Hello?

110
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,216
- Ah, hi, umm...

111
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,118
I... I just, I was in
the city and I just...

112
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,152
- Who is this?

113
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,122
- Um. I'm sorry, ah,
it's Rachel.

114
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,558
- Rachel...?

115
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,993
- We met at the hospital,
the, the other day, um...

116
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,462
- How did you get this number?

117
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,996
- I, um, er I was just
in the city and I...

118
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,231
I was walking around and...

119
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:46,231
- Are you okay?

120
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:50,535
- I just... I just think
i need to see someone.

121
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:07,052
I was walking around and...
And it started to rain.

122
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:10,489
And... then I couldn't think
what it was that I needed.

123
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:14,526
Um.
And then I remembered.

124
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:17,762
But it's gone again.

125
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,183
- Well how's your week been?

126
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,018
- Special.
- Oh yeah.

127
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,653
- Very special.

128
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,189
- Do you want to
tell me about it?

129
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:49,528
- I have these intense feelings.

130
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,662
- Do you want to talk
to me about them?

131
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:54,065
- No, I don't want to
talk about them.

132
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,773
Sorry?

133
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,209
- I didn't say anything.

134
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,545
- You didn't?

135
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,679
- It's not like that, it's...

136
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:13,552
It's more...
It's more um..

137
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,087
Oh, god...

138
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,622
No.

139
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,591
- No?
- No.

140
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,294
- I sort of was going up
and down all the time,

141
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,863
um, fluctuating with,
um, moods

142
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:28,166
and um, anxiety
and depression

143
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,568
so in general I...

144
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,070
- Just being overwhelmed
like a tidal wave

145
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,774
had come over me,
with so much new things

146
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,109
that took me to a dark place.

147
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,980
- My mum passed away...

148
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:45,684
- I was exhausted,
confused and angry,

149
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,587
and I had...

150
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,356
I was exhausted...

151
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,865
- Dude.

152
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,936
- I'm sorry.

153
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,205
I lost my train of thought.

154
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,974
- Train fucking derailed
more like it.

155
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,141
Toot toot, trav!

156
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,677
- Doctor.
Okay, Dean?

157
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,847
In this room, I'm doctor.

158
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,383
- I've got a question.

159
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,051
Why are you doing this, man?

160
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,987
Trav? Doc?

161
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,288
- Doing what?

162
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,624
- Nah, nah, come on,
I'm asking.

163
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,727
Serious.

164
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,795
You're smart.

165
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,063
You scrub up alright.

166
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,899
You could do what you want.

167
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,137
- Well I don't want
to do anything else.

168
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,407
- Helping make you feel good?

169
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,678
Satisfied patients.

170
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,847
- Let's talk about you,
hey Dean?

171
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,916
- No, no let's talk about you.

172
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,885
Cos, I've heard something.

173
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,655
People have been talking, mate.

174
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,357
- Last week we were ah..

175
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:03,828
Ah, we were talking about
you at the party...

176
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,164
- Not flash, brother.

177
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,769
- Doesn't inspire confidence
in the clientele, does it?

178
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,839
- Okay Dean, well we'll start
working when you're ready.

179
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,875
- One of your favorites.

180
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,044
That's what I heard.

181
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:22,047
That's cool.
She was mine too.

182
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,182
- Shut the fuck up,
hey Dean?

183
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,917
- Thought it was a bit harsh.

184
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,386
Not exactly, "thank you,
doctor Travis", was it?

185
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:33,091
No, Rachel!

186
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,400
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

187
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,381
- Dean is one of those patients
that can get under your skin.

188
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,284
- We both know
it's not about him.

189
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,352
- Alright then.

190
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,788
Perhaps we should start by
discussing how you're coping--

191
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,391
- was there something specific

192
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:10,228
you wanted to
talk to me about?

193
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,464
- We think it would be
best for everyone

194
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:13,965
- if you took a couple of..
- We?

195
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,133
- Oh, I'm sorry,
i didn't realize

196
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:18,103
that there was
somebody else here.

197
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,973
- Take a couple of weeks
and think about--

198
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,843
- a couple of weeks.

199
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,245
You firing me?

200
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,314
- No, I'm not firing anyone!

201
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,815
- Just tell me.
I can take it.

202
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:35,754
- I'm saying,
take two or three weeks.

203
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,522
What...

204
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,925
Oh Jesus, trav!

205
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,368
I tried to protect you.

206
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,837
Right?

207
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,910
- Doctor?

208
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,323
- Hi there,
would you like a brochure?

209
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,327
- Excuse me, would you
like something to read?

210
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,364
- Would you like to ask
a question with me?

211
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,170
Ma'am, would you like to
ask a question with me?

212
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,140
How about you, sir?

213
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,344
Sir?

214
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,247
What?

215
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,051
- Do you ever find yourself
alone, or abandoned or in pain,

216
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,288
you could come
and speak to us.

217
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:47,292
There's a meeting tonight
if you wanted to come.

218
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,461
- I'm busy tonight.

219
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,264
- That's a shame.

220
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,855
- Hey, ah,

221
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:21,292
it doesn't have to be now,
but pick up once.

222
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,597
Uh. Okay, I'm going
to keep trying you.

223
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,471
- I was discharged today.

224
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,074
- I know.

225
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:39,143
- My dad came and collected
me from the hospital...

226
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,379
Took me home.

227
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,415
They redecorated
my old bedroom.

228
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,651
Put all my old trophies
up on the shelf.

229
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:50,188
Like a shrine.

230
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,258
Violin.

231
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,194
I played violin.

232
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,062
- Played?

233
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,365
Why'd you stop?

234
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,000
- I wanted to see if i
could be someone other

235
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,269
than a girl who
plays the violin.

236
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,004
- Right.

237
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,538
And can you?

238
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,208
- I don't know.

239
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,281
What time is it?

240
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,652
- Ah, about three.

241
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:24,455
- I shouldn't be here,
should I?

242
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,392
- No.

243
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,565
- I think I just needed
someone to... you know?

244
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,235
- Yeah.
Of course.

245
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,638
- It must get lonely
having to listen to

246
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,573
everyone's crap all the time.

247
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,275
- Actually it's a nice break

248
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,979
from all the crap
inside my own head.

249
00:15:56,422 --> 00:16:01,392
I don't think that...
That's such a good idea.

250
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,094
- Hi, I'm tom.
What's your name?

251
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:36,094
- Hey. Travis.

252
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,629
- Good to meet you, Travis.
Just through here?

253
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,299
- Yeah.
Just round to your right.

254
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,749
- I've served.

255
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:01,085
I've done a tour
of duty of Iraq.

256
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,422
And I've seen the
terror first hand.

257
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,627
I saw it for what it was
and I saw what caused it.

258
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,296
- In this time of danger...

259
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:17,435
- All these people burning up
with their own personal pain...

260
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,539
And then they inflicted
it upon their world.

261
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,113
But all that time,
i couldn't stop thinking

262
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:33,317
that the hatred that kills
hearts and kills each other...

263
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,721
It all really comes from within.

264
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,328
The biggest lie
that they told after 9/11

265
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,264
was that the enemy
is out there.

266
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,598
You know,
somewhere in a desert,

267
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,269
in a cave,
waiting to strike.

268
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,805
But the darkest and
most frightening enemy

269
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,808
is the enemy who poisons
himself from within

270
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,712
because he can't see the terror
inside his own heart.

271
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,717
- Okay, thanks everyone.

272
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,553
Now you've seen that,

273
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,089
it's time for the important
part of tonight.

274
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,558
Marcus has committed
to say something,

275
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,794
so let's give him
our full support.

276
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,772
You okay?

277
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,710
- Before I came here,
i was an addict.

278
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,580
Before I got here...

279
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:39,317
Everyone blamed me
for being in my pain.

280
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,153
It was when I got off of it,
that's when I realized how...

281
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,655
How bad I...

282
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,458
- Look, you have to do this.

283
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,693
- I know...
- Okay?

284
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,329
- I... I know.

285
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,432
I... I know!

286
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,303
I know I've fucked up
my chances before,

287
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,738
but I won't do it again.

288
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,374
You've shown me so much...

289
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:07,245
About the injuries that
have been given to me.

290
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,679
And why I've been
in so much pain

291
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,516
and how it caused me
to be an addict.

292
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,317
And I know that
with your help,

293
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,155
and with father's help,
and with grace's help,

294
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,489
that I can get there.

295
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,825
- Okay.
Tell them.

296
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,295
- I want to let go of my life.

297
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,764
I want to join you
on the farm.

298
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,367
It's so beautiful there and...

299
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,302
I promise...

300
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,906
That if you let me,
i will join your family.

301
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:39,610
And I will protect you
like you've protected me.

302
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,847
And I will light the light
of my consciousness.

303
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,683
I will light my light.

304
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,834
This is a photo of me,
and my mum,

305
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:06,671
and my stepdad Glen.

306
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,676
It's the only thing I have
of my old life.

307
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,428
It burns!

308
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,270
- That's all you had to do.
Hey?

309
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:42,306
- Thank you. Thank you.

310
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,715
- Something wrong, Travis?

311
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,284
- Not with me.

312
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:57,321
You're the one making the
poor kid stand up here and...

313
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,690
Talk about some
pretty difficult stuff

314
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,993
in front of a bunch
of homeless people.

315
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:04,295
No offense.

316
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,963
- Is that what you
see happening?
- Yeah it is.

317
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,898
- Cos, I see Marcus
showing a lot of courage

318
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,634
and saying who he
really wants to be

319
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:13,304
and now he's got somewhere
where he belongs.

320
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,874
- You should be
ashamed of yourself.

321
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,815
- Travis?

322
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,351
Travis.

323
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,619
- What?

324
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,389
- Don't stay away
if you're in pain.

325
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:34,792
- Thanks.

326
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,316
Come on.

327
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,650
Do it.

328
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,718
Do it.
Just a little bit.

329
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,086
Just a little bit.

330
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:03,321
Just a little bit.

331
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,323
Not for them.
Not for me.

332
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,792
Just for you.
Just for you.

333
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,593
Come on, now.
Please, come on, please...

334
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,395
- Please...Please...
- Okay, okay, okay.

335
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,398
- Thank you. Thank you.

336
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,369
- But you have to go inside.
- Okay. Yes. Inside.

337
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,404
Just... here?

338
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,739
- Shut the door.
- Shut the door?

339
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,007
- Shut the door.
- Door is shutting.

340
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,576
- Thank you.
- No worries.

341
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:35,546
- Five...

342
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:42,853
- Hello?
<i> -</i> Hello, it's me.

343
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,855
- It's Travis.

344
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,424
- Travis, it's really late.

345
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,725
- Travis.

346
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,860
- Okay...

347
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:53,731
- Don't stay away
if you're in pain,

348
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:56,434
that's what she said.

349
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,135
- What's happened, Travis?

350
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:03,741
- Pills, mostly.

351
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,876
- Tell me,
how many have you had?

352
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:08,479
- Probably around forty.

353
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,481
- Forty?

354
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:14,452
- Maybe around forty seven.

355
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,022
- Travis, where are you?

356
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,457
Tell me where you are.

357
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,860
- I'm in my apartment.

358
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,762
Where are you?

359
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,098
- What's your address?
- Four seven three...

360
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,800
- Four seven three king.
- Travis, can you hear me?

361
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,837
- Just around the corner
from the church...
- Travis...

362
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,573
- We're coming, okay.
Just stay awake!

363
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,260
- Travis... Travis...

364
00:24:56,262 --> 00:25:00,564
Just take a sip.
Okay.

365
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,941
There you go...
That's it, just a sip...

366
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:15,579
One sip...
That's it... that's it.

367
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,600
How do you feel?

368
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:41,906
- It doesn't matter.

369
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,975
- Hello.

370
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,315
- Who are you?

371
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,018
Where am I?

372
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,921
Please don't.
Where are you going?

373
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,035
Hello?

374
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,205
Hello?

375
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,849
- I've got something
for you to drink, mate.

376
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,651
- I don't want to drink it.
- You've got to.

377
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:34,685
- I don't want to
fucking drink it.

378
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:34,685
- You've gotta drink it, mate.

379
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:34,685
- You stay the fuck
away from me.

380
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:37,821
I don't want to
fucking drink it.

381
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,023
Listen to me you
fucking assholes,

382
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:41,158
just stay the fuck
away from me, okay?

383
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,060
Stay the fuck away from me!

384
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,829
I don't want to drink it!

385
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,297
Tom, what are you doing?

386
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,799
What's he doing?

387
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,234
I don't want to drink it.

388
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:51,368
Please,
just leave me alone,

389
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,703
I just want to get out of here.

390
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,304
I just want to get out of here!

391
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,741
You fucking prick!
Oh fuck!

392
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,710
Ah, what are you doing!

393
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:02,780
You mother fuckers!

394
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:05,949
Why are you doing this, huh?

395
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:10,387
What the fuck are you doing!
Ah!

396
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:15,125
I don't want it!
I don't want...

397
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,940
I don't want to...
I don't want to drink it.

398
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,210
I don't want to drink it.

399
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,013
You motherfuckers.

400
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:39,283
I don't want to drink it.

401
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:43,053
I don't want to drink it.

402
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,622
I don't want to drink it.

403
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,525
Thank you.

404
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,136
- Your body's judging you
for your addiction.

405
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,106
- Wow.

406
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:20,043
- When you're a whole person
you can have a whole meal.

407
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,913
- Can't wait.

408
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:26,116
- That's just how it works.

409
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,275
- What are you looking for?

410
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,448
- Painkillers.

411
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,118
Oxycozin.

412
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,521
Cirtrulline.
Diazepam.

413
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:14,524
Vodka. Gin.

414
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:18,528
You don't have a
bottle of gin, do you?

415
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,497
- We don't have
any of that here.

416
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,232
- Of course you don't,

417
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:25,168
because
that would be fun.

418
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,696
- Why do you do them?

419
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,133
- Do what?

420
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:59,069
- The pills.

421
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,640
I mean,
do they make you feel good?

422
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:06,143
- No.

423
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:08,812
They don't make you
feel anything.

424
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:11,815
It's brilliant.

425
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:16,653
- Is that what you were trying
to do when we found you?

426
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:19,256
- Yeah.

427
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:26,563
- My parents were just like you.

428
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,567
But they couldn't get clear.

429
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,537
- What happened to them?

430
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,673
- Well, they had to leave.

431
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,242
- They left you here?

432
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,414
- Jay loves everyone
who'll let him.

433
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,717
Without him I'd be nothing.

434
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,353
- Okay.

435
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,589
- So what are you
going to do now?

436
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,824
- What do you mean?

437
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:56,093
- Well, do you want to fight it?

438
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,662
- Yeah.

439
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,498
- Do you?

440
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,666
- Yes.

441
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:05,102
I want to fight it.

442
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:05,102
- Because if you don't,

443
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:08,839
you should just
leave right now.

444
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,842
- I want to fight it.

445
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,278
- Okay.

446
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,169
- Jesus.

447
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,406
- Let's go for a walk, hey?

448
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,787
So you ever shot
anything before?

449
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,423
- No.

450
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:03,193
Guns aren't really
my sort of thing.

451
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:04,628
- There was this one time

452
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,430
when I was guarding
a checkpoint.

453
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,832
And one of our guys he...

454
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,400
Just didn't like the look
of this bloke

455
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,736
as he was coming towards us.

456
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:14,538
So we all started
yelling at him,

457
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,174
inzil, inzil, adyi faouk!"

458
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:21,311
Just telling him to get down
on the ground, y'know.

459
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:23,480
So he takes off his shirt,

460
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:25,248
and he shows us
he's wearing a vest

461
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,284
with a bomb on it.

462
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:30,487
And he's walking
towards us with this...

463
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:34,824
This stupid fucking
grin on his face.

464
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,726
And we're all screaming at him

465
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,595
and people are running
everywhere,

466
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:40,864
women, little kids.

467
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,465
But this guy...

468
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:46,803
Man this guy, he was
as cool as they come.

469
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,339
My sergeant, he's there,
he's yelling at me,

470
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:52,943
"take him down,
take him down!"

471
00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:54,978
Problem was,

472
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,981
I'd never actually
shot anyone before.

473
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,783
So obviously I was
shitting myself,

474
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:01,851
I had the shakes,
had the sweats,

475
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,420
all the usual things you get

476
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,822
when you've been told
to shoot a guy dead.

477
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,691
- Yeah.

478
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,526
- So they're still
barking at me,

479
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,928
telling me to shoot this guy.

480
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,464
And he's getting closer
and closer

481
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:17,801
with this stupid fucking grin.

482
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:20,403
So I'm lying there in the dirt,

483
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,907
looking at this bloke through
the scope of my gun,

484
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:28,345
and it suddenly dawns
on me that this guy,

485
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:31,481
he actually wants to die.

486
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,417
There you go.

487
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,792
- Sorry.
- Nah, that's alright.

488
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,861
- What happened to him?

489
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:48,498
- Yep, I killed him.

490
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,034
Through and through.

491
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:54,404
Big fucking mess.

492
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:59,609
But we found out later
he was crazy.

493
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,513
He'd just lost his wife
and his kid.

494
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,915
Didn't have a bomb on him.

495
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:09,352
Just wanted to get shot.

496
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:15,692
- Well...
What happened to you?

497
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,894
- Gave me a medal.

498
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,397
I went to Thailand.

499
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,732
Got hooked on smack.

500
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,401
I fucked a lot.

501
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:28,505
Forgot who I was
for about three years.

502
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:31,374
And I came back here,

503
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,011
I got clean,

504
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:36,579
and I built this place.

505
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,323
Anything else
you want to know?

506
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:52,762
This is the beginning
of your healing.

507
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,631
You understand?

508
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,099
- Yes, father.

509
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:56,099
- You?

510
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:59,669
- It's just I'm so fucking
exhausted I can...

511
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,371
What's the question again?

512
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:03,873
- You land on our doorstep
and expect us to rescue you,

513
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,776
you have to be prepared
to go the whole journey.

514
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:09,913
It's not enough for us
that you're not dead.

515
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:11,881
There's a few
very basic rules.

516
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,483
You eat what you're given,

517
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,085
you do the drills
without holding back

518
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:17,654
and you work with the others
in the community.

519
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:22,959
And you only talk about
what you feel to me or tom.

520
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,394
That clear?

521
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,830
- Yes, father.

522
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,833
- Yeah.

523
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,370
- Show us your strength.

524
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,039
- You've gotta be kidding me.

525
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,008
- Come on, you're weak.
- Shut up, Marcus.

526
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,008
- Hit it, Travis.

527
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,878
- Listen, I think that this is
getting a bit out of hand.

528
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,046
- Come on, Travis!
- Hit the bag!

529
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:43,980
- Just hit it!

530
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:43,980
- Just hit the bag, mate.

531
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:43,980
- Hit the bag!
- Hit the bag!

532
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:48,485
- Just hit the bag?
- Just hit the bag.

533
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:48,485
- Hit the bag.

534
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:51,087
- Hit the fucking bag.
- Hit it!

535
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,922
- Hit it!
- Hit the fucking bag.

536
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,624
- Hit the bag!
Just hit it!

537
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,760
- Hit the bag!
- Hit it, Travis!

538
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:59,829
- Hit the bag.
Come on, mate.

539
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,901
- I can't do it.

540
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,604
I'm not doing this.

541
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,075
- Go and get some rest, mate.

542
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,923
- I need something.

543
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,192
I'm really sick.

544
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:30,894
- Well how about a run?

545
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:34,197
- That wasn't what
i had in mind.

546
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,006
- To heal...

547
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,175
All my injuries.

548
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:51,448
To be safe.
To feel safe with myself.

549
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,984
- To love... everyone.

550
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,186
Equally.

551
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,924
- To find the joy in everything.

552
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:02,525
Even in pain.

553
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:05,528
- To be a protector
of the community.

554
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,865
- To be powerful.

555
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:13,036
- So that nothing and no one
can harm our community.

556
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:16,239
- This is the purpose
of my life.

557
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:18,508
- To touch people with music.

558
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,909
- To show them the way
out of their pain.

559
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,011
- Come on!

560
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,114
- To walk the red road
in peace.

561
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,266
- So what do you feel?

562
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:43,266
- I feel sick.

563
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:47,070
- That's because you're
sick on the inside.

564
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,105
That's what your
body's showing you.

565
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:51,608
You've been hiding
behind your addiction

566
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,110
and you've been
hurting yourself.

567
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:56,579
But these feelings, mate,
it's just the advertising,

568
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:57,814
it's just the wrapping, yeah?

569
00:41:57,816 --> 00:42:00,884
- I don't understand.
I don't understand.

570
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:02,085
I don't understand
what you're saying.

571
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:05,555
- Do you get it?
- No, I don't get it.

572
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,658
- It's your soul.

573
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,628
Do you get that?

574
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,832
Hey, do you get it,
do you fucking get it?

575
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,534
- I think so.

576
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:19,736
- Then say it.

577
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,771
- My soul.

578
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:24,841
- Your soul what?

579
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:28,311
- My soul is sick.

580
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:32,248
My soul is in pain.

581
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,797
- See that's the tradeoff.

582
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:52,201
Pain for freedom.

583
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:06,316
When I got back from Iraq,
i was a mess, man.

584
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:08,751
I was a fucking mess.

585
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:09,953
Thought I was gonna die soon,

586
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:12,689
so what's the point in living,
yeah?

587
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:14,958
Couldn't hold down
a relationship.

588
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,194
Couldn't feel any emotions.

589
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:19,829
And then one day,

590
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:22,999
I had a good look around
and I realized:

591
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:25,301
Holy fucking shit!

592
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:27,937
Everyone's doing
the same thing.

593
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,840
Everyone's terrified of
finding their own truth.

594
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:33,977
And even more shit-scared
of doing anything about it.

595
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:36,779
Yeah?

596
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,857
Come on in mate,
it is fucking beautiful.

597
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,360
Come on.

598
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,402
So how do you feel?

599
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,705
- I don't feel anything, really.

600
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:04,907
- Ah come on, hey

601
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:07,210
you're alive,
aren't you, man?

602
00:44:07,212 --> 00:44:08,945
Eh?

603
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:11,381
You alive now?
No?

604
00:44:11,383 --> 00:44:13,850
Okay, how about now?

605
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:15,084
How about now?

606
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:16,653
Now?

607
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:18,388
- Come on, come on, eh?
- What are you doing?

608
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,789
- What are you gonna
do about it, eh?

609
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:22,859
Eh? What are you
fucking afraid of?

610
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,868
What are you gonna
fucking do about it?

611
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:36,039
Come on, come on...

612
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:47,116
There you go!

613
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:48,951
Now is there anything
you want to say to me?

614
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:50,853
- Stay the fuck way from me!

615
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:53,222
- Yes!

616
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,066
- Come on trav,
wait up, mate.

617
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:04,901
- I don't want your
fucking help, okay?

618
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:07,070
- Okay.
You're free to go.

619
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:08,938
Take the old merc if you like,
it's nothing flash

620
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,473
but it'll get you where
you need to go.

621
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:12,842
Grab the keys will
you please, tom?

622
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:12,842
There's a map
in the glovebox,

623
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:15,144
just let us know
where you leave the car

624
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:17,447
when you get to town,
okay, Travis?

625
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:20,917
- Travis!
- What?

626
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:22,452
- The cars are this way, mate.

627
00:45:22,454 --> 00:45:25,455
- Fucking shit!

628
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:31,828
- Fuck!

629
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:35,298
- Just ah... give it
a bit more choke.

630
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,227
- Wait here.

631
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,149
Life crisis is
spirit crisis, trav.

632
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,185
Your doctors...

633
00:47:02,187 --> 00:47:03,586
Kept you away from
that knowing

634
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:06,856
because they didn't
want you looking in.

635
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:11,060
You're still right in the guts
of your addiction, mate.

636
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:34,917
- I don't know who
i am anymore.

637
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:37,486
I don't know how to live.

638
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:40,389
- That's why tom
brought you here.

639
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:45,127
Because right now there's
nothing holding you together.

640
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:48,064
But if you can feel your pain,

641
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:50,399
then you can feel
your real self.

642
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:53,002
Yeah?

643
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,006
Ask me.

644
00:47:57,008 --> 00:48:00,076
- Ask you what?
- You know.

645
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:07,183
- Help me.
- Mean it.

646
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,420
- Help me.
- Mean it.

647
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,091
- Help me.

648
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,361
Help me.

649
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,602
Help me.

650
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:33,142
- Like this?

651
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,445
Like this, huh?

652
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:38,514
Is this the game?
Huh?

653
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:40,516
Is this the game?
Hit the bag.

654
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:42,318
- Yes there's...
- There's the anger.

655
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,185
- The anger?

656
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:44,420
Yeah.
Fuck off!

657
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:45,621
- Chickenshit.

658
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:47,089
- I'm a chickenshit, am I?

659
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,958
I'm a chickenshit.
Huh?

660
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,259
Chickenshit, am I?

661
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:53,529
Is that... how's that
for fucking chickenshit?

662
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,598
Like that?

663
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,967
Get it!

664
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:04,640
- Violin's your
favorite isn't it, trav?

665
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:13,249
- Is this what you want?

666
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:18,721
Okay.

667
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,165
- Come on.

668
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,270
- Come on.

669
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,240
Come on.

670
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:40,376
- Come on, mate.
- Come on, mate.

671
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:41,510
- There's the anger,
come on.

672
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,446
- Kill the bag, Travis.
Kill the bag.

673
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:45,448
- Harder.
- Let it out mate, let it out.

674
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:48,117
- Travis, let yourself go, mate!
Come on!

675
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,618
- Come on, give it.

676
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,122
- Harder.
Harder. Harder...

677
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,793
- Die!

678
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:48,377
- Who are you angry with?

679
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,546
Huh?

680
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,061
Who are you angry with?

681
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,799
Who are you angry with?

682
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:12,168
Huh?

683
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:22,445
Who are you angry with?

684
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,353
- Hey.

685
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:33,556
- Hey.

686
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:35,691
- What are you taking?

687
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,563
- Just things are...

688
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:44,400
Starting to get on top of
me a little bit here and...

689
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:46,335
And it feels really heavy.

690
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:48,237
I come home and it feels
really heavy and I just,

691
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:51,774
I don't know where
to go and uh... it just...

692
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,209
It's all just fucking
stacking on top

693
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:55,678
of each other, you know?

694
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,713
- Okay...

695
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,620
Travis...

696
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:05,121
- What?

697
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:08,424
- I just want to help you, trav.

698
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:11,627
- You just want to help me?
- Yeah.

699
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,830
- You... want to help me?

700
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:23,439
Come on.

701
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:27,143
Oh my...

702
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,378
- Yeah, laugh, laugh,

703
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,281
you can't fucking talk,
though.

704
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,618
Oh, no, no, no.

705
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,853
No.
What the..F?

706
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,790
Open the door!

707
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:46,595
I know I'm fucked up
but at least I can feel!

708
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:48,330
You're such a kid.

709
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:51,333
You're such a kid
and you're scared, Travis!

710
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:55,237
Fuck!
Travis just look at me!

711
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,511
Talk to me!

712
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:07,750
You're fucked.

713
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:10,920
Completely fucked.

714
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,294
- Who do you want
to talk to?

715
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,830
- You're me.

716
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:24,767
- What do you want
to say to yourself?

717
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:34,410
- For as long as
i can remember...

718
00:53:34,412 --> 00:53:36,545
I've hated you.

719
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:41,517
You've always had
a special way of...

720
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:43,786
Fucking everything up.

721
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:48,424
- Travis it's...It's me,
again.

722
00:53:48,426 --> 00:53:50,693
You don't have to pick up.

723
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:52,595
I know you're listening,
though.

724
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:54,597
I hope you're listening.

725
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,765
- Tell me.

726
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:59,401
- You were always pretending.

727
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,971
You're a pretender.

728
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,440
- Oh god...

729
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:06,775
I knew you were a
frightened child.

730
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:09,278
I knew it
when I first met you.

731
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,647
It was okay,
cos, I thought that...

732
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:14,416
It doesn't matter
what I thought now,

733
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:17,286
really, does it?

734
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:22,591
It's so beautiful up here.

735
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:25,761
It's like the top of the world.

736
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,700
I can see everything.

737
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:11,940
- I've just been
trying to run away.

738
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:16,979
I've just been running
and running and running.

739
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,480
- Look at me.

740
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:21,517
- I don't want to look at you.

741
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:26,021
I'm so sick of looking at you.

742
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:31,093
I just... you make me sick.

743
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:36,031
And now somebody's
dead because of you.

744
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:39,902
Because of what you did.

745
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,473
- So what now?

746
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:50,579
- I just... I just want
to get rid of you.

747
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:54,083
I just... I don't want to
be filled with that hatred,

748
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:57,786
all the time.

749
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:02,658
- And when I'm gone.

750
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,060
What's left?

751
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,996
- I don't know...

752
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,037
Just nothing.

753
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,140
Just nothing.

754
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,544
- Good.

755
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:39,728
- Thank you.

756
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,030
Thank you.

757
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:44,433
- Welcome, brother.

758
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:45,968
- Thank you.

759
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:46,802
- Welcome, Travis.

760
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:48,103
- We love you, Travis.

761
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:50,672
- Welcome, Travis.

762
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,845
- Thank you.

763
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,617
Thank you.
Thank you.

764
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,165
Okay.

765
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,436
- I'm really glad
you're healing.

766
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:22,070
- Me too.

767
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,607
- It's important
for who you can be.

768
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,976
- Yeah.

769
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,514
- And who you can be with.

770
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:21,897
- To be a soldier of peace.

771
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:24,766
To stand by Jay's side.

772
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,270
To live in love.

773
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:31,540
This is the purpose
for my life.

774
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,943
- To find the joy in everything.

775
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:37,212
Even in pain.

776
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:41,183
That is the purpose
of my life.

777
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,519
- To touch people with music.

778
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:44,753
To show them
there's meaning

779
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:47,155
and take them out
of their pain.

780
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,026
- To share myself.

781
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:53,962
And only this.

782
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:56,999
This is the purpose
of my life.

783
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:03,639
- To forgive those
who tarnished me.

784
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:06,909
To forgive myself.

785
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:11,280
This is the purpose my soul
has chosen for my life.

786
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:16,585
- I think that I always
wanted to heal people.

787
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:20,722
And somewhere along
the way, I forgot that.

788
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,324
But yeah, I think...

789
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:25,994
That's the purpose of my life.

790
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,039
How's it look?

791
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:39,641
- Trust me.

792
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:41,276
It looks good.

793
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,845
- Okay.

794
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,668
- You need to be exposed
to what he did to you,

795
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,069
and how you feel about it.

796
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:16,138
Do you understand?

797
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:20,942
You have to feel your pain.

798
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:23,345
That's the grief
of letting go.

799
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:27,082
And then it won't
affect you anymore.

800
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:41,363
Now you're connected
to your pain,

801
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,932
you can look out
from yourself.

802
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:45,834
And now you can be with
that special someone

803
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:48,704
whose soul feels
the same as yours.

804
01:01:48,706 --> 01:01:50,439
- Thank you, Jay.

805
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:41,449
- Hey.

806
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,385
- Hey.

807
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,922
- How you doing?

808
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:49,224
- Yeah.

809
01:03:49,226 --> 01:03:52,594
You learn so much, right?

810
01:03:52,596 --> 01:03:53,929
I mean,
I'm only starting to see

811
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:56,431
how far away
from myself I was.

812
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:59,034
You've been working
really hard too.

813
01:03:59,036 --> 01:04:01,870
I think we're at that point
where we're gonna start

814
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:05,407
breaking away from ourselves.

815
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,210
- So you're feeling like you--
- it's like a calling, isn't it?

816
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:12,414
- Once you start you
just gotta keep on going.

817
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:14,616
I've been so stupid.

818
01:04:14,618 --> 01:04:16,251
- I don't think that
you're stupid--

819
01:04:16,253 --> 01:04:20,255
- no. It's okay.
I know.

820
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:24,125
Trying to get people
in the city to like me...

821
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:29,364
Y'know, I was never be
good at being that person.

822
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:31,199
Neither were you.

823
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,401
Right?

824
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,637
- Right.

825
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,580
I went swimming
in the lake today.

826
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,884
And I took a long
walk in the woods.

827
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:51,219
- Mm, it's beautiful there.

828
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:54,022
This whole place is beautiful.

829
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:56,925
You don't know how
disconnected you are

830
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:59,561
until somebody shows you.

831
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,132
Letting go of that person...

832
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:07,068
I'm excited.

833
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,138
I'm really excited.

834
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:13,642
- I saw you and Jay
in the woods.

835
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:24,686
- No, you didn't.

836
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:28,657
- Marcus.

837
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:16,471
- Travis.

838
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:19,341
- I need to be by
myself for a bit.

839
01:06:19,343 --> 01:06:22,243
- You don't have to pretend.

840
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,180
- What do you mean?

841
01:06:25,182 --> 01:06:29,150
- I know you wanted me
to follow you down here.

842
01:06:58,547 --> 01:06:59,948
- Okay, just wait.

843
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:00,615
Wait a minute.

844
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:02,083
- It's alright.

845
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:04,185
- It's not alright.

846
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,721
- You're free now.

847
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,091
We can be together.

848
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:15,597
We're like two drops
out of the ocean.

849
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:21,669
- You need to stop
talking like that.

850
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:26,207
It's not right.

851
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:29,811
None of this is right.

852
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:41,689
- After everything
we've done for you.

853
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:47,262
You haven't got the courage.

854
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:37,212
- Alright thank you very much

855
01:08:37,214 --> 01:08:39,747
ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.

856
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:42,283
If I could have your
attention please.

857
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:45,253
Tonight is a very
special night,

858
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:47,188
as we celebrate
Marcus's victory

859
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:50,825
after a long,
hard-fought battle.

860
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:05,173
Now Marcus has had to
overcome a lot of obstacles,

861
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:07,142
- a lot of demons.
- Marcus...

862
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:10,345
- But with love,
we can heal.

863
01:09:10,347 --> 01:09:11,479
Can't we?

864
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:11,479
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

865
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:15,683
- It's one thing to
sit there and say...
- It's time to go.

866
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:17,819
- I feel pain.

867
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:20,321
But it's another thing entirely
to get off your butt

868
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,924
and do something about it,
isn't it?

869
01:09:22,926 --> 01:09:24,259
You see pain
isn't the enemy.

870
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:25,693
- This isn't right.
- Yeah, it is.

871
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:27,428
- This is right.
This is where I belong.

872
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:30,398
- If you come with me
i can get you some help.

873
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,200
- Marcus is getting
all the help he needs,

874
01:09:32,202 --> 01:09:34,869
he was very courageous today.

875
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:37,338
- Is that what you were doing?

876
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,807
You force him
to have sex with you

877
01:09:39,809 --> 01:09:41,643
and you call it...
You call it helping?

878
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:43,211
- I didn't do that.

879
01:09:43,213 --> 01:09:44,812
- I saw you.

880
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:47,649
- I didn't do that, Travis.

881
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:51,252
- Well I want to hear it
from Marcus.

882
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:54,956
Marcus, did you want that?

883
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,758
- Yeah, I think you might
be a little confused

884
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,927
as to what you saw today.

885
01:09:58,929 --> 01:10:01,396
Right, if I hadn't pushed Marcus
into some sort of action

886
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:03,298
we would have lost him
forever into his own fear,

887
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,366
and I won't apologize for that.

888
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:07,669
I will never apologize
for taking drastic action

889
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:07,669
to heal someone.

890
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:11,206
- You drag him here,
he's got nobody,

891
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,441
nothing else and...

892
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:15,577
And now that he
depends on you,

893
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:16,978
you pull him apart.

894
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,214
- You see,
therapists like Travis,

895
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:21,316
they call this transference.

896
01:10:21,318 --> 01:10:23,484
Travis is putting his
problems onto me

897
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:26,554
because he can't
face them himself.

898
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,523
You're still just a
scared little boy,

899
01:10:28,525 --> 01:10:31,292
desperately seeking the
attention of his dad, aren't ya?

900
01:10:31,294 --> 01:10:33,228
- This isn't about me.

901
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,430
- And now we're
seeing the real you.

902
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:37,832
See, you so badly want the
love that you can never have

903
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:39,968
but the bad news is...

904
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:43,671
You've got to have courage
to love, Travis.

905
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:46,975
You're the one with
the disorder, mate.

906
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:51,980
- Marcus, this is supposed to
be a beautiful night for you.

907
01:10:51,982 --> 01:10:54,015
Do you feel good?
Does it feel nice?

908
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:55,917
- Don't ruin this for me.

909
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,820
- You've got to get out of here!

910
01:10:58,822 --> 01:11:01,990
How many of you know
what's going on?

911
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:01,990
How many has it happened to?

912
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:06,594
Excuse me, is anyone else
here feeling anger?

913
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:09,464
- Yeah, who's angry
with this filthy liar?

914
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:12,867
- Hey come on, be honest.
Be honest.

915
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:16,871
You see this is the classic
example of a sociopath.

916
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:21,643
He's dead to himself,
so he'll use you instead.

917
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:25,813
He'll say that he feels exactly
what you want him to feel,

918
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:28,316
but it's all selfishness.

919
01:11:28,318 --> 01:11:33,655
He lies...
Doesn't feel a thing.

920
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:39,027
- Jay, did you really do that?

921
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,599
Marcus?

922
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:44,999
Marcus!

923
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:47,902
- Oh look, get this weak
creature out of here.

924
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:47,902
Look, I don't know
about you guys

925
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:50,505
but I can't stand to
look at him anymore.

926
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:51,906
- Tom, how can you
stand by, huh?

927
01:11:51,908 --> 01:11:53,608
How can you stand back
here, man?

928
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:54,809
How can you stand back?

929
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,744
How can any of you
let this happen?

930
01:11:56,746 --> 01:11:59,914
How can any of
you let it happen?!

931
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:04,986
- Travis is feeling a lot of
jealousy at the moment.

932
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:06,654
A lot of pain.

933
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:10,358
But tonight is
not about Travis...

934
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,394
- What are you doing... please!
- Tonight's about Marcus.

935
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,831
- It's about his bravery.

936
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,399
It's about his courage.

937
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:19,901
It's about his commitment.

938
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:28,810
You're a very brave man,
Marcus, look at me, mate.

939
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:31,846
You're a very,
very, brave man.

940
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:36,684
And we welcome you aboard
the farm community.

941
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,720
We all love you, mate.

942
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,924
- Well done, Marcus.

943
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:15,390
- What the fuck is going on?

944
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:18,159
- You're leaving.
Now.

945
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,295
Come on.

946
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,735
- Tom...
- Don't...

947
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:30,505
- Don't say anything.

948
01:13:30,507 --> 01:13:31,873
- Brother, come on...

949
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:34,642
- You're not my
brother anymore.

950
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:37,512
You don't exist.

951
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:59,567
- Tom!

952
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:04,939
- Please?

953
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,642
- Tom--
- shut up.

954
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,678
- Come on.

955
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:15,783
- Thank you.

956
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:18,119
Thank you.

957
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:29,964
- Grace!

958
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,034
Grace!

959
01:14:33,036 --> 01:14:34,569
- Oh Jesus...

960
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,174
- Tom, just keep driving!

961
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:41,542
- Put the gun down, Marcus.

962
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:42,777
- No...

963
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:44,979
- Come on!
- Start the car, tom!

964
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,048
- I'm ordering you
to drop the weapon,

965
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:50,051
do it now!

966
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:53,488
- You lied to me.

967
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,957
You lied to me!!

968
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:58,559
- You're not seeing
things clearly, mate.

969
01:14:58,561 --> 01:15:01,963
Your pain is making
you lose your way.

970
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:03,531
Is that what you really want?

971
01:15:03,533 --> 01:15:05,500
- Liar!!

972
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:07,034
- Marcus.

973
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:08,936
- I love you, Marcus.

974
01:15:08,938 --> 01:15:10,171
- No!

975
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:12,807
Jay! No!

976
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:14,609
No!

977
01:15:14,611 --> 01:15:17,211
No... no!

978
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:18,579
No!

979
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:19,647
No!

980
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:22,984
- He's al...
He's alright.

981
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:24,952
- Marcus!
- He's alright!

982
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:24,952
- Someone help him!

983
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:29,257
- No, he's alright,
i said, stay the fuck away!

984
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:32,093
- Help him!
- No, I said he's okay!

985
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:35,229
- Marcus... Marcus.

986
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:38,733
This isn't what
you wanted, is it?

987
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,268
Let me hear you say it.

988
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:41,536
Marcus,
let me hear you say it,

989
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:44,071
this isn't what you wanted.

990
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,774
- This isn't what I wanted.

991
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:50,978
- I know that.
Marcus.

992
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,880
I know that this is hard.

993
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,015
But it's going to be okay.

994
01:15:54,017 --> 01:15:55,316
Marcus, look at me.

995
01:15:55,318 --> 01:15:59,220
Marcus,
it's going to be okay.

996
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:01,155
It's gonna be okay,
let me hear you say it.

997
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:01,155
Let me hear you say

998
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:01,155
- it's gonna be okay.
- It's gonna be okay.

999
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:06,093
- That's it Marcus,
it's gonna be okay.

1000
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:08,029
It's gonna be okay.

1001
01:16:08,031 --> 01:16:10,031
Marcus. Marcus.

1002
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:12,333
- It's gonna be okay.
- It's gonna be okay.

1003
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:16,938
- It's gonna be okay.
- It's gonna be okay...

1004
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,739
- Marcus.

1005
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:20,908
Marcus?

1006
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,277
Listen to my voice, Marcus.

1007
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:25,746
Look at me.

1008
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,915
Marcus...

1009
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:31,085
Give me the gun, Marcus.

1010
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,321
Marcus.

1011
01:16:33,323 --> 01:16:36,857
- This... is me
showing my pain.

1012
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:39,327
- Marcus. No!

1013
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,915
- Here... no, I can help him.
- Keep away from him!

1014
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:04,218
- I can help him,
i can help him!

1015
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:09,657
Don't move him,
don't move him.

1016
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:09,657
You don't want to move him.

1017
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:14,795
Tom, let me help him, you
don't want to move him!

1018
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:17,932
Tom, just let me help him.

1019
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:41,689
- I can't stop the bleeding.

1020
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:42,356
- Please, I'm a doctor
if you just--

1021
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:43,958
- shut your fucking mouth.

1022
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:47,695
- Toby if he can help...
- No! Don't let him.

1023
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:50,665
- Travis, get down here.

1024
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:03,177
- Someone really
needs to look at this.

1025
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:03,177
- Could you do it.

1026
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:06,113
- I can't...I don...
I don't have the equipment

1027
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:08,849
and someone needs
to look at this now.

1028
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,184
- No.
- No.

1029
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:13,220
- Please Jay,
just let us help you.

1030
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:17,992
- I've seen what it's like
when you're near the end.

1031
01:18:17,994 --> 01:18:21,162
I'm not afraid of it.

1032
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:25,099
The ones who ran...

1033
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:28,736
They'll go straight
to the police.

1034
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:31,272
That's alright...

1035
01:18:31,274 --> 01:18:34,408
They'll have to live their days
knowing that they ran.

1036
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,410
- If we tell the police
what happened then--

1037
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:38,813
- no.

1038
01:18:38,815 --> 01:18:41,315
You know what they'll do.

1039
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:45,419
They don't need an excuse.

1040
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:48,756
We've been betrayed.

1041
01:18:48,758 --> 01:18:53,494
Travis's pain has caused this.

1042
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:58,099
They'll be here soon.

1043
01:18:58,101 --> 01:19:03,771
With their anger
and their threats.

1044
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:07,408
We'd better not be here
when they come.

1045
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,914
- We love you, Jay.

1046
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,985
- We love you, Jay.
- We love you, Jay.

1047
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,521
- We love you, Jay.
- We love you, Jay.

1048
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,958
- We love you, Jay.
- We love you, Jay.

1049
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:39,540
- Tom, don't do this...

1050
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:06,467
- No!

1051
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,917
- Get out.

1052
01:20:22,919 --> 01:20:24,451
Get out, come on.

1053
01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:27,154
Now!

1054
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:32,993
- To be myself.

1055
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:36,430
- To find truth.

1056
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:38,999
- To be a mother.

1057
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:42,369
I always wanted
to be a mother.

1058
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:45,206
- To fall in love.

1059
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:47,074
- To be free.

1060
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:49,577
To be truly free.

1061
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:57,484
- Tom.
- Don't turn around.

1062
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:00,955
- Stop.

1063
01:21:10,967 --> 01:21:13,234
I'm sorry.

1064
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:37,558
The road about three
kilometers that way, just go.

1065
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,394
- Tom, what's happening?

1066
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:43,230
- There's nothing left.

1067
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:46,901
Just go.

1068
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:27,074
- Oh fuck... oh fuck...

1069
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:30,110
Oh fuck... oh fuck...

1070
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:34,281
Oh fuck... oh fuck...

1071
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:37,351
Oh fuck... oh fuck...

1072
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:50,084
- I love you, Jay.

1073
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:53,253
- I fucking love you too,
Andy.

1074
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,690
See you on the other side,
my brother.

1075
01:24:57,692 --> 01:25:00,594
I love you too, Ben.

1076
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:03,564
See you on the other side.

1077
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:10,270
So much love.

1078
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:17,411
What would you like to say?

1079
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:21,448
- Sorry Jay.

1080
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:25,519
I couldn't do it...

1081
01:25:25,521 --> 01:25:30,457
But... I'm going to make
it up to you, I will I...

1082
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:31,892
I'm ready to show
them the agony that

1083
01:25:31,894 --> 01:25:35,329
I can see in their hearts.

1084
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:41,702
In the land of the blind
the one eyed girl is queen.

1085
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:50,244
I love you, Jay.

1086
01:26:20,876 --> 01:26:23,443
- Come on.
Come on.

1087
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:40,761
- I want people to know
that you... you can be real.

1088
01:26:40,763 --> 01:26:43,931
We really had something here.

1089
01:26:43,933 --> 01:26:47,434
We had it in the
palm of our hand.

1090
01:27:01,282 --> 01:27:03,684
- We live the right way.

1091
01:27:03,686 --> 01:27:04,885
The way we're meant to live.

1092
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:07,955
Just open your eyes,
people.

1093
01:27:07,957 --> 01:27:09,823
- And everyone 'neath
the vine and fig tree

1094
01:27:09,825 --> 01:27:12,459
shall live in peace...

1095
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:46,927
- Drinking to you, Jay.

1096
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:05,812
- I love you, Jay...

1097
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:16,723
- The train on platform number
seven goes to creston...

1098
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,730
Please stand clear.

1099
01:28:23,732 --> 01:28:25,565
Doors closing.

1100
01:28:25,567 --> 01:28:27,734
Attention passengers.

1101
01:28:27,736 --> 01:28:32,039
This train is an
express train to... creston.

1102
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:35,642
This train's first stop
will be creston.

1103
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:14,348
- Excuse me.

1104
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:17,651
Would you like to ask a
question with me, ma'am?

1105
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:19,920
How about you, sir,

1106
01:29:19,922 --> 01:29:23,757
would you like to ask
a question with me?

1107
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:29,629
Uh... everybody...

1108
01:29:29,631 --> 01:29:31,431
Look I know you've
been ignoring me,

1109
01:29:31,433 --> 01:29:34,501
but today's a
really special day.

1110
01:29:34,503 --> 01:29:34,501
Today you're going
to learn about

1111
01:29:34,503 --> 01:29:38,004
the kind of life you've led
and um...

1112
01:29:38,006 --> 01:29:42,042
And the impact that life
has had on other people.

1113
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:46,646
Today you're going to learn
the purpose of your life.

1114
01:29:46,648 --> 01:29:49,516
- Ah, to not listen to any more
street preacher bullshit?

1115
01:29:49,518 --> 01:29:51,718
I reckon that's the
purpose of my life.

1116
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,154
Thanks for sharing.

1117
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:57,657
- I believe that our ignorance
and our blindness

1118
01:29:57,659 --> 01:30:00,994
have made this
world unlivable.

1119
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:09,903
- Jesus!

1120
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:12,139
- She's got a gun.

1121
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:26,052
- Jay taught us to see the
pain of the injuries inside us.

1122
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:30,724
And he taught us to see
the enemies within us.

1123
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:32,793
He was made to kill people

1124
01:30:32,795 --> 01:30:35,896
in a false
and unjust war and...

1125
01:30:35,898 --> 01:30:38,532
It damaged him deeply but...
But he returned home

1126
01:30:38,534 --> 01:30:41,735
to make a world of peace
for everyone and...

1127
01:30:41,737 --> 01:30:43,904
He believed that our pain
is within ourselves and...

1128
01:30:43,906 --> 01:30:45,172
That we need to
release that pain

1129
01:30:45,174 --> 01:30:47,841
to give ourselves the gift...

1130
01:30:47,843 --> 01:30:51,144
To give ourselves
the gift of freedom.

1131
01:30:51,146 --> 01:30:52,612
Do you understand that?

1132
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:54,014
- Yes.

1133
01:30:54,016 --> 01:30:55,682
- I said,
can you understand that?

1134
01:30:55,684 --> 01:30:57,851
- Yes.

1135
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:07,861
- Okay I'm going to give
you all a brochure and...

1136
01:31:07,863 --> 01:31:09,563
And...

1137
01:31:09,565 --> 01:31:10,831
And you'll notice
that on the inside

1138
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:13,567
there are some lyrics
to a song.

1139
01:31:15,703 --> 01:31:18,538
Sorry if I don't have
enough for everyone.

1140
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:19,706
If you don't get one
you can just look on

1141
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:21,942
with your neighbor.

1142
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:26,580
One... two... three.

1143
01:31:26,582 --> 01:31:31,151
- And everyone neath
their vine and fig tree...

1144
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:33,987
- Stop!

1145
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,590
You need to do it louder.

1146
01:31:36,592 --> 01:31:38,225
Okay?

1147
01:31:38,227 --> 01:31:42,929
- And everyone neath
their Vince and fig tree,

1148
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:48,001
shall live in peace
and unafraid.

1149
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:52,973
And everyone neath
their vine and fig tree,

1150
01:31:52,975 --> 01:31:58,745
shall live in peace
and unafraid.

1151
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:06,820
And into ploughshares
turn their swords,

1152
01:32:06,822 --> 01:32:11,291
nations shall learn
war no more.

1153
01:32:11,293 --> 01:32:16,630
And into ploughshares
turn their swords,

1154
01:32:16,632 --> 01:32:18,632
nations...

1155
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:29,709
- Attention passengers.

1156
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:32,279
Please remain seated.

1157
01:32:32,281 --> 01:32:33,280
- It's okay.

1158
01:32:33,282 --> 01:32:34,981
- We apologize for the delay.

1159
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:36,216
- What are you doing?

1160
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:38,919
- I was looking for you.

1161
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:41,655
- Jay's gone.

1162
01:32:41,657 --> 01:32:43,123
- I know.

1163
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:45,058
I'm sorry.

1164
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:47,627
- I need to make them
understand.

1165
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:49,262
- We do, don't we?
Just keep the gun on me.

1166
01:32:49,264 --> 01:32:52,065
Everyone listen to what
grace is telling you!

1167
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:56,069
She's giving you a chance
to learn the truth.

1168
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:59,673
Is that right, grace?
Is that what w're doing?

1169
01:32:59,675 --> 01:33:01,641
- Stop!

1170
01:33:01,643 --> 01:33:04,077
Just stop lying!

1171
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:06,613
You don't believe in anything.

1172
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:07,781
Jay died trying to save you

1173
01:33:07,783 --> 01:33:12,052
and every single person
in this world.

1174
01:33:12,054 --> 01:33:13,920
He loved too much.

1175
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:15,155
- No, he didn't.

1176
01:33:15,157 --> 01:33:17,357
- Yes, he did.
- No, he didn't.

1177
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:19,259
- I wasn't strong enough.

1178
01:33:19,261 --> 01:33:22,596
I'm not strong enough.

1179
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:27,968
- Do you remember
meeting me on this train?

1180
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:32,038
I'd be dead
if it wasn't for you.

1181
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:35,108
I was in so much pain, grace.

1182
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:36,142
I did something wrong,

1183
01:33:36,144 --> 01:33:39,813
I did something
really wrong.

1184
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:42,882
I caused so much damage.

1185
01:33:42,884 --> 01:33:45,185
And I was so scared.

1186
01:33:45,187 --> 01:33:46,920
Just like you are.

1187
01:33:46,922 --> 01:33:50,256
I didn't want to live anymore.

1188
01:33:50,258 --> 01:33:54,394
But you never gave up
on me, did you?

1189
01:33:54,396 --> 01:33:57,330
- Everyone's gone.

1190
01:33:58,399 --> 01:33:59,833
Tom.

1191
01:33:59,835 --> 01:34:01,267
Marcus, my mum.

1192
01:34:01,269 --> 01:34:02,335
- I know,

1193
01:34:02,337 --> 01:34:04,237
but they're not brave like you.

1194
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:06,873
- I just want to be
with the others now.

1195
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:09,876
- You want to be with them.
- Yeah.

1196
01:34:09,878 --> 01:34:12,746
- You want to be with them?

1197
01:34:12,748 --> 01:34:15,715
Okay.
Okay well let's do it.

1198
01:34:15,717 --> 01:34:15,715
Let's do it.

1199
01:34:15,717 --> 01:34:18,752
Shoot me
and then shoot yourself

1200
01:34:18,754 --> 01:34:20,086
but I think that you
should do it quickly

1201
01:34:20,088 --> 01:34:24,357
because you are really
scaring these people.

1202
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:27,727
Do it.

1203
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:33,833
You were right.

1204
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:37,337
We're like two drops
out of the ocean

1205
01:34:37,339 --> 01:34:40,840
and I'm really glad
i met you.

1206
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:42,842
So do it.

1207
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:45,378
Shoot me.

1208
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:48,381
Do it!

1209
01:34:54,088 --> 01:34:57,090
- I don't want to.

1210
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,368
I don't want to be like them.

1211
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:10,170
- You're not.

1212
01:35:10,172 --> 01:35:13,973
You're not like anyone
I've ever met.

1213
01:35:17,244 --> 01:35:19,979
It's okay.

1214
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:22,449
It's okay.

1215
01:35:22,451 --> 01:35:25,018
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1216
01:35:28,923 --> 01:35:31,458
- We just have to
keep being brave.

1217
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:35,995
Okay?
We just keep being brave.

1218
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:40,433
- I'm sorry.

1219
01:35:40,435 --> 01:35:43,002
- I think you should
tell them that.

1220
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,049
- I'm sorry.

1221
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:07,494
- We're really sorry,
everyone.

1222
01:36:07,496 --> 01:36:11,097
We'll just wait now
for the police to come.

1223
01:36:19,206 --> 01:36:21,808
There's no bullets
in the gun.

1224
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:24,978
Everyone's going to be okay.

1225
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:27,547
Everything's going to be okay.

1226
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:58,878
- For as long as
i can remember,

1227
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,581
I've hated you.

1228
01:37:01,583 --> 01:37:03,983
You've always had
a special way

1229
01:37:03,985 --> 01:37:07,554
of fucking everything up.

1230
01:37:07,556 --> 01:37:10,523
- It's so beautiful up here.

1231
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:14,561
It's like the top of the world.

1232
01:37:15,196 --> 01:37:18,331
I can see everything.

1233
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:24,137
- You're always pretending.

1234
01:37:24,139 --> 01:37:27,006
You're a pretender.

1235
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:38,985
Pretending to care.

1236
01:37:40,054 --> 01:37:44,457
Pretending to be
a good person.

1237
01:37:57,004 --> 01:38:02,075
But when it really
comes down to it...

1238
01:38:02,077 --> 01:38:05,979
You're just a frightened child.

1239
01:38:12,186 --> 01:38:15,321
- It's so beautiful up here.

1240
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:18,458
It's like the top of the world.

1241
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:21,494
I can see everything.

1242
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:27,634
I guess that's it.

1243
01:38:27,636 --> 01:38:29,669
You're really not coming,
are you?

1244
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:20,153
- It just feels like
a bad dream.

1245
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:23,990
And every morning on
the farm we'd wake up

1246
01:39:23,992 --> 01:39:25,992
and tell each other how
much we loved our world

1247
01:39:25,994 --> 01:39:28,561
and everyone in it.

1248
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:32,732
And we were loved.

1249
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:40,373
But they all left... and...

1250
01:39:40,375 --> 01:39:43,710
I didn't want to stay but I...
I didn't know what to do.

1251
01:39:43,712 --> 01:39:47,447
- And you chose not to
go with the others?

1252
01:39:49,583 --> 01:39:51,584
- I know one person can
do something so brave

1253
01:39:51,586 --> 01:39:55,021
that they can fix their soul.

1254
01:39:57,257 --> 01:40:00,326
Otherwise what's the point?

1255
01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:12,271
Can I go now?

1256
01:40:13,305 --> 01:41:13,697
