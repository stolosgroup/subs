2
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,876
- Here we go, Nick.
- All right

3
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,746
- Good morning, Detective.
- I want a shot of the two detectives.

4
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:39,836
Keep it back, folks.

5
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,846
- Howdy.
- Morning.

6
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:46,415
Up there.

7
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:52,855
- How's it going, Gus?
- Morning, Pete.

8
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:57,325
- Who was this fucking guy?
- Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.

9
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:59,525
- Never heard of him.
- Before your time, cowboy.

10
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:01,935
- Hey, Ronny, where they hiding?
- Upstairs, to the right.

11
00:05:02,065 --> 00:05:05,564
Mid '60s, had five or six hits.
Got a club down on Fillmore now.

12
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:07,294
Not now, he don't.

13
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,904
Do we have a time
of death? Almost.

14
00:05:11,074 --> 00:05:13,444
- Do you guys know Captain Tallcott?
- Sure.

15
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:16,774
- What's the Chief's office doing here?
- Observing.

16
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:22,774
- What's it say, Doc? - Ninety-two
degrees. About six hours.

17
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:25,414
Puts time of death
at around 2:00 a. m.

18
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:28,823
Can somebody close
the drapes over there?

19
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:31,523
Maid came in about an hour
ago and found the body.

20
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:33,933
- She's not a live-in.
- Maybe the maid did it.

21
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:36,533
She's 54 years old
and weighs 240 pounds.

22
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:39,063
- No bruises on the body.
- It ain't the maid.

23
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:40,533
Never know.

24
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:45,813
Sorry.

25
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:49,403
He was last seen leaving the club
with his girlfriend about midnight.

26
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:53,312
- What was it?
- Ice pick. Left it in the living room.

27
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:58,852
There's come stains
all over the sheets.

28
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,892
- Very impressive.
- He got off before he got off.

29
00:06:10,102 --> 00:06:12,032
Gentlemen, this is sensitive.

30
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,801
Mr. Boz was a major contributor
to the mayor's campaign.

31
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,361
He was chairman of the board
of the Palace of Fine Arts.

32
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:19,411
I thought he was a
rock and roll star.

33
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:21,501
He was a retired
rock and roll star.

34
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,841
A civic-minded, very
respectable rock and roll star.

35
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:27,441
Then, what's that over there?

36
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:32,851
Looks like civic-minded,
very respectable cocaine.

37
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,290
Listen to me, Curran. I'm
gonna get a lot of heat on this.

38
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,290
I don't want any mistakes.

39
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,700
What's Boz's girl
friend's name?

40
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,860
"Catherine Tramell,
162 Divisadero."

41
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,579
- Always a pleasure, Captain.
- He's up bright and early.

42
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:05,709
He doesn't usually punch
in 'til after his 18 holes.

43
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,289
Johnny and the mayor
must have been very tight.

44
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:10,694
Nick, keep your 3:00.

45
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:12,589
You want me to
work the case...

46
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,419
- I said, keep it!
- All right.

47
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,289
I'll keep it.

48
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:51,687
Good morning. I'm Detective
Curran. This is Detective Moran.

49
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:56,397
San Francisco Police Department. I'd
like to speak to Catherine Tramell.

50
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,667
Come in.

51
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:07,747
Sit, please. Just a moment.

52
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:17,346
Ain't that cute? They got
his and hers Picasso's.

53
00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:20,716
- I didn't know you knew a Picasso.
- Sure I do. It says right here.

54
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:22,746
Hers is bigger.

55
00:08:33,575 --> 00:08:36,635
Sorry to bother you. We just
got a couple of questions.

56
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:39,435
- Are you vice?
- No, we're homicide.

57
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,275
What do you want?

58
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:43,815
When was the last
time you saw John Boz?

59
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:46,645
Is he dead?

60
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:49,755
Why do you think he's dead?

61
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:52,485
Well, you wouldn't be
here otherwise, would you?

62
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:54,715
Were you with him last night?

63
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:59,324
You're looking for
Catherine, not me.

64
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:03,594
- Who are you?
- I'm Roxy.

65
00:09:05,564 --> 00:09:07,664
I'm her friend.

66
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:14,474
Well, Roxy, do you know
where your friend is?

67
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:20,773
She's out at the beach house
at Stenson. Seadrift 1402.

68
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,343
Thanks.

69
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:27,353
You're wasting your time.

70
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:32,353
Catherine didn't kill him.

71
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,590
Miss Tramell?

72
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,519
Good afternoon. I'm Detective
Curran. This is Detective Moran.

73
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:11,749
- We're with the San Francisco Police...
- I know who you are.

74
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:15,818
So, how did he die?

75
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:17,388
He was murdered.

76
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,828
Obviously.

77
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:22,458
- How was he murdered?
- With an ice pick.

78
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:28,808
How long were you dating him?

79
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:32,828
I wasn't dating him.
I was fucking him.

80
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:36,738
What are you, a pro?

81
00:11:38,377 --> 00:11:39,607
No, I'm an amateur.

82
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,877
How long were you
having sex with him?

83
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:44,787
About a year and a half.

84
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:47,417
- Were you with him last night?
- Yes.

85
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,617
Did you leave
the club with him?

86
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:51,287
- Yes.
- Did you go home with him?

87
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:55,297
No. We had a drink at the
club. We left together.

88
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:57,297
He went home, and
I came out here.

89
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:59,497
Was there anyone
with you last night?

90
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:02,796
No. I wasn't in
the mood last night.

91
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:14,576
Let me ask you
something, Miss Tramell.

92
00:12:14,616 --> 00:12:16,776
Are you sorry he's dead?

93
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:18,816
Yeah.

94
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:21,416
I liked fucking him.

95
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:28,855
Look, I don't really
feel like talking anymore.

96
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:33,335
Listen, lady, we can do
this downtown, if you want.

97
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:35,425
So read me my rights
and arrest me...

98
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,665
and then I'll go downtown.

99
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:45,475
Otherwise, get the
fuck out of here.

100
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:54,574
Please.

101
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:20,003
Nice girl.

102
00:13:35,822 --> 00:13:39,062
I'm sorry, Beth. I
got hung up in Stenson.

103
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:44,762
- How are you, Nick?
- I'm fine.

104
00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:47,772
Come on, Beth. You know I'm fine. How
long do we have to keep doing this?

105
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:50,832
As long as Internal Affairs
wants you to, I suppose.

106
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,862
- Have a seat.
- It's bullshit. You know it is.

107
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:58,031
I know it is. But sit down, anyway,
so we can get it over with, okay?

108
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:08,751
So, how are things?

109
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,756
Things are fine.

110
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,661
I told you, all
right? Things are fine.

111
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:16,631
How is your personal life?

112
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:18,661
My sex life is fine.

113
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,670
My sex life is actually pretty
shitty since I stopped seeing you.

114
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,540
I started developing calluses.

115
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,550
Sorry.

116
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,880
How's the booze?

117
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,520
Haven't had a drink
in three months.

118
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,689
- What about the coke?
- No.

119
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,859
No. I'm working my ass
off. I'm off the sauce.

120
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:52,019
I even stopped smoking.

121
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:54,729
How is not smoking?

122
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,789
It sucks.

123
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:00,869
Now, will you tell I.A.
I'm just your average...

124
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,824
healthy, totally
fucked up cop...

125
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:06,568
and let me out
of here, please?

126
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:15,248
Yes.

127
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:17,278
Thank you.

128
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,058
I still miss you, Nick.

129
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:38,807
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

130
00:15:40,577 --> 00:15:42,847
Tallcott's in there. They're
waiting. How did it go?

131
00:15:43,017 --> 00:15:44,747
She misses me.

132
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:47,787
Boy, when that girl
mates, it's for life.

133
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:50,047
All right, let's
start. Harrigan.

134
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:52,557
Well, we got 31 stab
wounds, neck and the chest.

135
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:55,286
No usable prints, no forceable
entry, nothing missing.

136
00:15:55,326 --> 00:15:58,816
No prints on the ice pick, either.
You can pick it up at any K-Mart.

137
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:01,866
The scarf was Hermes.
It's expensive.

138
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:05,026
They sell about 20,000
a year, worldwide.

139
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:09,066
Bottle was cocaine. High quality,
high content. He inhaled it.

140
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:12,296
There were minute quantities
on his lips and penis.

141
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:14,306
Mr. Boz leaves $5 million.

142
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:17,345
No direct survivors.
No criminal record.

143
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:20,675
He liked his drugs. He liked his
girls. He liked his rock and roll.

144
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:22,375
He liked the mayor too, right?

145
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:29,845
What about his girlfriend?

146
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:33,055
- Is she relevant here? Is she a suspect?
- She's a suspect.

147
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:34,665
On what basis?

148
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:37,825
"Girlfriend: Catherine Tramell.
Age 30. No priors. No convictions.

149
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:40,394
Magna cum laude
at Berkeley, 1983.

150
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:43,074
Double major: Literature
and psychology.

151
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:45,704
Daughter, sole survivor,
Marvin and Elaine Tramell...

152
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:48,304
killed in a boating
accident, 1979.

153
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:52,714
Catherine Tramell, sole heir.
Estimated assets: $ 110 million."

154
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:54,719
You're shitting me.

155
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:57,584
"Formerly engaged to
Manuel Vasquez, deceased."

156
00:16:57,624 --> 00:17:00,244
Whoa, whoa! Manny Vasquez?

157
00:17:00,324 --> 00:17:03,693
Former middleweight contender. Killed
in the ring, Atlantic City, 1984.

158
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:05,993
I love it. She's got
100 million bucks.

159
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:08,253
She fucks fighters and
rock and roll stars...

160
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,393
and she's got a degree in
screwing with people's heads.

161
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:13,433
You forgot about her degree
in literature. She's a writer.

162
00:17:13,603 --> 00:17:17,633
She published a novel under a pen
name. Want to know what it's about?

163
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:22,643
It's about a retired rock and roll star
who gets murdered by his girlfriend.

164
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,692
Page 67, cowboy.

165
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:40,282
You know how she
does the boyfriend?

166
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:43,822
With an ice pick, in bed...

167
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:47,422
his hands tied with
a white silk scarf.

168
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,871
Dr. Garner.

169
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:59,241
I've asked Dr. Lamont to consult
with us. This isn't really my turf.

170
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,441
Dr. Lamont teaches the pathology of
psychopathic behavior at Stanford...

171
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:06,281
and also on the Justice Department
Psychological Profile Team.

172
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,321
Dr. Lamont.

173
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:12,250
I see two possibilities.

174
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,260
One: The person who wrote
this book is your murderer...

175
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,460
and acted out the killing described
in ritualistic, literal detail.

176
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,690
Two: Someone who wants
to harm the writer...

177
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,400
read the book and enacted the
killing described to incriminate her.

178
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,240
What if the writer did it?
Then what are we dealing with?

179
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,640
You're dealing with a
devious, diabolical mind.

180
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,309
You see, this book had to have
been written at least six months...

181
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:40,279
maybe even years...
before it was published...

182
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,849
which means the writer must have planned
the crime in the subconscious back then.

183
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,319
Now, the fact that
she carried it out...

184
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:48,449
indicates psychopathic
obsessive behavior...

185
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,494
in terms not only of
the killing itself...

186
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,399
but also in terms of the applied
advance defense mechanism.

187
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:59,428
Sometimes I can't tell
shit from shinola, Doc.

188
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:01,028
What was all that
you just said?

189
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:03,538
- She intended the book to be her alibi.
- Correct.

190
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:06,438
She's going to say, "Do you think
I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone...

191
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,778
in the exact way I
described in my book?"

192
00:19:08,808 --> 00:19:11,248
I wouldn't do that because
I know I'd be the suspect.

193
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:14,878
So, what if it's not the writer? What
if it's someone who read the book?

194
00:19:16,518 --> 00:19:19,488
You're dealing, then,
with someone so obsessed...

195
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:23,787
that he or she is willing to kill
an irrelevant and innocent victim...

196
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:27,057
in order to place the blame on
the person who wrote that book.

197
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,827
I'm talking about a deep-seated
obsessional hatred...

198
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:33,797
and an utter lack of
respect for human life.

199
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:44,736
So, we got a once in a lifetime,
top of the line looney-tuney.

200
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:46,876
That's what you're
saying, right, Doc?

201
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:51,816
You're dealing with
someone very dangerous...

202
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:54,546
and very ill.

203
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:02,586
You know there's no case here.
You've got no physical evidence.

204
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:05,386
She hasn't got an alibi.

205
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:08,395
She hasn't got a motive,
either. Believe me...

206
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:11,405
her defense would just beat us
to death with this copycat thing.

207
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,775
Anybody who read the
book could have done it.

208
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:19,265
- What do you want to do now? Nothing?
- We call her in for questioning.

209
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:21,305
She's got enough money to
burn the department down...

210
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,545
She was the last person
seen with the guy.

211
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:27,385
I'll take the responsibility.

212
00:20:27,455 --> 00:20:29,425
It's yours.

213
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:33,254
It won't do any good.

214
00:20:33,324 --> 00:20:35,414
She'll just waltz in with
some superstar lawyer...

215
00:20:35,494 --> 00:20:38,394
who'll get us all canned for
wasting the taxpayers' money.

216
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:40,834
- That's exactly what she'll do.
- No, she won't.

217
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:46,364
I don't think she'll
hide behind anybody.

218
00:20:46,404 --> 00:20:48,494
I don't think she's
gonna hide at all.

219
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:51,504
Then she's as crazy
as you are, Curran.

220
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:58,503
You know what they say:

221
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,313
Takes one to know one.

222
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:29,642
Miss Tramell, we'd like you to come
downtown to answer a few questions.

223
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:31,812
Are you arresting me?

224
00:21:32,852 --> 00:21:34,872
If that's the way
you want to play it.

225
00:21:34,952 --> 00:21:38,352
Could I change into
something more appropriate?

226
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,681
It'll only take a
minute. Come on in.

227
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:47,861
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll be right back.

228
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,640
Hey, Gus. Hmm?

229
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,640
- So, how long is this gonna take?
- I don't know.

230
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,320
Do you always keep
old newspapers around?

231
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,330
Only when they make
interesting reading.

232
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:39,569
- I'm ready.
- You have the right to an attorney.

233
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,309
Why would I need an attorney?

234
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:55,388
- Do you have a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

235
00:22:55,428 --> 00:22:57,398
Yes, you do.

236
00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:01,898
- I quit.
- Congratulations.

237
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:16,277
I thought you didn't
have any cigarettes.

238
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:18,747
Oh, I found some in my
pocket. Would you like one?

239
00:23:21,787 --> 00:23:24,277
I told you, I quit.

240
00:23:24,357 --> 00:23:26,517
It won't last.

241
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:34,727
- You working on another book?
- Yes, I am.

242
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:38,566
It must really be something
making stuff up all the time.

243
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:41,336
Yeah, it teaches you to lie.

244
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:44,336
How's that?

245
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:49,316
You make up believable stuff. It's
called suspension of disbelief.

246
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,676
I like that!
Suspension of disbelief.

247
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:57,476
What's your new book about?

248
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:03,355
A detective. He falls
for the wrong woman.

249
00:24:09,335 --> 00:24:10,555
What happens?

250
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:12,725
She kills him.

251
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:27,514
I'm John Carreli, Miss Tramell,
assistant district attorney.

252
00:24:27,554 --> 00:24:29,574
I have to inform you this
session's being taped.

253
00:24:29,654 --> 00:24:32,514
- This is Captain Tallcott.
- My pleasure.

254
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:34,614
- And Lieutenant Walker.
- Hi.

255
00:24:34,694 --> 00:24:37,354
- Can we get you a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

256
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:39,394
Are your attorneys
going to join us?

257
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,554
Miss Tramell has waived
her rights to an attorney.

258
00:24:45,663 --> 00:24:47,603
Did I miss something?

259
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:49,603
I told them you wouldn't
want an attorney present.

260
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:53,543
Why have you waived your right
to an attorney, Miss Tramell?

261
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:55,543
Why did you think
I wouldn't want one?

262
00:24:55,573 --> 00:24:57,733
I told them you
wouldn't want to hide.

263
00:24:57,783 --> 00:25:00,513
I have nothing to hide.

264
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,622
There's no smoking
in this building.

265
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:20,732
What are you gonna do?
Charge me with smoking?

266
00:25:34,411 --> 00:25:37,511
Would you tell us the nature of
your relationship with Mr. Boz?

267
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:40,521
I had sex with him for
about a year and a half.

268
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,781
I liked having sex with him.

269
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:48,451
He wasn't afraid
of experimenting.

270
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:51,551
I like men like that.

271
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:53,721
Men who give me pleasure.

272
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,800
He gave me a lot of pleasure.

273
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:07,470
You ever engage in any
sadomasochistic activity?

274
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12,280
Exactly what did you
have in mind, Mr. Carreli?

275
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,720
- You ever tie him up?
- No.

276
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,379
You never tied him up?

277
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:20,419
No.

278
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:23,359
Johnny liked to use
his hands too much.

279
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:26,399
I like hands and fingers.

280
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,659
You describe a white
silk scarf in your book.

281
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:33,469
I've always had a fondness
for white silk scarves.

282
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,509
They're good for
all occasions.

283
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:39,309
But you said you liked men to
use their hands, didn't you?

284
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:41,708
No, I said I liked
Johnny to use his hands.

285
00:26:43,808 --> 00:26:47,768
I don't make any rules,
Nick. I go with the flow.

286
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,748
Did you kill Mr.
Boz, Miss Tramell?

287
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,788
I'd have to be pretty stupid
to write a book about killing...

288
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:57,828
and then kill somebody the
way I described it in my book.

289
00:26:57,858 --> 00:27:01,758
I'd be announcing myself as
the killer. I'm not stupid.

290
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:03,727
We know you're not stupid.

291
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:05,697
Maybe that's what you're counting
on to get you off the hook.

292
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:07,527
Writing the book
gives you an alibi.

293
00:27:07,607 --> 00:27:09,327
Yes, it does.

294
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:15,707
The answer's no.
I didn't kill him.

295
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:21,547
- Do you use drugs, Miss Tramell?
- Sometimes.

296
00:27:21,617 --> 00:27:24,547
- Did you ever use drugs with Mr. Boz?
- Sure.

297
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:25,747
What kind of drugs?

298
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:27,976
Cocaine.

299
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,326
Have you ever fucked
on cocaine, Nick?

300
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:47,376
It's nice.

301
00:27:57,755 --> 00:27:59,745
You like playing
games, don't you?

302
00:27:59,815 --> 00:28:02,755
I have a degree in psychology.
It goes with the turf.

303
00:28:02,925 --> 00:28:04,655
Games are fun.

304
00:28:04,695 --> 00:28:08,425
What about boxing? That's
a game. Is that fun too?

305
00:28:08,495 --> 00:28:11,585
I don't think that's
relevant to this inquiry.

306
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:14,034
Boxing was fun
'til Manny died.

307
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:16,994
How did you feel when he died?

308
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:18,624
I loved him. It hurt.

309
00:28:18,704 --> 00:28:21,004
How did you feel when I
told you Johnny Boz had died?

310
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:24,974
I felt like someone had read
my book and was playing a game.

311
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:26,534
- But it didn't hurt?
- No.

312
00:28:26,614 --> 00:28:27,974
- Because you didn't love him?
- That's right.

313
00:28:28,014 --> 00:28:29,534
Even though you
were fucking him?

314
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:31,544
You still get the pleasure.

315
00:28:31,614 --> 00:28:34,484
Didn't you ever fuck anybody
else when you were married, Nick?

316
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:36,013
How'd you know he was married?

317
00:28:36,223 --> 00:28:38,513
Maybe I was just guessing.

318
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:40,753
What difference does it make?

319
00:28:44,493 --> 00:28:46,653
Would you like a
cigarette, Nick?

320
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:57,503
- Do you two know each other?
- No.

321
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:02,642
How did you meet Mr. Boz?

322
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:06,202
I wanted to write a book about the
murder of a retired rock and roll star.

323
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:09,652
I went down to his club, I picked
him up and I had sex with him.

324
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:14,982
You didn't feel anything for him? You
just had sex with him for your book?

325
00:29:15,222 --> 00:29:19,682
In the beginning. Then I got
to like what he did for me.

326
00:29:20,732 --> 00:29:22,701
That's pretty cold,
ain't it, lady?

327
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,491
I'm a writer. I use
people for what I write.

328
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:28,631
Let the world beware.

329
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:32,941
Do you want me to take
a lie detector test?

330
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:44,521
Wait here, please.

331
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,490
No blips, no blood pressure
variations, no pulse variance.

332
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,660
Either she's telling the truth,
or I've never seen anyone like her.

333
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,770
I guess that settles it.

334
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,200
- She's lying.
- Forget it. You can't fool the machine.

335
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,639
Trust me. It can be done.

336
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,539
And what makes
you such an expert?

337
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:15,269
Because I know people
that have done it.

338
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:21,209
Thank you.

339
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:24,259
Thanks for coming in, Miss
Tramell. Sorry to inconvenience you.

340
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,779
Could someone give
me a ride home?

341
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,829
Sure.

342
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,858
Thank you.

343
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:38,988
Want to get a drink?

344
00:30:48,678 --> 00:30:51,648
- Rough day?
- Not really.

345
00:30:51,688 --> 00:30:54,208
Beating that machine
can't be easy.

346
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,747
If I was guilty and wanted to beat
that machine, it wouldn't be hard.

347
00:31:01,597 --> 00:31:03,687
It wouldn't be hard at all.

348
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:10,287
You took a lie detector test after
you shot those two people, didn't you?

349
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:13,997
I passed.

350
00:31:15,637 --> 00:31:18,836
You see? We're
both innocent, Nick.

351
00:31:36,826 --> 00:31:40,356
You seem to know an
awful lot about me.

352
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,865
You know an awful
lot about me.

353
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:47,195
I don't know anything
that's not police business.

354
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:53,835
You know I don't wear any
underwear. Don't you, Nick?

355
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:05,214
Thanks for the ride.

356
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:21,324
Would you like
another glass of wine?

357
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,834
- Hi, Nick.
- Evening.

358
00:32:27,203 --> 00:32:28,573
What's all this "Nick" stuff?

359
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,233
"Nick, do you want a cigarette?
Nick, can I have a ride?"

360
00:32:31,313 --> 00:32:33,873
She didn't ask me to give
her a ride. She asked anybody.

361
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:36,613
- And you volunteered.
- Hey, Nick. Evian?

362
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:40,013
No, Chuckie. Get me a double
blackjack on the rocks, please.

363
00:32:41,823 --> 00:32:43,793
What you doing, Hoss?

364
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,783
I haven't had a
drink in three months.

365
00:32:47,863 --> 00:32:51,292
All right with you, cowboy?

366
00:32:51,332 --> 00:32:54,322
- She doesn't know me, okay?
- Here you go.

367
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:57,362
I never seen her before
Gus and I talked with her.

368
00:32:57,432 --> 00:32:59,372
- Thanks, Chuck.
- You're sure?

369
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:01,432
Yes, I'm sure.

370
00:33:01,642 --> 00:33:03,402
Cheers.

371
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,272
Now what?

372
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:14,281
What "now what"? Now nothing.

373
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:16,291
She passed the
polygraph. That's it.

374
00:33:16,351 --> 00:33:18,381
She knew how to beat it,
that's why she took it.

375
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:21,651
How in the fuck do you know? What
is it with you and this broad?

376
00:33:21,691 --> 00:33:24,321
Come on, Phil. Don't
let this one slide.

377
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:26,661
What about her parents? What
about what else she published?

378
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:28,701
Maybe all her books come true.

379
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:31,761
Her parents died in an accident. I
don't care what else she published.

380
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:34,201
What are you, a book critic?

381
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:37,370
How'd they die? Was
there an investigation?

382
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:40,710
You're saying she killed her parents?
Did she kill Manny Vasquez too?

383
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,870
Not unless she climbed into the ring
and turned into one mean son of a bitch.

384
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,410
Maybe she did. Maybe she
grew herself an afro...

385
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,280
developed a hell of a left hook and
put shoe polish all over her face.

386
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,760
- Let's polygraph her again.
- Fuck you.

387
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,295
Fuck you too.

388
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,660
Don't worry, Phil.
Nick'll fuck himself.

389
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,499
You guys are very funny. Hey,
Chuckie, get me another double.

390
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:05,229
Hey, shooter!

391
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:08,199
Are you back on the
blackjack, shooter?

392
00:34:08,269 --> 00:34:11,729
- We're discussing a case here.
- I know that. I have no doubts.

393
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:14,709
Here you go, Nick.

394
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:17,749
A double, huh, shooter?

395
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:23,818
I'm off duty, Nilsen.

396
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,988
You hear me? I'm off
duty discussing a case.

397
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:32,698
Now, I.A. Shouldn't
have a problem with that.

398
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,328
Maybe I should put
in for some overtime?

399
00:34:39,238 --> 00:34:43,728
Don't work too hard, shooter.
It might drive you to drink.

400
00:34:46,537 --> 00:34:50,207
Stop riding me, man! I'll
kick your fucking teeth in!

401
00:34:50,277 --> 00:34:53,737
- What's the problem?
- No problem, Doctor.

402
00:34:53,777 --> 00:34:57,847
Here comes the shrink, just in
time to save her favorite patient.

403
00:34:57,917 --> 00:34:59,447
Just fuck off, Marty!

404
00:35:01,257 --> 00:35:03,777
You kids have a good
time tonight, huh?

405
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:13,396
- He's asking for it.
- That's right, so don't take the bait.

406
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:18,466
Do you want to go?

407
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:21,836
- Yes.
- Let's go.

408
00:35:25,216 --> 00:35:28,836
Sometimes I think he started banging
her just to get Internal Affairs off him.

409
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:33,285
He ain't that way.
He's got a heart.

410
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,440
What was she like?

411
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,240
- Who?
- Catherine Tramell.

412
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:55,289
You had her pegged. She
used her book as an alibi.

413
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,489
I met her at Berkeley.

414
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:05,459
We were in some of
the same classes.

415
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:08,299
Why didn't you tell me?

416
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,339
I'm telling you.

417
00:38:19,678 --> 00:38:23,618
You've never been
like that before. Why?

418
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:25,618
You tell me.
You're the shrink.

419
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:31,618
- You weren't making love to me.
- Who was I making love to?

420
00:38:31,658 --> 00:38:34,288
You weren't making love.

421
00:38:38,597 --> 00:38:40,257
I need a cigarette.

422
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:42,527
I thought you said you quit.

423
00:38:48,477 --> 00:38:51,477
It's the top
drawer in the foyer.

424
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:54,467
Get it on your way out!

425
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:07,216
- Have you started?
- Waitin' on you.

426
00:39:07,256 --> 00:39:10,456
- You look like dog shit.
- No, he looks a little shrunk is all.

427
00:39:10,526 --> 00:39:12,756
And not just in the head.

428
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,596
All right, I made a couple
of calls to Berkeley.

429
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:18,396
There was a murder
in '80. A professor.

430
00:39:18,436 --> 00:39:22,526
In his bed, multiple stab
wounds, with an ice pick.

431
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:26,705
Tramell was there
then, wasn't she?

432
00:39:27,775 --> 00:39:31,435
University records
say she was.

433
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:34,315
Okay, let's move on this.
Gus, get out to Berkeley.

434
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:36,405
Harrigan, find out what
else she's published.

435
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:38,215
Andrews, get me that file
on the parents' accident.

436
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:40,775
Copy Beth on everything.
I want psychological input.

437
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:44,415
- What about me?
- You're already getting input.

438
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:47,424
You go soak your head
in a tub of ice water.

439
00:39:56,274 --> 00:39:57,734
You see where she leads.

440
00:43:22,665 --> 00:43:24,695
You have a good weekend.

441
00:43:24,765 --> 00:43:26,435
You too.

442
00:43:26,505 --> 00:43:27,805
Drive carefully.

443
00:43:27,975 --> 00:43:30,465
- I will.
- Bye-bye.

444
00:43:30,505 --> 00:43:31,775
I'll call you.

445
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:56,808
Ain't you got nothing better to do
than to jack off the damn machine?

446
00:45:56,978 --> 00:45:58,708
What are you
doing here, cowboy?

447
00:45:58,748 --> 00:46:01,808
I came in here to jack
off the damn machine.

448
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:04,548
One dead psychology professor.

449
00:46:04,618 --> 00:46:08,648
Dr. Noah Goldstein.
And guess what?

450
00:46:08,728 --> 00:46:11,598
He was her counselor.

451
00:46:11,628 --> 00:46:12,933
Was she a suspect?

452
00:46:12,968 --> 00:46:15,958
No, sir. They never even
got a statement from her.

453
00:46:17,298 --> 00:46:19,668
Hazel Dobkins?

454
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:21,597
Do you know her?

455
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:24,197
Couldn't get it out
of my head for years.

456
00:46:24,277 --> 00:46:26,797
Nice little housewife.
Three little kids.

457
00:46:26,847 --> 00:46:30,647
Nice husband wasn't porking
around. No financial problems.

458
00:46:30,717 --> 00:46:35,547
One day, out of the clear blue
sky, she does them, all of them.

459
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:38,647
Used a knife she got
for a wedding present.

460
00:46:38,727 --> 00:46:41,987
Didn't even deny
it. Sweet as honey.

461
00:46:42,227 --> 00:46:44,956
Said she didn't know
why she'd done it.

462
00:46:57,706 --> 00:47:00,676
- Hi.
- Am I disturbing you?

463
00:47:00,706 --> 00:47:03,706
No, come on in.

464
00:47:04,746 --> 00:47:06,715
Let's go upstairs.

465
00:47:23,735 --> 00:47:25,825
I'm using you for my
detective in my book.

466
00:47:27,165 --> 00:47:29,194
You don't mind, do you?

467
00:47:31,734 --> 00:47:34,704
I was just gonna
make myself a drink.

468
00:47:34,744 --> 00:47:36,734
- Do you want one?
- No, thanks.

469
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:40,744
Oh, right. You're off the
Jack Daniels too, aren't you?

470
00:47:44,454 --> 00:47:46,614
I've got a few more
questions to ask you.

471
00:47:46,684 --> 00:47:49,744
I have some for you
too. For my book.

472
00:47:59,763 --> 00:48:02,753
Do you have something
against ice cubes?

473
00:48:02,803 --> 00:48:04,793
I like rough edges.

474
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:07,833
So, what did you
want to ask me?

475
00:48:07,973 --> 00:48:10,403
How does it feel
to kill someone?

476
00:48:13,313 --> 00:48:14,713
You tell me.

477
00:48:16,712 --> 00:48:19,272
I don't know, but you do.

478
00:48:20,822 --> 00:48:22,752
It was an accident.

479
00:48:22,822 --> 00:48:24,722
They got in the line of fire.

480
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:31,792
Four shootings in five
years, all accidents?

481
00:48:33,662 --> 00:48:36,662
They were drug buys. I
was working undercover.

482
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:41,471
You want to tell me
about Professor Goldstein?

483
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:46,811
Well, there's a
name from the past.

484
00:48:46,881 --> 00:48:50,181
You want a name from the
present? What about Hazel Dobkins?

485
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:55,751
Noah Goldstein was my
counselor my fresh man year.

486
00:48:55,821 --> 00:48:59,281
That's probably where I got the
idea for the ice pick for my book.

487
00:49:01,321 --> 00:49:03,450
Funny how the
subconscious works.

488
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,150
Hilarious.

489
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:11,270
- Hazel's my friend.
- Your friend took out her whole family.

490
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:14,430
Yes, she helped me
understand homicidal impulse.

491
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:16,440
I thought you would have
learned that at school.

492
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,210
Only in theory.

493
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,409
But you know all about homicidal
impulse, don't you, shooter?

494
00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:30,379
Not in theory, in practice.

495
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:34,249
What happened? Did
you get sucked into it?

496
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:37,159
Did you like it too much?

497
00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:41,659
I don't know what
you're talking about.

498
00:49:43,529 --> 00:49:46,259
Tell me about the coke, Nick.

499
00:49:48,338 --> 00:49:51,328
The day you shot
those two tourists...

500
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:53,378
how much coke did you do?

501
00:49:57,178 --> 00:50:00,378
Come on, you can tell me.

502
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:10,188
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

503
00:50:10,228 --> 00:50:13,457
They never tested
you, did they?

504
00:50:13,497 --> 00:50:16,467
Internal Affairs knew.

505
00:50:18,527 --> 00:50:21,527
Your wife knew
too, didn't she?

506
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:29,367
She knew what was going on.

507
00:50:32,247 --> 00:50:34,236
I think you got too
close to the flame.

508
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:44,246
I think you liked it.

509
00:50:48,556 --> 00:50:51,356
That's why she killed herself.

510
00:51:06,575 --> 00:51:08,565
Hi, hon.

511
00:51:12,785 --> 00:51:16,275
You two have met, haven't you?

512
00:51:24,824 --> 00:51:28,354
You're gonna make a
terrific character, Nick.

513
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:40,878
She's on the phone.
She'll be right with you.

514
00:51:40,908 --> 00:51:45,573
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Detective, you can't go in...

515
00:51:45,613 --> 00:51:48,343
- Who's got access to my file?
- What are you talking about?

516
00:51:48,383 --> 00:51:50,473
Who has access to
my goddamn file?

517
00:51:50,553 --> 00:51:54,383
Nobody. It's a confidential
psychiatric record. It would be illegal.

518
00:51:54,453 --> 00:51:57,223
Don't you fucking lie to me!

519
00:51:57,293 --> 00:51:59,263
It was Internal
Affairs, wasn't it?

520
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:00,353
No, please.

521
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:03,403
- Who?
- It's Nilson.

522
00:52:15,242 --> 00:52:16,612
What do you want, Curran?

523
00:52:16,812 --> 00:52:18,302
You sold her my
file, didn't you?

524
00:52:18,342 --> 00:52:20,402
Who are you talking about?

525
00:52:20,452 --> 00:52:23,852
Catherine Tramell. How
much did she pay you?

526
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:27,522
Hey, Curran, come
on! Damn it, stop it!

527
00:52:27,592 --> 00:52:28,852
How much?

528
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:34,851
Hey, back off!
Back off, Curran!

529
00:52:34,891 --> 00:52:38,231
Nice and easy now.
Nice and easy.

530
00:52:38,301 --> 00:52:41,231
You fucked yourself, shooter.
You hear me? You are out!

531
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:43,701
- Curran, take it easy.
- You are out!

532
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:46,871
Save it, save it.

533
00:52:50,381 --> 00:52:52,571
- What's going down, Hoss?
- Nothing. I'll be okay.

534
00:52:52,651 --> 00:52:55,910
- They're gonna want your badge.
- I'm tired of being played with.

535
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,580
You got a real conclusive
way of demonstrating that.

536
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,190
She knows where I
live and breathe.

537
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,630
She's coming after me, Gus.

538
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,570
What is it you
got between you?

539
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,229
- I don't know.
- Something, though.

540
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:25,369
Something.

541
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:46,428
Nick, are you there?

542
00:53:46,468 --> 00:53:49,398
Go away, Beth. I
don't want to see you.

543
00:53:55,638 --> 00:53:58,468
I still have my key.

544
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,208
Put them on the
table and leave.

545
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:07,447
Put them on the
goddamn table and leave!

546
00:54:07,517 --> 00:54:10,547
Damn it! Don't shove me out!
You owe me more than that!

547
00:54:13,227 --> 00:54:15,627
I don't owe you anything!

548
00:54:15,657 --> 00:54:18,527
And you don't owe me anything.

549
00:54:18,557 --> 00:54:21,657
We went to bed,
what, 10, 15 times?

550
00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:25,526
It wasn't memorable enough
to carry an obligation.

551
00:54:27,436 --> 00:54:30,196
Sometimes I really hate you.

552
00:54:30,236 --> 00:54:32,726
Why don't you get yourself some
friendly little therapist...

553
00:54:33,246 --> 00:54:35,436
to work out some
of that hostility?

554
00:54:35,476 --> 00:54:38,606
And maybe you can get
off once in a while.

555
00:54:41,516 --> 00:54:44,346
Are you nuts?

556
00:54:53,465 --> 00:54:54,725
I'm sorry.

557
00:54:57,265 --> 00:54:59,595
I don't usually act like that.

558
00:54:59,665 --> 00:55:02,435
How could you
give him my file?

559
00:55:02,505 --> 00:55:04,195
I had to!

560
00:55:04,275 --> 00:55:08,205
He was going to recommend
your discharge from the force.

561
00:55:08,245 --> 00:55:11,435
He didn't buy my evaluation.
He said I wasn't objective.

562
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:15,384
So I made a deal with him to
review the session notes himself.

563
00:55:15,419 --> 00:55:17,614
I didn't think he'd
show them to anybody.

564
00:55:17,684 --> 00:55:20,554
- You did it for me?
- Yes.

565
00:55:20,624 --> 00:55:23,354
I care about you.
I did it for you.

566
00:55:28,564 --> 00:55:32,294
Go away. Please, just go away.

567
00:56:06,662 --> 00:56:09,602
I'm on my way.

568
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:04,380
One shot. Close range.
Probably a. 38 caliber revolver.

569
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:08,279
Give me your gun, Nick.

570
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:19,729
You think that...

571
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:27,539
I don't, Hoss. But I
got the minority opinion.

572
00:57:31,908 --> 00:57:36,538
Okay, I went after
him! I lost my temper.

573
00:57:36,618 --> 00:57:39,608
Do you have any evidence that he
showed your psychiatric file to anyone?

574
00:57:46,598 --> 00:57:48,558
We'll speak with you
afterwards, Dr. Garner.

575
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,588
- I'd like to sit in.
- I'd really rather wait...

576
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:54,597
It's all right if Dr. Garner sits in,
if Detective Curran doesn't object.

577
00:58:00,507 --> 00:58:03,477
- Where were you last night?
- Home, watching TV.

578
00:58:03,507 --> 00:58:05,307
All night?

579
00:58:05,947 --> 00:58:07,507
Yes, all night.

580
00:58:07,577 --> 00:58:09,737
Were you drinking?

581
00:58:13,517 --> 00:58:15,347
Yeah, I was drinking.

582
00:58:15,387 --> 00:58:18,356
- When did you start drinking again?
- A couple of days ago.

583
00:58:18,386 --> 00:58:21,626
I saw Detective Curran at his
apartment about 10:00 last night.

584
00:58:21,696 --> 00:58:23,596
He was sober and lucid.

585
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,426
I asked him, in my capacity as
his departmental therapist...

586
00:58:26,466 --> 00:58:28,556
about his altercation
with Lieutenant Nilsen.

587
00:58:28,596 --> 00:58:31,896
He expressed regret and
displayed no hostility.

588
00:58:32,136 --> 00:58:35,736
- How long were you at his apartment?
- About 15 minutes.

589
00:58:35,906 --> 00:58:39,396
I saw there was no reason
for my concern and left.

590
00:58:39,476 --> 00:58:42,135
There's no smoking in
this building, Detective.

591
00:58:44,385 --> 00:58:46,345
What are you gonna do?
Charge me with smoking?

592
00:58:47,915 --> 00:58:51,585
Oh, for Christ's... All right, Nick,
I'm gonna ask you this just once.

593
00:58:51,655 --> 00:58:54,925
For the record, did
you kill Marty Nilsen?

594
00:58:56,725 --> 00:58:58,755
No.

595
00:58:58,925 --> 00:59:01,555
I'm gonna storm into his
office in front of everybody...

596
00:59:01,635 --> 00:59:03,604
in the middle of the day
and kill him that night?

597
00:59:03,634 --> 00:59:05,604
I'm not that dumb.

598
00:59:05,664 --> 00:59:09,624
Going after him before gets you off the
hook for killing him. That's your alibi.

599
00:59:09,674 --> 00:59:13,334
Like writing a book about killing a guy
gets you off the hook for killing him.

600
00:59:13,414 --> 00:59:14,394
Good point.

601
00:59:14,474 --> 00:59:16,414
What are you talking about?

602
00:59:16,444 --> 00:59:19,744
- A private joke, asshole.
- I don't think it's funny.

603
00:59:19,914 --> 00:59:21,384
You're going on leave...

604
00:59:22,454 --> 00:59:25,714
pending the outcome of
a psychiatric evaluation.

605
00:59:37,763 --> 00:59:40,463
I'll get my stuff in a minute.

606
00:59:44,843 --> 00:59:46,173
Thank you.

607
00:59:50,612 --> 00:59:52,702
It's the least I could do.

608
00:59:52,782 --> 00:59:55,612
Considering I got you into
this mess with those reports.

609
00:59:55,682 --> 00:59:58,452
No, I mean it. Thank you.

610
01:00:00,252 --> 01:00:03,222
How do you know Catherine
Tramell saw your file?

611
01:00:03,262 --> 01:00:06,922
She knows things about
me that I only told you.

612
01:00:07,162 --> 01:00:09,562
She must really be something.

613
01:00:09,632 --> 01:00:12,122
From a clinical point of view.

614
01:00:12,162 --> 01:00:14,761
- What was she like in school?
- I hardly knew her.

615
01:00:14,801 --> 01:00:16,601
She gave me the creeps.

616
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:18,601
I don't know why.

617
01:00:22,711 --> 01:00:25,731
Get some rest. Promise?

618
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:34,741
- I didn't mean what I said about...
- Yes, you did.

619
01:00:34,821 --> 01:00:37,790
I'm a big girl.
I can handle it.

620
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:04,739
- You take care of yourself.
- What'd you find out about the parents?

621
01:01:04,819 --> 01:01:07,714
No lead, man.

622
01:01:07,749 --> 01:01:11,149
You're on psycho leave. I'm
talking to a possible wacko!

623
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:14,159
You know I'm wacko.
What'd you find out?

624
01:01:17,659 --> 01:01:21,259
The boat blew. There was
a leak in the fuel line.

625
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:25,298
There were two previous repairs and
a five mil policy on both of them.

626
01:01:25,498 --> 01:01:27,668
A real heavy investigation
but they got zilch.

627
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:30,538
Big goose egg. It
was an "accident."

628
01:01:30,578 --> 01:01:34,168
I.A.'s gonna talk to you about Nilsen.
They're handling the investigation.

629
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:36,738
Stay in touch with Dr. Garner.
It'll help on the evaluation.

630
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:40,508
She killed him.

631
01:01:40,588 --> 01:01:41,848
Beth? Now you've got
Beth killing people?

632
01:01:42,188 --> 01:01:44,118
Catherine Tramell.
It's part of her game.

633
01:01:44,188 --> 01:01:48,217
First you got her stealing your
file, now she's killing Nilsen?

634
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,227
Forget about her! Go
somewhere, sit in the sun.

635
01:01:51,297 --> 01:01:54,697
- Get her the hell out of your system!
- You don't buy it, do you?

636
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:57,127
She knew nobody'd buy it.

637
01:01:57,197 --> 01:02:00,567
She knew I'd say she did
it and nobody'd buy it!

638
01:02:00,607 --> 01:02:03,767
She is screwing with your
head! Stay away from her!

639
01:02:31,335 --> 01:02:32,765
I heard what happened.

640
01:02:41,545 --> 01:02:44,605
What good's a shooter
without his gun?

641
01:02:44,675 --> 01:02:47,645
- How exactly did you find out?
- I have attorneys.

642
01:02:47,715 --> 01:02:50,685
They have friends.
I have friends.

643
01:02:50,755 --> 01:02:53,345
Money buys a lot of
attorneys and friends.

644
01:02:53,555 --> 01:02:55,684
I wouldn't know about that.
I don't have any money...

645
01:02:55,754 --> 01:02:59,554
I don't have any attorneys,
and Gus is my only real friend.

646
01:02:59,624 --> 01:03:01,684
I wasn't talking
about real friends.

647
01:03:06,194 --> 01:03:08,564
Why doesn't Gus like me?

648
01:03:09,334 --> 01:03:11,364
I like you.

649
01:03:11,574 --> 01:03:14,134
- You do?
- Yes.

650
01:03:15,204 --> 01:03:18,373
You want to go upstairs
and have a drink?

651
01:03:19,643 --> 01:03:21,373
I didn't think you'd ask me.

652
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:25,383
I guess you don't know
your character that well.

653
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:29,283
Maybe, but I'm learning.

654
01:03:29,353 --> 01:03:32,183
Pretty soon I'll know you
better than you know yourself.

655
01:03:32,223 --> 01:03:34,353
- Don't be so sure.
- Why not?

656
01:03:34,423 --> 01:03:37,193
- I'm very unpredictable.
- Unpredictable?

657
01:03:47,242 --> 01:03:49,402
You should put some
warmth into the place.

658
01:03:49,442 --> 01:03:52,202
You don't want it to
reflect your personality.

659
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:53,802
I'm not trying
to fool anybody.

660
01:03:53,882 --> 01:03:56,712
Jack Daniels all right?
It's going to have to be.

661
01:03:56,752 --> 01:03:58,712
- Ice?
- Great.

662
01:04:07,221 --> 01:04:08,311
I was expecting you.

663
01:04:13,301 --> 01:04:14,791
K- Mart. A buck,
sixty-five.

664
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:23,401
Why don't you let
me do this for you.

665
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:33,650
You like watching
me do it, don't you?

666
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:39,250
Could I have a
cigarette too, please?

667
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:41,760
I told you you'd
start smoking again.

668
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,780
Would you light it for me?

669
01:04:49,999 --> 01:04:51,929
Thanks.

670
01:04:53,629 --> 01:04:58,159
So how much did you
pay Nilsen for my file?

671
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:02,659
Isn't he the policeman
that you shot, shooter?

672
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:05,039
What if I ask you not
to call me "shooter"?

673
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:08,669
Okay. How about if
I call you Nicky?

674
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:12,739
My wife used to call me Nicky.

675
01:05:13,088 --> 01:05:17,388
Yeah, I know. I like it.

676
01:05:20,758 --> 01:05:23,628
Cheers. My friend
call me Catherine.

677
01:05:23,658 --> 01:05:26,428
What did Manny
Vasquez call you?

678
01:05:26,468 --> 01:05:28,298
Bitch, mostly.

679
01:05:28,368 --> 01:05:30,698
But he meant it
affectionately.

680
01:05:32,338 --> 01:05:34,358
Do you have any coke?

681
01:05:35,438 --> 01:05:37,697
I just love coke
with Jack Daniels.

682
01:05:37,737 --> 01:05:39,707
Got a Pepsi in the fridge.

683
01:05:39,777 --> 01:05:43,337
It's not really the
same thing now, is it?

684
01:05:43,647 --> 01:05:45,617
No, it's not.

685
01:05:48,627 --> 01:05:50,587
So where's this going?

686
01:05:53,697 --> 01:05:56,357
What do you want from me?

687
01:05:58,697 --> 01:06:02,426
Say, "what do you want
from me, Catherine?"

688
01:06:03,736 --> 01:06:07,366
What the fuck do you
want from me, Catherine?

689
01:06:14,246 --> 01:06:16,336
Brought you something.

690
01:06:20,656 --> 01:06:25,485
Aren't you going
to say thank-you?

691
01:06:25,555 --> 01:06:28,825
- What's it about?
- It's about a boy who kills his parents.

692
01:06:28,895 --> 01:06:31,885
They have a play, and he
makes it look like an accident.

693
01:06:35,235 --> 01:06:36,395
Why did he do that?

694
01:06:38,265 --> 01:06:40,895
To see if he could
get away with it.

695
01:06:43,645 --> 01:06:45,305
When did you write this?

696
01:06:46,344 --> 01:06:49,314
You mean, did I write it
before my parents died?

697
01:06:53,914 --> 01:06:56,914
No. I wrote it
years afterwards.

698
01:06:58,654 --> 01:07:02,354
You wont stop following me around
now just because you're on leave?

699
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:03,694
Absolutely not.

700
01:07:05,594 --> 01:07:07,494
Good, I'd miss you.

701
01:07:07,564 --> 01:07:09,723
You could get in trouble.
You're not really a cop anymore.

702
01:07:09,758 --> 01:07:12,893
- I'll risk it.
- Why take the risk?

703
01:07:13,233 --> 01:07:16,173
To see if I can
get away with it.

704
01:07:18,343 --> 01:07:21,873
- How's your new book?
- Practically writing itself.

705
01:07:23,213 --> 01:07:26,413
I'll be leaving about midnight,
in case you are going to follow me.

706
01:07:28,513 --> 01:07:32,682
- I'll be at Johnny Boz's club.
- I'll meet you there.

707
01:07:34,322 --> 01:07:36,252
Hi, Gus.

708
01:07:51,402 --> 01:07:55,501
Forgive me for asking, and I don't
mean to belabor the obvious...

709
01:07:55,541 --> 01:07:59,571
but why've you got your
head so far up your ass?

710
01:07:59,651 --> 01:08:02,671
She wants to play.
Fine, I can play.

711
01:08:04,451 --> 01:08:06,651
Everybody she plays with dies.

712
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:10,311
I know what that's like.

713
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:06,708
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

714
01:16:39,309 --> 01:16:42,279
If you don't leave her
alone, I'll kill you.

715
01:16:48,348 --> 01:16:50,618
Let me ask you
something, "Rocky."

716
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:53,788
Man to man.

717
01:16:56,258 --> 01:16:58,858
I think she's the
fuck of the century.

718
01:17:02,738 --> 01:17:04,728
What do you think?

719
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:10,767
How long you been here?

720
01:17:12,407 --> 01:17:15,307
You like watching, don't you?

721
01:17:18,777 --> 01:17:20,777
She likes me to watch.

722
01:18:05,395 --> 01:18:07,365
Oh, God.

723
01:18:12,235 --> 01:18:14,395
<font color=#66CCCC>The
beach C</font>

724
01:18:57,413 --> 01:18:59,343
Good morning.

725
01:19:00,443 --> 01:19:02,743
I guess Roxy's not
taking this too well.

726
01:19:03,683 --> 01:19:06,772
She's seen me fuck
plenty of guys.

727
01:19:06,822 --> 01:19:11,652
Well, maybe she saw something
she's never seen before.

728
01:19:11,692 --> 01:19:13,422
She's seen everything before.

729
01:19:13,492 --> 01:19:16,862
Honey, I thought I'd
seen everything before.

730
01:19:17,192 --> 01:19:19,492
Did you really think
it was so special?

731
01:19:19,702 --> 01:19:23,362
I told her I thought it
was the fuck of the century.

732
01:19:28,442 --> 01:19:30,171
What do you think?

733
01:19:30,241 --> 01:19:34,231
I thought it was a
pretty good beginning.

734
01:19:38,151 --> 01:19:39,411
What about Roxy?

735
01:19:39,481 --> 01:19:41,751
Is she more fun?

736
01:19:41,821 --> 01:19:44,751
Would you like her
to join us sometime?

737
01:19:44,821 --> 01:19:49,551
- Did she join you and Johnny?
- No, he felt intimidated.

738
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:51,820
Look what happened to him.

739
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:54,800
Tell me, were you
frightened last night?

740
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:56,390
That's the point, wasn't it?

741
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:58,460
That's what made it so good.

742
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,830
- You shouldn't play this game.
- Why not? I like it.

743
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:05,310
You're in over your head.

744
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:09,300
Maybe, but this is how
I'll catch my killer.

745
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:18,779
I'm not going to confess all my
secrets just because I have an orgasm.

746
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:21,479
You won't learn anything
I don't want you to know.

747
01:20:21,519 --> 01:20:25,489
Yes, I will. Then
I'll nail you.

748
01:20:25,524 --> 01:20:29,459
You'll just fall
in love with me.

749
01:20:29,499 --> 01:20:31,519
I'm in love with you already.

750
01:20:35,369 --> 01:20:37,569
But I'll nail you anyway.

751
01:20:38,768 --> 01:20:41,298
You can put that in your book.

752
01:20:45,548 --> 01:20:46,778
No

753
01:20:46,818 --> 01:20:50,768
Not that bar again

754
01:20:52,388 --> 01:20:55,618
Oh, I want to
know you're the one

755
01:20:55,788 --> 01:20:58,948
And I don't mean
the one I regret

756
01:21:01,397 --> 01:21:03,297
The heart's still going

757
01:21:03,367 --> 01:21:06,457
- Thought I'd find you here.
- Where the fuck you been?

758
01:21:06,497 --> 01:21:10,337
- I've been over to your place.
- Easy, cowboy, easy.

759
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:15,377
- I wasn't there.
- I went over last night too.

760
01:21:16,447 --> 01:21:18,607
Well, I wasn't there either.

761
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:25,916
You fucked her.

762
01:21:26,776 --> 01:21:29,816
God damned, dumb
son of a bitch!

763
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:32,316
You fucked her!

764
01:21:32,386 --> 01:21:34,486
God damn! You are one...

765
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,546
dumb son of a bitch!

766
01:21:36,596 --> 01:21:37,751
Next time, I'll use a rubber.

767
01:21:37,786 --> 01:21:42,596
I don't give a flying,
chili bean fart about that!

768
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:45,636
- How about it, Harry.
How much? - Thirty-two.

769
01:21:45,806 --> 01:21:48,365
I'm worried about him,
he's worried about rubbers.

770
01:21:48,435 --> 01:21:50,335
You really gotta
protect yourself.

771
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,935
What in the hell for?

772
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:58,475
You think I'm getting any? Sure, I
can get laid by blue haired women!

773
01:21:58,545 --> 01:22:02,245
- I don't like them!
- Don't knock it 'til you tried it!

774
01:22:08,395 --> 01:22:09,485
Feeling better?

775
01:22:09,525 --> 01:22:12,464
I feel fine.

776
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:13,654
How could you fuck her?

777
01:22:15,294 --> 01:22:16,634
Come on.

778
01:22:20,534 --> 01:22:22,664
You want to die, Hoss?

779
01:22:22,874 --> 01:22:24,844
What is it? Those tourists?

780
01:22:26,314 --> 01:22:30,644
You still so bad about that, you're
wiggling your way into an ice pick?

781
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:34,198
Got too many, god damn
tourists coming here anyway!

782
01:22:34,233 --> 01:22:37,713
- Hold it down.
- Plenty more where they came from!

783
01:22:47,593 --> 01:22:49,393
I'm not afraid of her.

784
01:22:49,433 --> 01:22:50,663
Why the hell not?

785
01:22:53,533 --> 01:22:55,503
I don't know.

786
01:22:55,533 --> 01:22:56,693
I'm just not.

787
01:22:56,902 --> 01:22:59,392
That's her pussy talking!
It ain't your brain!

788
01:22:59,472 --> 01:23:01,702
Come on.

789
01:23:10,282 --> 01:23:14,452
I.A. Did a track on Lieutenant
Martin D-for-dickhead Nilsen.

790
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:17,682
They found a safety deposit
box with $50,000 in it...

791
01:23:17,762 --> 01:23:20,921
taken out three months
ago and not used since.

792
01:23:22,561 --> 01:23:25,731
That doesn't make any sense. She
didn't know me three months ago.

793
01:23:25,766 --> 01:23:27,661
Maybe it wasn't
her that paid him.

794
01:23:27,731 --> 01:23:30,571
Maybe the money was for something
else. How the fuck do I know?

795
01:23:33,731 --> 01:23:39,201
I'm just an old city cowboy trying
not to fall out of his saddle.

796
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,655
- All right, cowboy?
- Yeah.

797
01:23:55,690 --> 01:23:58,040
Come on. I'm going
to drive you home.

798
01:23:58,075 --> 01:24:00,390
In that little
piss-ant car of yours?

799
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:04,490
Hell, no. I ain't getting no
back pain disability retirement.

800
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:09,629
I'm gonna get a full pension and
a real gold-plate Seiko watch.

801
01:24:09,709 --> 01:24:11,274
I'm driving you...

802
01:24:11,309 --> 01:24:13,509
You're not driving
my Cadillac car!

803
01:24:13,579 --> 01:24:18,449
I won't let no head-up-his-ass
person drive my Cadillac car!

804
01:24:18,519 --> 01:24:19,679
So long!

805
01:26:19,634 --> 01:26:21,604
You wanna play? Come on!

806
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:34,460
Lieutenant! I got
the information.

807
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:36,475
Get it down here!

808
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:38,840
You signed your name
to this crock of shit?

809
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:40,500
Why not? It was an accident.

810
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:44,570
"Your driving around North Beach and
this car won't get out of the way."

811
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:46,510
I don't think she meant
to go off the edge.

812
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:49,350
- Could we have him for a minute?
- No, you can't!

813
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:53,340
Don't fuck with me on this. I don't
need a reason to put your ass in a sling.

814
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:56,650
Full name is Roxanne Hardy. Last
known address, Cloverdale, California.

815
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:58,679
No priors, no convictions.

816
01:27:58,759 --> 01:28:01,919
Car is registered
to Catherine Trammel.

817
01:28:02,129 --> 01:28:04,119
- You knew her!
- I met her at Trammel's house.

818
01:28:04,169 --> 01:28:05,629
All I did was
write her name down.

819
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:08,789
You wrote her name down
and then big surprise...

820
01:28:08,839 --> 01:28:11,529
she rolls her car
down a hill and dies.

821
01:28:11,609 --> 01:28:15,469
- Is that what you're telling me?
- That's all I know.

822
01:28:15,509 --> 01:28:18,599
You know what then? Fuck you!

823
01:28:20,578 --> 01:28:23,568
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office...
- I told you to stay away from Trammel!

824
01:28:23,618 --> 01:28:25,378
You didn't tell me to
stay away from the car!

825
01:28:25,418 --> 01:28:29,718
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office!
- Who are you selling my file to now?

826
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:34,618
You are out of control,
Curran. You hear me?

827
01:28:43,937 --> 01:28:46,837
Hello, Nick. This
is Dr. Myron...

828
01:28:46,907 --> 01:28:48,837
and Dr. McElwaine.

829
01:28:50,477 --> 01:28:55,347
They've been asked to consult with
me on this psychiatric evaluation.

830
01:28:55,517 --> 01:28:57,307
Sit down.

831
01:29:04,327 --> 01:29:07,756
We understand you're having difficulty
controlling your temper lately.

832
01:29:07,826 --> 01:29:10,556
Only in regard to one person.

833
01:29:11,626 --> 01:29:15,496
Do you think Lieutenant
Nilsen deserved to die?

834
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:18,606
I didn't know him well enough.

835
01:29:18,636 --> 01:29:19,866
I won't miss him.

836
01:29:22,676 --> 01:29:25,536
When you recollect
your childhood...

837
01:29:25,606 --> 01:29:28,236
are your recollections
pleasing to you?

838
01:29:31,245 --> 01:29:35,655
Number one: I don't remember how
often I jerked off, but it was a lot.

839
01:29:35,685 --> 01:29:37,915
Number two: I wasn't
pissed off at my dad...

840
01:29:38,255 --> 01:29:40,845
even when I was old enough to know
what he and mom did in the bedroom.

841
01:29:40,925 --> 01:29:44,255
Number three: I don't look
in the toilet before I flush.

842
01:29:44,325 --> 01:29:47,665
Number four: I haven't
wet my bed for a long time.

843
01:29:47,735 --> 01:29:49,855
Number five...

844
01:29:49,935 --> 01:29:52,335
why don't the two of
you go fuck yourselves.

845
01:29:52,365 --> 01:29:54,334
I'm out of here.

846
01:30:01,744 --> 01:30:03,734
What's your problem?
I'm trying to help.

847
01:30:03,814 --> 01:30:05,644
- Why won't you let me?
- I don't want your help!

848
01:30:05,714 --> 01:30:07,614
- I don't need it.
- Yes, you do!

849
01:30:07,684 --> 01:30:09,674
Something's going on.

850
01:30:09,754 --> 01:30:11,774
You're sleeping
with her, aren't you?

851
01:30:11,824 --> 01:30:15,784
- Why are you interested in her?
- My interest is in you, not her.

852
01:30:15,824 --> 01:30:17,793
She seduces and
manipulates people.

853
01:30:17,863 --> 01:30:20,553
- She'll do anything she can...
- I thought you hardly knew her?

854
01:30:20,633 --> 01:30:22,923
- I know the type. I'm a psychologist.
- That means...

855
01:30:23,263 --> 01:30:25,753
you manipulate people too!

856
01:30:25,833 --> 01:30:27,923
You're a practicing
psychologist.

857
01:30:28,303 --> 01:30:30,363
You're better at
it than she is!

858
01:30:31,903 --> 01:30:34,873
I feel sorry for you!

859
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:34,320
I should have known.

860
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,930
I came in to the house.

861
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:42,870
When we were down
on the beach...

862
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,300
she looked at me so strangely.

863
01:31:49,809 --> 01:31:51,979
She left right after you.

864
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,709
I...

865
01:31:59,759 --> 01:32:02,819
I shouldn't have
let her watch us.

866
01:32:04,759 --> 01:32:07,419
She wanted to watch
me all the time.

867
01:32:13,838 --> 01:32:17,928
She tried to kill
you, didn't she?

868
01:32:18,278 --> 01:32:22,468
- Did you like her to watch you?
- You think I told her to kill you?

869
01:32:22,678 --> 01:32:24,478
No.

870
01:32:27,448 --> 01:32:31,388
Everybody that I care about...

871
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:33,418
dies.

872
01:32:52,907 --> 01:32:54,847
Make love to me.

873
01:33:14,396 --> 01:33:18,356
You think she
killed Johnny Boz?

874
01:33:18,396 --> 01:33:21,455
For what, to set me up?

875
01:33:21,535 --> 01:33:23,905
She loved me. She
wouldn't frame me.

876
01:33:24,905 --> 01:33:29,275
- Maybe she got jealous of Johnny too.
- No, she didn't.

877
01:33:29,345 --> 01:33:32,315
She'd never get
jealous before.

878
01:33:32,375 --> 01:33:34,365
She got excited.

879
01:33:37,415 --> 01:33:40,385
I don't have luck with women.

880
01:33:41,855 --> 01:33:43,985
There was this girl...

881
01:33:44,325 --> 01:33:46,794
I met when I was in college.

882
01:33:46,824 --> 01:33:48,384
I slept with her once.

883
01:33:48,464 --> 01:33:52,954
She started following me
around, taking my picture.

884
01:33:53,334 --> 01:33:57,464
She dyed her hair,
copied my clothes.

885
01:33:57,534 --> 01:33:59,504
Lisa...

886
01:34:00,544 --> 01:34:02,474
something, Oberman.

887
01:34:06,544 --> 01:34:08,533
It was awful.

888
01:34:10,553 --> 01:34:12,543
I thought you didn't
make confessions.

889
01:34:16,853 --> 01:34:18,883
I never did before.

890
01:34:29,303 --> 01:34:30,463
Another nice girl.

891
01:34:49,452 --> 01:34:50,922
How old was she
when it happened?

892
01:34:50,952 --> 01:34:52,942
Sixteen.

893
01:34:53,292 --> 01:34:55,551
We seal juvenile records
until they're deceased.

894
01:34:55,621 --> 01:34:57,561
That's why you couldn't
find it in your computer.

895
01:34:57,631 --> 01:35:00,421
What was the motive?

896
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:03,401
She said she didn't know.
Just sort of did it on impulse.

897
01:35:03,431 --> 01:35:07,421
The razor just happened to be
there. That's what she said.

898
01:35:12,941 --> 01:35:16,880
- Help yourself to some coffee.
- Thanks.

899
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:19,880
I don't understand what
the hell is going on here.

900
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:22,410
It ain't hard, Hoss.
This young farm girl...

901
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:25,820
got tired of all that attention
going to her little brothers...

902
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:27,950
so she fixed them.

903
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:31,280
Just like old Hazel Dobkins
fixed her whole family.

904
01:35:31,330 --> 01:35:33,890
Except young Roxy, here,
didn't use a wedding present.

905
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:36,560
She used daddy's razor.

906
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:47,439
Sure makes you wonder
what they talk about...

907
01:35:47,509 --> 01:35:50,499
when they sit in front
of the campfire at night.

908
01:35:50,549 --> 01:35:53,949
You ever met a friend of hers
that hasn't killed somebody?

909
01:35:53,979 --> 01:35:56,979
Must of beat your ordinary,
every day girl talk.

910
01:35:57,014 --> 01:35:59,579
I'm not sure,
anymore, she did it.

911
01:35:59,619 --> 01:36:01,679
Which one we
talking about now?

912
01:36:01,859 --> 01:36:04,948
We know Hazel did it. We
know young Roxy did it.

913
01:36:05,328 --> 01:36:06,518
And the other one...

914
01:36:06,558 --> 01:36:11,898
She's got that magna cum laude
pussy that fried up your brain.

915
01:36:31,017 --> 01:36:33,577
"Oberman, Mark W., Donald M."

916
01:36:34,657 --> 01:36:36,017
Sorry, no "Lisa."

917
01:36:36,317 --> 01:36:38,757
You sure about the year?

918
01:36:38,927 --> 01:36:41,917
Catherine Tramell
graduated in '83.

919
01:36:41,957 --> 01:36:45,727
She said Lisa Oberman
was here at the same time.

920
01:36:48,497 --> 01:36:50,296
Yeah, we have Tramell.

921
01:36:53,736 --> 01:36:55,326
But no Lisa Oberman.

922
01:36:55,376 --> 01:36:57,706
Are you sure? There
can't be a mistake?

923
01:36:59,506 --> 01:37:01,906
Only if you're
making it, Detective.

924
01:37:16,495 --> 01:37:19,295
Hazel, this is Nick. I
told you all about him.

925
01:37:19,325 --> 01:37:21,355
Nick, this is Hazel Dobkins.

926
01:37:21,435 --> 01:37:23,485
You're the
shooter, aren't you?

927
01:37:23,565 --> 01:37:25,535
How are you?

928
01:37:25,565 --> 01:37:28,365
Fine, thank you. Can I
speak to you for a minute?

929
01:37:28,435 --> 01:37:32,735
Would you wait for me in
the car? I'll be right there.

930
01:37:33,945 --> 01:37:35,744
Good-bye, shooter.

931
01:37:37,484 --> 01:37:40,344
You like to hang out
with murderers, or what?

932
01:37:40,414 --> 01:37:43,474
- You know that Roxy was involved...
- Yes, of course, I knew.

933
01:37:43,554 --> 01:37:46,484
I write about unusual people, and
sometimes when I do my research...

934
01:37:46,524 --> 01:37:48,784
I get involved with them.

935
01:37:48,824 --> 01:37:51,414
It happened with you.

936
01:37:52,594 --> 01:37:55,494
Killing isn't like smoking.

937
01:37:55,534 --> 01:37:57,724
You can quit.

938
01:38:00,003 --> 01:38:02,433
I gotta go.

939
01:38:03,633 --> 01:38:05,663
I promised I'd get
her home by 6:00.

940
01:38:05,743 --> 01:38:08,533
She just loves
"America's Most Wanted."

941
01:38:08,573 --> 01:38:12,343
There was no Lisa Oberman
when you were at Berkeley.

942
01:38:12,383 --> 01:38:15,573
What are you doing?
Checking up on me?

943
01:38:15,613 --> 01:38:18,673
For what? I said "Hoberman."

944
01:38:21,523 --> 01:38:25,462
"Hoberman." Lisa
Hoberman, with an H.

945
01:38:26,822 --> 01:38:28,792
You do?

946
01:38:30,802 --> 01:38:33,662
All right. Thank
you very much.

947
01:38:35,632 --> 01:38:39,542
You know I can get my
butt kicked for this.

948
01:38:39,602 --> 01:38:41,772
- You're not even supposed to be here.
- Come on, Sam.

949
01:38:41,842 --> 01:38:44,572
- This is only gonna take a minute.
- Yeah.

950
01:38:53,481 --> 01:38:55,381
Bring it up.

951
01:38:57,761 --> 01:39:00,451
That's Dr. Garner, isn't it?

952
01:39:02,431 --> 01:39:04,761
Bring up '83.

953
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:23,770
You shouldn't leave
your door open.

954
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:28,750
I didn't. There's something
wrong with my lock.

955
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:30,410
What do you want?

956
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:31,609
Tell me about Catherine.

957
01:39:34,529 --> 01:39:37,289
She told you, didn't she?

958
01:39:37,329 --> 01:39:39,819
What did she tell me?

959
01:39:42,669 --> 01:39:45,499
I slept with her
once in school.

960
01:39:45,539 --> 01:39:48,729
I was just a kid.
I was experimenting.

961
01:39:48,809 --> 01:39:52,369
It was just that one time.

962
01:39:52,439 --> 01:39:54,878
She developed a
fixation on me.

963
01:39:55,348 --> 01:39:58,408
She styled her hair like mine, wore
the same kind of clothes as I did.

964
01:39:58,478 --> 01:40:00,468
It scared me.

965
01:40:03,488 --> 01:40:06,418
Isn't that what she told you?

966
01:40:06,488 --> 01:40:08,793
She said it was you.

967
01:40:08,828 --> 01:40:10,818
You dressed like her. You
dyed your hair blonde...

968
01:40:10,898 --> 01:40:12,888
I did dye my hair. It had
nothing to do with her.

969
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:15,698
- I was a redhead for a while too.
- Did you know Noah Goldstein?

970
01:40:15,728 --> 01:40:17,857
- I had him for two classes.
- You saw all the reports.

971
01:40:18,367 --> 01:40:19,667
Phil copied you. You
never said anything!

972
01:40:19,737 --> 01:40:21,527
What am I supposed to say?

973
01:40:21,567 --> 01:40:24,837
"I'm not gay, but I
did fuck your suspect"?

974
01:40:26,737 --> 01:40:31,677
I was embarrassed. It was the
only time I'd been with a woman.

975
01:40:33,477 --> 01:40:35,537
She's really sick, you know.

976
01:40:35,617 --> 01:40:37,447
Do you know what she's doing?

977
01:40:37,487 --> 01:40:40,617
She knows I went to Berkeley.
She knows I knew Noah.

978
01:40:40,686 --> 01:40:42,656
She makes up this
story about me.

979
01:40:42,686 --> 01:40:45,386
She's handing you somebody
who's obsessed with her.

980
01:40:45,426 --> 01:40:47,416
She didn't hand you to me.
She doesn't know who you are.

981
01:40:47,496 --> 01:40:48,896
You told me about
a Lisa Hoberman.

982
01:40:49,366 --> 01:40:52,526
She knows you'd find out who
Lisa is. You're a good cop.

983
01:40:53,736 --> 01:40:55,706
She tell you casually?

984
01:40:55,766 --> 01:40:57,826
Make it seem irrelevant?

985
01:40:59,636 --> 01:41:01,626
Did she tell you in bed?

986
01:41:04,915 --> 01:41:07,405
That's what I'd do.

987
01:41:09,745 --> 01:41:11,685
Why'd you change your name?

988
01:41:11,715 --> 01:41:14,685
I got married. He
called me "Beth."

989
01:41:14,755 --> 01:41:17,315
He was on staff at
the clinic in Salinas.

990
01:41:17,395 --> 01:41:19,585
Didn't last long.

991
01:41:22,725 --> 01:41:25,595
Do you really think that
I could kill someone?

992
01:41:25,665 --> 01:41:27,564
I never even met Johnny Boz!

993
01:41:27,604 --> 01:41:30,894
And what about Nilsen? What
motive would I have to kill him?

994
01:41:31,374 --> 01:41:33,864
- You should get that lock fixed.
- God...

995
01:41:33,904 --> 01:41:37,604
She's evil! She's brilliant!

996
01:42:02,563 --> 01:42:04,868
Did I scare you?

997
01:42:04,903 --> 01:42:07,493
I wanted to surprise you.

998
01:42:07,573 --> 01:42:10,503
- What's wrong?
- I found Lisa Hoberman.

999
01:42:10,573 --> 01:42:12,563
Oh, you did? What's she doing?

1000
01:42:15,812 --> 01:42:18,642
You're not going to
tell me what she's doing.

1001
01:42:18,712 --> 01:42:21,882
- I thought we were done playing games.
- I did too.

1002
01:42:22,352 --> 01:42:23,842
She said you got it backwards.

1003
01:42:23,882 --> 01:42:26,722
She said you styled
your hair like she did.

1004
01:42:26,792 --> 01:42:28,812
And you believed her.

1005
01:42:29,892 --> 01:42:35,692
I had to go to the campus police
and file a report about her.

1006
01:42:35,732 --> 01:42:39,591
- I suppose you still think I kill people too?
- No.

1007
01:42:43,571 --> 01:42:45,471
Liar.

1008
01:42:48,881 --> 01:42:52,711
- Who'd you say you're with?
- Homicide, San Francisco.

1009
01:42:55,481 --> 01:42:57,581
Here we go.

1010
01:42:57,651 --> 01:42:59,620
Kind of.

1011
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:02,180
There was a report about
Lisa Hoberman, January, 1980.

1012
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:04,780
- But it's out of here.
- Who's got it?

1013
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:07,850
One of your guys. Nilsen.

1014
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:10,490
- You know him?
- Yeah.

1015
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,730
Thanks a lot.

1016
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:15,700
Tell him to bring it back.
He's had it a whole year.

1017
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:19,230
So Nilsen had a report on Beth.
You don't know what was in it.

1018
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:21,760
- Catherine told me what was in it.
- If she's telling you the truth.

1019
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:23,569
Gus, don't you get it?

1020
01:43:23,639 --> 01:43:25,639
If Beth killed Johnny
Boz to frame Catherine...

1021
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:27,649
she wouldn't want anybody to
know what happened in Berkeley!

1022
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:30,739
But Nilsen found out about it. That
gives her the motive to kill him.

1023
01:43:30,819 --> 01:43:33,789
How did she know Nilsen
found out, if it happened?

1024
01:43:33,849 --> 01:43:36,249
He probably asked her!

1025
01:43:36,459 --> 01:43:38,819
She'd have to be nuttier
than a 20 pound fruitcake!

1026
01:43:38,889 --> 01:43:41,759
She's not the one who hangs
out with multiple murderers!

1027
01:43:41,799 --> 01:43:44,459
- You're girlfriend is!
- She's a writer! That's her job!

1028
01:43:44,529 --> 01:43:47,628
I don't buy it. There must be somebody
at Berkeley who knows what happened!

1029
01:43:47,698 --> 01:43:49,638
I know what happened!
Catherine told me!

1030
01:43:49,698 --> 01:43:52,758
- Everything she says has checked out!
- You got tweety birds...

1031
01:43:52,838 --> 01:43:54,868
fluttering around
in your head!

1032
01:43:54,938 --> 01:43:57,268
You think you can fuck like
minks, raise rug rats...

1033
01:43:57,438 --> 01:43:59,438
and live happily ever after?

1034
01:43:59,478 --> 01:44:01,448
Oh, man!

1035
01:44:13,527 --> 01:44:15,887
How'd you get in here?

1036
01:44:15,927 --> 01:44:17,797
What's this?

1037
01:44:17,867 --> 01:44:20,927
I decided to give
you a second chance.

1038
01:44:21,267 --> 01:44:25,327
- I missed you.
- I wasn't gone long enough.

1039
01:44:25,507 --> 01:44:27,527
Did you miss me?

1040
01:44:27,607 --> 01:44:29,537
No.

1041
01:44:39,516 --> 01:44:43,346
Why don't you come over
here and tell me no.

1042
01:44:46,326 --> 01:44:48,516
- I've seen them before.
- Yeah?

1043
01:44:48,556 --> 01:44:51,356
Well, you might
not see them again.

1044
01:44:51,526 --> 01:44:53,556
My book's nearly finished.

1045
01:44:53,596 --> 01:44:55,825
My detective's almost dead.

1046
01:44:55,895 --> 01:44:57,695
So I've got time
for a last cigarette?

1047
01:44:57,765 --> 01:44:58,925
Afterwards.

1048
01:45:11,845 --> 01:45:14,615
I've got to do some
research tomorrow morning.

1049
01:45:14,685 --> 01:45:17,655
I'm good at research.
I'll help you.

1050
01:45:17,685 --> 01:45:19,554
No, thanks.

1051
01:45:19,624 --> 01:45:21,714
What are you researching?

1052
01:45:21,794 --> 01:45:23,344
Oh...

1053
01:45:23,554 --> 01:45:25,894
a new ending to your book.

1054
01:45:26,264 --> 01:45:29,254
Oh, really? What's the twist?

1055
01:45:29,334 --> 01:45:33,294
The detective falls
for the wrong girl.

1056
01:45:33,334 --> 01:45:35,864
But he doesn't die.

1057
01:45:37,744 --> 01:45:40,734
So what happens to him?

1058
01:45:41,843 --> 01:45:45,333
They fuck like minks,
raise rug rats...

1059
01:45:45,543 --> 01:45:47,343
and live happily ever after.

1060
01:45:48,853 --> 01:45:50,783
It won't sell.

1061
01:45:51,883 --> 01:45:53,323
Why not?

1062
01:45:54,953 --> 01:45:57,583
Somebody has to die.

1063
01:46:00,263 --> 01:46:01,723
Why?

1064
01:46:02,863 --> 01:46:05,892
Somebody always does.

1065
01:46:22,852 --> 01:46:25,312
Morning. I'm looking
for a Dr. Garner.

1066
01:46:25,352 --> 01:46:28,881
She doesn't work here anymore. She's
in San Francisco with the police.

1067
01:46:28,921 --> 01:46:30,681
Actually, I'm looking
for her husband.

1068
01:46:30,721 --> 01:46:33,881
- He works here too, doesn't he?
- Dr. Joseph Garner?

1069
01:46:33,921 --> 01:46:35,821
- She married?
- You know him?

1070
01:46:35,861 --> 01:46:38,761
He died about five
or six years ago.

1071
01:46:38,801 --> 01:46:42,731
- How did he die?
- He was shot.

1072
01:46:44,801 --> 01:46:46,861
Thank you.

1073
01:46:46,941 --> 01:46:50,810
He was walking home from work.

1074
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:53,370
He only lived a couple
of blocks from the clinic.

1075
01:46:53,410 --> 01:46:54,840
Somebody just drove
by and shot him.

1076
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:58,710
- What was the murder weapon?
- Revolver,.38. Unrecovered.

1077
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:01,410
- Watch yourself.
- Were there any suspects?

1078
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:04,850
No suspects, no
motive. Unsolved.

1079
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:07,380
Was his wife ever a suspect?

1080
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:11,890
One of your guys was down
here from Frisco a year ago.

1081
01:47:12,230 --> 01:47:14,459
He was asking the
same, exact thing.

1082
01:47:14,669 --> 01:47:16,429
You mind telling
me what's going on?

1083
01:47:16,629 --> 01:47:19,259
Routine.

1084
01:47:19,339 --> 01:47:21,274
That's exactly what he said.

1085
01:47:21,309 --> 01:47:24,309
Now I got two of you guys
telling me it's "routine."

1086
01:47:24,344 --> 01:47:26,639
You remember what the
other guy's name was?

1087
01:47:27,779 --> 01:47:31,839
No. I can't really
say that I do.

1088
01:47:31,879 --> 01:47:34,649
Nilsen?

1089
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:36,649
Yeah. That was it.

1090
01:47:38,918 --> 01:47:41,758
- So was she ever a suspect?
- No.

1091
01:47:42,828 --> 01:47:44,318
There was some talk.

1092
01:47:44,358 --> 01:47:46,388
But it never panned out.

1093
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:49,428
- What kind of talk?
- Girlfriend.

1094
01:47:49,628 --> 01:47:51,728
He had a girlfriend?

1095
01:47:51,798 --> 01:47:53,268
No.

1096
01:47:54,908 --> 01:47:56,738
She did.

1097
01:47:58,808 --> 01:48:02,267
But like I said,
it never panned out.

1098
01:48:04,347 --> 01:48:06,837
- Thank you.
- Hope that helped you out.

1099
01:48:07,217 --> 01:48:11,347
Yes, you did. You sure did.

1100
01:48:41,516 --> 01:48:42,776
I missed you.

1101
01:48:44,956 --> 01:48:46,315
I finished my research.

1102
01:48:46,385 --> 01:48:49,755
- I finished my book.
- So how does it end?

1103
01:48:50,825 --> 01:48:52,795
I told you.

1104
01:48:52,855 --> 01:48:54,795
She kills him.

1105
01:48:57,465 --> 01:48:59,555
Good-bye, Nick.

1106
01:49:01,305 --> 01:49:03,355
Good-bye?

1107
01:49:03,435 --> 01:49:06,335
Yeah. I finished my book.

1108
01:49:08,805 --> 01:49:10,864
Didn't you hear me?

1109
01:49:10,944 --> 01:49:12,774
Your character's dead.

1110
01:49:14,584 --> 01:49:16,204
Good-bye.

1111
01:49:20,484 --> 01:49:22,544
What do you want, flowers?

1112
01:49:22,584 --> 01:49:24,884
I'll send you an
autographed copy.

1113
01:49:26,854 --> 01:49:29,454
What is this,
some kind of joke?

1114
01:49:34,293 --> 01:49:35,493
You playing a game here?

1115
01:49:36,603 --> 01:49:38,533
The games are over.

1116
01:49:40,303 --> 01:49:41,773
You were right.

1117
01:49:41,843 --> 01:49:46,273
It was the fuck of
the century, shooter.

1118
01:49:59,552 --> 01:50:00,952
I'll be right there.

1119
01:50:28,551 --> 01:50:30,521
Catherine Tramell's
roommate, freshman year?

1120
01:50:30,551 --> 01:50:34,511
I just got a call from her.
She's in Oakland. Come on!

1121
01:50:36,621 --> 01:50:38,611
I've been phoning people
from her dorm all day.

1122
01:50:38,831 --> 01:50:40,451
She must've heard I
was trying to reach her.

1123
01:50:40,531 --> 01:50:44,520
Says she knows all about
Catherine and Lisa Hoberman.

1124
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:48,460
You feeling okay?

1125
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:51,970
Here's something else.

1126
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:55,570
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist
has an office on Van Ness.

1127
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:57,510
Guess who he
shares space with?

1128
01:50:57,540 --> 01:51:00,380
Dr. Elizabeth Garner.

1129
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:06,509
What in the hell's
the matter with you?

1130
01:51:19,499 --> 01:51:22,529
I'll be in suite 405.

1131
01:51:24,539 --> 01:51:26,869
- Where the hell you going?
- I'm going with you.

1132
01:51:26,939 --> 01:51:29,403
You're on leave, Hoss.

1133
01:51:29,438 --> 01:51:31,868
It ain't gonna take long.

1134
01:53:54,442 --> 01:53:55,712
Freeze!

1135
01:53:55,782 --> 01:53:57,412
What are you doing here?

1136
01:53:57,482 --> 01:53:59,382
Put your fucking hands up!

1137
01:53:59,452 --> 01:54:01,382
I got a message
to meet Gus here.

1138
01:54:01,452 --> 01:54:03,542
- Where is he?
- Don't you move!

1139
01:54:03,622 --> 01:54:06,422
I know about your husband!
You still like girls, Beth?

1140
01:54:07,462 --> 01:54:10,761
- What?
- Take you hands out of your pocket!

1141
01:54:10,831 --> 01:54:13,421
- Take them out!
- What's wrong with you?

1142
01:54:13,501 --> 01:54:14,791
Take them out!

1143
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:36,650
I loved you.

1144
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:54,840
Oh, God!

1145
01:55:17,829 --> 01:55:20,558
What made you
think she had a gun?

1146
01:55:22,328 --> 01:55:25,818
What was she doing here?
What was Gus doing here?

1147
01:55:29,508 --> 01:55:31,438
Lieutenant.

1148
01:55:59,437 --> 01:56:00,767
One of ours.

1149
01:56:03,567 --> 01:56:06,266
Jesus.

1150
01:56:06,336 --> 01:56:08,676
We'll have to check
Beth's apartment.

1151
01:56:11,746 --> 01:56:13,476
Thirty-eight
caliber revolver.

1152
01:56:13,546 --> 01:56:16,346
In the bookcase,
behind some books.

1153
01:56:18,686 --> 01:56:21,776
Have ballistics
check it for Nilsen.

1154
01:56:21,826 --> 01:56:25,446
Lieutenant. You
better come in here.

1155
01:56:53,754 --> 01:56:56,554
I guess that's it.

1156
01:57:11,704 --> 01:57:16,363
Definitely not. We feel all the
evidence points to Dr. Elizabeth Garner.

1157
01:57:16,403 --> 01:57:18,393
We checked. It's her size.

1158
01:57:18,473 --> 01:57:20,633
She probably heard you on the
stairway and dumped this stuff.

1159
01:57:20,673 --> 01:57:22,443
There's no suite 405.

1160
01:57:22,513 --> 01:57:24,443
Catherine Tramell's
freshman roommate is dead.

1161
01:57:24,513 --> 01:57:26,453
She died of leukemia
two years ago.

1162
01:57:26,513 --> 01:57:29,143
- Here's a fax of her death certificate.
- What about Salinas?

1163
01:57:29,353 --> 01:57:32,183
Yeah, hold on. Jack!

1164
01:57:33,723 --> 01:57:35,783
Did you check Nilsen's office
for any files on Beth Garner?

1165
01:57:35,863 --> 01:57:39,722
No police report from Berkeley.
Nothing at all about Salinas.

1166
01:57:39,762 --> 01:57:42,592
I'm back.

1167
01:57:42,632 --> 01:57:44,492
Great.

1168
01:57:44,562 --> 01:57:47,762
Ballistics says the. 38 we found in
her apartment was used on Nilsen.

1169
01:57:47,832 --> 01:57:50,362
No registration. They're
checking with Salinas.

1170
01:57:50,402 --> 01:57:53,202
The ice pick was the same brand
and model as the Boz weapon.

1171
01:57:53,412 --> 01:57:55,642
Checked the tape machines at Dr.
Garner's apartment and office...

1172
01:57:55,712 --> 01:57:57,372
both here and the
one on Van Ness.

1173
01:57:57,412 --> 01:57:58,742
There's no message
from Gus on any of them.

1174
01:57:58,782 --> 01:58:00,752
The tape in her
apartment was unused.

1175
01:58:00,812 --> 01:58:03,581
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist
says he thinks he remembers...

1176
01:58:03,651 --> 01:58:06,741
Dr. Garner and Boz meeting at
a Christmas party at his house.

1177
01:58:06,821 --> 01:58:08,791
Ayear ago.

1178
01:58:11,691 --> 01:58:14,721
You just can't tell
about people, can you?

1179
01:58:16,501 --> 01:58:20,801
Even the ones you think
you know inside and out.

1180
01:58:23,841 --> 01:58:26,600
Congratulations, Curran.

1181
01:59:26,298 --> 01:59:28,198
I heard about what happened.

1182
01:59:30,498 --> 01:59:33,468
On TV.

1183
01:59:44,477 --> 01:59:48,277
I can't allow myself
to care about you.

1184
01:59:51,317 --> 01:59:54,257
I can't allow myself...

1185
01:59:54,287 --> 01:59:56,817
to care.

1186
01:59:59,866 --> 02:00:02,266
I don't want to do this.

1187
02:00:02,336 --> 02:00:05,196
Please. I don't
want to do this.

1188
02:00:06,666 --> 02:00:09,506
I lose everybody.

1189
02:00:09,576 --> 02:00:12,506
I don't want to lose you.

1190
02:01:57,871 --> 02:01:59,841
What do we do now?

1191
02:02:01,611 --> 02:02:04,911
Fuck like minks...

1192
02:02:05,251 --> 02:02:08,651
raise rug rats and
live happily ever after.

1193
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:21,250
I hate rug rats.

1194
02:02:24,270 --> 02:02:27,240
Fuck like minks,
forget the rug rats...

1195
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:30,270
and live happily ever after.

1196
02:02:31,305 --> 02:03:31,599
