00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:50,969
Moonee!

3
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,388
Scooty!

4
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:55,557
What?

5
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:56,808
Moonee!

6
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:00,937
Scooty!

7
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:03,857
What?

8
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:06,025
Moonee!

9
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:10,405
Scooty!

10
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:14,868
What?

11
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:17,787
Freshies at the Future!

12
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,488
- Scooty, wait up!
- No, guys, this way. Come on.

13
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,834
That one over there. The blue one.

14
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,181
I can get it farther than you, Moonee.

15
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:01,850
Yeah, right.

16
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:09,732
I got two points ahead of you, Moonee.

17
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:12,277
- I got...
- No. I got 100 points.

18
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:13,695
That's not possible.

19
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:18,783
Bet you...

20
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,036
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna get the front.

21
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,833
- Ooh!
- I got the windshield.

22
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,209
I got the top.

23
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,630
What the fuck is... What?

24
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,172
Hey!

25
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,175
Stop that!

26
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,177
Come on. Are you kidding me, guys?

27
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,889
- Go home, ratchet bitch!
- That's my car!

28
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:42,307
- Hey!
- Go on, shit! Shit!

29
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:44,225
You are shit!

30
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,896
Get your ass down here right now
and clean it up.

31
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:49,689
Shit! Shit! Shit!

32
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:53,985
I'm not playing with you. Get your fucking
ass down here right now and clean it up.

33
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:57,572
- Clean this shit up right now.
- You're not the boss of me!

34
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:58,781
Where your parents at?

35
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:00,700
Hey! Hey!

36
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,702
Oh.

37
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:07,290
- He spit on me.
- It wasn't him. It was me, stupid thot!

38
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:08,976
I'm gonna go up there
and tell your parents.

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,419
Try it, biotch. I don't live here!

40
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,754
Ratchet!

41
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:15,423
- Hey!
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

42
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,549
Hey!

43
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:21,179
Stay right there. Hey!

44
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,472
Go, go, go, go.

45
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:26,017
- Moonee.
- Hey! Get over here!

46
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,770
Come clean this shit up right now.

47
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:29,854
Dicky!

48
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:33,107
Get your ass upstairs right now.

49
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,360
- Dad!
- Now!

50
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,029
Hey! Is that your kid?

51
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,891
- Him and his friends just spit on my car.
- Get over here.

52
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,123
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

53
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,547
Yeah. Yeah.

54
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,216
Yeah.

55
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,595
Mmm, yeah. Mmm, yeah. Mmm, yeah.

56
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:15,482
Thanks.

57
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:20,947
Whoo!

58
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,579
Hey, hey, hey.

59
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:29,998
Take your shoes off.

60
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:32,333
- Both of you.
- Hey, where's the Slinky?

61
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:33,501
Got it.

62
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,211
Here... Like this.

63
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,676
- I wanna speak to the manager right now.
- May I help you with something?

64
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,760
Are you the manager?

65
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:47,056
- Yeah?
- Coming!

66
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,063
- Yeah?
- Gotta talk to your mom.

67
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,359
- Moonee, who was that?
- Nobody.

68
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:04,949
- Shit, Moonee. What did you two do?
- Nothing.

69
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,036
Yeah?

70
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:10,079
Halley, this woman's from next door,

71
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:12,790
and she said Moonee
did something to her car.

72
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,333
You in 322?

73
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,918
No, FutureLand.

74
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:16,919
- Oh.
- Okay.

75
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:20,423
Her and her friend Scoot
spit all over my kid and my car.

76
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:23,801
- It's Scooty!
- It's Scooty, not Scoot.

77
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,678
You saw them do this?

78
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:26,928
Yes, I did.

79
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:29,616
And their friend's father told me
that they're always pulling this shit.

80
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,683
That's not true.

81
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:31,601
Which friend?

82
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:34,604
Whatever. They spit on my car,
and they spit on my kid.

83
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,355
Okay. Okay. Okay.

84
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,484
Halley... One, sort this out.

85
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:43,029
Two, you smoke in the room again,
you're out of here.

86
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,822
- I'm not smoking.
- Bye, Bobby.

87
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:47,450
- Last warning, Halley.
- Yeah, well, I'm not.

88
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:49,327
Asshole.

89
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:52,413
Come on, you two.
Go get some paper towels.

90
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,084
- Whoa.
- Bertha!

91
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,962
We need paper towels!
We need paper towels!

92
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:07,636
Okay.

93
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,024
These two yours?

94
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,401
These? No. They're not mine.

95
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,363
Well, they're mine now.

96
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:29,242
My daughter made me a grandmother
when she was 15.

97
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:34,330
So I'm just taking care of them until
she stops acting like her stupid father.

98
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,210
When'd you move in, Grandma?

99
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,838
That's my goober. My goober!

100
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,342
Oh, my God!

101
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:48,970
You got another one of those?

102
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:02,066
- Hey, girl!
- Hey!

103
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,193
- You had another one?
- Yeah.

104
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:05,945
When was this?

105
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:08,030
- Stop!
- Hey. Hey, guys.

106
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,658
You're having too much fun,
and it's not supposed to be fun.

107
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,160
It's supposed to be work, okay?

108
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,203
- It's summer, let them have fun.
- Get on it.

109
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:15,927
- No worries.
- Let them have a good time.

110
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,958
- It's summer, what do you want?
- I think it was very disrespectful.

111
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,710
Very disrespectful.

112
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:21,836
This is not okay.

113
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,021
Clearly we have different
versions of disrespectful.

114
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,672
- What's your name?
- Jancey.

115
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:28,134
Jancey? What kind of name is Jancey?

116
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,636
Hey, Jancey.

117
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,265
It would be a whole lot easier
if someone were to help us.

118
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,743
- They're doing you a favor.
- I am ashamed for you right now.

119
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:37,894
Are you serious?

120
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:39,812
- Doing me a favor.
- Okay, well...

121
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:41,981
It didn't need that kind of car wash.

122
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:45,026
Hey, hey.
Jancey, honey, what are you doing?

123
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:47,361
- I'm cleaning up!
- Yeah!

124
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:50,615
Jance, let them clean it up by themselves,
okay? That's not your job.

125
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:53,618
No. They ask-ed me to, so I'm gonna do it.

126
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,204
- No, I don't want you doing that. Okay?
- Let her help.

127
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,332
We should clean the inside, too.
It's a mess.

128
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:02,293
You think they're gonna get along
if they're not gonna, like, socialize?

129
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,837
- That's what they do here.
- Yeah. Social kids, like you.

130
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:07,340
Yep, like me.
What are you trying to say, lady?

131
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,634
I'll spark you up,
'cause you seem stressed.

132
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,135
I will help you out.

133
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:12,845
Maybe that's what I need.

134
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:16,974
I need to lighten up, I need to light up,
and I need to get laid.

135
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:20,186
Same here, girl. I feel you.

136
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,939
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

137
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:24,690
- My turn.
- Okay.

138
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:26,317
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

139
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:02,978
Yo!

140
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:20,621
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, mama.

141
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:21,831
Hi, Miss Ashley.

142
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,332
Here you go.

143
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,416
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

144
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,921
Hey, yo, my mom wants to know
if you want to go to OBT tonight.

145
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,756
- It's Saturday, right?
- Yeah.

146
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,049
Okay, then, we're gonna go.

147
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:33,591
Bye, guys.

148
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,112
- Bye.
- Go have fun. Be careful, okay?

149
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,345
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye.

150
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,349
No maple syrup.

151
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,727
- She didn't pack any for you?
- No.

152
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,814
My mom makes mistakes all the time.

153
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:49,567
Well, you need to let her know
we like the maple syrup.

154
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,028
I always tell her, and then she forgets.

155
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,198
Oh, look!

156
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:06,584
- Middle finger!
- You're a wild animal.

157
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,300
Hey.

158
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,968
Hey, guys!

159
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:18,387
- Hey, girl!
- Thank you so much!

160
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:20,973
No problem. Of course, of course.

161
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:22,409
- Let me know if they misbehave.
- Of course.

162
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,935
Guys, behave, okay? Seriously.

163
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,438
<i>- How you been?
- I've been good.</i>

164
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,732
I've been good. Working, you know.

165
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,151
Taking care of the baby. You already know.

166
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,069
- Hi, babe!
- Hi!

167
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:33,986
So good to see you.

168
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,114
Hey!

169
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,036
Hey!

170
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:43,996
What's popping, Don?

171
00:11:56,592 --> 00:12:00,429
- They fucking chose Simone.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

172
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:04,850
I know, right? I've been there way longer
than that bitch. I can't even believe it.

173
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:07,686
Fuck that!

174
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:12,399
The second that I'm manager,
you're totally hired, Ma. I got you.

175
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:17,238
Don't be tight. Let's just have
a good night. Let's have a good night.

176
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,658
Smile!

177
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:24,703
Most of those ratchet-ass bitches
were doing extras, you know?

178
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:25,996
In the backroom?

179
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,957
I'm not doing extras.

180
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,918
I'm dancing for tips. That's what I do.
I said no.

181
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:34,296
Two days later, with no warning,
Hector fires me.

182
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,882
After not letting me up on stage
all fucking night.

183
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:39,098
- Halley, I'm sorry, but...
- Fucking bullshit.

184
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,054
Okay. I'm sorry to say
that's gonna affect your TANF.

185
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:43,639
No shit. That's why I'm here.

186
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:47,268
Okay, Halley. Please make
a concerted effort to put in 30 hours.

187
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,812
Ha! You find me 30 hours.

188
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:53,065
I have applications in at every shithole
up and down the strip.

189
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:54,859
And the parks ain't gonna hire me.

190
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,819
Okay. So can you please
control your language

191
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,421
in front of her and everyone else in here?

192
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,049
Can you just give me some bus passes?
Why did I even come out here?

193
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,575
Halley, please. I'm trying to...

194
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:21,385
Hi. Could Dicky come out and play?

195
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,971
After what you guys pulled,
he's punished for a week.

196
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:30,311
- Where are we going?
- Just come on.

197
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,278
Like, lady, open it!

198
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:41,405
Hello there.

199
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,488
What?

200
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,074
Could Jancey come out and play?

201
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,845
What, you're gonna take her
to spit on someone else's car?

202
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,871
No. We're just playing.

203
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,331
Yeah. Just playing.

204
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:54,043
- What are you playing?
- We're just playing!

205
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,044
Okay, what are you playing?

206
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:57,167
You didn't answer my question.
What are you playing?

207
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,843
- Relax, your daughter is safe in my hands.
- And my hands, too.

208
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:08,474
Jance? Do you wanna go play
with the kids from the purple place?

209
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:12,477
I wanna play.

210
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,438
I wanna play, too.

211
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:20,068
Whoa!

212
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,997
Hey, guys, don't you live over here?

213
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:35,542
Yeah but, we have more things
to show you.

214
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:36,626
Come on!

215
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:41,173
I don't... I don't love oranges.

216
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:43,259
I don't love oranges.

217
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,553
I... I love orange soda.

218
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:48,764
We squoosh...

219
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:57,231
But the only thing
I don't like about oranges is the lid.

220
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,358
- You mean the peel?
- The lid.

221
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,151
Yeah, that's called a peel.

222
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,032
Don't you think
we're going too far?

223
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:11,996
No. Just come on.
Don't be a... Don't be a loser.

224
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:15,499
Don't call me that. But, okay!

225
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,130
And this is where we get free ice cream.

226
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:22,881
- Really?
- Yeah.

227
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,008
Follow me.

228
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:27,177
- Could we have some money?
- Some change?

229
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,597
- Do we have enough?
- I'm counting.

230
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,272
Let's go.

231
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:44,778
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, miss.

232
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:48,073
Could you give us some change, please?
We need to buy ice cream.

233
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:51,368
'Cause we don't have any money.
We just have five cents.

234
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:54,955
- Yeah. We just have five cents.
- And the doctor said we have asthma,

235
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,082
- and we gotta eat ice cream right away.
- Yeah.

236
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,043
- Yeah, my doctor too.
- Ice cream.

237
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,294
Guys.

238
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:02,296
- We're not lying.
- It's fine.

239
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,673
- Thank you very much!
- Here you go.

240
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:05,883
- Come on.
- Let's go.

241
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:06,966
Come on!

242
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,763
- Whoo!
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Hello?

243
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,351
Oh. Ew!

244
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,147
Get that thing, girl.

245
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,859
- I feel like I'm...
- Okay. Wanna see the boss?

246
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,155
Hey!

247
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:31,992
My turn.

248
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:38,082
And because you're new,
I'm going to give the last bite to you.

249
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:44,797
The man who lives up here
fought in some wars. And he drinks beer.

250
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:48,008
This guy has a disease
that makes his feet large.

251
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:52,221
Oh, and no one uses
the elevator 'cause it smells like pee.

252
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:55,224
The man who lives in here
gets arrested a lot.

253
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:59,520
This... This woman in here
thinks she's married to Jesus.

254
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,563
Oh, watch out, watch out for the water.

255
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,400
'Cause guess what.
I went to the hospital one time.

256
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,444
These are the rooms
we're not supposed to go in.

257
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,905
But let's go anyway!

258
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,330
Oh, fuck!

259
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Bobby!

260
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,640
What's going on?
Where's the power?

261
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,560
Bobby!

262
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:43,397
Hey, what the fuck, man?
I pay my rent, $1,000 a month.

263
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,190
Can't fucking get electricity.

264
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,109
I'm on it! I'm on it! Folks, come on.

265
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,236
Come on, give me a minute.

266
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,947
- It's gonna be all right.
- It's the hottest day.

267
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,241
I'm gonna get your power working.
I know. I know.

268
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,660
I can't rush any faster than I'm going.

269
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,495
- What's wrong?
- What did Bobby do now?

270
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,307
Trauma's over, folks.
You got your power back.

271
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:23,812
Can use your TVs, VCRs, AC, what have you.

272
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,023
Have a nice day!

273
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,941
Love you, Bobby!

274
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,277
I love you too.

275
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,531
Try paying the bills, Bobby.

276
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,700
You're due too, brother.

277
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:44,833
Crock pots, hot plates. These rooms are
not designed for extended stay, Gloria.

278
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,418
You know that, for fucking sake.

279
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,146
- What do you want us to do?
- I pay a lot of...

280
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,064
The electric was out
for five minutes, that's it.

281
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,924
Yeah, I want a discount for this week.

282
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,727
Why don't you just check out
and go down to the fucking Wishing Star?

283
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,432
Hmm.

284
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,686
Mm-hmm.

285
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,857
I like Whale. He's nice.

286
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,486
Well, he's not nice to me!

287
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,072
Look.

288
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,657
Daddy...

289
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,149
Moonee, you're not gonna get that?

290
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,586
- Yeah?
- Halley, open the door.

291
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,130
Fucking A. What'd you do now?

292
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,758
Open the door, Halley.

293
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,176
Yeah?

294
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:43,058
I got a videotape of the kids
illegally entering the utility room.

295
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,685
Don't act guilty, okay?

296
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:49,565
Hey, Scooty? Did you hear
what I just said to her? Okay.

297
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,233
I got it. Imma talk to her.

298
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,819
Happens again, you're outta here.

299
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,280
It's only the second week of the summer,

300
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,074
and there's already been
a dead fish in the pool...

301
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,786
We were doing an experiment.
We were trying to get it back alive!

302
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,622
- That wasn't my idea.
- And water balloons thrown at tourists.

303
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,040
You can't fuck with tourists.

304
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,209
- They didn't tip us.
- Are you serious?

305
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,837
- No...
- Oh, my God, this is unacceptable.

306
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,716
I've failed as a mother, Moonee.
You've disgraced me.

307
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,135
- Halley...
- Yeah, Mom. You're a disgrace.

308
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,762
And, I'm gonna talk to Ashley, by the way.

309
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:24,391
When your friend
puts you in charge of her kid,

310
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:27,978
that kid becomes your responsibility.

311
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:29,938
You ain't taking responsibility.

312
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:32,182
And you got that one too.
She's from FutureLand, right?

313
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,735
Oh, whatevs. You gotta relax, my man.

314
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,279
You gonna redo my expense reports
with your whatevs?

315
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:40,073
Your kid killed my night.
I wanted to watch the ballgame.

316
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:42,826
You gonna pay me for three hours
that I gotta work later?

317
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:46,413
Hey, guys,
pay the man for his three hours.

318
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,707
I don't have any money.

319
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,208
We don't have any money.

320
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,502
- You're shit outta luck.
- Speaking of which...

321
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,963
You haven't given me this week's rent yet.

322
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,132
You don't think I know that? Chill.

323
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,519
Thank you.

324
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,774
- You done here?
- Yeah.

325
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,069
- Thank you.
- Watch those kids.

326
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,572
I think I wanna go home now.

327
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:29,665
Wait. Uh, hold on. I, uh...
Sir, I think we're at the wrong place.

328
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,708
This the address you gave me.

329
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,336
What did he say?

330
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,340
No, I-I-I... There's a problem.
Uh... This is not where we're staying.

331
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,217
Hey, you wanna check the address?

332
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,763
We are going to the Magic Kingdom...

333
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:48,308
You said you booked a hotel
at the Magic Kingdom.

334
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:52,646
That everything was taken care of.

335
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,440
What is this,
we are not even on Disney property.

336
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:57,484
Shit. Joao booked it for me. I don't know.

337
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:01,780
You had your assistant
book our honeymoon hotel?

338
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,491
What's going on? How can I help?

339
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:07,119
Look. They made the reservation online...

340
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,459
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

341
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,507
Hey, what's up, man?

342
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,092
Yeah!

343
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,012
Ooh. Nice bags.

344
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,808
- Are those guys tourists?
- Hey, man.

345
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,102
I'm gonna have to charge you wait time.

346
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,270
I'm missing calls.

347
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,942
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll get the new address. One second.

348
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:42,237
Look, just call the company, all right?
Just call the company...

349
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,952
- She looks pretty.
- Yeah.

350
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:52,330
But I feel bad for her,
'cause she's about to cry.

351
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,127
I can always tell
when adults are about to cry.

352
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,382
You can tell that?

353
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,760
Yep. 'Cause look what I'm drawing.

354
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,223
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

355
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:11,391
What's up, Bobby?

356
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,268
- It's almost midnight.
- Get your bags.

357
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,313
The only room you're gonna find
is a single along this stretch.

358
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,566
I offered them a AAA discount.
She doesn't want...

359
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,736
See my wife, there? Okay? She's Brazilian.

360
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,571
Brazilians love Disney.

361
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,758
She's been coming here
since she was a kid, all right?

362
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:29,326
And her dream
is to have her honeymoon at Disney.

363
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,703
- Everybody...
- Ma'am, they're just trying to get a tip.

364
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,079
Yeah, tips are grateful.

365
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:33,997
- Hey, kids. Kids.
- What are these stray children

366
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,915
rummaging about?

367
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,875
- Come on.
- This is a welfare, slum motel.

368
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,060
- Leave her alone.
- We're spending our honeymoon

369
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,669
in a gypsy project?

370
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,214
Find another place.

371
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,299
Check the Polynesian first.

372
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:45,926
Or the Grand Floridian.

373
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,052
I told you.

374
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,988
- Leave her alone.
- We're spending our honeymoon

375
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:49,846
The resorts are booked.

376
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,431
I'm not staying here.

377
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:11,576
Does this have to be here?

378
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,415
Guests come through this door,
for Christ's sake, Bobby.

379
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,169
Will you go talk to her?
Tell her to go to the back.

380
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,253
Yes, sir.

381
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:25,298
Excuse me.

382
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,609
- Um, hi.
- Who's in charge here?

383
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:27,467
Yeah, that's me.

384
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,385
- Hi.
- Hi.

385
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,512
Could you move the van
to the back of the building?

386
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,132
To the back of the building.

387
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,850
- So right behind these stairs right there.
- Excuse me! Excuse me!

388
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:37,203
- What would you like?
- I want that. I want that. I want that.

389
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:38,227
You got it.

390
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,033
- Enjoy your day.
- Thanks, thanks, thanks.

391
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:44,776
- I want... that. That, that, that. Thanks.
- Of course. Yeah.

392
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,445
And I'll take the raspberry croissants.

393
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,906
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Thanks.

394
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,866
Have a nice day.

395
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,410
Have a blessed day, sir.
Thank you so much.

396
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,096
Okay. Yeah. Let's get it packed up.

397
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,480
Okay. Let's go. Show me the books.

398
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,417
Watch. Watch this. Watch. Watch.

399
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,754
Watch, watch, watch. Watch. Watch!

400
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:05,839
Stop!

401
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:15,265
Ooh, spider. Let's see if it farts.

402
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,269
Oh, fuck.

403
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:23,064
I would have worn gloves
if I knew there was bedbugs.

404
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,316
What?

405
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,680
I would have worn gloves
if you told me there was bedbugs.

406
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,366
Well, the purple looks nice.

407
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,494
- Yeah.
- How much did that put you back?

408
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:40,290
Well, Narek spent about 20k on it.

409
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,542
You can't afford an exterminator?

410
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,837
- Huh?
- I don't know.

411
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:52,010
Hey. Hey.

412
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:55,889
Uh, you should be using longer strips.
It works better.

413
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:07,484
- Whatcha doing?
- Top secret.

414
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:11,071
- Really?
- Guys, I need you outta here.

415
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,990
- You guys are boring anyway.
- Yeah, I know.

416
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:15,616
Catch ya later.

417
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:32,509
Fuck.

418
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,389
Shit.

419
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:06,209
- I wanna play it.
- Guys, share.

420
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,961
Share. Come on. Let her play it one time.

421
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:10,463
- You gotta...
- Help her though.

422
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:12,966
- Let me help.
- No, hold on.

423
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,718
- Let her figure it out.
- No, stop.

424
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,001
Scooty, let her figure it out.

425
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,847
No. she gotta play that game
that we were playing. That...

426
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,973
No, I don't.

427
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,600
No, she doesn't.
Let her do whatever she wants.

428
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,127
Thanks for calling The Magic Castle.
It's Amber.

429
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,547
Yeah. We sure do.

430
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:54,591
Thirty-eight dollars a night.

431
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:58,720
Well, we're here all night.

432
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,221
Yeah.

433
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,558
All righty. Thanks a lot.

434
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,353
- Okay, out.
- But...

435
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,732
- I warned ya, one drip and you're out.
- Oh, come on!

436
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:13,693
- Out, now.
- It's gonna melt outside.

437
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:16,446
Obviously, it's melting inside, too.

438
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:17,529
- But, Bobby...
- Out.

439
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:21,367
Thank you very much.

440
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:22,786
You're not welcome!

441
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,500
Bobby could be such a shitty.

442
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:30,334
True.

443
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:40,261
Gloria!

444
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:44,891
I wanna knock, I wanna knock,
I wanna knock.

445
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:49,270
- We need Jancey.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoa!

446
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,397
One light knock will do, guys.

447
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,565
I see her!

448
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,818
Come on, Jancey, come on!

449
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:01,157
Remember last time, she fell
in the pool 'cause she was dancing?

450
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,409
Come on, Scooty!

451
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:06,537
Come on!

452
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:08,665
Come on Moonee, come on!

453
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,042
- Coming!
- Scooty!

454
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:13,043
Hey, look!

455
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:17,465
No, we have to...

456
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:22,137
They look so funny.

457
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:28,309
I'm doing the tango.
I'm doing the jango.

458
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:29,978
Guys!

459
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,355
- Guys.
- Come on!

460
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:33,940
Guys, wait!

461
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,694
Come on! I see her.

462
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,950
Right there.
Hey, let's see what she's doing.

463
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:46,161
- Stretching her legs.
- Guys!

464
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:47,787
Guys, she's stretching her legs.

465
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:52,041
- Moonee. Moonee, come on. Moonee.
- Coming!

466
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:57,172
- Look at her.
- Hey, guys, come on. Right there.

467
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,008
Come on!

468
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:05,305
Look.

469
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:14,189
Boobies. Boobies.
Boobies. Boobies.

470
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:18,151
Hey! Her boobies are so big
that I can rub my face in them.

471
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,783
Banana boobs, banana boobs, banana boobs.

472
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:28,661
- Guys, Bobby!
- Bobby! Duck!

473
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:29,787
Oh, no!

474
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:32,498
Get down. Scooty.

475
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,421
Gloria.

476
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:40,882
We talked about this before. Cover up.

477
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,509
- Cover what up?
- You know what I'm talking about.

478
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:45,845
- I do not know.
- These kids don't need...

479
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:49,974
- What kids are here? There's no kids here.
- Kids are right over there.

480
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:55,980
- Oh. They should be in school, kids.
- It's summer break.

481
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:00,860
- Did he catch us?
- I think he did.

482
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:02,487
Can you read? What's that say?

483
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,656
- "Pool rules."
- No, the other one.

484
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:10,536
- Oh. No tits allowed. No, what?
- No alcoholic beverages in pool area.

485
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,040
Okay, I'll do that, but I still wanna
go topless with my big titties.

486
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:14,999
Gloria.

487
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,125
Oh!

488
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,586
I think she's having a talk with him.

489
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,005
Let me go look, guys. Get down.

490
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,633
No, I will... I'll go.

491
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,009
You're a beautiful woman...

492
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,178
Oh, no. Bobby's gonna make her...

493
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:33,351
- Just put them away. Cover them up.
- Cover the fuck up, you cover yourself up.

494
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,019
Does this happen all the time?

495
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:37,605
Yep. And it's great.

496
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:40,191
- This is what you gotta do.
- Ah!

497
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:41,752
- Hey! Uh-oh.
- That's the way it works here.

498
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,987
Uh-oh, he's about... Call the sheriff.

499
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,446
- He just touched my tit.
- Bobby!

500
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,241
Bobby, boobies.

501
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:51,119
- Go back to your room. Go.
- He molested me, Officer.

502
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:52,829
I'm gonna sue this fucking motel,

503
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:56,207
with this fucking pervert
that just touched my fucking titties.

504
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,543
Hey, Gloria, rub 'em.

505
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:03,464
- Rub your boobs on his face so he can ge...
- Get the hell outta here!

506
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:15,435
Kids, out.

507
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:17,186
Stop!

508
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:18,604
- He in?
- Yeah.

509
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:23,568
No, that's not how you do it.

510
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:27,613
- Ice machine.
- Yeah, well, it can't be fixed. But I'm...

511
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:29,449
- Three months.
- We need ice!

512
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:31,302
- Three months. Three months.
- I know.

513
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:32,493
Uh, Patrice?

514
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:37,790
Uh... Keep an eye on 151. There's been
traffic in and out of there all day.

515
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:43,087
- Really?
- Okay, okay.

516
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:45,089
I'll take care of it in the morning.

517
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:48,593
- I can't whistle.
- You can't whistle?

518
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:51,471
You're going to have to train him, Bobby.

519
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,014
Stop it!

520
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:15,577
Time to go.

521
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:22,043
Come on. Let's go.

522
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,798
What the fuck is you talking about?
I paid my room for a week now.

523
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:29,175
I'm not leaving the property.
I don't care.

524
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,594
- You're breaking the rules.
- Nobody's breaking rules.

525
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:32,553
What are you talking about?

526
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,490
How would you like it
if I called the sheriff's office?

527
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:35,348
Oh, yeah?

528
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,451
- You're gonna call the sheriff's office?
- Then we can figure things out.

529
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:40,853
- Oh, really? Really?
- Your man knows what the story is.

530
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:43,231
Mom, can we get this one?

531
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,650
No, we're gonna gotta get the <i>fugazi</i> ones.

532
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,402
We have to look at these boxes, okay?

533
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:53,658
If I buy more than 20,
can you give me a discount?

534
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:56,744
This is wholesale.

535
00:33:57,078 --> 00:34:00,164
Mom, what about this one?
You can smell like Justin Bieber.

536
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:11,509
Hey, hey. We're selling perfume.

537
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,302
- Yeah, this one.
- No, listen...

538
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:15,596
It'll make your wife smell really good.

539
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:21,394
- You have Jimmy Choo?
- Yeah, it's amazing. It's only $20.

540
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:25,022
They're so much more expensive
in the store, it's a really good deal.

541
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,567
- Do you wanna buy some perfume?
- Ma'am?

542
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,736
- Do you wanna buy some perfume?
- Not really. She might.

543
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,657
No? It smells like designer.
We're having a really good deal.

544
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,033
Yeah.

545
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,886
- This one...
- Would you like to buy some perfume?

546
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,705
Yeah. This one will make all the girls
flirt on you.

547
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:45,084
I have samples if you wanna try some, but
we have a whole bunch of different ones.

548
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:47,628
Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

549
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:50,423
- Yes!
- Girl! Woot, woot!

550
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,843
Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

551
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:58,973
Seriously, if you're gonna be late again,
you gotta let me know.

552
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:03,561
- It was due yesterday.
- Yeah, that's right. It was due yesterday.

553
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,481
Whatevs. Why you gotta count it,
like I'm broke?

554
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:11,527
- I just gotta make sure.
- Gotta make sure what?

555
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:14,030
It's the right amount.
It's a simple thing.

556
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,574
I just counted it. I can't count?
You think I can't count?

557
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:20,536
Listen. Honey. Honey. I trust you.

558
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,122
- Do you?
- Yep. Uh...

559
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:26,042
So then put that in your...

560
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,335
May I count it?

561
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,836
May I count it?

562
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:33,132
Good girl, you got your rent.
Let me count it. Get outta here.

563
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:34,425
- Bye.
- Bye.

564
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:40,806
Dicky! You wanna say bye to your room?

565
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:42,600
- Nah.
- You good?

566
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:46,103
That's right, player.
That's right. Awesome.

567
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:48,564
Hey, Dicky, I can't take this.

568
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,045
Look, there's no room in here at all.

569
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:54,403
I'm gonna buy you new toys when we get
to New Orleans, okay? I promise.

570
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:56,007
Come on, guys. Take whatever you want.

571
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,471
Grab whatever you want out of there.

572
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,702
- Here you go, guys.
- I got the gun.

573
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,997
- Dad! Please.
- Here, here, here.

574
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,209
All new stuff, kid. All new stuff.

575
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:10,711
- Just imagine, all new stuff.
- Fine.

576
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:12,588
My mom said, "Have fun."

577
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:15,424
All right guys. Here.
You can have the whole box.

578
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:17,028
Take the whole box with you, go ahead.

579
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,803
Bye, Joyce. Bye.

580
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:20,763
Yo, T. Take care, bro, all right?

581
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:23,808
You hold this place down for me
while I'm gone, you hear?

582
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,726
- You be good, okay sweetie?
- Okay.

583
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:28,354
- Bye Dicky!
- See you later!

584
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:49,208
- Hey, you wanna see something cool?
- Yeah.

585
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:53,045
- Okay. Make sure you don't tell anyone.
- Okay.

586
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,340
Look. And it has a naked girl on it.

587
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:01,220
Did you steal that?

588
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:03,638
Eh.

589
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:05,891
Moon, Scoot!

590
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,185
Yeah, Mom?

591
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:10,938
Get off your butts
and go get some waffles.

592
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,317
- My mom wanted extra maple syrup.
- It's in there.

593
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:17,862
- Okay, guys, go. Have fun, be careful.
- Okay.

594
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:20,406
Hey, Scooty, it's actually for me.

595
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,368
- What are you, twerking over here?
- Yeah.

596
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:30,708
- Let me see. Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Mommy. Mom... Mommy.

597
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:36,547
Oh, wow. You got some twerk skills, girl.

598
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:39,550
- Yass!
- Now watch me shake my booty.

599
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,595
- Ooh!
- Now watch me shake my booty.

600
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,399
Yo, you heard this song, bitch?

601
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:56,817
It's mad lit.

602
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:04,158
Wait. Hold up. Wait. Bitch,
did that guy from OBT ever call you?

603
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:06,786
- Yeah.
- What's good with that?

604
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,622
He's mad fucking whack.

605
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,082
I tried to chill with him.

606
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,292
He doesn't like kids.

607
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:18,839
Oh. Goodbye. Good night.
Take several seats.

608
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:21,175
- Who you telling?
- Face it.

609
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,181
Yo, by the way,
you gotta do me a fucking favor.

610
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:32,269
Next time Moonee comes to you to get food,

611
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:35,231
don't give her no fucking maple syrup.

612
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:38,234
This bitch has been farting...

613
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,194
Good night, bitch. I love you!

614
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:41,862
Love you. Night, bitch.

615
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,037
Mm, mm, mm.

616
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:51,497
I'm gonna kiss it.

617
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:56,252
Can I have a bite on the ice cream then?

618
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:04,260
- Mm, mm, mm.
- Pretty good.

619
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:08,973
Hey, kids! How many times have I told you
that you can't be hanging out there?

620
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,558
We're paying customers.

621
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:12,494
I don't care.
You can't be bothering my customers.

622
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:15,062
- Go. Get out.
- No. You don't tell us what to do.

623
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:16,146
Hey!

624
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:19,316
- Yeah, lady!
- Be quiet!

625
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:22,653
Hey. Hey, girls, come on.

626
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:26,073
- We're hiding! This is serious, Bobby.
- I'm working.

627
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:29,243
We need to hide, we need to hide.
We need to hide. Go, go, go, go.

628
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:30,369
No, not back...

629
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:31,787
- We don't care.
- Now be quiet.

630
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:34,415
And watch those wires down there.

631
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:39,753
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch the wires down there, girls!

632
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:40,837
No, no, no, no.

633
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,636
Have you seen Moon... Yes!

634
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,430
Don't blow our cover.

635
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:51,390
Where's Moonee and Jancey?

636
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,060
I got you! I got you!

637
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,146
I got you! I got you guys!

638
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,982
- Move, Bobby!
- Excuse me.

639
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:18,167
Have a safe trip!

640
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:19,793
Hallelujah!

641
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:23,380
Hallelujah! Thank you, Lord Jesus!

642
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,633
No boys allowed!

643
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:26,759
No!

644
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,093
No boys!

645
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:30,346
Do that one more time, and...

646
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:38,062
Hi, kids.

647
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:39,980
- Okay! I'm gonna...
- Hey! Go ahead.

648
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:41,690
You having fun?

649
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:43,609
This is the girl's table.

650
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:58,456
Oh!

651
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,836
- Fuck! Shit! What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, buddy.

652
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,064
- It was an accident.
- You almost hit me.

653
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:05,172
- I...
- Fuck, man.

654
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:07,174
Okay. I'm sorry, man.
Punk ass bitch.

655
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:08,467
Whoa. Whoa!

656
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:13,722
Ah. What's your name?

657
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:15,599
Excuse me, can I help you?

658
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:19,144
- Uh... No, that's okay.
- What's okay?

659
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,315
Moonee, get off that picnic table.
People eat on that thing. Come on, girl.

660
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:25,734
You're a guest here?

661
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:30,406
Uh. No... I'm looking for...
a soda machine.

662
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:33,826
You come to a motel to get a soda?

663
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,996
Yeah. Uh... It's okay...

664
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,582
- I appreciate it.
- No. Come on, come with me.

665
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:40,541
Come with me.

666
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,064
I know where there's a soda machine.

667
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:43,603
- No, no.
- Just come with me.

668
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:46,171
You want a soda, right?

669
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,675
Yeah, yeah. I was passing by
on the highway...

670
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:51,385
Get off that picnic table!

671
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:54,179
- I was just passing by...
- Yeah?

672
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:57,474
And, and I wanted to get a soda
'cause uh... I needed a soda.

673
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:58,726
You were parched, huh?

674
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:03,272
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- You wanted to wet that palate, right?

675
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:08,527
Yeah. I never did get used
to the humidity here.

676
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:11,363
It's okay. Uh... The machine's up there.

677
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:16,118
- So you like soda, huh?
- Uh, yeah, yeah. It's good.

678
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:22,833
You know, I read in a magazine that soda's
not so good for quenching your thirst.

679
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,420
- I agree. Yeah. Yeah.
- You noticed that? You know what's better?

680
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:27,671
- What?
- Tea.

681
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:29,548
- T-Tea?
- Tea. Hot tea.

682
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:31,800
- Hot tea. Like...
- Yeah, yeah, I drink that.

683
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:34,094
- You do? Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

684
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:38,182
No, no. It's... It's right up here.
Just a little more ways.

685
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,684
You came for a soda,
we're gonna get you a soda. Right?

686
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:44,980
Yeah, but I-I... I wanted to...
I-I had to have a walk.

687
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:46,607
Yeah, well, you're gettin' a walk.

688
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:52,112
It's right up here. You'll get your soda.
And you can have a walk.

689
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,926
What a choice.

690
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,470
- Okay, thank you.
- Hey.

691
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:20,015
- I thought you were thirsty.
- Yeah.

692
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,433
Aren't you gonna drink it now?

693
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,561
Yeah. Yes.

694
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:30,775
Good?

695
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:32,527
Sure.

696
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,446
Get the fuck outta here.

697
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:38,826
You come on this property again, and you
won't be leaving it. You understand?

698
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:40,469
I don't know what you're talking about.

699
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:44,123
You don't know what I'm talking about?
You gonna play it that way, huh?

700
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:49,377
Hey.

701
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:51,087
- Hey!
- All right.

702
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:54,091
Charlie Coachman...

703
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:56,760
of Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

704
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:58,737
You can't keep that, that's my license.

705
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:02,599
I'm gonna call your name in
to the county sheriff.

706
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:05,436
Now you get the fuck outta here!

707
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:13,652
Get going. Get going!

708
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:19,616
Don't you stop!

709
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:36,216
I'm making a sand castle.

710
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:39,720
- Excuse me, do you wanna buy some perfume?
- I'm sorry?

711
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:41,096
Do you wanna buy some perfume?

712
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,932
- We're selling perfume.
- I don't have cash on me.

713
00:44:44,183 --> 00:44:45,392
Okay. Thank you.

714
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:49,104
- No, thank you.
- This will make you handsome!

715
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,191
Come on. Actually... Actually, sir?

716
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:55,402
Can you just give us a couple bucks?
Just for me and my kid,

717
00:44:55,486 --> 00:44:57,029
if you're not gonna buy the perfume?

718
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,781
- Look...
- Please.

719
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:04,536
- Have a great day.
- Thank you so much!

720
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:06,121
Yass!

721
00:45:06,997 --> 00:45:08,582
Let your head back.

722
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,292
Let your head back.

723
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:21,929
- Do you want to get splashed?
- No. No. No!

724
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,688
Jancey. This is gonna be scary.

725
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:34,358
Yeah!
There's ghosts in there.

726
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:39,696
- Are we going in there?
- No. You'll see.

727
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:46,703
- It's spooky.
- Spooky.

728
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:00,384
- Hey, you wanna see a joke?
- What?

729
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:05,264
- Ready?
- Voilà!

730
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:07,432
Wait for me, guys.

731
00:46:07,516 --> 00:46:09,726
What a gentleman you are.

732
00:46:18,694 --> 00:46:19,694
Yeah.

733
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:23,115
Scooty, will you marry me?

734
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,242
Well... Not right now.

735
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:30,455
- You may kiss the bride.
- I said not right now! Ew.

736
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:31,957
Ew.

737
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:35,836
- What is this place?
- The "abandids".

738
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:40,424
One... Two... Three!

739
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:50,183
Hey, you know there's alligators in there?

740
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:52,102
Really?

741
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:57,691
Look, if I had a pet alligator,
I would name mine Anne.

742
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:03,238
Ha. Ooh, look, a pillow!

743
00:47:04,907 --> 00:47:05,991
Cool.

744
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:11,622
I bet this house was built
hundreds of years ago.

745
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:13,206
Oh! This could be a dance room!

746
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,000
Party with beer.

747
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:18,545
Party with beer.
Party with beer.

748
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:20,756
Party with beer!

749
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,009
Oh, my gosh! Come here Jancey!

750
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,594
Ghost poop.

751
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:29,306
- Ew!
- Yeah!

752
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:36,521
This would be my bed.

753
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:39,149
And that would be my bookshelf.

754
00:47:39,608 --> 00:47:44,154
No. Actually, my bed would be
right in the middle. And lots of toys!

755
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:49,618
Scooty!

756
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:52,412
- What are you breaking?
- The wall.

757
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:59,461
Good luck!

758
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,131
Woo-hoo!

759
00:48:10,097 --> 00:48:12,641
Oh. The fireplace.

760
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,851
I have the best idea.

761
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:18,397
Scooty! We need your lighter!

762
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,566
- Push it in.
- This is going to be the best fire ever.

763
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,861
- Light it up, Scooty!
- Yeah. Light it up!

764
00:48:33,662 --> 00:48:36,164
Whoa, guys. Whoa. Whoa.

765
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,750
- We're gonna be in so much trouble.
- No!

766
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:42,295
Um, just... Jancey, go home. Bye.
Don't tell anyone.

767
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:43,380
Don't tell your grandma.

768
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:44,881
- Okay. Bye. Bye.
- Okay.

769
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:48,635
- Don't tell anyone!
- Okay!

770
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:55,350
- Scooty, don't tell your mom, okay?
- Okay.

771
00:48:58,061 --> 00:48:59,104
Excuse me.

772
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:03,817
Moon, the old condos are on fire.
You wanna go check them out?

773
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:11,074
Whoo!

774
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:20,292
Scooty, come on.
Don't you wanna see the burning house?

775
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:24,254
No. I just wanna stay here and watch TV.

776
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:27,299
- Scooty?
- Hurry up, bitch.

777
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:29,009
I don't wanna miss this.

778
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:32,971
- I'll meet you there.
- Hurry up, bitch.

779
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:46,234
Look at me.
You tell me the truth right now.

780
00:49:47,277 --> 00:49:49,905
Do you understand what will happen to us
if you did this?

781
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:53,200
Do you want the fucking DCF
down here, Scooty?

782
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:06,755
- You need to tell me the truth right now.
- I didn't do it.

783
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,633
Don't lie to me. Please don't lie to me.

784
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:17,099
This isn't a game, Scooty. This is not
a joke right now. I need to know.

785
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:29,611
- Hey, girl!
- Hi!

786
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:33,240
Aren't you excited?
This is so much better than TV.

787
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,992
Can I take a picture of you?
I wanna send it to Ashley.

788
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:37,160
Stand right there.

789
00:50:37,953 --> 00:50:39,579
Smile, girlfriend.

790
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:43,375
It used to be a big crackhead spot.

791
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:47,587
Prostituting and all that.
Let it burn. Let it burn.

792
00:50:54,678 --> 00:50:55,838
You got another one of those?

793
00:50:57,305 --> 00:50:58,640
For you?

794
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:02,477
- Here, babe.
- Thanks.

795
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:10,485
- You just like me for my cigarettes now.
- No.

796
00:51:10,861 --> 00:51:11,861
That's right.

797
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,714
- You wouldn't have even said hello...
- That's not so.

798
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:16,283
- ...if I didn't have cigarettes.
- That's not true.

799
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:17,617
No wonder I don't like you.

800
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:19,703
Could've been arson.

801
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:23,582
- Could've been.
- I don't know.

802
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:27,294
They were so fucking ugly,
I was thinking of burning them down.

803
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:40,181
Ashley?

804
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,897
- Hi, Miss Ashley. Is Scooty here?
- Moonee, tell your mom no more food. Okay?

805
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:50,775
- Okay. Is...
- I have to go work, okay?

806
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:52,360
- Is Scooty here?
- No, he's not.

807
00:51:52,444 --> 00:51:55,363
- Well, he's not at home.
- Yeah, I know. He's with my friends.

808
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:58,742
Well, could you please
give me the address?

809
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:01,161
Look, you can't come around anymore.

810
00:52:01,411 --> 00:52:03,971
And I don't want you hanging out
with Scooty anymore, you got it?

811
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:05,999
I have to go.

812
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:17,469
Yass!

813
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:19,888
Hey, do you fucking see this shit?

814
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:26,394
Come on. Come on.

815
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:27,729
God!

816
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:30,565
World star!

817
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:31,858
How 'bout this?

818
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:35,403
No more letting people
run over other people

819
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:37,131
in the fucking parking lot.
How 'bout that?

820
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:40,367
- Bobby, I didn't... I couldn't do anything.
- What's wrong with you?

821
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:41,993
'Cause this, this can't be happening.

822
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:45,205
I fucking knocked that
little fucker out. You fucking kiddin' me?

823
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:52,254
Go run and get some waffles, baby.

824
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,131
And where the fuck is Scooty?

825
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:09,854
- Yo.
- Hi, Scooty.

826
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:11,022
Hi, Halley.

827
00:53:11,106 --> 00:53:13,506
Moonee's gonna hit the pool,
does Scooty wanna come with her?

828
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,362
Ashley doesn't think that's a good idea
right now, sorry.

829
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:18,863
The fuck does that mean?

830
00:53:18,947 --> 00:53:20,240
Halley, calm down, calm down.

831
00:53:28,665 --> 00:53:30,333
Hi. Here you go.

832
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,420
I want her to take my order.

833
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:39,968
Oh, it's you.
Never seen you inside before.

834
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:43,013
Okay. Hold on.

835
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:45,389
Ashley.

836
00:53:51,563 --> 00:53:52,647
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

837
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:57,319
- What do you want, Halley?
- What's going on?

838
00:53:58,695 --> 00:53:59,695
What do you mean?

839
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,384
You've been telling my daughter
she ain't welcome here no more.

840
00:54:04,743 --> 00:54:09,873
Look, she can come in here,
but I can't keep giving out free food.

841
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,208
Shit. You got in trouble?

842
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:16,963
And I don't want Scooty hanging out
with her or that new kid from FutureLand.

843
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:21,593
Okay. So you ain't get in trouble.
What's going on?

844
00:54:22,886 --> 00:54:25,221
Nothing. Nothing to discuss.

845
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:28,600
- Really?
- Really.

846
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:36,149
Yo! What type of service is that?
You gonna come take my order?

847
00:54:42,155 --> 00:54:47,369
Moonee, order whatever the fuck you want.
We're staying here all fucking day.

848
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:53,792
Yes. I want strawberry waffles
with extra, extra warm syrup.

849
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:57,837
And I want eggs, bacon, and strawberries.

850
00:54:57,921 --> 00:55:03,009
And blueberries. And Coke,
root beer, and lemonade. Sprite.

851
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:05,552
You?

852
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:09,391
You sure that's it? You could order more.
I told you, anything you want.

853
00:55:10,183 --> 00:55:12,394
I actually want extra bacon.

854
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:14,813
Lots of bacon.

855
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:19,651
- And fresh jelly. Don't forget that.
- You got all that?

856
00:55:20,068 --> 00:55:21,319
You got money to pay for this?

857
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:23,780
Don't worry about my pockets. I got money.

858
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:26,741
- Okay.
- And I got money, too!

859
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,662
- Mmm!
- I have an idea.

860
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:32,747
You wanna have a burping contest?

861
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:36,668
- Are you serious?
- I know you wanna have a burping contest.

862
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:38,336
- You go first.
- Okay.

863
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:49,639
That was a good one.

864
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:51,724
- You got another one?
- Yeah.

865
00:55:51,808 --> 00:55:53,309
Here it goes, here it goes...

866
00:55:59,566 --> 00:56:01,401
- Oh, my God.
- You try to burp.

867
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,322
I want the rest to go.

868
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:15,999
You gonna pack this up for me,

869
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,482
or do I gotta tell Simone
what I feel about the service here?

870
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:22,504
Yeah.

871
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,304
Say hi to Scooty for me.

872
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:39,564
Mom, why did you do that?

873
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:44,736
Ah! I told you, you gotta spin it.

874
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:48,031
- I am.
- No, no. Clockwise.

875
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:50,200
- I am! This is clockwise.
- Oh, oh.

876
00:56:50,283 --> 00:56:52,285
- No. I guess counterclockwise.
- Jesus.

877
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:55,412
Come on.

878
00:56:56,915 --> 00:56:57,915
Pull, pull, pull.

879
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:03,296
- You gotta spin it.
- I am.

880
00:57:14,766 --> 00:57:17,060
By the way,
I told her happy birthday for you.

881
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,188
- But I didn't.
- Come on, push.

882
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:21,606
- But I didn't. I didn't.
- Push.

883
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:23,441
Why'd you do that? Why would you do that?

884
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:28,029
Now you call her and tell her I didn't.

885
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:29,697
Come on, please.

886
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:32,909
Hey. First...
First, you get her on the phone,

887
00:57:33,826 --> 00:57:35,906
and you tell her
I didn't wish her anything, damn it.

888
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,586
Okay.

889
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:52,011
You know what? Keep the money.

890
00:57:53,805 --> 00:57:54,847
- Keep it.
- No.

891
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:57,850
- I thought you appreciated the extra work.
- Okay.

892
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,979
No. It takes an hour and a half
just to drive here.

893
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:04,691
You totally screwed up my Saturday.
I don't need the extra work.

894
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:07,819
Give the money to him, he needs it.

895
00:58:08,778 --> 00:58:10,572
Or tell your boss to hire an extra hand.

896
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:16,202
Please just take the money.
I really don't need it.

897
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:18,913
I can't do this anymore. I'm done.

898
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:24,419
Okay. But, just...
help me bring this downstairs.

899
00:58:27,672 --> 00:58:31,384
Come on. Finish what you started.

900
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,773
- You gonna press the button?
- Oh, yeah.

901
00:58:50,987 --> 00:58:52,280
Fuck.

902
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:09,797
This one smells really good.

903
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:12,842
- No.
- No?

904
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:13,925
No. Thank you.

905
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:15,261
Okay, thank you.

906
00:59:15,345 --> 00:59:17,639
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh, fuck.

907
00:59:18,056 --> 00:59:21,267
Excuse me, lady. Hey!

908
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:24,270
- Hey!
- We're leaving.

909
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:26,514
- I need you guys to come back inside.
- We're leaving.

910
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:28,816
- Do you hear me?
- We're leaving.

911
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:30,984
Come on.

912
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:33,519
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You were soliciting in our building.

913
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:35,531
- You can't do that.
- You're not even a real cop.

914
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:36,759
Hey, I'm just doing my job here, alright.

915
00:59:36,783 --> 00:59:38,510
You can't do that on our property.
I've already called the cops.

916
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:39,845
You gotta go back inside with me.

917
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:42,914
Get off your power trip.
You're riding a golf cart, okay?

918
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,183
I need you to come back right now.

919
00:59:44,207 --> 00:59:45,887
If you're leaving,
I gotta confiscate that.

920
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:47,085
I need you to... Gimme...

921
00:59:47,919 --> 00:59:48,979
- Fuck!
- Are you serious right now?

922
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:50,546
You fucking bitch!

923
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,256
Come back here!

924
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:55,843
Why'd you let her have our perfume?

925
00:59:56,386 --> 00:59:57,970
It's complicated, baby.

926
00:59:58,388 --> 00:59:59,430
But why?

927
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,684
I can't get arrested again.

928
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,144
Could we go for ice cream?

929
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:08,898
You're walking too fast.

930
01:01:11,127 --> 01:01:12,879
I don't wanna watch this anymore.

931
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:15,631
- Where's the iPad?
- Sold.

932
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,801
- What?
- I had to sell it.

933
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:25,266
- Why?
- Whatever, Moonee, this room costs money.

934
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:30,646
- You know I like pepperoni.
- Pepperoni costs money.

935
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:37,403
Don't wipe that on the sheets.
Gotta sleep there.

936
01:01:37,987 --> 01:01:41,115
This is my pillow.
I can wipe my hands on my pillow.

937
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:45,453
Are you gonna wash it then?

938
01:01:48,873 --> 01:01:50,333
I'll have Bertha wash it.

939
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,919
I'm not gonna explain it to you again.

940
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:56,798
I ain't gonna let you, or anyone else,
establish residency.

941
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,718
Don't think I think you're as dumb
as you want me to think.

942
01:02:02,178 --> 01:02:03,387
You're gonna screw me over.

943
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:08,392
You don't wanna do this, you can go.
I'm serious.

944
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:12,396
But who's gonna know if we even did this?

945
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,155
And I'm being straight with you.

946
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:23,866
You gotta settle up by Friday.

947
01:02:50,393 --> 01:02:51,435
Come on.

948
01:03:02,989 --> 01:03:03,990
Hey, April.

949
01:03:07,785 --> 01:03:08,785
Come on, Moonee.

950
01:03:09,912 --> 01:03:12,456
- What are you taking pictures for?
- New policy.

951
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,959
Narek wants me to document the vacancy.

952
01:03:15,585 --> 01:03:16,669
Moonee, come on.

953
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:28,723
Good night, ladies. See you in 24 hours.

954
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,861
I'm right across 192 at The Magic Castle.

955
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:44,155
I come here once a month,
and the rate's 35.

956
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:46,991
Yes, well, our policy has changed.

957
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:49,702
- You can't just change the policy.
- I certainly can.

958
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:52,705
- Fuck this right now.
- What are you doing?

959
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:53,956
Don't worry about me.

960
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:56,143
- Who are you calling?
- Mind your business.

961
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:58,210
- Can't you see I'm in charge here?
- I don't care.

962
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:01,922
<i>- Hello. Bobby.</i>
- Hey, Bobby.

963
01:04:02,465 --> 01:04:07,762
These fuckos at The Arabian
are trying to charge me...

964
01:04:08,638 --> 01:04:11,223
- Forty-five.
- Forty-five bucks.

965
01:04:11,307 --> 01:04:13,100
Can you tell them it's 35?

966
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,770
<i>- Now that's not right.</i>
- Hey, listen, Bobby...

967
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:17,521
<i>- Where's Jimmy?</i>
- It's me, Jimmy, Bobby.

968
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:18,790
We're not honoring the deal anymore.

969
01:04:18,814 --> 01:04:20,608
<i>- Hey, Jimmy, How's it going?</i>
- Yeah, good.

970
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:22,360
- Hello?
<i>- Uh, who is this?</i>

971
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:25,071
Any arrangements or deals you had
with the previous owner...

972
01:04:25,154 --> 01:04:27,073
Give us a break, lady!

973
01:04:27,156 --> 01:04:29,356
...are no longer being honored
or recognized. Thank you.

974
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:45,591
We've had an agreement
in place for a while

975
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:49,011
where we give a little break
to each other's...

976
01:04:49,095 --> 01:04:52,348
I'm well aware of the arrangement
you used to have.

977
01:04:52,682 --> 01:04:56,435
But as I have said five times now,
this is no longer being honored.

978
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:59,244
We just went through with this whole thing
with The Enchanted Inn.

979
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:04,610
- Look, can't you make an exception?
- No.

980
01:05:05,695 --> 01:05:07,363
This is not up for discussion.

981
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:08,864
You see what I'm saying, Bobby?

982
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:13,369
Duh, lady! Duh!

983
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:19,959
Magic Castle discount, there you go.

984
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:22,086
- Excuse me.
- Aw, you're so sweet, Bobby.

985
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:24,422
We don't need your business.
Please take your money.

986
01:05:24,505 --> 01:05:27,049
- What?
- All of you kindly leave, please.

987
01:05:27,133 --> 01:05:28,968
- Thank you.
- You can't do that.

988
01:05:29,385 --> 01:05:31,762
I have the 45. Are you fucking serious?

989
01:05:32,096 --> 01:05:33,764
Listen to you. And your child.

990
01:05:34,223 --> 01:05:36,142
No wonder you're in this situation.

991
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,478
Please leave the property.
Right now. Leave.

992
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:45,443
- What is wrong with you?
- Hey, come on.

993
01:05:45,526 --> 01:05:47,528
Are you crazy out of mind?

994
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:52,074
You better come back here and clean
this up. Come back here.

995
01:05:52,158 --> 01:05:53,284
Fuck you.

996
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:55,828
Do not ever come back to this property!

997
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:22,438
Damn, girl.
This shit looks fucking fancy in here.

998
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:23,856
Thank you, thank you.

999
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:27,067
How do you got it like that?
You an interior decorator or some shit?

1000
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,653
Shit is mad cozy.

1001
01:06:30,613 --> 01:06:32,323
- Guys, you want cheesies?
- Yeah.

1002
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:34,283
- Yeah?
- What's that big thing over there?

1003
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:35,618
That's a turkey roaster.

1004
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:37,787
What the fuck is it,
Thanksgiving over here?

1005
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:40,164
You got some cranberry sauce too? Shit.

1006
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:44,210
I make some things, but Lunchables
are like one dollar, you know?

1007
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:46,462
Grandma, can they sleep
over here every night?

1008
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:50,174
- Yeah. You trying to cook us dinner.
- Oh, I don't know about every night.

1009
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:53,177
- Why not?
- We can sleep together like a big family.

1010
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,094
Yeah!

1011
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:55,906
I'll pull out a mattress
on the floor or something like that,

1012
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:57,330
but y'all ain't sleeping in my bed.

1013
01:06:57,598 --> 01:07:01,852
No, you sleep on this side.
And I'll sleep on that side.

1014
01:07:01,936 --> 01:07:04,396
This is gonna be
the funnest sleepover over.

1015
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,564
Yeah!

1016
01:07:05,648 --> 01:07:09,026
Since it's bedtime, can we finally go
fucking smoke a blunt outside?

1017
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:38,305
Can you tie me up?

1018
01:07:39,849 --> 01:07:41,308
Are we going swimming?

1019
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:46,105
- No, we're gonna take swimsuit selfies.
- Swimsuit selfies!

1020
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:49,567
Okay, ready? Let's take a selfie.

1021
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,409
Stick your tongue out.

1022
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:02,245
Cute.

1023
01:08:02,288 --> 01:08:04,206
Tell me how to look pretty, Moonee.

1024
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:06,166
Wait. Hold on.

1025
01:08:09,253 --> 01:08:11,046
My turn!

1026
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,173
Get out there and take a picture of me.

1027
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:18,554
Perfect.

1028
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:26,562
Plip, plop, plip, plop.

1029
01:08:31,734 --> 01:08:35,821
It's going to be a big surprise! And...

1030
01:08:36,739 --> 01:08:39,074
- Open!
- Whoa!

1031
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:42,077
At the end of the rainbow is gold!

1032
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:45,998
I know, but a leprechaun
is on the end with the gold.

1033
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:47,958
And it wouldn't let us keep it.

1034
01:08:48,876 --> 01:08:50,836
I wish that leprechaun was nice.

1035
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,297
Let's go beat it up. Come on!

1036
01:09:05,726 --> 01:09:06,810
Hmm.

1037
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:12,316
Hey. This Slinky is old.

1038
01:09:15,277 --> 01:09:16,277
Whoa!

1039
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:19,823
<i>Hip-hop.
That's the way we do it.</i>

1040
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:23,827
<i>Power 95.3, Orlando's number one
for commercial free hip-hop.</i>

1041
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:26,664
Sorry to interrupt.

1042
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:30,459
I just wanted to pay you
for the week, sir.

1043
01:09:31,293 --> 01:09:33,128
- It's good.
- Duh.

1044
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:59,655
- Hi!
- Hi, Bobby!

1045
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,740
Hi, bossy guy.

1046
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:05,703
Good kids. Most of the time.

1047
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:10,666
- Bobby.
- Yeah.

1048
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:12,418
- Come here.
- Yup.

1049
01:10:14,128 --> 01:10:16,672
Okay. See? This is all finable.

1050
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:18,966
- What?
- These bikes blocking the walkway.

1051
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,217
Okay. Okay.

1052
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,428
- You have to make a flyer.
- All right.

1053
01:10:22,511 --> 01:10:25,639
It has to say, "Please move your bikes
and lock them in the back."

1054
01:10:25,723 --> 01:10:26,932
Okay. Uh, in the...

1055
01:10:27,016 --> 01:10:28,017
- Okay?
- Way in the back?

1056
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,101
- Yes.
- Okay.

1057
01:10:29,727 --> 01:10:32,104
Give them one week deadline,
otherwise we'll cut them off.

1058
01:10:32,187 --> 01:10:34,398
- Okay. All right.
- "Thank you, Management."

1059
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,745
Soap in my eyes.

1060
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:56,128
Let me wash my hair again
without this soap in my eye.

1061
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:00,716
I'm gonna cook lasagna!

1062
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:04,094
- What are you gonna cook?
- I'm gonna cook alien food!

1063
01:11:04,178 --> 01:11:06,305
Yeah!

1064
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:09,683
Here you go, aliens! Eat it up!

1065
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:33,707
You're a good hummer, Jancey.

1066
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:39,004
Oh, wait.

1067
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:41,799
- Mommy, look at us.
- Girls, we got one.

1068
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:43,382
Yes!

1069
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,136
We're just going straight. Is that okay?

1070
01:12:03,946 --> 01:12:06,156
- You ready, Jancey?
- Can I put it in?

1071
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:09,201
- It's on.
- Be careful, 'cause it has fire.

1072
01:12:10,244 --> 01:12:11,453
Don't want you to get burned.

1073
01:12:29,972 --> 01:12:31,849
Make a wish, big girl.

1074
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:36,061
Whoa!

1075
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:44,903
- Happy birthday, Jancey!
- Whoa!

1076
01:12:44,987 --> 01:12:46,905
- That's for you.
- I love it!

1077
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:48,949
Whoa.

1078
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:53,954
Halley, save us, 'cause I don't...

1079
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:56,373
- Did you make your birthday wish?
- Yeah.

1080
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:08,343
Okay.

1081
01:13:41,877 --> 01:13:43,462
- Oh, come on.
<i>- Hola.</i>

1082
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:46,298
Come on. Pardon me.

1083
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:48,592
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1084
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:51,470
- Excuse me, pardon me.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

1085
01:13:51,553 --> 01:13:53,555
- Come on, ladies.
- Excuse me, dude.

1086
01:14:16,245 --> 01:14:18,163
- Get it, get it, get it.
- It's hard, Moonee.

1087
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:20,415
- What?
- It's really hard, Moonee.

1088
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:23,293
- Yeah, I know.
- Hey. Wait a minute.

1089
01:14:23,377 --> 01:14:24,711
I didn't get jelly.

1090
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:26,505
Tricky jar.

1091
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:31,385
- Tricky, tricky. Tricky, tricky...
- Tricky jar.

1092
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:35,222
- Wiggly, wiggly.
- Well, here you go.

1093
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:36,431
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

1094
01:14:36,515 --> 01:14:37,808
Thank you!

1095
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:42,270
Mm.

1096
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:54,825
Kind of like that, don't ya?

1097
01:14:57,369 --> 01:14:59,830
This is the best jelly I ever eaten.

1098
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:05,502
Do you know... Do you know why
this is my favorite tree?

1099
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:06,585
Why?

1100
01:15:08,005 --> 01:15:09,339
'Cause it tipped over.

1101
01:15:11,758 --> 01:15:13,176
And it's still growing.

1102
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,970
That's pretty cool.

1103
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:16,512
Mm-hmm.

1104
01:15:35,991 --> 01:15:37,159
All yours, Scooty.

1105
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:38,869
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey.

1106
01:15:53,675 --> 01:15:56,803
Ashley, have you been spotting Halley
on the rent?

1107
01:15:57,346 --> 01:16:01,308
What? Why would I do that?
I don't even talk to that bitch.

1108
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:04,519
- Okay. Thanks. Have a nice swim.
- Thank you.

1109
01:16:10,442 --> 01:16:12,194
Can I go swimming with Scooty?

1110
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:15,906
You're not going swimming
while that bitch is down there.

1111
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:27,709
Why can't I?

1112
01:16:31,338 --> 01:16:32,964
Tickle monster.

1113
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:39,346
Moonee, get ready for a bath, okay?

1114
01:16:41,973 --> 01:16:43,392
What kind of car you driving?

1115
01:16:45,352 --> 01:16:47,771
All right. Room 323, babe.

1116
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:12,671
Oh. Hey, there's a kid in here.

1117
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:14,714
Dude, I told you
the bathroom was off-limits.

1118
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:16,341
- I had to piss.
- Out.

1119
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,653
- Pull the curtain, Moon.
- You have a fucking kid in here?

1120
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:20,095
Whatever. Out.

1121
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:22,639
Moon, I'll be right back, okay?

1122
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:27,394
<i>...Orlando's
number one for commercial free hip-hop.</i>

1123
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:51,501
Do I look like a ticket scammer?

1124
01:17:51,585 --> 01:17:53,438
I don't know.
What does a ticket scammer look like?

1125
01:17:53,462 --> 01:17:55,064
- I'm just not interested.
- Not like me, though.

1126
01:17:55,088 --> 01:17:56,298
If I was scamming tickets,

1127
01:17:56,381 --> 01:17:59,509
I would not be coming in here with
my daughter, trying to give you a deal.

1128
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:07,392
- Hey, you going in there?
- Yeah.

1129
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:10,854
Don't buy from those places.
They'll rope you into buying timeshares.

1130
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:12,939
- I got some I'm trying to sell.
- Ah. No, thanks.

1131
01:18:13,023 --> 01:18:16,151
Dude! They'll make you do a two-hour tour
and hard sell you.

1132
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:18,153
You really wanna do that shit
on your vacation?

1133
01:18:18,987 --> 01:18:20,614
You're selling ticket bands?

1134
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:23,575
Well, I have four. They're 164 per day.

1135
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:27,704
So that's, like, $600 in cash.
I could do... $400.

1136
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:30,707
And these still work, no tricks?

1137
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:32,417
They're completely unused.

1138
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:35,879
My family had to cancel our vacation,
and they don't give out refunds.

1139
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:37,602
But they're totally unused, they'll work.

1140
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:41,718
Look, I'll even come with you to the front
gate or whatever so you know I'm for real.

1141
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:44,596
- And these are Park Hoppers, yeah?
- Of course!

1142
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:48,642
All right. Should we say
350 for the four, then?

1143
01:18:49,017 --> 01:18:50,227
- Cash?
- Yeah.

1144
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:54,606
Lowest I can do is 400. That's a steal.

1145
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:58,568
- All right.
- Thanks.

1146
01:18:59,653 --> 01:19:00,820
Give him the bands, Moon.

1147
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:03,031
Give the man the bands.

1148
01:19:03,114 --> 01:19:04,783
- Have a great time.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

1149
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,535
Thank you. Come on, baby.

1150
01:19:07,536 --> 01:19:10,664
Whoo!

1151
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:15,043
Oh, look, look.

1152
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:17,546
That one's beautiful!

1153
01:19:17,629 --> 01:19:18,629
I want that one.

1154
01:19:19,589 --> 01:19:22,884
- We can give Jancey one.
- Let's buy it. Give me that.

1155
01:19:22,968 --> 01:19:24,469
- Look at what else they have.
- Hey!

1156
01:19:24,553 --> 01:19:26,096
- Cotton balls?
- Yeah.

1157
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:27,055
Okay.

1158
01:19:27,138 --> 01:19:28,598
Toys!

1159
01:19:28,682 --> 01:19:30,850
Seriously, girlfriend?

1160
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:34,729
- Money. I'm rich. I'm rich.
- You got money!

1161
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:42,696
Look, there's a flute!

1162
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:54,291
Yeah!

1163
01:19:56,376 --> 01:19:58,503
- Back in the workforce?
- Say what?

1164
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:01,089
- New job?
- Yeah!

1165
01:20:02,424 --> 01:20:03,592
Interesting hours.

1166
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:05,259
What?

1167
01:20:06,636 --> 01:20:11,558
One, I see you dressed in PJs
all day, every day.

1168
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:13,143
Am I wearing PJs now?

1169
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:16,980
Two, if you're working,
who's looking after Moonee?

1170
01:20:18,732 --> 01:20:20,609
Mind your own business, bro.

1171
01:20:21,318 --> 01:20:23,612
Get that stolen cart off the property.

1172
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:35,915
Yeah?

1173
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:37,417
Who is it?

1174
01:20:43,882 --> 01:20:45,634
Go away, asshole,

1175
01:20:45,717 --> 01:20:47,302
or I'm gonna call the cops.

1176
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,096
Why you calling the cops?

1177
01:20:54,476 --> 01:20:56,227
I'm not going away.

1178
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:58,688
Mom, who's outside?

1179
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:00,440
Nobody, baby. Don't worry about it.

1180
01:21:06,613 --> 01:21:07,697
Hey, hey!

1181
01:21:08,156 --> 01:21:10,176
- Hey, what's going on?
- It's none of your business, bro.

1182
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,370
It is my business. I'm the manager here.
What's going on?

1183
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:15,955
Okay, yeah. The girl in there,
she's got something of mine.

1184
01:21:16,039 --> 01:21:17,290
I... I want it back.

1185
01:21:17,499 --> 01:21:19,167
- The six-year-old?
- The...

1186
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:20,919
No, man. The mom.

1187
01:21:26,049 --> 01:21:29,302
Halley, it's Bobby.
We got a situation here. Open up.

1188
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:36,643
- Yeah?
- This guy says you have something of his.

1189
01:21:36,935 --> 01:21:39,813
- I don't know who this guy is.
- She doesn't know who you are.

1190
01:21:40,105 --> 01:21:42,691
You got the wrong girl.
We gotta talk, now.

1191
01:21:43,233 --> 01:21:46,152
You know, you gotta leave the premises
if you're not staying here.

1192
01:21:46,236 --> 01:21:48,822
I'm not going anywhere
without my four MagicBands, okay?

1193
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:51,574
She went in my bag,
she took four fucking MagicBands.

1194
01:21:51,866 --> 01:21:54,452
What the fuck is a magical band?

1195
01:21:54,536 --> 01:21:56,256
I don't know what this guy
is talking about.

1196
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:57,807
She don't know what you're talking about.

1197
01:21:57,831 --> 01:22:00,250
She went in my stuff,
she lifted four fucking bands.

1198
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:02,520
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- She don't know what you're talking...

1199
01:22:02,544 --> 01:22:04,003
You do know what I'm talking about.

1200
01:22:04,129 --> 01:22:07,090
Okay? I want them back now. That's $1700.
That's grand larceny, bitch.

1201
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:08,341
Hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy.

1202
01:22:09,718 --> 01:22:12,929
I'm happy to call the cops right now,
and we can fill out a report.

1203
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:17,100
And you can tell them
what your business was on the premises.

1204
01:22:17,934 --> 01:22:19,018
Four bracelets?

1205
01:22:20,228 --> 01:22:23,273
I imagine they were for your wife
and children, yeah?

1206
01:22:28,528 --> 01:22:31,823
I suggest you leave
the premises right now.

1207
01:22:37,996 --> 01:22:39,748
This isn't a premises,
it's a fucking dump.

1208
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,834
About time you make yourself useful.

1209
01:22:49,007 --> 01:22:50,467
Did he have to pee again?

1210
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:51,718
Don't worry about it, Moon.

1211
01:23:08,318 --> 01:23:09,318
What now?

1212
01:23:09,611 --> 01:23:13,823
From now on, all visitors are required
to check in at the front desk. Got it?

1213
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:14,741
What?

1214
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:18,453
You have a guest, they check in with me
at the front office.

1215
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:21,456
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- You heard me.

1216
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:23,124
Get back inside, Moonee.

1217
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:25,710
When I say register, I'm talking about ID.

1218
01:23:25,794 --> 01:23:28,546
They gotta leave the ID right there,
with me, in the office.

1219
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:32,008
You can't just not let me have guests.
What gives you the authority?

1220
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:35,553
What? The authority?
Uh, my job title: manager.

1221
01:23:35,929 --> 01:23:38,932
- I have friends though.
- Hey, watch those glasses on the walkway.

1222
01:23:39,015 --> 01:23:41,351
Yeah. We all got friends.
We all got friends.

1223
01:23:41,434 --> 01:23:44,145
But this is a special rule for you.

1224
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:46,815
Okay. But, Bobby...

1225
01:23:46,898 --> 01:23:50,652
I do follow rules. Just 'cause they're not
your rules doesn't mean anything.

1226
01:23:50,735 --> 01:23:54,572
No, they... They're the company's rules.
They're the motel's rules.

1227
01:23:54,656 --> 01:23:56,592
- That's the way it is. I'm a very fair...
- Fuck you looking at, Tina?

1228
01:23:56,616 --> 01:23:57,951
- Hey!
- Don't listen, don't...

1229
01:23:58,034 --> 01:24:00,954
- Hey, people are leaving.
- You're not my fucking father.

1230
01:24:01,037 --> 01:24:04,082
- I don't wanna be your father.
- You can't fucking treat me like this.

1231
01:24:04,165 --> 01:24:07,085
- This isn't a fucking jail.
- Listen... Hey! Calm down!

1232
01:24:07,168 --> 01:24:08,711
- Calm down!
- This isn't a jail!

1233
01:24:08,795 --> 01:24:10,689
- No, no. It's a place where people live.
- You're gonna chase my friends away?

1234
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:13,317
- And you gotta... You gotta calm down.
- That's a fucking invasion of privacy.

1235
01:24:13,341 --> 01:24:15,343
It's like the fucking
Fifth Amendment or something.

1236
01:24:15,426 --> 01:24:17,321
- I've had it. That's it! That's it!
- You can't fucking do that.

1237
01:24:17,345 --> 01:24:19,722
- That's it!
- Who do you think you are, Bobby Big Shot?

1238
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:25,228
Fuck you, Bobby!
I don't have to listen to you!

1239
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:26,311
Out!

1240
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:30,483
I want you out of this lobby!
I'm gonna count to three.

1241
01:24:30,567 --> 01:24:34,529
And if you don't leave this lobby,
you're out of here tonight!

1242
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:36,905
One.

1243
01:24:37,991 --> 01:24:38,991
Two.

1244
01:24:40,201 --> 01:24:41,619
Three!

1245
01:24:47,125 --> 01:24:49,168
Oh. Nice!

1246
01:24:51,129 --> 01:24:53,798
Moonee, why'd you take me
on this adventure?

1247
01:24:53,882 --> 01:24:57,969
- I didn't know it was going to rain.
- Did you not even watch the news?

1248
01:24:58,052 --> 01:25:01,014
I never watch the news. It's so boring!

1249
01:25:01,097 --> 01:25:03,808
I watch the news. It's not that boring.

1250
01:25:27,123 --> 01:25:29,876
- Whoo!
- Careful of the pooey.

1251
01:25:31,753 --> 01:25:35,465
See, I took you on a safari.

1252
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:58,738
Hey. These two are still busted,

1253
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:00,949
but I'll be done with that one
in like two minutes.

1254
01:26:03,952 --> 01:26:04,952
Okay.

1255
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:29,185
Mom, it's Halley.

1256
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:37,859
- Hey.
- What?

1257
01:26:41,823 --> 01:26:45,868
I know Moonee probably did some shit,
and I'm sorry about that.

1258
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:51,708
But I don't think that shit should,
you know, affect us.

1259
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:53,167
You know, they're kids.

1260
01:26:54,252 --> 01:26:55,252
Is that it?

1261
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:58,172
Yeah, well...

1262
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:02,677
Could you spot me my rent this week?
I'm maxed out.

1263
01:27:02,927 --> 01:27:04,887
What?

1264
01:27:07,849 --> 01:27:09,517
I think you got that covered.

1265
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:11,519
What are you talking about?

1266
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:17,608
You don't think everybody knows
what's up, Halley? Like, everybody.

1267
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:20,403
What the fuck are you talking about?

1268
01:27:20,737 --> 01:27:22,405
Bitch...

1269
01:27:26,242 --> 01:27:29,704
<i>Seems pretty clear to me.
Step aside, soldier!</i>

1270
01:27:31,456 --> 01:27:34,292
- That's you.
- That's not me.

1271
01:27:37,879 --> 01:27:41,424
Those are your tats, bitch.
Are you fucking kidding me?

1272
01:27:42,216 --> 01:27:47,305
And I swear to God, if Scooty was ever
in the room while you were whoring off,

1273
01:27:47,388 --> 01:27:48,931
I'll fucking kill you.

1274
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:53,978
- Fuck you, bitch!
- No!

1275
01:27:54,062 --> 01:27:55,063
Get the fuck outta here.

1276
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,706
Mom, are you okay?

1277
01:28:17,335 --> 01:28:18,461
Mom?

1278
01:28:22,548 --> 01:28:24,759
Uh, are you okay, Mom?

1279
01:28:33,309 --> 01:28:35,978
You're not going to like it.
Because guess what?

1280
01:28:36,062 --> 01:28:38,606
- What?
- No fun stuff in the classroom.

1281
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:41,567
I heard in school you get recess.

1282
01:28:41,651 --> 01:28:46,239
And recess is fun. You get to go outside,
you get on the playground, it's fun.

1283
01:28:46,322 --> 01:28:49,534
It's just recess! Nothing else!

1284
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:08,344
Well, my grandma sometimes
does that to me,

1285
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:10,388
but I trick her that I fall asleep.

1286
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:14,767
- But then I just wake up...
- I think something's happening at my room.

1287
01:29:17,645 --> 01:29:20,022
Did Ashley fucking call DCF on me?

1288
01:29:20,106 --> 01:29:22,150
Ma'am, we got a call,
and it doesn't matter who...

1289
01:29:22,233 --> 01:29:24,735
From who? Who the fuck called you then?

1290
01:29:24,819 --> 01:29:26,195
- Ma'am...
- Who called you?

1291
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:27,589
- We were called to investigate.
- Who called you?

1292
01:29:27,613 --> 01:29:30,074
You fucking tell me who called,
and I'll tell you why.

1293
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:32,952
If it was Ashley, she's hype
'cause I fucking beat her ass.

1294
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:34,120
Girls.

1295
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,207
Don't fucking touch me.
Don't ask me questions.

1296
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:40,168
- I don't fucking want...
- Listen to me.

1297
01:29:40,668 --> 01:29:41,668
Uh...

1298
01:29:42,128 --> 01:29:44,755
- You wait right here, okay?
- Why is my mom yelling?

1299
01:29:45,214 --> 01:29:48,426
Uh, she's just talking to these ladies.
Jancey, you go home.

1300
01:29:48,509 --> 01:29:49,427
- You go home now.
- Okay.

1301
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:50,928
- Bye, Moonee.
- Bye.

1302
01:29:51,012 --> 01:29:52,847
You're not coming into my fucking place.

1303
01:29:53,556 --> 01:29:55,183
I'm not doing anything wrong.

1304
01:29:55,266 --> 01:29:57,476
You're literally coming onto
my fucking property.

1305
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:58,895
You're not coming into my room.

1306
01:29:58,978 --> 01:30:01,397
You don't have a fucking court order.
Let me see paperwork.

1307
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,274
So then can you help us
so that we can go...

1308
01:30:03,357 --> 01:30:05,067
Can I help you about what?

1309
01:30:05,151 --> 01:30:06,527
Why's my mom upset?

1310
01:30:06,944 --> 01:30:08,696
You know, I don't know, but, uh...

1311
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:10,899
They're just talking.
They gotta figure something out.

1312
01:30:11,115 --> 01:30:14,577
What are... What do they have to
figure anything out with?

1313
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:19,999
Um, I don't know. It's some sort
of confusion. But it'll be fine. Okay?

1314
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:22,043
- Mom!
- Uh...

1315
01:30:23,336 --> 01:30:25,096
You're doing this
in front of my fucking kid?

1316
01:30:36,307 --> 01:30:38,184
Can I go back to my room now?

1317
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,102
In a little bit.

1318
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:42,480
- A couple minutes, okay?
- Yup.

1319
01:30:45,233 --> 01:30:47,526
Just... Just... Moonee.

1320
01:30:49,195 --> 01:30:52,448
Talk to the lady.
She's just got some questions for you,

1321
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:54,867
and then you can go back to your room.
All right?

1322
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,520
Can you tell me what kind of stuff
you do every day, Moonee?

1323
01:31:04,043 --> 01:31:05,670
Do you ever go swimming in the pool?

1324
01:31:07,463 --> 01:31:08,463
Yeah?

1325
01:31:10,633 --> 01:31:13,233
What else? What kind of stuff do you like
to do with your friends?

1326
01:32:08,232 --> 01:32:09,859
What's going on?

1327
01:32:11,277 --> 01:32:13,112
Nothing, baby. Go back to bed.

1328
01:33:00,534 --> 01:33:03,871
- Whatcha doin' all wet, Mom?
- Nothing.

1329
01:33:09,502 --> 01:33:10,795
<i>Come here.</i>

1330
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:23,307
Tag, you're it.

1331
01:33:26,227 --> 01:33:27,645
It's very good.

1332
01:33:28,771 --> 01:33:30,731
Tickle monster!

1333
01:33:31,065 --> 01:33:34,151
I'm the tickle monster!

1334
01:33:44,495 --> 01:33:47,581
If there are any boxes over there
that are less than half-full,

1335
01:33:47,665 --> 01:33:49,208
throw them out, okay?

1336
01:33:50,084 --> 01:33:51,127
Yeah, yeah.

1337
01:33:52,753 --> 01:33:54,004
Ooh, ooh.

1338
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:55,713
- Ooh-ooh.
- Ooh-ooh.

1339
01:33:55,756 --> 01:33:57,633
Girl, those are from the outside.

1340
01:33:57,716 --> 01:34:01,095
Your grubby little fingers
trying to unlock this window.

1341
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,180
You better clean that.

1342
01:34:10,354 --> 01:34:11,514
Don't do that, don't do that.

1343
01:34:11,814 --> 01:34:14,608
If DCF has a fucking problem
with that, eff them.

1344
01:34:14,775 --> 01:34:15,775
What?

1345
01:34:16,026 --> 01:34:18,571
Dirty.

1346
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:22,450
You better clean up those underpants.

1347
01:34:22,783 --> 01:34:24,618
Thank you.

1348
01:34:30,499 --> 01:34:32,585
- Hey!
- Hey.

1349
01:34:32,793 --> 01:34:34,211
- What's up?
- You need towels?

1350
01:34:34,795 --> 01:34:35,796
No.

1351
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,801
- Hmm. Sometime, a little bit.
- I have a present for you.

1352
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:43,762
This is for you,
but make sure you smoke all of it.

1353
01:34:44,138 --> 01:34:46,432
- Like, all of it.
- Yes.

1354
01:34:47,224 --> 01:34:48,642
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1355
01:34:50,728 --> 01:34:52,062
Enjoy that shit, girl.

1356
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:53,730
Thank you. Hey!

1357
01:34:55,316 --> 01:34:57,818
And don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

1358
01:34:58,903 --> 01:35:00,488
I promise. It's gonna be okay.

1359
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:26,472
- I don't know why we just, like...
- Just look at them.

1360
01:35:27,681 --> 01:35:28,766
Okay.

1361
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:33,771
What's your...
What's your favorite thing to watch on TV?

1362
01:35:38,192 --> 01:35:41,362
Boys. Good morning.

1363
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,115
Yeah. You gotta go home.

1364
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,577
There's cars coming through here.
We got guests.

1365
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:54,208
No harm, no foul.

1366
01:35:55,042 --> 01:35:56,043
"No foul."

1367
01:35:56,794 --> 01:35:58,629
There's a joke in there somewhere.

1368
01:35:59,797 --> 01:36:00,923
All right, fellas.

1369
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,010
All right. Have a good day.

1370
01:36:46,218 --> 01:36:47,970
Wow!

1371
01:36:50,055 --> 01:36:53,726
- Moonee, come get a plate.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1372
01:36:54,226 --> 01:36:57,187
Mm... Good.

1373
01:36:59,023 --> 01:37:02,818
I'm going to eat a strawberry
and a raspberry at the same time.

1374
01:37:11,619 --> 01:37:13,454
Man, oh, man, that's gross.

1375
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:17,541
I wish they made forks out of candy.

1376
01:37:22,046 --> 01:37:24,965
Then you could eat the fork
after your meal.

1377
01:37:33,724 --> 01:37:35,017
I love this.

1378
01:37:41,899 --> 01:37:42,941
Ahh!

1379
01:37:43,525 --> 01:37:46,153
Oh, I feel like I'm going to burp.

1380
01:37:48,614 --> 01:37:50,366
Wish I had a bigger stomach.

1381
01:37:50,824 --> 01:37:51,867
Like I was pregnant.

1382
01:37:52,576 --> 01:37:54,161
I'd fit food in there.

1383
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:59,166
We gotta come here again.

1384
01:38:02,378 --> 01:38:03,962
This is the life, man.

1385
01:38:04,588 --> 01:38:06,423
Better than a cruise.

1386
01:38:07,466 --> 01:38:09,051
I mean, there's...

1387
01:38:09,343 --> 01:38:12,346
There's not a cruise
made out of all this food.

1388
01:38:12,429 --> 01:38:13,889
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1389
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:15,412
May I have your room number, please?

1390
01:38:15,641 --> 01:38:18,727
- 323.
- Thank you. Have a great stay.

1391
01:38:20,437 --> 01:38:22,277
Excuse me,
can I have your room number, please?

1392
01:38:31,407 --> 01:38:34,201
Hi, there. I need to speak
with the manager, please.

1393
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:35,494
Bobby...

1394
01:38:37,246 --> 01:38:38,246
I know.

1395
01:39:11,196 --> 01:39:12,614
Mom, what's going on?

1396
01:39:13,615 --> 01:39:16,160
- It's okay, baby.
- What's okay?

1397
01:39:25,836 --> 01:39:28,213
That's actually what we have
in our paperwork.

1398
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:29,380
Oh, okay.

1399
01:39:31,592 --> 01:39:32,968
- Excuse me.
- Hi, Halley.

1400
01:39:33,051 --> 01:39:34,636
- Thank you.
- Hi, Moonee.

1401
01:39:41,727 --> 01:39:42,728
Can I help you?

1402
01:39:42,811 --> 01:39:46,106
Halley, these DCF officers
are here in regards to Moonee.

1403
01:39:47,441 --> 01:39:49,485
You wanna inspect my room, be my guest.

1404
01:39:52,738 --> 01:39:54,740
You wanna shake my boxes?

1405
01:39:54,823 --> 01:39:56,325
You wanna look inside my fridge?

1406
01:40:01,038 --> 01:40:03,499
- Halley.
- What?

1407
01:40:03,582 --> 01:40:04,708
We have security footage

1408
01:40:04,792 --> 01:40:07,503
showing nine different men
entering and exiting your room.

1409
01:40:07,586 --> 01:40:12,257
Why don't you take Moonee outside
so we can talk to Halley privately?

1410
01:40:13,175 --> 01:40:15,552
- What's going on?
- Um...

1411
01:40:17,179 --> 01:40:20,557
Well, you know what? We just wanna
make sure that you're safe, okay?

1412
01:40:20,933 --> 01:40:23,435
We've also obtained
this online classified ad

1413
01:40:23,519 --> 01:40:25,813
soliciting customers for sexual activities

1414
01:40:25,896 --> 01:40:27,439
with your phone number attached.

1415
01:40:27,523 --> 01:40:30,818
Well, you're gonna go somewhere
really fun, and we're gonna have toys...

1416
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:32,361
But how many days?

1417
01:40:32,611 --> 01:40:35,989
- It'll only be temporary, okay?
- What's temporary?

1418
01:40:36,073 --> 01:40:38,575
Temporary means
just for a little bit of time.

1419
01:40:39,243 --> 01:40:42,830
- Can we do that?
- I guess so.

1420
01:40:42,913 --> 01:40:45,916
Okay. Thank you. You're such a big girl.
You know that?

1421
01:40:46,667 --> 01:40:47,543
No.

1422
01:40:47,626 --> 01:40:50,355
...that's able to take her. But luckily,
we have a family in Polk County

1423
01:40:50,379 --> 01:40:53,257
that can take her for the entire course
of the investigation. Okay?

1424
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,634
Could I say goodbye to my friend Scooty?

1425
01:40:56,343 --> 01:40:59,096
- Uh...
- He's down in 223.

1426
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:01,473
We just need to check
to see if that's okay.

1427
01:41:02,224 --> 01:41:04,518
She wants to say goodbye
to her friend Scooty.

1428
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:07,121
- It's okay for her to say goodbye, right?
- I'll take her down.

1429
01:41:07,563 --> 01:41:11,066
We don't say goodbye.
But you could give your friend a hug.

1430
01:41:11,483 --> 01:41:14,069
And you'll see them real soon. Okay?

1431
01:41:15,112 --> 01:41:17,281
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go. Come on.

1432
01:41:17,364 --> 01:41:19,926
My colleague's gonna take Moonee
downstairs to say goodbye to her friend.

1433
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:22,887
And in the meantime, it'd be great if you
could pack a bag with necessities.

1434
01:41:22,911 --> 01:41:24,538
Also, maybe a favorite doll or toy.

1435
01:41:56,528 --> 01:41:57,362
Yes?

1436
01:41:57,446 --> 01:42:00,657
Hello, miss. My name is Susan Watson.
I'm with DCF.

1437
01:42:01,158 --> 01:42:01,992
We have a quick favor to ask...

1438
01:42:02,075 --> 01:42:04,536
Ashley, what happened to your face?

1439
01:42:08,999 --> 01:42:13,754
...little cinnamon on it. The right
temperature, take your breath away.

1440
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:17,549
Okay. We can do a hug or a high-five.

1441
01:42:17,883 --> 01:42:20,886
- Come here, Moonee.
- Thank you so much.

1442
01:42:22,846 --> 01:42:25,265
- I hope your eye feels better.
- Thank you, babe.

1443
01:42:26,683 --> 01:42:29,144
All right. Thank you so much. Okay?

1444
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:31,521
My mom said you're going
to another family.

1445
01:42:31,605 --> 01:42:32,481
- Scooty.
- What?

1446
01:42:32,564 --> 01:42:33,564
Thank you.

1447
01:42:34,358 --> 01:42:36,985
Why did he say
I was going to another family?

1448
01:42:37,069 --> 01:42:39,589
You're just gonna go live with a family
just for a little while.

1449
01:42:47,037 --> 01:42:50,248
- Just temporary, okay?
- Moonee, we're going to your room, okay?

1450
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:51,917
Okay.

1451
01:42:54,211 --> 01:42:55,253
Watch the steps.

1452
01:43:02,594 --> 01:43:05,180
Are those cops going to take my mom away?

1453
01:43:05,555 --> 01:43:08,433
- No, they're not.
- Are they gonna take me to another family?

1454
01:43:08,517 --> 01:43:11,478
I'm gonna take you to a nice family
where you're gonna be okay,

1455
01:43:11,561 --> 01:43:12,956
just for a little while. Is that okay?

1456
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:14,481
- Well, I don't want to.
- Moonee.

1457
01:43:14,564 --> 01:43:16,650
- I don't want to go.
- Moonee, I know.

1458
01:43:25,242 --> 01:43:26,469
- Moonee, will you please listen?
- Stop.

1459
01:43:26,493 --> 01:43:27,929
- Honey, your mom knows all about it.
- Stop!

1460
01:43:27,953 --> 01:43:29,204
Your mom said it was okay.

1461
01:43:42,467 --> 01:43:45,804
- Do you want me to get super angry?
- No, I don't. That's why...

1462
01:43:46,763 --> 01:43:50,517
Hey, I'm gonna... fix those machines
by the end of the week.

1463
01:43:52,394 --> 01:43:53,394
Okay.

1464
01:43:55,897 --> 01:43:57,583
- Would you please go get her parent?
- Yes, okay.

1465
01:43:57,607 --> 01:44:00,402
- Stop!
- Honey, honey. She's gonna... Calm down.

1466
01:44:02,487 --> 01:44:04,489
- Halley?
- Jesus Christ!

1467
01:44:04,573 --> 01:44:07,576
- Sweetie, come on...
- You are... I'm not your sweetie!

1468
01:44:07,659 --> 01:44:09,578
Being very emotional right now.

1469
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:14,166
You want me to help you
take my child away?

1470
01:44:14,249 --> 01:44:16,877
- I am so sor...
- Are you retarded? You're stupid, right?

1471
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,087
- I don't have to go.
- Take a breath. Sweetie.

1472
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:23,842
You're literally asking me to help you
take away my fucking kid!

1473
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:25,403
- This is what's best right now.
- Halley, calm down.

1474
01:44:25,427 --> 01:44:27,137
Calm down? Calm down?

1475
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:30,265
You want me to fuckin' help, right?
You want me to fuckin' help, right?

1476
01:44:30,348 --> 01:44:32,434
- Get the fuck outta my house!
- Hey, calm down.

1477
01:44:32,517 --> 01:44:35,103
Stop! You're such a liar!

1478
01:44:35,687 --> 01:44:37,522
You're such a liar!

1479
01:44:37,731 --> 01:44:39,524
You're a fucking... Don't touch me!

1480
01:44:39,608 --> 01:44:41,168
- Stop.
- She just went to get your mom.

1481
01:44:41,193 --> 01:44:43,653
You have to stop!

1482
01:44:44,404 --> 01:44:45,864
I don't wanna go!

1483
01:44:47,741 --> 01:44:49,201
- Liar!
- Moonee!

1484
01:44:50,619 --> 01:44:52,329
Shut the fuck up! Don't touch...

1485
01:44:54,498 --> 01:44:55,499
Moonee!

1486
01:44:56,792 --> 01:44:59,795
Moonee! Oh, my God. Officer!

1487
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:05,008
...fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!

1488
01:45:05,842 --> 01:45:06,842
Officer!

1489
01:45:08,386 --> 01:45:10,764
- I don't care!
- The child's running!

1490
01:45:15,769 --> 01:45:18,688
No! No. That way. Towards the highway!

1491
01:45:18,772 --> 01:45:21,233
- 81, I got a child running eastbound...
- What's going on?

1492
01:45:21,316 --> 01:45:22,317
I don't know. Just...

1493
01:45:26,530 --> 01:45:29,950
- DCF...
- Jesus Christ.

1494
01:45:31,618 --> 01:45:32,702
I tried to hold her.

1495
01:45:32,786 --> 01:45:34,579
You let her just run away?

1496
01:45:34,663 --> 01:45:37,582
- Halley, will you please just...
- And I'm the one who's unfit?

1497
01:45:39,376 --> 01:45:41,711
Fuck you!

1498
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,380
Jancey!

1499
01:45:52,472 --> 01:45:53,472
Hi, Moonee.

1500
01:45:53,515 --> 01:45:54,933
Here you go, honey.

1501
01:45:55,308 --> 01:45:57,352
Jancey. Come, honey. It's time to eat.

1502
01:45:58,478 --> 01:46:00,647
We're just about to have lunch,
are you hungry?

1503
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:02,482
Moonee, you want a bowl, honey?

1504
01:46:09,322 --> 01:46:10,365
Moonee, what's wrong?

1505
01:46:11,741 --> 01:46:14,494
Lucy! <i>Por favor</i>, look at this!

1506
01:46:17,706 --> 01:46:18,706
Please!

1507
01:46:20,458 --> 01:46:22,002
You're scaring me, Moonee.

1508
01:46:22,085 --> 01:46:27,132
You're my best friend, and this may be
the only time I'm going to see you again.

1509
01:46:27,215 --> 01:46:28,466
What's going on?

1510
01:46:29,134 --> 01:46:31,261
Just wait right here, okay? Don't move.

1511
01:46:51,281 --> 01:46:53,325
I can't say it.

1512
01:47:00,749 --> 01:47:02,417
Bye!

1512
01:47:03,305 --> 01:48:03,173
