Is the camera working?

3
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,500
The statement!

4
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,292
Hurry.

5
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:01,083
Bring him to me.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Get up!

7
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:16,333
He's waiting for you!

8
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,625
Move it, move it.

9
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:19,917
On your knees!

10
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,333
Read this, you dog!

11
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,333
Read!

00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,208
"In exchange for my life,

00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:38,542

"It is <i>very time</i>

20
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,792
I cannot say that.

Read!

22

Everyone wants to be French,
even you.

23
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,542
There are too many mistakes!

24
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:08,708
Let me say it my way.

25
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:11,167
Fine,<i> but fast it you do!</i>

Hurry up, you dog!

28
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:26,417
Hello. My name is
Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath.

29
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,792
And I'm alive and well.

30
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,667
To the displeasure of despots,

31
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,708
tyrants and adversaries
of our beautiful country.

32
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,667
Sorry, enemies,
send back the champagne and confetti.

33
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,458
OSS 117 is not dead.

34
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:42,750
What did he say?

35
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,792
I address
President Giscard d'Estaing.

36
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,792
Via him,
I address all of France.

37
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:54,750
France as well its regions,

38
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:57,917
its landscapes and countryside.

39
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,292
I refer also

40
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
to our forests, our salt flats.

41
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,625
And our coveted products
like Burgundy,

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,292
Beaufort,

43
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,375
nougat, calissons, kouign-amann.

44
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,667
What's kouign-amann?

45
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,250
Kouign-amann, I'll kill you!

46
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,417
Before transmitting
my captors' grievances,

47
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:21,583
I wish you all a happy, healthy 1981.

48
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,083
Erase the end and edit the tape!

49
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,875
Where you going?

50
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,875
Just dawdling.

51
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,458
PANJSHIR VALLEY, AFGHANISTAN

52
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,625
We'll have a little talk.

53
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:18,833
With pleasure.

54
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,000
So you have no more weapons?

55
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,167
Pity for a military superpower.

56
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,833
We have all we need!

57
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,167
No, there's nothing in the USSR.

58
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:31,417
Tons of weapons!
Enough to blow up the planet.

59
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:32,917
Dream on!

60
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,958
Ready for takeoff?

61
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,958
Yes, hurry!

62
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,333
What are these?

63
00:04:58,833 --> 00:04:59,958
Wood crates.

64
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,833
And these?

65
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,000
What are they?

66
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,875
They look like weapons.

67
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:11,958
But do they work?

68
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,958
Good luck, comrade!

69
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,833
Sorry, this is my taxi.

70
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,125
Original.

71
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,625
Found it!

72
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,917
I guess you're OSS 117.

73
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,458
And you're CIA.

74
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,958
In case of trouble, you Americans...

75
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,625
you lend a hand but... always late.

76
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,667
Sorry, it was Near Year's Eve.
Lots of traffic.

77
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,750
Isn't it midnight on the dot
now in the States?

78
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:18,833
Happy New Year, 117.

79
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,833
Well, it's getting off to...

80
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:23,417
one hell of a start.

Nice! Thanks for the peek.

Pretty view.

- Hi, Jacquard.

Hello, Martine.

106

I don't get a "hello"?

107
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,125
Excuse me.

108
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,042
Hello, Margaret.

Politburo!

110
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:14,542
De La Bath, you scared me stiff!

111
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,042
I made a blotch.

112
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,042
Happy New year, Ledentu.

113
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,875
Good to see you.

114
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,583
Me too. Best wishes.

115
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,500
And lots of health!

116
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,750
- Health is important.
- I'll say!

117
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:30,292
Years go by
and we don't grow younger.

118
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,042
What are you getting at?

119
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,750
Time flies
but leaves you untouched.

120
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:37,208
I found another wrinkle this morning.

121
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,750
Come now. Where?

122
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,042
Here.

123
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,292
Where, pray tell?

124
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,875
Where? What's this?

125
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,292
Oh yes!

126
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,458
Yes, yes.

127
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,625
There's another one next to it.

128
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,458
There's one here.

129
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:00,208
Lots of tiny ones!
You didn't say so.

130
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:01,417
They're all over.

131
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Enough.

132
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,250
I'll go see the boss.

133
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,125
No, no he's busy.

134
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,583
I have my post-mission debriefing.

135
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,750
But there's...

136
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,292
- Happy New Year, boss.
- Hubert! Happy New Year.

137
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Glad to see you alive!

138
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,208
I like to see life as a series of...

139
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:19,417
Yes, of course.

140
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,458
Serge...

141
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,125
meet Hubert.

148
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,375
the real thing, the one and only.

149
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:38,542
The Legend.

150
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,667
Clammy palms, totally.

Hello.

152
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,583
Hello.

153
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,458
I am so loving this... Sorry.

154
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,083
Serge is our new recruit.

155
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,250
Really.

156
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,792
Forgive me.
For me, you're a reference.

157
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,375
I'd even say, a goal.

158
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,708
And you're still...

159
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,083
in good shape.
Not someone to mess with.

160
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,625
Handsome.

161
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,500
A handsome...

162
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:14,208
I mean a real...

163
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,125
a handsome...

164
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:22,500
Sir, I just wanted to say
France is what it is thanks to you.

165
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,417
Yes. And General De Gaulle too.

166
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,250
Yes but...

167
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,583
- It's true.
- True.

168
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:27,792
- Yes.
- Yes.

169
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,917
- Sorry, have a seat.
- I'm fine.

170
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,833
Serge, your passport.

171
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,500
And President René Coty?

172
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,000
What was President Rene Coty like?
Was he cool?

173
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:39,542
Suit, clean-shaved, short hair.

174
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,250
We knew what he wasn't.

175
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,167
Serge, come and take your passport.

176
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,375
Your name is Bob Nightingale.

177
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,083
Bob Nighting-what?

178
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:52,667
We use American aliases now.

179
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:53,833
Cool, right?

180
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:54,750
Very.

181
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:56,292
France counts on you, Serge.

182
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,792
He's off to Africa tomorrow.

183
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,667
You know how fond

184
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,333
our President is
of the dark continent.

185
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,625
He hunted 3 more elephants
last month.

186
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
3 elephants?

187
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,125
There are tons.

188
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Armand.

189
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,458
I'll kiss Africa for you
and I may go further.

190
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,625
Start with a tie and slacks.

191
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,458
- Slacks?
- Pants.

192
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,667
Good one, Hubert.

193
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:25,875
Very funny.

194
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,667
This is cool.

195
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:33,750
That Serge is an excellent recruit.

196
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:34,958
Seems so.

197
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,417
So full of pep.

198
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,000
Dynamism galore.

199
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,375
So talented! So entertaining!

200
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,042
And those eyes... that hair.

201
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,958
Like you 30 years ago.

202
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,500
"OSS 1001" doesn't ring well.

203
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:57,333
We finished 3-digit code names.
Time to start with 4 digits.

204
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:58,958
We did 800s and 900s?

205
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,083
Sure did!
The meter keeps on ticking.

206
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,542
I don't recall 835.
Was there one?

207
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,333
834, tall bald fellow.

208
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,417
836, from the South, rolled his r's.

209
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,458
But who was 835?

210
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:17,208
So, how did your mission go?

211
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,958
Perfectly well.

212
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,500
Soviet comfort
combined with Afghan hospitality,

213
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:23,875
I couldn't leave.

214
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,667
Those damn Commies!

215
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,167
There, here!

216
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,792
Everywhere. They're all over.

217
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,417
Imagine if Mitterrand
becomes president.

218
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,417
Communists running France.

219
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,167
I have night sweats, Armand.

220
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,625
No private property,
long lines at empty stores.

221
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,542
No water, no electricity.

222
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,083
Russian tanks on the Champs-Elysées.

223
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,583
Money pouring into Switzerland.

224
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:45,792
Bankruptcy!

225
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,167
Civil war! That's right.

226
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,875
Mitterrand!
Who'd vote for his platform?

227
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,208
France elected General de Gaulle.

228
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,500
We'd never do anything so dumb.

229
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,042
May God hear you!

230
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,042
- So when do I leave?
- You don't.

231
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:02,958
Meaning?

232
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:04,833
I have something better.

233
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,583
Computer science.

234
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,250
It's quite bold, you'll see.

235
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:14,500
You'll put all our files
into huge calculators

236
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:17,042
that pop them out as records.

237
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,208
Like vinyl record, but floppy.

238
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,167
What's the point?

239
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,875
I don't know yet,
but odds are we save space.

240
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:26,667
Clever.

241
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,833
Excuse me, Armand.

242
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,167
How does this technology concern me?

243
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,000
Hubert, aren't you the best?

244
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,375
If I say "yes",
I'd be pretentious.

245
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,042
And "no" would be stupid.

246
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,292
So usher us into the 21st century.

247
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,250
- At your service.
- Cool!

248
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:51,875
Hello.

249
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:54,250
Hello.

250
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:55,667
Get to work, Hubert.

251
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Armand, I...

252
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,500
Here, usually if you send a request,

253
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,958
and you're connected,

254
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,208
you can set up your gismo.

255
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,875
- Gismo?
- Machine.

256
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:18,458
Try in octo.
The 16-byte often freezes.

257
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,667
Really? So...

258
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,125
So I'll erase.

259
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,917
No, it's Cobol.

260
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,500
With Unix, if you don't compile,
you crash.

261
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,708
Old-timer!

262
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,958
If it doesn't work,
there's a surefire solution.

263
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,458
Unplug it

264
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:36,917
and plug it back in.

265
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,375
Copy that.

266
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,500
Hey, de La Bath.

267
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,708
Yes?

268
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,375
Know what we call a Unix developer

269
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,500
with no root-directory issues?

270
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:53,917
No.

271
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,750
A guy who never wrote a line of code!

272
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
A Poser!

273
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:32,750
- Josy?
- Yes, boss?

274
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,125
Get me 117.

275
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,250
You kill me, Rumineau!

276
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,250
Hubert? It's Josy.

277
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,625
Armand wants you.

278
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:42,792
On my way up.

279
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:46,792
Hello, de La Bath!

280
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,458
- Hey, Martichou.
- Tough mission?

281
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,417
Wait till your gismo crashes.

282
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,333
You sent for me?

283
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:56,792
What's that on your nose?

284
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:00,042
Oh yeah.

285
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:01,833
You leave for Africa.

286
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,625
Nope.

287
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,417
Why not?

288
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,917
I can't.
I computerized every agent's file.

289
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,667
Accounting, pay slips...
Next is cafeteria inventory.

290
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:15,458
I'd love to,
but I'm booked till the year 2000.

291
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,250
By the way...

292
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,250
this is for you.

293
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,458
- What is it?
- Your career.

294
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:23,500
One day they'll be smaller.

295
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,167
Listen to me, Hubert.

296
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,500
We've lost contact with OSS 1001.

297
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:30,417
He set foot in Africa two weeks ago

298
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,250
and slipped off the radar.

299
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,625
It seemed inevitable.

300
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,542
Get him out of this jam.

301
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,125
I'm a spy, not a babysitter.

302
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,875
The order comes from very high up.

303
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,208
In that case...

304
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,583
Take over the mission.

305
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,750
It's very delicate.
It requires mastery

306
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,333
of politico-strategic stakes
in Africa.

307
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,333
Of course.

308
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,292
Hubert...

309
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,167
your take on Africa?

310
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,750
Africans are happy people.

311
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:10,750
They're nice, like to laugh.

312
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,000
Good dancers.

313
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,292
Alas, they're also careless
and unreliable.

314
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,167
They need prodding.
Lots of germs there.

315
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,917
Excellent analysis.

316
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,167
Their women wear no panties
while cooking.

317
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,083
Our relationship with Africa
is precious.

318
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,292
Yes.

319
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,542
They're our friends,
our brothers almost.

320
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:36,125
Also, we operate their diamond mines,
oil fields, gas, uranium.

321
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:37,875
It's sort of France.

322
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,750
Forget that, Hubert.

323
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:42,250
The golden colonial age is over.

324
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,000
They're independent now.

325
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,792
You had me going!

326
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,333
Follow me to the crisis room.

327
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:04,958
Independent...

328
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,000
I didn't see it coming.

329
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,583
Good one!

330
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,750
<i>Dear friends...</i>

331
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,375
<i>you are my brothers.</i>

332
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:18,583
President Kudjo Sangawe Bamba.

333
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,208
My pleasure.

334
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,167
<i>I hope for another victory!</i>

335
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,667
In a month, they hold elections.

336
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,208
They're democratic.
Overseen by France.

337
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:31,625
President Kudjo Sangawe Bamba
will win with 84% of the vote.

338
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:33,833
84%? Hats off.

339
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,208
He is adored.

340
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,417
But things are less rosy
than they appear.

341
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,833
Our informers say there is agitation
among rebel factions.

342
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,792
FCPA, SPMA,

343
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,333
FLDA,

344
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,375
National Liberation Movement.

345
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,417
Liberation Front.

346
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,917
- Liberation from what?
- Democracy Now.

347
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,875
Popular Surge,

348
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,125
and so on.

349
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,583
Same guy each time?

350
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,250
Watch out, Hubert.

351
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,917
Our African friends
are oversensitive.

352
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,083
They feel disrespected, disdained.

353
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,125
They see racism everywhere.

354
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,208
Including probably in your humor.

355
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,625
As if... Armand, I...

356
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,333
I know, Hubert. I know you.

357
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:17,458
But be careful of what you say.

358
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,583
But they all look alike.

359
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,958
- Officially, no.
- Copy that.

360
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,917
President Bamba wants our help.

361
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:26,958
Our discreet help.

362
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,250
Go there and clear this up.

363
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:31,375
See what the rebels are plotting

364
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:34,083
and get them all to toe the line.

365
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,875
Bring back Serge
and reassure the President.

366
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:39,333
And for pity's sake, avoid a coup.

367
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,375
We'd need another
to reinstate the President.

368
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,667
All these democratic changes
cost France a fortune.

369
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,375
Unlimited equipment?

370
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,875
Unlimited equipment.

371
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,667
Your name is Émile Cousin.

372
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,667
As might be expected,
you work in oil.

373
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:01,542
For ELF.

374
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,125
Why Émile Cousin?

375
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,125
<i>3 digits.</i>

376
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:06,000
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

377
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,583
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>

378
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,583
<i>No misunderstandings.</i>

379
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,542
<i>Dexterity,
discretion, concentration.</i>

380
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:17,000
<i>Study the continent's history
in depth.</i>

381
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,625
<i>Its new geopolitical alliances.</i>

382
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:26,875
First time in Africa?

383
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:29,417
Excuse me?

384
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,625
Business or vacation?

385
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,125
Business.

386
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,917
You'll see,
business becomes vacation there.

387
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,875
AFRICA

388
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,875
Émile Cousin!

389
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,500
KUDJO SANGAWE BAMBA AIRPORT

390
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,292
Mr. Cousin!

391
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,583
Léon Nkomo, chief of protocol.

392
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,750
- Welcome to Africa!
- Thank you.

393
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:17,250
Follow me please.

394
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,625
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

395
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,583
Still crazy in love!

396
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,917
Bamba's end is fast approaching.

397
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,708
But I need more weapons.

398
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:54,458
That's why I'm here.

399
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,292
And to observe this lovely specimen.

400
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,500
You must be some huntress.

401
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,625
I hunt dictators.

402
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,250
When is delivery?

403
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:07,625
Soon, soon.

404
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:08,875
Make it fast.

405
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,958
Sources tell me
a French spy just arrived.

406
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,417
Those imperialists will do anything

407
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,292
to keep Bamba in power.

408
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,583
Don't worry, Zéphyrine.

409
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,333
Our new supplier is very reliable.

410
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,542
Come!

411
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:36,250
I'll take care of the Frenchman.

412
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,208
Hello!

413
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,625
How delightful!

414
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Thank you!

415
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:20,000
President Bamba
will receive you at 4.

416
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,250
Perfect.

417
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:23,333
I'll put on my colonial suit.

418
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,083
White. Light.

419
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,000
My light suit.

420
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Hi there!

421
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:42,250
Thank you so much!

422
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,708
Wait, wait...

423
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:52,625
What are you doing?

424
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:54,333
Carrying your bags.

425
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:55,542
It's my job.

426
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,125
What are these prejudices?

427
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,833
Give them to me.

428
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:00,750
Come on...

429
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:05,708
There you go.

430
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:08,958
Thank you.

431
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,542
Hello.

432
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,625
- Émile Cousin.
- Welcome, Mr. Cousin.

433
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,750
Micheline Pierson, customer service.

434
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:24,583
Honored to have you here.

435
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,875
Thrilled to have you
servicing customers.

436
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:37,542
If you have the tiniest problem,
call. I aim to please.

437
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,250
I think I may have a lot of problems.

438
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:42,667
Tiny ones and...

439
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:44,125
less tiny ones.

440
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,500
I'm good with big problems,
Mr. Cousin.

441
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:49,625
Émile.

442
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,042
Micheline.

443
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:52,708
No, I prefer Émile.

444
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,542
See you soon then.

445
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:00,833
I forgot.

446
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:04,583
Did someone named Bob Nightingale
check in here?

447
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:05,833
Nightingale?

448
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,083
Doesn't ring a bell.

449
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,250
No?

450
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:11,292
Cocky playboy-type
always flirting, chatting,

451
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:14,750
making heavy-handed innuendos
with a dumb smile?

452
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,208
Not at all.

453
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,083
Well, I tried.

454
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,292
Problem?

455
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,083
Not yet.

456
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,500
Give them to me.

457
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:34,708
Here you go, sir.

458
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,375
Nice.

459
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:43,583
Perfect.

460
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,833
Hold on a sec.

461
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,250
Thanks, sir.

462
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:52,958
It's I who thank you!

463
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:54,792
Tell me.

464
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:56,917
You do this in France?

465
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,792
No, there are far fewer blacks.

466
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,542
And that's a real shame...

467
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:06,708
Here.

468
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,167
Thanks, sir.

469
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:12,292
- Welcome to Africa.
- You too!

470
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:14,375
You first.

471
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:15,792
Above all.

472
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:18,417
Have a nice day!

473
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:45,417
Comrade?

474
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:48,000
This is for you.

475
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,208
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE

476
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Thank you.

477
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,792
Hello, sir.

478
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Gentlemen.

479
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,792
Gentlemen!

480
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:21,250
Keep it up.

481
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,833
Hello, ma'am. Bravo.

482
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Gentlemen...

483
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,333
I forgot swim trunks.

484
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,167
Mr. Cousin?

485
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:50,583
His Excellency is ready.

486
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,375
Your Excellency.

487
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,542
Mr. Cousin is here.

488
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:56,792
Mr. Cousin!

489
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:58,708
My respects.

490
00:29:58,875 --> 00:29:59,917
My friend!

491
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:01,583
Mr. Cousin!

492
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,458
My respects!

493
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,500
Mr. Cousin!

494
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:13,042
What's this imbroglio?
Who is Kudjo Sangawe Bamba?

495
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,292
I am!

496
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:16,167
I am!

497
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,708
Sorry for the prank.

498
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:24,292
As you know,
I get many death threats.

499
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:28,750
These lookalikes come in handy
if ever I'm targeted.

500
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:34,167
You're in safe hands with me here.

501
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,167
Thanks for the welcome rally.

502
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,625
Not discreet but pleasant.

503
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:42,792
No stopping Africans from showing
their love of France.

504
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:43,958
You know...

505
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,042
I love France.

506
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,250
So do I.

507
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:47,583
I studied in Paris.

508
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,000
I can see myself at the Sorbonne,

509
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:53,583
dancing the jerk in a club
at Saint Germain.

510
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,792
And your music!

511
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:01,042
<i>Annie likes lollipops</i>

512
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,208
<i>Lollies flavored with anise</i>

513
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:08,292
Naughty girl.

514
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:10,542
She got lots of lollies!

515
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,333
Between us,

516
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:18,125
it beats the awful tam-tams
you hear all over here.

517
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,875
I'll say!

518
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:24,667
Mr. President,
I think we'll get along very well.

519
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,333
What a relief to speak freely.

520
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,125
The things I heard!

521
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:38,042
"They're oversensitive"...
"Wear kid gloves".

522
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:41,750
Who "they"?

523
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:44,958
You.

524
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:47,333
Blacks.

525
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:57,250
Your colleague came
and didn't even have the decency

526
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,125
to introduce himself to me.

527
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:01,708
Not the France I love.

528
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:03,917
Not the France I love either.

529
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:04,958
Not at all.

530
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,625
On behalf of France, I apologize.

531
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,542
It's very poor conduct.

532
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:12,958
But it no longer matters
because I'm here.

533
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,792
- Cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

534
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,708
It's excellent.
Flown in from London.

535
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:26,500
The only English specialties
I've tasted are duplicity

536
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:27,833
and hypocrisy.

537
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:31,708
I hope Africa finds more favor
with you.

538
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,500
Africa does not let love in easily.

539
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:37,583
Those who don't know her well
act clumsily.

540
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:39,375
Worse: offensively.

541
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:44,083
What I hear
is the voice of friendship,

542
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,042
with the timber of wisdom.

543
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,333
What's that?

544
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,375
No worries. It's a tamed leopard.

545
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:01,208
A pet dog of sorts.

546
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:04,208
In a way, but Africa-style.

547
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:06,917
Wilder. Less docile.

548
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:13,833
Sir, what can I do for you?

549
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:15,458
If rebel factions unite,

550
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:18,708
they'll imperil the democratic,
transparent elections

551
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,500
that I'm going to win.

552
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,042
- Mr. Cousin!
- Excuse me.

553
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,125
The rebels are Communist dung beetles

554
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,542
who must be exterminated.

555
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:30,042
Exterminated!

556
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,542
Commie?
Their sham knows no borders!

557
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:33,750
Here, baby.

558
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:34,958
Mr. Cousin!

559
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:36,625
If they've joined forces,

560
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,375
bring me their leader!

561
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:39,625
Count on me.

562
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,042
Léon!

563
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:50,625
<i>Enough already!</i>

564
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,375
<i>Calm down!</i>

565
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:53,625
<i>Calm!</i>

566
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,167
<i>To your spot!</i>

567
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:56,000
Why German?

568
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,958
For training animals.

569
00:33:58,458 --> 00:33:59,667
Flimsy excuse!

570
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,125
Come now, Mr. Cousin.

571
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:05,083
Léon has been my loyal servant
for 25 years.

572
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:06,375
<i>Idiot.</i>

573
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,625
I heard that.

574
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:12,708
See you soon, my friend.

575
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,542
Find me the traitor if he exists.

576
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17,417
He's scared if he exists.

577
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:19,917
I'll search nonstop if he exists.

578
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,667
And if he doesn't exist...

579
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,458
he got off good.

580
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,083
My wife.

581
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,000
Zéphyrine.

582
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,750
Émile Cousin.

583
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:38,667
Madame...

584
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,083
French?

585
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:41,667
Passionately.

586
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,292
Mr. Cousin is a friend.

587
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,542
Mr. Cousin is a Frenchman.

588
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:51,875
I'm throwing an Independence Ball
here at the palace.

589
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:54,875
I'd be honored if you came.

590
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,708
Independence, yes...

591
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,375
I heard about that.

592
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,042
Count me in, Madame.

593
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:04,958
She is of Kwélé descent.

594
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,458
Their women are beautiful but cold.

595
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:11,792
We never know what's on their mind.
All we can do is guess.

596
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:14,250
Kwélé or not, she's a woman.

597
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:16,750
There may be nothing on her mind.

598
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:21,292
Come into my arms, Mr. Cousin.

599
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,542
Sir, duty calls.

600
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,417
Enjoy! All my property is yours!

601
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:29,792
Thank you.

602
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:33,375
I wish you luck for the elections.

603
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:35,583
And... a good score!

604
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:38,458
Good score!

605
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,333
You have the yellow jersey.

606
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,833
What stage are we at?

607
00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,333
Excuse me?

608
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,542
The Tour de France.

609
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,292
The bike race.

610
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,333
I have nothing.

611
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,083
Nothing.

612
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:57,208
Here you go.

613
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:00,750
Not all at once.

614
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:03,875
Here.

615
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,833
Good evening, Émile.

616
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,250
Micheline.

617
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:37,917
Is your room to your liking?

618
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,667
Got everything you need?

619
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:41,250
Not anymore.

620
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:11,125
Oh yes.

621
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,458
It's coming, it's coming.

622
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,875
- Yes?
- Yes.

623
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:18,583
We have plenty of time.

624
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:21,292
Yes.

625
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:23,125
All night long, Micheline.

626
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:25,750
There, it's coming.

627
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:28,625
It's going to come.

628
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:31,083
We have time...

629
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:36,583
This is what you were waiting for.

630
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,750
Yes, Émile.

631
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:43,333
I'm sorry.

632
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,750
I don't get it.

633
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,292
It doesn't matter.

634
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,250
Don't say it doesn't matter.

635
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,167
As if it didn't matter.

636
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,417
I swear this never happened before.

637
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:04,583
I've had lots of affairs.

638
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:08,000
Pairings, intercourse. Galore.

639
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:10,292
I always planted the flag.

640
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,958
It would be crude to list them.

641
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,583
Can we stop the music?

642
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,750
Excuse me.

643
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:28,500
No later than last year, in Tangiers.

644
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,375
Soraya.

645
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:31,958
Sublime Moroccan.

646
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:35,208
I can still here her begging.

647
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:38,625
"Don't stop, <i>zarma,
zarma,</i> don't stop!"

648
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,625
And Margaret in Boston, a redhead.

649
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:42,875
Gorgeous nonetheless.

650
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:45,042
She was on the floor, worn out.

651
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:49,250
"You kill me, oh la la,
you kill me..."

652
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,708
Or Fong, in Seoul, in tears.

653
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:56,333
"Too much good, too much good!
So good!"

654
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,292
"Too much good, too much good!"

655
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,583
It must be the pili-pili.

656
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:03,875
You're leaving?

657
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:05,708
It's wiser.

658
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:09,833
Goodnight, Mr. Cousin.

659
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:12,625
Goodnight.

660
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Strange idea.

661
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,250
<i>Front desk.</i>

662
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,417
Micheline Pierson, please.

663
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:57,042
<i>Hold on, please.</i>

664
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,667
This is too much.

665
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,875
<i>What?</i>

666
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Hello.

667
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:36,208
- How are you?
- Fine.

668
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:38,500
I went to bed very early.
And you?

669
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,417
Fine, fine...

670
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:43,042
Better, better, better... Relaxed.

671
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,250
Relaxed.

672
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:47,125
There was a huge snake in my bed.

673
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:49,292
Come now, Mr. Cousin.

674
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:51,292
I soothed it with a flute.

675
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:57,125
Dinner tonight?

676
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:01,042
Forget all that.
It was a bad idea.

677
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,125
I understand.

678
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:06,417
You don't mix work and pleasure.

679
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,708
I do! But where's the pleasure?

680
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:14,500
I'm going to the pool.

681
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:15,833
There is no pool.

682
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:19,625
Yes?

683
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,083
Your name?

684
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:25,708
Room number?

685
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:30,083
He was here a minute ago.

686
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:03,208
Why are you here?

687
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:04,875
How about you?

688
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:06,708
I live here.

689
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Sit down.

690
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,083
Now tell me why you speak German.

691
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,917
I told you. It's the language used
to tame animals.

692
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:22,500
I think the German language
was used more nefariously.

693
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:25,083
What were you doing in 1940?

694
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,750
Learning to walk.

695
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:28,875
Learning to march, rather.

696
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,000
- I want an explanation.
- What can I say?

697
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:35,458
Why German? It's a good language
for giving orders.

698
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,458
Yes, we noticed in France.

699
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:39,917
It's a clear, resounding language.

700
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:41,792
Animals understand the intention.

701
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:46,833
I have my eyes on you.

702
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,292
One last thing.

703
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,792
Where did you learn German?

704
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:57,958
High school.

705
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:00,333
Your teacher's name?

706
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:02,917
Mr. Bambuto.

707
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:08,000
"O" or "e-a-u"?

708
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:13,708
I'll check.

709
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:24,708
Bam-bu-to.

710
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:51,875
Hello, sir!

711
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:53,583
Come! Come!

712
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:57,750
No thanks, I'm good.

713
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,708
Try it on, no strings.

714
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,167
With your build, I can tell

715
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03,583
you'll look great.

716
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,375
No, nothing beats
a bespoke Smalto suit.

717
00:47:06,542 --> 00:47:07,708
I insist.

718
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,875
Look! What did I say?

719
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:15,375
- Magnificent!
- Yes, it's true.

720
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,167
A real Black!

721
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:23,125
Nice bibelots.

722
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,042
Cute little hippo.

723
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:29,083
- Useless but cute.
- Don't think that.

724
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,583
The hippo is the brute strength
that God masters

725
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,583
but man cannot tame.

726
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:35,875
Really?

727
00:47:36,042 --> 00:47:38,458
It stops you from being manipulated.

728
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:41,875
It helps you
to confront unsettling emotions.

729
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:45,083
It heals
mental turmoil and confusion.

730
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:47,000
It keeps the family safe.

731
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:48,375
This thing?

732
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:52,042
And it's also good
for dry, cracked skin.

733
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,833
No thanks, I have hydrating creams.

734
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:57,292
You touch it, you buy it.

735
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,542
I don't want it, thanks.

736
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,750
Thief!

737
00:48:00,792 --> 00:48:01,958
- Thief!
- What?

738
00:48:02,167 --> 00:48:03,167
Thief!

739
00:48:04,042 --> 00:48:06,250
Good people,
it's a misunderstanding.

740
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:08,042
He's a racist and a thief!

741
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:11,125
I'm no racist.
I'm in local garb, look!

742
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:12,958
- Thief!
- Calm down.

743
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:14,542
It's a misunder...

744
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:18,500
I'm not a racist!

745
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,208
Careful, if you...

746
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:29,792
I'm not a racist!

747
00:48:31,292 --> 00:48:33,083
Just in time. Hello, officers.

748
00:48:33,417 --> 00:48:35,667
What are you doing?

749
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:37,042
It's a mistake.

750
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,750
There's nothing racist about this.

751
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:43,708
A squabble with a merchant!

752
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:52,583
Hello.

753
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:55,542
Everything is fine.

754
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,167
I'm French.

755
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,042
Can you explain why you're here?

756
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,083
I'm talking to you, Serge.

757
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:41,708
The SDECE is looking for you.

758
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:45,750
The head of Intelligence is worried!

759
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,625
"Where can Mr. Nightingale be?"

760
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:51,125
This man's a traitor!

761
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:52,375
He duped us!

762
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:54,417
Don't listen to him.

763
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,833
I've never seen him before.

764
00:50:57,542 --> 00:50:58,792
He's a liar!

765
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,083
Change your tone!

766
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:03,625
Why didn't you meet President Bamba,
France's ally,

767
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:06,333
who needs our help to be elected?

768
00:51:06,542 --> 00:51:07,625
Shut your mouth!

769
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:09,083
Excuse me, no...

770
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,042
It's not what you think...

771
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,083
You see?

772
00:51:13,292 --> 00:51:15,250
They're shocked! Bamba is adored!

773
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:16,875
You were forewarned!

774
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:18,083
I can explain.

775
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,250
Africa's future is beautiful.

776
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:22,500
Of course.

777
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:25,583
Obviously!

778
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,417
Stop that!

779
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:49,667
A misunderstanding!

780
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,250
Thanks for the visit, but...

781
00:51:59,417 --> 00:52:01,500
I won't be taking the apartment.

782
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:04,458
His Excellency the President
apologizes.

783
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:05,875
I'm sure.

784
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:07,208
Goodbye.

785
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:15,458
You're welcome, Serge.

786
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,167
For what?

787
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,708
Nothing much. I just saved your life.

788
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,542
Saved me from what?
I was undercover!

789
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:25,167
So?
You can be undercover and polite.

790
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:26,667
I don't get it.

791
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:29,958
I infiltrated the rebels,
I'm bloody and hungry

792
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:32,625
but I gained their trust.
You ruined it!

793
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:35,208
Next time, say you infiltrated them.

794
00:52:35,542 --> 00:52:36,792
<i>Undercover</i> or not.

795
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:42,375
<i>His mission was to find you.</i>

796
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:43,417
I know.

797
00:52:43,583 --> 00:52:45,208
<i>And so it was a success.</i>

798
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:46,375
Yes, but...

799
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:48,000
<i>It can't have been easy.</i>

800
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:50,083
Armand, I admire him too,

801
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,583
but he really screwed up.

802
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,667
<i>Agents of his caliber have plans.</i>

803
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,833
He should tell me because...

804
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,042
<i>Because?</i>

805
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,542
Because his strategy is beyond me.

806
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:02,083
<i>Remember how experienced he is.</i>

807
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:03,667
<i>He may be one step ahead.</i>

808
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:06,958
Maybe,
but all I know is I almost died!

809
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:09,000
<i>Put him on please.</i>

810
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:12,875
Hubert... Armand for you.

811
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,542
- Hello, Armand.
<i>- So tell me.</i>

812
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:23,708
It's under control.
I found him. That's what matters.

813
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:25,958
He's tired but he'll get over it.

814
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,542
Just a bad scare!

815
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,125
<i>Yes, I know, he already told me.</i>

816
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:32,542
He's a beginner.
Let's be indulgent.

817
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:34,542
He can head back to Paris.

818
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,125
Call kindergarden!

819
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:41,875
<i>No one's coming back.
Not you, not Serge. Let me be clear.</i>

820
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,125
You know I operate solo.

821
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:46,458
You'll do this mission together.

822
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:48,667
Serge is great.
You're my best agent.

823
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:50,250
Your unlimited equipment

824
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:51,292
<i>has left.</i>

825
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:52,458
Good to hear.

826
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,250
But Armand...

827
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:55,833
Armand...

828
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:16,083
We announce our arrival in Africa.

829
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,750
We get a welcome rally and boubous
in exchange.

830
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:21,333
You may not enjoy it, but they do.

831
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:26,667
Your methods may be new,
but they don't work.

832
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:29,042
You just got conclusive proof.

833
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:32,125
Since we must work together,
I'll share my info.

834
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:35,125
I'm not anti-modernity.
But it doesn't work.

835
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:36,875
Agreed. Let's move forward.

836
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:40,125
The rebels have united forces
to oust Bamba.

837
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:41,250
Yes.

838
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:44,042
They're awaiting weapons.
A huge shipment.

839
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:47,417
I just don't know when or how.

840
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,625
If you hadn't outed me...

841
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:51,958
The facts, Serge.
We're wasting time.

842
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,125
Gentlemen?

843
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,875
- Drinks?
- A Suze.

844
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,250
We don't have that.

845
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:57,583
I'm sure that...

846
00:54:57,792 --> 00:54:58,792
And you?

847
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,583
A Tequila Sunrise, please.

848
00:55:00,792 --> 00:55:01,917
What's that?

849
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:03,292
Tequila, OJ, grenadine.

850
00:55:03,792 --> 00:55:05,792
Everything but the kitchen sink.

851
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
A Pernod.

852
00:55:08,542 --> 00:55:09,542
Thank you!

853
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:11,917
- Nice guy.
- No Way!

854
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:16,083
If a weapons sale is going on,
one man knows.

855
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,417
His name is Roland Lepervier.

856
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:20,750
Former mercenary up to no good.

857
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,458
- Shady arms dealer.
- My kind of guy.

858
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:27,125
His hangout is a seamy bar,
the Baobab Select.

859
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:31,458
But the main question is:
Who arms the rebels?

860
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,125
I see.

861
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,250
You see?

862
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:39,125
Wait.

863
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:40,875
Wait...

864
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,458
Russians held you hostage
in Afghanistan.

865
00:55:43,917 --> 00:55:45,083
Not for long.

866
00:55:45,292 --> 00:55:48,667
In exchange for your life,
they wanted weapons.

867
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:51,333
And President Bamba told you...

868
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,500
Thank you!

869
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:57,042
He told you
the rebels were communists.

870
00:55:57,917 --> 00:55:59,042
That's it.

871
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:02,583
Wait but...
the connection is obvious.

872
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:03,750
Yep.

873
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:05,458
- Limpid.
- Very.

874
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:06,833
It's as clear as...

875
00:56:07,042 --> 00:56:08,042
Spring water.

876
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:14,833
You knew this, Hubert?

877
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,167
You knew it!

878
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:22,042
Unbelieve... Of course!

879
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:24,958
That's why you sprung me from jail.

880
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,333
You got it.

881
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,500
I get it!

882
00:56:27,542 --> 00:56:28,667
Now I get it!

883
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:32,333
I get your strategy!
The best! The Legend!

884
00:56:32,542 --> 00:56:33,833
In flesh and blood!

885
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:38,250
Unbelievable. I'm ashamed.

886
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:42,458
I still have so much to learn.

887
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:44,083
You certainly do.

888
00:56:44,458 --> 00:56:45,292
Come on.

889
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:47,208
Let's find this Lepervier.

890
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:48,500
Yes.

891
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:50,708
You don't want to rest up?

892
00:56:50,917 --> 00:56:52,000
Why?

893
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:53,458
What's more,

894
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,167
isn't Lepervier a night owl?

895
00:56:57,458 --> 00:56:58,458
Yes!

896
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:08,042
Let go of me. Go shower.

897
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:10,042
- And shave.
- Of course.

898
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:22,708
Evening.

899
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:24,042
Good evening.

900
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:26,583
- Nice job!
- Not bad, huh?

901
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:30,000
Evening.

902
00:57:30,167 --> 00:57:31,167
Good evening.

903
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:44,708
Thanks, Miss.

904
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:49,417
The Baobab Select
is an homo spot?

905
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:51,875
Meaning?

906
00:57:52,042 --> 00:57:54,750
We're looking for a mercenary,
not a cutie-pie.

907
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:58,958
I have nothing to teach you,

908
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:03,458
but I've noticed women today like men
who own their feminine side.

909
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:06,250
Good luck
explaining that to Africans.

910
00:58:08,667 --> 00:58:09,667
Thank you.

911
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,125
- After you.
- I prefer.

912
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:16,125
You're leaving.

913
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:18,167
Micheline.

914
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:19,167
Mr. Cousin.

915
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,417
Micheline Pierson.
Customer Service agent.

916
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:24,375
Pleasure... Bob Nightingale.

917
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:26,250
It's you!

918
00:58:27,292 --> 00:58:29,083
I pictured you differently.

919
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:31,542
You have style, Mr. Nightingale.

920
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,083
Yes but what kind?

921
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:34,833
Shall I reserve a table?

922
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:36,083
- It'd be...
- Impossible.

923
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,375
Very cool. Why not?

924
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:39,458
We're dining out tonight.

925
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:40,625
But...

926
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:45,833
- Goodbye.
- See you soon.

927
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:50,708
Maybe we can...

928
00:59:09,542 --> 00:59:11,833
We're looking for a guy
named Lepervier.

929
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,208
Lepervier? He's over there.

930
00:59:14,792 --> 00:59:16,125
- Is that him?
- Yes.

931
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:17,333
Thanks.

932
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,125
Go ahead.
I have to make a call.

933
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:24,125
A lead?

934
00:59:24,292 --> 00:59:26,458
Found a guy named Bambuto.

935
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,542
- Oh!
- Yes, with an "O".

936
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,875
Micheline Pierson, please.

937
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,250
Lepervier?

938
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:45,750
Roland Lepervier?

939
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,542
Depends. Who are you?

940
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,792
Bob Nightingale.
Exec at ELF.

941
00:59:50,708 --> 00:59:52,792
And I run the Red Cross.

942
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,250
What do you want?

943
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:58,667
Just to talk.

944
00:59:58,875 --> 00:59:59,958
I got nothing to say.

945
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,750
Yes.

946
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,042
Micheline? It's Émile.

947
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,500
Émile?

948
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:08,708
Émile Cousin.

949
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:11,000
<i>I'm calling because</i>

950
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,292
I'll probably eat
at the hotel tonight.

951
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,875
With your friend?

952
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:18,417
No, no... First, he's not my friend.

953
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,583
He has other plans.

954
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,958
And by "other" I mean...

955
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,750
radically other.

956
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,292
May I sit down?

957
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,375
Seat's taken.

958
01:00:31,417 --> 01:00:33,375
Hopefully it'll free up soon.

959
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:38,125
I'm in luck!

960
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,458
So tell me.

961
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:45,542
Rumor has it
you know what goes down here.

962
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:48,250
Fuck rumors.
Now beat it.

963
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:49,958
Get lost!

964
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:55,083
He's sweet but very frail.

965
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:59,417
Very fragile... cowardly even.
Those people often are.

966
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:07,208
Who supplies the rebels?

967
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:10,750
You selling? Buying?
No... so fuck off.

968
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,625
He may not look it but...

969
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,833
appearances are deceiving.

970
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:20,750
Sorry, I'd love to have,
but my evening is booked.

971
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:22,458
Well, that's a pity.

972
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:27,167
If ever you wiggle free,
I won't be far.

973
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,417
So, see you later.
"Who knows", as they say.

974
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:33,375
Right. Good evening.

975
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:34,542
<i>Goodbye.</i>

976
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:46,708
Excuse me.

977
01:01:49,292 --> 01:01:51,417
Not a word.
Hard nut to crack.

978
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,583
Depends on your nutcrackers, Serge.

979
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:57,875
Let's tail them
before they vanish.

980
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:01,708
You okay?

981
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:03,833
Yes.

982
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:10,583
Let's go, yeah...

983
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:30,583
- Here.
- I'm good.

984
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:44,375
I want you to focus, Serge.

985
01:02:45,042 --> 01:02:46,042
Sure.

986
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:49,750
Look for a crate marked
"Émile Cousin".

987
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:53,167
My equipment.

988
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:55,125
What equipment?

989
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:57,375
Unlimited.

990
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Copy that.

991
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:07,750
And so we meet again.

992
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:11,333
My little finger tells me
Russia's behind this.

993
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:15,167
Yeah, we said so before.

994
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:19,333
No, we didn't say that.
I just figured it out.

995
01:03:22,542 --> 01:03:24,750
No. It's what we said.

996
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:27,833
If the rebels are communists,
it's obvious.

997
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:29,667
I don't see the connection.

998
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:32,208
You must!

999
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:36,667
Russians tried trading you
for weapons for the rebels.

1000
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:38,667
So France gets blamed,

1001
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:41,708
not the USSR.
Like the US in Afghanistan.

1002
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:43,875
Russian arms for the rebels.

1003
01:03:44,042 --> 01:03:46,958
You escaped,
so they sent Russian arms.

1004
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:50,333
I think I told you all that.

1005
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:53,958
It's good to speak
but listen too.

1006
01:03:54,792 --> 01:03:56,000
Learn to listen.

1007
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,250
Well...

1008
01:04:02,292 --> 01:04:03,708
There's the proof.

1009
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,333
It'll take them hours
to unload all that.

1010
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:09,708
Yes.

1011
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,208
Let's give them a hand.

1012
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:13,375
Yeah.

1013
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:14,917
What are you doing?

1014
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:16,125
What?

1015
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:18,458
You're the apprentice here.

1016
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:20,917
I know the answers to my questions.

1017
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:22,583
No, I'm not an appren...

1018
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,458
No big deal.

1019
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:26,625
Tailing them won't work.

1020
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:28,667
We'll likely get caught.

1021
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:33,625
What's that?

1022
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,250
Brand new.
Radio-tracking device.

1023
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:38,917
It'll show us their whereabouts.

1024
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:41,583
Why don't I have one?

1025
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:43,333
It's brand new.

1026
01:05:03,542 --> 01:05:05,250
See, they're still there.

1027
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:09,250
Thanks to this device,
we'll know where the crates are.

1028
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:12,000
Understand?

1029
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:13,875
Absolutely.

1030
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:16,375
Wonderful utensil.

1031
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:19,333
- What does this do?
- It messes it up.

1032
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,375
- Who makes it?
- Transmi-Tel.

1033
01:05:22,542 --> 01:05:23,792
Transmi-Tel.

1034
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:27,042
I'll write that down...

1035
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,875
Why don't I have one?

1036
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,083
- Transmi-Tel is located...
- Hubert?

1037
01:05:36,042 --> 01:05:38,208
They're near Meudon.

1038
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:43,125
Chaville or Meudon? Transmi-Tel...

1039
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,292
I'll ask.

1040
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,958
Hubert, where did you find these?

1041
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,750
A Black suspect, more or less Nazi.

1042
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,542
Help yourself.

1043
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,000
Hubert, look.

1044
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:59,583
They were taken
in a Muscovite studio.

1045
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:02,917
Muscovite. From Moscow.

1046
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:06,833
I knew it.

1047
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:09,125
Who speaks German for pleasure?

1048
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:11,208
See you first thing tomorrow.

1049
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:21,458
My room is much bigger.

1050
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:24,167
All right.

1051
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,333
Goodnight.

1052
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:32,417
Come on, guys, hurry up!

1053
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,500
Ladies...

1054
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:02,333
Mr. Cousin.

1055
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,167
What's this mess?

1056
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:06,708
Pleasure.

1057
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:11,750
Émile.

1058
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:13,208
Sleep well?

1059
01:07:14,042 --> 01:07:15,500
Like a baby. And you?

1060
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:17,833
Like a man.

1061
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:20,583
I'll leave you.

1062
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:31,417
Have a good day.

1063
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:39,083
So, did the crates move?

1064
01:07:39,292 --> 01:07:41,042
A lot more than crates moved.

1065
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:43,917
Damn...

1066
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,583
The mission, please.

1067
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:04,417
Serge.

1068
01:08:13,042 --> 01:08:14,125
Rehydrated.

1069
01:08:16,042 --> 01:08:17,042
So.

1070
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:20,958
Yes, they were moved.

1071
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:22,583
Give me the coordinates.

1072
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:28,750
Micheline was very charmed
by my feminine side.

1073
01:08:29,417 --> 01:08:30,583
She's hooked.

1074
01:08:30,792 --> 01:08:32,708
The coordinates, please.

1075
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,625
Latitude...

1076
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:40,042
69.

1077
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:44,833
Just kidding. 3,97.
Longitude 11.52.

1078
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:47,083
We're here. They're there.

1079
01:08:47,292 --> 01:08:49,750
In the bush. Let's get moving.

1080
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:51,917
It's full of wild animals.

1081
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:53,917
Every dangerous species,

1082
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:56,625
no matter how deadly,
has its predator.

1083
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,250
I'm their predator.

1084
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,333
And when predators meet...

1085
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,042
Room 33 again.
Bottled water, please.

1086
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:04,250
Thanks a lot.

1087
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,750
I'll meet you downstairs.

1088
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:15,083
- Have a nice day!
- Thanks. All good?

1089
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,167
Today we kill zebras!

1090
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:31,042
You good?

1091
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:35,500
Let's go, please.

1092
01:10:16,042 --> 01:10:17,333
Look, giraffes!

1093
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,500
Yes, I saw.

1094
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:19,792
It's gorgeous!

1095
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:24,500
What a clumsy critter.

1096
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:41,958
<i>Serge!</i>

1097
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:43,750
Serge!

1098
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:49,500
- You must be hot.
- I'm fine!

1099
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:51,625
Straight ahead.

1100
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:54,125
Please.

1101
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:12,458
According to this, we're not far.

1102
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:15,708
Where did they hide those crates?

1103
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:17,875
There's nothing here.

1104
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:19,375
It's deserted.

1105
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:24,458
But pretty.

1106
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:30,583
Hubert... rebels!

1107
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:35,875
Into the jeep!

1108
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:42,875
What a coward!

1109
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:44,875
I thought we were friends.

1110
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:46,292
My Sony Walkman.

1111
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:47,708
Serge!

1112
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:04,250
- One left.
- Me too.

1113
01:12:08,542 --> 01:12:10,083
- Touché.
- I got him.

1114
01:12:10,542 --> 01:12:11,542
Now run!

1115
01:13:11,917 --> 01:13:13,042
Wait!

1116
01:13:14,667 --> 01:13:15,917
What's wrong?

1117
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:17,208
You okay?

1118
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:18,958
Excellent!

1119
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:23,042
The crates...

1120
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:25,542
What about them?

1121
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,250
This way I think.

1122
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:30,333
Not at all. We have to go east.

1123
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,083
The tracker's sure. Let's go.

1124
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:33,292
No!

1125
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:35,625
They're hidden here.

1126
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:40,125
I'll check
but we should keep running.

1127
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,333
No!

1128
01:13:45,917 --> 01:13:46,958
I'll go look.

1129
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:50,917
Why do you think they're here?

1130
01:13:55,458 --> 01:13:56,875
- Feeling?
- Yes.

1131
01:13:57,042 --> 01:13:58,083
All right.

1132
01:14:12,792 --> 01:14:14,458
Hubert, are you okay?

1133
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:25,500
You're out of bullets.

1134
01:14:25,667 --> 01:14:28,667
Yes... but they don't know that.

1135
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:32,208
<i>Enough already!</i>

1136
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,458
<i>Time for you to go.</i>

1137
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,208
Tonic stress, Hubert!

1138
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:43,083
<i>Time for you to go!</i>

1139
01:14:46,042 --> 01:14:48,250
<i>I don't want to see you again!</i>

1140
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:51,875
<i>Go to the savannah for food.</i>

1141
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,083
<i>About time.</i>

1142
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,250
Written and spoken German.

1143
01:15:06,542 --> 01:15:08,500
Indispensable for all missions.

1144
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:12,000
It's not recommended
to be eaten between meals.

1145
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,208
Corning?

1146
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,875
He played dumb.
What a liar, that Lepervier.

1147
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:27,292
Lepervier?

1148
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,542
I can't make out a thing.

1149
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:34,375
Take mine.
Long focus with zoom.

1150
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:41,208
Yes, it's better.

1151
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:45,375
I've seen that guy before.

1152
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,000
It's Lepervier!

1153
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:49,833
Roland... Roland Lepervier.

1154
01:15:51,042 --> 01:15:52,708
I need to talk to you!

1155
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:02,917
It's time.

1156
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:07,417
Why don't I have this?

1157
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:16,208
I waited all night!

1158
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:38,917
It's weapons all right!

1159
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,542
Hundreds of them.

1160
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,708
Explosives.

1161
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:45,625
Serge.

1162
01:16:46,792 --> 01:16:48,000
We'll blow it all up.

1163
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:49,750
Best way to save democracy.

1164
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:05,667
Why is my equipment here?

1165
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:07,542
- Serge.
- Mission aborted.

1166
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:08,958
What's going on?

1167
01:17:11,708 --> 01:17:13,292
You do the sides.

1168
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:26,333
Blow up a Renault Gordini?

1169
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:27,833
What's this?

1170
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:29,708
Unlimited material.

1171
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:34,875
Straight-four engine.

1172
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:38,292
1.565 cubic centimeters.

1173
01:17:39,167 --> 01:17:40,792
Brazenly French.

1174
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,708
Pretty mistress, right?

1175
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:48,583
A transmitter.

1176
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:50,583
My equipment.

1177
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:54,000
We'll build a time bomb.

1178
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:55,458
How?

1179
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:57,458
Relax, I'm well equipped.

1180
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:15,000
A portable computer.

1181
01:18:18,292 --> 01:18:19,708
Don't have one, do you?

1182
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
No.

1183
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:21,708
So if I invert...

1184
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:27,292
Hands off my car.

1185
01:19:29,208 --> 01:19:32,000
I program the transmitter as receiver

1186
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:34,542
and the tracker as emitter...

1187
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:42,500
They put it in Cobol.

1188
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:46,750
Hands off, I said.

1189
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:55,458
We're going to play
Cobol and Indians!

1190
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:57,083
What?

1191
01:19:57,833 --> 01:19:59,125
You can't understand.

1192
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:03,250
That should fit like Dad in Morn.

1193
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,500
There!

1194
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,667
What did I tell you? Bravo!

1195
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:24,417
Why did it block?

1196
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:25,958
You better hurry!

1197
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:36,292
They're coming, Hubert!

1198
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:37,875
They're coming!

1199
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:39,958
It's not working!

1200
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,583
Make it fast.

1201
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:48,917
Hubert!

1202
01:20:49,125 --> 01:20:50,125
It's stuck.

1203
01:20:52,917 --> 01:20:54,125
It's not working.

1204
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,875
<i>If it doesn't work,</i>

1205
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:02,167
<i>a surefire solution.
Unplug and plug it back in.</i>

1206
01:21:11,417 --> 01:21:12,458
Thanks, Jean-Loup.

1207
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:13,667
Come on.

1208
01:21:29,917 --> 01:21:30,917
Hubert.

1209
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:36,917
And we're off.

1210
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:51,708
What's this crap?

1211
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Oh no.

1212
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:06,292
Not bad!

1213
01:22:06,417 --> 01:22:07,542
Not bad.

1214
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:12,792
Long live democracy!

1215
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:28,208
A little polish.

1216
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:32,500
Finally, Hubert.
Mission accomplished.

1217
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:37,625
Mission accomplished once I give
my report to President Bamba.

1218
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:40,250
Of course.

1219
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:43,833
The weapons were destroyed,
the putsch avoided.

1220
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:45,708
We did good work.

1221
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:48,750
Yes, it's true.
You were a good assistant.

1222
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:52,625
How do we get back to the capital?

1223
01:22:53,542 --> 01:22:56,375
Let's hurry.
I'm seeing Micheline tonight.

1224
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,500
Like everyone.

1225
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,667
Step back.
Nasty critters in that water.

1226
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:06,083
You'll excite them with your rocks.

1227
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:11,667
We left Lepervier's camp,

1228
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:13,708
took this route.
So we're here.

1229
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:17,292
No, that's Angola.

1230
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:19,917
No, we're here.

1231
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:23,167
That's Congo.

1232
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:31,500
Once again, don't go near the water!

1233
01:23:31,667 --> 01:23:33,542
Once again, blah-blah-blah!

1234
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:37,667
Shower! Shave! Listen!
Don't dress like a cutie.

1235
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:40,625
Fuck off!

1236
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:49,667
I used to admire you.

1237
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:52,125
I respected you.

1238
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:57,125
But I'm sick of you telling me where
to go, what to do and with whom.

1239
01:23:57,292 --> 01:24:00,042
I'm not your apprentice,
not your assistant,

1240
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:02,042
not your slave, not your friend.

1241
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:05,208
I may have loved that before,
but now, no way!

1242
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,958
I don't see you
as a legend anymore.

1243
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:12,083
I see a small, outdated man,
with a small car full of prejudices,

1244
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,375
and a big, brainless head.

1245
01:24:14,542 --> 01:24:15,750
That's what I see.

1246
01:24:16,833 --> 01:24:18,583
I'm fed up! I'm fed up

1247
01:24:18,792 --> 01:24:20,833
with your platitudes, your reasoning,

1248
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,417
your "I think I said all that."

1249
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:26,625
You said nothing interesting.
I even wonder

1250
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:28,458
if you ever use your head!

1251
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:30,542
All I've heard until now is

1252
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:33,583
a slew of repulsive racist
and homophobic crap

1253
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:35,458
which truly obsesses you!

1254
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,417
And that idiotic laugh!

1255
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:41,417
And your... so tacky!

1256
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:45,208
"I'm their predator"...
no, you're not!

1257
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:48,708
You're no one's predator,
especially not Micheline's!

1258
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:51,458
Don't sulk. I know. Who doesn't?

1259
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:53,458
I may not be OSS 117,

1260
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:56,375
I may not be "The Legend",
agent number one,

1261
01:24:56,583 --> 01:24:59,917
but I still have a future.
I have time and I...

1262
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:06,792
There you go.

1263
01:25:07,042 --> 01:25:08,375
What did I tell you?

1264
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:10,708
So...

1265
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:14,625
No surprise
we need 4-digit IDs now.

1266
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:17,208
I'll do that.

1267
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:24,458
I better fill the tank.

1268
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:42,208
Well, well...

1269
01:25:42,333 --> 01:25:43,333
you, here.

1270
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:45,292
The world is topsy-turvy.

1271
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:02,250
You escaped once.

1272
01:26:03,333 --> 01:26:05,875
That was your big snake in my bed.

1273
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:07,833
One escape too many!

1274
01:26:08,042 --> 01:26:09,042
No, two.

1275
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:12,625
The big snake and in the mountains.
So twice.

1276
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:16,167
But you won't escape this time!

1277
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:25,500
Stop!

1278
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:29,292
This enemy of the people must die.

1279
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:32,750
It's my people.
I'm big enough to decide who dies.

1280
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:36,583
Without Soviet arms,
it won't be your revolution.

1281
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:38,625
I'll inform my superiors.

1282
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:40,958
Your superior here is me.
Get out.

1283
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:44,750
Three times.

1284
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:52,792
To whom do I owe the honor?
The FCPA?

1285
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,917
PSMDLA?

1286
01:26:55,625 --> 01:26:56,875
SPMA?

1287
01:26:57,625 --> 01:26:59,333
FNSEA?

1288
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:00,875
All of the above.

1289
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:02,458
We all joined forces.

1290
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:04,500
The revolution is underway.

1291
01:27:04,917 --> 01:27:06,292
You forget one small thing.

1292
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:09,125
President Bamba will win
with 84% of the vote.

1293
01:27:10,208 --> 01:27:11,667
Rigged elections!

1294
01:27:12,083 --> 01:27:14,417
Zéphyrine? You!

1295
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:17,083
Bamba is an ignominious dictator!

1296
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:18,625
A blood-thirsty tyrant!

1297
01:27:18,792 --> 01:27:20,458
Ma'am, he's your husband!

1298
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:21,917
My husband?

1299
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:24,292
A forced marriage!

1300
01:27:24,917 --> 01:27:26,667
To buy off the Bakwélé.

1301
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:29,833
You're Kwélé and Bakwélé?

1302
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:32,875
"Bakwélé" is the plural.

1303
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:35,500
The plural...

1304
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:37,708
14 ethnic groups
comprise this country.

1305
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:40,833
Each with its own language,
traditions and land.

1306
01:27:41,042 --> 01:27:44,125
Whose idea was it
to put 14 groups in one country?

1307
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:45,875
Who started this mess?

1308
01:27:46,083 --> 01:27:47,875
You... the French!

1309
01:27:48,458 --> 01:27:50,000
Must be a good reason.

1310
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:51,542
A good reason?

1311
01:27:53,292 --> 01:27:55,708
This is exactly why I jailed you.

1312
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:58,875
To see the reality
of our French-backed regime.

1313
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:00,500
Come with me.

1314
01:28:06,042 --> 01:28:07,417
Look at everyone.

1315
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:10,792
They rebel against Bamba
who took everything from them.

1316
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:12,333
And what does France do?

1317
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,708
It protects you.

1318
01:28:14,042 --> 01:28:15,792
France protects African countries.

1319
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:19,542
It cherishes them...
like a friend, a kid brother.

1320
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:23,333
Depriving France of Africa
is to amputate its leg.

1321
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:25,875
Depriving France of Africa is...

1322
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:27,833
to kill its joy.

1323
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:29,583
To stop it from dancing.

1324
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:32,917
Next comes
"I have black friends"?

1325
01:28:33,542 --> 01:28:34,750
No.

1326
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:36,667
Not one.

1327
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,750
But I'd like to.
I'd love to.

1328
01:28:41,417 --> 01:28:43,083
I just never had the chance.

1329
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:45,875
Because I'm not at all...

1330
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:48,667
I have a friend who stutters.

1331
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:50,750
Who used to stutter.

1332
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:54,125
Because stuttering can be cured,
whereas bl...

1333
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:56,917
Blind. My blind buddy...

1334
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:59,875
never got cured either.

1335
01:29:00,042 --> 01:29:02,875
Hard to speak
with the ruckus of tam-tams.

1336
01:29:03,625 --> 01:29:05,542
But what a lovely ruckus!

1337
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:16,292
Know what the Soviets get
for helping us?

1338
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,458
A lease on our oil fields.

1339
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:21,500
And they pay us much more
than France.

1340
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,042
You don't want gas, electricity?

1341
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:26,667
We have none of that.

1342
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,458
That's why I'm taking control.

1343
01:29:31,042 --> 01:29:33,333
You have nothing, so you revolt

1344
01:29:33,542 --> 01:29:35,125
to have even more nothing.

1345
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:38,625
Your logic escapes me.

1346
01:29:39,542 --> 01:29:42,417
Your little story is charming, but...

1347
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:46,042
there's a snag...
and a serious snag at that.

1348
01:29:46,292 --> 01:29:47,708
You're a woman.

1349
01:29:48,208 --> 01:29:49,667
A woman president...

1350
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:54,958
Is it normal to be jailed
for the slightest criticism?

1351
01:29:55,125 --> 01:29:56,333
Tortured?

1352
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:02,125
You... you have your car.

1353
01:30:02,333 --> 01:30:04,375
It takes you wherever you want.

1354
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:05,417
Yes?

1355
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:06,583
You're free.

1356
01:30:07,458 --> 01:30:11,250
Africans are so shackled
they travel only in their heads.

1357
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:14,500
Is it normal
we can't have our own cars?

1358
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:18,750
No, on that I agree.

1359
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:21,083
Yeah.

1360
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,208
So think it over.

1361
01:30:47,792 --> 01:30:48,833
Come here.

1362
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:54,708
I've been watching you for a while.

1363
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:55,875
You're talented.

1364
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:57,792
Good legwork.

1365
01:30:59,042 --> 01:31:00,292
Beware of him.

1366
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:01,917
No.

1367
01:31:02,042 --> 01:31:04,083
This man can become our ally.

1368
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,167
You know the Black Guard?

1369
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:11,750
Marius Trésor?

1370
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:14,375
No?

1371
01:31:14,792 --> 01:31:16,583
Well, he's Black, like you.

1372
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:18,417
Maybe even more so.

1373
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:22,250
And yet now,
he plays with a real soccer ball.

1374
01:31:22,417 --> 01:31:24,750
On a real field, in a real country.

1375
01:31:24,917 --> 01:31:26,333
French National Team.

1376
01:31:27,292 --> 01:31:30,125
He's even team captain,
can you believe it?

1377
01:31:31,917 --> 01:31:33,458
So there's always hope.

1378
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:36,125
But to make it,
you need to work a lot.

1379
01:31:36,542 --> 01:31:38,208
It's not a one-way street.

1380
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:39,500
France...

1381
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:41,333
must be deserved.

1382
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:44,542
Go on, practice your juggling.

1383
01:31:55,292 --> 01:31:56,875
What were you discussing?

1384
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:58,542
His future.

1385
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:00,833
You believe in our future?

1386
01:32:01,042 --> 01:32:02,167
There's potential.

1387
01:32:02,375 --> 01:32:04,167
You need good teammates.

1388
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:07,083
So you know Bamba's not up to it.

1389
01:32:07,292 --> 01:32:09,083
For sure, he's way too old.

1390
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:12,875
So we agree.

1391
01:32:13,792 --> 01:32:17,333
You know, kiddo,
fighting prejudice is my combat.

1392
01:32:18,542 --> 01:32:19,625
Well...

1393
01:32:20,375 --> 01:32:21,708
I have a long drive.

1394
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:26,042
And it's elephant-mating season.
It'll be hectic.

1395
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:29,833
You forget you're my prisoner.

1396
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:35,792
Women always like it a little rough.

1397
01:32:35,958 --> 01:32:37,833
Some things never change.

1398
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:41,208
Some things never existed.

1399
01:32:41,708 --> 01:32:42,875
I'm a free woman.

1400
01:32:43,042 --> 01:32:45,375
I kiss you because I decided to.

1401
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:48,292
We're in Africa.
Your home, your call.

1402
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:11,208
Your ethnic group again?

1403
01:33:12,083 --> 01:33:13,208
Kwélé.

1404
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:15,708
Oh yes.

1405
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:17,792
Bakwélé in the plural.

1406
01:33:18,417 --> 01:33:19,458
And you?

1407
01:33:19,958 --> 01:33:21,167
I'm Berry.

1408
01:33:47,083 --> 01:33:48,417
You all right, Émile?

1409
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:49,583
Yes.

1410
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:04,208
Émile?

1411
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:22,750
Émile, are you okay?

1412
01:34:23,083 --> 01:34:24,375
I'm ready.

1413
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:25,833
<i>Vive la revolution.</i>

1414
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:41,417
You Africans are great
at making things happy and colorful.

1415
01:34:41,583 --> 01:34:42,958
Even Marxism.

1416
01:34:44,917 --> 01:34:46,667
What they say is true.

1417
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:49,208
Rhythm pulses through your veins.

1418
01:34:49,375 --> 01:34:51,833
You can really get your groove on!

1419
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:55,917
How lively, taut.
How wild and bestial.

1420
01:34:57,292 --> 01:34:59,167
You're one with nature.

1421
01:35:03,333 --> 01:35:06,250
This color is so beautiful.
Look at this.

1422
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:10,000
Why did we bother you with clothing?

1423
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:12,083
Why did we bother you at all?

1424
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:15,333
You were happy
dancing naked in the wild.

1425
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:19,458
Hungry? You ate a giraffe.
Or a neighbor.

1426
01:35:20,917 --> 01:35:23,833
You made love whenever.
Even in front of others.

1427
01:35:24,375 --> 01:35:26,375
Far cry from our strict rules:

1428
01:35:26,542 --> 01:35:29,167
set the table, eat hot, get married.

1429
01:35:29,625 --> 01:35:31,583
Why did we come bother you?

1430
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:35,292
My God.

1431
01:35:36,917 --> 01:35:39,125
I see why you feel disrespected.

1432
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:45,042
Thanks to you,
I've had a reality check.

1433
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:50,250
Did France really
get everything right in Africa?

1434
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:56,417
What did I say? What did I do?

1435
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:58,208
I planted the flag!

1436
01:35:58,417 --> 01:36:00,125
Know what you are? An ass!

1437
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:01,333
Me?

1438
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:05,042
We need arms to eliminate your kind.

1439
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:07,208
Too bad.
I just blew them up.

1440
01:36:07,375 --> 01:36:09,292
- I'll ask Lepervier.
- Blown up too.

1441
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:17,583
All you understand
is domination and submission.

1442
01:36:18,125 --> 01:36:20,542
Tomorrow I'll deliver you to Kazimir.

1443
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:22,583
Kazimir?

1444
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:23,958
Our Soviet contact.

1445
01:36:24,917 --> 01:36:26,333
Oh, Sugar Tongs.

1446
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:28,250
His name's Kazimir?

1447
01:36:28,417 --> 01:36:31,125
Have a nice evening. It's your last.

1448
01:36:54,917 --> 01:36:56,250
Oh hello.

1449
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:32,042
Africa's future is utterly charming.

1450
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,667
Savages!

1451
01:37:59,167 --> 01:38:01,083
Got a problem with my car?

1452
01:38:07,792 --> 01:38:08,792
No!

1453
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:11,083
No way!

1454
01:38:32,667 --> 01:38:34,208
<i>Proshchay,</i> Sugar Tongs!

1455
01:38:34,417 --> 01:38:35,750
Four times now!

1456
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:05,833
<i>When the lollypop</i>

1457
01:39:06,542 --> 01:39:09,708
<i>Flavored with anise</i>

1458
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,792
<i>Slides down Annie's throat</i>

1459
01:39:15,375 --> 01:39:18,542
<i>She is in paradise</i>

1460
01:39:25,458 --> 01:39:26,500
Yes, Josy?

1461
01:39:26,667 --> 01:39:28,875
Hubert on line 3. Top priority.

1462
01:39:29,042 --> 01:39:30,042
Thank you.

1463
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:32,375
Hubert! So how is Africa?

1464
01:39:32,583 --> 01:39:33,667
Better, I think.

1465
01:39:33,875 --> 01:39:34,875
<i>Good.</i>

1466
01:39:34,958 --> 01:39:36,292
The rebels joined forces.

1467
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,917
They needed the weapons,
now neutralized.

1468
01:39:39,083 --> 01:39:40,542
<i>- Bravo.</i>
- Thanks.

1469
01:39:41,333 --> 01:39:43,333
And the sun here is glorious.

1470
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,917
I forgot. There's bad news too.
Concerning 1001.

1471
01:39:47,542 --> 01:39:49,083
Actually, he's dead.

1472
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:50,958
<i>No! How did it happen?</i>

1473
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:53,458
A lapse of attention.

1474
01:39:54,542 --> 01:39:56,542
You know, on missions like this,

1475
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:58,458
mistakes cost you your life.

1476
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:00,833
<i>My God, what a tragedy.</i>

1477
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,875
I was very fond of him.

1478
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:05,500
He admired you so.

1479
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:09,167
<i>He was so talented, so charming.</i>

1480
01:40:10,458 --> 01:40:13,875
Maybe, but 30 years ago,
I was fighting Egyptian extremists.

1481
01:40:14,042 --> 01:40:15,708
Not skimming stones.

1482
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:17,083
<i>Tell me.</i>

1483
01:40:17,417 --> 01:40:18,750
<i>Did he suffer?</i>

1484
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:20,875
<i>Hubert?</i>

1485
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:27,208
I meant to tell you.

1486
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:29,833
I slept with another woman.

1487
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:33,583
Bravo, Émile. I'm thrilled for you.

1488
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:39,250
Who's he?

1489
01:40:39,375 --> 01:40:40,917
<i>I'll inform his parents.</i>

1490
01:40:41,083 --> 01:40:41,917
Indeed.

1491
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:43,458
<i>What a loss.</i>

1492
01:40:43,625 --> 01:40:44,958
I have to go.

1493
01:40:45,167 --> 01:40:48,208
We can discuss Serge
but I have my mission.

1494
01:40:48,833 --> 01:40:49,833
I'll call you back.

1495
01:40:52,292 --> 01:40:54,833
- Tell the President I'm here.
- Yes, sir.

1496
01:41:06,917 --> 01:41:09,125
Your cause is just.
I understand now.

1497
01:41:09,667 --> 01:41:10,667
Really?

1498
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:13,000
Yes, I've thought it over.

1499
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:14,292
A great deal.

1500
01:41:14,875 --> 01:41:16,750
Your cause is just, noble, generous.

1501
01:41:17,417 --> 01:41:18,417
I'll defend it.

1502
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:23,958
And I have a plan.

1503
01:41:24,667 --> 01:41:26,125
I'll speak with Bamba.

1504
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:27,667
He won't listen.

1505
01:41:27,875 --> 01:41:28,875
Yes!

1506
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,375
Corning from me,
it'll go down better.

1507
01:41:32,042 --> 01:41:33,292
Trust me.

1508
01:41:53,958 --> 01:41:54,958
Mr. Cousin.

1509
01:41:56,125 --> 01:41:57,333
Mr. President.

1510
01:41:58,458 --> 01:41:59,833
I see you're having fun.

1511
01:42:00,875 --> 01:42:03,042
A little stretch after a long ride.

1512
01:42:03,625 --> 01:42:05,333
You deserve it.

1513
01:42:06,083 --> 01:42:07,500
I heard about your exploits.

1514
01:42:08,333 --> 01:42:09,958
Hats off to you!

1515
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:13,125
I was told you wanted to speak.

1516
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:17,458
Proof the rebels joined forces
and allied with the USSR.

1517
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:19,833
Thank you, my friend.

1518
01:42:25,542 --> 01:42:26,917
Look at this.

1519
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:30,583
Their offer is far better
than France's.

1520
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,042
You couldn't betray France.

1521
01:42:34,458 --> 01:42:36,333
I'm just keeping abreast.

1522
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:39,417
You know,
Africans are like big children.

1523
01:42:39,625 --> 01:42:40,875
Distasteful cliché.

1524
01:42:41,583 --> 01:42:44,042
What if it's an African who says it?

1525
01:42:45,042 --> 01:42:46,167
That's true.

1526
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:49,917
What do children do
when feeling abandoned and unloved?

1527
01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:53,208
- Drink?
- Come now.

1528
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:55,250
Tell me. I'm no child expert.

1529
01:42:55,458 --> 01:42:58,667
They act silly.
So we show more interest in them.

1530
01:42:58,875 --> 01:43:00,292
So we show our love.

1531
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:02,792
Tell your president

1532
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,042
I need him to take me on his lap

1533
01:43:05,208 --> 01:43:07,208
and spoon-feed me applesauce.

1534
01:43:08,917 --> 01:43:10,042
Copy that.

1535
01:43:14,917 --> 01:43:16,292
Mr. President,

1536
01:43:17,333 --> 01:43:19,500
may I share a dream with you?

1537
01:43:23,542 --> 01:43:26,292
Isn't it time
for a more open republic?

1538
01:43:27,542 --> 01:43:28,542
Excuse me?

1539
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:30,333
Open to other ideas?

1540
01:43:30,917 --> 01:43:32,125
No, I think not.

1541
01:43:36,667 --> 01:43:39,583
Don't you think
wealth should be distributed?

1542
01:43:40,125 --> 01:43:41,125
No.

1543
01:43:44,708 --> 01:43:46,542
I understand, but think.

1544
01:43:47,083 --> 01:43:48,583
Everyone gets a fair shake.

1545
01:43:48,792 --> 01:43:50,500
You and the people.

1546
01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:52,708
You share, they share...

1547
01:43:52,875 --> 01:43:54,083
As equals.

1548
01:43:55,083 --> 01:43:56,708
They have nothing, but...

1549
01:43:56,875 --> 01:43:59,375
millions of nothings
add up to something.

1550
01:44:00,167 --> 01:44:04,542
And from this something,
there will be something for you.

1551
01:44:05,417 --> 01:44:06,958
You have a lot.

1552
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:11,042
"A lot" divided by a lot
leaves something.

1553
01:44:11,208 --> 01:44:13,875
If you add those two somethings...

1554
01:44:14,042 --> 01:44:15,917
you get more than nothing.

1555
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:19,375
More than nothing isn't much,

1556
01:44:19,792 --> 01:44:21,667
but it's so much more fair.

1557
01:44:22,583 --> 01:44:23,583
It's...

1558
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:26,000
the right side of history.

1559
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:27,875
Mr. President.

1560
01:44:30,667 --> 01:44:31,667
No.

1561
01:44:33,458 --> 01:44:34,458
Really?

1562
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:36,917
People here don't need much
to be happy.

1563
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:39,708
We're waiting for you.

1564
01:44:40,167 --> 01:44:41,417
He doesn't want to.

1565
01:44:42,292 --> 01:44:44,333
- Doesn't want to what?
- Nothing.

1566
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:45,500
What?

1567
01:44:45,875 --> 01:44:47,083
You're a politician now?

1568
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:49,167
I don't know what he meant.

1569
01:44:49,375 --> 01:44:50,917
Go be pretty and shut up.

1570
01:44:51,083 --> 01:44:52,708
It's what you do best.

1571
01:44:52,875 --> 01:44:55,000
Big fat head like a rhino!

1572
01:44:55,167 --> 01:44:56,458
Mind your tone!

1573
01:44:56,875 --> 01:44:58,000
Please, Mr. Cousin.

1574
01:44:58,208 --> 01:44:59,625
You know who she is?

1575
01:45:00,167 --> 01:45:03,333
This little woman
reunited all the rebel forces!

1576
01:45:04,833 --> 01:45:05,667
Keep quiet.

1577
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:07,458
There are no more weapons.

1578
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:10,083
Once a Kwélé, always a Kwélé.

1579
01:45:10,458 --> 01:45:12,208
You'll know the fate of traitors.

1580
01:45:12,875 --> 01:45:14,833
Prison. Defeat.

1581
01:45:15,042 --> 01:45:16,208
Blood!

1582
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:18,083
Shut your mouth!

1583
01:45:18,292 --> 01:45:19,792
- Whore!
- Bastard!

1584
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Stupid fool!

1585
01:45:21,167 --> 01:45:23,250
Please, people will hear.

1586
01:45:23,833 --> 01:45:24,833
Léon!

1587
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:29,500
Imprison her!

1588
01:45:30,458 --> 01:45:32,333
The only order you'll give me

1589
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:34,250
is to finish you off!

1590
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
How dare you?

1591
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:37,458
Obey!

1592
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,792
The future of Africa is beautiful!

1593
01:45:41,958 --> 01:45:43,333
Léon, a felon.
Knew it.

1594
01:45:43,542 --> 01:45:44,542
<i>Attack!</i>

1595
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,333
<i>Eat him!</i>

1596
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:49,917
Eat him!

1597
01:45:51,417 --> 01:45:52,417
Catch!

1598
01:45:56,667 --> 01:45:58,667
German to obey, French to seduce.

1599
01:46:01,125 --> 01:46:03,292
Drop it, Bamba. Don't even try.

1600
01:46:10,208 --> 01:46:11,208
Traitor.

1601
01:46:16,833 --> 01:46:18,167
What did you do?

1602
01:46:18,375 --> 01:46:19,417
Bitch!

1603
01:46:22,083 --> 01:46:23,083
Zéphyrine!

1604
01:46:23,833 --> 01:46:25,083
Filthy Kwélé!

1605
01:46:25,875 --> 01:46:27,208
Zéphyrine!

1606
01:46:30,625 --> 01:46:31,625
Enough!

1607
01:46:34,042 --> 01:46:35,208
Let me kill that pig.

1608
01:46:35,417 --> 01:46:37,083
You killed three of him already.

1609
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:39,083
That pig is a friend of France.

1610
01:46:39,250 --> 01:46:42,000
Accept friends' faults
or end up friendless.

1611
01:46:42,208 --> 01:46:44,333
So please, spare the pig.

1612
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:46,625
Please stop calling me "the pig".

1613
01:46:47,042 --> 01:46:50,625
Sorry, sir, I'm seeing to your wife.
It's under control.

1614
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:53,417
Guards!

1615
01:46:53,583 --> 01:46:54,708
Mission accomplished.

1616
01:46:55,667 --> 01:46:57,042
You betrayed me.

1617
01:46:57,250 --> 01:46:59,667
You go too far.
This rebellion stuff...

1618
01:47:01,542 --> 01:47:04,458
Women need hobbies.
There are hobbies and hobbies.

1619
01:47:05,917 --> 01:47:07,458
Thank you. Good work.

1620
01:47:07,625 --> 01:47:08,875
Haul her away!

1621
01:47:09,292 --> 01:47:10,750
He'll torture me.

1622
01:47:10,958 --> 01:47:12,625
Torture... big words already.

1623
01:47:12,792 --> 01:47:15,042
Why do women communicate
via hysteria?

1624
01:47:15,208 --> 01:47:16,833
He wouldn't torture his wife.

1625
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,167
You don't know him.

1626
01:47:18,375 --> 01:47:21,000
Nor do you.
He may not be the real Bamba.

1627
01:47:21,208 --> 01:47:22,792
Maybe he's a better husband.

1628
01:47:24,875 --> 01:47:25,875
There you go.

1629
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:32,583
My God...

1630
01:47:32,792 --> 01:47:34,667
What a day...

1631
01:47:36,292 --> 01:47:37,667
Promise to treat her well.

1632
01:47:38,875 --> 01:47:40,208
She will be.

1633
01:47:41,542 --> 01:47:42,667
I have your word?

1634
01:47:42,875 --> 01:47:44,500
You have my word.

1635
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,917
You won't let France down?

1636
01:47:47,292 --> 01:47:50,042
Never would I let France down.

1637
01:47:50,375 --> 01:47:51,208
Good.

1638
01:47:51,375 --> 01:47:54,417
I leave with at peace,
my duty fulfilled.

1639
01:48:01,083 --> 01:48:02,375
Some personality!

1640
01:48:05,458 --> 01:48:07,292
Now that's a real woman!

1641
01:48:09,458 --> 01:48:11,042
"He'll torture me!"

1642
01:48:29,083 --> 01:48:30,208
<i>Hubert!</i>

1643
01:48:31,458 --> 01:48:32,583
De La Bath?

1644
01:48:33,167 --> 01:48:34,167
Hubert?

1645
01:48:38,208 --> 01:48:39,375
Gestapo!

1646
01:48:43,083 --> 01:48:44,667
- Hello, Hubert.
- Ledentu...

1647
01:48:46,167 --> 01:48:47,417
Souvenir of Africa.

1648
01:48:48,542 --> 01:48:49,917
Thank you!

1649
01:48:51,042 --> 01:48:52,708
It's so cute.

1650
01:48:52,875 --> 01:48:54,083
It's more than that.

1651
01:48:54,292 --> 01:48:56,083
It does you lots of good.

1652
01:48:56,708 --> 01:48:58,333
For dry, cracked skin.

1653
01:48:58,542 --> 01:48:59,875
Is the boss in?

1654
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:01,500
Yes.

1655
01:49:03,417 --> 01:49:05,792
- Hello, Armand.
- Hello, Hubert.

1656
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:08,583
Your mission was a total success.

1657
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,958
President Sangawe Bamba is happy.

1658
01:49:12,125 --> 01:49:15,250
And a happy Africa
means a prosperous France.

1659
01:49:15,792 --> 01:49:16,792
Cool.

1660
01:49:17,042 --> 01:49:19,958
Democracy is tough work
with all these coups.

1661
01:49:20,167 --> 01:49:21,833
It's not over yet.

1662
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:25,000
The opposition leader
escaped last night.

1663
01:49:25,167 --> 01:49:26,167
No!

1664
01:49:27,583 --> 01:49:28,708
What a woman.

1665
01:49:28,917 --> 01:49:30,792
The Russians smuggled her out.

1666
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:33,375
This Communist nightmare

1667
01:49:33,583 --> 01:49:35,083
will never end.

1668
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:37,542
Yeah and worse, they damage cars.

1669
01:49:38,125 --> 01:49:39,500
You go to the USSR tomorrow.

1670
01:49:39,667 --> 01:49:40,792
No problem.

1671
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:44,500
We can't rid France of them,
so I'll attack at the root.

1672
01:49:44,667 --> 01:49:45,792
I'm counting on you.

1673
01:49:46,208 --> 01:49:48,250
Bring me back that little rebel.

1674
01:49:49,042 --> 01:49:50,375
And save the Free World.

1675
01:49:50,583 --> 01:49:51,833
Consider it done.

1676
01:49:52,042 --> 01:49:53,167
Oh, I forgot.

1677
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:56,917
President Bamba sent this
for President Giscard d'Estaing.

1678
01:50:00,792 --> 01:50:01,792
No.

1679
01:50:01,833 --> 01:50:04,125
It's kind of him, but a bad idea.

1680
01:50:06,083 --> 01:50:07,333
I'll sequestrate them.

1681
01:50:08,042 --> 01:50:09,042
Go on, Hubert.

1682
01:50:09,208 --> 01:50:11,083
Finish this mission.

1683
