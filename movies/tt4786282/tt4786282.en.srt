You know why I'm here? She called me.

336
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,593
So, Child Services takes
orders from nutjobs now?

337
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,349
I stopped by, in person,
to make sure she was lucid.

338
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,993
And she was.

That's not how this works.

Sophie's his birth mother.

His legal guardian.

343
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,309
To get Martin from her custody
requires you to file charges against her.

344
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,518
Take her to court.

345
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,320
Now, that's a long, painful process.

346
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,113
And that's only the first half.

347
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,516
To keep Martin from being
placed in foster care

348
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,793
requires you to prove yourself
and your home as an appropriate surrogate.

349

That's two major choices for you to make.
