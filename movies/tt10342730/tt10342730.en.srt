3
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,221
Hey! My purse!
He's got my purse!

4
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,955
- Hey, stop him!
- Come on.

5
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,012
Somebody stop him!
He's got my purse!

6
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,296
Police! Freeze!

7
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:13,450
Hey! Stop! Out of my way!

8
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:15,807
Get out of my way!
Out of my way! Police!

9
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,880
Move!

10
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,506
You did not
just go down there...

11
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,599
What the fuck?

12
00:02:39,022 --> 00:02:40,456
Fuck sakes.

13
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:15,274
Get your fucking hands
in the air!

14
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,748
I ain't gonna
say it again, motherfucker!

15
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,523
Fuck.

16
00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:26,946
<i>Hello,
Detective Bozwick.</i>

17
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:28,933
- <i>I want to play a game.</i>
- No!

18
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:31,951
<i>The 3 train is arriving
in two minutes.</i>

19
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:33,468
<i>It is up to you to decide</i>

20
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,899
<i>if this will be
your final stop.</i>

21
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:39,126
<i>You have taken
the witness stand many times,</i>

22
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:42,127
<i>and railroaded innocent people
with your lies,</i>

23
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,604
<i>putting them away in jail.</i>

24
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:47,713
<i>Today, it is you
who will be railroaded.</i>

25
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,944
<i>You have one chance to live.</i>

26
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:52,950
<i>Tear from your mouth the tongue
that has so often been used</i>

27
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,861
<i>to lie and to deceive.</i>

28
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,622
<i>Take a leap of faith,
and you will live.</i>

29
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,529
<i>Only your weight will rip away</i>

30
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:01,752
<i>your lying tongue and save you.</i>

31
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:04,244
<i>Live or die, make your choice.</i>

32
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,592
<i>What you talking about?
That movie won awards.</i>

33
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:56,231
<i>You know, Tom Hanks
is a straight pimp, man,</i>

34
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,984
<i>but I don't know if you could
make that movie today.</i>

35
00:06:58,066 --> 00:06:59,317
What the fuck
you going on about?

36
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:01,695
- Special needs abuse.
- Special needs?

37
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:03,438
- What, you woke now?
- Not woke,

38
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,373
but you can't say "handicapped,"
you can't say "retarded."

39
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,728
You got to say "special needs,"
I'm trying to be respectful.

40
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:11,500
Forrest Gump
was special needs, man.

41
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:13,111
What was the name of the girl?

42
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:14,559
- Jenny.
- Jenny.

43
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,005
He did everything for Jenny.

44
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,442
This motherfucker did some shit.

45
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:21,357
He jogged across
the whole country.

46
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:23,628
He beat China in ping-pong.

47
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:25,496
You know how fucking hard
that shit is?

48
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:27,017
He was a war hero.

49
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:29,695
Who the fuck is nicer
than Forrest Gump?

50
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:31,300
His best friend

51
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:35,579
was a nigga and a white boy
with no legs.

52
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:38,316
He made a billion dollars
selling shrimp.

53
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:40,076
And she still wouldn't fuck him.

54
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:41,938
Hey, eventually,
they got together.

55
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:45,494
Yeah, after she got AIDS.

56
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:48,650
As soon as she got AIDS,
she's like, "Hey, Forrest..."

57
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:51,144
Get the fuck out of here, man.

58
00:07:51,223 --> 00:07:53,429
Giving that guy AIDS?

59
00:07:53,508 --> 00:07:54,979
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

60
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,269
- That shit's abusive.
- But he ain't get it.

61
00:07:56,338 --> 00:08:00,109
I ain't see no sequel.
Where's <i>Gump 2?</i>

62
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:01,749
Yo, Rico just got off
the elevator.

63
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,184
Oh, shit.

64
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:06,017
Let's do this.

65
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,349
Get down! Get down right now!

66
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,035
Get down right now!
You know what this is!

67
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:20,926
You know what this is!

68
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:23,028
That's right! Put it all!
Come on! Down!

69
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,369
Fill up this bag! Put it
in the motherfucking bag!

70
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,426
Come on.

71
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:27,439
- You know what to do!
- Chill!

72
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:29,654
Get back!

73
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:31,986
I want that coke!
I want that money!

74
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:34,774
I want everything!

75
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:39,645
Shit.

76
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,151
Ninety seconds,
we gotta go!

77
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:26,354
Freeze! Police!

78
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:27,761
Hands up! Get your hands up!

79
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:30,491
Get out of the car.
Get the fuck out of...

80
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:33,412
Zeke? Is that you?

81
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:35,511
Zeke?

82
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:37,342
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

83
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:38,665
You do an undercover op...

84
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:40,697
You don't clear it,
there's no coordination.

85
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:41,970
We are Homicide,

86
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:44,344
but you're robbing drug dealers
in a fucking hotel.

87
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:46,596
I had a dozen 911 calls come in.

88
00:09:46,738 --> 00:09:47,685
What if someone got killed?

89
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:50,381
That crew killed four people
last week, and we got them.

90
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,250
And we could have got more of
them if my cover wasn't blown.

91
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,303
Fuck your cover, Zeke!

92
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:59,913
You were off on your own,
as usual, no backup, nothing.

93
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:02,836
No backup, 'cause there's
nobody on the force

94
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:05,318
I can fucking trust!

95
00:10:05,614 --> 00:10:08,521
From now on, you're going
to learn to be a team player.

96
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:10,690
You're getting a partner.
Jeannie, send Schenk in.

97
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:13,510
Do I look like
a fucking Jamaican nanny?

98
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:17,195
Do I smell like jerk sauce
and baby wipes? No!

99
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,428
Me no want no partner!

100
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:21,368
I'm not
babysitting some fucking rook.

101
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:23,482
Yes, you are.

102
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:26,382
Just because your dad was
Chief fucking Marcus Banks

103
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,692
doesn't mean
you get out of the shit.

104
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,438
Stop making this
about my father, okay?

105
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,310
He's gone, you're the head
of the department now.

106
00:10:31,394 --> 00:10:32,729
Yeah. Drama queen.

107
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:33,728
Zeke, it's been 12 years.

108
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,702
Yes! Twelve fucking years.

109
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:39,893
Twelve years ago,
I turned in a dirty cop,

110
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:42,418
I get a medal for it.
Big fucking deal!

111
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:44,104
I also got a bullet,

112
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,103
and I got to look over my back
for the rest of my career.

113
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:48,751
Shut up!

114
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:50,214
It is too fucking hot in here

115
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:52,055
for me to listen
to this bullshit.

116
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,508
I got a heat wave going on.

117
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:54,646
We got rolling blackouts,

118
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:57,161
the city is nuts. Stop!

119
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:58,880
You wanted to see me, Captain?

120
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,226
Yeah, come in.

121
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,351
Zeke, I want you to meet

122
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:04,640
Detective in training,
William Schenk.

123
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:07,802
He was the top of his academy,
so don't screw this up.

124
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:10,645
Zeke is going to break you in,
show you the ropes.

125
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:13,153
Detective Banks, it's good to...

126
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,548
Yup...

127
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:17,520
- Go.
- Okay.

128
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:19,055
<i>Officer Harris, 1-0-3.</i>

129
00:11:19,135 --> 00:11:20,670
<i>Officer Harris, 1-0-3.</i>

130
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:37,207
<i>Sergeant Jones, front desk.</i>

131
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,233
<i>Sergeant Jones, front desk.</i>

132
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:44,745
So, uh... How do you take
your coffee in the morning?

133
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:45,955
Alone.

134
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:49,193
Okay.

135
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:55,861
Hey, man, I get it.

136
00:11:55,989 --> 00:11:58,925
I wouldn't want to be stuck
with some random kid either.

137
00:11:59,091 --> 00:12:01,093
You don't want to be my partner.

138
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:03,198
You don't know that.

139
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:06,062
Your dad's the reason
for all of this.

140
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,052
He's why I wanted to do this
in the first place.

141
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,121
And I'm not him.

142
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:13,453
Prepare to be underwhelmed.

143
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:15,921
Banks and Schenk...

144
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:18,661
Some homeless guy got hit
by the 3 train. You're up.

145
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:22,151
<i>Detective Peterson,</i>

146
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:24,091
<i>pick up 2-2-1.
Detective Peterson, 2-2-1.</i>

147
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:33,272
This is you?

148
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,438
Beats the squad car.

149
00:12:39,562 --> 00:12:42,338
Detective Banks
en route to that 10-19.

150
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,322
Would that be north
or south side of the street?

151
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,446
- <i>Northbound.</i>
- Copy that.

152
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:48,962
What are you doing?

153
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,658
Oh, it's just family.

154
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:53,653
This is my wife, Emma,
this is my son, Charlie.

155
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:56,107
They're cute.
Enjoy it while it lasts.

156
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:57,538
"While it lasts"?

157
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,811
Nothing happier than the wife
of a new detective,

158
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,008
and nothing more angry

159
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:05,478
than that same bitch
10 years later.

160
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,331
Maybe it's 'cause
you call them bitches.

161
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,429
I'm half-Italian, trust me.

162
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:10,184
Women do not like it
when you call them bitches...

163
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,175
What are you telling me
about women,

164
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,186
young motherfucker? Shit.

165
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:16,500
I just said it to you,
I didn't say it to a woman.

166
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,055
I don't say it to their face.
It's not like I'm Too Short.

167
00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:21,574
We just met, but, you know,
you're firing already, and I appreciate it.

168
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,986
I mean, all I'm saying is,
you know,

169
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,204
most crime happens
on weekends, holidays,

170
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:27,260
so you would think
anybody married to a cop

171
00:13:27,377 --> 00:13:29,146
would understand this.

172
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,491
But no.

173
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:32,609
One day, your wife will be angry

174
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,581
'cause you couldn't go to
her sister's birthday dinner.

175
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:38,707
You can give a woman
600 Tuesdays.

176
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,892
It ain't worth
three Saturday nights.

177
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,381
So, uh... I'm guessing
you're divorced.

178
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:55,833
Divorced, no, not yet.
I'm going through a divorce.

179
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,874
That's even worse.
It's kind of like chemo.

180
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:00,679
Shit. Sorry.

181
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:04,224
Sorry for what? We're cops.
This is the life we choose.

182
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:07,016
Highest divorce rate,
highest suicide rate.

183
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:09,789
Highest rate
of domestic violence.

184
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:11,967
Yo, when you decided
to become a cop,

185
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,176
you pretty much assured yourself

186
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:16,196
you were gonna die alone.

187
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:21,180
My wife and I,
we're doing this counseling.

188
00:14:21,262 --> 00:14:24,459
She's got me, uh, working on,
like, communication.

189
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,978
Counseling?
Yeah, that's nice.

190
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:29,199
Yeah, my wife
fucked the counselor.

191
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:30,633
Fuck, really?

192
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:32,353
- Yeah.
- Jesus.

193
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:34,871
Women cheat, too.

194
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:39,594
It hurts. God damn it, it hurts.

195
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:42,521
Women cheat, too,
but here's what happens.

196
00:14:42,686 --> 00:14:45,382
Women cheat in the daytime.

197
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:48,531
You can get away with
a lot of shit in the daytime.

198
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:49,595
That's right. You can ride

199
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,593
- a lot of dick before dusk.
- Mmm-hmm.

200
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:58,030
Shit, man, I just found out
Pilates doesn't even exist.

201
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:00,317
Wait, seriously?

202
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:02,422
Emma loves Pilates.

203
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,653
I'm sure she does.
I'm sure she does.

204
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,551
But don't worry about it.

205
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:10,432
You're gonna be fine.
You gonna be married forever.

206
00:15:14,638 --> 00:15:16,005
What do we got?

207
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:17,433
See for yourself.

208
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:20,940
Watch yourself.

209
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,475
Ugh.

210
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:34,030
If you're gonna throw up,
don't do it on the evidence.

211
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:35,859
Are you kidding me?

212
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:38,607
I've been dreaming about this
since I was 12 years old.

213
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:40,182
Ugh.

214
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,060
You see a lot of TV sets
on the subway?

215
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,939
You get everything
down here.

216
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:52,211
Damn. Wow.

217
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,146
Ugh.

218
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:03,643
This bum's
gonna be tough to ID.

219
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,966
I'm not too sure this is a bum.

220
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:11,366
I don't know a lot of bums
trying to get their steps in.

221
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:15,469
Whoever this is, is married...

222
00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:19,586
and wears a Fitbit.

223
00:16:44,063 --> 00:16:45,831
This package just came in.

224
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:47,376
- For me?
- Yeah.

225
00:16:57,386 --> 00:16:58,387
What is that?

226
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:04,088
"Play me."

227
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:13,050
- Okay.
- Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

228
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:17,305
Don't want to fuck up
my computer.

229
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:22,211
<i>Hello, Detective Banks.</i>

230
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,953
<i>I'm here to help reform
the Metro Police,</i>

231
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:28,676
<i>to remind them of their oath
to the people of this city.</i>

232
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:32,330
<i>One officer from your station
refused to be reformed.</i>

233
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:35,247
<i>He will not be the last
to play my game.</i>

234
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:38,412
If that spiral
is what I think it is...

235
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,469
Jigsaw?

236
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,113
Wait, I thought
the Jigsaw killer was dead?

237
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,153
Yeah, but if it's
another copycat...

238
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:44,814
It's gonna be a shit show.

239
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:46,826
I recognize that building.

240
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:48,141
It's the courthouse.

241
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,314
Let's check it out.

242
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:11,139
What are you guys
doing here?

243
00:18:11,242 --> 00:18:13,044
Well, we thought you boys
might need some backup.

244
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:15,180
Fuck you, Fitch,
it's not your case.

245
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:17,454
Yo, Zeke.

246
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:26,916
What do we got here?

247
00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:38,905
What the fuck is that?

248
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:41,561
Is that a fucking tongue?

249
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:47,676
Fucking shit.

250
00:18:54,911 --> 00:18:57,047
4-5-3... Who's 4-5-3?

251
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:03,332
Circle up!

252
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,537
Okay, here's what we know.

253
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:08,533
Dental records confirm it's Boz.

254
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:11,238
Sorry, guys.

255
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:14,966
But, look, we got to catch the
son of a bitch that did this.

256
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,848
Train conductor says
he didn't see much.

257
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,007
Says he saw
Boz hanging in the air

258
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:19,663
right before
he hit the windshield.

259
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,961
Says he thinks he saw Boz
bleeding from the mouth badly.

260
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,879
The package was sent
from a delivery service

261
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:26,418
that picked it up
on a stoop on Anglin Drive.

262
00:19:26,818 --> 00:19:28,002
What about the spirals?

263
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:30,149
Hey, Cap, obviously
it's a Jigsaw copycat,

264
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,874
so that's where we got to
concentrate our focus.

265
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:34,289
Sure, Fitch, but I want you
to stick with hard evidence.

266
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,118
Kraus, contact the Feds,
get anything they got.

267
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:39,536
Files, old videos, anything.

268
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,642
Do we have street images?

269
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:42,431
We're working on it,
but Digital Forensics was

270
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,161
able to map Boz's movement
off the Fitbit.

271
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:46,167
Last place it was registered
was Stuart's Point,

272
00:19:46,255 --> 00:19:48,425
time-stamped
during the fireworks.

273
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:50,663
Someone needs to call Kara,
his wife, let her. know.

274
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:51,786
Yeah, I already called her.

275
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:55,647
You called Kara?

276
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:57,413
Yeah.

277
00:19:57,501 --> 00:19:59,206
- Do you know Kara?
- No.

278
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:02,095
Did you actually talk to her,
or did you text her?

279
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:04,660
Let me guess,
you sent an emoji.

280
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,364
Do they have
a dead husband emoji?

281
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:07,940
I talked to her, asshole.

282
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:11,436
Hey. We had to notify her
before it leaked to the press.

283
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:12,786
Okay, O'Brien's got point...

284
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:13,857
O'Brien?

285
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:17,227
This is mine.

286
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:19,717
Me and the rook
were first on scene.

287
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:22,468
Banks...

288
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,011
I'm sorry, isn't this protocol?

289
00:20:25,144 --> 00:20:26,647
Now you're part of
the team again, Zeke?

290
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:33,204
Fuck you.

291
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,708
No, fuck you.

292
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,826
Come on, Zeke.

293
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:39,024
When all you motherfuckers
were treating me like shit,

294
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:42,693
shooting me in my fucking back,

295
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:45,082
Boz was my friend!

296
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,376
Boz played with my kid.

297
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:50,495
We went to fucking games.

298
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:55,273
Fuck me? No, fuck you.

299
00:20:57,978 --> 00:20:59,370
Fucking assholes...

300
00:20:59,514 --> 00:21:03,351
Zeke! Zeke, fucking stop!

301
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,967
In here! Now!

302
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:14,509
Zip up! Get out.

303
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:15,763
Okay, Captain.

304
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:23,826
Damn, nigga, wash your hands.

305
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:25,743
I get why you want this.

306
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:28,711
Boz was my friend, too,
but you can't do this alone.

307
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:31,336
I need the whole department
on this, working together.

308
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,290
I'm not trying
to do this alone, okay?

309
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:37,365
Boz is my family, man.
You gotta let me take lead.

310
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:43,942
You gotta let me catch
this motherfucker.

311
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:51,553
All right, guys,
we got a change of plans.

312
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:54,730
Banks is taking lead.

313
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:57,783
Listen up.

314
00:21:58,165 --> 00:22:00,833
I know some of you guys
think I'm a rat.

315
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,505
Some of you think I'm a snitch.

316
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:08,237
Some of you are mad
I fucked your mother.

317
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,257
Boz was last seen

318
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:16,407
at the July 4th parade
at Stuart's Point...

319
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:20,274
...so there should be plenty
of surveillance footage,

320
00:22:20,345 --> 00:22:23,221
so check your hashtags,
Instagram...

321
00:22:23,338 --> 00:22:24,889
Hey!

322
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:28,180
Now, we got a dead cop here,
guys, who was brutally killed.

323
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:31,191
A fallen brother
whose tongue was ripped out.

324
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,797
We need to focus on the case
and solve this.

325
00:22:33,903 --> 00:22:36,141
So get the footage
to Detective Banks

326
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:38,064
and put your
personal shit aside.

327
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,695
O'Brien, you good?

328
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:42,002
No problem here, Captain.

329
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:43,912
Good.

330
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,864
Let's go.

331
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:55,584
Yo, where we going?

332
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:57,758
Pay our respects. Put on a suit.

333
00:23:16,618 --> 00:23:17,605
Zeke...

334
00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:19,539
Kara...

335
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:21,195
It's okay.

336
00:23:21,302 --> 00:23:23,242
Whoever did this,
I'm gonna find them.

337
00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:25,975
I don't understand...
How did it happen?

338
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:28,480
Kara,
your mother's on the phone.

339
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:29,653
Yeah, okay.

340
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:31,377
Zeke.

341
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:33,044
Lisa.

342
00:23:35,608 --> 00:23:37,985
You okay? I, uh... I texted you.

343
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:39,242
Yeah, I got it.

344
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:42,252
Is Brian here?

345
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,535
No, my sister's watching him.

346
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:47,283
Your sister... So, Rhonda gets
to see my son, but I don't?

347
00:23:48,972 --> 00:23:50,375
Are we really gonna
do this here?

348
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:55,479
No. Not today.

349
00:23:55,597 --> 00:23:56,545
- Hey, I'm William.
- Stop.

350
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:57,809
Zeke's partner, yup...

351
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:08,149
I'll wait outside.
I'll wait outside.

352
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:09,722
Jamie's at the neighbor's.

353
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:13,263
I don't know how I'm supposed to
tell him what happened to his dad.

354
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,343
I can't imagine what
you're going through right now.

355
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,382
I know this is a bad time,

356
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:24,544
but I got to ask you
a couple of questions.

357
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:28,104
In the last few weeks,

358
00:24:28,496 --> 00:24:31,174
did you notice anything unusual?

359
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:35,778
I mean, did Boz say anything,
or act stressed out?

360
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:38,706
He was a cop, Zeke.

361
00:24:38,817 --> 00:24:40,346
So nothing out of the ordinary?

362
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,395
No.

363
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:44,635
There was one thing,
there was a black SUV

364
00:24:44,729 --> 00:24:46,997
parked outside
one night last week.

365
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:48,906
You get a make?

366
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:51,838
- Range Rover, Escalade, Lincoln?
- I don't know.

367
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,631
I told Boz about it
and he went out,

368
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:56,723
and he walked up,
and, I don't know,

369
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:59,144
the next thing I know, he was
yelling at somebody inside.

370
00:24:59,195 --> 00:25:00,964
Any idea
what they were yelling about?

371
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,218
Did you hear anything?

372
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:05,653
No. If I see it again,
I'll get a license plate.

373
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:08,564
If you don't mind,
could you get me his devices?

374
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:11,935
I need to look
at his iPad, laptop.

375
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:14,115
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Kara.

376
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:20,678
Nice... I gotta go, guys.
All right, be safe.

377
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:25,372
Zeke.

378
00:25:26,397 --> 00:25:28,257
He knew you were a good cop.

379
00:25:28,455 --> 00:25:29,856
You find out who did this.

380
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:16,682
You pull a gun on your old man?

381
00:26:16,831 --> 00:26:18,110
You out of your fucking mind?

382
00:26:18,214 --> 00:26:19,060
I could have killed you.

383
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:20,805
What are you talking about?
I got the gun.

384
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:23,406
I could have killed you.

385
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,911
How'd you get in here?

386
00:26:24,977 --> 00:26:26,414
Did you forget
who the landlord is?

387
00:26:26,482 --> 00:26:27,779
Yeah, but that doesn't
give you the right

388
00:26:27,857 --> 00:26:29,995
to just walk in here
anytime you want.

389
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,849
Renters got rights.

390
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:33,130
You start paying some rent,
you can get some rights.

391
00:26:36,401 --> 00:26:39,304
Heard about Boz. You all right?

392
00:26:41,129 --> 00:26:42,930
No, Dad, I'm... I'm fucked up.

393
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:46,700
Sorry to hear that.
I know how close you were.

394
00:26:49,132 --> 00:26:54,090
Jigsaw copycat.
That could be difficult.

395
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:55,226
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

396
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:57,110
Just, you know,
being lead detective,

397
00:26:57,236 --> 00:26:58,639
a lot of responsibility.

398
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,598
You got a problem with that?

399
00:27:00,678 --> 00:27:02,686
Or are you just scared
I'm gonna embarrass you?

400
00:27:02,777 --> 00:27:04,578
See? That right there.

401
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,618
This ain't about you.

402
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,932
You always making shit
about you.

403
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:12,083
That's the shit
that ruined your career

404
00:27:12,156 --> 00:27:13,321
and your marriage.

405
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:15,497
So, now you're giving
fatherly advice?

406
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,452
What you talkin' 'bout, Willis?

407
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:20,725
Dad. We live
in the same building.

408
00:27:20,794 --> 00:27:22,625
I saw you out front
the other day,

409
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:25,978
you nodded at me like we were the
only two black guys in the mall.

410
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:28,290
We haven't had a meal together
in over a year.

411
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:30,756
Haven't had a meal?

412
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,301
What? Are you hungry, nigga?

413
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:34,088
You want to go get
a fucking slice?

414
00:27:34,845 --> 00:27:35,914
Let me tell you something.

415
00:27:36,018 --> 00:27:41,356
My father went to work,
came home. That was it.

416
00:27:41,488 --> 00:27:43,734
All right, I'm gonna
get out of here, son.

417
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:46,413
I'm gonna go to Kara's,
pay my respects.

418
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,998
You're gonna be all right.

419
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:52,041
Come over tonight, I'll order some
food, we'll go over the case.

420
00:28:03,185 --> 00:28:05,624
Just because your dad was
Chief fucking Marcus Banks...

421
00:28:05,722 --> 00:28:07,847
Stop making this about my father.
Twelve years ago,

422
00:28:07,922 --> 00:28:10,067
I turned in a dirty cop.

423
00:28:11,295 --> 00:28:12,740
Pete! Pete!

424
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:14,176
What happened? What happened?

425
00:28:14,256 --> 00:28:15,690
He pulled a gun on me.

426
00:28:17,423 --> 00:28:19,362
The witness pulled a gun on you?

427
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:23,400
Because there's nobody on the force
I can fucking trust!

428
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:46,231
I've been staring at this shit
for five hours.

429
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:48,264
I don't even look at porn
that long.

430
00:28:55,856 --> 00:28:58,022
Okay, I'm out. What's next?

431
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,048
Well, why don't you check
with Digital Forensics

432
00:29:00,117 --> 00:29:03,888
and see if anybody in Boz's
phone log has a black SUV?

433
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:05,732
My phone is dead,
you got a charger?

434
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:07,335
Your phone's dead,
what are you, a little girl?

435
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:08,496
Let me borrow your phone,
shut up.

436
00:29:08,573 --> 00:29:09,178
Okay.

437
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:10,792
Thank you.

438
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:13,818
Don't drain my battery
watching <i>Twilight.</i>

439
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:21,203
Glad to see you joined us.

440
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:23,174
You think this is linked
to John Kramer?

441
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,687
I sent some pictures to the
Feds, we'll see what happens.

442
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:28,332
How are we doing
on surveillance?

443
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,470
Please tell me the $20 million the
city spent on cameras got us something?

444
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:33,266
Drury?

445
00:29:34,517 --> 00:29:37,846
Yeah... Street cameras
from here to here

446
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:39,550
have already been
scrubbed through.

447
00:29:39,637 --> 00:29:41,772
Facial recognition came up
with nothing.

448
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:44,597
There were two cameras
broken on this corner.

449
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,769
<i>Fitch and Kraus are there now
to canvas it.</i>

450
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,370
No. Closed. Closed.

451
00:30:40,368 --> 00:30:41,735
There's Boz.

452
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,078
Who's that he's chasing?

453
00:30:44,211 --> 00:30:45,847
I know that guy.

454
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:49,083
Benny Wrights. He's a hustler.

455
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:50,415
Serious tweaker.

456
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:53,332
Flops in a burnt-out
bread factory down on 12th.

457
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,192
Deals with a pusher,
street name Speez.

458
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:58,763
- Should we tell Zeke?
- Fuck him.

459
00:30:58,946 --> 00:31:01,447
I'll take the building,
you track down Speez.

460
00:31:04,657 --> 00:31:06,825
Hey, boss, let me see
that gun over there.

461
00:31:06,993 --> 00:31:09,528
The one on the left.
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on.

462
00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:16,440
On behalf of the Metro Police,

463
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:18,603
I want to thank you
for your generosity.

464
00:31:24,762 --> 00:31:26,731
I got shit to do. I'm out.

465
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:29,258
What's his deal?

466
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:31,150
He's a crooked piece of shit.

467
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:34,590
- Let's just call it a night.
- You sure?

468
00:31:34,652 --> 00:31:35,881
Yeah. Go home.

469
00:31:35,943 --> 00:31:37,708
Go see your wife,
go see your kid.

470
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:38,776
What's your boy's name?

471
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:40,037
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

472
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,625
All right, I'll put him down
and come right back.

473
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:43,218
No, no, no,
I'm not going to be here.

474
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:45,116
Meeting my dad for dinner,
gonna go over the case.

475
00:31:45,211 --> 00:31:46,212
Okay.

476
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:49,557
Hey, William.

477
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:50,809
Yeah?

478
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:53,336
Good work today.

479
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,329
Thanks, man.

480
00:31:57,494 --> 00:31:59,195
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

481
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:27,914
Benny?

482
00:32:39,688 --> 00:32:40,956
Wake up, Benny.

483
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,679
Rise and shine, my man.

484
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,419
Benny, come on. Get up.

485
00:32:59,551 --> 00:33:01,084
Come on, Benny, get up.

486
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,791
You all right?

487
00:33:12,096 --> 00:33:13,630
Fuck me.

488
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:33,676
<i>This is Deborah
Kraus, leave me a message.</i>

489
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:35,395
Kraus, call me.

490
00:33:40,283 --> 00:33:41,585
<i>Lieutenant Tim O'Brien here,</i>

491
00:33:41,676 --> 00:33:43,125
<i>leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

492
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:15,327
Help! Help me!

493
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,610
<i>Hello, Detective Fitch.</i>

494
00:34:41,197 --> 00:34:42,899
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

495
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:52,116
- <i>Hey, Zeke.</i>
- William.

496
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:53,035
<i>What are you doing up?</i>

497
00:34:53,097 --> 00:34:54,992
<i>I told you to take
the rest of the night off.</i>

498
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,940
Uh, it's fine,
Charlie's sleeping.

499
00:34:57,715 --> 00:34:59,751
Was sleeping.

500
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:01,488
Just waiting for Emma to get
home, she's having a girl's night.

501
00:35:01,563 --> 00:35:04,476
Girl's night out. Okay.

502
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:05,784
You better be careful with that,

503
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:07,629
might be a dick night out.

504
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:08,651
Just because
you're getting a divorce,

505
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,936
it doesn't mean that everyone
else's marriages have to end, too.

506
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,692
Sounds like
you got your hands full.

507
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:15,847
You want to call me back?

508
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:17,027
<i>Nah, it's okay,</i>

509
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:18,733
<i>we're sleep-training.
It's a fucking nightmare.</i>

510
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:21,405
Look, man, um... I know
you and Boz were close,

511
00:35:21,468 --> 00:35:22,955
<i>I don't know
how to tell you this.</i>

512
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:25,761
You got something to say,
William, say it.

513
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:28,178
Well, I'm looking through all
the Metro records like you asked,

514
00:35:28,297 --> 00:35:31,133
and Boz was accused of lying on
the stand more than anybody...

515
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,401
by like a wide fucking margin.

516
00:35:34,512 --> 00:35:35,580
<i>Jesus.</i>

517
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:37,905
The courthouse...

518
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:42,024
That's why the tongue
was at the courthouse.

519
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,962
Can I help you?

520
00:35:48,143 --> 00:35:49,546
Are you Marcus Banks?

521
00:35:49,662 --> 00:35:51,545
- No, I'm his son.
- Well, Terroni delivery.

522
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:52,833
Oh, okay.

523
00:35:58,943 --> 00:36:00,010
Dad!

524
00:36:25,737 --> 00:36:27,606
Pop, got your food.

525
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:46,032
Motherfucker!

526
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,233
How the fuck
could you not call me first?

527
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,549
I tried, but you didn't answer.

528
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:52,467
Well, why didn't you wait for me
to fucking call you back?

529
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,713
'Cause you would have
talked me out of it.

530
00:36:54,903 --> 00:36:55,839
I told the truth.

531
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:57,663
Get the fuck
out of my face, Zeke.

532
00:36:57,988 --> 00:36:59,356
Can we get the room?

533
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,347
God damn it.

534
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:08,840
I knew I should have never
let him become a cop.

535
00:37:11,902 --> 00:37:13,857
This shit's gonna go
sideways fast.

536
00:37:13,974 --> 00:37:16,443
He turned in a dirty cop.
Pete was a scumbag.

537
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:17,720
Press will make him out
to be a hero.

538
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,278
And what about the other cops?

539
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:20,920
You think they're gonna
call him a hero, too?

540
00:37:21,988 --> 00:37:23,103
He did the right thing.

541
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:25,780
You know how much internal
damage control I have to do?

542
00:37:25,884 --> 00:37:27,719
We'll handle it.

543
00:37:27,993 --> 00:37:30,423
We always do, huh?

544
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:33,241
Chief Banks,
WF Action News here.

545
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,429
Are you in?

546
00:37:43,532 --> 00:37:45,943
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I think your face

547
00:37:46,006 --> 00:37:48,107
was trespassing on my property.

548
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,976
Is there something
I can help you with?

549
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:51,868
No.

550
00:37:52,012 --> 00:37:54,213
All right. Fuck you very much.

551
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:21,215
For Detective Zeke Banks.

552
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,198
Banks, incoming.

553
00:38:29,278 --> 00:38:30,810
On my desk. Right now.

554
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:31,723
A courier brought it.

555
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,910
We're holding him
for questioning.

556
00:38:50,904 --> 00:38:52,873
<i>Hello, Detective Banks.</i>

557
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:56,031
<i>Salvation was offered,
but it was declined.</i>

558
00:38:56,103 --> 00:38:58,105
This fucker thinks he's Jigsaw.

559
00:38:58,216 --> 00:38:59,441
Even got a doll this time.

560
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,225
<i>I have a bone to pick
with the police department,</i>

561
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:04,265
<i>and if you're going
to point fingers...</i>

562
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:05,851
12th Street Bridge.
I know that place.

563
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,172
<i>...you should start by
pointing them at yourselves.</i>

564
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:09,853
Geez, that's two blocks away.

565
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:13,204
<i>Until you come clean,
many more will die.</i>

566
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:31,504
Stay back.

567
00:39:33,202 --> 00:39:34,538
Stay sharp.

568
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:47,336
Whoa,
hold it there, guys.

569
00:40:12,982 --> 00:40:14,616
What a sick fuck, man.

570
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,901
What the fuck?

571
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:24,404
Oh, no...

572
00:40:29,848 --> 00:40:31,583
God almighty.

573
00:40:31,718 --> 00:40:32,919
9-8-2.

574
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:35,383
It's Fitch.

575
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:36,742
<i>This is Detective Banks</i>

576
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:37,901
requesting backup.

577
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:40,015
<i>I'm on Decker Street.
Request backup!</i>

578
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,553
- Fuck him.
- <i>In pursuit,</i>

579
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:44,325
requesting backup!

580
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:57,605
- Ah, fuck!
- Fuck me.

581
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,272
You're going
to be okay, stay with me.

582
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:09,614
You're good,
you're gonna be okay.

583
00:41:09,711 --> 00:41:10,385
You're gonna be just fine.

584
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:11,521
- Zeke!
- Sir! Please, please!

585
00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:12,702
Let us do our job, come on.

586
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:14,862
Come on, let us do our jobs,
let's go. Let's go.

587
00:41:14,946 --> 00:41:18,143
Where the fuck
were all of you, huh?

588
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,812
My son called for backup
three times in eight minutes

589
00:41:21,908 --> 00:41:23,809
and none of you motherfuckers
could get here?

590
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,718
Nobody? Nothing?

591
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:29,310
Crickets. All right,
this is what I'm going to do.

592
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:31,375
I'm going to call Dispatch

593
00:41:31,493 --> 00:41:35,063
and find out
who was closest available,

594
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,212
and when I do,
I'm going to take this gun

595
00:41:38,297 --> 00:41:39,824
and shoot that motherfucker.

596
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:42,300
We clear?

597
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,281
Fitch, it was you?

598
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,944
You fucking with my son again?

599
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,919
God damn you, son of a bitch!

600
00:41:48,988 --> 00:41:49,705
Get off me!

601
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:51,504
You're done, motherfucker,
you hear me?

602
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:52,838
You're fucking done!

603
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:55,565
Don't let me see
your face again.

604
00:41:57,366 --> 00:41:58,508
All right, call Kraus,

605
00:41:58,613 --> 00:42:00,682
find out Fitch's last location.

606
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:14,027
<i>Hello, Detective Fitch.</i>

607
00:42:14,762 --> 00:42:16,324
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

608
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:20,617
<i>The tide of justice

609

<i>In 90 seconds,

610
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,327
<i>to the height
of the copper wires,</i>

611
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:27,586
<i>and if you are still
in the tank,</i>

612
00:42:27,698 --> 00:42:29,412
<i>you will be electrocuted.</i>

613
00:42:29,473 --> 00:42:32,576
<i>Unless you make the sacrifice
that will cleanse you.</i>

614
00:42:32,697 --> 00:42:34,365
God... Oh, God...

615
00:42:34,443 --> 00:42:37,246
<i>You murdered a man
because he insulted you.</i>

616
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:37,886
<i>Put your hands</i>

617
00:42:37,964 --> 00:42:39,567
<i>where I can see them,
motherfucker.</i>

618
00:42:40,181 --> 00:42:42,050
<i>I said put your hands
where I can see them, sir.</i>

619
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,743
<i>Your finger pulled the trigger</i>

620
00:42:48,851 --> 00:42:51,672
<i>and that cannot happen again.</i>

621
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:55,667
<i>Survival is simple,
but it comes with a sacrifice.</i>

622
00:42:55,763 --> 00:42:58,638
<i>Bite down on the device
in your mouth,</i>

623
00:42:58,722 --> 00:43:00,290
<i>which will start the motor</i>

624
00:43:00,386 --> 00:43:02,279
<i>that will
rip your fingers away...</i>

625
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,374
<i>...leaving you free</i>

626
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:05,285
<i>to escape with your life.</i>

627
00:43:05,411 --> 00:43:07,063
<i>But if you don't act quickly,</i>

628
00:43:07,188 --> 00:43:10,134
<i>all that awaits you
is this watery tomb.</i>

629
00:43:10,307 --> 00:43:13,477
<i>Live or die, make your choice.</i>

630
00:44:52,265 --> 00:44:55,747
Hey, Kraus, anything special about
the bridge where we found the fingers?

631
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,492
Yeah, why that bridge?

632
00:44:57,614 --> 00:45:00,617
It was where he shot that kid,
Jimmy Lincoln.

633
00:45:00,746 --> 00:45:03,448
Then how did you guys
find out about this place?

634
00:45:03,732 --> 00:45:04,891
This guy, Benny Wrights,

635
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,286
who Boz was last seen with
on July 4th.

636
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,449
How do you know
who Boz was last seen with?

637
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:11,816
We took it off a pawn shop feed
in Stuart Point.

638
00:45:11,928 --> 00:45:13,329
And you didn't tell me.

639
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,847
Who the fuck did this?

640
00:45:16,928 --> 00:45:19,331
Somebody who has it out
for the Metro PD.

641
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:23,094
Or maybe just for Fitch.

642
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:24,871
You trying to
say something, Drury?

643
00:45:25,007 --> 00:45:26,212
You know what I'm saying.

644
00:45:26,302 --> 00:45:28,204
I doubt you'll be
shedding tears for Fitch.

645
00:45:28,315 --> 00:45:29,351
All right, come on.
Come on, Zeke.

646
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:30,968
Fucking asshole.

647
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:32,288
Okay, ignore him.

648
00:45:33,452 --> 00:45:35,354
Did you get anything?

649
00:45:35,435 --> 00:45:40,725
Got a name. Benny Wrights.
Last guy Boz was seen with.

650
00:45:40,854 --> 00:45:43,724
Okay, find him,
and you got hours, not days.

651
00:45:45,396 --> 00:45:47,565
And this is where
Benny gets his meth.

652
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:50,044
You know what that is?

653
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,331
Is this a test?

654
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,888
- Just asking you a question.
- Uh, it's a meth house.

655
00:45:56,002 --> 00:45:57,737
You put the money in the bucket,
the meth comes down.

656
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:00,894
Oh, somebody watched <i>The Wire.</i>

657
00:46:01,031 --> 00:46:04,301
This is some
<i>New Jack City</i> shit. Goddamn.

658
00:46:12,171 --> 00:46:14,409
Don't we need
a warrant for this?

659
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,944
What you talking about?

660
00:46:47,977 --> 00:46:49,245
Zeke...

661
00:46:50,317 --> 00:46:52,319
Hey, my man, my man.

662
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,963
Just trying to get a five,
me and my lady!

663
00:46:54,054 --> 00:46:55,892
It's our anniversary,
we're trying to celebrate,

664
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:57,109
trying to do
something special.

665
00:46:57,172 --> 00:46:59,640
Can I get a five?
How about this iPad?

666
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,730
It's got everything on it.

667
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,136
I got passcodes,
I got Netflix, Hulu,

668
00:47:05,203 --> 00:47:08,699
uh, Uber Eats, Postmates.
Lots of food, lots of food.

669
00:47:08,778 --> 00:47:09,457
Let me see that...

670
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:10,662
Yo, man,
get the fuck out of here.

671
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:11,852
Do I look
fucking hungry to you?

672
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,312
Yo, yo, it got everything.
It don't fit, though.

673
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:15,432
Why don't you come down?

674
00:47:15,488 --> 00:47:16,411
Get the fuck out of here!

675
00:47:16,487 --> 00:47:17,856
Come back
when you get some money!

676
00:47:18,161 --> 00:47:20,339
Okay, okay. I need money,
I need money.

677
00:47:20,385 --> 00:47:21,486
No, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait!

678
00:47:21,535 --> 00:47:22,581
I got some,
I got some money.

679
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,209
I got some money,
hold up a second.

680
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:25,728
Hold up a second, all right?

681
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:29,304
All right, send it down, baby.

682
00:47:29,377 --> 00:47:32,013
Come on, come on,
let's do this.

683
00:47:34,494 --> 00:47:35,495
Can't wait!

684
00:47:37,756 --> 00:47:38,583
Zeke, what the fuck?

685
00:47:38,662 --> 00:47:39,817
It's got 10 seconds,
come on!

686
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:40,937
Jesus Christ.

687
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:47,269
What the fuck?

688
00:47:47,396 --> 00:47:49,365
- Move!
- Get out of the way.

689
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,989
Out of my way,
out of my way! Police!

690
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:52,997
Five-o!

691
00:47:53,084 --> 00:47:55,086
- Everybody, five-o!
- Move, move, move! Come on!

692
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:56,719
Go! Coming through.

693
00:47:56,845 --> 00:47:58,380
Fucking cops, man.

694
00:48:00,189 --> 00:48:01,467
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

695
00:48:01,532 --> 00:48:03,235
Shit! Get your dog!

696
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:05,574
- Fuck you, man.
- Get your fucking dog!

697
00:48:06,808 --> 00:48:08,510
- Now!
- Hey, be nice.

698
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:11,497
Jesus Christ.

699
00:48:11,647 --> 00:48:13,116
Holy fucking shit.

700
00:48:18,246 --> 00:48:19,448
What the fuck's going on?

701
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:20,429
Back inside.
Get back inside.

702
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:24,146
Hide your shit!

703
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:33,813
Come on!

704
00:48:33,937 --> 00:48:34,938
Fuck. Fuck!

705
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:47,021
My fucking leg!

706
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,925
Why do you make this shit
so hard?

707
00:48:48,981 --> 00:48:50,362
What if I really wanted
to get fucked up?

708
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:51,195
Motherfucker...

709
00:48:51,243 --> 00:48:53,711
You got to make it easy
for the customer, skeeve!

710
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:56,927
My fucking leg!

711
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:00,495
That leg is fucked up.

712
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:01,754
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

713
00:49:01,904 --> 00:49:02,938
Let me get a shot
for the Gram.

714
00:49:03,051 --> 00:49:04,008
Hold on for one second.

715
00:49:04,102 --> 00:49:05,329
- What the fuck...
- Hold on, hold on.

716
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:07,344
My man.

717
00:49:07,508 --> 00:49:10,001
Here we go!
You want me to tag you?

718
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,710
Fuck... Fuck you.

719
00:49:11,805 --> 00:49:13,473
- Can I tag you, motherfucker?
- Fuck you...

720
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:16,050
You see this man before?

721
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:17,658
I ain't telling you shit!

722
00:49:17,732 --> 00:49:20,480
Why, 'cause you're worried about
that bone sticking out your leg?

723
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,101
Why don't you
let me sterilize it?

724
00:49:22,184 --> 00:49:26,389
No... No... No! Fuck!

725
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,764
It's Benny! Stop, please!

726
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,703
Everybody knows that
motherfucker Benny Wrights!

727
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:38,986
He's one of
my best customers, man.

728
00:49:39,056 --> 00:49:41,144
When was the last time
you saw him?

729
00:49:41,265 --> 00:49:42,777
I ain't seen the bitch
in two days, man.

730
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,799
Word on the street
is that motherfucker OD'd.

731
00:49:48,033 --> 00:49:48,793
Fuck this snitch.

732
00:49:48,896 --> 00:49:51,333
Fuck!

733
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,775
Well,
that was a waste of time.

734
00:49:55,887 --> 00:49:58,424
Well, we know Benny's dead.

735
00:49:58,598 --> 00:50:01,166
Meth isn't the type of thing
you take a break from.

736
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,508
Besides, you see that device?

737
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:07,435
That was not designed
by anybody with rotten teeth.

738
00:50:07,548 --> 00:50:09,511
What do you think about
this whole Jigsaw angle?

739
00:50:09,603 --> 00:50:11,873
You think it's a, what-do-you-call-them,
one of those disciples?

740
00:50:12,157 --> 00:50:14,752
John Kramer
didn't target cops.

741
00:50:14,885 --> 00:50:17,122
Whoever did this
has another motive.

742
00:50:17,453 --> 00:50:18,707
Something personal.

743
00:50:18,762 --> 00:50:20,109
And they're not
following orders,

744
00:50:20,212 --> 00:50:22,294
especially the orders
of a ghost.

745
00:50:22,416 --> 00:50:24,819
Ghost or not,

746
00:50:24,993 --> 00:50:27,550
somebody's out there
pulling all the strings.

747
00:50:27,702 --> 00:50:29,238
You think this guy
sent you the boxes

748
00:50:29,345 --> 00:50:31,029
because you're the
lead detective on the case,

749
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:32,454
or because you're you?

750
00:50:32,538 --> 00:50:33,722
I don't know.

751
00:50:33,821 --> 00:50:36,957
Well, you got any enemies?
That aren't cops?

752
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,296
I don't know why she
won't give me another chance.

753
00:50:41,437 --> 00:50:43,826
I don't know, maybe
it's because you beat her

754
00:50:43,932 --> 00:50:45,233
when you drink too much.

755
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:46,568
You ever think of that?

756
00:50:46,662 --> 00:50:50,099
That's some tough love.
Who the hell is this guy?

757
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,454
Ex-cop.
Partner snitched on him,

758
00:50:53,563 --> 00:50:56,700
had to do nine years
hard time.

759
00:50:56,788 --> 00:51:00,159
The system spit him out,
now here he is.

760
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:05,047
Hey, Pete.

761
00:51:10,888 --> 00:51:11,956
Zeke.

762
00:51:13,246 --> 00:51:16,182
Last guy
I expected to see here.

763
00:51:16,403 --> 00:51:17,509
You trying to get sober?

764
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:19,472
Alcohol's not my problem.

765
00:51:19,558 --> 00:51:21,527
The glass and the bottle
can kill.

766
00:51:22,564 --> 00:51:24,311
How you doing, Pete?

767
00:51:24,465 --> 00:51:26,467
Eighteen months sober,
living in a church basement,

768
00:51:26,532 --> 00:51:27,853
who could ask
for anything more?

769
00:51:29,259 --> 00:51:31,562
Who's this?

770
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:33,551
Detective Schenk.
We're working a case together.

771
00:51:33,615 --> 00:51:34,801
Working together?

772
00:51:34,877 --> 00:51:36,280
Don't let this guy
catch you jaywalking,

773
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:37,688
or he'll stab you
right in the fucking back.

774
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:40,778
Don't forget, Pete,
you gave me the knife.

775
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,841
You're right, I did.

776
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,130
And you witnessed this cop

777
00:51:44,193 --> 00:51:45,927
throw the victim
off a rooftop?

778
00:51:46,007 --> 00:51:48,344
And you saw it,
I mean, with your own eyes?

779
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:50,485
And you can positively ID
this cop?

780
00:51:50,628 --> 00:51:53,177
He's had his foot on the neck of
this community for way too long.

781
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,376
We can't have this.

782
00:51:55,593 --> 00:51:58,830
I'll testify,
Officer Dunleavy. I'll do it.

783
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:08,503
Pete! Pete! What happened?
What happened?

784
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:10,526
He pulled a gun on me.

785
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:15,578
The witness
pulled a gun on you?

786
00:52:15,645 --> 00:52:19,482
I was mad for a long time,
but now I take responsibility.

787
00:52:19,716 --> 00:52:21,618
I should have never
pulled the trigger.

788
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,782
The guy had a family.

789
00:52:24,883 --> 00:52:27,104
It was crazy back then, right?

790
00:52:27,218 --> 00:52:29,020
We were working
under Article 8.

791
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,366
We were out of control.

792
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,386
Cops were given their own
discretion to crack down on crime.

793
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:38,836
Where were you July 4th
at 9:30 p.m.?

794
00:52:38,925 --> 00:52:42,862
Really?
That's what you're here for?

795
00:52:43,012 --> 00:52:44,874
That's what I'm here for.

796
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:48,289
Look, some guy came
to a meeting drunk

797
00:52:48,447 --> 00:52:50,925
and wanted to fight a sponsor,
so I hit him.

798
00:52:51,051 --> 00:52:52,931
Knocked him clean out.

799
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:54,891
Anyway, the cops came.
I'm still on probation,

800
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,073
but lucky for me,
it was O'Brien.

801
00:52:57,169 --> 00:52:59,904
He let the whole thing slide
because, you know...

802
00:53:02,382 --> 00:53:03,450
loyalty.

803
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:05,526
Loyalty.

804
00:53:06,862 --> 00:53:07,930
Take care, Pete.

805
00:53:09,036 --> 00:53:10,737
God loves you, Zeke.

806
00:53:12,566 --> 00:53:13,934
More than you.

807
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:21,877
<i>Can't believe
that guy used to be a cop.</i>

808
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:24,000
He shot an innocent guy,
but you turned on him?

809
00:53:24,089 --> 00:53:26,832
There's a code, and you better
learn how to follow it,

810
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,374
or you're going to spend the rest
of your life watching your back.

811
00:53:30,263 --> 00:53:32,432
Fair point.

812
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,110
Maybe it's a good thing
they made us partners.

813
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:39,424
<i>Leave a message.</i>

814
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:41,163
Yeah, Dad,
I'm at your apartment.

815
00:53:41,237 --> 00:53:42,275
I was here last night.

816
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,487
It doesn't look like
you've been home.

817
00:53:49,516 --> 00:53:50,685
All right, give me a call.

818
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:06,546
<i>You've
gotten through to William,</i>

819
00:54:06,612 --> 00:54:08,414
<i>leave a message
after the beep.</i>

820
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:09,985
Schenk, it's 9:00 a.m.,

821
00:54:10,095 --> 00:54:12,497
where the fuck are you?
Give me a call.

822
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:14,252
Just tell me
what happened, okay?

823
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:17,275
Hey! Hey! Hey!

824
00:54:17,417 --> 00:54:18,463
Put the box on the ground!

825
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:20,663
On the ground!
Hands up! Hands up!

826
00:54:20,813 --> 00:54:22,940
On the ground now!
Hands up, hands up!

827
00:54:24,448 --> 00:54:25,516
Don't move!

828
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:29,474
Get him out of here.

829
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:31,726
Take him to holding.

830
00:54:33,281 --> 00:54:35,449
I'm sorry, Banks,
he blew right past me.

831
00:54:39,457 --> 00:54:40,793
No way, Zeke,
that one is not the same.

832
00:54:40,913 --> 00:54:42,061
I'm calling the bomb squad.

833
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:44,223
Angie, you're the head
of the department.

834
00:54:44,328 --> 00:54:45,797
We got two dead cops,
there's no time.

835
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:49,121
Get everybody out.

836
00:54:49,265 --> 00:54:51,167
Everybody out! Everybody out!

837
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:53,538
Everybody, go!

838
00:55:13,615 --> 00:55:15,785
- Is that fucking skin?
- Ugh.

839
00:55:15,977 --> 00:55:18,955
"Am I getting under
your skin, Detective Banks?

840
00:55:19,077 --> 00:55:23,625
"Careful, while you're looking
for more bodies to drop,

841
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:26,423
"I'll take your head."

842
00:55:26,494 --> 00:55:28,097
"I'll take your head..."

843
00:55:28,264 --> 00:55:31,594
"Am I getting
under your skin...

844
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,971
"Am I getting
under your skin...

845
00:55:33,028 --> 00:55:35,664
"Am I getting
under your skin..."?

846
00:55:39,622 --> 00:55:41,803
...family.
This is my wife, Emma,

847
00:55:41,858 --> 00:55:43,026
this is my son, Charlie.

848
00:55:50,816 --> 00:55:52,249
What the fuck is that?

849
00:55:54,107 --> 00:55:55,562
Captain, there's something
under here.

850
00:56:04,438 --> 00:56:06,373
Constantine Paints.

851
00:56:26,145 --> 00:56:27,003
Thanks, yeah.

852
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,081
Follow me.

853
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,496
How do you know
about this place?

854
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:39,829
Zeke, how do you know
about this place?

855
00:56:39,862 --> 00:56:42,449
My dad used to take me here.

856
00:56:42,507 --> 00:56:43,995
Watch your step, gentlemen.

857
00:56:44,088 --> 00:56:46,324
It wasn't always
a butcher shop.

858
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:49,354
Used to be Constantine Trains.

859
00:56:50,589 --> 00:56:52,324
Like a hobby shop.

860
00:57:07,146 --> 00:57:08,214
Oh, my God.

861
00:57:28,616 --> 00:57:29,888
Anything?

862
00:57:29,986 --> 00:57:32,187
Well, we're
analyzing the tape recording.

863
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,929
<i>Hello, Detective Schenk,</i>

864
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:35,726
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

865
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,494
<i>You were head of your class
at the Police Academy.</i>

866
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:41,335
He was obviously skinned...

867
00:57:42,689 --> 00:57:43,514
postmortem.

868
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:45,693
Your dad's the reason I wanted
to do this in the first place.

869
00:57:45,763 --> 00:57:46,772
<i>...the body was scored first</i>

870
00:57:46,827 --> 00:57:49,760
to remove the pieces
in larger strips,

871
00:57:50,183 --> 00:57:53,153
arms, neck,
as he ripped the skin...

872
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:56,987
Maybe it's a good thing
they made us partners.

873
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,084
Even the defensive wounds,

874
00:57:58,181 --> 00:57:59,619
he clearly tried to fight back,

875
00:57:59,691 --> 00:58:01,425
which explains
the deeper gashes.

876
00:58:09,536 --> 00:58:10,440
Captain, over here.

877
00:58:10,511 --> 00:58:12,346
Is it a serial killer
targeting cops?

878
00:58:12,435 --> 00:58:13,400
Is the victim inside
a policeman?

879
00:58:13,509 --> 00:58:16,857
No comment. Commissioner Hart
will make a statement tonight.

880
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,203
We got to try
to keep his identity

881
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:23,360
out of the press
until I tell his wife.

882
00:58:25,874 --> 00:58:29,378
<i>"Am I getting under
your skin, Detective Banks?"</i>

883
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,834
Hey, O'Brien.

884
00:58:54,002 --> 00:58:55,036
Yeah, boss?

885
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,116
You seen Zeke?

886
00:58:57,038 --> 00:58:58,539
No, not for a while.

887
00:58:58,621 --> 00:59:00,155
Okay, I'm heading down
to Cold Case.

888
00:59:00,322 --> 00:59:01,757
Copy that, Captain.

889
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,385
<i>I need all available units,</i>

890
00:59:06,529 --> 00:59:08,280
<i>officer down 3rd and Beaman.</i>

891
00:59:08,316 --> 00:59:10,484
<i>Please report, 3rd and Beaman.</i>

892
00:59:27,328 --> 00:59:28,398
What do we got?

893
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:31,535
I was writing a ticket
and some guy in a pig's mask,

894
00:59:31,658 --> 00:59:33,026
he runs up on me with a knife.

895
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,810
So, he stabs your arm
and just takes off?

896
00:59:34,925 --> 00:59:36,755
I fought him off
the best I could and he...

897
00:59:36,851 --> 00:59:37,867
He took off running.

898
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,923
Is there any reason
he would have to attack you?

899
00:59:41,018 --> 00:59:44,287
No. He just wanted
to mess with the cops.

900
00:59:44,423 --> 00:59:48,393
"Careful, while you're looking
for more bodies to drop,

901
00:59:48,647 --> 00:59:49,827
"I'll take your head."

902
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,521
Angie, you're the head
of the department.

903
00:59:52,594 --> 00:59:53,466
Angie...

904
00:59:53,569 --> 00:59:54,804
Ah, fuck!

905
00:59:54,963 --> 00:59:56,665
Angie! Pick up!

906
01:00:04,148 --> 01:00:05,761
<i>Hey, you've
reached Captain Angie Garza,</i>

907
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,400
<i>leave a message at the tone.
Thanks.</i>

908
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:17,054
Angie, get to the bullpen!
He's coming for you.

909
01:00:24,263 --> 01:00:26,231
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

910
01:00:29,262 --> 01:00:30,330
Shit!

911
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:33,944
Hey! Hey! Hey!

912
01:00:44,502 --> 01:00:48,106
Hello? Hello! Shit!

913
01:01:47,356 --> 01:01:49,057
Help!

914
01:01:49,196 --> 01:01:51,131
Help!

915
01:01:53,864 --> 01:01:55,289
<i>Hello, Captain Garza.</i>

916
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:56,813
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

917
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:59,540
<i>You have covered up corruption
in your department,</i>

918
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:02,351
<i>never sticking your neck out
for the innocent.</i>

919
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,742
<i>Now, the cover-up
will be on you.</i>

920
01:02:04,775 --> 01:02:07,321
<i>In a few seconds,
boiling hot wax</i>

921
01:02:07,385 --> 01:02:09,654
<i>will be coming out of the pipe
above you.</i>

922
01:02:09,814 --> 01:02:12,793
<i>The only way to stop yourself
from being suffocated</i>

923
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,679
<i>is to sever your spinal cord</i>

924
01:02:14,781 --> 01:02:16,601
<i>with the blade
beneath your neck,</i>

925
01:02:16,682 --> 01:02:18,350
<i>which will stop the wax.</i>

926
01:02:18,438 --> 01:02:19,703
<i>You cannot walk away,</i>

927
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:21,492
<i>but you can survive.</i>

928
01:02:21,659 --> 01:02:23,561
<i>Live or die, make your choice.</i>

929
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,267
Fuck you!

930
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:38,151
Angie! Angie!

931
01:02:38,261 --> 01:02:40,096
Get the fuck out of the way!

932
01:02:56,183 --> 01:02:57,527
How come no one
is answering the phone?

933
01:02:57,592 --> 01:02:59,856
An officer was attacked,
it's fucking chaos in here.

934
01:02:59,952 --> 01:03:03,022
Angie! Angie!

935
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:07,981
Angie?

936
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,195
Zeke, what's going on?

937
01:03:10,417 --> 01:03:11,452
He's got her!

938
01:03:11,485 --> 01:03:12,342
Who's got her?

939
01:03:12,439 --> 01:03:14,160
The killer has Angie!

940
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,560
I guess you didn't hear,
the killer just

941
01:03:15,652 --> 01:03:17,134
attacked a cop
at 3rd and Beaman.

942
01:03:17,186 --> 01:03:20,766
That was just a diversion
to get us out of the precinct.

943
01:03:20,891 --> 01:03:22,726
She's down
in the fucking basement!

944
01:03:33,286 --> 01:03:34,102
Did you find Angie?

945
01:03:34,203 --> 01:03:36,138
In the basement,
in the basement!

946
01:03:36,251 --> 01:03:37,852

Shit!

It's okay, it's okay.
It's gonna be fine.

Lock it down.

You understand me?

960
01:05:24,628 --> 01:05:26,931
Lock it down, nobody gets out
of this precinct.

961
01:05:27,474 --> 01:05:30,177
I need all the footage
from the cameras

962
01:05:30,213 --> 01:05:31,414
in the evidence room.

963
01:05:32,209 --> 01:05:33,277
Okay, here...

964
01:05:33,313 --> 01:05:34,615
Here's when the call came in,

965
01:05:34,725 --> 01:05:37,177
but then there's nothing
until you come in.

966
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:42,311
You see right there, it jumps
from 13:11 to 13:24. Glitch?

967
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:44,604
No, there's no glitch,
because look,

968
01:05:44,684 --> 01:05:46,139
on the first frame,
the safe door is open,

969
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:47,478
but on the next, it's shut.

970
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:49,028
There's 13 minutes missing.

971
01:05:49,064 --> 01:05:50,466
Access to this footage,

972
01:05:50,502 --> 01:05:51,815
is that through
the computer system?

973
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:53,640
Yeah, we just need
a badge number and a password.

974
01:05:53,676 --> 01:05:55,161
I can't tell you
who deleted the video,

975
01:05:55,197 --> 01:05:58,600
but I can access who logged into
the server over the past day.

976
01:05:59,027 --> 01:06:02,352
O'Brien, Tupper, Nicholazi...

977
01:06:02,451 --> 01:06:05,802
Wait...
Who's badge number 2-1-3?

978
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:07,516
Pete Dunleavy, my old partner.

979
01:06:07,602 --> 01:06:09,638
Dunleavy?
He shouldn't have access.

980
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,843
How long's it been
since he was even on the job?

981
01:06:13,175 --> 01:06:14,005
Where you going?

982
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:15,608
To pay Pete a visit.

983
01:06:15,718 --> 01:06:18,022
Zeke, he's not the only one!

984
01:06:18,156 --> 01:06:19,355
Your father had access, too.

985
01:06:19,391 --> 01:06:21,112
Location of Schenk's body,

986
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:23,554
you said it was where
your father took you as a kid.

987
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:25,525
When was the last time
you saw your father?

988
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:29,787
- This morning.
- Bullshit.

989
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:32,134
Motherfucker!

990
01:06:32,427 --> 01:06:33,725
What the fuck, Zeke?

991
01:06:33,959 --> 01:06:34,839
Fuck you, man!

992
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:36,669
- Fuck you!
- Get the fuck out of here!

993
01:06:36,705 --> 01:06:40,264
Get him out of here! Fuck you!
You're too close!

994
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,111
You're too close
to this thing, Zeke.

995
01:06:54,453 --> 01:06:55,454
Pete!

996
01:06:56,797 --> 01:06:57,798
Pete!

997
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:00,230
Pete!

998
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:08,975
<i>Leave a message.</i>

999
01:07:09,171 --> 01:07:12,254
Dad, I've called you
three times,

1000
01:07:12,418 --> 01:07:14,381
please call me back!

1001
01:07:14,523 --> 01:07:18,050
People are asking questions
and I'm sick of making excuses.

1002
01:07:18,193 --> 01:07:20,496
You got something
to tell me? Fuck!

1003
01:08:26,384 --> 01:08:28,320
You wanna play games,
motherfucker?

1004
01:08:29,495 --> 01:08:31,497
All right, I'll play.

1005
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:12,284
You okay?

1006
01:10:15,504 --> 01:10:16,638
Hey!

1007
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:25,117
Help!

1008
01:12:00,871 --> 01:12:01,872
Pete?

1009
01:12:03,074 --> 01:12:04,610
Pete, wake up.

1010
01:12:04,878 --> 01:12:05,879
Pete!

1011
01:12:10,031 --> 01:12:11,667
What? Zeke?

1012
01:12:12,106 --> 01:12:13,407
Fuck.

1013
01:12:14,023 --> 01:12:15,459
Get me the fuck down, Zeke.

1014
01:12:16,121 --> 01:12:17,060
Come on!

1015
01:12:17,161 --> 01:12:18,496
You hacked the computer.

1016
01:12:20,123 --> 01:12:22,103
You erased
the surveillance footage.

1017
01:12:22,197 --> 01:12:23,996
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, Zeke.

1018
01:12:24,101 --> 01:12:25,737
- Did you kill Angie?
- What?

1019
01:12:25,927 --> 01:12:27,395
Did you kill Boz?

1020
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:28,377
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1021
01:12:28,413 --> 01:12:29,431
Did you kill Boz?

1022
01:12:29,467 --> 01:12:31,369
Boz? Fuck...

1023
01:12:31,405 --> 01:12:32,439
What the fuck
is with you, Zeke?

1024
01:12:32,475 --> 01:12:33,810
Get me the fuck out of here!

1025
01:12:33,846 --> 01:12:36,339
Is this some sick
fucking revenge, Zeke?

1026
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:38,394
Putting me in jail
isn't enough, huh?

1027
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:40,022
Get me the fuck out of here!

1028
01:12:49,451 --> 01:12:51,179
<i>Hello, Detective Banks.</i>

1029

1034
01:13:03,615 --> 01:13:05,280
<i>There is a way to save him,</i>

1035
01:13:05,367 --> 01:13:09,336
<i>or you can keep him locked up

01:13:14,005 --> 01:13:16,673
Huh?

I'm coming, Pete!

1054
01:15:17,164 --> 01:15:18,165
Shit.

1055
01:15:19,343 --> 01:15:21,679
Fuck. I got you, I got you.

1056
01:15:25,428 --> 01:15:26,429
Come on, Pete.

1057
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:33,026
Pete!

1058
01:15:33,559 --> 01:15:34,627
Pete!

1059
01:16:40,478 --> 01:16:43,248
You disloyal
piece of shit.

1060
01:16:47,335 --> 01:16:50,939
I've been loyal to you
since the first day we met.

1061
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:54,027
Fifteen years ago.

1062
01:16:54,225 --> 01:16:56,694
The day your partner
killed my father.

1063
01:16:59,242 --> 01:17:01,471
So, Charlie,

1064
01:17:01,552 --> 01:17:04,075
you saw this cop throw
the victim off a rooftop,

1065
01:17:04,192 --> 01:17:06,254
and you can positively ID
this cop?

1066
01:17:06,339 --> 01:17:08,508
I'll testify, Officer Dunleavy.

1067
01:17:08,712 --> 01:17:09,780
I'll do it.

1068
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,264
Pete! Pete!
What happened, what happened?

1069
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:23,241
He pulled a gun on me.

1070
01:17:23,277 --> 01:17:25,012
The witness
pulled a gun on you?

1071
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:30,571
Shh.

1072
01:17:30,675 --> 01:17:32,661
Pete killed Charlie Emmerson.

1073
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,919
What? You thought
I'd use my real name?

1074
01:17:35,023 --> 01:17:36,795
Do you have any idea
how hard it was

1075
01:17:36,831 --> 01:17:38,463
to get placed
in this department,

1076
01:17:38,499 --> 01:17:40,601
to get assigned
to be your partner?

1077
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:46,541
What about your family,
what about your son?

1078
01:17:46,772 --> 01:17:48,106
This is my son,
Charlie.

1079
01:17:50,763 --> 01:17:51,830
I don't have a son.

1080
01:17:53,983 --> 01:17:55,418
Charlie's sleeping...

1081
01:17:55,577 --> 01:17:56,948
...was sleeping.

1082
01:17:57,075 --> 01:17:59,813
<i>After Benny Wrights led Boz
down the subway tunnels...</i>

1083
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,698
I tattooed my dad's name
on his arm.

1084
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:08,884
Where is my father?

1085
01:18:09,129 --> 01:18:10,241
You'll see him soon.

1086
01:18:10,277 --> 01:18:12,079
Where the fuck is my father?

1087
01:18:12,115 --> 01:18:14,718
I didn't even ask him
to come down here. You did.

1088
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:16,034
Let me borrow your phone,
shut up.

1089
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:17,105
Okay.

1090
01:18:17,141 --> 01:18:18,351
Thank you.

1091
01:18:18,414 --> 01:18:20,715
And don't drain
my battery watching <i>Twilight.</i>

1092
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,082
Where is he?

1093
01:18:42,234 --> 01:18:43,430
Don't you want to hear
my offer?

1094
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:44,653
Do I have a choice?

1095
01:18:45,641 --> 01:18:47,167
I want to be partners.

1096
01:18:48,142 --> 01:18:51,179
You took a stand, Zeke,
against a dirty cop,

1097
01:18:51,379 --> 01:18:52,480
<i>and what did it get you?</i>

1098
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:58,709
A lifetime of watching
your back, working alone.

1099
01:18:58,836 --> 01:19:00,081
Getting the call
for every homeless bum

1100
01:19:00,117 --> 01:19:01,420
who turns up dead.

1101
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,062
I mean, let's be real,
some of these motherfuckers

1102
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:04,635
are straight up evil.

1103
01:19:04,727 --> 01:19:06,661
Fitch not backing you up...

1104
01:19:06,772 --> 01:19:08,407
Fuck him.

1105
01:19:09,332 --> 01:19:10,800
He won't repeat that mistake.

1106
01:19:12,827 --> 01:19:15,063
<i>And Boz,
always lying under oath...</i>

1107
01:19:16,849 --> 01:19:18,851
But you, you're different.

1108
01:19:19,114 --> 01:19:21,727
You're Metro's finest.

1109
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,623
That's why I want to
team up with you on this.

1110
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:26,829
You find the dirty cops and
I'll take care of the rest.

1111
01:19:26,949 --> 01:19:29,752
You want me to help you
kill cops?

1112
01:19:29,835 --> 01:19:30,935
No, fuck no.

1113
01:19:31,252 --> 01:19:32,989
Just the bad ones.

1114
01:19:33,123 --> 01:19:36,561
John Kramer was right,
the spiral.

1115
01:19:36,672 --> 01:19:40,392
A symbol of change,
evolution, progress.

1116
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:42,493
But why limit that
to an individual

1117
01:19:42,529 --> 01:19:44,534
when you can apply it
to a whole system?

1118
01:19:44,707 --> 01:19:46,944
You got shot
for doing the right thing.

1119
01:19:47,055 --> 01:19:48,381
But let's face it, these cops?

1120
01:19:48,553 --> 01:19:49,763
They're not going to clean up
on their own.

1121
01:19:49,799 --> 01:19:52,043
But we take a tongue here,

1122
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:54,515
a few bones there,
they'll come around.

1123
01:19:54,614 --> 01:19:57,718
We're going to fix
a broken department. Okay?

1124
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:59,230
You and me.

1125
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:00,334
Okay.

1126
01:20:01,658 --> 01:20:02,659
Okay.

1127
01:20:03,118 --> 01:20:04,645
Let's do it.

1128
01:20:04,724 --> 01:20:07,584
I want to trust you. I do.

1129
01:20:07,696 --> 01:20:10,633
I'm in. But my dad goes free.

1130
01:20:15,892 --> 01:20:17,928
One second.

1131
01:20:17,964 --> 01:20:20,234
<i>911,
please state your emergency.</i>

1132
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:22,360
Hello, uh, I'm at
the old soap factory

1133
01:20:22,396 --> 01:20:23,244
on Madigan Lane.

1134
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,869
There's a crazy guy
with a gun,

1135
01:20:24,978 --> 01:20:26,913
he's firing it everywhere.
Please hurry!

1136
01:20:26,949 --> 01:20:28,300
What the fuck was that?

1137
01:20:28,336 --> 01:20:30,205
You better hurry,
Zeke, SWAT's on the way.

1138
01:20:30,316 --> 01:20:32,719
Look, I want to believe you,
I do.

1139
01:20:35,252 --> 01:20:36,320
I want to trust you.

1140
01:20:37,387 --> 01:20:39,089
Take this, you'll need it.

1141
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:40,419
Come on.

1142
01:20:41,622 --> 01:20:43,223
Let's go see your dad.

1143
01:20:51,433 --> 01:20:52,734
It's time for your final test.

1144
01:21:04,781 --> 01:21:06,049
Dad.

1145
01:21:06,332 --> 01:21:07,162
Ezekiel.

1146
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:08,733
Oh, shit! Get him down!

1147
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:15,345
Oh, shit.

1148
01:21:18,089 --> 01:21:19,356
I got you, Dad.

1149
01:21:19,547 --> 01:21:20,982
Zeke. Help me, son.

1150
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:25,352
Don't worry, don't worry.

1151
01:21:25,526 --> 01:21:28,362
I'm not going to let you die.
I will get you down.

1152
01:21:32,689 --> 01:21:33,869
It's all right, just hold on.

1153
01:21:33,905 --> 01:21:35,874
Shoot this motherfucker
right now.

1154
01:21:37,523 --> 01:21:40,358
Get him down!
Get him down now!

1155
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:43,534
I thought we were partners.

1156
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:45,490
You going to shoot me, Zeke?

1157
01:21:45,627 --> 01:21:46,862
With your one bullet?

1158
01:21:47,421 --> 01:21:48,195
Bad idea.

1159
01:21:48,231 --> 01:21:49,467
It kills your dad.

1160
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:53,638
He took a shot at me,
by the way.

1161
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:55,361
Missed.

1162
01:21:55,428 --> 01:21:57,095
I wasted four.

1163
01:21:57,131 --> 01:21:58,899
That means
you got one shot left, Zeke.

1164
01:22:00,623 --> 01:22:04,544
All right, cops are here.
That gives us four minutes.

1165
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:06,983
Do you know there's 1.5 gallons
of blood in the human body, Zeke?

1166
01:22:11,165 --> 01:22:13,301
At the rate
your old man is bleeding out,

1167
01:22:13,337 --> 01:22:16,341
in just three minutes,
those jars will be full

1168
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:18,856
and your dad will be dead.

1169
01:22:18,966 --> 01:22:20,479
The only thing
that can set him free

1170
01:22:20,617 --> 01:22:24,388
is the bullet in your gun
fired at that target.

1171
01:22:24,475 --> 01:22:26,645
Either way, I've got
a foolproof way out of here.

1172
01:22:28,362 --> 01:22:29,363
You're not Jigsaw.

1173
01:22:30,264 --> 01:22:31,265
That's the game.

1174
01:22:32,302 --> 01:22:34,844
Shoot me and you both lose.

1175
01:22:34,961 --> 01:22:37,731
Shoot the target
and we both win.

1176
01:22:37,795 --> 01:22:38,884
You want to play?

1177
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:42,557
I'm dying, Zeke,
end it now.

1178
01:22:42,593 --> 01:22:43,733
<i>In this corridor.</i>

1179
01:22:43,769 --> 01:22:45,670
<i>Roger that.
Southwest entrance.</i>

1180
01:22:47,305 --> 01:22:48,672
<i>Going through the south door.</i>

1181
01:22:50,647 --> 01:22:52,449
<i>Nothing here. Keep moving.</i>

1182
01:22:52,485 --> 01:22:53,954
I need you all in.

1183
01:22:54,056 --> 01:22:55,794
Dunleavy ruined both our lives

1184
01:22:55,924 --> 01:22:57,396
and you tried to help
that piece of shit?

1185
01:22:57,465 --> 01:22:59,586
- Zeke!
- Pete!

1186
01:22:59,793 --> 01:23:01,426
You failed that test.

1187
01:23:01,547 --> 01:23:03,616
Now I need you to choose
who you're really with.

1188
01:23:03,759 --> 01:23:05,661
The man
who corrupted the force,

1189
01:23:05,764 --> 01:23:07,410
or the one
who's trying to save it.

1190
01:23:07,558 --> 01:23:08,626
You want to tell him, Chief?

1191
01:23:11,102 --> 01:23:12,085
Tell me what?

1192
01:23:12,164 --> 01:23:15,642
Tell him about all the fucking
shit you did under Article 8.

1193
01:23:16,767 --> 01:23:17,785
What's he talking about?

1194
01:23:17,821 --> 01:23:20,074
- Time's running out.
- What's he talking about?

1195
01:23:20,168 --> 01:23:22,736
Citizens were dying.

1196
01:23:22,856 --> 01:23:26,352
We did what we had to
to clean up the streets.

1197
01:23:26,412 --> 01:23:28,247
It was crazy
back then, right?

1198
01:23:28,372 --> 01:23:30,130
We were working
under Article 8,

1199
01:23:30,306 --> 01:23:31,673
we were out of control.

1200
01:23:33,672 --> 01:23:35,612
Murder rate went way down.

1201
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,573
That's fucking bullshit.

1202
01:23:37,609 --> 01:23:38,982
People felt safe again.

1203
01:23:39,018 --> 01:23:41,454
The streets got cleaner
because the cops got dirtier.

1204
01:23:41,715 --> 01:23:43,549
Your dad oversaw
the whole thing, by the way.

1205
01:23:43,612 --> 01:23:46,537
Innocent people getting shot,
all in the name of justice.

1206
01:23:46,573 --> 01:23:47,875
Article 8 was
one of the most corrupt

1207
01:23:47,911 --> 01:23:49,557
police policies in history,

1208
01:23:49,804 --> 01:23:51,215
and guess who was
your dad's right-hand man?

1209
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:53,120
Sorry, or should I say woman,
the whole time?

1210
01:23:53,235 --> 01:23:56,272
We'll handle it.
We always do, huh?

1211
01:23:56,508 --> 01:23:57,114
Angie?

1212
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:58,408
Angie!

1213
01:23:58,444 --> 01:23:59,861
It was Angie.

1214
01:23:59,897 --> 01:24:01,436
I mean,
not a massive surprise.

1215
01:24:01,574 --> 01:24:03,002
You think it was
her stellar reputation

1216
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,940
that got her a precinct
at age 35? Come on.

1217
01:24:04,976 --> 01:24:07,979
Shoot this piece of shit,
Ezekiel. Now.

1218
01:24:08,015 --> 01:24:09,584
Yeah, that's right,
because that's what cops do.

1219
01:24:09,698 --> 01:24:11,065
Shoot first,
ask questions later.

1220
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:17,387
You watched my father die
and I'm trying to save yours.

1221
01:24:17,491 --> 01:24:19,017
If we're going to trust
each other,

1222
01:24:19,423 --> 01:24:20,946
I need you to do this.

1223
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:23,085
Ezekiel...

1224
01:24:23,236 --> 01:24:26,592
You've always done
the right thing, do it now.

1225
01:24:26,964 --> 01:24:28,939
This piece of shit
is killing cops.

1226
01:24:30,496 --> 01:24:32,365
You still need to decide,

1227
01:24:32,492 --> 01:24:35,771
you can shoot me, or...

1228
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,674
Or you can save your dad.

1229
01:24:38,769 --> 01:24:40,225
Clock's ticking, man.

1230
01:24:40,331 --> 01:24:41,465
Think fast.

1231
01:24:42,405 --> 01:24:43,908
Cavalry's coming.

1232
01:24:43,964 --> 01:24:46,299
But not in time to do
any favors for your old man.

1233
01:24:46,434 --> 01:24:47,602
Only you can do that.

1234
01:24:55,565 --> 01:24:56,932
Dad? Dad?

1235
01:24:57,735 --> 01:24:58,736
Shots fired!

1236
01:25:08,584 --> 01:25:10,051
Zeke... Zeke.

1237
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:12,230
It's going to be okay.

1238
01:25:12,936 --> 01:25:16,106
He's getting away.

1239
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:18,354
Don't let him get away.

1240
01:25:18,467 --> 01:25:20,569
Go... Go!

1241
01:25:38,214 --> 01:25:39,740
Stop. Don't come in.

1242
01:25:39,776 --> 01:25:40,811
Don't come in.

1243
01:25:56,634 --> 01:25:57,635
Oh, God.

1244
01:25:58,005 --> 01:26:01,008
Whoever did this has another
motive, something personal.

1245
01:26:01,251 --> 01:26:02,452
Whoever did this...

1246
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:06,019
...they're pulling
all the strings.

1247
01:26:09,844 --> 01:26:11,612
Your dad is the reason
for all of this.

1248
01:26:11,737 --> 01:26:13,537
He's why I wanted to do this
in the first place.

1249
01:26:13,681 --> 01:26:15,583
I've been dreaming about this
since I was 12 years old.

1250
01:26:22,146 --> 01:26:24,081
What the fuck is going on?

1251
01:26:28,466 --> 01:26:30,660
Go, go, go!

1252
01:26:30,696 --> 01:26:32,297
Get down! Get down now!

1253
01:26:32,447 --> 01:26:33,483
Let me see your hands!

1254
01:26:33,914 --> 01:26:35,390
No! No, no, stop!

1255
01:26:35,476 --> 01:26:36,366
No! God!

1256
01:26:36,402 --> 01:26:38,036
- Freeze!
- No, no!

1257
01:26:41,552 --> 01:26:42,587
No!

1258
01:26:42,862 --> 01:26:44,229
Put it down!

1259
01:26:45,129 --> 01:26:46,341
Lower your weapon!

1260
01:26:46,377 --> 01:26:47,378
Fire!

1261
01:27:09,799 --> 01:27:12,769
No!

1262
01:27:16,155 --> 01:27:18,984
