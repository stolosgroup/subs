The only disruptive

23

<i>But it does not disturb
me nearly as much as does</i>

37
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:51,970
- It's not...
- Ted, it doesn't work.

38
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:54,407
- Huh?
- It's broke, it's broke.

39
00:15:58,411 --> 00:15:59,845
Just hold on real tight.

40
00:16:01,681 --> 00:16:03,248
Whoa!

41
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:08,887
I couldn't help myself.

54
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:43,248
Seventy-five cents.

55
00:17:43,282 --> 00:17:45,150
Hi. Hi, Ma, it's me.

56
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:48,187
It's so hot.

57
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:52,024
No, it's okay, it's always...
it always does this,

58
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:54,326
but I only had $1.50
and I'm going to run

59
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,229
out of time before
we finish the conversation.

60
00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:59,566
Nothing. I just...
I just want to talk to him.

61
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,434
I just turned my back on him.

62
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:04,437
Wouldn't talk to him.
Yeah, well, that's his issue.

63
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:06,673
He shouldn't...
He shouldn't have got married.

64
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,174
He shouldn't
have married her, Ma.

65
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,577
She's a bad influence on him.

66
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,110
If that's
not obvious to you now,

67
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:13,413
it will be in the future.

68
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:17,349
Well, I still love him,
Ma, but I don't...

69
00:18:17,382 --> 00:18:19,284
I have nothing
in common with David.

70
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:21,286
He was jealous of the fact
that I could do most

71
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,555
things better than he could.

72
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:24,122
It's a simple fact, Ma.

73
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:28,026
Well, yeah, he was better
socially than I was, but...

74
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:31,664
Well, if you hadn't put me
two years ahead in high school,

75
00:18:31,698 --> 00:18:34,199
perhaps I would have
the ability to... to hold

76
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:37,069
a conversation with a woman
longer than 30 seconds.

77
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:38,438
Two relationships in my life.

78
00:18:38,471 --> 00:18:41,073
Two. I only
got to first base, Ma.

79
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:42,341
You know what first base is?

80
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:44,109
Yeah, kissing, tongue rubbing.

81
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:48,247
Yeah.
I have tongue rubbed twice.

82
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,084
Twice. That's all. Nothing.
No... no touching of breasts.

83
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:53,486
No sexual intercourse.

84
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,053
Well,
who do you want me to tell?

85
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:56,321
Who should I tell this to, Ma?

86
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,526
Fuck, there's people...

87
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,829
There's people listening.

88
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:05,498
I just need to know if you're
going to send me money, Ma.

89
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:07,199
Please, I'm desperate.

90
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:09,702
All right,
please send me a check.

91
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:15,408
Oh, for the love of God,
is that a yes or no?

92
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,845
Thank you.

93
00:19:18,878 --> 00:19:20,480
And do not send...
no, do not send food

94
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:22,180
with the check,
just a check, Ma.

95
00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:23,816
I have to go.

96
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,585
The beeping... The phone...
It's the phone company, Ma.

97
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:27,487
It's the phone company.
I can't. I have to go.

158
00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:47,993
<i>but the difference is that
I am now able to strike back</i>

159
00:31:48,027 --> 00:31:49,795
<i>to a degree.</i>

160
00:31:50,863 --> 00:31:55,234
<i>True, I can't strike back
to anything like the extent</i>

161
00:31:55,267 --> 00:31:58,003
<i>I wish to, but I no longer
feel totally helpless,</i>

162
00:31:58,037 --> 00:32:01,307
<i>and the anger doesn't
gnaw my guts as it used to.</i>

163
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:06,579
<i>Guilty feelings? Yes, a little.</i>

164
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:10,450
<i>Occasionally, I have bad dreams
in which police are after me,</i>

165
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:13,285
<i>or which I am threatened
with punishment</i>

166
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:16,589
<i>from a supernatural source
such as the devil.</i>

167
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:21,193
<i>But these don't occur
often enough to be a problem.</i>

168
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:26,566
<i>I am definitely glad
to have done what I have.</i>

169
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,247
Here comes a tough one.

170
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,150
So, four numbers.

171
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:01,320
Keeping the seven
in the same place.

172
00:35:01,353 --> 00:35:03,055
Mm-hmm.

173
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:05,390
Create the greatest
and the smallest number

174
00:35:05,425 --> 00:35:07,694
in a combination
of those four digits.

175
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:09,562
I'm going to give you a hint.

176
00:35:09,596 --> 00:35:11,263
The zero, seven, five,
four is a three-digit number.

177
00:35:12,364 --> 00:35:13,600
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

178
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:16,235
Mm-hmm.

179
00:35:16,669 --> 00:35:18,538
Yeah, what's the greatest
and smallest number

180
00:35:18,571 --> 00:35:20,507
for those four digits?

181
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:27,614
Mm-hmm.

182
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,150
Nice. Remarkable.

183
00:35:34,353 --> 00:35:35,588
That's fantastic.

184
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:40,225
The smallest.
He's really coming along.

185
00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:41,794
He is really smart.

186
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:43,530
I think you've
probably done enough.

187
00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:46,633
Yeah. All this math
does give me a headache.

188
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:48,401
That's what we want.

189
00:36:27,874 --> 00:36:30,877
<i>In Montana,
if I went to the city to mail</i>

190
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,514
<i>a bomb to some big shot,
the driver would doubtless</i>

191
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:37,215
<i>remember
I rode the bus that day.</i>

192
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:40,787
<i>In the anonymity of the big
city, I figured it would be</i>

193
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,791
<i>much safer to buy materials
for a bomb and mail it.</i>

194
00:37:37,577 --> 00:37:39,144
I wanna fuck you.

195
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,914
I want to fuck you too, yeah.

196
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:51,658
Nice ass. Nice tits. Face, meh.

197
00:37:56,663 --> 00:37:58,698
I could end this bitch.

198
00:38:44,977 --> 00:38:46,412
What are you reading about?

199
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:49,615
The psychology of women.

200
00:38:49,649 --> 00:38:51,784
I'm reading, I have work to do.

201
00:38:51,818 --> 00:38:53,986
- I'm...
- Oh, yeah?

202
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,521
Mm-hmm.

203
00:38:55,555 --> 00:38:58,323
- What do you do?
- I'm a psychiatrist.

204
00:38:58,356 --> 00:39:00,325
- No shit.
- Yeah.

205
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:04,797
Please do not
tell me your troubles.

206
00:39:04,831 --> 00:39:07,299
Right.

207
00:39:09,569 --> 00:39:11,537
What do you...
what do you do for a living?

208
00:39:13,473 --> 00:39:16,308
I just got out of prison.
I gotta go get a job.

209
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:17,610
Sure.

210
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:29,422
Maybe I'll go
be a psychiatrist now.

211
00:39:32,725 --> 00:39:36,429
Um, excuse me,
I have to...

212
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:37,830
Hey.

213
00:39:37,864 --> 00:39:40,633
I have to get
the fuck out of here.

214
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:43,803
Have a good trip.

215
00:40:30,983 --> 00:40:34,420
Evening. I need a...

216
00:40:34,453 --> 00:40:35,788
room for one.

217
00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:40,860
- Name?
- It's Conrad. Joseph Conrad.

218
00:40:42,695 --> 00:40:46,364
- Um, how much?
- $19.95.

219
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:05,852
A nickel?

220
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,554
Change?

221
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:11,824
Call me if you need anything.

222
00:41:11,858 --> 00:41:13,092
Mm-hmm.

Watch this.
If I'm typing away...

255
00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:15,101
See, I made a mistake there.

256
00:45:15,134 --> 00:45:17,002
I typed "A"
when I wanted an "S,"

257
00:45:17,036 --> 00:45:18,971
so if I just hit this key twice,

<i>public interest

<i>But on the other hand,
most people will probably</i>

285
00:46:26,406 --> 00:46:28,475
<i>be repelled by my crime.</i>

286
00:46:28,508 --> 00:46:31,310
<i>The opponents of freedom may
use it as a weapon to support</i>

<i>their arguments for control
over human behavior.</i>

288
00:46:34,414 --> 00:46:37,049
<i>With no way of knowing
whether my action will do</i>

289

<i>more good than harm,

<i>an altruist
or to be acting for the good,</i>

291
00:46:43,389 --> 00:46:45,324
<i>whatever that is,
of the human race.</i>

292
00:46:45,357 --> 00:46:48,961
<i>I act merely for my
desire for revenge.</i>

293
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:07,746
So, how'd we do
tonight, huh?

294
00:47:10,783 --> 00:47:14,386
Oh, money, money, money, money.

295
00:47:14,421 --> 00:47:16,922
Heh heh! I love it!

296
00:47:20,326 --> 00:47:23,530
Nice cough. You all right?

00:47:23,563 --> 00:47:25,164
No.

298

Here's 40 for tonight,

else to drink, too, no charge.

302
00:47:40,212 --> 00:47:43,949
And I got some Old Spice

00:49:45,938 --> 00:49:48,073
<i>It's a vacant lot.
So, police are hoping</i>

315
00:49:48,107 --> 00:49:51,210
<i>for better luck with clues
the explosion left behind.</i>

316
00:49:51,243 --> 00:49:54,447
<i>Today, inside
Wood's home, investigators</i>

317
00:49:54,481 --> 00:49:56,281
<i>finished picking up
pieces of the bomb.</i>

318
00:49:56,315 --> 00:49:58,418
<i>That was nerve-wracking.</i>

319
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:00,252
<i>Metal fragments were scattered
throughout the kitchen and had</i>

320
00:50:00,285 --> 00:50:02,054
<i>to be separated
from bits of glass and paper.</i>

321
00:50:02,087 --> 00:50:04,123
<i>The evidence
recovered from the home</i>

322
00:50:04,156 --> 00:50:07,660
<i>of Mr. Hood... Mr. Wood was
in good condition and has been</i>

323
00:50:07,694 --> 00:50:09,629
<i>dispatched by courier to
the Postal Inspection</i>

324
00:50:09,662 --> 00:50:12,331
<i>Service Crime Laboratory
in Washington, DC.</i>

325
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,267
<i>The parcel wrapping,</i>

326
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,269
<i>the packing and portions
of the bomb itself</i>

327
00:50:17,302 --> 00:50:20,205
<i>will be analyzed by
the laboratory technicians</i>

328
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:23,142
<i>and they will
furnish us a full report.</i>

329
00:50:23,175 --> 00:50:25,210
<i>At this time, we are unable</i>

330
00:50:25,244 --> 00:50:28,113
<i>to release any details
on the make up of the bomb.</i>

331
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:31,718
<i>We have initiated
an intense investigation</i>

332
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:34,019
<i>to solve the attack
upon Mr. Wood.</i>

333
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:36,321
<i>Recently,
Percy Wood outfitted his home</i>

334
00:50:36,355 --> 00:50:38,691
<i>with an electronic
security system</i>

335
00:50:38,725 --> 00:50:40,259
<i>and he probably wouldn't
open the front door</i>

336
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:42,429
<i>if a stranger was outside.</i>

337
00:50:42,462 --> 00:50:44,497
<i>Like most of us,
though, he opens mail.</i>

338
00:50:44,531 --> 00:50:45,964
<i>Not knowing what's inside.</i>

339
00:50:45,998 --> 00:50:48,233
<i>"It will never happen to me,"</i>

340
00:50:48,267 --> 00:50:51,036
<i>is the way that
most people look at it.</i>

341
00:50:51,069 --> 00:50:54,072
<i>Yourself, how many times
have you opened your mail</i>

342
00:50:54,106 --> 00:50:56,975
<i>and thought that there might
have been something in it?</i>

343
00:51:11,758 --> 00:51:14,092
Ugh!

344
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:20,265
Yeah. Yeah.

345
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:37,617
<i>Helping hand.</i>

346
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:39,586
<i>You got a...</i>

347
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:42,387
<i>Yeah, I'm fucking angry
with the car, asshole.</i>

348
00:51:43,623 --> 00:51:45,625
<i>You wanna know
who told us my wife?</i>

349
00:51:45,658 --> 00:51:47,427
<i>Your goddamn brother.</i>

350
00:54:17,644 --> 00:54:20,312
<i>Dynamite blast all over him.</i>

351
00:54:21,648 --> 00:54:24,282
<i>Occasionally autumn at my cabin.</i>

352
00:54:25,618 --> 00:54:29,589
<i>Exxon conducting
seismic exploration for oil.</i>

353
00:54:36,361 --> 00:54:39,532
<i>Couple of helicopters
flying all over the hills.</i>

354
00:54:39,565 --> 00:54:41,701
<i>Lower, I think,
dynamite on cable.</i>

355
00:54:41,734 --> 00:54:43,736
<i>Make blast on ground,</i>

356
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:45,638
<i>instruments
smash through vibrations.</i>

357
00:54:51,611 --> 00:54:55,882
<i>I camped out mostly in
what I call the diagonal gulch,</i>

358
00:54:55,915 --> 00:55:00,252
<i>hoping to shoot up a helicopter
in an area east of Crater Mount.</i>

359
00:55:05,257 --> 00:55:07,359
<i>It proved harder than I thought.</i>

360
00:55:07,392 --> 00:55:09,562
<i>Those helicopters
always in motion,</i>

361
00:55:09,595 --> 00:55:11,864
<i>never know
where they would go next.</i>

362
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:26,646
Cocksuckers!

363
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:53,506
Fuck.

364
00:55:56,709 --> 00:55:58,644
<i>Desecration.</i>

365
00:55:58,678 --> 00:56:01,547
<i>Where can I go now
for peace and quiet?</i>

366
00:56:07,487 --> 00:56:09,822
<i>When I got
back to camp, I cried.</i>

367
00:56:09,856 --> 00:56:11,924
<i>Partly from
frustration of missing,</i>

368
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:14,594
<i>but mostly grief about what
was happening to the country.</i>

369
00:56:14,627 --> 00:56:16,462
Fuck!

370
00:56:16,496 --> 00:56:18,363
Fuck you!

371
00:56:18,396 --> 00:56:20,833
<i>It is so beautiful.</i>

372
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:24,771
<i>But if they did find oil...
disaster.</i>

373
00:56:24,804 --> 00:56:28,608
<i>Even if not find oil, the blast
and helicopters ruin it.</i>

374
00:57:25,798 --> 00:57:27,834
Ted Kaczynksi
reporting for duty.

375
00:57:27,867 --> 00:57:29,569
Hey, there, Ted.

376
00:57:29,602 --> 00:57:31,838
- Hello, Mrs. Hill.
- I'm so glad you're here.

377
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:33,873
- You ready to work?
- Yes. What can I do?

378
00:57:33,906 --> 00:57:35,575
Let's head back this way.

379
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:40,012
I'm gonna put you
in the back with Becky,

380
00:57:40,046 --> 00:57:42,415
and we have
this huge pile of books

381
00:57:42,448 --> 00:57:44,016
that we have to sort through.

382
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:46,919
Unfortunately, we have
to get rid of all of them.

383
00:57:46,953 --> 00:57:50,923
So I'm gonna have you guys
split them up by genre and...

384
00:58:28,494 --> 00:58:30,129
- Hi.
- Hi.

385
00:58:30,162 --> 00:58:31,964
I'm Becky.

386
00:58:31,998 --> 00:58:35,468
I'm... I'm Ted Kaczynksi.

387
00:58:44,744 --> 00:58:48,180
They should really move
from the Dewey Decimal System

388
00:58:48,214 --> 00:58:51,684
to the Library
of Congress system.

389
00:58:52,618 --> 00:58:56,689
I'd suggested it a while back,
but they still haven't, so,

390
00:58:56,722 --> 00:58:59,458
now we have
to do all this again.

391
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:13,039
Um...

392
00:59:26,619 --> 00:59:27,887
No, we're...

393
01:00:02,922 --> 01:00:04,623
Fuck.

394
01:00:15,234 --> 01:00:17,937
Ugh. Goddamn it.

395
01:00:36,222 --> 01:00:38,257
Hi, David, it's me. Yeah.

396
01:00:40,993 --> 01:00:42,862
Yeah, because I was...

397
01:00:42,895 --> 01:00:46,699
I was calling to talk to you
and she picked up. And I...

398
01:00:46,732 --> 01:00:49,168
Well, I thought... I...

399
01:00:49,201 --> 01:00:50,770
I wanted to speak
to you, not her.

400
01:00:50,803 --> 01:00:52,271
I've never met her.
I thought it was

401
01:00:52,304 --> 01:00:54,273
a bad time to try
to meet her over the phone.

402
01:00:54,306 --> 01:00:56,308
And so I... so I hung up.

403
01:00:56,342 --> 01:00:59,578
Well, can I be trusted to say

404
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:01,313
the right thing to...
to a woman, David?

405
01:01:01,347 --> 01:01:04,617
Especially Linda,
with the history, and...

406
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:06,652
Oh my God, is that her
in the background?

407
01:01:06,685 --> 01:01:07,920
David, fuck.

408
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:15,094
Just tell her I apologize
and ask her to leave the room

409
01:01:15,127 --> 01:01:17,096
so I can talk to you
in private, please.

410
01:01:17,129 --> 01:01:19,031
You domesticated yourself.

411
01:01:19,065 --> 01:01:21,634
You're like, like,
like a horse that's run

412
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:24,236
into a farmer's field and...

413
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:26,172
and volunteered for somebody
to jump on your back

414
01:01:26,205 --> 01:01:28,307
and put a bit in your mouth.

415
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:31,777
Well, I thought that
we shared a lot of values

416
01:01:31,811 --> 01:01:33,746
and I thought that we were on

417
01:01:33,779 --> 01:01:35,781
the same page of
living in the wild.

418
01:01:35,815 --> 01:01:39,718
Now you're living in a zoo like
a caged animal with a trainer.

419
01:01:39,752 --> 01:01:42,354
A trainer who, uh,

420
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:45,991
who you need
to run everything by. Um...

421
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:49,095
I'm sure...
oh, I bet you have too.

422
01:01:49,128 --> 01:01:50,796
Like if I...
if I asked you... I was...

423
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:52,164
I was actually gonna call to ask

424
01:01:52,198 --> 01:01:54,333
for some help,
some financial help.

425
01:01:54,366 --> 01:01:56,102
I just wanted
a little money that I could...

426
01:01:56,135 --> 01:01:58,804
that I could repay.
But I'm sure you have...

427
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:00,372
Yeah, you would have...

428
01:02:00,407 --> 01:02:02,409
Yes, you would have to ask her,
wouldn't you?

429
01:02:02,442 --> 01:02:04,243
Mm-hmm.

430
01:02:04,276 --> 01:02:06,212
See, that's what I mean.

431
01:05:17,002 --> 01:05:18,270
Hey!

432
01:05:39,925 --> 01:05:41,860
Get off my land!

433
01:05:41,894 --> 01:05:43,395
Get off my property.

434
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,351
Ted!

435
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:42,321
Man in the cabin.

436
01:06:43,456 --> 01:06:44,890
Ted.

437
01:07:03,308 --> 01:07:06,912
- Good morning.
- Morning. Nice day.

438
01:07:07,747 --> 01:07:09,314
Yeah.

439
01:07:09,348 --> 01:07:11,116
You know, just checking
through the pass

440
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:12,719
and a little investigation

441
01:07:12,752 --> 01:07:14,687
I was hoping
you could help me with.

442
01:07:14,721 --> 01:07:16,623
You seen anyone, anything,

443
01:07:16,656 --> 01:07:19,358
people, fooling around
with any buildings around here?

444
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:21,628
No, only those, uh...

445
01:07:21,661 --> 01:07:24,664
kids who vandalized
that cabin a while back.

446
01:07:24,697 --> 01:07:26,165
Nothing since then.

447
01:07:26,533 --> 01:07:28,668
- Sure,
- You talk to Steve or Tom?

448
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:31,571
Yeah, Steve said his mill
got wrecked a while back too.

449
01:07:31,604 --> 01:07:34,173
Yeah, a while ago. Yeah.

450
01:07:34,206 --> 01:07:37,242
Or, um, motorcyclers,
they hassling you nearby here?

451
01:07:37,276 --> 01:07:40,045
No, nothing like
snowmobile season, anyway, huh?

452
01:07:40,078 --> 01:07:42,515
Exactly. Right, um...

453
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:44,517
The reason I had to ask
was we heard you got

454
01:07:44,551 --> 01:07:47,052
pretty upset with some riders
from up the creek.

455
01:07:47,085 --> 01:07:49,388
Yeah, I did. I did, yeah.

456
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:53,593
Yes, assholes, though.
A couple of punks tried to...

457
01:07:53,626 --> 01:07:58,130
tried to come across my...
my property and, um...

458
01:07:58,163 --> 01:07:59,398
Yeah.

459
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,503
I wouldn't call it anything
out of the ordinary, though,

460
01:08:03,536 --> 01:08:07,507
I imagine if you were
in my position, you would...

461
01:08:09,809 --> 01:08:11,544
You might act the same way.

462
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:19,218
Sure. Yeah, that's fair.

463
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:21,186
I appreciate your time.
If you, uh, hear of anything

464
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:22,622
you let me know.

465
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,089
Mm-hm.

466
01:08:53,218 --> 01:08:55,455
- Have a nice day.
- See you, Ted.

467
01:09:18,343 --> 01:09:21,113
<i>I don't want to
let them get their offer,</i>

468
01:09:21,146 --> 01:09:23,816
<i>because they don't have
credibility with us.</i>

469
01:09:24,751 --> 01:09:27,620
<i>Some think Earth First

623
01:23:52,284 --> 01:23:56,355
<i>of them are mailed,
letter bombs or package bombs.</i>

624
01:23:56,388 --> 01:23:58,525
<i>And about half of them
have been placed</i>

625
01:23:58,558 --> 01:24:01,528
<i>in a position
where someone would, uh,</i>

626
01:24:01,561 --> 01:24:04,163
<i>disturb the package.</i>

627
01:24:11,036 --> 01:24:14,507
<i>Well, as long as I'm going
to throw everything away anyway,</i>

628
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:18,210
<i>instead of having to shoot it
out with the cops or something,</i>

629
01:24:18,243 --> 01:24:21,280
<i>I will go up to Canada,
and take off into the woods</i>

630
01:24:21,313 --> 01:24:24,149
<i>with a rifle
and try to live off the country.</i>

631
01:24:24,183 --> 01:24:25,618
<i>If that doesn't work out</i>

632
01:24:25,652 --> 01:24:27,587
<i>and if I can
get back to civilization</i>

633
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:30,088
<i>before I starve,
then I will come back here</i>

634
01:24:30,122 --> 01:24:32,692
<i>and kill someone I hate.</i>

635
01:24:37,564 --> 01:24:40,299
I need to renew my passport.

636
01:24:41,233 --> 01:24:42,602
And...

637
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:32,184
<i>Clearly, we are in a position</i>

638
01:25:32,217 --> 01:25:34,219
<i>to do a great deal of damage.</i>

639
01:25:34,253 --> 01:25:35,688
<i>And it doesn't appear
that the FBI</i>

640
01:25:35,722 --> 01:25:38,123
<i>is gonna catch
us anytime soon.</i>

641
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:42,762
<i>The FBI is a joke.</i>

642
01:25:58,176 --> 01:26:02,114
<i>FBI, suck my cock.</i>

643
01:26:43,355 --> 01:26:45,525
- Morning.
- Uh, morning.

644
01:26:46,559 --> 01:26:50,863
I have a complaint about
the Montana Telephone Company.

645
01:26:50,897 --> 01:26:54,834
It concerns, uh, some of your
payphones in Lincoln, Montana.

646
01:26:54,867 --> 01:26:58,638
These pay phones consistently
malfunction in such a manner

647
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:01,541
as to steal a caller's quarters.

648
01:27:01,574 --> 01:27:03,810
You put a quarter in and then
it either gets jammed

649
01:27:03,843 --> 01:27:05,712
or it doesn't register.

650
01:27:05,745 --> 01:27:07,379
And then the coin release
doesn't work

651
01:27:07,413 --> 01:27:09,314
so that either you can't
put the call through

652
01:27:09,348 --> 01:27:11,818
and the quarters are lost,
or the call does go through,

653
01:27:11,851 --> 01:27:14,319
but you end up paying 25 cents
or 50 cents more

654
01:27:14,353 --> 01:27:15,588
than the price of the call.

655
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:19,157
This problem has persisted
for several years.

656
01:27:22,294 --> 01:27:24,597
This is not the first time
that I have, uh...

657
01:27:24,631 --> 01:27:26,899
that I have complained,
although it is the first time

658
01:27:26,933 --> 01:27:28,568
that I've complained in person,

659
01:27:28,601 --> 01:27:30,436
but I've spoken to
the operators about it

660
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:32,672
several times and nothing
has been done over the years.

661
01:27:33,506 --> 01:27:35,942
The main offender
is actually the payphone

662
01:27:35,975 --> 01:27:38,544
on the corner of Highway 200
and Stemple Pass.

663
01:27:38,578 --> 01:27:40,680
I'm forced to use that one
on occasion because

664
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:42,347
it's the only one
that the company provides

665
01:27:42,381 --> 01:27:44,951
that offers any level
of privacy at all.

666
01:27:44,984 --> 01:27:47,687
But it steals at least
50% of my quarters.

667
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,354
It swindles me.

668
01:27:49,388 --> 01:27:51,724
And the company is aware
of this offending booth.

669
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:54,326
That's a criminal act.

670
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:55,928
My money is being stolen.

671
01:27:58,531 --> 01:28:00,265
On behalf
of the Montana phone company,

672
01:28:00,298 --> 01:28:03,436
I apologize
for your inconvenience.

673
01:28:03,469 --> 01:28:05,638
Uh, do you happen
to have a record

674
01:28:05,672 --> 01:28:07,473
of how much money
you've lost over the years?

675
01:28:07,507 --> 01:28:09,809
I do. $5.75.

676
01:28:09,842 --> 01:28:13,446
- $5.75?
- Yes. Yes, this year.

677
01:28:13,479 --> 01:28:14,714
- This year.
- Yes.

678
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:16,516
Hmm.

679
01:28:16,549 --> 01:28:19,652
I have a letter
which, uh, you could give

680
01:28:19,686 --> 01:28:23,556
to your superiors,
and it contains all the details

681
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:26,459
that I have
just relayed to you now.

682
01:28:26,492 --> 01:28:29,595
I would love to give
it to my superiors, but...

683
01:28:29,629 --> 01:28:32,832
we can only accept letters
through the post.

684
01:28:33,866 --> 01:28:35,768
I can't hand-deliver a letter.

685
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:38,438
Do you see the problem?

686
01:28:45,044 --> 01:28:48,581
I came in here to bring
you the letter in person.

687
01:28:48,614 --> 01:28:49,849
I appreciate that.

688
01:28:51,383 --> 01:28:52,719
But I can't take it.

689
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:15,742
You have a wonderful day.

690
01:29:15,775 --> 01:29:17,944
I'm gonna write to
my congressman about this.

691
01:29:17,977 --> 01:29:19,645
Okay.

692
01:30:16,068 --> 01:30:18,004
<i>During my romantic phase,</i>

693
01:30:18,037 --> 01:30:21,641
<i>I continued to have fantasies
of a primitive life,</i>

694
01:30:21,674 --> 01:30:23,709
<i>but I tended strongly
to embellish</i>

695
01:30:23,743 --> 01:30:28,447
<i>this with romantic details
like horns resounding through</i>

696
01:30:28,481 --> 01:30:31,617
<i>the forest, savage-looking
tunics and bearskin</i>

697
01:30:31,651 --> 01:30:32,885
<i>and so forth.</i>

698
01:31:24,537 --> 01:31:27,773
Sequence of small advances,
there will be no rational

699
01:31:27,807 --> 01:31:30,076
and effective public resistance.

700
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:33,412
It is not possible to make
a lasting compromise

701
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:35,681
between technology and freedom

702
01:31:35,715 --> 01:31:38,684
because technology is by far
the more powerful social force

703
01:31:38,718 --> 01:31:40,453
and continually...

704
01:31:40,486 --> 01:31:43,890
erodes on freedom
through repeated compromise.

705
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:04,810
<i>As society
and the problems that face it</i>

706
01:32:04,844 --> 01:32:06,746
<i>become more and more complex,</i>

707
01:32:06,779 --> 01:32:09,782
<i>and as machines become
more and more intelligent,</i>

708
01:32:09,815 --> 01:32:12,652
<i>people will let machines
make more and more</i>

709
01:32:12,685 --> 01:32:14,620
<i>of their decisions for them,</i>

710
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:16,822
<i>simply because
machine-made decisions</i>

711
01:32:16,856 --> 01:32:20,126
<i>will bring better results
than manmade ones.</i>

712
01:32:22,895 --> 01:32:24,931
<i>Eventually,
a stage may be reached</i>

713
01:32:24,964 --> 01:32:27,133
<i>at which the decisions
necessary to keep</i>

714
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:29,802
<i>the system running will be
so complex that human beings</i>

715
01:32:29,835 --> 01:32:32,872
<i>will be incapable
of making them intelligently.</i>

716
01:32:32,905 --> 01:32:36,142
<i>At that stage, the machines
will be in effective control.</i>

717
01:32:36,175 --> 01:32:38,911
<i>People won't be able
to just turn the machines</i>

718
01:32:38,945 --> 01:32:40,947
<i>off because they will
be so dependent on them</i>

719
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:43,482
<i>that turning them
off would amount to suicide.</i>

720
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:22,121
I must have been going
40 fucking miles per hour.

721
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:06,699
You know, my parents...

722
01:34:06,732 --> 01:34:10,669
pushed me so hard in academia,
I never really learned

723
01:34:10,703 --> 01:34:13,072
to be at ease around women.

724
01:34:13,105 --> 01:34:14,974
Can you tell me your heart, Ted?

725
01:34:16,142 --> 01:34:17,810
You're quite right.

726
01:34:17,843 --> 01:34:19,078
You love me.

727
01:34:19,712 --> 01:34:20,946
I do.

728
01:34:21,981 --> 01:34:24,750
I do. See, actually, uh...

729
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,685
It's the truth. I love you.

730
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,055
I love you so much I'm gonna
let go of these handlebars.

731
01:34:29,088 --> 01:34:31,190
- No, don't do it!
- I'm gonna let go!

732
01:34:31,223 --> 01:34:33,025
- No, please don't.
- Okay, one hand.

733
01:34:33,059 --> 01:34:34,693
Just one hand, okay?

734
01:34:34,727 --> 01:34:36,695
Come on, there you go,
there you go!

735
01:34:37,396 --> 01:34:39,598
- Put it down!
- Okay, okay.

736
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:41,801
Oh, the right hand come off!
You're my right hand.

737
01:34:41,834 --> 01:34:44,036
You might have to be
the right hand of a man.

738
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:46,005
Okay, okay.

739
01:35:16,102 --> 01:35:20,072
<i>We are an anarchist group...</i>

740
01:35:20,106 --> 01:35:24,710
...calling ourselves...

741
01:35:24,743 --> 01:35:27,313
- <i>Calling ourselves FC.</i>
- ...FC.

742
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:30,950
<i>Notice that the postmark
on this envelope</i>

743
01:35:30,983 --> 01:35:32,918
<i>precedes a newsworthy event</i>

744
01:35:32,952 --> 01:35:36,722
<i>that will happen about the time
you receive this letter,</i>

745
01:35:36,755 --> 01:35:38,824
<i>if nothing goes wrong.</i>

746
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:44,263
We are getting tired

747
01:35:44,296 --> 01:35:48,901
of making bombs.

748
01:35:51,438 --> 01:35:55,007
<i>It's no fun having to spend
all your evenings and weekends</i>

749
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,942
<i>preparing dangerous mixtures,</i>

750
01:35:56,976 --> 01:35:59,778
<i>filing trigger mechanisms
out of scraps of metal</i>

751
01:35:59,812 --> 01:36:01,680
<i>or searching the Sierras

752
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:03,749
<i>isolated enough

753
01:36:05,985 --> 01:36:07,953
<i>So we offer a bargain.</i>

754
01:36:08,988 --> 01:36:11,957
<i>We have a long article
between 29,000</i>

755
01:36:11,991 --> 01:36:15,361
<i>and 37,000 words
that we want to have published.</i>

756
01:36:15,394 --> 01:36:19,165
<i>If you can get it published
according to our requirements,</i>

757
01:36:19,198 --> 01:36:22,968
<i>we will permanently desist
from terrorist activities.</i>

758
01:36:23,002 --> 01:36:25,037
<i>If the answer is satisfactory,</i>

759
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:27,440
<i>we will finish typing

760
01:36:27,474 --> 01:36:30,142
<i>it to you. If the answer
is unsatisfactory,</i>

761
01:36:30,176 --> 01:36:32,178
<i>we will start building
our next bomb.</i>

762
01:36:36,782 --> 01:36:38,017
<i>FC.</i>

763
01:37:42,248 --> 01:37:45,184
I am choked with frustration
at my inability to get

764
01:37:45,217 --> 01:37:48,354
my stinking fucking family
off my back once and for all.

765
01:37:49,121 --> 01:37:50,923
No, it does include you, David.

766
01:37:50,956 --> 01:37:52,258
It emphatically
and specifically

767
01:37:52,291 --> 01:37:54,226
includes you, yeah.

768
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:57,029
Of course, you... you're part
of my stinking fucking family.

769
01:37:57,062 --> 01:37:59,398
It's not an emotional decision.
It's a logical decision, David.

770
01:37:59,432 --> 01:38:02,034
It's logical.
Yeah, I have my own life.

771
01:38:02,067 --> 01:38:04,303
I have my own life, David,
I think my own thoughts

772
01:38:04,336 --> 01:38:06,406
and then I do what
I think I should do,

773
01:38:06,439 --> 01:38:07,940
as opposed to
what other people...

774
01:38:07,973 --> 01:38:09,275
Look, I'm not... I'm not...

775
01:38:09,308 --> 01:38:11,210
I'm not gonna do this again.

776
01:38:11,243 --> 01:38:13,879
I'm not gonna do this again
with you, David. All right?

777
01:38:13,912 --> 01:38:16,215
I do not want to hear
from you or any member

778
01:38:16,248 --> 01:38:19,519

fucking family ever again.

779
01:38:20,185 --> 01:38:21,387
Goodbye.

780
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:44,343
Hi.

781
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:45,811
Yeah, yeah.

782
01:39:07,534 --> 01:39:11,438
<i>This is CNN breaking news.</i>

783
01:39:11,471 --> 01:39:13,506
<i>Hello from CNN News Center
in Atlanta,</i>

784
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:16,141
<i>I'm Natalie Allen.
We're about to take live</i>

785
01:39:16,175 --> 01:39:18,143
<i>a news conference
from San Francisco</i>

786
01:39:18,177 --> 01:39:21,046
<i>headed up by the FBI today
concerning the bomb threat</i>

787
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,082
<i>that has come in.
The person behind the threat</i>

788
01:39:23,115 --> 01:39:25,317
<i>may be the so-called Unabomber,</i>

789
01:39:25,351 --> 01:39:27,953
<i>and the threat has resulted
in heightened security</i>

790
01:39:27,986 --> 01:39:30,356
<i>at five airports in...</i>

791
01:39:30,389 --> 01:39:33,626
<i>Small debris,
big debris, dust...</i>

792
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:36,362
<i>I'm relieved to
see a lot of security around...</i>

793
01:39:36,395 --> 01:39:38,431
<i>...and determination?</i>

794
01:39:38,465 --> 01:39:40,933
<i>Well, our position is we will
keep the security measures</i>

795
01:39:40,966 --> 01:39:43,536
<i>in place until
the matter is resolved.</i>

796
01:39:43,570 --> 01:39:45,371
<i>It's been more
than five days since</i>

797
01:39:45,405 --> 01:39:47,940
<i>the Unabomber threatened
to blow up an airliner</i>

798
01:39:47,973 --> 01:39:51,310
<i>flying in or out
of Los Angeles by July 4th.</i>

799
01:39:51,343 --> 01:39:55,247
<i>But after 17 years,
23 injuries and three deaths,</i>

800
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,217
<i>a Unabomber
is nothing to joke about.</i>

801
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:01,186
<i>Experts say the Unabomber
is stepping up his activities</i>

802
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:03,122
<i>because he's jealous
of the attention given</i>

803
01:40:03,155 --> 01:40:05,124
<i>to the Oklahoma City bombing</i>

804
01:40:05,157 --> 01:40:06,626
<i>which stole the thunder</i>

805
01:40:06,659 --> 01:40:08,327
<i>from his last
package bomb explosion.</i>

806
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,463
<i>Experts also believe
the Unabomber</i>

807
01:40:10,497 --> 01:40:12,465
<i>may be headed for a fall.</i>

808
01:40:12,499 --> 01:40:14,634
<i>I think he's on a high now.</i>

809
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:16,935
<i>I think he's all pumped up.</i>

810
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:19,338
<i>I think he's intoxicated
with his own power,</i>

811
01:40:19,371 --> 01:40:22,241
<i>and I think at this point,
he's most vulnerable.</i>

812
01:40:24,276 --> 01:40:26,413
<i>I think he might
have made some major mistakes.</i>

813
01:41:02,415 --> 01:41:04,484
<i>The FBI is unable to catch him,</i>

814
01:41:04,517 --> 01:41:06,985
<i>and now the Unabomber
has raised the stakes again.</i>

815
01:41:07,019 --> 01:41:09,221
<i>In the letter sent
to The Washington Post</i>

816
01:41:09,254 --> 01:41:11,390
<i>and the New York Times this
week, the Unabomber has pledged</i>

817
01:41:11,424 --> 01:41:13,526
<i>to stop his murderous spree
if these leading American papers</i>

818
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,994
<i>will publish
a 35,000 word manifesto.</i>

819
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:18,997
<i>In the document the Unabomber
condemns modern technology</i>

820
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:21,066
<i>and says computers have
created a world in which humans</i>

821
01:41:21,099 --> 01:41:24,102
<i>are mere cogs in the machine.
That proposal has led to a life</i>

822
01:41:24,136 --> 01:41:26,539
<i>or death question
for The Post and Times:</i>

823
01:41:26,573 --> 01:41:29,007
<i>should they cave in to threats
and publish, or refuse</i>

824
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:30,743
<i>to let themselves be
used as a platform...</i>

825
01:41:30,777 --> 01:41:34,514
In paragraph 125,
we use an analogy of a weak

826
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:38,183
neighbor who was left destitute
by a strong neighbor who takes

827
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:41,754
all his land by forcing on
him a series of compromises.

828
01:41:41,788 --> 01:41:45,492
But suppose now that
the strong neighbor gets sick

829
01:41:45,525 --> 01:41:48,060
so that he is unable
to defend himself.

830
01:41:48,093 --> 01:41:50,730
The weak neighbor
can force the strong one

831
01:41:50,763 --> 01:41:53,500
to give him his land back
or he can kill him.

832
01:41:53,533 --> 01:41:56,636
If he lets the strong man
survive and only forces him

833
01:41:56,669 --> 01:41:59,071
to give his land back,
he is a fool,

834
01:41:59,104 --> 01:42:02,040
because when the strong man gets
well, he will again take all

835
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:04,042
the land for himself.

836
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:06,311
The only sensible alternative
for the weaker man is to kill

837
01:42:06,345 --> 01:42:09,516
a strong one while he has
the chance. In the same way,

838
01:42:09,549 --> 01:42:11,484
While the industrial
system is sick,

839
01:42:11,518 --> 01:42:14,687
we must destroy it.
If we compromise with it

840
01:42:14,721 --> 01:42:16,489
and let it recover
from its sickness,

841
01:42:16,523 --> 01:42:18,424
it will eventually wipe
out all of our freedom.

842

<i>other traffic, stopping off to
the right.</i>

849
01:42:57,296 --> 01:42:59,231
Hey, Gilbert,
you should take this,

850
01:42:59,264 --> 01:43:01,300
- even though it isn't for you.
- Maybe it's a bomb.

851
01:43:01,333 --> 01:43:02,869
You should send
that off to Bill.

852
01:43:02,902 --> 01:43:04,604
Maybe it's a love letter.

864

01:56:31,043 --> 01:56:32,545
Get your fucking hands off me!

927
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:35,948
Get your fucking
hands off of me!

928
01:56:35,981 --> 01:56:38,350
Get your fucking
hands off of me!

929
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:42,622
Mr. Kaczynski, we are the FBI.

930
01:56:42,655 --> 01:56:45,625
We have a warrant
to search your cabin.

931
01:56:50,195 --> 01:56:52,331
Okay. Okay.

932
01:56:52,364 --> 01:56:54,066
Yeah.

933
01:57:03,308 --> 01:57:04,577
Got him!

934
01:58:09,809 --> 01:58:11,711
<i>... we're told
by federal law enforcement</i>

935
01:58:11,744 --> 01:58:15,380
<i>officials is that they received
a tip on this person indirectly</i>

936
01:58:15,415 --> 01:58:17,450
<i>from a family member.</i>

937
01:58:17,484 --> 01:58:20,319
<i>This man's brother contacted
a prominent Washington D.C.</i>

938
01:58:20,352 --> 01:58:23,388
<i>Lawyer, who in turn
got in touch with the FBI</i>

939
01:58:23,423 --> 01:58:25,458
<i>and told them about this person,
and they've had him under</i>

940
01:58:25,492 --> 01:58:28,227
<i>surveillance now for about
a week or so, we're told.</i>

941
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:31,063
<i>They are preparing right now
to serve a search warrant,</i>

942
01:58:31,096 --> 01:58:33,533
<i>or probably in the process
of serving it now.</i>

943
01:58:33,566 --> 01:58:36,168
<i>We don't know whether this
person is at home,</i>

944
01:58:36,201 --> 01:58:38,136
<i>or what they expect
to find there.</i>

945
01:58:38,170 --> 01:58:39,806
<i>If they're just going to
find evidence that they would</i>

946
01:58:39,839 --> 01:58:41,741
<i>take from the house,
possible evidence,</i>

947
01:58:41,774 --> 01:58:43,743
<i>or whether they're actually
going to find something.</i>

948
01:58:43,776 --> 01:58:45,612
<i>We don't know whether there's
been any arrest yet...</i>
