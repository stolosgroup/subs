Yes!

Then, let's try writing down

DECEMBER 7TH

18
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,410
Go slow along the direction of the fur.

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,560
You're getting pretty good at this,
Makinohara.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,120
Thanks.

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,580
But, I'm sorry...

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,300
I said I wanted to adopt Hayate,
but haven't gotten around to telling my parents yet.

23
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,380
Are your parents strict?

24
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,760
They are very kind.

25
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,680
If I said I wanted to raise a cat,
I'm sure they wouldn't object.

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,100
That's why I can't bring myself to ask.

27
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,110
I'm sorry. Doesn't make much sense, does it?

28
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,740
DECEMBER 8TH

29
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,780
It's been a while
since Shoko was here, hasn't it?

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,870
Yeah.

31
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,200
But she said she might not be able
to come by again for a while.

32
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,580
Maybe she's going somewhere
for the holidays?

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,470
What are your plans, Mai-san?

34
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,920
It's not set in stone yet,
though I do have New Year's Day off.

35
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,940
But there's Christmas before that.

36
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,440
It'd be nice if we can eat a cake together.

37
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,380
You should spend this year with Kaede.

38
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,470
Christmas with my little sister?

39
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,220
If you do, I'll give you a present.

40
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,270
An erotic present?

41
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,480
Ow-ow-ow!

42
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,090
What's wrong, Sakuta?
You're grinning so much.

43
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,680
Must be Sakurajima-senpai stepping
on his foot or something.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,950
Want me to step on your foot, too?

45
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,670
It's not like I'm grinning because Mai-san
stepped on my foot or anything.

46
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,210
Azusagawa, you really are such a rascal.

47
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,830
You're bringing out the kotatsu.

48
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,500
Since we're eating hot pot.

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,660
It's not the same without a kotatsu, right?

50
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,840
Sakuta, help me out a bit over here.

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,520
Sure.

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,730
Who could that be?

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,400
Good evening, it's me!

54
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,980
Shoko-san!?

55
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,300
Sorry to suddenly come by so late.
I was wondering if I could stay for the night.

56
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,700
B-Big Brother...

57
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,410
What's the meaning of this, Sakuta?

58
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,530
C-Calm down, Mai-san.

59
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,700
I am calm. But what's going on?

60
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,700
I don't know. I'm the one that wants to ask.

61
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,630
Then we'll just have to ask Shoko-san directly.

62
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,640
Wait, Mai-san! Knife, not with the knife!

63
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,060
Oh, that was so good!

64
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,820
I'm really sorry,
but thanks for treating me dinner, too.

65
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,600
I'll make the meals starting tomorrow.

66
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,180
Wait, "starting tomorrow"?

67
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,760
Your stay isn't just for tonight, then?

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,530
I have nowhere else I can go.

69
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,990
How long do you plan on staying?

70
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,680
Forever, if I could.

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,540
Forever!?

72
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,540
Thanks for the meal.

73
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,460
Well, please make yourselves at home.

74
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,590
First of all, who exactly are you?

75
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,130
How are you related to
the middle-school Shoko?

76
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,700
They're both me, Shoko Makinohara.

77
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,310
I suddenly grow older every once in a while.

78
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,500
As I said, I suddenly grow older
every once in a while.

79
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,980
Is that puberty syndrome as well?

80
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,550
Seems that way.
I can't go home looking like this, you see.

81
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,240
So I have no place I can go.

82
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,990
If that's the case,
please stay over at my place.

83
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,650
I couldn't trouble you, Mai-san.

84
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,610
But it's all right for you to trouble Sakuta?

85
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,700
Sakuta-kun, are you troubled?

86
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,380
Eh? No, I'm not troubled,
but it's more like...

87
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,100
If you're satisfied with
your relationship with Mai-san,

88
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,920
you won't have any
weird feelings for me, right?

89
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,430
You are satisfied, aren't you?

90
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,760
Y-Yes, of course.

91
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,890
Then, there's no problem
if I stay here for a little while.

92
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,160
Regardless, a no is a no.

93
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,230
What's fine is fine.

94
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,230
No way.

95
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,530
Besides, there wouldn't be a problem
even if something happens.

96
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,690
I am rather fond of Sakuta-kun myself.

97
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,660
Oh my, you're so messy.

98
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,620
Now, now. Are you all right?

99
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,460
Very well. If you insist on doing this,
then I will stay here as well.

100
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,450
W-Wait a minute, Mai-san!

101
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,130
Hold on. Time out. Calm down.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,010
Please help me...

103
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,210
What?

104
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,410
I met Shoko-san again.

105
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,160
You want tips on how to cheat?

106
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,300
Shoko-san is at my place right now.
Mai-san is there, too.

107
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,600
Don't rope me into the middle of a bloodbath.

108
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,190
DECEMBER 9TH

109
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,650
Sakuta, get up already.

110
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,490
Come on, wake up.

111
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,440
I can't wake up
without my good morning kiss.

112
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,510
Oh, fine.

113
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,240
Then I'll go to school by myself.

114
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,060
Then, I'll be in charge
of the good morning kiss.

115
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,000
You can't.

116
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,660
After the discussion last night,
you allowed us to live together.

117
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,050
I didn't allow it!

118
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,730
Why not just two-time them,
and upgrade from a rascal into a sleazeball?

119
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,810
Stop with the preposterous nonsense.

120
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,600
So is that book interesting?

121
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,390
It's interesting.

122
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:23,900
YOU'LL DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND!
FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS
UNWINDING THE SUPERSTRING THEORY

123
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,840
"Superstring theory."

124
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,900
Is that some theory
where Mai-san has me on a string?

125
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,940
That's a different string theory.

126
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,780
It's not even a theory.

127
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,120
Senpai, your eyes look dead as usual.

128
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,570
Well, yeah...

129
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,200
Oh, you're going home already?

130
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,580
I'm accompanying my sister
to the hospital for her check-up.

131
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,890
Well, I'll be going now.

132
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,590
Yeah. I'll be over at the waiting room.

133
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,420
Makinohara?

134
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,230
Th-This is, um...

135
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,690
I wonder if it's about time
he runs into my younger self now.

136
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,520
Well, actually, I've always had poor health,

137
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,450
and I've been hospitalized
many times since elementary school.

138
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,100
I see.

139
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,830
That's why it was hard for me
to ask my parents about Hayate.

140
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,800
Due to my condition, they always
say "okay" to anything I ask of them.

141
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,010
I'm really happy they do,
but at the same time it's hard on me.

142
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,770
Somehow, it makes me feel bad.

143
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,310
I'm sure your parents know you feel that way.

144
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,220
Makinohara, how do you feel
about your father and mother?

145
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,980
I love them, of course.

146
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,780
Have you ever told them that?

147
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,830
I haven't.

148
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,160
I'd be a whole lot happier to hear
"I like you," instead of "I'm sorry" from someone.

149
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,130
I'd be up in the clouds
if someone told me "I love you."

150
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,330
Someone once told me
that her three favorite phrases

151
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,170
were "Thank you," "You did your best,"
and "I love you."

152
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,970
So, I think you can let your parents
spoil you some more.

153
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,810
I...

154
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,380
She said she'll come pick up Hayate
once she's out of the hospital.

155
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,570
That's great news.

156
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,390
While I was talking to
middle-school Makinohara in the hospital,

157
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,740
did you exist by yourself
in this room, Shoko-san?

158
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,280
Who knows?

159
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,370
Nobody observed me,
so you could say it's an uncertainty.

160
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,590
I guess you could say
I was Schrodinger's Shoko-san?

161
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,050
Does your puberty syndrome
have something to do with your illness?

162
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,260
Let's see... Probably.

163
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,220
I have a heart disease.

164
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,760
Back in elementary school,

165
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,610
doctors said it might be hard for me
to live long enough to graduate middle school.

166
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,490
So for the longest time,
becoming an adult was a dream for me.

167
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,740
I want to go to high school. To go to college.
To become an adult.

168
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,850
Harboring such thoughts,
how I am here right now...

169
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,920
I think it's a projection of my young self's dream.

170
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,980
Big Sister, how long are you
going to stay over there?

171
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,800
Mm, just a little longer.

172
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,930
I'll call you again later.

173
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,120
After hearing such a story,
I'm not sure what we should be doing.

174
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,630
At any rate, I'll head over
to the hospital again tomorrow.

175
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,340
Please do, Sakuta.

176
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,360
I'll see if Futaba will join me.
Leave it to us.

177
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,740
DECEMBER 10TH

178
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,200
Let me confirm one thing.

179
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,240
Middle-school Shoko doesn't know
that she sometimes grows up.

180
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,280
Am I understanding this correctly?

181
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,530
Shoko-san said she's never
met Makinohara directly,

182
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,710
so she probably doesn't know?

183
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,590
Yes?

184
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,890
How are you feeling?

185
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,030
Sakuta-san! You came by!

186
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,850
I brought Futaba with me today.

187
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,180
Hello.

188
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,030
Hello.

189
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,400
It's a sudden visit, but are you okay with it?

190
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,860
Yes, it's totally fine. I'm happy you did.

191
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,110
I'm glad.

192
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,990
Were you studying?

193
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,550
No.

194
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,030
Actually, this is perfect.

195
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,410
Can I ask both of you for some advice?

196
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,870
PRESENT
GRADUATE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
GRADUATE MIDDLE SCHOOL

197
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,950
"Future plans"?

198
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,870
What about it?

199
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,540
ATTEND A HIGH SCHOOL WITH AN OCEAN VIEW!
MEET THE BOY OF MY DESTINY
GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL HEALTHY!

200
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,540
I filled this out during class back in 4th grade.

201
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,280
I couldn't mention it last time,
but due to my illness,

202
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,800
it'll be hard for me to live through middle school
without a heart transplant.

203
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,760
A heart transplant.

204
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:10,730
That's why I had so much I wanted
to write down for my future plans,

205
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,060
But I just couldn't bring myself
to write anything after middle school.

206
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,630
I thought I'd love to fill it out someday,
but I just couldn't get myself to.

207
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,910
In the end, I never completed this
before graduating from elementary school.

208
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,460
But this is your handwriting, isn't it?

209
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,620
Yes, but... I didn't write these down.

210
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,750
Maybe you'd forgotten that you wrote them?

211
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:40,400
When I saw it before being hospitalized,
there was nothing written there.

212
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,460
That's really strange.

213
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,600
Are all of these what you wanted
to write down back then?

214
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,460
It's slightly different.

215
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,770
If anything, it's closer to
what I'd want to write down now.

216
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,980
Then how would you continue
filling it out now?

217
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,700
First of all, I'd like to go to college.

218
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,840
It'd be nice to find a wonderful boyfriend.

219
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,510
Then we'd start living together.

220
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,000
It would be best if that leads to marriage.

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,360
Married while in college?

222
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,870
Yes. My parents married each other
while they were still in college.

223
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,560
Can I take a picture of this?

224
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,380
Sure.

225
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,210
I'll give it some thought.

226
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,010
For now, if we were to define
the existence of the older Shoko-san,

227
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,370
she appeared to act upon
the future plans

228
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,470
that Shoko wasn't able to write on the printout
back in elementary school.

229
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,270
That, or to preemptively experience
a future that may or may not occur.

230
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,980
ORGAN DONOR CARD

231
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,440
This is about all I can do for now.

232
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,270
So what are you going to do about it, Sakuta?

233
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,450
What am I going to do?

234
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,240
Marrying Shoko-san.

235
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,660
Hold on. Don't leap to conclusions!

236
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,130
Isn't "Meeting the boy of my destiny"
on the printout about you, Sakuta?

237
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,630
And isn't it referring to when you met
the high-school Shoko-san two years ago?

238
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,550
If so, the current Shoko-san is
a continuation of that, a college version.

239
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,180
And that means she showed up
in order to marry you.

240
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,440
DECEMBER 11TH

241
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,510
I'm coming in.

242
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,730
Yes, please do!

243
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,770
I hope I'm not bothering.

244
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,240
No. Thank you for dropping by again.

245
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,940
You put a tree up.

246
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,050
Yes, but I hope to be discharged
before Christmas.

247
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,670
And I hope I can go see
the illumination at Enoshima again.

248
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,280
The illumination at Enoshima, huh?

249
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,480
It's really beautiful.

250
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,730
Aren't you seeing it with Mai-san?

251
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,260
She said she still doesn't know
her work schedule yet.

252
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,220
She sure is busy.

253
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,350
Um, if that's the case,
would you like to go with me?

254
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,170
With you, Makinohara?

255
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,400
W-Well, it doesn't have to be
on the day of Christmas.

256
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,650
We can invite Rio-san and Kaede-san too,
and we can all go together.

257
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,360
When you're discharged from the hospital,
we can celebrate that.

258
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,970
Yes. I'm excited.

259
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,830
Oh, by the way, Sakuta-san...

260
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,410
ENTER COLLEGE
BE REUNITED WITH THE BOY OF MY DESTINY
HAVE COURAGE AND CONFESS MY LOVE

261
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,450
That thing from yesterday...

262
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,140
There's more.

263
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,960
Yes. There's more.

264
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,750
I am rather fond of Sakuta-kun myself.

265
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,670
In the end, do I have no choice
but to marry her?

266
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,470
DECEMBER 12TH

267
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,200
How is your fever?

268
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,040
Pretty high. Where's Mai-san?

269
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,190
She already left.
Said she had work today.

270
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,960
Hey, Shoko-san...

271
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,170
What is it?

272
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:51,030
Is the Shoko-san that's here now the same one
that I met at Shichirigahama two years ago?

273
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,160
Sakuta-kun back then
had quite a twisted personality.

274
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,280
Thanks for everything back then.

275
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,580
Hold on, if you're going to rest,
please lie down properly in your bed.

276
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,170
I was saved by you, Shoko-san.

277
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,380
The one who was saved...

278
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,760
...was me, Sakuta-kun.

279
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,940
Sakuta-kun, what phrases make you happy
to hear from others?

280
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:31,700
My three favorites are "Thank you,"
"You did your best," and "I love you."

281
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,240
You did your best, Sakuta-kun.

282
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,750
Shoko-san?

283
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,850
Sorry, it's just me.

284
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,390
U-Um...

285
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,380
You can make excuses after you're better.

286
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,310
I'm sure Shoko-san was nursing you
all afternoon, anyway.

287
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,430
Have you gotten any better?

288
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,330
Better than this morning.

289
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,470
A bath might be too much,
but you should at least change clothes.

290
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,250
Come on.

291
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,460
It's fine, I'll do it myself.
It'd be bad if I infect you, Mai-san.

292
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,900
Let me at least do something
that a girlfriend would do.

293
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,320
Sakuta, this...

294
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:21,330
It bled the last time Shoko-san dropped by.
It's been like this since.

295
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,620
- It doesn't hurt?
- Not for now.

296
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,500
This is also puberty syndrome, isn't it?

297
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,960
Probably.

298
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,840
DECEMBER 13TH

299
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,050
You here, Futaba?

300
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,230
Yes... Yes...

301
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,220
He just came in, I'll hand him the phone.

302
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,680
I told you to not rope me into a bloodbath.

303
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,210
Hello?

304
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,890
Is that you, Sakuta-kun?

305
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,980
What is it?

306
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,710
You're going to go on a date with me today.

307
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,650
But I don't want to.

308
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,390
Are you that afraid of Mai-san?

309
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,490
That's right, I am.

310
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,510
Well, this date will be beneficial to Mai-san too.

311
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:05,190
If I go on this date, will your puberty syndrome
be resolved, and Shoko-san will rest in peace?

312
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,170
That's correct.

313
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,330
I'll be mad if you're lying.

314
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,210
Let's meet up at the parking lot
for Shichirigahama at 1:00 p.m.

315
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,860
Understood.

316
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,050
Then, see you later.

317
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,510
I'll tell Mai-san myself,
so keep quiet about this.

318
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,660
I wonder how Shoko-san
perceives her existence to be.

319
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,440
It can't simply be a future self that
the middle-school Makinohara is dreaming of?

320
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,650
Shoko-san is about college age now, right?

321
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,570
What do you think happened to her memories
in the six to seven year gap?

322
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,200
Maybe it's empty?

323
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:45,370
If my theory is correct,
she's hiding something tremendous from you.

324
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,790
She is...

325
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,890
Shoko-san, are you okay physically?

326
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,260
I'm totally healthy. In other words, I'm fine.

327
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,880
You don't need to sound comical
or anything right now.

328
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,400
I'm trying to liven up our date.

329
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,190
But, thank you for worrying about me.

330
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,090
Shoko-san, are you familiar with this area?

331
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,240
Well, yes.

332
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,950
Seriously, where are we going?

333
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,250
Right here.

334
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,710
I don't flippin' get it.

335
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,760
Thank you for participating
in our guided tour.

336
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,590
This way, please.

337
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,480
Please head inside.

338
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,320
Would you like to try on a wedding dress?

339
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,850
Maybe not the dress...

340
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,690
No way. You should try one on.

341
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,860
But...

342
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,930
Can I make the request?

343
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,830
Of course. This way, please.

344
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,380
Sorry to make you wait.

345
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,730
Your mouth is gaping open.

346
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,320
I'm surprised because you're so beautiful.

347
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,690
Then it was worth all the time spent
picking one out to show you.

348
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,400
Please take your time.

349
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,430
Do you think a free guided tour
is enough to satisfy you?

350
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,820
You'd have to ask my younger self.

351
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,620
You actually know without asking her,
don't you, Shoko-san?

352
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,000
That scar on your chest...

353
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,290
You were able to get that heart transplant.

354
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,960
Yeah...

355
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,010
So, you came here from the future.

356
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,690
Are you mad?

357
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,720
Not really.

358
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,970
I just feel relieved.

359
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,850
That Makinohara manages
to go through a successful operation.

360
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,890
Yes. My little self will receive
a transplant operation soon,

361
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,280
and will overcome her heart disease.

362
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,100
Everything about the puberty syndrome
should be resolved by the time Christmas is over.

363
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,950
Then...

364
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,410
I can only spend up to Christmas with you.

365
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,790
So, will you give me one last memory?

366
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,880
Of what kind?

367
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,050
A memory of my first love.

368
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,600
I don't know why you're so fond of me.

369
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,600
There were plenty of reasons
why I'd be attracted to you, but...

370
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,780
You gave me the opportunity to raise Hayate.

371
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,850
But that's...

372
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,480
You were also the one who taught me

373
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,820
that it was better to say "thanks" and "I love you"
instead of "I'm sorry" to my parents.

374
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,870
You came to visit every day when I was
overcome with worry on the hospital bed.

375
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,250
All the feelings for my first love
remain in my heart for no one to hear.

376
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,880
So you need to take responsibility for it.

377
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,380
What should I do, then?

378
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:33,520
On the night of Christmas Eve, please go see
the illumination at Enoshima with me.

379
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,080
But...

380
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,960
Beginning on the 23rd, Kaede will
be staying over at her grandfather's.

381
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,030
I haven't heard of such plans,
and besides...

382
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,200
Mai-san will have time off from early evening.

383
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,920
Please decide.
Whether you'll spend time with me or Mai-san.

384
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,830
Shoko-san, I...

385
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,080
You don't have to say anything.

386
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,710
I will be waiting.

387
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,680
6:00 p.m. On the 24th,

388
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,130
at the entrance to Bentenbashi
in front of the dragon lantern.

389
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,770
How was the date?

390
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,740
Just like your theory, she had a scar
on her chest from an operation.

391
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,250
So you saw Shoko-san's breasts.

392
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,890
It's not like I stripped her to see it, though.

393
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,710
But how did Shoko-san come here
from the future?

394
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:26,410
It's likely better to say "she arrived at the future"
instead of "she came from the future."

395
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,110
"Arrived at the future"?

396
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,910
When we visited Shoko the other day,
she was surprisingly more vocal about her worries.

397
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,380
She was wishing for her body
to just stop growing altogether.

398
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,630
But she told me she wanted to show
her parents how she'd end up as an adult.

399
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,190
Maybe the Shoko that wishes
to become an adult

400
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,720
and the Shoko that refuses to grow up...

401
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,720
Those two existences are the cause
of her puberty syndrome.

402
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,560
What do you mean by that?

403
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:01,810
The Shoko that refuses to grow up
is likely trying desperately to stop her internal clock.

404
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,320
What if, as a result, the world that she sees
has drastically slowed down,

405
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,950
and everything in that world
is moving in slow-motion?

406
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,650
What if we, and the Shoko
who wishes to become an adult,

407
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,580
saw that world from our perspective,
what would it relatively look like to us?

408
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,530
We're talking quantum physics, my favorite.

409
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:32,610
Nope. It's about the Theory of Relativity.

410
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,460
Like the Japanese fairy tale
in which when you returned from Dragon Palace,

411
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,120
several decades had passed on land.

412
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,160
So Shoko-san is kinda like Urashima Taro, huh?

413
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,400
Right. Because time moved faster
for the Shoko that refused to grow up,

414
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,780
she arrived at the future ahead of us.

415
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,700
I'm home!

416
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,160
Oh, welcome home, Big Brother.

417
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,290
Yup. He just got home.

418
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,290
Yup. All right, see you.

419
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,610
Who's the call from?

420
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,630
It was from Dad.

421
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,090
He said Grandpa and Grandma
really want to see me.

422
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,010
Mai-san called a few minutes ago, too.

423
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,730
Said she wants you to pick her up
at the train station around 9:00 p.m.

424
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,840
Apparently, she has something to talk about.

425
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,140
Something to talk about?

426
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,580
Please keep today's chat a secret from others.

427
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,610
It'd be terrible if the future changed
and I couldn't have that operation.

428
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:36,240
The film shoot is going well, so I don't have
any plans from early evening.

429
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,910
About the 24th...

430
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,000
We're going on a date.

431
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,120
How about we go see
the illumination at Enoshima?

432
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,820
I'd rather go see the jellyfish at the aquarium.

433
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,660
The one that's being advertised
in the trains lately?

434
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,590
Yeah, that.

435
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,300
I kinda got curious
after seeing the ads every day.

436
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,140
You like jellyfish?

437
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,060
I think I'd like jellyfish
that I watch with you.

438
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,060
I see...

439
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:11,860
Then I'll head straight from work, so can we
meet in front of the aquarium at 6:00 p. M?

440
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,400
Sure.

441
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,490
DECEMBER 14TH

442
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,950
Senpai, did something good happen to you?

443
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,800
You're grinning and stuff.

444
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,490
More like did something happen to you, Koga?

445
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,050
Eh? Why?

446
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,830
Your upper arms look chubbier.

447
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,920
You're so cruel, Senpai! I'm supa pissed off!

448
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,840
Sorry, I'm late.

449
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,800
Not at all...

450
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,140
I'll come a little earlier tomorrow.

451
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,730
PROMISE TO GO ON AN IMPORTANT DATE
ON CHRISTMAS EVE

452
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,350
There's yet another entry.

453
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,350
That's right...

454
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,650
Um, Sakuta-san...

455
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,190
My illness isn't getting any better.

456
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,160
The symptoms are held back
with medication for now,

457
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,280
but it won't be effective for the long term.

458
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,910
I see...

459
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,830
Yes, so that's why...

460
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,080
I don't want you to visit me anymore.

461
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,040
No way.

462
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,340
I'll come tomorrow, and the day after that.

463
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,050
Well, there might be some days
that I can't because of work,

464
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,760
but until you're discharged,
I'll visit you every day.

465
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,640
But, I...

466
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:26,850
I...

467
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,740
You gave it your best, Makinohara.
You really gave a valiant effort.

468
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,410
Sakuta-san, I...

469
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:47,870
To be honest... I didn't want to be sick either!

470
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,520
Why does it have to be me?

471
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,890
I want to keep living, too!

472
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,460
Live... Live... and I...

473
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,760
You've been doing your best every day,
more than anyone else.

474
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,720
That's why you don't have
to keep trying all by yourself anymore.

475
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,120
I'll be here again tomorrow.
And the day after that.

476
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,350
I promise you.

477
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,400
Really?

478
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,780
Makinohara?

479
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,320
Makinohara!

480
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,740
- Makinohara's condition has suddenly changed!
- Shoko...

481
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,620
- Verify the operation room, stat!
- Shoko...

482
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,500
- ICU is secured!
- How are the vitals?

483
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,710
This pain!

484
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,510
What's going on!?

485
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,380
Why does it have to be right now!?

486
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,260
Could it be...

487
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,520
That my...

488
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,950
Your heart is racing right now, isn't it?

489
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,780
Don't get me so excited.

490
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,530
I'm the same.

491
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,610
When I'm with you, my heart races.

492
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,880
I'm telling you,
it's bad for my wounds so please stop.

493
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,660
It'll be all right. I'm sure it will heal.

494
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,810
The wound in your heart,
and the wound on your chest...

495
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,460
I will heal them both.

496
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,630
I'll make sure of it.

497
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,600
Sakuta-kun.

498
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,770
Shoko-san...

499
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,900
There was a call saying you suddenly collapsed.
You surprised me.

500
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:46,670
I had a dream...
About when I first met you.

501
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,530
I see.

502
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,450
It was just like this back then, too.

503
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,790
This scar showed up on my chest, and...

504
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,380
Hey, Shoko-san...

505
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,510
My heart is the one inside your chest, isn't it?

506
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,140
In the end, you always notice these things.

507
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:14,390
I was given a future by you, Sakuta-kun.

508
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,360
What did you mean by that just now?

509
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,950
In ten days, on December 24th...

510
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,450
On the 24th, it starts showing in the afternoon.

511
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,580
It was on the way to the meeting place
that he promised with you, Mai-san.

512
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,340
Sakuta-kun was involved in a traffic accident.

513
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,060
How do you know such a thing?

514
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,050
I came here from the future.

515
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,640
It's true.

516
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,100
Even after being transported to the hospital,
Sakuta-kun didn't regain consciousness.

517
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,480
Eventually, he was declared brain-dead.

518
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,980
Then they found a donor card
among Sakuta-kun's belongings,

519
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,690
and I was miraculously able to
receive a heart transplant.

520
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,700
I see.

521
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,920
I found out everything after the operation,

522
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,080
when I tried to tell Sakuta-kun
that the procedure was a success.

523
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,710
That was when I heard everything
from Mai-san.

524
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:24,310
So please, spend a quiet Christmas
with a stay-at-home date this year.

525
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,050
But that's...

526
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:32,010
It's fine. My younger self still has a bit of time.
Please have faith in modern medicine.

527
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:38,940
Now, it's dangerous for me to stay here
for too long, so I'll be heading back.

528
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,690
Mai-san...

529
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,610
Please take care of Sakuta-kun.

530
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,530
I wish it was all a lie.

531
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,000
You know, Mai-san...

532
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,710
I have no intention of breaking up.

533
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,880
We have to change plans
for our Christmas Eve date.

534
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:10,260
Nodoka won't be home since she has a show,
so we can spend it alone at my place.

535
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,350
We're going to visit a shrine
in the new year, too.

536
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,910
I'm sure it'll be a hassle
with all the people on New Year's Day,

537
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,280
so maybe around the end of winter break?

538
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,190
Right.

539
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,230
I'll make you some chocolate
for Valentine's in February.

540
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:29,280
I'll be graduating come spring,
but I'll be a strict tutor, so brace yourself.

541
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,870
And after a year's time,
we'll be going to the same college.

542
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,370
So...

543
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,750
I want you to choose a future with me.

544
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,250
That is my request to you.

545
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,630
I won't stay over tonight.

546
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:50,970
Okay...

547
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,220
So, good night.

548
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,930
Good night.

549
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,000
DECEMBER 18TH

550
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,060
What about your club activities?

551
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,790
I saw you walking home,
so I took the day off.

552
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,530
Is that a confession of your love?

553
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,240
Azusagawa, have you been avoiding me lately?

554
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,080
I think it's just you...

555
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,930
I know about how you collapsed on Sunday.

556
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:07,580
And about how Shoko is now in ICU,
because I went to the hospital yesterday.

557
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,180
I see, so you already noticed.

558
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,960
I considered the possibilities.

559
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:18,330
After all, each time your wound opened up
was when Shoko-san showed up.

560
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,720
You're amazing.

561
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:25,230
My guess is that Shoko and Shoko-san
can't encounter each other due to quantum properties.

562
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,570
However, you ended up meeting Shoko-san...
Although the two are partially the same existence.

563
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,800
Because two copies of your heart exist,
when there should only be one normally,

564
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,620
you have that wound on your chest, don't you?

565
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,250
She said I was gonna get run over
by a car on the 24th.

566
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,190
Sakurajima-senpai knows about this?

567
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,980
She knows. She heard about it with me.

568
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:59,220
I can't say much of anything, but...
you two should really talk it out.

569
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,850
Yeah, you're right.

570
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,810
Azusagawa...

571
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,020
I...

572
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,230
...don't want this.

573
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,960
How are your exam studies going?

574
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,160
Not progressing much because you're not here
tutoring me in a bunny girl outfit.

575
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:26,150
If I wore a bunny girl outfit,
you wouldn't be making progress for other reasons.

576
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,350
I might make progress elsewhere.

577
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:28,830
Idiot.

578
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,210
You know, Mai-san...

579
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,420
By the way, about Kaede...

580
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,970
She said she wanted to cut her hair
before going to her grandpa's, right?

581
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,090
Yes.

582
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:44,530
A makeup artist I know has a salon in Chigasaki.
Why don't we take her, if she doesn't mind?

583
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,560
Really?

584
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,400
I can tag along if it's Sunday afternoon,
so you can ask Kaede for me?

585
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,190
Got it.

586
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,690
Um, and...

587
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:58,530
Oh, my break's about to end.
I'll call again tomorrow. See you.

588
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,740
DECEMBER 21ST

589
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,810
I think it might be good
to lighten up this area a bit more.

590
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,810
- Yeah, she might look good with that, too.
- And why are you here, Toyohama?

591
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,790
I had an appointment today, too.
That a problem?

592
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,010
Anyways, about the 24th...

593
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,280
I'm heading straight home after the gig.

594
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,630
Don't worry. We'll leave some cake for you.

595
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,360
I'm not worried about that.

596
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,430
The chicken, then?

597
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:30,370
Sakuta, you really are a blessed guy.

598
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,630
What's this all of a sudden?

599
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:36,580
I mean, my sister of all people is the one
that's so excited to spend Christmas with you.

600
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,320
She's just been asking about what to cook,
which store to buy the cake from, what to wear...

601
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,530
Just imagining her
doing all that is so cute.

602
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,410
I'll never forgive you if you make her cry.

603
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,540
I'm done.

604
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,210
H-How is it?

605
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,590
I think it looks good.

606
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,820
Does it look a little over-the-top?

607
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,790
Looking over-the-top is someone like this.

608
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,180
I am so not!

609
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,520
Nodoka, sorry but can I ask you
to take Kaede back home?

610
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,520
Hm? What about you?

611
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,940
I have something I promised Sakuta after this.

612
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,410
Kaede, do you think you can
go home without me?

613
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:27,180
Big Brother, how old do you think I am?

614
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,660
Then, it'll be fine.

615
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,810
I'm glad Kaede is slowly
gaining independence from her brother.

616
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,730
Are you alluding to me with that?

617
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,500
I want you to flourish as a sister-loving idol.

618
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,290
Take good care of Mai-san.

619
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,260
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

620
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,020
So, where are we going, Mai-san?

621
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,230
This brings back memories.
Do you remember going to Ogaki together?

622
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,400
That's already six months ago.

623
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,050
Which train takes us the farthest?

624
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,630
How far are you thinking?

625
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,780
Really far.

626
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,780
I want to keep changing trains
and go further than we did that day.

627
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,390
Starting now, I think Ogaki is as far as we get.

628
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,330
If we run out of trains,
we can spend the night in an unfamiliar city.

629
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,040
In the same room?

630
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,880
If you want to.

631
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,260
This story sounds like a dream.

632
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,800
And in the morning, we'll head out again.

633
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,260
We'll travel forever to a place far away...
a place very far away...

634
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:35,690
That sounds really fun...
But you're joking, right, Mai-san?

635
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,060
You're the one, Sakuta...

636
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,210
You're the one who needs
to stop joking around!

637
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,400
Don't talk to Nodoka and Kaede
as if you were saying goodbye!

638
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,610
If anything, something is wrong with you!

639
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,950
Don't give up all by yourself!
Don't decide without asking!

640
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,160
What am I to you, Sakuta?

641
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,790
Girlfriend.

642
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,250
Then, I'll bear the burden.
Shoko's life, together with you.

643
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,520
And so... I'll bear the burden of life!

644
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,800
Please, stay with me like this forever!
Stay by my side until Christmas is over!

645
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,930
Take a train and go with me
as far as we can go!

646
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,560
That would be really fun, wouldn't it...

647
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,620
But I can't.

648
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,640
Why not?

649
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,390
I still have school tomorrow.

650
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,520
Just be absent!

651
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,500
You have work again tomorrow, don't you?

652
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
I don't care about work anymore!

653
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,240
It means nothing compared to losing you

654
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,740
You know, I really love you.

655
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:34,830
It was a shame that you were always busy
so we couldn't go on that many dates...

656
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,960
But the person I want to be with
is the usual Mai-san.

657
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,090
That's the Mai-san I'm in love with.

658
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,010
Fine...

659
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,670
Fine! I don't care if you hate me
as long as you stay alive!

660
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,170
Just stay with me like this!
Until Christmas is over!

661
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,450
After that, you can hate me all you want!

662
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,550
That's impossible.

663
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,180
Why?!

664
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,270
I could never hate you.

665
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,900
Why...

666
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,940
Why...

667
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,280
Because I'll always love you.

668
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:15,910
Liar...

669
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,510
I swear that I'll always love you.

670
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,960
You're a liar...

671
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,250
But I'm also a liar...

672
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,010
I don't want you to hate me.
Please don't hate me.

673
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,170
Welcome home, Sakuta-kun.

674
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,430
Is Mai-san back at her place again today?

675
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,280
Yes...

676
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,250
Where's Kaede?

677
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,530
She's already asleep.

678
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,790
Shoko-san, I...

679
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,900
I didn't want to make Mai-san cry like that.

680
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,760
I don't want her to cry like that again.

681
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,040
That's why... That's why, Shoko-san...

682
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,470
Yes, what is it?

683
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,810
I'm sorry, Shoko-san.

684
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,100
I want to keep living.

685
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:26,150
I want to be with Mai-san forever.
All the way into our future.

686
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,400
I'm the one that needs to apologize.

687
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,530
I'm sorry I forced you
to make such a painful decision.

688
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,510
If I had done things better,
I wouldn't have made you suffer.

689
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,700
That's...

690
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,970
It's not your fault.
You put up a valiant effort.

691
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:46,830
I...

692
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,920
You managed to tell me.

693
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,470
That's why you need to make Mai-san happy.

694
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,820
DECEMBER 24TH

695
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,410
My happy, giddy days of living with Sakuta-kun
comes to an end today.

696
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,870
Shoko-san...

697
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,710
Take care.

698
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,210
I'm heading out.

699
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:39,730
For all of you, what kind of a year was it?

700
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,170
Isn't it cold today?

701
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,170
Seriously cold.

702
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,060
It's wicked, right?

703
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,860
Sakuta-kun.

704
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,160
Shoko's mother says
that she wanted you to see Shoko.

705
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,100
Sorry to trouble you all the time.

706
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,000
It's nothing.

707
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,640
You did your best, Sakuta-kun.

708
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,890
You put up a valiant effort.

709
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,110
She really is amazing.

710
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,070
Makinohara is still doing her best right now.

711
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,320
It's me.

712
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,570
Mai-san, I...

713
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:49,540
I had a dream last night.
Of us heading to a shrine in the new year.

714
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,170
You were bragging that you swore to the gods
that you'd make me happy.

715
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,270
That does sound like me.

716
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:02,180
It really is like you,
lying to me even in my dreams.

717
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,680
I won't let myself forget about you.

718
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,390
I will keep living with you.

719
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,230
Mai-san, I...

720
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:25,340
Why? Is it supposed to be at the next red light?

721
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,020
How about we go see
the illumination at Enoshima?

722
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,150
Please come see
the illumination at Enoshima with me.

723
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,580
Can it be, that from
the very beginning, Shoko-san...

724
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,120
This is insane.

725
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,250
Shoko-san is out of her mind.

726
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,630
She knew from the very beginning
that I would go to where Mai-san is.

727
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:00,710
That's why...

728
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:03,520
6:00 p.m. On the 24th,

729
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,840
at the entrance to Bentenbashi
in front of the dragon lantern.

730
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:10,430
Because she knew I'd never show up there.

731
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,890
Everything about the puberty syndrome
should be resolved by the time Christmas is over.

732
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:17,400
If I had done things better...

733
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,110
Take care.

734
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:21,590
What the hell?!

735
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,400
Something is seriously wrong
with you, Shoko-san!

736
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,660
Whoa! That was dangerous! Look out!

737
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,560
I can't let it end like this!

738
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,700
Please, let me get there in time!

739
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Sakuta-kun!

740
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,100
Sakuta!

741
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:06,990
Ow...

742
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,990
My daughter... Mai...
Is she really...

743
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:50,530
We've done everything we could.
A true shame.

744
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,160
Mai...

745
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:59,420
Give Mai back to me!

746
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,420
Give her back!

747
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,310
Why?!

748
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:24,940
Why?!

749
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:29,150
Why didn't you protect her, Sakuta?!

750
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:36,240
Why... Why... Why...

751
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:40,790
I'm sorry...

752
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,540
I'm sorry...

753
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,500
If only I was the one who died...

754
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:02,940
I see...

755
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,190
That's right...

756
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,570
Because I've been saved, Shoko-san...

757
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:22,620
I couldn't... protect anyone.

758
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:41,520
DECEMBER 25TH

759
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:37,640
The door's unlocked.

760
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:41,060
Sakuta, you here? We're coming in!

761
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,230
Sakuta.

762
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,060
I saw the accident on the news.

763
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,650
We called you so many times.

764
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,240
Sorry to make you worry.

765
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:03,870
You have four messages.
First message: 7:03 a.m.

766
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,830
Big Brother, it's all a lie, right?
Tell me it isn't so...

767
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,160
That something like that
wouldn't happen to Mai-san...

768
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,450
Give me the phone.

769
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:14,300
Sakuta, if you hear this message, please call us.

770
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:18,550
You can call your family on the move.
Let's go, Sakuta.

771
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:19,810
Where to?

772
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,810
Photos and videos of the accident
are making the rounds on social media.

773
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,270
There were a few with you in it, Sakuta.

774
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,060
I see...

775
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:32,820
You should stay at my place for a while.
The media will be surrounding this house.

776
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,580
THE LATE MAI SAKURAJIMA
MEMORIAL SERVICES

777
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:45,250
THE LATE MAI SAKURAJIMA
FUNERAL SERVICE

778
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:45,250
THIS WAY FOR ALL FANS

779
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:51,750
DECEMBER 28TH

780
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,750
We are at a funeral home in Tokyo.

781
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:58,090
LIVE BROADCAST FROM MAI SAKURAJIMA'S FUNERAL SERVICE

782
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,510
Under the rain that began falling
since early afternoon,

783
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:58,260
Mai Sakurajima's funeral service is underway.

784
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,350
A FAREWELL ALL TOO EARLY...
MAI SAKURAJIMA'S FUNERAL SERVICE

785
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:04,290
As many of you may already know,
four days ago, on December 24th,

786
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:08,350
actress Mai Sakurajima passed away
in a traffic accident.

787
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:13,410
That's exactly right...
Actually, the day before the accidentâ€”

788
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:17,820
I've never done anything like this before,
so there's some areas that I'm not confident in.

789
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:31,090
SUDDEN FAREWELL
TO MAI SAKURAJIMA

790
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:22,350
But Mai-san, I'm sure that the boy can't help
but be under your spell.

791
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,900
Who do you think I really am?

792
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,900
Though, I do have the upper hand.

793
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,030
I thought so!

794
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,090
But I'm sure my love for him is stronger.

795
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:35,170
Oh? Is that okay to say?
I'm sure he'll be watching this too, right?

796
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,570
Please help...

797
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:56,240
Please help...

798
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:01,700
Someone... Please save Mai-san...

799
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,540
I don't care who...

800
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,970
Please save Mai-san...

801
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,430
Please... I beg you.

802
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,770
I'm begging, please!

803
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,570
Please stand up, Sakuta-kun.

804
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:46,380
It's your job to save Mai-san.

805
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,410
Is it not?

806
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:51,210
Why... Why are you still here, Shoko-san?

807
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:55,420
I see. You still don't know, do you?

808
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:01,430
Mai-san's heart is residing right here.

809
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,830
It wasn't made public,

810
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:10,230
but that night, Mai-san coincidentally
became my donor after the accident.

811
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,350
She also had a donor card?

812
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:13,400
Yes.

813
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:16,920
But... Then the future has changed.

814
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,230
Let's go save Mai-san.

815
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,510
Go where?

816
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,110
To the past, of course.

817
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,610
Such a thing isâ€”

818
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:27,790
It's possible. Leave it all to me.

819
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,560
It's all right, there's no need to worry.

820
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,310
Since Mai-san's funeral service
is today, nobody is here.

821
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,840
Why the nurse's office?

822
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,840
You need a bed to go back to the past.

823
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,490
Shoko-san, this is...

824
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,270
Plum soda for adults.

825
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:03,950
You already know that the future exists here
and there, and how I came from the future.

826
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:09,200
That's caused by
your puberty syndrome, isn't it?

827
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,200
Yes.

828
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,630
My younger self developed puberty syndrome
because she was anxious about her future.

829
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:23,630
But this moment, in which I am speaking
to you like this, is not the "present."

830
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:29,010
You caused this. Do you have any idea how?

831
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:36,190
Just like my younger self, was there a time
when you refused your own future?

832
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,520
I want you to choose a future with me.

833
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,080
Why...

834
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,070
I want to keep living.

835
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:47,700
Looks like you have an idea of when.

836
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,410
That's...

837
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,420
You need to accept it.

838
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,040
The weak part of yourself
that refused your own future.

839
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,420
Believing in that weakness is the first step
to recognizing now as "the future."

840
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:09,720
If this is "the future," you can go
to the "present" and save Mai-san.

841
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:12,100
Shoko-san...

842
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,390
What is it?

843
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:16,890
I want to make Mai-san happy.

844
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,810
And you can.

845
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,940
That's why I have something I need to tell you.

846
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,620
I want you to stay alive, Shoko-san.

847
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,490
Yes.

848
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:30,070
I pray for it. I wish for it.

849
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,530
I know that.

850
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,700
But I'm not a doctor.
I don't have special powers, either.

851
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:40,380
All I can do is to make Mai-san happy.

852
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:45,050
But I couldn't even carry out that one job.

853
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,380
That's why... That's why, Shoko-san...

854
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,640
Yes?

855
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,430
I can't do anything for you.

856
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:57,430
That's okay.

857
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,880
Why am I...

858
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,530
I thought I already decided.

859
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:08,950
Shoko-san...

860
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,950
Huh?

861
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,580
Looks like the dose I snuck in is working now.

862
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,660
To send you to the "present,"
I needed to break away

863
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:27,880
your common sense that tries to
to make sense of the present moment.

864
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,550
It's only in your dreams
where you can toss the ordinary aside.

865
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,970
Shoko-san...

866
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,770
I will be all right.

867
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:43,520
When you return to the present,
first find someone who can find you.

868
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,900
Good night, Sakuta-kun.

869
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,920
DECEMBER 24TH

870
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:08,380
Am I really back?

871
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,770
Ma'am, he jammed his finger.

872
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:12,540
Kunimi!

873
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,510
I'll chill it, so sit down over there.

874
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,100
Ow!

875
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,260
Hey, Kunimi...

876
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:20,930
What's going on?

877
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:24,650
...first find someone who can find you.

878
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:27,070
So we're talking quantum theory...

879
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:31,450
Right now, half of me is in the future
and the other half in the present.

880
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:35,320
Until someone finds me
my existence is not confirmed.

881
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,370
DECEMBER 24TH

882
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,580
Futaba!

883
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:44,920
Hey, Futaba! Notice me!

884
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,210
Futaba!

885
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,210
PRESENT FUTURE

886
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,010
Thanks.

887
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:54,640
I'll borrow this for a bit.

888
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:57,800
Huh?

889
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,390
Damn, I can't use it?

890
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:02,890
We're starting off with some high hurdles.

891
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:10,730
Guess I'll follow Mai-san's example.

892
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,990
Someone! Is there anyone that can see me?!

893
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:20,740
I don't care who! Anyone who can see me!
Can anyone hear my voice?!

894
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,840
Excuse me! Can you see me?

895
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,620
Look at me! Look!

896
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,900
I want to save Mai-san!

897
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:28,630
Please!

898
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:36,470
Someone... Come on, find me...

899
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,970
Please... Find me...

900
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:42,930
I beg you...

901
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,400
Senpai, what are you doing?

902
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,320
Koga...

903
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,890
Y-You can see me?!

904
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:03,430
Of course I can see you.
Are you all right, Senpai?

905
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:05,040
L-Let me touch you.

906
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:06,950
Let me touch you.

907
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:07,920
What the!?

908
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,660
Actually, I had a dream about you last night.

909
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,510
A dream?

910
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,920
A dream where you were in trouble
at the train station.

911
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,020
It was nagging on my mind
for some reason, so I came by.

912
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,500
Quantum entanglement...

913
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,540
What's that?

914
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:26,310
Everyone needs a cute kouhai
with whom you've kicked each other's butts.

915
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:28,510
Sheesh! Forget about that already!

916
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,440
Koga, I have a favor to ask you.

917
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,030
Huh?! H-H-H-Hold on!

918
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:38,030
I want you to meet up with my other self.

919
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:44,200
There really is another one of you here, Senpai!

920
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,230
Hand the phone to me there.

921
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:48,040
You need to tell me more about this later.

922
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:52,060
Is this really me?

923
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:55,140
It is. I came from four days in the future.

924
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,650
Four days from now? Meaning you already...

925
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:01,260
Yeah. I know what's going
to happen today after this call.

926
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,870
That's why I came here to change the future.

927
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:08,690
Hold on. I didn't get into an accident?

928
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:13,570
Right before getting hit by a car
Mai-san shoved me aside to save me.

929
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,370
Because of that, I'm still alive.

930
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,330
That's why you shouldn't head
to the aquarium at all costs.

931
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:22,540
- But...
- If you go, Mai-san will die in my place.

932
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:25,990
But if I don't go,
what will happen to Makinohara!?

933
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:27,580
I made up my mind.

934
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:32,850
What are you thinking, if you're myself?
Don't you care what happens to Makinohara!?

935
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:37,900
I want to make Mai-san happy.
I can't do anything for Makinohara.

936
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:41,780
Are you really me?
You're out of your mind. You're crazy.

937
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,120
I don't care if I am.

938
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,720
If I can live and make Mai-san happy,
that's fine by me.

939
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:50,860
If I have to watch Makinohara die,
then I'll get into that accident.

940
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,470
Even if that means making Mai-san cry?

941
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:54,520
Just be sure to stop Mai-san at all costs!

942
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:58,610
I really don't get it, do it...

943
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:02,280
I'm on break right now. Need something?

944
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,260
Do you know where Mai-san is?

945
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,560
The TV station, right?

946
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,770
I want to know which station.
I want to go see her right now.

947
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:11,820
Huh? You can't just suddenly show up
and be able to see her.

948
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,270
That's why I'm asking Lady Nodoka to help.

949
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:17,880
I'm begging you, seriously.
I want to make a surprise visit.

950
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,240
Are you fooling around?

951
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,890
This is the result after thinking hard.

952
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,600
Well, whatever, since it'll spare me the trouble.

953
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:36,310
Hurry and get in!

954
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:39,590
We'll enter the station
saying that you're film crew.

955
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:40,280
Sorry about this.

956
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,070
Please make up with her
properly this time, okay?

957
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:51,910
Excuse me, I have a guest for you, Mai-san.

958
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:54,330
Nodoka?

959
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,880
A Christmas present from me.

960
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:03,050
Thank you, Nodoka.

961
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,860
And I'm sorry to trouble you again, Ryoko.

962
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,600
Can you leave the two of us alone for a bit?

963
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,440
How long are you planning on doing that?

964
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,860
That's not the real reason
you came back from the future, is it?

965
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:31,490
Mai-san...

966
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:35,460
You really are Mai-san. You're alive.

967
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,840
I'm glad. I was able to actually protect you, Sakuta.

968
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:45,050
I was finally able to be of help to you.

969
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:49,470
Mai-san... You intended on saving me
from the beginning.

970
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:55,560
Didn't I tell you before?
I love you a lot more than you think.

971
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,440
Mai-san...

972
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,070
Let me take a good look at your face.

973
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,460
You haven't grown too much.

974
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,850
I'm only from four days in the future.

975
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,800
Oh? I had voicemail from you.

976
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,740
Saying a future version of Sakuta was around,
so I had my hopes up.

977
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,830
I'll grow up in due time, so please wait.

978
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,040
I have to get going now.

979
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,840
I have plans to go on a date with Sakuta.

980
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,670
Wait, Mai-san.

981
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,040
Let go of me.

982
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:26,940
It's all right.

983
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:28,340
It's not all right!

984
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:34,850
If he knows I'll be in an accident,
Sakuta will do even more to sacrifice himself!

985
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:38,520
He's definitely thinking that he should be
the one to get in an accident!

986
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:44,110
He's just not the one to be able
to accept robbing Shoko's future to stay alive!

987
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,860
If I don't go, Sakuta will die!

988
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,870
Please, just stay here!

989
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:53,490
I'm begging you...

990
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:59,290
I can't take it anymore.
On you no longer being here.

991
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:04,460
I'll be all right.
I'll do something about myself.

992
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:07,720
Sakuta, are you all right with that?

993
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:11,340
I've made my decision. So I want you to wait.

994
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:14,010
Is it really all right?

995
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,520
Knowing me, I'm sure I'll be in shambles
from crying on the way home.

996
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:21,810
So please hug me like this
when the time comes.

997
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,780
If you do, I promise I'll make you happy.

998
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,280
I understand.

999
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:30,660
Thank you, Mai-san.

1000
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,950
But you got one thing wrong.

1001
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:41,790
I don't really need you to make me happy.

1002
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:47,010
The two of us will be happy together.
Sakuta and I.

1003
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:52,720
I really can't win against you, can I?

1004
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:55,180
I'll be waiting for you.

1005
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:18,270
Sorry to make you wait.

1006
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:21,500
I haven't been waiting.
Besides, it's before the meeting time.

1007
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:25,420
In any case, your outfit for the occasion
is quite interesting.

1008
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:29,460
I've been wearing it all day,
so it already feels like a part of me.

1009
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:34,020
I'm sorry. I must have failed.

1010
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,890
It wasn't a failure at all.

1011
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:38,430
Thanks to you, I'm here.

1012
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:40,020
My future self.

1013
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,190
Sakuta-kun, let's hold hands.

1014
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,240
It's a bit embarrassing.

1015
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:58,660
Shoko-san...

1016
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:01,620
I'll take it all with me.

1017
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:07,090
The time I spent with you,
the memories, everything.

1018
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:09,050
I'll take every last bit to the future.

1019
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:17,730
Sakuta-kun, why do you think
people forget about various events in life?

1020
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,390
I won't forget.

1021
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:25,980
People must forget, because they can't endure
holding on to painful memories forever.

1022
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:30,280
Then, there's no reason for me
to forget about you.

1023
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:31,700
Eh?

1024
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,740
To me, you are a bittersweet memory
of my first love.

1025
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,820
There's no need for me to forget about you.

1026
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,790
You really do have a twisted personality.

1027
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:46,000
I have to get going soon.

1028
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,710
Right.

1029
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:57,970
Goodbye, Shoko-san.

1030
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,560
Bye-bye, Sakuta-kun.

1031
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,020
At the quantum level,
my two selves can never meet.

1032
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,030
On the other hand,

1033
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:17,070
it also means that as long as I am not recognized,
we can exist simultaneously.

1034
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,080
Sakuta-kun!

1035
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:46,640
I'm...

1036
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:52,360
I see, so that's what happens.

1037
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,860
Are you hurt anywhere?

1038
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:56,570
Hey, you...

1039
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:58,700
I'm all right.

1040
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:15,880
I took it from her...
Makinohara's future...

1041
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:22,220
But... There was no other way for me.

1042
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,590
I'm home.

1043
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:04,850
Welcome back.

1044
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:25,410
DECEMBER 25TH

1045
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,790
It's already 10:00 a.m., so get up.

1046
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:31,090
I'm awake...

1047
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:35,330
Eat your breakfast before it's cold.
I have to head to school now.

1048
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:37,690
It's winter break already, right?

1049
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:41,810
I was absent yesterday for filming,
so I have to go pick up my report card.

1050
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,640
Then, I'll go with you.

1051
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:48,970
Futaba...

1052
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:51,270
Azusagawa...

1053
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,440
Hey, are you all right?

1054
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:00,230
No...

1055
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:02,000
Futaba?

1056
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,740
I'm not all right!

1057
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:06,660
Sorry I made you worry.

1058
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,490
I'm not all right...

1059
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:12,250
I thought I'd never see you again...

1060
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:15,920
I'm so glad... I'm so glad you're alive.

1061
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,130
What happened yesterday?

1062
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,470
So much that I don't know where to begin.

1063
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:26,470
In any case, I did what I needed to do.

1064
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:34,140
Which... Senpai are you?

1065
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,840
Both. We fused together.

1066
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,720
I don't flippin' get it.

1067
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,870
Sorry to make you worry.

1068
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:43,110
I really appreciate you, Koga.

1069
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:50,280
Here's some souvenirs from Grandma.
She says hello to Big Brother's girlfriend, too.

1070
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:54,980
Oh, I know what this is.
It's super tasty, Big Sis.

1071
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:59,140
Toyohama, you're plastering yourself
on to Mai-san more than usual.

1072
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:01,210
Did your sisterly love get even worse?

1073
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:06,680
She said she had a bad dream this morning.
One where I got into a traffic accident.

1074
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,140
I see. Well, not much we can do about that.

1075
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,250
My Mai-san can spoil you
all you want just for today.

1076
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,300
I don't need your permission.

1077
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,980
Nodoka, you can step on Sakuta's foot.

1078
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:23,610
DECEMBER 26TH

1079
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,790
SNOWMAN INSIDE!

1080
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:37,420
I hope Shoko gets better.

1081
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:45,120
What's wrong?

1082
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,010
This...

1083
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,720
Hey, Futaba. Makinohara's puberty syndrome
is still ongoing, isn't it?

1084
01:10:56,770 --> 01:11:02,060
It's Makinohara in fourth grade that's writing and
erasing on that printout, right?

1085
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:08,110
Makinohara from three years ago
is worried about her future.

1086
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:11,530
And that's causing
the puberty syndrome, isn't it?

1087
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:15,410
Do you understand
what you're saying, Azusagawa?

1088
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:20,120
Right now, we're not in the "present,"
but rather the "future."

1089
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:26,300
So if we can save the present,
the Makinohara who is in fourth grade,

1090
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,610
won't we also be able to save
the current Makinohara that's in seventh grade?

1091
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:34,950
This is way different from avoiding
a traffic accident from happening.

1092
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:38,680
As for illnesses, it's not like
the conditions improve by simply restarting.

1093
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:43,610
Toyohama said she saw a dream
where Mai-san got into a traffic accident.

1094
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:49,220
Does this mean that memories could be passed
to others who are indirectly involved?

1095
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,570
I had a similar dream myself...

1096
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:55,080
One where I brought home
a stunned Azusagawa from his place.

1097
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:56,360
Then...

1098
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:02,730
But even if pieces of current Azusagawa's memories
could be sent to Azusagawa from three years ago,

1099
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:04,250
I don't think anything would change.

1100
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:06,860
You can't change things. Besides...

1101
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,760
Besides?

1102
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:13,220
Even if you were able to change the past,
and Shoko could overcome her illness...

1103
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:16,100
Would you really be fine with that?

1104
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:22,000
If the fourth-grade Shoko
doesn't develop puberty syndrome,

1105
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,570
that means you'll never meet Shoko-san
at Shichirigahama Beach, doesn't it?

1106
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:33,850
If you never met her, you never would
have applied for Minegahara High,

1107
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,030
and you would never have met Kunimi or I.

1108
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:38,910
And you'd never
come across Sakurajima-senpai.

1109
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,750
Are you saying you'd be fine with that?

1110
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:44,530
Of course it's not fine. But...

1111
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:50,760
Will you risk all of your precious memories
for a small chance that you're not even sure exists?

1112
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:59,020
DECEMBER 31ST

1113
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,940
Yes, Azusagawa here.

1114
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:07,060
Hello, this is Makinohara.

1115
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,690
Mrs. Makinohara...

1116
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:13,360
Um... Could you come visit Shoko?

1117
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:15,240
Is something wrong?

1118
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:20,200
The doctor says she won't last much longer...

1119
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:43,430
You know, Mai-san...

1120
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,520
I really do want to save Makinohara after all.

1121
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,810
Yeah, I know that.

1122
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,440
It's fine if you want to go ahead and do so.
You can change the past.

1123
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:57,450
It's okay if everything that
has happened until now is all wiped out.

1124
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,660
Mai-san...

1125
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:03,330
You promised me that day, right?
That the two of us will become happy together.

1126
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:08,420
We're only taking a slight detour
so we can fulfill that promise.

1127
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:11,190
Yeah, just a little bit.

1128
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:15,130
It's just forgetting everything,
and then starting over from the beginning again.

1129
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:18,550
You're right. That's all there is to it.

1130
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:21,550
From there, I'll meet you once again.

1131
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:22,450
Yup.

1132
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:24,860
And fall in love with you once again.

1133
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:25,640
Yup.

1134
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,310
And you'll confess your love to me once again.

1135
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:35,220
I'll make sure to find you again, Mai-san.

1136
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,700
When you do, we'll become happy together.

1137
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,620
I promise you.

1138
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:52,630
Shoko, Azusagawa is here to see you.

1139
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:04,020
Makinohara...

1140
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:11,610
You kept your promise...
That you'd come visit every day.

1141
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:14,030
I heard from Mom.

1142
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,110
There were days I couldn't
because of work, though.

1143
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:19,580
Thank you very much.

1144
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:24,870
You know, about that future plans
printout you wanted advice for...

1145
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:29,960
Sakuta-san, I've been having a long dream.

1146
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:33,210
It was a strange dream.

1147
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:42,220
I was in high school, teasing and cheering
you on at the Shichirigahama Beach.

1148
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:48,550
Then I was in college,
and I was staying over at your place,

1149
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:52,440
making meals and cleaning in the dream.

1150
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:57,510
We also went to a chapel with an ocean view.

1151
01:15:57,510 --> 01:16:03,500
I put on a wedding dress,
and you blushed as you complimented me.

1152
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:08,760
It was so fun that I could spend my days
with you like that, even in a dream.

1153
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,650
It wasn't a dream, Makinohara.

1154
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,760
It really was fun.

1155
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,880
You're wrong. Those all really happened.

1156
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:22,220
I know that, Sakuta-kun.

1157
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:28,280
I know it all now. That it was my real future.

1158
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:32,720
That right now is the "future."
I understand it all now.

1159
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,930
That's right... That's right.

1160
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:40,070
That's why, if we change the past,
we might still find a way to save you.

1161
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:46,530
Even if you redo the past,
it will be hard to cure my illness.

1162
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:54,790
But, I think it's possible to save you
from the sadness that torments you now.

1163
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:56,460
What are you saying?

1164
01:16:56,790 --> 01:17:02,300
I know it all now.
I was causing you agony, wasn't I?

1165
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:06,360
You're wrong. It's not your fault at all.

1166
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:13,050
You and I first met
because of my puberty syndrome...

1167
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:17,150
I've never regretted even once that I met you.

1168
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:21,740
You really put in a valiant effort, Sakuta-san.

1169
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,450
So, it's all right now.

1170
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:29,950
I will redo this properly now...

1171
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:34,960
To create a future where I never meet you...

1172
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:42,050
To reach a future where
you don't have to be in sorrow.

1173
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:45,020
No, that's not it.

1174
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,270
That's not what I meant to say.

1175
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:50,390
It's all right to redo things
for your sake, Makinohara.

1176
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,640
Please leave everything to me...

1177
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:58,200
I'll be sure to make you happy, Sakuta-san...

1178
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,060
So...

1179
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,160
Makinohara? Makinohara?

1180
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:11,540
How's Shoko?

1181
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:14,130
She's asleep for now.

1182
01:18:14,130 --> 01:18:15,000
I see...

1183
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:18,790
Sakuta, look at this.

1184
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:27,590
I WILL LIVE ON, CHERISHING THE PHRASES "THANK YOU,"
YOU DID YOUR BEST," AND "I LOVE YOU."

1185
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:27,590
SOMEDAY, I WANT TO BE A KIND PERSON.

1186
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:30,050
What's up with this...

1187
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:32,960
Why...

1188
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,140
I just heard from Shoko's mother.

1189
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,480
Yesterday, she suddenly mentioned
how she wanted to finish the homework.

1190
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:43,530
What should I do?

1191
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:47,700
What can I do to save Makinohara?

1192
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:52,490
Makinohara knew everything all along.

1193
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:59,420
About Shoko-san, about herself,
and how she could change the past.

1194
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:05,590
I'm sorry, Sakuta. This is all I can think of.

1195
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:10,430
Shoko gave tremendous effort for this.

1196
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:15,680
So, you should finish
Shoko's homework for her.

1197
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:18,390
Please compliment Shoko for her efforts.

1198
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,270
I...

1199
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,740
It's the new year...

1200
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,780
PRESENT
GRADUATE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
GRADUATE MIDDLE SCHOOL
CHALLENGE MYSELF TO CAKE-BAKING IN HIGH SCHOOL

1201
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,560
Ma'am, I'm done!

1202
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,910
- Me too!
- Me too!

1203
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,290
I'm done!

1204
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:52,050
JANUARY 6TH

1205
01:21:57,890 --> 01:22:00,110
Big Brother, it's morning.

1206
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:02,380
It's still winter break.

1207
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:05,190
You're the one who said
your part-time job starts again today.

1208
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:08,650
Are you practicing going back to school now?

1209
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,580
I already did.

1210
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:13,900
I'm still really nervous,
but I got to the school gates.

1211
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:20,010
Morning.

1212
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:23,270
Morning. Did you run away from home?

1213
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:24,830
I already ran away from home.

1214
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:28,170
I got a small gig at a shopping mall
in Saitama today!

1215
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:32,480
Sakuta, it's unusual for you
to work a morning shift.

1216
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,500
And you, what happened to your team practice?

1217
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,990
Doesn't start till afternoon.

1218
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:37,830
Koga, are you showing up late like a boss?

1219
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:39,640
This is the shift I signed up for!

1220
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:41,840
Wh-What?

1221
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,730
Well, you know, Koga, did you balloon up?

1222
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:47,850
Did you get mochi skin after eating
so much mochi over the new year holiday?

1223
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:49,730
Senpai, you really piss me off.

1224
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:51,400
Supa pissed!

1225
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:54,110
Welcome!

1226
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:59,390
I'll have the hearty carbonara...

1227
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:02,330
Wait, make it this one instead.

1228
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:06,410
You don't have to go on a drastic diet, Futaba.
You haven't really ballooned out...

1229
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,830
Oh, I see.

1230
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,630
I'll inform Sakurajima-senpai that
you were giving me lewd looks.

1231
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:16,160
I'm going on the new year's shrine
visit date after work.

1232
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,780
She'll totally scold me, so please keep quiet.

1233
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:21,010
That means it's better if I tell her, doesn't it?

1234
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:22,100
Well...

1235
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:25,270
Nothing less from you, Azusagawa.
Such a rascal.

1236
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,480
Oh...

1237
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,340
What?

1238
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:38,070
Mai-san, can you lend me some change?

1239
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:41,550
I donated at Fujisawa Station on the way,
so I don't have change.

1240
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:43,160
Then, use a bill.

1241
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,460
Were you able to make a wish
worth the 1,000 yen?

1242
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:58,060
I wished to not encounter so many
strange incidents in the upcoming year.

1243
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:00,050
Strange incidents, huh?

1244
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:03,260
But, you were able to meet me
because of one.

1245
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:06,850
I've had my fill of wild bunny girls.

1246
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,620
You really love the ocean, don't you?

1247
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,900
Though I love you the most.

1248
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,280
So you love the high-school girl
that appeared in your dreams that much...

1249
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:24,010
This is the spot where you two went
on many dates, wasn't it?

1250
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:26,120
Though they were all in my dreams.

1251
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:29,200
You love this place too, don't you?

1252
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:34,250
For me, I'm attached to this place
because I filmed here.

1253
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:39,090
A girl with a heart disease awaiting a donor.

1254
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:45,800
SPRING COMES, WINTER LEAVES
[YOU GAVE ME A FUTURE.]
MAI SAKURAJIMA - SHO FURUTA - MARI TANAKA

1255
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:43,730
When I first received the offer,
I felt that I just had to play this role.

1256
01:24:43,730 --> 01:24:45,550
I bawled my eyes out watching the film.

1257
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:48,740
Everyone else in the theater was crying, too.

1258
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:53,560
I don't know why I felt
like I really wanted to play the role.

1259
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:56,230
But I wanted to do something.

1260
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:58,610
It's like how you donate money, Sakuta.

1261
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:00,990
THIS WAY TO SHICHIRIGAHAMA STATION

1262
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:04,050
If you run that much, it's dangerous!

1263
01:25:04,050 --> 01:25:05,730
Watch your step!

1264
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:07,590
It's fine, it's fine!

1265
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:11,410
Dad, Mom, hurry up! Over here!

1266
01:25:13,290 --> 01:25:14,290
Sakuta?

1267
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:16,080
That girl...

1268
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:18,460
Hurry up!

1269
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:21,510
Someone you know?

1270
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:24,430
No...

1271
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:39,610
Makinohara!

1272
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,540
Yes, Sakuta-san!

1272
01:25:54,305 --> 01:26:54,527
