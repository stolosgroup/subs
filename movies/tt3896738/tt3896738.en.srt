2
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:10,863
- Hey, love, do you want a lift?
- No, it's okay. I'm not far.

3
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,259
Don't be silly. You'll cook out there.

4
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,670
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, jump in.

5
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,930
Get yourself bloody sun stroke out there.

6
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:22,669
- It's so hot.
- Stuff walking?

7
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:25,839
- Thanks so much for the lift.
- No worries.

8
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,842
- Netball?
- Yeah, I just came from there.

9
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:04,720
W-E-E...

10
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,314
...D.

11
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,396
- Got any weed?
- Hint?

12
00:04:10,473 --> 00:04:12,606
No, I told you, Dave's in Bali.

13
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:14,840
Shit, I promised Shell.

14
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,636
Hey, I did that other thing for you, but...

15
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:19,516
What other thing?

16
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:30,593
"Compare the role of Atticus
to aunt Alexandra...

17
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,308
"...in the shaping of scout's outlook.
Essay by Vicki Maloney."

18
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:36,157
Come on!

19
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:56,081
Dad'll get suss.

20
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,722
Right, later, gator. I'll see you Sunday.

21
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:09,127
If you want to be a total stud, my next
assignment is on Wuthering Heights.

22
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:11,017
I'm just saying.

23
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,330
Tell your dad happy birthday from me.

24
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,333
All right, see ya.

25
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:55,922
Hello, my darling!
You miss mummy? Come on in.

26
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,933
Lou-Lou. Come in, Lou-Lou.

27
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,736
Come on, Lou-Lou darling. Yes, yes.

28
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:19,593
Come then, what reason have you
to be morose? You're rich enough.

29
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,828
Bah, humbug!

30
00:07:22,905 --> 00:07:26,961
- Don't be cross, uncle.
- What else can I be?

31
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,136
Out upon a merry Christmas.

32
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:32,502
If I could work my will, every idiot

33
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,713
...who goes about with
"Merry Christmas" on his lips...

34
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,108
...should be boiled in his own pudding...

35
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:42,337
...then buried with a stake
of Holly through his heart...

36
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:43,929
Breakfast.

37
00:07:57,884 --> 00:08:00,787
He swam there all the time
and conditions weren't rough.

38
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:05,207
Some people thought it was a shark.
Others thought murder, suicide.

39
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:09,115
Some of the crazier theories
were that he was taken by a UFO...

40
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:12,158
...or picked up by a Chinese submarine.

41
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:17,082
People couldn't believe that
the prime minister could just disappear.

42
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:28,069
I've spoken to your mother. She's worried.

43
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:33,674
I know that it's hard, okay?
My parents divorced when I was 11.

44
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,839
Can I go now, miss?

45
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,651
Yep.

46
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:02,971
Oh, my God.

47
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:05,130
Hi!

48
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:08,974
- Really?
- Yeah.

49
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:20,714
I just thought it'd be nice
if we went out as a family.

50
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,317
We've been through this.
It's not appropriate right now.

51
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:25,580
- I need some space.
- Not space, Maggie.

52
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:28,794
I'm talking about one night out.
Think about Vicki. She's got exams.

53
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:31,490
What, you think I don't know that, Trev?
Things have changed.

54
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:34,080
- You need money.
- I don't need your money.

55
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:38,459
I need you to respect my decision
and let me live the life that I want to live.

56
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:49,190
Thought you liked spag bol.

57
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:57,807
Hey, I got us Grease on video to watch.

58
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:03,861
I'm going to a party.

59
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,793
Planning on asking me?

60
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,628
Well, I'm just assuming you'll need a lift.

61
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:12,893
Dad gave me money for a taxi.

62
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,941
You know, I see you two nights a week.

63
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,536
Not my fault.

64
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,354
- Sweetheart...
- What?

65
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:33,029
Anyway, how's your essay coming along?

66
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:55,648
- Aunt Alexandra in the shaping of scout's...
- I can read it myself.

67
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:06,235
So who wrote it?

68
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:08,020
Jay?

69
00:15:09,194 --> 00:15:12,821
I mean, how can I let you go out,
sweetheart, when you do things like this?

70
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:15,099
You're not going. You can stay home.

71
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,376
Why are you trying so hard to ruin my life?

72
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:21,262
- You'll thank me later.
- For what? Leaving Dad?

73
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,642
I'm trying to give you
every opportunity that I can.

74
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:27,208
What, so I can become a strong,
independent woman like you?

75
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:36,074
Show us your whizza!

76
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:07,952
Where you off to?

77
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,538
- Just a party.
- Yeah?

78
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,037
Don't suppose you want something to smoke?

79
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,428
Do you a stick for a tenner?

80
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,882
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

81
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:29,223
Oh, shit, no.
So, Simmo must have got the last one.

82
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,439
Bloody idiot! Why didn't ya
bloody say something?

83
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:34,059
- No worries. Thanks anyway.
- We've got more at home.

84
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:36,686
- We're just one street that way.
- I should probably get going.

85
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:39,333
- Yeah, all right then.
- All right. Have a good night.

86
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,557
Sorry. Do you know which way the highway is?

87
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:49,019
- Yeah. You chasing a taxi?
- Yep.

88
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,836
Yeah, if you just go straight...

89
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:52,635
- ...for three streets.
- Yep.

90
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:55,649
Take a left, walk to the end of the road
and you should find one there.

91
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:58,211
- Thank you. Bye.
- Yeah, no worries.

92
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:00,166
Hey, you sure?

93
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:03,464
Bloody good stuff. I mean,
you're more than welcome to call a cab...

94
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,627
...from our place too, if you like.
It's totally fine.

95
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:19,279
- Yeah, all right.
- All right, jump on in.

96
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,759
- Got enough room there?
- Yeah.

97
00:19:25,836 --> 00:19:28,610
All righty. I'm John.

98
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,237
This here's my queen, Evie.

99
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:32,870
- Hey.
- How're you going, love?

100
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:35,465
- Nice to meet ya.
- Good, I'm Vicki.

101
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:39,267
- Vicki. Hey, Vicki.
- Nice to meet you, Vicki Vick.

102
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:01,978
Home sweet home.

103
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,423
I'll just wait here.

104
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:10,658
- Yeah, all right.
- Sweet as a bag of salt.

105
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:21,555
So how long you two been together?

106
00:20:21,632 --> 00:20:26,300
Oh, God, I've been with him
since I was, like, 13.

107
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:28,285
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know.

108
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:29,598
- Wow.
- Yeah.

109
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:32,289
- How many kids have you got?
- I got two.

110
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:33,827
- They're not his kids, though.
- Right.

111
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:36,485
Yeah, we split for a bit,
so they don't live here yet.

112
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:39,841
But they're gonna soon,
so that'll be good. Yeah.

113
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:45,297
Want a smoke, love?

114
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,473
- You sure?
- Yeah.

115
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:48,850
Thanks.

116
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:51,123
Hey! Lou-Lou!

117
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,982
Calm down. Settle. Settle, darling.

118
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,648
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

119
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:58,011
She looks really mean.
She's just a big sook, aren't ya, huh?

120
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:01,855
Aren't ya? Aren't ya, sweetheart? Yeah.
She won't bite you. Lou-Lou!

121
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:04,793
- Hi, Lou-Lou.
- John got her for me.

122
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,172
My dad actually just got me a puppy.

123
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:09,481
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

124
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:12,298
He reckons it's really dogs that tamed us.

125
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,543
Yeah, that'd be right.
You tamed me, didn't you?

126
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:16,141
- Hon?
- Yeah?

127
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:18,768
I just got the message
to call Mark about them tools.

128
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,690
- All right.
- Sorry, Vic, won't be a sec.

129
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:22,835
- That's okay.
- Why don't you girls...

130
00:21:22,912 --> 00:21:24,889
...have a quick drink or something?

131
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:27,352
Do you want a quickie?

132
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:31,068
- No, I should probably get going.
- You sure? Put you in the party mood.

133
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:32,158
Yeah.

134
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:35,359
I mean, I've only got Goon,
but do you drink Goon?

135
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:38,114
Yeah, I do drink it.

136
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:43,019
I mean, just one.

137
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:46,635
Come on, let's have a drink.

138
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:48,942
- All right, yeah.
- Yeah? All right, let's go.

139
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:51,603
Lou-Lou, you be good. No barking.

140
00:21:57,394 --> 00:22:00,696
Do you mind, just taking
your shoes off? Yeah? Thanks.

141
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:04,894
Just make yourself at home.
I'll get the drinks.

142
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,466
Thanks.

143
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:15,400
- So, cheers.
- Cheers.

144
00:22:15,477 --> 00:22:18,254
- To a good night, huh?
- To a good night.

145
00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:35,452
- Sorry about that.
- No, that's all right.

146
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:37,275
- Nothing's ever easy, is it?
- No.

147
00:22:37,352 --> 00:22:40,322
You want a quick cone before you scoot?

148
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:44,037
No, it's all right.
My friend's waiting for me.

149
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:48,333
You don't wanna check that we didn't rip
you off with grass clippings or something?

150
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,996
Just a tenner, Vic?

151
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:01,069
Sorry.

152
00:23:52,757 --> 00:23:54,731
Are you all right there, Vic?

153
00:23:55,096 --> 00:23:56,624
Yeah.

154
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:08,516
Pleasure doing business with you.

155
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:15,584
Nah. Back door, love.

156
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:17,861
They always go to the back door.

157
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:24,813
- You all right, sweetie-pie?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

158
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:35,444
Fuck, I love you.

159
00:27:56,681 --> 00:27:58,178
Vicki?

160
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,991
Vic!

161
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:15,699
Little shit.

162
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:18,486
Come on, Gizmo.

163
00:28:22,787 --> 00:28:24,604
Oh, okay.

164
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:27,068
She must have stayed at Shell's.

165
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:31,005
Look, I'll get her to give you a call
when I track her down, okay?

166
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,842
Because I said she couldn't go.

167
00:28:35,056 --> 00:28:37,449
Sorry, have you seen her grades lately?

168
00:28:40,372 --> 00:28:43,083
I don't know, Trevor.
I'm sure it wasn't a girls only sleepover.

169
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,634
Look, when you find her,
just let me know, okay? See ya.

170
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:56,060
Breakfast!

171
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:12,199
Hello, you.

172
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:16,203
Everything okay?

173
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:29,946
Oh, for fuck's sake! Evie!

174
00:30:31,972 --> 00:30:34,405
- I only just let her in...
- Honestly, how do you expect...

175
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:36,989
...to look after kids when you
can't control one fucking dog?

176
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:38,911
- Sorry. Fuck it, I'm sorry.
- Fix it! It's putrid.

177
00:30:38,988 --> 00:30:41,317
I'm sorry. Shit.

178
00:31:57,242 --> 00:31:58,770
Hungry?

179
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:12,217
How about some water, then?

180
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,736
What do you want from me?

181
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,910
I just wanna get you cleaned up
and more comfortable, is all.

182
00:33:21,486 --> 00:33:23,012
Oi!

183
00:33:23,665 --> 00:33:25,673
Remember I'm not stupid.

184
00:33:32,617 --> 00:33:35,154
Please, my dad is a surgeon. He has money.

185
00:33:36,637 --> 00:33:38,354
Yeah, we know.

186
00:33:38,431 --> 00:33:40,180
Why do you think we picked ya?

187
00:33:40,257 --> 00:33:42,070
So you've called him?

188
00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:44,540
All you have to worry about...

189
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:48,221
...is not trying anything stupid, all right?

190
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,586
You do that,
you and I'll get along just fine.

191
00:33:53,117 --> 00:33:54,934
Try anything...

192
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,267
...tuck.

193
00:34:13,569 --> 00:34:16,091
Is he the reason why your kids aren't here?

194
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:25,642
He's the reason I've... I've got food
on the table and a roof over my head.

195
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:33,069
How long your parents been married for?

196
00:34:35,352 --> 00:34:38,476
- Couple of years before I was born.
- Still happy?

197
00:34:41,374 --> 00:34:43,896
Maybe they just stayed together for you.

198
00:35:08,216 --> 00:35:09,649
Shit.

199
00:35:16,737 --> 00:35:20,377
I'm sorry. I won't do it again, I promise.

200
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:23,528
Oh, no, God. Please.

201
00:35:24,937 --> 00:35:26,864
How about a nice bath?

202
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:30,593
I won't be needing this, will I?

203
00:36:05,553 --> 00:36:08,136
Hey, jockey John!

204
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:12,877
Haven't seen you down in Leopold
for a bit. Been worried about ya.

205
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:15,312
Yeah, you know how it is.
The missus and that.

206
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:17,909
Missus got you driving her
to house calls now?

207
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,433
Give us a fag.

208
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,333
Thanks, mate.

209
00:36:32,332 --> 00:36:33,826
You got my money?

210
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:36,901
Thought you said next week.

211
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:39,496
I dropped them buds off about
five weeks ago, don't you reckon?

212
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:41,388
Yeah, fucking reckon.

213
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,902
Yeah... yeah, I'll get it.
Just don't have it at the moment.

214
00:36:46,363 --> 00:36:50,065
- How about tomorrow?
- Yeah. Definitely.

215
00:36:51,873 --> 00:36:54,042
Don't make me look like a fucking asshole.

216
00:36:58,535 --> 00:37:00,352
He smokes?

217
00:37:40,336 --> 00:37:42,538
You're gonna write a letter to your parents.

218
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:49,616
Say school's too much, you've met a bloke
and he's got you a ticket to Adelaide.

219
00:37:53,181 --> 00:37:55,127
I thought this was a ransom?

220
00:37:56,768 --> 00:37:59,515
Yeah... it is.

221
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:20,331
- Can I write it to my boyfriend?
- Where were you last night?

222
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,350
I was at my mum's.

223
00:38:22,715 --> 00:38:26,068
Mum's, or mum and dad's?

224
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,713
So they are split. I didn't think a fucking
surgeon would live around here.

225
00:38:34,406 --> 00:38:36,800
She leave him or he kick her out?

226
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:41,729
She left.

227
00:38:41,998 --> 00:38:44,066
Right, write it to your mum.

228
00:38:44,143 --> 00:38:47,207
- Say that you love her.
- I don't.

229
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,227
She left me.

230
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:54,962
Say that you love her.

231
00:38:57,325 --> 00:38:59,527
Say that you understand why she left.

232
00:39:01,217 --> 00:39:04,098
And that you're happy,
she's making a life for herself.

233
00:39:06,726 --> 00:39:09,697
And you want to do the same,
that's why you're moving to Adelaide.

234
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:15,595
Say that she inspires you.

235
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:21,661
Pick up the pen.

236
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,421
Good girl.

237
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:02,610
Go.

238
00:41:04,251 --> 00:41:06,229
I need to go to the toilet.

239
00:41:09,313 --> 00:41:10,810
Please.

240
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,773
What's going on here?

241
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:35,855
She has to go.

242
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,088
Well...

243
00:41:40,003 --> 00:41:42,008
...why don't you relax...

244
00:41:44,163 --> 00:41:45,949
...and I'll take her?

245
00:41:47,944 --> 00:41:49,933
Have a cone.

246
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:01,418
- I'm so sorry about before.
- It's okay.

247
00:42:01,495 --> 00:42:04,811
- No, I'm an idiot.
- No, it's okay.

248
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:06,545
Go on.

249
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:11,799
All right.

250
00:42:20,392 --> 00:42:21,972
Ladies first.

251
00:44:20,256 --> 00:44:21,881
John?

252
00:44:26,182 --> 00:44:27,999
Why'd you lock the door?

253
00:44:30,282 --> 00:44:32,099
Didn't know I did.

254
00:44:38,962 --> 00:44:41,421
Hang on, hang on, hang on. Just get the...

255
00:45:06,094 --> 00:45:09,063
- Come on, come on.
- No, no, no, no.

256
00:45:16,344 --> 00:45:19,346
Fucking window! Get around the front!

257
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,669
Fuck it!

258
00:45:35,948 --> 00:45:37,732
Fucking hell!

259
00:45:43,603 --> 00:45:45,578
Fuck it! Fuck!

260
00:45:45,654 --> 00:45:48,591
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- Fuck it.

261
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:51,474
Stay!

262
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:55,954
- Evie!
- Help!

263
00:46:59,743 --> 00:47:02,456
Stop! Help!

264
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:24,203
John! What's going on? I know you are there!

265
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,774
Get him to fuck off!

266
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,531
- Maybe he heard her.
- Ya think?

267
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,163
John!

268
00:47:41,546 --> 00:47:43,874
John, open the bloody door.

269
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,363
What the hell is going on?

270
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,213
Sorry, just fucking had a bit
too much to drink, ya know.

271
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,552
- It's not even lunchtime.
- Yeah, I know.

272
00:47:52,629 --> 00:47:54,605
When's this shit gonna stop?

273
00:47:55,446 --> 00:47:58,542
What do you say I get Evie
to piss off for a bit...

274
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:01,430
...and you and me can pick up
where we left off?

275
00:48:02,077 --> 00:48:03,539
Yeah?

276
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,062
We were just having a blue, ya know?
Fuck, I've heard you.

277
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:10,458
We yell. We don't scream for fucking help.

278
00:48:11,245 --> 00:48:12,732
Hey.

279
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:14,654
Doesn't have to be like this.

280
00:48:14,731 --> 00:48:16,676
See, me and Evie, we...

281
00:48:18,317 --> 00:48:20,324
...we usually do it together.

282
00:48:20,785 --> 00:48:25,268
But there is just something about you
that makes me want you all to myself.

283
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:29,389
Yeah, the whole fucking street
should mind their own bloody business.

284
00:48:29,466 --> 00:48:32,464
Yeah? Well, I'll tell you what.
I'll make it my fucking business.

285
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:35,638
Anyone's dumb enough
to let them kids back here again.

286
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:38,486
- Fuck off.
- John, come out here.

287
00:48:38,563 --> 00:48:40,856
- Stop hiding behind your missus.
- I said fuck off!

288
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:43,768
John! Come and face me,
ya fucking weak piece of shit!

289
00:48:43,845 --> 00:48:45,889
Piss off, you fuck!

290
00:48:47,146 --> 00:48:48,896
What the fuck do you know?

291
00:48:48,973 --> 00:48:52,470
- Good luck to ya. I'm calling the cops.
- Fucking call the cops. I bet they'd like...

292
00:48:52,547 --> 00:48:55,335
...to know about the fucking boot-load of
video players I saw ya bring in last week.

293
00:48:55,412 --> 00:48:56,969
You're an embarrassment.

294
00:48:57,046 --> 00:49:00,940
Just keep it fucking down and stop
going through my fucking mail.

295
00:49:01,017 --> 00:49:03,154
Lick my ass, you dog!

296
00:49:28,371 --> 00:49:30,153
She's here.

297
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:32,495
Take her hand.

298
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:38,325
Hang on.

299
00:49:42,755 --> 00:49:44,539
Come on.

300
00:49:49,096 --> 00:49:50,849
Shut the fuck up.

301
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,362
Fuck you!

302
00:49:59,346 --> 00:50:01,493
Fuck you!

303
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,149
I'm so sorry.

304
00:51:07,575 --> 00:51:10,283
I'm gonna lie down.

305
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:14,399
Go and pick us up some headache pills.

306
00:51:14,974 --> 00:51:17,900
- Drop her thing off while you're out.
- John.

307
00:51:25,705 --> 00:51:27,489
I love you.

308
00:51:38,741 --> 00:51:41,709
- What was that?
- I love you.

309
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:50,439
Well, how'd you feel
if you never saw me again?

310
00:51:56,328 --> 00:51:59,645
That's exactly what would have happened
if she'd have got out that window.

311
00:52:07,507 --> 00:52:09,324
Fix that shit up.

312
00:52:38,017 --> 00:52:40,706
What were the circumstances
of the separation?

313
00:52:41,813 --> 00:52:44,733
Just that if there was violence.
Or if one of you was involved...

314
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:46,796
...with someone else,
it could be a contributing factor.

315
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:49,073
No, it wasn't anything like that.

316
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:51,990
I mean, lots of kids' parents separate.

317
00:52:53,858 --> 00:52:58,654
All I'm saying is, we see kids run off
from situations like this every day.

318
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,167
Did you check for a note?

319
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:07,591
No, she didn't leave a note.
She just had pillows under her sheets.

320
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:11,440
Well, there you go. She's probably just
had a big night and is sleeping it off.

321
00:53:11,517 --> 00:53:14,474
- I mean, you were teenagers once.
- Yeah, but this is not like her.

322
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:18,039
I've spoken to her friends, her boyfriend.
I mean, no one's heard from her.

323
00:53:18,116 --> 00:53:22,386
Please, try and relax. 99% of the time,
these things sort themselves out.

324
00:53:22,463 --> 00:53:26,357
- If she's not back by Monday...
- Monday? I mean, she's...

325
00:53:27,394 --> 00:53:31,835
- What about those girls down there?
- Mrs. Maloney, we're not in New York.

326
00:53:31,912 --> 00:53:35,820
Those girls, all runaways,
all with stories just like this one.

327
00:53:35,897 --> 00:53:37,857
Now, I've got kids. I feel for you.

328
00:53:37,934 --> 00:53:40,996
But trust me,
I've been doing this a long time.

329
00:53:41,073 --> 00:53:46,048
Now, hard as it might be, what I need you
to do is stay home and wait this out.

330
00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:49,453
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll pass around a description of her...

331
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:52,111
...and if I hear of anything,
I'll let you know.

332
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:54,962
Otherwise, come back Monday.

333
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,980
I'll eat my hat if you do.

334
00:53:57,345 --> 00:53:59,289
She's not a runaway.

335
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:40,643
In the letterbox.

336
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:47,495
This just doesn't make sense,
the way it's written.

337
00:54:47,571 --> 00:54:49,770
She just wouldn't have said this.

338
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:52,491
Well, maybe she's trying
to make you feel guilty.

339
00:54:52,568 --> 00:54:55,294
- Would you stop putting this on me, Trevor.
- She's never snuck out before.

340
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:59,667
She's never had to. Whatever she did,
you just let her get away with it.

341
00:55:00,032 --> 00:55:03,962
- I only ever wanted the best for both of you.
- I know you did, Trev.

342
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,685
Then come home.

343
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:12,030
You just don't get it, do you?

344
00:55:12,107 --> 00:55:16,900
Get what? That our daughter's run away
because you put yourself before our family?

345
00:55:16,977 --> 00:55:18,533
Get out.

346
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:22,145
- We just want you back.
- I'm not coming back. I'm sorry.

347
00:55:22,784 --> 00:55:24,559
I'm not coming back.

348
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,462
I can see why Vicki hates it here.

349
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:56,396
Center, ahead and... Eleanor,
nice to have you with us.

350
00:55:56,473 --> 00:55:59,170
Ladies and gentlemen, here's Kerry Flynn!

351
00:57:10,145 --> 00:57:13,083
- Could I just get the usual, thanks?
- Sure.

352
00:57:20,684 --> 00:57:23,045
- There you go.
- Thank you.

353
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,726
Thank you.

354
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:36,751
Hi. Can I just get
some headache pills, please?

355
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,353
Yeah.

356
00:57:39,197 --> 00:57:41,912
That'll be, 79 cents for that one.

357
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,451
Look at me.

358
00:57:56,912 --> 00:57:58,665
Look at me.

359
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:03,533
Fuck!

360
00:58:07,546 --> 00:58:09,872
Fucking shat on me!

361
00:58:10,429 --> 00:58:12,599
Jesus! Fuck!

362
00:58:31,603 --> 00:58:35,829
No, just for a couple of hours next week
so I can give them their presents?

363
00:58:36,792 --> 00:58:39,951
I don't know, the park or something.
You can come if you have to.

364
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:42,164
It's... Mick.

365
00:58:43,998 --> 00:58:48,245
Mick. Mick, can you just put Kim
on the phone just for two seconds?

366
00:58:49,348 --> 00:58:50,877
Fuck!

367
00:58:53,672 --> 00:58:56,641
You got something
you wanna fucking say to me?

368
00:58:57,197 --> 00:59:00,102
Fucking kids! My fucking kids.

369
01:02:58,252 --> 01:03:00,234
What happened while I was out?

370
01:03:04,867 --> 01:03:06,685
What do you think?

371
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,697
He just uses you.

372
01:03:23,189 --> 01:03:25,465
That's why he got you the dog.

373
01:03:27,418 --> 01:03:30,741
It's a replacement for your kids.
He doesn't want them here.

374
01:03:32,286 --> 01:03:34,023
He doesn't love you.

375
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:41,180
Let me go.

376
01:03:41,257 --> 01:03:43,586
I'll tell them it was all him.

377
01:05:13,091 --> 01:05:14,906
It's not Monday.

378
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:16,859
If you love me...

379
01:05:17,896 --> 01:05:20,030
...you fucking kill her tonight.

380
01:05:20,107 --> 01:05:21,635
No.

381
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:33,135
It's her or it's fucking me!

382
01:05:44,995 --> 01:05:46,812
So do it.

383
01:05:53,273 --> 01:05:55,429
What the fuck are you waiting for?

384
01:06:05,752 --> 01:06:07,085
You were naked.

385
01:06:07,162 --> 01:06:10,227
- No. No, no, no.
- Yes.

386
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,470
I was in there...

387
01:06:14,624 --> 01:06:16,824
...and I was getting her ready for us...

388
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,642
...and then she goes and shits herself...

389
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:22,237
- You lie. You lie.
- And it was...

390
01:06:22,314 --> 01:06:26,049
You lie. You fucking lie. You lie!
You fucking lie all the time!

391
01:06:26,126 --> 01:06:30,021
Evelyn, you're letting
your imagination run away with you.

392
01:06:30,098 --> 01:06:32,648
You are. Just... just...

393
01:06:33,973 --> 01:06:38,893
...just for me, for you,
take one look in that washing machine.

394
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:40,466
Please.

395
01:06:48,259 --> 01:06:50,012
What about Kim?

396
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:52,815
What about Kim?

397
01:06:58,637 --> 01:07:00,614
You think that was me?

398
01:07:03,826 --> 01:07:05,643
Oh, darling.

399
01:07:07,013 --> 01:07:10,880
You know I loved them kids
like they were my own.

400
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:13,874
You know that.

401
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:17,976
You lie.

402
01:07:21,796 --> 01:07:24,702
If you don't believe me,
go check out the washing machine.

403
01:07:31,405 --> 01:07:33,191
Wait here.

404
01:08:28,278 --> 01:08:30,223
You done something different?

405
01:08:33,531 --> 01:08:35,317
You look beautiful.

406
01:08:37,552 --> 01:08:39,551
Just like you did the day we met.

407
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:43,757
Remember?

408
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:49,370
I came over and asked you about them bruises?

409
01:08:50,045 --> 01:08:52,983
You told me,
I went and slashed the prick's tires.

410
01:08:55,938 --> 01:08:58,875
He thought it was them chinks
across the road, didn't he?

411
01:09:03,338 --> 01:09:06,274
I've done everything I can
for you ever since.

412
01:09:08,751 --> 01:09:10,696
Got you away from your dad.

413
01:09:11,794 --> 01:09:13,739
That fat mongrel, Mick.

414
01:09:19,898 --> 01:09:21,651
I'm sorry.

415
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,904
She's putting all kinds of shit in my head.

416
01:09:26,017 --> 01:09:28,154
Saying that you just use me.

417
01:09:30,724 --> 01:09:33,660
That you just got me Lou-Lou
as a replacement for the kids.

418
01:09:35,146 --> 01:09:37,315
I don't know what the fuck to believe.

419
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:53,939
It's okay.

420
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,958
Please, can we get rid of her?

421
01:10:00,803 --> 01:10:04,662
- Monday.
- I know, I know.

422
01:10:05,896 --> 01:10:07,662
We'll get another one.

423
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:11,746
Just not her. Please, not her.

424
01:10:11,823 --> 01:10:14,024
- She has to go. Please.
- No.

425
01:10:14,101 --> 01:10:16,519
No, no, no, no, it'd be bad luck...

426
01:10:16,596 --> 01:10:18,525
...if we do things different.

427
01:10:26,332 --> 01:10:28,118
I'll tell you what.

428
01:10:29,503 --> 01:10:31,301
How about...

429
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,321
...you and I...

430
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:38,108
...go in there right now...

431
01:10:38,569 --> 01:10:40,770
...and show her who's running the show?

432
01:10:45,712 --> 01:10:47,525
Come on, Evie.

433
01:10:48,082 --> 01:10:49,864
That's why she's here.

434
01:10:50,517 --> 01:10:52,304
Let's make the most of her.

435
01:10:53,431 --> 01:10:54,928
Together.

436
01:10:56,026 --> 01:10:57,779
Like we always do.

437
01:10:59,293 --> 01:11:01,463
You think she's prettier than me...

438
01:11:02,753 --> 01:11:04,517
...because she's younger.

439
01:11:06,853 --> 01:11:08,731
- Prettier than you?
- Yeah.

440
01:11:08,808 --> 01:11:10,754
Oh, darling.

441
01:11:14,764 --> 01:11:17,091
There's not a woman between here
and Timbuktu...

442
01:11:17,168 --> 01:11:19,433
...that's got even half of what you've got.

443
01:11:26,809 --> 01:11:28,808
Look what you do to me.

444
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:35,240
You're my queen...

445
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:38,396
...and I worship you.

446
01:11:42,152 --> 01:11:44,515
And I never stop thinking about you.

447
01:11:45,963 --> 01:11:48,678
I love you so, so much.

448
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,650
I'd die without you.

449
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,982
Now let's go in there...

450
01:12:32,347 --> 01:12:34,285
...and have a little bit of fun.

451
01:12:39,137 --> 01:12:40,915
And on Monday...

452
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:44,463
...we kill her.

453
01:12:47,337 --> 01:12:49,091
We stick her in a hole...

454
01:12:52,943 --> 01:12:55,263
...and we never think of her again.

455
01:14:14,624 --> 01:14:17,722
Hello! Hello.

456
01:16:32,025 --> 01:16:34,356
You were sneaking out, weren't you?

457
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:41,361
Yeah, I read your little diary.

458
01:16:45,447 --> 01:16:48,790
Your mum wouldn't let you out,
so you fucking snuck out, didn't you?

459
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:55,767
You know, the funny thing is...

460
01:16:56,996 --> 01:16:59,121
...if you'd just done...

461
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,016
...what she asked you to...

462
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:05,155
...stayed home...

463
01:17:06,732 --> 01:17:08,486
...you wouldn't even be here.

464
01:17:15,574 --> 01:17:17,972
She's probably not even looking for you.

465
01:18:18,676 --> 01:18:20,428
Hi, Jay.

466
01:18:42,572 --> 01:18:45,668
- It doesn't make sense after that.
- Well, what's it say?

467
01:18:45,745 --> 01:18:47,493
"8 Malcolm Street."

468
01:18:48,338 --> 01:18:50,315
That's just where I live.

469
01:19:55,621 --> 01:19:57,758
Oh, you...

470
01:20:06,896 --> 01:20:08,399
Out.

471
01:20:09,251 --> 01:20:11,840
I hope you're ready for round two.

472
01:20:14,664 --> 01:20:16,417
Get out!

473
01:20:17,194 --> 01:20:19,985
Get out! Get out!

474
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:24,650
Lou-Lou! Come here, you little fuck! Fuck it.

475
01:20:29,688 --> 01:20:31,184
No!

476
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:34,675
No!

477
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,770
No!

478
01:20:51,277 --> 01:20:53,062
No!

479
01:22:08,217 --> 01:22:09,971
I should have listened to you.

480
01:22:14,335 --> 01:22:16,101
You're right.

481
01:22:17,219 --> 01:22:19,922
I haven't been acting myself
since she got here.

482
01:22:27,498 --> 01:22:29,839
You know, everything has a bright side.

483
01:22:31,857 --> 01:22:35,937
You know, Lou-Lou was probably a bit
vicious to have around young kids.

484
01:22:53,607 --> 01:22:55,552
You wanna get rid of her...

485
01:22:57,771 --> 01:22:59,588
...get rid of her.

486
01:23:04,754 --> 01:23:07,134
Time to focus on getting them kids back?

487
01:23:29,992 --> 01:23:32,554
Just get her to write another note first.

488
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:40,298
This is two streets away from me.

489
01:23:40,374 --> 01:23:42,316
Sergeant Mathews told you
to come back Monday.

490
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:44,754
Yeah, but don't you think
this changes things?

491
01:23:47,452 --> 01:23:50,415
Tell you what, my shift ends at 4.
I'll swing past on the way home.

492
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:53,108
- That's 3 hours away. If someone's...
- Who knows what they can do.

493
01:23:53,185 --> 01:23:56,897
No one's got her. If I followed procedure,
I wouldn't go there at all.

494
01:24:00,906 --> 01:24:02,723
Get up.

495
01:24:07,985 --> 01:24:09,514
Walk.

496
01:24:27,493 --> 01:24:28,990
Sit.

497
01:24:43,124 --> 01:24:45,015
You're gonna write another letter.

498
01:24:45,975 --> 01:24:50,191
Dated a week from today. Say that
you're in Adelaide, you've got a job...

499
01:24:50,268 --> 01:24:52,373
...you've got a place and that you're happy.

500
01:24:54,015 --> 01:24:56,074
Tell your mum you love her...

501
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:58,756
...and that you'll call her for Christmas.

502
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:03,007
Pick up the pen.

503
01:25:10,288 --> 01:25:11,785
Vicki.

504
01:25:13,971 --> 01:25:15,756
Pick it up.

505
01:25:52,409 --> 01:25:54,226
Open them.

506
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,086
Don't fucking make one fucking sound, okay?

507
01:27:13,163 --> 01:27:16,334
'Cause this knife will hurt
a lot more than those pills.

508
01:27:38,148 --> 01:27:39,997
Keep her quiet.

509
01:27:48,461 --> 01:27:50,214
Yeah, coming.

510
01:28:09,379 --> 01:28:12,644
- Gary.
- Told you I was coming.

511
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:15,548
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

512
01:28:15,913 --> 01:28:19,761
I remember. I just...
Yeah, I just didn't expect you so early.

513
01:28:21,422 --> 01:28:23,175
You got the money or not?

514
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:27,369
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, not on me right now.

515
01:28:29,558 --> 01:28:33,182
- Just give me my fucking money.
- Yeah, all right. Just hold on a tick.

516
01:28:39,746 --> 01:28:43,316
- I'm not interested in...
- No, no, please, I'm not selling anything.

517
01:28:43,393 --> 01:28:45,915
A letter from my daughter.
Please, don't shut the door!

518
01:28:45,992 --> 01:28:48,782
- I can't help you!
- Vicki! Vicki!

519
01:28:48,859 --> 01:28:50,367
Please!

520
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:54,981
Vicki!

521
01:28:55,058 --> 01:28:59,113
I know you're here, Vicki!
Can you hear me, Vicki, please?

522
01:28:59,189 --> 01:29:00,713
Fuck.

523
01:29:01,846 --> 01:29:03,343
Vicki!

524
01:29:16,486 --> 01:29:19,840
Shit. When did everyone get so cheap?

525
01:29:32,806 --> 01:29:34,287
Vicki!

526
01:29:36,633 --> 01:29:37,743
Vicki!

527
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:40,725
- Hey, you seen this girl?
- Vicki!

528
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:43,861
Vicki!

529
01:29:44,677 --> 01:29:46,130
Vicki!

530
01:30:00,305 --> 01:30:02,279
Vicki!

531
01:30:02,643 --> 01:30:04,461
Vicki!

532
01:30:05,975 --> 01:30:08,026
Vicki, please!

533
01:30:13,983 --> 01:30:15,929
Vicki!

534
01:30:23,449 --> 01:30:25,096
Vicki!

535
01:30:27,564 --> 01:30:29,378
What's that about?

536
01:30:29,455 --> 01:30:31,505
Don't know.

537
01:30:34,868 --> 01:30:36,864
Vicki!

538
01:30:51,284 --> 01:30:53,038
Vicki!

539
01:30:55,144 --> 01:30:57,118
I just want my daughter.

540
01:30:57,674 --> 01:31:00,228
- Hey!
- Vicki!

541
01:31:00,941 --> 01:31:02,695
Fuck this.

542
01:31:11,144 --> 01:31:13,476
I just want my daughter!

543
01:31:18,015 --> 01:31:19,993
Vicki!

544
01:31:22,899 --> 01:31:24,685
Vicki!

545
01:32:29,447 --> 01:32:31,611
What the fuck was that?

546
01:32:38,544 --> 01:32:39,913
Can we...

547
01:32:41,426 --> 01:32:43,211
Vicki!

548
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:46,863
Vicki!

549
01:32:52,606 --> 01:32:54,390
Mrs. Maloney?

550
01:32:55,681 --> 01:32:57,497
I don't think she's here.

551
01:32:59,748 --> 01:33:01,535
Maggie, come on.

552
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:04,547
We should go.

553
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:08,138
She's here.

554
01:33:09,207 --> 01:33:10,679
No!

555
01:33:12,338 --> 01:33:14,310
Why are they so close?

556
01:33:14,387 --> 01:33:15,916
Go!

557
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:18,783
Take the pills.

558
01:33:24,038 --> 01:33:26,043
You take the pills now.

559
01:33:28,802 --> 01:33:31,344
You think that'll change anything?

560
01:33:36,137 --> 01:33:37,886
Take the pills.

561
01:33:38,539 --> 01:33:40,356
Stab me.

562
01:33:42,318 --> 01:33:44,136
Stab me.

563
01:33:46,195 --> 01:33:48,522
If you wanna kill me, kill me.

564
01:33:48,887 --> 01:33:50,639
Do it.

565
01:33:51,512 --> 01:33:53,522
Put it in me.

566
01:34:02,339 --> 01:34:04,515
- Just stab me!
- Evie.

567
01:34:06,247 --> 01:34:07,612
- Kill me!
- Evie!

568
01:34:07,689 --> 01:34:09,054
Take the pills.

569
01:34:09,131 --> 01:34:13,359
You don't have the fucking guts.
You don't have the fucking guts!

570
01:34:13,902 --> 01:34:15,909
You don't have the guts.

571
01:34:16,466 --> 01:34:18,250
Just do it.

572
01:34:19,764 --> 01:34:22,700
- Take the fucking pills!
- Fuck this!

573
01:34:23,352 --> 01:34:25,137
Get here!

574
01:34:46,927 --> 01:34:49,306
Get me a fucking garbage bag!

575
01:34:50,305 --> 01:35:50,252
