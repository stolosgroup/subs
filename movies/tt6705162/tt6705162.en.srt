Welcome to our family.
We're the bakers.

35
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,500
We're a big family full of big dreamers.

36
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,541
I'm Zoey, and this is Paul.

37
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,705
♪ Come on, baby, it's you ♪

38
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,059
Right now, our dream is getting everyone
out of the house on time.

39
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,083
We got this.

40
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,875
All right, I got the boys and the littles.

41
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,500
- Yeah, I'll get dej.
- Okay.

42
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,750
This is dj.

43
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,958
He dreams of being the world's greatest
lego designer and comic book artist.

44
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,041
It could happen.

45
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,500
Deej. Rise and shine.

46
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,663
Haresh!

47
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,708
Up and at 'em.
We got a restaurant to run. Let's go!

48
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:44,458
This is haresh. He dreams
of being a player. It's not happening.

49
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,291
Last I checked, players don't sleep
with their Teddy bears.

50
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,375
All right.

51
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,875
This is deja.

52
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,875
She dreams of being a starting point guard
for usc.

53
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,708
- Morning, dej.
- Morning, Paul.

54
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,541
She shoots.

55
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,666
- She scores!
- Yes! Whoo!

56
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,166
- Pretty sure that's happening.
- The crowd goes wild!

57
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,583
Whoo!

58
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,166
- All right, rise and shine!
- And these are the littles.

59
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,041
- They dream of getting bigger.
- Morning, mommy!

60
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,625
We also have two fur babies.

61
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,250
Bark Obama and Joe bitin'.

62
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,541
There's no more hot water!

63
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,000
Wait. We have hot water?

64
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,916
This is Ella.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,958
She dreams of being an influencer.

66
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,791
Wake up, Ella, or this picture
goes on your Instagram in three, two...

67
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,125
Dad, no!

68
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,916
This is Harley.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,208
Touch me, lose a finger.

70
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,833
Good morning to you too, my sweet angel.

71
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,958
She dreams
about her punk band going viral.

72
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,500
Dryer's broke again.

73
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,166
How did you get down here so fast?

74
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,208
- Laundry chute.
- We have a laundry chute?

75
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,541
Yeah. Keep up, dad.

76
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,125
Dude, I got a new follower.

77
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,625
It's probably mom.

78
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,791
It is mom.

79
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,898
- Let's shake a leg, guys!
- Has anyone seen my converse?

80
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,583
That is not yours.

81
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,041
- And this is my ex-wife…
- Kate!

82
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,166
Morning!

83
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,333
What are you doin' here?

84
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,458
And more importantly,
why did we give you a key?

85
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,708
Is that any way to greet the pinch hitter
babysitter who's here to save the day?

86
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,458
And that's why we gave her a key.

87
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,125
Namaste.

88
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,166
She dreams
about expanding her yoga studio.

89
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,101
- Hey, mom.
- Hi, honey bunnies!

90
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,541
Morning, guys. Flying in.

91
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,976
- Bagel.
- You ready? Cutie.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,333
- Bagel.
- Cutie.

93
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,875
- Bagel.
- Cutie.

94
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,000
- Bagel me.
- Bagel. Bagel.

95
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,517
- Morning.
- Bagel, bagel.

96
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,791
- Double cuties.
- Whoo!

97
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,934
- Chuckin' a Chuck.
- Thank you.

98
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,291
Excuse me, missy. No.
We are not feeding the chihuahua bagels.

99
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,208
His rules, not mine, baby.

100
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,916
There's the alarm.
Watch out, world. Here we come.

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,375
Let's roll. Let's go. Let's go.

102
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,458
Come on. Let's go!

103
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:42,458
Okay. Two moms, one dad,
and a ragtag group of nine kids.

104
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,583
I know what you're thinking,
and no, we're not a cult.

105
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,916
But we're definitely different.

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,875
- No man left behind!
- Woo-hoo!

107
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,625
- Um, what about us?
- Yeah!

108
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,291
I'm sorry, all twins left behind.

109
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:55,958
- What?
- Aw!

110
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,226
- Hey!
- When we go to work,

111
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,083
the littles stay home with Kate, because
there are limits to child labor laws.

112
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,416
Kate may not be
the most together babysitter,

113
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,833
but the kids love her.

114
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,208
And she's free.

115
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:10,125
You see, we run our own family restaurant,
baker's breakfast.

116
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,541
A mom and pop,

117
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,083
and daughter, and daughter,

118
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,125
and son, and son,

119
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,625
and daughter breakfast spot.

120
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,108
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey. That can go out.

121
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,406
- Ah, cool, thanks.
- Thank you.

122
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,291
Okay.
First, I should explain how we got here.

123
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:29,000
Kate and I met in college when we were
cast as Sandy and Danny in grease.

124
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,291
We stayed in character onstage and off,

125
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,750
falling in love
and having a surprise ending…

126
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,083
Whoa!

127
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,041
…which was getting pregnant with Ella.

128
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,958
Which is why I dropped outta college
and got a job in a crummy diner.

129
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,750
We were just getting by
when we got pregnant again…

130
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,125
- Maybe it's supposed to be the…
- …with Harley.

131
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:54,666
And then, when our best friends
were killed by a drunk driver,

132
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,166
we adopted our godson, haresh.

133
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,375
While there was nothing more exciting
than being parents,

134
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,875
Kate got a lot less excited
about being married to me.

135
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,833
We agreed to close that chapter
of our lives and start new ones.

136
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:12,791
I dreamed big and bought
that crummy diner, which is where I met…

137
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,750
Two short stacks
and a Denver omelet, please.

138
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,875
Oh, and I have breakfast coupons.

139
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:22,291
- Um, I'm so sorry, but it's 11:16…
- Wow.

140
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:26,000
…which means you're gonna have to order
off this glorious lunch menu.

141
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,250
Hi, mommy.

142
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,458
Well, kids, let's go.

143
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,250
This unkind gentleman is trying
to force us

144
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,541
to have hot soup and Shepherd's pie
for breakfast.

145
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,250
Why? Were we bad?

146
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,583
Sir, please tell my adorable children

147
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:42,625
why they can't have delicious eggs
and fluffy flapjacks.

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,916
- Whoa.
- This is incredible.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,166
Oh, thank you so much.
It's an apple-bacon crepe.

150
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,375
And it's amazing.

151
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,291
- I mean, but this sauce is fantastic.
- Really?

152
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:04,166
It's like, um, hot, uh, sweet, savory,
depending on what I put it on.

153
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,916
That's exactly what I was going for.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,041
It's amazing. I mean,
you're, like, the Willy wonka of sauces.

155
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,000
You know, minus the unpaid, exploited
oompa-loompa workforce, of course.

156
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,666
Clearly, you haven't looked in the kitchen
yet. This place runs on loompa.

157
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,315
By the way, I'm sorry about earlier.

158
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,726
I know what it's like when kids
get their hearts set on breakfast.

159
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,500
I got three of my own.
And breakfast is their favorite meal.

160
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,000
By the way, that whole "we stop serving
breakfast at 11:00" thing,

161
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,083
that has to stop.

162
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,875
I need to be able to eat
this breakfast with that sauce 24-7.

163
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,892
It's an interesting idea.
I'll run it by the owner.

164
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,166
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait! That's me. I love it.

165
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,541
So good.

166
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,958
You want some dessert, buddy?

167
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,541
A giant cupcake.

168
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,083
Giant cupcake it is. Be right back, mom.

169
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,416
He's nice.

170
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,666
Uh, he all right.

171
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,125
I was newly divorced too.

172
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,166
My ex, dom, and I met at usc.

173
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,250
Hello, hello.

174
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,333
We were the perfect couple.
He was a football star,

175
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,291
and I was a cheerleader and valedictorian.

176
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,875
- Who you talking to?
- We got married right out of school,

177
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,750
and deja and dj followed soon after.

178
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,833
"…roller coaster."

179
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,291
Our family grew
as fast as dom's football career.

180
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,833
At first, we did talk shows
and photoshoots together,

181
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:14,291
but then he was always gone doing
endorsements and business ventures.

182
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,916
And our ideas of partnership changed.

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,458
So we agreed to close that chapter
of our lives and start new ones.

184
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,041
I traded four-star restaurants
for 24-hour diners.

185
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,375
I dusted off my marketing degree,
and we became business partners.

186
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,041
Six months after that,
we turned our two families into one.

187
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,416
And we made all our dreams come true.

188
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,500
A big, beautiful family,

189
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,208
a booming business,

190
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,458
- and around-the-clock breakfast.
- Can I tickle you?

191
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,000
Even our wedding cake was made of waffles.

192
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,625
There you go.

193
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,041
We turned the diner into
an all-day breakfast spot.

194
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,958
We serve breakfast-breakfast…

195
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,125
Lunch-breakfast…

196
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,708
And dinner-breakfast.

197
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,750
My pregnancy was planned.

198
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,833
The outcome, however, was not.

199
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,083
Twins! Luna and Luca.

200
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,375
Our life got a little chaotic.

201
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,625
And just when things were settling down,

202
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:20,041
it happened again with Bronx and Bailey,

203
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,250
bringing our one big, happy family to 11.

204
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:28,500
And as hectic as our life can get,
it always somehow feels just right.

205
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,416
Babe, this is wrong.
We're not a month behind on rent, right?

206
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,916
- Right?
- What? Us behind? That's crazy.

207
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,541
Okay, babe, babe, babe.
You're anxiety-chopping again.

208
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,625
Sorry.

209
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,541
Were you intentionally hiding this
from me?

210
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,541
It's just a month, Zoey.
I promise you it's not that big a deal.

211
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,833
I love this place as much as you do,
but it is draining us.

212
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,000
We can't make any moves
because we pour everything back into it.

213
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,916
What about our dream
of buying a bigger house?

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,666
It's gonna happen, baby. I promise.

215
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,958
Even chef boyardee started out
as a fry cook.

216
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,500
I just need a little more time
to figure everything out.

217
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,833
Are you trying to tell me
chef boyardee is a real person?

218
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,000
Oh, yeah.

219
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,708
You don't know about the boyardee?
He was a legend.

220
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:21,000
He actually catered
woodrow Wilson's wedding in 1915.

221
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,166
He lived to 87.

222
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,708
He died rich and happy in Ohio.

223
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,958
It is so weird that you know this.

224
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,666
Keep dreaming.

225
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,083
- Can I help you find something?
- Oh, hi. Yeah.

226
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:47,833
I'm looking for a sauce
that could be hot, sweet or savory

227
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,125
depending on what you eat it with.

228
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,750
Wow, that sounds amazing.

229
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,291
- Right?
- Uh, what's it called?

230
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,750
I'm not sure yet.

231
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,375
Okay. When you figure it out, let me know.

232
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,583
Here you go.

233
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,375
- Nice and cold…
- oh!

234
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,916
…so you don't have to get up
and go to the kitchen,

235
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,500
or the hallway…

236
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,625
…or really any other room for that matter.

237
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,791
You are so thoughtful. Thank you, baby.

238
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You ever heard of tiktok? It's hilarious.

239
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,833
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi, Luna.

240
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,083
- Hey, Danny.
- Hi, Kate.

241
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,416
What are you guys playing?

242
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,000
Drag race.

243
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,125
Oh, fun! I love rupaul.

244
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,958
Who's betting?

245
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,916
- I've got money. I got Bailey.
- My money's on Bronx.

246
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,041
Let's get this going.

247
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,458
This babysitter's not
gonna be checked out forever.

248
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,833
Coast is clear! Go time.

249
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,875
Ready? Go!

250
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,000
- Yeah!
- Yes!

251
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,791
Go! Go! Go!

252
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,333
Go, Bronx! Go, Bailey!

253
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,125
Go, Danny!

254
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,458
He's gaining on us!

255
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,875
Oh, no! Bottle!

256
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,375
Go! Go!

257
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,333
Whoa.

258
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,916
- Shortcut!
- No fair!

259
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,208
Whoa!

260
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,958
- Come on, Bailey!
- Go get 'em!

261
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,250
Whoa.

262
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,166
Uh-oh.

263
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,458
- What's wrong?
- Parents!

264
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,083
- Everybody out!
- I'll get the door.

265
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,208
- What is happening? Danny?
- Whoa.

266
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
- Go!
- Get lost!

267
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,708
Yeah.

268
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,267
Retreat.

269
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,875
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh!

270
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,375
- Oh!
- Ooh!

271
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,625
- Ow!
- Ooh! That's gotta hurt.

272
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,833
I'm fine.

273
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,500
- Did you want some ice?
- Oh, no, no, no. We're okay.

274
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,083
Buddy, how many fingers am I holding up?

275
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,833
- Four.
- So he's back to normal.

276
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:04,416
Before you say anything,
it's not what it seems.

277
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,559
You weren't having a fast and furious
style race against Danny chen for money?

278
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,750
Whoa. I just realized
we're not smarter than you.

279
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,083
You guys are so irresponsible.

280
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,916
I've been in bed the whole time.

281
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,666
Honey, you still have your helmet on.

282
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,416
This is my sleeping helmet.

283
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,208
Okay. All right. You two, out of here.
What am I gonna do with you two?

284
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,166
Go to your room.

285
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,750
But don't you wanna do our tiktok dance
with us, daddy?

286
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,458
Yeah,
because we're so irresistibly adorable.

287
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:37,041
Don't try and charm me with our tiktok
dance. And you're not even doing it right.

288
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,541
You have to clap the back of the hands
and then throw.

289
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,833
You're an embarrassment to the family.
Go to your room.

290
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,708
We tried.

291
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,791
We always do.

292
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,250
So, uh, you think Bronx is okay?

293
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,375
Yeah. He hits his head on the hour.

294
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,208
Oh, good. Although,
I feel like this one is my fault.

295
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,458
- You think?
- Well, my new therapist says

296
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,583
I have issues with being a disciplinarian.

297
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,375
You have another new therapist?

298
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,258
But my new new therapist made me realize
I missed my old new therapist,

299
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,458
so it's out with the new, in with the old.

300
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,958
- That makes total sense.
- Yeah, I know, right?

301
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,416
Who's that?

302
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,666
Probably no one,
but if it's Danny chen's parents,

303
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,500
we don't know him, and he wasn't here.

304
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,541
- Dom, hey.
- Hey.

305
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,791
How are you? What are you doing in town?

306
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,500
You know, just got back.
Thought I'd come by and see the kids.

307
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,703
I hope that's not a problem.

308
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,208
- Well...
- No.

309
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,541
You're handsome and famous?
Come over anytime.

310
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,916
- Dad?
- Hey.

311
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,625
- Oh. Hey, dad.
- Hey, what's up, dj?

312
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,541
- Hey, man.
- Hey, look. These are for you.

313
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,833
Oh, well, thanks.

314
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,625
- Dom!
- Hey, little man, what's happening?

315
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,601
- Yeah, well...
- How you doing, man? Look at you.

316
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,583
- Looking just as stylish as ever.
- You too.

317
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,916
Thank you, man.

318
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,916
- So, who wants headphones?
- Me.

319
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,250
Beats headphones?

320
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,583
- Personalized beats headphones.
- Wow.

321
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,250
You wanna help pass them out for me?

322
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,693
- Yeah!
- Thanks, buddy.

323
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,125
Thanks, dad.

324
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,458
- You're welcome, baby.
- Wow.

325
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,791
Here, daddy. Dom got you a pair too.

326
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,666
Oh, wow. Thank you.

327
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,250
- What is this?
- Look what dom brought everybody.

328
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,500
- Ooh.
- They're personalized.

329
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,583
Whoa.

330
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,166
- Way to stunt. Thanks, d.
- It's very nice of you, dom. Thank you.

331
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,500
I'm guessing I didn't... I didn't get one?

332
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,875
- Kate.
- Okay. Cool. Yeah. Cool.

333
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,416
I'm gonna go check on Bronx.

334
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,083
So, what do you think?

335
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,958
I mean,
they're Michael Jordan tennies, and...

336
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,458
Yeah, I guess these'll be fun.

337
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,421
- Yeah, they're pretty dope, right?
- Yeah.

338
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,041
So dope. They're very dope.

339
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,375
They look so expensive.
They probably cost more than...

340
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,708
This house?

341
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,666
No, that's... that... ow!

342
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,041
I was... I was actually gonna say
five pairs of my sneakers,

343
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,875
but no, the home that I live in
is definitely funnier.

344
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,125
They're so big.

345
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,000
Look at these things, babe, huh?

346
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,583
Beep. Beep. Beep.

347
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,708
Yeah, well, actually, Paul, he's a 12 now.

348
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,125
I don't know if you knew or not,
but, you know, big feet run in our family.

349
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,208
And what are you?
About, what, I'd say a 10?

350
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,500
- Dad.
- I was born with tiny toes, dom.

351
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:14,375
It's not something I like to joke about,
but since you asked, 9 and 3/4.

352
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,083
Oh, Paul.

353
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:23,125
Baby, I love your little feet, and I love
that we can share the same shoes.

354
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,041
We don't share the same shoes.
I wore your uggs once.

355
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,875
Hey, Paul, you mind tossing me a beer?

356
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,041
I'm sorry. We don't have any beer.

357
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,625
I can clearly see that you guys have beer.

358
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,750
- It's on... it's on the door.
- You didn't. No.

359
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,473
- Paul, don't be like that.
- I'll tell you what I can get for you.

360
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,291
The one thing we have for you,

361
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,416
a tasty juice box.

362
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh. Well, this is my favorite.
This is better.

363
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,083
And, uh…

364
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,416
Interesting place to keep your oranges.

365
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,375
Yeah, it's for convenience.
They're everywhere.

366
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,208
You want an orange, you reach down.

367
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,000
So, dom, great to see you.

368
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,208
What... what brings you to town?
Don't you have work?

369
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,290
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

370
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,750
No, I decided to retire.

371
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,165
I'm considering
a year-long deal with ESPN.

372
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,875
Yeah, which means
more money, less tackling.

373
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,500
So I'm just checking out places to buy.

374
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,351
- So you're moving back to la?
- Mm-hmm.

375
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,125
- That'll be great for the kids.
- La, la? Like, here la?

376
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,375
Like, where I live? With... with my family?

377
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,958
Yeah. To be with my family.

378
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,415
I thought we were all family.

379
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
- We are.
- We are.

380
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,750
But that means I can be around more,

381
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,458
be part of the day-to-day
and help out with these guys.

382
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,083
- Cool.
- No, no. I think we're good.

383
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,416
We don't need help. Do we, babe?
No. We're... no.

384
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,166
We... we're fine.
This place runs like a well-oiled machine.

385
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,000
Um, so he sneezed
and started bleeding again.

386
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,791
It tastes like metal.

387
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,708
- Okay, I'm coming.
- He's fine.

388
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,166
That one's not even yours, so don't worry.

389
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,666
Yay, dom's moving back. More dom.

390
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,791
- Paul.
- I know. It'll be great with the kids.

391
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,875
It's just... it's definitely gonna be weird
having him around.

392
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:04,000
Unlike the totally normal way
that Kate's around all the time?

393
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,708
Babe, last week I caught her
trying on my bathing suits. Ew.

394
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,833
- Well, at least she helps with the kids.
- And dom will too.

395
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,291
Now.

396
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,958
Come on, Zoey.
You know it's not the same thing.

397
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:20,291
Kate isn't richer
and, like, 10 feet taller than you.

398
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,875
Are you ever gonna stop being threatened
by all that stuff?

399
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,208
I am not threatened. I just... honestly?

400
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:29,916
I think it's sad that he feels the need to
make himself feel bigger by coming in here

401
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,958
and, like, showering us all
with these expensive headphones.

402
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,166
Like, "we get it. You're an
ex-football player with giant feet

403
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,000
and a Japanese toilet
that washes your butt."

404
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,541
Not sure how you know about that.

405
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:44,708
And for the record, I am very secure
in my size 9-and-1/2 converse.

406
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,625
Mmm. I love it when you talk
sensible sneaker to me.

407
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:51,666
Well, what happens when I say asics?

408
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,083
Rockports.

409
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,333
Skechers.

410
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,791
All right.
Now say new balance to me real slow.

411
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,250
New balance.

412
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,041
Oh, yes.

413
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,375
It's a little late, dej.

414
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,416
I know.
I know I'm supposed to be asleep,

415
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,166
but I heard there's gonna be a scout
from so at my game.

416
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,041
How bomb would it be
if I went to my dad's Alma mater?

417
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,125
Would be bombish. Bomb...

418
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,875
Bomb-adjacent.
But you know what would be bombier?

419
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,166
If you went to my Alma mater.

420
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,000
Chino hills culinary arts?

421
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,750
Big chca. Number one in whisking.

422
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,015
Let me show you a little something, okay?

423
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:53,875
You're getting them in
but not as gloriously as I'd like you to.

424
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,541
All right, watch this. Ready?

425
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,541
Okay, so the goal
was to not get it in, right?

426
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,250
- Yeah, I had to warm up.
- Yep.

427
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,375
- Okay.
- I'm warm.

428
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,291
Nothing but rim.

429
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, let me show you a little something
magic used to do. Hook it up!

430
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,500
- Oh.
- Oh, you know what? It's late.

431
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,583
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

432
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,708
♪ I feel good ♪

433
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,416

437
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,208

441
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,416
That's my baby!

442
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,500
- You didn't tell me dom was coming.
- I didn't know.

443
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,125
Hey, son.

444
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,250
- Oh, hey, dad.
- Hey.

445
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,041
- Your dad is Dominic Clayton?
- Yeah.

446
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:57,000
How is it genetically possible
that Dominic Clayton is your pops?

447
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,375
I mean, no offense, dude.

448
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,875
Oh, no, no, no, no.

449
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,041
Why would I be offended to you totally
offending me down to the genetic level?

450
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,166
Come on, dej! Come on, dej!

451
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,875
- Foul! Foul!
- That's okay.

452
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,333
That's not a foul!

453
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,016
- That's a foul, right?
- That is a foul.

454
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,083
Good one, ref!

455
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,791
- Come on. You've got this, baby.
- Come on, dej!

456
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,041
- Come on, baby. You got this.
- Come on, dej.

457
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,500
Boom!

458
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,250
- That's my daughter!
- Yes. That's also my daughter!

459
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,208
But biologically, she's mine!

460
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,333
Yeah, I claim her on my taxes, so…

461
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,750
- Okay. You're both being super ridiculous.
- Okay.

462
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,333
You know what?
Let's get a wave going. A wave for dej.

463
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,541
- Whoo!
- Yo!

464
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,041
Let's get that wave going, everybody.
Whoo!

465
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,976
- What are you doing?
- Someone's not doing the wave.

466
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,291
That's halftime, ladies and gentlemen.

- I'm sorry.
- No. I don't even take that as an insult,

562
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:05,500
because I am on the verge
of becoming sauce royalty.

563
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:07,416
What do you mean?

564

- What?

No, you look absolutely amazing.

588

00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:11,958
Uh…

621
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,458
Oh, hi, everyone. Um…

622
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:18,333
Thank you... thank you so much
for... for inviting me and for...

623
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:22,416
Let me just... sorry. Bit overdressed here.

624
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:34,750
S…

625
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,458
Sauce.
I'm here to talk to you about sauce.

626
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,583
"A billion-dollar industry."

627
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:44,541
Studies show that sales of sauce

628
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:49,541
have skyrocketed by more
than 150% since 2000...

629
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:53,791
Is something wrong?

630
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,666
I'm so sorry. This is... this isn't me.

631
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,458
I'm just gonna do this a different way.
Um…

632
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:09,041
I'm just gonna speak
to you honestly about it.

633
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:11,833
I... I'm a chef,
and I have a breakfast restaurant.

634
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:14,166
And I invented this sauce.

635
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:18,291
And miraculously,
it is hot, sweet, and savory

636
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,791
all at the same time,
depending on what you put it on.

637
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:23,500
So you could put it on your waffles
and it would be sweet.

638
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:28,875
You could put it on your… chimichangas
and it would be… you got it, savory.

639
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,583
- Okay, so, what's 15 times ten?
- Why would I know this?

640
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:35,375
How did you get an f
on your computer science quiz?

641
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:36,958
Like, I just don't get it.

642
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,916
Why? 'Cause all Indian people
are supposed to be geniuses?

643
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,500
Or all black people can dance?

644
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,208
- Well...
- We know that's not true.

645
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:44,291
You know what?

646
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:47,333
Zoey, show these idiots
what a rhythmless black person looks like.

647
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,375
Hey, family. I have incredible news.

648
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,458
- Why're you wearing my sweatshirt?
- And my jeans?

649
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:53,500
- And my Fanny pack?
- Are those my sneakers?

650
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,666
Yo, low-key, that outfit goes hard.

651
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,750
Thank you, son.

652
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,125
Look at this, my darling.

653
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,583
What is this... whoa.

654
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:03,000
That is the money to start
our brand new sauce company.

655
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,166
- You sold the pitch?
- Well, no.

656
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,375
I mean, a full half of the investors said
they had "no faith in this whatsoever,"

657
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,666
but Melanie and Michele
think it has promise.

658
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,166
So they gave me that check
to get things going.

659
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,583
- Whoa, we're rich. We're rich.
- Wow! Wow.

660
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:21,934
Wait, so they gave you all of this
just for seed money?

661
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:24,017
No, it's not just seed money.
It's also a signing bonus

662
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,001
and a buyout of the company name
and all future rights to the brand, but...

663
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,750
Cool, so we're rich and sellouts?

664
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:31,833
No, we're not rich or sellouts.
This is how you grow a business.

665
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,458
But we are the brand.

666
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:38,791
The company name is literally our name,
so how does that work?

667
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,809
If we're gonna be changing names, I want
the "s" in "haresh" to be a dollar sign.

668
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,833
We're not changing our names, okay?

669
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:46,125
This is just gonna help us
pay off a whole lot of bills

670
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:49,208
and, hopefully, get a house
with a working dryer.

671
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:50,416
Yes!

672
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,125
If mom agrees, there are some in calabasas
that are looking quite delicious.

673
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:57,625
- What?
- Calabasas? Bieber country?

674
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:59,208
Am I gonna be a real housewife?

675
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:02,291
No, it's not bieber-housewives level,
but I found this gated community

676
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,666
which has a really big house
with bedrooms for everyone.

677
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,916
So we all get our own rooms?

678
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,916
- Yay!
- Yay!

679
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,541
Twins still have to share…

680
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,666
Boo!

681
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,267
…but there's a really amazing pool club.

682
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,208
- Yay!
- Yay!

683
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,458
Yes!

684
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,101
- What about school?
- That's the thing.

685
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,486
I think we could also afford
to send you to private school.

686
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,708
- You'd have college prep, smaller classes.
- Yo!

687
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,125
Does it look like I'm college material?

688
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:29,125
Dude, I'm fine being a disgrace.
I just don't wanna leave my friends.

689
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,041
What about my scholarship to usc?

690
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,958
Deja, the season just started.

691
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:36,000
I think if your mom
and I decide to do this,

692
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,666
you'll get on another great team.

693
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,000
I don't wanna be on another team.
Another team is wack.

694
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,291
- This whole situation is wack.
- Preach!

695
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:48,250
Deja, just chill, okay?
Nothing has been decided.

696
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:49,958
So...

697
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:53,708
Just keep an open mind.
This could be great for our family.

698
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:02,083
What about you? You think this is wack?

699
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,000
Just please take off my Fanny pack.

700
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,625
So she locked herself in her room,
and she's not even talking to me.

701
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:14,708
She'll get over it.

702
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:17,416
The important thing is that you and I
are on the same page.

703
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,083
Oh, we're not.

704
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:22,125
- This is a bad idea.
- What are you talking about?

705
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,958
You just said you thought
it could be great.

706
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,458
Because it's important to show
the kids we're a united front.

707
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,041
But no, this is crazy.

708
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:31,045
We need to use all of that money
to launch the sauce, not buy a house too.

709
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,375
Okay, just listen to me, baby, okay?
I've been crunching numbers,

710
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:37,708
and I think with the signing bonus,
we can afford a down payment.

711
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:39,083
It's too risky.

712
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:42,375
If anything goes wrong, we won't be able
to afford a bigger mortgage.

713
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:46,333
And seriously? Calabasas?
Is calabasas really us?

714
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,000
I know. It's not ideal,

715
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:51,041
but it's the only place we can afford
a big enough house.

716
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,958
We have been begging
for more room forever.

717
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,750
You said it yourself today.

718
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,958
True.

719
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,041
Please trust me.

720
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:03,125
I'm finally, finally in a position

721
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,916
where I can give the kids
something they really need.

722
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,458
And not dumb things,
like fancy headphones and flashy sneakers.

723
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:14,958
I wanna give my wife a walk-in closet.

724
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:18,125
Thank you. I appreciate that.

725
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:22,291
But your wife already had a walk-in closet
that she walked away from.

726
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:28,333
What I'm hearing is that
you want a walk-in closet.

727
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:31,708
I really do.

728
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:33,541
I see that.

729
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:38,958
♪ I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y ♪

730
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:42,875
♪ till I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie ♪

731
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:46,125
- Wow.
- Pretty.

732
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:49,583
Wow, look at that. Look at those gates.
Look how long that driveway is.

733
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:51,625
- All clean, man.
- That is so tacky.

734
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:53,375
Doggy!

735
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:54,958
That one is so sick!

736
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:57,333
Whoa!
Why did we wait so long to get rich?

737
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,791
Where are we?

738
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,958
Wow. Isn't this amazing?

739
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:04,416
Yeah. Looks like heaven for that guy.

740
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,583
Howdy, neighbor!

741
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:13,541
- Did we buy this house?
- No, we didn't. Just looking.

742
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,875
So, this is our house now?

743
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:18,041
No, buddy.
No one has bought a house.

744
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,416
So, we own this?

745
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,375
Buddy.

746
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,791
- Welcome.
- Whoa. Pretty!

747
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:27,000
- Careful!
- Curly stairs!

748
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,791
I love it!

749
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,291
- This is so nice.
- Oh, my gosh.

750
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,166
These chandeliers are so drip.

751
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,083
- Seriously? You're into this mcmansion?
- Yo!

752
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:36,916
There's a koi pond!
And a basketball court!

753
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Really?

754
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,283
I call a room upstairs!

755
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:43,083
- Check this out. An elevator.
- No way, my own elevator?

756
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:46,708
What do you think? Look at this.
Wait for it. Wait for it.

757
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:50,500
- Ah!
- Oh, wow!

758
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:54,250
- Okay, I got to admit this is epic.
- Yeah.

759
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,083
- We gotta sell a lot of sauce.
- We will.

760
00:36:56,166 --> 00:37:01,250
Yeah! Mom, dad, this house is amazing.

761
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,375
- I mean...
- Yeah.

762
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,291
We have our own fountain!

763
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:11,083
Stay out of the fountain!

764
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,333
Oof!

765
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:13,458
I'm fine!

766
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:14,791
Well, see if he's bleeding.

767
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:15,958
Look at this kitchen.

768
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,625
Oh.

769
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:24,291
There it is.

770
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:33,500
Wow, uh, "Paul's hot, sweet and savory."
That sounds delicious.

771
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:36,083
- Daddy, that's you.
- That's your sauce.

772
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,958
What? That's crazy. Whose kids are these?

773
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,250
Daddy, we're your kids.

774
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:44,250
I got lost kids in aisle two.
They're attacking my cart.

775
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,791
- Releasing the littles!
- Yay!

776
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:51,083
- We're here!
- Wanna take a little pee?

777
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,916
There's so much grass!

778
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,666
- This is all ours, Joe.
- We're home!

779
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:00,916
- Oh, hi, new neighbors. We're the bakers.
- Hi.

780
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,625
Come over anytime.
We've got extra pool noodles.

781
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,000
Hello, ma'am. Welcome.

782
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,250
Oh, thank you. Hi.

783
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,583
Just so you know, we have
a strict neighborhood noise policy.

784
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,500
No loud music after 10:00.

785
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:16,708
Okay.

786
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,250
Uh, question for you.

787
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:23,166
Do you always immediately tell
all new homeowners about this policy?

788
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,708
Or just us?

789
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:27,083
Seconds after we arrive.

790
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:29,375
Is everything okay?

791
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,125
Yes, sir. Um…

792
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,791
Didn't mean to cause any offense.

793
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,958
Probably shouldn't have said
anything offensive.

794
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:39,166
My apologies, ma'am.

795
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,833
You folks enjoy your day.

796
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:45,791
Well, that was fun for me.

797
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,250
What is all this?

798
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:59,416
It's our first night in the big place.
I thought we should celebrate.

799
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,833
How about some flamin' hot cheetos
and cîroc?

800
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:04,666
Look what I got you. Hold on.

801
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:08,791
French vanilla cîroc.

802
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,208
I thought they discontinued
French vanilla.

803
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,875
Like that would ever stop me.

804
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:15,250
Oh, this calls for lingerie.

805
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:18,041
Okay. You know the one I love, baby.
You know that one.

806
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:24,958
Mmm. Cake.

807
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,041
Whoa.

808
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:28,375
- No, no. What are you guys doing?
- We're scared.

809
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:31,208
Um, we called for you,
but you couldn't hear us.

810
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:32,833
No, please take the dog off the bed.

811
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,416
- No, no, please...
- Cheetos!

812
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,583
No, these are not for you,
and this is not for you.

813
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,017
- This looks nice.
- Rose petals!

814
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,309
No, please leave the Rose petals...

815
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:42,166
- Our tummies hurt.
- How could both of your tummies hurt?

816
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,392
We're twins, dad.
You know how this kind of thing goes.

817
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,559
- Come on! Come in!
- No, we're not all staying in here...

818
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,916
Rose petals!

819
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,083
Oh, hey, guys.

820
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,625
- Come on. It's your man.
- Hey, dj!

821
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:51,625
Just gonna take this.

822
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,559
- You came just in time to leave.
- Rose petals! Rose!

823
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:54,583
- Thank you.
- Anyways,

824
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,146
I'm gonna need the wireless password,

825
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:59,500
but not so I can search for college girls
being free with their bodies.

826
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,601
No, that's why I didn't give you
the Wi-Fi password.

827
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,000
Dude! The password.

828
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,166
- No. No Wi-Fi for both of you.
- Please, come on!

829
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,416
Yo, family movie night.

830
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,392
- No, it's not family movie night.
- Yeah!

831
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:11,059
- No. Everybody, please...
- What's going on?

832
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:13,309
Are you seriously having
a family movie night without me?

833
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,541
- No!
- Yes!

834
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,250
- No, everybody out.
- Pardon my butt.

835
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,791
Where do you think you're going?
Get off of me! Okay.

836
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,666
Okay, no. Bark.

837
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,541
Bark! No! Bark, give me... come on! Bark!

838
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,291
What is going on out... oh, my...

839
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:28,875
Drop it. Drop mama's throw!

840
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,500
That's mommy's face!

841
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:33,666
She got these for me!

842
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,916
- She bought these for me!
- Don't lie!

843
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,666
- Don't lie!
- These are from her.

844
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,517
Did I ever tell you about
the night your mother and I were married

845
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:42,708
and we decided to have
an even dozen like you?

846
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:46,208
Six boys and six girls. I believe
you even made a memorandum of it.

847
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:57,250
What? What?

848
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,708
♪ They say I walk like a king ♪

849
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,208
♪ talk like a king ♪

850
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,916
♪ you can ask around
they'll say the same thing ♪

851
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,500
♪ make way for the king ♪

852
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:20,791
Hello, everyone. We're the bakers.

853
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,250
Eh?

854
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:24,333
What are you looking at?

855
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,375
It's so beautiful, baby.
You wanna get in?

856
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:29,000
Not right now. I'm a little uncomfortable.

857
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:31,833
I mean, look around. Everyone is staring
at us like we're weird.

858
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:33,958
Of course they're staring at us.
We are weird, babe.

859
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,791
Look at our kids. Our kids are weirdos.

860
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:37,583
Guys, there's no reception here.

861
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,750
Hey, Ella!

862
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,041
Receive this!

863
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,392
Oh, my... no, my phone!

864
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,625
No, my phone! Oh, my god.

865
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,791
Luca and Luna are living their best life.

866
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:48,875
We would dominate in doubles tennis.

867
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,791
I'll reserve a court.

868
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,500
I just feel like we don't belong here.

869
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,583
Of course we belong here.

870
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:58,083
You belong here. You belong everywhere.

871
00:41:58,166 --> 00:41:59,250
Oh, come on.

872
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,625
No, you come on.

873
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:01,958
Honey, believe it or not,

874
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:06,416
I don't share the same sense of privilege
that you do that I can just go anywhere

875
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,916
- and automatically belong.
- Well, I don't feel that way.

876
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

877
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:11,958
Name one time in your life
you didn't belong.

878
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:15,166
Really? Okay, um,
how about when your father took me

879
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,708
to that barbershop in inglewood
and they gave me a jheri curl?

880
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:21,166
O-Okay. How about
when we went to your mom's church

881
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,930
and everyone stared at me the entire time?

882
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,017
Yeah, 'cause you were flailing around
like a lunatic.

883
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:27,416
It is not my fault I caught the spirit,
Zoey.

884
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,750
It was a bake sale.

885
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:32,666
Okay, fine.

886
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,500
A few times in your life,
you felt like you didn't belong.

887
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:38,916
I feel that way all the time.

888
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,208
This is our home.
And they're gonna have to get used to us.

889
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:44,750
You know what? I'm gonna go in the pool,

890
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:48,375
because I'll be damned if I'm not gonna
feel at home when I'm at home.

891
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:50,666
Cannonball!

892
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:53,500
- Yeah, Paul!
- Okay, yeah.

893
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,041
- Okay, nice.
- Ten.

894
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,750
Hi, hi. I wanted to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

895
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:02,541
Normally, I'd have a welcome gift,
but I figured I'd just say, "hi."

896
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,541
So, hi. I'm tricia.

897
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,916
- Hi, I'm Zoey. Nice to meet you.
- Oh! Nice to meet you.

898
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,250
- Wait, have a seat.
- Okay.

899
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:12,708
Oh, wow. You are so brave

900
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:16,208
to let your kids invite so many
of their friends over. Two is my limit.

901
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:19,166
Oh, no. Actually, they're all ours.

902
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,708
Oh. Okay.

903
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:25,458
Well, I actually have three, so I know
what it's like to have my hands full.

904
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:28,208
Yeah, I've gone days
without seeing three of my kids.

905
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:32,583
Oh, gosh. I gotta take this.
It's my sister-in-law.

906
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,333
Rachel.

907
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,416
Paul. Paul, Paul.

908
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,833
Paul, Paul.
You need to get out of the water.

909
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:42,083
- What?
- Come here.

910
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:44,416
- What happened?
- Your sister's in rehab again.

911
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:48,041
Why are we having
an emergency family meeting?

912
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,666
Here's the situation.

913
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,875
Aunt Rachel has to go away
for a little while

914
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:55,083
on a special little trip.

915
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:57,458
And in the meantime, guess what?

916
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:59,583
Cousin Seth is coming to live with us!

917
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:02,184
- "Sticky fingers" Seth?
- Didn't he go to juvie for shoplifting?

918
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:03,916
Yeah, and get held back, what, four times?

919
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,583
Dad, no. This isn't some halfway house.

920
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:08,125
- This is a whole house.
- It's not a debate, guys.

921
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:12,333
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.
Family has each other's back, okay?

922
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,666
So tomorrow, when he gets here,

923
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,166
every single one of you is gonna treat him
like family. You got it?

924
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,041
- Got it.
- Got it.

925
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:21,005
That was two people.
Can I have some enthusiasm?

926
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,125
Got it!

927
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:24,708
Now like you're really excited
to see Seth! Got it?

928
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:26,375
- Got it!
- Whoo!

929
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,958
Can I get an "amen"?

930
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,583
Dad, don't push it.

931
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:32,375
Okay, come on in.

932
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,041
- Welcome.
- Dang.

933
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:39,875
Yeah, a few things have changed
since you were last with us.

934
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:41,625
But, you know, make yourself at home.

935
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:44,333
And everyone is really excited
that you're here.

936
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:45,916
Yeah.

937
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:51,500
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know. Doing their own thing.

938
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,791
But we told you guys that Seth was coming.

939
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:56,541
Yeah, and you also said
to treat him like family, so…

940
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:59,916
Resh, maybe you could show Seth your room,

941
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,666
since you guys are gonna be roomies.

942
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:04,583
Right. Sorry.

943
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,416
Fix your face.

944
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:13,333
Aw, look at that smile.
You guys are gonna be besties.

945
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:14,416
Oh, he's thrilled.

946
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,916
Let's go, roomie.

947
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,333
I see a secret handshake in your future.

948
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,541
I'm not gonna do that.

949
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:24,083
All right. This is where you'll be staying
while you do your time here.

950
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:26,166
Nah.

951
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:29,833
Nah, uh-uh. Nah, playboy.
Newcomers don't get the top bunk.

952
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:32,833
There's a hierarchy here.
They serve us dinner around 7:00.

953
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:36,916
We work in the kitchen on weekends.
You get your exercise outside on the yard.

954
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:40,041
- What?
- Now, this…

955
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:44,625
Is where it all goes down.

956
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,750
While you're here, I suggest you link up
with a crew for protection.

957
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:50,625
Got your Beckys, got your lifers.

958
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:53,500
That one has been in for 18 years.

959
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:56,750
The little ones are soft.
You don't wanna get mixed up with them.

960
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:57,833
They can't protect you.

961
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:02,166
Yo. Cousin Seth.

962
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,625
What are you guys doing?

963
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,833
Oh, you know,
just showing the little homey the ropes

964
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:07,750
so he knows how to survive on the inside.

965
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:09,393
Have you been watching locked up again?

966
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:12,375
There may or may not have been
a 48-hour marathon on msnbc.

967
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:13,583
Leave me alone, dude.

968
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:19,875
Hey, Seth?

969
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:26,666
Hey, bud.
I made you a little breakfast-lunch.

970
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,208
I'm not really hungry.

971
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,166
Okay, well, I'll just put it right here.

972
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,458
In case you change your mind.

973
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:41,958
Look, I-I know how hard it can be
to adjust to a new environment.

974
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:45,355
I want you to feel like this is home.

975
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:48,458
I have a home. It's back
in my old neighborhood with my homeys.

976
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:49,833
Yeah. Yeah, I know,

977
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:52,458
and... and I'm sure those are...
Those are really great guys.

978
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:57,500
But I made a promise to my sister
that I would look out for you.

979
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:01,916
But I'm here
if you ever wanna talk about anything.

980
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:05,000
All right.

981
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,208
I'll leave you alone.

982
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Unpack.

983
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:29,976
- Daddy!
- What? What?

984
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,333
- Dad!
- What's wrong?

985
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:35,000
We liked it better
when your bedroom was right next to ours.

986
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,291
Now it's too far.

987
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:39,666
We can't crawl in your bed
or hear you through the walls anymore.

988
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:40,750
Exactly.

989
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:44,500
Which means you won't grow up
to be freaky men with weird issues.

990
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:47,291
- That can happen?
- No, no, no.

991
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:50,708
The second you're an adult,
all your problems go away.

992
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:53,333
Can you at least read us a bedtime story?
Please.

993
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:54,750
Okay. Which one?

994
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,166
- All of them.
- All of 'em.

995
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,708
Oh, I feel tricked.

996
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:02,291
- We got this.
- Babe,

997
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:05,708
we have more bathrooms now.
The kids don't need as long to get ready.

998
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:07,875
Yeah, but it's their first day of school.

999
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:10,958
Come on. Ten more minutes.
Just lie with me.

1000
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:12,041
Okay.

1001
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:22,375
- Kate, what's wrong? You okay?
- I'm great. I'm loving this new kitchen.

1002
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:25,041
Where is everyone? We can't be late
for school on the first day.

1003
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:28,583
- What's going on?
- The new school starts later.

1004
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:29,666
Oh, no.

1005
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:32,250
New high school starts later,
new middle school starts earlier.

1006
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:34,708
We have to be out of here in ten minutes.

1007
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:37,250
We have ten minutes. It's a code red!

1008
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,773
- Code red, baby! Where are my slippers?
- Okay! I don't know!

1009
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,434
- I don't need my slippers! Come on!
- Go!

1010
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:42,875
- Let's go! Move out!
- Here we go!

1011
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:45,833
- Dad!
- Dude!

1012
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:49,375
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Zoey!

1013
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:53,416
Hey, I'ma need my shoe back!

1014
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,208
No, no, no, no, no!

1015
00:48:55,291 --> 00:48:57,250
No! No!

1016
00:48:58,708 --> 00:48:59,708
No!

1017
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:04,625
- Thanks.
- You bet.

1018
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,208
Thank you.

1019
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:07,833
- For you.
- Thank you very much.

1020
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:09,500
Oh, almost gave you my keys there.

1021
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:11,708
Thank you.

1022
00:49:11,791 --> 00:49:13,583
- Thanks.
- All done.

1023
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:15,958
- All right. Last one.
- Oh, Harley.

1024
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:18,333
- Hey!
- Hey!

1025
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:19,750
Let's be late every day!

1026
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,833
- Oh, keys.
- Keys.

1027
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:25,208
I feel like there were
a few extra children in there.

1028
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:28,083
- I didn't recognize some of them.
- Late start is genius.

1029
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:30,375
- So relaxing.
- Yeah. So relaxing.

1030
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:31,958
All right. Let's get this over with.

1031
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:34,708
Okay, dej, before you go,
I just wanna give you a little something

1032
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:37,000
that I hope makes your first day go
a little smoother.

1033
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
- For real?
- Yeah.

1034
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,500
Whoa. Are you kidding me?

1035
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:46,250
- Awesome. We got our own car.
- Hold up.

1036
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,510
- You got your own car.
- Yeah, that's right.

1037
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,083

00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:07,375

00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:09,500

And how cute are these uniforms?
I'm gonna get so many likes.

1051
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,083
Is that guy looking at me?

1052
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:26,666
He's totally checking you out.

1053
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:30,208
- What do I do if he comes up to me?
- Hey, don't worry.

1054
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:33,708
I'm your sister. If anything pops off,
you know I got your back.

1055
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:37,833
I feel like I know you.

1056
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:39,916
Wait, didn't you used to play
for the wildcats?

1057
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,208
Who wants to know?

1058
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:44,916
Wait, you scored,
like, 30 against Fairfax last month.

1059
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,541
It was 37, actually.

1060
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:50,666
Yeah, and, you know, I'm her sister,
which makes me a pretty big deal.

1061
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,833
I bet you're headed
to the registration building.

1062
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:55,625
I could take you if you want.

1063
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,625
Nah, I'm good. I'm a big girl.
I can find my classroom on my own.

1064
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,958
Yeah, and I can find my classroom too.

1065
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:10,875
Okay, cool.
Yeah, that's not humiliating at all.

1066
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:12,208
Deja.

1067
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:13,333
Deja!

1068
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:15,416
He's so cute.

1069
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:17,541
What?

1070
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:23,833
- Haresh, let's go!
- I'm trying.

1071
00:51:23,916 --> 00:51:26,916
- Where are we even going?
- Hi. You guys must be new. I'm Dylan.

1072
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,083
- Hey. Dj.
- Harley.

1073
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:29,666
Can I help you get to class?

1074
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:32,083
Yes, please.
'Cause I'm totally weak and helpless.

1075
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:34,041
- Later.
- Ice cold.

1076
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:35,000
Ooh!

1077
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:36,791
No! I-I mean, because you're new!

1078
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,375
I mean, you can help me.

1079
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:39,791
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1080
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:42,875
- Oh, hey. Wait up.
- Yo, watch it, dude.

1081
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:47,208
- You gonna apologize?
- Or... or do you even speak English?

1082
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,958
I'm from echo park, idiots.

1083
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:08,750
Okay! Any other first-day highlights?

1084
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:11,666
I learned about the sixth extinction.

1085
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,583
When the bees die, we all die.

1086
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:16,541
- Deja met a cute boy.
- Shut up.

1087
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:20,125
Okay,
who wants a celebratory breakfast-snack?

1088
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:21,333
Doughnut cake!

1089
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:22,541
Doughnut cake!

1090
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:26,250
Doughnut cake! Yay!

1091
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:28,125
Guys, shouldn't we at least wait for mom?

1092
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:30,291
- I mean, she loves doughnut cake.
- Hey, everybody!

1093
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:31,833
I didn't hear you come in.

1094
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:33,083
How was everyone's day?

1095
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:36,208
- Resh?
- Ah, you know how I do.

1096
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:39,625
Got a couple new friends
and a couple new thirsty ig followers.

1097
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:41,833
- Super popular.
- Have you been here the whole time?

1098
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,791
Yeah. Definitely not napping in your bed.

1099
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,583
Oh, lord. Give me strength.

1100
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,791
- Hi.
- Hi.

1101
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:08,875
Good morning. Paul, babe. Look who's here.

1102
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:11,416
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hi.

1103
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,083
What brings you by? Let me guess.

1104
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:15,916
You want some lunch-breakfast.
Egg white enchiladas.

1105
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,875
Actually, we're here to talk sauce.

1106
00:53:18,958 --> 00:53:22,250
Well, that's my favorite subject.
Come on. I've got an open booth.

1107
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,208
- Join us?
- Uh…

1108
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:26,333
I got you.

1109
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:27,625
Thanks, deej.

1110
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:30,041
Hi.

1111
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,666
Oh, hello! Welcome to baker's.

1112
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,333
And yes, I am a child.

1113
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:35,583
What's going on?

1114
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:37,583
So, we've been doing some research,

1115
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:40,083
and we're seeing
that in the past few months,

1116
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:42,500
your sauce has been flying
off the shelves.

1117
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:44,291
Sales have doubled in the past week alone.

1118
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:45,975
- Doubled.
- Yeah, we've been doing okay.

1119
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,360
No, it's more than okay.

1120
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:50,083
We're thinking what you could do
with some real money behind you.

1121
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:52,291
So, what exactly are you proposing?

1122
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:54,583
We're proposing an expansion.

1123
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:57,666
We wanna take your restaurant
and make it bigger than ihop.

1124
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,666
We wanna turn baker's into a franchise.

1125
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,041
Oh, wow.

1126
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:05,541
Wow.

1127
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:06,833
I got goose bumps.

1128
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,916
Yeah. I got something too.

1129
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:11,666
Bye.

1130
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,041
- Bye.
- All right, ladies. Drive safe.

1131
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:17,833
What do you think?

1132
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:21,458
I think the idea sounds very exciting.

1133
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,875
I'm not sure why we need to do it though.

1134
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:26,375
I mean, the sauce is doing so well,
we bought the house...

1135
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:27,875
But this is just the beginning.

1136
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:30,208
This could be everything
we've ever dreamt of.

1137
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:31,500
I don't know.

1138
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,101
- Bye. Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

1139
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:35,250
What do we even know
about starting a franchise?

1140
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,559
Nothing. But what did I know
about starting a restaurant?

1141
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:40,583
This is different.
I mean, it would be a huge change.

1142
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:42,291
- Change is good.
- Is it?

1143
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:43,895
- Hi, welcome to baker's.
- Hey.

1144
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:48,458
When dom got drafted to the league,
he promised me that nothing would change.

1145
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:51,875
But it did. I mean, I knew
he would be on the road a lot.

1146
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:54,208
But then he started saying "yes"
to everything.

1147
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,541
And then, between the endorsements,
and the appearances,

1148
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:57,958
it was like he was never home.

1149
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:00,250
And when he was home,
he was too tired to be present.

1150
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:01,875
Look, I know I can make this work.

1151
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:04,708
But I won't do it
without your full support.

1152
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:07,208
Us being on the same page
means everything to me.

1153
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:15,416
- Let's do it!
- Really?

1154
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Really!

1155
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:26,208
- I want ice cream.
- Where's deja?

1156
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:27,500
I don't know.

1157
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:30,583
- Go-gurt is so good, right?
- This yogurt is pretty good.

Deja's a girl?

1165
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:45,458
Yeah, duh.

1166
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:47,916
Are you wearing makeup?

1167
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,281
It's no big deal.
They're having a pep rally after school,

1168
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:53,017
- so I figured I'd just change it up.
- Where's the rest of your skirt?

1169
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,166
That's Chris. I've gotta go.

1170
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,791
W-Wait, wait!
Since when is Chris just a part...

1171
00:55:57,875 --> 00:55:58,875
Oh, my goodness.

1172
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,166
What?

1173
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:04,708
I had no idea what was under all those
baggy clothes and basketball shorts.

1174
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,583
My baby's a woman.

1175
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:09,500
- A woman that could be in a Drake video.
- Good one.

1176
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,875
All right. That's it.
None of you girls are ever dating.

1177
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:14,166
- That's sexist.
- You know what? You're right.

1178
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,791
None of you are ever dating.

1179
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:18,541
Boo!

1180
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,458
Whoa!

1181
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:22,708
Yo, who was the baddie
with the fat Kardashian butt?

1182
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:23,958
That was your sister.

1183
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:28,833
That's what you get for looking at butts.

1184
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,666
Sorry, bin laden, no more room.

1185
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,250
Dude, I'm an Indian, not a Saudi.

1186
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:41,500
If you're gonna insult someone based on
their race, at least get it right.

1187
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:43,333
How about we roast your busted nikes?

1188
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:46,416
Get out of here, bro.

1189
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:58,208
Smooth. She totally didn't see you panic
and look away.

1190
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,583
- Wait, she didn't?
- No.

1191
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,500
- See, I told you he keeps looking at me.
- I know.

1192
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:07,833
Dude, now she thinks you're a stalker.

1193
00:57:07,916 --> 00:57:08,916
Oh, shut up.

1194
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,708
Night, deej. Don't stay up too late, okay?

1195
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:15,208
- Hey... hey, Paul?
- Yeah?

1196
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:17,541
Uh… got a quick sec?

1197
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:19,458
Sure.

1198
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:20,958
What's going on?

1199
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:24,791
Okay, well,

1200
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:27,250
- you know I'm turning 14 in a few months…
- yeah.

1201
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:31,166
- …and I don't know anything about girls.
- Mmm.

1202
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,208
So I was wondering if you and me

1203
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:35,333
could talk about
everything there is to know.

1204
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:38,000
Um, I think that this might be

1205
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:40,333
a better conversation
for you to have with your dad.

1206
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:43,958
No way. Me and my dad,
we have nothing in common.

1207
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,833
I feel like you and I,
we connect on a much deeper level.

1208
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:50,083
Aw, dj. That is so sweet.

1209
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,250
I mean, he's this super successful,
handsome athlete

1210
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:54,666
who can basically do everything.

1211
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,708
- You're the complete opposite.
- Oh.

1212
00:57:56,791 --> 00:58:01,250
You're an ordinary guy like me
with average looks and ordinary body.

1213
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:04,125
Wow. Okay,
that's starting to be a-a little hurtful.

1214
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:07,708
- Well, there's this girl, Talia.
- Mmm.

1215
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:09,333
She's really pretty.

1216
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:11,500
Okay, um, let me think.

1217
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:14,875
Um, the best way to get in good
with a girl, I think,

1218
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,041
is to find out what she likes

1219
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:20,875
and kind of use that as an icebreaker
to get your foot in the door.

1220
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:22,416
Yeah, that makes sense.

1221
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,541
Thanks for being
so average and relatable, Paul.

1222
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:28,000
I am always here to be ordinary for you.

1223
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:33,458
Dad put Seth on register duty.

1224
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:35,208
So?

1225
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:37,500
It's pathetic. So transparent.

1226
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:38,625
What do you mean?

1227
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:40,833
It's the classic trust-building move.

1228
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:45,125
He's giving Seth more responsibility
so Seth will feel more secure, less angry,

1229
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:48,708
and less likely to stab us in our sleep.

1230
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:50,916
He sleeps in my room.

1231
00:58:52,416 --> 00:58:53,875
Sleep lightly, bro.

1232
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,500
- Babe. That was Melanie and Michele.
- Hmm.

1233
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:10,623
They want us to come up north next weekend
and look at new restaurant spaces.

1234
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:13,583
- What? Wow! Oh, my god, that's exciting.
- Yeah.

1235
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:15,125
Wait, wait, next weekend?

1236
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,791
It's deja's first game.

1237
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:20,500
Oh, right.
Okay, I'll tell them never mind.

1238
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:23,750
- No, no. Go. Go without me. It's fine.
- I'm not gonna go without you.

1239
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:26,416
Yeah, it's one trip.
There'll be plenty more. It's fine.

1240
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,958
- It won't be as fun without you.
- No, it won't be.

1241
00:59:31,291 --> 00:59:35,000
Hey, hey. Hold up. I need to talk to you
about the cash register situation.

1242
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:36,500
- Um, I was...
- Yeah,

1243
00:59:36,583 --> 00:59:39,708
I'm super impressed with how
you're handling this new responsibility.

1244
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,250
- Really?
- Yes.

1245
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:45,041
Congratulations,
you got yourself a permanent position.

1246
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:48,541
And here is a little something
for all your hard work.

1247
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,041
- Thanks, Paul.
- Good job, bud.

1248
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:57,541
Uh, Seth,

1249
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:00,250
really proud of you, kid.

1250
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:01,333
Thanks, Zoey.

1251
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,916
You're gonna be okay without me, right?

1252
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,166
Yes, you're going to San Francisco,
not war.

1253
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:29,875
I'm just saying we can afford
a little help now if you need it.

1254
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:32,166
- Go. I'm fine.
- Okay. Have fun. I love you.

1255
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,416
- I love you.
- Bye.

1256
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:36,083
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1257
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,250
Got you.

1258
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,559
Oh, whoa. Where do you two think
you're going with those?

1259
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,666
- You said we had a playdate.
- You can't bring those to our playdate.

1260
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,541
But they're just toys.

1261
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:50,125
That you convinced us to buy,
then taught us how to shoot.

1262
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:55,541
Yes, admittedly, they are hours of fun,
but those are only for inside the house.

1263
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:59,208
Okay? Never outside.
All right? It's not safe.

1264
01:01:00,416 --> 01:01:02,083
But chin up.

1265
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:05,166
Because there's so many other fun things
to do over there. I promise.

1266
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,541
- Die! Die!
- I got you!

1267
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:10,000
Guys,
there's so many other fun ways to play.

1268
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,791
Please, just let us feel our feelings.

1269
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:13,875
Yeah.

1270
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:17,541
Okay. Okay.

1271
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:23,500
- Oh, my kids are so over me.
- Mmm.

1272
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:26,208
Oh. Mine were never into me.

1273
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:29,958
- Hi, Anne.
- Hi, Trish.

1274
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,083
Oh, wow.

1275
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:35,375
Oh, those kids are so cute.

1276
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:36,750
Oh, thank you.

1277
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:38,750
And how long have you been the nanny for?

1278
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:42,833
Anne…
…this is Zoey.

1279
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,500
She's the new mom in the group.

1280
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:45,750
- Oh…
- surprise!

1281
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,916
Oh, I did it again.

1282
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,250
Oh, "again."

1283
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:52,583
I am so sorry. Oh, my goodness.

1284
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:57,083
I had absolutely no idea.
Never seen you in any of the mom groups.

1285
01:01:57,166 --> 01:02:00,791
No, it's... it's fine. It's fine.
You know what? It's an honest mistake.

1286
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:03,083
Well, I'm Anne Vaughn. Hi, zo.

1287
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:04,625
"Ey." yep.

1288
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:07,833
Nice to meet you. And I also adopted.

1289
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,541
Those are my children. Ming and Kenny.

1290
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:14,583
Okay. Okay.

1291
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:17,833
Well, I am Zoey.

1292
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:23,125
And those are my biracial children, uh,
Bronx and Bailey,

1293
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:25,750
that I conceived with my husband…

1294
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:30,416
…and then I birthed them
through my very own personal uterus.

1295
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:33,500
Okay, I could use some wine, Trish.

1296
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:38,375
- Listen, I don't wanna make this awkward…
- Yeah, we all could.

1297
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:40,166
…but it's just so frustrating.

1298
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:42,958
People have so many preconceived notions
about my kids.

1299
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:46,791
That, like, they're not mine
or there's too many of them…

1300
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,625
…or they're too wild!

1301
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:51,458
Mom! Mom!

1302
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,750
Was that a stray rottweiler
running down the bike path?

1303
01:02:55,541 --> 01:02:57,875
What is going on? Whose kids are those?

1304
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:00,666
Uh…
Look at the time. It's wine o' clock.

1305
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,791
Wait!

1306
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:06,583
Y'all know these espadrilles
weren't made for running!

1307
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:07,666
Come on!

1308
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,791
Hi, I'm chef baker.

1309
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:27,125
Let's go, hornets!

1310
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:28,625
Come on, defense!

1311
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:35,916
Mommy, when's deja gonna play?

1312
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,333
I don't know, sweetie.

1313
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:44,333
- Hey, what's up, guys?
- Chris! Chris! Chris!

1314
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,500
- Hey, Mrs. Baker.
- How you doing?

1315
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:50,166
Mr. Clayton. Wow.
You're here cheering on deja too?

1316
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:52,541
- Sure are.
- Nice to meet you.

1317
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:55,208
"Too"?

1318
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,166
Who the hell is that?

1319
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,541
Well, I mean,
it's definitely not deja's boyfriend

1320
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,500
who we're not supposed
to be telling you about.

1321
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:10,041
Dom, he's putting her in.

1322
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:11,583
Hey! Here we go, deja!

1323
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:13,958
Come on, baby! Come on, dej!

1324
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:16,125
Not you, Clayton. Baron, you're in.

1325
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:18,666
I'm sorry.

1326
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:22,208
What?

1327
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:26,083
Baron? Look, I've seen her in practice,
and she's a garbage player.

1328
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:29,416
I mean, who would pick a baron
when you got a Clayton?

1329
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,041
Well, I hope usc gives out scholarships
for riding the bench.

1330
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:43,416
Whoa. Whoa. Where you guys going?

1331
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,791
We're scared.

1332
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:46,708
There's a monster under our bed.

1333
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:49,000
Have you tried monster spray?

1334
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:50,750
What's monster spray?

1335
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:53,250
- You've never heard of monster spray?
- No.

1336
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:56,291
It works every time. Come on.
I'll show you how to make it.

1337
01:04:56,375 --> 01:05:00,583
Does it make their eyes pop out
and blood spurt everywhere?

1338
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:05,375
Sure. Blood. Guts. Everything.

1339
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:06,583
Cool.

1340
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,791
Hey! How's deja doing?

1341
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:16,500
You know, ego's a little bruised,
but she'll live.

1342
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:18,166
Why won't she talk to me?

1343
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:22,416
Because she's a moody teenage girl
and you're her annoying mom.

1344
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,250
Mom is the one who bandages her boo-boos

1345
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:27,041
and was in the trenches with her
every day.

1346
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:28,958
Yeah, but mom's not the athlete.

1347
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:32,375
Mom doesn't know what it's like to put
her blood, sweat and tears onto the court,

1348
01:05:32,458 --> 01:05:35,083
and walk away with nothing
but aching muscles and a broken heart.

1349
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:36,791
Let daddy have this one.

1350
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,041
Okay.

1351
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:46,791
Oh, and you don't have to call yourself
"daddy" when there's no kids around.

1352
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,000
Oh.

1353
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:50,125
Got it. Got it. Daddy hears that.

1354
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:55,375
So, what do you think?

1355
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,333
I mean, I guess it could work,

1356
01:05:57,416 --> 01:06:01,875
but only if we take what's here
and, like, rip it all out and burn it.

1357
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,625
- Sounds like we should keep looking.
- Yeah.

1358
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:07,125
In the meantime, let's talk menus.

1359
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:10,375
Yes! By the way, Zoey made a list
of all these local vendors.

1360
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:11,791
- Local?
- Yeah.

1361
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:15,333
The customers love it and it's awesome
for the organic farm community.

1362
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:17,250
Look, we love organic farmers.

1363
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:19,166
- They're a fun bunch.
- Yeah, so fun!

1364
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,791
But we like to use larger wholesalers
to cut costs.

1365
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:23,083
So many costs.

1366
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:27,125
- Wait, really?
- But, with that said, let's get into it.

1367
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:29,416
Yeah!
If it makes sense, we'll totally do it.

1368
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,083
Okay, great. Should we get out of here?

1369
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:33,726
- Yeah!
- Smells like sadness.

1370
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:35,708
- Okay. We got you.
- And mouse poop.

1371
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:41,791
Zo, I still can't believe
you have ten kids and no nanny.

1372
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:45,041
Wait. You have ten kids? Consensually?

1373
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:47,541
Well, technically, they're not all mine.

1374
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:50,333
You know,
three are from Paul's first marriage.

1375
01:06:50,416 --> 01:06:53,916
And then we took in our nephew
who was getting into some bad stuff.

1376
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,166
You know, fighting, and gangs and…

1377
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:58,250
Oh, no. That's awful.

1378
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:03,666
And you're bringing him here to this safe,
equity-growing, gated community.

1379
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,458
I mean, it's so thoughtful of you.

1380
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:08,250
You and Paul should come over
for dinner sometime.

1381
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:11,000
Oh, gosh. That would be great.
You know, whenever he gets back.

1382
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:14,083
Ever since this whole franchise thing
started, he's always gone.

1383
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:17,375
Right now, he's up in San Francisco
looking for potential restaurant venues.

1384
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:18,791
That's how it always goes.

1385
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:21,355
Dad's jet-setting away
while mom's stuck at home with the kids.

1386
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,833
Yes. Ugh. I agree.

1387
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:25,666
Shockingly, I enjoy being with my kids.

1388
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,541
- I do too.
- I do too. Yeah.

1389
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:29,500
That's hilarious. "I do too."

1390
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,500
You guys are funny.

1391
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,333
Hello? Anybody home?

1392
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:38,333
Daddy!

1393
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:39,708
What'd you bring us?

1394
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:43,375
Bring you? I thought me arriving home
safely was your present?

1395
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:44,916
- Boo!
- Boo?

1396
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,291
Boo, you guys! Oh, no!
Wait, I forgot all the presents.

1397
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:50,583
I don't know why you guys think
I got you something.

1398
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,291
I don't know what's in here.

1399
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:56,708
Who put this in here? A warriors Jersey!

1400
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:58,000
Thanks, Paul!

1401
01:07:58,083 --> 01:07:59,958
- Golden gate legos.
- Yo! Yo, thanks.

1402
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:01,541
Alcatraz hat.

1403
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:02,833
Sick, thanks!

1404
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:04,250
Tupac sweatshirt.

1405
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:05,333
What's up?

1406
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:07,375
I wonder who this is for? iPhone case.

1407
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,166
- Thank you!
- 49ers socks.

1408
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,833
- Did we get anything?
- Cool.

1409
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:12,500
Like a hat or something else?

1410
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:15,750
Oh, no. What happened?
All that's left are my clothes.

1411
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:17,375
I'm so sorry, guys.

1412
01:08:17,457 --> 01:08:19,416
- But we're your best children.
- Yeah.

1413
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,082
You're right. You are my best children.

1414
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:25,041
Let me see what...
Hotel chocolates and soap!

1415
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,750
Yay!

1416
01:08:26,832 --> 01:08:27,957
Candy!

1417
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:29,916
Soap!

1418
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,250
- Thank you, daddy! Thank you!
- Thanks, dad!

1419
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:33,875
They love soap.

1420
01:08:33,957 --> 01:08:35,457
I don't know why. They don't use it.

1421
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:38,791
Well played, Mr. Baker.

1422
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:44,582
And of course, I couldn't come home
without a souvenir for mommy.

1423
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:46,166
What?

1424
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:48,125
Babe.

1425
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,500
It's beautiful.

1426
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:57,082
Baby, you didn't have to do this.
I love my ring.

1427
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,125
I know, but I've been wanting
to do this forever,

1428
01:08:59,207 --> 01:09:01,125
and I'm finally in a position
where I could.

1429
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:04,125
That's the ring I should have bought you
ten years ago.

1430
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:06,875
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1431
01:09:06,957 --> 01:09:12,625
Well, out with the old
and in with the bling.

1432
01:09:12,707 --> 01:09:15,082
Whoa!

1433
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:17,207
- You like it?
- I love it.

1434
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,250
- Hey, man.
- Yo.

1435
01:09:24,332 --> 01:09:25,332
I got you something.

1436
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:28,625
Dude, what's this?

1437
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:32,000
So you can get rid of those busted kicks
you keep getting clowned for.

1438
01:09:32,082 --> 01:09:34,957
Ah. Nah, dog.
You... you got it all wrong. Okay?

1439
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:38,125
Like, me and my boys at school,
we just go back and forth like that. I...

1440
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:39,457
Stop. No, seriously.

1441
01:09:40,207 --> 01:09:42,375
You're making this uncomfortable
for both of us.

1442
01:09:42,457 --> 01:09:45,582
Now, I've seen what's been going on
at school, and I've been there.

1443
01:09:45,666 --> 01:09:47,416
I used to get clowned all the time.

1444
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,517
Shut up. You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

1445
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:51,582
All right, dude. D-Dude. I'm serious.

1446
01:09:52,332 --> 01:09:53,500
You know, look at me.

1447
01:09:54,082 --> 01:09:56,833
I've always been the weirdo
with the messed-up mom and no dad.

1448
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:02,250
Open them.

1449
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,708
Yo!

1450
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,500
Dude, these... these kicks are dope.

1451
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:18,000
All right, but I can't take these.
Where'd you even get the money from?

1452
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,500
Don't worry about it.

1453
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:22,375
You know, all you need to do
is keep those jerks off your back.

1454
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:23,458
I'm gonna help you.

1455
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:25,375
I'll teach you how to defend yourself.

1456
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:26,458
Let's do this.

1457
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,583
Hey, guess what.

1458
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:33,583
Melanie and Michele wanna fly me back up
to look at restaurant spaces

1459
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:34,666
over the next few days.

1460
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,031
- Again? You were just there.
- I know, I'm surprised too.

1461
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:38,976
They said it's important
to nail it all down now.

1462
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,934
I thought we were all gonna talk
about it on the call tomorrow.

1463
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:43,375
Yeah, I guess they have, like,
a bunch of meetings tomorrow.

1464
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:45,458
So we just kinda ended up
talking about it now.

1465
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:48,666
- Wait. Why didn't you come get me?
- Because you were giving the twins a bath.

1466
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,125
And you didn't say you had to wait for me?

1467
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,392
Well, they just started talking,
and it was exciting and...

1468
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,666
Babe, can I at least show you
what we talked about?

1469
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:56,916
It's really exciting.

1470
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,833
Look. Look at this.
Wait. Wait for it. Look at that.

1471
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:02,708
- Whoa.
- Right?

1472
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,958
- Look at this.
- That's beautiful.

1473
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:07,583
We could put a huge chalkboard right here.

1474
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:11,125
A-And do a list of all the local vendors
and their farms.

1475
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:13,041
About the local vendors,

1476
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:16,000
they say that it's gonna be too expensive
now that we're expanding.

1477
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:20,083
Those personal touches are what makes
baker's breakfast, baker's breakfast.

1478
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:22,916
And then the name is another thing too.

1479
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,541
I guess there's already a franchise that's
baker's breakfast buffet or something,

1480
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:31,750
and they're really worried
that our branding will get confused.

1481
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:34,416
- So, we're changing our name too?
- But they said don't worry.

1482
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,958
They're gonna put, like,
a huge marketing team behind it.

1483
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:38,333
Wait. Wait. Why? Why?

1484
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:40,416
Didn't you tell them
I have a degree in marketing?

1485
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,180
I mean,
I came up with "baker's breakfast."

1486
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:44,166
Yeah, but, babe,
it wasn't that revolutionary.

1487
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,791
It's just my name and what I serve.

1488
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:56,625
So, last I checked,
it was our name and what we serve.

1489
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,767
I didn't mean it like that.
I just mean that, you know...

1490
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:00,625
I'm the face of the company. I'm the chef.

1491
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:02,416
Look, I barely know the Malibu Barbies,

1492
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,166
and I get that they
don't value my opinion,

1493
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:08,958
but I can't believe that you're trying
to edge me out too.

1494
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:12,083
I am not trying to edge you out, baby.
Come on. I promise.

1495
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:14,750
I barely know them. I just...
I don't wanna create any obstacles.

1496
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:17,541
Oh, so now I'm an obstacle. Right.

1497
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:22,750
Come on. I didn't mean it like that.
Look, Zoey, this is my dream.

1498
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:28,750
Right. Your dream. And I'm dreamless.

1499
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:31,375
I'm going to bed,

1500
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:33,416
but I won't dream.

1501
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:49,208
- Yo!
- Oh! Geez.

1502
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:52,541
Could my kids stay at my house?
Would that help while he's gone?

1503
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:55,875
- Um, thank you for that offer, but no.
- Mm-hmm.

1504
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:58,875
All the twins love
to have them here, so no.

1505
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,291
- We're good.
- Mm-hmm.

1506
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:04,333
- I could move in.
- No. We're good. We are so good.

1507
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:06,875

Morning, mommy.

1527

- Ready.
- How's this outfit?

1528

Whatever.

1531

Hey.

1532
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:19,083
Hey. It's so good to hear your voice.
How's everything going?

1533
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:21,916
Oh, you know, house is messy.
Restaurant's busy.

1534
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,041
The littles went to school

1535
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:26,666
dressed like complete maniacs
five out of five days this week,

1536
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:30,125
but at least you'll be home tomorrow
to help me get it all back on track.

1537
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:34,208
Uh, listen, about that. You might have
to hold things down a little bit longer.

1538
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:36,208
They want me to stay an extra week.

1539
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:39,666
A week? What about dj's birthday party?

1540
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,750
I'll be back in time for the party, babe.
I'm so sorry. Don't be mad at me.

1541
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:44,791
There's just so many things
I gotta finalize.

1542
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:46,791
Please do not miss his party.

1543
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:51,583
What?

1544
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:53,500
Hi, I'm Zoey baker.

1545
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:54,583
Hi, I'm Kate baker.

1546
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:56,958
I got a call about my son, haresh baker.

1547
01:14:57,041 --> 01:14:59,333
Oh, I didn't know haresh had two moms.

1548
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:00,958
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

1549
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:02,416
Oh, no. No. We're not together.

1550
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,833
Oh, I'm sorry.

1551
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,625
Oh, no. We never were.

1552
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:07,458
- But life is long.
- Not that long.

1553
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:09,125
Oh, Robert. Thank goodness.

1554
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:11,125
Mrs. and Mrs. Baker.
Thank you for coming in.

1555
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:13,875
- Oh, no. No problem. Where's haresh?
- What happened?

1556
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:17,458
Yo, Trent! I stand against bullying!

1557
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:19,642
- What are you...
- Racist trash,

1558
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:21,333
I'll kill you and your Nana!

1559
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,166
Get off me, dude! Get off me!

1560
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:26,166
Chill out, bro. I'm warning you.
You mess with him, you mess with me.

1561
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,583
Yeah. And if you mess with him,
you mess with me. Whoa!

1562
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:31,750
You're saying haresh attacked
the other boy?

1563
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:32,833
My haresh?

1564
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:34,916
I'm as surprised as you,

1565
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,666
but I... I still need to suspend him
for a week.

1566
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:39,767
- All right. I'm passing. Yeah.
- I'm open. I'm open.

1567
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:42,333
- Gaming?
- You said, "go to your room."

1568
01:15:42,416 --> 01:15:44,336
Because you're grounded,
not to play video games.

1569
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:46,517
Come on. It's not haresh's fault.
The guys at school...

1570
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,125
I don't care whose fault it is.

1571
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:49,934
You both could have gotten
kicked out of school.

1572
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:51,291
Hand over the remotes now.

1573
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,875
Dad leaves,
and you all lose your minds all at once.

1574
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:01,708
- Hey. Where are you going?
- I have plans with Chris.

1575
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:02,708
- Now?
- Tonight.

1576
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:04,208
No way. No.

1577
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:06,171
Babe, you've got homework
and practice tomorrow.

1578
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,476
And besides, I need your help
with your brothers and sisters

1579
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,500
until Paul gets back.

1580
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:12,291
And when's that?
It's not like he's ever here anymore.

1581
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:15,791
You know what? Hand over the keys.

1582
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:17,625
This is so unfair.

1583
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:21,666
- Hey, if she's not using those, then…
- don't even.

1584
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:24,166
My life is a nightmare.

1585
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:26,500
All their damn minds.

1586
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,125
Mmm.

1587
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:54,791
What do you think?

1588
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:58,875
I don't understand.
I thought we were seeing new spaces.

1589
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:01,666
I thought we agreed this place
smelled like mouse poop.

1590
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,958
And why are there lunch items
on this menu?

1591
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:06,875
Marketing collected some data.
People love soup.

1592
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:09,125
Last we checked,
there are no breakfast soups.

1593
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,708
Well, if they want soup,
they can eat at a nursing home.

1594
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:14,208
I do breakfast. That's my thing.
I'm the breakfast guy.

1595
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:17,541
Stop thinking small.
You're not a mom-and-pop anymore.

1596
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,916
Oh, my god. My son's birthday party.

1597
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,791
I'm so sorry. I have to go.
You can shred this though.

1598
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:26,041
- Wait!
- Breakfast!

1599
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:27,125
What?

1600
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:29,142
Trish, we're all set.

1601
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:30,791
I put out all the brains and guts.

1602
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:35,416
Zoey, I'm loving the zombie theme.
That green cotton candy is genius.

1603
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,458
Oh, thank you. I had no idea
everything that went into it.

1604
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:41,250
You know, Paul and I usually plan
all these kids' parties together.

1605
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:43,083
I can't believe he's still
in San Francisco.

1606
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:44,958
I know.
He should be back any minute though.

1607
01:17:45,041 --> 01:17:47,125
But I have to go upstairs.

1608
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:50,083
Dj and deja
don't wanna come out of their rooms.

1609
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,333
Ugh, tell me about it.

1610
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:53,750
Madison didn't come out of her room
for two years.

1611
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,333
Well, if you guys need anything, ask Kate.

1612
01:17:57,416 --> 01:18:01,541
She's always really helpful.
No, she is not, so enjoy that.

1613
01:18:01,625 --> 01:18:05,250
Isn't it wild that we were both macaws
in another life?

1614
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:07,708
- Totally.
- Isn't flying phenomenal?

1615
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:09,000
You're phenomenal.

1616
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:13,333
Who cares about some stupid party, right?

1617
01:18:13,416 --> 01:18:14,958
I mean, nobody wants to walk around

1618
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:19,416
with some beautiful, rare, exotic bird
perched on their shoulder.

1619
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,916
I mean, I know I don't.

1620
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,083
I feel you.

1621
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:26,601
- I know, right.
- That's what I was thinking too.

1622
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:28,125
- Yeah.
- No way.

1623
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:30,458
So excited.

1624
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:34,750
Dj! What are you doing?
Your party started 15 minutes ago.

1625
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:36,208
I need to talk to Paul.

1626
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:39,000
Sweetheart, I don't know where Paul is,
but you can talk to me.

1627
01:18:39,083 --> 01:18:40,291
This is guy stuff, mom.

1628
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,708
Okay. What... what about your dad?

1629
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:44,958
No! Definitely not.

1630
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:48,000
It's fine. I'll just do what Paul said.

1631
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:50,875
I'll be down in a sec. I promise.

1632
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,500
Excuse me.

1633
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:58,958
Your attention please. Flight number 5543…

1634
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:01,125
Excuse me. I'm so sorry. I'm late.

1635
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:03,583
All passengers…

1636
01:19:03,666 --> 01:19:04,666
Woo-hoo!

1637
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,934
- I thought I wasn't going to make it.
- I'm sorry, sir,

1638
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:09,267
the doors have already been closed.
We're no longer boarding.

1639
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:11,625
Oh, no, no. Please, please.
It's my son's birthday party.

1640
01:19:11,708 --> 01:19:14,208
I gotta make it home.
Look how sweet he is.

1641
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:19,958
Aw. A black son. By all means.

1642
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,708
Please extend the jetway.

1643
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,500
- Really?
- No, I am not extending the jetway.

1644
01:19:26,291 --> 01:19:27,291
Well, uh…

1645
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:30,833
look, um, I make the most amazing sauce.

1646
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:34,000
It's hot, sweet, and savory,
and I promise you,

1647
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:38,500
I will provide you with a lifetime supply
if you let me get on this flight.

1648
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:40,125
What do you say?

1649
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:48,166
Sir. Sir!

1650
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:52,875
So it's hot, sweet or savory
depending on what you put it on.

1651
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:55,458
Damn racist talking about,
"do you want some hot sauce?"

1652
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,666
You know I want some hot sauce.
Still don't mean you should ask.

1653
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:05,500
I love the dry ice, by the way.

1654
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:07,291
- Very nice touch.
- Thank you.

1655
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:09,083
Hey, where's dj?

1656
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:11,366
Madison's been looking for him.
I think she has a crush.

1657
01:20:11,416 --> 01:20:13,250
I have no idea what's keeping dj.

1658
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,625
Oh, goodness.

1659
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:18,541
- You invited Anne?
- I did not invite Anne.

1660
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:20,625
She's just come to curse the party.

1661
01:20:20,708 --> 01:20:24,458
Hi. This party is adorable.

1662
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:28,000
It's so throwback that you don't have
any celebrity performers.

1663
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:29,375
It's like when we were kids,

1664
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:31,791
and our parents just could not
be bothered with us.

1665
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:37,375
Anyways, you guys. This is very upsetting.

1666
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:41,500
There've been a series of break-ins
in the neighborhood.

1667
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:43,416
- That's awful.
- Terrible.

1668
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:47,291
Oh, and this is for the birthday boy.

1669
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:50,333
And I'd love to meet your family.
Where is your nephew?

1670
01:20:51,083 --> 01:20:52,666
Wait. Why do you ask?

1671
01:20:53,333 --> 01:20:54,333
I was just curious.

1672
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:57,083
And also, just out of total curiosity,

1673
01:20:57,166 --> 01:21:01,208
do you know
where he was last night at 9:32?

1674
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:03,041
Are you seriously suggesting

1675
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:06,041
that my nephew had something
to do with these break-ins?

1676
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:08,791
No. No.

1677
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,791
I just...

1678
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:12,875
I mean, you said yourself

1679
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:15,541
that he had gotten into a lot of trouble
before he came here.

1680
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:18,000
Yeah,
that doesn't make him a criminal, Anne.

1681
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:21,916
And I'll have you know
that my family is honorable, all right?

1682
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,541
We are law-abiding citizens.
We are pillars of society.

That's a phase that he's in.

1694
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:56,750
You know,
he likes to dress up and do the cosplay.

1695
01:21:57,541 --> 01:21:59,125
Hey, Talia. What's up?

1696
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:00,958

Oh! Oh, no. Ugh.

1699
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:09,625
Zoey, did you find the candles yet?

1700
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:11,375
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1701
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:14,458
Zoey, what's taking so long
with the candles? Everyone wants cake.

1702
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:16,916
Wait, wait, wait.
Those are the only candles I have left.

1703
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,750
Zoey, we've got a problem.

1704
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:20,791
What's going on?
I thought you were upstairs.

1705
01:22:20,875 --> 01:22:23,458
No, she snuck out
and spent the night at her boyfriend's.

1706
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:24,541
What?

1707
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:27,041
Whoa.

1708
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:30,625
I got grounded for fighting.
You're never leaving this house again.

1709
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:33,541
Yeah, I went to the school to watch
her practice, and she wasn't there.

1710
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:37,708
Okay, we've got a party going on outside.
Let's just talk about this later.

1711
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:39,500
No, we'll discuss this right now.

1712
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:42,666
- This is on you, Zoey.
- Me? How is this on me?

1713
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,291
Yeah, yeah. This is on you.

1714
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:48,166
And that clueless white dude who
has no idea how to raise my black kids.

1715
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:50,708
Okay, you sound insane.

1716
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:53,166
And our black kids
are being raised just fine.

1717
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:55,083
Ugh, darn it. I smudged my liner.

1718
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:57,500
This seem right to you?

1719
01:22:58,041 --> 01:23:00,125
Yeah, he's executed a perfect smoky eye.

1720
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,541
- Great job, honey.
- Thanks, mom.

1721
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:04,916
I'm so sorry I'm late.
You will not believe what happened to me.

1722
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,541
I had to charter a jet, babe.

1723
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:09,625
Wow! Dj, what is this outfit?

1724
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:12,541
Just doing what you told me to do
to get girls. And look, it's working!

1725
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:15,750
- You told my son to be a satanist?
- No. No, no, no.

1726
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:19,333
I told him to get into
whatever the girl he likes is into.

1727
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:22,208
I didn't know
that she was into punk rock fonzie.

1728
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:24,958
Why are you even talking to my son
about any of these things?

1729
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:26,833
'Cause he knows me better than you do,
dad.

1730
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:29,583
What's my favorite color?
Who's my favorite superhero?

1731
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:33,166
Name five rules
for surviving a zombie apocalypse. Go!

1732
01:23:34,458 --> 01:23:35,458
Okay, look.

1733
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:39,886
I don't need to know how to kill
a zombie to know how to raise my son.

1734
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:42,226
You think any of this mess
would happen with me in charge?

1735
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,166
Really? 'Cause you did such a terrific job
the last time?

1736
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:48,583
Yeah, whatever.
This whole house is out of control.

1737
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:50,916
You got kids fighting
and getting suspended,

1738
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,833
and spending all night
at some boy's house!

1739
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:55,208
- Who spent the night at a boy's house?
- Deja.

1740
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:56,458
What?

1741
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:58,916
And since when do you skip practice?

1742
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,680
Since I stopped playing basketball.
I quit.

1743
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:03,250
You can't quit.
You've worked too hard for this.

1744
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:06,094
Who cares? They won't put me in anyway
since we didn't donate the gym.

1745
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:09,208
No. No, no. We got scouts from so coming
to that game on Saturday.

1746
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:10,750
You are not just gonna walk away.

1747
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:13,000
You understand?
This is your life we're talking about.

1748
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:15,000
Yeah, and basketball's only part of it.

1749
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,458
I loved it because I love my team,

1750
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:18,583
but it sucks playing
with those stupid, snobby girls

1751
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:20,000
at that stupid, snobby school.

1752
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:22,500
You can't quit
just 'cause you don't like your teammates.

1753
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:25,392
- You can't force me to play.
- You know what? This is ridiculous.

1754
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:27,833
I'm not leaving my kids in this madhouse
another minute.

1755
01:24:27,916 --> 01:24:30,958
And you guys can forget
about joint custody. I'm filing for full.

1756
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:32,625
You are being ridiculous.

1757
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:34,625
- I'm not living with you.
- Oh, yes, you are.

1758
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:36,708
And, deja,
you're playing in that game on Saturday.

1759
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:39,559
Yeah, and then you're gonna come
straight home, because you're grounded.

1760
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:41,809
- Chris and I were going to the movies...
- No more Chris.

1761
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:43,726
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can. Can I do that?

1762
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,000
- Yes, you can.
- Good, 'cause I just did. No more Chris.

1763
01:24:46,083 --> 01:24:47,916
That's not fair.
Chris is the only good thing

1764
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,333
that's happened to me
since I've been here. I hate it here.

1765
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:52,041
We all do.

1766
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:54,666
A rent-a-cop trails mom
every time she leaves the house.

1767
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,916
People here call Harley's ramp an eyesore.

1768
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,666
Bronx and Bailey are too scared to sleep.

1769
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:03,500
And haresh is getting his face kicked
in by losers at school all the time.

1770
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:06,166
Yo! Your boy got a few hits in. Trust.

1771
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:09,916
I honestly thought you were all happy.

1772
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,291
No, you're happy.
And you didn't notice that we aren't,

1773
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:14,015
because as soon as you made us move here,

1774
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:17,000
you took off to do your dumb franchise
and left us here to deal with it.

1775
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:22,583
Wow. I didn't know
we were allowed to go off like that.

1776
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,916
I've missed so many opportunities.

1777
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,583
Okay, deja isn't "going off." Okay?

1778
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:31,458
She's speaking honestly
about her feelings.

1779
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:33,583
Which is how we've raised you all to be.

1780
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:36,041
So I'm glad you spoke up.

1781
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:38,416
- Really?
- Yep.

1782
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,416
Yeah, your mom is right.

1783
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,750
Look, let's calm down,
and let's go to the party.

1784
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:46,875
- Look, I... let me...
- Dom, please. Please, for dj.

1785
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:49,041
Here we go.

1786
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:51,375
- Okay, come on.
- Everybody... hey, resh.

1787
01:25:51,458 --> 01:25:53,500
- You're grounded.
- Dad!

1788
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:01,333
Deja.
That is so incredibly out of line, huh?

1789
01:26:01,416 --> 01:26:04,083
Babe, you just said
that you were glad that she spoke up.

1790
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:06,541
Because I'm trying
to be a united front, Zoey.

1791
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:10,083
I mean, does she not have any idea
how hard I'm trying to make all this work?

1792
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:13,000
Paul, you gotta face it.

1793
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:15,750
It's not gonna work,
because it's not working.

1794
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:18,791
This neighborhood. The schools.
The franchise.

1795
01:26:18,875 --> 01:26:20,291
None of it is right for us.

1796
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:22,291
Why are you just telling me this now?

1797
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:26,458
Well, babe,
because I was proud and so excited

1798
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:28,750
watching you go big with your sauce.

1799
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:32,833
And I... I just went along with
all the other bigger and better stuff too.

1800
01:26:33,333 --> 01:26:36,208
Of course, I... I wanna give our kids more.

1801
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:38,791
Let's just do it our way
like we always have.

1802
01:26:43,625 --> 01:26:44,625
Wow.

1803
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:50,583
I've been gone so much I really had
no idea everyone was this unhappy.

1804
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:52,750
I don't know. I guess, I just...

1805
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:58,083
I was trying to prove to you that I could
give everybody everything they wanted.

1806
01:26:58,166 --> 01:27:00,458
I don't know.
I got carried away by those Barbies,

1807
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:02,666
and they almost convinced me
to make lunch.

1808
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,875
That's blasphemy.

1809
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:08,416
But you're right. I can feel it.
This isn't us.

1810
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,750
This mcmansion and the private schools
and that ring.

1811
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:12,125
Whoa, whoa.

1812
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:13,416
The ring... the ring works.

1813
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:23,083
Come back for a goody bag?

1814
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:28,625
No, actually,
I'm here to pick up deja and dj.

1815
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:31,583
Or do you not remember me saying
I'm not leaving them here?

1816
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:34,750
Doesn't sound like I'm going to get
any argument from deja.

1817
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:37,458
- You know, she hates it here.
- Deja's a teenager, dom.

1818
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:39,458
She hates everything
that doesn't go her way.

1819
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:43,625
And I think dj made it very clear
that he does not wanna go with you.

1820
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:44,708
Well,

1821
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,916
dj doesn't know what's good for him.

1822
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:52,083
You do realize they're my children, right?

1823
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:54,875
Of course, I do, but with all due respect,
they're my family too.

1824
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:56,625
Just because we don't have the same blood

1825
01:27:56,708 --> 01:27:59,541
- or skin color doesn't mean that...
- Okay. No. Stop. Stop.

1826
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,291
Please, don't dismiss that

1827
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:07,166
like we're talking about sharing
the same birthday or taste in music,

1828
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,250
because we are not.

1829
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:11,625
We're talking about an experience that...

1830
01:28:12,958 --> 01:28:14,250
That you'll never understand.

1831
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:16,625
You do realize
that I have black children too, right?

1832
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,708
Listen, man,
just because you married a black woman

1833
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:21,208
and had babies with a black woman,
does not mean that you know

1834
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:23,833
how to handle everything
that's about to be thrown at them.

1835
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:28,125
You have no idea what dj's gonna
have to go through in a couple of years.

1836
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:30,083
I see what you put him through now.

1837
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:32,250
You can't accept the fact
he's this sweet, goofy nerd

1838
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:33,833
who wants to play dungeons & dragons.

1839
01:28:33,916 --> 01:28:36,875
Yeah! Yeah, that's how we see him.

1840
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:41,208
But, Paul, he's about to become a man

1841
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,916
who's gonna be seen as a threat
in this racist world

1842
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,208
no matter what he does.

1843
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:48,958
Do you honestly think
that I don't understand that?

1844
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:51,916
Listen, Paul. Bro…

1845
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:56,166
I went from a little, skinny kid
in the wild 100s

1846
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:59,333
on the south side of Chicago
to a three-time mvp.

1847
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:02,541
And I still get pulled over
in every city I live in.

1848
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:07,125
You can't prepare him for that.

1849
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:10,875
Because you have no idea what that's like.
How it feels.

1850
01:29:11,708 --> 01:29:13,333
How terrifying it is.

1851
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:15,875
Every time.

1852
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:23,125
You're right. You're absolutely right.
I have never experienced that,

1853
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:24,291
and I never will.

1854
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:29,291
And I respect everything you're saying.

1855
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:33,041
But one thing I do have.

1856
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:38,041
I have an incredible bond
with both of your kids,

1857
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,916
because I'm here, boots-on-the-ground.

1858
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,500
And I love them.

1859
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:45,000
And they love me.

1860
01:29:46,208 --> 01:29:48,875
And I am doing
absolutely everything I can.

1861
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:50,875
And I'm saying that's not good enough.

1862
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,500
Night, guys.

1863
01:29:58,583 --> 01:30:00,791
Before you go in,
there's something we need to tell you.

1864
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:04,041
- What'd you do? Where's my money?
- Yo, what are you talking about?

1865
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:06,083
Save the act, Seth.
We know you're a thief.

1866
01:30:06,166 --> 01:30:09,166
Harley heard the real housewives
of calabasas talking about some break-ins,

1867
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:11,166
and we knew it was you. So, busted.

1868
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:14,500
Okay, just because you don't like him,
doesn't make him guilty. It's not that...

1869
01:30:14,583 --> 01:30:16,875
No, but the fact
that he had five hundos in there does.

1870
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:19,875
And didn't you say
he bought you a $200 pair of sneakers?

1871
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:20,833
Well, yes...

1872
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:23,596
You told us you saw him stealing
from the cash register, didn't you?

1873
01:30:25,541 --> 01:30:28,208
You know, I'm so stupid.
How did I think you people cared about me?

1874
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:29,416
Seth, please, it's...

1875
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,250
- Please, I...
- I put it back, by the way.

1876
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:32,666
Not that you people care.

1877
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,583
Good job.

1878
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:37,666
Wait, haresh.

1879
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:41,000
- I'm out of here.
- What's the matter?

1880
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:42,750
I don't know what you're trying to prove,

1881
01:30:42,833 --> 01:30:44,875
but stop trying to pretend
I'm part of your family.

1882
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:45,958
I'm cool on my own.

1883
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:48,958
Seth, wait!

1884
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:51,500
Let me see what's going on.

1885
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:56,750
No, you guys, that money isn't stolen.
It's from dcfs.

1886
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:59,125
The state gives us money
to cover Seth's living expenses,

1887
01:30:59,208 --> 01:31:00,375
but we just give it to him.

1888
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:02,750
- What about the break-ins?
- It wasn't Seth.

1889
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:06,583
Someone broke into Anne's house
during the party while Seth was grounded.

1890
01:31:06,666 --> 01:31:09,500
Seth is still out there,
and we have no idea where to look for him.

1891
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,291
- I think I do.
- Yo...

1892
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:15,250
- Come on!
- Hey, let's go!

1893
01:31:15,333 --> 01:31:17,416
No, no, no. No. You guys... no.

1894
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:21,000
He doesn't need our help right...
Harley... wait just a second.

1895
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:23,875
Deja, dj, get down here right now.
We're leaving.

1896
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:26,083
No, dom. No.

1897
01:31:26,166 --> 01:31:28,416
Nobody is going anywhere.

1898
01:31:29,458 --> 01:31:30,458
Gotta go.

1899
01:31:31,916 --> 01:31:32,916
What?

1900
01:31:33,416 --> 01:31:36,541
You know... deja, dj, let's go, right now.

1901
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:38,291
Daddy!

1902
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:40,791
Hey, watch out!

1903
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:41,875
Ow!

1904
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:43,875
- Let's go!
- Hey... wait a... wait a second.

1905
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:47,083
- Wait, wait... hey, hey.
- Guys, guys, guys, please, please.

1906
01:31:47,166 --> 01:31:48,500
Dad's okay on his own.

1907
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:50,463
- What's going on?
- What's wrong? Where's Paul?

1908
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:52,083
Okay, everybody, calm down.

1909
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:55,625
He's fine. He just went down
to first and whittier to look for Seth.

1910
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:58,083
- Wait, first and whittier?
- Yeah.

1911
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:01,458
- Paul?
- Yeah?

1912
01:32:15,291 --> 01:32:16,666
Evening, sir.

1913
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:22,250
Uh, listen, I'm looking for my nephew.
Have you... have you seen this kid?

1914
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:26,083
Nope.
But I see you got that new iPhone 12.

1915
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:28,083
- Yeah. I do...
- Uncle Paul?

1916
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,625
Seth. You're okay.

1917
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,083
- How'd you find me?
- Are you kidding?

1918
01:32:34,166 --> 01:32:36,833
I've been sending you birthday cards here
for years.

1919
01:32:36,916 --> 01:32:38,642
- Come on. I'm here to take you home.
- Just go.

1920
01:32:38,666 --> 01:32:40,041
Seth!

1921
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:41,583
Seth!

1922
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:43,934
- There he is! You found him! Yes!
- Daddy! Daddy!

1923
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:46,250
- Guys, what're you... babe, I got this.
- Seth!

1924
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:47,916
- Daddy!
- All right.

1925
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,375
- Daddy!
- Hi, guys...

1926
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:53,083
Don't worry. He already had booster seats.
The bird man has four kids.

1927
01:32:54,416 --> 01:32:57,041
Yo. Who invited the Jackson 9?

1928
01:32:57,125 --> 01:32:59,916
If y'all looking for Disneyland,
you made a wrong turn.

1929
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:04,250
- Seth, thank god we found you.
- Please come home, Seth?

1930
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:06,250
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1931
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:07,458
Please.

1932
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:09,083
Ooh.

1933
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,333
This you, player?

1934
01:33:12,416 --> 01:33:15,458
- Stop it.
- Hey. Don't objectify my mommy.

1935
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:18,708
Okay. Let's... everyone... let's go.
I got this, okay? I can take it from here.

1936
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:20,666
- Moving out.
- No!

1937
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:23,041
No way. We're staying.

1938
01:33:23,125 --> 01:33:24,875
I mean, we're family, man.

1939
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:26,541
And we got your back, dude.

1940
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:27,916
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1941
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,166
- Definitely.
- Yeah, I do too, Seth.

1942
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:34,375
Uh, you know, even though I didn't really
when Harley and I accused you of stealing.

1943
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:36,833
Yeah, that was kind of harsh. My bad.

1944
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:39,750
You're the only one that knows
how to make monster spray.

1945
01:33:39,833 --> 01:33:41,375
We need refills.

1946
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:43,791
Bro, come back, dude.

1947
01:33:43,875 --> 01:33:47,416
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have
made it through these past few weeks.

1948
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:48,500
You're my bro.

1949
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:52,083
You had my back when I needed you,
and now I'm a legend.

1950
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:54,500
Og homeys for life, dude.

1951
01:33:56,041 --> 01:33:57,708
Little Indian dude's got heart.

1952
01:33:58,333 --> 01:33:59,416
And a nice chain.

1953
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,500
- I see you, player. Give me some.
- Thank you.

1954
01:34:01,583 --> 01:34:03,708
- Dude.
- Okay, look, Seth...

1955
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:07,958
Please come home, Seth.
I'll introduce you to my Teddy bears.

1956
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:11,791
Seth, I know you're upset.

1957
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:16,708
I get it. You have been passed around
so much you don't know who to trust.

1958
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:19,333
That's not fair.

1959
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:21,500
I promise you
this time's gonna be different.

1960
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:25,041
No matter what happens with your mom,
you're always gonna have a home with us.

1961
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:26,165
- Right, guys?
- Yeah, man.

1962
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:27,416
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

1963
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,166
- Yeah!
- Come down.

1964
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:30,583
Thanks, guys. I...

1965
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:33,458
I know you mean it, but let's face it.

1966
01:34:33,541 --> 01:34:35,666
I'm never gonna fit into
your fancy new life.

1967
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,208
Well, guess what.

1968
01:34:37,291 --> 01:34:40,333
We don't fit in with our fancy new life
either. Right, guys?

1969
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:41,833
- Not in the slightest!
- No!

1970
01:34:41,916 --> 01:34:43,000
- Come on.
- Come on, Seth!

1971
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:46,500
Come home, Seth.
Love like this is hard to find.

1972
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:49,503
Seth! Seth! Seth!

1973
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:51,125
Come on.

1974
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:53,375
- Come on, Seth!
- Come on, man.

1975
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:55,541
Seth! Seth! Seth!

1976
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:57,416
Seth! Seth! Seth!

1977
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,000
- Seth! Seth! Seth!
- Seth! Come home.

1978
01:34:59,083 --> 01:35:00,208
See you later, guys.

1979
01:35:03,333 --> 01:35:05,375
Let's go home.

1980
01:35:05,458 --> 01:35:06,833
- Woo-hoo!
- Yeah!

1981
01:35:08,583 --> 01:35:10,291
Seth! Seth! Seth!

1982
01:35:10,375 --> 01:35:11,583
Seth! Seth! Seth!

1983
01:35:11,666 --> 01:35:13,375
- Seth! Seth!
- Come on, man.

1984
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:14,916
Seth! Seth!

1985
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:18,541
- Seth! Seth! Seth!
- How about a group hug? Group hug!

1986
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:21,000
Yay! Woo-hoo!

1987
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:22,708
Don't crush the twins.

1988
01:35:22,791 --> 01:35:23,791
Hey!

1989
01:35:25,208 --> 01:35:28,083
Oh.
I hate when I get so emotional.

1990
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,166
All right. Hey.

1991
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:36,583
- Hey.
- Are we home?

1992
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:37,958
Yeah, baby, we're home.

1993
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:41,375
You guys go upstairs and get in bed.
I'll come tuck you in. Okay?

1994
01:35:41,458 --> 01:35:42,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

1995
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:44,708
- Thank you, dom.
- Yeah.

1996
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:46,500
Hey, guys.

1997
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:48,250
Uh…

1998
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:53,250
I overreacted, you know, about the whole
full custody thing. I don't mean that.

1999
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:57,083
You know, you and Zoey are raising
an amazing family here,

2000
01:35:57,166 --> 01:35:59,458
and I'm glad you guys are part of it.

2001
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:01,000
And you're right, Paul.

2002
01:36:01,083 --> 01:36:06,083
I missed out on a lot
of the boots-on-the-ground stuff.

2003
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:08,958
You know, teaching this guy
to brush his teeth, ride a bike...

2004
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:10,916
Do not regret the teeth stuff.

2005
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,083
I'm telling you,
a four-year-old's morning breath...

2006
01:36:13,166 --> 01:36:15,333
It's like a tiny dragon melting your face.

2007
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:18,333
Still, man,

2008
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:21,208
you got all that,

2009
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:23,625
and I didn't.

2010
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:25,728
- So, wait, you're jealous of me?
- No.

2011
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:28,311
- No, that... of course not. No.
- That wouldn't make any sense.

2012
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:30,333
And dj, you're right, buddy.

2013
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:32,750
I don't know anything
about what you're into.

2014
01:36:32,833 --> 01:36:35,125
- Yeah.
- But I really want to.

2015
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:37,875
- Really?
- Yeah.

2016
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:42,000
Yeah, I tell you what. How about
you and me go to comic-con this year?

2017
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:43,763
You know, make some noise.
What do you say?

2018
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:46,416
What? Yeah. Heck yeah.

2019
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,625
Yo, you wanna cosplay?

2020
01:36:49,416 --> 01:36:51,791
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Whatever you want.

2021
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:54,875
Yes! I'ma bring my comics.
We have so many choices.

2022
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:57,375
Cool. All right, man.

2023
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:00,291
What did I just get myself into here?

2024
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:05,166
You, my friend, just got yourself into
a pair of 4xl tights and a cape.

2025
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:07,250
That's gonna be great.

2026
01:37:15,125 --> 01:37:16,208
Thank you for asking that.

2027
01:37:16,291 --> 01:37:18,125
That is a great question, Bethany.
Thank you.

2028
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:20,434
- Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.
- I tried. I couldn't stop him.

2029
01:37:20,458 --> 01:37:22,791
Paul, what's up?
We aren't scheduled to sign the paperwork

2030
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:24,976
- until next week.
- Yeah, that's no longer happening.

2031
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,791
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about lunch, Melanie.

2032
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:30,791
That ridiculous little meal
between breakfast and dinner,

2033
01:37:30,875 --> 01:37:33,083
which, fyi, I am also not doing.

2034
01:37:33,166 --> 01:37:35,041
Paul, I think you're overreacting.

2035
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:38,000
Am I? Because let me tell you
a little something about me.

2036
01:37:38,083 --> 01:37:40,708
I love breakfast.

2037
01:37:40,791 --> 01:37:43,416
Breakfast is my jam.

2038
01:37:44,541 --> 01:37:47,208
Jam is also my jam.
There're some wonderful jams.

2039
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:50,041
I love marmalades, um, jellies.

2040
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:53,125
Quince paste is delightful sometimes
on a cheese board.

2041
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:55,333
I digress. I don't want any of it.

2042
01:37:55,416 --> 01:37:58,833
I want my name back, I want my brand back,
and I want all the rights to my sauce.

2043
01:37:58,916 --> 01:38:00,541
I've sold enough to buy it all back.

2044
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:03,708
Paul, if you walk away from this
over a lunch menu,

2045
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:05,250
you're making a huge mistake.

2046
01:38:05,333 --> 01:38:06,583
- Huge mistake.
- I know.

2047
01:38:06,666 --> 01:38:09,458
"Millions of dollars and becoming
a household name" and all that.

2048
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:12,666
Well, guess what. Chef boyardee was
a rock star, but that's not me.

2049
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:15,875
I would rather be broke and at home,
making omelets for my kids

2050
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:18,875
than being a corporate sellout,
making soup for you two.

2051
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:21,375
Chef boyardee was a real person?

2052
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:24,375
You're not gonna, like, sue me for this,
are you? Please don't.

2053
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:27,166
'Cause I don't...
I have so many children, and they're...

2054
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:28,833
They're so expensive.

2055
01:38:28,916 --> 01:38:29,916
She knows.

2056
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:34,416
Cool if I come by tomorrow
to help you unpack?

2057
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,500
I don't know.

2058
01:38:36,583 --> 01:38:38,625
Calabasas to echo park is no joke.

2059
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:41,791
You sure you're up
for a long-distance relationship?

2060
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:44,583
- You think I'm scared of a little traffic?
- You should be.

2061
01:38:45,291 --> 01:38:47,250
I am. But you're worth it.

2062
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:49,708
You're so corny.

2063
01:38:49,791 --> 01:38:51,750
Aw.

2064
01:38:51,833 --> 01:38:54,541
Okay, now you have to promise
that you're still gonna come around

2065
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:56,000
- for our mommy playdates.
- Yeah.

2066
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:58,208
Are you kidding me? Of course.

2067
01:38:58,291 --> 01:38:59,416
Wait, is, uh…

2068
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,041
Is Anne gonna be there?

2069
01:39:01,125 --> 01:39:02,416
Oh, no.

2070
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:04,583
She moved to Idaho for the diversity.

2071
01:39:05,708 --> 01:39:06,708
That tracks.

2072
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:09,666
- Hey, Paul.
- Yeah?

2073
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:14,166
I'm glad we're leaving, but I'm sorry
for being such a jerk to you about it.

2074
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:15,833
You weren't being a jerk.

2075
01:39:16,958 --> 01:39:18,625
I appreciate everything you said.

2076
01:39:19,375 --> 01:39:23,583
You know, sometimes one of the most
loving things you can do for someone

2077
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:26,833
is tell them a hard truth
that they really need to hear.

2078
01:39:26,916 --> 01:39:28,166
You suck at basketball.

2079
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:33,958
Why would you lie

2080
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:37,125
when I just gave you a lecture
about the truth?

2081
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:41,708
So we moved out of calabasas
and back to vibrant la.

2082
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,958
The kids went back to their old schools.

2083
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:45,809
- Deja rejoined her old team…
- come on, deja!

2084
01:39:45,833 --> 01:39:47,458
…and got her scholarship to usc.

2085
01:39:48,958 --> 01:39:50,718
- Come on!
- She's so good.

2086
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:54,666
Kate got a great guy
with four kids and nine birds.

2087
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:58,708
And dom got a cool new girlfriend
with two dogs and very healthy boundaries.

2088
01:39:58,791 --> 01:40:00,041
That's a little tight.

2089
01:40:03,625 --> 01:40:05,000
My house, baby.

2090
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:06,291
What?

2091
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:10,333
And we found the perfect home
for our perfectly imperfect family.

2092
01:40:10,416 --> 01:40:13,083
Wait, you guys, before we go in,
let's all take a selfie.

2093
01:40:13,166 --> 01:40:14,250
Here we go.

2094
01:40:20,375 --> 01:40:21,708
All right, baby, try this.

2095
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:25,375
Mmm.

2096
01:40:25,875 --> 01:40:28,583
- Yum. What is that?
- Right? It's my latest invention.

2097
01:40:28,666 --> 01:40:30,541
It's a croissant soufflé.

2098
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:33,541
I'm gonna call it a "croissant souff-hey."

2099
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:34,958
Dad, stop.

2100
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:36,916
- Guys, that's so bad.
- All right, everybody.

2101
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,750
Well, since you're all such critics,
what do you think of this?

2102
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:41,226
- This is amazing.
- What is that?

2103
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:43,458
- With a new label.
- It's us.

2104
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:45,875
- Sit down.
- When did you get the time?

2105
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:47,666
It's us. We look so cute.

2106
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,708
- I'm on here?
- Of course you are.

2107
01:40:49,791 --> 01:40:51,559
- You're part of the family.
- That's so cool.

2108
01:40:51,583 --> 01:40:52,750
Dude, this is dope.

2109
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:54,000
There's two of me.

2110
01:40:54,083 --> 01:40:56,375
- One of them is me.
- There's two of us?

2111
01:40:58,125 --> 01:41:02,000
All right,
who wants some more croissant souff-hey?

2112
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:06,458
- Right? That's what it is.
- Now you guys like it?

2113
01:41:06,541 --> 01:41:09,833
So I didn't get my franchise,
but I got something better.

2114
01:41:09,916 --> 01:41:11,166
I got my family

2115
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:14,708
and a life that's the perfect size
for all of our dreams.

2116
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:19,791
And at the end of the day,
there is no sweeter dream than that.
