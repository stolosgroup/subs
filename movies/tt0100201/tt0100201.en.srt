00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:56,333
Don't-Don't.
Damn.

3
00:00:58,237 --> 00:01:01,502
<i>Destiny's a pretty big concept
when you think about it.</i>

4
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:06,375
<i>Where you are in life,
how you got there...</i>

5
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:09,107
<i>what would have happened
if one thing or another
had been different.</i>

6
00:01:11,384 --> 00:01:13,682
<i>To be honest...</i>

7
00:01:13,753 --> 00:01:16,278
<i>I never gave it
much thought, myself...</i>

8
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:19,381
<i>until today, June 14th...</i>

9
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,790
<i>my 35th birthday...</i>

10
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:25,888
<i>and without a doubt,
the strangest day of my life.</i>

11
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:35,196
<i>Do you remember
the old story that starts...</i>

12
00:01:35,274 --> 00:01:37,834
<i>this guy goes into a bar?</i>

13
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,438
<i>Well, I'm the guy,
and here's the story.</i>

14
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:45,780
<i>But wait a minute.
I'm getting way ahead of myself.</i>

15
00:01:47,887 --> 00:01:50,378
<i>To tell this story right...</i>

16
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:53,550
<i>I should start
where it really begins...</i>

17
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:56,686
<i>20 years ago today,
as a matter of fact.</i>

18
00:01:56,762 --> 00:02:00,858
<i>June 14th, 1970,
my 15th birthday...</i>

19
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:04,528
<i>and also a very strange day.</i>

20
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:09,668
<i>It was the all-state
high school championship game...</i>

21
00:02:09,742 --> 00:02:12,711
<i>bottom of the 9th, 2 outs.</i>

22
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:16,270
<i>Our school hadn't made it
to the finals in 25 years...</i>

23
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:19,044
<i>so out of a town
of 30,000 people...</i>

24
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:22,087
<i>38,000 showed up for the game.</i>

25
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:24,622
<i>Fillmore High
had us by a run...</i>

26
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,284
<i>and it was
a 3-2 count.</i>

27
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:29,520
<i>Fenwick was standing on 3rd...</i>

28
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:32,564
<i>like the bag was getting ready
to explode under his feet.</i>

29
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:35,395
<i>The championship had
come down to one batter...</i>

30
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:37,902
<i>Yeah, you guessed it...</i>

31
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,962
<i>yours truly, Larry Burrows.</i>

32
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:44,507
<i>Haskins was
throwing fastballs...</i>

33
00:02:44,577 --> 00:02:47,978
<i>because that was
the only pitch he ever threw.</i>

34
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:50,242
<i>So I was ready
for the next one.</i>

35
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:52,750
Paste it, Lar!
You can do it.

36
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:54,410
Have an eye!

37
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,887
Swing, babe, it's all yours!

38
00:02:56,956 --> 00:03:00,448
<i>Then something weird happened.</i>

39
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:03,290
<i>Don't ask me what it was...</i>

40
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:06,388
<i>'cause it only happened
for a split second.</i>

41
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:11,164
<i>But that was enough
to change my life forever.</i>

42
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:20,111
Strike 3!

43
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:23,012
<i>Why is it when you do
something terrific...</i>

44
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:25,346
<i>9 times out of 10
you're alone...</i>

45
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:28,113
<i>but when you
screw up really big...</i>

46
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:30,587
<i>the whole world is watching?</i>

47
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:35,860
<i>I wanted to crawl under
home plate and never come out.</i>

48
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:37,555
<i>As usual...</i>

49
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,963
<i>my best friend, Clip Metzler,
tried to cheer me up.</i>

50
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:43,558
<i>Clip's very big
on novelty gags.</i>

51
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:45,627
Aren't they cool?

52
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:48,366
I scared the crap
out of my baby sister.

53
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,499
Want to try them on?

54
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:52,510
Thanks, Clipper...

55
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:54,910
but I'd kinda like to be alone.

56
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,813
Sure, Lar.
Whatever you say.

57
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:03,554
I'll call you later.
We'll see a movie.

58
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:06,455
<i>We could see
Bonnie and Clyde again.</i>

59
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:09,187
<i>- What do you say?
- Sure, Clip.</i>

60
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:11,195
Great!

61
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:13,288
I'll see you later then.

62
00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:20,296
<i>It was the worst
moment of my life.</i>

63
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:24,872
<i>God, I felt bad.</i>

64
00:04:39,892 --> 00:04:42,793
<i>Looks like you could
use one of these.</i>

65
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:46,160
Yeah, I must've gotten
some dust in my eyes.

66
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:49,064
There was a lot
of dust out there.

67
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:52,126
- Thanks.
- You can keep it.

68
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:55,469
<i>My aunt sends me
2 dozen every Christmas.</i>

69
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,237
<i>What's E.J.R. Stand for?</i>

70
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,440
Ellen Jane Ripley.
What's your name?

71
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:05,540
Larry Joseph Burrows.

72
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:08,519
Nice to meet you, Larry.

73
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:11,579
<i>I thought that
was really sweet...</i>

74
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:15,593
<i>her not saying anything about
me crying like a big baby.</i>

75
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:17,026
<i>Really sweet.</i>

76
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:19,929
<i>- Larry?
- So I married her.</i>

77
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,127
I've been calling you
for the last 5 minutes.

78
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:26,569
<i>Not right then, of course,
but several years later.</i>

79
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,073
Honey, were you
thinking about...

80
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,575
that silly baseball game again?

81
00:05:31,644 --> 00:05:34,875
No, no, not at all.

82
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:38,178
I was working on
my '55 Porsche Spider.

83
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,810
<i>I was, really.</i>

84
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:42,820
Ain't it a beaut?

85
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:45,448
James Dean used
to drive one of these...

86
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:47,719
only his was much bigger.

87
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:50,125
<i>Ellen and I have
a pretty regular life.</i>

88
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:52,561
<i>We have a 2-bedroom
house in the suburbs...</i>

89
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:54,622
<i>that isn't quite finished...</i>

90
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,192
<i>and a contractor named Guzelman
who doesn't want to quite finish it.</i>

91
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,969
Hey, Mr. Guzelman,
how are you?

92
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:06,239
I haven't seen you
in the past 6 weeks.

93
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:09,872
I thought you were
captured by some aliens.

94
00:06:09,948 --> 00:06:12,883
I got your message.
Problem with something?

95
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:16,512
Uh, yeah, it's the driveway.

96
00:06:16,588 --> 00:06:17,953
What's wrong?

97
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:21,083
Well, do you think
maybe we can pave it?

98
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,324
Well, you can't pave
until the mud is all gone.

99
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:30,360
Then we just have to get
rid of the mud, right?

100
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:32,529
I don't do mud.

101
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:35,004
You need a mud guy for that.

102
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:37,065
- "A mud guy"?
- Yes.

103
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:40,339
- They have that?
- A mud guy, yes.

104
00:06:40,412 --> 00:06:43,472
- Anything else?
- Now that you mention it...

105
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:46,143
it would be nice
to have a front lawn.

106
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:48,152
I need a check for that.

107
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,348
- How much?
- $1,000.

108
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:55,018
- Don't you know another number?
- $2,000.

109
00:06:56,762 --> 00:06:59,458
<i>We have a dog named Sammy.</i>

110
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:02,932
<i>I found him in an alley,
so I brought him home.</i>

111
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:05,469
Sammy peed on the rug again.

112
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:07,903
Way to go, Sammy.

113
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:11,773
<i>He has a nervous bladder,
but a good heart.</i>

114
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:14,813
We're out of Wheaties.
Do we have another box?

115
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,509
No, I forgot
to buy any. Sorry.

116
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:21,747
I've had Wheaties for breakfast
every morning of my life...

117
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,981
since I was 6 years old.

118
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:27,457
Is it too much to ask that
we keep an extra box on hand...

119
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:30,120
<i>in the event of
a crisis like this?</i>

120
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:32,755
You gave Guzelman
another check.

121
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:36,528
I did not give Guzelman
another check!

122
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:40,333
You're pissed off,
so you're taking it out on me.

123
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:44,535
Okay, okay, so I gave
Guzelman another check.

124
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,512
<i>Don't you hate it when
somebody knows you that well?</i>

125
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,743
<i>You can't get
away with anything.</i>

126
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:55,651
<i>But I guess that's
just part of marriage.</i>

127
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:58,246
<i>So's the occasional argument.</i>

128
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:02,123
<i>They're tearing down
“The Golf of Mexico. “</i>

129
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:06,358
- That's where we went
on our 1 st date.
- That was our 2nd date.

130
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:08,626
It was our 1 st date.

131
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,158
You tripped over
the grinning bandito
and split your pants.

132
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:14,637
Our 1 st date
was at Mr. Pizza.

133
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:17,903
You ate anchovies
and belched all night.

134
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:22,811
That was our 3rd date,
and I just burped a few times.

135
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:26,112
<i>But we never argue
about anything important...</i>

136
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:28,983
<i>and we always make up.</i>

137
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:32,114
Okay, okay, okay.

138
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:34,751
All right, see you after work.

139
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:36,317
I forgot.

140
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:39,694
<i>I'm gonna be late tonight.
There's a union meeting.</i>

141
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:41,995
Another one?
What for?

142
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:44,865
They want me to be chairman
of the strike committee.

143
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:47,906
Somebody has to stop
these management creeps...

144
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:50,601
from laying everybody off.

145
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:52,701
But it's my birthday.

146
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:55,645
What'd you say?

147
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:58,114
Never mind.
Forget it.

148
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:02,518
She forgot.

149
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:06,147
I need some coffee.

150
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,319
<i>Nothing had happened
to make me think...</i>

151
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:12,420
<i>that this was going to be...</i>

152
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:15,466
<i>anything more than just another
routine day at the office.</i>

153
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:17,968
<i>As usual,
by the time I arrived...</i>

154
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:20,937
<i>there was no coffee left...</i>

155
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:24,932
<i>and no water.</i>

156
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,069
Great.

157
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:35,918
<i>So I did the only thing
I could think of.</i>

158
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:42,118
I've gotta have my coffee.

159
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:46,460
<i>Why is it when you have
a mouthful of freeze-dried,
your boss walks in on you?</i>

160
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:48,522
How they hanging?

161
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,694
<i>- I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?
- No, Mr. Bumpers.</i>

162
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,761
I'm having my coffee.

163
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,966
<i>Lay off the
“Mr. Bumpers”crap.</i>

164
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,236
How many times
do I gotta tell you?

165
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,437
We're both on the same team.

166
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:04,243
<i>Jackie's a sweet guy, but kinda
dumb for a company president.</i>

167
00:10:04,316 --> 00:10:07,114
In football, they
called me "Cement head,"

168
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:09,415
<i>but you can call me Jackie.</i>

169
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:11,513
Yes, sir, Jackie.

170
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,922
I was going over
the quarterly reports.

171
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:16,119
Damn fine work.
A real touchdown.

172
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:19,595
<i>- Just doing my job.
- Don't think I don't appreciate it.</i>

173
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:23,726
A quarterback's only as good
as his linemen, right?

174
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:25,497
Yep.

175
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,370
<i>I'm just a big,
dumb jock who got lucky
and married the boss' daughter.</i>

176
00:10:35,347 --> 00:10:38,748
It's guys like you that
make me look like a hotshot.

177
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:41,217
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

178
00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:43,413
Well, Lar...

179
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:46,286
just keep up
the good work, huh?

180
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:49,691
I just came by to see
how you were doing.

181
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:55,026
Now, that's funny.

182
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:59,770
<i>Toilet paper in the nose.</i>

183
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:02,671
Why didn't I think of that?

184
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:05,369
I'm trying to get a promotion!

185
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:08,811
Will you relax?
Your suck points are safe.

186
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,316
Believe me, Cement head
didn't notice a thing.

187
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:15,319
Oh, Clip, you kill me.

188
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:18,481
Happy 35th, buddy.

189
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:20,491
Thanks, Clip.

190
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,790
I honestly didn't think
anybody remembered.

191
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:26,729
<i>This is great.
Wow!</i>

192
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:29,631
<i>- Artificial puke.
- That's the stuff
we used to throw...</i>

193
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:31,669
into the girls' locker room...

194
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:34,706
so they'd get scared and
run out in their underwear.

195
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:37,970
This is the actual stuff?
Mr. Green confiscated this.

196
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:39,738
He did...

197
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,803
next day, I broke in
and confiscated it back.

198
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:46,146
<i>- We had fun in those days.
- We sure did.</i>

199
00:11:46,218 --> 00:11:50,120
Well, where's my
"thank you" kiss?

200
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:52,122
<i>No, Clip.</i>

201
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,385
- No kiss.
- Just one.

202
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:57,428
We're in the office.
Stop it!

203
00:11:57,496 --> 00:12:01,626
<i>Why is it when your best friend's
kissing you on the head...</i>

204
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,158
<i>a beautiful woman
comes along and catches you?</i>

205
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:09,469
Hi, CindyJo.
How are you?

206
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:13,443
What a coincidence.
Jackie was just here.

207
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:15,446
<i>You know, your husband.</i>

208
00:12:15,514 --> 00:12:17,846
How've you been?
We've been fine.

209
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,884
Clip and I are pretty good.

210
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:22,078
Work, work, that's all we do.

211
00:12:22,154 --> 00:12:24,088
How've you been?

212
00:12:24,156 --> 00:12:26,386
I've been fine.

213
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,518
Thank you for
asking... 3 times.

214
00:12:29,594 --> 00:12:31,528
Uh, well...

215
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:34,463
I just wanted to make
absolutely sure.

216
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,626
<i>CindyJo's father
owns the company.</i>

217
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,669
<i>She's married to Jackie.</i>

218
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:41,831
<i>That's how a guy
named “Cement Head”
gets to be president.</i>

219
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:44,102
Did Jackie go to his office?

220
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:46,906
Yeah.

221
00:12:46,978 --> 00:12:50,072
Yeah, I'm sure he did.
He had lots of work to do.

222
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:52,776
Touchdowns and all that stuff.

223
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:54,944
It was nice seeing you again.

224
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,682
<i>Bye, Clip.</i>

225
00:13:01,226 --> 00:13:03,820
<i>Nice seeing you, too, Cindy.</i>

226
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:06,591
<i>Maybe it was because
it was my birthday,</i>

227
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:10,032
<i>maybe it was seeing CindyJo,
I don't know,</i>

228
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:14,505
<i>but I'd been thinking about
what it would have been like...</i>

229
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:17,098
<i>if my life had
turned out differently.</i>

230
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:20,075
Do you ever have
any regrets, Clip?

231
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:23,205
About how your life
has turned out...

232
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:26,375
or about choices you made?

233
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:28,544
No!

234
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,680
- Oh... no.
- Oh.

235
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:34,884
But I figure I didn't make
all that many choices.

236
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,191
You know what my policy is?
Do nothing and see what happens...

237
00:13:38,263 --> 00:13:42,290
- and things always seem
to turn out fine.
- Yeah, for you.

238
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:45,632
Your problem is that nothing's
ever good enough for you.

239
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:48,502
<i>You've got the perfect life.</i>

240
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:52,373
You've got a wonderful home,
a terrific wife, a good job...

241
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:55,436
and the best friend
money can buy.

242
00:13:55,514 --> 00:13:57,948
What else could a guy want?

243
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:01,213
A little excitement
would be nice.

244
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,686
I am so mad, I could scream.

245
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:06,588
Maddie and heather
were both laid off...

246
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:09,718
due to slow sales
or some bullshit like that.

247
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:13,230
They are laying people off,
making us work double shifts...

248
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:16,631
<i>- to keep production levels up.
- She's got a point.</i>

249
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:19,829
I did an inventory check,
and there's a surplus.

250
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:23,705
Technically, we should be
cutting back on production.

251
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,005
Can you check into it, Larry?

252
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:29,069
The next person
to be laid off could be me.

253
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:31,945
<i>Looking back,
I should have said no...</i>

254
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:33,985
<i>but I didn't.</i>

255
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:36,247
I'll look into it.

256
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:38,186
<i>Because I'm an idiot.</i>

257
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:40,656
<i>Honey, come on.</i>

258
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:43,421
What?
She always kisses me.

259
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:45,759
I'm eating.

260
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,799
<i>When the head of my
department, Niles Pender...</i>

261
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:51,335
<i>announced he was
raising production levels...</i>

262
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:54,429
<i>I couldn't keep
my big idiot mouth shut.</i>

263
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:56,440
Ahem.

264
00:14:56,508 --> 00:15:00,604
A comment, Burrows,
or phlegm rising in your throat?

265
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:04,274
Um, well...

266
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:06,817
just a thought here, Niles.

267
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,978
<i>Why do we need more product...</i>

268
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:11,420
when we have
a surplus inventory?

269
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:14,356
On what are you basing
this so-called surplus?

270
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:16,951
On the fact that...

271
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:24,661
that I recently counted
every box in the warehouse.

272
00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:28,365
I would say we have a problem
with our perception of reality.

273
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,704
Sorry to barge in.

274
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:33,608
Do Jackie and I
need to be here?

275
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:37,671
Not at all, Mr. Hansen.
Just production details.

276
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:41,515
<i>Leo Hansen owns the company.
He's a very sweet man...</i>

277
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:43,986
<i>but he doesn't have a clue
about what's going on.</i>

278
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:46,387
Then it's off
to the golf course.

279
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,256
Jackie's gonna show me
how to get rid of my slice.

280
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:51,522
I speak for all
of us when I say...

281
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:53,757
that is wonderful news.

282
00:15:53,832 --> 00:15:57,563
What time is that meeting
with Mr. Nakamura?

283
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:59,194
8:00, sir.

284
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:02,729
But we have a dinner
reservation at 9:00.

285
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:05,970
We have some important
business to finalize, sir.

286
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:07,978
Well...

287
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:11,038
Well, maybe I'd better
cancel the reservation.

288
00:16:11,116 --> 00:16:13,050
That's an excellent idea.

289
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:16,952
That's what I'll do, then.
Good-bye, y'all.

290
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:21,191
Touchdowns, everyone.

291
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:26,194
Incredible.

292
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:29,961
<i>Since we seem to have
a disagreement over the inventory...</i>

293
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:32,094
I suggest you check it again.

294
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,539
Well, that would take
about 3 or 4 days.

295
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:38,735
<i>I don't see a problem.</i>

296
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,335
Do you see a problem with that?

297
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:43,404
<i>Well...</i>

298
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:46,917
do you, Burrows?

299
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:51,647
No, sir.

300
00:16:51,723 --> 00:16:55,386
I should have told Niles
about the surplus myself...

301
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,362
but the guy scares
the shit out of me.

302
00:16:59,431 --> 00:17:02,298
Don't worry.
He's an asshole.

303
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,733
I'll make it up to you somehow.

304
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:08,500
<i>Guess what's playing with
In the Heat of the Night.</i>

305
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:11,440
<i>- What?
- Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

306
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:14,000
We haven't seen it
in about 20 years.

307
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,879
<i>- Do you want to go?
- Of course I want to go.</i>

308
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:21,510
Great. I'll see
you later then.

309
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:23,577
<i>All right, Clip.</i>

310
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:25,885
Oh, and Larry?

311
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,152
<i>You shouldn't be talking to me.</i>

312
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:31,389
<i>After all, you've got
a lot of boxes to count.</i>

313
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:35,058
- Thanks for reminding me.
- Heh-heh-heh.

314
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:38,694
Get outta here.
What a jerk.

315
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:43,399
Excuse me. Would you
mind stepping back?

316
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:46,569
You wouldn't want me to
fork you to death, would you?

317
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,813
No.

318
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:52,873
No, we couldn't have that.

319
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:58,352
After all, we hardly
know each other.

320
00:17:58,423 --> 00:18:01,051
Since when does that matter?

321
00:18:04,863 --> 00:18:08,060
All right, you,
get back to work.

322
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:10,101
I know what you're thinking.

323
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:12,466
Sometimes, I get the feeling...

324
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:14,971
<i>I'm missing out on something.</i>

325
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,203
<i>What she's got, you don't need.</i>

326
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:22,236
You sure?

327
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:25,773
Not absolutely...

328
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,114
but if I tried to find out...

329
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:30,416
your mother would kill me.

330
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:33,116
You're the dad
every kid dreams of.

331
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:35,557
Don't be such a wise guy.

332
00:18:35,627 --> 00:18:38,027
Petey Fleckman just got canned.

333
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:40,428
That's 3 guys since yesterday.

334
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:43,194
Something stinks,
and I don't mean...

335
00:18:43,268 --> 00:18:45,702
the meat loaf in the cafeteria.

336
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,863
Yeah, I know.

337
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:50,430
Hey, hey, look at this.

338
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:53,944
<i>That's the same bunch
he had down here last week.</i>

339
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:56,810
<i>- Who are they?
- Who knows?</i>

340
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:59,475
Niles is trying
to pass them off...

341
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:02,486
as some championship
baseball team from Osaka.

342
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:06,923
<i>One of them thinks
Mickey Mantle is something
over a mouse's fireplace.</i>

343
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,084
You're in management.

344
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,129
- Check around a little, will ya?
- Yeah.

345
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:15,724
- I'll see what I can find out.
- You're aces, kid.

346
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,403
<i>Looking back, I should
have said no to Dad...</i>

347
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:24,567
<i>but I didn't.</i>

348
00:19:24,642 --> 00:19:27,839
<i>I was beginning to think that
maybe something was going on.</i>

349
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,518
<i>I decided to look
around Niles' office...</i>

350
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:37,384
<i>to see if I could
find anything.</i>

351
00:19:37,455 --> 00:19:40,481
<i>I'd been an idiot
all morning, anyway...</i>

352
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,220
<i>so I figured, why stop now?</i>

353
00:20:17,262 --> 00:20:19,196
Shit.

354
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:35,369
<i>“Leveraged buy out

355
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:38,313
What the hell's Metasport?

356
00:20:42,554 --> 00:20:44,488
Shit.

357
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:50,054
<i>Why is it, every time you
break into your boss' office...</i>

358
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:52,961
<i>he always walks in on you?</i>

359
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,926
Lose something, Burrows?

360
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:02,199
Something tells me I have.

361
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:10,373
<i>Well, that brings me
back to where I began...</i>

362
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:13,611
<i>In the middle of nowhere
with a car that won't start.</i>

363
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:16,119
<i>All things considered...</i>

364
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:19,122
<i>it had turned into
a pretty rotten birthday.</i>

365
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:27,790
<i>But nothing

366
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:31,323
<i>could have prepared me
for what came next.</i>

367
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,384
Evening.

368
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:49,181
Hi.

369
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:51,517
You got a pay phone?

370
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:53,716
Right there.

371
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,725
Thanks.

372
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:11,875
Yeah, hi.
It's me again.

373
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:13,934
I'm gonna need another tow.

374
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:16,845
<i>I'm on the corner
of Cross and 3rd...</i>

375
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:19,041
<i>next to a bar.</i>

376
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:21,517
Yeah, the station wagon...

377
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:25,147
the big blue piece of shit.

378
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:27,555
I'll get a new car.

379
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,559
All right.

380
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:32,596
"Get a new car."
I've gotta get a new life.

381
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:35,292
Car trouble, huh?

382
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:37,300
Yeah.

383
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:39,836
Tow truck will
be here in 20 minutes.

384
00:22:39,904 --> 00:22:42,737
- Can I get you something?
- I could sure use it.

385
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:45,571
Light beer, no glass, right?

386
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:47,941
Yeah.
How did you know?

387
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:50,606
Just a guess.

388
00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:57,914
Say, don't I know
you from somewhere?

389
00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:00,355
You seem familiar to me, too.

390
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:02,017
Name's Mike.

391
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:05,128
Larry.

392
00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:08,495
Larry Burrows, right?
You're the kid...

393
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:12,093
<i>who lost the high school
championship in 1970.</i>

Jesus heavenly Christ.

395
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,370
If I'd known
it was a sore point...

396
00:23:18,443 --> 00:23:20,877
I wouldn't have brought it up.

397
00:23:23,514 --> 00:23:27,143
Forget it.
I'm getting used to it.

398
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:29,982
This whole day's
been a nightmare.

399
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:34,286
<i>- Care to talk about it?
- It's lots of things.</i>

400
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:37,691
I didn't have my
cereal this morning.

401
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:41,027
<i>Didn't have my coffee at work.</i>

402
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:44,193
I got fired.

403
00:23:44,268 --> 00:23:48,034
It's my 35th birthday,
and everyone forgot.

404
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:51,166
Almost everyone.
I got vomit from Clip.

405
00:23:51,242 --> 00:23:52,834
<i>Well...</i>

406
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,141
<i>- happy birthday.
- Thanks, Mike.</i>

407
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:59,012
35 years old,
and my life is shit.

408
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,948
It can't be that bad.

409
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:03,384
It's not that it's bad...

410
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:06,014
it's just that it's ordinary.

411
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,287
I do the same thing every day.

412
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,693
Go to work, come home;

413
00:24:12,764 --> 00:24:15,699
build some model cars
or go bowling;

414
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:18,361
fall asleep in front of the TV.

415
00:24:20,338 --> 00:24:24,035
If I'd have just hit
that goddamn ball...

416
00:24:24,108 --> 00:24:27,077
my life would have
turned out a lot better.

417
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:29,875
Some people believe that...

418
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:33,178
things are the way
they are for a reason.

419
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:35,310
The reason eludes me.

420
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:40,052
Can I have another one?

421
00:24:40,124 --> 00:24:42,058
Listen...

422
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:45,493
I've got just the thing
for a sober cynic...

423
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:48,327
<i>like yourself.</i>

424
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:51,994
<i>It's a little something

425
00:24:54,238 --> 00:24:56,604

426
00:24:58,075 --> 00:25:00,839

427
00:25:07,718 --> 00:25:11,176
It's the one drink

428
00:25:11,255 --> 00:25:14,190
Very clever, Mike.

429
00:25:14,258 --> 00:25:17,284
It does the job.
Try it.

430
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,134
So you think your life
would have been better...

431
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:31,198
if you'd hit the ball, huh?

432
00:25:31,275 --> 00:25:34,301
Yeah...

433
00:25:34,378 --> 00:25:37,108
a lot better.

434
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:39,741
I swung too late, that's all.

435
00:25:42,153 --> 00:25:44,178
Yeah.

436
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:52,123
If I'd just started
a half-a-second sooner.

437
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,058
I did it, I did it!

438
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:31,693
Yeah!

439
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:43,278
Half-a-second sooner,
and I would have been king.

440
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:48,216
A lousy
half-a-second.

441
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:58,551
I think I'll go outside
and wait for the tow truck.

442
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:01,462
Thanks for the
sympathetic ear, Mike.

443
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:05,593
Anytime, Larry.
That's what I'm here for.

444
00:27:13,077 --> 00:27:15,068
Oh, great.

445
00:27:15,146 --> 00:27:18,513
They towed my car already.

446
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:22,074
You'd think they could've
at least come in and told me.

447
00:27:24,622 --> 00:27:27,785
Is he closed already?

448
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:30,725
Ah, damn.
Hey, Mike!

449
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:33,593
Mike, I need to call a cab!

450
00:27:51,515 --> 00:27:53,915
It's paved.

451
00:27:55,386 --> 00:27:57,445
What do you know?

452
00:27:57,521 --> 00:28:00,319
Old Guzelman
came through after all.

453
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:02,757
Must've found a mud guy.

454
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,324
Hey, Ellen?

455
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,631
Let me in, will ya?
I gotta use the can.

456
00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:17,568
Come on, honey.
My key won't work.

457
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,102
What the hell are ya doin'
banging on my door?

458
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:24,977
Who are you?
What's going on here?

459
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:27,381
What have you done
with my wife?

460
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:30,215
What are you talking about?

461
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:33,552
Look, take whatever
you need and leave.

462
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:36,684
If you don't hurt anybody,
I won't call the cops.

Cops?
Man, I am a cop.

464
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:43,061
Just what's your problem?

465
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:46,126
I don't have a problem.

Your house?
Show me some I.D., pal.

468
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:54,577
Yeah, okay.

469
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,806
You're gonna feel like a fool.

470
00:28:56,881 --> 00:28:59,111
I've lived here
for over a year.

471
00:28:59,183 --> 00:29:01,651
"Lawrence J. Burrows...

472
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:04,119
<i>“11653 Bonny Meadow Lane...</i>

473
00:29:04,188 --> 00:29:06,349
<i>Forest Hills. “</i>

474
00:29:06,424 --> 00:29:08,585
Where'd I get this license?

475
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,526
Probably from the D.M.V.
Where everybody gets theirs.

476
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:14,428
This is my house
and I want to see my wife.

477
00:29:14,498 --> 00:29:16,762
Now step outta my way.

478
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:20,065
Try to come in
and I'll kick your ass.

479
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:24,198
I don't care.
I'm coming in.

480
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:27,540
- No, you're not!
- Yes, I am!

481
00:29:27,611 --> 00:29:29,636
<i>- You're not!
- I am!</i>

482
00:29:29,713 --> 00:29:31,146
Larry?

483
00:29:31,215 --> 00:29:33,740
Mike!

484
00:29:33,818 --> 00:29:36,787
<i>- What are you doing here?
- We need to talk.</i>

485
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:39,186
I gotta get in my house.

486
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:42,191
<i>That's one of the things
we need to talk about.</i>

487
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:44,284
You don't live there.

488
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:46,295
What?

489
00:29:46,363 --> 00:29:49,264
Even the cab driver
knows you don't live here.

490
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,392
Now beat it!

491
00:29:55,739 --> 00:29:58,572
It's all very simple, really.

492
00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:00,803
You know that
little incident...

493
00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:02,971
you didn't like
about your life?

494
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:04,708
The baseball game?

495
00:30:04,782 --> 00:30:07,580
<i>- It's been changed.
- Changed?</i>

496
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:09,744
What do you mean?

497
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,913
You hit
the 3-2 pitch...

498
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:13,957
<i>out of the park.</i>

499
00:30:14,024 --> 00:30:16,652
That's why I don't
live in my house?

500
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:19,662
Exactly.
When that moment changed...

501
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,790
everything else
in your life changed.

502
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:26,325
Ha, ha!
I get it.

503
00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:28,803
I get it now.

504
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:31,433
This is great, just great.

505
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:34,376
What did they pay you for this?

506
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:38,245
<i>- What does who pay me?
- Ellen and Clipster.</i>

507
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:42,376
This is some kind
of birthday gag, right?

508
00:30:42,453 --> 00:30:44,887
This is really great.

509
00:30:44,955 --> 00:30:47,856
Who was that big guy
at the house?

510
00:30:47,925 --> 00:30:49,859
Another actor?

511
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:53,124
Boy, he scared
the shit out of me.

512
00:30:53,197 --> 00:30:56,428
I don't think you understand.

513
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,298
Shhh, I don't want
to hear a thing.

514
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,170
I just want to
play along with it.

515
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,734
Do you do this a lot,
change people's lives?

516
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:12,043
I've been known to make
a few adjustments now and again.

517
00:31:27,264 --> 00:31:29,960
I live in a hotel?

518
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:33,231
It's a private home,
and it's all yours.

519
00:31:33,304 --> 00:31:35,295
Yeah, right.

520
00:31:35,372 --> 00:31:38,239
Wait here until
I get to the door.

521
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:42,837
- You wouldn't want to miss
the expression on my face.
- Not for all the world.

522
00:31:42,913 --> 00:31:45,177
I assume you're
taken care of...

523
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:48,184
but here's $5.00.
You were really great.

524
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,848
Wow, this must've
cost them a fortune.

525
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:07,327
I'm here at the door
to my new home.

526
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:14,742
I'm Larry Burrows,
but you probably already know that.

527
00:32:14,812 --> 00:32:17,007
Yes, of course, sir.

528
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:20,573
Is my wife here?
As if I didn't know.

529
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:22,585
Of course she is.

530
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:29,824
Wow, nice setup.

531
00:32:29,893 --> 00:32:34,023
I didn't know you could rent
places like this for parties.

532
00:32:34,098 --> 00:32:37,534
- What's your name?
- It's Boswell, sir.

533
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:40,866
Good name.
You pick that yourself?

534
00:32:40,938 --> 00:32:44,305
Here, here.
Here's a fin.

535
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:47,139
Get yourself something nice.

536
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:53,244
<i>- "A fin"?
- Boswell...</i>

537
00:32:53,317 --> 00:32:55,979
watch how surprised
I'm gonna be.

538
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:59,420
Get ready with
the Academy Award.

539
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,152
Honey, I'm here!

540
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:04,160
It's me!

541
00:33:04,228 --> 00:33:07,664
You're home!
I was so worried.

542
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,733
Daddy, Daddy,
did you bring us something?

543
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:15,237
Ludwig went to pick you up...

544
00:33:15,306 --> 00:33:19,003
- but they said you'd already left.
- CindyJo.

545
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:21,806
What are you doing here?
Are you in on this?

546
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:24,006
Where's Clip and Ellen?

547
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:28,381
Who are Clip and Ellen?
What are you talking about?

548
00:33:28,452 --> 00:33:31,910
- My surprise birthday party.
- It's in 2 hours.

549
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:35,618
You told me you didn't
want it to be a surprise...

550
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:37,684
because you hate surprises.

551
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,965
Darling, what's wrong?

552
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:49,995
Nothing... is wrong.

553
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:55,138
Will you excuse me a minute?

554
00:34:06,123 --> 00:34:08,148
Whew!

555
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:10,819
<i>Mike!</i>

556
00:34:11,995 --> 00:34:14,520
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

557
00:34:14,598 --> 00:34:17,533
Why is CindyJo
calling me sweetheart?

558
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:20,661
Who are those kids?
What is this place?

559
00:34:20,738 --> 00:34:23,571
This is your house.
Those are your children.

560
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,904
CindyJo's your wife.

561
00:34:28,612 --> 00:34:30,580
No-o-o!

562
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:33,275
Yes.

563
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:41,646
<i>- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not.</i>

564
00:34:41,725 --> 00:34:45,183
I mean, this kind of thing
doesn't happen every day.

565
00:34:45,262 --> 00:34:48,459
It is remarkable,
if I do say so myself.

566
00:34:48,532 --> 00:34:50,625
<i>I don't understand.</i>

567
00:34:50,701 --> 00:34:53,033
How can my life
change so much...

568
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:55,537
just because
I hit one baseball?

569
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:58,302
You see, Larry,
one's destiny...

570
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,843
is a very complicated thing.

571
00:35:00,911 --> 00:35:03,709
Every incident
in a person's life...

572
00:35:03,781 --> 00:35:06,511
affects everything else
that follows it.

573
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:10,519
Instead of missing
the baseball, you hit it.

574
00:35:10,587 --> 00:35:13,818
Then you became a hero,
married the prom queen...

575
00:35:13,891 --> 00:35:16,223
and so on and so forth...

576
00:35:16,293 --> 00:35:20,821
until you find yourself
exactly where you are.

577
00:35:20,898 --> 00:35:22,991
So you see...

578
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:26,001
hitting that baseball...

579
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:30,062
has spun your life off in
an entirely new direction.

580
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:34,110
Are you an angel or something?

581
00:35:34,178 --> 00:35:37,670
Not exactly, no.

582
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:39,477
What are you?

583
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:43,518
Have you ever been
faced with a decision...

584
00:35:43,587 --> 00:35:45,817
and you weren't
sure what to do?

585
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:48,380
Sure, plenty of times.

586
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:52,452
And then something
inside you made you choose
one direction over another?

587
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:55,020
Yeah.
So?

588
00:35:55,098 --> 00:35:57,032
So that's me.

589
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,230
I make the suggestions,
and you make the choices.

590
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:04,001
That's how destiny works...

591
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:06,167
very subtly.

592
00:36:06,243 --> 00:36:10,407
Welcome to your
new life, Larry.

593
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:12,949
I hope you like it.

594
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:15,919
Mike.

595
00:36:15,986 --> 00:36:18,648
<i>Hey, wait a second.</i>

596
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:20,713
Mike, hey!

597
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:23,555
Mike! Mike!

598
00:36:25,963 --> 00:36:28,989
What am I supposed to do now?

599
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:51,653
Hi, it's me again.
Larry Burrows.

600
00:36:51,722 --> 00:36:54,589
Why did you
run out of the house?

601
00:36:57,327 --> 00:36:59,261
Um...

602
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:03,428
I forgot to tip the cabbie.

603
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,561
You took a cab?
Why didn't you wait for Ludwig?

604
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:09,572
Ludwig?

605
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:14,636
Oh, Ludwig, good old Ludwig.

606
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,775
I didn't wait for
Ludwig because...

607
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:23,445
I can't remember his...

608
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,216
face.

609
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:30,525
You must be very tired,
sweetheart.

610
00:37:30,594 --> 00:37:32,721
Yes.

611
00:37:32,796 --> 00:37:34,764
Go into the library...

612
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:37,163
and have a nice drink
before dinner.

613
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:39,168
Okay.

614
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:48,204
By the way,
where's the library?

615
00:37:48,278 --> 00:37:51,475
It's over there.

616
00:37:54,084 --> 00:37:58,077
Great.
Yeah, thanks.

617
00:38:04,461 --> 00:38:07,624
So, I'll just
be in the library...

618
00:38:07,698 --> 00:38:09,791
having a drink.

619
00:38:09,866 --> 00:38:12,130
Thanks again.

620
00:38:15,806 --> 00:38:17,637
Geez!

621
00:38:24,815 --> 00:38:28,182
I must belong to
the Book-of-the-Month Club.

622
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:53,807
Oh, Boswell!
How you doin'?

623
00:38:53,877 --> 00:38:56,903
Am I glad to see you.

624
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,313
Your evening drink, sir.

625
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:02,614
- What is it?
- Armagnac.

626
00:39:02,686 --> 00:39:04,950
1953.

627
00:39:06,556 --> 00:39:10,583
Whoa!
I'm going to pass.

628
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:12,595
What I could use is
a nice cold brewsky.

629
00:39:12,663 --> 00:39:16,155
<i>- I'm parched.
- A brewsky, sir?</i>

630
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:18,497
Light, if you've got it,
no glass.

631
00:39:18,568 --> 00:39:20,900
Can you tell me
where the can is?

632
00:39:20,971 --> 00:39:24,031
<i>Had a couple of drinks
after work. Know what I mean?</i>

633
00:39:24,107 --> 00:39:26,803
- The can, sir?
- Yeah, the bathroom.

634
00:39:26,877 --> 00:39:30,404
Well, sir,
there are 15 bathrooms.

635
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,846
15 bathrooms?

636
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:35,885
Did you have any
particular one in mind?

637
00:39:35,952 --> 00:39:40,651
No. Nothing special.
The nearest one will do.

638
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:46,556
Through that door,
down the hall.

639
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,757
Thank you.

640
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:53,131
Brewsky.

641
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:01,710
A closet.

642
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:06,172
Another closet.

643
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:13,186
15 bathrooms,
you'd think I could find one.

644
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,461
Maybe this is it.

645
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:44,452
My God, I've died
and gone to heaven.

646
00:40:46,757 --> 00:40:48,884
Excuse me, sir.

647
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:52,793
Would you like to go
for a ride before dinner?

648
00:40:52,863 --> 00:40:55,889
No, thanks.

649
00:40:58,668 --> 00:41:03,537
Tell me, who do
these cars belong to?

650
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:05,666
They belong to you, sir.

651
00:41:05,742 --> 00:41:09,303
- Get the hell out of here!
- As you wish.

652
00:41:28,665 --> 00:41:32,294
Hey, wow...

653
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:35,065
a big hunk of cheese!

654
00:41:35,138 --> 00:41:37,072
It's just what I wanted.

655
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:43,479
- It's Stilton, L.J.
- Thank you, Mr. Stilton.

656
00:41:43,547 --> 00:41:47,779
It goes great with tomato,
mayonnaise, and pumpernickel.

657
00:41:47,851 --> 00:41:51,947
Thank you for remembering
my birthday.

658
00:41:52,022 --> 00:41:54,718
The gifts are terrific.

659
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,759
Thank you, Mr. Stilton.

660
00:41:56,827 --> 00:41:59,955
- And you, Mr. Steuben,
for the big hunk of glass.
- My pleasure.

661
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,894
Hey, L.J.

662
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:09,029
Dad, you're here.

663
00:42:09,105 --> 00:42:13,201
Many happy returns.
Swell shindig!

664
00:42:13,276 --> 00:42:15,710
Say hello to Gina.
Gina, my kid.

665
00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:17,872
Very nice to make
your acquaintance.

666
00:42:17,948 --> 00:42:22,647
We met in Morocco, Club Med,
know what I mean.

667
00:42:25,288 --> 00:42:27,654
Will you excuse us?

668
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:32,593
- Go have more caviar.
- Okay.

669
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:37,593
Nice to have
met you, L.J.

670
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:46,942
<i>She loves caviar.
Thinks it's salty candy.</i>

671
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:50,070
I haven't told her
it's fish eggs.

672
00:42:50,146 --> 00:42:54,446
Are you crazy
bringing her here?

673
00:42:54,517 --> 00:42:57,850
What if mom found out?
She'd skin you alive!

674
00:42:57,921 --> 00:43:00,788
Relax. We signed
the papers a week ago.

675
00:43:00,857 --> 00:43:03,883
I'm free and clear.
What do you think... hot stuff!

676
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,894
<i>What papers?</i>

677
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:07,930
Divorce papers.

678
00:43:07,998 --> 00:43:10,660
You and mom are divorced?

679
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:14,033
Of course.
Nothing lasts forever.

680
00:43:14,104 --> 00:43:16,732
You told me so.

681
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:19,400
- I said that?
- You were right, too.

682
00:43:19,476 --> 00:43:22,172
Can you spot me 10 grand?

683
00:43:22,245 --> 00:43:25,112
Gina's killin' me
to take her to St. Bart's.

684
00:43:25,181 --> 00:43:28,014
You're aces, kid.

685
00:43:35,725 --> 00:43:39,627
Your guests are wondering
if you're all right.

686
00:43:39,696 --> 00:43:42,790
What's the matter?

687
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:44,857
My parents are divorced.

688
00:43:44,935 --> 00:43:49,599
Of course.
Everybody's parents are.

689
00:43:49,673 --> 00:43:52,335
<i>Go be a good host.</i>

690
00:43:55,512 --> 00:43:57,707
Excuse me a moment.

691
00:44:02,886 --> 00:44:05,855
You didn't tell me
they were divorced!

692
00:44:05,922 --> 00:44:08,652
This is quite good caviar.

693
00:44:08,725 --> 00:44:10,920
My parents are divorced,
for Christ's sake!

694
00:44:10,994 --> 00:44:12,757
I know.

695
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:16,560
I didn't expect that!

696
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:19,966
Is there anything else
that will come as a shock?

697
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:23,199
It all will, to some degree.

698
00:44:23,273 --> 00:44:26,037
<i>- To what degree?
- You'll see.</i>

699
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:30,569
Things changed. You have to
take the bad with the good.

700
00:44:30,647 --> 00:44:33,775
Didn't think everything
would be perfect, did you?

701
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:36,910
Well, I...

702
00:44:36,987 --> 00:44:39,148
I suppose not.

703
00:44:39,222 --> 00:44:43,249
This is your life, Larry.

704
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:46,159
Learn to enjoy what you've got.

705
00:44:58,008 --> 00:45:00,875
A brewsky, sir?

706
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:04,513
Good night.

707
00:45:04,581 --> 00:45:06,674
Bye-bye.

708
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,049
I've got some great friends,
don't you think?

709
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,384
They give terrific gifts!

710
00:45:12,455 --> 00:45:16,118
You have one more coming.

711
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:25,261
I'll see you upstairs.

712
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:37,443
CindyJo?

713
00:45:39,582 --> 00:45:41,516
<i>Are you in here?</i>

714
00:45:44,187 --> 00:45:47,122
<i>I'm over here.</i>

715
00:46:07,343 --> 00:46:10,608
Happy birthday, darling.

716
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,205
God help me.

717
00:46:32,068 --> 00:46:34,730
Morning, Bos.
Sleep well?

718
00:46:34,804 --> 00:46:36,738
I didn't, if know what I mean?

719
00:46:36,806 --> 00:46:39,934
I know exactly what you mean.

720
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:43,911
This house has
a lot of big rooms.

721
00:46:47,517 --> 00:46:50,714
Isn't this a little drab
for such a happy guy?

722
00:46:50,787 --> 00:46:54,621
You always wear blue pinstripe
to board meetings.

723
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:56,716
Board meetings?

724
00:46:56,793 --> 00:47:00,320
Son of a bitch.
I'm married to CindyJo!

725
00:47:00,396 --> 00:47:04,560
That means I'm president
of Liberty Republic.

726
00:47:04,634 --> 00:47:05,566
Indeed, sir.

727
00:47:05,635 --> 00:47:07,398
For some time now.

728
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:10,166
Oh, yeah.

729
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,708
I mean, I knew that.

730
00:47:12,775 --> 00:47:17,371
I'm so happy about it,
I like to remind myself.

731
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,485
Oh.

732
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:35,220
Good morning, kids.

733
00:47:35,298 --> 00:47:36,765
Morning, Father.

734
00:47:39,469 --> 00:47:41,801
Ah, crescent rolls!

735
00:47:41,871 --> 00:47:43,998
Very nice.

736
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:46,675
Very nice, indeed.

737
00:47:49,612 --> 00:47:51,876
Larry Burrows.
How you doing?

738
00:47:51,948 --> 00:47:54,473
Nice to meet you.

739
00:47:56,586 --> 00:47:58,747
What's this?
Cream of Wheat?

740
00:47:58,821 --> 00:48:00,982
It's cappuccino, Daddy.

741
00:48:01,057 --> 00:48:03,855
Italian dark roast coffee
and steamed whole milk.

742
00:48:03,927 --> 00:48:06,862
Right, I knew that.

743
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:13,066
That'll keep you up
the rest of your life!

744
00:48:15,872 --> 00:48:20,241
It's nice. Should you
kids be drinking this?

745
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:23,643
We always do.

746
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:27,376
I guess it's all right, then.

747
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:29,509
Morning!

748
00:48:29,586 --> 00:48:30,883
Hi.

749
00:48:30,954 --> 00:48:34,856
You were wonderful last night.

750
00:48:34,924 --> 00:48:37,916
So were you.

751
00:48:37,994 --> 00:48:40,895
I had no idea you could
do that with Cool Whip.

752
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,002
Wow!

753
00:48:52,075 --> 00:48:54,942
I told you we could beat
that train through the crossing.

754
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:56,808
So you did, sir.

755
00:48:56,879 --> 00:49:01,213
Give yourself a raise.
One hundred bucks a week!

756
00:49:01,284 --> 00:49:03,548
You're all right.

757
00:49:08,758 --> 00:49:11,090
Wow!

758
00:49:14,631 --> 00:49:18,795
<i>This is my office?</i>

759
00:49:22,772 --> 00:49:26,230
This will take
some getting used to.

760
00:49:33,149 --> 00:49:36,118
<i>Nice desk!</i>

761
00:49:39,555 --> 00:49:42,251
I wonder how it works.

762
00:49:44,394 --> 00:49:46,919
There's got to be an
"on" switch somewhere.

763
00:49:51,934 --> 00:49:55,563
How about that?
The desk is wired to my ass.

764
00:49:59,442 --> 00:50:02,434
<i>Good morning, Mr. Burrows.</i>

765
00:50:02,512 --> 00:50:06,949
<i>- Hi. How are you?
- Can I get you something?</i>

766
00:50:07,016 --> 00:50:11,453
No, I'm fine.
Coffee!

767
00:50:11,521 --> 00:50:13,682
I'd really like
a cup of coffee.

768
00:50:13,756 --> 00:50:18,318
<i>Right away. Mr. Pender and
Mr. Flick are on their way.</i>

769
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:21,693
You're kidding!
Those jerks still work here?

770
00:50:21,764 --> 00:50:23,925
<i>- Pardon?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.</i>

771
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,492
Do me a favor.

772
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:31,666
Find out if Clip Metzler
or Ellen Burr...

773
00:50:31,741 --> 00:50:34,733
Ripley... Ellen Ripley,
work here.

774
00:50:34,811 --> 00:50:37,837
<i>Metzler works in accounting.
I'll have to check on Ripley.</i>

775
00:50:37,914 --> 00:50:41,611
Thanks, and tell Pender
and Flick that, uh...

776
00:50:41,684 --> 00:50:43,675
I can't be disturbed.

777
00:50:43,753 --> 00:50:46,244
<i>- I'm too busy. I've got
lots of buttons to push.
- Yes, sir.</i>

778
00:50:46,322 --> 00:50:48,620
Over and out.

779
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,425
Let's see.

780
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:02,895
Where's the bar?

781
00:51:07,577 --> 00:51:10,137
I'm going to love this place.

782
00:51:14,183 --> 00:51:16,913
All right!
The good stuff.

783
00:51:24,093 --> 00:51:28,587
I know you.
You're the forklift girl.

784
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:31,132
Great, thanks.

785
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,658
I've been trying to get
regular coffee for days.

786
00:51:34,737 --> 00:51:38,264
Then again,
maybe I don't need coffee.

787
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:40,605
Where the hell
were you last night?

788
00:51:40,676 --> 00:51:44,134
I waited until midnight,
and went to bed... alone.

789
00:51:44,213 --> 00:51:47,580
I'm sorry.

790
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:49,641
Jewel!

791
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:51,584
Forgotten my name already?

792
00:51:51,654 --> 00:51:55,522
Jewel, I knew that.

793
00:51:55,591 --> 00:51:58,583
I'm real, real sorry.

794
00:51:58,661 --> 00:52:00,754
I guess I couldn't make it.

795
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:03,128
- I had this party...
- Couldn't make it?

796
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,929
Were you out with that
Ripley bitch?

797
00:52:06,002 --> 00:52:08,163
Does she works here?

798
00:52:08,237 --> 00:52:10,831
No, she does not work here.

799
00:52:10,907 --> 00:52:12,898
If she suddenly
starts working here...

800
00:52:12,975 --> 00:52:15,000
you're going to live
to regret it.

801
00:52:15,077 --> 00:52:18,569
What do you say
we double your salary?

802
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:21,947
I know what
you're capable of, L.J.

803
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:23,986
Don't mess with me...

804
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:26,681
or you'll find out
what I'm capable of.

805
00:52:26,756 --> 00:52:30,214
Am I making myself
perfectly clear?

806
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:36,965
<i>- Perfectly.
- We need to talk.</i>

807
00:52:37,033 --> 00:52:39,297
Whoa.

808
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:43,202
Hi, guys.
Come in.

809
00:52:43,272 --> 00:52:45,035
I'm glad to see you.

810
00:52:45,107 --> 00:52:48,941
About the plan, I've got
to tell Bob either way.

811
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:51,707
I think it's a big mistake
to set up New Jersey.

812
00:52:51,781 --> 00:52:53,874
We need to talk
about the country club.

813
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,111
We have to go over
the Nakamura deal...

814
00:52:56,185 --> 00:52:59,848
before we sign the papers.
Are we on?

815
00:52:59,922 --> 00:53:02,948
- For New Jersey?
- No, for golf.

816
00:53:03,025 --> 00:53:05,152
Excuse me.

817
00:53:05,228 --> 00:53:07,958
<i>Am I disturbing you?</i>

818
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:10,225
Mr. Hansen,
come in.

819
00:53:12,502 --> 00:53:14,436
Come in.
Mr. Hansen!

820
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:17,830
<i>Come on in, please.</i>

821
00:53:17,907 --> 00:53:21,070
What can I do for you?

822
00:53:21,143 --> 00:53:25,170
I wanted to apologize for
not appearing at your party.

823
00:53:25,248 --> 00:53:27,614
My ulcer was acting up.

824
00:53:27,683 --> 00:53:32,518
You didn't miss a thing. I got
some cheese and a glass thing.

825
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:34,681
- A what?
- You know...

826
00:53:34,757 --> 00:53:36,816
<i>Excuse me.</i>

827
00:53:36,893 --> 00:53:41,125
We should go.
We tee off in 15 minutes.

828
00:53:41,197 --> 00:53:44,724
Oh, right.

829
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,361
Would you like to golf with us?

830
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:51,099
<i>- I play golf, you know.
- Really?</i>

831
00:53:51,173 --> 00:53:54,700
- You want to play golf with me?
- Sure. Come on.

832
00:53:54,777 --> 00:53:56,802
I can help you get rid
of that slice or whatever.

833
00:54:18,067 --> 00:54:20,297
It slipped.

834
00:54:22,872 --> 00:54:24,897
Can I use yours?

835
00:54:26,142 --> 00:54:28,975
<i>- Sure.
- Thanks.</i>

836
00:54:29,045 --> 00:54:31,570
It's not like a baseball bat.

837
00:54:39,722 --> 00:54:42,384
That was dirt.

838
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:45,120
<i>- That'll grow back, right?
- We'll fix it.</i>

839
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:47,492
This is the real one.

840
00:54:56,606 --> 00:55:00,042
- It's not supposed to
go over there?
- No, sir.

841
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:04,307
It's supposed to go
in the hole... on the green.

842
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,577
Oh. All right.
Leo, come on.

843
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,210
<i>Let's take the cart
and find the ball.</i>

844
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:12,584
I don't get it.

845
00:55:12,655 --> 00:55:15,385
Are you deaf, dumb, and blind?

846
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:18,188
The Jerry Lewis routine is
to lull the old geezer...

847
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,455
into a false sense
of security...

848
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:22,793
before he sells the company
out from under him.

849
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:25,390
It's brilliant.
It's my idea.

850
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,241
Hey, how you doing?

851
00:55:40,316 --> 00:55:42,284
Good to see you.

852
00:55:42,351 --> 00:55:45,548
You're doing a great job
and I want you to know that.

853
00:55:45,621 --> 00:55:48,055
Keep up the good work.

854
00:55:48,124 --> 00:55:51,150
<i>What's with him?</i>

855
00:55:52,862 --> 00:55:55,296
As president, I should do
something about this line...

856
00:55:55,364 --> 00:55:56,956
don't you think?

857
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:06,033
Oh, my God.

858
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:10,538
Ellen!

859
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:16,574
It's me, Larry.
Am I glad to see you.

860
00:56:16,652 --> 00:56:19,587
I've been wondering
where you were.

861
00:56:19,655 --> 00:56:22,419
I beg your pardon?

862
00:56:22,491 --> 00:56:24,482
They told me you
didn't work here.

863
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,290
There's no record of
a Ripley or a Burrows.

864
00:56:27,363 --> 00:56:30,332
My name is Robertson.

865
00:56:30,399 --> 00:56:34,062
Robertson?
Why that name?

866
00:56:34,136 --> 00:56:38,698
It's customary for a woman
to take her husband's name.

867
00:56:38,774 --> 00:56:40,799
<i>If you'll excuse me.</i>

868
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:47,144
You're married?
When did that happen?

869
00:56:47,216 --> 00:56:50,276
Six years ago. Don't worry,
it wasn't on company time.

870
00:56:50,352 --> 00:56:53,844
Wait. You married the first guy
that came along?

871
00:56:53,923 --> 00:56:57,484
Just because I work for you
does not give you the right...

872
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,858
to pry into my private life.

873
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:05,422
Well, of course it doesn't.

874
00:57:05,501 --> 00:57:07,560
I'm just concerned...

875
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:11,003
as I am about
all my employees...

876
00:57:11,073 --> 00:57:13,166
Mrs. Robertson.

877
00:57:13,242 --> 00:57:17,611
Concern for employees
has never been your strong suit.

878
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,705
<i>Now, excuse me.</i>

879
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:23,115
I'd like to eat my lunch
by myself.

880
00:57:24,053 --> 00:57:26,988
Yeah, but...
couldn't we...

881
00:57:40,936 --> 00:57:43,404
You really must do something...

882
00:57:43,472 --> 00:57:45,804
about this meat loaf, Larry.

883
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:48,343
It's absolutely inedible.

884
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:51,777
Ellen's married.

885
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:54,077
Yes, I know.

886
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:58,143
She's mad at me, I can tell.

887
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,711
<i>She's the union shop steward.</i>

888
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:03,623
And the union's upset
over all the layoffs...

889
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:06,058
the increased work load,
pay freezes...

890
00:58:06,128 --> 00:58:07,857
What's that got to do with me?

891
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:11,730
You are the president,
their mortal enemy.

892
00:58:11,801 --> 00:58:15,032
<i>- But I wouldn't lay anybody off.
- But you did.</i>

893
00:58:15,104 --> 00:58:18,505
And so...
Ellen hates your guts.

894
00:58:18,574 --> 00:58:21,907
She hates my personal guts?

895
00:58:21,977 --> 00:58:25,037
You'll find a lot of people
don't like you.

896
00:58:25,114 --> 00:58:27,412
What am I going to do?
I can't have her hating me.

897
00:58:27,483 --> 00:58:29,747
She's my wife.

898
00:58:29,819 --> 00:58:32,481
<i>She was your wife.</i>

899
00:58:32,555 --> 00:58:35,524
I have to go. This meat loaf
is making me sick.

900
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:37,616
What am I going to do
about Ellen?

901
00:58:37,693 --> 00:58:41,220
Whatever you do will be fine.

902
00:58:41,297 --> 00:58:44,562
You're a big help.

903
00:58:57,506 --> 00:59:00,031
I think it's busted, pal.

904
00:59:00,109 --> 00:59:02,339
Huh?

905
00:59:02,411 --> 00:59:04,606
Clip, it's you!

906
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,671
Oh, my God,
Mr. Burrows, sir.

907
00:59:06,749 --> 00:59:10,276
Don't call me sir, Clip.
It's me, Lar.

908
00:59:10,352 --> 00:59:12,547
Come here and give me a hug.

909
00:59:12,621 --> 00:59:14,646
God, I miss you.

910
00:59:14,723 --> 00:59:17,157
It was an accident.
I'll pay for damages!

911
00:59:17,226 --> 00:59:20,389
Forget it. I want to
kiss the top of your head.

912
00:59:20,462 --> 00:59:22,930
<i>Clip?</i>

913
00:59:22,998 --> 00:59:26,729
Clip, what's the
matter with you?

914
00:59:26,802 --> 00:59:29,327
Clipster, it's me...

915
00:59:29,405 --> 00:59:31,339
Larry.

916
00:59:44,753 --> 00:59:47,654
<i>Larry, we're going to be late.</i>

917
00:59:48,591 --> 00:59:51,583
What on earth are you doing?

918
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,629
I don't feel like going
to the opera tonight.

919
00:59:54,697 --> 00:59:56,995
I never cared for it
that much...

920
00:59:57,066 --> 00:59:59,728
all that hollering in Italian.

921
00:59:59,802 --> 01:00:02,566
What's that?

922
01:00:02,638 --> 01:00:05,232
This is a gullwing Mercedes.

923
01:00:05,307 --> 01:00:07,275
Pretty, isn't it?

924
01:00:07,343 --> 01:00:09,277
<i>Yes, dear.</i>

925
01:00:09,345 --> 01:00:11,506
You have one in the garage.

926
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:16,142
That one's too big.
I like them smaller.

927
01:00:16,218 --> 01:00:19,210
Children, wait in the car.

928
01:00:23,225 --> 01:00:25,625
- Darling?
- Hmm?

929
01:00:25,694 --> 01:00:28,254
Are you all right?

930
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:32,096
You've been acting
very strange lately.

931
01:00:32,167 --> 01:00:34,601
No, I'm fine!

932
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,638
Really.

933
01:00:36,705 --> 01:00:39,333
You guys go ahead.
Have a good time.

934
01:00:39,408 --> 01:00:43,208
I just want to finish this.

935
01:01:05,534 --> 01:01:08,799
<i>I can't believe
Ellen married another guy.</i>

936
01:01:23,185 --> 01:01:25,415
<i>Wow, nice house!</i>

937
01:01:26,689 --> 01:01:29,624
It's better
than the one we had.

938
01:01:31,193 --> 01:01:34,185
I just wanted to borrow
some cutlery, Ellen.

939
01:01:34,263 --> 01:01:37,596
<i>I have no cutlery.
None!</i>

940
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:40,794
I'm asking for a couple
of lousy knives and forks.

941
01:01:40,869 --> 01:01:42,769
Ask your girlfriend...

942
01:01:42,838 --> 01:01:45,306
or does the little
bitch eat with her fingers?

943
01:01:45,374 --> 01:01:49,276
I made a mistake and
I'm very sorry for it.

944
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,846
Can we put all this behind us?

945
01:01:56,552 --> 01:01:58,520
Atta girl!

946
01:01:58,587 --> 01:02:01,147
Guess not.

947
01:02:10,733 --> 01:02:14,396
This is good.
This is very good.

948
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:54,309
Aaah! Ow!

949
01:02:54,376 --> 01:02:57,402
What's the matter, Hercules?

950
01:02:57,479 --> 01:03:00,209
<i>You wanna go out?</i>

951
01:03:00,282 --> 01:03:02,546
Okay, come on.

952
01:03:02,618 --> 01:03:04,779
Come on!

953
01:03:14,196 --> 01:03:17,632
Shoo!
Get away.

954
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:19,792
<i>Scram!
Beat it!</i>

955
01:03:19,868 --> 01:03:22,530
Go rescue some skiers
in the Alps.

956
01:03:29,378 --> 01:03:33,075
We'll see
who falls asleep first.

957
01:03:37,352 --> 01:03:39,286
Asshole.

958
01:03:47,162 --> 01:03:49,187
Ow!

959
01:03:54,403 --> 01:03:56,496
Stupid dog.

960
01:03:56,572 --> 01:03:58,938
Stupid tree.

961
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:26,568
- Good morning, chief.
- What's going on?

962
01:04:26,635 --> 01:04:28,830
<i>- Who's that?
- I don't know...</i>

963
01:04:28,904 --> 01:04:31,702
some lunatic named,
ah, what's his name?

964
01:04:31,773 --> 01:04:34,901
<i>Metzbaum, Metsfield?
He's in accounting.</i>

965
01:04:34,977 --> 01:04:37,468
Metzler?

966
01:04:37,546 --> 01:04:39,810
- Clip Metzler?
- Yeah.

967
01:04:39,882 --> 01:04:43,374
- He's threatening to jump.
- Jesus, Clip!

968
01:05:02,404 --> 01:05:04,235
Clip?

969
01:05:04,306 --> 01:05:08,106
<i>- What are you doing?
- Stay back, Mr. Burrows.</i>

970
01:05:08,176 --> 01:05:10,110
Don't get closer or I'll jump.

971
01:05:10,178 --> 01:05:13,079
Okay, I'm not going
to come any closer.

972
01:05:13,148 --> 01:05:16,845
I just want to talk.

973
01:05:16,919 --> 01:05:19,786
If there's something wrong,
maybe I can help.

974
01:05:19,855 --> 01:05:23,518
It's a little late
for that, Mr. Burrows.

975
01:05:23,592 --> 01:05:27,028
<i>My whole life's
been a disaster.</i>

976
01:05:27,095 --> 01:05:30,189
Nothing I do ever works out.

977
01:05:30,265 --> 01:05:33,496
After what happened yesterday,
I know you're gonna fire me.

978
01:05:33,569 --> 01:05:37,972
Look, Clip,
I'm not gonna fire you.

979
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,235
All right?

980
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:43,608
In fact, I came up
to offer you a new job.

981
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,909
<i>How 'bout vice president?</i>

982
01:05:45,981 --> 01:05:47,915
<i>$ 125,000 to start.</i>

983
01:05:47,983 --> 01:05:50,713
- Really?
- Yeah, really!

984
01:06:00,362 --> 01:06:03,525
I get it.

985
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,295
You're trying to trick me.
Soon as I get down...

986
01:06:06,368 --> 01:06:10,304
there's no job,
and I'm off to the funny farm.

987
01:06:10,372 --> 01:06:13,136
<i>Don't try to kid me,
Mr. Burrows.</i>

988
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:15,574
I'm not kidding, Clip.

989
01:06:16,712 --> 01:06:20,239
Nothing will happen.
I mean it.

990
01:06:20,315 --> 01:06:23,079
Why else would
I come up here myself?

991
01:06:23,151 --> 01:06:25,119
I don't know.

992
01:06:25,187 --> 01:06:27,747
Why did you come up here?

993
01:06:27,823 --> 01:06:30,485
Because we're friends, Clip.

994
01:06:32,394 --> 01:06:35,329
Remember the 8th grade when we
used to hang around together?

995
01:06:35,397 --> 01:06:38,366
We'd throw rubber vomit
in the girls' locker room...

996
01:06:38,433 --> 01:06:40,367
and they'd run out
in their underwear.

997
01:06:40,435 --> 01:06:44,166
- You remember that?
- Yeah, of course I do!

998
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:47,231
<i>We went to see
Bonnie and Clyde 9 times.</i>

999
01:06:47,309 --> 01:06:49,573
We squirted ketchup
on ourselves...

1000
01:06:49,645 --> 01:06:51,840
and ran all over
dying in slow motion.

1001
01:06:51,913 --> 01:06:55,212
That was fun.

1002
01:06:57,953 --> 01:07:01,081
It scared the crap
out of my baby sister.

1003
01:07:01,156 --> 01:07:03,681
And I remember...

1004
01:07:03,759 --> 01:07:07,195
how you tried to make me
laugh when I felt rotten.

1005
01:07:10,098 --> 01:07:11,793
I, I...

1006
01:07:11,867 --> 01:07:16,133
I didn't think you thought
about that stuff anymore.

1007
01:07:16,204 --> 01:07:18,832
Aw, Clip...

1008
01:07:18,907 --> 01:07:23,037
I think about that stuff
all the time.

1009
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:30,978
Clip, I want you to go home...

1010
01:07:31,053 --> 01:07:33,988
relax, have a nice meal...

1011
01:07:34,056 --> 01:07:36,752
shave, shower, get some sleep.

1012
01:07:36,825 --> 01:07:40,352
Tomorrow, you start
your new job, new salary.

1013
01:07:40,429 --> 01:07:42,363
Thanks,
Mr. Burrows.

1014
01:07:42,431 --> 01:07:45,161
Take care of yourself,
be careful.

1015
01:07:45,233 --> 01:07:47,167
Pender!

1016
01:07:47,235 --> 01:07:49,726
Well done,
L.J.

1017
01:07:49,805 --> 01:07:52,239
Want me to fire him?

1018
01:07:52,307 --> 01:07:55,799
No, I don't want
you to fire him.

1019
01:07:55,877 --> 01:07:58,277
I want you to get him
a new Mercedes.

1020
01:07:58,346 --> 01:08:00,940
A senior vice president
of East Coast sales...

1021
01:08:01,016 --> 01:08:03,883
can't be seen in anything less.

1022
01:08:03,952 --> 01:08:08,651
Mercedes? L.J.,
I didn't even get one.

1023
01:08:08,724 --> 01:08:10,783
While you're at it...

1024
01:08:10,859 --> 01:08:13,794
get the board together
for a full meeting.

1025
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:16,558
We're gonna put an end
to this strike bullshit.

1026
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:17,859
But...

1027
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:21,096
I don't have a problem
with that, Pender, do you?

1028
01:08:22,738 --> 01:08:26,037
Well, do you, Pender?

1029
01:08:26,108 --> 01:08:29,908
No, sir!
No problem.

1030
01:08:29,978 --> 01:08:32,947
I didn't think so.

1031
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:50,463
I just finished reading
the latest contract demands.

1032
01:08:50,532 --> 01:08:54,127
And...
they seem very reasonable.

1033
01:08:54,202 --> 01:08:56,466
Reasonable?
But, L. J...

1034
01:08:56,538 --> 01:08:58,506
<i>In fact...</i>

1035
01:08:58,573 --> 01:09:01,974
I'm prepared to agree to all
of them under one condition.

1036
01:09:02,043 --> 01:09:05,171
<i>That the head of the
negotiating committee...</i>

1037
01:09:05,247 --> 01:09:08,705
<i>meet with me alone to
go over the final details.</i>

1038
01:09:12,854 --> 01:09:15,550
Perhaps over dinner tonight?

1039
01:09:15,624 --> 01:09:18,457
There are a few things
you're forgetting about.

1040
01:09:18,527 --> 01:09:22,429
Dinner? I don't know
why that'd be necessary.

1041
01:09:22,497 --> 01:09:24,397
Strictly business!

1042
01:09:24,466 --> 01:09:27,526
<i>You want to bring this dispute
to an end, don't you?</i>

1043
01:09:27,602 --> 01:09:29,729
Yes, of course I do.

1044
01:09:29,805 --> 01:09:32,273
I'll pick you up at 8:00.
How's that?

1045
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,638
I don't think
we should be so hasty.

1046
01:09:34,709 --> 01:09:37,405
Okay.

1047
01:09:37,479 --> 01:09:39,777
Good!
It's a date.

1048
01:09:47,856 --> 01:09:50,620
I'm gonna nail this bastard.

1049
01:09:59,401 --> 01:10:02,199
Oh, don't do that, Mike.

1050
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:04,602
Congratulations, Larry.

1051
01:10:04,673 --> 01:10:08,165
It's a brave man who takes
command of his own destiny.

1052
01:10:08,243 --> 01:10:12,202
Thanks, I feel
good about it myself.

1053
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:15,078
You don't feel guilty
running around with Ellen...

1054
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:17,084
- behind CindyJo's back?
- Guilty?

1055
01:10:17,152 --> 01:10:19,712
Why should I feel guilty?
I just got here.

1056
01:10:19,788 --> 01:10:23,019
It's not like I have
a history with CindyJo.

1057
01:10:23,091 --> 01:10:27,118
Well, okay, fine.

1058
01:10:27,195 --> 01:10:29,459
Wait a second.

1059
01:10:31,266 --> 01:10:34,167
What do you mean,
"Well, okay, fine"?

1060
01:10:34,236 --> 01:10:36,170
Nothing.
It's just...

1061
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:39,537
CindyJo has been
a loyal and loving wife.

1062
01:10:39,608 --> 01:10:42,441
What are you getting at?

1063
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:45,604
Your destiny has been changed,
by request, I might add.

1064
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,545
You must take responsibility...

1065
01:10:47,616 --> 01:10:50,050
for the circumstances
of your new life.

1066
01:10:50,118 --> 01:10:54,384
<i>They are, after all,
of your own making.</i>

1067
01:10:54,456 --> 01:10:58,517
Well, if I made them,
I can unmake them.

1068
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,995
Good evening,
Mr. Burrows.

1069
01:11:11,072 --> 01:11:13,006
<i>Hi.</i>

1070
01:11:13,074 --> 01:11:15,702
Any trouble finding the place?

1071
01:11:15,777 --> 01:11:18,871
No trouble at all.

1072
01:11:18,947 --> 01:11:20,938
That's good.

1073
01:11:21,016 --> 01:11:23,109
These are for you.

1074
01:11:23,184 --> 01:11:25,482
They're lovely.

1075
01:11:26,388 --> 01:11:28,322
<i>Thank you.</i>

1076
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:30,324
You're welcome.

1077
01:11:30,392 --> 01:11:32,883
I'm afraid Hercules got
dog drool all over them.

1078
01:11:32,961 --> 01:11:35,293
How'd you know
his name was Hercules?

1079
01:11:35,363 --> 01:11:38,628
It's on his tag...

1080
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,760
that I've been staring at
for the past 5 minutes.

1081
01:11:41,836 --> 01:11:45,328
Okay, boy.
Come here, Hercules.

1082
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,272
<i>Hercules!</i>

1083
01:11:56,418 --> 01:11:59,819
Nice doggy, good doggy.

1084
01:11:59,888 --> 01:12:01,856
I don't think he likes me.

1085
01:12:01,923 --> 01:12:05,791
He's an exceptional
judge of character.

1086
01:12:07,395 --> 01:12:10,023
We aren't starting off well,
are we?

1087
01:12:10,098 --> 01:12:12,692
There is only so far I'll go...

1088
01:12:12,767 --> 01:12:17,227
- for my union brothers
and sisters, Mr. Burrows.
- Call me Lar.

1089
01:12:17,305 --> 01:12:20,672
We agreed to keep this
evening on a business level.

1090
01:12:20,742 --> 01:12:23,006
- Correct?
- Absolutely.

1091
01:12:23,078 --> 01:12:26,309
God, I forgot how
beautiful you are.

1092
01:12:26,381 --> 01:12:30,750
Mr. Burrows, if this is
your attempt to soften me up...

1093
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:33,253
so you can win concessions
from the union...

1094
01:12:33,321 --> 01:12:35,289
I don't want concessions.

1095
01:12:35,357 --> 01:12:38,292
<i>The contracts are
as good as signed.</i>

1096
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,794
You could have done
that at the meeting.

1097
01:12:40,862 --> 01:12:44,855
- What are you up to?
- Nothing!

1098
01:12:44,933 --> 01:12:48,300
I just thought we'd get
to know each other again...

1099
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:50,304
uh, better.

1100
01:13:03,518 --> 01:13:05,645
- Wait, just wait.
- Yes, sir.

1101
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,915
No, no, I'll get it.

1102
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:09,923
Wait, I'll get the door.

1103
01:13:09,991 --> 01:13:11,982
My dear.

1104
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,874
Hello?

1105
01:13:27,942 --> 01:13:30,103
Let me talk
to Mrs. Burrows.

1106
01:13:30,178 --> 01:13:32,203
This is
Mrs. Burrows.

1107
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,214
This way.

1108
01:13:39,921 --> 01:13:41,912
<i>Enjoy your meal.</i>

1109
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:44,185
This place is all right, huh?

1110
01:13:44,259 --> 01:13:47,626
- You sound like you've
never been here.
- I haven't.

1111
01:13:47,695 --> 01:13:49,629
My secretary
made the reservations.

1112
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:53,633
<i>- I'm a pizza and burger man.
- Monsieur Burrows, comment sa va?</i>

1113
01:13:53,701 --> 01:13:56,169
Pizza and burger man, huh?

1114
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:01,668
The chef has prepared
something special for you.

1115
01:14:01,743 --> 01:14:04,507
<i>- Great.</i>

1116
01:14:10,919 --> 01:14:12,887
Bring 2 of them.

1117
01:14:12,954 --> 01:14:15,479
It's food, right?
Good.

1118
01:14:15,557 --> 01:14:18,822
I ordered for the both of us.
I hope you don't mind.

1119
01:14:19,627 --> 01:14:21,561
<i>Ahem.</i>

1120
01:14:21,629 --> 01:14:23,597
May I bring for you some wine?

1121
01:14:23,665 --> 01:14:26,691
Yes. I understand the
French make it pretty good.

1122
01:14:26,768 --> 01:14:28,998
No, thank you.
I'll just have...

1123
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:32,039
Virgin Mary, Tabasco sauce,
lime, no ground pepper.

1124
01:14:32,107 --> 01:14:34,098
<i>Right?</i>

1125
01:14:34,175 --> 01:14:36,109
I'm impressed.

1126
01:14:36,177 --> 01:14:39,146
You must have had
your spies working overtime.

1127
01:14:39,214 --> 01:14:42,149
I'll have a light beer,
no glass.

1128
01:14:42,217 --> 01:14:45,516
Spies?
I don't have spies.

1129
01:14:45,587 --> 01:14:48,818
I just happen to know
a lot about you.

1130
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:52,849
Well, I know a few
things about you.

1131
01:14:52,927 --> 01:14:55,293
<i>Yeah? Like what?</i>

1132
01:14:55,363 --> 01:14:57,388
Nothing I could repeat.

1133
01:14:57,465 --> 01:14:59,626
That bad, huh?

1134
01:14:59,701 --> 01:15:01,635
The only thing
that doesn't fit...

1135
01:15:01,703 --> 01:15:03,864
is what you did for Clip
this afternoon.

1136
01:15:03,938 --> 01:15:06,736
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

1137
01:15:06,808 --> 01:15:08,639
Try me.

1138
01:15:11,646 --> 01:15:15,480
How well do you remember 1970?

1139
01:15:25,093 --> 01:15:26,958
Bastard.

1140
01:15:39,107 --> 01:15:41,871
You bastard!

1141
01:15:48,216 --> 01:15:50,776
That's why I did
what I did for Clip.

1142
01:15:50,852 --> 01:15:53,946
That's how come
I know so much about you.

1143
01:15:54,022 --> 01:15:56,081
Because...

1144
01:15:56,157 --> 01:15:58,591
we were married.

1145
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:00,093
Exactly!

1146
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:04,598
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous that sounds?

1147
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:06,463
<i>Well...</i>

1148
01:16:06,534 --> 01:16:09,128
I didn't think
you'd believe me.

1149
01:16:09,204 --> 01:16:11,672
I probably shouldn't
have told you.

1150
01:16:11,739 --> 01:16:13,866
Forget I said anything.

1151
01:16:15,877 --> 01:16:18,243
Ah! Dinner.

1152
01:16:19,347 --> 01:16:22,043
<i>Voila.</i>

1153
01:16:22,116 --> 01:16:24,710
Boy!
It looks pretty good.

1154
01:16:24,786 --> 01:16:28,187
<i>- Do we know what this is?
- Pan de veau, madam.</i>

1155
01:16:28,256 --> 01:16:31,487
<i>Calf brains.
Bon appetit.</i>

1156
01:16:31,559 --> 01:16:34,528

1157
01:16:34,596 --> 01:16:37,531
<i>♪ I knew that I would ♪</i>

1158
01:16:37,599 --> 01:16:39,200
We'd like a large pizza,
double cheese...

1159
01:16:39,267 --> 01:16:42,293
pepperoni, mushrooms
and anchovies.

1160
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:46,204
But only on half, because
anchovies give her heartburn.

1161
01:16:46,274 --> 01:16:47,502
Right?

1162
01:16:47,575 --> 01:16:49,839
- Right.
- Got it?

1163
01:16:49,911 --> 01:16:51,776
Yes, sir.
That'll be about 20 minutes.

1164
01:16:51,846 --> 01:16:53,780
20 minutes.

1165
01:16:53,848 --> 01:16:56,316
<i>- This way, my dear.
And a couple of sodas.
- Got it.</i>

1166
01:17:00,488 --> 01:17:04,549
Tell the truth. How do
you know so much about me?

1167
01:17:04,626 --> 01:17:06,958
You spy on your employees?

1168
01:17:07,028 --> 01:17:09,553
No, I don't I already told you.

1169
01:17:09,631 --> 01:17:11,963
Right.
We were married.

1170
01:17:12,033 --> 01:17:14,126
Exactly!
Thank you.

1171
01:17:16,204 --> 01:17:19,367
- You're not going
to give up, are you?
- No way.

1172
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,533
If we weren't married,
how could I know...

1173
01:17:21,609 --> 01:17:25,238
that you sleep in your dad's
old flannel shirt?

1174
01:17:25,313 --> 01:17:26,837
Spies.

1175
01:17:26,914 --> 01:17:29,883
How come I know
that every night...

1176
01:17:29,951 --> 01:17:34,012
you brush your hair
exactly 86 times?

1177
01:17:34,088 --> 01:17:35,350
Spies.

1178
01:17:35,423 --> 01:17:37,983
Yeah.

1179
01:17:38,059 --> 01:17:41,586
I know your favorite
body part is the earlobe.

1180
01:17:41,663 --> 01:17:43,688
Your favorite actor
is William Bendix...

1181
01:17:43,765 --> 01:17:45,756
because he looks
like Uncle Bud...

1182
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:50,099
<i>whose wife sent 2 dozen
handkerchiefs every Christmas...</i>

1183
01:17:50,171 --> 01:17:54,369
<i>with E.J.R. Embroidered
in the corner.</i>

1184
01:17:54,442 --> 01:17:59,277
That's not the kind of stuff
you get from spies, is it?

1185
01:17:59,347 --> 01:18:02,748
There's got to be a
logical explanation.

1186
01:18:02,817 --> 01:18:06,048
You couldn't possibly
know those things.

1187
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:09,112
I know everything.

1188
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:11,158
Go ahead, ask me.

1189
01:18:11,225 --> 01:18:13,159
Ask me something
I couldn't possibly know.

1190
01:18:13,227 --> 01:18:14,956
But if I'm right...

1191
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:18,760
will you believe we were
married in another life?

1192
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,459
Maybe.

1193
01:18:21,536 --> 01:18:23,504
All right.

1194
01:18:25,773 --> 01:18:27,263
Give me your best shot.

1195
01:18:27,342 --> 01:18:29,310
All right.

1196
01:18:31,245 --> 01:18:33,236
The day I got
my driver's license...

1197
01:18:33,314 --> 01:18:35,782
October 23, 1970.
Right?

1198
01:18:37,952 --> 01:18:41,285
- My dad let me take the car.
- Oldsmobile, vinyl top...

1199
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:47,951
2 blocks from my house,
I got pulled over for speeding.

1200
01:18:50,164 --> 01:18:52,394
I never told anyone.

1201
01:18:52,467 --> 01:18:55,027
Paid for the ticket
out of my own allowance.

1202
01:18:55,103 --> 01:18:56,661
Want the name of the cop?

1203
01:18:56,738 --> 01:18:58,501
No.

1204
01:18:58,573 --> 01:19:01,201
I want the name of the song
on the radio.

1205
01:19:01,275 --> 01:19:02,902
<i>That's it?</i>

1206
01:19:02,977 --> 01:19:05,343
That's your best shot?

1207
01:19:07,548 --> 01:19:11,348
Let's see.
It's not "Mack the Knife."

1208
01:19:11,419 --> 01:19:13,250
It's not "happy Birthday."

1209
01:19:13,321 --> 01:19:17,621
It's not Motley Crue.
They weren't born yet.

1210
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,555
Is it...

1211
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:24,723
this one?

1212
01:19:34,075 --> 01:19:36,009
Oh, God.

1239
01:21:32,793 --> 01:21:35,626
to celebrate the end
of our negotiations?

1240
01:21:35,696 --> 01:21:38,688
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1241
01:21:38,766 --> 01:21:42,133
Maybe after the
contracts are signed.

1242
01:21:42,203 --> 01:21:45,639
Okay.
I understand.

1243
01:21:45,706 --> 01:21:49,233
We'll have to get
those contracts signed quickly.

1244
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:51,904
Got a pen?
I could do it now.

1245
01:21:54,916 --> 01:21:57,578
Good night,
Mr. Burrows.

1246
01:21:57,652 --> 01:22:00,052
Larry, please.

1247
01:22:00,121 --> 01:22:03,284
I had a fun evening.
Thanks.

1248
01:22:03,357 --> 01:22:05,348
I did, too.

1249
01:22:05,426 --> 01:22:07,758
Brought back
a lot of good memories.

1250
01:22:11,966 --> 01:22:15,129
Well...

1251
01:22:15,202 --> 01:22:16,760
good night.

1252
01:22:23,277 --> 01:22:25,370
- Larry!
- Yes?

1253
01:22:25,446 --> 01:22:28,279
If we had such
a great life together...

1254
01:22:28,349 --> 01:22:30,817
why did you want it changed?

1255
01:22:33,821 --> 01:22:37,279
I guess...

1256
01:22:37,358 --> 01:22:40,156
I just didn't know what I had.

1257
01:23:03,217 --> 01:23:05,742
You didn't have to
wait up for me.

1258
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:09,017
- Larry, who is she?
- Who's who?

1259
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:11,388
The bimbo you had dinner with.

1260
01:23:13,594 --> 01:23:16,529
Oh, her?

1261
01:23:16,597 --> 01:23:20,761
She's a, uh...

1262
01:23:20,835 --> 01:23:24,327
detective from
the police force...

1263
01:23:24,405 --> 01:23:27,272
Larry, stop lying.

1264
01:23:31,812 --> 01:23:34,280
All right.
No more lies.

1265
01:23:40,621 --> 01:23:44,284
How well do you remember 1970?

1266
01:23:44,358 --> 01:23:46,485
<i>Cindy?</i>

1267
01:23:48,596 --> 01:23:50,564
CindyJo?
Come on.

1268
01:23:50,631 --> 01:23:53,862
I swear it's the truth, honest.

1269
01:23:53,934 --> 01:23:56,368
I'm standing here
without any clo...

1270
01:23:58,572 --> 01:24:00,563
Thank you.
Could I have my shoes...

1271
01:24:02,677 --> 01:24:04,770
You're kind.
I appreciate it.

1272
01:24:04,845 --> 01:24:07,405
Could I come up and change?

1273
01:24:07,481 --> 01:24:09,415
I can change in the garage.

1274
01:24:21,295 --> 01:24:23,263
<i>Oops, I did it again.</i>

1275
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:26,925
<i>You'd think I'd get it right.</i>

1276
01:24:27,001 --> 01:24:30,869
Oh, well.
Hello?

1277
01:24:30,938 --> 01:24:32,872
Daddy?

1278
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:36,000
Larry's fallen in love
with someone else.

1279
01:24:36,077 --> 01:24:39,945
Oh, my!

1280
01:24:40,014 --> 01:24:44,383
Yes, dear, I know
I own the company, but...

1281
01:24:44,452 --> 01:24:47,888
All right, I will.
Yes, dear.

1282
01:24:47,955 --> 01:24:50,890
You take a Valium
and go to bed.

1283
01:24:50,958 --> 01:24:53,051
Okay. Good-bye.

1284
01:24:55,663 --> 01:25:00,464
Fire L.J. Burrows?
How do I fire him?

1285
01:25:02,603 --> 01:25:05,834
L.J., you're fired!

1286
01:25:05,906 --> 01:25:10,434
L.J., you are fired!

1287
01:25:10,511 --> 01:25:13,446
L.J., you rotten
son-of-a-bitch...

1288
01:25:13,514 --> 01:25:15,539
you can't do that
to my baby girl.

1289
01:25:15,616 --> 01:25:17,982
You're fired!

1290
01:25:18,052 --> 01:25:21,146
That's not bad.

1291
01:25:21,222 --> 01:25:23,156
Maybe I'll just
write him a letter...

1292
01:25:23,224 --> 01:25:26,455
and leave it in his office.
That would be better.

1293
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:33,425
"Dear L. J...

1294
01:25:33,501 --> 01:25:38,063
you rotten
son-of-a-bitch."

1295
01:25:41,108 --> 01:25:43,736
It's very simple.

1296
01:25:43,811 --> 01:25:47,269
They'll think he was in the
wrong place at the wrong time...

1297
01:25:47,348 --> 01:25:49,282
and became the poor,
innocent victim...

1298
01:25:50,818 --> 01:25:53,252
of murderous thieves.

1299
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,254
<i>The little prick!</i>

1300
01:25:55,322 --> 01:25:56,789
<i>With him out of the way...</i>

1301
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:03,153
the Nakamura deal
can proceed as planned.

1302
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:06,996
What if he doesn't show up?

1303
01:26:07,067 --> 01:26:09,126
Stop being such a geek.

1304
01:26:09,203 --> 01:26:10,932
Of course he'll show.

1305
01:26:11,005 --> 01:26:13,633
After his wife
throws him out...

1306
01:26:13,707 --> 01:26:17,074
where else would he go?

1307
01:26:23,617 --> 01:26:26,108
Where do you think
you're going, big fella?

1308
01:26:26,187 --> 01:26:28,678
Sorry, Niles.

1309
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:32,749
<i>- I can't go through with it.
- Fine.</i>

1310
01:26:32,827 --> 01:26:34,920
I don't need your help.

1311
01:26:34,995 --> 01:26:36,986
Nobody...

1312
01:26:37,064 --> 01:26:40,363
double-crosses
Niles Pender...

1313
01:26:40,434 --> 01:26:45,064
out of 120 million bucks!

1314
01:26:58,519 --> 01:27:00,578
Oh, that old saint.

1315
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:04,416
I'm not afraid of that.

1316
01:27:10,865 --> 01:27:13,333
Hope there's nobody in here.

1317
01:27:19,106 --> 01:27:21,074
<i>Shit!</i>

1318
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:39,284
Is God smiling on me...

1319
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,760
or what?

1320
01:28:21,602 --> 01:28:23,866
Oh, God.
Mr. Hansen?

1321
01:28:23,938 --> 01:28:25,701
Mr. Hansen?

1322
01:28:33,414 --> 01:28:35,541
Mr. Hansen.

1323
01:28:35,616 --> 01:28:37,914
Cover him.
He's got a weapon.

1324
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:43,923
Let's go.

1325
01:28:46,293 --> 01:28:49,456
I'm telling you, I didn't know
he was going to fire me.

1326
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:51,054
I didn't see any letter.

1327
01:28:51,131 --> 01:28:53,156
If I had, I wouldn't
have killed him.

1328
01:28:53,233 --> 01:28:55,633
Niles Pender is the one.
I'm innocent!

1329
01:28:55,703 --> 01:28:58,968
<i>Niles set this whole thing up.</i>

1330
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:01,633
<i>He's trying to
take over the company.</i>

1331
01:29:01,709 --> 01:29:03,700
<i>He killed Leo.
Leo's my friend.</i>

1332
01:29:03,777 --> 01:29:05,938
<i>I just golfed with him.
I wouldn't hurt him.</i>

1333
01:29:06,013 --> 01:29:08,948
<i>Pender was the one.</i>

1334
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:11,678
<i>Look, Officer...</i>

1335
01:29:11,752 --> 01:29:14,516
<i>I want to make a phone call.
And I need a lawyer.</i>

1336
01:29:18,459 --> 01:29:20,484
Jewel!

1337
01:29:20,561 --> 01:29:24,088
Think you can write me off
like a bad debt?

1338
01:29:26,033 --> 01:29:28,399
Time to pay up, mister.

1339
01:29:30,504 --> 01:29:32,267
Ouch, ouch!

1340
01:29:32,339 --> 01:29:34,364
Help, help!

1341
01:30:04,204 --> 01:30:07,196
Ellen!

1342
01:30:07,708 --> 01:30:10,006
Ellen!

1343
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:12,238
Ellen.

1344
01:30:16,817 --> 01:30:19,149
Larry, what is it?

1345
01:30:19,219 --> 01:30:21,585
I've got to go and
you've got to come with me.

1346
01:30:21,655 --> 01:30:23,953
Whoa, slow down.

1347
01:30:24,024 --> 01:30:26,015
What's going on?

1348
01:30:26,093 --> 01:30:29,028
Nothing. I just want
to be with you.

1349
01:30:29,096 --> 01:30:31,030
<i>Like we were before.</i>

1350
01:30:31,098 --> 01:30:33,589
I know you don't think
it will work...

1351
01:30:33,667 --> 01:30:35,931
but it will because
we've already done it.

1352
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:39,598
Are you talking about
that previous life thing?

1353
01:30:39,673 --> 01:30:41,607
Yes.

1354
01:30:41,675 --> 01:30:44,701
We'll have Thanksgiving,
and Christmas, and birthdays...

1355
01:30:44,778 --> 01:30:48,475
<i>and breakfast,
just like it was.</i>

1356
01:30:48,549 --> 01:30:50,517
I don't mean to rush,
but we've got to go.

1357
01:30:50,584 --> 01:30:52,745
Wait a minute.

1358
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:56,017
<i>It all sounds wonderful, but...</i>

1359
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:59,389
after dinner I started
thinking about things.

1360
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:02,054
About what has
real importance to me.

1361
01:31:02,129 --> 01:31:05,792
<i>Me, too, and know what?
It's us being together...</i>

1362
01:31:05,866 --> 01:31:08,994
What's the matter?

1363
01:31:09,069 --> 01:31:11,264
<i>Hello.</i>

1364
01:31:11,338 --> 01:31:14,364
Tom, this is my boss.

1365
01:31:14,441 --> 01:31:17,604
Larry, my husband, Tom.

1366
01:31:17,678 --> 01:31:20,647
Hi, Tom.

1367
01:31:20,714 --> 01:31:22,545
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Burrows.

1368
01:31:22,616 --> 01:31:24,049
Nice to meet you.

1369
01:31:24,118 --> 01:31:26,712
What's going on?

1370
01:31:26,787 --> 01:31:29,585
Nothing's going on.

1371
01:31:29,656 --> 01:31:32,682
I'm going out of town...

1372
01:31:32,759 --> 01:31:35,785
so I came to
say "so long."

1373
01:31:38,599 --> 01:31:40,533
Well...

1374
01:31:40,601 --> 01:31:42,569
so long.

1375
01:31:54,481 --> 01:31:56,449
I've got to tell him one thing.

1376
01:31:58,619 --> 01:32:00,553
Larry?

1377
01:32:08,862 --> 01:32:11,763
I was wrong about you.

1378
01:32:11,832 --> 01:32:14,232
I think you are
a wonderful man.

1379
01:32:14,301 --> 01:32:17,862
I wish it could have been
different between us.

1380
01:32:17,938 --> 01:32:21,567
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

1381
01:32:21,642 --> 01:32:23,906
Sorry.

1382
01:32:50,737 --> 01:32:53,205
Wait a minute.

1383
01:32:53,273 --> 01:32:56,242
That's bullshit!
It was meant to be!

1384
01:33:42,756 --> 01:33:43,814
Jesus!

1385
01:34:20,427 --> 01:34:22,452
Oh, no.

1386
01:34:29,303 --> 01:34:33,034
Oh, no, not Sammy.

1387
01:34:33,106 --> 01:34:36,803
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

1388
01:34:36,877 --> 01:34:39,368
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

1389
01:34:47,154 --> 01:34:49,622
I'm sorry.

1390
01:35:25,292 --> 01:35:28,693
I give up.

1391
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:42,701
Oh, my God!

1392
01:35:42,776 --> 01:35:44,641
Mike!

1393
01:35:47,247 --> 01:35:48,942
Mike?

1394
01:35:49,015 --> 01:35:51,279
<i>Where are you?</i>

1395
01:35:51,351 --> 01:35:53,285
Mike, I need you.

1396
01:36:12,706 --> 01:36:15,698
Disgusting.

1397
01:36:34,594 --> 01:36:37,062
Okay.

1398
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:38,893
I'm coming.

1399
01:36:38,965 --> 01:36:41,798
Don't shoot.
I'm not armed.

1400
01:36:46,373 --> 01:36:49,240
Somebody here
call for a tow truck?

1401
01:36:49,309 --> 01:36:51,243
Tow truck?

1402
01:36:55,582 --> 01:36:57,573
You all right?

1403
01:36:57,651 --> 01:37:00,313
I'm back.

1404
01:37:00,387 --> 01:37:02,378
Son-of-a-bitch,
I'm back!

1405
01:37:02,456 --> 01:37:04,549
<i>Back from where?</i>

1406
01:37:04,624 --> 01:37:06,455
You've been here
the whole time.

1407
01:37:10,597 --> 01:37:12,565
I'm really back!

1408
01:37:12,632 --> 01:37:15,430
You've always been here.

1409
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:20,496
Sure I have,
you old destiny-bender.

1410
01:37:23,443 --> 01:37:26,173
I love this guy.
He's great.

1411
01:37:26,246 --> 01:37:28,510
I just love this guy!

1412
01:37:31,618 --> 01:37:32,118
Thanks.

1413
01:37:35,989 --> 01:37:38,048
Thanks for everything.

1414
01:37:38,124 --> 01:37:41,651
The good and the bad.

1415
01:37:44,564 --> 01:37:48,227
You sure know how
to make a point.

1416
01:37:52,005 --> 01:37:55,702
Whatever you've got planned
for the rest of my life...

1417
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:59,542
it's perfect.

1418
01:37:59,613 --> 01:38:03,572
Happy birthday, Larry.

1419
01:38:03,650 --> 01:38:06,278
Thanks, Mike.

1420
01:38:11,491 --> 01:38:14,289
Haven't seen you before.
You the new guy?

1421
01:38:14,361 --> 01:38:16,556
What's your name?

1422
01:38:16,630 --> 01:38:18,598
Duncan.

1423
01:38:18,665 --> 01:38:22,533
You're going to be familiar
with me and this piece of...

1424
01:38:24,170 --> 01:38:27,196
Nakamura's going to sign the
deal at 8:00, in 10 minutes.

1425
01:38:27,274 --> 01:38:28,707
Give me a ride!

1426
01:38:28,775 --> 01:38:31,710
- I've got to hook up the car.
- Forget it!

1427
01:38:44,024 --> 01:38:46,458
And therefore, gentlemen...

1428
01:38:46,526 --> 01:38:48,926
it's our recommendation
to accept Nakamura's...

1429
01:38:48,995 --> 01:38:52,863
generous, creative
buy-out offer...

1430
01:38:52,933 --> 01:38:56,096
of $35 a share.

1431
01:38:56,169 --> 01:38:58,763
Just sign here,
Mr. Hansen.

1432
01:39:05,111 --> 01:39:08,137
You really think
this is a good idea?

1433
01:39:08,214 --> 01:39:10,546
Without question.

1434
01:39:22,195 --> 01:39:24,322
What do you think you're doing?

1435
01:39:28,068 --> 01:39:31,401
Sorry, Jackie.
Sorry, Mr. Hansen.

1436
01:39:31,471 --> 01:39:33,769
I'm tired of assholes
getting ahead...

1437
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,967
while decent people
get the shaft.

1438
01:39:36,042 --> 01:39:38,101
What's this all about?

1439
01:39:38,178 --> 01:39:39,736
Niles and Lewis...

1440
01:39:39,813 --> 01:39:42,475
<i>are buying company stock
through a dummy corporation...</i>

1441
01:39:42,549 --> 01:39:45,882
while encouraging the board
to sell out to Nakamura.

1442
01:39:48,388 --> 01:39:50,413
Right here.

1443
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:53,687
The one with all the mud
in the driveway.

1444
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:57,025
- Thanks for the lift.
- No problem.

1445
01:39:57,097 --> 01:39:58,291
I'll get your car.

1446
01:39:58,365 --> 01:40:01,459
What do you want me
to do with it?

1447
01:40:01,534 --> 01:40:04,526
Keep it.
I'm going to buy a new one.

1448
01:40:04,604 --> 01:40:08,062
I'll figure out how
to pay for it later.

1449
01:40:08,141 --> 01:40:09,938
Take care.

1450
01:40:15,915 --> 01:40:18,383
<i>Damn, I forgot.</i>

1451
01:40:18,451 --> 01:40:21,420
Ellen's at the strike meeting.

1452
01:40:30,263 --> 01:40:31,787
Surprise!

1453
01:40:33,733 --> 01:40:35,223
Ellen!

1454
01:40:37,337 --> 01:40:39,134
Happy 35th!

1455
01:40:39,205 --> 01:40:41,002
Look at all of you!

1456
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:46,304
Clip! Dad!

1457
01:40:46,379 --> 01:40:48,973
I've missed all you guys
so much!

1458
01:40:49,049 --> 01:40:52,382
You have?

1459
01:40:52,452 --> 01:40:54,682
I'd forgotten
how beautiful you are.

1460
01:41:01,695 --> 01:41:03,720
Wait until I tell you
what happened.

1461
01:41:03,797 --> 01:41:05,788
You're not going to believe it.

1462
01:41:05,865 --> 01:41:08,060
Clip told us.
It's okay, we'll manage.

1463
01:41:08,134 --> 01:41:10,068
- I'll work overtime...
- Not that.

1464
01:41:10,136 --> 01:41:12,832
I can get a new job anywhere.

1465
01:41:12,906 --> 01:41:16,740
I'm just so glad
to see everyone.

1466
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:19,472
Sammy!
Where's Sammy?

1467
01:41:19,546 --> 01:41:21,377
<i>Sammy!</i>

1468
01:41:21,448 --> 01:41:23,973
Oh, Sammy!

1469
01:41:24,050 --> 01:41:26,541
I love you, too, baby.

1470
01:41:28,722 --> 01:41:31,156
We'll go driving all weekend.

1471
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:36,356
Were you really surprised?

1472
01:41:36,429 --> 01:41:38,454
This whole day
has been surprising.

1473
01:41:38,531 --> 01:41:42,433
- Hungry?
- No, but I'd love coffee.

1474
01:41:42,502 --> 01:41:46,131
I forgot to buy any.
I'll get some tomorrow.

1475
01:41:49,242 --> 01:41:50,766
Clip!

1476
01:41:50,844 --> 01:41:53,074
Did I miss you!

1477
01:41:53,146 --> 01:41:55,239
You look so...

1478
01:41:55,315 --> 01:41:59,308
- So...
- Hot? Thank you.

1479
01:41:59,385 --> 01:42:01,046
Happy 35th, buddy.

1480
01:42:01,121 --> 01:42:04,750
- Clip.
- This is your real present.

1481
01:42:04,824 --> 01:42:07,816
I gave you the vomit
to throw you off.

1482
01:42:07,894 --> 01:42:09,486
It worked.

1483
01:42:09,562 --> 01:42:11,496
Like a charm.

1484
01:42:11,564 --> 01:42:13,555
<i>It's a Mercedes.
Like it?</i>

1485
01:42:13,633 --> 01:42:17,899
Clip, I love it.

1486
01:42:17,971 --> 01:42:21,463
I've always wanted
one of these.

1487
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:23,532
Thanks.

1488
01:42:23,610 --> 01:42:25,271
Hey.

1489
01:42:25,345 --> 01:42:27,939
Check out my date.

1490
01:42:28,014 --> 01:42:30,642
<i>Is she a killer, or what?</i>

1491
01:42:30,717 --> 01:42:34,414
Definitely a killer.

1492
01:42:34,487 --> 01:42:36,011
Yeah.

1493
01:42:38,691 --> 01:42:41,558
<i>- Hi.</i>

1494
01:42:43,696 --> 01:42:46,028
<i>I'll have a light beer.</i>

1495
01:42:46,099 --> 01:42:49,227
<i>- Jackie, CindyJo!
- We don't want to interrupt.</i>

1496
01:42:49,302 --> 01:42:53,170
- Come in, please.
- This will just take a minute.

1497
01:42:53,239 --> 01:42:57,835
- What's up?
- Niles and Lewis
confessed to everything.

1498
01:42:57,911 --> 01:43:00,277
That was a real touchdown.

1499
01:43:00,346 --> 01:43:02,746
We just dropped by
to say thanks.

1500
01:43:02,816 --> 01:43:05,478
You ran out so fast...

1501
01:43:05,552 --> 01:43:07,816
I had to get home.
It's my birthday.

1502
01:43:07,887 --> 01:43:10,048
I've got a little
present for you.

1503
01:43:10,123 --> 01:43:14,287
The board voted to offer
you Niles' job...

1504
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,726
executive
vice-president.

1505
01:43:19,566 --> 01:43:23,229
I don't know.

1506
01:43:23,303 --> 01:43:25,328
So much has happened today.

1507
01:43:25,405 --> 01:43:27,373
I'll think about it.

1508
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,271
$125,000 to start,
and a Mercedes.

1509
01:43:29,342 --> 01:43:31,708
- Thought's over.
- Wonderful!

1510
01:43:31,778 --> 01:43:33,211
That's great!
Thank you.

1511
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:35,110
Hungry or thirsty?

1512
01:43:35,181 --> 01:43:37,775
Time out.

1513
01:43:37,851 --> 01:43:39,944
Hi, Larry.

1514
01:43:40,019 --> 01:43:43,079
Hi, CindyJo.

1515
01:43:43,156 --> 01:43:46,614
If I'd known about your birthday
I'd have gotten you something.

1516
01:43:48,228 --> 01:43:50,025
Well, CindyJo...

1517
01:43:50,096 --> 01:43:52,087
you've already given me...

1518
01:43:52,165 --> 01:43:55,032
more than you could
possibly know, really.

1519
01:43:55,101 --> 01:43:57,092
Happy birthday.

1520
01:43:57,170 --> 01:43:58,831
Thanks.

1521
01:44:08,948 --> 01:44:11,212
<i>Well, that's it.</i>

1522
01:44:11,284 --> 01:44:13,445
<i>That was my 35th birthday.</i>

1523
01:44:13,519 --> 01:44:15,714
<i>I told you it was weird.</i>

1524
01:44:15,788 --> 01:44:18,689
<i>It's so weird, I probably
shouldn't talk about it.</i>

1525
01:44:18,758 --> 01:44:20,953
<i>I mean, who'd believe me?</i>

1526
01:44:21,027 --> 01:44:23,894
<i>I'm not sure
I believe it myself.</i>

1527
01:44:31,537 --> 01:44:32,663
Way to go, Burrows!

1528
01:44:48,254 --> 01:44:50,484
<i>Saw the game, kid.</i>

1529
01:44:52,525 --> 01:44:54,459
Tough break.

1530
01:44:54,527 --> 01:44:57,462
You said it, mister.

1531
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:59,327
I blew it good.

1532
01:44:59,399 --> 01:45:01,367
Don't worry too much about it.

1533
01:45:01,434 --> 01:45:02,867
Remember...

1534
01:45:02,936 --> 01:45:05,427
you've got your whole life
to look forward to.

1535
01:45:05,505 --> 01:45:09,703
Things will work out just fine.

1536
01:45:09,776 --> 01:45:12,506
Trust me.

1537
01:45:20,753 --> 01:45:22,687
Old fart.

1538
01:45:22,755 --> 01:45:24,746
