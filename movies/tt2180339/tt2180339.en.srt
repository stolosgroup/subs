I wanted to say, you're a brick

164
00:12:19,825 --> 00:12:22,533
for how nice you are
about me seeing your wife.

165
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,658
Seeing my wife.

166
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,950
It's good to have a friend.

167
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
I mean, it's all innocent, of course,
you know,

168
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:39,200
but some guys, some husbands,

169
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,533
- they get a little…
- Yeah, jealous.

170
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:43,408
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

171
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:47,241
Have you been around here long enough
where you've heard the name Martin McRae?

172
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:50,575
Uh, the guy…
yeah, the guy who's gone missing.

173
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:52,908
He saw a lot of my wife.

174
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,658
What does that mean?

175
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:59,408
He started seeing a lot of my wife.

176
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,241
You suggesting…?

177
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:07,075
They were friends.

178
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:13,491
You want me to believe
you did something to Martin McRae?

179
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,366
I killed him.

180
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,033
Does Melinda know?

181
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:25,533
Oh, God, no.

182
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:27,283
She'd be horrified.

183
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:31,700
All right, bro,

184
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:33,158
considering he was a friend of yours,

185
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:35,616
I don't think it's very funny
to joke about...

186
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,908
He wasn't a friend of mine.

187
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:39,408
A friend of your wife's.

188
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:40,741
Well...

189
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:43,075
that's obviously something different,
isn't it?

190
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,033
Are you, like, threatening me?

191
00:13:48,116 --> 00:13:50,491
Do you feel threatened?

192
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:55,158
I don't believe you.

193
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:57,533
Then don't.

194
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:09,741
I'll be right back.

195
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:10,866
Joel?

196
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:16,283
I'm going home.

197
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:17,825
- What?
- I'll call you tomorrow.

198
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:19,241
What happened?

199
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,825
♪ But I'm not the guy you're taking home ♪

200
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:23,991
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪

201
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:28,075
♪ I keep dancing on my own ♪

202
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,950
♪ I keep dancing on... ♪

203
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:41,241
What did you say to Joel?

204
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:42,741
Nothing.

205
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,241
You must've said something.

206
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:50,741
No.

207
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:52,200
I didn't say anything.

208
00:14:55,783 --> 00:14:58,908
Well, I saw you talking.

209
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:00,450
What were you talking about?

210
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,533
Bedbugs, maybe? No, that was Mary.

211
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:07,491
You're so weird.

212
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,283
Would you like to get in the car?

213
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:21,033
You must've said something...

214
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:24,033
'cause he was different
after he talked to you.

215
00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:28,408
I promise you, I didn't.

216
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:32,783
I don't believe you.

217
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:10,366
So, uh...

218
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,366
- five hours, right?
- Yeah.

219
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,200
- That's a hundred.
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:16,658
- Venmo. I-I'll give you 200. How's that?
- Oh, sure.

221
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:18,241
Melinda, what are you doing?

222
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:20,950
- I'm gonna make coffee.
- I'll make you coffee.

223
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:22,241
Go to bed. You're drunk.

224
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:25,241
- I can do it.
- No, it's fine. I...

225
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:28,283
Melinda… you're naked.

226
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:29,366
What are you doing?

227
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,908
- What?
- The babysitter's standing right there.

228
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:34,950
The babysitter.

229
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,033
So what?

230
00:16:36,116 --> 00:16:38,533
- It's not appropriate.
- Jesus Christ.

231
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:41,325
America is so suffocating.

232
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:44,116
Sorry about that.

233
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,116
- My wife's... a whole nother culture.
- Yeah, it's okay.

234
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:53,991
Thank you.

235
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,158
I wish you'd pick someone
with some more brains.

236
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,950
Is that what interests you in a woman?

237
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:08,450
Her intelligence?

238
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:11,700
That's one of the things, yes.

239
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:13,783
Is that why you picked me?

240
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,450
For my brains?

241
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,616
You're very smart, Melinda.

242
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,991
Yeah.

243
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,991
Not in a way you respect.

244
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:35,075
Joel might be dumb,
but me makes me enjoy who I am.

245
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:38,700
And that turns me on.

246
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:49,866
Vic.

247
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,700
Close the door on your way out.

248
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,783
Thank you.

249
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:09,866
Stick with it, Trix.

250
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,325
Did you know I had it on there wrong?

251
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,325
Were you going to tell me?

252
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:32,158
I didn't need to tell you, did I?

253
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:36,366
In no time, you'll be like your dad,

254
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,283
building bombs.

255
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:40,241
Hmm.

256
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:41,533
Dad doesn't build bombs.

257
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:44,325
He made a computer chip.

Yes.

268
00:20:24,158 --> 00:20:26,075
- Does that mean violin?
- Yes.

269
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,575
- Will that be fun?
- Yes.

270
00:20:27,658 --> 00:20:28,741
Okay.

271
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:31,033
Have a good day. I love you!

272
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:33,116
Love you!

273
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:37,200
Your mom is gonna get you
after school, all right?

274
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:38,866
I'm coming!

275
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,575
Vic!

276
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:45,616
Vic!

277
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:48,991
What?

278
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:51,116
You're running around murdering people

279
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,700
and you don't call me
to help cover up the crime scene?

280
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:55,241
- It was a joke.
- Yeah.

281
00:20:55,325 --> 00:20:56,908
I should fucking hope so.

282
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,075
How'd you hear about it?

283
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,075
I've heard about it
from so many people now,

284
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:03,075
I honest to God don't remember
who told me first.

285
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:04,700
Jesus Christ.

286
00:21:05,991 --> 00:21:08,283
But, boy, did it work.

287
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:16,533
- Thanks.
- I don't think I would

288
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:18,908
kill somebody for sleeping with my wife.

289
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:21,408
Who says they slept together?

290
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:25,866
Vic, I don't mean to be
the bearer of bad news, but...

291
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,741
it's pretty obvious.

292
00:21:28,825 --> 00:21:31,158
Isn't that why you threatened him?

293
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:32,950
I didn't threaten anybody.

294
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,241
Okay, look, man, I-I don't know, man.

295
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:37,825
Look, coming from somebody
who loves and respects you,

296
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:39,741
you gotta reign Melinda in, man.

297
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:41,491
Like, this isn't the first time.

298
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:42,950
The fact she's comfortable, like,

299
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,908
flaunting all these relationships
around in front of us,

300
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:46,283
is fucked up.

301
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:48,075
Yes, she's a fucked up person.

302
00:21:48,158 --> 00:21:50,658
I knew it. I knew it since the moment
I saw Joel leave

303
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:54,283
that you had done something disgusting
'cause you're a fucking snake.

304
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:57,783
It was stupid.

305
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:59,658
Fucking stupid.

306
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:03,200
And Martin was my friend...
and I miss him.

307
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,825
That is…

308
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:10,366
That's not something you joke about.

309
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:15,533
It was a bad idea and I knew it
right when it came out of my mouth.

310
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:17,241
- You...
- I'm really sorry.

311
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:19,158
You are not just going to apologize to me.

312
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:21,033
You're going to apologize to Joel.

313
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:22,866
I already spoke to him.

314
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,241
He's leaving on Saturday,

315
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:26,825
so I invited him over for dinner
on Friday.

316
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,825
Joel, good to see you.

317
00:22:36,908 --> 00:22:38,158
Dinner's almost ready.

318
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:39,450
Melinda wanted to cook,

319
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,783
but, uh, Trixie banned her from the stove
for two weeks.

320
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:44,116
It's a long story.

321
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,075
Is Melinda here?

322
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,241
Melinda? No.

323
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:51,116
Just you and me.

324
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:55,283
Why, is that awkward?

325
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,366
I'm just fucking with you.

326
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,075
Yeah, come on in.

327
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,366
So, uh, come on in.

328
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,700
Get you a drink?

329
00:23:07,783 --> 00:23:09,408
Vodka soda?

330
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:10,783
- Uh, yeah.
- Make yourself at home.

331
00:23:10,866 --> 00:23:12,658
Have a seat.

332
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:14,075
Thanks.

333
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,575
Who's that?

334
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:22,741
That is Joel Dash.

335
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:24,033
He's a friend of your mom's.

336
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:25,741
Kind of like Martin McRae.

337
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:28,783
Remember him?

338
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:35,783
Dry your hands and take this out to Joel.

339
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:38,783
Thank you.

340
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:41,908
No lime, right?

341
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:44,700
Uh, no lime for me, thanks.

342
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:48,366
Thank you.

343
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:52,575
So, you're leaving tomorrow?

344
00:23:52,658 --> 00:23:53,908
Uh, yeah.

345
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:56,658
You know, I got a job in New Mexico.

346
00:23:56,741 --> 00:23:58,241
It's a good one.

347
00:23:58,325 --> 00:23:59,325
Pays well.

348
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:01,575
Pretty exciting.

349
00:24:01,658 --> 00:24:03,366
Sounds it.

350
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,616
Well, Last Supper it is.

351
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,033
Making an old family recipe,
lobster bisque.

352
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:09,783
Hint of tang, not too creamy.

353
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,575
I think you're gonna love it.

354
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,033
I'm actually allergic to shellfish.

355
00:24:14,116 --> 00:24:15,658
What?

356
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:17,408
- Yeah, I can't eat it.
- You're kidding me.

357
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:18,991
All… any shellfish?

358
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:21,783
No.

359
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:24,200
I've always wanted to visit New Mexico.

360
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:25,866
Yeah.

361
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,366
I mean, I'm going to be working
in Albuquerque,

362
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,033
- which is a little bit different from Santa Fe.
- Hmm.

363
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:34,450
Santa Fe is probably
more charming, I think.

364
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:36,200
I definitely want to visit Santa Fe

365
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:38,116
'cause I heard the same thing,
it's beautiful.

366
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,366
Yeah.

367
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,033
Well, maybe we'll come visit.

368
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:48,450
Uh, yeah, I mean, I-I don't know
how big my place is going to be, so...

369
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:50,700
Joel, I think if we came and visited,

370
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:53,200
we'd probably stay in a hotel.

371
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:55,991
Oh, right, right.

372
00:24:56,783 --> 00:24:58,741
How's the grilled cheese?

373
00:24:58,825 --> 00:25:00,533
Actually, it's amazing.

374
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:01,950
- Oh, good.
- Can I have some?

375
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,783
- Yeah.
- A bite?

376
00:25:03,866 --> 00:25:05,700
I don't like lobster bisque.

377
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:11,491
Oh, my God.

378
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:13,408
Right?

379
00:25:14,491 --> 00:25:16,200
This is amazing.

380
00:25:16,283 --> 00:25:18,283
Melinda kind of has the palate
of a 12-year-old.

381
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:20,658
Our first date, I took her
to the best restaurant in the city

382
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:22,283
- and she ordered mac and cheese.
- Yeah.

383
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:25,950
It's like he was ashamed to be with me.

384
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:28,741
No, I just realized you were ordering
off the children's menu

385
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,950
to save room for alcohol.

386
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,241
You see, Vic never drinks.

387
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:40,033
I drink sometimes.

388
00:25:41,325 --> 00:25:43,950
Sometimes I think he's not normal.

389
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:47,825
'Cause normal people can let go.

390
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:51,283
You wish that I were normal, Melinda?

391
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:53,783
- My God, all the time.
- 'Cause if I were normal,

392
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:56,950
I don't think Joel would be over here
having dinner with us.

393
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,658
You don't have to be rude.

394
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:05,116
I'm not being rude.

395
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,575
I made lobster bisque.

396
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:10,783
Um...

397
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,033
If you guys don't mind,
I'm gonna run to the restroom.

398
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,075
Good call.

399
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:25,408
Trixie.

400
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:28,366
Baby, I think it's time for bed.

401
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,033
Okay.

402
00:26:30,116 --> 00:26:32,533
Did you finish that, baby?

403
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:36,200
You know, your dad is gonna read you
a bunch of bedtime stories.

404
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:38,116
Wouldn't you like that?

405
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,283
Yeah.

406
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:42,741
- Okay?
- Okay.

407
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:45,241
Can you come give your mama a kiss?

408
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:47,616
Mmm.

409
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,533
Don't let him skip pages.

410
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:51,533
He can be sneaky like that.

411
00:26:52,908 --> 00:26:54,783
Good night.

412
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:59,241
"Bedtime Olie is sleeping now
without a care.

413
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:01,950
The end. Zzz…"

414
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:06,950
Why is Mom so different
around other people?

415
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:09,866
You think Mom's different?

416
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,325
Yeah. Don't you?

417
00:27:12,408 --> 00:27:14,325
I think that's just who she is.

418
00:27:14,408 --> 00:27:16,991
But how can it be who she is
if she's different?

419
00:27:17,075 --> 00:27:20,616
Mm, because people are strange
and grown-ups are complex.

420
00:27:23,658 --> 00:27:25,783
I don't like Joel.

421
00:27:25,866 --> 00:27:28,325

I mean, don't you want to apologize?

453
00:29:56,616 --> 00:29:58,450
Why would I do that?

454
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:01,200
Because you said you killed Martin McRae.

455
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:04,075
I can't apologize for that, Joel.

456
00:30:04,158 --> 00:30:06,658
I did kill Martin McRae.

457
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:09,033
I hit him with a hammer.

458
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:12,700
Oh.

459
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:13,908

So, you're a writer. What do you write?

466
00:30:38,866 --> 00:30:42,908
Uh, short stories mostly,
but, uh, screenplays as well.

467
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:44,575
- Oh.
- You write movies?

468
00:30:44,658 --> 00:30:46,658
Well, I've sold a couple of scripts,

469
00:30:46,741 --> 00:30:48,575
one that may actually get made.

470
00:30:48,658 --> 00:30:51,366
Hollywood, you know,
they develop stuff for years and years.

471
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,825
What's it about?

472
00:30:52,908 --> 00:30:54,825
Myself, mainly.

473
00:30:54,908 --> 00:30:57,450
It's a movie about you?

474
00:30:57,533 --> 00:30:58,866
Yeah, it's loosely based on me.

475
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,450
It's about a writer.

476
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:04,033
Uh, you know, a young guy,
uh, writes noir fiction

477
00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:09,158
and, uh, he uncovers
a vast conspiracy in his town.

478
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:10,783
Uh, it… I think it's interesting.

479
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:14,116
It's got a fresh tone.

480
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,950
So, uh, what do you do?

481
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:17,658
Uh, not much.

482
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:18,950
A lot of, you know, small things.

483
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:21,033
I, uh, build web apps.

484

00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:38,783
From what?

493
00:31:38,866 --> 00:31:42,658
He built the chip for drones that
help them find the people they blow up.

494
00:31:42,741 --> 00:31:44,325
Right?

495
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:45,908
Wow.

496
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:48,700
Drone warfare. That's…

497
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:51,450
That's kind of a moral gray area,
isn't it?

498
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:53,241
Well, not if you're just making the chip.

499
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:54,616
Don, let's not get into politics.

500
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,366
Yeah, but the-the chip is used
to kill people.

501
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,491
Eh, sometimes used
to kill innocent people.

502
00:32:00,575 --> 00:32:03,325
Or used to find starving children

503
00:32:03,408 --> 00:32:05,325
and drop food off to them.

504
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:06,491
Yeah.

505
00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:09,158
But they don't.

506
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:10,908
No. They don't.

507
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:13,283
Look, but the moral of the story is,

508
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:15,825
Vic is a genius and he's rich as fuck.

509
00:32:17,908 --> 00:32:19,200
Vic?

510
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:20,658
Vic Van Allen?

511
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:22,908
- Yeah.
- Oh. Okay.

512
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:26,283
- Yeah, I know exactly who you are.
- Oh.

513
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:28,658
You killed Martin McRae.

514
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:31,158
- Oh, my God. It's a joke.
- Oh, come on.

515
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,658
It was a joke.

516
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:34,283
Really?

517
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:36,241
Funny.

518
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,366
Your wife is so beautiful.

519
00:32:49,241 --> 00:32:51,075
Do you like to dance?

520
00:32:51,158 --> 00:32:53,033
I love to dance.

521
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:54,491
Really?

522
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:56,825
Let's dance.

523
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,450
Okay.

524
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,116
You ever seen Vic dance before? Ever?

525
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,491
No, I didn't know he can dance.

526
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:17,533
- Did you know he could dance?
- No.

527
00:33:17,616 --> 00:33:19,116
- Is that Vic dancing?
- Seriously.

528
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,325
Um… yes.

529
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:23,950
I didn't know he could dance.

530
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,325
- Oh.
- Don't be mean. He loves...

531
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:28,908
He loves dancing.

532
00:33:28,991 --> 00:33:32,241
- That's so surprising.
- Yeah.

533
00:33:33,866 --> 00:33:37,116
Wow, they're just gonna get dizzy.

534
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,658
- Oh, oh, oh. Okay.
- Oh, oh. Oh, hey.

535
00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:41,533
Oh, he even gave her a dip.

536
00:33:41,616 --> 00:33:44,033
Oh, boy. Oh, damn.

537
00:33:44,116 --> 00:33:45,658
- I hope his knee don't give out.
- I know...

538
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:47,366
You know he got a bad knee.

539
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,825
You looked like you were having fun
dancing with Kelly Wilson.

540
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,908
Yeah. It was fun.

541
00:33:59,908 --> 00:34:02,533
She's very attractive, don't you think?

542
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,366
Yeah, I guess so.

543
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:18,491
You want to fuck her?

544
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,616
That wasn't the first thing
that crossed my mind, no.

545
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:28,033
But it did cross your mind.

546
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:32,991
I mean...

547
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:35,200
like, yes, at a certain point, you think,

548
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:39,325
well, I guess I could, you know,
fuck this person.

549
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,950
But...

550
00:35:04,825 --> 00:35:07,450
Do you think she'd be a better fuck
than me?

551
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:15,991
Ow! What was that for?

552
00:35:16,075 --> 00:35:17,533
'Cause the answer was yes.

553
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,783
No, it wasn't.

554
00:35:21,408 --> 00:35:23,241
Ow! Fuck, Melinda.

555
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:24,866
You're gonna get us killed.

556
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:28,616
Well, if you think Kelly Wilson
is a better fuck than me,

557
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,408
then I don't mind killing us both.

558
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:32,366
I didn't say that.

559
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:35,116
But you thought it.

560
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:46,200
Don't touch me.

561
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:53,825
- You kiss my ass.
- Yeah.

562
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:56,116
Yes.

563
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,616
Do you want to fuck me?

564
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,366
Yes.

565
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,908
Oh, come here.

566
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,991
Get in there, Trix.

567
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:17,741
Go, Trixie.

568
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:19,825
Go, go, go, go.

569
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:23,700
Shit.

570
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:28,075
I'm telling you, the other team's
at least 12 years old.

571
00:36:29,658 --> 00:36:31,283
They don't look 12 years old.

572
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:32,700
They fucking look 12 years old.

573
00:36:32,783 --> 00:36:34,158
Stop it.

574
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:37,366
Yay, Trixie!

575
00:36:38,241 --> 00:36:39,366
Hello?

576
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,658
Hi. Is this Mr. Van Allen?

577
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:41,783
Yeah.

578
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,241
This is Rick from Whitmore Bank
calling about Melinda Van Allen's account.

579
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:46,866
Yes.

580
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,158
There were insufficient funds to cover
the check that was issued last Thursday.

581
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,658
How old are you?

582
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:53,783
Okay, who was it drawn to?

583
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:57,575
To a Mr. Charles De Lisle.

584
00:36:57,658 --> 00:36:58,908
What was the amount?

585
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:01,366
It was $3,000.

586
00:37:03,116 --> 00:37:05,158
Does it say what it was for?

587
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:09,116
The memo line says, "Piano lessons."

588
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,366
Right.

589
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,575
It makes perfect sense.

590
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:15,575
If you add additional funds
to the account,

591
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:18,200
we can waive the $50 overdraft fee.

592
00:37:18,283 --> 00:37:20,283
Thank you. I would appreciate that.

593
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:21,866
No problem, sir.

594
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,866
Could you spell the recipient's
last name, please?

595
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:38,575
<i>Hi. Yeah, I'm just wondering, uh,</i>

596
00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:42,325
do you guys have live music
in the evenings, by any chance?

597
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:44,825
You don't.

598
00:37:44,908 --> 00:37:46,116
All right, that's a shame.

599
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,450
Hi. Yeah, I'm wondering, do you guys have
live music in the evenings?

600
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:53,283
Hey, is this the Oak Tree Lounge?

601
00:37:53,366 --> 00:37:56,741
Yeah, I'm calling to see if you guys
have live music.

602
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:58,950
You do.

603
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:01,366
What's his name?

604
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:47,575
♪ That's why the lady is a tramp. ♪

605
00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:50,158
No.

606
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,200
Dad!

607
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:09,616
Chelsea's teaching me how to play poker.

608
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:13,366
Good. That'll come in handy.

609
00:39:15,325 --> 00:39:18,991
In national news,
Congress has voted to allocate more funds

610
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:20,950
to the military's drone program.

611
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:23,491
The motion aims to not only
expand the program

612
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:27,491
but also to include and refine
the current targeting system.

613
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,991
The vote comes in the wake
of a successful strike

614
00:39:30,075 --> 00:39:34,283
on an ISIS weapons storehouse
just outside of Kabul this past Thursday.

615
00:39:34,366 --> 00:39:39,116
Now, opponents of the bill warned this
news will only increase tensions overseas.

616
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
And in breaking news,

617
00:39:41,283 --> 00:39:43,908
police have found the body
of Martin McRae,

618
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:47,366
the 33-year-old man who went missing
from his apartment last spring.

619
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:50,408
McRae's body was found in the woods
in La Bouche Parish.

620
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:51,991
He had been shot to death.

621
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:54,450
Stay tuned for your latest in weather
coming up after the break.

622
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:16,408
How was your night?

623
00:40:17,825 --> 00:40:19,741
Magnificent.

624
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:24,866
Where'd you go?

625
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,075
To have dinner with a new friend.

626
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,200
I think you're going to like him.

627
00:40:33,366 --> 00:40:35,075
And then...

628
00:40:36,283 --> 00:40:41,491
I don't remember what we did,
but it was really awesome.

629
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:49,325
And I think I drank a lot,
so don't be angry.

630
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,825
I see.

631
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:56,075
Let me help you.

632
00:40:56,158 --> 00:40:57,408
Come on.

633
00:40:57,491 --> 00:40:59,075
Come on.

634
00:41:00,616 --> 00:41:02,741
Melinda…

635
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:05,325
Sweetie, I have to tell you something.

636
00:41:05,408 --> 00:41:07,741
Ooh-ooh.

637
00:41:07,825 --> 00:41:10,158
What did I do?

638
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:14,366
They found Martin McRae.

639
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,825
He's dead.

640
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:23,741
I'm sorry.

641
00:41:29,491 --> 00:41:31,658
Are you?

642
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:49,241
- Dad?
- Mm-hmm?

643
00:41:49,325 --> 00:41:51,158
Can we call him Roger?

644
00:41:51,241 --> 00:41:53,408
You can try.

645
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,366
- Look after her.
- Oh.

646
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,783
Ready?

647
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:04,658
Careful.

648
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:06,408
You got him? Okay?

649
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,950
Huh?

650
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:10,075
Thanks a lot.

651
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:14,658
Dad, I think he smells like poop.

652
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:19,075
- Dad?
- Mm-hmm?

653
00:42:19,158 --> 00:42:21,991
Do you think Mom's okay?

654
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:23,241
Yeah.

655
00:42:23,325 --> 00:42:28,533
She may be a little sad about her friend,
but she's okay.

656
00:42:28,616 --> 00:42:30,491

put to rest all the talk, you know.

672
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,075
What talk? I didn't hear any talk.

673
00:43:17,158 --> 00:43:19,658
Oh, there's definitely been talk.

674
00:43:19,741 --> 00:43:21,491
Thank you.

675
00:43:28,533 --> 00:43:30,283
Hey, nice work. You sound great.

676
00:43:31,366 --> 00:43:32,408
Thank you.

677
00:43:33,575 --> 00:43:35,283
That dude can play the keys.

678
00:43:35,366 --> 00:43:36,950
Yeah. He's been giving Melinda lessons.

679
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,700
Oh, he's been giving Melinda lessons.

680
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:45,408
Yeah.

681
00:45:48,283 --> 00:45:50,325
Where's Trixie?

682
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,866
I took her to Janey's.

683
00:45:57,825 --> 00:46:00,616
Is there any coffee?

684
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,741
You want to tell me
why you didn't come home last night?

685
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:10,366
Not really.

686
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:16,241
You want to tell me why you cut a check
for $3,000 to Charles De Lisle?

687
00:46:17,825 --> 00:46:20,450
Not really.

688
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:23,616
Okay.

689
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,700
You want to tell me
what the fuck you're doing?

690
00:46:29,866 --> 00:46:32,741
Finally some emotion.

691
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:37,116
You're drunk.
You have no idea how unattractive it is.

692
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,616
- Really?
- Yeah.

693
00:46:39,741 --> 00:46:41,991
Well, I think you're jealous.

694
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:43,825
I think you're acting like a child.

695
00:46:43,908 --> 00:46:45,158
Don't you find that appealing?

696
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:46,491
No, not at all.

697
00:46:46,575 --> 00:46:48,658
Then why are you waiting up all night
like a parent?

698
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,075
Is that what I'm doing?

699
00:46:53,158 --> 00:46:54,616
What do you want to know?

700
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:58,241
Where I was?

701
00:46:59,325 --> 00:47:01,200
What I did?

702
00:47:01,283 --> 00:47:03,616
Because I'll tell you everything.

703
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,658
I'm not interested in the details,
Melinda.

704
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:07,700
Well, now you're really full of shit.

705
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,283
Really?

706
00:47:11,366 --> 00:47:14,116
You want to know if I'm fucking him?

707
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,866
Ask me.

708
00:47:18,116 --> 00:47:20,825
You want to know if he makes me come?

709
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:23,575
Or you want to know how I make him come?

710
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,200
He left a bruise.

711
00:47:31,575 --> 00:47:33,866
You want to see?

712
00:47:34,866 --> 00:47:37,741
We have a child. We have a family.

713
00:47:37,825 --> 00:47:41,325
That was your choice.

714
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:45,033
I want you to stop seeing him.

715
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:48,616
Or what?

716
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,700
What?

717
00:47:53,575 --> 00:47:55,200
You gonna divorce me?

718
00:47:56,283 --> 00:48:00,450
No, because you're gonna listen to me.

719
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:04,908
Look how assertive you've become.

720
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:19,658
If I didn't know you, I'd think you'd
throw me on the floor and you'd fuck me.

721
00:48:19,741 --> 00:48:21,616
Huh?

722
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,658
Yeah?

723
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,408
No?

724
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,908
Yeah, you wouldn't do that.

725
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:36,741
That requires a certain amount of passion,

726
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:38,616
like you'd actually have to love me.

727
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,325
I do love you!

728
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:52,908
Are you in love with him?

729
00:48:56,408 --> 00:48:59,116
If you were married to anyone else,

730
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,741
you'd be so fucking bored
you'd kill yourself.

Hey, everyone, come here.

Come here. Come here.

751
00:50:30,991 --> 00:50:33,783
Um, I want to introduce you
to a friend of mine, Charlie De Lisle,

752
00:50:33,866 --> 00:50:35,866
- who's very happy to be here.
- Right on.

753
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,575
- And he'd like to play a song.
- Oh.

754
00:50:38,658 --> 00:50:40,033
Right?

755
00:50:40,116 --> 00:50:42,325
- I'm not playing a song. I'm not.
- Come on.

756
00:50:42,408 --> 00:50:44,533
Come on.

757
00:50:44,616 --> 00:50:46,408
Yeah, I promise, he's amazing.

758
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:47,908
And he's my teacher.

759
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:50,575
- I am.
- Okay.

760
00:50:50,658 --> 00:50:55,408
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
this is just a little something.

761
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:57,533
Charlie!

762
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,783
Jen!

763
00:52:06,325 --> 00:52:08,200
Jesus.

764
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,575

- Pardon me.
- Vic.

767
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:35,200
I want to introduce you
to my friend Charlie.

768
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:36,866
Hi. Yeah, I'm Charlie.

769
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,366
It's-it's nice to meet you.

770
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,575
Nice to meet you.

771
00:52:39,658 --> 00:52:41,408
- Thanks for giving my wife piano lessons.
- Yeah, no, of course.

772
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:44,200
I mean, she's a real natural, so it's, uh,

Have we met before?

00:52:51,283 --> 00:52:52,908
I don't think so.

776
00:52:52,991 --> 00:52:55,033
I think you'd both remember.

777
00:52:57,866 --> 00:53:00,075
- Well, pleasure.
- Yeah.

778
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:02,658
Yeah, have a nice night, man.
Nice to meet you.

825
00:58:17,408 --> 00:58:21,408
I was so surprised to see you
dancing with Kelly.

826
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:23,616
Why?

827
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,408
I just didn't know you could.

828
00:58:25,491 --> 00:58:28,783
I can't. I just like to.

829
00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:32,533
Now… Oh, shit.

830
00:58:32,616 --> 00:58:33,783
Fuck.

831
00:58:33,866 --> 00:58:34,991
Man, what's wrong with you?

832
00:58:38,533 --> 00:58:41,616
Maybe next time you get the itch,
you should ask me.

833
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:53,575
Get his head up!

834
00:58:53,658 --> 00:58:55,783
- Here you go.
- I got him. - Get his legs.

835
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,033
Get his legs!

836
00:58:58,116 --> 00:58:59,533
Call 911.

837
00:58:59,616 --> 00:59:01,783
I know CPR.

838
00:59:01,866 --> 00:59:04,783
- Okay, lay him flat on his back.
- Call 911, goddamn it.

839
00:59:06,783 --> 00:59:08,950
- Who knows CPR?
- You gotta get him on the...

840
00:59:09,033 --> 00:59:10,158
on the flat surface. Look out.

841
00:59:10,241 --> 00:59:11,783
We gotta get him on the patio.
I'll lift him.

842
00:59:11,866 --> 00:59:13,741
Okay. Get him up. One, two, three.

843
00:59:16,866 --> 00:59:18,116
Fuck, he's heavy.

844
00:59:19,325 --> 00:59:21,325
The fuck is the matter with you?

845
00:59:23,825 --> 00:59:25,616
I know CPR.

846
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,325
Look out.

847
00:59:27,408 --> 00:59:29,158
Please do something.

848
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,408
Please do something!

849
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:33,908
- What the fuck!
- Is somebody calling?

850
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:35,200
Oh, fuck, is he breathing?

851
00:59:35,283 --> 00:59:37,033
I don't think he's breathing.

852
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:38,908
You gotta clear his airway.

853
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:40,450
Come on, guys.

854
00:59:40,533 --> 00:59:42,991
Okay. You gotta clear his airway.

855
00:59:43,075 --> 00:59:45,783
- Oh, fuck.
- You're not doing it right.

856
00:59:45,866 --> 00:59:47,450
You're not doing it right.

857
00:59:47,533 --> 00:59:48,825
- Vic!
- Here, let me do it.

858
00:59:48,908 --> 00:59:51,158
Goddamn it, you're not even trying!

859
00:59:51,241 --> 00:59:53,825
- Come on, Melinda.
- You're not! You're not even trying!

860
00:59:53,908 --> 00:59:56,075
Melinda.

861
00:59:56,158 --> 00:59:57,533
- Stop it, Melinda.
- Stop fucking telling me...

862
00:59:57,616 --> 00:59:59,741
- Melinda, calm down!
- God… goddamn it!

863
00:59:59,825 --> 01:00:01,825
Oh, oh.

864
01:00:03,658 --> 01:00:05,075
Come on, let's get you
some Kleenex and some ice.

865
01:00:05,158 --> 01:00:06,533
Come on inside.

866
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,450
Come on, let's go inside.

867
01:00:10,533 --> 01:00:12,283
Fuck.

868
01:00:26,366 --> 01:00:28,325
He have a lot to drink?

869
01:00:28,408 --> 01:00:30,075
- Yeah, he was pretty drunk.
- Yeah.

870
01:00:30,158 --> 01:00:31,158
Yeah?

871
01:00:31,241 --> 01:00:33,366
Who saw him get in the pool?

872
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:36,658
Well, we were in the kitchen,
and there were people in...

873
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:39,366
- Yeah, yeah, we were the last two in the pool.
- Yeah.

874
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:41,450
About how long were you out of the pool?

875
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:42,866
- Uh…
- Not long.

876
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:45,283
Time it takes to make cookies.

877
01:00:45,366 --> 01:00:46,658
Hmm.

878
01:00:46,741 --> 01:00:48,908
Was there marijuana involved?

879
01:00:49,825 --> 01:00:51,741
Yes, but I-I have a card.

880
01:00:51,825 --> 01:00:53,200
That's not important.

881
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:55,075
We're just trying to figure out
what happened.

882
01:00:55,158 --> 01:00:57,533
Vic killed him.

883
01:00:57,616 --> 01:00:59,075
What?

884
01:00:59,158 --> 01:01:00,325
- Ah, come on, man.
- Melinda, come on.

885
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:02,366
- Jesus.
- Huh?

886
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,075
You killed him.

887
01:01:04,158 --> 01:01:06,491
- Melinda…
- Didn't you?

888
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:07,950
- Melinda. - Stop it.
- Okay, nah.

889
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:09,575
- Didn't you?
- Melinda, calm down.

890
01:01:09,658 --> 01:01:11,783
You probably hit him over the head
and drowned him.

891
01:01:11,866 --> 01:01:13,741
Okay, yeah, it's really...

892
01:01:13,825 --> 01:01:14,825
My wife's upset.

893
01:01:14,908 --> 01:01:17,491
I'm not fucking upset!
You fucking killed him!

894
01:01:17,575 --> 01:01:19,075
- Whoa, oh.
- Mrs. Van Allen,

895
01:01:19,158 --> 01:01:20,825
would you like to speak privately?

896
01:01:24,325 --> 01:01:26,158
Get an account from the rest of them.

897
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:28,616
Goddamn it...

898
01:01:32,533 --> 01:01:33,908
Who pulled him out?

899
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:36,158
- We all did. - We all did.
- We all pulled him out.

900
01:01:36,241 --> 01:01:38,200
Vic and I did CPR.

901
01:01:38,283 --> 01:01:39,616
But, um...

902
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,950
Charlie got banged
against the edge of the pool,

903
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:46,200
um, but Don was lifting him.

904
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,533
That didn't affect the death.

905
01:01:51,616 --> 01:01:53,575
Didn't help.

906
01:01:53,658 --> 01:01:56,991
And how long did you attempt
to revive him, Mr. Van Allen?

907
01:01:57,075 --> 01:01:59,408
As long as we had any hope
he was still alive.

908
01:01:59,491 --> 01:02:01,075
- We alternated.
- Hmm.

909
01:02:01,158 --> 01:02:03,450
He was dead in the pool.

910
01:02:04,908 --> 01:02:06,741
- Mr. Van Allen.
- Yeah.

911
01:02:06,825 --> 01:02:09,200
- Would you follow me in here, please?
- Sure.

912
01:02:11,116 --> 01:02:15,283
I'd like to talk to Chief Nichols, too,
please, privately.

913
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:26,866
Was your wife sleeping with Mr. De Lisle?

914
01:02:29,408 --> 01:02:31,366
I don't know.

915
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:33,575
I don't ask her those type of questions.

916
01:02:34,658 --> 01:02:37,950
Well, that's strange. Why is that?

917
01:02:38,033 --> 01:02:40,200
'Cause I don't feel the need
to dictate her choices.

918
01:02:40,283 --> 01:02:42,658
I accept her and love her for who she is.

919
01:02:43,866 --> 01:02:46,408
Well, she's currently
accusing you of murder.

920
01:02:46,491 --> 01:02:48,908
I didn't say she was always rational.

921
01:02:48,991 --> 01:02:50,200
Hmm.

922
01:02:52,616 --> 01:02:55,366
Did you kill Mr. De Lisle?

923
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:57,866
No.

924
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:00,283
When Grant and I went inside,
it was raining quite heavily.

925
01:03:00,366 --> 01:03:03,825
Mr. De Lisle was clinging
to the deep end of the pool.

926
01:03:03,908 --> 01:03:07,325
I didn't get the sense
he was a very strong swimmer.

927
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,616
Grant and I went in.

928
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,033
I tried to steal a cookie.

929
01:03:15,033 --> 01:03:17,116
Good night.

930
01:03:22,658 --> 01:03:24,033
Hey.

931
01:03:24,116 --> 01:03:26,158
Listen, get some rest.

932
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:27,491
Call me if you need anything.

933
01:03:27,575 --> 01:03:29,116
I will.

934
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,741
Don't let this get you down, all right?

935
01:03:31,825 --> 01:03:33,658
Get him down?
He should be down.

936
01:03:33,741 --> 01:03:36,158
He should be at the bottom
of that fucking pool.

937
01:04:14,741 --> 01:04:16,575
Thank you so much.

938
01:04:16,658 --> 01:04:18,075
You know what? Just keep this.

939
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:19,408
Okay? Thanks.

940
01:04:19,491 --> 01:04:21,116
Watch out for the dog.

941
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:24,241
Thank you.

942
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:45,783
So, what now?

943
01:04:45,866 --> 01:04:47,533
You want a divorce?

944
01:04:51,658 --> 01:04:55,158
I can't stand that you think
you're this much smarter than me.

945
01:04:55,241 --> 01:04:56,866
I don't think that.

946
01:05:01,991 --> 01:05:05,450
If you think I killed Charlie...

947
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:09,116
...aren't you frightened of me?

948
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,033
No.

949
01:05:13,116 --> 01:05:15,075
Why not?

950
01:05:15,158 --> 01:05:18,116
'Cause I'm the thing you killed for.

951
01:05:20,658 --> 01:05:22,991
Hmm.

952
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,658
You sure?

953
01:07:18,741 --> 01:07:20,408
Okay.

954
01:07:24,366 --> 01:07:26,033
I love you!

955
01:07:26,116 --> 01:07:28,033
Love you, too!

956
01:07:28,116 --> 01:07:30,033
Love you!

957
01:07:35,866 --> 01:07:37,200
Hi.

958
01:07:37,283 --> 01:07:39,241
I didn't know your kids went
to this school.

959
01:07:39,325 --> 01:07:40,658
They don't.

960
01:07:40,741 --> 01:07:44,741
I was actually hoping to talk to you
and I didn't want to come to the house,

961
01:07:44,825 --> 01:07:47,325
and, uh, I didn't know where else
to find you.

962
01:07:47,408 --> 01:07:49,575
Okay.

963
01:07:49,658 --> 01:07:54,491
I just want you to know that I don't
approve of what my husband's doing.

964
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:56,366
What's he doing?

965
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:59,866
I don't think that talking about people
behind their backs is right.

966
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:02,075
- Neither do I.
- I mean, it's ridiculous

967
01:08:02,158 --> 01:08:05,241
for Don to keep insisting
that you could've...

968
01:08:05,325 --> 01:08:07,741
You know, with Mr. De Lisle's accident.

969
01:08:07,825 --> 01:08:09,866
And I told Don, I said,

970
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:11,658
I don't think it's a good idea
to have Melinda over to the house,

971
01:08:11,741 --> 01:08:14,575
but he keeps inviting her over
to talk about his crazy theories.

972
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:16,200
I see.

973
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:20,241
Look, hey.

974
01:08:20,325 --> 01:08:22,325
This is not your fault.

975
01:08:22,408 --> 01:08:25,325
We should have you and Don
over for dinner.

976
01:08:26,491 --> 01:08:27,783
Uh...

977
01:08:28,866 --> 01:08:30,200
Hi.

978
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:33,700
Come in.

979
01:08:33,783 --> 01:08:36,116
Hey, come on in.

980
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,283
- I love them.
- Oh, thanks.

981
01:08:38,366 --> 01:08:39,950
- Kelly, you look so beautiful, I can't stand it.
- Hi.

982
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,408
Oh, thank you, Vic.

983
01:08:41,491 --> 01:08:43,033
- Hi.
- Don, thanks for coming. Come on in.

984
01:08:43,116 --> 01:08:44,408
Thanks for having us.

985
01:08:44,491 --> 01:08:46,116
This way.

986
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,866
Do you know anything about snails, Don?

987
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,283
I can't say I do.

988
01:08:50,366 --> 01:08:53,533
A snail will climb a 12-foot wall
to find its mate.

989
01:08:53,616 --> 01:08:56,075
- It's the smell.
- Huh.

990
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:57,783
Mind if I smoke?

991
01:08:57,866 --> 01:08:59,700
Please don't... it'll kill 'em.

992
01:08:59,783 --> 01:09:02,283
Oh, well, we don't want that.

993
01:09:02,366 --> 01:09:08,158
Don, I need you to stop telling people
that I killed Charlie De Lisle.

994
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:10,033
Is that right?

995
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,366
Yes. I think it's hurting your reputation.

996
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,700
I think it's hurting Kelly's reputation.

997
01:09:16,783 --> 01:09:20,116
Well, that's funny that you're not worried
it'll hurt yours.

998
01:09:29,116 --> 01:09:32,741
You know, I was gonna ask you
what you think killed Charlie.

999
01:09:32,825 --> 01:09:34,241
What killed him?

1000
01:09:34,325 --> 01:09:36,241
Well, just, who dies like that?

1001
01:09:36,325 --> 01:09:38,658
Accidentally in a swimming pool?

1002
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:41,200
Thousands of people a year.

1003
01:09:42,241 --> 01:09:44,491
What do you think killed him?

1004
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,658
- I think you drowned him.
- Yeah?

1005
01:09:46,741 --> 01:09:49,116
I heard I killed Martin McRae, too.

1006
01:09:50,575 --> 01:09:52,866
You said you killed him.

1007
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:54,283
Did you believe me?

1008
01:09:54,366 --> 01:09:56,116
No.

1009
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,325
Good for you.

1010
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:01,700
I thought it was weird, though,
that you said you did,

1011
01:10:01,783 --> 01:10:04,866
that you seemed to take pleasure in it.

1012
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,283
And that was enough for you
to share my wife's opinion?

1013
01:10:07,366 --> 01:10:09,075
It's my opinion.

1014
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,783
Would you, uh, be willing to take
a lie detector test

1015
01:10:22,866 --> 01:10:24,616
saying you didn't kill him?

1016
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,950
Sure. Get one.

1017
01:10:30,408 --> 01:10:32,616
You're a weird guy.

1018
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,866
So I've been told.

1019
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:19,783
Hey, hon.

1020
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,741
Hi.

1021
01:11:24,825 --> 01:11:28,366
Um, we're having lunch.

1022
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,658
Oh.

1023
01:11:29,741 --> 01:11:33,283
I was just going to get something to go,
but I can join you for a second.

1024
01:11:34,366 --> 01:11:37,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

1025
01:11:37,283 --> 01:11:39,325
This is my husband, Vic.

1026
01:11:39,408 --> 01:11:40,950
- Victor Van Allen.
- Oh.

1027
01:11:41,033 --> 01:11:43,783
- It's, uh, nice to meet you.
- You, too.

1028
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,033
This is David Ricigliani.

1029
01:11:45,116 --> 01:11:47,075
He's opening a practice here.

1030
01:11:47,158 --> 01:11:49,158
Oh. What kind of practice?

1031
01:11:49,241 --> 01:11:51,908
Psychotherapy.

1032
01:11:51,991 --> 01:11:53,908
Well, this town definitely needs that.

1033
01:11:53,991 --> 01:11:55,658
- You think?
- First practice?

1034
01:11:55,741 --> 01:11:56,825
Uh, no, no.

1035
01:11:56,908 --> 01:11:59,325
I actually closed my practice
in Cheshire recently.

1036
01:11:59,408 --> 01:12:01,533
- Upgraded.
- Yeah.

1037
01:12:01,616 --> 01:12:05,950
I'm curious, do you think my wife
has schizophrenic tendencies?

1038
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:08,616
- What?
- Well, he's a professional.

1039
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,283
I thought I'd ask.

1040
01:12:10,366 --> 01:12:11,533
No.

1041
01:12:11,616 --> 01:12:13,908
- It's possible he may have some insight as to…
- You're such an asshole.

1042
01:12:13,991 --> 01:12:15,491
- No, I don't think so at all.
- Hmm.

1043
01:12:15,575 --> 01:12:18,908
Do you think my husband might be
psychopathic for asking you that?

1044
01:12:18,991 --> 01:12:21,116
Or maybe just an asshole?

1045
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:26,158
Uh… how about, uh, couples therapy?

1046
01:12:28,241 --> 01:12:31,741
I was going to get something to go for the
guys, but maybe I'll just skip it, huh?

1047
01:12:31,825 --> 01:12:33,325
Hate to interrupt your lunch.

1048
01:12:33,408 --> 01:12:35,491
I'm used to this.

1049
01:12:37,741 --> 01:12:39,741
Nice to make your acquaintance, David.

1050
01:12:39,825 --> 01:12:41,616
You don't happen to have a card, do you?

1051
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,533
'Cause I may need a psychotherapist.

1052
01:12:44,616 --> 01:12:46,741
Oh, uh...

1053
01:12:46,825 --> 01:12:49,700
No, no. I… I don't have any on me.

1054
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:51,575
Mm-hmm.

1055
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:54,366
Well, I know where to find you.

1056
01:13:06,075 --> 01:13:07,325
Hi.

1057
01:13:08,408 --> 01:13:10,116
- Oh.
- Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt.

1058
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,075
I didn't know it was dinnertime, but...

1059
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:13,408
No, no, no, no, sit down, please.

1060
01:13:13,491 --> 01:13:15,325
This will just take a second.

1061
01:13:15,408 --> 01:13:16,533
Hi.

1062
01:13:17,908 --> 01:13:19,825
I just have a question for Don.

1063
01:13:19,908 --> 01:13:23,033
You know a guy named David Ricigliani?

1064
01:13:23,991 --> 01:13:25,491
Um...

1065
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:27,491
Who's David Ricigliani?

1066
01:13:27,575 --> 01:13:28,866
He's a man your husband hired.

1067
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,158
Who did you hire?

1068
01:13:30,241 --> 01:13:31,533
A private investigator.

1069
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:33,200
What for?

1070
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:34,450
To follow me.

1071
01:13:34,533 --> 01:13:36,533
This is ridiculous.

1072
01:13:36,616 --> 01:13:38,491
- How could you do that, Don?
- I made him a week ago.

1073
01:13:38,575 --> 01:13:40,408
I ran into him at a diner with Melinda.

1074
01:13:40,491 --> 01:13:43,158
Go outside, I see a telephoto lens
in the back of his car.

1075
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:44,450
Oh, my God.

1076
01:13:44,533 --> 01:13:46,450
Guy tried to tell me
he was a psychotherapist.

1077
01:13:46,533 --> 01:13:48,075
Where'd you find this guy?

1078
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:51,533
You can't just walk into my house
and accuse me, in front of my family...

1079
01:13:51,616 --> 01:13:54,533
Apparently, anybody can accuse
anyone of anything.

1080
01:13:54,616 --> 01:13:57,450
Unlike you, however, Don, I have proof.

1081
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:00,866
This is a bank record of a wire
from my wife

1082
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:05,408
to your account for $743.50,
which is sort of an unusual amount,

1083
01:14:05,491 --> 01:14:07,366
so I assume you went splitsies
on the retainer.

1084
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:08,700
- Your wife…
- Oh, my God.

1085
01:14:08,783 --> 01:14:10,241
Have you lost your mind?

1086
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:11,658
What the fuck were you thinking, Don?

1087
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:13,200
Goldie, go inside.

1088
01:14:13,283 --> 01:14:16,283
- Uh, this is, this is humiliating.
- At least tell me where you found him.

1089
01:14:16,366 --> 01:14:18,741
Your wife wired that money to me.

1090
01:14:18,825 --> 01:14:19,908
- Back of a newspaper?
- Goldie, I said inside.

1091
01:14:19,991 --> 01:14:21,408
It's from your wife.

1092
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:23,075
- Sorry to interrupt your dinner.
- No, no, no.

1093
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:24,408
Don't you apologize for anything.

1094
01:14:24,491 --> 01:14:26,366
I'm the one who's sorry.

1095
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:27,825
What the hell are you apologizing
to him for?

1096
01:14:27,908 --> 01:14:28,950
Are you kidding me, Don?

1097
01:14:29,033 --> 01:14:31,616
- Don't apologize to this piece of shit.
- Will you stop, Don?

1098
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,158
Goldie, I thought I told you to go inside.

1099
01:14:33,241 --> 01:14:35,866
She did tell you to go inside.
Go inside, Goldie.

1100
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,533
Go inside, Goldie!

1101
01:14:37,616 --> 01:14:39,908
Goddamn it.
Who left the fucking gate open?

1102
01:15:21,658 --> 01:15:23,116
Hey.

1103
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:38,325
- Daddy?
- Mm-hmm.

1104
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,366
When Charlie drowned in the swimming pool,

1105
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:42,658
did his feet touch the bottom?

1106
01:15:42,741 --> 01:15:44,491
I don't know. I wasn't there.

1107
01:15:44,575 --> 01:15:46,616
Sure, you were there.

1108
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,783
Well, I was there when we were trying
to save him...

1109
01:15:49,866 --> 01:15:53,366
everyone was...
but everything happened very quickly.

1110
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:56,658
But you still know what you did.

1111
01:15:56,741 --> 01:15:58,991
I didn't do it, honey.

1112
01:15:59,075 --> 01:16:01,700
I think you're kidding me.

1113
01:16:01,783 --> 01:16:04,283
I'm not.

1114
01:16:04,366 --> 01:16:06,783
I'm not, Trix.

1115
01:16:09,075 --> 01:16:11,283
Why won't you tell me how you did it?

1116
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:14,158
Everyone keeps asking me how you did it.

1117
01:16:20,116 --> 01:16:21,825
Sweetheart...

1118
01:16:22,908 --> 01:16:25,033
...if I did kill someone...

1119
01:16:26,116 --> 01:16:28,241
...do you know what they would do to me?

1120
01:16:28,325 --> 01:16:33,700
They would put me in prison
for the rest of my life.

1121
01:16:33,783 --> 01:16:35,908
Do you understand?

1122
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:41,825
I still think you drowned him.

1123
01:16:41,908 --> 01:16:44,700
You're just telling me you didn't.

1124
01:16:47,533 --> 01:16:50,575
Well, let's keep that between us.

1125
01:16:56,533 --> 01:16:57,950
Rita.

1126
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:02,033
Kangaroo.

1127
01:17:03,408 --> 01:17:05,575
Bring sloth back in.

1128
01:17:07,491 --> 01:17:09,533
You, you?

1129
01:17:14,991 --> 01:17:16,241
Yes?

1130
01:17:20,908 --> 01:17:23,075
It's killing me.

1131
01:17:23,158 --> 01:17:24,825
What?

1132
01:17:24,908 --> 01:17:26,533
Brazil?

1133
01:17:26,616 --> 01:17:28,950
I've never been to Brazil.

1134
01:17:30,825 --> 01:17:32,491
Yes.

1135
01:17:34,658 --> 01:17:36,866
No, she would.

1136
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:38,616
She'd love it.

1137
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,450
She'll get used to it.

1138
01:17:43,908 --> 01:17:46,200
What'd you say?

1139
01:17:46,283 --> 01:17:48,991
Oh, we can talk.

1140
01:17:50,116 --> 01:17:52,200
Love you.

1141
01:18:12,366 --> 01:18:14,075
How was your night?

1142
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:20,825
You don't want to tell me?

1143
01:18:27,283 --> 01:18:29,825
You just don't want to talk.

1144
01:18:57,783 --> 01:18:59,408
- You must be Vic.
- Yeah.

1145
01:18:59,491 --> 01:19:00,866
- Tony Cameron.
- Hi.

1146
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:02,200
Old friend of Melinda's.

1147
01:19:02,283 --> 01:19:03,783
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1148
01:19:03,866 --> 01:19:06,075
- Thank you for having me over.
- Sure.

1149
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,491
- Nice space you got here.
- Thank you very much.

1150
01:19:08,575 --> 01:19:10,200
Yeah, it's like a science lab.

1151
01:19:10,283 --> 01:19:11,908
Kind of.

1152
01:19:12,991 --> 01:19:14,241
Are those snails?

1153
01:19:14,325 --> 01:19:16,200
Yeah. Check it out.

1154
01:19:16,283 --> 01:19:18,325
Wow.

1155
01:19:18,408 --> 01:19:19,658
How about that?

1156
01:19:19,741 --> 01:19:22,075
Huh.

1157
01:19:27,866 --> 01:19:29,741
Um, is Melinda here?

1158
01:19:29,825 --> 01:19:31,241
Yeah, she's upstairs.

1159
01:19:31,325 --> 01:19:33,283
All right.

1160
01:19:33,366 --> 01:19:35,700
All right, well,
I guess I'll see you up there.

1161
01:19:35,783 --> 01:19:37,158
- Great.
- Okay.

1162
01:19:41,533 --> 01:19:44,950
Yeah, so I've been working on,
uh, building LEED-certified housing.

1163
01:19:45,033 --> 01:19:46,283
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1164
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:49,033
In both-both here in the States
and-and also in Brazil, actually.

1165
01:19:49,116 --> 01:19:51,033
That's where our new initiative is.

1166
01:19:51,116 --> 01:19:56,158
'Cause, you know, the point is, well,
if we can create sustainable living spaces

1167
01:19:56,241 --> 01:19:59,575
for people around the world, we can help
create a more sustainable planet.

1168
01:19:59,658 --> 01:20:02,241
You know, for-for… for Trixie.

1169
01:20:02,325 --> 01:20:04,450
You know, for the,
for the next generation.

1170
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:06,366
Can I get you a drink?

1171
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:08,366
I'll take a sparkling water,
if you got it.

1172
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:09,616
Sure.

1173
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:10,783
Thank you.

1174
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:13,908
Hi.

1175
01:20:14,991 --> 01:20:17,116
- Hi.
- Hi.

1176
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,991
- There you are.
- Tony.

1177
01:20:19,075 --> 01:20:21,283
- Hi.
- Hi. Wow, it's great to see you.

1178
01:20:21,366 --> 01:20:22,741
<i>- Hola.
- Hola.</i>

1179
01:20:22,825 --> 01:20:23,908
Hi.

1180
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:25,116
<i>¿Cómo estás?</i>

1181
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,325
I can't believe you're here.

1182
01:20:26,408 --> 01:20:28,241
- I know, it's been a while.
- It's just crazy.

1183
01:20:28,325 --> 01:20:30,283
I know.

1184
01:20:30,366 --> 01:20:31,908
How are you?

1185
01:20:31,991 --> 01:20:34,408
I'm great. I'm great. Great.

1186
01:20:34,491 --> 01:20:35,950
You hungry?

1187
01:20:36,033 --> 01:20:37,366
Yeah, actually, I'm starving.

1188
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:39,575
I'm starving. Well, that's why
I came over, obviously.

1189
01:20:39,658 --> 01:20:41,575
- Starving's good.
- Yeah.

1190
01:20:41,658 --> 01:20:43,075
Here you go.

1191
01:20:43,158 --> 01:20:44,158
Thank you.

1192
01:20:44,241 --> 01:20:45,658
Can I help?

1193
01:20:45,741 --> 01:20:46,991
- No.
- No?

1194
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:48,491
- No.
- All right.

1195
01:20:50,408 --> 01:20:51,533
Is he being nice?

1196
01:20:51,616 --> 01:20:52,658
He's very nice. Very nice.

1197
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:54,033
I was just telling him how we reconnected.

1198
01:20:54,116 --> 01:20:55,741
I was, I was working in
the state legislature here

1199
01:20:55,825 --> 01:20:58,366
and we started just chatting on Facebook.

1200
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:00,366
I think what you're doing
is very inspiring.

1201
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,533
Well, thank you.

1202
01:21:01,616 --> 01:21:03,283
- If that counts.
- Thank you.

1203
01:21:03,366 --> 01:21:04,616
- Right?
- I'm just...

1204
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:05,741
- Very admirable.
- Yeah.

1205
01:21:05,825 --> 01:21:09,408
Just, I'm happy it gives me a chance
to reconnect with old friends.

1206
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:12,866
Fun fact: Tony was the first American
I fucked.

1207
01:21:17,491 --> 01:21:19,116
- What? You blushing?
- Just...

1208
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,783
Well, it's just…

1209
01:21:20,866 --> 01:21:23,033
Are you okay?

1210
01:21:23,116 --> 01:21:25,825
It's just an unnecessary amount of detail,
Melinda.

1211
01:21:25,908 --> 01:21:28,075
Well, it's true. What?

1212
01:21:29,575 --> 01:21:30,866
Wha...? Don't worry about Vic.

1213
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:32,825
- He couldn't care less.
- Oh.

1214
01:21:32,908 --> 01:21:36,575
He's doesn't want to control me
like a normal man.

1215
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:38,450
Uh, no, I'm not normal.

1216
01:21:38,533 --> 01:21:41,658
As somebody who dated her, Vic,
I-I really sympathize with you.

1217
01:21:41,741 --> 01:21:43,616
She's-she's a very difficult person

1218
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:46,075
- to control.
- Oh, yeah. Right?

1219
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:48,366
But that's also what makes her special.

1220
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:50,533
You know that.

1221
01:21:51,866 --> 01:21:54,075
And then you broke up with me.

1222
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:55,866
- Did I?
- Yes, you did.

1223
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:58,366
He broke my heart.

1224
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:02,158
- It's not true.
- You did, too.

1225
01:22:02,241 --> 01:22:03,991
Smells great over here, by the way.

1226
01:22:04,075 --> 01:22:06,241
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Yeah.

1227
01:22:06,325 --> 01:22:07,408
Mmm.

1228
01:22:07,491 --> 01:22:09,825
Vic, you know what we should do
is get some-some snails.

1229
01:22:11,366 --> 01:22:13,325
That sounds amazing.

1230
01:22:13,408 --> 01:22:14,825
Garlic and a little butter?

1231
01:22:14,908 --> 01:22:16,241
- Want me to get 'em? I can get 'em.
- Come on.

1232
01:22:16,325 --> 01:22:18,783
No, the snails aren't for eating.

1233
01:22:20,116 --> 01:22:21,908
Oh, sorry. They're not for eat...

1234
01:22:21,991 --> 01:22:23,366
What are they, what are they for?

1235
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:25,616
They're not for anything.

1236
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,741
Well, you won't miss
a dozen or so, will you?

1237
01:22:27,825 --> 01:22:29,075
The snails are not for eating.

1238
01:22:29,158 --> 01:22:30,658
No, he won't. Just go get them.

1239
01:22:30,741 --> 01:22:33,616
I mean, they're-they're not like
your pets, are they?

1240
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,658
Fun fact:

1241
01:22:35,741 --> 01:22:38,491
You know you have to starve them, right?

1242
01:22:38,575 --> 01:22:39,825
What?

1243
01:22:39,908 --> 01:22:42,616
Before you eat them, you have to make
sure their intestines are empty.

1244
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:46,325
Otherwise, you'll poison yourself
and you'll die.

1245
01:22:49,575 --> 01:22:51,741
I did not know that.

1246
01:22:51,825 --> 01:22:53,533
No snails.

1247
01:22:54,908 --> 01:22:57,075
Who knew?

1248
01:24:54,408 --> 01:24:56,325
Hey, Tony.

1249
01:24:56,408 --> 01:24:58,366
Oh, Vic. That's funny.

1250
01:24:58,450 --> 01:24:59,866
Melinda's been trying to get ahold of you.

1251
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:01,366
She's got a building site
she wants to show you.

1252
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:02,700
She keeps talking about it.

1253
01:25:02,783 --> 01:25:05,408
Oh, really? She didn't, uh, say anything.

1254
01:25:05,491 --> 01:25:07,533
Well, come on, jump in.

1255
01:25:08,616 --> 01:25:10,616
All right.

1256
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:23,325
It's really a beautiful spot.

1257
01:25:23,408 --> 01:25:26,283
Melinda and I used to go hiking up there
back when we started dating.

1258
01:25:26,366 --> 01:25:28,241
Sounds nice.

1259
01:25:30,283 --> 01:25:31,991
So why'd you break up with her?

1260
01:25:35,075 --> 01:25:36,450
What?

1261
01:25:36,533 --> 01:25:39,075
You know, when you guys were young.

1262
01:25:39,158 --> 01:25:40,450
Oh.

1263
01:25:40,533 --> 01:25:41,950
You know, I really don't remember.

1264
01:25:42,033 --> 01:25:43,741
I…
It was such a long time ago.

1265
01:26:04,616 --> 01:26:07,325
Going a little fast, Vic, don't you think?

1266
01:26:07,408 --> 01:26:10,075
So you guys just, like, reconnected?

1267
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:14,575
Uh, yeah. I mean, a couple months ago,
just casually.

1268
01:26:14,658 --> 01:26:16,408
You gonna be in town for a while?

1269
01:26:26,033 --> 01:26:27,783
This is the way, huh?

1270
01:26:27,866 --> 01:26:29,200
Yep.

1271
01:26:30,241 --> 01:26:32,450
Should I give Melinda a call?

1272
01:26:32,533 --> 01:26:34,158
Sure, go ahead.

1273
01:26:37,866 --> 01:26:39,366
There's no service.

1274
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:40,908
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

1275
01:26:48,575 --> 01:26:50,408
Here we are.

1276
01:27:01,825 --> 01:27:03,783
Where's Melinda?

1277
01:27:03,866 --> 01:27:06,116
She and I used to go mountain biking
up here.

1278
01:27:09,741 --> 01:27:11,533
There's a gorge just across the way.

1279
01:27:13,491 --> 01:27:15,116
She said we should meet her there.

1280
01:27:16,741 --> 01:27:18,075
Ah, fuck.

1281
01:27:18,158 --> 01:27:20,450
Oh, fuck.

1282
01:27:24,991 --> 01:27:26,658
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1283
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:28,075
Stop, stop.

1284
01:30:04,241 --> 01:30:07,241
Here?

1285
01:30:07,325 --> 01:30:09,408
You're gonna fall.

1286
01:30:09,491 --> 01:30:12,616
You're gonna fall.

1287
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,200
What are you guys doing?

1288
01:30:18,533 --> 01:30:19,825
How's Tony?

1289
01:30:19,908 --> 01:30:21,616
- Right here?
- Mm-hmm.

1290
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,533
I don't know.

1291
01:30:25,616 --> 01:30:28,658
I like him. He's actually got brains.

1292
01:30:35,658 --> 01:30:39,658
I'm going to pour you just a glass,
'cause we're celebrating.

1293
01:30:40,741 --> 01:30:42,575
Now we toast.

1294
01:30:42,658 --> 01:30:47,991
May the boys of St. Vincent's
keep their hands off our pigtails.

1295
01:30:52,325 --> 01:30:54,158
What are you doing?

1296
01:30:54,241 --> 01:30:56,200
You getting her drunk?

1297
01:30:56,283 --> 01:30:57,991
We're celebrating.

1298
01:30:58,075 --> 01:31:00,241
What are you celebrating?

1299
01:31:00,325 --> 01:31:02,866
Oh, life.

1300
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:04,408
Wine.

1301
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,950
Have you seen him?

1302
01:31:10,033 --> 01:31:11,991
Who?

1303
01:31:12,075 --> 01:31:13,783
Tony.

1304
01:31:13,866 --> 01:31:16,783
- Tony.
- Tony Pony!

1305
01:31:16,866 --> 01:31:19,575
- Tony Pony?
- Tony Maloney!

1306
01:31:19,658 --> 01:31:21,908
Tony Baloney, I have not seen.

1307
01:31:54,658 --> 01:31:56,325
Daddy?

1308
01:31:56,408 --> 01:31:58,116
Yes.

1309
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,158
We're going on a picnic.

1310
01:32:02,241 --> 01:32:04,741
Do you want to come with us?

1311
01:32:04,825 --> 01:32:06,491
I would love to. Where we going?

1312
01:32:06,575 --> 01:32:08,575
The gorge.

1313
01:32:10,075 --> 01:32:12,616
The gorge?

1314
01:32:31,491 --> 01:32:34,783
Why are you the only man
who wants to stay with me?

1315
01:32:36,325 --> 01:32:38,033
I don't know.

1316
01:32:42,825 --> 01:32:45,116
But you do?

1317
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,408
I do.

1318
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:15,741
You're not bored?

1319
01:33:15,825 --> 01:33:17,783
No.

1320
01:33:19,533 --> 01:33:21,450
Are you?

1321
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:30,783
But I'm sad.

1322
01:33:34,033 --> 01:33:35,616
I got you something.

1323
01:34:19,283 --> 01:34:21,950
You didn't know I took that.

1324
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:29,783
- I was three months pregnant.
- Mm-hmm.

1325
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:41,783
Thank you.

1326
01:34:51,366 --> 01:34:53,533
Roger!

1327
01:34:53,616 --> 01:34:56,200
- Hey, Trixie!
- Roger!

1328
01:34:56,283 --> 01:34:57,658
Trix!

1329
01:34:57,741 --> 01:34:59,075
- Hold on. Hold on.
- She's fine, she's fine.

1330
01:34:59,158 --> 01:35:00,408
- I'll be right back.
- Stay.

1331
01:35:00,491 --> 01:35:02,825
- Trix! Uh...
- Vic, stay.

1332
01:35:02,908 --> 01:35:05,866
Trixie, back up, honey.
Get away from the edge, sweet pea.

1333
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,325
Back up, back up, back up.

1334
01:35:07,408 --> 01:35:09,825
Thank you. Okay.

1335
01:35:09,908 --> 01:35:11,325
We have to go back, okay?

1336
01:35:11,408 --> 01:35:13,450
This is too close to the edge.

1337
01:35:28,616 --> 01:35:30,533
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1338
01:35:30,616 --> 01:35:32,658
Okay.

1339
01:35:38,783 --> 01:35:41,408
Oh, damn. I left my scarf up there.

1340
01:35:41,491 --> 01:35:43,616
I'm sorry.

1341
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:45,366
We can't go back now.

1342
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:47,325
Oh, I'll go back for it.

1343
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:49,158
But like tomorrow.

1344
01:35:49,241 --> 01:35:51,741
- Would you?
- Yeah.

1345
01:35:51,825 --> 01:35:54,700
I'll go back and get it
first thing in the morning.

1346
01:35:57,408 --> 01:35:59,200
Okay.

1347
01:35:59,283 --> 01:36:00,575
Thank you.

1348
01:36:01,658 --> 01:36:03,658
No problem.

1349
01:36:09,241 --> 01:36:11,866
- Hey. Can I get you some tea?
- Hi.

1350
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:13,283
No, I'm fine.

1351
01:36:13,366 --> 01:36:16,116
She went down so easy, but I told her
you'd come give her a kiss.

1352
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,491
- Okay?
- Okay.

1353
01:36:17,575 --> 01:36:21,200
Hey, wh-who were you, uh,
on the phone with?

1354
01:36:21,283 --> 01:36:23,325
Tony?

1355
01:36:23,408 --> 01:36:24,825
No.

1356
01:36:24,908 --> 01:36:26,658
I haven't heard from Tony.

1357
01:36:26,741 --> 01:36:28,533
That was Don.

1358
01:36:50,741 --> 01:36:52,616
Can you sleep in my room tonight?

1359
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:56,783
- Sure.
- Please.

1360
01:37:39,116 --> 01:37:41,408
I love you.

1361
01:38:57,533 --> 01:38:59,491
Vic?

1362
01:39:02,241 --> 01:39:04,075
Vic?

1363
01:41:48,658 --> 01:41:49,991
Hey, there!

1364
01:41:52,075 --> 01:41:53,325
Hi.

1365
01:41:53,408 --> 01:41:54,450
Hi.

1366
01:41:55,533 --> 01:41:56,950
What are you doing?

1367
01:41:57,033 --> 01:41:59,991
Uh, just, uh, went for a little ride.

1368
01:42:00,075 --> 01:42:02,325
Uh, Melinda forgot her scarf.

1369
01:42:05,533 --> 01:42:07,408
- Oh.
- Found it.

1370
01:42:07,491 --> 01:42:09,991
Found it. Great.

1371
01:42:10,075 --> 01:42:11,991
Thanks.

1372
01:42:12,075 --> 01:42:13,741
So, which...

1373
01:42:13,825 --> 01:42:15,991
How you doing? How's Kelly?

1374
01:42:17,075 --> 01:42:19,033
She's fine.

1375
01:42:21,033 --> 01:42:23,075
What are you doing down here?

1376
01:42:24,158 --> 01:42:27,950
Like I said, just, uh, looking
for that scarf, but...

1377
01:42:28,033 --> 01:42:29,408
you got it, so...

1378
01:42:29,491 --> 01:42:30,991
It was lying in the grass.

1379
01:42:31,075 --> 01:42:32,700
Oh.

1380
01:42:32,783 --> 01:42:35,450
What are you doing with that stick?

1381
01:42:36,533 --> 01:42:38,366
Nothing.

1382
01:42:51,075 --> 01:42:52,408
Oh, shit.

1383
01:43:02,158 --> 01:43:03,658
Fuck. Fuck.

1384
01:43:09,991 --> 01:43:11,825

01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:28,116
Come get me now, you piece of shit!

1387
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:29,908
Are you gonna catch me on your bike?!

1388
01:43:29,991 --> 01:43:31,325
You motherfucker.

1389
01:44:05,908 --> 01:44:07,200
Where'd you go?

1390
01:44:07,283 --> 01:44:09,116
Did I lose ya?

1391
01:44:28,033 --> 01:44:29,658
I was right. I was right.

1392
01:44:29,741 --> 01:44:31,950
Kelly, you are not gonna believe this.

1393
01:44:32,033 --> 01:44:33,741
This is… this is it.

1394
01:44:33,825 --> 01:44:35,491
This is a book.

1395
01:44:50,741 --> 01:44:52,741
Trixie?

1396
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:04,741
Fuck.

1397
01:45:07,908 --> 01:45:10,033
Trixie, what are you doing?

1398
01:45:10,116 --> 01:45:11,908
We're not going!

1399
01:45:17,158 --> 01:45:19,408
I was…

1400
01:45:19,491 --> 01:45:21,950

1401
01:45:22,033 --> 01:45:24,658
