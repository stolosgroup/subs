3
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,021
Oh, crap!

4
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,318
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

5
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,021
That was purely reactive.

6
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:39,794
Whoa!

7
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,389
Whoa!

8
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,895
No! No!

9
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,601
Come on!

10
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:32,146
Nate! Come on.

11
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,313
I got you.

12
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,248
Help! I'm falling!

13
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:38,686
I got you. Come on.

14
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,123
- I got you.
- Oh, my God.

15
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,891
- Hey, hey. Keep it down.
- Oh, my God.

16
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,960
Hey. Hey.

17
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:48,295
What part of "wait for me"
did you not get?

18
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,797
I said I'm coming with you.

19
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,299
Okay. Okay.

20
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,669
We're looking for
the Age of Explorers exhibit.

21
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:55,870
So be quiet.

22
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,739
Bubble Yum?

23
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:01,576
That's my last piece.
Let's split it.

24
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,679
Hey.

25
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:06,279
Punk.

26
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,920
All right, smart guy.
Who's this?

27
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:14,956
Too easy.
Ferdinand Magellan.

28
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,759
First guy to sail
around the world.

29
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:20,862
Wrong. Magellan never made it
all the way around.

30
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,830
He just took all the credit.

31
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,634
Holy shit. There it is.

32
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,436
- What?
- Shh.

33
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,671
Come here.

34
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,142
First map of the whole world.

35
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,479
You know what Magellan
was really looking for?

36
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:42,083
Gold.

37
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:45,186
But he never made it home.

38
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:49,157
So all that gold,
it's just gone?

39
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,490
Whoa.

40
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,425
Lost. Not gone.

41
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,294
There's a difference.

42
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:58,766
If something's lost,
it can be found.

43
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,903
But lucky for us, we got
pirate blood in our veins.

44
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:04,337
Descended from
Sir Francis Drake himself.

45
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:07,975
At least, that...

46
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,578
was what Mom and Dad
used to say.

47
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:14,949
You know,

48
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,185
sometimes I think
they're out there somewhere.

49
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,686
Like they're just lost.

50
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,487
They're not lost.

51
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,489
They're gone.

52
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,327
All right.

53
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,531
This map is worth a fortune.

54
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,601
Here goes nothing.

55
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,438
Come on.

56
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:39,974
- Let's go. Hey.
- Hey!

57
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,676
- You two! Don't move.
- Hey! Hey!

58
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,311
Oh, crap.

59
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:47,515
We came here first
out of respect, Sister B.

60
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,449
But this is his third strike.

61
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:52,053
Go get your things, Sam.

62
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:04,198
You can't just let them
take him away.

63
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:06,334
Say your goodbyes.

64
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,173
What the hell?

65
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:14,008
I'm not letting them
lock me up.

66
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:15,408
No way.

67
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,078
I'm coming with you.

68
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,880
Not this time.

69
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:22,283
Come here.

70
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,856
You see me go anywhere
without this?

71
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,524
No.

72
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:33,694
So you know I will never
leave it behind.

73
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:38,733
I will always be with you.

74
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,270
It says <i>"sic parvis magna."</i>

75
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,939
"Greatness from
small beginnings."

76
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:49,409
That's you and me.

77
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,212
Let's go, kid.

78
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,591
I better get going.

79
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,637
I'll come back for you, Nate.

80
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,407
Promise.

81
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,632
<i>Never forget, you're a Drake.</i>

82
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,300
<i>I love you.</i>

83
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,215
Oh, well, well, well,
if it isn't

84
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,018
the late, great
and formerly employed Nate.

85
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:39,320
Well, at least you got
the "great" part right.

86
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:44,692
Hey, Goldie,
I brought your stuff up.

87
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,193
- Thank you.
- Hey, how was last night?

88
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:47,728
- Great.
- Yeah, he was cute?

89
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,730
- Very cute.
- Nice.

90
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,034
- Hey.
- Hi.

91
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,535
Excuse me.

92
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,203
Sorry.

93
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,005
Hey, what can I get you?

94
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,408
- A vodka tonic.
- Vodka tonic? Come on.

95
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,343
It's my first drink
of the night. Test me a little.

96
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:03,978
Uh, I don't know.

97
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,446
A... A negroni.

98
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:06,547
A ne-what?

99
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,082
Uh...

100
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,417
I'm kidding.

101
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,252
The negroni.

102
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,789
First made in 1919
for Count Camillo Negroni

103
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,624
when he swapped the soda water

104
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,859
in his usual drink,
the Americano,

105
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:20,561
for gin.

106
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,832
Haven't seen you
in here before.

107
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,400
It's not really
my neighborhood.

108
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:28,069
Not your neighborhood?
Where are you from?

109
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:30,604
- Greenwich.
- Greenwich. Sounds nice.

110
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:33,040
Bartenders up there
don't give history lessons.

111
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:38,112
Well, bartenders in Greenwich
don't make negronis like this.

112
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,654
You want to leave it
open or closed?

113
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,090
Open, probably.
It's only Daddy's money.

114
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,099
The cigarette.

115
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:02,937
Invented by
Alfonso Cigaretti in 1462.

116
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,539
I'm kidding. I don't...

117
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,774
I don't really know
who invented the cigarette.

118
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:09,643
You're kind of weird.

119
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,112
But kind of cute, too.

120
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,780
Well, then I'm
kind of offended,

121
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,549
but I'm also kind of flattered.

122
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,150
Here.

123
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:24,291
- Come on.
- Y-You know what?

124
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:26,026
It's for the best.

125
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,761
I've been trying to quit.

126
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:29,463
Well, maybe it's a sign.

127
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:33,000
Or maybe you just need
to get one that works.

128
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,201
This old thing?

129
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,004
Oh, it works.

130
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,650
That trust fund ingenue...

131
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,686
She was the right mark.

132
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,188
Don't know what
you're talking about.

133
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,489
Sure, you do.

134
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:57,559
You're going slow,
playing it safe,

135
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,360
not lifting too much at once.

136
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,995
I mean, stop me if I'm wrong.

137
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,396
Well, you're wrong.

138
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:05,399
And we're also closed,
so take off.

139
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:07,868
Victor Sullivan.
You can call me Sully.

140
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,370
Thank you.

141
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,205
I won't, but thank you.

142
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,841
I got a job coming up...
a big one.

143
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,510
I need another set
of hands on it.

144
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:17,378
So this is what you do?
You stumble into bars,

145
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:18,846
trying to pick up an accomplice?

146
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,081
I'm offering you
a real ticket out of here,

147
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,450
a chance to see places
you only read about in books.

148
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:25,319
What do you say?

149
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,722
You missed the read, Victor.

150
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,626
I'm not a mark in some bar.

151
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,062
And some of us here would
really like to go home, so...

152
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:36,997
get out.

153
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:38,667
Fair enough.

154
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,343
Bye-bye, now.

155
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,279
Hey, Goldie, let me get a beer.

156
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:53,847
Sure.

157
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,862
Son of a bitch.

158
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,636
Hey, hey, hey, get your head

159
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:15,769
- out of your ass.
- Whoa.

160
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,938
I'm so sorry.
I didn't see ya.

161
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:52,473
Hey.

162
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,174
I see patience
ain't your virtue.

163
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:55,744
Surprised to see me?

164
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,647
Not even slightly.
I made you a drink.

165
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,347
Shirley Temple.

166
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,850
That's hilarious.
And the bracelet?

167
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,052
It's in the first drawer there
on my desk,

168
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,755
if you want it.

169
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,123
But I think you're here 'cause
you got bigger fish to fry.

170
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,425
Nah, I'm just here
for the bracelet.

171
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,131
You done?

172
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,932
No.

173
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,502
Oof. This looks valuable.

174
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:22,604
Now I'm done.

175
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,742
Why the map?

176
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,443
Of everything in here,
that stopped you.

177
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:31,178
Because it looks like
it might be authentic.

178
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:32,946
Oh, not might be. It is.

179
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,948
Holy shit.

180
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,686
This line here shows the path

181
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,820
that Ferdinand Magellan took
to sail around the world.

182
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,889
First guy to do it.
You know your history.

183
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,758
Yeah, only he wasn't
the first guy to do it.

184
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,959
Magellan died
in the Philippines

185
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,361
on a random beach somewhere.

186
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,664
It was his captain,
Juan Sebastián Elcano,

187
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:51,332
finished the trip
with 17 others.

188
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,967
Also known as the Infamous 18.

189
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,670
I know the legend
that his voyage

190
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:57,071
wasn't about exploration...

191
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:59,340
it was about
finding that gold...

192
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,308
but it's just a story.

193
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:04,378
No. I beg to differ.

194
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,719
These trips were
hugely expensive back then.

195
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,386
The king of Spain
couldn't afford it.

196
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,788
There wasn't gonna be any trip

197
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:15,456
until a private financier
stepped in.

198
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,024
House of Moncada.

199
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,325
Yep.

200
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:20,528
Bankrolled the Crusades,
the Inquisition,

201
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:22,162
Franco's fascists in the '30s

202
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,498
and just about every horrible
thing you can think of.

203
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:26,735
They offered Magellan
his grand voyage of exploration

204
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,969
so long as he came back
with that gold.

205
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:30,404
How much gold?

206
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:32,206
Today's dollars...

207
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,375
Five billion, easy.

208
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:37,044
It's the biggest treasure
that's never been found.

209
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,915
Look, I've been dreaming
about this since I was a kid,

210
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,985
but somehow
you already knew that.

211
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,254
You know, when Sam said he had
a little brother who was

212
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:48,889
just as into
this Magellan stuff,

213
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,357
I thought, "There's no way."

214
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:51,860
Wait, you know my brother Sam?

215
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,894
Oh, we were
practically friends.

216
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,798
That's saying something,
considering the company I keep.

217
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,465
Look.

218
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,835
Look at him.

219
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,504
He has a beard.

220
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:03,971
Where is he?
When was this taken?

221
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:06,140
Almost two years ago,
San Sebastián, Spain.

222
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,208
We were getting close
to Captain Elcano's tomb,

223
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:10,512
where Sam was sure
we'd find his journal

224
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:12,747
and in it
the location of that gold.

225
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,214
Then he disappears.

226
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,618
Doesn't call, doesn't answer
my texts, nothing.

227
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:18,252
He ghosted me.

228
00:15:19,621 --> 00:15:21,422
Yeah, that sounds
like my brother.

229
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:23,858
Oh, so he hasn't been in touch?

230
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,860
Sam? No.

231
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,294
Not even a postcard?

232
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:33,434
No, not a postcard, phone call,
text message, email, nothing.

233
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:35,469
Hey, look, I don't know
what happened between you two,

234
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:37,104
but I think
if we find that gold,

235
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,206
there's a real good chance
we find him, too.

236
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,642
What do you say?

237
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,514
Sam left when I was 10.

238
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:48,315
He would call
every once in a while,

239
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,685
swore he'd come back,
but he never did.

240
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:53,922
The Sam that I knew
disappeared a long time ago.

241
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,124
So, nah, you'll have to find
somebody else.

242
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:00,795
Wow.

243
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,996
I'm really losing my touch.

244
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,009
<i>Wish you were here, bro.</i>

245
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,414
<i>There's a whole world
you haven't seen,</i>

246
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:55,984
<i>but you will.</i>

247
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,619
<i>I promise.</i>

248
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,629
Hey, kid.

249
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:43,096
What took you so long?

250
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,966
So, when do we start?

251
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,002
There's an auction coming up.

252
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:49,871
Biggest collection
of Spanish Renaissance art

253
00:17:50,004 --> 00:17:51,906
and artifacts
anywhere this century.

254
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,542
One of those items is
La Cruz de la Hermandad.

255
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:56,711
Only it's not a cross.

256
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,746
It's a key... a key that unlocks

257
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,549
the chamber where
the Infamous 18 hid their gold.

258
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:03,551
Very cool, but the legend said
there are two keys,

259
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:05,118
one for the captain
and one for the crew,

260
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:08,957
so no one man could steal
the gold by himself.

261
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,592
One key doesn't do us any good.

262
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,259
You ever get outside
when you were a kid?

263
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,327
I mean, how do you remember

264
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,929
all this shit?

265
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:17,397
Only one thing:

266
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:19,232
I already have
the captain's key.

267
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,468
Second one's in there.

268
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,738
The Augustine...
it's an auction house.

269
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,040
It's very exclusive,
but I got us on the list.

270
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,274
Look, all I need you to do is

271
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:28,643
kill the power
during the auction.

272
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:29,911
That'll trigger the main alarm,

273
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:31,278
- and then I can do my thing.
- Okay.

274
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,246
And how am I supposed
to kill the power?

275
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,983
Well, shit, that's up to you.
I mean, you got to bring

276
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,117
something to the equation.
I'm not cutting you in for fun.

277
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,285
Actually, that's a good point.

278
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:39,721
We haven't spoken
about my cut yet.

279
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:41,288
I assume we're 50-50, right?

280
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,657
Fifty-fif...?
On what, the gold?

281
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,992
- Yeah.
- Are you high?

282
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,459
You know this has been
years of my life?

283
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:46,661
You get ten percent,

284
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:48,796
- and that's me being generous.
- Wow.

285
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,999
That's awfully generous.

286
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,101
What are you gonna do
with that kind of money?

287
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:10,377
You still working on the tie?

288
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:11,879
I just can't figure out
the length.

289
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:13,514
I just keep making it all fat.

290
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:14,916
Come here.

291
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:17,885
You know what you're doing?

292
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,721
Yeah, my dad was a Navy man.

293
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:22,924
I could do this one-handed
with my eyes shut.

294
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:25,258
You served, too, didn't you?
Dishonorable discharge.

295
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,761
Hey, you did
some homework, huh?

296
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,896
- Of course I did.
- I flew helicopters.

297
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,232
I was preserving some artifacts
from a museum in Baghdad.

298
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,802
I was over the max load weight,
crashed pretty hard.

299
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:36,403
They got all upset,
kicked me out.

300
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:39,073
Bit of an overreaction,
but what are you gonna do?

301
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:41,274
You say "preserving,"

302
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,410
but you mean looting, right?

303
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:46,881
Well, if I didn't take 'em,
somebody else would've.

304
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:49,483
- You asked for that.
- Thank you.

305
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:50,952
And what's with the cat?

306
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:53,121
Oh, the cat?
She's just for you.

307
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,789
- What?
- Yeah.

308
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,389
Your life seemed super sad.

309
00:20:56,524 --> 00:20:59,227
No, no, no, I'm not gonna
keep this thing.

310
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,261
They're gonna shit
all over my floor.

311
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,638
- Hey, wait for me.
- Hey.

312
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:12,940
These people can tell a fake
when they see one, all right?

313
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:15,243
You have to believe
the lie you're selling.

314
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,410
You belong here.
You're one of them.

315
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,314
Or you can just go with
the Bubblicious. Jesus.

316
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,917
No, this is Bubble Yum.

317
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,786
It's the same thing.
Here, put that in your ear.

318
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:26,654
No way.

319
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:28,122
Hello?

320
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:30,625
- Hello?
- I can hear you.

321
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:32,126
I'm sitting right next to you.

322
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,662
Oh, shit, I think
I pushed it in too far.

323
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:38,199
- Is it okay?
- Let's go.

324
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:42,770
Oof.

325
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:44,404
Look at that car.

326
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:45,807
Bet that ain't cheap.

327
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,441
Shit. Santiago Moncada.

328
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:50,778
- Like the House of Moncada?
- Yeah.

329
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:52,379
He thinks the cross is his
by birthright.

330
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:54,215
If he buys it
before we can grab it,

331
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,284
you kiss that gold goodbye.

332
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:05,458
Welcome, sir.
What can I get you?

333
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:07,061
You know what,
I'll have a martini.

334
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,162
Yes, sir.

335
00:22:08,296 --> 00:22:10,665
- A martini?
- Yeah. Why not?

336
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:12,365
That'll go great
with the bubble gum.

337
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:15,770
You should actually put
the gum in the martini.

338
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:17,171
You'd have
a bubble gum martini.

339
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:19,307
- That's actually not a bad idea.
- Yeah.

340
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:23,911
My God, this girl is
totally flirting with me.

341
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:25,313
- Where?
- There.

342
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:26,681
The woman with Moncada.

343
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:28,216
Look, she's flirting
with me. Hi.

344
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:32,820
It's not flirting, all right?
Not with you.

345
00:22:32,954 --> 00:22:34,822
That is Jo Braddock.
You ever see her coming,

346
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:37,357
you need to run the other way.
I'm serious.

347
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:40,328
She's coming this way now.
Look.

348
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,163
Yeah, then you know what to do.

349
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:44,799
You'll thank me later.

350
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:57,410
Hello, Victor.

351
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:00,915
Oh, what's the matter?

352
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,184
Feelings still hurt
after San Sebastián?

353
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:05,485
You're something else.

354
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:09,924
So, what ridiculous scheme
have you cooked up this time?

355
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:12,593
Well, if I tell you,
it'll ruin the surprise.

356
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:16,597
Well, you do tend
to ruin everything, don't you?

357
00:23:16,731 --> 00:23:19,033
I'm not the one
working for Moncada.

358
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,434
I mean, that's low...
even for you, Jo.

359
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:24,305
Whatever gets me
the gold, right?

360
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,073
Well, you taught me that,
Victor.

361
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:38,152
<i>Increíble.</i>

362
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:39,553
Whoa, Jesus.

363
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:41,956
Oh, sorry.

364
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,158
It's pretty cool, huh?

365
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:49,063
Well, it's a one-of-a-kind
solid-gold altar crucifix.

366
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:51,933
Handcrafted in Barcelona
in the early 16th century,

367
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:54,969
so it's... yes, yeah,
it's pretty cool, yeah.

368
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,805
Wow. You know your crosses.

369
00:23:57,939 --> 00:24:00,942
My family has been looking for
this one for a very long time.

370
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:02,610
No way.

371
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:03,811
So have I.

372
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:05,379
Y-You are a collector?

373
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:07,048
I dabble.

374
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:08,950
I don't dabble.

375
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:12,520
This cross has
a very tragic history.

376
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:15,022
18 men died
trying to hold on to it.

377
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:17,892
So much blood
so needlessly spilled.

378
00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:20,828
Ladies and gentlemen,

379
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:22,730
if I could have
your attention, please.

380
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:24,231
Good luck to you.

381
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:25,967
Would you
please take your seats?

382
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,768
The auction will be
commencing very soon.

383
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:30,972
<i>Hey, Bubble Yum.</i>

384
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:33,274
You done chatting up
our archnemesis?

385
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:36,243
I'm pretty sure he just
threatened to kill me.

386
00:24:36,377 --> 00:24:39,447
Don't touch your ear like that.
You look like an idiot.

387
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,715
Get a move on.

388
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:42,350
Now, most of you

389
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,985
may be well aware
of the fact that...

390
00:24:44,118 --> 00:24:46,320
Gonna make my way upstairs.

391
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:47,655
...are made from some of

392
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:49,357
the most exciting items,

393
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,959
many of which
are exceedingly rare,

394
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:54,462
from our Spanish Renaissance
collection.

395
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,498
<i>Uh,
your girlfriend seems pissed.</i>

396
00:24:58,632 --> 00:24:59,834
Is that something
I should be worried about?

397
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:01,502
<i>Just stay focused.</i>

398
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:02,503
So, once again...

399
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,805
Keep an eye on him for me.

400
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:06,807
...if you would, please come

401
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:08,142
and take your seats.

402
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:10,144
Thank you very much.

403
00:25:18,452 --> 00:25:19,520
Excuse me.

404
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:29,330
Okay, let's get started, then,
with lot number one.

405
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:32,033
A magnificent oil on copper,

406
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:35,504
"Our Lady of Good Counsel"
by Bartolomé Pérez.

407
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:43,110
Hello?

408
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:53,220
600,000, going once,
going twice...

409
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:54,488
Sold to the lady in the back.

410
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:55,489
Thank you very much.

411
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:57,725
The cross is up next, kid.

412
00:25:57,858 --> 00:25:59,126
Um...

413
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,628
Sully, don't worry.

414
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:01,629
I got it.

415
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:03,964
Ow.

416
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:06,333
La Cruz de la Hermandad.

417
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:09,170
Now, most of you will know
this was made in Barcelona

418
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:10,539
circa 16th century.

419
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:12,507
It is truly a gorgeous piece

420
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,043
and representative of
Spanish Renaissance gold work.

421
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:20,448
So, we're gonna start off
tonight's bidding at 200,000.

422
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,183
Do I have 200,000 in the room?

423
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:23,784
Thank you very much.

424
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:26,620
I have an opening bid
of 200,000 from Mr. Moncada.

425
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:29,990
Okay. Here we go.

426
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:31,092
Do I hear four?

427
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,460
How we doing?

428
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:35,296
We're doing great.

429
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:36,931
500,000 it is. Do I have six?

430
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:39,100
I have six.
Thank you very much, madam.

431
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,734
- I don't have all night.
- Do I have seven?

432
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:43,304
700,000 from Mr. Moncada.

433
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:45,339
Do we have eight?

434
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,141
No takers?

435
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:49,276
So, fair warning on 700,000.

436
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,845
That is 700, going once...

437
00:26:50,978 --> 00:26:52,646
Don't make me do this.

438
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,049
...700, going twice.

439
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:56,817
And...

440
00:26:56,951 --> 00:26:59,153
There we are
at the back of the room.

441
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:02,189
Thank you very much, sir.
We have 800,000.

442
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:05,594
800,000 is the bid, ladies
and gentlemen. Do I have nine?

443
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:07,628
<i>I'm spending
money I don't have.</i>

444
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:09,964
Okay. Here goes nothing.

445
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:11,732
Oh, God!

446
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:14,135
Ya shouldnae come out to play
with the big boys, wee'un,

447
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:16,704
'cause you're about to get
a proper Scottish welcome.

448
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:20,207
I'm sorry?

449
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,647
Mr. Moncada,
it's back to you now... 1.9.

450
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,917
Mr. Moncada makes it
an even $2 million,

451
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,620
ladies and gentlemen.

452
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:34,655
Well, train's already left
the station, right? Why not?

453
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:36,123
2.1. Thank you
very much, indeed.

454
00:27:36,257 --> 00:27:38,192
Mr. Moncada, over to you.

455
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,027
Any advances on that?

456
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:42,863
2.2. We have 2.2,
ladies and gentlemen.

457
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:44,865
Oh, God, here she comes.

458
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:47,301
I said ya shouldnae come out
to play with the big boys,

459
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:49,703
wee'un, 'cause you're about to
get a proper Scottish welcome!

460
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:51,640
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

461
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:53,542
I literally have no idea
what you're saying.

462
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:55,676
You little...

463
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:01,382
2.2 is what we have.

464
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:03,585
Do I have 2.3? He goes with it.

465
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:07,488
Mr. Moncada takes it
to $3 million.

466
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:09,990
Stupid door.

467
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:14,195
Okay. Um...

468
00:28:14,328 --> 00:28:15,896
Oh, God.

469
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,199
Sully, I think you're just
gonna have to buy that cross.

470
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:20,901
Fair warning.

471
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:22,203
$3 million it is, going once...

472
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:23,572
You better do something now.

473
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:24,772
Kill the power,
fake a heart attack...

474
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:26,407
I don't give a shit.

475
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,075
...going twice...

476
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,145
And...

477
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:33,714
Ah, this is gonna suck!

478
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:36,551
Get back here!

479
00:28:36,685 --> 00:28:39,220
Get on him! Come on, come on!

480
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,255
Well, that was something.

481
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,592
- What's your plan now?
- Well, at least you fat-asses

482
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:45,025
can't come out here and get me.

483
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:46,260
There is a small situation,

484
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:47,728
but I'm sure
we'll have it sorted out

485
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:49,430
- in just a second.
- Come on, careful.

486
00:28:49,564 --> 00:28:50,864
Can we secure the cross, please?

487
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:52,366
- Thank you very much.
- Grab him

488
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:54,034
by the trousers
and get him by the balls!

489
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:55,269
Security, can you go down

490
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,037
and find out
exactly what's going on?

491
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:59,106
You're doing great.
Hang in there.

492
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,875
Oh... Oh, shit.

493
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:16,857
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

494
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,094
Hey, Trent, Addison wanted me

495
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:21,328
to take that
to the vault pronto.

496
00:29:21,462 --> 00:29:22,463
- Okay.
- Thanks.

497
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,270
Everybody, remain calm.

498
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:32,273
Sully, where you going?
You can't leave me.

499
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:33,974
There's only one rule
in this game, kid:

500
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:35,442
Don't get caught.

501
00:29:37,244 --> 00:29:39,780
Excuse me, sir. We need
to ask you a few questions.

502
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:41,482
I think that's a little rude.
I think I should be

503
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:43,083
asking you the questions,
if I'm honest.

504
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:44,552
Actually, you know what?
I'm-a do you one better.

505
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:46,787
I'm-a get my lawyer
to ask the questions,

506
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,490
starting with:
Who installed that handrail?

507
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:50,924
I mean, look at that thing.

508
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:52,359
- Hey!
- Hey, get back here! Hey!

509
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:02,803
Even more ridiculous
than I could have imagined.

510
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:04,905
I don't know. I think it was
going pretty well so far.

511
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,307
Funny.

512
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,941
I think that belongs to me.

513
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,310
Jo, come on.

514
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:11,312
Save it, Victor.

515
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:12,547
- Save...
- Oh, thank God.

516
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:15,182
Guys, she's trying
to steal the cross.

517
00:30:15,316 --> 00:30:17,985
Just put down the case
and step aside.

518
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:20,622
Yeah, put down my case.

519
00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:23,157
Step aside.

520
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,225
I'll get this
to where it belongs.

521
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,994
Good luck.

522
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:29,463
All right, lady.
Stay calm, all right?

523
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,535
Sorry sons of bitches.

524
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:49,350
All right, let's get
out of here, Tony.

525
00:30:49,483 --> 00:30:51,218
Hey. You surprised to see me?

526
00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:53,187
Well, you proved yourself
again, kid.

527
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,089
That was some swan dive
you took.

528
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:57,057
You were just gonna
leave me back there.

529
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:59,259
Well, it wouldn't do any good
having us both locked up.

530
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:00,894
Somebody had to get the cross.

531
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:03,030
Holy shit, you got it.

532
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:04,865
Hey, maybe I should
hold on to that for...

533
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:06,300
What, you don't trust me?

534
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:08,369
Oh, is that supposed
to be funny?

535
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:09,571
Here.

536
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:12,172
Tony, take us to Teterboro.

537
00:31:12,306 --> 00:31:14,007
Unless you want to get
dropped off somewhere else.

538
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:16,009
Oh, yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

539
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:17,378
Sorry, Sully, but I'm all in.

540
00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:20,013
Hey, Tony, Teterboro.

541
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:37,866
Wow.
Captain's journal. This is amazing.

542
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:39,567
There's some crazy shit in
there, huh?

543
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:42,136
It's unbelievable. I mean,
it totally confirms the legend.

544
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:44,572
Magellan did find tons of gold
in the Philippines.

545
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:46,206
They hid the gold in Barcelona

546
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,409
and then told the Moncadas
that the trip was a bust.

547
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:51,378
Okay, well, you have any bright
ideas on how to use the keys?

548
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:53,414
Yeah, here.
The captain wrote,

549
00:31:53,548 --> 00:31:57,117
"The path begins in Barcelona
where the keys turn into pine."

550
00:31:57,251 --> 00:32:01,188
And then there's a sketch here
of a pine tree. Here.

551
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:05,125
So we're looking for a tree.

552
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:08,897
- Really?
- Yeah.

553
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:11,365
Wow.
That's your expert analysis?

554
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:13,000
Well, you just gave me the book
like an hour ago.

555
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:14,234
What am I supposed to do?

556
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:16,236
I mean,
I got that far on my own.

557
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,573
I've seen the picture
of the tree. Where's the gold?

558
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:20,642
Is it under the tree?
Is it in the tree?

559
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:22,544
- I don't know. Could be.
- Look out the window.

560
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:24,913
There's a lot of trees
in Barcelona.

561
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:32,186
All right,
anything you need in Barcelona,

562
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,688
Chloe Frazer can get it.

563
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:35,723
I didn't tell her
about you yet, but she's cool.

564
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:37,224
Hey, Chlo.

565
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:38,459
Who the hell is this?

566
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:42,996
I'm Nate.
I'm a friend of Sully's.

567
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,866
Sully doesn't have any friends.

568
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:46,433
I should know.
I'm one of them.

569
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:47,836
That's not true.
People love me.

570
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,269
And what's with the spy games?

571
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:50,705
Why couldn't we meet
at the house?

572
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,306
I was making sure
you weren't followed.

573
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:54,975
Come on, you don't think
I can spot a tail?

574
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:56,644
Mate, I've been on you
since the airport.

575
00:32:56,778 --> 00:32:58,979
Really? All the way
from the airport?

576
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:00,113
Look, it doesn't matter.

577
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:02,216
Why is he here?

578
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:04,151
Why am I...?
Why are you here?

579
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:05,954
Clearly, you didn't tell him.

580
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:08,288
Chloe has the other cross.

581
00:33:08,422 --> 00:33:10,090
- What?
- Did I not mention that?

582
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:12,125
- No, you didn't.
- Are you sure? Well, look,

583
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:13,928
- it's mine, basically, all right?
- Okay.

584
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,329
So we're all gonna be
partners on this thing.

585
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:16,898
That's the way it's happening,
so get used to it.

586
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,733
No, we're not.

587
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:21,034
Look, word to the unwise...

588
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,837
everything
out of this one's mouth

589
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:24,873
is an exaggeration,
a half-truth

590
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:26,440
- or an outright lie.
- You know what?

591
00:33:26,574 --> 00:33:28,475
That is not true.

592
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,944
See ya, Sully.

593
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:32,881
That's... Come on, Chlo.

594
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,582
She'll come back.
She has to.

595
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,285
I don't think
she's coming back.

596
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:39,386
So?

597
00:33:39,521 --> 00:33:41,623
- Where's the cross?
- It's in my bag.

598
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:43,223
Check your bag. Do it now.

599
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:45,025
Shit.

600
00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:51,231
You let her take the cross?
You let her take the cross.

601
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:54,468
- Shit.
- You better get that cross back!

602
00:33:54,602 --> 00:33:56,470
You got to be kidding me.
What a rookie mistake.

603
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:14,421
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!

604
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:16,490
- Could you move any slower?!
- I got a bad ankle, kid.

605
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:18,392
I can't be
running around out here.

606
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,903
Oh, shit!

607
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:34,207
Move!

608
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:36,343
Out of the way!
Move, move, move!

609
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:38,580
Move!

610
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:07,775
Listen! You don't know where
you're going with them keys!

611
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:09,811
Look, you're looking
for a tree, right?

612
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:11,411
Piss off.

613
00:35:11,546 --> 00:35:13,480
Listen to me.

614
00:35:13,615 --> 00:35:16,116
The 18 were willing to wait
years to go back for the gold.

615
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:18,118
They wouldn't have picked
a tree as a marker.

616
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:20,487
They would have picked
something more permanent.

617
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:22,090
You're full of shit.

618
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:23,825
Hey.

619
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,158
Let her go.

620
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:26,628
She knows where
to use the keys,

621
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:28,195
then she doesn't need us,
right?

622
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:30,197
Okay. Be my guest.
Get out of here.

623
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,666
Thank you.

624
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,301
Bye.

625
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:46,080
If it's not a tree, what is it?

626
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:49,017
At the auction house, Moncada
called it an "altar crucifix."

627
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:51,451
I didn't think about it then,
but it means that the cross

628
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,453
was originally made
to stand on an altar.

629
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:56,891
In a church.

630
00:35:58,191 --> 00:35:59,292
Which church?

631
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:00,795
God, you guys never stop,
do you?

632
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:02,530
Look, if we want
to get the gold,

633
00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:05,033
we're gonna have to figure out
a way to trust each other.

634
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,935
So give me the key.

635
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:13,340
Which church?

636
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:17,645
Santa Maria del Pi.

637
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:19,947
Saint Mary of the Pine.

638
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:21,481
This has to be it.

639
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:23,483
You might just be a genius.

640
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:24,986
"Genius" is a stretch.

641
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:27,889
Oh, yeah? Look at that.

642
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:29,557
Now you know why I brought him.

643
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:31,425
Hmm.

644
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,062
Okay. Good work.

645
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,864
I'll go see when we might have
a private look inside.

646
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:43,236
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't even think about it.

647
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,906
- What?
- Well, you don't catch on

648
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,874
too quick, do you?
She's not to be trusted.

649
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:48,241
You met her for two minutes,

650
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:50,243
she already stole
the cross from you.

651
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:52,180
She's coming back.

652
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:53,748
There's a midnight mass
tonight,

653
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,750
so tomorrow's the earliest
we can poke around.

654
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,417
You got our gear at the
house, right?

655
00:36:57,552 --> 00:36:58,753
Yeah. Come on.

656
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:04,357
Father.

657
00:37:06,027 --> 00:37:08,129
You said we were going to
discuss this.

658
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:10,932
I changed my mind.

659
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:13,101
I'm allowed.

660
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:18,405
It's not yours to give.

661
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:22,110
You built none of it - they did.

662
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:24,112
Our fortune is dipped in blood.

663
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:28,482
And giving it all away
will release that stain?

664
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:35,322
I should have cut you off
years ago.

665
00:37:43,898 --> 00:37:45,967
Ms. Braddock.

666
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,203
Welcome to Barcelona
as my ancestors knew it.

667
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:50,705
Quite something, isn't it?

668
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:53,473
Yes, it's truly
an impressive excavation.

669
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:55,243
Yeah.

670
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:58,946
This competitor of yours,
Victor Sullivan...

671
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,915
maybe he's the one
I should have hired.

672
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:03,251
Victor Sullivan is
a liar and a fraud.

673
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:05,186
Any deal you make with him
is worthless.

674
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:07,354
Perhaps.

675
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:09,356
But I've been told, uh,

676
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:12,492
he was seen
in the Barrio Gótico.

677
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:15,263
Maybe you should look into it.

678
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:16,597
Yes, sir.

679
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:19,167
Good.

680
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:35,116
I found my cross
in a crypt in Genoa,

681
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:37,718
but I didn't know it was a key
to a much bigger fortune.

682
00:38:37,852 --> 00:38:39,020
Sully knew.

683
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:43,157
Doesn't say what happens
after we turn the keys.

684
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:45,626
"Trust in your fellow man,
for one will

685
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,795
go to heaven
and the other to hell."

686
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:49,931
Well, it's ironic,

687
00:38:50,064 --> 00:38:52,633
seeing as the only point
in having two keys

688
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:55,269
was that the 18
didn't trust each other.

689
00:38:55,402 --> 00:38:58,639
Well, good thing they didn't,
or we wouldn't be here, right?

690
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:01,374
Like one big happy family.

691
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:03,077
Toast?

692
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:04,579
All right.

693
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:07,515
<i>Arriba, abajo,
al centro y pa' dentro.</i>

694
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,288
Hey, kid, slow down.

695
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:16,324
That's a vintage rioja,
all right?

696
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:19,527
You might want to just
taste it, savor it.

697
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,964
Or chug it down
like you're on spring break.

698
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:24,298
All good.

699
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:29,003
I'm onto you, you know.

700
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:32,240
Sully.

701
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:34,842
What?

702
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:37,178
He's Sam's brother, isn't he?

703
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:39,747
Oh, wow, you cracked the case.
Great job.

704
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:41,381
Does he know what happened?

705
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:42,516
Not yet.

706
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,118
I-I'm gonna tell him.

707
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:46,053
When?

708
00:39:46,187 --> 00:39:47,755
Who's still thirsty?

709
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:49,357
I found another bottle of red.

710
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:51,726
Hey, kid, you think she's okay?

711
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,762
- Who?
- My cat.

712
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:56,264
You have a cat?

713
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:58,065
The man from the app said
he was gonna feed her,

714
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,700
but he didn't text me back yet.

715
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:01,702
I don't know what's cuter...
your concern

716
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:03,971
or the fact that you just said
"the man from the app."

717
00:40:04,105 --> 00:40:05,940
Stop.

718
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:20,221
Do you come here to
ruin the one place I find peace?

719
00:40:21,322 --> 00:40:22,590
Father,

720
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:25,593
you can't
give it away.

721
00:40:26,727 --> 00:40:29,130
Tell me it's not too late.

722
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:31,799
You can't change my mind.

723
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,269
I'm making the arrangements.

724
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:40,141
This scavenger hunt is over.

725
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,248
<i>Padre.</i>

726
00:40:48,616 --> 00:40:51,152
Do you really
have no faith in me?

727
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:55,623
In Him I have faith.

728
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:12,707
Who the hell are you?

729
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,874
Get out of my car!

730
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:18,679
Santiago, what are you doing?

731
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:22,783
Forgive me,

732
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,118
Father.

733
00:41:37,098 --> 00:41:38,532
Oh, great.

734
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:42,837
Nuns. Why's it always
got to be nuns?

735
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:46,640
All right, let's just split up
and figure out

736
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:48,042
where the keys go, huh?

737
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,510
Okay.

738
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,879
<i>Never
thought I'd be back in church,</i>

739
00:42:25,012 --> 00:42:26,547
<i>but this one's special.</i>

740
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:29,216
Hey, Sully.

741
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,018
What?

742
00:42:33,054 --> 00:42:34,088
Nothing.

743
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,935
Hey, guys.

744
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:49,270
Come here.

745
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,907
Look.

746
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,109
"JSE."

747
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,277
Juan Sebastián Elcano.

748
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,113
The 18 were here all right.

749
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:01,849
Look, if that's the cathedral,

750
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:04,585
then these must be the stairs,

751
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:06,754
and they lead...

752
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:08,422
that way.

753
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:28,909
Thoughts, altar boy?

754
00:43:31,513 --> 00:43:36,450
<i>"Caelum."</i> That's,
um, Latin for "heaven."

755
00:43:36,585 --> 00:43:38,520
Says in the journal,
"Trust in your fellow man,

756
00:43:38,652 --> 00:43:40,988
for one shall go to heaven,
the other to hell."

757
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:43,457
So, if heaven's up there,

758
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:45,926
then hell has to be
around here somewhere.

759
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,461
I hope.

760
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:57,606
Hey, I got a skeleton
with angel wings.

761
00:43:57,738 --> 00:43:59,974
That's kind of between
heaven and hell, right?

762
00:44:04,445 --> 00:44:07,448
Does Mary look
a little off to you?

763
00:44:08,749 --> 00:44:09,984
Yeah.

764
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:11,652
No way.

765
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:15,990
Hey. Come on, open it up.

766
00:44:16,123 --> 00:44:17,992
I'm not gonna do that.
We're in a church, man.

767
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,393
Come on, have some respect.

768
00:44:19,528 --> 00:44:21,195
Scared of a little old nun?

769
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:22,963
Well, you haven't met
Sister B, have you?

770
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:25,699
Hold that.

771
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,168
Here.

772
00:44:36,611 --> 00:44:37,845
Okay.

773
00:44:43,017 --> 00:44:44,151
Well, there's hell.

774
00:44:44,285 --> 00:44:45,587
Whoa!

775
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:47,656
Holy shit. You found 'em.

776
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:50,424
Hey, what does that
look like to you?

777
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,660
A keyhole.

778
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,037
Wait, which way should we turn,
left or right?

779
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,172
I don't know.
Uh, what does the book say?

780
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:09,243
Um... oh, right here.

781
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:10,645
Both-both of you, uh,

782
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:14,014
turn your keys clockwise
at the same time.

783
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:17,384
Three, two, one.

784
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:18,852
Turn.

785
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:21,590
Shit!

786
00:45:24,526 --> 00:45:26,595
Thanks a lot.
You almost got me killed.

787
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:28,028
Clockwise, Sully?

788
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:30,064
Well, it was 50-50,
so I made a guess.

789
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:32,233
A guess?
That could've been our heads!

790
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:33,901
Well, clearly, you should turn
the keys the other way.

791
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:35,035
Kid, I don't even
have my glasses.

792
00:45:35,169 --> 00:45:36,203
I can't read this shit.

793
00:45:36,337 --> 00:45:37,404
Yeah, clearly.

794
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:38,906
Just be careful, all right?

795
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,007
You're gonna get
somebody killed.

796
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,008
Okay, come on.

797
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:42,009
Counterclockwise.

798
00:45:42,142 --> 00:45:43,244
Just look away from it.

799
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:46,747
Ready? Here we go.

800
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,148
Three, two, one.

801
00:45:48,282 --> 00:45:49,817
Turn.

802
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,318
Whoa!

803
00:45:53,787 --> 00:45:56,357
Look at that. I was right
the second time, huh?

804
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,926
Like, an opening back here.

805
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:00,729
You want to help, Sully?

806
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:02,029
Oh, kid, I'm watching our back.

807
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:04,431
What if the nun comes down
to get you?

808
00:46:04,566 --> 00:46:06,367
Chloe?

809
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:08,435
There you go.

810
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:13,073
All right,
we're making some progress.

811
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:14,174
- Let's go.
- No, wait.

812
00:46:14,308 --> 00:46:16,343
Hang on.
What does the book say?

813
00:46:16,477 --> 00:46:19,113
Uh, heaven and hell. One of us
goes up, the other goes down.

814
00:46:19,246 --> 00:46:21,015
- Exactly. I'll go down.
- Yeah, I'll come with you.

815
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:22,483
- Really?
- What?

816
00:46:22,617 --> 00:46:24,251
- Well, that was quick.
- What are you talking about?

817
00:46:24,385 --> 00:46:25,587
What, are you just gonna

818
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,755
follow her down there
like a puppy dog?

819
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:27,988
What, you want me
to come with you,

820
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:29,256
- hold your hand?
- You know what?

821
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,692
It's fine. Give me your cross.

822
00:46:30,824 --> 00:46:31,992
Not giving you my cross.
Why would I do that?

823
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:33,662
'Cause I'm probably gonna
need it up there.

824
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:35,229
You have your girlfriend's
cross, don't you?

825
00:46:35,362 --> 00:46:37,565
You don't need 'em both.

826
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:39,400
Okay, good point.
Well, give me your phone.

827
00:46:39,534 --> 00:46:40,934
- No.
- Sully, just give me your phone.

828
00:46:41,068 --> 00:46:42,303
- For what?
- What, you don't trust me?

829
00:46:42,436 --> 00:46:43,505
I don't trust anybody.

830
00:46:43,638 --> 00:46:44,673
I thought
I told you that already.

831
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:46,040
Thank you.

832
00:46:46,173 --> 00:46:48,108
I thought you knew better.

833
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:49,376
Oh, my God.

834
00:46:49,511 --> 00:46:50,712
You have so many apps open.

835
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:52,179
What is wrong with you?

836
00:46:53,682 --> 00:46:55,049
Tinder?

837
00:46:55,182 --> 00:46:57,985
- Really?
- I-I own that.

838
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:00,921
Okay. Now you can track us.

839
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:03,857
Try and stay
on top of us, okay?

840
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:06,093
- There you go.
- Have fun in the haunted tunnel.

841
00:47:06,226 --> 00:47:07,328
- Yeah.
- Enjoy.

842
00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:09,330
Oh, we will.

843
00:47:16,805 --> 00:47:18,506
<i>This is amazing.</i>

844
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,208
<i>I mean, we're the first ones
down here in 500 years.</i>

845
00:47:24,978 --> 00:47:26,480
Find the other two.

846
00:47:26,614 --> 00:47:28,148
I've got Sully.

847
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:29,684
Aye.

848
00:47:45,132 --> 00:47:46,867
Hey, I got an arrow
pointing this way.

849
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,435
The Eye of Providence.

850
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,104
I say we go with God.

851
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:52,272
But there's literally an arrow
that points this way.

852
00:47:52,406 --> 00:47:54,241
Suit yourself.

853
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,678
But the arrow.

854
00:47:56,811 --> 00:47:58,412
I'm gonna go this way.

855
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:04,051
Yeah, we should go your way.
We should go your way.

856
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:10,725
Um...

857
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:13,728
Ah, great. Here we go again.

858
00:48:13,862 --> 00:48:15,996
Do you want to work your magic?

859
00:48:18,132 --> 00:48:21,969
So, uh, when did you decide
to become Indiana Jones?

860
00:48:23,505 --> 00:48:26,073
When I was a kid,
I liked to go exploring.

861
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:31,245
One day, I found
a bronze statue covered in gems

862
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:33,414
buried under a bridge.

863
00:48:33,548 --> 00:48:36,049
I'll never forget the feeling,
you know?

864
00:48:36,183 --> 00:48:38,085
I ran and showed it
to my father.

865
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:41,623
I thought he'd put it
in a museum.

866
00:48:41,756 --> 00:48:43,457
But instead, he sold it.

867
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:46,293
He kept all the money.

868
00:48:46,427 --> 00:48:48,195
We never saw him again.

869
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:51,098
Wow, that sucks. I'm sorry.

870
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:53,802
Why? I'm better for it.

871
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:57,772
Here. I got just the tool.

872
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:01,408
You see that?

873
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:03,977
Sure, when the big bad nun's
not around.

874
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,452
Does this look right to you?

875
00:49:11,586 --> 00:49:13,454
Well, I don't really know
what the path

876
00:49:13,588 --> 00:49:15,890
to ancient treasure's
supposed to look like.

877
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:18,225
- More ancient?
- I guess.

878
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:20,994
Hey, Sully, do you see
anything weird up there?

879
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,665
You're gonna have
to be more specific.

880
00:49:29,904 --> 00:49:31,338
Do you hear that?

881
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:39,112
What the hell?

882
00:49:46,554 --> 00:49:49,156
<i>Hey,
what's going on down there?</i>

883
00:49:50,825 --> 00:49:53,160
Hey, this can't be right,
can it?

884
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:55,329
<i>I can't hear one
thing you're saying.</i>

885
00:49:55,462 --> 00:49:56,898
Come on, let's go.

886
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,566
Yeah, this definitely
doesn't look right.

887
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,869
Look, above the bar.

888
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:03,136
<i>"Infernum."</i>
Isn't that Latin for "hell"?

889
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,639
Yeah, it is. Come on.

890
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:07,207
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

891
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:09,276
- It's Braddock's backup.
- What?

892
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:11,144
We better keep moving.

893
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:15,015
- What are you doing?
- Blending in.

894
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:16,718
Yeah, it's not a bad idea.

895
00:50:16,851 --> 00:50:20,187
Hey, listen, I'm not really
much of a dancer.

896
00:50:21,756 --> 00:50:23,691
- Let's go.
- Okay.

897
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:40,140
Hey, two Commonwealths.

898
00:50:40,274 --> 00:50:41,576
Okay.

899
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:46,346
What are you doing?

900
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,982
I'm causing a distraction.

901
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:51,218
Oh, for God's sake.

902
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,062
Do you think
it's another puzzle?

903
00:51:03,998 --> 00:51:06,433
Well, whatever it is,
you better figure it out fast.

904
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:08,870
I'm-a try and buy us some time.

905
00:51:09,003 --> 00:51:12,006
- Hey, can I get you a drink?
- Gin and tonic, <i>por favor.</i>

906
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:13,708
This definitely
isn't a gin and tonic,

907
00:51:13,841 --> 00:51:14,709
but it is on the house.

908
00:51:14,842 --> 00:51:16,076
<i>Gracias.</i>

909
00:51:16,209 --> 00:51:18,445
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
let me guess.

910
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:21,716
Piña colada?

911
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:30,490
The Eye.

912
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,627
You think you're a comedian,
do you, sunshine?

913
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,795
Okay, I got it, I got it.

914
00:51:33,928 --> 00:51:35,429
Sex on the Beach.

915
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:45,607
Nate!

916
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,809
Oh, shit.

917
00:51:47,942 --> 00:51:50,310
Nate, this is not a time
for shots. Let's go!

918
00:51:56,884 --> 00:51:58,820
God, those guys suck.

919
00:52:00,153 --> 00:52:01,990
Where the hell are we?

920
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:07,996
Well, well, well.

921
00:52:14,102 --> 00:52:15,570
Look for a way out.

922
00:52:16,938 --> 00:52:18,840
Think I found one.

923
00:52:32,185 --> 00:52:33,487
Uh, almost caught up.

924
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:37,457
Hey, you got that key?

925
00:52:37,592 --> 00:52:38,826
Yeah.

926
00:52:57,078 --> 00:52:58,846
- Water.
- A lot of water.

927
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:02,482
Oh, my God.

928
00:53:02,617 --> 00:53:04,852
Um, this has to be a test.

929
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:06,253
The 18 must have built
an escape, right?

930
00:53:06,386 --> 00:53:07,555
What did the journal say again?

931
00:53:07,689 --> 00:53:09,389
Uh, it said,
"Trust in your fellow man,

932
00:53:09,524 --> 00:53:11,159
for one shall go to heaven,
the other to hell."

933
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:12,727
"Trust in your fellow man,
for one..."

934
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,428
- Sully!
- Sully! Uh, Sully!

935
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:15,863
There has to be another keyhole

936
00:53:15,997 --> 00:53:17,297
up there somewhere
that opens this door!

937
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:22,904
I'm, like, literally
in a Papa Johns right now.

938
00:53:23,037 --> 00:53:25,073
<i>Sully,
we're running out of time!</i>

939
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:26,741
I found it.

940
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:30,178
Excuse me, guys.

941
00:53:32,146 --> 00:53:33,380
I'm gonna need a minute.

942
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:36,450
<i>Sully, we do not have a minute!</i>

943
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:45,727
Hand it over, Victor.

944
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,360
Oh, shit!

945
00:53:47,494 --> 00:53:48,663
Give me the cross.

946
00:53:48,796 --> 00:53:50,430
Come on, Jo.

947
00:53:50,565 --> 00:53:52,033
You know I can't do that.

948
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:55,036
You haven't said "please."

949
00:53:55,169 --> 00:53:56,236
Now.

950
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,039
Okay.

951
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,782
Didn't I tell you
you should've said "please"?

952
00:54:07,915 --> 00:54:11,318
Oh, come on, Sully.
After all we've been through?

953
00:54:14,454 --> 00:54:16,323
Sully! Hurry!

954
00:54:16,456 --> 00:54:18,226
Shut up. I'm working on it.

955
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:19,961
<i>I'll shut up when you get us</i>

956
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:21,461
<i>the hell out of here.</i>

957
00:54:21,596 --> 00:54:24,031
Oh, sh...

958
00:54:24,165 --> 00:54:26,266
<i>What's going on?!</i>

959
00:54:26,399 --> 00:54:28,536
Sully,
if you don't turn that damn key,

960
00:54:28,669 --> 00:54:30,071
we're gonna drown.

961
00:54:30,204 --> 00:54:32,439
It's gonna take a little longer
than I thought, kid.

962
00:54:36,644 --> 00:54:38,179
You got to help me.

963
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:39,614
Gonna try to get
this grate up, okay?

964
00:54:39,747 --> 00:54:40,782
Okay.

965
00:54:51,424 --> 00:54:54,427
I can't believe you walked out
on me, you son of a bitch.

966
00:54:54,562 --> 00:54:56,496
Why? Did you miss me?

967
00:55:01,536 --> 00:55:03,504
Sully!
It's now or never, buddy!

968
00:55:03,638 --> 00:55:05,106
We're running out
of options down here!

969
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:07,175
Nate, look at me.

970
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:08,776
- We can do this.
- Okay.

971
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:10,477
- We can do this.
- Deep breaths.

972
00:55:24,192 --> 00:55:26,828
Did you miss this, Victor? Hmm?

973
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:57,024
Chloe!

974
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:12,372
Chloe.

975
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:16,077
Chloe, please. Come on!

976
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,083
Okay.

977
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:23,517
It's okay.

978
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:25,385
Here, I'm gonna lift you out.

979
00:56:28,723 --> 00:56:30,224
Hey, guys. Say something.

980
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:31,859
Tell me you're alive.

981
00:56:31,993 --> 00:56:33,227
<i>Yeah, we're good.</i>

982
00:56:33,361 --> 00:56:35,730
We're still alive.

983
00:56:35,863 --> 00:56:37,932
All right, then what are you
waiting for? Get a move on.

984
00:56:41,335 --> 00:56:42,203
Thank you.

985
00:56:42,336 --> 00:56:43,905
You had it.

986
00:56:44,038 --> 00:56:45,940
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

987
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:12,600
- You good?
- Yeah.

988
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:14,402
Hey, Sully, you still up there?

989
00:57:14,535 --> 00:57:16,070
<i>I'm here. What do you got?</i>

990
00:57:16,203 --> 00:57:18,438
Not much.
It's dark as hell in here.

991
00:57:25,413 --> 00:57:28,249
I always wanted to try this.

992
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:30,450
You need to give
that thing up already.

993
00:57:30,584 --> 00:57:32,386
Oh, come on.

994
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,288
Ha.

995
00:57:34,422 --> 00:57:35,756
See? That's all I ask.

996
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,058
Little faith.

997
00:57:45,766 --> 00:57:48,502
I see a light. Is that you?

998
00:57:48,636 --> 00:57:49,937
Yeah, that's us.

999
00:57:50,071 --> 00:57:52,139
We're in some sort of...

1000
00:57:52,273 --> 00:57:54,175
Roman antechamber.

1001
00:57:55,443 --> 00:57:56,577
Whoa.

1002
00:58:03,884 --> 00:58:05,619
Hey, you got that key?

1003
00:58:08,723 --> 00:58:10,124
Thank you.

1004
00:58:10,257 --> 00:58:11,292
Okay.

1005
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:17,131
No, it doesn't fit.

1006
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:20,134
Sully.

1007
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:22,336
Okay.

1008
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,538
Sully, we're missing something.

1009
00:58:24,672 --> 00:58:26,440
See if you can find
anything up there.

1010
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:28,342
I can't get the grate up.

1011
00:58:28,476 --> 00:58:30,177
Forget the grate and look.

1012
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:33,547
I see something.

1013
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:37,651
Looks like a ladder
or something.

1014
00:58:40,454 --> 00:58:42,890
I think I get it.

1015
00:58:43,024 --> 00:58:44,859
I think it's the two keys
put together.

1016
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:46,360
<i>What?</i>

1017
00:58:46,494 --> 00:58:48,596
I said I think it's
the two keys put together.

1018
00:58:48,729 --> 00:58:50,264
Throw your key down!

1019
00:58:50,398 --> 00:58:52,199
Hey. You two think
you're gonna double-cross me?

1020
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:54,568
Hey, Sully, you want the stupid
key, or you want the gold?

1021
00:58:54,702 --> 00:58:56,337
Come on, this is it.
Throw it down.

1022
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:58,039
I'm coming down there for this.

1023
00:58:58,172 --> 00:58:59,407
You hear me?

1024
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,675
You ain't gonna play me.

1025
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:03,077
Typical Sully.

1026
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,578
He'd rather
lose the gold than...

1027
00:59:10,184 --> 00:59:11,585
Thank you.

1028
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:21,028
Does that look
like a ladder to you?

1029
00:59:21,162 --> 00:59:22,563
Yeah.

1030
00:59:33,374 --> 00:59:34,509
Okay, ready?

1031
00:59:34,642 --> 00:59:38,045
Three, two, one.

1032
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:44,218
Did you see that?

1033
00:59:48,689 --> 00:59:50,257
What are you waiting for?

1034
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:52,393
Whoa. What the...?

1035
00:59:54,195 --> 00:59:56,263
- <i>What's happening?</i>
- We found it.

1036
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,708
<i>Is the gold there? Talk to me.</i>

1037
01:00:07,842 --> 01:00:09,743
We're in an old
Roman storehouse.

1038
01:00:11,513 --> 01:00:13,314
It's got to be
at least 2,000 years old,

1039
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:17,284
and there are these giant urns
that are like eight feet tall.

1040
01:00:17,418 --> 01:00:19,086
<i>Are they intact?</i>

1041
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,921
Yeah, they're perfectly
preserved.

1042
01:00:21,055 --> 01:00:23,924
So, what are you waiting for?
Open them up and get the gold.

1043
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:28,696
Give me a lift.

1044
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:32,666
Here we go.
Three, two, one. Go.

1045
01:00:36,403 --> 01:00:37,738
Okay. Are you okay?

1046
01:00:37,872 --> 01:00:39,840
Yeah, yeah.

1047
01:00:39,974 --> 01:00:41,675
Okay.

1048
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:45,279
Okay.

1049
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:47,348
- You good?
- Yeah.

1050
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,049
You see anything?

1051
01:00:55,823 --> 01:00:58,159
Uh...

1052
01:00:58,292 --> 01:01:00,161
Chloe?

1053
01:01:00,294 --> 01:01:01,630
Salt.

1054
01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:04,431
Chloe? I think
we have a problem.

1055
01:01:04,566 --> 01:01:06,333
Chloe?

1056
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:09,136
They used salt
to store food, but...

1057
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,338
I don't know why they'd put...

1058
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:22,483
- <i>What's happening?</i>
- No.

1059
01:01:23,618 --> 01:01:25,019
It's got to be here.

1060
01:01:26,387 --> 01:01:28,590
Yeah, or why all the tricks?

1061
01:01:28,722 --> 01:01:30,057
Answer me, guys.
What do you got?

1062
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:32,326
The gold's not here.

1063
01:01:49,076 --> 01:01:50,377
Oh, my God.

1064
01:01:50,512 --> 01:01:52,413
<i>What? What is it?</i>

1065
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,520
They never brought it back.

1066
01:01:58,653 --> 01:02:01,623
The path to the gold
starts here in Barcelona,

1067
01:02:01,755 --> 01:02:05,059
but it ends somewhere over here
in the East Indies.

1068
01:02:05,192 --> 01:02:06,393
Hey, Chloe.

1069
01:02:06,528 --> 01:02:07,662
Give it to me.

1070
01:02:09,664 --> 01:02:10,998
You're kidding, right?

1071
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:13,501
I'm not getting screwed
on this one.

1072
01:02:13,635 --> 01:02:16,337
Pick up the map
and give it to me.

1073
01:02:21,942 --> 01:02:23,978
Nate, what's going on
down there?

1074
01:02:24,111 --> 01:02:25,779
Slowly.

1075
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:28,148
<i>Hey, tell me what's happening.</i>

1076
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:31,118
Sully, I got this.

1077
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:32,621
Look, you don't
have to do this, okay?

1078
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:34,421
Don't...

1079
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:36,056
try anything.

1080
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,925
You can trust me.

1081
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,262
Just put the gun down.

1082
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,469
You have no idea who
you're partnered with, do you?

1083
01:02:48,603 --> 01:02:50,572
You don't even really know
what went down.

1084
01:02:50,705 --> 01:02:52,773
Went down with what?

1085
01:02:57,712 --> 01:02:59,079
Sam.

1086
01:02:59,213 --> 01:03:00,848
Who do you think?

1087
01:03:00,981 --> 01:03:02,416
What are you talking about?

1088
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:03,417
Ask Sully.

1089
01:03:03,551 --> 01:03:05,654
No, no, no, no, no. No.

1090
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:08,489
Chloe, please tell me
what happened to my brother.

1091
01:03:09,624 --> 01:03:10,924
Please.

1092
01:03:12,694 --> 01:03:14,962
You're a good guy, Nate.

1093
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:27,274
Too good.

1094
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:46,960
Hey, Nate.

1095
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:48,763
Wake up.

1096
01:03:50,397 --> 01:03:52,634
Got you pretty good, huh?

1097
01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:54,301
I tried to warn you about her,

1098
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:56,805
but you didn't want
to listen, did you?

1099
01:03:59,106 --> 01:04:01,710
What happened to my brother?

1100
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:04,211
Stop thinking of the next lie
you're gonna tell me.

1101
01:04:06,947 --> 01:04:08,683
Where's Sam, Sully?

1102
01:04:13,854 --> 01:04:15,824
I should've told you before.

1103
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:19,159
But your brother...

1104
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:20,662
he's gone, kid.

1105
01:04:20,795 --> 01:04:23,330
No, he's not.
You said he ghosted you.

1106
01:04:23,464 --> 01:04:26,033
He's gone.
He didn't ghost me.

1107
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:28,268
We went down to
the captain's tomb together

1108
01:04:28,402 --> 01:04:29,838
to find the journal.

1109
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:33,107
And it was there, right where
Sam said it would be.

1110
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,242
We were on our way out,
and Braddock and her guys,

1111
01:04:35,376 --> 01:04:37,244
they cut us off.

1112
01:04:37,378 --> 01:04:39,046
They opened fire, and...

1113
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:40,682
and Sam got shot.

1114
01:04:40,815 --> 01:04:42,517
So you just
left him there to die.

1115
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,318
I saw a way out, so I took it.

1116
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:46,186
So you just
left him there to die.

1117
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,088
What was I supposed to do,
get shot, too?

1118
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:49,490
Nothing I could do.

1119
01:04:49,624 --> 01:04:51,659
How could you not tell me this?

1120
01:04:51,793 --> 01:04:53,828
Well, I knew if I told you, you
never would've come with me.

1121
01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:55,429
And why is that
so important, huh?

1122
01:04:55,563 --> 01:04:58,098
The hell am I doing here
and not somebody else?

1123
01:04:58,232 --> 01:05:00,869
Your brother believed
that there was a final piece.

1124
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:02,871
All right?
A last trick the 18 played.

1125
01:05:03,003 --> 01:05:04,371
I thought maybe
he said something to you

1126
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:06,039
or sent you something.
I mean, shit, all he ever did

1127
01:05:06,173 --> 01:05:07,609
- was talk about you.
- So that's what this is about.

1128
01:05:07,742 --> 01:05:09,276
You dragged me
all the way out here,

1129
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,311
let me believe that I might
see my brother again

1130
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:13,715
because you think
that I know something?

1131
01:05:13,848 --> 01:05:15,550
Yeah.

1132
01:05:15,683 --> 01:05:17,184
Do you?

1133
01:05:18,887 --> 01:05:21,021
Did you really
just ask me that?

1134
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:25,225
You said that money
changes people...

1135
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,694
makes them greedy,
makes them selfish...

1136
01:05:26,828 --> 01:05:27,928
but you know what I think?

1137
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:29,496
I think that's just
who you are.

1138
01:05:29,631 --> 01:05:32,232
I don't think there was ever
a better version of you.

1139
01:05:32,366 --> 01:05:34,234
And whatever this is...

1140
01:05:34,368 --> 01:05:36,069
now I'm done.

1141
01:05:40,207 --> 01:05:41,609
Kid.

1142
01:05:53,387 --> 01:05:54,889
Mr. Moncada.

1143
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:58,258
We've run into
some difficulties.

1144
01:05:58,392 --> 01:06:00,127
The gold was never here
beneath the city.

1145
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,429
Yeah, I know.

1146
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:04,298
It's quite embarrassing, huh?

1147
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:06,166
I believe there was a clue
left down there,

1148
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,770
and we know who has it:
a Miss Chloe Frazer.

1149
01:06:08,903 --> 01:06:10,471
My people are out
looking for her now...

1150
01:06:10,605 --> 01:06:13,440
Oh, you mean the big guy
who doesn't talk

1151
01:06:13,575 --> 01:06:15,275
and his sidekick,
the Highlander?

1152
01:06:15,409 --> 01:06:17,812
Yeah, they didn't find me.

1153
01:06:17,946 --> 01:06:20,949
Diversified investment.

1154
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:25,452
I hired Miss Frazer
the same day I hired you.

1155
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:29,490
Of course, she will lead
the operation from here on out.

1156
01:06:53,413 --> 01:06:55,984
<i>I haven't forgotten my promise.</i>

1157
01:06:59,453 --> 01:07:01,890
<i>Remember, if something's lost,</i>

1158
01:07:02,022 --> 01:07:03,758
<i>it can be found.</i>

1159
01:07:07,562 --> 01:07:09,764
I know where she took the map.

1160
01:07:10,899 --> 01:07:12,099
Moncada.

1161
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:13,935
Right? I mean, think about it.

1162
01:07:14,067 --> 01:07:16,004
Who else is gonna have
the resources she's gonna need?

1163
01:07:16,136 --> 01:07:17,639
And Braddock and her goon squad

1164
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:19,507
just so happened to find us
at the church?

1165
01:07:19,641 --> 01:07:22,510
He had to have somebody
on the inside.

1166
01:07:22,644 --> 01:07:24,478
You hate me.
All right, I get it.

1167
01:07:24,612 --> 01:07:26,714
Look, I'd hate me, too.

1168
01:07:26,848 --> 01:07:30,484
But Braddock, after what
she did to your brother?

1169
01:07:30,618 --> 01:07:31,753
She shot him in cold blood.

1170
01:07:31,886 --> 01:07:33,053
All right?
We can't let her win. She...

1171
01:07:33,186 --> 01:07:34,789
Oh, Sully,
will you please just stop

1172
01:07:34,923 --> 01:07:37,124
trying to play me
for like five minutes?

1173
01:07:39,259 --> 01:07:42,195
For years, I told myself
that Sam would come back.

1174
01:07:43,831 --> 01:07:46,199
That he wasn't gone,
that he was just lost.

1175
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:49,037
But instead,
I'm stuck here with you,

1176
01:07:49,169 --> 01:07:51,238
so this is how
this is gonna go.

1177
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:53,407
I'm gonna finish
what my brother started,

1178
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:55,610
and then we go
our separate ways.

1179
01:07:55,743 --> 01:07:57,177
All right.

1180
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,614
It's a deal, kid.

1181
01:08:12,026 --> 01:08:13,828
Hey.

1182
01:08:13,962 --> 01:08:15,495
Be careful when you load her.

1183
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:17,197
I don't want her
getting scratched.

1184
01:08:17,331 --> 01:08:18,933
Yes, sir.

1185
01:08:21,268 --> 01:08:23,403
Nice car.

1186
01:08:23,538 --> 01:08:25,205
Yeah.

1187
01:08:26,674 --> 01:08:29,944
My father gave me this car
when I turned 18.

1188
01:08:30,078 --> 01:08:33,213
It's been my good-luck charm
ever since.

1189
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:37,919
The map.

1190
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:45,560
You know...

1191
01:08:45,693 --> 01:08:47,929
it's natural
to feel some conflict.

1192
01:08:49,664 --> 01:08:52,867
You made a difficult decision
but the right one.

1193
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:55,503
I don't really do regret.

1194
01:08:55,637 --> 01:08:57,471
Neither do I.

1195
01:08:57,605 --> 01:08:58,973
Shall we?

1196
01:09:04,746 --> 01:09:06,446
When you're right,
you're right, huh?

1197
01:09:06,581 --> 01:09:08,916
You don't have to
apologize to me now.

1198
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:10,685
She only cut us out
because she knew

1199
01:09:10,818 --> 01:09:12,419
you were gonna cut her out.

1200
01:09:12,553 --> 01:09:13,988
You're still harboring feelings

1201
01:09:14,122 --> 01:09:16,156
for that girl who knocked you
on your ass, huh?

1202
01:09:16,289 --> 01:09:17,659
Wow.

1203
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,763
Let's go!
Move it in, lock it down!

1204
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:25,465
All right, come on.

1205
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,367
They're getting ready to go.

1206
01:09:29,269 --> 01:09:31,371
<i>Maravilloso.</i>

1207
01:09:31,506 --> 01:09:34,441
Now, who is ready to make
a little history?

1208
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:43,685
I overlaid the map
with modern satellite imagery.

1209
01:09:43,818 --> 01:09:46,420
We'll drop our supplies
from the air,

1210
01:09:46,554 --> 01:09:47,922
land in Kiamba, Philippines,

1211
01:09:48,056 --> 01:09:49,891
where we'll be met
by our local forces.

1212
01:09:51,826 --> 01:09:56,196
We should find the pot
at the end of the rainbow here,

1213
01:09:56,329 --> 01:09:57,565
in Cala de Oro.

1214
01:10:02,804 --> 01:10:04,105
<i>Vámonos.</i>

1215
01:10:21,622 --> 01:10:23,490
<i>Approaching drop zone.</i>

1216
01:10:23,624 --> 01:10:25,425
<i>Lowering cargo door.</i>

1217
01:10:28,129 --> 01:10:30,330
To the victor...

1218
01:10:30,464 --> 01:10:32,432
the spoils.

1219
01:10:37,071 --> 01:10:39,406
Ah, come on. Give it to them.

1220
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:46,080
500 years ago,
my family was betrayed.

1221
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,751
Yes, a small band of explorers,

1222
01:10:49,884 --> 01:10:52,553
they found
the world biggest fortune.

1223
01:10:52,687 --> 01:10:54,555
And you know what? They hid it.

1224
01:10:54,689 --> 01:10:57,759
Uh, for centuries,
people search for it,

1225
01:10:57,892 --> 01:11:00,094
all in vain.

1226
01:11:00,228 --> 01:11:02,764
It was left to me

1227
01:11:02,897 --> 01:11:05,166
to recover my family's gold.

1228
01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:08,069
Nobody thought I could do it.

1229
01:11:08,202 --> 01:11:11,939
And certainly not my...
my father.

1230
01:11:16,577 --> 01:11:19,580
Now, today...

1231
01:11:19,714 --> 01:11:24,986
is the day I restore
the Moncadas' fortune.

1232
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:29,223
And I bring honor
back to my house.

1233
01:11:29,356 --> 01:11:32,093
And I earn my place in...

1234
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:39,767
Daddy was right...
you don't have what it takes.

1235
01:11:39,901 --> 01:11:42,937
The House of Moncada
dies with you.

1236
01:11:53,346 --> 01:11:54,849
Where's Frazer?

1237
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:00,353
No loose ends.

1238
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:19,974
That was literally
the worst ten hours of my life.

1239
01:12:20,107 --> 01:12:22,442
You want to get caught,
just keep talking.

1240
01:12:29,283 --> 01:12:30,685
Oh, good job, Jo.

1241
01:12:34,288 --> 01:12:35,623
Oh, shit.

1242
01:12:40,061 --> 01:12:41,896
It's hard to find a good
partner in this game, huh?

1243
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:43,197
Well, maybe you'll learn
to appreciate me

1244
01:12:43,331 --> 01:12:44,699
a little bit more.

1245
01:12:44,832 --> 01:12:46,834
All right, let's find
some parachutes.

1246
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:50,671
- Parachutes? What?
- Unless you know a better way

1247
01:12:50,805 --> 01:12:52,439
to jump out of a plane.

1248
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:04,952
It looks like
the lassie's boosted.

1249
01:13:25,339 --> 01:13:28,009
Hey. Don't even think about it.

1250
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:29,911
I can't just let her
get away with it.

1251
01:13:30,044 --> 01:13:32,113
This is not the place
to pick a fight, okay?

1252
01:13:32,246 --> 01:13:33,547
I'm trying to protect you.

1253
01:13:33,681 --> 01:13:35,583
Put one of these on.
Let's go now.

1254
01:13:39,754 --> 01:13:41,522
Hey!

1255
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:43,291
Did you kill my brother?

1256
01:13:47,328 --> 01:13:51,332
I said, did you kill
my brother, Sam Drake?

1257
01:13:51,464 --> 01:13:53,067
Nate! Come on!

1258
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:02,442
Whoa.

1259
01:14:05,046 --> 01:14:06,781
Whoa!

1260
01:14:11,986 --> 01:14:13,788
Oh, God!

1261
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:34,108
Hey, Braddock!
We found your loose end.

1262
01:14:36,577 --> 01:14:38,846
Now get rid
of her.

1263
01:14:47,088 --> 01:14:48,622
Oh, crap!

1264
01:14:54,862 --> 01:14:56,864
We can patch this up, Frazer.

1265
01:14:56,998 --> 01:14:58,498
Drop the gun.

1266
01:15:26,327 --> 01:15:28,129
I don't think
you've been counting.

1267
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:31,132
You've only got one shot left.

1268
01:15:33,801 --> 01:15:36,837
I got to give it to you,
Frazer.

1269
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:38,873
A fighter to the bitter end.

1270
01:15:39,006 --> 01:15:41,175
This is a very bad idea.

1271
01:15:41,308 --> 01:15:42,710
But this is the end.

1272
01:15:51,218 --> 01:15:52,521
Whoa!

1273
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,263
- Nate?
- Oh, come on!

1274
01:16:17,678 --> 01:16:18,979
What the hell are you doing?!

1275
01:16:19,113 --> 01:16:21,048
You just hit me with a car!

1276
01:16:21,182 --> 01:16:24,752
- You don't have a parachute?
- You don't have a parachute!

1277
01:16:24,885 --> 01:16:26,787
- Follow me!
- What?

1278
01:16:29,924 --> 01:16:31,892
Come on.

1279
01:16:37,098 --> 01:16:38,866
Whoa! Oh, shit!

1280
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:58,085
Pull the cord!

1281
01:17:00,121 --> 01:17:01,755
Nate, come on!

1282
01:17:01,889 --> 01:17:03,657
I'm trying!

1283
01:17:16,505 --> 01:17:18,305
Hold on. Hold on!

1284
01:17:35,789 --> 01:17:37,491
I'm not gonna apologize,

1285
01:17:37,626 --> 01:17:39,160
if that's what
you're waiting for.

1286
01:17:39,293 --> 01:17:40,828
I could probably forgive you

1287
01:17:40,961 --> 01:17:43,264
for what you did in Barcelona.

1288
01:17:43,397 --> 01:17:47,001
Maybe even for knocking me
out of a plane with a car.

1289
01:17:47,134 --> 01:17:48,435
But Braddock? Really?

1290
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:50,437
You really think
there's any difference

1291
01:17:50,572 --> 01:17:51,872
between them and you?

1292
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:53,374
You and Sully were
just as eager

1293
01:17:53,508 --> 01:17:54,975
to screw me over as they were.

1294
01:17:55,109 --> 01:17:57,344
Look, I'm not Sully, okay?

1295
01:17:57,478 --> 01:17:58,913
Hallelujah.

1296
01:17:59,046 --> 01:18:00,414
One's bad enough.

1297
01:18:07,788 --> 01:18:09,390
Nate?

1298
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:12,826
Do you see what I'm seeing?

1299
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,197
Well, if what you're seeing is
endless open ocean, then yeah.

1300
01:18:23,304 --> 01:18:25,072
Holy shit.

1301
01:18:37,051 --> 01:18:40,555
Whoa.
What the hell happened to you two?

1302
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:43,490
Fell out of a car
that fell out of a plane.

1303
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:46,493
Huh. Hey, you know, something
like that happened to me once.

1304
01:18:48,329 --> 01:18:50,164
Ah. Okay.

1305
01:18:53,635 --> 01:18:55,069
Good luck.

1306
01:18:55,202 --> 01:18:57,738
And here is your card back,
Mr. Sullivan.

1307
01:18:57,871 --> 01:19:00,374
Please, call me Victor.

1308
01:19:00,508 --> 01:19:02,276
Come on, I spent ten hours
in a trunk with him.

1309
01:19:02,409 --> 01:19:03,444
I couldn't help myself.

1310
01:19:03,578 --> 01:19:05,045
Let me show you to your room.

1311
01:19:05,179 --> 01:19:06,581
Thank you.

1312
01:19:11,185 --> 01:19:13,954
Moncada's money has
bought us everything we need.

1313
01:19:15,389 --> 01:19:17,091
All right, let's get to work.

1314
01:19:31,105 --> 01:19:32,607
Hey there.

1315
01:19:33,874 --> 01:19:35,976
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

1316
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:40,414
Are you sure these dimensions
are the same as the actual map?

1317
01:19:40,548 --> 01:19:43,551
To the exact millimeter. Why?

1318
01:19:43,685 --> 01:19:47,154
Braddock isn't gonna
find the gold.

1319
01:19:47,288 --> 01:19:49,957
Well, not where
she's looking, anyway.

1320
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:52,059
You mean we still
have a chance?

1321
01:19:52,192 --> 01:19:53,994
The captain left
one final clue,

1322
01:19:54,128 --> 01:19:56,930
and Sully seems to think that
Sam knew what that clue was,

1323
01:19:57,064 --> 01:20:00,000
and he might have tried
to tell me what it was.

1324
01:20:00,134 --> 01:20:01,603
These postcards
are the only thing

1325
01:20:01,736 --> 01:20:03,470
I've got from Sam
in the last ten years,

1326
01:20:03,605 --> 01:20:06,040
so if he did try
to tell me something, it...

1327
01:20:06,173 --> 01:20:08,375
has to be in these cards.

1328
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:10,044
For the love of God,
please be trying

1329
01:20:10,177 --> 01:20:11,713
to tell me something, Sam.

1330
01:20:11,845 --> 01:20:14,048
Is it something in the images?

1331
01:20:14,181 --> 01:20:16,016
Or something in the writing.

1332
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,986
Like an anagram or a cipher.

1333
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:21,188
We used to do that
all the time as kids.

1334
01:20:21,322 --> 01:20:22,724
Well, let's start
with the images.

1335
01:20:22,856 --> 01:20:24,391
- Do blue.
- Colors.

1336
01:20:24,526 --> 01:20:25,694
- There's a lot of blue.
- Okay, okay.

1337
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:27,961
Um... There's one card

1338
01:20:28,095 --> 01:20:30,364
where he spells
everything wrong.

1339
01:20:30,497 --> 01:20:31,965
- Weird.
- Where is that?

1340
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:34,001
- T-H-A-R...
- Um...

1341
01:20:34,134 --> 01:20:35,704
- Hills.
- H-Hills?

1342
01:20:35,836 --> 01:20:36,870
Hills.

1343
01:20:37,004 --> 01:20:39,940
So try writing, uh, this out.

1344
01:20:40,074 --> 01:20:42,042
- "Wish you were here, bro."
- "Wish you were here..."

1345
01:20:42,176 --> 01:20:44,011
<i>And then for every
letter you write down,</i>

1346
01:20:44,144 --> 01:20:45,846
<i>find the corresponding letter.</i>

1347
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:48,982
<i>So, "Wish you were here, bro."</i>

1348
01:20:49,116 --> 01:20:50,819
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1349
01:20:55,923 --> 01:20:57,491
Come on, Sam.

1350
01:20:57,625 --> 01:20:59,661
What are you trying to tell me?

1351
01:21:10,471 --> 01:21:12,774
What are you trying
to tell me, buddy?

1352
01:21:12,906 --> 01:21:15,409
"There's a whole world you
haven't seen, but you will."

1353
01:21:15,543 --> 01:21:18,278
"There's a whole world
you haven't seen..."

1354
01:21:23,384 --> 01:21:25,787
"Haven't seen."

1355
01:21:34,361 --> 01:21:37,665
Okay, come on.
Come on, come on.

1356
01:21:37,799 --> 01:21:40,568
"There's a whole world you
haven't seen, but you will.

1357
01:21:40,702 --> 01:21:42,604
Promise. Sam."

1358
01:21:54,849 --> 01:21:56,917
"The keys are your compass."
"The keys are your compass."

1359
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:58,452
"The key..."

1360
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:06,828
Okay, okay, okay.

1361
01:22:09,263 --> 01:22:10,832
Some compass, my ass.

1362
01:22:23,578 --> 01:22:25,946
Holy shit.

1363
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:28,850
Blue goes there.

1364
01:22:29,983 --> 01:22:32,921
And red goes there.

1365
01:22:43,464 --> 01:22:44,666
Oh, my God.

1366
01:22:50,204 --> 01:22:52,306
Oh, my God. Chloe.

1367
01:23:02,617 --> 01:23:04,151
Okay.

1368
01:23:29,176 --> 01:23:31,078
- Get out.
- Okay. Jump.

1369
01:23:33,113 --> 01:23:34,381
- Let's go.
- Not bad.

1370
01:23:36,016 --> 01:23:37,084
Very good.

1371
01:24:06,848 --> 01:24:08,382
Chloe?

1372
01:24:13,186 --> 01:24:14,789
<i>I'm sorry, Nate.</i>

1373
01:24:14,923 --> 01:24:17,057
<i>I like you. I really do.</i>

1374
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:18,793
<i>But I learned the hard way</i>

1375
01:24:18,927 --> 01:24:22,262
<i>the minute you start
to trust someone, you lose.</i>

1376
01:24:24,599 --> 01:24:26,300
Yeah, well...

1377
01:24:26,433 --> 01:24:29,369
too bad you're headed
in the wrong direction.

1378
01:24:40,748 --> 01:24:43,051
What the hell?

1379
01:26:35,328 --> 01:26:38,231
<i>Lost. Not gone.</i>

1380
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:40,568
<i>There's a difference.</i>

1381
01:26:40,702 --> 01:26:43,171
<i>If something's lost,</i>

1382
01:26:43,303 --> 01:26:45,106
<i>it can be found.</i>

1383
01:26:49,209 --> 01:26:50,745
We did it, Sam.

1384
01:26:54,816 --> 01:26:56,249
We did it.

1385
01:27:48,903 --> 01:27:50,938
Cloves.

1386
01:27:51,072 --> 01:27:52,940
You know, back then,
spices were worth

1387
01:27:53,074 --> 01:27:54,776
nearly as much as gold.

1388
01:27:56,911 --> 01:27:58,212
Why am I not surprised?

1389
01:27:58,345 --> 01:28:01,215
I keep too many apps open,
remember?

1390
01:28:01,348 --> 01:28:03,618
- I knew you'd figure it out.
- Figure what out?

1391
01:28:03,751 --> 01:28:06,087
The puzzle in Sam's postcards.

1392
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:07,622
- So, what is it?
- Does it matter?

1393
01:28:07,755 --> 01:28:08,923
I already found the gold.

1394
01:28:09,056 --> 01:28:09,991
I don't see any gold.

1395
01:28:10,124 --> 01:28:11,458
Oh, it's here.

1396
01:28:11,592 --> 01:28:12,794
It's a false top.

1397
01:28:13,928 --> 01:28:15,596
Old pirate trick.

1398
01:28:16,964 --> 01:28:19,000
Here's your gold
you've been looking for.

1399
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,869
You happy now?

1400
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,474
Holy shit.

1401
01:28:27,608 --> 01:28:29,110
You got to be kidding me.

1402
01:28:31,344 --> 01:28:33,848
Well, look at that, huh?

1403
01:28:33,981 --> 01:28:36,617
It's almost more than we
thought. Plus the other ship.

1404
01:28:36,751 --> 01:28:37,985
Plus the value
of the ships themselves,

1405
01:28:38,119 --> 01:28:39,620
which you can't even
put a price on.

1406
01:28:39,754 --> 01:28:41,189
We did it!
We actually did it!

1407
01:28:41,321 --> 01:28:43,991
Sully, we didn't do anything.

1408
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:47,829
Okay? There is no "we."
There's only you.

1409
01:28:47,962 --> 01:28:49,564
Because there's not
a person in your life

1410
01:28:49,697 --> 01:28:51,498
that you wouldn't betray
for a piece of this.

1411
01:28:51,632 --> 01:28:53,768
You made that real clear.

1412
01:28:53,901 --> 01:28:55,169
I thought
that's what we wanted.

1413
01:28:55,303 --> 01:28:57,505
No, I wanted to do this
with my brother Sam,

1414
01:28:57,638 --> 01:28:58,873
not with you.

1415
01:29:01,408 --> 01:29:03,376
I know.

1416
01:29:03,511 --> 01:29:05,646
I'm sorry.

1417
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:07,949
But look around, kid.
You did this.

1418
01:29:09,517 --> 01:29:11,719
He'd be proud of you.

1419
01:29:24,832 --> 01:29:26,667
- It's Braddock.
- Shit.

1420
01:29:26,801 --> 01:29:28,069
We'd better get small.

1421
01:29:28,202 --> 01:29:29,937
- Or, in your case, smaller.
- Hey.

1422
01:29:30,071 --> 01:29:32,907
You're only like one inch
taller than me, max.

1423
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,775
I think it's a little more
than that, kid.

1424
01:29:34,909 --> 01:29:36,577
Come with me.
I know where to go.

1425
01:29:40,413 --> 01:29:42,382
Magellan's ships.

1426
01:29:42,516 --> 01:29:45,953
Oh, they're more beautiful than
I could have ever imagined.

1427
01:29:46,087 --> 01:29:47,722
Find the gold.
If you see Sully,

1428
01:29:47,855 --> 01:29:49,557
do not let him open
that mouth of his.

1429
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:52,392
Kill him and Drake on sight.

1430
01:29:52,526 --> 01:29:53,995
- Aye.
- Be careful, gentlemen.

1431
01:29:54,128 --> 01:29:55,830
These ships are worth a fortune
on their own.

1432
01:29:55,963 --> 01:29:58,398
You put a hole in my boats,
I put a hole in you.

1433
01:30:04,038 --> 01:30:05,940
- Oh, I'm not going in there.
- Hey, look.

1434
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:07,708
You could stay up here
and get shot in the head

1435
01:30:07,842 --> 01:30:09,442
or come down here
for a quick cuddle... up to you.

1436
01:30:09,577 --> 01:30:11,379
- I'm going down.
- Oh, God.

1437
01:30:40,074 --> 01:30:41,409
You see anything?

1438
01:30:43,077 --> 01:30:44,612
All clear, sir.

1439
01:30:48,582 --> 01:30:49,917
Braddock.

1440
01:30:50,952 --> 01:30:52,620
We cannae find them.

1441
01:30:52,753 --> 01:30:54,288
They're nae on board.

1442
01:30:54,422 --> 01:30:56,057
They must have filled
their pockets and fled.

1443
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:57,457
Keep an eye out anyway.

1444
01:30:57,591 --> 01:30:59,560
Sully's a cockroach
when it comes to gold.

1445
01:31:15,376 --> 01:31:17,411
<i>Wind is
one-five-zero-one-five-nine.</i>

1446
01:31:17,545 --> 01:31:19,313
<i>Hold TRQ at 4.2.</i>

1447
01:31:19,447 --> 01:31:20,815
<i>All right, who's clear?</i>

1448
01:31:26,153 --> 01:31:27,955
What is it with you
and small spaces?

1449
01:31:28,089 --> 01:31:29,957
Got this
thing jamming up my ass.

1450
01:31:32,626 --> 01:31:35,029
- Wow.
- Don't even think about it.

1451
01:31:35,162 --> 01:31:36,496
Oh, I'm thinking about it.

1452
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:37,999
Oh, my God.

1453
01:31:51,712 --> 01:31:53,547
All right, come on.

1454
01:31:55,483 --> 01:31:57,718
Oh, Jesus.
She's flying the ships out?

1455
01:31:57,852 --> 01:31:59,153
And us with them.

1456
01:31:59,286 --> 01:32:01,822
What do you mean,
she's flying us out?

1457
01:32:20,509 --> 01:32:22,209
Victoria, this is Trinidad.

1458
01:32:22,343 --> 01:32:24,412
Are you ready to receive? Over.

1459
01:32:24,545 --> 01:32:27,548
<i>Roger that.
Victoria standing by.</i>

1460
01:32:27,681 --> 01:32:30,251
Let's bring her home.

1461
01:32:30,384 --> 01:32:31,886
<i>You ready up there, Scotty?</i>

1462
01:32:32,019 --> 01:32:33,454
Aye.

1463
01:32:33,587 --> 01:32:34,922
<i>Hold TRQ at 4.2.</i>

1464
01:32:35,056 --> 01:32:36,624
<i>Two degrees south.</i>

1465
01:32:39,927 --> 01:32:41,829
Geez, Sully, come on.
The boat's full of that stuff.

1466
01:32:41,962 --> 01:32:43,864
Just in case.

1467
01:32:43,998 --> 01:32:45,733
No.

1468
01:32:48,537 --> 01:32:50,638
Hey. You want to go show 'em
what's what?

1469
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:52,206
That's nice.
Let me see it for a second.

1470
01:32:52,339 --> 01:32:53,908
- Yeah, nice, huh?
- Yeah, real nice.

1471
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:55,643
Hey.

1472
01:33:11,392 --> 01:33:12,893
Holding steady.

1473
01:33:13,027 --> 01:33:14,462
You ready for a mutiny?

1474
01:33:14,628 --> 01:33:16,630
Why not?

1475
01:33:27,174 --> 01:33:28,976
Whoa!

1476
01:33:36,317 --> 01:33:37,685
Whoa!

1477
01:33:40,921 --> 01:33:41,989
Oh, shit.

1478
01:33:42,123 --> 01:33:43,257
That one's a little more
your size.

1479
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:44,258
Yeah, cute.

1480
01:34:12,554 --> 01:34:14,688
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not my gold!

1481
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:20,629
Oh, shit.

1482
01:34:20,761 --> 01:34:23,197
Okay, you go to go hijack
that helicopter.

1483
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:26,133
Right to the point, huh?
All right.

1484
01:34:26,267 --> 01:34:28,202
You know the drill, right?
You don't have to touch it

1485
01:34:28,335 --> 01:34:30,037
with your finger to use it.

1486
01:34:33,608 --> 01:34:35,009
Hey, Sully.

1487
01:34:36,277 --> 01:34:38,345
- Don't crash.
- Just what I needed.

1488
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:40,714
Positive reinforcement. Thanks.

1489
01:34:48,489 --> 01:34:51,058
Hey! All hands on deck!

1490
01:34:51,192 --> 01:34:53,528
Raise the anchor!
Hoist the mainsail!

1491
01:34:53,662 --> 01:34:55,896
Hey, Jack Sparrow, stay sharp.

1492
01:34:56,030 --> 01:34:57,698
Oh, come on, man,
I've been waiting to do this

1493
01:34:57,831 --> 01:34:58,999
my entire life.

1494
01:35:05,306 --> 01:35:06,240
Hey, guys.

1495
01:35:10,612 --> 01:35:11,680
Hey!

1496
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:25,226
All right, Victor, you got this.

1497
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:26,760
Come on.

1498
01:35:26,894 --> 01:35:28,028
Easy.

1499
01:35:33,535 --> 01:35:35,035
<i>Hey, Jo.</i>

1500
01:35:39,206 --> 01:35:40,207
Follow that ship.

1501
01:35:49,083 --> 01:35:51,885
Hey, Sully, I think your
girlfriend wants her boat back.

1502
01:35:52,019 --> 01:35:53,153
Yeah, I'm aware.

1503
01:35:53,287 --> 01:35:54,288
- Try to get the...
- Load 'em up!

1504
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:55,322
- Go!
- Go!

1505
01:35:58,392 --> 01:35:59,728
Come on.

1506
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:04,331
- Clear!
- Go!

1507
01:36:08,369 --> 01:36:10,437
All right,
let's see what this shitcan can do.

1508
01:36:18,412 --> 01:36:19,780
Shite!

1509
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:42,537
Hang on, kid.
I'm-a get us out of here.

1510
01:37:05,926 --> 01:37:07,828
Okay. Okay.

1511
01:37:11,298 --> 01:37:12,634
Gunpowder.

1512
01:37:20,474 --> 01:37:22,009
Look at that.

1513
01:37:22,142 --> 01:37:23,678
There we go.

1514
01:37:23,812 --> 01:37:24,813
Come on, baby.

1515
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:39,193
I think that did it.

1516
01:37:39,326 --> 01:37:41,195
I still got it.

1517
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:44,231
Oh, shit.

1518
01:38:18,666 --> 01:38:19,667
Hey, you still with me?

1519
01:38:19,801 --> 01:38:21,669
Barely.

1520
01:38:37,151 --> 01:38:38,252
Yes!

1521
01:38:39,587 --> 01:38:40,688
You got to do something.

1522
01:38:40,822 --> 01:38:42,923
They're coming right at us.

1523
01:38:44,057 --> 01:38:45,325
I think I have an idea.

1524
01:38:45,459 --> 01:38:46,628
Okay.

1525
01:38:54,903 --> 01:38:56,303
What's going on?!

1526
01:38:56,437 --> 01:38:57,572
Sully, will you please
just shut up?

1527
01:38:57,705 --> 01:39:00,007
I'm working on it. Okay.

1528
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,075
<i>That's your idea?</i>

1529
01:39:05,078 --> 01:39:06,246
No.

1530
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:08,015
Ah, come on!

1531
01:39:21,696 --> 01:39:23,464
No, no, no, no.

1532
01:39:25,966 --> 01:39:27,234
No, no, no.

1533
01:39:27,367 --> 01:39:28,570
Oh, God!

1534
01:39:31,972 --> 01:39:33,073
Oh, shite!

1535
01:39:36,276 --> 01:39:37,612
What a shot!

1536
01:39:51,258 --> 01:39:52,159
Mother Mary!

1537
01:40:00,969 --> 01:40:02,169
We're home free.

1538
01:40:02,302 --> 01:40:04,037
You did it, kid.
You did it.

1539
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:05,205
Yeah, Sully!

1540
01:40:05,339 --> 01:40:07,509
If I lose, so do you.

1541
01:40:08,643 --> 01:40:10,143
Hey, Sully, this ain't over.

1542
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:19,888
Damn it!

1543
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:21,154
What's going on?

1544
01:40:27,862 --> 01:40:29,329
Come on, we're so close!

1545
01:40:34,602 --> 01:40:35,970
Ah, shit!

1546
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,207
No, no, no!

1547
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:44,546
No!

1548
01:40:44,679 --> 01:40:45,880
Damn!

1549
01:41:02,162 --> 01:41:03,497
Say hi to your brother
for me, will you?

1550
01:41:03,631 --> 01:41:04,966
You first.

1551
01:41:26,086 --> 01:41:27,454
Sully!

1552
01:41:30,324 --> 01:41:31,726
Sully, no!

1553
01:41:31,859 --> 01:41:33,260
Please!

1554
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:37,464
Shit.

1555
01:41:39,567 --> 01:41:41,101
Hey, Braddock!

1556
01:41:51,045 --> 01:41:53,681
Nate! Come on!

1557
01:41:53,815 --> 01:41:54,949
Trust me.

1558
01:42:20,875 --> 01:42:23,410
I got you, kid. I got you.

1559
01:42:23,544 --> 01:42:25,913
Come on.

1560
01:42:33,487 --> 01:42:34,856
Look at her.

1561
01:42:34,989 --> 01:42:36,824
You can't put a price on that.

1562
01:42:36,958 --> 01:42:38,458
Yeah, you can, actually.

1563
01:42:38,593 --> 01:42:40,094
Like four to six billion.

1564
01:42:54,042 --> 01:42:55,510
We could just get
a diving rig.

1565
01:42:56,944 --> 01:42:59,413
Not before those guys.

1566
01:42:59,547 --> 01:43:02,315
It's property
of the Philippines now.

1567
01:43:25,173 --> 01:43:26,808
Hey. I just wanted
to say thank you

1568
01:43:26,941 --> 01:43:28,676
for what you did for me
back there.

1569
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:31,179
You know, ever since
my brother Sam left...

1570
01:43:33,213 --> 01:43:35,183
Oh, you... Oh.

1571
01:43:35,315 --> 01:43:36,651
Can you hear me?

1572
01:43:37,852 --> 01:43:39,520
- I can now.
- I was...

1573
01:43:39,654 --> 01:43:41,556
I was just saying
we should get out of here.

1574
01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:43,991
You got it.

1575
01:43:50,164 --> 01:43:51,099
Hey.

1576
01:43:51,231 --> 01:43:53,034
Is that who I think it is?

1577
01:43:58,039 --> 01:43:59,473
Bastards.

1578
01:44:01,241 --> 01:44:03,911
Yeah, I might have let her
steal the wrong coordinates.

1579
01:44:05,713 --> 01:44:07,414
Hey, you're starting
to figure it out, kid.

1580
01:44:07,548 --> 01:44:08,950
Yeah, I learned from the best.

1581
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:11,986
You got a heart of gold, Sully.

1582
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:13,988
Real funny, wiseass.

1583
01:44:14,122 --> 01:44:16,557
- What, too soon?
- Forever is too soon.

1584
01:44:16,691 --> 01:44:18,793
Here, maybe this will help.
I got you something.

1585
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:26,433
Are you kidding me, kid?
For real?

1586
01:44:26,567 --> 01:44:27,869
Yeah, look. I got this...

1587
01:44:29,003 --> 01:44:30,138
You got to be kidding me.

1588
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:31,438
- ...and these.
- You got more?

1589
01:44:31,572 --> 01:44:32,907
- I got loads of it. Look.
- Oh.

1590
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,041
Keep it coming.

1591
01:44:34,175 --> 01:44:35,076
You'll like this one.

1592
01:44:35,209 --> 01:44:36,778
Here you go. Here you go.

1593
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:41,481
Aw.

1594
01:44:43,383 --> 01:44:45,119
This means a lot to me.

1595
01:44:47,287 --> 01:44:49,157
That was my last piece, man.

1596
01:44:49,289 --> 01:44:50,792
Come on, let's just
get out of here.

1597
01:44:50,925 --> 01:44:52,392
All right, hang on.

1598
01:47:51,973 --> 01:47:54,575
- You're late.
- Sorry about that.

1599
01:47:55,876 --> 01:47:57,411
Why do you want the map?

1600
01:47:59,113 --> 01:48:01,582
I'll tell you...

1601
01:48:01,716 --> 01:48:04,118
if you tell me
what Roman wants with my ring.

1602
01:48:08,756 --> 01:48:12,059
Because he knows it means
something special to you.

1603
01:48:12,193 --> 01:48:13,828
Okay, let's have it.

1604
01:48:21,769 --> 01:48:25,039
Now... you're gonna tell me
what's so important

1605
01:48:25,172 --> 01:48:27,141
about an old Nazi map.

1606
01:48:27,274 --> 01:48:29,477
Hey. Put 'em down, boys.

1607
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:31,045
Nice and slow.

1608
01:48:31,178 --> 01:48:32,713
What...

1609
01:48:32,847 --> 01:48:34,382
What is that thing
on your face?

1610
01:48:34,515 --> 01:48:35,716
Hey, puberty's
right around the corner, kid.

1611
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:37,785
You can grow your own.

1612
01:48:44,158 --> 01:48:46,327
You got what you want.

1613
01:48:47,695 --> 01:48:49,130
And I got what I want.

1614
01:48:53,868 --> 01:48:56,137
Montecristo. I'm impressed.

1615
01:48:56,270 --> 01:48:58,172
You're gonna be dead
before you can smoke it.

1616
01:48:58,305 --> 01:49:00,741
Hey, it's always a pleasure
doing business with you.

1617
01:49:00,875 --> 01:49:03,844
And, um...
would you look at that?

1618
01:49:07,581 --> 01:49:09,383
I got friends everywhere,
Drake.

1619
01:49:09,518 --> 01:49:10,951
Oh, yeah?
I can't wait to meet 'em.

1620
01:49:11,085 --> 01:49:12,386
Hey, you were supposed
to be here yesterday.

1621
01:49:12,521 --> 01:49:13,754
Did you know you need
special papers

1622
01:49:13,888 --> 01:49:15,222
to bring an animal on a plane?

1623
01:49:15,356 --> 01:49:17,124
- I did not know that.
- You trying to tell me

1624
01:49:17,258 --> 01:49:19,226
I almost just bought it because
you brought your damn cat?

1625
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,929
Hey, I go everywhere with
Mr. Whiskers, okay?

1626
01:49:22,063 --> 01:49:23,864
Let me see the map.

1627
01:49:25,266 --> 01:49:26,600
This is the big one, kid.

1628
01:49:26,734 --> 01:49:27,701
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1629
01:49:27,835 --> 01:49:28,869
Let's go.

1630
01:49:31,072 --> 01:49:33,542
Oh, crap.

1630
01:49:34,305 --> 01:50:34,520
