2
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:16,513
Mm-hmm.

3
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,053
A little bit of magic time.

4
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:23,022
I feel it.

5
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:29,027
Yes, sir.

6
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:39,537
Terrific shot ! I'm in the goddamn woods again.

7
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:41,539
Goddamn.

8
00:01:44,177 --> 00:01:46,177
Damn game.

9
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:52,816
I spend more time in the trees than the squirrels.

10
00:02:01,226 --> 00:02:04,127
Wizard Two ? Why not ?

11
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,333
Uh-oh.

12
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:14,336
Not again.

13
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:19,075
I've had five heart attacks in the last ten years.

14
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:22,344
My first was on a golf course in South Carolina.

15
00:02:22,346 --> 00:02:24,713
It wasn't all that bad.

16
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:29,350
A couple of doglegs that were more dog than leg,
but I-I'd-- all in all, it was playable.

17
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:33,121
Assuming, of course, you didn't die on the second hole.

18
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:36,791
The second coronary was at Augusta,
where they had the Masters.

19
00:02:36,793 --> 00:02:39,394
Went down right on the first fairway.

20
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:43,798
It was a good thing, too, 'cause those greens
probably would have been the end of me anyway.

21
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,267
My wife used to ask me, before she passed on,

22
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:51,238
why do I play a game that seems destined to kill me ?

23
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,142
It all started back in 19 and 28...

24
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:58,245
when I was just a youngster in Savannah, Georgia.

25
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,254
Jones and Hagen are really goin' at it.

26
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:11,424
They're like neck-and-neck all the time. Nuts.

27
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:15,461
Was it 350 ? Nah. More like 400 with the roll.

28
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,530
I don't care how good Jones and Hagen are.

29
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:20,166
Junuh could've beat 'em both with his eyes closed.

30
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:22,335
Junuh won that thing three times in a row.

31
00:03:22,337 --> 00:03:25,137
Now when I was growin' up, every town had its heroes,

32
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,841
and ours was Rannulph Junuh,
an athlete who was a born winner.

33
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:33,345
Well, I wanted to be just like him.

34
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:54,398
Ladies and gentlemen, Junuh has the
most difficult shot in the history of golf.

35
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,835
He must sink this shot from 110
yards to win the championship.

36
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,237
He steps up to the ball.

37
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,505
The crowd is hushed in anticipation.

38
00:04:02,507 --> 00:04:06,509
Can he make this miracle shot ? And he swings !

39
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:10,246
Fore ! Watch your heads !

40
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:23,492
Now I'd never seen him play myself,
since it was before I was born,

41
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:27,462
but it was said that Junuh had been on
track to becomin' the greatest golfer...

42
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:29,531
this country had ever seen.

43
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:32,301
Titanic off the tee.

44
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:35,771
Approach shots which fell to earth, as Sam Snead once put it,

45
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:39,407
"like a butterfly with sore feet."

46
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,409
He won just about everything.

47
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:45,546
But even he was the first to say
that his most significant victory...

48
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:48,516
was winnin' the heart of Adele Invergordon,

49
00:04:48,518 --> 00:04:51,752
daughter of the wealthiest man in Savannah.

50
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:48,473
But fate plays funny tricks.

51
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:52,410
¶ The Yanks are coming The
drums rum-tumming everywhere ¶

52
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:57,047
It was a patriotic call to arms to
fight "the war to end all wars."

53
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,452
Junuh and everyone else in town believed it was his destiny...

54
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:05,522
to lead the young men of Savannah into battle.

55
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:08,525
¶ Till it's over over there ¶¶

56
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:11,528
¶ How ya gonna keep 'em away from Broadway ¶

57
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,730
¶ Jazzin' around ¶¶

58
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:17,500
It was to be his crowning glory.

59
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,536
But nothing could have prepared him or anyone...

60
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:24,340
for the shock and sorrow of what was to come.

61
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,379
Positions. Get ready. Ready, Captain.

62
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:32,548
Positions. Prepare to advance. Ready, sir.

63
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:36,885
Advance !

64
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:39,454
Advance !

65
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:44,783
Confused, broken...

66
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:48,553
and unable to face a return to a hero's welcome,

67
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,556
Junuh just disappeared,

68
00:07:56,796 --> 00:07:59,029
hopin' to forget...

69
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,533
and to be forgotten.

70
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:06,937
But Adele, bein' a woman of the South,

71
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:10,540
had survived worse than desertion.

72
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,543
And she moved on with her life,

73
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:16,012
dedicatin' herself to her father's dream.

74
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:19,549
What we have here is the most magnificent
golf resort on the face of God's good earth,

75
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:21,785
and I am buildin' it right here in Savannah.

76
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:25,822
Krewe Island, legacy to my sweet Adele.

77
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:28,924
And we'd like to use all of you as our main suppliers.

78
00:08:56,853 --> 00:09:00,521
I was ten years old when Junuh came home.

79
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,534
Stop !

80
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:57,208
Less than a year later,
the Great Depression that swept the nation...

81
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,911
hit Savannah.

82
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,921
Jobs were lost, stores and banks were shut for good.

83
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:17,194
And John Invergordon,
havin' spent his last dime on his great dream,

84
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:22,132
opened Krewe Island on what should
have been a glorious spring day.

85
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:49,891
¶ My consolation when blue ¶

86
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:54,062
¶ So just supposing that you ¶¶

87
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:59,634
<i>It might not have been a shot
heard round the world, Oh, Daddy !</i>

88
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:03,804
but it sure reached every nook and cranny in Savannah.

89
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,882
I'll be putting some doors and closets in the parlor.

90
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:18,586
With any luck, we could have
some boarders within a few weeks.

91
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:21,254
Hardy, you think you can share your room with Cara Mae ?

92
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,991
What about the store ?

93
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,410
Oh, Jesus.

94
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:24,047
I've died and gone to hell.

95
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:28,118
It's not as though you got a choice, Adele.

96
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,920
Your Krewe Island golf resort is dead and gone.

97
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:35,325
You've got the gumption of a corn fritter,
Neskaloosa. My gumption is not the subject.

98
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:38,360
Well, then what is the subject, gentlemen ? Huh ?

99
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:42,031
If it's your offer to take Krewe Island
for one-tenth of what my father spent--

100
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:44,867
You are lucky to be gettin' a dime on the dollar, Adele.

101
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:47,269
Just so you gentlemen can turn right around and resell it...

102
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:50,806
to some Carolina paper mill for a tidy profit ?

103
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:54,343
The fact that you've most likely got the deal
in your pocket already is not my problem.

104
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:57,211
Maybe we should come back when
the shock of your father's passing...

105
00:12:57,213 --> 00:13:00,181
isn't so-- so-- Oh, God.

106
00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:02,350
Don't bother. I'm not sellin'.

107
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:06,354
You got a stack of debts that'd fill every
storage bay in the Cotton Exchange--

108
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:08,356
And I intend to pay them off.

109
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:11,025
- In time. - With what ? Ball tokens ?

110
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:14,862
With money people gonna spend once they
know that this is the premier resort in the South.

111
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:19,199
Did I miss somethin' ? Did I ?
Or are we not in the midst of a great depression ?

112
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:22,402
There's still people with money, Neskaloosa,
and I'm gonna make sure they know about Krewe.

113
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:26,073
But how exactly do you intend to accomplish that ?

114
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:28,241
- How ? - Well, how ?

115
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:31,011
How ? I'll tell you how.

116
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:40,219
I'm gonna have the greatest exhibition match ever held...

117
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:44,223
on the greatest golf course ever built.

118
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:46,959
- Bobby Jones... - Bobby Jones ?

119
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:49,261
-will be playin' Walter Hagen... -Walter Hagen ?

120
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:52,932
-for the grand prize of $10,000. -$10,000 ?

121
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:55,366
You can't be serious, Adele. $10,000 for one weekend ?

122
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,269
Well,

123
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:01,139
I'd make it more, gentlemen,

124
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,408
but that's just about all I believe I can raise...

125
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,410
if I sell everything I own...

126
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,012
on this earth.

127
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,014
Except, of course, Krewe Island.

128
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,417
Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen are comin' to Krewe Island ?

129
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:15,018
Playin' an exhibition match for ten grand ?

130
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,221
That's correct.

131
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,924
They don't know it yet,
but that's exactly what they'll be doin'.

132
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:23,293
Have you gone totally off your rocker ?

133
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:28,432
Nobody has the right to call
Krewe Island "Invergordon's Folly."

134
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,335
Nobody. Good day, gentlemen.

135
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:37,306
Adele !

136
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:42,445
Nobody holds your father
responsible for this depression, Adele !

137
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,450
You're a damn fool, Adele !

138
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:50,186
Save your breath, Judge. She'll sell to us.

139
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:54,156
You really think Bobby Jones and Walter
Hagen are gonna come to Krewe Island...

140
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:56,925
just 'cause Adele Invergordon wants 'em to ?

141
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,169
All four golf championships in a single year.

142
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:10,405
The Grand Slam. Simply amazing.

143
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:13,307
I don't believe that's ever been done
before in the history of golf, has it ?

144
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,309
Well, no, it, uh-- It, uh--

145
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:17,511
It just takes my breath away.

146
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:22,016
You don't impress me as someone who
tends to lose her breath, Miss Invergordon.

147
00:15:22,018 --> 00:15:24,919
Did you know, Mr. Jones, that reprobate Mr. Walter Hagen--

148
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:29,123
who I hear spends his every minute chasin' after women--

149
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,392
has been approached about playin' in
next's month's $10,000 Krewe Island match ?

150
00:15:32,394 --> 00:15:34,494
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

151
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:38,431
But I'm not clear how this is an urgent
matter for the American Red Cross.

152
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:42,035
- Did I say that ? - At the front door.

153
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:45,405
May I speak candidly, Mr. Jones ?

154
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,941
I wish you would.

155
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:53,245
I've come here today to see you
because to the South, you are a hero.

156
00:15:53,247 --> 00:15:56,048
They see you as a young god:

157
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,885
brave, valiant, glorious.

158
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:03,322
One of the greatest golfers in the world today.

159
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:06,058
<i>I would say the greatest golfer in the world today...</i>

160
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,627
were it not for that unfortunate incident
last year when that profligate, Mr. Hagen,

161
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:14,131
whupped you by 12 strokes on your very own course.

162
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:18,402
You say he's been invited to play
at Krewe Island next month ?

163
00:16:29,915 --> 00:16:32,415
She has a remarkable talent, Mr. Hagen.

164
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,885
I was the one who hit the ball.

165
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,091
I wonder if you might excuse us for
just a couple of minutes, Anna Mae ?

166
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:44,427
It won't be long.

167
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:49,365
A charming woman, Mr. Hagen.
Although she gave me quite a fright for a moment there.

168
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:53,135
With so much weight distributed in front,
I'd have sworn she'd topple back to the floor...

169
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,671
before she ever got to her knees.

170
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:59,275
I do admire a man with your...

171
00:16:59,277 --> 00:17:01,377
vitality. Oh ?

172
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:06,414
The South is in such an unfortunate place
these days, and Savannah most of all.

173
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,984
The memories of our disastrous defeat
in the War Between the States still linger,

174
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:13,655
and with them, the defeated,
uncertain men who returned lacking the vigor...

175
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,125
we woman normally associate with your gender. Hmm.

176
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:19,193
And now, sadly, here is Savannah,

177
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:22,030
teeming with the most attractive young women,

178
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:24,198
and nobody, absolutely nobody...

179
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,400
to satisfy them. Hmm.

180
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:30,270
Except for, perhaps, Bobby Jones,
who will be playing in our Krewe Island tournament.

181
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:36,276
So he says, "It don't matter what it is. It won't hurt you.

182
00:17:36,278 --> 00:17:39,346
You just pop one in your mouth, and you chew !"

183
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:45,451
I'm pleased to announce that Mr.
Bobby Jones and Mr. Walter Hagen...

184
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:48,621
have accepted my golfin' invitation,

185
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:51,324
with enthusiasm.

186
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:57,029
This, of course, is Miss Adele Invergordon's...

187
00:17:57,031 --> 00:18:00,399
commitment to her father's dream, possibly the most--

188
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:02,968
Not one to concede defeat easily,

189
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,972
Neskaloosa engineered a local
uprising against the tournament.

190
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:11,409
And I'm sure that you boys would think
I've been drinkin' too much blackjack tea.

191
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:15,313
'Course, these are our streets
that they're gonna be parkin' in.

192
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:17,716
They will tax the limits of our constabulary--

193
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:21,052
Do you think one of them damn rich Yankees...

194
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:24,054
gives a hoot about Savannah or anybody in it ?

195
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:26,657
Now, now, now, now, now.

196
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:29,126
Now, we need the Yankee,

197
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:31,428
but we also need someone from Savannah...

198
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,265
in the match, one of us,

199
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:37,668
givin' Jones and Hagen a real run for their money.

200
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,671
Then they'll know what we're made of.

201
00:18:40,673 --> 00:18:43,272
We need someone from Savannah playin' in our tournament !

202
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:46,042
What about Dougal McDermott ? He'd turn a trick or two.

203
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:49,112
He's a Scot. The only time he comes into town is to get drunk.

204
00:18:49,114 --> 00:18:52,448
- Bobby Jones is from Atlanta. - I said, Savannah !

205
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,418
<i>The South. The real South.</i>

206
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,156
Neskaloosa knew the golden rule
of politics better than anyone:

207
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:01,757
If you can't beat 'em, lead 'em.

208
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,726
All right, all right. Hold it, hold it ! Hold it, everyone !

209
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,728
There's one person we're forgettin'.

210
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,299
We all know there's one man who
hits gargantuan drives off the tee...

211
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:14,302
and has a lock picker's touch around the greens.

212
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:18,373
Savannah's own Enderby "Cottonmouth" Conyngham.

213
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,446
Wait a minute ! He's 80 years old !

214
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:28,115
He'd need one caddie to carry his golf clubs...

215
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:30,451
and two to carry him !

216
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:36,357
Junuh could whip 'em both. You're off your rocker.

217
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,059
Junuh couldn't whip a dead possum in a gunnysack.

218
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:41,461
That ain't true. Oh, yeah ?

219
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:44,664
<i>- What about Captain Junuh ? - Who ?</i>

220
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,100
Captain Junuh.

221
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,470
My dad says he's the greatest golfer Savannah ever had.

222
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,639
Hardy. Well, it's true.

223
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,741
You must've said it a hundred times.

224
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:57,210
<i>Sit down, son. The boy's got a point.</i>

225
00:19:57,212 --> 00:20:00,479
-Junuh's born and bred Savannah. -Exactly !

226
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:03,115
<i>And this is the point ! I heard he just disappeared.</i>

227
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:09,488
Forget Rannulph Junuh,
assumin' you can locate his whereabouts.

228
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,358
I hear he's so far gone,
he wouldn't know a putter from a pussy willow.

229
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,794
I know where to find him.

230
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:21,499
You find him, Hardy, and we will be there.

231
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:25,136
Fly, lad, with winged sandals on your feet !

232
00:20:33,513 --> 00:20:36,780
If I live to be a thousand, which doesn't seem likely,

233
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:40,517
I'll never know where I got the courage to call out like that.

234
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:43,453
But once I did, I wasn't backin' down.

235
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:13,816
This could've been the stupidest idea I've ever had.

236
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:25,426
Captain Junuh ?

237
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:29,464
Captain Junuh ?

238
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:31,699
This is Hardy Greaves, sir.

239
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:11,304
Get outta here with that.

240
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:14,973
Hey, just make sure you guys
save some of that money for me.

241
00:22:14,975 --> 00:22:18,476
<i>Whoa-ho-ho ! What have we here ?</i>

242
00:22:18,478 --> 00:22:20,478
Well, well.

243
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,448
Look like we got a new cardplayer, gents.

244
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:28,320
It's all right, boy. There's no need to be scared.

245
00:22:28,322 --> 00:22:30,488
I ain't scared.

246
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,756
I've seen men drunk plenty of times.

247
00:22:32,758 --> 00:22:35,926
<i>Well, what do they look like ? Well, they ain't much to look at.</i>

248
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:40,497
<i>At least not so much as they seem to think it is.
But it don't scare me none.</i>

249
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:45,402
Gentlemen, we may be lookin' at
the only male in Chatham County...

250
00:22:45,404 --> 00:22:47,304
who isn't completely full of shit.

251
00:22:48,741 --> 00:22:51,374
What's your name, son ?

252
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:54,244
Uh, Hardy. Hardy Greaves.

253
00:22:55,947 --> 00:22:59,249
- You Frank Greaves' boy ? - Yes, sir.

254
00:23:01,886 --> 00:23:04,020
What brings you here, Hardy ?

255
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:07,690
<i>Maybe I'd better come back when you're not so busy.</i>

256
00:23:07,692 --> 00:23:12,461
Busy ? I thought you were gonna say drunk.

257
00:23:14,298 --> 00:23:16,565
But I'm not busy and I'm not drunk.

258
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:19,768
Fact is, there ain't enough whiskey in the
state of Georgia to get me drunk enough.

259
00:23:21,772 --> 00:23:24,506
Well, how drunk is drunk enough,

260
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:27,709
<i>Captain Junuh ? Whoo.</i>

261
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:30,411
Good question, Hardy. Come on over here, take a seat.

262
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:32,480
I'll tell you how drunk drunk enough is.

263
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:35,516
Aaron, you think you can find
the young man a bottle of Nehi ?

264
00:23:35,518 --> 00:23:39,053
Expect I could. Just as long as I takes my money with me.

265
00:23:43,693 --> 00:23:46,394
Now, the question on the table...

266
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:48,862
is how drunk is drunk enough ?

267
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,833
And the answer is that it's all a matter of brain cells.

268
00:23:53,835 --> 00:23:56,936
- Brain cells ? - That's right, Hardy.

269
00:23:56,938 --> 00:24:01,074
You see, every drink of liquor you
take kills a thousand brain cells.

270
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:03,843
But that doesn't much matter, 'cause we got billions more.

271
00:24:03,845 --> 00:24:05,945
And first the sadness cells die,

272
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:08,981
so you smile real big.

273
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:10,983
And then the quiet cells go,

274
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:14,019
so you just say everything real loud for no reason at all.

275
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:17,056
But that's okay, because the stupid cells go next,

276
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:21,493
so everything you say is real smart.

277
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:25,997
And finally... come the memory cells.

278
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:30,802
These are tough sons of bitches to kill.

279
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:35,740
Well, there's a golf match out at Krewe Island...

280
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:38,009
between Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen,

281
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:41,512
and there was a meeting to see who
would stand up for Savannah in the match,

282
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,581
so I said you would.

283
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,983
That's why I'm here,
so you can beat Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen.

284
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:51,521
Hell, I'm a whole lot drunker than I thought.

285
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,491
I'll caddie for ya. You gonna caddie for me ?

286
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,927
Against Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen ? Yes, sir !

287
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,529
- I'll caddie for you too. - Aaron will carry the clubs.

288
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:03,133
I'll carry the balls. And I'll carry them little wooden tees !

289
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,034
And I'll carry Junuh !

290
00:25:06,804 --> 00:25:08,971
I wasn't jokin' !

291
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:12,508
I heard my dad tell how you won every golf
tournament there ever was in the South.

292
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,511
And how you hit a drive so long...

293
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:19,815
that they made you stop playin' for 20
minutes just to measure it for a record.

294
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,984
And how you used to swing righty,

295
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:25,520
but you was in the woods once by this tree,
and there was no room to swing righty,

296
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:28,523
so you borrowed some guy's lefty club...

297
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:31,826
and hit the ball six inches from the hole.

298
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:37,499
It's time for you to go home, Hardy.

299
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:39,534
I ain't goin'.

300
00:25:39,536 --> 00:25:41,803
Well, suit yourself, 'cause I'm goin' to bed.

301
00:25:50,146 --> 00:25:52,413
Night, gentlemen.

302
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:06,893
- The hell you doin' in my house ? - Trespassin', Junuh.

303
00:26:06,895 --> 00:26:10,430
But on a matter of great importance--
to no less than Savannah herself.

304
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:13,499
Some delegate you got there.
Isn't it a little past his bedtime ?

305
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:18,004
Isaiah 11:6: "And a little child shall lead them."

306
00:26:18,006 --> 00:26:23,108
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Junuh.

307
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,746
<i>So what's in it for you ? Pride.</i>

308
00:26:27,748 --> 00:26:31,850
The great city of Savannah,
so close to my heart. So close to all our hearts.

309
00:26:31,852 --> 00:26:34,519
Well, you're wastin' your time ? I'm not playin'.

310
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:36,955
Why is that ?

311
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:39,024
I lost my swing.

312
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:42,993
Then find it. Goddamn it !

313
00:26:42,995 --> 00:26:46,530
<i>Because you're playin' !
That's all there is to it ! Savannah needs you, Junuh !</i>

314
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:50,201
<i>Why don't you get Dougal McDermott ? He'll play. Balls !</i>

315
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:53,137
We don't need some sawed-off
Scotsman poopin' drives out 40 yards...

316
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:55,105
<i>in Jones' and Hagen's way.</i>

317
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:58,741
<i>We need a man with thunder in his fist,</i>

318
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:02,111
a hero to boom that pill out past those golfin' gods !

319
00:27:02,113 --> 00:27:05,882
- We need a knight. - You are our gentle-born chevalier.

320
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:12,188
That's one hell of a speech, fellas.

321
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,257
I don't take no for an answer.

322
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:17,926
Well, you're gonna have to, 'cause I'm not playin'.

323
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,162
Now get out.

324
00:27:58,066 --> 00:28:01,301
Someone you picked up on your travels ?

325
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:03,737
He's not mine.

326
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:07,073
He's a little young for a drinking companion, don't you think ?

327
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:12,979
So, Adele, what can I do for you ?

328
00:28:15,117 --> 00:28:18,317
I think you know why I'm here, Junuh. I do.

329
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:22,221
A little late to be out lookin' for romance, though, isn't it ?

330
00:28:22,223 --> 00:28:24,890
Would that do it, Junuh ?

331
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:29,762
Would you play in the match if I had sex with you ?

332
00:28:31,032 --> 00:28:33,732
Yeah, that would do it.

333
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:36,000
Well, that's good, Junuh.

334
00:28:36,002 --> 00:28:39,137
Considering how infrequently we've
seen each other since you've been back,

335
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:41,339
I thought this was gonna be more difficult.

336
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:44,108
Now, where would you like to do it ?

337
00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:48,012
Right here is fine.

338
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:55,285
Don't worry about him. He's out like a light.

339
00:28:55,287 --> 00:28:58,355
Take an earthquake to wake him up.

340
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:03,293
For an earthquake, you'd have to play
many more tournaments at Krewe Island...

341
00:29:03,295 --> 00:29:05,996
and do quite well at them.

342
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:16,072
Well,

343
00:29:16,074 --> 00:29:19,008
how do you suggest we begin ?

344
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,243
Shall I just run and jump on you,

345
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:24,814
or would you like some preliminary romancin' ?

346
00:29:24,816 --> 00:29:29,185
- Romancin' sounds good. - Very well, then.

347
00:29:36,226 --> 00:29:38,960
Here's one short kiss.

348
00:29:38,962 --> 00:29:42,897
It is, I'm afraid, all the romancin' I have in me at this time.

349
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:21,801
I do hope I haven't given the
impression that I'm cryin' over us, Junuh,

350
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:24,370
because I'm not.

351
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:27,807
You're not ?

352
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,175
No, I'm not.

353
00:30:30,177 --> 00:30:32,077
I'm cryin' over Savannah.

354
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,379
Savannah ?

355
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:37,816
Over her pain and the pain of her people.

356
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:42,854
You're in tears over Savannah ? I am.

357
00:30:42,856 --> 00:30:45,323
I truly am.

358
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:48,093
Then who'd you take your clothes off for ?

359
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:50,027
Chattanooga ?

360
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,400
Well.

361
00:30:56,402 --> 00:31:00,371
<i>This certainly has been a colossal waste of time.</i>

362
00:31:00,373 --> 00:31:03,240
I didn't ask you to come here.

363
00:31:03,242 --> 00:31:07,211
No, you certainly did not, Junuh.

364
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:11,114
You know, if you ever get tired of sittin'
around and feelin' sorry for yourself,

365
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:13,750
a little golf might just do you some good.

366
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:16,319
I've lost my swing, Adele.

367
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:19,389
Really ?

368
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,160
Where'd it go ?

369
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:36,405
You can open your eyes now, Hardy.

370
00:31:36,407 --> 00:31:39,341
Your education is over.

371
00:31:39,343 --> 00:31:42,411
Go on home now.

372
00:32:34,796 --> 00:32:36,395
Jesus.

373
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,980
- Who's that ? - Just me.

374
00:32:58,118 --> 00:33:01,352
Just a man tryin' to find somewhere to rest his tired feet,

375
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,954
takin' in some of God's glories.

376
00:33:03,956 --> 00:33:07,024
- My, what a night. - I could've killed you out there.

377
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,826
Oh, no, sir.

378
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:11,929
See, I set myself directly in front of you.

379
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:15,599
Judgin' by how you was hittin' them balls,
I figured that's where I'd be out of harm's way.

380
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:17,835
Excuse me, sir.

381
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:23,239
They say you can tell a player by his grip.

382
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:27,243
If you want some food or somethin',
you can go on into the house, help yourself.

383
00:33:27,245 --> 00:33:29,245
Oh, thank you kindly, sir.

384
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:31,280
<i>Yeah.</i>

385
00:33:31,282 --> 00:33:34,116
Yeah, I always felt a man's grip on his club...

386
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:36,185
is just like a man's grip on his world.

387
00:33:36,187 --> 00:33:39,388
- Look, is there somethin' you want ?
- Five dollars guaranteed.

388
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,623
Guaranteed for what ?

389
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:45,193
Well, there's a big match comin' up with Mr.
Jones and Mr. Hagen.

390
00:33:45,195 --> 00:33:47,395
Fella gonna be needin' a caddie.

391
00:33:47,397 --> 00:33:49,397
You a caddie ?

392
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:53,301
Well, that depends. You a golfer ?

393
00:33:56,273 --> 00:33:59,374
Well, I don't need a caddie 'cause I'm not playin'.

394
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:01,308
I don't play anymore at all.

395
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,578
Oh. Well, thank you, sir.

396
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,381
I'll take you up on that food you offered me. All right.

397
00:34:07,383 --> 00:34:09,884
Evenin', sir. Mm-hmm.

398
00:34:11,153 --> 00:34:13,387
<i>Don't make no sense, is all.</i>

399
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:17,358
Man say he don't play no golf,
yet he out here this shade of night,

400
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,659
hittin' balls off into dark where he can't even see 'em.

401
00:34:19,661 --> 00:34:23,396
Yep, well, I've done things that made less sense.

402
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:26,633
As we all have.

403
00:34:26,635 --> 00:34:30,403
For $5 guaranteed, I'm offerin' you my caddie services.

404
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:32,438
For $5 ?

405
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,042
You know the winner gets 10,000,
and the caddie's cut is 10% of that.

406
00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:39,077
So that's $1,000. I'll take $5 guaranteed.

407
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,047
- You don't want $1,000 ?
- You done already said you ain't even playin'.

408
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:45,417
And Lord knows how awful you're gonna look if you do.

409
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:48,420
So $5 guaranteed sounds pretty good from where I'm sittin'.

410
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:55,360
Yeah, the rhythm of the game just like the rhythm of life.

411
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:56,995
Here.

412
00:34:56,997 --> 00:34:59,063
Here !

413
00:34:59,065 --> 00:35:01,332
Oh, no, sir, I don't-- Go on.

414
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:04,368
Go ahead.

415
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,071
Well, thank you, sir.

416
00:35:11,144 --> 00:35:15,279
You know, some folks say you should put
the ball in-- in the front of your stance.

417
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:17,280
Other folks say you should put--

418
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:21,318
You gonna hit the ball or are you gonna dance with it ?

419
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,620
Actually, I'm kind of partial to dancin'. Me and this gal--

420
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,655
Hit the ball.

421
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,600
So, you're a golfer.

422
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:41,403
Uh, no, I don't play golf.

423
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:44,039
Give me that damn thing.

424
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,677
Here, uh-- See, the trick is...

425
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,980
to find your swing.

426
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,282
What'd you say ?

427
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,417
Well, you lost your swing.

428
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:59,287
We got to go find it.

429
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:04,158
Now, it's somewhere in the harmony of all that is--

430
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:07,395
Ooh.

431
00:36:07,397 --> 00:36:09,998
All that was--

432
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:15,602
Ooh. All that will be.

433
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,008
Whoa. Ooo-eee !

434
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,344
I ain't seen a man hit a ball like that...

435
00:36:24,346 --> 00:36:27,647
since the North-South Championship of 1916.

436
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:32,285
You know, they stopped play for 20
minutes to measure how far it went.

437
00:36:32,287 --> 00:36:34,420
Bagger Vance the name.

438
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:40,326
Come on, let's hit a few more.

439
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:46,432
And that, they say,
is how Bagger Vance became Junuh's caddie.

440
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:48,734
Oh, yeah. One more just like that.

441
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:51,437
Just like that one there.

442
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:53,705
I'm tellin' you the truth, Wilbur Charles.

443
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:58,343
She was down to her panties and brassiere.

444
00:36:58,345 --> 00:37:00,578
And you were in the room watchin' all the time ?

445
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,747
You really think we're that stupid that we believe...

446
00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:06,384
Miss Adele got down to her skivvies
with you right in the room watching ?

447
00:37:06,386 --> 00:37:08,386
It's the God's honest truth, Eugene.

448
00:37:08,388 --> 00:37:11,722
Scalp me, shrink my head, and roast it on the stake...

449
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:13,657
if that ain't exactly what happened.

450
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:16,627
She thought I was asleep the whole time.

451
00:37:16,629 --> 00:37:19,163
And that ain't all. Junuh's gonna play.

452
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:22,066
He said that ?

453
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:26,103
Not in so many words, but-- Hey, look over there.

454
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:29,840
Ain't that Miss Adele now across
the street ? Where ? Where ?

455
00:37:29,842 --> 00:37:33,142
She just went into Louder's Notions. I could swear it's her.

456
00:37:33,144 --> 00:37:35,144
I'd know that figure anywhere.

457
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:44,420
Well, as far as Junuh is concerned, I guess that's just about it.

458
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:48,424
If we don't have someone from Savannah,
I will not support this match.

459
00:37:48,426 --> 00:37:50,625
All right.

460
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:54,362
I'll play in your damn golf match.

461
00:37:54,364 --> 00:37:57,232
I should've let you finish what you started.

462
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,434
<i>Now I got nothin' at all to show for it.</i>

463
00:37:59,436 --> 00:38:03,238
Well, for the life of me, I have no idea what you're referrin' to.

464
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,675
I can explain it if you like.
I don't believe that will be necessary !

465
00:38:06,677 --> 00:38:09,110
God bless Savannah.

466
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:19,120
The day that Jones and Hagen arrived in Savannah...

467
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:21,355
was declared a holiday.

468
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,410
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first golf tournament--

469
00:38:44,412 --> 00:38:46,812
That's O.B. Keeler.

470
00:38:46,814 --> 00:38:48,847
He writes for theAtlanta Journal.

471
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:51,416
He goes wherever Bobby Jones goes.

472
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:54,419
And that's Walter Hagen's man, Spec Hammond.

473
00:38:54,421 --> 00:38:57,289
They say Hagen won't play without him.

474
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:03,762
And that's Grantland Rice,
the most powerful sports writer in the country.

475
00:39:03,764 --> 00:39:06,397
And he's staying at our boarding house,
because he's nobody's man.

476
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:09,600
Aah !

477
00:39:10,937 --> 00:39:14,939
Mr. Robert Tyre Jones, Jr., of Atlanta, Georgia.

478
00:39:23,383 --> 00:39:26,650
Mr. Jones has won 13 national championships,

479
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:30,420
including four U.S. Opens and five U.S. Amateurs.

480
00:39:30,422 --> 00:39:36,393
He has also won all three British
Opens in which he has played.

481
00:39:36,395 --> 00:39:38,862
For the first time in history, last year...

482
00:39:38,864 --> 00:39:41,765
he won the Grand Slam--

483
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:45,401
all four major golf championships in a single year !

484
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:53,709
But what is not well-known is that at the very same time...

485
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:55,644
he was winnin' all his championships,

486
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:59,748
Mr. Jones was earning a degree
in engineering from Georgia Tech,

487
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,917
a degree in English Literature from Harvard,

488
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:06,254
and a law degree from Emory University here in Georgia,

489
00:40:06,256 --> 00:40:08,456
all with distinction.

490
00:40:13,697 --> 00:40:15,697
Mr. Walter Hagen--

491
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,904
Mr. Hagen has won 11 national championships,

492
00:40:23,906 --> 00:40:27,841
includin' four British Opens and five PGA's.

493
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:30,477
And in one stretch,

494
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:33,747
Mr. Hagen won 22 straight professional championships.

495
00:40:37,386 --> 00:40:39,253
That's work !

496
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:42,989
Mr. Rannulph Junuh--

497
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:56,302
Walter, I think we're the underdogs.

498
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,741
Born and bred in Savannah, Georgia !

499
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:17,355
Mr.-- Mr. Junuh won the Georgia Amateur at the age of 16,

500
00:41:17,357 --> 00:41:19,957
makin' him the youngest man to ever do so.

501
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:22,459
And until he left for the war, was considered...

502
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:25,362
the South's premier golfer.

503
00:41:25,364 --> 00:41:28,832
Mr. Junuh returned from the war a hero,

504
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:31,702
decorated with the Medal of Honor...

505
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:34,438
for survivin' a deadly mission in which...

506
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,007
most--

507
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:43,479
Most-- uh--

508
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:47,483
The rest of his company were tragically defeated.

509
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:50,453
Boy, makes you think twice about
steppin' on his ball, doesn't it, Bobby ?

510
00:41:52,424 --> 00:41:54,357
Mr. Hagen.

511
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:02,464
Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen...

512
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:04,900
and our very own Rannulph Junuh !

513
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:16,478
On behalf--

514
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,747
On behalf of the great city of Savannah--

515
00:42:22,652 --> 00:42:25,486
Sure is some storm a-brewin'.

516
00:42:27,457 --> 00:42:30,024
So, where you off to ?

517
00:42:30,026 --> 00:42:32,360
However far it takes.

518
00:42:32,362 --> 00:42:35,496
<i>You don't expect me to stay around here,
do you ? Oh, no, not me.</i>

519
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:39,799
I consider it one of the six great miracles of
the world you was even there at all today.

520
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:42,435
<i>Let me help you with these bags.</i>

521
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:44,971
You heard Adele.

522
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:48,408
Bobby Jones never finished lower than
second in any tournament he ever played in.

523
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,078
I believe Miss Adele said he finished lower than second once.

524
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,048
Must've been the week he took his law exams.

525
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,116
Yeah, I believe it was.

526
00:42:59,787 --> 00:43:03,455
Uh, you gonna be needin' these
shoes where you're goin', Mr. Junuh ?

527
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:05,457
They look like they just about my size.

528
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:08,460
Keep 'em. Thank you kindly, sir.

529
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,404
Yep, sure is some storm headin' this way.

530
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,014
It's a real pleasure to welcome you to our home.

531
00:43:30,016 --> 00:43:32,784
It's a pleasure to be here, ma'am. Thank you.

532
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:34,951
Hardy, you take his belongin's up to his room.

533
00:43:34,953 --> 00:43:37,888
Then come right back. I got chores for you. Yes, ma'am.

534
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:41,725
I expect this is the most exciting sportin' event ever.

535
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:44,060
<i>Ain't it, Mr. Rice ? Why is that, son ?</i>

536
00:43:44,062 --> 00:43:47,864
Why ? 'Cause of Jones and Hagen. They's out for blood.

537
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:50,167
Oh, I didn't come for Jones or Hagen.

538
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,502
I came for Rannulph Junuh.

539
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:56,205
You come all the way down from New York City to see Junuh ?

540
00:43:56,207 --> 00:43:58,207
Uh-huh.

541
00:43:58,209 --> 00:44:01,977
I saw Junuh play once. Then he disappeared.

542
00:44:01,979 --> 00:44:05,781
I'd love to see him play again,
especially against Jones and Hagen.

543
00:44:08,453 --> 00:44:11,153
Go get 'em, Junuh ! You go get 'em !

544
00:44:11,155 --> 00:44:14,923
God bless you, Junuh ! Show 'em what Savannah's made of !

545
00:44:14,925 --> 00:44:18,726
- Go get 'em, Junuh ! - Hey, Junuh, give 'em hell !

546
00:44:20,997 --> 00:44:22,931
- "Give 'em hell." - You can do it !

547
00:44:41,951 --> 00:44:43,884
Damn.

548
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:50,113
So I takes it you was interested in bein'...

549
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:52,015
<i>Mr. Junuh's forecaddie.</i>

550
00:45:53,218 --> 00:45:55,785
- No. - No ?

551
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:58,154
- No ! - No ?

552
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:00,256
Well, maybe I was,

553
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:03,993
but I guess I just ain't got the nerve to ask you yet.

554
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,863
I ain't got the time to sit around and wait,
so here's what I'm proposin'.

555
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:10,198
I'm gonna assume that just about the
moment you gets up the nerve to ask me...

556
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,702
gonna be just about the same moment
I decide I'm gonna tell you yeah.

557
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:16,004
How that suit you ?

558
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:19,274
That suits me just fine, sir. Folks call me Bagger.

559
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,280
Yes, sir, Bagger, sir.

560
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,282
You may want to get to pickin' all
the crud out of Mr. Junuh's shoes.

561
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:32,253
<i>You through with that, we got us some
measurin' to do out on the course.</i>

562
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:55,141
Junuh knew now that if he were to have
any chance at all in the tournament,

563
00:46:55,143 --> 00:46:59,012
he had no choice but to come to terms with his demons.

564
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:04,150
The only question in Junuh's mind...

565
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:07,286
was which demon was givin' him the most aggravation:

566
00:47:07,288 --> 00:47:10,656
Bagger Vance or Miss Adele Invergordon.

567
00:47:11,726 --> 00:47:13,726
<i>Mr. Jones ?</i>

568
00:47:13,728 --> 00:47:15,928
<i>Could you hold, please ?</i>

569
00:47:18,766 --> 00:47:21,166
Thank you very much, Mr. Jones.

570
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,114
<i>Any time now. Okay.</i>

571
00:47:37,283 --> 00:47:39,917
<i>That's very nice.</i>

572
00:47:39,919 --> 00:47:42,253
<i>Thank you very much, Mr. Hagen.</i>

573
00:47:53,065 --> 00:47:55,332
<i>Dancin' picture, sir ?</i>

574
00:47:57,336 --> 00:47:59,970
Thank you very much.

575
00:48:01,906 --> 00:48:04,907
That's it. Very nice look. Right over here.

576
00:48:04,909 --> 00:48:08,277
<i>Big smile. No, don't stop dancin'. Stay together.</i>

577
00:48:08,279 --> 00:48:11,147
<i>Just pretend there's music. Keep goin'. Keep goin'.</i>

578
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:14,216
<i>Look right over here. Okay.</i>

579
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,220
<i>Give me a smile.</i>

580
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:22,223
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

581
00:48:27,931 --> 00:48:30,298
May I have the pleasure of this dance, please ? Yes.

582
00:48:38,108 --> 00:48:40,808
Longer.

583
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,310
A little shorter.

584
00:48:43,312 --> 00:48:45,312
How's that ?

585
00:48:45,314 --> 00:48:47,881
<i>Yeah, that's good. One stride equals a yard.</i>

586
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,317
You go on over to the tee and start countin'.

587
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,320
Top golfers always tried to get a leg up on the competition...

588
00:48:53,322 --> 00:48:56,890
by havin' the men they trusted most
sneak onto the course at night...

589
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,959
and do their own measurements.

590
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:03,029
So Bagger and I walked the course that night, measurin' away.

591
00:49:03,031 --> 00:49:05,198
Bagger never wrote down a number.

592
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,266
He filed it all in his head.

593
00:49:11,272 --> 00:49:13,039
Hit one a little harder.

594
00:49:17,278 --> 00:49:19,778
Go on, do that again.

595
00:49:21,115 --> 00:49:25,250
Yeah, right here is where this game is won,

596
00:49:25,252 --> 00:49:28,887
right here on the green, but first you got to see it.

597
00:49:28,889 --> 00:49:31,757
<i>Sun gonna be there in the mornin',</i>

598
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:34,760
over there in the afternoon.

599
00:49:34,762 --> 00:49:37,129
Funny thing is, blades of grass...

600
00:49:37,131 --> 00:49:39,764
are gonna follow the sun.

601
00:49:42,935 --> 00:49:44,935
<i>The grain is gonna shift.</i>

602
00:49:46,305 --> 00:49:48,906
That same putt...

603
00:49:48,908 --> 00:49:51,308
is gonna go one way in the mornin',

604
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:53,811
the other in the afternoon.

605
00:49:53,813 --> 00:49:56,780
One way in the mornin', the other in the afternoon.

606
00:49:56,782 --> 00:49:58,348
<i>You see that ?</i>

607
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:02,252
Yeah, a golf course puts folks through quite a punishment.

608
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:06,089
It lives and breathes just like us.

609
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:09,993
Do you think Junuh can win ?

610
00:50:09,995 --> 00:50:13,563
Yeah, if he can find his authentic swing.

611
00:50:13,565 --> 00:50:15,331
Authentic ?

612
00:50:17,134 --> 00:50:19,334
Go on, hit one more for me.

613
00:50:25,009 --> 00:50:27,342
Yep, inside each and every one of us...

614
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:29,945
is one true, authentic swing.

615
00:50:29,947 --> 00:50:34,249
<i>Somethin' we was born with,
somethin' that's ours and ours alone.</i>

616
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:37,218
Somethin' that can't be taught to you or learned.

617
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,087
Somethin' that got to be remembered.

618
00:50:40,089 --> 00:50:43,291
Over time, the world can rob us of that swing.

619
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:46,127
<i>It get buried inside us under...</i>

620
00:50:47,363 --> 00:50:50,364
all our wouldas and couldas and shouldas.

621
00:50:50,366 --> 00:50:54,000
<i>Some folks even forget what they swing was like.</i>

622
00:50:55,337 --> 00:50:58,371
Some folks even forget what they swing was like.

623
00:51:01,176 --> 00:51:04,578
<i>You keep swingin'. But I don't have any balls.</i>

624
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:08,248
Don't worry about hittin' the ball the way it's gonna go.

625
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:11,318
<i>Just swing the club, feel the club.</i>

626
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,552
<i>Now close your eyes.</i>

627
00:51:13,554 --> 00:51:17,356
<i>Close my-- You can't make that ball go in that hole.</i>

628
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:20,359
You got to let it.

629
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:24,363
I want you to feel that club, feel the weight of the club.

630
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:27,566
Settle in deeper, then drop the ball soft as butter.

631
00:51:27,568 --> 00:51:30,603
Listen to the sounds of the night.

632
00:51:30,605 --> 00:51:34,205
You just keep swingin' that club until
you feel the breeze comin' off the sea.

633
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:37,575
Inside every one of us is one true, authentic swing.

634
00:51:39,379 --> 00:51:42,380
You just keep swingin' that club until your authentic swing--

635
00:51:42,382 --> 00:51:46,384
You're part of the whole thing, somethin' you was born with.

636
00:51:46,386 --> 00:51:48,386
That's a good thing.

637
00:51:48,388 --> 00:51:51,388
I don't feel a thing.

638
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,958
You just keep swingin' that club
until you're part of the whole thing.

639
00:51:56,095 --> 00:51:58,996
That's a good thing.

640
00:51:58,998 --> 00:52:01,632
Can you see it ?

641
00:52:12,977 --> 00:52:15,544
<i>All right, time to go.</i>

642
00:52:15,546 --> 00:52:16,979
Why ?

643
00:52:28,226 --> 00:52:32,227
They say that God is happiest when His children are at play.

644
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:37,198
Well, it certainly seemed like God was in fine
spirits when the day of the match dawned.

645
00:52:41,538 --> 00:52:44,673
People came from far and wide.

646
00:52:44,675 --> 00:52:49,710
There wasn't a room to be found in either
boarding house or the Krewe Island Hotel.

647
00:52:49,712 --> 00:52:53,180
The match had been designed as the ultimate championship:

648
00:52:53,182 --> 00:52:55,182
thirty-six holes on Saturday...

649
00:52:55,184 --> 00:52:58,619
followed by another grueling thirty-six holes on Sunday.

650
00:53:05,561 --> 00:53:07,528
Good luck today.

651
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:23,576
Where's Hagen ?

652
00:53:23,578 --> 00:53:25,511
Oh, he'll be here.

653
00:53:55,675 --> 00:53:58,242
Hello, Mr. Junuh. How are you ? Bob, how are you ? Walter.

654
00:53:58,244 --> 00:54:01,245
They do put on a splendid show, don't they, O.B. ?

655
00:54:01,247 --> 00:54:04,248
I hear that later today they'll even be hittin' some golf balls.

656
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:07,650
Ladies and gentlemen.

657
00:54:07,652 --> 00:54:10,453
By virtue of the draw,

658
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,256
Mr. Jones will hit first,

659
00:54:13,258 --> 00:54:16,259
Mr. Hagen second,

660
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:18,261
and then Mr. Junuh.

661
00:54:35,246 --> 00:54:37,246
Shh.

662
00:54:40,551 --> 00:54:42,751
And then suddenly, in that moment,

663
00:54:42,753 --> 00:54:46,254
I felt as if I could hear the earth breathin' beneath me.

664
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,606
Junuh hit a promising opening drive,

665
00:55:41,608 --> 00:55:43,441
and I was sure he was on his way.

666
00:55:45,745 --> 00:55:49,247
Nice shot. Absolutely.

667
00:55:55,755 --> 00:56:01,191
It's hard to imagine three more
different approaches to the game of golf.

668
00:56:01,193 --> 00:56:05,229
Bobby Jones's swing was a study of grace in motion.

669
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:09,266
He had a way of making the difficult shots look easy...

670
00:56:09,268 --> 00:56:11,735
and the easy shots look even easier.

671
00:56:19,145 --> 00:56:22,612
Hagen, on the other hand,
hit more bad shots in a single game...

672
00:56:22,614 --> 00:56:24,614
than most golfers do in a season.

673
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:30,620
But Hagen had long ago learned one thing.

674
00:56:32,657 --> 00:56:37,160
Three lousy shots and one brilliant shot can still make par.

675
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:44,799
And Junuh, well, even now I can't think of it without wincin'.

676
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:55,477
Beach. Go ball, go.

677
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:58,779
<i>Yep. Beach.</i>

678
00:57:00,716 --> 00:57:04,285
We sure got lovely weather for it
this morning, though, don't we ?

679
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,220
Let me get that from you, sir.

680
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:20,967
Any ideas ?

681
00:57:20,969 --> 00:57:23,570
Hmm. About what ?

682
00:57:26,575 --> 00:57:28,508
Could you give me a club ?

683
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,783
Yeah. That's a good one there.

684
00:57:47,595 --> 00:57:50,796
What the hell's wrong with his grip ?

685
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:08,012
By the end of five holes, Junuh was five strokes behind...

686
00:58:08,014 --> 00:58:11,782
with 67 holes to go.

687
00:58:11,784 --> 00:58:16,253
And things would've been a lot worse if
it weren't for Junuh's shot on the sixth.

688
00:58:26,732 --> 00:58:29,833
It was a birdie, one stroke under par...

689
00:58:29,835 --> 00:58:33,769
for the hole, moving him to four behind Jones and Hagen...

690
00:58:33,771 --> 00:58:36,772
and his only glimmer of hope for the entire round.

691
00:58:36,774 --> 00:58:38,841
I think I found my game.

692
00:58:38,843 --> 00:58:42,044
Good news, Mr. Junuh.
Now all we gots to do is figure out what game that is.

693
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:48,517
By the 18th tee, at the close of the morning round,

694
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:50,919
Jones and Hagen were neck and neck.

695
00:59:00,063 --> 00:59:04,065
And as for Junuh-- This is becoming embarrassing.

696
00:59:04,067 --> 00:59:08,569
Oh, no, sir. It's been embarrassing for quite some time now.

697
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:33,893
May I make a suggestion to you ?

698
00:59:33,895 --> 00:59:37,697
What now ? - Why don't you just hook it out of bounds ?

699
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:41,967
Yeah. Just curve it out over them pretty trees into the ocean.

700
00:59:41,969 --> 00:59:47,640
Really, just do what you been doin'.
Then you'll be so far out the match,

701
00:59:47,642 --> 00:59:49,841
man, we can just relax, enjoy ourselves the rest of the way.

702
00:59:49,843 --> 00:59:51,810
Yeah.

703
00:59:59,753 --> 01:00:02,454
What you waitin' for ? Go on.

704
01:00:02,456 --> 01:00:05,090
Just hook it to hell and gone. Put yourself out your misery.

705
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:51,466
You want to quit, Mr. Junuh ?

706
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:55,003
You can just go ahead and creep off somewhere.

707
01:00:55,005 --> 01:00:59,074
I'll tell folk you took sick.
Truth be told, ain't nobody gonna really object.

708
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:03,078
Fact, they'd probably be happy as bugs in a
bake shop, see you pack up and go home.

709
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,747
You know I can't quit.

710
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:08,516
I know.

711
01:01:08,518 --> 01:01:10,651
Just makin' sure you know it too.

712
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:36,676
Man alive ! The fairway.

713
01:01:48,756 --> 01:01:51,924
Hello, Bagger. Hello. Mr. Bagger Vance.

714
01:01:51,926 --> 01:01:54,560
I want an explanation. It better be a good one.

715
01:01:54,562 --> 01:01:56,929
What on God's green earth are you tellin' him ?

716
01:01:56,931 --> 01:01:59,097
Sir, I'd sure be most appreciative if
we could talk about this a bit later.

717
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:01,099
Right now I'm busy assisting Mr. Junuh.

718
01:02:01,101 --> 01:02:03,569
Well, you have done a hell of a job of it so far. Okay, okay !

719
01:02:03,571 --> 01:02:05,570
Let me talk to him, Neskaloosa.

720
01:02:05,572 --> 01:02:08,005
Mr. Vance, I think what the judge is trying to determine here...

721
01:02:08,007 --> 01:02:11,809
is what exactly your strategy is for
helping poor Mr. Junuh find his game,

722
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,879
because to the untrained observer it appears
you know as much about being a caddie...

723
01:02:14,881 --> 01:02:17,114
as I do about driving a locomotive.

724
01:02:17,116 --> 01:02:19,116
Oh, you-all want to know my strategy.

725
01:02:19,118 --> 01:02:22,687
Well, right now my player is a little confused about who he is.

726
01:02:22,689 --> 01:02:25,522
See, he still thinks he's Rannulph Junuh.

727
01:02:25,524 --> 01:02:28,558
He is Rannulph Junuh, you damn twit.

728
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,561
Well, he is and he ain't.

729
01:02:45,142 --> 01:02:48,611
Thank you. Thank you.

730
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:21,875
Anybody drinkin' ? Here. I'm gonna get a drink.

731
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,700
It'll come.

732
01:04:05,886 --> 01:04:08,620
I had me a uncle named Rufus.

733
01:04:08,622 --> 01:04:11,957
<i>Lost his right arm in a cotton gin.</i>

734
01:04:11,959 --> 01:04:15,093
Learned how to do everything with his left arm.

735
01:04:15,095 --> 01:04:19,029
<i>Then he lost that changing a wagon wheel.</i>

736
01:04:19,031 --> 01:04:22,166
Axle snapped.
So he learned how to do everything with his teeth.

737
01:04:22,168 --> 01:04:24,835
- It was a mistake.
- One night he says some dumb things to Mr. Johnny...

738
01:04:24,837 --> 01:04:26,370
<i>he shouldn't had said.</i>

739
01:04:26,372 --> 01:04:28,706
Mr. Johnny knock all the teeth out his head.

740
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:31,108
So he learned how to do everything with his feet.

741
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:36,879
Up till he got this, uh, fungus. It grew--

742
01:04:36,881 --> 01:04:40,116
- Stop it. - I'm trying to tell you about overcoming adversity.

743
01:04:40,118 --> 01:04:43,119
Listen, you want to talk to me about my grip, fine.

744
01:04:43,121 --> 01:04:47,657
- Talk about my swing, fine.
- You don't wanna hear about the fungus ?

745
01:04:47,659 --> 01:04:50,827
He became a dancer. Oh, he made a fortune.

746
01:04:50,829 --> 01:04:56,331
It was the most amazing thing to see this armless,
toothless man sliding across the stage...

747
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,934
to the music of Bessie Smith and the Duke.

748
01:05:00,971 --> 01:05:03,872
I don't care if I'm 12 strokes back. I just don't.

749
01:05:03,874 --> 01:05:06,775
<i>You don't even want to win ?</i>

750
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:10,145
- It's just a game, Bagger. - Ah. Yes, sir.

751
01:05:10,147 --> 01:05:12,881
You done said it yourself now. Just a game.

752
01:05:12,883 --> 01:05:16,817
<i>So maybe, just maybe,
there is something else that's rilin' you.</i>

753
01:05:16,819 --> 01:05:20,154
Maybe you thought you was just
gonna sashay out onto that green...

754
01:05:20,156 --> 01:05:24,992
and the old hero of Savannah just reappear all by hisself.

755
01:05:24,994 --> 01:05:27,428
Don't work that way, is all.

756
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:30,031
<i>The Junuh you was, you ain't never gonna be again.</i>

757
01:05:31,434 --> 01:05:34,334
Ever. That's all I'm sayin'.

758
01:05:35,904 --> 01:05:38,138
You don't know a damn thing about me.

759
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:41,141
I know one thing for sure. You gonna look pretty foolish...

760
01:05:41,143 --> 01:05:43,143
with two different shoes on your feet.

761
01:05:43,145 --> 01:05:45,445
<i>Ah, Jesus.</i>

762
01:05:45,447 --> 01:05:48,348
You got an answer for everything, don't you, Bagger ?

763
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:53,019
Let me tell you something.
There's no difference between winning and losing...

764
01:05:53,021 --> 01:05:55,454
and anything in between.

765
01:05:55,456 --> 01:05:58,457
What's lost is lost. A man lives. A man dies.

766
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:02,161
And in the end it all turns out the same.

767
01:06:02,163 --> 01:06:05,330
You're alone. And that's all you're ever gonna be.

768
01:06:05,332 --> 01:06:08,801
Is that a fact ? Alone.

769
01:06:08,803 --> 01:06:12,171
So, a soul is born with everything that the Lord can give it,

770
01:06:12,173 --> 01:06:16,174
and things don't go its way, so it just gives up,
and the good Lord takes everything back ?

771
01:06:16,176 --> 01:06:20,712
- That's right. - And then the soul dies.

772
01:06:20,714 --> 01:06:25,349
- Alone. Was that pretty much what you're sayin' ?
- That's right.

773
01:06:25,351 --> 01:06:28,820
That's a sad story, Mr. Junuh.

774
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:33,223
<i>Yes, it is. And that's just about the dumbest thing...</i>

775
01:06:33,225 --> 01:06:36,993
I heard any fool say... ever.

776
01:06:36,995 --> 01:06:41,798
<i>You got yourself a hard eye there, Mr. Junuh.</i>

777
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,968
Soul is born with everything, it dies, and the good Lord--

778
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:47,237
You're a funny man, Mr. Junuh.

779
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:52,041
Now, what I hear, Bobby's just waitin' to make his big move.

780
01:06:52,043 --> 01:06:54,043
He doesn't wanna peak too early.

781
01:06:54,045 --> 01:06:56,312
You think Walter doesn't know that ?

782
01:06:56,314 --> 01:06:59,048
He's keeping pace with Bobby step for step.

783
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:03,986
And when Bobby kicks his game into
high gear, he's in for a big surprise.

784
01:07:03,988 --> 01:07:06,055
What about Junuh ?

785
01:07:06,057 --> 01:07:08,290
Well, what about him, son ?

786
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:12,927
Well, there's still three rounds to go. And that's 54 holes.

787
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:15,063
<i>All he's got to do is pick up one stroke...</i>

788
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:18,066
every four holes, and he wins.

789
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:22,070
- It's possible. - Well, it's possible, son, but it's not very likely.

790
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:25,406
I mean, I have been told that Junuh
shows no sign of gettin' his game together.

791
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:28,309
He's playin' Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen.

792
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:31,879
What do you know ?
You can't even get yourself a decent job !

793
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:35,382
Hardy ! Hardy Greaves, you come back here.

794
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,351
<i>Let him go, Ida.</i>

795
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:42,923
Been a hard time for the boy.

796
01:07:52,367 --> 01:07:56,002
There something you wanted to tell me ?

797
01:07:59,274 --> 01:08:02,375
Well, I'm tryin' to think of how to say it, Junuh.

798
01:08:04,946 --> 01:08:07,846
There is a purpose to this visit,

799
01:08:07,848 --> 01:08:11,116
and that's to apologize.

800
01:08:11,118 --> 01:08:13,451
But I'm not a naturally apologetic
woman, so it takes me longer...

801
01:08:13,453 --> 01:08:16,588
to get my thoughts in order.

802
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:21,526
I want to seem properly contrite for
having gotten you into this golf match,

803
01:08:21,528 --> 01:08:25,530
but not seem that what I did was
ill-intentioned, because it was not.

804
01:08:25,532 --> 01:08:29,066
What exactly are you apologizin' for ?

805
01:08:31,304 --> 01:08:33,370
For publicly humiliating you.

806
01:08:33,372 --> 01:08:38,542
Oh. Well, that'd be a good thing to apologize for.

807
01:08:38,544 --> 01:08:43,547
However... I think that...

808
01:08:43,549 --> 01:08:48,952
basically, what I'm trying to say is-- is that I'm sorry.

809
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:52,021
But it's not my fault.

810
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:55,558
You're the one to blame.

811
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:01,097
That's one hell of an apology, Adele.

812
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:03,566
I'd stop the tournament in a flash, if I could.

813
01:09:03,568 --> 01:09:08,303
I truly, truly would, because I know it's just gonna get worse.

814
01:09:08,305 --> 01:09:11,106
And the way you're playin' !
You're simply destroyin' any chance...

815
01:09:11,108 --> 01:09:13,475
Jones and Hagen have of playin' well.

816
01:09:13,477 --> 01:09:18,080
And your supporters, who are every man,
woman and child in Savannah,

817
01:09:18,082 --> 01:09:22,117
are so demoralized that they can
barely hold down their lunches.

818
01:09:27,323 --> 01:09:32,059
So, you want my apology or not ? No.

819
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:36,297
Well.

820
01:09:39,068 --> 01:09:41,068
That's the Junuh I know.

821
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:44,938
Just full of little surprises. What was it, Adele ?

822
01:09:46,341 --> 01:09:48,308
What did you like about us ?

823
01:09:53,015 --> 01:09:55,282
I liked the way we danced.

824
01:10:00,656 --> 01:10:01,554
What's your problem ?

825
01:10:07,094 --> 01:10:11,463
And they was just lookin' at me like
I was stupid or crazy or something.

826
01:10:11,465 --> 01:10:15,634
To think that you could beat Bobby Jones
and Walter Hagen bein' 12 strokes behind,

827
01:10:15,636 --> 01:10:19,104
even though I told them all you
had to do was pick up one stroke...

828
01:10:19,106 --> 01:10:23,308
every four holes of the next 54 holes, right ?

829
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:25,243
Yeah, right. And who do you think was tellin' me...

830
01:10:25,245 --> 01:10:27,245
what a hopeless case you was the most ?

831
01:10:27,247 --> 01:10:31,249
My very own father,
who says that he was a good friend of yours...

832
01:10:31,251 --> 01:10:33,418
until you lost your mind in the war.

833
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,420
<i>He's right.</i>

834
01:10:35,422 --> 01:10:38,256
You can't win ?

835
01:10:38,258 --> 01:10:41,058
He was a good friend of mine.

836
01:10:47,032 --> 01:10:49,266
He's sweepin' streets, Captain Junuh...

837
01:10:49,268 --> 01:10:53,036
in the middle of Savannah where everybody can see him.

838
01:10:53,038 --> 01:10:56,473
Me, my friends and everybody.

839
01:10:56,475 --> 01:11:00,042
You feelin' sorry for yourself because
your daddy's got to sweep streets ?

840
01:11:00,044 --> 01:11:02,378
He ain't the only man who can't get work.

841
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:04,613
Wilbur Charles's dad can't get work neither,

842
01:11:04,615 --> 01:11:09,452
but he says he'd rather do nothin' at
all than something beneath his dignity.

843
01:11:11,356 --> 01:11:16,058
Grow up, Hardy. It ain't time for me to grow up, Mr. Junuh.

844
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:19,761
Your daddy's out sweepin' streets
because he took every last dime he had...

845
01:11:19,763 --> 01:11:22,330
and used it to pay up every man and woman he owed...

846
01:11:22,332 --> 01:11:25,400
and every business who worked for him,
instead of declaring bankruptcy...

847
01:11:25,402 --> 01:11:29,704
like everyone else in town, including your
best friend Wilbur Charles's dad, Raymond,

848
01:11:29,706 --> 01:11:32,474
which is why he's able to sit around all day long on his dignity.

849
01:11:34,378 --> 01:11:36,511
You daddy stared adversity in the eye, Hardy,

850
01:11:36,513 --> 01:11:38,746
and he beat it back with a broom.

851
01:11:55,264 --> 01:11:57,463
You really love this game, don't you ?

852
01:11:59,701 --> 01:12:02,268
The greatest game there is.

853
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:04,604
You really think so ?

854
01:12:04,606 --> 01:12:08,441
Ask anybody. It's fun. It's hard.

855
01:12:08,443 --> 01:12:11,210
You stand out there on that green, green grass,

856
01:12:11,212 --> 01:12:15,515
and it's just you and the ball,
and there ain't nobody to beat up on but yourself.

857
01:12:15,517 --> 01:12:21,353
Just like Mr. Noonan keeps hittin' himself
with a golf club every time he gets angry.

858
01:12:21,355 --> 01:12:24,556
He's broken his toe three times on account of it.

859
01:12:24,558 --> 01:12:28,660
This is the only game I know you
can call a penalty on yourself--

860
01:12:28,662 --> 01:12:31,630
if you're honest, which most people are.

861
01:12:31,632 --> 01:12:34,800
There just ain't no other game like it.

862
01:12:39,405 --> 01:12:41,305
I better get goin'.

863
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,453
In case you didn't see that, Bobby,
remind me when we're out there.

864
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:59,289
I'll show you where it's at when
your second shot catches up to it.

865
01:13:10,836 --> 01:13:14,269
Oh, yes. Greatest game there is.

866
01:13:14,271 --> 01:13:16,438
- Right, Hardy ? - Yes, sir.

867
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,507
The greatest game there will ever be.

868
01:13:18,509 --> 01:13:21,743
Just you and the ball. All by your lonesome.

869
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:25,814
I think it's time.

870
01:13:25,816 --> 01:13:29,318
- Time for what ? - Time for you to see the field.

871
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:34,522
The field ? I see the field. It's 445 yards long.

872
01:13:34,524 --> 01:13:38,359
It's got a little red flag at the end of it.
It's 12 strokes ahead of me.

873
01:13:38,361 --> 01:13:40,695
<i>Come on. That ain't it.</i>

874
01:13:40,697 --> 01:13:43,898
'Cause if you was seein' the field,
you wouldn't be hackin' at that ball...

875
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,767
like you was choppin' weeds out from under your front porch.

876
01:13:46,769 --> 01:13:49,871
Just gimme the club.

877
01:13:49,873 --> 01:13:52,906
Sorry I bring it up. Here. You gonna take that. Hack away.

878
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,791
All right. What's the field ?

879
01:14:14,695 --> 01:14:16,662
Fix your eyes on Bobby Jones.

880
01:14:18,766 --> 01:14:21,400
Here's a piece of work here right now.

881
01:14:21,402 --> 01:14:23,335
Give the man room.

882
01:14:23,337 --> 01:14:25,271
Knock it out there, Bobby.

883
01:14:45,392 --> 01:14:47,325
Look at his practice swing.

884
01:14:49,461 --> 01:14:52,896
Almost like he was searchin' for somethin'.

885
01:14:52,898 --> 01:14:55,899
Then he finds it.

886
01:14:55,901 --> 01:14:58,869
Watch how he settle hisself right into the middle of it.

887
01:15:01,907 --> 01:15:03,907
Feel that focus.

888
01:15:06,812 --> 01:15:08,744
He got a lot of shots he could choose from.

889
01:15:09,914 --> 01:15:12,481
Duffs and tops and skulls.

890
01:15:15,587 --> 01:15:19,589
But there's only one shot that's
in perfect harmony with the field.

891
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:24,860
One shot that's his. Authentic shot.

892
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:29,431
And that shot is gonna choose him.

893
01:15:31,602 --> 01:15:35,537
There's a perfect shot out there
tryin' to find each and every one of us.

894
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:38,873
All we gotta do is get ourselves out of its way.

895
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:40,875
Let it choose us.

896
01:15:43,614 --> 01:15:46,880
Mm. Look at him. He in the field.

897
01:15:57,627 --> 01:16:01,895
Can't see that flag as some dragon you got to slay.

898
01:16:01,897 --> 01:16:04,565
You got to look with soft eyes.

899
01:16:04,567 --> 01:16:08,534
See the place where the tides and seasons...

900
01:16:08,536 --> 01:16:10,637
and the turnin' of the earth...

901
01:16:10,639 --> 01:16:12,772
all come together.

902
01:16:13,808 --> 01:16:16,709
Where everything that is...

903
01:16:16,711 --> 01:16:18,645
becomes one.

904
01:16:20,348 --> 01:16:24,450
You got to seek that place with your soul, Junuh.

905
01:16:37,431 --> 01:16:40,399
Seek it with your hands. Don't think about it.

906
01:16:40,401 --> 01:16:44,802
Feel it. Your hands is wiser than your head ever gonna be.

907
01:16:46,873 --> 01:16:48,906
I can't take you there, Junuh.

908
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:53,577
Just hopes I can help you find a way.

909
01:17:02,488 --> 01:17:06,723
Just you, that ball,

910
01:17:06,725 --> 01:17:08,725
that flag,

911
01:17:11,096 --> 01:17:13,463
and all you are-- seek it with your hands.

912
01:17:13,465 --> 01:17:15,832
Don't think about it. Feel it. You're lookin' at it, Junuh.

913
01:17:21,373 --> 01:17:24,873
Your authentic swing. That flag.

914
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:27,443
And all that you are.

915
01:18:25,633 --> 01:18:28,901
Even the blind squirrel finds an acorn now and then, Bobby.

916
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:42,781
The rest of that afternoon is a blur.

917
01:18:42,783 --> 01:18:46,651
Junuh kept asking question after question about the field,

918
01:18:46,653 --> 01:18:49,554
while Bagger just acted like nothin' much had happened...

919
01:18:49,556 --> 01:18:53,191
and kept makin' remarks about how
much Hagen's socks must have cost...

920
01:18:53,193 --> 01:18:57,128
and how long to dry tobacco leaves
before they make a good smoke.

921
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,600
But somehow, in the middle of it all,

922
01:19:03,602 --> 01:19:05,903
Junuh started playin' golf.

923
01:19:21,953 --> 01:19:26,823
As the day and the second round came
to an end, there was genuine excitement.

924
01:19:26,825 --> 01:19:29,892
I do so enjoy this little game.

925
01:19:33,097 --> 01:19:37,098
Why don't you ladies freshen up,
and I'd love you to join me for dinner.

926
01:19:40,237 --> 01:19:43,138
Hello, Hugh. Junuh.

927
01:19:44,842 --> 01:19:47,609
I'll have a double Scotch. All right, sir.

928
01:19:47,611 --> 01:19:49,911
Pretty entertaining out there today, huh ?

929
01:19:49,913 --> 01:19:52,881
That's what the people want. Entertainment.

930
01:19:57,487 --> 01:20:00,921
I got a proposition, Junuh. Exhibitions are the thing now.

931
01:20:00,923 --> 01:20:03,991
Five, ten grand for two days' work.

932
01:20:03,993 --> 01:20:06,927
How'd you like to go on tour with me ?
We'd have some good matches.

933
01:20:06,929 --> 01:20:11,632
I'd expect to win, of course. But then we'd split the money 70
- 30 afterwards.

934
01:20:11,634 --> 01:20:14,001
You'd get the 30.

935
01:20:14,003 --> 01:20:17,837
Oh, don't get me wrong.
I'm not just lookin' for another payday here.

936
01:20:17,839 --> 01:20:20,006
I couldn't breathe if it weren't for this game of golf.

937
01:20:20,008 --> 01:20:24,177
I once had the next king of England
hold the pin for me while I putted !

938
01:20:24,179 --> 01:20:28,748
Did you know that ? I did.

939
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:32,919
Yes. I've paid back everything that
golf gave me several times over.

940
01:20:32,921 --> 01:20:34,820
But now I'm on the receiving end.

941
01:20:37,224 --> 01:20:38,957
Whoo. It's the good life, Junuh.

942
01:20:40,528 --> 01:20:43,662
Why me ? The crowd likes you.

943
01:20:43,664 --> 01:20:47,633
I think we have a lot in common, you and I.

944
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:52,703
You've got no illusions that there's anything
out there worth gettin' riled up about.

945
01:20:52,705 --> 01:20:56,974
The meaning of it all is that there is no meaning.

946
01:20:56,976 --> 01:20:58,976
Ah, you'd be good company. That's all I'm sayin'.

947
01:21:01,214 --> 01:21:03,214
Thanks, Walter. I'll think it over.

948
01:21:03,216 --> 01:21:07,585
Hey. I admire the way you're dealing with this match, Junuh.

949
01:21:07,587 --> 01:21:10,922
Fighting the way you are. It's damn noble.

950
01:21:10,924 --> 01:21:13,290
But no matter how good a fighter you are,

951
01:21:13,292 --> 01:21:17,594
just remember, I can ask the king
to hold the flag for me when I putt.

952
01:21:17,596 --> 01:21:22,232
But he's not gonna give me his crown.
Neither is Bobby, and neither am I.

953
01:21:22,234 --> 01:21:25,135
I'm not asking for your crown, Walter.

954
01:21:25,137 --> 01:21:26,937
If I wanted it bad enough, I'd just take it.

955
01:22:19,989 --> 01:22:23,624
Was there something you wished to discuss ?
Because this might not be the right time to--

956
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:39,005
I can win, Adele.

957
01:22:39,007 --> 01:22:41,007
I can beat both of 'em.

958
01:22:42,644 --> 01:22:46,212
Look in my eyes and tell me what you see.

959
01:22:46,214 --> 01:22:49,080
Determination. Pure determination.

960
01:22:49,082 --> 01:22:53,418
Panic, Adele. Pure panic.

961
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:57,088
I'm eight strokes behind the two
greatest golfers in the history of the sport.

962
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:59,758
They've never blown a lead in their lives,
and I'm gonna win. You know why ?

963
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,660
Panic ? That's right.

964
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:07,097
Oh, Junuh. You don't, by any chance-- Yes.

965
01:23:10,102 --> 01:23:14,004
Oh, I ought to go back to my guests.

966
01:23:15,374 --> 01:23:17,374
Yes. I should go back to my guests.

967
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,877
You-- You will stay in touch ?

968
01:23:19,879 --> 01:23:22,880
I don't think I can wait another
12 years for the next installment.

969
01:23:25,718 --> 01:23:28,017
Was there something about me that you particularly missed ?

970
01:23:28,019 --> 01:23:32,755
Something that I can feel gratified
about depriving you of all these years ?

971
01:23:32,757 --> 01:23:35,058
I like the way we danced.

972
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:49,404
Make sure you got enough balls in there.
Got another sweater ?

973
01:23:49,406 --> 01:23:51,406
Got enough water ? Driver. I need the driver.

974
01:23:51,408 --> 01:23:53,775
This is gonna take everything I got.

975
01:23:53,777 --> 01:23:56,445
Oh, that's for sure. That's a jigger.
Help you keep it under the wind.

976
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:59,247
<i>Bagger, my putter's got more loft than this thing.</i>

977
01:23:59,249 --> 01:24:02,317
Well, actually, they just about the same.
Oh. Well, that's good.

978
01:24:02,319 --> 01:24:05,920
I'll just putt the ball down the fairway, then. Anything else ?

979
01:24:07,223 --> 01:24:10,024
Just bash the livin' shit out of it.

980
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:16,864
An iron.

981
01:24:16,866 --> 01:24:19,100
Well, I don't suppose it matters much what club you use...

982
01:24:19,102 --> 01:24:21,102
<i>when you start the day eight strokes back.</i>

983
01:24:46,761 --> 01:24:49,061
- What club was that ? - Mid-iron.

984
01:24:49,063 --> 01:24:52,831
Some kind of driving iron. Extraordinarily well-hit.

985
01:25:09,516 --> 01:25:14,418
<i>The flag ! Pull the flag, Hardy. - Yes, sir.</i>

986
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:17,989
Junuh eagled, pickin' up two strokes on the very first hole.

987
01:25:22,961 --> 01:25:26,296
And he picked up another stroke
when Jones bogeyed the second.

988
01:25:31,303 --> 01:25:35,438
And two more strokes on Hagen
when he double-bogeyed the third.

989
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:40,276
Does it look like 180 yards to you ? No.

990
01:25:40,278 --> 01:25:42,178
It's 181.

991
01:25:44,582 --> 01:25:47,850
You might wanna play that ball back just a bit in your stance.

992
01:26:32,161 --> 01:26:35,362
He just hit a hole in one ! Hot dang !

993
01:26:35,364 --> 01:26:39,866
I just seen a miracle with my own eyes !
He just hit a hole in one !

994
01:26:52,981 --> 01:26:55,982
Hey, Homer, you're not gonna believe this !
Junuh made a hole in one !

995
01:26:58,652 --> 01:27:01,987
Junuh made a hole in one ! He's gonna make it !

996
01:27:01,989 --> 01:27:03,989
He's gonna make it ! You're kiddin' !

997
01:27:03,991 --> 01:27:05,991
What ?

998
01:27:10,998 --> 01:27:12,898
What's up ? Junuh's makin' a run for it.

999
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,566
<i>He's pulled within three of Jones and two of Hagen.</i>

1000
01:27:15,568 --> 01:27:19,536
He made a hole in one on eight !
God bless Savannah and the men she propagates.

1001
01:27:30,216 --> 01:27:32,182
Let's go. Let's go !

1002
01:27:41,993 --> 01:27:44,327
Get back. Get back now.

1003
01:27:44,329 --> 01:27:47,463
How do you expect Junuh to hit
the ball if you stand on top of him ?

1004
01:27:47,465 --> 01:27:49,432
Shh !

1005
01:27:53,004 --> 01:27:56,571
His play in the third round was beautiful to watch.

1006
01:28:21,497 --> 01:28:25,266
While Jones and Hagen discovered new hazards of their own,

1007
01:28:29,339 --> 01:28:32,973
Junuh had discovered, as Bagger so eloquently put it,

1008
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:36,343
how to stop thinkin' without fallin' asleep.

1009
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:44,551
Junuh finished the third round one stroke behind.

1010
01:28:44,553 --> 01:28:49,422
It was a new match, and no one
knew it better than Jones and Hagen.

1011
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:52,491
Not now, girls. Not now.

1012
01:29:01,068 --> 01:29:04,403
Gents.

1013
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:11,743
Don't believe Walter planned on exerting himself.

1014
01:29:15,048 --> 01:29:17,315
It was fun this morning, wasn't it ?

1015
01:29:18,385 --> 01:29:20,318
Yeah, it was.

1016
01:29:22,522 --> 01:29:24,655
This is my last match, Junuh. I'm retiring.

1017
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:33,030
You're at the top of your game.

1018
01:29:33,032 --> 01:29:36,733
I've got a wife and three small children and a law practice.

1019
01:29:36,735 --> 01:29:38,602
It's time to stop.

1020
01:29:45,477 --> 01:29:49,078
It's just a game, Junuh.

1021
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:53,482
You know, I'll never forget you
winnin' the Georgia Open in 1916.

1022
01:29:55,486 --> 01:29:58,387
I'd never seen a swing so sweet...

1023
01:29:58,389 --> 01:30:00,356
or a man get so much pleasure from it.

1024
01:30:04,495 --> 01:30:07,762
This is my last 18 holes, Junuh.

1025
01:30:07,764 --> 01:30:11,666
And I been thinkin',
I couldn't have picked a better way to end it.

1026
01:30:11,668 --> 01:30:16,104
- Thank you, Bobby. - It is truly my pleasure.

1027
01:30:18,475 --> 01:30:21,709
<i>I can't let you win out of sympathy.</i>

1028
01:30:21,711 --> 01:30:23,778
You know that.

1029
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:26,347
I do.

1030
01:30:26,349 --> 01:30:28,816
And I have no intentions of losing my last match.

1031
01:31:01,783 --> 01:31:04,750
Gentlemen, excuse me, excuse me.
Let's give Mr. Junuh some room.

1032
01:31:04,752 --> 01:31:07,686
Thank you. Thank you. I'd like to have a word with you, Junuh.

1033
01:31:07,688 --> 01:31:09,855
I don't think this is a good time, Adele.

1034
01:31:09,857 --> 01:31:12,657
No. I think this is a very good time.

1035
01:31:12,659 --> 01:31:16,795
I don't wanna do anything that might
disrupt your concentration or anything.

1036
01:31:16,797 --> 01:31:19,865
But since our little encounter last night, I've been thinking.

1037
01:31:23,437 --> 01:31:26,437
Ten years and not one single solitary word from you ?

1038
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:28,806
You don't do that to someone you love.

1039
01:31:28,808 --> 01:31:33,811
I deserve better. I deserved some
correspondence and some indication of what you felt !

1040
01:31:33,813 --> 01:31:36,614
Oh, Junuh, I don't know what happened to you.

1041
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:41,385
But whatever it was, it could not have been as unbearable...

1042
01:31:41,387 --> 01:31:44,621
as a woman waitin' with no end in sight,

1043
01:31:44,623 --> 01:31:48,758
wonderin' if she's remembered or
forgotten by the man she loves.

1044
01:31:50,428 --> 01:31:53,663
You never even said you were sorry.

1045
01:31:53,665 --> 01:31:57,834
And now I'm supposed to just run into your
arms and melt like butter on a hot muffin ?

1046
01:31:57,836 --> 01:32:02,238
I'm sorry, Adele. I am. Truly sorry.

1047
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,406
It's too late for "I'm sorry," Junuh !

1048
01:32:04,408 --> 01:32:07,743
But-- Then-- Tell me what to say.

1049
01:32:07,745 --> 01:32:09,711
It was too long ago.

1050
01:32:11,582 --> 01:32:13,448
No, it wasn't.

1051
01:32:14,852 --> 01:32:16,785
It was just a moment ago.

1052
01:32:19,857 --> 01:32:22,623
Did something happen since we talked last night ?

1053
01:32:25,862 --> 01:32:27,862
No.

1054
01:32:29,599 --> 01:32:31,866
Not that I can think of.

1055
01:32:36,773 --> 01:32:39,574
Well, this is barely the place to talk about it.

1056
01:32:39,576 --> 01:32:41,608
You gotta go back to your game.

1057
01:33:06,901 --> 01:33:10,903
This town is gonna give you the
biggest damn parade you ever seen !

1058
01:33:18,779 --> 01:33:22,413
Junuh was playin' a fierce fourth round.

1059
01:33:22,415 --> 01:33:26,251
And a wild thought began to percolate through the crowd.

1060
01:33:26,253 --> 01:33:27,752
Junuh could win.

1061
01:33:31,891 --> 01:33:33,891
<i>I think the driver, Bagger. Hey, give us a smile.</i>

1062
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:40,397
Well, you got water out there on the left side.
Why don't you put your spoon out there...

1063
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:42,699
with Jones and Hagen, play this thing smart ?

1064
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:46,503
<i>I'm gonna hug the left,
get there in two and close the door on these guys.</i>

1065
01:33:46,505 --> 01:33:51,541
Get ahold of yourself now.
We got four more holes to go. You settle down a little bit.

1066
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:56,413
I never been more settled. An eagle, and this thing is over.

1067
01:34:14,866 --> 01:34:17,499
Oh, that's 300 or more yards if it's an inch.

1068
01:34:23,407 --> 01:34:26,708
Looks like the longest drive of the day, Mr. Junuh.

1069
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:28,543
I'm gettin' there in two.

1070
01:34:31,381 --> 01:34:35,716
Two twenty-five into the wind, out of the bunker.

1071
01:34:35,718 --> 01:34:39,887
Geez. The lip's too high. So much for an eagle.

1072
01:34:39,889 --> 01:34:42,423
Says who ?

1073
01:34:42,425 --> 01:34:44,758
Where's that drivin' iron, Bagger ?

1074
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:50,464
Well, there's a time to hit that shot,
and there's a time to leave it in the bag.

1075
01:34:50,466 --> 01:34:53,334
Which one of them times you feel this is ?

1076
01:35:06,915 --> 01:35:08,915
Tell him. Tell him, Bagger.

1077
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:12,352
Tell him it's a mashie, so he can have one easy shot to--

1078
01:35:12,354 --> 01:35:17,756
That's amazing. The man's gonna go for
the green with that cleeky lookin' thing ?

1079
01:35:17,758 --> 01:35:20,359
He's got the guts of a Greek god.

1080
01:35:20,361 --> 01:35:22,728
I don't care if he's Apollo, son of Zeus.

1081
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:25,897
<i>That ball won't clear the water.</i>

1082
01:35:25,899 --> 01:35:29,067
I hope you're all payin' customers.

1083
01:36:07,639 --> 01:36:10,907
Junuh ! Junuh, don't-- Shh. Hush yourself, Hardy.

1084
01:36:10,909 --> 01:36:14,877
If first you don't succeed.

1085
01:36:39,636 --> 01:36:42,904
Which would make your spot...

1086
01:36:42,906 --> 01:36:45,573
right here, Junuh.

1087
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:49,910
Give it to him.

1088
01:37:18,673 --> 01:37:20,940
When Junuh dropped that ball,

1089
01:37:20,942 --> 01:37:24,877
it was as if every heart in Savannah dropped with it,

1090
01:37:26,247 --> 01:37:28,880
none landing harder than his own.

1091
01:39:24,124 --> 01:39:26,825
You gonna be wantin' a different club there, Junuh ?

1092
01:39:33,834 --> 01:39:36,234
<i>I can't do this. Well--</i>

1093
01:39:36,236 --> 01:39:39,905
Why don't you just loose your grip up a smidge ?

1094
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:42,707
<i>A man's grip on his club is-- That's not what I'm talkin' about.</i>

1095
01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:46,744
- I know. - No, you don't.

1096
01:39:46,746 --> 01:39:49,180
What I'm talkin' about is a game.

1097
01:39:49,182 --> 01:39:52,149
Game that can't be won. Only played.

1098
01:39:52,151 --> 01:39:54,151
You don't understand.

1099
01:39:54,153 --> 01:39:57,688
I don't need to understand.

1100
01:39:57,690 --> 01:40:01,925
Ain't a soul on this entire earth ain't got
a burden to carry he don't understand.

1101
01:40:01,927 --> 01:40:03,927
<i>You ain't alone in that.</i>

1102
01:40:03,929 --> 01:40:06,930
But you been carryin' this one long enough.

1103
01:40:06,932 --> 01:40:10,367
Time to go on. Lay it down.

1104
01:40:13,305 --> 01:40:15,205
I don't know how.

1105
01:40:17,242 --> 01:40:21,210
You got a choice. You can stop.

1106
01:40:21,212 --> 01:40:25,114
- Or you can start. - Start ?

1107
01:40:25,116 --> 01:40:26,949
<i>- Walkin'. - Where ?</i>

1108
01:40:26,951 --> 01:40:28,951
Right back to where you always been.

1109
01:40:28,953 --> 01:40:31,387
<i>And then stand there.</i>

1110
01:40:32,657 --> 01:40:35,924
Still. Real still.

1111
01:40:35,926 --> 01:40:38,961
- And remember. - It's too long ago.

1112
01:40:38,963 --> 01:40:42,363
Oh, no, sir. It was just a moment ago.

1113
01:40:46,436 --> 01:40:49,971
Time for you to come on out the shadows, Junuh.

1114
01:40:52,175 --> 01:40:54,308
Time for you to choose.

1115
01:40:59,682 --> 01:41:02,382
- I can't. - Yes, you can.

1116
01:41:02,384 --> 01:41:04,351
But you ain't alone.

1117
01:41:05,454 --> 01:41:07,354
I'm right here with ya.

1118
01:41:08,824 --> 01:41:10,991
I been here all along.

1119
01:41:18,032 --> 01:41:20,032
Now, play the game.

1120
01:41:20,034 --> 01:41:23,969
Your game. The one that only you was meant to play.

1121
01:41:23,971 --> 01:41:26,839
The one that was given to you when you come into this world.

1122
01:41:36,983 --> 01:41:38,983
You ready ?

1123
01:41:41,321 --> 01:41:43,288
Take your stance.

1124
01:41:48,995 --> 01:41:52,797
Strike that ball, Junuh.
Don't hold nothin' back. Give it everything.

1125
01:41:52,799 --> 01:41:54,466
Now's the time.

1126
01:41:54,468 --> 01:41:59,336
<i>Let yourself remember. Rememberyour swing.</i>

1127
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:05,843
That's right, Junuh. Settle yourself. Let's go.

1128
01:42:05,845 --> 01:42:07,778
Now is the time, Junuh.

1129
01:42:51,955 --> 01:42:53,854
Let's go, Hardy.

1130
01:42:59,262 --> 01:43:01,462
Hey, Bagger ? Yeah ?

1131
01:43:01,464 --> 01:43:03,564
You are one hell of a caddie.

1132
01:43:03,566 --> 01:43:08,169
Well, I do the best with what I got
to work with. We ain't done yet.

1133
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:28,988
By the 17th, Junuh got his swing back.

1134
01:43:31,859 --> 01:43:37,095
You have the right to call the game on account of darkness.

1135
01:43:37,097 --> 01:43:39,932
That crowd'll string us up by our thumbs if we don't finish.

1136
01:43:45,172 --> 01:43:49,608
All right ! Play will continue !

1137
01:44:08,161 --> 01:44:10,093
Oh !

1138
01:44:14,333 --> 01:44:16,900
This is when a man needs pals in the mermaids' union.

1139
01:45:11,287 --> 01:45:13,687
Cars ! Get your cars, boys !

1140
01:45:13,689 --> 01:45:18,458
I want every car on this property lined up with lights blazin' !

1141
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:21,094
I don't care if you're kitchen help or Savannah police.

1142
01:45:21,096 --> 01:45:24,298
If you got a car, get it in gear !

1143
01:45:41,316 --> 01:45:44,317
What's his mark ? It was out of bounds.

1144
01:45:44,319 --> 01:45:47,352
Does he have a shot ?

1145
01:45:47,354 --> 01:45:50,588
Then Hagen came back from the dead.

1146
01:45:57,464 --> 01:45:59,631
Can I get a smoke ?

1147
01:45:59,633 --> 01:46:02,667
I want you to tell Spec to hold the
flag in case I make it. He'll love that.

1148
01:46:02,669 --> 01:46:04,102
I want a three iron.

1149
01:46:08,407 --> 01:46:10,341
Get my shoes, will ya ?

1150
01:46:16,515 --> 01:46:18,515
Hey, what's goin' on ?

1151
01:46:18,517 --> 01:46:21,218
Hagen wants Spec to hold the flag for him in case he sinks it.

1152
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:23,087
I'm gonna miss playing Walter.

1153
01:47:01,759 --> 01:47:04,191
Don't hold nothin' back.

1154
01:47:22,711 --> 01:47:25,545
- The ball moved. - No.

1155
01:47:25,547 --> 01:47:28,281
It moved.

1156
01:47:29,718 --> 01:47:31,718
I have to call a stroke on myself.

1157
01:47:37,292 --> 01:47:39,426
No !

1158
01:47:39,428 --> 01:47:42,694
No. Don't do it. Please don't do it.

1159
01:47:42,696 --> 01:47:45,230
Only you and me seen it, and I won't tell a soul.

1160
01:47:45,232 --> 01:47:47,733
Cross my heart. Ain't nobody gonna know.

1161
01:47:49,537 --> 01:47:52,337
I will, Hardy.

1162
01:47:52,339 --> 01:47:54,173
And so will you.

1163
01:47:56,744 --> 01:47:59,744
You've got to tell him not to do it, Bagger !

1164
01:47:59,746 --> 01:48:01,746
It's just a stupid rule that don't mean nothin'.

1165
01:48:01,748 --> 01:48:04,682
That's a choice for Mr. Junuh, Hardy.

1166
01:48:07,353 --> 01:48:09,387
No one wanted the penalty assessed,

1167
01:48:09,389 --> 01:48:11,722
not even Jones and Hagen.

1168
01:48:11,724 --> 01:48:14,125
This was no way to win a match.

1169
01:48:14,127 --> 01:48:19,362
Maybe you're mistaken, Junuh.
Maybe it moved before you touched the impediment.

1170
01:48:19,364 --> 01:48:22,732
Might not have moved at all.
The light plays funny tricks this time of day.

1171
01:48:22,734 --> 01:48:27,737
"A ball is deemed to have moved if it leaves
its original position in the least degree,

1172
01:48:27,739 --> 01:48:32,375
but not if it merely oscillates and
comes to rest in its original position."

1173
01:48:35,214 --> 01:48:37,746
Is she different ?

1174
01:48:37,748 --> 01:48:41,350
<i>Can you be certain ? Sometimes a ball will shudder...</i>

1175
01:48:41,352 --> 01:48:43,752
<i>and then settle back again, Junuh.</i>

1176
01:48:47,592 --> 01:48:51,427
The ball was here, and it rolled to here.

1177
01:49:01,171 --> 01:49:03,771
<i>Hit it quick, old boy, before you have time to think about it.</i>

1178
01:49:30,733 --> 01:49:32,733
You're leaving.

1179
01:49:32,735 --> 01:49:35,935
Yes, sir. Yes, I am.

1180
01:49:35,937 --> 01:49:38,404
I need you.

1181
01:49:38,406 --> 01:49:42,408
No. No, you don't.

1182
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:44,343
Not no more.

1183
01:49:45,847 --> 01:49:50,316
<i>There is a small matter. Round about five dollars.</i>

1184
01:49:50,318 --> 01:49:53,753
It was guaranteed.

1185
01:49:53,755 --> 01:49:57,756
- Yes, it was. - 'Spect you won't be needin' these shoes back,

1186
01:49:57,758 --> 01:50:01,760
now that I done broke 'em into my foot and all, you know.

1187
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:10,302
Thank you, sir.

1188
01:50:19,445 --> 01:50:21,412
This man is yours, Hardy.

1189
01:50:22,515 --> 01:50:24,515
Take him on in.

1190
01:50:24,517 --> 01:50:29,587
Y-You want me... to take over for you ?

1191
01:50:31,224 --> 01:50:34,958
You leavin' me ? Oh, only for a little while.

1192
01:50:36,461 --> 01:50:39,462
You pick up Mr. Junuh bag.

1193
01:50:39,464 --> 01:50:41,731
You tote it real straight, now, you hear ?

1194
01:50:41,733 --> 01:50:44,534
But what if something comes up...

1195
01:50:44,536 --> 01:50:46,736
and I don't know what to do ?

1196
01:50:46,738 --> 01:50:49,939
I got a feeling you'll figure it out.

1197
01:50:51,642 --> 01:50:53,742
But I'll be seein' ya.

1198
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:08,590
Whoa, wait a minute. What's going on here ?

1199
01:51:08,592 --> 01:51:10,725
You can't leave him now. He needs you, Bagger.

1200
01:51:10,727 --> 01:51:13,728
You're the only chance he's got. You have to stay.

1201
01:51:13,730 --> 01:51:16,731
You walk out of here like this,
you'll never caddie in Georgia again,

1202
01:51:16,733 --> 01:51:18,966
I'll personally see to it ! Ya hear ?

1203
01:51:37,452 --> 01:51:39,719
Where's Junuh lie ?

1204
01:51:39,721 --> 01:51:42,289
Two with a penalty. Could be hittin' three.

1205
01:51:50,731 --> 01:51:53,699
Man. I can't hit it any better than that.

1206
01:52:09,916 --> 01:52:13,718
Yes, sir.

1207
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:17,722
Judging from the sound,
I think I just knocked your ball in the cup.

1208
01:52:29,735 --> 01:52:31,702
Interesting match.

1209
01:52:33,372 --> 01:52:35,105
I always thought so.

1210
01:52:38,577 --> 01:52:42,079
<i>All right, everybody. Comin' through. Out of the way.</i>

1211
01:52:48,119 --> 01:52:52,121
Hagen and Jones both lay two, a shot ahead of Junuh.

1212
01:52:52,123 --> 01:52:55,758
If either of them sank their putts, Junuh would lose.

1213
01:52:57,795 --> 01:53:00,029
What do you think, Hardy ?

1214
01:53:01,733 --> 01:53:05,633
Well, the night air has gotten colder.

1215
01:53:05,635 --> 01:53:10,071
My guess is it's put a layer of dew on the warmer grass,

1216
01:53:10,073 --> 01:53:13,108
which is gonna slow your ball down.

1217
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:22,517
Why don't you go on over and stand with your father ?

1218
01:53:22,519 --> 01:53:24,818
<i>Are you sure ? Go ahead.</i>

1219
01:53:24,820 --> 01:53:26,820
Go on.

1220
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:40,834
That is one tough shot.

1221
01:53:40,836 --> 01:53:43,404
Make it.

1222
01:54:05,492 --> 01:54:07,993
Yeah !

1223
01:56:56,988 --> 01:56:59,322
Rannulph Junuh from Savannah, Georgia...

1224
01:56:59,324 --> 01:57:03,192
tied Mr. Bobby Jones and Mr. Walter Hagen...

1225
01:57:03,194 --> 01:57:06,696
in the greatest golf match the world has ever seen !

1226
01:57:35,791 --> 01:57:37,791
That was the last match in competition...

1227
01:57:37,793 --> 01:57:40,060
Bobby Jones ever played.

1228
01:57:41,897 --> 01:57:46,133
From that time on,
Walter Hagen played only exhibition matches.

1229
01:57:57,812 --> 01:58:02,148
As for Captain Rannulph Junuh and Adele Invergordon,

1230
01:58:03,652 --> 01:58:05,385
they did have that dance.

1231
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:26,104
And me ?

1232
01:58:26,106 --> 01:58:29,741
Well, it seems like yesterday I used to see old guys like me,

1233
01:58:29,743 --> 01:58:34,011
wonder why they still bothered with this crazy game.

1234
01:58:45,191 --> 01:58:47,358
But it doesn't matter.

1235
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:52,195
As Bagger once said,
it's a game that can't be won, only played.

1236
01:58:52,197 --> 01:58:55,732
So, I play. I play on.

1237
01:58:55,734 --> 01:58:59,369
I play for the moments yet to come,

1238
01:58:59,371 --> 01:59:02,172
lookin' for my place in the field.

1239
01:59:03,305 --> 02:00:03,927
