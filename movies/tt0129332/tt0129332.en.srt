00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:50,378
For heroism above and
beyond the call of duty...

3
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:54,848
for successfully infiltrating
the enemy's ranks...

4
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,221
and securing victory
independently...

5
00:00:58,222 --> 00:01:00,954
with cunning and honor...

6
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:05,793
Captain John Boyd.

7
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:13,970
Amen.

8
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,168
Amen.

9
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,454
You're no hero, Boyd.

10
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:13,597
I want you as far from
my company as possible.

11
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,057
I'm sending you to California...

12
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:18,399
Fort Spencer.

13
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:21,201
Please, gentlemen, quickly.

14
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:24,964
I want all of that in the
largest office on the left.

15
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:28,777
Careful. Don't scratch it.

16
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:32,742
Come, come, come,
come, come, please.

17
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:45,775
Aah! Lieutenant Boyd!

18
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:48,577
Lieutenant Boyd!

19
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:50,612
Aaah!

20
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:52,181
Lieutenant Boyd!

21
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:53,844
Lieutenant Boy...!

22
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:08,931
Boyd!

23
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:12,100
Boyd!

24
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:14,803
Help me!

25
00:06:14,804 --> 00:06:16,939
Help me, Boyd!

26
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,107
Boyd!

27
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:21,271
Captain John Boyd.

28
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:25,173
War hero, huh?

29
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:29,051
So, the brass decided
to reward you...

30
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:33,889
with a little appointment
to the California sun?

31
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:40,124
Have a walnut, Boyd.

32
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:43,757
Martha brought them in
fresh from San Miguel.

33
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:47,669
This is my hobby...

34
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,766
reading in the
original languages...

35
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:54,772
Well, you know,
languages in general.

36
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:57,009
It's, uh...

37
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:00,282
It's tedious, I know...

38
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:04,710
but, then, this place
thrives on tedium.

39
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:11,186
So, uh...

40
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:17,799
you have a hobby, Boyd?

41
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:20,528
Swimming.

42
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:23,798
Swimming.

43
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:26,808
I hope you don't mind hard water.

44
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:28,369
So...

45
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:31,641
Fort Spencer.

46
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:35,884
Uh, the Spanish built
this place as a mission.

47
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:37,386
We inherited her.

48
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:38,887
Now we're a way station...

49
00:07:38,888 --> 00:07:41,313
for western travelers on their
way through the Nevadas.

50
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,225
We don't get much traffic...

51
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:44,760
through these parts
in the winter...

52
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:46,795
so we maintain only a
skeleton company...

53
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:49,398
that consists of Private Toffler...

54
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,867
who's our personal
emissary from the Lord...

55
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:54,736
Major Knox, who never met a
bottle he didn't like...

56
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:57,940
Private Reich... he's our soldier.

57
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:00,576
Aaah!

58
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:02,239
I'd steer clear of him.

59
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:04,780
And Martha you've met.

60
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:07,149
Bet you didn't get
a word out of her.

61
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,051
And George, her brother.

62
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:11,820
They're both locals... sort
of came with the place.

63
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:14,122
Ha! Ha! Ha!

64
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:17,356
And then there's Private Cleaves.

65
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:21,287
The overmedicated Private Cleaves.

66
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:23,599
And you and I make eight.

67
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,334
Cleaves cooks.

68
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:28,036
Knox used to be a veterinarian,
so he plays doctor.

69
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:30,268
My advice to you is don't get sick.

70
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,409
I'd tell you don't eat, but
then most of us have to.

71
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,711
So, with your promotion...

72
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:37,773
you'd be number three in command.

73
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:43,978
Toffler's prayer.

74
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:53,929
O heavenly Father, bless
this to our use, and...

75
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,531
- Amen.
- Amen.

76
00:08:56,532 --> 00:09:00,168
So, did anyone do anything today?

77
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:11,013
We have a great sense
of camaraderie...

78
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:13,211
here at Fort Spencer.

79
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:47,281
How did you get behind
the enemy line?

80
00:09:47,884 --> 00:09:50,309
I froze. I was scared.

81
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:52,487
Scared?

82
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:57,926
You froze while the rest of
your unit fought and died?

83
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:04,026
What did you do then?

84
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:07,996
I played dead.

85
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:12,307
But you made it behind enemy lines.

86
00:10:14,477 --> 00:10:16,139
I was buried...

87
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:21,650
with my commanding officer's...

88
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:24,042
half-shot-off head in my face...

89
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:28,123
his blood running down my throat.

90
00:10:31,794 --> 00:10:34,185
So, how did you take
the command post?

91
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,693
Something...

92
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:42,662
something... had changed.

93
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:18,173
We're going to promote you, Boyd.
We could shoot you...

94
00:11:18,174 --> 00:11:20,609
but as you single-handedly
captured the enemy command...

95
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,577
it might set a bad precedent.

96
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:26,681
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

97
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:29,284
Last-minute addition to the post.

98
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:31,312
All right, Cleaves. Let's hear it.

99
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:35,323
Salt, meat, beans...

100
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:37,459
coffee, oil...

101
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,528
bacon, flour.

102
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:43,331
All right. I want you
back in three days.

103
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:44,800
No loco weed...

104
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:46,935
no peyote...

105
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:48,103
no women.

106
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:49,938
No women.

107
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:52,136
Martha, keep him out of trouble.

108
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:55,339
OK. Nice trip.

109
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,347
All right, come on.

110
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:01,010
Ya!

111
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:03,552
I'm going to get up...

112
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:06,221
some salt, meat, beans...

113
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:08,123
Ioco weed, and women.

114
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:10,692
- No women.
- I can't get a woman?

115
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:12,958
Wish you were along for the ride?

116
00:12:14,597 --> 00:12:16,157
Unh!

117
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:26,436
What did you get the medal for?

118
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:31,870
Cowardice.

119
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:38,119
Uh... Knox has got some
excellent bourbon.

120
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,721
It's really fine stuff.

121
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:43,992
And he just passed
out about... a minute ago.

122
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:47,162
So, uh... wondering
if you'd like to...

123
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,730
He won't mind?

124
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,860
Probably.

125
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,394
To escape...

126
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,737
in one form or another.

127
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:00,735
Toffler!

128
00:13:01,277 --> 00:13:03,076
Toffler!

129
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:07,349
- Uh-huh?
- What are you doing?

130
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,742
Oh, um, it's a religious hymn.

131
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:13,717
I'm writing a religious hymn.

132
00:13:14,423 --> 00:13:16,024
Ah.

133
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:19,258
Well, could you find some
inspiration somewhere else?

134
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:22,563
And could you get us some ice?

135
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:36,471
Funny thing.

136
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:39,447
We escape the world...

137
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:41,349
we come here...

138
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,150
and then we turn right around
and try to escape this place.

139
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:50,759
Frightening thing about
escape, though...

140
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,821
The chance you might end
up someplace worse.

141
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,828
Hmm.

142
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:06,405
Reich, go that way.

143
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:07,966
- Colonel.
- Yeah?

144
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:12,635
Who are you?

145
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,041
Reich! Reich!

146
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,651
- He's alive.
- Jesus Christ.

147
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:20,883
Just barely. Let's get him inside.

148
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:23,389
Uh, we need hot water.

149
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,357
Uh, George, Toffler, hot water!

150
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:27,326
Lots and lots of hot water!

151
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,729
Reich, try to rouse Knox.
Let's get these rags off.

152
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,462
Let's see if we can
get his blood moving.

153
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:38,197
Toffler, more water!

154
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,640
I think he'll live.

155
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,837
Easy, easy, easy.

156
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:03,119
Well, he's warm.

157
00:15:03,497 --> 00:15:06,365
Frostbite didn't seem
to do much damage.

158
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:10,066
I guess the only thing we
can do is let him rest.

159
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:13,239
And, uh... pray.

160
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,574
Toffler, your duty.

161
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:17,736
Good work.

162
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:32,691
Each one of these is about
one-point-five miles.

163
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:35,356
Takes about three days
actually, because...

164
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:38,697
Mm-hmm.

165
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:41,500
- Mm-hmm!
- Yes? He's up.

166
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:43,061
Excellent.

167
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:45,502
He's up. Let's go.

168
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,208
Major... Major Knox?

169
00:15:50,744 --> 00:15:52,304
Major Knox?

170
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:58,017
Major Knox? Doc? Doc?

171
00:15:58,018 --> 00:15:59,752
- Hmm?
- Doc? Doc?

172
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:02,054
Doc? Doc?

173
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:03,589
Aah!

174
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,124
Doc, he's awake.

175
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,525
What? Who?

176
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:08,861
The man who showed up last night.

177
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:10,262
He's going to tell us what...

178
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:12,197
He's going to tell
us what happened.

179
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:13,365
Doc?

180
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:18,597
Where, uh...

181
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:22,868
Where am I?

182
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:25,444
Fort Spencer, California.

183
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:27,938
Western Sierra Nevadas.

184
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:37,949
Excuse me.

185
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:40,420
I'm sorry.

186
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:44,152
My name is Colqhoun.

187
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,790
F.W. Colqhoun, servant of God.

188
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:53,799
How are you feeling, Mr. Colqhoun?

189
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,665
Not bad, considering.

190
00:16:57,877 --> 00:16:59,645
I probably look like death.

191
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:02,674
Not bad... considering.

192
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,774
How long were you out there?

193
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:08,418
Three months.

194
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:10,856
Withoutfood?

195
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:12,918
Yes.

196
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:15,594
Toffler, help him.

197
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:17,155
Good Lord.

198
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:19,824
Good Lord.

199
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:22,865
You should have seen
me three months ago.

200
00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:27,606
I was thirty pounds heavier.

201
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:31,602
I'm sorry, but you did say
no food for three months.

202
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,542
I said...

203
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:38,984
I said no food. I didn't say
there was nothing to eat.

204
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:40,647
Do you understand?

205
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:43,386
Do you understand?

206
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:47,593
I suppose I owe you
gentlemen a story.

207
00:17:47,594 --> 00:17:49,985
Only if you feel up to it.

208
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:52,924
Yes.

209
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:06,442
We left in April.

210
00:18:07,947 --> 00:18:09,712
Six of us in all.

211
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:15,511
Mr. MacCready and his
wife from Ireland.

212
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:19,591
Mr. Janus from
Virginia, I believe...

213
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:22,327
with his servant, Jones.

214
00:18:22,328 --> 00:18:24,855
Myself... I'm from Scotland.

215
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:28,991
And our guide...

216
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:35,374
a military man, coincidentally.
Colonel Ives.

217
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,073
I don't think I know him.

218
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:40,239
The better for you.

219
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:42,912
A detestable man...

220
00:18:44,284 --> 00:18:46,379
and a most disastrous guide.

221
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:50,312
He professed to know...

222
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:54,226
a new, shorter route
through the Nevadas.

223
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:57,560
Quite a route that was.

224
00:18:57,997 --> 00:19:00,524
Longer than the known one...

225
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:03,035
and impossible to travel.

226
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:04,369
Get up there! Get on!

227
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,534
We worked... very, very hard.

228
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:12,478
By the time of the first snowfall we were
still a hundred miles from this place.

229
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:14,369
That was November.

230
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:17,873
Proceeding in the snow was futile.

231
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:21,016
We took shelter in a cave.

232
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:24,885
We decided to wait until
the storm had passed.

233
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,822
But the storm did not pass.

234
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:32,225
The trail soon became impassable...

235
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:36,664
and we had run out of food.

236
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:41,005
We ate the oxen...

237
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:44,474
all the horses...

238
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:48,705
even my own dog.

239
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:52,646
And that lasted us about a month.

240
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:57,754
After that, we turned
to our belts...

241
00:19:58,358 --> 00:20:00,055
shoes...

242
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,594
any roots we could dig up...

243
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:05,725
but you know there's no
real nourishment in those.

244
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:10,334
We remained famished.

245
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:14,273
The day that Jones died...

246
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:16,938
I was out collecting wood.

247
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:20,979
He had expired from malnourishment.

248
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:24,483
And when I returned...

249
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,647
the others were cooking
his legs for dinner.

250
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,450
Would I have stopped
it had I been there?

251
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:41,332
I don't know.

252
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:45,036
But I must say...

253
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:49,367
when I stepped inside that cave...

254
00:20:52,745 --> 00:20:56,581
the smell of meat cooking...

255
00:21:01,454 --> 00:21:03,014
I thanked the Lord.

256
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:07,092
I thanked the Lord.

257
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:15,799
And then things got out of hand.

258
00:21:17,503 --> 00:21:19,302
I ate sparingly.

259
00:21:21,274 --> 00:21:23,475
Others did not.

260
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:27,045
The meat did not last us a week...

261
00:21:27,046 --> 00:21:28,547
and we were soon hungry again.

262
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:30,813
Only this time, our
hunger was different.

263
00:21:32,485 --> 00:21:34,045
More...

264
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:36,581
severe...

265
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:39,384
savage.

266
00:21:40,894 --> 00:21:44,525
And Colonel Ives, particularly,
could not be satisfied.

267
00:21:48,768 --> 00:21:51,804
Janus was the first to be killed.

268
00:21:54,974 --> 00:21:56,671
Then Mr. MacCready.

269
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,006
That left Colonel Ives...

270
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:02,480
MacCready's wife, and I alone...

271
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:05,611
and I knew in that company
that my days were numbered.

272
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:12,853
I'm ashamed to say that I acted
in a most cowardly manner.

273
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:16,561
It would have been
nobler, I know...

274
00:22:16,562 --> 00:22:20,227
to have stayed and protected
Mrs. MacCready from Ives, but...

275
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:23,194
I was weak.

276
00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:28,733
I fled.

277
00:22:31,677 --> 00:22:35,547
It was nothing less than pure
providence that I arrived here.

278
00:22:35,548 --> 00:22:37,382
Mrs. MacCready...

279
00:22:37,383 --> 00:22:38,950
is she still there?

280
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:41,019
And Colonel Ives, as far as I know.

281
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,588
Let's pack up. We've
got to go up there.

282
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:45,089
We've got to go. It's our job.

283
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,822
- Why go?
- It's our job!

284
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:51,396
Here's you.

285
00:22:51,397 --> 00:22:52,564
Here's Toffler.

286
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:54,766
Reich has got his own rifle.

287
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,468
I've got my pistol.

288
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:59,270
I think the cave's three or
four days' march from here.

289
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:00,705
What is it, George?

290
00:23:00,706 --> 00:23:02,505
What?

291
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,344
Weendigo.

292
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:07,846
Weendigo.

293
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:09,814
Weendigo.

294
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:18,345
It's an old Indian
myth from the north.

295
00:23:23,162 --> 00:23:26,631
A man eats another's flesh.

296
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:28,499
It's usually an enemy.

297
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:35,106
And he, um, takes...

298
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:36,574
no, steals...

299
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:40,172
his strength, essence, his spirit.

300
00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:48,152
And his hunger becomes craven...

301
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:50,384
insatiable.

302
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:57,020
And the more he eats,
the more he wants to.

303
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:02,100
The more he eats, the
stronger he becomes.

304
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:05,766
George, people don't
still do that, do they?

305
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:18,574
White man eats the body of
Jesus Christ every Sunday.

306
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:25,423
Time!

307
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:29,260
Major Knox, we're leaving now. You're
going to be in charge until I return.

308
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:33,765
Here's the key to the arsenal. Martha
and Cleaves will be back in a few days.

309
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:40,171
Too much bourbon in his bourbon.

310
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:41,732
Will he be all right?

311
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:44,605
Yeah, he'll be fine.

312
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,314
Mr. Colqhoun...

313
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:51,876
uh... getting dressed?

314
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:53,918
I'm coming with you.

315
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,956
I must come with you. You don't stand
a chance of finding her without me.

316
00:24:57,957 --> 00:25:01,125
Well, you're right. You're a
good man. Thank you.

317
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:10,768
- Colonel Hart.
- Huh?

318
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,500
- Colonel Hart.
- What?

319
00:25:13,606 --> 00:25:16,474
Oh, thank you, thank you.

320
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,274
I need that.

321
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:23,581
- Colonel Hart.
- Huh?

322
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:25,483
Where's my other glasses?

323
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,018
Holy Jesus.

324
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:28,579
Sorry.

325
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:52,810
O Lord

326
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:56,648
What great reward

327
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:58,549
Can you

328
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,819
Afford

329
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,520
A loy... a loyal ser-servant

330
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:15,366
Servant... servant...
lervant... dervant...

331
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,961
Fervent.

332
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:30,014
Who entrusts in you

333
00:26:30,015 --> 00:26:34,452
Your faith so fervent

334
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:36,184
Fervent.

335
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:41,588
Wow, it's brilliant out here.

336
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:48,062
Watch out there.

337
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:51,358
Ow, drat!

338
00:27:24,703 --> 00:27:26,370
Bourbon break.

339
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:28,261
Rest stop.

340
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,435
Want some?

341
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:33,611
Colqhoun?

342
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:35,502
Reich?

343
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:43,276
Mr. Colqhoun.

344
00:27:44,757 --> 00:27:48,991
You... you said that
when you ate the man...

345
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:53,127
Do... do you mind if I ask?

346
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:57,401
You said that afterwards
your hunger was different...

347
00:27:57,402 --> 00:27:59,337
that you felt wanton.

348
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:01,296
Yes.

349
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:05,374
Did you feel at all
physically changed?

350
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:08,012
Stronger?

351
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:11,814
I seem to remember
something like that.

352
00:28:13,185 --> 00:28:14,745
A certain...

353
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:17,650
virility.

354
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:19,583
Why do you ask?

355
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:21,459
Hey!

356
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,461
Look, look, look! Look! Hey!

357
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:24,695
It's a bone!

358
00:28:24,696 --> 00:28:26,364
It's a bone.

359
00:28:26,365 --> 00:28:28,596
Whoa!

360
00:28:31,937 --> 00:28:33,929
No, no, no!

361
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:51,615
He's all right!

362
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:55,459
Are you? You all right?

363
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,259
Mm-hmm.

364
00:29:09,174 --> 00:29:12,407
I would very much appreciate
some of that bourbon now.

365
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:20,218
Bourbon now!

366
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:22,109
Boyd!

367
00:29:25,624 --> 00:29:27,859
Would you administer
some of this to Toffler?

368
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,420
Thank you.

369
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:45,867
War hero, afraid of
the sight of blood?

370
00:29:54,216 --> 00:29:55,913
What? What? What?

371
00:29:57,586 --> 00:29:59,387
What is it? What is it?

372
00:29:59,388 --> 00:30:01,856
What is it? What is it?

373
00:30:01,857 --> 00:30:03,591
Wake up! Wake up!

374
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:05,960
Wake up!

375
00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:08,029
What's the matter?

376
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,897
Wake up, wake up.

377
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,090
Are you all right? You all right?

378
00:30:13,903 --> 00:30:15,904
He was licking me.

379
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:19,274
- What?
- He was... he was licking me.

380
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,506
No.

381
00:30:22,311 --> 00:30:24,804
He was licking me!

382
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:28,179
- Reich!
- Yes! Yes!

383
00:30:28,817 --> 00:30:32,020
Reich, rebandage Toffler's wounds.

384
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:33,187
Mr. Colqhoun?

385
00:30:33,188 --> 00:30:35,456
- Yes?
- You come outside.

386
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:37,191
Outside! You sleep outside!

387
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:39,193
Boyd, you, too.

388
00:30:39,194 --> 00:30:41,892
- Stay there.
- Sick man outside!

389
00:30:43,265 --> 00:30:45,767
- Colonel Hart, I can explain.
- Explain!

390
00:30:45,768 --> 00:30:47,201
Um...

391
00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:49,604
It's not what you think.

392
00:30:49,605 --> 00:30:53,107
I... I was having a nightmare.

393
00:30:53,108 --> 00:30:55,143
I was having a nightmare.

394
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,946
That young man screamed,
I awoke, I was on top of him...

395
00:30:57,947 --> 00:31:00,248
my lips were on his wound.

396
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:03,447
Oh, Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

397
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:06,888
Please, restrain me.
Restrain me, Colonel Hart.

398
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:10,758
I can't be trusted.
Please. I insist.

399
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,319
I insist.

400
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,902
Mr. Colqhoun.

401
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:37,511
Weendigo.

402
00:32:08,951 --> 00:32:11,046
I take it that's the cave.

403
00:32:12,154 --> 00:32:13,714
- Yeah.
- That's it.

404
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:15,917
All right.

405
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,787
George, come on.

406
00:32:31,907 --> 00:32:33,875
No, please!

407
00:32:33,876 --> 00:32:35,436
No, please!

408
00:32:38,914 --> 00:32:40,081
No!

409
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:41,416
No, please!

410
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,284
No, please!

411
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:44,452
Flank on the left.

412
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:46,421
No, please! No, no!

413
00:32:52,194 --> 00:32:53,754
Please!

414
00:32:54,596 --> 00:32:57,198
Please, I don't want to go! Please!

415
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:59,260
Boyd.

416
00:33:07,976 --> 00:33:09,866
They'll kill me!

417
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,284
Please.

418
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,719
Please.

419
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,886
Mrs. MacCready!

420
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:22,256
Please, please.
They're going to kill me.

421
00:33:22,257 --> 00:33:24,147
Shut up!

422
00:33:25,994 --> 00:33:27,161
Colonel Ives!

423
00:33:35,804 --> 00:33:37,171
Reich!

424
00:33:37,172 --> 00:33:38,773
Reich, break out the lantern.

425
00:33:38,774 --> 00:33:42,575
George, Toffler, stand
guard where you are.

426
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:44,838
Here.

427
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:48,182
You're going to have
to go in with Reich.

428
00:33:48,183 --> 00:33:50,418
I'm sorry, but I need
an officer in there.

429
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:51,979
Here.

430
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:03,058
Just stay the hell out
of my way, all right?

431
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:25,517
She's not here, we go
back, right, Colonel?

432
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,080
We go back?

433
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:33,259
We go all the way back.

434
00:35:24,379 --> 00:35:25,880
Well, well.

435
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:28,181
Blood.

436
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:41,284
Boyd.

437
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,995
What are you doing?

438
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:50,498
Oh, I'm sorry.

439
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:54,804
After you, Captain.

440
00:36:07,055 --> 00:36:08,256
Captain.

441
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:09,957
Sorry.

442
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:11,848
Thank you.

443
00:36:36,785 --> 00:36:38,345
Mr. Colqhoun!

444
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:45,192
Mr. Colqhoun!

445
00:36:49,398 --> 00:36:50,765
He's spooked.

446
00:36:50,766 --> 00:36:52,793
He's spooking me.

447
00:36:57,906 --> 00:36:59,073
Reich!

448
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:02,944
- Boyd!
- Reich?

449
00:37:02,945 --> 00:37:05,006
Reich, the colonel's calling us.

450
00:37:22,464 --> 00:37:24,354
Reich!

451
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,600
Jesus!

452
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:37,712
Oh, God.

453
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,104
One, two, three, four, five.

454
00:37:46,052 --> 00:37:48,253
How many did he say was
in the party? Six, right?

455
00:37:48,254 --> 00:37:50,451
Why?

456
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,621
Who's this?

457
00:37:56,062 --> 00:37:57,690
Ives. Oh, Jesus.

458
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,860
It's a trap!

459
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:12,410
Boyd!

460
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:22,647
He killed everyone.

461
00:38:23,856 --> 00:38:25,848
Colqhoun killed everyone!

462
00:38:27,793 --> 00:38:29,820
Colonel Hart!

463
00:38:33,366 --> 00:38:35,427
Kill him!

464
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:46,275
Reich!

465
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:16,408
Ungh!

466
00:39:16,409 --> 00:39:18,071
Ahh!

467
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:54,441
That's so annoying!

468
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:09,787
Run!

469
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:14,833
Run, run, run.

470
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:16,234
Run. Run!

471
00:40:16,235 --> 00:40:17,902
Colonel Hart!

472
00:40:17,903 --> 00:40:19,571
Col...

473
00:40:19,572 --> 00:40:21,462
Oh, Jesus Christ.

474
00:40:25,411 --> 00:40:26,578
Oh, God.

475
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:28,179
He got George.

476
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,315
- Sir.
- Toffler.

477
00:40:30,316 --> 00:40:31,483
Where's Toffler?

478
00:40:31,484 --> 00:40:33,685
Toffler!

479
00:40:36,922 --> 00:40:38,789
There he is. Let's go, come on.

480
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:42,093
Go. Get him.

481
00:40:42,094 --> 00:40:44,329
- Boyd!
- Reich!

482
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,027
You can't help him!

483
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:49,167
He's dead, soldier! Now let's move!

484
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:51,126
Boyd!

485
00:41:22,902 --> 00:41:24,462
Shh!

486
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,955
Die!

487
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:12,943
Ugh!

488
00:42:22,394 --> 00:42:23,762
You loaded?

489
00:42:23,763 --> 00:42:25,755
Of course.

490
00:42:26,132 --> 00:42:27,692
Let's go kill that bastard.

491
00:42:56,862 --> 00:42:58,596
Come on, move!

492
00:42:58,597 --> 00:43:00,555
Move!

493
00:43:17,249 --> 00:43:19,446
Reich. Reich.

494
00:43:20,352 --> 00:43:22,220
I'm going to go back.

495
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:23,781
I'm going to go back.

496
00:43:24,824 --> 00:43:26,384
Find him.

497
00:44:02,761 --> 00:44:04,651
Jesus Christ.

498
00:44:12,271 --> 00:44:14,639
Oh!

499
00:44:29,488 --> 00:44:31,116
Come here.

500
00:44:40,332 --> 00:44:41,994
Get away from me.

501
00:44:43,235 --> 00:44:45,227
Get away from me!

502
00:45:05,024 --> 00:45:07,756
Whoa!

503
00:46:58,036 --> 00:47:00,063
Ohh!

504
00:50:03,388 --> 00:50:04,554
You cold, Reich?

505
00:50:04,555 --> 00:50:06,990
Mind if I take your coat?

506
00:50:06,991 --> 00:50:08,983
I'm freezing.

507
00:50:24,442 --> 00:50:26,332
Nice.

508
00:50:27,912 --> 00:50:29,079
Oh.

509
00:50:44,963 --> 00:50:47,024
What do you think, Major?

510
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:51,657
Should we stay here?

511
00:50:54,439 --> 00:50:56,830
Or t-take the hill?

512
00:51:00,411 --> 00:51:02,904
I need you to tell me what to do.

513
00:51:07,385 --> 00:51:09,218
I need...

514
00:51:09,821 --> 00:51:12,246
I need you to tell me what to do.

515
00:51:16,227 --> 00:51:17,889
Tell me what to do.

516
00:51:18,396 --> 00:51:20,163
Oh, God.

517
00:51:22,066 --> 00:51:23,626
Oh.

518
00:51:43,921 --> 00:51:47,424
God damn you. God damn
you, you're dead.

519
00:51:47,425 --> 00:51:48,925
You're dead.

520
00:51:48,926 --> 00:51:50,816
You're safe now.

521
00:51:51,662 --> 00:51:53,256
You're safe now.

522
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:55,477
Boyd?

523
00:53:56,086 --> 00:53:58,681
Martha, Knox, it's Boyd!

524
00:54:06,363 --> 00:54:09,288
All right now, hold on there.

525
00:54:56,646 --> 00:54:58,748
Martha, I need to talk to you.

526
00:54:58,749 --> 00:55:01,583
I need to... Weendigo.

527
00:55:01,952 --> 00:55:03,719
I need to know how to stop it.

528
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,348
I need you to help me.

529
00:55:09,025 --> 00:55:10,860
I'm sorry about your brother...

530
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:12,361
but I did...

531
00:55:12,362 --> 00:55:14,196
I did not kill him.

532
00:55:14,197 --> 00:55:15,464
I did not kill him.

533
00:55:15,465 --> 00:55:17,867
Martha, how do you st...

534
00:55:17,868 --> 00:55:19,034
How do you stop it?

535
00:55:19,035 --> 00:55:20,766
You don't!

536
00:55:21,872 --> 00:55:25,708
You ever give yourself?

537
00:55:25,709 --> 00:55:27,376
Weendigo eats.

538
00:55:27,377 --> 00:55:30,312
Must eat more, more...
never enough.

539
00:55:30,313 --> 00:55:32,882
He... he takes!

540
00:55:32,883 --> 00:55:35,308
Never, never gives.

541
00:55:36,787 --> 00:55:38,387
You stop weendigo...

542
00:55:38,388 --> 00:55:40,779
you give yourself.

543
00:55:41,725 --> 00:55:43,786
You must die.

544
00:55:46,396 --> 00:55:47,897
There's no sign of anyone.

545
00:55:47,898 --> 00:55:49,899
No sign of a sign of anyone...

546
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,903
not Colonel Hart's rescue
party, not the original party.

547
00:55:53,904 --> 00:55:56,405
- You found the cave?
- There's nothing in there!

548
00:55:56,406 --> 00:55:58,407
There's nothing inside.

549
00:55:58,408 --> 00:56:00,042
There's no blood tracks...

550
00:56:00,043 --> 00:56:02,035
no rope, no bodies.

551
00:56:02,612 --> 00:56:03,779
You don't believe me, sir?

552
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,016
We have four missing soldiers,
Captain, and no bodies.

553
00:56:07,017 --> 00:56:10,252
We need a supportable explanation.

554
00:56:10,253 --> 00:56:12,354
Now, your story, this...

555
00:56:12,355 --> 00:56:13,856
windagee...

556
00:56:13,857 --> 00:56:15,357
is the stuff of campfires.

557
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:17,026
Would you stop squirming, Lindus?

558
00:56:17,027 --> 00:56:19,486
I know I mispronounced it.
I'm making a point.

559
00:56:20,831 --> 00:56:24,600
My point is, Captain, we
need facts, not myths.

560
00:56:24,601 --> 00:56:26,202
I told you the facts, sir.

561
00:56:26,203 --> 00:56:29,038
Boyd, if you altered
your story now...

562
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:32,041
it wouldn't be perceived
as retracting a lie...

563
00:56:32,042 --> 00:56:37,446
only... clarifying, um,
a muddled recollection.

564
00:56:37,447 --> 00:56:39,448
The day that we spoke to you...

565
00:56:39,449 --> 00:56:41,517
you were out of your
head with fever.

566
00:56:41,518 --> 00:56:43,586
I was coherent then, I'm
coherent now, sir...

567
00:56:43,587 --> 00:56:44,887
and I distinctly remember...

568
00:56:44,888 --> 00:56:49,080
Perhaps up there in the wilderness
you got separated from your company.

569
00:56:49,426 --> 00:56:52,194
That's why I'm giving you
this second opportunity.

570
00:56:52,195 --> 00:56:54,620
I advise that...

571
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:58,328
you change your story, Boyd.

572
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:15,484
Who's that?

573
00:57:15,485 --> 00:57:16,652
New colonel.

574
00:57:16,653 --> 00:57:18,387
A pleasure to meet you, sir.

575
00:57:18,388 --> 00:57:20,255
Why don't we go inside?

576
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:29,562
- Yes?
- The colonel's here.

577
00:57:29,563 --> 00:57:30,729
Thank you, Lindus.

578
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,132
We've brought in an interim
commanding officer...

579
00:57:33,133 --> 00:57:36,569
until we can appoint a permanent
replacement for Colonel Hart.

580
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:40,139
Captain, this is Colonel Ives.
Colonel, Captain Boyd.

581
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,700
Captain.

582
00:57:43,643 --> 00:57:45,738
How's the leg?

583
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,787
Lindus?

584
00:57:54,788 --> 00:57:56,815
Let's step outside.

585
00:58:01,595 --> 00:58:04,196
Now, what is the matter
with you, Captain Boyd?

586
00:58:04,197 --> 00:58:06,189
- It's him, sir.
- It's who?

587
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,000
- It's him, sir.
- Who is?

588
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,071
He's Colqhoun, sir.

589
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,206
Colonel Ives is?

590
00:58:14,207 --> 00:58:16,575
He's the one that...
that killed them all, sir.

591
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,177
Are you mad?

592
00:58:18,178 --> 00:58:21,413
Have Major Knox look at him.
Sir, Major Knox was here.

593
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,848
Major Knox.

594
00:58:22,849 --> 00:58:24,984
Have Major Knox look at him, sir.

595
00:58:24,985 --> 00:58:27,580
- Major Knox.
- Major Knox.

596
00:58:28,021 --> 00:58:30,548
He doesn't look
familiar to me, sir.

597
00:58:34,127 --> 00:58:37,096
I do remember the man wore a beard.

598
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:39,624
But, as I was saying, sir...

599
00:58:40,533 --> 00:58:42,701
I was feeling a bit ill that day.

600
00:58:42,702 --> 00:58:44,770
- You were drunk.
- Captain, please.

601
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:48,941
Boyd, you say you fired
on this Colqhoun...

602
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,707
struck him in the shoulder.

603
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,546
Well, that would leave a wound,
now, wouldn't it, General?

604
00:58:54,547 --> 00:58:58,651
I presume so. Well, why
don't we check, hmm?

605
00:58:58,652 --> 00:59:01,387
- Colonel Ives.
- General.

606
00:59:01,388 --> 00:59:03,255
Would you humor me a moment?

607
00:59:03,256 --> 00:59:04,957
Of course, sir.

608
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,518
Would you...

609
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,962
Would you take off
your shirt, please...

610
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:13,992
and show me your shoulder,
please, Colonel?

611
00:59:15,735 --> 00:59:17,466
Please.

612
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:23,503
Well, I, uh...

613
00:59:25,545 --> 00:59:28,413
My last physical examination was...

614
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,376
was not that long ago.

615
00:59:32,052 --> 00:59:35,512
Surely Major Knox has no
desire to hear me cough.

616
01:00:11,057 --> 01:00:13,357
The other shoulder,
please, Colonel.

617
01:00:24,304 --> 01:00:26,194
Thank you, Colonel.

618
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:32,370
Not at all.

619
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:36,875
- Is there a problem?
- Not with you, Colonel.

620
01:00:37,984 --> 01:00:40,579
General, we should leave now
in order to avoid the storm.

621
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:51,697
Boyd told the general Colonel
Ives killed everyone.

622
01:00:51,698 --> 01:00:53,465
What?

623
01:00:53,466 --> 01:00:55,959
He said Colonel Ives was
the man responsible.

624
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,570
Boyd gone loco.

625
01:01:02,175 --> 01:01:04,668
I think he's the reason
nobody come back.

626
01:01:07,514 --> 01:01:09,074
I have to warn you.

627
01:01:10,216 --> 01:01:12,050
Yeah, Captain?

628
01:01:12,051 --> 01:01:13,713
Consider yourselves warned.

629
01:01:15,655 --> 01:01:17,122
Do you need this?

630
01:01:17,123 --> 01:01:19,124
No, sir.

631
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:21,186
Oh, good.

632
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:30,325
You're not an eater of
ribs, Colonel Ives?

633
01:01:31,004 --> 01:01:32,894
No, no, Major. I, uh...

634
01:01:34,174 --> 01:01:36,667
can never forget it
used to be an animal.

635
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,946
Sentimental fellow.

636
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,215
What about you, Captain Boyd?
You don't eat meat?

637
01:01:43,216 --> 01:01:44,483
Oh, no, he won't.

638
01:01:44,484 --> 01:01:46,146
Only as a last resort.

639
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:48,780
That's a pity.

640
01:01:59,566 --> 01:02:01,433
Oh...

641
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:14,774
Yeah.

642
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,387
Unh!

643
01:02:42,275 --> 01:02:44,977
Boyd, no!

644
01:03:03,162 --> 01:03:05,052
Ha ha ha!

645
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,196
Damn.

646
01:03:51,644 --> 01:03:53,511
Ahem.

647
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:56,281
Checkmate.

648
01:03:56,282 --> 01:03:58,884
- Ha ha!
- Aah!

649
01:03:58,885 --> 01:04:00,650
Huh.

650
01:04:11,965 --> 01:04:13,525
Well, well...

651
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:17,397
It appears a number of
us could use some rest.

652
01:04:43,361 --> 01:04:45,092
Go on to bed, Boyd.

653
01:05:21,466 --> 01:05:23,026
Clearing up.

654
01:05:24,669 --> 01:05:27,264
I found your Private
Reich out there...

655
01:05:28,406 --> 01:05:30,637
or what was left of him.
You didn't finish.

656
01:05:30,942 --> 01:05:33,469
Well, I can't blame you.
He was tough.

657
01:05:35,146 --> 01:05:36,877
But then...

658
01:05:37,949 --> 01:05:40,249
a good soldier ought to be.

659
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:50,220
You know, not that long
ago, I couldn't do that.

660
01:05:52,663 --> 01:05:55,930
Could barely take a breath
without coughing up blood.

661
01:05:57,268 --> 01:05:59,067
Tuberculosis.

662
01:06:00,138 --> 01:06:02,172
That, along with...

663
01:06:02,173 --> 01:06:04,473
fierce headaches...

664
01:06:05,576 --> 01:06:07,136
depression...

665
01:06:08,012 --> 01:06:10,180
suicidal ambition.

666
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:13,641
I was in pretty horrible shape.

667
01:06:15,453 --> 01:06:17,013
In fact...

668
01:06:17,989 --> 01:06:19,956
I was on my way to a
sanatorium to convalesce...

669
01:06:19,957 --> 01:06:21,756
more likely to die...

670
01:06:22,627 --> 01:06:28,488
when en route, this Indian
scout told me a curious story.

671
01:06:29,667 --> 01:06:33,059
A man eats the flesh of another...

672
01:06:33,805 --> 01:06:36,036
he steals his strength.

673
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:42,606
He absorbs the other man's spirit.

674
01:06:44,982 --> 01:06:46,872
Well...

675
01:06:47,652 --> 01:06:49,815
I just had to try.

676
01:06:51,622 --> 01:06:53,623
Consequently, I ate
the scout first...

677
01:06:53,624 --> 01:06:55,958
and, you know, he was
absolutely right.

678
01:06:56,494 --> 01:06:59,062
I grew... stronger.

679
01:07:01,632 --> 01:07:02,866
Later, through circumstance...

680
01:07:02,867 --> 01:07:04,935
my wagon train grew
lost in the Rockies.

681
01:07:04,936 --> 01:07:07,429
- I've heard this story before.
- Mmm.

682
01:07:10,107 --> 01:07:12,771
I ate five men in three months.

683
01:07:14,479 --> 01:07:16,039
Tuberculosis?

684
01:07:16,447 --> 01:07:18,007
Vanished...

685
01:07:18,683 --> 01:07:20,607
as did the black thoughts.

686
01:07:21,319 --> 01:07:25,348
I reached Denver that
spring feeling... happy.

687
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:28,114
And healthy.

688
01:07:30,695 --> 01:07:32,824
And virile.

689
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:34,590
Did you eat her, too?

690
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:38,235
Well, as a matter of fact...

691
01:07:38,236 --> 01:07:39,503
You're disgusting.

692
01:07:41,939 --> 01:07:43,373
Here I am, one year later...

693
01:07:43,374 --> 01:07:45,642
feeling more alive
than ever before.

694
01:07:45,643 --> 01:07:48,477
And that's what surprises
me about you, Boyd.

695
01:07:48,913 --> 01:07:50,803
You've tasted it...

696
01:07:51,582 --> 01:07:53,381
felt its power.

697
01:07:54,318 --> 01:07:55,878
Yet, you're resisting.

698
01:07:57,054 --> 01:07:58,522
Why?

699
01:07:58,523 --> 01:08:00,457
Because it's wrong.

700
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:03,418
Ah! Morality...

701
01:08:04,562 --> 01:08:07,123
the last bastion...

702
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:10,133
of a coward.

703
01:08:10,134 --> 01:08:12,263
Well, I'm sorry.

704
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:16,032
I'm sorry. Did I offend you?

705
01:08:24,181 --> 01:08:26,014
You remember this?

706
01:08:32,823 --> 01:08:34,747
You smell it?

707
01:08:36,527 --> 01:08:41,023
Scent always jogs the
memory, don't you think?

708
01:08:43,367 --> 01:08:45,234
You remember the energy...

709
01:08:46,804 --> 01:08:50,206
the potency of someone else
coursing through your veins...

710
01:08:50,207 --> 01:08:52,876
someone brave.

711
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:55,609
You know the disappointment
as it dissipates...

712
01:08:57,114 --> 01:09:01,678
the strength... slipping
from your grasp...

713
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:07,157
the growing, killing
need to replenish.

714
01:09:11,228 --> 01:09:14,064
But I don't have to
remind you of that.

715
01:09:14,065 --> 01:09:15,864
You're feeling it right now.

716
01:09:22,807 --> 01:09:24,401
I am going to kill you.

717
01:09:24,942 --> 01:09:26,343
He die, you die.

718
01:09:26,344 --> 01:09:29,546
What in heck is going on out here?

719
01:09:29,547 --> 01:09:31,781
I was on my way to the latrine.
Boyd attacked me.

720
01:09:31,782 --> 01:09:33,116
He's a liar!

721
01:09:33,117 --> 01:09:35,018
He's lying!

722
01:09:35,019 --> 01:09:37,410
Boyd, I'm putting you under arrest.

723
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:43,248
Martha, go wake up Cleaves.
Put Boyd under arrest.

724
01:09:45,363 --> 01:09:47,097
Cleaves?

725
01:09:47,098 --> 01:09:48,658
Cleaves?

726
01:09:51,702 --> 01:09:53,203
Cleaves?

727
01:09:53,204 --> 01:09:54,764
Cleaves!

728
01:09:58,209 --> 01:09:59,542
You find Cleaves?

729
01:09:59,543 --> 01:10:00,710
No.

730
01:10:00,711 --> 01:10:02,479
- You check around outside?
- No.

731
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,280
Well, check around outside, woman!

732
01:10:21,165 --> 01:10:22,332
Cleaves?

733
01:10:37,682 --> 01:10:39,242
Cleaves?

734
01:10:40,985 --> 01:10:42,784
Cleaves?

735
01:10:49,727 --> 01:10:51,389
Oh... oh!

736
01:10:58,069 --> 01:11:00,232
Major Knox!

737
01:11:00,705 --> 01:11:02,265
Major!

738
01:11:04,508 --> 01:11:06,009
Major!

739
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:07,477
What?

740
01:11:07,478 --> 01:11:10,180
All the horses... dead!

741
01:11:10,181 --> 01:11:11,946
- What?
- Killed!

742
01:11:15,519 --> 01:11:17,079
Oh, good gracious.

743
01:11:41,746 --> 01:11:43,346
Unh!

744
01:11:43,347 --> 01:11:45,248
That was for Cleaves...

745
01:11:45,249 --> 01:11:47,412
and this is for my horse.

746
01:11:51,756 --> 01:11:53,316
Martha...

747
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:56,493
Colonel Ives and I have agreed...

748
01:11:56,494 --> 01:12:00,057
Boyd'll be moved to a military
prison as soon as possible.

749
01:12:00,564 --> 01:12:03,933
One of us must travel to
San Miguel by foot...

750
01:12:03,934 --> 01:12:05,969
to get General Slauson.

751
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:08,031
Volunteers?

752
01:12:16,747 --> 01:12:18,546
Safe travel to you, Martha.

753
01:12:48,678 --> 01:12:50,238
Oh...

754
01:13:05,294 --> 01:13:06,854
Knox?

755
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,320
Major Knox?

756
01:13:11,968 --> 01:13:13,528
Knox!

757
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:22,408
Major Knox!

758
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:25,580
Major Knox!

759
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:39,550
Knox!

760
01:13:42,531 --> 01:13:45,000
Talk to me. I'd like to
know you're still alive.

761
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:47,699
Be quiet, Boyd.

762
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:50,097
Good gracious.

763
01:13:52,675 --> 01:13:54,599
Colonel Ives.

764
01:13:55,211 --> 01:13:57,178
My sword is missing.

765
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:58,346
I'm sorry, Major?

766
01:13:58,347 --> 01:14:01,773
My sword... in the
parlor, above the fire.

767
01:14:03,219 --> 01:14:04,779
I haven't seen it.

768
01:14:08,457 --> 01:14:10,291
What are you cooking?

769
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:13,395
It's, uh... stew.

770
01:14:13,396 --> 01:14:15,230
You need any help?

771
01:14:15,231 --> 01:14:17,432
No, no, though...

772
01:14:17,433 --> 01:14:19,198
perhaps later, you might...

773
01:14:20,102 --> 01:14:21,469
contribute.

774
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:23,565
You let me know.

775
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:25,306
Ives.

776
01:14:25,307 --> 01:14:26,708
Ives!

777
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:29,344
Yes... Captain?

778
01:14:29,345 --> 01:14:31,012
When did you do it, Ives?

779
01:14:31,013 --> 01:14:32,180
Do what, Captain?

780
01:14:32,181 --> 01:14:33,681
Kill Cleaves and the horses.

781
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:35,350
I was watching you the whole time.

782
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:38,311
You be quiet about Cleaves
and the horses, Boyd!

783
01:14:38,954 --> 01:14:41,089
You hear me?

784
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:43,424
Or I will put you out again.

785
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:55,634
Well, how'd that door come open?

786
01:15:00,176 --> 01:15:02,203
That'll do it.

787
01:15:02,812 --> 01:15:04,372
Good gracious.

788
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:10,218
Knox?

789
01:15:13,355 --> 01:15:14,915
Knox!

790
01:15:21,697 --> 01:15:23,587
Hello, Boyd.

791
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:26,034
I hated doing that.

792
01:15:26,035 --> 01:15:27,869
Unh.

793
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:31,940
I told you my regimen had
certain curative powers, Boyd.

794
01:15:31,941 --> 01:15:33,672
Get him up and around.

795
01:15:39,715 --> 01:15:42,310
Oh... oh!

796
01:15:43,385 --> 01:15:46,754
Leg still hurt? Doesn't
have to, you know.

797
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:48,452
You killed Cleaves...

798
01:15:48,891 --> 01:15:50,451
and the horses.

799
01:15:53,796 --> 01:15:55,356
What happened to you?

800
01:16:00,436 --> 01:16:02,235
I thought I was dead.

801
01:16:03,205 --> 01:16:07,803
I remember feeling panic
as my life slipped away.

802
01:16:09,345 --> 01:16:10,912
It was like drowning in darkness...

803
01:16:10,913 --> 01:16:13,941
and then... there was nothing.

804
01:16:15,551 --> 01:16:17,885
And then I woke up...

805
01:16:18,587 --> 01:16:20,181
and Ives was feeding me.

806
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,091
By the time I regained my senses...

807
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:24,823
there was no turning back.

808
01:16:25,628 --> 01:16:28,155
I feel terrific.

809
01:16:29,131 --> 01:16:30,298
So, you're going to kill me?

810
01:16:30,299 --> 01:16:32,534
No. No.

811
01:16:32,535 --> 01:16:34,536
It's lonely being a cannibal.

812
01:16:34,537 --> 01:16:36,700
Tough making friends.

813
01:16:37,406 --> 01:16:39,364
No, I like you, Boyd.

814
01:16:40,176 --> 01:16:43,374
We, uh, want to bring
you into the fold.

815
01:16:44,013 --> 01:16:46,278
You got to eat.

816
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:49,851
Finished?

817
01:16:49,852 --> 01:16:53,788
I'm afraid Major Knox's
penchant for bourbon...

818
01:16:53,789 --> 01:16:55,588
didn't leave him in the pink.

819
01:17:01,664 --> 01:17:03,224
You take over.

820
01:17:07,102 --> 01:17:10,403
Manifest... destiny.

821
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:15,076
Westward expansion.

822
01:17:15,077 --> 01:17:16,967
You know, come April...

823
01:17:17,947 --> 01:17:19,541
it'll all start again.

824
01:17:22,084 --> 01:17:23,818
Thousands of gold-hungry
Americans...

825
01:17:23,819 --> 01:17:26,414
will travel over those mountains...

826
01:17:27,256 --> 01:17:29,521
on their way to new lives...

827
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:34,395
passing right... through...

828
01:17:34,396 --> 01:17:36,764
here.

829
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,462
We won't kill...

830
01:17:40,135 --> 01:17:41,729
indiscriminately.

831
01:17:44,139 --> 01:17:46,734
No... selectively.

832
01:17:48,711 --> 01:17:50,271
Good God...

833
01:17:51,013 --> 01:17:52,714
we don't want to break up families.

834
01:17:52,715 --> 01:17:54,415
People are not stupid, Ives.

835
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:55,850
Really?

836
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:57,018
You'll get caught.

837
01:17:57,019 --> 01:17:59,319
Well, if it's just the two of us...

838
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:03,919
jolly old Hart and I.

839
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:08,261
You see, that's why we need others.

840
01:18:10,099 --> 01:18:11,659
You, for one.

841
01:18:13,369 --> 01:18:15,293
General Slauson.

842
01:18:16,438 --> 01:18:18,406
Of course, we've no wish
to recruit everyone.

843
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:20,672
We've enough mouths
to feed, as it is.

844
01:18:23,212 --> 01:18:25,170
We just need a home.

845
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:26,974
And this country...

846
01:18:27,816 --> 01:18:29,706
is seeking to be whole.

847
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,753
Stretching out its arms...

848
01:18:34,823 --> 01:18:36,884
and consuming all it can.

849
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:42,127
And we merely follow.

850
01:18:43,699 --> 01:18:45,930
Not me.

851
01:18:49,138 --> 01:18:51,733
You know, it's not courage
to resist me, Boyd.

852
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:55,599
It's courage to accept me.

853
01:18:58,614 --> 01:19:00,709
I mean, you're already one of us.

854
01:19:02,217 --> 01:19:03,777
Well...

855
01:19:04,353 --> 01:19:05,913
almost.

856
01:19:07,256 --> 01:19:08,816
You hunger for it.

857
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:13,989
You just won't resign
yourself to it.

858
01:19:16,065 --> 01:19:19,059
It's not so difficult, really...

859
01:19:20,736 --> 01:19:22,603
acquiescence.

860
01:19:24,106 --> 01:19:26,235
It's easy, actually.

861
01:19:29,878 --> 01:19:33,145
You just... give... in.

862
01:19:33,816 --> 01:19:35,376
I can't.

863
01:19:37,386 --> 01:19:39,276
Oh, well.

864
01:19:41,457 --> 01:19:43,518
Then...

865
01:19:44,093 --> 01:19:45,460
you die.

866
01:19:50,966 --> 01:19:53,163
It's all right, it's not fatal.

867
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:56,336
Not if you take the
necessary precautions.

868
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:03,878
Stew a la Major Knox.

869
01:20:03,879 --> 01:20:05,546
This will fix you up.

870
01:20:05,547 --> 01:20:08,249
The old souse was a lot
stronger than he looked.

871
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,851
A couple of doses of this...

872
01:20:09,852 --> 01:20:13,119
you'll be right as rain
and twice as strong.

873
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:18,652
Well...

874
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:23,657
Isn't this civilized?

875
01:20:28,003 --> 01:20:29,927
Mmm.

876
01:20:31,673 --> 01:20:33,267
You know...

877
01:20:34,777 --> 01:20:36,576
Ben Franklin once said...

878
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:39,306
"Eat to live...

879
01:20:39,982 --> 01:20:42,714
"don't live to eat."

880
01:20:43,986 --> 01:20:46,047
Huh? Huh?

881
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:51,192
It's an easy decision, Boyd.

882
01:20:51,193 --> 01:20:54,426
You can either famine or feast.

883
01:20:55,164 --> 01:20:56,929
Live or die.

884
01:21:51,683 --> 01:21:53,243
Bravo.

885
01:22:00,024 --> 01:22:02,915
Here, chickie, chickie, chickie.

886
01:22:03,394 --> 01:22:05,386
Run away! Run for your lives!

887
01:22:05,997 --> 01:22:07,230
Having fun?

888
01:22:07,231 --> 01:22:08,825
Morning.

889
01:22:09,534 --> 01:22:11,834
The general's coming, remember?

890
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:26,643
Well, you're up.

891
01:22:26,984 --> 01:22:28,749
Feeling better?

892
01:22:33,458 --> 01:22:35,525
"Waste not, want not."

893
01:22:35,526 --> 01:22:37,359
Ben Franklin.

894
01:22:40,064 --> 01:22:41,624
How's the wound?

895
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,726
Oh, right as rain.

896
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:52,075
Yeah.

897
01:22:52,677 --> 01:22:54,305
So it is.

898
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:57,744
I could use some fresh air.

899
01:23:02,086 --> 01:23:03,680
Are you to be trusted?

900
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,920
Of course not.

901
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:41,886
Walnut, Boyd?

902
01:23:51,869 --> 01:23:53,203
All my books are gone.

903
01:23:53,204 --> 01:23:57,370
I'll miss them. Plato, Aristotle.

904
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:02,112
For two millennia, struggling
with the nature of man...

905
01:24:02,113 --> 01:24:04,214
the ideal society...

906
01:24:04,215 --> 01:24:06,416
morality.

907
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:08,251
Boil it down...

908
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:10,387
it's the same issues...

909
01:24:10,388 --> 01:24:12,813
we can't solve today...

910
01:24:13,491 --> 01:24:15,959
happiness and how to achieve it.

911
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,295
Aristotle sought truth,
Colonel, not happiness.

912
01:24:18,296 --> 01:24:20,288
Truth? Ha!

913
01:24:21,065 --> 01:24:22,666
I led my whole life
according to what...

914
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:25,802
I thought was right and true,
and look where it got me...

915
01:24:25,803 --> 01:24:27,500
Fort Spencer.

916
01:24:31,943 --> 01:24:33,503
Come on, General.

917
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:36,808
You have to let me go now, sir.

918
01:24:37,348 --> 01:24:38,942
You know I can't do that.

919
01:24:39,317 --> 01:24:40,483
Why not?

920
01:24:40,484 --> 01:24:42,452
We are not alone.

921
01:24:42,453 --> 01:24:43,687
There's nowhere to go.

922
01:24:43,688 --> 01:24:45,188
I'm still having nightmares.

923
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:46,823
Oh, no, no.

924
01:24:46,824 --> 01:24:49,593
Reich, Cleaves, Knox.

925
01:24:49,594 --> 01:24:51,027
No! I don't want to hear this!

926
01:24:51,028 --> 01:24:53,463
- There's no turning back now!
- I know that, sir.

927
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:54,965
Don't you understand?

928
01:24:54,966 --> 01:24:57,968
All you have to do is kill!

929
01:24:57,969 --> 01:25:00,667
You have to kill to live!

930
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,564
You have to kill!

931
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:08,300
Uh-huh.

932
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:11,343
There we are.

933
01:25:12,783 --> 01:25:17,051
Breakfast, lunch, reinforcements.

934
01:25:20,858 --> 01:25:22,486
I'm going to kill him.

935
01:25:41,145 --> 01:25:42,705
Take the knife.

936
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:48,813
You have to do me a
favor before you go.

937
01:25:50,655 --> 01:25:52,215
You have to kill me.

938
01:25:54,592 --> 01:25:56,926
I can't live like this anymore.

939
01:25:58,863 --> 01:26:00,753
Do it.

940
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:05,424
Quickly, please.

941
01:26:17,782 --> 01:26:19,376
Aah!

942
01:27:50,674 --> 01:27:52,803
Ives!

943
01:29:13,854 --> 01:29:15,778
Aaaaah!

944
01:29:26,567 --> 01:29:28,298
Uhh!

945
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:41,607
Gaaaah!

946
01:30:16,383 --> 01:30:17,943
Aaaah!

947
01:32:42,262 --> 01:32:44,061
Aah!

948
01:32:55,309 --> 01:32:57,233
That was...

949
01:32:57,845 --> 01:32:59,405
really...

950
01:33:00,481 --> 01:33:02,280
sneaky.

951
01:33:10,691 --> 01:33:12,388
You know...

952
01:33:13,827 --> 01:33:16,286
if you die first...

953
01:33:17,464 --> 01:33:20,128
I am definitely going to eat you.

954
01:33:21,935 --> 01:33:23,495
The question is...

955
01:33:25,672 --> 01:33:27,630
if I die...

956
01:33:29,743 --> 01:33:32,168
what are you going to do?

957
01:33:36,483 --> 01:33:38,180
Bon appétit.

958
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:31,230
Eat...

959
01:34:32,539 --> 01:34:33,873
or die.

960
01:34:52,626 --> 01:34:54,391
Mmm.

961
01:35:00,467 --> 01:35:02,528
Mmm.

962
01:35:04,538 --> 01:35:06,472
Eat...

963
01:35:06,473 --> 01:35:08,067
or...

964
01:35:53,787 --> 01:35:55,552
Uhh.

964
01:35:56,305 --> 01:36:56,847
