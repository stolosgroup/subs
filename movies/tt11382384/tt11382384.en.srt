OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:37,766
I didn't want to believe
in the beginning,

3
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,898
what happened to Jamal.

4
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:41,813
Prominent Saudi journalist

5
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:43,554
and Washington Post columnist

6
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:45,339
has gone missing
after visiting

7
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,210
his country's consulate
in Istanbul.

8
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:54,652
Yes, I knew that I was
doing something dangerous.

9
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:56,480
But I didn't know that,
you know,

10
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:59,440
we're going to lose
so many lives because of it.

11
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:02,965
On Tuesday, Jamal Khashoggi

12
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,575
entered the Saudi consulate

13
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,621
in Istanbul
but hasn't been seen since.

14
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,015
Saudi and Turkish officials

15
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,887
have given conflicting accounts

16
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,932
on the whereabouts
of Jamal Khashoggi,

17
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:15,499
who's known for criticizing

18
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:18,154
Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman's policy

19
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,025
inside Saudi Arabia.

20
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,853
Once an adviser and friend

21
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,638
of Saudi's royal and elites,

22
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:26,336
he now lives in self-exile
in the U.S.

23
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,210
and is an outspoken critic
of his government's policies.

24
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,272
Turkish authorities believe

25
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,100
prominent Saudi journalist,

26
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:53,233
Jamal Khashoggi,
has been killed.

27
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,252
...what I want in my retirement.

28
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:25,863
I'm 60 years old,
and I want to enjoy life,

29
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,212
and I want to be free.

30
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:28,997
Unfortunately,
the government treated me

31
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,739
as if I shot the King,
God forbid, and I ran away.

32
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:32,914
As I am a traitor.

33
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:37,440
After his death,

34
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:39,007
Jamal became a hero.

35
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:45,143
We cry when we hear
that the hero is killed.

36
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:47,494
But his works,

37
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:51,193
his cause, his vision,

38
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:52,847
it would live forever.

39
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:57,504
What do you know
about the bees?

40
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,523
We know from here that

41
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,395
he entered this embassy
and didn't come out.

42
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:33,529
...in Istanbul, seekingpaperwork to marry his fiancée.

43
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,488
His fiancée saw him
go in at 1:00 p.m.

44
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:39,796
and was still waiting
for him after 1:00 a.m.

45
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,967
Saudi officials have denied that

46
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,839
a prominent Saudi journalist
is in their custody.

47
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:25,537
Jamal Khashoggi has
reportedly been missing

48
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,235
for more than 24 hours.

49
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,324
Turkey says that
they will be cooperating

50
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,240
with Saudi authorities
to resolve the incident.

51
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,808
The consulate said
it had no comment

52
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:37,724
when asked why
he never came out.

53
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:42,467
Can you tell me what
happened to Mr. Khashoggi?

54
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,208
What happened
to Mr. Khashoggi?

55
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:47,385
Did you talk to him?

56
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:56,873
Okay.

57
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,181
Jamal--

58
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:01,791
Jamal Khashoggi.

59
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:04,228
Jamal Ahmad Khashoggi.

60
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,583
Right. Okay.

61
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:09,163
What year was that,
Jamal, that you graduated?

62
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:11,513
- Eighty-one. Yes.
- Nineteen eighty-one?

63
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:14,037
Business Administration degree from Indiana State.

64
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:17,301
But since then, I'm happy
to see from his biography,

65
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:20,217
Jamal is a rara avis,
at least in our society,

66
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:23,090
full-time long-term
professional journalist.

67
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,657
He doesn't seem tempted
to be doing anything else.

68
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:47,549
Saudi Arabia is a monarchy.

69
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:50,160
I mean, the king has ruled
that it should happen.

70
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,545
- On Twitter?
- On Twitter.

71
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:59,202
I was criticizing everything

72
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:01,683
except the royal family.

73
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:07,384
But I didn't have
a very huge audience.

74
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:10,387
I was just a regular guy
with hundred followers.

75
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,284
The Saudi King's jet carries

76
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:06,068
its own royal staircase.

77
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,505
Waiting at the bottom of it at Gatwick Airport this morning

78
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,333
were the Prince
and Princess of Wales.

79
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:13,510
The king of one of the most closed societies in the world

80
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:16,078
looking at ease
in this more open one.

81
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,775
The Saudi government
and the monarchy

82
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,649
has evolved significantly
over the last 80 years,

83
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:24,043
basically,
since the kingdom was founded.

84
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,222
The founder of Saudi Arabia,
King Abdulaziz,

85
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,485
had about 37 sons or so.

86
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:33,965
And political power,
as well as economic power,

87
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:36,185
was distributed
among those sons.

88
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:39,319
A pivotal country
saw a lavish welcome

89
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,842
for the man who controls

90
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:43,323
nearly half the world's
oil reserves.

91
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,935
Once King Abdulaziz died,

92
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:48,241
the crown was passed through

93
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:49,633
to his son,

94
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:52,027
to his son, to his son.

95
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,248
King Salman became the king

96
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,989
and the game
has completely changed.

97
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,429
A new king
reigns in a country

98
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:04,300
with enormous sway
over the world economy

99
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:06,389
and the war on terror.

100
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,567
While in the past, the king really had to rely on

101
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:14,876
a lot of his brothers in order to govern the kingdom.

102
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,921
When they passed
from the scene,

103
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:18,662
more and more powers
concentrated

104
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:22,449
in the hands of his heirs,

105
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:24,364
and that's the situation
we have today.

106
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,598
Saudi Arabia has granted

107
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:45,167
Turkish investigators permission to enter and search.

108
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,061
This is history.

109
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:06,934
Protesters forcing change earlier this year in Tunisia,

110
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:09,371
now succeeding
in forcing change in Egypt

111
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:12,679
after nearly 30 years
of Mubarak rule.

112
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:17,205
That's two Arab leaders
in two months.

113
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:29,826
Arab governments are watching closely,

114
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,872
wary that a revolution
might be headed

115
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,569
to their country next.

116
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:00,379
The military's crackdown
on opposition in Egypt

117
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:04,034
had resulted in over
14,000 people thrown in jail.

118
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,203
John, good morning.

119
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:27,727
I'm on a new phone.

120
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,555
Uh, this is temporary.

121
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:34,995
Let's not exchange sensitive
information until you arrive.

122
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:37,563
But this is how to get
in touch with me until then.

123
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:42,959
I tell people
that Jamal and I

124
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:46,180
were not supposed
to be friends.

125
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:49,052
I mean, I'm a pretty
well-known dissident.

126
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:53,970
But in 2012, he started
following me on Twitter.

127
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:56,190
He was very interested
in social media

128
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:57,931
in terms of the phenomena.

129
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:03,719
Saudi Arabia has an unprecedented online population.

130
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,551
We know that
there's no free speech.

131
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:12,641
So, Twitter became
the parliament of the Arabs.

132
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:44,586
...already proposed a series

133
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,022
of economic and social changes

134
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:49,373
under the banner
of Saudi Vision 2030.

135
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:52,028
The highly anticipated
2030 Vision

136
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:55,379
seems to radically change
the image of the Kingdom.

137
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:57,077
The man behind it all,

138
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,514
Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman,

139
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,995
is regarded
as a progressive leader,

140
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,824
touting social
and economic reforms.

141
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:12,092
And critics say, MBS,

142
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:15,182
as he's known,
is also power hungry.

143
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:16,923
I had met Mohammed Salman

144
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:19,665
when he was Chief of Staff
to his father.

145
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:24,452
We understood
that he was very ambitious,

146
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:28,412
a very impatient,
and a favorite son.

147
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:31,764
He pushed aside
King Salman's half-brother,

148
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:35,768
Prince Muqrin and the Crown
Prince, Muhammad Nayef.

149
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:39,336
He's being described as the power behind the throne,

150
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,383
and has had a hand in nearly
everything in the Kingdom.

151
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:44,385
He is emancipating women,

152
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:46,213
introducing music and cinema,

153
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:48,432
and cracking down
on corruption.

154
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:18,680
This is an American first,

155
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,464
never before has a president
set foot

156
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:23,685
on Saudi soil
for his first trip abroad.

157
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:37,438
America will not seek to impose
our way of life on others,

158
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:40,093
but to outstretch our hands

159
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:43,705
in the spirit
of cooperation and trust.

160
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:45,359
What my sources told me

161
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:47,840
was the Saudis and Mohammed
bin Salman, in particular,

162
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:49,319
were trying to forge
a relationship

163
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:51,147
with people
in The White House,

164
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:54,107
and most particularly
with Jared Kushner,

165
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,457
who's the President's
son-in-law and Senior Advisor.

166
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:09,731
Three billion dollars,

167
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:12,603
$533 million,

168
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:15,694
$525 million.

169
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,130
That's peanuts for you.

170
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:19,175
You should've increased it.
Eight hundred...

171
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:29,533
He said that he's milking
the country.

172
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:39,718
I'm sure
Saudi Arabian officials

173
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:40,980
were caught off-guard

174
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:43,460
by the election
of Mr. Trump. Now...

175
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:47,160
I think all of us, as Saudis,
should worry about it.

176
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:51,468
I strongly believe that
the struggle for democracy

177
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:54,645
in the Middle East
are the core of all problems.

178
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:19,105
When Jamal heard
that statement,

179
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:20,584
he was shocked.

180
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:25,372
By 2017,

181
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:28,897
Jamal had an enormous audience.

182
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:34,250
MBS put together a plan
to control the public sphere.

183
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:37,819
Saud al-Qahtani,
MBS's right-hand man,

184
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:40,082
managed
to implement this plan...

185
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,825
...creating Twitter army
of trolls

186
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:46,959
to control
the freedom of speech.

187
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,612
Al-Qahtani worked behind the scenes

188
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,571
as an enforcer
for the Crown Prince.

189
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:52,225
Qahtani was known
for targeting those

190
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:55,445
who spoke out
against Riyadh on Twitter.

191
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:50,239
They're not dissidents.

192
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:53,852
The people were
not even being dissidents.

193
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,766
These were the thought-makers,

194
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,727
the opinion-makers
of Saudi society.

195
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,642
Writers and intellectuals.

196
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:39,642
For the first time,
we are now hearing

197
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:42,819
from the fiancée of WashingtonPost reporter Jamal Khashoggi...

198
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:44,125
...has called on U.S. lawmakers

199
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:46,127
to hold
Saudi Arabia accountable.

200
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,868
His fiancée says
she'll fight to ensure

201
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:49,957
everyone who is responsible
for his death

202
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,002
is brought to justice.

203
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:07,453
Yeah. I need 10 minutes.

204
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:08,454
Yes.

205
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:12,762
We need
to cross the opening...

206
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:14,329
Absolutely. But let's go...

207
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:30,519
If we can just announce
the press briefing.

208
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:32,478
And is there any questions?

209
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,306
If there's questions,
we cannot...

210
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:14,439
I said,
"But here's the thing.

211
00:39:14,482 --> 00:39:16,832
Not every single one
of them trusts you."

212
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:21,837
You are saying that
Jamal might be a spy.

213
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:28,409
I met Jamal in Washington

214
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:32,021
after a manor
connected me to him.

215
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:34,459
I think we bonded a lot
over food. Heh.

216
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:39,246
Like most, I guess,
Middle Easterners.

217
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,988
He told me that
he had moved to the U.S.

218
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:44,207
and that he was all alone

219
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:45,687
and didn't know
what was happening

220
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:48,864
for the first time
in his life at age 60.

221
00:39:48,908 --> 00:39:51,389
I remember
he started tearing up,

222
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:57,003
telling me how his wife whom
he had loved very, very much,

223
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:58,613
she wasn't okay with it.

224
00:39:58,657 --> 00:39:59,788
She-- Nobody was.

225
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:01,094
His kids weren't okay with it.

226
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:02,400
Nobody was okay with it.

227
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:06,360
Everything was left behind

228
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,669
and the country--
60 years of his life--

229
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:12,018
everything.

230
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:15,413
He struggled with it
every single day.

231
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:21,027
In Saudi Arabia,
he was the biggest insider.

232
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,072
And then, all of a sudden,
he finds himself

233
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:24,378
on the outside,

234
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,336
on the very much outside.

235
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:34,257
I felt, like, for him
to settle emotionally,

236
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:38,392
mentally, physically,
he needed to write again.

237
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:23,219
I was a friend
of Jamal Khashoggi's

238
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:25,483
for about 15 years.

239
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:30,096
When he came toThe Washington
Post, he was transported.

240
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:31,880
This was something
that he had dreamed about.

241
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:33,360
You have to understand
what it's like

242
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:34,579
to be a journalist
in Saudi Arabia.

243
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:36,102
Every time
you try to say something

244
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:38,408
that's tough-minded,
you get fired.

245
00:41:41,281 --> 00:41:44,937
He was the sort of person that just couldn't take a pass.

246
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,418
If he felt something, he just insisted on writing it.

247
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:51,465
I watched him get fired

248
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,337
from a series of jobs
in Saudi Arabia,

249
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:57,515
each time because
he just couldn't stop himself

250
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:59,517
from saying
what he thought was true.

251
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,434
All we want from you this time

252
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:34,046
is to like and subscribe.

253
00:44:08,428 --> 00:44:11,649
We're seeing a truly historic
upheaval unfold right now.

254
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:14,086
A royal purge in Saudi Arabia.

255
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:17,306
King Salman
ordered the creation

256
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:19,439
of a new
anti-corruption committee

257
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:22,964
headed by son,
Prince Mohammed Salman.

258
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:25,271
November of 2017,

259
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:27,447
Mohammed Bin Salman
basically rounds up

260
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,884
the most powerful people
in Saudi Arabia,

261
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:32,539
puts them
in the Ritz in Riyadh,

262
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:34,367
basically a five-star prison,

263
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,283
and shakes them down
for a lot of money,

264
00:44:37,326 --> 00:44:39,285
over a $100 billion.

265
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:41,896
Mohammed Bin Salman
ordered the arrest

266
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,030
of powerful princes,
ministers, and investors.

267
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:48,686
Some are his rivals
in the royal family.

268
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:05,659
Is this also about
sending a message that,

269
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:09,010
as we say in America,
there's a new sheriff in town?

270
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:41,564
Jamal was starting
to realize that

271
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:44,698
there's little
he can do for his country

272
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,744
from his position
other than to write.

273
00:45:52,706 --> 00:45:54,882
Jamal Khashoggi
was kind of a black box

274
00:45:54,926 --> 00:45:57,493
of the ruling elites
in Saudi Arabia.

275
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:14,423
It is easy to sit
and say we need,

276
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:15,990
particularly in front
of American audience,

277
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:17,383
we need more freedom,
we need more--

278
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:18,601
these are golden things.

279
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:19,951
Everybody loves them.

280
00:46:19,994 --> 00:46:21,039
--You have to be practical.

281
00:46:21,082 --> 00:46:22,649
I'm not asking
for democracy,

282
00:46:22,692 --> 00:46:25,217
I'm asking for people
to be allowed to speak.

283
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,872
This is--
I'm asking for the minimum.

284
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:02,228
In summer 2018,

285
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:04,535
they were attacking him
basically every single day,

286
00:56:04,578 --> 00:56:07,364
threatening him,
trying to silence him.

287
00:56:09,714 --> 00:56:12,847
So Jamal felt the whole country was against him.

288
00:56:14,545 --> 00:56:16,111
And that was hurting him.

289
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,985
He said, "Sometimes,
I feel a lot like

290
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:21,813
"I don't wanna talk
about anything.

291
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:23,858
I don't wanna expose
my opinions."

292
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:26,426
I said, "No, no, no.

293
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:30,256
You're just a victim
of what we call the Flies."

294
00:56:34,826 --> 00:56:37,829
The government hired
thousands of people.

295
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:43,530
Every one of them using
10, 20 accounts.

296
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:54,498
The moment they think critic
of the government has posted,

297
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:56,978
the flies swarmed,

298
00:56:57,022 --> 00:57:00,025
attacking with hundreds
of negative replies.

299
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,463
Within minutes,
the tweet is covered

300
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:06,466
in pro-government
comments and hashtags,

301
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,208
causing the person's voice
to be lost.

302
00:57:11,645 --> 00:57:14,474
Then each fly posts
pro-government articles

303
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:17,999
and hashtags,
supporting MBS's vision.

304
00:57:19,827 --> 00:57:24,397
And all of the fly can repost
thousands of those tweets...

305
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:27,356
forcing the state's
false narrative

306
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,663
to the top of trending
inside the country.

307
00:57:31,665 --> 00:57:33,624
This is
the whole Twitter monster

308
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:36,757
that Saud al-Qahtani created

309
00:57:36,801 --> 00:57:39,325
and you have the troll master
himself on the top.

310
00:58:10,965 --> 00:58:14,360
I could get hundreds of
volunteers from Saudi Arabia,

311
00:58:14,403 --> 00:58:16,754
Kuwait, Yemen,
other countries.

312
00:58:18,364 --> 00:58:20,888
Each armed
with two, three phones,

313
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:23,064
generating hundreds
of accounts.

314
00:58:24,762 --> 00:58:26,546
But first
we would have to make sure

315
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:29,244
that they are protected.

316
00:58:29,288 --> 00:58:31,420
Anyone tweeting
inside Saudi Arabia

317
00:58:31,464 --> 00:58:33,510
will be immediately identified

318
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:36,904
since the government
owns all this other networks.

319
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:40,212
So to mask their identities,

320
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,606
we must give them American
or Canadian safeguards.

321
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:48,350
To battle The Flies,

322
00:58:48,394 --> 00:58:51,092
we will call ourselves
The Bees Army.

323
00:58:51,136 --> 00:58:53,181
We would organize
the volunteers

324
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:55,227
into groups of 40 or 50 bees,

325
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:58,012
each reporting
to a supervising lieutenant.

326
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:02,060
Once I give the command,
each lieutenant

327
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:04,323
will tell their bee soldier
a specific tweet

328
00:59:04,366 --> 00:59:05,890
or hashtag to protect.

329
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:10,242
But we're not going to use
the same method.

330
00:59:19,817 --> 00:59:21,383
Give them the freedom

331
00:59:21,427 --> 00:59:23,255
to say whatever they want.

332
00:59:26,214 --> 00:59:28,303
The Flies will,
of course, attack.

333
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:34,962
But if our numbers
are stronger,

334
00:59:35,006 --> 00:59:37,922
we will be able to rise above
the propaganda machine...

335
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:43,710
and finally install freedom
of speech inside the Kingdom.

336
00:59:46,234 --> 00:59:48,497
Jamal was really happy
of the idea.

337
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:51,022
He said, "Brilliant, I really like it."

338
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:39,728
Focusing all our efforts
on one hashtag,

339
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,302
So the moment he left,

340
01:04:31,345 --> 01:04:33,695
they called
Saud al-Qahtani's office?

341
01:04:57,502 --> 01:05:00,070
And that was the turning point.

342
01:05:00,113 --> 01:05:02,550
It started trending.

343
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:45,376
Jamal was surprised,
so then he started

344
01:05:45,419 --> 01:05:47,204
to tweet with us,
he tweeted it.

345
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:53,514
And then we did it.

346
01:05:53,558 --> 01:05:56,082
Number one trending
in Saudi Arabia.

347
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:05,962
And suddenly...

348
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:07,572
he's not answering.

349
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,970
He's just gone, disappeared.

350
01:07:04,716 --> 01:07:08,676
When I heard this,
I was driving to my house.

351
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,766
My friends calling me
continuously.

352
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:13,986
Come on, Jamal Khashoggi.

353
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,553
It's news.

354
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:19,252
I called a couple
of journalists based in Istanbul

355
01:07:19,296 --> 01:07:23,126
like Reuters,
Al Jazeera, Washington Post.

356
01:07:25,215 --> 01:07:28,044
There's really not a playbook
for this type of situation,

357
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:30,263
but we did know that
we needed to act quickly.

358
01:07:30,307 --> 01:07:33,571
Within hours,
we had a letter dispatched through the ambassador

359
01:07:33,614 --> 01:07:38,010
and through the United States government to the Crown Prince.

360
01:07:48,542 --> 01:07:51,328
I'd ask to meet with
the Saudi ambassador of the U.S.

361
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:53,286
who happens to be the brother
of the Crown Prince.

362
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:56,376
First response was that
he was looking into the matter.

363
01:08:40,812 --> 01:08:44,946
First day, there was
10 or 12 journalists

364
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,296
waiting outside.

365
01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:48,254
The day after, hundreds.

366
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:51,692
He entered this embassy...

367
01:08:51,736 --> 01:08:55,000
Two days later, 200.

368
01:08:55,043 --> 01:08:57,785
We demand his immediate release
if alive.

369
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,364
I am concerned about it.

370
01:09:54,407 --> 01:09:55,930
I don't like hearing about it.

371
01:09:55,974 --> 01:09:58,890
And hopefully,
that will sort itself out.

372
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:01,414
Right now, nobody knows
anything about it,

373
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,895
but there's somepretty bad stories going around.

374
01:10:03,938 --> 01:10:06,158
I do not like it.
Thank you. I'll see you.

375
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,029
I'll see you at 10:00.

376
01:10:28,398 --> 01:10:30,226
I will not let you down

377
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:34,230
and I will not stop
defending you.

378
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:35,883
Always be well.

379
01:11:14,226 --> 01:11:16,489
To breaking news now,
we are getting reports

380
01:11:16,533 --> 01:11:18,317
that Turkish authorities
believe that

381
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:19,536
prominent Saudi journalist

382
01:11:19,579 --> 01:11:21,364
Jamal Khashoggi
has been killed.

383
01:11:21,407 --> 01:11:23,191
- Jamal Khashoggi--
- Jamal Khashoggi--

384
01:11:25,846 --> 01:11:27,544
We heard
one lie after another

385
01:11:27,587 --> 01:11:29,459
from the Saudi government.

386
01:11:29,502 --> 01:11:31,591
Saudi Arabia has denied angrily

387
01:11:31,635 --> 01:11:34,028
that it abducted, harmed,
or killed Khashoggi.

388
01:11:34,072 --> 01:11:36,030
Now suddenly,
the country is admitting

389
01:11:36,074 --> 01:11:38,642
that Khashoggi did die
inside that building.

390
01:11:38,685 --> 01:11:42,341
We heard that
he suffocated accidentally.

391
01:11:42,385 --> 01:11:44,256
We heard that there was
a drug administered

392
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,866
that had an unintended effect.

393
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:48,913
The government now says
he died in a fist fight.

394
01:12:05,886 --> 01:12:09,455
A Saudi agent was captured
on surveillance cameras

395
01:12:09,499 --> 01:12:13,546
in Istanbul
wearing Khashoggi's clothes.

396
01:12:50,888 --> 01:12:53,020
The Washington Post
has just posted

397
01:12:53,064 --> 01:12:55,893
the last piece
Jamal Khashoggi wrote,

398
01:12:55,936 --> 01:12:57,895
filed shortly
before he was seen

399
01:12:57,938 --> 01:13:01,507
entering that Saudi consulate
in Turkey.

400
01:13:01,551 --> 01:13:04,380
Tonight, there are still
many unanswered questions

401
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:05,729
in his disappearance.

402
01:13:05,772 --> 01:13:07,905
Earlier today,
Turkish investigators

403
01:13:07,948 --> 01:13:09,602
search the residence of...

404
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:42,505
This one.

405
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:47,010
The court
has issued arrest warrants

406
01:17:47,053 --> 01:17:48,838
for two additional suspects

407
01:17:48,881 --> 01:17:50,927
in the killing
of Jamal Khashoggi.

408
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:54,757
Ahmed al-Asiri was the country's Deputy Intelligence Chief

409
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,630
and high-ranking adviser
to the Crown Prince.

410
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,851
Saud al-Qahtani
was a Royal Court Adviser

411
01:18:01,894 --> 01:18:04,810
and key counselor to Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

412
01:18:39,366 --> 01:18:41,412
The chief prosecutor
who's been holding

413
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:44,763
a joint investigation with his Saudi counterpart this week

414
01:18:44,807 --> 01:18:47,200
issued a statement
following their talks.

415
01:18:47,244 --> 01:18:50,638
He says discussions yielded
no concrete results,

416
01:18:50,682 --> 01:18:55,643
despite Turkey's intentions
to reveal the truth.

417
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,918
Sir, can you say anything
from the investigation?

418
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:10,963
Where is Khashoggi's body?

419
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,661
My name is John Scott-Railton.

420
01:19:56,704 --> 01:19:59,795
I'm a senior researcher at a place called The Citizen Lab.

421
01:20:02,885 --> 01:20:06,976
It's this group of
researchers and investigators

422
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:08,629
that try to understand

423
01:20:08,673 --> 01:20:09,805
the digital things

424
01:20:09,848 --> 01:20:12,068
that are targeting
civil society,

425
01:20:12,111 --> 01:20:16,028
so journalists,
activists, everybody really,

426
01:20:16,072 --> 01:20:19,902
who's part of what constitutes
a flourishing democracy.

427
01:20:23,079 --> 01:20:26,299
It's almost a miracle
that we found Omar.

428
01:20:26,343 --> 01:20:27,953
It's a miracle that
he survived this long.

429
01:20:30,521 --> 01:20:34,394
There's sort of a growing
global market for spyware.

430
01:20:34,438 --> 01:20:37,484
Governments want to listen
to encrypted phone calls.

431
01:20:37,528 --> 01:20:39,095
They wanna read
your WhatsApp chats,

432
01:20:39,138 --> 01:20:41,575
your Signal chats,
and they can't do it

433
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:43,490
as that chat
goes across their network.

434
01:20:43,534 --> 01:20:46,058
So, their solution to this is,
let's hack the phone.

435
01:20:46,102 --> 01:20:48,713
Was the CIA aware

436
01:20:48,756 --> 01:20:51,672
that the Saudis had purchased
spyware from Israel?

437
01:20:51,716 --> 01:20:53,544
I'm not going
to confirm or deny.

438
01:20:53,587 --> 01:20:55,981
That's either--
We're aware of certain things.

439
01:20:56,025 --> 01:20:58,984
All's I will say is that
the Saudi services

440
01:20:59,028 --> 01:21:01,944
are able to have insight
into what their citizens

441
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:05,425
or what even non-Saudi citizens
were doing

442
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:06,862
inside the Kingdom
and outside.

443
01:21:08,646 --> 01:21:10,387
Saudi Arabia is definitely

444
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:12,955
a major player in the space.

445
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:16,567
Throughout my entire career,
I focused on the top four--

446
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:19,875
Russia, China,
Iran, North Korea.

447
01:21:19,918 --> 01:21:21,833
And I think it's safe to say
that Saudi Arabia

448
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:24,618
has comparable skills
and abilities

449
01:21:24,662 --> 01:21:27,752
to conduct cyber operations.

450
01:21:27,795 --> 01:21:29,536
I think it's important
for people to understand

451
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:32,496
how easy it is
to access these tools.

452
01:21:38,371 --> 01:21:42,071
Thanks to an Israeli company called NSO,

453
01:21:42,114 --> 01:21:45,639
the Saudis have
the best hacking technology

454
01:21:45,683 --> 01:21:47,119
that money can buy.

455
01:21:48,686 --> 01:21:50,688
Pegasus Version Two.

456
01:21:54,648 --> 01:21:57,521
Pegasus is a piece of software,

457
01:21:57,564 --> 01:21:59,871
but it's also a capability,

458
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:02,656
it's the capability
to infect a phone

459
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:05,007
and turn it into a digital spy

460
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:07,357
in the pocket of the victim--

461
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,969
siphoning off private
and encrypted chats,

462
01:22:11,013 --> 01:22:12,840
photographs, messages,

463
01:22:12,884 --> 01:22:15,452
even enabling the microphone
and the camera,

464
01:22:15,495 --> 01:22:18,150
turn that phone
into a bug in a room.

465
01:22:19,891 --> 01:22:21,849
They sent a malicious link.

466
01:22:21,893 --> 01:22:24,026
The link looks legit, you know, it looks like, for example,

467
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:26,028
you know, boarding pass,

468
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:29,770
you click on it and it actually goes where it's supposed to go,

469
01:22:29,814 --> 01:22:31,598
but in between,
it's downloading something

470
01:22:31,642 --> 01:22:33,731
into your device.

471
01:22:33,774 --> 01:22:36,560
Once it compromises
mobile devices,

472
01:22:36,603 --> 01:22:38,431
the end user
of the Pegasus tool

473
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:41,391
has unfettered access
to that device.

474
01:22:44,046 --> 01:22:47,963
Think of your phone today,
the people you talk to,

475
01:22:48,006 --> 01:22:50,748
the photos you take,
the places you go,

476
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:53,577
the things that you say around and into your phone, right?

477
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:56,797
This is a huge slice
of your life.

478
01:22:56,841 --> 01:22:59,800
And that stuff
is tremendously valuable

479
01:22:59,844 --> 01:23:01,933
to somebody who wants
to monitor you,

480
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,195
who wants to figure out
what you're doing

481
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:04,631
and maybe who wants to subvert

482
01:23:04,675 --> 01:23:07,286
your political activity.

483
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:11,421
Once Pegasus takes control
of a phone, it's game over.

484
01:23:30,048 --> 01:23:32,703
To share information, an infected device

485
01:23:32,746 --> 01:23:36,576
is gonna be talking to
the servers that control it.

486
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:39,492
It has to phone home.

487
01:23:39,536 --> 01:23:42,104
And so we had developed
a technique

488
01:23:42,147 --> 01:23:46,630
to see what networks
might have infected devices.

489
01:23:47,979 --> 01:23:49,285
So, what we found in Montreal

490
01:23:49,328 --> 01:23:50,895
in December 2018

491
01:23:50,938 --> 01:23:53,289
is that there appeared
to be a device

492
01:23:53,332 --> 01:23:55,465
in the University Network
phoning home

493
01:23:55,508 --> 01:23:57,771
to a cluster of servers
that belonged

494
01:23:57,815 --> 01:24:00,339
to Saudi Arabia's
Pegasus deployment.

495
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,897
So, we go to Montreal, we sit with Omar

496
01:24:36,941 --> 01:24:41,032
and actually find
the message on Omar's phone

497
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,426
that we believe led
to that infection.

498
01:24:43,469 --> 01:24:46,646
It looks like a DHL
shipping tracking notification.

499
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:48,561
Only it isn't.

500
01:28:58,245 --> 01:29:01,597
Are you being allowed in?
Are the Saudis allowing you in?

501
01:29:18,527 --> 01:29:21,138
Some of the tape
recordings we've heard

502
01:29:21,181 --> 01:29:22,835
preceded the killing.

503
01:29:41,071 --> 01:29:42,768
"Joints will be separated.

504
01:29:42,812 --> 01:29:44,640
"It's not a problem.

505
01:30:56,973 --> 01:30:59,497
The conversation turns to,

506
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:02,457
"Will you come back
to Saudi Arabia?"

507
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:44,455
The fear is escalating
in his voice.

508
01:31:54,596 --> 01:31:56,685
Then we hear a struggle.

509
01:32:34,723 --> 01:32:36,812
You can hear the other people

510
01:33:05,405 --> 01:33:10,193
The most difficult part
of those recordings

511
01:33:44,706 --> 01:33:48,231
I was thinking, when
he entered his consulate...

512
01:35:14,099 --> 01:35:16,754
The king firmly denied
any knowledge of it.

513
01:35:16,798 --> 01:35:18,669
I don't wanna get
into his mind.

514
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,540
But it sounded to me like

515
01:35:20,584 --> 01:35:24,283
maybe these could have been
rogue killers. Who knows?

516
01:35:27,243 --> 01:35:29,462
World leaders are
gathering in Saudi Arabia

517
01:35:29,506 --> 01:35:32,683
for a summit commonly known
as "Davos in the desert."

518
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,772
A couple weeks
after the murder,

519
01:35:34,816 --> 01:35:37,732
there was a big, important
conference for Saudi Arabia.

520
01:35:37,775 --> 01:35:41,605
Davos in the desert is supposed to promote Saudi Crown Prince,

521
01:35:41,648 --> 01:35:45,217
Mohammed bin Salman's reform vision for the Kingdom.

522
01:35:45,261 --> 01:35:48,525
Davos in the desert is the make or break part of Vision 2030.

523
01:35:50,135 --> 01:35:53,748
But it ended up being
a fiasco for MBS.

524
01:35:59,492 --> 01:36:03,496
The Jamal story

525
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:05,542
galvanized public attention

526
01:36:05,585 --> 01:36:08,153
in the United States,
around the world.

527
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:16,205
It may destroy MBS' hopes
for modernizing the Kingdom

528
01:36:16,248 --> 01:36:18,163
because he needs investors,

529
01:36:18,207 --> 01:36:20,470
he needs people who invest
in the Kingdom.

530
01:36:20,513 --> 01:36:23,560
And right now,
he has become toxic.

531
01:36:25,605 --> 01:36:27,607
As pressure on Saudi mounts,

532
01:36:27,651 --> 01:36:30,785
several U.S. media organizationsand business leaders

533
01:36:30,828 --> 01:36:34,745
have pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh.

534
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:36,312
The conference happens,

535
01:36:36,355 --> 01:36:39,054
all those important guests
eventually don't go.

536
01:36:39,097 --> 01:36:43,623
Jeff Bezos was supposed
to be a secret guest.

537
01:36:43,667 --> 01:36:47,453
Bezos is someone with a direct relationship with MBS.

538
01:36:47,497 --> 01:36:50,543
They messaged each other.

539
01:36:50,587 --> 01:36:52,328
They talked about business.
They talked about, you know,

540
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:55,374
all the great things
they're gonna do together.

541
01:36:55,418 --> 01:36:56,767
And he was supposed to declare

542
01:36:56,811 --> 01:37:00,727
this enormous deal
at this conference.

543
01:37:00,771 --> 01:37:02,164
But after the murder,

544
01:37:02,207 --> 01:37:06,168
Bezos just stopped
all contact with MBS.

545
01:37:06,211 --> 01:37:07,734
Bezos owns
The Washington Post,

546
01:37:07,778 --> 01:37:10,563
which means that
Jamal worked for him.

547
01:37:10,607 --> 01:37:15,090
It seemed that MBS expected
Bezos to say, "You know what?

548
01:37:15,133 --> 01:37:16,656
"I control this newspaper

549
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:18,310
and I can curb them.
I can tell them,

550
01:37:18,354 --> 01:37:20,225
you know, don't make
a big deal about this."

551
01:37:20,269 --> 01:37:23,315
But when push came to shove,
Bezos did not interfere

552
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:26,710
whenThe Washington Post
started a whole campaign.

553
01:37:26,753 --> 01:37:28,625
"Justice for Jamal".

554
01:37:30,061 --> 01:37:32,759
MBS saw that as betrayal.

555
01:37:34,152 --> 01:37:36,676
After Davos in the desert,

556
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,069
we have evidence

557
01:37:38,113 --> 01:37:39,941
that Jeff Bezos' phone

558
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:43,945
had been infected
with malware.

559
01:37:43,988 --> 01:37:47,600
And the way in which
that technology was delivered

560
01:37:47,644 --> 01:37:49,341
to his phone was through a text

561
01:37:49,385 --> 01:37:52,649
from the Crown Prince himself.

562
01:37:54,303 --> 01:37:56,696
I am the United Nations
Special Rapporteur

563
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:59,351
on Freedom of Opinion
and Expression.

564
01:37:59,395 --> 01:38:03,268
The work that I've been doing
over the last 18 months or so

565
01:38:03,312 --> 01:38:05,618
is on the private
surveillance industry.

566
01:38:10,797 --> 01:38:13,757
A video was sent in 2018

567
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,759
from MBS' WhatsApp account

568
01:38:15,802 --> 01:38:17,543
to Jeff Bezos' phone.

569
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:21,721
Then we see
this massive increase

570
01:38:21,765 --> 01:38:25,334
in data leaving the phone.

571
01:38:25,377 --> 01:38:27,031
It was only after

572
01:38:27,075 --> 01:38:28,946
the killing of Jamal Khashoggi

573
01:38:28,990 --> 01:38:31,775
thatThe Washington Post
was an important target

574
01:38:31,818 --> 01:38:34,169
for Saudi Arabia.

575
01:38:34,212 --> 01:38:38,303
This was exactly the moment
whenThe National Enquirer

576
01:38:38,347 --> 01:38:40,523
was saying to Bezos,

577
01:38:40,566 --> 01:38:44,440
"We have evidence
connecting you to an affair."

578
01:38:45,745 --> 01:38:49,271
So Bezos' security team
is learning

579
01:38:49,314 --> 01:38:51,403
that his phone
may have been compromised.

580
01:38:51,447 --> 01:38:53,057
But at the same time,

581
01:38:53,101 --> 01:38:56,017
Bezos is getting
WhatsApp messages

582
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:57,932
from MBS that are strange.

583
01:38:59,716 --> 01:39:01,761
Essentially,
"Whatever you're hearing

584
01:39:01,805 --> 01:39:05,461
about Saudi involvement
in this is not true."

585
01:39:05,504 --> 01:39:08,420
In order to send
those kinds of text messages,

586
01:39:08,464 --> 01:39:09,944
MBS has to know

587
01:39:09,987 --> 01:39:13,164
what Bezos is learning
about Saudi involvement.

588
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:16,515
And then what we see is that

589
01:39:16,559 --> 01:39:19,475
there's this massive
Saudi online campaign,

590
01:39:19,518 --> 01:39:20,737
a Twitter campaign,

591
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:22,652
against Jeff Bezos.

592
01:39:24,219 --> 01:39:25,698
The intention
was to humiliate

593
01:39:25,742 --> 01:39:28,005
and to punish Bezos.

594
01:39:28,049 --> 01:39:31,878
It was exactly the same thing
that they did to Jamal.

595
01:39:34,577 --> 01:39:37,362
That mere fact that
MBS has the reach

596
01:39:37,406 --> 01:39:41,584
to conduct surveillance on the richest man in the world

597
01:39:41,627 --> 01:39:44,021
is not only striking,
but it's scary.

598
01:39:46,893 --> 01:39:49,809
Earlier today, CIA Director,
Gina Haspel briefed

599
01:39:49,853 --> 01:39:52,638
a select group of high ranking senators on the killing

600
01:39:52,682 --> 01:39:55,467
ofWashington Post columnist,
Jamal Khashoggi.

601
01:39:55,511 --> 01:39:58,514
The CIA Director, Gina Haspel met with the Turks

602
01:39:58,557 --> 01:40:02,083
and said, "Show me the audio.
Let me hear it."

603
01:40:03,649 --> 01:40:06,435
The CIA Director's job is to present the information

604
01:40:06,478 --> 01:40:10,091
to a policymaker so they can
make a decision on how to act.

605
01:40:10,134 --> 01:40:11,918
This assessment was different.

606
01:40:11,962 --> 01:40:15,183
If the Crown Prince
went in front of a jury,

607
01:40:15,226 --> 01:40:17,576
he would be convicted
in 30 minutes.

608
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:19,404
Yes.

609
01:40:19,448 --> 01:40:22,103
They're buying hundreds
of billions of dollars' worth

610
01:40:22,146 --> 01:40:23,843
of things from this country.

611
01:40:23,887 --> 01:40:26,542
I'm not gonna destroy
the economy for our country

612
01:40:26,585 --> 01:40:29,066
by being foolish
with Saudi Arabia, so...

613
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:31,851
There's not a smoking gun,
there's a smoking saw.

614
01:40:31,895 --> 01:40:33,462
You have to be willfully blind

615
01:40:33,505 --> 01:40:36,856
not to come to the conclusionthat this was orchestrated

616
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:42,079
and organized by people in--
under the command of MBS.

617
01:40:42,123 --> 01:40:43,472
Did MBS lie to you, sir?

618
01:40:43,515 --> 01:40:45,561
He told me thathe had nothing to do with it.

619
01:40:45,604 --> 01:40:48,085
- But what if he's lying?-As recently as a few days ago.

620
01:40:48,129 --> 01:40:50,740
Did you just live with it
because you need him?

621
01:40:50,783 --> 01:40:52,959
Well, will anybody
really know, all right?

622
01:40:53,003 --> 01:40:54,352
Will anybody really know?

623
01:40:54,396 --> 01:40:55,832
I have not seen,

624
01:40:55,875 --> 01:40:58,182
in 20 years
covering intelligence,

625
01:40:58,226 --> 01:41:02,186
the conclusion from the CIA
that is this confident

626
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:05,276
about the role
of one person in an act.

627
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,496
Everybody
but the President agrees

628
01:41:07,539 --> 01:41:09,063
that Mohammed bin Salman
ordered

629
01:41:09,106 --> 01:41:11,021
Jamal Khashoggi's
assassination.

630
01:42:39,892 --> 01:42:42,808
Nine, eight, seven...

631
01:43:06,136 --> 01:43:08,182
The first day they broadcast,

632
01:43:08,225 --> 01:43:12,447
Jamal invites Shiite dissidents on the air,

633
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:16,277
who were the people who the Bahrainian authorities most feared.

634
01:45:16,397 --> 01:45:17,702
Are we so blind

635
01:45:17,746 --> 01:45:20,052
to the malign influence
of Saudi Arabia

636
01:45:20,096 --> 01:45:21,924
that we just give
money and weapons

637
01:45:21,967 --> 01:45:24,840
to anybody regardless
of what they do?

638
01:45:24,883 --> 01:45:28,365
You can cut a dissident
into pieces with a bone saw

639
01:45:28,409 --> 01:45:30,498
and we'll
still give you weapons?

640
01:47:25,874 --> 01:47:27,092
Thank you.

641
01:47:27,136 --> 01:47:29,530
I now give the floor
to Saudi Arabia.

642
01:47:32,097 --> 01:47:33,359
Thank you.

643
01:47:33,403 --> 01:47:35,361
Accusations have been launched

644
01:47:35,405 --> 01:47:38,147
and fingers have been pointed,

645
01:47:38,190 --> 01:47:42,760
we reject any attempt
to remove this

646
01:47:42,804 --> 01:47:45,459
from our national justice
system in Saudi Arabia

647
01:47:45,502 --> 01:47:47,330
in respect to the form
that that may take.

648
01:47:47,373 --> 01:47:48,810
Many thanks.

649
01:48:11,833 --> 01:48:14,575
Did you order
the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?

650
01:48:15,924 --> 01:48:17,839
Absolutely not.

651
01:48:17,882 --> 01:48:19,623
Some think that I should know

652
01:48:19,667 --> 01:48:21,146
what three million
people working

653
01:48:21,190 --> 01:48:23,714
for the Saudi government
do daily?

654
01:48:23,758 --> 01:48:25,455
Absolutely not.

655
01:48:29,415 --> 01:48:32,331
My name is Hatice Cengiz.

656
01:48:32,375 --> 01:48:34,943
I'm addressing you
as a victim,

657
01:48:34,986 --> 01:48:39,730
a title forced on me after
the brutal murder of my Jamal.

658
01:48:42,211 --> 01:48:47,216
Jamal and I would have been
husband and wife by now.

659
01:48:51,437 --> 01:48:55,964
The failure to punish Jamal's
murderers affects us all.

660
01:48:57,618 --> 01:49:02,231
But also democracy,
human rights, and freedom.

661
01:49:04,494 --> 01:49:09,238
Mr. Chair,
the truth always wins.

662
01:49:09,281 --> 01:49:11,588
History will take note.

663
01:49:11,632 --> 01:49:14,678
Please take action.
Thank you.

664
01:52:16,251 --> 01:52:19,036
Hatice, you paced that street

665
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:21,822
and waiting for hours.

666
01:52:21,865 --> 01:52:26,391
No one should ever have
to endure what you did.

667
01:52:26,435 --> 01:52:28,350
We are here

668
01:52:28,393 --> 01:52:30,004
and you are not alone.

668
01:52:31,305 --> 01:53:31,278
