00:01:55,878 --> 00:01:57,245
Long day ahead.

3
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:12,655
Aileen?

4
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:15,058
Thanks, love.

5
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:20,997
More like
donkeys broken in, Mary.

6
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,399
Fuck's sake, like,
we could have been anything.

7
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:29,337
Teachers, nurses, hairdressers.

8
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:33,976
Hairdressers?
Don't be so ambitious, Sarah.

9
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,680
Did you not just hear her calling
us donkeys? Actual asses, like.

10
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:40,315
But what an arse, Sheila, girl.

11
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:00,302
My son!

12
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:02,304
No!

13
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,474
No!

14
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:08,611
Mark!

15
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:55,151
If I do nothing else, I'm teaching
this little fecker how to swim.

16
00:05:55,184 --> 00:05:56,552
Erin.

17
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:58,087
Jesus Christ, girl.

18
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,989
Yera...

19
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:01,924
for fuck's sake.
They literally live on the water

20
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,159
and none of them learn how.

21
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:05,127
You know
it's the tradition, Erin.

22
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:07,864
What, it's bad luck to know?

23
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:11,868
If they can't swim, they won't
jump in and help anyone else.

24
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:14,770
Pack of selfish wankers, too
worried about their own skins.

25
00:06:14,804 --> 00:06:17,006
What's wrong, Oscar, love?

26
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:20,910
Wakes up crying three,
four times a night.

27
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:23,880
- Disaster, like.
- Jesus Christ, I remember nights with you.

28
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:25,648
Could never sleep.

29
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:28,017
Con telling me
I just had to let you cry.

30
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,151
How could I do that?

31
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:32,188
Hearing every noise.

32
00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:34,523
You were the easier child,
to be fair.

33
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,995
How's it going?
I haven't see you in a while.

34
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:14,030
How's things?

35
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:16,699
Good to see you.

36
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:19,168
Hi, Dan.

37
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:21,103
Brian O'Hara? What the hell
are you doing here?

38
00:07:21,137 --> 00:07:22,672
Jesus Christ, the size of you.

39
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:23,806
The stronger you get...
Come here.

40
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,975
We're all wider
and wiser by the look Dan boy.

41
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:28,210
- After a while.
- Well boy, how's things?

42
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:33,616
Brian.

43
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:37,019
Christ, Brian...

44
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,727
Mom, look at you, huh.

45
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,697
Your hair. You haven't changed a bit.

46
00:07:51,534 --> 00:07:52,735
Who's this, huh?

47
00:07:54,236 --> 00:07:55,604
It's my baby brother, is it?

48
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:57,740
What! No, no, no.
Jesus Christ.

49
00:07:57,773 --> 00:07:59,008
Oh, come here to me.

50
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,544
Oh.

51
00:08:01,577 --> 00:08:02,945
Well, Paddy, how's things?

52
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:04,981
You son of a bitch.

53
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:07,083
- Brian!
- Erin!

54
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:09,251
What the fuck!
What are you doing here?

55
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:11,053
It's 'bout time
I came back, isn't it?

56
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:15,691
- Sarah.
- Brian.

57
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:18,527
It takes Mark Fitz dying
for you to come back to us, does it?

58
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:20,096
What?

59
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:23,498
That's who this is for?

60
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,202
Ah, fuck me, it is.

61
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:29,805
I'm so sorry.

62
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:35,277
Just give me one second.

63
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:38,914
Mary, um...

64
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,585
I'm so sorry, Mary.

65
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:44,587
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

66
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,803
How long has Paddy
been like this?

67
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:04,840
A good few years now
at this stage.

68
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:09,045
- Must be weird being back.
- Hmm.

69
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:10,846
Probably the exact fuckin' same,
though, is it?

70
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:14,984
Does she ever stop going?

71
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:17,753
Oh, not a second
all the time you were gone.

72
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:21,791
One minute, love.

73
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:31,333
That dad, is it?

74
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:34,236
You should go out and meet him.
He'd like that.

75
00:09:35,204 --> 00:09:36,205
Go on.

76
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,022
- You good?
- Oh yeah, yeah.

77
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:00,396
Strange seeing them shake hands.

78
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:03,999
He's different,
isn't he? Grown into himself.

79
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:05,835
Do you reckon?

80
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:09,171
A mother knows.

81
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,348
The look on your face.

82
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,952
- Don't be so shocked, mate.
- What?

83
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:27,223
- Has she fed you?
- Uh, no. Not yet.

84
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:31,660
Hard to believe he's home, huh?

85
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:35,164
Good to be home now, all right.

86
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:41,103
So, you're in Australia.

87
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:44,273
Not been in touch
with us in how long?

88
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:47,977
And you get a notion,
all of a sudden, to come home.

89
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,748
Shit weather, fuck all work,
and not tell anyone?

90
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:56,452
Yeah. That's about
the size of it, yeah.

91
00:10:56,485 --> 00:10:58,921
Come on, why are you back, like?

92
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:02,158
Uh...

93
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,160
Paddy's oysters.

94
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:11,167
Christ. Oh, you be starting from
nothing again. Have you money saved?

95
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:14,870
Oysters take work.
They aren't cheap.

96
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,307
But we still have
the license for it.

97
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:21,076
I kept up the payments.

98
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:25,114
Every year
since Con gave up on it.

99
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:28,350
Just in case.

100
00:11:56,912 --> 00:12:00,249
- Tilt it forward.
- Okay.

101
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:03,986
- Is it that way?
- Yes.

102
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,454
- That all right?
- Yeah.

103
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,024
I see you looked after it.

104
00:13:16,158 --> 00:13:18,427
My father
wasn't able for it anymore,

105
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:22,965
and you were gone
and stayed gone.

106
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:25,034
That was that. No other option.

107
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:28,837
Didn't want to work it
with anyone else.

108
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:33,610
Jesus Christ, it's unreal.

109
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:35,911
Ground's a bit soft in parts.

110
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:38,047
You'll have to replace
some of your trestles.

111
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,215
Find a supplier
for your oysters and bags.

112
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:43,586
Start with seeds
or half-growns, then.

113
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,156
Be a year at least
before they mature, turn profit.

114
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:48,857
You'll have to find
another income.

115
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:53,095
But you know that yourself.

116
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:55,964
That's nothing you can't
manage, though, Brian. Is it?

117
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:58,334
Not a bother.
For fuck's sake.

118
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:53,956
Oh, sorry, Aileen.
Forgot to clock out.

119
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:56,925
- Just give me a minute.
- No rush, love.

120
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:15,944
Fine looking oysters.
Thanks, Francie.

121
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:18,347
Be some craic if they caught us.

122
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,349
Oh, don't say that to me.

123
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:23,952
Hurry up will you. Come on.

124
00:15:23,986 --> 00:15:25,254
I'm waiting on you, Mom.

125
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:33,630
- See you for dinner, yeah?
- Go on, aye, go away.

126
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:43,972
Be safe.

127
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:44,501
Hup!

128
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:10,459
Thank you, guys.

129
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:17,667
Hi, boy, how're things?

130
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,572
There you are.

131
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:27,409
Here, take some of this. Go on.

132
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:29,244
C'mon. Give us a song.

133
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:30,613
- Go on.
- Thanks, Mom.

134
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,749
- There you go, Dan.
- Okay, all right. I'll do one for you.

135
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:11,253
What about Australia?

136
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:17,326
- What was your favorite place down there?
- Hmm.

137
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:22,197
You'd be surprised
how little I saw of it, Aileen.

138
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,770
If I'd known where you were,
I'd have gone and visited you.

139
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:33,108
That would have
been nice all right, but...

140
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:35,845
you didn't miss much.

141
00:18:39,114 --> 00:18:43,418
Besides, it's the best thing
in the world being back here...

142
00:18:44,353 --> 00:18:45,888
with you.

143
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:21,658
- Where you off to?
- Could I get another, Dan?

144
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:24,459
- I'm going for a smoke.
- No, no, no. You're not going anywhere.

145
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:26,294
- We've gotta go home.
- No. I don't want to go home.

146
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:28,296
- I don't care.
- I don't want to go home yet.

147
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:37,907
Mary, huh?

148
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,174
- No.
- Come on.

149
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:50,653
I'm telling you
the count is low.

150
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:51,854
Count them again.

151
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:53,923
I counted them twice.
There aren't enough bags.

152
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:55,457
You telling me
how to do my job, Francie?

153
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,491
Someone's trying to cheat me.

154
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:58,260
Is it going to come out
of your fucking wages?

155
00:19:58,293 --> 00:19:59,862
Listen, I'm only
giving you what you asked for.

156
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:01,263
Oh, hold on. You're
saying it has to do with me!

157
00:20:01,296 --> 00:20:04,399
- It's my fault now, is it?
- Hey, hey, what's the story here, lads?

158
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:05,768
This little bitch
is trying to cheat me.

159
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:07,503
Fuck off, Francie.

160
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:09,371
There isn't
near enough bags there.

161
00:20:09,404 --> 00:20:10,740
Where's the rest
of my fuckin' half-growns?

162
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:13,676
I'm sure they're all there. You
filled them right, didn't you?

163
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,310
Can't imagine
how I couldn't have.

164
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:17,513
I split them the exact same way
as I did last time, like.

165
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:20,817
Cause you're a moron,
that's why. Is Dennis here?

166
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,552
I haven't seen him yet, no.

167
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:31,994
It's an easy mistake to make,
girl. Go on away quick.

168
00:20:52,314 --> 00:20:53,883
It's crazy inside there,
isn't it?

169
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:06,929
Shame you and Francie had to
go home early on us the other night.

170
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:13,335
I've been taking space, and
he's not been happy about it.

171
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:20,076
Wiped my hands of him
after the last night.

172
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:23,646
But here I am crying my eyes out
as if he's the one who broke my heart.

173
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:27,382
Can't help it, though.

174
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:33,589
Take your time with it.

175
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:45,034
I've been back in my parents'
house a couple of nights.

176
00:21:51,507 --> 00:21:53,976
Time puts it all
into perspective very quickly.

177
00:21:58,581 --> 00:22:00,082
He was brutal with his words.

178
00:22:07,489 --> 00:22:09,859
Still, though, he's just
like anyone else really.

179
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:14,530
We're all God's creatures
in the dark.

180
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:48,691
That's four salmon.

181
00:23:58,501 --> 00:23:59,635
Two hundred to you.

182
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:01,570
Good man.

183
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:09,612
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

184
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:36,906
How's work going, Con?

185
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:43,546
Ah, coining it, I suppose.

186
00:24:44,747 --> 00:24:46,115
Where's this come from?

187
00:24:54,223 --> 00:24:58,294
You think you're a hard man,
do you? Fighting the system.

188
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:00,563
Poaching alone,
as if you didn't know better.

189
00:25:00,596 --> 00:25:02,798
It's nothing you didn't do
back in the day, Con.

190
00:25:02,832 --> 00:25:05,201
I never went out
on spring tides.

191
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:06,936
Sure Mark died
doing the same thing.

192
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:12,108
And that's either what will happen
to you eventually, or you'll be caught.

193
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:15,544
All points to the same end,
like. Stupidity.

194
00:25:15,578 --> 00:25:17,913
Jesus Christ, lighten up, mate.

195
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:21,617
The bags she stole for you
weren't enough, no?

196
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,087
You lasted all of about how long
making an honest go of the oysters?

197
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:27,289
Longer than I reckoned anyway.
Fair play to you.

198
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:29,325
You keep telling me
what I can and can't do,

199
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:31,927
but I'm keeping
Paddy's farm going.

200
00:25:31,961 --> 00:25:34,864
Your father's only trying to say that
you don't have to take such a risk.

201
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:43,039
Thanks for that, Mom.

202
00:26:50,806 --> 00:26:53,175
What's the story here, lad?

203
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:55,678
Checking if there isn't anything
I can make use of.

204
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:00,616
Christ, things are
that bad, are they?

205
00:27:02,017 --> 00:27:03,119
You're like a rat.

206
00:27:04,854 --> 00:27:06,622
Most of this is my old shite.

207
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,126
It's long past being any use.

208
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,795
Invest in a few new things
for yourself.

209
00:27:12,828 --> 00:27:14,663
Give yourself
a chance anyway, boy.

210
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:19,001
Tell us, what...
what are you doing tomorrow?

211
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:21,370
Uh...

212
00:27:21,403 --> 00:27:23,339
head out in the evening
after the tide, I'd say.

213
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:26,675
So, you're free
in the morning, I take it?

214
00:27:29,378 --> 00:27:32,014
Could have a job for you.

215
00:27:32,047 --> 00:27:35,184
I mean, use these away sure and
I could pay you a bit extra on top.

216
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:40,656
It's tough, isn't it...

217
00:27:42,158 --> 00:27:43,225
doin' it by yourself?

218
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:47,229
It's too much, really,
for one man.

219
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:52,301
It's the lesson
your father learned.

220
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,042
These would fit Brian,
would they?

221
00:29:15,084 --> 00:29:16,352
Are you all right, Mary?

222
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:24,059
I keep thinking I hear Mark
when I'm here alone.

223
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:28,264
A sound at night...

224
00:29:29,832 --> 00:29:31,967
and it might be him
moving around the place.

225
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:37,139
Strange comfort.

226
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:58,327
Thanks, love.

227
00:31:01,457 --> 00:31:03,526
Brian, come out
the fuck. Can you hurry up?

228
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,281
Oh.

229
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:29,885
Oh.

230
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,892
Got to keep an eye
on the tide, mate.

231
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,508
Some morning out there,
Paddy Boy.

232
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:34,349
Everything supposedly shifts,
but...

233
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:39,321
it's exactly like it was when
you, me, and Con were workin' it.

234
00:32:48,363 --> 00:32:50,600
Drinking cold tea
out of a 7UP bottle

235
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:52,334
on a clear day,
there's nothing like it.

236
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:01,376
Are you there at all?

237
00:33:10,252 --> 00:33:11,420
Shit...

238
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:15,625
Fuck...

239
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,229
Dick, bollocks, arse.

240
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,743
You didn't say anything?

241
00:33:33,776 --> 00:33:35,645
I didn't tell him nothing, no.

242
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:38,581
Nine months later, this fella.

243
00:33:41,316 --> 00:33:43,352
He's a needy little fecker.

244
00:33:43,385 --> 00:33:47,456
The usual family traits.
Boys being boys.

245
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:49,258
Stuck to their mother's tit.

246
00:33:54,229 --> 00:33:55,632
Lookin' very smart.

247
00:33:56,699 --> 00:33:58,768
Do you want
to come down with us?

248
00:33:58,801 --> 00:34:00,637
I should head home.

249
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,071
We've an early one
in the morning.

250
00:34:03,105 --> 00:34:05,708
Heading up the country
for a few days.

251
00:34:05,742 --> 00:34:08,410
Show the small man
there's more to the world.

252
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:10,613
Come on.
Let's go show you off.

253
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:16,218
Oh.

254
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:28,865
I... I don't know.

255
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:31,568
- Christmas jumper.
- Christmas jumper, that's the one.

256
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,704
Okay, um...

257
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:38,473
you could go
anywhere in the world.

258
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:40,242
No conditions.
Where would you go?

259
00:34:42,277 --> 00:34:43,412
Do you know what...

260
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:48,785
I'd rather just...
reel the years back in...

261
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:51,588
and sit you and your father
down and make ye act like adults.

262
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,531
It's nice imagining you getting
along, living under the one roof.

263
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,173
But I'm proud the way
you are now, though.

264
00:35:11,206 --> 00:35:13,576
It's as if the work itself was
the beginning and the end of it.

265
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:16,679
Hey, Dan.

266
00:35:16,713 --> 00:35:19,314
- Hey, Sarah.
- Can I get a whiskey, please?

267
00:35:19,348 --> 00:35:20,583
You can, of course. Yeah.

268
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,320
Did you want another drink?

269
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:29,324
No. No, stay there.
I'll get it, all right.

270
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:37,332
Let me get you this.

271
00:35:37,366 --> 00:35:40,302
Oh, you're grand.
Thanks, though.

272
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:49,311
You out for the night?

273
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:50,913
We'll see now after this one.

274
00:35:50,947 --> 00:35:52,147
Mmm-hmm.

275
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:58,621
I can't believe
you're still here, to be honest.

276
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:03,258
I thought you would have
long abandoned this place.

277
00:36:05,427 --> 00:36:06,696
I don't know
why you'd think that.

278
00:36:08,463 --> 00:36:10,332
Everything I ever needed
was here.

279
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:13,201
Didn't have to go
looking for it.

280
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:15,505
Hmm.

281
00:36:19,374 --> 00:36:20,409
Like what?

282
00:36:24,514 --> 00:36:27,517
Nah. We used to have a good craic
together when we were younger, didn't we?

283
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:30,285
- Us?
- Mmm-hmm.

284
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,723
It was so long ago.

285
00:36:35,424 --> 00:36:37,325
I wouldn't get hung up on it
if I were you.

286
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,497
What are you drinking?

287
00:36:44,901 --> 00:36:47,570
Go on sure, surprise me.

288
00:36:52,508 --> 00:36:55,410
I, um... two of the same again.

289
00:36:55,444 --> 00:36:57,379
- Uh, she's having whiskey, is she?
- Mmm-hmm.

290
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:02,217
There you go.

291
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:05,487
There's...

292
00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:14,664
What time is low tide due?

293
00:37:15,464 --> 00:37:16,532
Go on, will you?

294
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:19,669
All right. Night, pet.

295
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:21,804
Good night.

296
00:37:37,954 --> 00:37:40,523
I might borrow that top
off you one of the nights, Aileen.

297
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:43,626
I'll see you tomorrow, girl.

298
00:39:25,161 --> 00:39:26,562
Sorry, lads.

299
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:33,669
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

300
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:53,789
Were you out last night?

301
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:56,626
No, no.
I was not. Were you out?

302
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:33,596
Good night so, was it?

303
00:41:08,064 --> 00:41:10,566
Mary, look.

304
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:14,203
- Look at that.
- Stop the belt. Aileen.

305
00:41:18,307 --> 00:41:20,910
- Fungus.
- Shit.

306
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:25,982
We've got fungus, too.

307
00:41:27,016 --> 00:41:28,217
Let me see that!

308
00:41:31,087 --> 00:41:33,589
Check the rest of the stock.

309
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:34,857
Throw these ones out.

310
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:38,260
Fuck's sake!
What a disaster.

311
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:48,004
Jesus!

312
00:41:51,307 --> 00:41:53,009
- Sarah?
- Don't touch me.

313
00:42:14,196 --> 00:42:15,631
You are hereby warned

314
00:42:15,664 --> 00:42:18,034
to cease cultivation
of all oyster holdings

315
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:19,503
until further notice,

316
00:42:19,535 --> 00:42:23,906
punishable by loss of license if
caught in breach of the moratorium.

317
00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:27,576
Any oysters you harvested today
must be destroyed.

318
00:42:38,754 --> 00:42:39,955
Do you have any work for me?

319
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:42,825
No, I'm not gonna
need you again for a while, no.

320
00:42:42,858 --> 00:42:44,994
Keep your head down like
the rest of 'em, you'll be grand.

321
00:42:45,027 --> 00:42:46,695
I'll take what you owe me, so.

322
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:54,937
All right, lads,
let's throw them all out. Yeah.

323
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,005
- What are we supposed to do now, like?
- Oh.

324
00:44:03,038 --> 00:44:05,307
Same thing happened,
about seven or eight years ago, didn't it?

325
00:44:05,341 --> 00:44:06,742
Nearly destroyed
the oyster farmers.

326
00:44:06,775 --> 00:44:09,445
The idea of them at home
doing nothing. No good for anyone.

327
00:44:09,478 --> 00:44:12,348
It seems to be gotten
worse and worse for her, doesn't it?

328
00:44:12,915 --> 00:44:14,116
Poor cratur.

329
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:18,420
She didn't mean to bite at you.

330
00:44:20,122 --> 00:44:23,659
If Francie's done something,
she needs to speak up about it.

331
00:44:51,854 --> 00:44:53,255
- Hey, love.
- Hiya.

332
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,359
Are you busy?

333
00:44:57,393 --> 00:45:02,131
Not a great time, no. I'm just
doing a few jobs on the house.

334
00:45:02,164 --> 00:45:05,000
Mom says they haven't seen you
in the factory in a few days.

335
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:08,337
The smell's finally
getting to you, is it?

336
00:45:09,438 --> 00:45:10,439
No.

337
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:17,179
What's after happening, girl?

338
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:23,219
I'm here, you know.

339
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:28,724
If you need anything. Yeah?

340
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:33,028
Yeah.

341
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:40,002
I'll let you get back to it.

342
00:45:43,038 --> 00:45:44,039
Thanks.

343
00:47:58,641 --> 00:47:59,875
Hello?

344
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:03,312
Aileen.

345
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:23,600
Aileen. How are things? Hey, you
might follow me through here now.

346
00:48:27,002 --> 00:48:28,538
We're just in here now, look.

347
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:42,284
How's Con gettin' on?

348
00:48:44,486 --> 00:48:46,623
Where's Brian, Mike?

349
00:48:46,656 --> 00:48:49,091
Sorry to drag you
all the way into town.

350
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,463
You must be delighted to have
Brian back in the house with you.

351
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:56,231
Sure, you know yourself.

352
00:48:56,265 --> 00:48:57,299
Do you reckon?

353
00:48:57,332 --> 00:48:59,368
God knows if my girls
moved back into the house,

354
00:48:59,401 --> 00:49:01,136
we'd be tearing strips
off each other.

355
00:49:02,137 --> 00:49:03,706
Australia he was, was it?

356
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,874
Australia, yeah.

357
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:08,444
Isn't that always the way?
Breaking his mother's heart.

358
00:49:10,312 --> 00:49:11,380
Exactly.

359
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:15,184
Look, there's been a claim made

360
00:49:15,217 --> 00:49:18,588
about an assault in the village
a couple of weeks back

361
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:21,423
by a young woman
who was in Dan Nell's pub

362
00:49:21,457 --> 00:49:24,460
on the night
of the 18th of April.

363
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:27,496
Brian says he was at home
with you that night.

364
00:49:28,297 --> 00:49:29,364
Is that right?

365
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:33,368
He was, yeah.

366
00:49:33,402 --> 00:49:36,773
- He didn't go out or anything at any stage...
- No. No.

367
00:49:36,806 --> 00:49:40,075
And you'd say that again
in court?

368
00:49:40,108 --> 00:49:41,276
I would. Yeah.

369
00:49:43,479 --> 00:49:48,250
All right. Look, I know, well,
Brian's a hard-workin' fella.

370
00:49:48,283 --> 00:49:49,384
Is that it?

371
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:52,254
I'll give him a shout
for you there now. One minute.

372
00:49:53,355 --> 00:49:54,824
It's a bit much, Mike, isn't it,

373
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:58,093
to drag me out in the middle of the
night just to ask a simple question?

374
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:00,128
We've to be seen to be
doing our job, Aileen.

375
00:50:49,278 --> 00:50:50,412
Are you all right?

376
00:50:52,447 --> 00:50:56,318
Huh. Need to go for a few pints.

377
00:50:56,351 --> 00:50:58,521
My van is on the way back.
We might pick it up.

378
00:51:07,229 --> 00:51:09,532
Was there anyone else out,
do you remember?

379
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:13,803
I couldn't tell you.

380
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:28,618
What happened after I left you?

381
00:51:29,752 --> 00:51:31,219
We had a few drinks.

382
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:35,290
Nothing we didn't do
back in the day.

383
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:40,395
What does that mean?

384
00:51:44,232 --> 00:51:45,267
Jesus Christ...

385
00:51:49,338 --> 00:51:51,741
Am I better off going back
to fucking Australia?

386
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:56,311
Is that it? Getting dragged
into this shit.

387
00:51:58,681 --> 00:52:00,683
You're not going
anywhere, all right?

388
00:52:02,317 --> 00:52:03,385
Do you hear me?

389
00:52:31,514 --> 00:52:32,515
Thanks, Mom.

390
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:52,635
The moratorium
won't last, is the point.

391
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,637
In a couple of weeks,
the water will cool,

392
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,272
all will magically reset.

393
00:52:57,305 --> 00:53:00,743
Oyster farmers coining it again,
like nothing ever happened.

394
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:02,945
That's what time does.

395
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,915
Lesson wasted on the young.

396
00:53:05,948 --> 00:53:08,383
Aileen? Aileen.

397
00:53:09,852 --> 00:53:12,622
Are there any extra hours
I can pick up next week?

398
00:53:12,655 --> 00:53:14,557
You might cover Sarah's shifts.

399
00:53:16,258 --> 00:53:17,593
You haven't heard from her?

400
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:22,965
I have. Yeah.

401
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,453
We've had Guards into us.

402
00:53:46,354 --> 00:53:48,390
Yera, no...

403
00:53:48,423 --> 00:53:49,992
they were just looking
to talk to customers

404
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:51,627
who were in a few weeks back.

405
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,363
It was a quiet night...

406
00:53:56,498 --> 00:53:57,900
That's what I told them.

407
00:54:02,705 --> 00:54:03,940
It'd be more in their line now

408
00:54:03,973 --> 00:54:06,341
to be looking into foreign
trawlers raping our oceans, huh?

409
00:54:08,477 --> 00:54:11,781
Their hands are tied, that's
what they'll tell you anyway.

410
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,022
Why wasn't Jesus
born in Australia?

411
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:21,456
Oye.

412
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:22,692
Ah, 'cause he was...

413
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:23,726
Night, lads.

414
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,461
- All right.
- Yeah.

415
00:54:26,495 --> 00:54:27,864
Are you in with us
tomorrow again, girl?

416
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:29,932
I am, yeah. Thanks.

417
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,567
- Night to you.
- Night.

418
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,635
Night.

419
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,172
Because there was no wise men...

420
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:41,476
No virgins either.

421
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:44,346
- All right.
- Hmm.

422
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:45,782
Good man.

423
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,787
Come on...

424
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:57,660
- Night.
- Night to you. Night.

425
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:15,578
Is Brian in?

426
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,682
A charge is gonna be
brought against him.

427
00:55:19,715 --> 00:55:22,952
He needs to present himself in
front of the district court today week,

428
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:25,888
and an initial remand will
be made in front of a judge.

429
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,690
For fuck sake, Mike.

430
00:55:27,723 --> 00:55:29,892
Look, just make sure
he's there, will you?

431
00:55:46,408 --> 00:55:48,110
You told them
you weren't out that night.

432
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:54,016
But we both know
that's a lie, though.

433
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,818
What do you know about it, Erin?

434
00:55:58,087 --> 00:56:01,389
There's Francie mistreating her
for how many years,

435
00:56:01,423 --> 00:56:04,727
and nobody
thinks anything of it.

436
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,697
And suddenly everyone reckons
that Brian's the problem.

437
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:12,101
Who never put a hand
on a woman in his life.

438
00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:15,004
You said yourself something
was after happening to Sarah.

439
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:18,875
Maybe it was Francie, yeah.

440
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,812
But you don't want
to hear her side?

441
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:48,804
Are you all right?

442
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,475
Sarah's not in again today?

443
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:42,858
What time will you be back?

444
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:44,994
I don't know.

445
00:57:53,602 --> 00:57:55,604
What happens
if he's returned for trial?

446
00:58:26,902 --> 00:58:27,903
Come on.

447
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,574
How does it finish?

448
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:34,210
Hmm?

449
00:58:57,099 --> 00:58:59,235
There's nothing
wrong with you, Paddy, mate.

450
00:59:00,269 --> 00:59:01,804
Hmm.

451
00:59:01,837 --> 00:59:04,173
You're only playing a trick
on the rest of us.

452
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:09,979
What other songs do you have?

453
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:15,084
A verse of <i>McAlpines?</i> Hmm?

454
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,155
A blast of <i>The Wild Rover</i> maybe?

455
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:26,796
Good man.

456
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:30,032
Hm.

457
00:59:31,934 --> 00:59:35,638
The complainant waited
a week before making her report

458
00:59:35,671 --> 00:59:39,842
and claims she was followed down to
the local pier on the night of the assault

459
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:43,813
and that the defendant
subsequently raped her down there.

460
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:48,117
The defendant's mother has
provided him with an alibi, Judge.

461
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:51,620
And she reaffirms the statement that
she and the defendant were in the house

462
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:53,222
during the hours
of the night in question,

463
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:56,158
that the defendant remained
in the house with her

464
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,927
during the hours
of the claimed assault?

465
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:00,963
I do, Your Honor. Yes.

466
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:02,698
Hmm.

467
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,103
This is a serious accusation.

468
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:10,673
It's also the first time the
defendant has been before the court.

469
01:00:13,008 --> 01:00:15,010
Now it's my opinion
that there's not enough...

470
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:18,247
in the Book of Evidence
for the State to prosecute.

471
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,851
Charges will be remanded back
to the DPP for further instructions.

472
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:25,955
I also believe that this charge should
not have been brought before the court.

473
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:28,891
Uh, the defendant
is free to leave.

474
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:34,196
What's next?

475
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,266
File 15, Judge.

476
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,869
Drunk and disorderly.

477
01:03:02,444 --> 01:03:05,080
Aileen.
Come here a minute, will you?

478
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,255
What's her attendance lately?

479
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:20,095
Fourteen of 16 shifts missed.

480
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:23,533
I can make
the days up. Please.

481
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,868
Has anyone else
missed a shift in the same time?

482
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,439
You could have let us know at
least, you know, called in sick.

483
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:33,475
But I have to let you go, girl.

484
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:40,349
You're right, Dennis.

485
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:45,454
I should've let you know
what's been happening with me.

486
01:03:47,189 --> 01:03:49,058
That was the mistake, yeah?

487
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,329
It's all very convenient
for you, though, isn't it?

488
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:57,900
Between Francie's oyster bags
and everything else,

489
01:03:57,933 --> 01:03:59,468
everyone's got their
fucking eyes closed.

490
01:04:03,138 --> 01:04:04,607
Wait, hang on a second.

491
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:08,444
Sarah?

492
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:12,381
What about
the oyster bags, Sarah?

493
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:21,423
Come on lads, focus,
back on the work.

494
01:04:27,429 --> 01:04:29,566
What does she mean
about Francie's oysters, Aileen?

495
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:33,102
Go home.

496
01:04:34,169 --> 01:04:35,904
- What?
- Go home for the day.

497
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,326
Oscar, love.

498
01:04:59,294 --> 01:05:02,498
You can't just take him out
of daycare without telling me.

499
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:03,932
He's not your son.

500
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,236
I don't want you
looking after him anymore.

501
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:09,238
Fuck's sake, Erin.
She's still his grandmother.

502
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:13,208
If you'd actually sit with her,

503
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,444
you wouldn't be able to deny
what happened so easily, Aileen.

504
01:05:15,477 --> 01:05:18,380
- Go easy on her.
- No.

505
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,382
For fuck's sake,
she needs to hear it.

506
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:30,693
I'll talk to her.

507
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,121
You have to be careful with him.

508
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:26,281
And all the time that Sarah was
in here, when it was Erin's room.

509
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:39,361
I used to joke with her mother
about the two of you,

510
01:06:39,394 --> 01:06:40,597
that we'd be in-laws.

511
01:07:16,164 --> 01:07:18,166
Was she lying
about the oyster bags, Aileen?

512
01:07:21,336 --> 01:07:24,473
I'm gonna have to put you on the
line until I figure out what the story is.

513
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:29,612
Moratorium's been lifted.

514
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:32,615
Be a mad few weeks.

515
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:35,284
Might have to hire
a few more hands.

516
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:49,732
So the story went round,

517
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:51,568
and for months,
people thought the wife died

518
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:54,804
'cause she'd fallen down the
well tryin' to save the turkey.

519
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:56,706
It was some clever prick,
the guard.

520
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,576
It'd be great to have
you all over next Sunday after mass.

521
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:02,311
Give you a rest for once.

522
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:05,949
Be a break for you.

523
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:08,417
As if he'd been waiting
for that question the entire time.

524
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:09,451
1: I'll do my apple crumble.

525
01:08:09,484 --> 01:08:11,754
"Because she was
an annoying bitch, that's why."

526
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,634
Two gins and a tonic, please?

527
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:25,702
Not tonight, no.

528
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:29,137
What?

529
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,373
We retain the right
to refuse service here, love.

530
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:34,376
Do yourself a favor
and go quietly.

531
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,445
Hmm?

532
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:44,520
You can all go to fuckin' hell.

533
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:49,926
You stay where you are now, lad.

534
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,294
Hold on to him there, boys.

535
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:53,763
Don't you go
following her now, eh?

536
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,479
I hate these traditional things.

537
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,221
Showing face
just for the sake of it.

538
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:57,827
I might not bother going.

539
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:03,566
Do what you want.

540
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:52,434
It's a late tide today.

541
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:08,885
Aileen.

542
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:16,893
Aileen, would you come in here?

543
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,078
I'll, uh...

544
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,758
<i>...Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women,</i>

545
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,794
<i>and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb Jesus.</i>

546
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:26,128
Holy Mary, mother of God,

547
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:28,531
pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

548
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:30,066
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

549
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:32,935
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

550
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:34,270
Holy Mary, mother of God,

551
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,539
pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

552
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:38,074
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

553
01:14:38,107 --> 01:14:41,043
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

554
01:14:41,077 --> 01:14:42,378
Holy Mary, mother of God,

555
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,847
pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

556
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,382
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

557
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:49,852
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

558
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:51,187
Holy Mary, mother of God,

559
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,289
pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

560
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,824
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

561
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:58,194
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

562
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,528
Holy Mary, mother of God,

563
01:14:59,562 --> 01:15:02,131
pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

564
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:04,166
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee...

565
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,816
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

566
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,284
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

567
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:38,100
Thank you.

568
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:39,635
I'm so sorry for your loss.

569
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,039
Thank you.

570
01:15:43,072 --> 01:15:44,707
I'm so sorry for your loss.

571
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:51,747
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.

572
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:53,249
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

573
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,619
I'm sorry for your loss, Con.

574
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:57,720
Thanks, Sarah.

575
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:17,339
- Sarah!
- Don't fuckin' touch her.

576
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,217
- Condolences for your loss, Brian.
- Thanks.

577
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:43,132
Seems like the whole world
has turned upside down.

578
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:50,706
It's just as fucked
as it's ever been, Mom.

579
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:52,775
It might look different if
you're the one turning. But...

580
01:16:55,411 --> 01:16:56,712
nothing's changed.

581
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:01,984
Trust me.

582
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:13,229
You were right stepping in
like that, though.

583
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:24,740
We're going to head home.

584
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:26,775
Get some rest.

585
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:30,412
You should, too.

586
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,294
Huh?

587
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:46,795
What do you want?

588
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,298
Um, whiskey, I guess.

589
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,466
- You want whiskey?
- Yeah.

590
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,034
Here, two whiskeys, please.

591
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:53,169
Two whiskeys, huh?

592
01:17:53,202 --> 01:17:54,470
- Yeah.
- You look great.

593
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:56,172
- Thanks.
- How're ye, lads?

594
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:00,109
- Do you like whiskey, you do?
- Hmm.

595
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:01,143
Oh, yeah?

596
01:18:02,378 --> 01:18:04,713
- That one's for you.
- Thanks.

597
01:18:04,747 --> 01:18:05,549
Brian?

598
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:10,719
- Aileen, you know Emma, you do?
- Hi.

599
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:14,790
You're better off going home,
girl. He's a bit old for you.

600
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:15,891
What are you doing?

601
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:20,362
In what world did you ever think
that this would be appropriate?

602
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:22,798
What're you talking about?

603
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:24,767
For fuck's sake, who do
you think I am at all, Mom?

604
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,769
Hey, hey. Don't put your hands
on your mother.

605
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:33,242
- Con, what the... Con!
- You're a fucking disgrace.

606
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:38,847
Get off me!

607
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:39,882
Get off!

608
01:20:22,519 --> 01:20:24,953
If you're here to shout, don't
fuckin' bother. I'm going out.

609
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,913
Imagine what it'll
be like out here in a year?

610
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:56,952
This is the investment
round us, like.

611
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:08,030
Do you not feel anything
about what's happened, no?

612
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,368
About Sarah...

613
01:21:16,138 --> 01:21:17,640
about what you did to her?

614
01:21:19,609 --> 01:21:21,511
Don't look at me
like that, will you?

615
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,150
Does it mean
absolutely nothing to you?

616
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:30,185
Is there no heart
or feeling in you?

617
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:31,420
Jesus Christ!

618
01:21:34,691 --> 01:21:38,494
You have this
impossible image of me, Aileen.

619
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:44,199
Let's just move forward,
all right?

620
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:49,905
I want you out of our lives.

621
01:24:00,737 --> 01:24:01,771
Mom!

622
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,473
Mom!

623
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:10,245
Mom!

624
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:31,453
Sarah, love, can I step in?

625
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:57,613
I'm ashamed, girl.
Sitting in your house.

626
01:27:01,951 --> 01:27:03,953
I'm sorry to be
bothering you, I...

627
01:27:04,954 --> 01:27:06,556
I don't know why I had to. I...

628
01:27:08,558 --> 01:27:10,258
I'm not explaining myself.

629
01:27:16,298 --> 01:27:17,399
You shouldn't be leaving.

630
01:27:45,494 --> 01:27:47,329
The wind the past few weeks...

631
01:27:49,331 --> 01:27:51,433
These houses are
so fuckin' bad for it.

632
01:27:54,637 --> 01:27:56,639
I suppose that's what
Mary was hearing.

633
01:27:58,608 --> 01:28:00,408
Sound of Mark in all the rooms.

634
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:05,014
Just the wind getting through.

635
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:14,657
The way I used to listen
to my mother at nights,

636
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:17,292
carrying Dad down to bed
when he'd be pissed.

637
01:28:20,029 --> 01:28:22,497
Hearing her moving around
the rest of the night then,

638
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:24,767
crying away to herself.

639
01:28:26,536 --> 01:28:28,638
Me just lying there
in my own room.

640
01:28:33,109 --> 01:28:36,311
Twenty years ago,
and I can still hear their echo.

641
01:28:48,124 --> 01:28:51,027
I suppose every house
around here has the same ghosts.

642
01:28:56,732 --> 01:29:00,770
Mom was so proud of the fact that
she was able to leave me this house.

643
01:29:06,108 --> 01:29:08,376
I'd live here after she did,

644
01:29:10,012 --> 01:29:13,916
and so on...
until the tide takes it.

645
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:26,529
All the times I used to wake up
in your house, Aileen...

646
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:31,133
Brian in the bed beside me.

647
01:29:36,172 --> 01:29:38,941
That same wind
keeping me awake every night.

648
01:29:45,681 --> 01:29:47,950
Is it the sound of him
that's haunting me...

649
01:29:49,151 --> 01:29:50,953
with all these other ghosts?

650
01:29:54,056 --> 01:29:56,058
The thunder of pasts getting in.

651
01:29:56,092 --> 01:29:58,995
Because all of a sudden, I...

652
01:30:01,463 --> 01:30:02,732
I don't know where I am.

653
01:30:06,636 --> 01:30:09,805
As if this house
and all its history wasn't mine.

653
01:30:10,305 --> 01:31:10,470
