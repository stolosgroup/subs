New car, Z? For your information only,

00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:39,691
that's a prototype.

4
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:42,129
Bother. Yes. Right.

5
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:46,524
I'll be back in a sec.
Don't touch a thing.

England Captain,
Danny "Mean Machine" Meehan,

00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:04,542
is licensed to score with Umbro.

8
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,247
Licensed to get hammered,
you mean.

9
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:47,498
Whoo-hoo!

10
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:03,601
Elvis, large whiskey.

11
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:06,648
Do you want anything in that? Yeah,
a double.

12
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:10,042
It's lively in here, isn't it?

13
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,610
Didn't you used to be
that Danny Meehan?

14
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:15,961
Used to be, mate.
A very long time ago.

15
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:18,573
Sir, I'm afraid we're gonna
have to Breathalyze you.

16
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:22,446
No need, officer.
I'm totally pissed.

17
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,710
Come on, Danny. No trouble.

18
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:28,235
Oh, look. A miniature copper.

19
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:32,195
I think you'd better
come along with us.

20
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,544
What?

21
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:36,373
Don't be silly.
Oh, come on. Aah!

22
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:38,506
You are nicked, sunshine.

23
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:42,814
BBC News headlines.

24
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,816
At London Crown Court
this morning,

25
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,644
ex-England football captain,
Danny Meehan,

26
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:48,211
was jailed for three years,

27
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:49,647
despite having pleaded guilty

28
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:51,214
to assaulting
two police officers

29
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:53,477
and driving drunk whilst banned.

30
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,131
Meehan's downfall
from the pinnacle

31
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,220
of world football
celebrity has been swift

32
00:02:57,264 --> 00:03:00,267
since accusations of
match-fixing ended the career

33
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,834
of one of this country's
finest players.

34
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:04,445
The judge showed little sympathy

35
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,186
for Meehan's pleas
of mitigation,

36
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:08,536
imposing the maximum sentence.

37
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:11,756
Meehan showed no emotion
as he was led away.

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,932
The one-time superstar
will serve his sentence

39
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:16,065
at Longmarsh high-security
prison...

40
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:20,243
...famous for its
rehabilitation program...

41
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,248
...reformed characters
and modern conditions.

42
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,180
Open!

43
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,878
That's it, get out!

44
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:48,793
Come on!

45
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,623
Get away from the van. Shut it!

46
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:56,061
This is a category "B" nick,
not fuckin' Butlin's.

47
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,541
Do you understand?

48
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,282
You're nothing in here.
Do you hear me?

49
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:02,416
Nothing! Move out!

50
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,722
May the good Lord be with you.

51
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:07,943
Heh-heh. He's a pretty boy.

52
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:13,427
Coming in!

53
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:16,604
Come on. Straight down
the stairs, mate.

54
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:19,346
Prisoner on the move!

55
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,915
Stay behind the line.
Stand there. Valuables?

56
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,483
Prisoner Meehan 04112.

57
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,357
Sign it.

58
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,296
Here's your designer gear
for the next three years.

59
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,582
Enjoy.

60
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:40,149
What are you waiting for, eh?

61
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,020
Come on, move it!

62
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,663
He was captain of his country
and he ends up in here, eh?

63
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:18,448
Seventy-three caps for England

64
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:20,189
and you sell
your country out in a game?

65
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:22,974
That's un-bloody-English,
that is.

66
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:36,727
Chief.

67
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,161
I'm the chief officer
of this prison.

68
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:23,078
You call me "Mr. Burton, sir."

69
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:27,865
You call him Mr. Ratchett
and him Mr. Hayter.

70
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:32,043
Anybody in this uniform,
you call mister, right?

71
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:35,133
Right,

72
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,048
Mr. Burton, sir.

73
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:42,445
Sometime tomorrow,
the governor wants a word.

74
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:49,104
He wants you to coach
my football team.

75
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:52,412
Little word of advice:

76
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:59,244
You're gonna smile nicely
and say no.

77
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,985
Move it, Meehan! All right!

78
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:05,729
What did you say?
That's "Mr. Hayter, sir" to you.

79
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,427
Do you understand?

80
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,473
I think you need a little
reminder of Mr. Burton's orders.

81
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:20,788
You won't coach
that football team.

82
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,790
Okay?

83
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,186
Stand there where I can see you.

84
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,975
Meehan, stow your kit top right.

85
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:38,327
All right, lads.
New cell mate for you.

86
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,589
I'm sure you recognize him.

87
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,809
He used to be a somebody
once upon a time.

88
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,820
Out you go. Got plenty of time

89
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:54,299
to get to know
your new playmates.

90
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,912
Work assignment, "C" Wing.

91
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,920
Got you an apprentice.
He used to be a sweeper.

92
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:09,227
Comedian. Enjoy it, Meehan.

93
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:13,754
I've got some advice for you.

94
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:15,799
Thanks. I'm a bit short
on advice today.

95
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:19,803
This will change your life.
Do you see that?

96
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:21,892
Be very careful of those.

97
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:24,112
Some of the boys
have a pony in the night,

98
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:28,029
wrap it and airmail it
out the window.

99
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:30,422
Here, use this.

100
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:33,034
Glamorous job, huh?

101
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:36,690
Stick it in the bin
and follow me, okay?

102
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,520
Come on!

103
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:46,787
Do you know who that is?

104
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,268
Oi, Meehan, here.

105
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:52,706
Not the muscle, the other one.

106
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:55,317
Christ, he's got old.

107
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,407
Thirty years
will do that to you.

108
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,409
Still thinks he's Al Capone.

109
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:03,499
You'd better go over.

110
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:11,594
You know who I am?

111
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:14,554
Charlie Sykes.

112
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,557
I run this nick.

113
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,689
I've been told.

114
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,868
I lost a great deal of money

115
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:27,262
on an England/Germany game
a few years back.

116
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:32,354
After one of the Englanders
gave away a very suspect penalty

117
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:35,183
after 72 minutes
of playing time.

118
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:43,147
So I think that you owe me.

119
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:51,025
Come on, superstar.

120
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:52,940
Tour's not over.

121
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:58,249
You know, it's not gonna
be easy for you in here.

122
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:01,339
What's everyone's problem?

123
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:04,081
You really wanna know?

124
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,649
Most of the guys
in here have nothing.

125
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:10,087
Never had to start with.
But you,

126
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:13,047
you had everything
they ever dreamed of,

127
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,179
and you threw it all away.

128
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:49,083
Ha-ha-ha! It's the superstar!

129
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:52,869
Danny Meehan.
It's the thingy. The, uh...

130
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:55,350
Fuckin' hell, the Mean Machine!

131
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:57,482
I bet you got a few stories
haven't you, eh?

132
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,354
All the, uh...

133
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:02,618
All the, you know...
The pussy and all that thing.

134
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,707
Funny enough, no.

135
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,709
Yeah? So what, big shot.

136
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:08,798
I know all about fame.
I was a face.

137
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:11,061
I was a face myself.
I was the man.

138
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:14,717
The late '80s, all around the
raves, all that, fuckin' vroom!

139
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:16,980
I was the top fuckin' kitty!

140
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:21,942
My food? Oh, Danny boy.

141
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:25,510
Anything you need,

142
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,425
I'm a one

143
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:40,047
Anything you want,
I can get it for you.

144
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,026
I've just had that
from Mr. Fix it over there,

145
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,225
throwing the beans.

146
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:46,140
Nitro? Keep away from him, mate.

147
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:48,664
Gets in with all the,
like, newcomers

148
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,014
so that he can hustle them.

149
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,016
And what's your angle?

150
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,733
Well, if you want any
of life's little luxuries:

151
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:59,675
Chocolate, toothpaste,
soft toilet paper.

152
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,721
Massive is your man.

153
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,679
Massive?

154
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,726
It's ironic.

155
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:10,120
Right, Raj, you be black.

156
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:12,079
No, man, I'll be white. Raji,
just chill, man.

157
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,447
Don't fight it.
You got a black nose.

158
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:15,386
You saying I'm black? Yeah.

159
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,737
Well, that makes me
the first Iranian from Babylon.

160
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:23,003
The neighborhood celeb's in
town. Put the kettle on, Raji.

161
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,482
Oh, would you like any biscuits?

162
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:27,311
I never asked to be put in here. What,
and we did?

163
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:30,880
I don't need this. You don't need this?

164
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:33,709
Let me tell you
what we don't need.

165
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:38,018
We don't need you,
another body, in here.

166
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:39,628
Ain't nothing personal, pal,

167
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:43,066
It's just I don't
fuckin' like you.

168
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,635
Oh, our star looks beat, Trojan.

169
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:48,071
Yeah, he needs to chill.

170
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,769
Yeah, he's had
a hard day at work.

171
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,422
Any requests, star?

172
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:23,193
The legendary Broadhurst Monk.

173
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:26,240
Shipped in about six months ago,

174
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:28,808
but they still have him down
on the special unit.

175
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,635
Why?

176
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,161
Apparently he killed 23 men
with his bare hands.

177
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,121
Maybe I should take up karate.

178
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:40,297
Oh, that was before
he took up karate.

179
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:44,258
Don't mess with him.
Not even the screws.

180
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:48,566
Not even when
he's all cuffed up.

181
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,399
Is that the famous footballer?

182
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,359
Ex-footballer.
He's just a number now.

183
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,797
Chief.

184
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,408
Stand there.

185
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,021
Danny Meehan.

186
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:10,675
Well, it is a pleasure
to meet you.

187
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:14,288
I'm a big football fan. Big.

188
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:17,769
What do you think
of amateur football?

189
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:20,337
Heh. It's amateur.

190
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:26,866
Yes. Well, I'm sure
we're not a match for the pros,

191
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,868
but we do have our own team.

192
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:32,001
Southern division, semipros.

193
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:35,396
And we have a chance of winning
the division this year,

194
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:39,443
getting promotion.
We have been runners up before,

195
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:43,012
but first is first
and second is nowhere.

196
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,928
I want you to train the team.

197
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:49,540
Use your professional
experience.

198
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:54,284
Well, I haven't played
football for years

199
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:57,287
and I'm a little bit out of
condition at the moment.

200
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:08,081
I pulled a lot of strings to
get you assigned to my prison.

201
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:14,261
I'm sorry.
I'm just not your man.

202
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:21,050
Out.

203
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:25,402
Mr. Burton,
a quick word if I may.

204
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,708
Sir?

205
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:29,667
I've spent a fortune
on this team for no return.

206
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:31,931
I am the coach of this team.
With the amount of money

207
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:35,499
that I've spent, we should have
bloody won the World Cup by now.

208
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:38,024
You cannot put a prisoner in
charge of the guards' team.

209
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:42,854
Just get it done, please.
And use your...

210
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,769
I wouldn't get too close, miss. Why?

211
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:47,163
You're not dangerous,
are you, Mr. Footballer?

212
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:48,773
Only if you've got
the ball, miss.

213
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,340
Get out!

214
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:54,257
Hey, Danny boy,
I can get you anything.

215
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,738
Anything that's not on the menu.
You know what I mean?

216
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,003
Is that stink you, Meehan?

217
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,874
Don't you poke me again.

218
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:07,401
Ooh, don't you start growing
a spine, footballer.

219
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:10,621
Bollocks. Hey! Hey!

220
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,281
Hands behind your neck, Meehan!
Hands behind your neck!

221
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:22,111
Hands behind your neck! Bitch, shut up!

222
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:25,158
Hands behind your neck, Meehan! You bitch!

223
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:29,249
Let go! Let go, Meehan!
Let go of the baton, Meehan!

224
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:32,339
Let go of the baton, Meehan! Fuckin'...

225
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,349
Pack it in. Pack it in.

226
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:09,985
Razzle-Dazzle,
3:00, Kempton Park.

227
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,162
Five thousand pounds, please.

228
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:15,686
Um, to win.

229
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,822
All this lovely fresh air, eh?

230
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:25,392
Wouldn't you rather be out there
on the pitch, coaching?

231
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:28,047
I just wanna keep my head down,

232
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,700
do my 12 months
and I'm going home.

233
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,354
Twelve months, yes.

234
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:33,617
But that's with parole.

235
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:36,359
And that's before
you assaulted another inmate

236
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:38,579
and attacked my staff. Wait a minute.

237
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:41,756
Three years,
that's your sentence.

238
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,194
So, you could be with us
for some time. Hmm?

239
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:51,548
Take him back to solitary.

240
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,481
Psst. Have a
nice week's holiday.

241
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:12,613
Yeah, lovely.

242
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,919
There is a way out. What?

243
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:18,575
Listen. Convince the governor
the best way to train the guards

244
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:21,404
is to play a really tough match
against a team of cons,

245
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:24,668
with you as the captain.

246
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:27,628
Well, pros always have
a pre-season friendly.

247
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:33,286
Well, what do you think,
Mr. Burton?

248
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:40,554
Could be win-win for everybody.

249
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:43,687
Well, could this work, Meehan?

250
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,689
Yeah. But I need time to prep.

251
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,170
And I get to pick my own team.

252
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:51,260
Ooh, I could get a real FA ref.

253
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:54,350
There's one at my golf club.
That'd be good.

254
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:55,786
One more thing.

255
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,747
What goes on on the pitch,
stays on the pitch.

256
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:05,100
Deal? Goes without saying.

257
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:09,148
Ha-ha! I am a marketing genius.

258
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:15,154
You better get yourself
some rest, superstar.

259
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,677
Busy day tomorrow.

260
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,202
We'll see.

261
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:24,032
Oi, remember, anything you need.

262
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:26,208
I'm fine. Thanks.

263
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:28,471
Yeah

264
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:30,734
I could have been a pro,
you know. I was good.

265
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:32,823
I was very good.
They were gonna take me on,

266
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:35,217
only I had a bit of trouble
and blah, blah, blah.

267
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:38,655
The old knees, I suppose, yeah?

268
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,572
Bomb making.

269
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:45,662
Heh. Otherwise, you know.

270
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:49,275
Well, I'm sure it was
a big loss to the game.

271
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:51,929
I've gotta go,
but I'll catch you later.

272
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,587
Nitro.

273
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,372
Dickhead.

274
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:04,377
Yes, Razzle-Dazzle, came second.

275
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,987
What's the problem, darling?

276
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,815
Well, that's not possible.

277
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:11,035
It's very possible,
sweets. That's not possible.

278
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,517
I think you owe me
five G, darling.

279
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:16,650
Have a nice day.

280
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:20,697
So, what happened to your
marketing, Mr. Genius?

281
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:22,438
It's early days yet. I mean,

282
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,266
you gotta give it
a little bit of time, Dan.

283
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,660
Oi, Danny.
Over here, mate. Over here.

284
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:29,228
Whoo, whoo, whoo! Here we go.

285
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:32,666
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Whoo, whoo! Yes!

286
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,537
Now I can say
I've had a kick about

287
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,496
with Danny the Mean Machine.
Whoo-whoo!

288
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,107
Burning in me head!
Burning in me head!

289
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,938
It's all right.
I'll go and get it.

290
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:51,206
Found a new bum chum, have we?

291
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,774
Makes you feel big, does he?

292
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,558
He's just using you.

293
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,430
Once he finds his feet in here,

294
00:20:57,473 --> 00:21:00,171
he'll dump you on your fat,
black arse,

295
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,522
you jumped-up little shit.

296
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:05,089
Mr. Ratchett, sir, whilst
I don't wish to be rude,

297
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,396
I do believe that you watched
too many Tarzan films

298
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,355
as an impressible child.

299
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:15,709
Don't you get fuckin' smart
with me. You understand?

300
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,711
Now get out of my sights.

301
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:34,075
What happened to you?

302
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:35,990
Nothing.

303
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:40,516
Sykes's boys look pretty useful.

304
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,171
Heh-heh-heh.
Don't even think about it.

305
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:46,522
Who'd you think's been
stopping everyone from playing?

306
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:04,801
I loved your work, man.

307
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,629
Sorry?

308
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:09,850
I never believed any of the
talk. I can't believe it.

309
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:11,982
Here you are, look.
Here you are.

310
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,072
Cheers.

311
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,163
That buys you
three across, mate.

312
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:22,515
Then you can teach me. Have a nice one.

313
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,256
Will you teach me, yeah?

314
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,650
Teach you what?

315
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:31,175
All that, you know,
all them soccer skills.

316
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:33,700
All that.

317
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:38,835
Sorry, mate, do what?

318
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,577
You know, like the pros.
All that caper.

319
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,928
Yeah?

320
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:47,888
I gotta go, but we'll stick
a pin in it, all right?

321
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:50,151
We'll stick a pin in it,
eh, Dan? Lovely.

322
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:52,153
Fan club.

323
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:54,068
Bloody stalker.

324
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,201
What's three across?

325
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:59,029
What?

326
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:02,032
I just saw a bloke pay money
for a strip of crossword.

327
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:04,252
Ah, Sykes.

328
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:08,038
Yeah, three across,
four letters,

329
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:09,823
"Acid."

330
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:13,392
you see, the governor
lets Sykes get his racing times

331
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:16,046
and other papers
special delivery.

332
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,702
He thinks it helps Sykes
work out form

333
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:22,052
and give him tips.

334
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:25,404
He doesn't know that
they're presoaked in acid.

335
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:28,711
He's actually smuggling
Sykes's drugs in for him.

336
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:34,717
He came second,
and it cost me 5,000 pounds.

337
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:37,067
You must have made
the wrong bet.

338
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:41,028
"W" for win.

339
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:45,424
Win.

340
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:49,732
It's got smudged in the rain.

341
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:53,997
"E-W."

342
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,912
"E-W" means each way.

343
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,617
It's a fuckin' disgrace
if you ask me.

344
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:09,491
Meehan fraternizing
with that shower of shit.

345
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,580
What do you want, Tompkinson?

346
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,278
Well, I was thinking.
No, I know...

347
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:18,108
I know that I can help you,
Mr. Ratchett, sir, you know.

348
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:20,459
Information and all.
Blah, blah. Whatever.

349
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:21,764
Help yourself more like.

350
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:23,679
I'm sick of this place.

351
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:25,507
I need to get a transfer.

352
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:27,596
Yeah? H.M.P. Silver Sands.

353
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,643
Away from the influence
of all these criminals, sir.

354
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:36,953
You keep me posted.

355
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,226
Oh, look. A monkey
learning new tricks.

356
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,228
Why don't you just
leave me alone, man?

357
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:54,623
Because I don't like
uppity coons, that's why.

358
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,843
Listen, man. No, you listen!

359
00:24:56,886 --> 00:24:58,627
Aah!

360
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:00,629
You animal. Animal?

361
00:25:00,673 --> 00:25:03,632
You callin' me a fuckin' animal?

362
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:06,069
I'll open you up
like a tin of fuckin' beans!

363
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:08,376
Hey, stop him!
Someone, stop him!

364
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:11,466
When did you get the balls
big enough to fuck with me,

365
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,989
you fuckin' scum?

366
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:20,040
Mass, Mass, are you all right?
Christ, he needs a doctor!

367
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,216
Just get a doctor!

368
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:54,683
That fuckin' Meehan.

369
00:26:28,064 --> 00:26:31,894
Mr. Burton, have you missed me?

370
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:33,785
You might be the governor's
pet project, Meehan,

371
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,768
but don't push it.

372
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,210
It's called sunlight, Meehan.

373
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:46,169
Think of it as a privilege
which can be withdrawn.

374
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:51,087
Danny boy.

375
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:55,135
Well, come on, then. Star.

376
00:26:56,963 --> 00:27:00,575
They're saying thanks
for saving Massive.

377
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:05,362
Where's your manners?
What would your old mum say?

378
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:07,800
Fuck me. Wish I'd met her.

379
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,279
Let's see how good you are.

380
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:12,805
Sort yourselves out.
Skins v. shirts.

381
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:17,113
What's that? I'm your manager.

382
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:18,462
Since when?

383
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:19,962
Look. Don't bother
giving me no orders, yeah?

384
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:22,771
Look, stop bitchin', bitch.

385
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:24,947
Dan, have a word. Shut it, Massive.

386
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:27,776
Oi, lads, want a game?

387
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,691
Fuck off!

388
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:32,172
Come, Dan.
Plenty of room over there.

389
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:35,001
Shoot!

390
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,888
Yes, yes, Troj, it's up!

391
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:02,202
What'd you think?

392
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:04,944
Bring the clipboard.

393
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:07,424
Five.

394
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:12,734
Three.

395
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:17,043
A generous 1.

396
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,917
Seven?

397
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:31,187
Ten. Eight.

398
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:32,948
My mum could have scored
from that distance.

399
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:35,931
Still. Yeah, I know.

400
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:37,866
Right, lads, over here.
We'll try a fitness test.

401
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,762
One, left hand down.
Two, right hand down.

402
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:43,460
Three, both hands. Four, clap.

403
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,724
Five, up, run.

404
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:50,554
Bollocks. One, two, three, four, five.

405
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:52,643
I don't know. I wouldn't mind
a crack at the guards.

406
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:56,082
I'm sorry. I missed that.

407
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,127
Just saying, be a laugh.

408
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:00,869
Well, that's the Scots
all over, isn't it?

409
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:03,393
On the firm when it suits them,

410
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:07,093
and the next minute they're all
misty-eyed and independent.

411
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:12,054
I was only saying... And I'm saying no.

412
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:15,797
I think we're gonna have to
work on the stamina, lads.

413
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:24,327
Well, I'll pay
at the end of the month.

414
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,895
- No, sweets.
- It's cash on the nail.

415
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:28,375
Well, I haven't got it.

416
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:31,639
Well, sell the nice
new Saab then, love.

417
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:34,033
How'd you know about that?

418
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:35,817
Pay us or we'll torch the motor.

419
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:39,386
You can pay us out of the
insurance. There you go, sorted.

420
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:42,432
I was told that
you were reasonable.

421
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:44,434
Reasonable, sweetheart?

422
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:46,045
Reasonable is how come

423
00:29:46,088 --> 00:29:47,762
you're ain't sitting
in a pool of your own piss,

424
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,832
wondering how to get up
with smashed knees and elbows.

425
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,791
Okay?

426
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,967
Big kiss.

427
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:12,071
Looking forward
to getting a thrashing, Meehan?

428
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:14,029
Well, if it means
getting out of here early,

429
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:16,640
I'll take another
beating from your heavy mob.

430
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:18,033
Who said anything
about a beating?

431
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:19,556
I'm talking about the match.

432
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,081
Come on. I've seen
your lot in action.

433
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:29,131
I don't run my ship like that.

434
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:32,352
Are you making a complaint? No.

435
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:36,399
Lock it up!

436
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,887
Oi.What's the matter?

437
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:49,021
Did you have a nice chat
with your chum Burton, eh?

438
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:51,023
Ain't you got any hobbies?

439
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:53,634
You sleep
with one eye open, son.

440
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:55,636
Whatever.

441
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,408
Hello, Danny boy. Nitro.

442
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:32,325
I've been wondering, Dan.
I think you need a manager.

443
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:35,023
The tactics and all that,
well, I am the bollocks.

444
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:37,025
Massive's manager.

445
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,549
Yeah, I know,
but I'm better than him,

446
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:41,508
because, well,
I had trials, didn't I? So...

447
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:44,903
We all had trials, mate.
That's why we're here.

448
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:49,124
Fuck off! Fuck off!

449
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:52,127
Football trials, yeah?

450
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:54,216
I could be the, uh...
I could be the physio.

451
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,002
Oh, no, no, wait there.
I could be the pharmacist.

452
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:59,047
Get the lads pepped up
and all that bollocks.

453
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:02,877
I don't think so, mate.

454
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,053
Good job he likes you.

455
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:07,708
He blew up five people
he didn't.

456
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:09,753
They're slags, you know.

457
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:12,495
They won't even let me in their
poxy squad or nothing like that.

458
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,977
I don't give a fuck
about their poxy squad!

459
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:17,370
Do you understand me?

460
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:20,242
If you want out
of this fuckin' prison,

461
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:22,723
you gotta come up with something
to spoil their little party.

462
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:24,768
Otherwise,

463
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:26,553
you're fucked.

464
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:30,644
- Okay, okay, okay, relax.
- Be in the atrium,

465
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,472
11:00 tomorrow morning.

466
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:34,517
Ah, Mr. Burton. Thank you.

467
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:36,955
It's only a paper. Mm-hmm.

468
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:41,002
One down, two words:
You're nicked.

469
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:42,786
Do you know the penalty

470
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,895
for the possession of illegal
substances in a prison?

471
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:46,660
Search him.

472
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:52,013
What you looking at, freak?

473
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:55,408
You were grassed up. Eh?

474
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:57,018
That dodgy fuckin' Meehan

475
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:59,107
is getting well pally
with Mr. Burton.

476
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:02,110
I've seen 'em talking.

477
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,782
What are you doing,
Ketch? No one likes a grass, Danny boy.

478
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:24,828
What do you mean a
grass? The big man's right.

479
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:27,353
We're gonna see what we can
do about them beady eyes, eh?

480
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:29,572
Fuck's sake, Chiv,
you know it weren't me.

481
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:31,333
"You know it's not me.
You know it's not me."

482
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:33,054
Which one am I gonna burst?

483
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:35,404
You choose...
The left or the right.

484
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:37,363
For fuck's sake! Go on, pop it!

485
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:39,017
Fuckin' hold him still!

486
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,236
Hurry up, you Jock bastard!
You calling a Jock bastard?

487
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,760
You,
you twat! Aah! What's going on here, eh?

488
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:50,245
I cut myself shaving.Nosebleed.
It's the altitude.

489
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:57,252
Oh, you wanna get that seen to.

490
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:03,084
Right, that's a yellow card,
gentlemen.

491
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:05,217
Behave yourselves.

492
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,140
You wanna be
more careful with this.

493
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:21,494
You could have had my eye out.

494
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,434
Thanks, by the way.

495
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:51,741
You saved me
a lot of grief back there.

496
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:53,743
Sorry about the...

497
00:34:53,787 --> 00:34:55,136
That's all right.

498
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,444
Anyway, you need
a few more players.

499
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:00,228
What about your lot over there?

500
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:02,361
I don't think so.
Not against Sykes's word.

501
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:04,406
Not that some of them
wouldn't be up for it.

502
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,756
- What makes you bulletproof?
- He's not,

503
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,454
but he's well pally
with one bloke

504
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:09,977
that Sykes is cagey about.

505
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,110
Who? MASSIVE: The Monk, man.

506
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:14,112
That dude is beyond mental.

507
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:16,157
And so are his pals
on the outside.

508
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:18,855
Sykes, he wants a smooth flow.

509
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:24,209
All he really cares
about is profit.

510
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,864
What money?

511
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:31,129
You're a betting man.
We'll make a deal.

512
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:35,045
Let your lads play. Win or lose,

513
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:37,744
you call the result,
bet accordingly.

514
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:45,491
Back to your fixing
the match routine, right?

515
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:49,495
Now, listen. It's like this.

516
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:51,497
I'd never take a bet
against England,

517
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,327
and I wouldn't bet
the screws against the cons.

518
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,503
Capisce?

519
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:00,506
Then we can play to win.

520
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:05,859
Would you think about it? Yes,
I'll think about it.

521
00:36:05,902 --> 00:36:09,167
But right now, I'm thinking
you're polluting my air.

522
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:13,258
Now go away.

523
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:16,304
How'd it go? It didn't.

524
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:20,047
Here, Dan. Dan, um...

525
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,484
I've been thinking.

526
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:24,201
Leave the thinking to me,
all right, Billy?

527
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,662
Yeah, yeah, of course, Dan.

528
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:31,972
Uh, well, what it is, Dan, um...

529
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,497
I was...

530
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:40,502
Uh, what... What...
I was wondering if, um...

531
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:42,635
Wondering what, Billy?

532
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:49,163
Can I be on the team?

533
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:56,126
The squad, Billy.

534
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,433
You can be on the squad.

535
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:02,698
I won't let you down, Danny.
You know that, don't you?

536
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:04,831
All right.

537
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:13,013
Yes, the squad, yes! Come on!
Well in, Bill. Well done!

538
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,756
Yeah, the squad, the squad!

539
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:18,714
Well in.

540
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:22,588
Yes, you told me
they were reasonable.

541
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:25,721
They are reasonable,
but they're businessmen.

542
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:28,246
You got me into this,
and you can get me out.

543
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,899
Hey, whoa, whoa.

544
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:31,901
I opened the door,
you walked through it.

545
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:34,208
You've been making money
ever since.

546
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,471
So why haven't you got it?

547
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:40,388
It is just a temporary
cash-flow problem.

548
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:43,261
The team is bleeding me dry.

549
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:45,350
Well, get it sorted.

550
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:47,265
Because this lot
have got a bad habit

551
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:48,570
of turning cash-flow problems

552
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:50,964
into blood-flow problems.

553
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:54,968
Oof. I used to do double this
just for a warm up, you know.

554
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:58,841
Heh-heh. Anno domini, mate.

555
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:00,930
I used to be able
to piss in one go,

556
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:03,803
and then forget about it
for the rest of the morning.

557
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:07,285
Ugh. Bloody hell.

558
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:08,764
You never did say how come

559
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:11,114
it ain't done your nut
in here being in so long.

560
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:13,769
Only does your nut if you
don't think you should be here.

561
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:17,512
Look at me.
Sweet old geezer, huh?

562
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:22,387
Bit bumbly,
full of jail-block wisdom.

563
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,302
Cornerstone of the nick,

564
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,216
put in with the foundations,
right?

565
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,002
Heh-heh. Right.

566
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:32,745
I didn't get to be the oldest
slag for breakin' windows.

567
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,618
Villains spend their lives
shitting themselves

568
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:40,579
that other criminals
are going to seize them.

569
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:45,714
So they get their retaliation
in first and twice as nasty.

570
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,980
A bloke was comin' after me.

571
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:53,418
So I, uh...

572
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:56,638
I went around to his digs and
lobbed a grenade in the window.

573
00:38:56,682 --> 00:39:01,034
Left over after the war,
you know. Army surplus.

574
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:04,820
I didn't know,
but he had his little nipper

575
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:06,996
and his bird in there with him.

576
00:39:08,824 --> 00:39:12,741
The house went up like
Guy Fawkes Night.

577
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,223
No one came out.

578
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:21,489
He barricaded the door with
furniture in case I came around.

579
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:26,712
By the time they got in,
the screamin' had stopped.

580
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:31,673
Thirteen months old.

581
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:34,589
Learning to walk, apparently.

582
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:42,467
Nothing I can do is ever
gonna make up for that, is it?

583
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,403
You're on. What's that, a joke?

584
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:07,970
I'm not famous
for my sense of humor.

585
00:40:08,014 --> 00:40:11,539
I know Nitro's
the grass, not you.

586
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:15,413
You fight one of my boys.

587
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,502
Fight?

588
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:20,026
A little earner
I stage now and then.

589
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:23,246
I can't be seen to giving
you a free ride.

590
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,900
Fight who?

591
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:26,902
Fight him.

592
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,904
Soft as puppy shit, Nick is.

593
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:31,559
I'm an ex-footballer,
Charlie, not a boxer.

594
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:34,127
So? Kick him.

595
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:38,261
An eye for an eye, you bastard.

596
00:40:43,702 --> 00:40:45,791
An eye for a fucking... Boo!

597
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:49,447
Don't you do that again.

598
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:52,145
Calm down, silly bollocks.

599
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:55,235
You seem to be making more
fucking enemies by the minute.

600
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:58,456
Yeah? Well, I want out

601
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:01,241
of this shithouse!

602
00:41:01,284 --> 00:41:03,461
Please! Please!

603
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,508
You're halfway home, son.

604
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:09,467
I'm taking you down
to segregation now.

605
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,121
That's why I'm here. Yeah?

606
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:14,123
Yeah.

607
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:17,170
Just get me a transfer,
Mr. Ratchett, sir, please.

608
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:21,304
Please. Please.
Silverino Sands, yeah?

609
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:22,654
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

610
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:24,525
I will do anything,
Mr. Ratchett, sir.

611
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:29,312
I will do anything,
Mr. Ratchett.

612
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:34,013
You owe me for this. Out. Now.

613
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,416
We have a small change of plan.

614
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,637
Nick has come over all poorly,

615
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:51,770
so I had to bring on
a substitute.

616
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:56,122
Walk away, Danny. Walk away.

617
00:41:56,165 --> 00:42:00,953
Mass, this is the only way we're
gonna get these boys to play.

618
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:07,655
In the dirty brown corner,
with a record of 35-0,

619
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:10,919
all coming by the way
of the big K.O.,

620
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:15,794
the heavy-duty champion
of the penal world,

621
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:21,277
Ketch,
the Black Country Bastard!

622
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:27,806
Come on! Come on!

623
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:31,592
And in the other
equally dirty brown corner,

624
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:33,115
we have the challenger.

625
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,727
Formerly known as
the Mean Machine.

626
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:38,599
Danny "I've Had More
Bloody Backhanders

627
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:41,820
Than Boris Bleedin' Becker"
Meehan!

628
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:51,220
Gentlemen,
it's alternate punches.

629
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:56,486
Followed by one mug
of five-star prison cognac.

630
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,576
Cheers.

631
00:42:59,794 --> 00:43:02,623
No using your left hand.
No butting, biting,

632
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,191
spitting, poking
or kissing, you.

633
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:08,629
It's show time!

634
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:14,722
First head to hit
the table loses.

635
00:43:16,898 --> 00:43:20,075
First punch to the challenger.

636
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:29,737
Is he trying to
kiss me, or what?

637
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,876
Keep your head off the table.

638
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:41,401
Head up!

639
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:44,534
Hey! Hey!

640
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:46,624
Focus, Danny. Wake up!

641
00:43:51,803 --> 00:43:53,674
He fuckin'... He fuckin'...

642
00:43:58,897 --> 00:44:00,289
Get the water on him.

643
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:03,292
Straighten yourself up, Danny.
Concentrate.

644
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:06,992
Focus, Danny!

645
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:13,433
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

646
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:15,740
By the way, I'm in here for GBH.

647
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:22,572
Water, Troj, water!

648
00:44:22,616 --> 00:44:25,401
Come on!

649
00:44:29,623 --> 00:44:32,495
Keep your head up, Danny!

650
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:09,837
I'm in here for drunken assault.

651
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:11,447
Yeah!

652
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:22,632
First up, I'd like to
welcome Mr. Sykes's boys.

653
00:45:22,676 --> 00:45:25,505
Now watch this.

654
00:45:25,548 --> 00:45:27,420
Phew!

655
00:45:32,381 --> 00:45:35,384
Hey, all right!

656
00:45:35,428 --> 00:45:38,953
Nice, Danny.

657
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:41,869
Okay, if you wanna do that,
join a circus.

658
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:43,871
It's no good to us.

659
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:46,744
What we need is 11 men
to play as a team. Right?

660
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:49,094
Right! Yes!

661
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:52,401
That's lovely, Dan, that.
Well in. Right!

662
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,188
Okay, positions.
Now I play center midfield.

663
00:45:56,231 --> 00:45:58,407
Let's have all the midfield
players behind me...

664
00:45:58,451 --> 00:46:00,801
Defenders to me left,
strikers to me right.

665
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:04,936
Come on, lads. Come on! Come on!

666
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:13,379
Terrific. Let's move on.

667
00:46:18,471 --> 00:46:21,039
That's good. Now pass it.

668
00:46:22,475 --> 00:46:25,260
Pass it, Trojan!

669
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:26,871
Pass it!

670
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,310
Trojan, it's a team game!
Pass to our team!

671
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:34,487
He's too greedy.

672
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,184
Okay, fellas.

673
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:38,839
Now the key to set pieces
is concentration,

674
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:41,189
calculation, teamwork.

675
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:45,803
With corners,
it's about movement,

676
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:49,241
drawing defenders
out of position.

677
00:46:49,284 --> 00:46:52,070
When it comes to defending,

678
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:54,550
it's about tackling,

679
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:56,988
finesse,

680
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:59,468
calculation.

681
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:05,823
Now remember these simple rules
and we're in with a chance.

682
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:07,259
Any questions?

683
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:11,350
Lovely story.

684
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:13,308
Yeah.

685
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:17,008
We still need a goalkeeper.

686
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:19,401
Somebody to boss
the defense about.

687
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:22,491
There's one man I know who
could boss our def... No. No.

688
00:47:22,535 --> 00:47:25,494
Fuck that. That's not
even worth thinking about.

689
00:47:25,538 --> 00:47:26,844
Who

690
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:28,758
No, no, you'll
laugh your head off.

691
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:31,849
Who? The Monk.

692
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:33,676
The Monk? Can he play?

693
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,810
Well, they say he could have
turned pro before he turned mad.

694
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,246
How mad is he?

695
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,292
He's the Jock that even
the Jocks are afraid of.

696
00:47:40,335 --> 00:47:41,380
What did he do?

697
00:47:41,423 --> 00:47:43,425
Something very dark
up in Glasgow.

698
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:46,037
I heard he ate Hannibal the
Cannibal. Look, listen, Dan.

699
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,821
Let me tell you something.
Not even the pope

700
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,388
could get him
out of the special wing.

701
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:51,869
Well, Monk is in
the high-security wing.

702
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:53,609
So, do me a favor.

703
00:47:53,653 --> 00:47:57,396
Maybe I can help you
with Barry the bookie.

704
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,398
I'm listening.

705
00:47:59,441 --> 00:48:02,009
Bet the game,
your guards to win.

706
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:04,185
Price is right,
we make a killing.

707
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:07,362
You pay off Barry
and have some left.

708
00:48:09,277 --> 00:48:11,062
Take the missus to Malaga.

709
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:16,328
This is so illegal.

710
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:18,460
I think "criminal" is the word.

711
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:23,291
All right, big man?

712
00:48:23,335 --> 00:48:25,250
Sound. Um...

713
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:29,210
Danny Meehan, he's all right.
Know what I mean?

714
00:48:29,254 --> 00:48:31,473
He's got a wee favor to ask you.

715
00:48:31,517 --> 00:48:33,345
Hello, Mr. Monk.

716
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:35,956
Can you play football? Aye.

717
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,437
Good.

718
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,656
Would you like to play with us?

719
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,267
No.

720
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,055
We're playing the guards.

721
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:57,456
Aye. I'm with you.

722
00:48:57,499 --> 00:49:00,763
Sound. Thanks a lot, Mr. Monk.

723
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:03,070
Okay, let's try it.
Troj, you take the corner.

724
00:49:03,114 --> 00:49:05,029
Uh, it's my ball.

725
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:07,248
Mouse's ball, Troj. Whoo!

726
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:09,511
Whoo! Come on, Troj.

727
00:49:09,555 --> 00:49:12,210
Yeah, yeah. To me, Troj.
Whoo, whoo!

728
00:49:12,253 --> 00:49:14,690
It's Mouse's ball.
My ball. Whoo! Yeah!

729
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:18,390
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

730
00:49:20,522 --> 00:49:23,656
He broke my nose. Let's have a look.

731
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:26,224
Let me have a look. Ooh!

732
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:29,792
Welcome.

733
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:31,794
He did that on purpose.

734
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:34,014
No, he didn't.Yes, he did.

735
00:49:34,058 --> 00:49:38,192
Tell him... Tell him
it was an accident.

736
00:49:41,065 --> 00:49:43,589
All right, it was an accident.

737
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:46,026
Now, get yourself
off over the back there.

738
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,506
He said it was an accident.

739
00:49:52,467 --> 00:49:54,010
You're not worried
about the opposition,

740
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:55,383
are you, Mr. Burton?

741
00:49:57,211 --> 00:49:58,473
A team of life's losers,

742
00:49:58,517 --> 00:50:01,694
led by a man who can be
bought and sold.

743
00:50:01,737 --> 00:50:05,306
I don't think so. Not when
the game's about character.

744
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:09,310
We'll give you a match.

745
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:12,313
You'll give us a game. I doubt
whether you can match us.

746
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:16,317
We'll see.

747
00:50:24,978 --> 00:50:27,807
One! Two! Three!

748
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:30,288
Look up! Pass it, pass it!
Look up again!

749
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:33,073
Well done. Nice and easy.
Let the ball do the work.

750
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:35,293
As the ball's
comin' to you, look up.

751
00:50:35,336 --> 00:50:37,469
Start again.
Spread out. Spread out!

752
00:50:37,512 --> 00:50:41,081
Left! Left! Up! Down!

753
00:50:42,343 --> 00:50:45,781
Strike! Strike! Up! Down!

754
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:50,090
Come on, Jerome. Come on!

755
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:59,360
Go! Go! One, two, three, four!

756
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:04,061
And left, and right.
And left, and right.

757
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:05,540
Hurry it up there!

758
00:51:05,584 --> 00:51:08,065
I told you two
to keep the center tight!

759
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:11,720
I've also always told you
to wear tie-ups on your socks.

760
00:51:11,764 --> 00:51:15,768
Now you, get over there and
mark up. And you, bugger off.

761
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:28,085
Four! Five!

762
00:51:29,434 --> 00:51:30,826
Now listen, Daniel.

763
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,655
I'm not putting you
under pressure, right?

764
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:35,788
But I'm burning up phone cards,

765
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:38,747
taking bets from prisons
up and down the country.

766
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:40,575
Oh, no.

767
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:43,100
And despite
what the governor thinks,

768
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:45,711
I'm betting us to win.

769
00:51:45,754 --> 00:51:48,192
So my arse is on the line.

770
00:51:48,235 --> 00:51:51,108
And by my arse,
I mean your arse.

771
00:51:52,544 --> 00:51:54,546
Okay, lads, need a volunteer.

772
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:57,549
Yep, Dan. Dan. Yeah, all right, Bill.

773
00:51:57,592 --> 00:51:59,942
Give Monk and Chiv a hand
with their demonstration.

774
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:02,119
Lovely. Cheers, Danny.

775
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:05,818
Aye, right, so, we are the cons,

776
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:08,299
and they are the screws.

777
00:52:08,342 --> 00:52:10,083
So, if anybody's
gonna play dirty,

778
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,172
it's gonna be they fuckers.

779
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,305
So, here's one
or two wee examples,

780
00:52:14,348 --> 00:52:16,133
just to keep us a step ahead.

781
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:19,440
Know what I mean? Numero uno:

782
00:52:19,484 --> 00:52:21,442
The accidental tread on the toe.

783
00:52:21,486 --> 00:52:23,836
It's an obvious one,
but it works.

784
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:30,321
Aw, fuck! Ooh!

785
00:52:35,108 --> 00:52:39,199
Right, daftie.
Run towards the Monk.

786
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:43,899
What, nowOn you go, half pace.

787
00:52:49,818 --> 00:52:51,646
The cunningly titled
"elbow in the face."

788
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:54,562
Very, very effective.
But you do tend to get sent off,

789
00:52:54,606 --> 00:52:57,478
so if you're gonna use it,
make sure the ref's not looking.

790
00:52:57,522 --> 00:53:00,002
Hold up. Hold up.

791
00:53:00,046 --> 00:53:02,048
What happened to number three?

792
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:08,489
When you're helping them up,

793
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:11,840
grab the hairs under his
armpits and twist them round.

794
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:16,062
Hurts like a bastard, don't it? Yeah.

795
00:53:16,105 --> 00:53:17,759
Number five.

796
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:19,631
Wait. Wait. I'm gonna
have a sit-down.

797
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:22,068
I don't wanna hog it.
Let one of these have a go.

798
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:23,551
- You're all right.
- You're the man.

799
00:53:23,591 --> 00:53:25,941
You're hard. Get in there.

800
00:53:28,944 --> 00:53:32,383
Yeah, as it happens, yeah.
No, go on, yeah.

801
00:53:51,402 --> 00:53:54,187
And finally,
the pièce de resistance.

802
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,538
Number 23.I can't.

803
00:53:57,582 --> 00:53:59,888
Monk, stop.
I'm in a bad way, mate.

804
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:05,372
Monk, I can't breathe!

805
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:08,941
Oh, fuck!

806
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:10,508
The Guillotine.

807
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:12,727
- Come on then.
- Let's move on.

808
00:54:12,771 --> 00:54:16,992
Get yourself up. You're making
the place look untidy.

809
00:54:17,036 --> 00:54:18,864
Was that all right,
though, Dan, yeah?

810
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:20,692
Cream. Well done, lads.

811
00:54:20,735 --> 00:54:22,433
Finish with a bit
of shooting practice.

812
00:54:22,476 --> 00:54:24,261
Troj, you come out
and lay them off.

813
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:26,393
Massive, marks out of ten.

814
00:54:29,744 --> 00:54:32,051
You done well with that lot.

815
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,402
Passes the time, Doc.

816
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:38,449
You know, it's not a crime
to admit enjoying it.

817
00:54:41,103 --> 00:54:44,150
You're becoming a sentimental
old fart, ain't you.

818
00:54:44,193 --> 00:54:47,327
Troj, go on, Troj, hit it!

819
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:50,156
That bloody Meehan.
Who does he think he is, eh?

820
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:51,853
Don't you worry about Meehan.

821
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:54,639
I've got something
sorted for him.

822
00:54:55,857 --> 00:54:59,296
Mr. Popular,
time to meet your friends.

823
00:55:00,732 --> 00:55:02,734
You can't put me
back on the wing, sir.

824
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:05,040
You scratch my back.
Sykes will fuckin' kill me.

825
00:55:05,084 --> 00:55:07,216
I'll scratch yours. Sykes will kill me.

826
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,654
You know the itch
I want scratching.

827
00:55:09,697 --> 00:55:12,700
I don't want Meehan
on that pitch. You understand?

828
00:55:12,744 --> 00:55:15,312
Okay. I know
what needs to be done.

829
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:18,315
Nice and easy.

830
00:55:20,142 --> 00:55:22,014
Right down the middle.

831
00:55:23,363 --> 00:55:25,409
And a-one,

832
00:55:28,499 --> 00:55:31,110
and a-two.

833
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:34,853
Good shot. Good shot.

834
00:55:37,203 --> 00:55:39,161
Where you been?
The governor's been waiting.

835
00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:42,774
Okay, miss.

836
00:55:42,817 --> 00:55:45,472
I've thought of a way
I can really help you.

837
00:55:46,778 --> 00:55:49,824
The sad old twat videos
all their games.

838
00:55:49,868 --> 00:55:51,348
Really?

839
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:53,350
And I've written some pointers.

840
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:54,675
My own little dossier
on the guards,

841
00:55:54,699 --> 00:55:56,135
like funny habits and that.

842
00:55:56,178 --> 00:55:57,832
I'm sure you'll find it
very interesting.

843
00:55:57,876 --> 00:55:59,921
Now can you hurry up?
We haven't got much time.

844
00:55:59,965 --> 00:56:02,402
Oh!

845
00:56:02,446 --> 00:56:05,579
Quicker! Oh!

846
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:10,584
One thing. This is strictly sex. What?

847
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:13,413
I ain't gonna respect you
after. I don't blame you.

848
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:15,197
Girls like to brag
down the pub as well.

849
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,547
I've heard.

850
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:23,684
What Easy.

851
00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:25,469
Change your oil, did you?

852
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:27,838
Gentlemen should never kiss and
tell, Massive. You know that.

853
00:56:27,862 --> 00:56:30,996
I think I'd better go home.

854
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,999
Massive, inside information
on the opposition.

855
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:36,218
Read it careful.
It's really important.

856
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:44,575
All right, Danny.

857
00:56:44,618 --> 00:56:46,490
There's a meeting now
in Mr. Sykes's cell.

858
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:49,057
All right.

859
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,813
All right, lads, a bit of windup
material on the opposition.

860
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:07,467
Ketch, this one's for you.

861
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:09,706
You know old Ratchett keeps
going on about his dodgy knee.

862
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,429
Yeah. Well, it's the right one.

863
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:21,742
This one is dynamite.
Marsden's daughter Donna

864
00:57:21,786 --> 00:57:23,285
has been known to dabble
in quite a few

865
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:24,789
different class A drugs.

866
00:57:24,832 --> 00:57:27,269
Let him know about it
at the right time.

867
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:31,622
- Here we go, Danny boy.
- Danny boy.

868
00:57:33,754 --> 00:57:36,409
And now for our secret weapon.

869
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,586
Danny, tape. Oh, shit. I forgot it.

870
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,458
Left it in me locker.

871
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:43,982
I'll get it.
I need a slash anyway.

872
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:45,984
Cheers, Doc.

873
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:47,202
Sorry, boys.

874
00:57:47,246 --> 00:57:49,335
That's all right.
Get the old boy working.

875
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:07,614
Danny, why did you do it?

876
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:11,662
Throw that game.

877
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:15,535
Fuck me, Jerome.
You do talk too much.

878
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:17,494
Sorry.

879
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:19,104
No, you're all right.

880
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:24,109
It's funny,

881
00:58:24,152 --> 00:58:26,546
but when you're in
that football world,

882
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,940
you just don't realize
what it means to people.

883
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:31,638
And you only find out
how disappointed they are

884
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:34,293
when you let them down.

885
00:58:34,336 --> 00:58:37,296
I was 16
when I signed pro forms.

886
00:58:37,339 --> 00:58:39,037
Thought I was the business.

887
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,562
Didn't take long for standards
to start slipping.

888
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:47,872
Cars, booze, bad tips
for slow horses.

889
00:58:47,915 --> 00:58:51,440
You think you can
handle it, then bang.

890
00:58:51,484 --> 00:58:53,530
Very soon it's handling you.

891
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:56,837
Before I was
picking up trophies,

892
00:58:56,881 --> 00:59:00,319
I was 425 grand down

893
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:02,843
to men nasty enough to...

894
00:59:02,887 --> 00:59:05,542
Well, they even would have
put the wind up Mr. Sykes.

895
00:59:06,717 --> 00:59:09,154
But they did give me
two choices:

896
00:59:09,197 --> 00:59:12,897
A wheelchair for life,

897
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:15,595
or a deliberate penalty
against the Germans.

898
00:59:17,031 --> 00:59:19,077
It's not as if I've prospered.

899
00:59:20,078 --> 00:59:22,080
Look where I've ended up.

900
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,651
But I'll tell you something.

901
00:59:27,694 --> 00:59:29,566
I didn't start off
as a youngster

902
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:31,829
looking to sell me country out.

903
00:59:33,308 --> 00:59:35,876
None of us planned
to be here, mate.

904
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,706
Away to fuck, man.
You're a hero in Scotland.

905
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:59,944
Sign it and I'll ship you
straight out of here.

906
00:59:59,987 --> 01:00:01,728
Okay.

907
01:00:01,772 --> 01:00:04,905
You know, even down here
it ain't safe from Sykes.

908
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:06,907
He's put a price
on your head, sunshine.

909
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:10,128
You know, killing Doc,
that was a big mistake.

910
01:00:10,171 --> 01:00:13,044
Fuck him.
Where am I off to, boys?

911
01:00:13,087 --> 01:00:16,569
The H.M.P. Silver Sands,
where all the toffs go?

912
01:00:17,962 --> 01:00:19,790
Heh-heh. Not exactly. No.

913
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,792
No? No.

914
01:00:21,835 --> 01:00:23,881
You're gonna catch
the ghost train out of here

915
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:25,622
to the funny farm.

916
01:00:25,665 --> 01:00:27,101
Ha-ha! The funny farm.

917
01:00:27,145 --> 01:00:30,278
Her Majesty's Prison Broadhurst.

918
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:33,151
What? I'm gonna get you!

919
01:00:33,194 --> 01:00:35,806
Yeah! I'm gonna find your house!

920
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:38,286
I'm gonna blow it up! No, you won't!

921
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,506
By the time the orderlies
are finished with you,

922
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:43,422
you won't be able
to blow your fuckin' nose!

923
01:00:49,123 --> 01:00:52,910
No! Let me out!

924
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:56,609
I'm gonna get you!

925
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:19,850
I reckon you're quits now,
old man.

926
01:02:18,517 --> 01:02:21,825
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

927
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:39,059
No, don't... Don't you
worry about the car.

928
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,279
I'd have my bloody house
on this one.

929
01:02:41,322 --> 01:02:44,499
Done deal, darling. Yes.

930
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:47,459
Wanker.

931
01:02:47,502 --> 01:02:49,461
Okay, gentlemen.

932
01:02:49,504 --> 01:02:51,811
You've got 90 minutes

933
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:53,813
to show them that when it comes

934
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:55,902
to physical and mental strength,

935
01:02:55,946 --> 01:02:57,643
they can't touch us.

936
01:02:57,686 --> 01:03:00,689
Most of them are gonna
want to mix it up out there.

937
01:03:00,733 --> 01:03:03,954
Don't get involved.

938
01:03:05,129 --> 01:03:08,306
All right, lads.
You wanna be nothing,

939
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:13,615
numbers, prisoners, that's fine.

940
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:15,269
If you win out there today,

941
01:03:15,313 --> 01:03:17,271
you'll have something
to remember forever.

942
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:19,621
You'll talk about it
over and over.

943
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:22,886
Because up and down the country
there are cons that are pig sick

944
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:24,757
about not being here today
in your shoes

945
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,282
just to have one crack
at those bastards next door.

946
01:03:28,326 --> 01:03:32,504
Let's win, and let's win well.

947
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:38,858
Lose, and they'll
never let you forget it.

948
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:40,512
Run your guts out,

949
01:03:40,555 --> 01:03:43,907
and you'll have something
in here they can never touch.

950
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:47,824
No parole boards, judges,

951
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:50,130
or nutcase governors.

952
01:03:51,697 --> 01:03:53,481
They've got one good player.

953
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:57,137
But he's had his moment,
and this is a team game.

954
01:03:57,181 --> 01:03:59,574
Now, ask yourselves
one question.

955
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:04,884
Are you ready? ALL: Yes.

956
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:06,886
Are we? MEN: Yes!

957
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:09,323
Well, come on!

958
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:12,413
So I'm lookin' at each
and every one of you lads

959
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:17,288
to get out there
and show them who's boss!

960
01:04:17,331 --> 01:04:19,986
Come on!

961
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:22,902
Hold up for Mr. Sykes.

962
01:04:25,296 --> 01:04:28,865
Doc was a different generation.

963
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,042
And he saved all his life.

964
01:04:32,085 --> 01:04:36,220
But before he died,
he had me sort out these.

965
01:04:40,398 --> 01:04:43,314
Come and get 'em, mates!

966
01:04:43,357 --> 01:04:45,011
Good afternoon. I'm Bob Likely

967
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,926
and you join us live
from the recreation field.

968
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,362
Yes, I'm Bob Carter.

969
01:04:48,406 --> 01:04:50,036
And thanks once again
to our esteemed governor...

970
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,583
Wanker.

971
01:04:51,626 --> 01:04:53,802
...for providing the splendid
facilities that are here

972
01:04:53,846 --> 01:04:56,631
:
as part of his progressive
rehabilitation campaign.

973
01:04:56,675 --> 01:04:59,417
For our captive audience,
here's a weather report.

974
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:02,202
It's a beautiful day. And what a day it is.

975
01:05:02,246 --> 01:05:04,378
And the waiting's over.

976
01:05:04,422 --> 01:05:07,642
Yes, the guards are out first,
fronted by Mr. Burton.

977
01:05:15,868 --> 01:05:18,784
And here comes the Mean Machine,

978
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:22,222
led out by our most famous son,
Danny Meehan.

979
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:24,746
Don't you worry, sir.
The boys are well up for it.

980
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:25,965
I'm not worried.

981
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:28,054
Where'd they get that kit?

982
01:05:28,098 --> 01:05:30,230
Cheeky bastards.

983
01:05:35,148 --> 01:05:38,369
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

984
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:51,077
Skip. Skip.

985
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:55,255
Your call.Heads.

986
01:05:56,343 --> 01:06:00,391
Heads we are then.Okay.

987
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:06,353
This is the one.
Take your chances.

988
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:08,921
Don't start anything.
If they do, finish it, okay?

989
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,968
Yeah! Come on then!

990
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,625
Simple ball every time, eh?

991
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,982
Boy, Mr. Sykes,
you look the part.

992
01:06:26,025 --> 01:06:29,550
All you need now is a...

993
01:06:29,594 --> 01:06:32,989
Here we go. It's the big one
we've all been waiting for.

994
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:35,600
Longmarsh prison guards
versus Longmarsh prison cons.

995
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:37,036
It's the cons to kick off.

996
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:47,438
Ooh! Ref!

997
01:06:47,481 --> 01:06:50,136
A free kick to the cons.

998
01:06:54,445 --> 01:06:58,014
Ketch has just
floored Mr. Ratchett.

999
01:06:58,057 --> 01:06:59,687
What's the matter with you,
you fuckin' mug?

1000
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,017
Shut up, you pussy.

1001
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,497
Ow! You fat bastard!

1002
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:06,239
Well done, Ketch.
Just be subtle.

1003
01:07:06,283 --> 01:07:08,633
Which one's he then?

1004
01:07:10,852 --> 01:07:13,333
Come on. take him out, son!

1005
01:07:13,377 --> 01:07:16,032
And Trojan evades
Marsden brilliantly.

1006
01:07:16,075 --> 01:07:19,165
If only he could have done that
the night he got nicked. Ha-ha!

1007
01:07:19,209 --> 01:07:22,168
Keeper plays it long.

1008
01:07:22,212 --> 01:07:24,605
Walker brings it down
to the halfway line.

1009
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:26,738
Oh! And it's a misplaced pass
to Jerome McFife.

1010
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:29,436
The ever-observant Mr. Burton
kicks it back to the guards.

1011
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,178
- It's a neat one-two.
- Walker to Burton.

1012
01:07:32,222 --> 01:07:36,313
Back to Walker. He shoots.
Ooh! Just past the post.

1013
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:39,794
And that was
too close for comfort.

1014
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:42,101
Too fucking close
for my liking, Bob.

1015
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:43,537
Get up there!

1016
01:07:43,581 --> 01:07:45,365
Monk plays it
out to Danny Meehan.

1017
01:07:45,409 --> 01:07:46,932
Meehan has it in the center.

1018
01:07:46,975 --> 01:07:48,847
Goes forward unchallenged,
it's a one-two.

1019
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:51,763
Ooh! And Burton has
taken Meehan's legs away.

1020
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:54,548
Meehan does not look happy. That's it,
Burton!

1021
01:07:57,247 --> 01:08:00,206
Now, what's the matter
with the rest of you, eh?

1022
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,555
You four stand there.

1023
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,254
Split on my run.
I want to try something.

1024
01:08:04,297 --> 01:08:05,864
Meehan to take it.

1025
01:08:05,907 --> 01:08:07,909
Looks like he might
chip this one, Bob.

1026
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:16,744
Oh!

1027
01:08:16,788 --> 01:08:18,964
Right at Ratchett's
crown jewels.

1028
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:21,575
It'll take more than magic
sponge to take the sting out.

1029
01:08:21,619 --> 01:08:23,969
Fuck me.

1030
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:26,406
For chrissake, ref,
that was bloody deliberate.

1031
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:29,496
Free kick. Handball.
Protect yourself at all times.

1032
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,238
You what? Ten yards!

1033
01:08:32,282 --> 01:08:34,893
Ten! Come away!

1034
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:52,519
Oh!

1035
01:08:52,563 --> 01:08:55,261
Right in his carrots and onions.

1036
01:08:55,305 --> 01:08:56,828
No nookie for Mr. Ratchett.

1037
01:08:56,871 --> 01:08:59,178
No nookie for
Mrs. Ratchett neither.

1038
01:08:59,222 --> 01:09:01,267
Play on!

1039
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,747
Just goes to show, Bob,

1040
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:04,923
lightning can strike twice.
Abso-fuckin-lutely, Bob.

1041
01:09:04,966 --> 01:09:06,640
Twenty-three minutes
of the first half to go

1042
01:09:06,664 --> 01:09:08,405
and it's getting
heated out there.

1043
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:10,494
Oh, yeah, Bob.
Very rock and roll.

1044
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,552
Fuckin' hell.

1045
01:09:25,596 --> 01:09:27,119
He's got to get back in goal.

1046
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,599
Well, I ain't tellin' him.

1047
01:09:37,782 --> 01:09:39,740
Piss off, you Scotch bastard.

1048
01:09:39,784 --> 01:09:42,656
How's your daughter, by the way

1049
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,484
Still hanging about
street corners and that

1050
01:09:44,528 --> 01:09:46,182
to feed the habit?

1051
01:09:46,225 --> 01:09:48,271
What's up with you?

1052
01:10:06,071 --> 01:10:07,333
For chrissake!

1053
01:10:16,864 --> 01:10:19,519
That's it, fellas!
Good teamwork!

1054
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:25,482
That is a hard
but a fair tackle, Bob.

1055
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:27,048
It was a fair challenge, Bob.

1056
01:10:27,092 --> 01:10:29,007
But that wasn't.

1057
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:32,315
This could be dangerous
for the cons, Bob.

1058
01:10:32,358 --> 01:10:34,012
A free kick here.

1059
01:10:34,055 --> 01:10:36,164
You're back in afterwards.
Don't think I didn't see it.

1060
01:10:36,188 --> 01:10:37,798
Ketch has took a strop.

1061
01:10:37,842 --> 01:10:39,844
And the guards look
determined to convert this.

1062
01:10:39,887 --> 01:10:42,760
Make it count! MAN: Get him!

1063
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,398
The Monk's collected it cleanly.

1064
01:11:12,442 --> 01:11:13,921
The Monk, calm and calculated.

1065
01:11:13,965 --> 01:11:15,880
Looks like the therapy's
paying off, Bob.

1066
01:11:15,923 --> 01:11:18,883
And, once again,
Monk's played it out to Trojan,

1067
01:11:18,926 --> 01:11:21,755
who's again
switched to the left.

1068
01:11:21,799 --> 01:11:23,757
He must be ambidextrous.

1069
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:25,761
I don't know about that,
but he can use both feet.

1070
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:45,997
Goal!

1071
01:11:49,653 --> 01:11:53,526
Goal!

1072
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:59,532
Yeah!

1073
01:12:01,665 --> 01:12:04,363
Beauty! You beauty! Go on,
my son! Go on, my son!

1074
01:12:11,979 --> 01:12:14,417
We're all over 'em.

1075
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,375
One-nil to the Mean Machine.

1076
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:17,819
LIKELY;
It's the guards to kick off.

1077
01:12:17,855 --> 01:12:19,335
It's getting tough out there.

1078
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:20,814
You can say that again.

1079
01:12:20,858 --> 01:12:22,381
It's getting
tough out there, Bob.

1080
01:12:22,425 --> 01:12:25,036
Never mind, Bob.

1081
01:12:32,043 --> 01:12:35,220
Oh, no, Bob. It looks like
the Monk's at it again.

1082
01:12:35,263 --> 01:12:37,396
Pass it!

1083
01:12:49,713 --> 01:12:52,150
Do that again,
I'll rip your head off.

1084
01:12:52,193 --> 01:12:54,065
Ref, did you hear that?

1085
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:58,852
I'm not worried.
He said it to you, not me.

1086
01:12:58,896 --> 01:13:00,506
Let's go, sonny.

1087
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:03,596
What is he doing? Well, don't ask me.

1088
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,686
You're the skipper.
You tell him.
Bollocks.

1089
01:13:09,863 --> 01:13:12,866
Hold on. Oi! You great fucker!

1090
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:15,695
Ooh, it's kicked off.
Let's just try and keep calm.

1091
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:18,045
Referee! Go on! Get in there!

1092
01:13:18,089 --> 01:13:20,439
Go on! Chin him!

1093
01:13:20,483 --> 01:13:23,007
This isn't a football
match! Do him! Do him!

1094
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:25,705
Go on, do him! Go on! This is bollocks.

1095
01:13:25,749 --> 01:13:27,925
Hey. Come on. Hit him! Fuck you!

1096
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:31,929
This is bollocks!
What the fuck's going on here?

1097
01:13:37,325 --> 01:13:39,110
Where the fuck are you, referee?

1098
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:42,330
Excuse me. Sorry.

1099
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:44,724
Calm down, everybody! Come on!

1100
01:13:44,768 --> 01:13:48,815
Ref, how long? Bollocks. That'll do.

1101
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:52,776
Halftime. Come on.

1102
01:14:01,915 --> 01:14:04,570
And what the hell do you
think you're doing?

1103
01:14:04,614 --> 01:14:06,485
You're supposed
to throw this game.

1104
01:14:06,529 --> 01:14:11,011
Yeah. The boys don't seem
to be taking much notice of me.

1105
01:14:11,055 --> 01:14:14,014
Youthful exuberance.

1106
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:18,541
Shame. Would have
worked out nice.

1107
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:21,457
What do you think Meehan
will be saying to the boys?

1108
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,547
He'll be telling them that
there's 45 minutes left to play.

1109
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:26,766
Yeah.

1110
01:14:28,115 --> 01:14:30,466
Well done. Well done.

1111
01:14:32,076 --> 01:14:35,514
- Settle down, boys.
- Have a listen.

1112
01:14:35,558 --> 01:14:38,299
We ain't won nothing yet.

1113
01:14:38,343 --> 01:14:39,562
All we got is one goal.

1114
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:41,302
This half is when
we're gonna earn it.

1115
01:14:41,346 --> 01:14:44,958
Midfield, tuck in.
Get round behind the ball.

1116
01:14:45,002 --> 01:14:48,309
Monk... Uh, good work, Monk.

1117
01:14:48,353 --> 01:14:50,877
Just don't leave us exposed
at the back, all right?

1118
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:55,012
Mouse... It's me nose.

1119
01:14:55,055 --> 01:14:58,276
Bill,
you come on for mouse. Where am I playing?

1120
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:00,496
- Take his place.
- Come midfield with me.

1121
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:02,236
Frenchy,
have a look at his nose.

1122
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,848
Okay, lads, we've botched it,
but we're 1-nil down.

1123
01:15:04,891 --> 01:15:08,112
When the overlap
comes... You think about it.

1124
01:15:09,983 --> 01:15:13,987
We're getting beaten by
a bunch of worthless criminals.

1125
01:15:14,031 --> 01:15:17,164
I'm doing
my half-time talk, sir.

1126
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:19,427
You sit down.

1127
01:15:19,471 --> 01:15:21,865
Have you forgotten who they are?

1128
01:15:21,908 --> 01:15:23,867
They're the dregs of society

1129
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:25,912
and they're in the next
dressing room,

1130
01:15:25,956 --> 01:15:29,481
and they're laughing at you
right now.

1131
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,745
Just remember this:

1132
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:38,011
every man here
is playing for his job.

1133
01:15:38,055 --> 01:15:40,536
Including you.

1134
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,544
You wanted to see me?

1135
01:15:48,587 --> 01:15:50,589
Yes.

1136
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:52,199
What the hell's going on?

1137
01:15:52,243 --> 01:15:53,592
You wanted a game.

1138
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:56,682
Yes, but you never said
anything about winning.

1139
01:15:56,726 --> 01:15:59,990
I never said nothing
about losing, either.

1140
01:16:00,033 --> 01:16:03,515
Before leaving us,
Nitro wrote a confession.

1141
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,213
He admitted to killing Doc.

1142
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:07,737
Said you knew about it,

1143
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,653
and that you sent Doc
to your cell.

1144
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:15,048
Now, that's accessory to murder.

1145
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:17,747
And that's 20 years.

1146
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,359
You'll never get that to stick.

1147
01:16:21,402 --> 01:16:22,578
One whiff of this

1148
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:24,580
will kill you
with the parole board.

1149
01:16:24,623 --> 01:16:27,452
Oh, you could be with us
for some time.

1150
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:31,891
So I think
it's in everyone's interest

1151
01:16:31,935 --> 01:16:34,590
if you lose this game.

1152
01:16:36,069 --> 01:16:39,290
I can't do that. Well,
you've done it before.

1153
01:17:01,704 --> 01:17:04,881
You had everything
they ever dreamed of

1154
01:17:04,924 --> 01:17:07,927
and you threw it all away.

1155
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:39,698
Meehan! Meehan has
given it away again.

1156
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:43,528
For fuck sake, Danny.
I was open.

1157
01:17:43,571 --> 01:17:45,661
I didn't see you.

1158
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:53,320
Looks like he's in
a fuckin' world of his own.

1159
01:17:53,364 --> 01:17:55,758
Wake up, Meehan!

1160
01:17:57,498 --> 01:18:00,197
- The ball's played to the left.
- Hibert picks it up

1161
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,504
and moves forward to the edge
of the 18-yard box.

1162
01:18:03,548 --> 01:18:05,332
The defender cuts inside.

1163
01:18:05,376 --> 01:18:08,118
He plays it neatly to Hayter,
who knocks it for Downes.

1164
01:18:08,161 --> 01:18:10,555
Oh, no! He's been
brought down in the area.

1165
01:18:10,598 --> 01:18:12,209
Could be a penalty.

1166
01:18:12,252 --> 01:18:14,994
- The ref's waved play on and...
- Oh, no, Bob.

1167
01:18:15,038 --> 01:18:17,518
What goes through Monk's
head? Scary thought, Bob.

1168
01:18:17,562 --> 01:18:20,173
Yeah, I'd hate to think
about what he dreams about.

1169
01:18:49,507 --> 01:18:52,510
It's getting
a bit naughty out there, Bob.

1170
01:18:52,553 --> 01:18:54,207
Positively brutal.

1171
01:18:54,251 --> 01:18:56,272
Don't know whether they're
fighting or doing a tango.

1172
01:18:56,296 --> 01:18:57,950
No, they're definitely fighting.

1173
01:19:19,972 --> 01:19:23,106
Billy the Limpet. He's chasing
the ball like a little terrier.

1174
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:27,327
Shame he ain't the skill
to match his enthusiasm.

1175
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:30,069
Shame he's fuckin' useless,
Bob. Abso-fuckin-lutely, Bob.

1176
01:19:41,124 --> 01:19:43,343
Ratchett's taken out cigs.

1177
01:19:43,387 --> 01:19:45,539
The guards aren't taking any
prisoners. You get it, Bob?

1178
01:19:45,563 --> 01:19:47,130
Whatever, Bob.

1179
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:58,228
Aah! You... Fucking watch it.

1180
01:19:58,271 --> 01:20:01,318
No, you fucking watch it,
you fat bastard.

1181
01:20:05,365 --> 01:20:07,890
That's going a bit too far,
isn't it?

1182
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:10,849
He took a dive!

1183
01:20:10,893 --> 01:20:13,373
Number seven, violent conduct.
Off the park.

1184
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:15,985
It was a dive! Look!

1185
01:20:16,028 --> 01:20:18,422
All right. Come on. Do one, now.

1186
01:20:18,465 --> 01:20:21,860
- It's a straight red.
- The cons are down to ten men.

1187
01:20:21,904 --> 01:20:24,123
It's an early bath for Raj,

1188
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:27,126
which is really gonna put
pressure on the Mean Machine.

1189
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:28,954
It's disappointing,

1190
01:20:28,998 --> 01:20:30,826
but you can be sure
it's not going to be easy.

1191
01:20:30,869 --> 01:20:33,306
- That's right, Bob.
- They're taking full advantage

1192
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,178
of the extra man on the pitch.

1193
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:39,443
Walker's through ball
to Mr. Gayle, who plays it.

1194
01:20:39,486 --> 01:20:41,271
And Hayter. And Monk!

1195
01:20:41,314 --> 01:20:42,881
Oh, superb save,
way down to his left.

1196
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:44,404
All right! All right!

1197
01:20:44,448 --> 01:20:46,102
- Twenty-nine minutes gone.
- Still 1-nil.

1198
01:20:46,145 --> 01:20:47,799
And the cons are holding out.

1199
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,280
And the Monk's gone on another
one of his walkabouts!

1200
01:20:50,323 --> 01:20:53,413
But this time he plays it safe
to Trojan out wide.

1201
01:21:01,508 --> 01:21:04,163
All Troj has to do is look
up. Come on. Pass it.

1202
01:21:04,207 --> 01:21:07,036
Pass it. Pass. Pass it. Pass it.

1203
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:09,603
Pass it. Pass it!

1204
01:21:09,647 --> 01:21:11,910
Pass the fucking ball!

1205
01:21:25,054 --> 01:21:27,186
Yeah! Yeah!

1206
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:29,972
Goal!

1207
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:31,712
Two

1208
01:21:31,756 --> 01:21:36,065
Ten men down, their liberty
taken away from them,

1209
01:21:36,108 --> 01:21:39,198
locked in a cell
for 23 hours a day,

1210
01:21:39,242 --> 01:21:42,375
and today
our boys have their day.

1211
01:21:43,768 --> 01:21:46,510
What's up with you?

1212
01:21:49,165 --> 01:21:51,950
For the last hour
of my life sentence,

1213
01:21:51,994 --> 01:21:53,865
I have been free!

1214
01:21:56,563 --> 01:22:00,263
Mean Machine, Mean Machine!

1215
01:22:00,306 --> 01:22:04,093
Yes!

1216
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:06,269
It's the guards to kick off.

1217
01:22:07,792 --> 01:22:10,360
Mr. Williams lays it back
for Mr. Hibert,

1218
01:22:10,403 --> 01:22:12,362
who whips a beautiful ball
into the box.

1219
01:22:12,405 --> 01:22:15,408
- Monk's got it covered.
- Safe as houses.

1220
01:22:15,452 --> 01:22:18,411
Oh, you've gotta love the
Monk. Gotta love the Monk.

1221
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:42,087
- What's Monk doing?
- He's left an empty net!

1222
01:22:42,131 --> 01:22:44,220
He's lost the fuckin' ball!

1223
01:22:44,263 --> 01:22:46,004
He's lost the fuckin' plot.

1224
01:22:53,316 --> 01:22:56,623
Guards' goal. Two-1.

1225
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:58,712
Yes!

1226
01:23:01,324 --> 01:23:04,240
Hey! Stop fucking about
back here!

1227
01:23:04,283 --> 01:23:06,677
Get the ball up the park!

1228
01:23:08,287 --> 01:23:11,073
All right. My fault.

1229
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,816
It's no longer
just a game out there.

1230
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:18,297
There's a match on now.

1231
01:23:20,169 --> 01:23:23,259
Have a word, Dan. Fuck off, Trojan.

1232
01:23:24,477 --> 01:23:27,437
Come on, lads. Let's go.

1233
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:32,442
The cons kick off.

1234
01:23:32,485 --> 01:23:35,619
But what is he doing?
He's given it straight away.

1235
01:23:37,664 --> 01:23:39,710
Oh! He's hit the bar!

1236
01:23:40,972 --> 01:23:43,018
You see? There's no cohesion.

1237
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:45,585
There's no character, eh?

1238
01:23:45,629 --> 01:23:49,154
The Mean Machine really need
their star player

1239
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:51,461
to pick up his game now.

1240
01:23:51,504 --> 01:23:53,724
What is Meehan doing, anyway?

1241
01:23:53,767 --> 01:23:55,465
It's like he's not even
on the pitch.

1242
01:23:59,251 --> 01:24:01,558
What's up with you?
I never touched you.

1243
01:24:02,863 --> 01:24:05,605
Looks like Danny's injured.

1244
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:09,479
You're cheating now, are you?
Once a loser, always a loser?

1245
01:24:09,522 --> 01:24:11,611
Dan, what happened?
Where'd you get hit?

1246
01:24:11,655 --> 01:24:13,004
Down there.

1247
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,658
Doesn't look too clever, boys.

1248
01:24:14,701 --> 01:24:16,007
I can't see anything.

1249
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,270
Come on. Let's get him up.

1250
01:24:18,314 --> 01:24:20,707
All right, ref. Come on, Danny.

1251
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:22,144
Don't put no weight on it.

1252
01:24:22,187 --> 01:24:23,536
Meehan is leaving the pitch.

1253
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,321
Lets hope they bring a sub on.

1254
01:24:25,364 --> 01:24:27,192
It's 11 against 9 out there.

1255
01:24:27,236 --> 01:24:30,195
Frenchy, I've got it. Get it fixed.

1256
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:31,694
Okay, Mr. Sykes.
We got it. We got it.

1257
01:24:31,718 --> 01:24:33,938
Shove up and shut up.

1258
01:24:33,981 --> 01:24:38,247
The guards are really
moving the ball about nicely.

1259
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:40,336
Oh. Neat passing.

1260
01:24:40,379 --> 01:24:43,774
But the cons are determined
not to give up.

1261
01:24:46,168 --> 01:24:48,735
There's nothing wrong
with that leg, is there?

1262
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55,046
Why don't people just
let me play this game?

1263
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,396
Didn't think you'd sell us out.

1264
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:01,096
Not after the big
"It's your time" speech.

1265
01:25:07,624 --> 01:25:09,843
Is there something
I should know?

1266
01:25:09,887 --> 01:25:12,411
He's fucked something up.

1267
01:25:13,369 --> 01:25:15,849
Could be a strain.

1268
01:25:24,902 --> 01:25:26,947
It's certainly
getting tough out there.

1269
01:25:26,991 --> 01:25:29,559
The guards are really
putting the pressure on.

1270
01:25:29,602 --> 01:25:31,604
Fuckin' hell, Massive!
Help us out!

1271
01:25:31,648 --> 01:25:34,477
We've only got nine men on!
Get a sub on!

1272
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,398
Walker to Marsden.

1273
01:25:48,012 --> 01:25:50,449
Downes wide to Hibert.

1274
01:25:50,493 --> 01:25:52,886
Hibert clips it forward.

1275
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:55,976
Walker brings it down.

1276
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:58,196
The cons are swamped
at the back.

1277
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,068
Ratchett's free in the area.

1278
01:26:03,245 --> 01:26:05,551
Yes! Yes!

1279
01:26:05,595 --> 01:26:08,946
Two-fucking-2.Good one.

1280
01:26:08,989 --> 01:26:10,991
Good one.

1281
01:26:12,776 --> 01:26:15,257
Thanks, Danny Meehan.

1282
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:18,216
Come on, lads.

1283
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:19,739
Two-2.

1284
01:26:19,783 --> 01:26:22,655
Right. Now a third.
Get up there.

1285
01:26:22,699 --> 01:26:24,788
Ref! Sub!

1286
01:26:34,754 --> 01:26:37,540
Mass, look... It's your life.

1287
01:26:40,456 --> 01:26:42,197
Referee!

1288
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,938
Ratchett just
brought down Billy the Limpet.

1289
01:26:44,982 --> 01:26:47,376
Now, that's like
kicking a puppy dog, Bob.

1290
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:55,471
Give me my boot.

1291
01:26:57,995 --> 01:27:00,824
Yes! Ref! Ref!

1292
01:27:03,392 --> 01:27:05,655
I'm coming back on. Sit the fuck down, man.

1293
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:08,353
Forget it, Meehan. REF: Who's coming on?

1294
01:27:08,397 --> 01:27:10,877
Him. I am.

1295
01:27:10,921 --> 01:27:12,879
You're playing like crap
and you know it.

1296
01:27:12,923 --> 01:27:15,099
Will you make up your mind?
Who's in charge here?

1297
01:27:15,142 --> 01:27:17,275
I'm the manager.
Danny's coming on.

1298
01:27:17,319 --> 01:27:21,148
Hold it! Listen, I'm the owner. You?

1299
01:27:21,192 --> 01:27:24,151
Yes. Yes. The owner? Behave.

1300
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:26,415
Manager's decision. You. On.

1301
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:32,682
The great Danny Meehan
returns to the pitch.

1302
01:27:32,725 --> 01:27:34,945
Yeah. That's all
we fuckin' need.

1303
01:27:34,988 --> 01:27:38,383
If he carries on playing
like he did before he went off,

1304
01:27:38,427 --> 01:27:40,864
we may as well
all go home now, Bob.

1305
01:27:51,527 --> 01:27:54,094
Ketch knocks it
out wide to Trojan.

1306
01:27:54,138 --> 01:27:56,401
It's amazing. The guards
are still finding it hard

1307
01:27:56,445 --> 01:27:58,273
to deal with this man.

1308
01:27:58,316 --> 01:28:01,580
I'm with you here
if you want! Yes, Troj!

1309
01:28:01,624 --> 01:28:04,279
Troj, pass it! I'm on!
Pass here!

1310
01:28:04,322 --> 01:28:07,456
Trojan plays it into the center.

1311
01:28:07,499 --> 01:28:09,153
I'm free there.

1312
01:28:09,196 --> 01:28:11,286
Yeah, well, I didn't
fucking see you, did I?

1313
01:28:11,329 --> 01:28:13,462
Oh, really.

1314
01:28:15,768 --> 01:28:18,902
Chiv! Chiv, lay off! Pass it!

1315
01:28:18,945 --> 01:28:22,035
Chiv, pass it! Pas...

1316
01:28:34,787 --> 01:28:36,876
That was a meeting of
minds. Not a pretty sight.

1317
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,837
It looks like Danny Meehan's
trying to redeem himself.

1318
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,319
He's gonna have to do a fuck lot
of work to manage that, Bob.

1319
01:28:44,362 --> 01:28:46,321
Danny Meehan is now everywhere.

1320
01:28:46,364 --> 01:28:48,018
He's bobbing and weaving, Bob.

1321
01:28:51,369 --> 01:28:53,415
No way was that offside!

1322
01:29:05,209 --> 01:29:07,429
Aah!

1323
01:29:09,648 --> 01:29:11,955
That's the way it's done, pal.

1324
01:29:11,998 --> 01:29:15,393
The ball's pushed
high into the guards' half.

1325
01:29:15,437 --> 01:29:17,787
Shoots. Oh, it's a goal!

1326
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:20,137
The Mean Machine
are out in front again!

1327
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:22,008
There's a flag.

1328
01:29:22,052 --> 01:29:25,272
Keep your shirt on, Bob.
Whoa, whoa. Something's up.

1329
01:29:25,316 --> 01:29:27,666
There's something going on, Bob. Ref!

1330
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:30,843
The Mean Machine
are still celebrating.

1331
01:29:30,887 --> 01:29:32,497
I think it's been disallowed.

1332
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:36,675
The ref has gone
to the linesman. It...

1333
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,721
There certainly is, Bob.

1334
01:29:38,764 --> 01:29:41,506
- They're conferring.
- Oh, surely not!

1335
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:43,290
Yeah, yeah.

1336
01:29:43,334 --> 01:29:45,554
If this stands, it's
a free kick to the guards,

1337
01:29:45,597 --> 01:29:47,033
35 yards out from the goal.

1338
01:29:47,077 --> 01:29:49,645
Get up, you bloody tart!

1339
01:29:49,688 --> 01:29:52,474
Aah! Easy.Okay. Let's get him off.

1340
01:29:52,517 --> 01:29:55,215
It's in a goal-scoring position
if I've ever seen one, Bob.

1341
01:29:55,259 --> 01:29:58,697
We're in the dying seconds
of the game. It's 2-2.

1342
01:29:58,741 --> 01:30:01,613
Lee, get changed.
You're on, mate. Ref!

1343
01:30:01,657 --> 01:30:03,398
Mr. Ratchett,
are you all right, sir?

1344
01:30:04,747 --> 01:30:06,923
Obviously not.
All right. Take him away.

1345
01:30:08,533 --> 01:30:10,709
Are you gonna do
absolutely nothing about that?

1346
01:30:10,753 --> 01:30:13,886
It's a free kick. Now take it.

1347
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:16,411
How long,
ref? Just moving into injury time.

1348
01:30:16,454 --> 01:30:19,631
- This is it.
- If he scores now, it's all over.

1349
01:30:21,067 --> 01:30:23,026
All right, Gaylie. Stick it in.

1350
01:30:23,069 --> 01:30:25,594
And Prison Warder
Mr. Gayle will take it.

1351
01:30:27,334 --> 01:30:28,945
He curls it.

1352
01:30:28,988 --> 01:30:31,426
It's heading to the top
right-hand corner, Bob!

1353
01:30:35,299 --> 01:30:38,128
No.

1354
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:20,099
Guards of Pentonville,
guards of Wandsworth,

1355
01:32:20,143 --> 01:32:22,014
Walton nick in Liverpool.

1356
01:32:22,058 --> 01:32:23,799
Policeman of Britain.

1357
01:32:23,842 --> 01:32:26,889
Traffic wardens,
parole officers, wheel-clampers,

1358
01:32:26,932 --> 01:32:30,240
your boys have taken
a hell of a beating today!

1359
01:32:30,283 --> 01:32:32,242
A hell of a beating!

1360
01:33:26,949 --> 01:33:30,517
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

1361
01:33:57,283 --> 01:34:00,765
Burning me head out!
Burning me head out!

1362
01:34:00,809 --> 01:34:02,898
All down, Danny. All down there.

1363
01:34:02,941 --> 01:34:06,292
Danny, you're all right. Danny, take that.

1364
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:08,077
Told you I wouldn't
let you down, didn't I?

1365
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:09,426
Well done, Bill.

1366
01:34:13,822 --> 01:34:17,956
Ruin my life, I'm gonna
fucking ruin your life.

1367
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,482
No. You're not stitching
anyone up. Not on my watch.

1368
01:34:22,526 --> 01:34:26,530
What are you gonna do about it?
Your job, your pension...

1369
01:34:26,573 --> 01:34:29,315
My ass.

1370
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:31,970
Good game.

1371
01:34:36,018 --> 01:34:38,150
Jesus! What was that?

1372
01:34:41,327 --> 01:34:42,677
Looks like your Saab.

1373
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,679
And what he said
goes for me and all.

1374
01:34:44,722 --> 01:34:47,290
And Barry the bookie too.

1375
01:34:50,597 --> 01:34:52,774
Nice one, Danny.

1376
01:34:58,257 --> 01:35:01,173
I want him in solitary

1377
01:35:01,217 --> 01:35:04,916
and I'm the governor
and that's an order.

1378
01:35:05,874 --> 01:35:08,050
Okay? Shut up.

1379
01:35:12,358 --> 01:35:15,100
Stick that
in your trophy cabinet.
