2
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:23,834
Sometimes, I get a good feeling, yeah

3
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,419
Yeah

4
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,215
I get a feeling

5
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,802
That I never, never
Never, never had before

6
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,512
No, no

7
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,765
Yeah

8
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:43,478
I just wanna tell you right now that I

9
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,107
I believe

10
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,903
I really do believe that

11
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:54,239
Something's got a hold on me, yeah

12
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,658
Oh, it must be love

13
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,871
Oh, something's got a hold
On me right now, child

14
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,706
Oh, it must be love

15
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,374
Let me tell you now

16
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,377
I got a feeling I feel so strange

17
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,214
Everything about me
Seems to have changed

18
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,189
Yeah, oh, it must be love

19
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,607
You know it must be love

20
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,108
Let me tell you now

21
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,986
My heart feels heavy
My feet feel light

22
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,906
I shake all over, but I feel all right

23
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,158
I never felt like this before

24
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,410
Angela Rose, do you copy?

25
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,579
- OK, copy.
- You guys coming in?

26
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:46,083
I never thought it could happen to me

27
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,211
Got me happy when I'm in misery

28
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,464
I never thought it could be this way

29
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:55,008
Love's sure gone and put a hurt on me

30
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,301
I said, oh

31
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,141
Hey, hey, yeah

32
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,060
Oh, it must be love

33
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,562
You know it must be love

34
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,189
You know it walks like love

35
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,571
I see you, Ruby!

36
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,948
I'm cutting off your ice.
I'm not a freaking charity!

37
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,491
It's coming!

38
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,034
How you doing, honey?

39
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,829
Hey, Ruby! I thought you guys
were fishing first ledge.

40
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,706
You done already for the day?

41
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,625
Piece of shit quotas.

42
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,002
Bullshit quotas, right?

43
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,671
What are you gonna give
on those haddock? 2 bucks a pound?

44
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,090
- $2.50. And I'm being generous.
- $2.50?

45
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,092
What are you guys getting at auction?

46
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,303
Calm your liver.
Let me worry about numbers.

47
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,596
Sign over here.

48
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,764
What're you gonna
take her lunch money too?

49
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,690
What a dick.

50
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,610
I keep saying, let's sell our own fish.

51
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,279
They tried it down the Cape.

52
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,156
That all went to hell.

53
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,074
So keep bitching. That'll work.

54
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,285
I got to go. Love you, Dad.

55
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,162
Don't forget about the doctor.

56
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,873
And the nets.

57
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,666
I know.

58
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,045
Bye, shit-face.

59
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,757
Bye, twat waffle.

60
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,091
That's good. It's a new one!

61
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,469
Gone and put a hurt on me

62
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,595
I said, oh

63
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,601
Hey, hey, yeah

64
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,770
Oh, it must be love

65
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,940
You know it must be love

66
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,108
Where the Bill of Rights protected people

67
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:40,364
from the federal government,
Amendments 13, 14 and 15

68
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,200
protected them
from their state government.

69
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:48,455
Sadly, there was no amendment
to protect the right to nap.

70
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,332
Ruby... Ruby!

71
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,626
What's wrong?

72
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,963
OK, let's re-read.

73
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,131
And we will resume this tomorrow.

74
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,883
You are free to go!

75
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,476
- Guess what!
- What?

76
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,645
I did it. I hooked up with Tiny Fingers.

77
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,605
Why?

78
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,066
I don't know!
Curiosity got the better of me.

79
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,651
Also, totally wrong!

80
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,237
Despite his tiny little
baby hands, it's...

81
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,739
Really?

82
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,867
Yeah, we have to change the nickname.

83
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,243
Do you smell fish?

84
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,793
Well, at least she's not
doing deaf voice anymore.

85
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,671
That's progress.

86
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,964
Hey, Audra!

87
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,634
Good. Just got out of music.

88
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,219
- What do you got now?
- Math.

89
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,683
So, the goal is to find the elective

90
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,476
that asks the least of you.

91
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,855
Like film club.

92
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,400
Also known as "put your backpack
down and go smoke a bowl."

93
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,696
Plus, Mr. Wabatch is actually
pretty hot, you know?

94
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,239
Like, in a Comic-Con kind of way.

95
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,741
Hi! Choir.

96
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,827
Choir.

97
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,662
OK, just fill this out.

98
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,747
Choir?

99
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,083
Are you high?

100
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,170
I sing all the time.

101
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,254
Thanks.

102
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,090
OK, you're already socially challenged
enough here, but sure.

103
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,053
If you start, you know, beatboxing

104
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,515
or doing that cup clapping thing,
we're done, yeah?

105
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,566
I don't need no words

106
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,193
Gave you first and second chances

107
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,237
You won't see no third

108
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,864
Flying down the highway
and that car looks like a blur

109
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,991
Turn it down!

110
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,326
That's just what you deserve

111
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,746
Black out on these haters
I never been a poser

112
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,665
She bragging, saying I date her

113
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,543
It's loud!

114
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,420
You didn't change after fishing.

115
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,339
You stink.

116
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,761
I love rap music.

117
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,598
My whole ass is vibrating.

118
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,352
Just drive!

119
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:26,572
It's definitely itchy as hell.

120
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,282
It itches.

121
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:33,704
My nuts are on fire.

122
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,624
His, you know...

123
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,380
They're like angry hard little beets.

124
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:48,635
Covered in barnacles.

125
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,554
I got it!

126
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,558
And your mother's got it even worse.

127
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,688
Like a boiled lobster claw.

128
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,774
Right, well, so the layman's
term for what you both have

129
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,984
is "jock itch."

130
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,695
It's common if you spend
a lot of time in damp clothes,

131
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,532
and it's easily
transferable via intercourse.

132
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,136
- You guys have jock itch.
- I'll give you an antifungal cream,

133
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,454
but you both have to keep the area dry

134
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,831
and avoid sex for two weeks.

135
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,710
You two need clean underwear.

136
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,420
And...

137
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,172
you're not allowed to do it anymore.

138
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:27,883
What?

139
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,260
For how long?

140
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,970
Never again.

141
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,222
Done for life.

142
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,769
Two weeks.

143
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,604
- Impossible.
- Can't do it.

144
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,925
Take those off. It's rude.

145
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,470
What's rude is how noisy you guys are!

146
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,973
I can't focus.

147
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,977
Go eat.

148
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:34,366
You know why God made farts smell?

149
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,913
So deaf people could enjoy them too.

150
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,092
Don't slouch. You'll get stuck.

151
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,802
Fifteen bucks, really?

152
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,805
You choose weed, I choose wine.

153
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,435
You don't want her! Swipe left.

154
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,937
None of them smile?

155
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,523
So? She's hot.

156
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,692
When I was modeling...

157
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,860
Here we go!

158
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,530
Yes! Your mother was the best!

159
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,908
First year I met her,
she won the Yankee Miss Pageant.

160
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,534
"she won the Yankee Miss Pageant."

161
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,703
Beat all those hearing girls.

162
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,664
She was hotter than all of them.

163
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,128
What about her?

164
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,339
So-so.

165
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:36,762
I thought we said no Tinder at the table!

166
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,350
How is music rude but Tinder's okay?

167
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,855
Because Tinder is something
we can all do as a family.

168
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,460
No, I did not tell you to sit.

169
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,712
On your feet, my friends. Up, up!

170
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,343
They made my latte with some kind of
disgusting nut milk this morning,

171
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,678
so I'm in a mood.

172
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,805
Hey, come on! Come on!

173
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,185
My name is Bernardo Villalobos.

174
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,312
Berrrnardo. Berrrna...

175
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,439
If you can't roll your Rs,

176
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,943
please, please, don't embarrass yourself,

177
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,736
and just call me Mr. V.

178
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,991
OK, all of you, on this side.

179
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,076
Come on, move! Everyone to this side.

180
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:42,870
Move!

181
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,999
Let's see if you're an alto, a soprano

182
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,251
or just watched too many episodes of Glee.

183
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,338
My birthday was last Tuesday,
so in lieu of gifts,

184
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,507
I will be accepting
the Happy Birthday song.

185
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,218
I do not need an entire meal.

186
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,180
I just want to place your voice.

187
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,390
You, Harry Potter. Come on, let's hear it.

188
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,149
Happy birthday to you

189
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,693
Tenor. Next!

190
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,198
Happy birthday to you

191
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,409
Alto.

192
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,369
Next!

193
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,832
Happy birthday to you

194
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,084
Happy birthday

195
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,045
To you

196
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,463
Happy birth...

197
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:39,092
day, Mr. Berrrnardo!

198
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:40,802
Happy

199
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,180
Bir... ir... ir

200
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,599
Happy birthday

201
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,685
To you

202
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,398
Suave.

203
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,068
- Thank you.
- Tenor. Next!

204
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,155
Come on. Yeah, you!

205
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,699
The red shirt.

206
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,330
Bless me with your birthday wishes.

207
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,088
Forget the words?

208
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:23,554
No, no, don't look at them.
They're not gonna help you.

209
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,098
Come on!

210
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,105
We have a runner.

211
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:17,482
Happy birthday

212
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:21,195
To you

213
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:26,241
Happy birthday

214
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:29,411
To you

215
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,873
Happy birthday

216
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:36,793
Happy birthday

217
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:40,547
Happy birthday

218
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:44,801
To you

219
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,692
The card was declined!

220
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,948
I'll move money around tomorrow.

221
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,324
It's embarrassing!

222
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,659
What do you want me to do?

223
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:12,621
I gotta pay for ice, fuel.

224
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,710
Maybe we should sell the boat?

225
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,129
And then what?

226
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,760
It's the one thing I know how to do!

227
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,808
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

228
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,021
Yeah, how it is, is I can
barely feed my family.

229
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,731
Yeah, I can't even maintain my boat.

230
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,774
- It's bullshit!
- Listen, just take it easy.

231
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,902
I'm just telling you
what's going on, all right?

232
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,321
The feds are insisting on at-sea monitors.

233
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,840
Observers are gonna come onto your boat

234
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,657
to make sure you're not
breaking any rules.

235
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,534
That's out of our pocket?

236
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:34,703
So, I gotta pay to have a spy on my boat?

237
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,246
How much is that gonna cost?

238
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,041
It's $800 a day.

239
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,543
$800 a day.

240
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:45,839
That's more than we make in a day!

241
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,549
Don't tell me. Tell them.

242
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,762
I've known you guys for years. Come on.

243
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:52,971
We're not making a...

244
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,224
Oh, for Christ's sake! I know it sucks.

245
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:04,733
Mr. V?

246
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,570
I'm meditating.

247
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,574
Two minutes to go.

248
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,452
OK.

249
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,488
Do you want me to wait or just...

250
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:38,100
Most people who are terrified of singing
don't sign up for choir.

251
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,981
Other kids make me nervous.

252
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,234
I used to get made fun of.

253
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:54,783
I talked funny
when I first started school.

254
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,746
You're the girl with the deaf family?

255
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,751
Everyone but you?

256
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:05,919
Yeah.

257
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,298
And you sing.

258
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,134
Interesting.

259
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:14,678
Are you any good?

260
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:16,847
I don't know.

261
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,685
Why did you run out of my class?

262
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,897
I got scared.

263
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,524
Of what? Other kids?

264
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,067
Maybe.

265
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,447
Or maybe finding out that I'm bad.

266
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,204
Do you know what Bowie said
about Bob Dylan?

267
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,834
"A voice like sand and glue."

268
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,922
There are plenty of pretty voices
with nothing to say.

269
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,091
Do you have something to say?

270
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,179
I think so.

271
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,555
Good.

272
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,767
Then I'll see you in class...

273
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,852
Bob.

274
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,904
Really?

275
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,782
Thank you! Thank you!

276
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,267
- Please don't!
- No, I really... It might be good for you.

277
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,292
Oh my God!

278
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,003
Hi!

279
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:34,383
Do you have a second to call Grandma?

280
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,593
Use the video relay.

281
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:40,055
It's awkward to talk to an interpreter.

282
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,307
I have a friend over!

283
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:45,310
Leave her alone. She's with a friend.

284
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,271
Damn, Leo got hot!

285
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,983
What? He can't hear me.

286
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,654
Does he work out or are those,
like, fishing muscles?

287
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,990
OK, stop. You cannot date my brother.

288
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,116
Why?

289
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,535
Because for you, dating just means sex,

290
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,371
which I don't even want to think about.

291
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:08,000
OK, I'm sure he doesn't need
his little sister protecting him.

292
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,127
Can you just go back to trying
to get with teachers?

293
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,588
- It's more entertaining.
- OK.

294
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,388
Ruby?

295
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,225
What the hell are we listening to?

296
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:26,560
The Shaggs.

297
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,981
This song is called My Pal Foot Foot.

298
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,484
Ruby...

299
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:35,736
Wait, wait.

300
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,237
My pal's name is Foot Foot

301
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,947
That's my favorite part, right there.

302
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,991
- No!
- Right there.

303
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,076
You find the weirdest shit!

304
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,411
I never find him home

305
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,496
Did you get this in the dollar bin?

306
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:48,957
Wait, I have a serious question.

307
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,584
What's the sign for...

308
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,462
for, "You're really smoking hot"?

309
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,546
No!

310
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,381
What about, "We should totally get it on"?

311
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:57,591
No!

312
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,177
Is it just... this?

313
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,430
Oh my God. No! Stop!

314
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,558
Then show me!

315
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,706
What's up with Gertie?

316
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:33,001
She just told me she has herpes.

317
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,968
Energy! Energy!

318
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:46,598
Let's get it on

319
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:50,018
Let's get it on

320
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,063
I'm falling asleep!

321
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,940
Let's get it on

322
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,650
Guys, sounds like a funeral!

323
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,735
Come on! Hey, hey, hey!

324
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,445
Guys, come on!

325
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,782
You're teenagers!
All you think about is getting it on.

326
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,162
Bob, come here! Come! Get up here.

327
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,082
Come on!

328
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:16,920
Come on, sing!

329
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:26,430
I've been really trying

330
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,599
No, no. No, no, no. No.

331
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,225
You're not breathing.

332
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:34,146
There's no sound without breath,
and none of you are breathing.

333
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,064
Fill your belly.

334
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:38,275
Fill it up!

335
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:41,195
Come on, that's not a belly!

336
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,447
This... This is a belly!

337
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,743
OK, follow me, follow me. Do this...

338
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:50,996
Remember the little dog, big dog exercise?

339
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,080
OK, little dog.

340
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,750
Do it, come on!

341
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:57,920
Push, push, push, push!

342
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:02,216
Medium dog!

343
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,218
Big dog!

344
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,225
You're embarrassed? Really?

345
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:14,937
Everyone, little dog, big dog!
Come on! And...

346
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:19,149
Pant! Pant!

347
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:21,151
Push! Medium dog!

348
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:25,364
Big dog!

349
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,700
Engage your core!

350
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,410
Blow it out!

351
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:33,580
Push, push, push, push, push!
Push! Push, push, push!

352
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:38,168
Engage your core! Push, push, push!

353
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:39,795
More, more!

354
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,965
And sing!

355
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:48,637
I've been really trying, baby

356
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,721
Yes!

357
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:55,727
Trying to hold back
This feeling for so long

358
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,479
Now we're talking!

359
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:01,692
And if you feel like I feel, baby

360
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,528
Come on

361
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:08,365
Come on

362
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:13,954
Well...

363
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,748
it's not sand and glue.

364
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,709
Go.

365
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,677
Shoo!

366
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:32,514
Ruby, Miles...

367
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,100
Come here, come here.

368
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,897
Today, if it's possible.

369
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,106
Thank you.

370
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,193
Do you guys know each other?

371
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,236
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

372
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,365
Yeah.

373
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:51,950
I need a duet.

374
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:54,286
I need a duet for the fall concert.

375
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,539
You're All I Need to Get By.

376
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:58,749
- You know it?
- Yeah.

377
00:24:58,832 --> 00:24:59,832
Know it?

378
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:03,295
Educate yourself.

379
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:06,965
We'll work next class.

380
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,848
-You're all
-Like the sweet morning dew

381
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:15,932
I need

382
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,184
I took one look at you

383
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,352
To get by

384
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,604
And it was plain to see

385
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,356
You were my destiny

386
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,482
You're all...

387
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,984
With my arms open wide

388
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,070
I threw away my pride

389
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:30,781
I'll sacrifice for you

390
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:33,325
Dedicate my life to you

391
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,994
-I will go where you lead
-Come on, baby

392
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:38,497
Always there in time of need

393
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,541
And when I lose my will

394
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:43,001
You'll be there to push me up the hill

395
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:47,381
There's no, no looking back for us

396
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,344
We got love sure enough, that's enough

397
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:54,054
You're all

398
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,681
You're all I need

399
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:02,563
800 for 3.

400
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:04,064
That's as good as I can go.

401
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,191
But I'll take 'em all, OK? Yeah?

402
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:07,401
All right.

403
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,404
Dad's out back.

404
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:11,488
What are you giving him?

405
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,574
Stop. I got this.

406
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,367
2.75.

407
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,580
I just heard Tony tell McKinney it was 3.

408
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:22,541
And his shit looks like
it's been baking in the sun.

409
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,127
Come on! It's 3,
or we take our catch back.

410
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,296
Ruby, get out of here. Out of here!

411
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,424
He's ripping you off!

412
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,185
We're out in public!

413
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:44,938
It's medical.

414
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,401
I don't think being deaf
makes it legal to spark a fatty.

415
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,153
What the hell was that?

416
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:53,989
I got the price up, didn't I?

417
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:57,993
I was handling it!
You made me look stupid.

418
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:01,580
No, you look stupid when Gio throws out
any number he wants

419
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,665
and you can't cross-check it!

420
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,334
Guys!

421
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,295
You want to fight,

422
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:12,466
go fight those assholes!

423
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:16,386
Our family sticks together.

424
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:25,896
I'd give my left nut to tell them
to go screw themselves.

425
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:29,650
So do it!

426
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,778
Who's gonna sell our fish?

427
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:34,321
Us!

428
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:53,799
Oh, it's your thing
Do what you wanna do

429
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:59,805
I can't tell you who to sock it to

430
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:04,017
It's your thing, do what you wanna do

431
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:09,857
I can't tell you who to sock it to

432
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,361
If you want me to love you
Maybe I will

433
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,575
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal

434
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,497
Oh, you need love now
Just as bad as I do

435
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:30,002
Makes me no difference now
Who you give your thing to

436
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:34,882
Oh, it's your thing
Do what you wanna do

437
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,595
I can't tell you, bop

438
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:42,055
Who to sock it to

439
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:56,153
It's your thing, do what you wanna do

440
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:57,279
Goodbye!

441
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,161
Miles, Ruby, we need to work.

442
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,001
Did you work on the song?

443
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:13,754
Good!

444
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,631
Blow my tiny mind.

445
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:18,300
Three, and...

446
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:22,054
You're all I need

447
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,351
To get by

448
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:30,270
Like the sweet morning dew

449
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:32,397
I took one look at you

450
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:33,524
And it was...

451
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:35,734
You did not work on this!

452
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,817
We did.

453
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:39,947
Just not, like, together.

454
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,490
Dios mio!

455
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:43,367
"Du-et."

456
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,952
It's in the word!

457
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,663
You must DU-ET together!

458
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,666
Face each other.

459
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:52,292
Come on, face each other!

460
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:55,629
You're afraid of her.

461
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,047
You're wise.

462
00:29:58,215 --> 00:29:59,842
Come on, he doesn't have piojos.

463
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,970
Guys! This is not
the Pledge of Allegiance!

464
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:05,973
It's a love song. A love song!

465
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:10,561
Try to imagine what it's like
to sacrifice everything for another human.

466
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:12,688
OK?

467
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,857
So, again?

468
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:16,775
No.

469
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:18,861
Of course, again!

470
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,196
You go first, Miles. OK?

471
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,700
Let's take it from the verse. Ready?

472
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,871
Like the sweet morning dew

473
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:31,164
I took one look at you

474
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,250
And it was plain to see

475
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,793
You were my destiny

476
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:35,878
Ruby!

477
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,005
With my arms open wide

478
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:40,424
I threw away my pride

479
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,634
I'll sacrifice for you

480
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:44,553
Dedicate my life to you

481
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:46,930
I will go where you lead

482
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:48,932
Always there in time of need

483
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:49,892
Together.

484
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:52,102
And when I lose my will

485
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,313
You'll be there to push me up the hill

486
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:58,901
There's no, no looking back for us

487
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:00,694
We got love sure enough...

488
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:03,030
Good, good, good. Stop, stop, stop!
Good, good, good.

489
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:06,825
In the chorus, try the harmony up. Go...

490
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:08,869
There's no, no looking...

491
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,579
Back for us

492
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:12,956
- Cool.
- Got it? Good!

493
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,374
I am not angry at this.

494
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,709
Go work and come back.

495
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,461
- All right.
- Thank you.

496
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:20,255
Try it on the guitar.

497
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:22,216
OK, I'll work on it.

498
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:30,516
You can sing.

499
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:36,480
I mean, you have no control,
but your tone is lovely.

500
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:37,648
Thanks.

501
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:40,692
It's my favorite thing.

502
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,572
What are you doing next year?

503
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:46,657
I don't know.

504
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:49,034
Working with my dad.

505
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:51,578
No college?

506
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:53,121
I'm not good at school.

507
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:59,837
Miles is auditioning
for Berklee College of Music.

508
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,089
I've been coaching him for his audition.

509
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:06,426
What? You don't know Berklee?

510
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:08,971
I've heard of it.

511
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:10,055
Come on!

512
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:12,766
I grew up in Mexico City,
and even I knew Berklee.

513
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,310
Abe Laboriel,
the famous bassist, went there.

514
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:17,062
I did too.

515
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:19,398
I can't afford school.

516
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:21,733
They have scholarships.

517
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:31,410
How do you feel when you sing?

518
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,793
I don't know.

519
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:42,629
It's hard to explain.

520
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:46,633
Try.

521
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:39,853
You would need to sight-read
and learn a classical piece.

522
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:43,106
I need your nights and weekends.

523
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,859
I do not waste my time.

524
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:47,819
So if I'm offering,

525
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:50,614
it's because I hear something.

526
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,094
I joined the choir.

527
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,347
Why?

528
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,766
I like to sing.

529
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:26,775
What?

530
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:32,739
You're a teenager.

531
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:39,788
If I was blind, would you want to paint?

532
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,958
Why is it always about you?

533
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:47,754
I'm meeting people. I'm making friends.

534
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:51,341
You know what?

535
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:53,677
You should get out in the world too.

536
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,803
Hey!

537
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,702
We should do a co-op.

538
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,955
Look, there's empty warehouses everywhere.

539
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:25,709
We could organize a business.

540
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,253
Get the other boats on board.

541
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:29,379
How?

542
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:31,423
Who's gonna support us?

543
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,176
We're the deaf guys!

544
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:39,097
They look at us like we're a joke.

545
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:41,850
Hey! I'm going to Pratty's
for a brew. Who wants to go?

546
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,143
- I'm in!
- I'm in!

547
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:46,271
I'm gonna go with them.

548
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:48,524
You want me to text Ruby?

549
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:49,942
No.

550
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:52,736
I'm a grown man!

551
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:55,656
Come on, kid!

552
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,037
Hooks his arm around the pole...

553
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,081
Bear hugging it.

554
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,583
But when he does, he loses his pants.

555
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:07,918
They go down to his knees.

556
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:09,419
No word of a lie!

557
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:10,796
There he is hanging

558
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:13,257
with his milky white,
ginger ass hanging out.

559
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,093
He's still thirty feet from the pole!

560
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:20,764
But of course, he's shit-faced.

561
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,141
Shocker!

562
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:31,650
I'm good! Crashing into shit!

563
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:36,196
Oh, shit!

564
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:40,701
Yeah? What is that?

565
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:44,371
- Don't...
- Get out of my face.

566
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:48,166
Get out of my face, freak!

567
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,003
Don't, don't!

568
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:03,182
Take it outside! Take it outside!

569
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:05,267
Let's get out of here!

570
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,111
Want some ice for your eye?

571
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:24,411
Yeah, yeah.

572
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:46,743
At least they support you,
right? Your music?

573
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:49,246
Well, my dad insists
guitar is a waste of time

574
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:51,498
because it's not a true string instrument.

575
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:53,250
They suck the fun right out of it.

576
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:58,881
I'm sorry about all this.
My house is kind of gross.

577
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:00,424
It's cool.

578
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:10,851
No way! The Shaggs?

579
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,645
I'm really just here
to steal these ladies.

580
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:19,651
God!

581
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,945
I can't believe this actually works!

582
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:23,405
It sounds like shit.

583
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:25,115
But so does my stereo.

584
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:27,993
My mom thought it was a waste of money.

585
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:30,162
It was $2 from Goodwill.

586
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:32,247
Do they, like...

587
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:36,001
Do they, like, even get what music is?

588
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:39,546
My dad really likes
gangster rap 'cause of the bass.

589
00:39:45,594 --> 00:39:48,639
When we were little,
I used to see you guys in town.

590
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:51,517
Yeah. We were hard to miss.

591
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,895
There was this one time...
I think it was, like, 3rd grade...

592
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:56,897
you were at the Seaport Grill,

593
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,399
and you were ordering for your parents.

594
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:03,737
And you were talking to the waiter
like a total baller.

595
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,406
And then you ordered two beers.

596
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,075
I thought it was so cool.

597
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:09,618
Really?

598
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:12,996
Yeah.

599
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,499
My parents wouldn't even
let me ride the bus by myself.

600
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,251
They're weird.

601
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:19,711
And they hate each other, so there's that.

602
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:28,804
So, how should we do this?

603
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,681
Stand?

604
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,517
Yeah, maybe we should, like,

605
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,561
I don't know, sing to each other.

606
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:51,618
You're all I need

607
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:58,166
To get by

608
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,919
Like the sweet morning dew

609
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:03,547
I took one look at you

610
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,799
And it was plain to see

611
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:07,926
You were my destiny

612
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,013
With my arms open wide

613
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:13,182
I threw away my pride

614
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:14,600
I'll sac...

615
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:16,602
I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry.

616
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:18,270
This is super weird.

617
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,105
OK.

618
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:21,565
I don't know where to look.

619
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:27,029
Well, do you want to try,
like, going back to back?

620
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,447
Yeah, please.

621
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:30,532
All right.

622
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:42,503
You're all I need

623
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:48,509
To get by

624
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:51,637
Like the sweet morning dew

625
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,181
I took one look at you

626
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:56,558
And it was plain to see

627
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:59,394
You were my destiny

628
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:01,813
With my arms open wide

629
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:04,274
I threw away my pride

630
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:06,735
I'll sacrifice for you

631
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:09,446
Dedicate my life to you

632
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,990
I will go where you lead

633
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:14,493
Always there in time of need

634
00:42:14,576 --> 00:42:16,828
And when I lose my will

635
00:42:16,912 --> 00:42:19,540
You'll be there to push me up the hill

636
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:24,503
There's no, no looking back for us

637
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:28,882
We got love sure enough, that's enough

638
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:31,093
You're all

639
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:36,181
All that I need to get by

640
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:42,855
Like an eagle protects his nest

641
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:45,315
For you I'll do my best

642
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,484
Stand by you like a tree

643
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:50,070
And dare anybody to try to move me

644
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:52,739
Darling, in you I found

645
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:55,117
Strength when I was torn down

646
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:57,661
Don't know what's in store

647
00:42:57,744 --> 00:43:00,372
But together we can open any door

648
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:02,457
Just to do what's good for you

649
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,876
Inspire you...

650
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,253
What's that?

651
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:10,424
Is that your mom?

652
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:14,803
Is she OK?

653
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,372
We need to discuss this.

654
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:44,583
No, we don't.

655
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,460
We had no idea you were home.

656
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:49,922
The doctor said you're not even
supposed to have sex!

657
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:52,382
Look at your mother!

658
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:54,134
Hot!

659
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:58,388
How am I supposed to control myself?

660
00:43:58,472 --> 00:43:59,890
Maybe I should go.

661
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:01,308
Sit.

662
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:03,519
OK.

663
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:07,523
I want to know what your intentions are.

664
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:09,107
Dad, no.

665
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:11,485
You two have to use condoms, okay?

666
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:15,989
Put a helmet on that soldier.

667
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:40,097
Oh my God! Miles, go!

668
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:43,100
You guys are the worst!

669
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:45,894
- Nice to meet you!
- Just please go.

670
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,401
I hate you!

671
00:45:02,244 --> 00:45:03,662
Honestly, good for them.

672
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:06,123
I don't think my mom's
had sex since my dad left.

673
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:09,042
Actually, that's not true.
Her divorce attorney.

674
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:12,713
It was so embarrassing.

675
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:15,299
I can't ever see him again.

676
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:16,633
Pizza.

677
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:19,094
I think it's fine.

678
00:45:19,178 --> 00:45:21,180
He's probably already forgotten about it.

679
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:27,603
It's very cold.

680
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:00,719
Hey, Ruby!

681
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:01,887
Get away from me!

682
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,889
Wait! I didn't do that, OK?
I didn't tell them.

683
00:46:03,972 --> 00:46:04,973
Yes, you did.

684
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:07,893
No. No, I didn't. I told Jay, one person.

685
00:46:08,894 --> 00:46:10,395
Come on... We were laughing.

686
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:11,730
I thought it was funny.

687
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:45,281
-They shake their heads
-Breathe!

688
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:48,392
They say I've changed

689
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,978
While something's lost

690
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:53,564
But something's gained

691
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:54,731
Breathe!

692
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:58,485
In living every day

693
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:00,279
I've looked at life

694
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:01,947
No, let it out! Let it out!

695
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,366
-From both sides now
-Don't hold it!

696
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:06,618
- From...
- Don't hold it!

697
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:07,911
Ruby, no!

698
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:10,789
If you're gonna pick Joni Mitchell,
you gotta sing it.

699
00:47:10,873 --> 00:47:13,500
- This is one of the great songs.
- Yeah, I know.

700
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:16,420
You either find a way to connect to it

701
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,297
or pick a different song.

702
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,673
OK, come on!

703
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:21,008
Shake your body! Shake it!

704
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:22,092
Shake your arms. Come on!

705
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,929
Now, sing back at me.

706
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:29,766
Mi, mi, mi, mi!

707
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:30,851
Come on!

708
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:32,728
Mi, mi, mi, mi!

709
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:34,438
No, no, you're holding it!

710
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:36,899
- I'm not!
- Yeah! You're trying to sound pretty!

711
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:38,525
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are.

712
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,320
OK.

713
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:44,239
You said when you started school,

714
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:45,782
you talked funny.

715
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:48,243
Funny how?

716
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:51,663
I talked like a deaf person.

717
00:47:51,747 --> 00:47:53,707
What does a deaf person sound like?

718
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:56,251
You know.

719
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:57,836
No, no. I don't know.

720
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,588
I want you to tell me.

721
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:02,216
Different.

722
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:03,717
Different how?

723
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,220
Like, wrong. Ugly.

724
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:07,387
"Ugly." OK.

725
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:09,223
Make an ugly sound for me.

726
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:11,683
- What?
- Come on! Yeah.

727
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:14,353
You think you were the only kid
who ever got bullied,

728
00:48:14,436 --> 00:48:16,355
who ever had a funny accent?

729
00:48:16,438 --> 00:48:17,856
Look in my eyes!

730
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,900
Push against my hands as hard as you can.

731
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:22,152
Push, push!

732
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:23,278
Look at me!

733
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:26,240
Make the ugliest, grossest sound
you can. Come on!

734
00:48:30,953 --> 00:48:32,037
No! Be a monster!

735
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:38,460
Now sing at me!

736
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:41,129
I've looked at life

737
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:43,590
From both sides now

738
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:46,009
From win and lose

739
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:48,637
And still somehow

740
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,181
Yes! That's it.

741
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:52,891
That's it!

742
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:55,310
That's what I was waiting for. Hey!

743
00:48:57,729 --> 00:48:58,730
Yes!

744
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:02,860
- Give me a break!
- You guys raise the quotas every year.

745
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,463
There used to be 100 boats in that harbor.
There must be 15 now.

746
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,924
Yeah, what are you doing?
Taking kickbacks from the government?

747
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:11,076
You want to control the fish, but you
don't know what's going on out there!

748
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:12,619
That's the point of the monitors!

749
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,623
- Right, a snitch!
- Hey, settle down. Settle down!

750
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:18,208
Let's be respectful.

751
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,335
We're out there to collect data!

752
00:49:20,419 --> 00:49:23,172
Yeah, well, your data is wrong, OK?

753
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:25,007
Sorry.

754
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,550
You gotta interpret. I'm lost.

755
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,759
You've tested?

756
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:30,637
Yeah! I see what's coming up
in my nets, you asshole.

757
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:34,933
We understand that the observers

758
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:36,685
are a financial hardship.

759
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:37,978
Really?

760
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:40,355
But it's critical to protect the fishery.

761
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,400
It's John's job to look out for the fish!

762
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:46,904
And as head of the council,
it's my job to look out for you!

763
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:48,280
Bullshit!

764
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:50,741
Like hell it is.

765
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:52,451
It's not the old days anymore.

766
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:56,163
Everyone has to make some sacrifices here.

767
00:49:58,373 --> 00:50:01,043
Guys, we're not the enemy here.

768
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:17,976
"Suck my dick!"

769
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:22,940
That's from him, not me.

770
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:26,360
Got a problem, Frank?

771
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,328
"We're tired of this shit, Gio!"

772
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:37,579
Yeah!

773
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:40,332
"You don't care if these guys
regulate us to death...

774
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:44,378
'cause you're the only one
making money here."

775
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:50,467
"No one's getting paid
what their catch is worth."

776
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:56,557
"My dad fished and his dad.

777
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:59,852
So I'm gonna fight like hell
to stay out on the water."

778
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:00,978
Yeah!

779
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,818
"Screw yourself!"

780
00:51:08,944 --> 00:51:10,404
"I'm done with the auction."

781
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:13,198
Yeah? What are you gonna do?

782
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,419
"We're gonna sell our own fish."

783
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:27,796
Yeah.

784
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,631
"Any of you wanna join us?"

785
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:30,924
Hey, what is this?

786
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:38,223
"You like giving this asshole
60% of your paycheck?"

787
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:42,853
"Bring us your catch,
and we'll double what you're getting now."

788
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,523
Double it?

789
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:49,276
I have no idea.
It sounded good though, right?

790
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:53,614
What?

791
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:58,243
It just came out.

792
00:51:58,535 --> 00:51:59,620
I was in the moment.

793
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:02,122
How would that even work?

794
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:06,210
We get customers to sign up.
They buy fish right off the boat.

795
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,299
Do you know how much work that is?
There are so many steps!

796
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:14,551
I've looked into it.

797
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:17,971
There's no money for it.

798
00:52:18,055 --> 00:52:20,390
You do our books.

799
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:22,226
You could work with the other wives.

800
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,771
Those hearing bitches
want nothing to do with me.

801
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:28,690
Maybe if you didn't call them
"hearing bitches"?

802
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:30,817
And you! You hate people!

803
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:34,279
We could finally be part
of this community.

804
00:52:34,947 --> 00:52:36,073
We have our community.

805
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:37,324
Who?

806
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:38,825
Your deaf friends?

807
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:40,536
You see them once a month.

808
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:44,331
What's the problem? It's a great idea!

809
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:49,294
We can't talk to these people.

810
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:35,716
Breaking rocks in the hot sun

811
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:39,386
I fought the law and the law won

812
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:41,638
I fought the law and the law won

813
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:45,309
I needed money 'cause I had none

814
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:48,145
I fought the law and the law won

815
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:50,439
Get your fresh catch here!

816
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:53,567
Sign up now,
and get fish right off the boat!

817
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:56,028
Ocean to your mouth!

818
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:57,988
I guess my race is run

819
00:53:58,071 --> 00:54:01,033
She's the best girl that I ever had

820
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:03,785
I fought the law and the law won

821
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:06,038
Forte. Very loudly, fortissimo.

822
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:09,208
Softly, piano, very softly, pianissimo.

823
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:36,151
Hey!

824
00:54:37,486 --> 00:54:38,987
Ruby, come on! I said I'm sorry.

825
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:40,572
You're late.

826
00:54:40,656 --> 00:54:42,533
I fought the law and the law won

827
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:45,327
I fought the law and the law won

828
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,497
I left my baby, and it feels so bad

829
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,208
I guess my race is run

830
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:55,170
She's the best girl that I ever had

831
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:58,382
I fought the law and the law won

832
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:00,551
I fought the law and the

833
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:04,888
I fought the law and the law won

834
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:20,195
I fought the law and the law won

835
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:22,573
I fought the law and the law won

836
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:26,118
I fought the law and the

837
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:27,953
Get your ass inside!

838
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:33,458
I'm sorry. I'm gonna
have to call you back.

839
00:55:39,673 --> 00:55:42,092
That's the third time you're late!

840
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:43,844
It's only 20 minutes!

841
00:55:43,927 --> 00:55:45,637
I don't care if it's one minute!

842
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:48,473
It shows me that you don't
respect me or my time.

843
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:49,933
I have a lot going on!

844
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:51,602
Me too! Me too!

845
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:54,646
I have a whole life
that has nothing to do with you.

846
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:58,442
If you waste my time,
I will not work with you.

847
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:02,237
OK?

848
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:03,405
OK.

849
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:05,866
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

850
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:07,659
It better not.

851
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,077
It won't.

852
00:56:09,161 --> 00:56:10,162
OK.

853
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:25,511
You gonna avoid me until we graduate?

854
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:29,306
I wasn't laughing at them
for being deaf, OK?

855
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:30,599
It was the situation.

856
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:31,683
OK.

857
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:35,270
Look, I know it's not an excuse,
but it sucks at my house right now,

858
00:56:35,354 --> 00:56:37,189
and you've got this,
like, perfect life, and...

859
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:38,690
What?

860
00:56:38,774 --> 00:56:40,192
Your parents are madly in love.

861
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:41,985
They can't keep their hands
off each other.

862
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:43,445
- And your house is...
- Disgusting.

863
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:45,030
My house is disgusting.

864
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:46,949
It's not, OK? It's a home.

865
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:49,243
And you all work together and laugh.

866
00:56:49,326 --> 00:56:51,328
And my family's not like that.

867
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:53,539
And then, I listen to you sing, and...

868
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,459
I just do it 'cause it's expected from me.

869
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:01,129
You have no idea what it's like
to hear people laugh at your family.

870
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:02,798
You're right. I don't.

871
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:05,634
And have to protect them,
'cause they can't hear it, but I can.

872
00:57:05,717 --> 00:57:06,718
I know.

873
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:09,763
I'm sorry, Ruby. I am.

874
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:14,935
I'm a dick.

875
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:18,689
Can I make it up to you? Please!

876
00:57:18,772 --> 00:57:21,525
I'll text you every few minutes
until you agree to hang out with me!

877
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:22,776
That's psychotic!

878
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:25,487
OK, I will not do that!

879
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:28,448
I'm not gonna do that.

880
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,871
These foodie people will eat anything now:

881
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:36,748
heads, tails, all sorts of garbage.

882
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:39,835
Next thing you know,
fish dick's gonna be the new delicacy.

883
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:41,420
Fish don't have dicks.

884
00:57:42,421 --> 00:57:44,423
This is your last free batch, kid.

885
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:45,549
Yeah, I got you.

886
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:47,551
My fingers are falling off.

887
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:52,764
I can't fit all these in the car.

888
00:57:53,432 --> 00:57:54,766
We need a truck.

889
00:57:55,976 --> 00:57:57,811
Where are you going?

890
00:57:58,228 --> 00:57:59,730
I have my music practice.

891
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:01,523
You can't go.

892
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:07,154
What's this?

893
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:09,072
The news!

894
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:10,866
They're doing a story on the family!

895
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:13,202
Now?

896
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:15,370
I can't.

897
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:19,041
How are we gonna do the interview?

898
00:58:19,124 --> 00:58:20,459
I can lip read.

899
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:21,919
You're not going to get all of it!

900
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:23,003
This is important.

901
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:24,421
My stuff is important too!

902
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:25,672
Do it!

903
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:27,591
I can't!

904
00:58:28,759 --> 00:58:30,636
You want us to fail?

905
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:45,275
Hi! You must be Jackie Rossi!

906
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,360
Chet Turner!

907
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:50,531
"Hopefully, people will support us

908
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:52,366
and will buy their fish here."

909
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:57,371
That's great!
So, how does this program work?

910
00:58:59,665 --> 00:59:03,335
Basically, the fishermen are
at the mercy of the big guys.

911
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:16,598
The goal is to sell fish
directly to the people.

912
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:44,334
Mr. V!

913
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:47,754
Mr. V!

914
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:23,916
Is that yours?

915
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:32,883
I'm sorry.

916
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:35,802
I want to do this.

917
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:41,934
I don't think so.

918
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:44,353
Are you serious?

919
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:48,065
You have no discipline.

920
01:00:48,148 --> 01:00:50,734
You're late. You're unprepared.

921
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:53,445
You wouldn't last two days at Berklee.

922
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,907
Out! Go!

923
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:00,786
Well, it's not like that school
did you any good.

924
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:08,752
You have, what, 17 years on this planet?

925
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:10,629
You don't know shit.

926
01:01:11,296 --> 01:01:13,090
You want to know why I'm a teacher?

927
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:14,967
I'm good at this.

928
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,845
But I can't do my job unless you do yours.

929
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:20,639
And I certainly don't need
a lesson in failure

930
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:23,600
from someone who's too afraid to even try.

931
01:01:31,942 --> 01:01:35,195
I've never done anything
without my family before.

932
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:47,916
I want to go to college.

933
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:49,626
At Berklee.

934
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:53,589
Music school.

935
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:58,010
My teacher's been helping me
with my audition.

936
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,806
College? In Boston?

937
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:05,642
That city is full of assholes.

938
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:07,394
So is everywhere.

939
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:09,563
You can't go now.

940
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:11,231
We just started the business. With you!

941
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:13,442
That's all you care about?

942
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:16,445
Losing your free interpreter?

943
01:02:16,528 --> 01:02:20,449
You're an important part of this.

944
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:22,826
It's terrible timing.

945
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:25,746
There will never be a good time.

946
01:02:26,455 --> 01:02:29,583
I can't stay with you
for the rest of my life!

947
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:33,879
Nobody expects that from you.

948
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:35,547
I...

949
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:39,134
have been interpreting my whole life.

950
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:43,722
This is exhausting.

951
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:49,937
Singing is what I love.

952
01:02:51,897 --> 01:02:53,357
It's everything.

953
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:00,739
Did you know about this?

954
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:12,417
We can't let her go.

955
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:15,462
It's college.

956
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:17,005
It's not.

957
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:18,674
It's music school.

958
01:03:20,217 --> 01:03:23,512
And what if she can't sing?

959
01:03:24,555 --> 01:03:26,181
Maybe she's awful.

960
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:27,933
She's not awful.

961
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:29,351
Really? Have you heard her?

962
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,315
I'm worried. What if she fails?

963
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:37,484
I'm tired.

964
01:03:37,568 --> 01:03:39,152
I don't wanna talk anymore.

965
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:48,370
What do we do if she gets in?

966
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,956
Then she's gone.

967
01:03:51,707 --> 01:03:53,417
Our baby's gone!

968
01:03:54,459 --> 01:03:56,128
She's not a baby.

969
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:57,212
She's my baby!

970
01:03:57,296 --> 01:03:58,714
She was never a baby.

971
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:46,970
Where is Ruby?

972
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:48,889
She's pissed.

973
01:04:48,972 --> 01:04:50,349
Yeah, but today?

974
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:55,437
Is that the observer, seriously?

975
01:04:57,064 --> 01:04:58,148
Hello!

976
01:04:58,524 --> 01:04:59,942
I should make her jump.

977
01:05:02,277 --> 01:05:04,363
I'm Joanne Biles. I'm your at-sea monitor.

978
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:06,365
I'll be coming out with you today.

979
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:16,083
Could you help me with...
I don't think I can get across.

980
01:05:19,628 --> 01:05:20,671
Thanks.

981
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:36,770
It feels like it could be
rough seas today!

982
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:01,545
Should I throw her overboard?

983
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,639
So, you gonna murder me?

984
01:06:12,723 --> 01:06:14,224
I haven't decided.

985
01:06:25,027 --> 01:06:26,236
Really?

986
01:06:27,279 --> 01:06:28,280
No. No, no, no.

987
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:29,489
Just don't belly flop.

988
01:06:36,622 --> 01:06:38,457
- Come on!
- Are you crazy?

989
01:06:45,047 --> 01:06:46,089
That looks freezing.

990
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:47,591
Get in!

991
01:06:48,926 --> 01:06:50,052
Clear!

992
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:51,553
Incoming!

993
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:56,683
God, it's so cold!

994
01:06:57,434 --> 01:06:59,019
It went up my nose!

995
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,531
So, we good now?

996
01:07:12,824 --> 01:07:14,535
After we do the barge.

997
01:07:16,161 --> 01:07:18,455
Which one's the barge?

998
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:23,293
Wait, that's, like, 40 feet.

999
01:07:23,377 --> 01:07:24,378
Yep!

1000
01:07:37,975 --> 01:07:40,769
Hey, is the engine regularly maintained?

1001
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,689
When was the last time
that you had your engine checked?

1002
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:47,526
Yeah, it's loud. That's why I'm asking.

1003
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:08,589
Him too?

1004
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,322
Haven't kids, like, died doing this?

1005
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:35,424
It'll definitely flip
your eyelids inside out

1006
01:08:35,448 --> 01:08:37,492
and give you the worst
wedgie of your life.

1007
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:38,618
OK...

1008
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:42,872
Your legs are gonna start
shaking, like, cartoon style.

1009
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:46,001
So jump fast to save yourself.

1010
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:48,127
OK...

1011
01:08:48,795 --> 01:08:51,965
And there's a branch sticking out
about halfway down, so jump out.

1012
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:54,885
You're really selling this.

1013
01:08:57,513 --> 01:08:59,096
Is that poison ivy?

1014
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:05,145
Holy shit!

1015
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:07,481
OK...

1016
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:10,943
Should we leave a note

1017
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:13,028
in case people think it's a joint suicide?

1018
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:15,279
Nah, let's keep 'em guessing.

1019
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:22,120
Yeah, there's the shaky legs.

1020
01:09:25,207 --> 01:09:26,500
OK.

1021
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:28,877
One, two...

1022
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:30,295
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1023
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:32,296
Three! Saving myself!

1024
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:36,676
No!

1025
01:09:40,346 --> 01:09:41,932
Yeah! That hurt.

1026
01:09:50,858 --> 01:09:52,609
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.

1027
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:54,695
Fishing vessel Angela Rose. Coast guard.

1028
01:09:54,778 --> 01:09:57,322
25 off your starboard quarter.
Channel 16, over.

1029
01:09:59,825 --> 01:10:02,327
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.

1030
01:10:02,411 --> 01:10:05,247
Coast guard. 25, E21. 25, E21.

1031
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,958
Channel 16. Come in. Over.

1032
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:17,301
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.

1033
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:20,387
Coast guard. 25, E21. 25, E21.

1034
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:22,347
Come in. Over.

1035
01:10:24,474 --> 01:10:27,352
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.

1036
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:29,730
Coast guard 25. You are in violation of...

1037
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:38,989
You, sir! Sir, stand up!

1038
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:41,825
Drop the pick. Stand up!
Stand up! What's going on here?

1039
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:44,244
Why is no one answering the radio?

1040
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:09,937
Nailed it.

1041
01:11:12,189 --> 01:11:13,315
No!

1042
01:11:15,526 --> 01:11:17,110
- No!
- No, no!

1043
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:20,864
Check it out!

1044
01:11:23,617 --> 01:11:24,743
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1045
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:36,880
Yeah! No!

1046
01:12:28,056 --> 01:12:29,057
What happened?

1047
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,644
You didn't come to work.

1048
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:34,563
We're done fishing.

1049
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:36,481
They suspended my license.

1050
01:12:37,566 --> 01:12:38,734
Who?

1051
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:40,527
Coasties.

1052
01:12:40,611 --> 01:12:43,739
The observer saw we were deaf
and tipped them off.

1053
01:12:44,156 --> 01:12:46,033
Well, they can't do that.

1054
01:12:46,116 --> 01:12:47,910
We were just working

1055
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:50,913
and they came to board us. We didn't know.

1056
01:12:50,996 --> 01:12:52,122
I told you.

1057
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:53,415
You need a hearing deckhand.

1058
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:56,084
Yeah, that's you!

1059
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:57,211
You were that person!

1060
01:12:57,294 --> 01:12:59,505
I can't always be that person!

1061
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:01,840
She's right. We need another guy.

1062
01:13:01,924 --> 01:13:03,091
We can't afford it!

1063
01:13:05,302 --> 01:13:08,305
If you'd told me you weren't coming,

1064
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:10,766
I'd have figured something out.
But you didn't.

1065
01:13:11,475 --> 01:13:13,393
You're seriously blaming me?

1066
01:13:14,228 --> 01:13:16,230
Your father was counting on you.

1067
01:13:20,317 --> 01:13:23,111
No. Don't put this on me.

1068
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:27,533
It's not my fault.

1069
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:37,584
You failed to obey an order
by federal law enforcement

1070
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:39,336
to board your vessel.

1071
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,881
On top of that,
you were operating your vessel

1072
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:45,676
in a negligent and dangerous manner

1073
01:13:45,759 --> 01:13:48,470
due to your... disability.

1074
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:55,185
I have no choice but to administer
the minimum fine, which is $1,000,

1075
01:13:55,644 --> 01:13:59,773
and an additional penalty of $1,500.

1076
01:14:04,695 --> 01:14:09,283
We can't pay that unless
we can get back on the water.

1077
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:12,494
Officer, what do they need
to do to be able to fish again?

1078
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:17,291
You will be required
to have a hearing individual

1079
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:19,877
on board at all times

1080
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,797
to answer radios,
hear ship whistles, etcetera.

1081
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:28,510
We will be monitoring you regularly
to make sure you are in compliance.

1082
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:31,471
Do you have that person?

1083
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:56,038
I'll sell the boat.

1084
01:14:56,121 --> 01:15:00,209
Take the money we can. That'll be that.

1085
01:15:01,168 --> 01:15:02,419
It's fine.

1086
01:15:03,086 --> 01:15:04,546
I'll stay.

1087
01:15:05,714 --> 01:15:07,883
I'll work with you on the boat.

1088
01:15:07,966 --> 01:15:09,510
No!

1089
01:15:09,593 --> 01:15:10,677
Yes.

1090
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:12,804
We can't afford to pay someone else.

1091
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:17,809
And there's nobody that's
gonna know how to sign.

1092
01:15:19,478 --> 01:15:20,812
Are you sure?

1093
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,190
School can wait.

1094
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:27,194
I already decided.

1095
01:15:28,612 --> 01:15:30,072
I'm excited.

1096
01:15:34,952 --> 01:15:37,079
Oh, Saint Ruby!

1097
01:15:37,162 --> 01:15:39,373
We'll make a shrine to you on the boat.

1098
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:40,456
Wait!

1099
01:15:40,499 --> 01:15:41,500
She's trying to help!

1100
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,669
Well, thank God you have her.

1101
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:10,821
Don't kill me.

1102
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:18,495
I bought you a red dress for your concert.

1103
01:16:24,168 --> 01:16:26,837
If you don't like it,
you don't have to wear it.

1104
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:34,386
I'm really glad you're staying.

1105
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:38,640
Leo isn't.

1106
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:40,976
It's complicated.

1107
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:42,686
He feels...

1108
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:44,521
left out.

1109
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:46,899
That's crazy.

1110
01:16:48,233 --> 01:16:50,652
It's always the three of you

1111
01:16:50,736 --> 01:16:51,945
and then me.

1112
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:57,075
I get it.

1113
01:17:07,002 --> 01:17:10,714
Do you ever wish I was deaf?

1114
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:27,564
When you were born, at the hospital,

1115
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:31,443
they gave you a hearing test.

1116
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:37,407
And there you were, so tiny and sweet,

1117
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:42,204
with these electrodes all over you.

1118
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:46,667
And I...

1119
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:50,504
prayed that you would be deaf.

1120
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:55,676
When they told us

1121
01:17:55,759 --> 01:17:57,469
that you were hearing,

1122
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:00,222
I felt...

1123
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:03,517
My heart sank.

1124
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,768
Why?

1125
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:09,147
I was worried that we wouldn't connect.

1126
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:11,859
Like me and my mom,

1127
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:13,485
we're not close.

1128
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:17,906
I thought I would fail you.

1129
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:21,451
That being deaf would make me a bad mom.

1130
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:27,958
Don't worry.

1131
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:30,252
You are a bad mom

1132
01:18:31,003 --> 01:18:33,130
for so many other reasons.

1133
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:39,845
I know I drive you crazy

1134
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:42,598
with the clothes, the makeup.

1135
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:51,648
But honestly,

1136
01:18:51,732 --> 01:18:55,194
I'm happy that you know who you are.

1137
01:18:57,988 --> 01:18:59,489
You're brave.

1138
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:01,533
Not like me.

1139
01:19:46,662 --> 01:19:47,746
Get lost.

1140
01:19:48,413 --> 01:19:49,498
You hiding?

1141
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:52,376
Not very well.

1142
01:19:57,214 --> 01:19:58,215
You still mad at me?

1143
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:02,052
You can't fish full-time.

1144
01:20:02,135 --> 01:20:03,136
Why not?

1145
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:07,057
Gertie told me

1146
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:08,976
that you can really sing.

1147
01:20:09,476 --> 01:20:11,311
That's special.

1148
01:20:12,396 --> 01:20:13,981
You can't stay here.

1149
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:17,734
They'll keep looking to you
for everything.

1150
01:20:17,818 --> 01:20:19,820
What else am I supposed to do?

1151
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:22,114
Let me do this!

1152
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:23,407
I got this!

1153
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:25,242
I'm the older brother.

1154
01:20:25,325 --> 01:20:27,244
And I get treated like a baby.

1155
01:20:27,327 --> 01:20:29,872
I haven't been able to do a thing
with Fresh Catch!

1156
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:31,957
Because it all involves
talking to hearing people!

1157
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,917
So what? Who cares!

1158
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:36,962
You're so afraid that we'd look stupid.

1159
01:20:37,045 --> 01:20:39,673
Let them figure out how to deal
with deaf people!

1160
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:42,885
We're not helpless.

1161
01:20:45,804 --> 01:20:49,474
Our family was fine before you were born.

1162
01:20:53,187 --> 01:20:54,563
Go.

1163
01:21:04,781 --> 01:21:07,743
Come on. This is... We're not at Fenway.

1164
01:21:20,005 --> 01:21:22,925
OK, guys, you must be ready
to walk onstage in two minutes,

1165
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:25,052
or you're not performing, OK?

1166
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:31,350
Ruby.

1167
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:39,274
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

1168
01:21:39,358 --> 01:21:41,318
For those of you who don't know,

1169
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:44,530
I'm Bernardo Villalobos, the choir master.

1170
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,156
Can you read his lips?

1171
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,759
Most of these kids
call me Mr. V to my face.

1172
01:21:47,783 --> 01:21:48,825
Not really.

1173
01:21:49,535 --> 01:21:51,578
I don't know what they
call me behind my back.

1174
01:21:52,996 --> 01:21:54,224
But I'm very proud of this group.

1175
01:21:54,248 --> 01:21:56,291
They laughed.

1176
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:57,751
They worked very hard.

1177
01:21:57,835 --> 01:22:02,965
So I will shut up now
and let you see your children,

1178
01:22:03,048 --> 01:22:04,716
which is what you came for.

1179
01:22:21,608 --> 01:22:24,903
Ain't got no troubles in my life

1180
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:28,407
Ruby looks beautiful.

1181
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,200
No foolish dreams to make me cry

1182
01:22:30,284 --> 01:22:32,578
You have good taste.

1183
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:34,246
I'm never frightened or worried

1184
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:37,541
I like how her red dress
matches the curtains.

1185
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:42,087
I know I'll always get by

1186
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:44,965
-I heat up
-Heat up

1187
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:47,176
-I cool down
-Cool down

1188
01:22:47,259 --> 01:22:50,596
When something gets
In my way, I go round it

1189
01:22:51,471 --> 01:22:54,391
Don't let life get me down

1190
01:22:54,474 --> 01:22:55,851
She's good.

1191
01:22:57,561 --> 01:22:59,646
- She's good.
- No idea.

1192
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:01,857
- No, she said.
- Oh!

1193
01:23:09,031 --> 01:23:11,033
I got the music in me

1194
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:13,243
I got the music in me

1195
01:23:13,327 --> 01:23:16,371
I got the music in me

1196
01:23:21,376 --> 01:23:24,630
They say that life is a circle

1197
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:27,591
But that ain't the way that I found it

1198
01:23:27,674 --> 01:23:29,176
I found it

1199
01:23:29,259 --> 01:23:32,679
Gonna move in a straight line

1200
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:37,935
I leaned back on my radio

1201
01:23:38,018 --> 01:23:41,688
Some cat was laying down
Some rock and roll

1202
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:43,732
"Lotta soul," he said

1203
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:51,907
What's wrong?

1204
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:54,034
My buttons are off.

1205
01:23:54,535 --> 01:23:56,328
That weren't no DJ

1206
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:59,414
That was hazy cosmic jive

1207
01:24:01,917 --> 01:24:04,044
What do you want for dinner?

1208
01:24:04,753 --> 01:24:08,215
- Spaghetti.
- I'll have to go to the grocery store.

1209
01:24:08,298 --> 01:24:10,467
He'd like to come and meet us

1210
01:24:10,551 --> 01:24:12,719
But he thinks he'll blow our minds

1211
01:24:12,803 --> 01:24:17,057
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1212
01:24:18,225 --> 01:24:19,852
He's told us not to blow it

1213
01:24:19,935 --> 01:24:22,354
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile

1214
01:24:22,437 --> 01:24:25,399
He told me, "Let the children lose it

1215
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:28,110
"Let the children use it

1216
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:31,405
Let all the children boogie"

1217
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:15,449
And now I have a special treat.

1218
01:25:15,532 --> 01:25:19,244
Sometimes, you hear a voice, and
it reminds you to keep making music.

1219
01:25:19,328 --> 01:25:22,039
First song done, second song done.

1220
01:25:22,122 --> 01:25:26,627
Please welcome Miles Patterson
and Ruby Rossi!

1221
01:25:49,942 --> 01:25:54,655
You're all I need

1222
01:25:57,407 --> 01:26:00,536
To get by

1223
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:03,580
Like the sweet morning dew

1224
01:26:03,664 --> 01:26:05,916
I took one look at you

1225
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:10,379
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny

1226
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:13,674
With my arms open wide

1227
01:26:13,757 --> 01:26:15,759
I threw away my pride

1228
01:26:16,426 --> 01:26:18,595
I'll sacrifice for you

1229
01:26:18,679 --> 01:26:21,014
Dedicate my life to you

1230
01:26:21,098 --> 01:26:23,851
I will go where you lead...

1231
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:34,546
Go, Ruby!

1232
01:27:48,101 --> 01:27:50,521
Hey, Ruby! That was so lovely!

1233
01:27:50,604 --> 01:27:51,605
Thanks!

1234
01:27:51,688 --> 01:27:53,023
Bob!

1235
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:56,360
Great job! Great, great job!

1236
01:27:56,443 --> 01:27:57,611
Thank you.

1237
01:27:57,694 --> 01:27:59,196
Are these your parents?

1238
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:02,199
Yeah, Frank and Jackie.
And this is my brother, Leo.

1239
01:28:03,033 --> 01:28:08,205
This is my teacher, Mr. V. And his family.

1240
01:28:10,499 --> 01:28:11,667
Nice to fuck you.

1241
01:28:13,335 --> 01:28:14,795
I learned that on YouTube.

1242
01:28:18,507 --> 01:28:21,718
What? Isn't that, "Nice to meet you"?

1243
01:28:22,511 --> 01:28:23,512
No.

1244
01:28:24,304 --> 01:28:28,475
"Meet" is one finger, not two.
See? This is, like, the legs.

1245
01:28:28,559 --> 01:28:29,643
No!

1246
01:28:29,726 --> 01:28:30,978
No, no, no! I mean...

1247
01:28:31,061 --> 01:28:32,396
Oh my God!

1248
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:33,981
It's fine. I get it.

1249
01:28:35,023 --> 01:28:36,942
Nice to screw you too.

1250
01:28:40,737 --> 01:28:42,489
These are my kind of parents.

1251
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:45,409
Please tell them:

1252
01:28:45,492 --> 01:28:47,661
"Their daughter is very talented.

1253
01:28:49,246 --> 01:28:52,708
And they're making a terrible mistake
not sending her off to school."

1254
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:55,586
I'll just sign the first part.

1255
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:58,922
I'm meeting Miles at his audition
tomorrow. You still have your slot.

1256
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:00,883
- What is he saying?
- You have to stop.

1257
01:29:00,966 --> 01:29:02,551
OK, OK.

1258
01:29:02,634 --> 01:29:04,386
But thank you.

1259
01:29:31,371 --> 01:29:34,833
I'm gonna get some air.

1260
01:29:35,334 --> 01:29:36,502
Okay.

1261
01:29:48,889 --> 01:29:50,807
What's up?

1262
01:29:52,392 --> 01:29:54,311
Just thinking.

1263
01:29:58,023 --> 01:30:02,236
The stars here,

1264
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:07,241
they don't look as good as
they do on the water.

1265
01:30:22,089 --> 01:30:27,469
The song you sang tonight.
What was it about?

1266
01:30:33,934 --> 01:30:35,978
It was about...

1267
01:30:37,688 --> 01:30:41,108
what it is to need another person.

1268
01:30:44,236 --> 01:30:48,282
Can you sing it for me?

1269
01:30:49,283 --> 01:30:50,492
Now?

1270
01:30:50,576 --> 01:30:52,160
Please.

1271
01:31:03,755 --> 01:31:06,675
Like the sweet morning dew

1272
01:31:08,594 --> 01:31:12,431
I took one look at you

1273
01:31:13,432 --> 01:31:16,810
And it was plain to see

1274
01:31:16,894 --> 01:31:20,522
You were my destiny

1275
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:24,735
With my arms open wide

1276
01:31:24,818 --> 01:31:28,947
Louder. More!

1277
01:31:29,031 --> 01:31:32,075
I'll sacrifice for you

1278
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:36,455
Dedicate my life to you

1279
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:41,210
I will go where you lead

1280
01:31:41,293 --> 01:31:44,463
Always there in time of need

1281
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:48,050
And when I lose my will

1282
01:31:48,133 --> 01:31:50,969
You'll be there to push me up the hill

1283
01:31:51,053 --> 01:31:53,180
There's no

1284
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:58,769
No looking back for us

1285
01:31:58,852 --> 01:32:03,023
We got love sure enough

1286
01:32:03,106 --> 01:32:04,983
That's enough

1287
01:32:05,275 --> 01:32:07,736
You're all

1288
01:32:08,028 --> 01:32:11,949
All that I need

1289
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:18,247
To get by

1290
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:52,447
Are we fishing?

1291
01:32:52,531 --> 01:32:53,532
No.

1292
01:33:10,215 --> 01:33:12,301
You guys, this is ridiculous!

1293
01:33:12,593 --> 01:33:16,597
If we're kicking you out,
we're all doing it as a family.

1294
01:33:40,204 --> 01:33:42,122
Maybe over there?

1295
01:33:59,348 --> 01:34:01,058
I'm gonna park.

1296
01:34:08,774 --> 01:34:10,859
Look how they're dressed.

1297
01:34:10,943 --> 01:34:12,486
It's so different.

1298
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:15,531
It's fine. You look pretty.

1299
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:18,492
Hey! I'm here for my audition.

1300
01:34:18,575 --> 01:34:19,493
OK! What's your name?

1301
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:21,078
Ruby Rossi.

1302
01:34:22,746 --> 01:34:24,915
It looks like you're
about half an hour late.

1303
01:34:24,998 --> 01:34:26,416
Are you ready to go?

1304
01:34:29,086 --> 01:34:30,587
We roll deep.

1305
01:34:30,921 --> 01:34:32,965
I'm sorry. Your family
can't go in with you.

1306
01:34:34,216 --> 01:34:35,592
What did she say?

1307
01:34:36,093 --> 01:34:37,553
You can't go in.

1308
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,481
Ruby!

1309
01:34:49,565 --> 01:34:50,566
Hey!

1310
01:34:50,649 --> 01:34:51,525
You came!

1311
01:34:51,608 --> 01:34:52,776
Is Mr. V here?

1312
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:55,362
He just left. I can call him.

1313
01:34:55,445 --> 01:34:57,865
I texted him. How did it go?

1314
01:34:59,491 --> 01:35:01,034
I choked.

1315
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:02,160
What?

1316
01:35:02,244 --> 01:35:03,662
Ruby Rossi?

1317
01:35:17,968 --> 01:35:19,386
Hello there!

1318
01:35:19,469 --> 01:35:20,512
Hi.

1319
01:35:21,138 --> 01:35:22,890
You are...

1320
01:35:22,973 --> 01:35:25,392
Ruby. Ruby Rossi.

1321
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:29,146
OK, Ruby Rossi.

1322
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:31,857
Looking at your application,

1323
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:34,610
aside from your involvement
in the school choir

1324
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:38,530
and a very nice letter
from Bernardo Villalobos,

1325
01:35:39,114 --> 01:35:41,909
you don't have a lot
of history with music.

1326
01:35:47,164 --> 01:35:49,291
I don't under... Is there a question?

1327
01:35:59,635 --> 01:36:03,263
Let's go upstairs.

1328
01:36:13,857 --> 01:36:16,151
What is your first song today?

1329
01:36:16,735 --> 01:36:18,737
Both Sides, Now by Joni Mitchell.

1330
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:20,489
Do you have your sheet music?

1331
01:36:23,742 --> 01:36:25,827
I don't. I forgot.

1332
01:36:28,539 --> 01:36:30,415
Do you know that song?

1333
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,087
All right. You are just going
to have to sing it a cappella.

1334
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:38,841
OK.

1335
01:36:40,759 --> 01:36:42,594
I can accompany her.

1336
01:36:44,054 --> 01:36:46,306
Sorry for interrupting. Hi!

1337
01:36:47,432 --> 01:36:48,642
How are you?

1338
01:36:48,725 --> 01:36:52,646
I'm Bernardo Villalobos, class of '89.

1339
01:36:53,355 --> 01:36:54,398
Nice to see you all.

1340
01:36:55,774 --> 01:36:57,568
May I?

1341
01:36:59,862 --> 01:37:01,363
I guess so.

1342
01:37:01,446 --> 01:37:03,198
Thank you.

1343
01:37:03,282 --> 01:37:04,491
What is going on?

1344
01:37:23,886 --> 01:37:29,099
Rows and flows of angel hair

1345
01:37:29,183 --> 01:37:34,771
And ice cream castles in the air

1346
01:37:35,272 --> 01:37:37,107
And feather can...

1347
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:43,780
Sorry. My mistake.

1348
01:37:47,034 --> 01:37:48,827
Can we take it from the top?

1349
01:38:10,307 --> 01:38:15,270
Rows and flows of angel hair

1350
01:38:15,354 --> 01:38:21,109
And ice cream castles in the air

1351
01:38:21,193 --> 01:38:26,865
And feather canyons everywhere

1352
01:38:27,616 --> 01:38:30,911
I've looked at clouds that way

1353
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:37,668
But now they only block the sun

1354
01:38:37,751 --> 01:38:43,757
They rain and snow on everyone

1355
01:38:43,841 --> 01:38:49,972
So many things I would have done

1356
01:38:50,055 --> 01:38:55,477
But clouds got in my way

1357
01:38:56,019 --> 01:39:00,232
I've looked at clouds
From both sides now

1358
01:39:00,858 --> 01:39:03,777
From up and down

1359
01:39:03,861 --> 01:39:06,488
And still somehow

1360
01:39:06,572 --> 01:39:12,119
It's cloud illusions I recall

1361
01:39:12,202 --> 01:39:17,833
I really don't know clouds

1362
01:39:21,879 --> 01:39:23,714
At all

1363
01:39:27,342 --> 01:39:32,055
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels

1364
01:39:32,139 --> 01:39:37,394
The dizzy dancing way you feel

1365
01:39:37,477 --> 01:39:43,901
As every fairy tale comes real

1366
01:39:43,984 --> 01:39:47,946
I've looked at love that way

1367
01:39:49,781 --> 01:39:54,328
But now it's just another show

1368
01:39:54,411 --> 01:40:00,209
You leave 'em laughing when you go

1369
01:40:00,292 --> 01:40:06,340
And if you care, don't let 'em know

1370
01:40:06,673 --> 01:40:11,929
Don't give yourself away

1371
01:40:12,012 --> 01:40:16,517
I've looked at love
From both sides now

1372
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:20,187
From give and take

1373
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:22,314
And still somehow

1374
01:40:23,106 --> 01:40:28,529
It's love's illusions I recall

1375
01:40:28,612 --> 01:40:33,909
I really don't know love

1376
01:40:38,121 --> 01:40:39,498
At all

1377
01:40:43,252 --> 01:40:48,674
Tears and fears and feeling proud

1378
01:40:48,757 --> 01:40:54,304
To say, "I love you," right out loud

1379
01:40:54,388 --> 01:40:59,643
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds

1380
01:41:00,644 --> 01:41:05,649
I've looked at life that way

1381
01:41:06,441 --> 01:41:11,113
But now old friends
They're acting strange

1382
01:41:11,196 --> 01:41:16,702
They shake their heads
They say I've changed

1383
01:41:16,785 --> 01:41:23,083
Well, something's lost
But something's gained

1384
01:41:23,166 --> 01:41:27,629
In living every day

1385
01:41:27,713 --> 01:41:33,552
I've looked at life
From both sides now

1386
01:41:33,635 --> 01:41:39,183
From win and lose, and still somehow

1387
01:41:39,266 --> 01:41:44,646
It's life's illusions I recall

1388
01:41:44,730 --> 01:41:50,736
I really don't know life

1389
01:41:52,487 --> 01:41:58,785
I've looked at life
From both sides now

1390
01:41:58,869 --> 01:42:03,832
From up and down, and still somehow

1391
01:42:03,916 --> 01:42:09,963
It's life's illusions I recall

1392
01:42:10,047 --> 01:42:14,718
I really don't know life

1393
01:42:32,569 --> 01:42:34,279
Visit me in Boston?

1394
01:42:38,492 --> 01:42:39,535
I don't know.

1395
01:42:39,618 --> 01:42:42,329
You know, you're probably gonna
run off with some cello player

1396
01:42:42,412 --> 01:42:43,830
who wears a fedora.

1397
01:42:45,749 --> 01:42:47,334
Yeah, probably.

1398
01:43:05,143 --> 01:43:06,144
Ready?

1399
01:43:06,228 --> 01:43:07,688
Ready.

1400
01:43:10,357 --> 01:43:11,441
All right!

1401
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:16,989
Three, two, one...

1402
01:43:26,999 --> 01:43:29,126
You sure you don't want us to come?

1403
01:43:29,209 --> 01:43:32,546
- We can help set up your dorm room?
- No, no! Let's not make this a thing.

1404
01:43:37,718 --> 01:43:40,053
Bye-bye, ass monkey.

1405
01:43:40,554 --> 01:43:42,264
Bye, shit nugget.

1406
01:43:56,486 --> 01:43:57,487
Stop...

1407
01:44:28,435 --> 01:44:30,145
Wait, wait, wait! Stop, stop!

1408
01:44:59,883 --> 01:45:01,009
Go!

1409
01:45:01,033 --> 01:45:03,033
