2
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,161
What a quiet place!

3
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,249
Indeed yes, very quiet.
Very quiet.

4
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,418
There's your bathroom, Miss.

5
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,177
I see we have the same bathroom.

6
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,848
I think I had better
introduce myself.

7
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,976
I'm Vera Claythorne,
Mrs. Owen's secretary.

8
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,353
Oh. My name is Emily Brent.

9
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,816
Is there anything
you want, Miss?

10
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,986
Well, I'd like to see Mrs. Owen.

11
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:26,700
I'm Mrs. Owen's new secretary.
I expect you know that.

12
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,037
No Miss, I don't know anything.

13
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,456
Just the list of the
ladies and gentlemen

14
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,041
who are invited for the weekend.

15
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,460
Didn't Mrs. Owen mention me?

16
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,963
I haven't seen Mrs. Owen yet.

17
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,133
We only came here
a few days ago.

18
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,721
This is a large house.
What staff have you here?

19
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,307
Just me and Rogers, Miss.

20
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,243
Does Mr. Owen
know we've arrived?

21
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,580
- He's not here yet, sir.
- Where is Mrs. Owen?

22
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,665
They were delayed
in London, sir.

23
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,585
I got a letter.
They'll be here for dinner.

24
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,712
Eight o'clock, sir.

25
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:29,221
We tell the story in Ireland,
about the two Englishmen...

26
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,766
who were cast away on a
desert island for 3 years...

27
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,935
and never spoke to each other,

28
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,604
because they hadn't
been introduced.

29
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,022
I'm not English!

30
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,274
My name is Prince
Nikita Starloff.

31
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,026
Call me Nicky.

32
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,529
Well, that breaks
the ice, gentlemen.

33
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,198
I am Judge Quinncannon.

34
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:53,537
How do you do, sir.
I'm Dr. Armstrong.

35
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:57,374
My name is Lombard.
Philip Lombard.

36
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,211
I'm General Mandrake.

37
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,963
Sir John Mandrake,
isn't it General?

38
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,715
Some years ago,
I was called in consultation.

39
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,717
Your wife was ill.

40
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,804
My wife is dead, sir!

41
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,557
If you gentlemen will be
good enough to follow me,

42
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,725
I will show you to your rooms.

43
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,482
I'm afraid I didn't
catch your name.

44
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,484
- Blore.
- Blore?

45
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,573
- William Henry Blore.
- Oh, Philip Lombard.

46
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,658
I'm afraid you've
got the wrong bag!

47
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,077
You're very observing,
Mr. Blore.

48
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,747
C.M., Charles Morley.
An old friend of mine.

49
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,084
I like his taste.
I even borrow his clothes.

50
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,808
Oh excuse me, Doctor. I thought
that this was a closet.

51
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,935
It seems we are
sharing a bathroom.

52
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,104
Oh, I didn't know.

53
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,357
The only time I regret
being a bachelor

54
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,942
is when I have to
dress for dinner.

55
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,612
- Ah, let me help you.
- Thank you.

56
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,281
Do you know this part
of the English coast?

57
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,532
No. I can't say I do.

58
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,367
Something magical
about an island.

59
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,329
Yes, they're like
a world of its own.

60
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,873
How would you like to spend
your last days here?

61
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:23,668
Oh no thanks, I think a
weekend will be enough.

62
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,631
We all build islands
of imagination.

63
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,341
Represents escape.

64
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,134
Half of my patients are sick

65
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,220
because they're trying
to escape reality.

66
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,723
- Well, and what's your answer?
- Oh, I tell them fairytales.

67
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,559
I build them islands of
imagined security.

68
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,647
Don't you believe in
medicine, Doctor?

69
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,233
Do you believe in
justice, Judge?

70
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,909
- Mr. Blore?
- Yes?

71
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,078
The bathroom's yours.

72
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,477
- Do you think they're done?
- Done enough for them.

73
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,646
Ethel.

74
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,524
Don't stand there gawking.
Get 'em up.

75
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,402
Did you wash the
floor this morning?

76
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,280
Do you suppose I have
time for everything?

77
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,408
It's not right to go inviting
a house full of guests.

78
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,869
I'll talk to Mr. Owen
when he comes.

79
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,538
You tell him, we're quitting.

80
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:45,542
The agency didn't tell us the
house was so big and so lonely.

81
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,461
- You knew it was an island.
- Hmph! With only one house.

82
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,298
Makes me nervous. Here!

83
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,968
What they don't know
won't hurt 'em.

84
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,263
Everyone has to eat a speck
of dirt before they die.

85
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:10,859
Ladies and Gentlemen,
May I propose a toast...

86
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,571
to our gracious hostess,
Mrs. Owen.

87
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,325
Uh oh, Doctor! I saw you.
You drank water.

88
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,328
- That's bad luck.
- Water never hurt anyone, sir.

89
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,330
Especially in my profession.

90
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,499
Don't forget the
old proverb, doctor.

91
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,668
Never trust a man
who doesn't drink.

92
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,171
Sounds like the Bible.
Great book.

93
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:36,259
And now I give you our
charming host, Mr. Owen.

94
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,844
Jolly good fellow!

95
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:42,015
And I hope, sir, that will
conclude all possible toasts.

96
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,142
Tell me, Miss Claythorne,

97
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,436
why do they call this
place Indian Island?

98
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,063
I don't know.

99
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,107
Excuse me, sir, the boatman

100
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,943
told me it's because it's shaped
like the head of an Indian.

101
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,781
Oh, that accounts
for the little Indians!

102
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,032
- Indians!

103
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,702
We must have a toast, sir.
I drink to the Indians.

104
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,121
Each little Indian,
individually.

105
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,875
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Ten little Indians!

106
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,379
Ten little Indians!
It's like the nursery rhyme.

107
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,715
Ten little Indian boys
went out to dine...

108
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,551
one choked his little self
and then there were nine.

109
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,220
Oh poor little fellow.

110
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,889
Here's to him. And what
happened to the others?

111
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,392
Nine little Indian boys
sat up very late...

112
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,811
one overslept himself and
then there were eight.

113
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,062
Then what happened?

114
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,064
You will find the rhymes
on the piano.

115
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,651
Mr. Owen seems to be
fond of little Indians.

116
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,571
(Ten little Indians)

117
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,993
Eight little Indian boys
traveling in Devon.

118
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,331
One said he'd stay right there
and then there were seven.

119
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:53,586
Seven little Indian boys
chopping up some sticks.

120
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:59,426
Till one chopped himself in half
and then there were six.

121
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,350
Six little Indian boys
playing with a hive.

122
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:11,771
A bumblebee stung one of
them and then there were five.

123
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:16,609
Five little Indian boys
going in for law.

124
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:22,282
Now one got in Chancery
and then there were four.

125
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:30,039
Four little Indian boys
going out to sea.

126
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:34,627
A red herring swallowed one
and then there were three.

127
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:39,716
Three little Indian boys
walking in the zoo.

128
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,889
A big bear hugged one
and then there were two.

129
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,141
The place for nursery rhymes
is in the nursery.

130
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,977
Don't worry judge,
he's down to the last Indian.

131
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,481
Two Little Indian boys
sitting in the sun.

132
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:59,402
One got all frizzled up
and then there was one.

133
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:06,075
One little Indian boy
left all alone.

134
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:13,249
So he went and hanged himself

135
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,335
and then...

136
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,837
there...

137
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,675
were none.

138
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,684
Silence please,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

139
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,437
This is your host
Mr. Owen speaking.

140
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,357
You are charged with
the following crimes.

141
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,276
General Sir John Mandrake:

142
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,530
That you did deliberately
send your wife's lover,

143
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,282
Lieutenant Arthur Masefield
to his death.

144

Emily Brent:

145
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,453

146
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,539
of your young nephew,

00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,631
you did kill Mrs. Mary Cleese.

150
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,884
Prince Nikita Starloff:

151
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,303

Judge Francis J. Quinncannon:

157
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,820

for the death

158

by hanging of one Edward Seaton.

159
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,658
Philip Lombard:

160
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,911
That you are guilty of
the deaths of 21 men,

161
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,080
members of an
East African tribe.

162
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,332
William H Blore:

163
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,002
That by perjuring your testimony

164
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,421
you did bring about the
death of James Landor.

165
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,756
Thomas and Ethel Rogers:

166
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,925
That you brought about the death

167
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,096
of your invalid employer,
Mrs. Jennifer Brady.

168
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,183
Prisoners at the bar of justice

169
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:58,021
have you anything to
say in your defense?

170
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,622
Silence please, Ladies and
Gentlemen.

171
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,207
This is your host, Mr. Owen.

172
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,545
What's going on here?

173
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,381
What kind of a
practical joke is this?

174
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,966
It's on the record.

175
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,637
An outrageous lie.

176
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,063
It's called Swan Song.

177
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,566
May I ask who put it
on the gramophone?

178
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,485
- I did, sir.
- Why?

179
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,988
I didn't know what it was.
On my oath I didn't know! I...

180
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,991
I was just obeying orders, sir.
That's all.

181
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,577
- Who's orders?
- Mr. Owen's.

182
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,163
Now let's get this quite clear.

183
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,667
Mr. Owen's orders
were what exactly?

184
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,379
To put the record on at
9 o'clock. It was sealed up.

185
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,839
I... I thought it was
just a piece of music.

186
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,092
It's the truth, sir!

187
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,178
I haven't seen Mr. Owen.
I was telling my wife.

188
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,431
I told you we shouldn't have
come here! I want to get away!

189
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,434
- I won't touch that money!
- Shut up!

190
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,271
First thing to do, Rogers,
is to get your wife to bed.

191
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,737
May I have your
attention please.

192
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,866
This letter to Rogers
is signed by Mr. U N Owen.

193
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,620
I must confess I don't
know Mr. Owen personally.

194
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,206
What kind of a man is he?

195
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,295
Who knows him?

196
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,385
Ha ha. You all came to a house
and you don't know the host!

197
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,887
What about yourself,
Your Highness?

198
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:59,225
Oh, with me, it's different.
I am a professional guest.

199
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,812
I knew we shouldn't
have come here!

200
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,147
Quiet, Ethel!

201
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,649
I knew somebody would
find out about it some day!

202
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,818
- I told you!
- Shut up, I tell you!

203
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,989
She's quite out of
her head, Doctor.

204
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:19,912
Hysteria induced by shock.
Give her this sedative.

205
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,082
10 drops in half
a glass of water.

206
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,917
Yes, sir.

207
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,336
If she doesn't sleep, repeat
the dose in 2 hours.

208
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,548
Oh, I hope she'll sleep, Doctor.

209
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:38,431
Dr. Armstrong, we've taken all
the evidence except your own.

210
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,850
What's your reason
for being here?

211
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,770
Quite frankly, I came
here professionally.

212
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:47,774
I received a letter from
Mr. Owen, asking me to come here

213
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,109
and spend the weekend
and pretend to be a guest

214
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,780
so that I might examine his wife
who had refused to see a doctor.

215
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,199
I'll summarize our findings.

216
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,620
We've all received letters
from old trusted friends.

217
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,956
Inviting us to spend
the weekend here.

218
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,375
As guests of their
friends, the Owens.

219
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,213
Miss Claythorne was
employed through an agency

220
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,964
and told to report to Mrs. Owen.

221
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,635
This letter to Mr. Lombard
is the only one directly

222
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,888
from Mr. Owen. Very peculiar.

223
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,308
I might even
call it threatening.

224
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,726
What do you say?

225
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,896
I say that the only person
whose presence here

226
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,232
hasn't been explained
is that gentleman.

227
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:33,236
Well Your Honor, I see no
reason to conceal it any longer.

228
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,987
I'm here to do a job.

229
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,572
- I was hired.
- By whom?

230
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,157
This man, Owen.

231
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,159
You saw him?

232
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,912
No. He enclosed a fat
money order with that

233
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,414
and someone to
join the house party

234
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,916
and to pose as
one of the guests.

235
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,670
I run a detective agency in
Plymouth! I got me credentials!

236
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,589
Look here, Judge.

237
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:59,262
All of these letters refer to
our host as U N Owen. U N Owen!

238
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,347
Unknown

239
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,599
Yes, Mr. Unknown has not only

240
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,894
enticed us here under false
pretences but he's taken the

241
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,188
trouble to find out a
great deal about us all.

242
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,274
- That's a lie!
- It's a fantastical idea!

243
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:17,822
Listen, my friends.
The accusation is true!

244
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,576
Now I remember.
A year ago...

245
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,619
two people in the road...

246
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,706
I was driving fast, fast, fast!

247
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,877
- What happened?
- They took my license away.

248
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:34,881
- What about the two people?
- I ran over them.

249
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,632
Beastly bad luck.

250
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,148
I'm still not clear as to the
purpose of our unknown host

251
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,734
in getting us to assemble here.
In my opinion,

252
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,320
this person whoever he
may be is not of normal mind.

253
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,155
He may be dangerous.

254
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,531
I think it would be wise

255
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,908
for us all to leave this
island immediately.

256
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,326
I quite agree, sir.

257
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,078
Rogers, how soon can we get
the boat from the mainland?

258
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,164
I can't, sir.
There's no telephone.

259
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,082
The boat only comes
twice a week, sir.

260
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,834
It won't come again
until Monday.

261
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,170
And this is only Friday.

262
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,673
- There's no boats here?
- No, sir.

263
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,675
Why do you want to leave,
my friends?

264
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,261
Why don't we get to the
bottom of this mystery?

265
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,764
It's wonderful! Really!

266
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,682
At our time of life, sir,

267
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,851
we have no desire for
thrills as you call them.

268
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,021
Your legal mind has lost
its taste for adventure.

269
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,690
I am all for crime, Your Honor.

270
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:40,655
May I propose a toast:
Here is to crime!

271
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:03,886
How perfectly disgusting!
Drinks like an animal.

272
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,223
- Huh? What did you say?
- He's not moving.

273
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,392
Just plain drunk.

274
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,230
Just plain dead.

275
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,734
- What did the doctor say?
- Dead.

276
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,403
What?

277
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,930
What are you looking at, Rogers?

278
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,599
It's broken, sir.

279
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,351
You'll have more than that

280
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,437
to report to the owner
of this house.

281
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,188
But Mr. Owen isn't
the owner, sir.

282
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,357
He's only leased
it for the weekend.

283
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,694
Ah, then you know
more than you told us.

284
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,280
Come, come, Rogers,

285
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,949
are you quite sure that there
is no one else on this island?

286
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,703
- I'd swear to it, sir.
- I believe you Rogers.

287
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:14,206
But I'm afraid your story will
be questioned by the police.

288
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,977
Don't touch!

289
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,149
I thought you'd gone
to bed, Mr. Blore.

290
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,401
In our profession,

291
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,654
Doctor, we don't always
do what we appear to do.

292
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,573
Perhaps it the same in yours.

293
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,909
Why don't you want me
To touch that glass?

294
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,786
I thought it would
be inadvisable

295
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,163
for you to have your
fingerprints on it.

296
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,332
Smell it.

297
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:06,092
- Lethal solution.
- Suicide?

298
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,679
That, I believe comes under
your profession, sir.

299
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,115
Doctor!

300
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,617
Doctor Armstrong!

301
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,036
- Doctor Armstrong!
- What is it, Rogers?

302
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,038
It's the wife, sir.
She doesn't look right to me.

303
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,790
Go ahead I'll follow you.

304
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,473
Good morning, Miss Brent.

305
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,475
I hope you slept
better than I did.

306
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,561
I slept very well, thank you.

307
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,563
I have nothing on my conscience.

308
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,649
Good morning, General.

309
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,318
Good morning.

310
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,738
General Mandrake!

311
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:16,829
Yes, Juliet?
Oh! Forgive me, young lady.

312
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,915
I was thinking of my wife.

313
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,586
Good morning, Miss Claythorne.
What about breakfast?

314
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,337
Do you mind if I
sit down like this?

315
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,428
Morning, Judge.
Morning, Miss Brent.

316
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,346
Good morning.

317
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,348
What? Is something worrying you?

318
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,184
I don't understand it.

319
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,102
There are a lot of things,
I don't understand, sir!

320
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,687
These little figures.

321
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,272
How many were
there last night? Ten?

322
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,690
- Ten.
- Yes, ten.

323
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:48,611
Rogers found one broken
after... after what happened.

324
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,282
- And now, how many do you see?
- Eight.

325
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:56,035
- Only eight.
- That's what I counted.

326
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,121
Oh, let Mr. Owen worry about it.
They're his Indians.

327
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,706
- What about breakfast?
- I afraid

328
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,708
you'll have to go
without breakfast.

329
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,045
Mrs. Rogers died in her sleep.

330
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,379
- What?
- What?

331
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,131
- How?
- Heart failure?

332
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,300
Her heart certainly
failed to beat.

333
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,552
What caused it to fail,
I cannot say.

334
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,887
Conscience?

335
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,139
Oh conscience, my eye.
What about her husband?

336
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,892
He was scared to death,
for fear his wife would talk.

337
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,480
I'm sorry. I'm sorry there's
no breakfast prepared.

338
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,398
But you see, my wife...

339
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,734
- It's all right, Rogers.
- We understand.

340
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:35,241
But I thought you told us,
he was dead.

341
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,743
- His wife.
- Eh?

342
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,996
- His wife!
- Wife?

343
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:48,170
No, no, no. I don't think a man
would ever kill his wife.

344
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,341
No matter how guilty she was.

345
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,931
The wicked flee when
no man pursueth.

346
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:03,519
Two accidental deaths in
12 hours? I don't believe it!

347
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,105
Nor I! What do you say, Judge?

348
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:09,942
How does the rhyme go,
Miss Claythorne?

349
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,695
Ten Little Indians?

350
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,115
One choked his little self
and then were nine.

351
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:21,287
- Go on...
- One overslept himself.

352
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,373
And then there were eight.

353
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,465
We are eight people
on this island now.

354
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,400
- Lombard!
- I'll be ready in a minute!

355
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,068
Take your time!

356
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,905
- You know I got it?
- Got what?

357
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,242
There's one thing this
fellow Owen forgot.

358
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,244
This island is just a bare rock.

359
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,163
We'll catch that raving maniac.

360
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,832
He would have to be a fool
to stay on the island.

361
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,001
You mean Rogers is lying?

362
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,378
Why not? The man's scared,

363
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,172
scared out of his senses,
that's obvious.

364
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,174
That's why I think that
he is telling the truth.

365
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,593
A lunatic like Owen could
have found a hiding place

366
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,011
before Rogers arrived here.

367
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,347
It doesn't matter if
Rogers is lying or not.

368
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,683
You agree that Mr. Owen
Esquire is hiding, don't' you.

369
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,436
He'll certainly be dangerous.
We ought to be armed.

370
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,356
Yes, too bad we're not allowed
to carry firearms in England.

371
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,858
It puts the normal citizen
at a great disadvantage.

372
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,527
You mean you
haven't any weapon?

373
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,196
You know Blore, it's strange,

374
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,114
but I came to the same
conclusion you did.

375
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,785
Mr. Owen is hiding,
maybe inside this house.

376
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,787
He appears to have an
accomplice, hasn't he?

377
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,622
If you ask me, Rogers...

378
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:57,299
I have a feeling I'm
being watched. Secretly.

379
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,335
What do you see?

380
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,215
I... I thought heard
a strange voice.

381
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,343
Gentlemen, I have come
to the conclusion that

382
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,179
the invisible Mr. Owen is hiding
somewhere on this island.

383
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:48,016
Extraordinary. I was looking for
you to tell you the same thing.

384
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,436
- That's what I think, sir.
- Me too.

385
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,354
We've all come to
the same opinion.

386
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,023
We must find his
place of concealment.

387
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,526
Immediately. So long as
there's a lunatic at large,

388
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,361
we are in mortal danger.

389
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,962
Do you hear that?

390
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:30,559
Hello, puss. Looking
for a mouse? So are we.

391
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:35,314
What I'd like to know is whether
we're the cat or the mouse.

392
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,403
Nobody in the General's room,
not even the General.

393
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,113
I wonder where the old boy is.

394
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,991
I don't know. I don't think he
even knows where he is himself.

395
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:55,417
Nothing in there
but the Russian.

396
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,002
I keep hearing that song

397
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,087
he was singing last night
just before he popped off.

398
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,172
- Ten Little Indians?
- Yes.

399
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,840
It certainly was his swan song.

400
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,850
One thing is certain.
He isn't inside.

401
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,435
Therefore, he must be outside.

402
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,270
- Brilliant thinking, Blore!
- Eh?

403
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,886
I'm afraid it's no use
watching for the boat.

404
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,138
It won't come till Monday.

405
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,391
No boat will ever come, Juliet.

406
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:57,729
We're here forever.
What made you love him, Juliet?

407
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,731
Sir John!

408
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:06,905
Oh. Forgive me, my child.
You don't understand.

409
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,598
- Nobody!
- Not a living thing.

410
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,349
Not even a hiding place.

411
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,023
Not even a seagull
could hide down there.

412
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,109
- I don't understand it.
- Maybe we've been wrong.

413
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,194
Building a nightmare
out of imagination.

414
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,530
Two people dead
isn't imagination.

415
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,282
The Russian may have
committed suicide.

416
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,867
And Mrs. Rogers?

417
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:56,288
Well, you didn't give an
overdose last night, did you?

418
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,541
Doctors can't afford to
make mistakes of that kind.

419
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,877
We cannot blunder as
detectives sometimes do.

420
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,378
It wouldn't be
your first mistake

421
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,797
if that gramophone
record is to be believed.

422
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,467
Gentlemen, gentlemen this
is no time for quarrelling.

423
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,720
- Let's face it we're in a trap.
- You shouldn't forget

424
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,639
the ten little Indians
on the dinner table.

425
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,308
That's right. Mr. Owen's
hand is plain to see.

426
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:20,020
Yes, but where the devil
is Mr. Owen himself?

427
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,489
If Mr. Owen is on this island,
he'll catch his death of cold.

428
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,158
If that's supposed to be a joke,
I don't see the point.

429
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,994
All we have to do is to keep
quiet and we'll hear him sneeze.

430
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,412
Oh.

431
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,751
I'm sorry it's only
cold meat and salad.

432
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,503
I did the best I could.

433
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,254
- Okay, Rogers.
- Oh we understand.

434
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:51,510
- Rogers we're only seven today.
- I'm sorry miss.

435
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,596
You called General Mandrake?

436
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,432
I looked in his room, Miss,
but he's not there.

437
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,520
- Didn't he come in the house?
- I didn't see him, Doctor.

438
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,855
Last time I saw, he was
mooning around on the beach.

439
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,858
- He seemed quite abnormal.
- I know where he is.

440
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,694
You stay here, Miss Claythorne.

441
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:17,202
You say the General was
behaving very strangely?

442
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:21,206
- Like a man out of his mind.
- In other words, a lunatic.

443
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,375
Right ho, the old boy's barmy.

444
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,628
Whom the Gods destroy,
they first make mad.

445
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,133
Well? Aren't we
looking for a lunatic?

446
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,636
He said no boat will ever come.

447
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,722
Then he knows something.

448
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,142
Maybe he's not as crazy
as we think he is.

449
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,487
Doctor, you better come with me.

450
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,073
Don't wait for us.

451
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,659
And don't wait for the
General any longer.

452
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,336
Poisoned glass could
mean suicide.

453
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,049
An overdose of sedative might
have been an accident.

454
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,427
But this instrument,

455
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:19,097
which you saw me remove from
the back of the third victim

456
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:23,351
means only one thing: Murder.

457
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,149
Or an act of God.

458
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:34,196
My dear lady, in my
experience of ill doing,

459
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,075
Providence means the work of
punishment to us mortals.

460
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,954
Evidently, Mr. Owen believes
we are guilty of certain crimes,

461
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,956
which the law cannot touch

462
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,626
and he's appointed himself
to execute justice.

463
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,712
That is why he has
enticed us to this island.

464
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,965
There's no one on this island.
I tell you. No one.

465
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,885
- Doctor. Doctor Armstrong!
- What is it, man?

466
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,474
There's another little
Indian figure missing.

467
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,478
- That accounts for the General.
- I was expecting that.

468
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,815
You just said there's
no one on this island.

469
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,150
In a sense you may know.

470
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:16,738
Nevertheless, I am now
certain that Mr. Owen is here.

471
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,323
How can he be here?

472
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,575
I don't believe in
the invisible man.

473
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,369
He's not invisible.

474
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,664
Mr. Owen could only come
to this island in one way.

475
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,457
It's perfectly clear.

476
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:32,671
Mr. Owen is one of us.

477
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,600
Do you have to do that?

478
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,144
I'm just studying
Mr. Owen's little scheme.

479
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,479
Maybe you know how
the General was killed.

480
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,231
My dear Blore, can't you read?

481
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,567
Eight little Indians boys
traveling in Devon,

482
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:39,237
One said he'd stay there
and then there were seven.

483
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,741
The old soldier
stayed here, didn't he?

484
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,669
Am I disturbing
your little game?

485
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,921
Not at all, Blore.

486
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,506
Nothing clears the mind
like a game of precision.

487
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,091
What game are
you playing, judge?

488
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,594
We've come to the conclusion,
the doctor and I,

489
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,764
that this whole story is
a game of the mind.

490
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:10,435
There we are. Eight of us
came to this island.

491
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,688
The Rogers were waiting for us.

492
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,774
Don't forget, waiting for us.

493
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,360
One of the ten is Mr. Owen.

494
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,487
We agree on that.

495
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:24,032
Out of all of us, three persons
are definitely cleared.

496
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,118
- Who?
- The dead ones.

497
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:33,083
Our Russian friend,
Mrs. Rogers and the General.

498
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:38,713
- Seven little Indians left.
- Six. One is bogus.

499
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,717
Correct, sir.
One of us is Mr. Owen.

500
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,971
Which one?

501
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,639
Where's your alibi?

502
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,308
I'm not like you Mr. Blore. I am
a well known professional man.

503
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,436
My dear doctor, that
proves less than nothing.

504
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,981
I too am a well known person.

505
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,942
But doctors have
gone mad before now.

506
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,529
Judges have gone mad
and so have policemen.

507
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,907
And, may I say, explorers,
Mr. Lombard?

508
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,325
You may. You may.

509
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,160
Why do you leave
Miss Claythorne out of it?

510
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,996
- We don't.
- Nor you, my dear lady.

511
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,914
Well, I quite appreciate
that nobody can be

512
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,375
- exonerated without proof.
- What about Rogers?

513
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,253
- That's what I was thinking.
- What do we know about him?

514
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,879
He put that record on the
gramophone, didn't he.

515
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,423
That's a fact.

516
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,758
How do we know Rogers
didn't lease this house

517
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,510
and pretend to be the butler?

518
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,263
Oh, no, no, no.
Bad psychology!

519
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,348
You can rule
Rogers out definitely.

520
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,934
- I don't see why.
- Look at the shape of his head.

521
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,602
He hasn't the brains for it.

522
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,521
And don't forget there's
something else, sir.

523
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,106
My wife was one of the victims.

524
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,526
In my time, Rogers,
I've had several husbands

525
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,778
before me guilty of the
murder of their wives.

526
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,531
Well, if you put it
that way, sir, they...

527
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,616
they do sometimes
drive a man crazy.

528
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,119
We must suspect each
and everyone among us.

529
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,914
Now, I warn everybody to
be on his guard. If not...

530
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,963
We shall all go the same way.

531
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:09,721
And Mr. Owen will very soon
be alone on this island.

532
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,812
E flat, Miss Claythorne.

533
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,067
Aren't you afraid the others

534
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,277
will think your
playing inappropriate.

535
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,946
I can't stand the silence.
I have to do something.

536
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,323
Go on playing.

537
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,421
If it's any comfort to you,

538
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,757
there's one person who
doesn't suspect you.

539
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,009
Thank you.

540
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,886
Aren't you going to
return the compliment?

541
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,764
I haven't made up my mind
about you, Mr. Lombard.

542
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,017
Whom do you suspect?

543
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,439
The one nearest the fire.

544
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,614
- I think you're wrong.
- Well, who then?

545
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,951
A man who believes
in punishing crimes.

546
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:16,913
His brain might snap and
he'd want to be executioner.

547
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,207
After having been a judge.

548
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,009
Rogers, I'd like to ask
you a few questions.

549
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,677
Did you...

550
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:18,516
- prepare a nice dinner?
- Just cold meat, sir.

551
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,978
I see. I'm sure you
do your best, Rogers.

552
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:26,274
Is there plenty of food
for the weekend?

553
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,777
Oh, yes, sir. Everything
was provided for.

554
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,281
Oh, Mr. Blore, may I
ask you a question?

555
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,533
Of course, of course,
my dear fellow.

556
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,745
How many will you be
for dinner tonight?

557
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,875
But... Oh, I see what
you mean. Yes.

558
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,227
Don't forget your vote, Rogers.

559
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,396
In a case like this, a secret
vote is the only way

560
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,566
to bring out into the open
how we are all thinking.

561
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:17,450
No, no, no. Never touch it. No.
But under the circumstances.

562
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,751
Now, whom do we suspect
of being Mr. Owen?

563
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,799
Mr. Lombard, one vote.

564
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,678
Mr. Blore, one vote.

565
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,266
Dr. Armstrong, one vote.

566
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,186
Rogers, one vote.

567
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,525
Miss Brent, one vote.

568
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:57,824
I see I haven't been neglected.
One vote.

569
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,744
Another vote for you.
Rogers. You win.

570
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,541
You mean, sir, that
I am being accused?

571
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,960
Well, it's not
precisely a majority,

572
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,878
but you have the most votes.

573
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,006
They're saying its me,
because I'm only a butler.

574
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,133
You said I didn't have
the brains to do it.

575
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,635
- I didn't vote for you, Rogers.
- Well, who did then?

576
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,972
Who didn't drink the cocktail
you just served?

577
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,558
You think I poisoned
those cocktails?

578
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,728
I'll show you, sir.

579
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,650
Picking on an innocent man!

580
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:39,073
I can't touch even
a drop of alcohol.

581
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,078
And if that's what
you think of me,

582
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,830
I'm not going to
serve any dinner.

583
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,582
Oh, Rogers, come back here!

584
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,959
You can't do that!

585
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,767
Don't look so offended, Rogers.

586
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,770
If it had been
anybody but you, sir.

587
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,271
I'm sorry, Rogers.

588
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,273
But, how do I know that
you didn't vote for me?

589
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:16,736
I didn't, Your Honor.
I voted for... well...

590
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,112
Time will tell.

591
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,865
After all, Rogers, nobody in
this house is above suspicion.

592
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:25,578
Never in my life, have I been
accused of any crime, sir.

593
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,955
What about that
gramophone record?

594
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,584
What about it?

595
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,795
That woman you worked for,

596
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,297
she left you some
money, didn't she?

597
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,218
Let's not stand on
our dignity, Rogers.

598
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,387
After all, she was sick.

599
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:48,226
Didn't you shorten her
suffering in this world?

600
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:53,064
With the complicity, of course,
of poor Mrs. Rogers?

601
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,567
I'm not going to
argue with you, sir.

602
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,321
But what makes you think
I would kill anybody

603
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,907
who wasn't going to
leave me any money?

604
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,787
No, thank you.

605
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,251
Pardon me.

606
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,761
Obviously, we can't
sit up all night, like this.

607
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,891
I'm going to retire. Good night.

608
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,607
If you don't mind,
I'll say good night too.

609
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,862
If you don't mind,
Miss Claythorne,

610
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,114
I would rather
go upstairs alone.

611
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,617
May I remind you, Miss Brent,
that I am the only one

612
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,786
whose name wasn't
mentioned in the voting.

613
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:52,415
That's what I mean.
I find that fact most peculiar.

614
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,042
I know Miss Brent won't mind
if there's a third person.

615
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,628
Not so fast, Mr. Lombard.
I'll go with you.

616
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,131
- The more the merrier.
- And safer.

617
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,743
- Warm in here, isn't it?
- Yes, quite warm, quite warm.

618
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:31,078
And lonely.

619
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,415
Yes, quite lonely,
quite... quite lonely.

620
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,794
- Rogers!
- Yes, sir?

621
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,006
Oh, would you mind keeping us
company for a while?

622
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,509
Anything you wish, sir.

623
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:50,681
- Don't put any water in it.
- I shan't, sir.

624
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,436
Good night, Miss Claythorne.

625
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,355
Don't forget to lock your door.

626
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,524
You cannot lock out the devil.

627
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,278
I think there's another
one who's barmy.

628
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,365
It's going to end with the
whole lot going that way.

629
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,116
I don't fancy you will, Blore.

630
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,703
No. It takes a lot to
send me off my head.

631
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:16,123
I don't think you'll be
going that way, either.

632
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:19,043
I feel quite sane at the moment.
Thank you.

633
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,634
- Have you told him?
- Yes, sir.

634
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,220
I know the jury's decision.

635
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,933
You'll feel safer if I didn't
stay inside the house tonight.

636
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,936
Well then, I shall sleep
in the woodshed.

637
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:41,232
And now, if you'll excuse me.
Good night.

638
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,584
- I'll lock it behind him.
- That's not enough, Mr. Blore.

639
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,175
Still seven.
Lock that door, please.

640
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,763
Put the key there.

641
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,184
We'll have no more
Indian tricks tonight.

642
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,690
Lock it, Mr. Blore.

643
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:29,530
No wait! Now no one can
get in there but you.

644
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:33,951
Oh, I see.
But, who's going to keep it?

645
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:47,715
- Rogers! Open up, Rogers!
- Keep away from that door.

646
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,718
It's me, Lombard! Open up!

647
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,888
Do you take me for a fool,
Mr. Lombard?

648
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:57,475
- Don't be silly, Rogers!
- Don't be silly yourself, sir.

649
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,561
- This is Judge Quinncannon,
- You know my voice, Rogers!

650
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,730
- Doctor Armstrong!
- This is Blore, Rogers.

651
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,148
Open the door!

652
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,317
At a time like this,
I wouldn't open the door

653
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,569
even if it was Santa Claus.

654
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,237
We just want to give you a key.

655
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,823
- What for?
- Never mind, you idiot!

656
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,825
Hurry up! It's raining!

657
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:18,829
Shove it...
under the door, sir.

658
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,630
Good night, Rogers.
Keep your door locked.

659
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,257
Don't worry about me, sir.

660
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,281
- Ohhh, be careful, Judge.
- Oh, I shall.

661
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,910
You know, the common cold
kills more people than...

662
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,080
Never mind.

663
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,381
I need hardly advise
you to lock you doors.

664
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,216
And put a chair
under the handle.

665
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,052
There are ways of turning
locks from the outside.

666
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,682
And if it should turn out that
one of you is Mr. Owen,

667
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,810
just remember I'm
a very light sleeper.

668
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,646
- Good night.
- Good night, gentlemen.

669
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,025
May we all meet
safely in the morning.

670
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,318
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

671
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,026
Miss Brent! Miss Brent!

672
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,195
She doesn't answer!

673
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,781
- Is her door locked?
- Of course, try it!

674
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,077
She's not here!

675
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,121
You grasp the fact
very quickly, Blore.

676
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,040
What's wrong, Mr. Blore?

677
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,875
- Miss Brent's missing.
- I knocked on all your doors,

678
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,293
she was the only one
that didn't answer.

679
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,711
What's wrong with that?
It's late.

680
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,129
We all overslept.

681
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,632
I heard her get up.
She must gone downstairs.

682
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,979
- I locked that door last night.
- Who opened it?

683
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,481
Look.

684
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:56,320
Good morning.
It's such a pretty pattern.

685
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,114
I thought I'd like to copy
it for a new shawl.

686
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,324
Was that door locked
when you went out?

687
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,910
- Oh, yes, I opened it.
- Good morning, Miss Brent.

688
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,496
I too like to walk
before breakfast.

689
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,414
But I wouldn't have
gone out alone.

690
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,918
I feel perfectly safe when
I'm alone. Thank you.

691
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,586
I share your feeling.

692
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,339
But didn't you know you that
Rogers was outside?

693
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:18,509
Poor man.
I hope he didn't catch cold.

694
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,847
What's that?

695
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,515
- Someone's knocking.
- Kitchen door.

696
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,350
Rogers, of course.
He wants to get in.

697
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,269
That's it. We forgot
all about breakfast.

698
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,738
- Where is he?
- Somebody was knocking.

699
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:58,716
Rogers!

700
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,469
- He's not there.
- Rogers!

701
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:06,807
Know what I think?
We got our man. It's Rogers!

702
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,976
It fits the
psychological pattern.

703
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,229
His behavior last night
was distinctly abnormal.

704
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,191
Psychological pattern, my eye.
I go by facts.

705
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,735
He was officially accused,
Fact!

706
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,236
He got drunk.

707
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,655
He wouldn't open the door
to the woodshed. Fact!

708
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,240
Realizing this morning,

709
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,826
that he'd gone to the end
of his rope. He disappears.

710
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,328
Fact!

711
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,872
There's another fact you
haven't mentioned about Rogers.

712
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,541
He's dead.

713
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,258
The murderer was fastidious.

714
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,761
He cleaned this blade
after striking down his victim.

715
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,680
Obviously he crept up behind,
swung this chopper

716
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,516
and brought it down,
splitting the cranium.

717
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,606
Seven little Indian boys
chopping up sticks.

718
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:59,610
One chopped himself in half
and then there were six.

719
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:03,530
Would it have needed much
strength to strike the blow?

720
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,450
Well, a woman
could have done it.

721
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,369
If that's what you mean.

722
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,289
Miss Claythorne was locked
in her room, Doctor,

723
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,708
if that's what you mean.

724
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,211
We were all in our rooms.

725
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,297
Except...

726
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,302
- No breakfast yet?
- No.

727
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:29,223
If I had a butler like Rogers.
I'd soon get rid of him.

728
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,478
Wait! We we've
forgotten something.

729
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,230
- What?
- The dining room!

730
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,235
It's still locked.
Where's the key?

731
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,071
We found it in Rogers's pocket.

732
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:53,998
One. Two. Three.
Four. Five. Six.

733
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,917
- Another one missing?
- But the door was locked.

734
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,671
I get it!

735
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,677
No I don't.

736
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,601
Did you ever hear of a
bee sting being fatal?

737
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,353
No, why?

738
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,023
Six little Indian boys
playing with a hive.

739
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:22,901
A bumblebee stung one
and then there were five.

740
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,868
Very stupid to kill the
only servant in the house.

741
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,287
Now we don't even know
where to find the marmalade.

742
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,831
Watch out for a bee.

743
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,629
I'd be careful with
that young man.

744
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:46,383
I mean to, Miss Brent.
I'm careful of everyone.

745
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,219
A clear conscience
is the best armor.

746
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,305
This island is in
the image of life.

747
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,600
The innocent has to be
surrounded by criminals.

748
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,311
That sounds like
Mr. Owen talking.

749
00:55:57,395 --> 00:56:00,314
I see nothing wrong with his
idea of punishing the guilty.

750
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:07,071
What about his
accusations against you?

751
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,656
I wonder if these
eggs are fresh.

752
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,241
What about it, Miss Brent.

753
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,036
Your young nephew, aren't
you to blame for his death?

754
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,996
Family gossip, Miss Claythorne.

755
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,998
My sister's boy had bad blood.

756
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,666
From the father's side,
of course.

757
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,418
But he was no good, naturally.

758
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,879
I had to have him
placed in a reformatory.

759
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,590
I do hope these
eggs aren't overcooked.

760
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,386
What happened to the boy?

761
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,012
Oh, I never saw him again.

762
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,598
He added to his many sins
by hanging himself.

763
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,856
I got it! I know who
took the last Indian.

764
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,526
- Who?
- Rogers.

765
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,823
He had the key to
this room. Fact.

766
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:53,534
He sneaks in and
takes a little Indian.

767
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,161
Locks the door again.

768
00:56:56,246 --> 00:57:00,707
Goes back to the woodshed where
he chops some sticks. Fact.

769
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:04,294
- And then...
- And then...

770
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,296
He takes the chopper and
splits his own cranium,

771
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,465
as the Doctor would say. Fact.

772
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,634
I'd like to see you do
that to yourself, Blore.

773
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,553
It would take practice.

774
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:19,643
Anyone inside the house could
leave without being noticed.

775
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:23,063
- True, Miss Brent?
- Perfectly true.

776
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,650
The murderer meets Rogers
outside and kills him.

777
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,820
He then takes the key
from his victim's pocket,

778
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,989
and you know the rest.

779
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:37,327
Yes, but the key was still
in Rogers' pocket!

780
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,163
Of course.

781
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,832
The murderer puts the
key back in Rogers' pocket

782
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,667
and goes to bed again.

783
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:47,880
Or goes for an innocent
walk before breakfast.

784
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,466
Sorry, Miss Brent.

785
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,970
Anyone have more tea?

786
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,226
Lombard!

787
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,446
- Lombard!
- Yes, Blore?

788
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,292
- What you doing here?
- You called me, didn't you?

789
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:28,170
Yes. Oh, yes, yes.

790
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,963
I ain't saying,

791
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,299
but don't you think the
old judge knows too much?

792
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,134
Describing every move...

793
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,220
You'd think he had been
at the scene of the crime.

794
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,972
My dear Blore, in my opinion
you haven't a chance.

795
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,975
- Why is that?
- Lack of imagination.

796
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,061
A criminal with a
brain like U N Owen...

797
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:46,396
can think rings around you,
anytime he wants to.

798
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:49,483
No man ever got the
better of me... yet.

799
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,901
How about a woman?

800
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:55,739
Yes, yes, one should
never trust a woman.

801
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,741
She's clearly a
manic-depressive.

802
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:59,826
I don't know why I
didn't see it before.

803
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,412
She was very strange in
the kitchen this morning.

804
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,164
We all behaved strangely,

805
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:08,085
but I find no evidence.
She left no clue.

806
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,586
But she did.

807
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,677
What about this, eh?

808
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,888
No sane person would
think about using seaweed

809
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,598
as a pattern for a shawl.

810
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,433
She tried to throw
us off the track.

811
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,436
It's her!
I'll stake my life, it's her.

812
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,522
Wait, Blore.

813
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,566
Let Miss Claythorne call her.

814
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,901
She'll be less suspicious.

815
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:45,581
Miss Brent!

816
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,787
Miss Brent! Miss Brent!

817
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:29,416
It's no use, Miss Claythorne.
She'll not answer.

818
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:36,590
Look at the bee!
Look at the bee!

819
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,511
Just an ordinary bee,
Miss Claythorne.

820
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,350
Nothing, but a small
mark on the neck.

821
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,602
Here's your bee, Doctor.

822
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:05,619
Somebody must have taken it.
It's not here. See for yourself.

823
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:08,872
- What poison was injected?
- I can only guess.

824
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:13,710
It was very potent.
She must have died immediately.

825
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:18,340
But the bee.
That bee in her room.

826
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,967
That's our murderer's
artistic touch

827
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:24,012
He likes to stick to his
blasted nursery jingle.

828
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,889
He's mad. We're all mad.

829
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:30,519
I'm not, Mr. Lombard. I still
have my reasoning powers.

830
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:36,149
There are five of us left.
One of us is a murderer.

831
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:39,569
- The rest of us are defenseless.
- Defenseless?

832
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,656
How do we know one of us
hasn't have a revolver?

833
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,242
A good point, Blore!
How do we know?

834
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:49,413
Well, I know I haven't got one.
Dear me, it's against the law.

835
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,498
How about you, Doctor?

836
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:54,167
Of course not. You may search
me, gentlemen, search me.

837
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,670
- Miss Claythorne?
- I wish I had.

838
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,798
Quite right, Miss Claythorne,
it's an unfortunate oversight.

839
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,258
One should never
be careless, when

840
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,843
visiting a place
one doesn't know.

841
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,846
Why didn't you tell us that
you had a revolver?

842
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,431
Nobody asked me.

843
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,016
I've got him!
Search his pockets.

844
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,686
Aren't you wasting your time?

845
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,021
I know where it is.

846
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,694
Judge, you said just now that
one of us was the murderer.

847
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:23,780
If I were you, I wouldn't
let Blore get at that gun.

848
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,038
It's not here!

849
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,040
Look again, Blore.
It's got to be there.

850
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:36,793
Look in his pockets!

851
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,545
Don't. Get him off. Get him off.

852
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:39,963
It's not here.

853
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:42,758
- What did you do with it?
- What did you do with it?

854
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,885
Good heavens, where is it?

855
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,803
The one who can answer
that question,

856
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,222
is obviously not going to speak.

857
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,917
At a time like this.

858
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:21,171
A game of the mind, Blore,
a game of the mind.

859
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,842
You know the safest
thing for you to do

860
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,011
is stay in your room,
with the door locked.

861
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:29,596
What about yourself?

862
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,098
Oh, I wouldn't stay out here
alone with any of the others.

863
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,934
Why not?

864
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,603
Don't you think it strange
that there's never

865
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:40,190
a third person present when
anything unpleasant occurs?

866
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:44,361
Mr. Owen always manages
to be alone with his victim.

867
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:48,865
When a third person is
present, nothing happens.

868
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,204
Doesn't that make you nervous,
out here with me, alone?

869
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:56,206
But, we're not alone.

870
01:03:56,290 --> 01:04:01,378
I asked Mr. Blore to keep an
eye on us. He's my third person.

871
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,384
Blore!

872
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,642
Look, another misfortune.

873
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,728
Something wrong
with the machinery.

874
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,314
Batteries must be running down.

875
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,901
We've got to keep every light
in the house burning tonight.

876
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,404
I'll go to the woodshed
and see to it.

877
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,659
Leave it on, Doctor,
leave it on.

878
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,665
Put you off your game,
wouldn't it, this flickering?

879
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:42,419
You went away from the
window and left me alone.

880
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:43,837
I've got to go to the woodshed.
You better go

881
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,589
to your room and lock your door.

882
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,007
I shall.

883
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:09,029
- Where's Miss Claythorne?
- I don't know.

884
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,865
- Where's Blore?
- Went out to the woodshed.

885
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,617
Woodshed?

886
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,127
What's wrong, Doctor?

887
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:31,468
Oh, I see. You and I, well,
we are alone in the house.

888
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,386
- Lombard!
- Lombard!

889
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,055
- Come here!
- Don't leave us!

890
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,154
- Where's Vera?
- Vera?

891
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:53,156
- Miss Claythorne! Answer me!
- Don't come any closer!

892
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,741
- Where is she?
- Keep back!

893
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,493
Blore, if I you don't tell me,
I swear I'll kill you.

894
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,912
If you make another move,
I'll brain you.

895
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,415
You know, Doctor, please
give me a chance.

896
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,669
If you are Mr. Owen,
friend tell me.

897
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,505
I... I won't say a
word to the others.

898
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:10,590
Don't torment me this way.

899
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:15,220
If you want to kill the
others, I won't interfere.

900
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:17,097
I won't say a word.

901
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:19,766
I'll even help you if
you spare my life.

902
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:24,938
Look, I trust you.
Don't you trust me?

903
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:29,025
- Um... yes.
- That's more reasonable.

904
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,777
Don't come any closer!

905
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:35,365
- Isn't your arm getting tired?
- Don't worry about me.

906
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,702
Listen, if Miss Claythorne is
safe in her room as you say,

907
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,120
we are both behaving
like idiots.

908
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,330
Can't get round me that way.
I prefer being a living idiot.

909
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,791
- Hang on, someone's coming.
- What?

910
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:50,213
Miss Claythorne! I told you
to stay locked in your room.

911
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:54,300
I'm looking for... oh.

912
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,803
He's right, Vera.
You shouldn't be so careless!

913
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:58,805
- Come on!
- Stay here, both of you.

914
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:01,141
Now I can do what
I came out to do.

915
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:04,561
Do not know anything
about electricity?

916
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:07,147
Don't bother me. I get it!

917
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:10,817
- Stay where you are!
- I shan't move an inch.

918
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,738
Neither will I
till the light comes on.

919
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:18,742
- Do you think it will?
- Why not?

920
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,328
This is no accident.

921
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,914
Someone wants this
house to be dark at night.

922
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,417
- Who?
- The one we fear.

923
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:30,420
My dear, Doctor,
we've made a mistake.

924
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:34,340
This trick of putting
out the lights,

925
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:38,428
clears two people, you and me.

926
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:40,764
Now we can trust each other.

927
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:46,102
I see! The idea was keep
us in fear of each other.

928
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:49,272
But now we can form
an alliance, you and I.

929
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,692
And find the murderer.

930
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:57,030
We no longer have anything to
conceal from each other have we.

931
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,616
Just what I was thinking.

932
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,037
Oh ho, I needed that.

933
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,123
Now?

934
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,793
Now we can tell
each other the truth.

935
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,878
The entire truth.

936
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,809
Who's going to speak first?

937
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,648
Very well, I shall begin.

938
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:37,237
As you know, Mr. Owen's
saying that I was responsible

939
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:40,156
for the death of one
Edward Seaton.

940
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,909
It's perfectly true.

941
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:46,913
He was an innocent man
on trial for his life.

942
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,998
I'd nothing against him.

943
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:53,837
I wanted to ruin the reputation
of his defending counsel,

944
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:59,926
who lost the case,
while his client lost his life.

945
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:05,014
Doctor? Tell us the truth.

946
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:09,352
Your fate depends on it.
I'm convinced of that.

947
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:18,111
The gramophone
record did not lie.

948
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:22,532
I operated on Mrs. Cleese while
under the influence of uh...

949
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:28,705
Guilty, I was, but of
drinking not of killing.

950
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:36,796
I don't see where
this is getting us.

951
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,631
Sit down, Mr. Blore.

952
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:42,218
This is getting us to a
very important conclusion.

953
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,387
Isn't that right, Doctor?

954
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:47,056
If I were you,
I would speak, Mr. Blore.

955
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:53,229
- I didn't kill anybody!
- We're listening, Mr. Blore.

956
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,567
This Landor chap
was innocent all right,

957
01:09:57,651 --> 01:10:00,320
but I was mixed up with the
gang that was out to get him.

958
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:03,573
On my testimony,
he got sent up for life.

959
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:05,158
That's all.

960
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,994
But he died in prison,
didn't he?

961
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,330
Course he did!

962
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:12,999
How could I know
that would happen?

963
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,084
What about yourself Mr. Lombard?

964
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:18,504
What about those 21 poor
natives in South Africa?

965
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:22,425
Don't get excited, Blore.

966
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:26,429
Mr. Lombard is unable
to deny a thing.

967
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:29,933
Ah ha! That's the first
thing you said I believe.

968
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:33,603
Are you leaving us,
Miss Claythorne?

969
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:38,524
My dear child, you're trembling.

970
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:41,527
I... I'm so cold.

971
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:44,197
Would you like us to
postpone this inquiry,

972
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:45,782
while we build a fire?

973
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:52,038
That would mean going outside
to get wood, as Rogers did.

974
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:55,792
No. We wait while
you get your coat.

975
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:57,460
Thank you.

976
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,468
Stay here, Mr. Lombard.

977
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:08,805
Nothing can happen to her
if we all remain in this room.

978
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:25,571
Aah!

979
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:34,038
- Vera!
- Claythorne!

980
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,498
- Get a light!
- Haven't got one!

981
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:38,251
- Who is it?
- It's me, Blore!

982
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:39,585
- Guy Lombard!

983
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,504
- Where's Blore?
- How do I know in the dark.

984
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,923
Where have you
been all this time?

985
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,925
I went to my room
to get this candle.

986
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,510
Where have you been?

987
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:49,262
I've been looking
for my flashlight.

988
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:51,014
Where is Blore?

989
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:55,226
Blore! What the devil are
you doing in my room?

990
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,604
Your room? No wonder
I couldn't find anything.

991
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,857
- What happened to you?
- Somebody bumped into me.

992
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,608
- Did you hear anything?
- Yes, sounded like a shot.

993
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,193
Sounded like
something fell to me.

994
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,446
You're jumpy,
both of you. Nerves.

995
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,198
It's Vera's.

996
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,288
Vera!

997
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:20,209
Vera! What happened?

998
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:22,128
Don't be frightened, Vera.
What happened?

999
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:24,881
- He was in my room.
- Who?

1000
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:28,718
I felt. Oh, I don't know...

1001
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:30,636
- Something like a hand.
- Who was it?

1002
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:34,140
I don't know.
My candles went out.

1003
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:36,225
We'll soon find out.

1004
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:49,155
Help! Lights! Lights!

1005
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:52,909
Seaweed.

1006
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,537
It felt like a cold hand.

1007
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,998
That's what Miss Claythorne
walked into.

1008
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,084
Who brought it in here?

1009
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,961
Who brought it into the house?

1010
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:09,175
- Miss Brent.
- Are you sure, Miss Brent is...

1011
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:28,528
- Dead as a doornail.
- Where's the judge?

1012
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,865
That's funny, I thought
he came up with us.

1013
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,283
So did I.

1014
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:35,952
He was right behind
me on the staircase.

1015
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:40,623
Yes, I thought I bumped into
him when I heard that shot.

1016
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,042
- Shot? What did I tell you?
- What?

1017
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,710
Why, the old bloke
knew too much.

1018
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,295
- You say you heard a shot?
- Yes.

1019
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,881
Well, don't you see? He took
a shot at us in the dark.

1020
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:51,134
He'll pot us like clay pigeons,
when we go downstairs.

1021
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,219
There's one way to find out!

1022
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:05,565
It's my own.

1023
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:08,484
No. It looks too easy.

1024
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,242
Alright, Judge, come outside.

1025
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:19,245
Don't think I can't see you.

1026
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:33,426
He has been shot
through the head.

1027
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,514
Only one shot fired.

1028
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,608
Who will be next?

1029
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:55,281
Another one proved innocent.
Too late.

1030
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:58,284
He'd found the solution. That's
why he had to be silenced.

1031
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:02,955
- Silenced by who?
- By whom? Don't you remember?

1032
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,548
One moment, Miss Claythorne!

1033
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,721
Just when the judge was
about to question you...

1034
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:21,474
you came up here,
presumably to get your coat.

1035
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:23,142
True?

1036
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:26,229
Yes.

1037
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:28,231
You opened that door.

1038
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:30,942
Wind blows out your candles,
seaweed touches your face...

1039
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:32,944
You scream. Perfect, perfect.

1040
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,238
But, considerable time elapses,

1041
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,906
and then we find
you way down there.

1042
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:38,658
What made you run the wrong way?

1043
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:41,160
She didn't know where she
was going. She was hysterical.

1044
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,662
Agreed.

1045
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,664
But if Miss Claythorne
had not screamed,

1046
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:46,582
we would still be
in the dining room,

1047
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:48,084
and the judge would be alive.

1048
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:51,170
Now wait a minute.
Don't confuse things.

1049
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:52,838
One of you two
pulled this trigger

1050
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:54,173
and you're trying to pin
it on Miss Claythorne.

1051
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:55,758
Now you wait a minute,
Mr. Lombard.

1052
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,426
We know very well that the judge

1053
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,095
was on the point of an
important discovery.

1054
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:00,846
How do we know what was
in the judge's mind?

1055
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:03,099
I do know.
He took me into his confidence.

1056
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:06,519
Truth. The entire truth.

1057
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,898
Miss Claythorne,
did you or did you not,

1058
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,609
commit the crime, of which the
gramophone accused you?

1059
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,695
I'd rather not talk about it.

1060
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:20,533
Ah, but you must. We've all
confessed our little errors.

1061
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:23,828
All except you.
Come now, my girl.

1062
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:27,582
You didn't really kill this
Barclay chap did you?

1063
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:30,710
Will you take my word,
if I tell you I didn't?

1064
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:32,545
I'm afraid, I will.

1065
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:34,797
Then you have my word for it.

1066
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:38,217
And don't ask me
any more questions.

1067
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,972
Can't you see
she's telling the truth?

1068
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:45,141
That is precisely her mistake.

1069
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:47,893
- I don't see why.
- You will. You will.

1070
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:49,729
The judge reasoned it out.

1071
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:53,149
Owen enticed us to this island

1072
01:16:53,233 --> 01:16:55,026
to be punished for
our past crimes.

1073
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:56,485
Right.

1074
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:01,407
We three have admitted,
shall I say, our guilt.

1075
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:02,825
Right.

1076
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:04,493
Therefore, we cannot
be interested in

1077
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:06,996
- the punishment of crime.
- Right.

1078
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,874
Conclusion: Owen is the one

1079
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,251
who has not committed
any past crimes.

1080
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:15,588
I get it!
What a wonderful brain.

1081
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:18,341
To think he couldn't
save his own life.

1082
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:19,759
Yes, but he saved ours.

1083
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:21,844
Yes of course,
that's the important thing.

1084
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:26,098
Do you understand now,
Mr. Lombard?

1085
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:29,268
Oh, it's great. Convincing.
Mathematical deduction.

1086
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,522
Oh, wait a minute.

1087
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:35,775
- Oh, no!
- Not you either, Blore.

1088
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:39,987
Now nobody has it.

1089
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,614
That's an excellent arrangement.

1090
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:44,617
- Now we can all sleep.
- Let's turn in, gentlemen.

1091
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,377
Good night, gentlemen.

1092
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:57,380
Doctor, I find one
flaw in your theory.

1093
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:59,715
I could destroy
it in four words.

1094
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,550
Do you want to hear them?

1095
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:05,805
Suppose I said: I am Mr. Owen.

1096
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:12,269
It would be most interesting.
But quite unlikely.

1097
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,649
Trouble with you, Lombard,
is nobody could believe you.

1098
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,110
Too bad.
I was just trying to be helpful.

1099
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,820
Good night. Sleep well.

1100
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:22,738
I hope I will.

1101
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:25,324
I'm sure I will.

1102
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:37,104
How long have you
been out there?

1103
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,981
Shh. Not so loud.

1104
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:41,108
But how long have
you been out there?

1105
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:43,152
Ever since you
put out your light.

1106
01:19:43,236 --> 01:19:44,653
Why?

1107
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,910
I wanted to be here to
welcome Mr. Owen.

1108
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:54,079
Locking you in this room and
leaving the key outside

1109
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:55,581
is a little too obvious,
isn't it?

1110
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:57,750
It's the doctor or Blore.

1111
01:19:57,834 --> 01:19:59,710
And unless I am mistaken,

1112
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,921
one of them is going to come
through that door at any minute.

1113
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:05,841
How do I know he's
not here already? You.

1114
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,677
If you believe that you wouldn't
have opened your window.

1115
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:12,139
- What about me?
- Hmm. You're not smart enough.

1116
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:15,017
A quick thinking girl would have
confessed to any old crime,

1117
01:20:15,101 --> 01:20:17,853
in order to clear herself of
what's happened in this house.

1118
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:23,776
Are you sure, you didn't
kill this fellow, Barclay?

1119
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:28,280
Maybe you forgot about it.

1120
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:33,118
Or maybe he never existed.

1121
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:38,249
- Yes, he did.
- Or maybe, he was never killed.

1122
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:42,461
Yes, he was.

1123
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:50,052
By someone who was close to you?
And you were suspected?

1124
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:55,057
What happened to that someone,
who was close to you?

1125
01:20:56,059 --> 01:20:57,977
She was my sister.

1126
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:02,356
I took care of her
to the very last.

1127
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:07,570
Oh, now I see that Mr. Owen
isn't infallible.

1128
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,405
You don't belong in this house.

1129
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:10,906
You haven't killed
your way into it.

1130
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:12,324
Aren't you ashamed

1131
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,660
of taking this ever so lightly,
Mr. Lombard?

1132
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:17,913
Don't call me Mister.
And don't call me Lombard.

1133
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:19,999
I'll tell you something
about Mr. Lombard.

1134
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:22,084
Something else that Mr. Owen
doesn't know...

1135
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:23,502
Listen!

1136
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:31,427
Give me a chance to grab him
when he comes in.

1137
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:33,679
Don't shoot unless you have to.

1138
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:49,361
- He's going away.
- Down the stairs.

1139
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,196
I'm going to find out.

1140
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:55,951
I forgot. It's locked.

1141
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:59,955
- I'll go around the other way.
- Take the gun.

1142
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,540
Oh you keep it,
in case I can't get back.

1143
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:02,958
But he might kill you.

1144
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:05,210
If he does, he's going to
make a serious mistake.

1145
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:09,131
The other thing he doesn't
know is I am not Mr. Lombard.

1146
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:49,004
Now, we'll find out.
It's either Blore or the doctor.

1147
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:50,673
The one, who's not in his room.

1148
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:54,802
Blore!

1149
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:57,680
Blore! Get up. Open the door.

1150
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:03,185
Who let that girl
out of her room?

1151
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:05,854
Never mind about her.
Come on, Blore!

1152
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,776
He's not here.
Now we know who it is.

1153
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:13,278
I heard him go downstairs.
Come on, Blore. We'll catch him!

1154
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:17,533
How do I know you
heard the doctor?

1155
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:19,118
Don't be a fool, Blore.

1156
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:22,121
- We've no time to waste.
- Ah, life is short, isn't it?

1157
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:25,290
- But I heard him too Mr. Blore.
- Oh, you did, did you?

1158
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:28,544
That's a nice present,
you've got there.

1159
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:30,379
Mr. Lombard's getting generous.

1160
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:33,382
- You go first!
- Come on, Vera!

1161
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:50,065
Might be a trick.

1162
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:52,317
Right, Blore.
Maybe, he's in the house.

1163
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:02,745
One. Two. Three.
Three Indians only.

1164
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,123
He wants to make
us think, he's dead.

1165
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,584
That's to throw
us off the track.

1166
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:12,421
You don't fool us this time,
Dr. Armstrong!

1167
01:24:16,092 --> 01:24:17,926
Who's there?

1168
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:53,337
Lombard!

1169
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:00,094
Blore. What are you doing
down there alone?

1170
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:01,804
I think I know where
the doctor is.

1171
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:03,222
Where?

1172
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:04,807
I'm not sure yet.
I'll wait for you.

1173
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:07,059
Alright. We shan't be long.

1174
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:00,445
I get it!

1175
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:28,182
Aren't you being careless,
unlocking your door

1176
01:26:28,224 --> 01:26:29,683
when you don't know
who's out here?

1177
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:31,226
But I thought it was you.

1178
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:34,563
- You heard it too, eh?
- I heard you pass my door.

1179
01:26:35,398 --> 01:26:38,567
Not me. I thought I heard you.

1180
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,320
Are you sure you haven't
been outside of your room?

1181
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:44,573
I wanted to ask
you the same thing.

1182
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,577
Maybe, Mr. Blore came
back to his room.

1183
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:50,245
No, no-no.
I knocked on his door.

1184
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,872
I heard a noise
while I was dressing.

1185
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:54,124
- Like a door slamming?
- Exactly.

1186
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,834
You heard it too, huh?

1187
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,923
- What is it?
- Oh, I don't know.

1188
01:27:01,424 --> 01:27:03,842
I feel all the time that
there's someone...

1189
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,428
someone waiting and watching?

1190
01:27:06,512 --> 01:27:07,846
Yes, I know what you mean.

1191
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:10,224
- Oh, it's just nerves.
- Then you have felt it.

1192
01:27:10,308 --> 01:27:11,975
Keep a grip on
yourself, darling.

1193
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,769
There's nothing supernatural
about this business.

1194
01:27:13,853 --> 01:27:15,270
It's definitely human.

1195
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:17,189
- You mean, it's the doctor?
- The mad doctor.

1196
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:19,524
- Hiding here?
- We'll soon find out.

1197
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:23,528
Aaah!

1198
01:27:43,716 --> 01:27:45,968
He must have been
looking that way.

1199
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:50,138
And while he was looking,
Dr. Armstrong...

1200
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:53,183
That was Armstrong
we both heard.

1201
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,227
But what was Blore looking at?

1202
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:01,650
What do you see?
What is it?

1203
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:05,654
- It's impossible!
- Let me see!

1204
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:11,660
You're going to see.
Come with me.

1205
01:28:15,331 --> 01:28:17,666
What is it? What is it? Tell me.

1206
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:49,489
Look!

1207
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:56,538
Armstrong.
He's been dead for hours.

1208
01:28:57,415 --> 01:29:00,375
- For hours?
- Since the last tide.

1209
01:29:00,918 --> 01:29:03,045
No footprints around the body.

1210
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:12,512
But if he was...
Who killed Blore?

1211
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:15,974
Yes, there are only two people
alive on this island.

1212
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:17,976
- You.
- And you.

1213
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:21,063
So this is how it ends, Vera.

1214
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:25,233
This is how it ends.
We come to the truth now.

1215
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:27,986
Yes, the truth.
The entire truth.

1216
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:29,738
Don't come any closer!

1217
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,576
Oh, I see.
That's not quite right, my dear.

1218
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:36,578
It doesn't fit in your
nursery rhyme.

1219
01:29:36,662 --> 01:29:38,747
Don't try to talk your way out.

1220
01:29:38,831 --> 01:29:42,834
You made one mistake,
giving me this revolver.

1221
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:44,753
Look, I don't mind being killed.

1222
01:29:44,837 --> 01:29:47,422
But I hate like the devil to
be killed for someone else.

1223
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:49,341
Didn't I tell you I
wasn't Lombard?

1224
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:51,343
- What is your name?
- Charles Morley.

1225
01:29:51,427 --> 01:29:53,011
You're not a very
good detective.

1226
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:54,638
Mr. Blore spotted the
initials on my luggage,

1227
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:56,098
the moment I arrived here.

1228
01:29:56,182 --> 01:29:57,599
Why did you come here
under another name?

1229
01:29:57,683 --> 01:30:00,018
I knew Lombard very well.
He committed suicide.

1230
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:02,187
I wanted to find out
if Mr. Owen's letter

1231
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:03,605
had anything to do with it.

1232
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:05,107
Do you expect me
to believe that?

1233
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:06,441
Why not?

1234
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:08,193
There's something much more
difficult to believe.

1235
01:30:08,277 --> 01:30:09,861
That one of us is Mr. Owen.

1236
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:12,781
I know I'm not, and I simply
can't believe that you are.

1237
01:30:12,865 --> 01:30:15,700
Don't try to fool me.
I know I'm not.

1238
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:20,288
It's got to be you.
There's no other explanation.

1239
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:23,041
If you're so sure, go
ahead and shoot me.

1240
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,043
You see? You have a doubt.

1241
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,462
Don't come any closer.
I'll shoot.

1242
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,047
No you won't. You can't shoot.

1243
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:30,799
You still trust me,
and I still trust you.

1244
01:30:30,883 --> 01:30:33,385
There's got to
be an explanation.

1245
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:39,641
Yes, that's it!
You've got to shoot me!

1246
01:30:39,725 --> 01:30:42,310
- Now shoot!
- But it won't hit you.

1247
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:45,313
That's what I mean! Shoot, and
don't be frightened if I fall.

1248
01:32:04,435 --> 01:32:06,728
A game of the mind,
Miss Claythorne.

1249
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:09,314
You came just in time
for my last shot.

1250
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:11,900
And now the game is over.

1251
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:18,490
One little Indian
boy left all alone.

1252
01:32:18,574 --> 01:32:20,575
He went and hanged himself.

1253
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,160
And then there were none.

1254
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:24,079
That's for you, Miss Claythorne.

1255
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:27,082
What if I don't agree
to hang myself?

1256
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:29,918
Oh, that's been taken care of.

1257
01:32:31,254 --> 01:32:33,421
Do you mind if I sit down?

1258
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:36,174
Every artist has a certain
amount of vanity.

1259
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:39,427
We all like the
approbation of the public.

1260
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:41,513
And you are my last public.

1261
01:32:41,722 --> 01:32:44,182
I had two great ideas.

1262
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:48,103
The first was a search for
perfect human justice.

1263
01:32:48,187 --> 01:32:52,357
And you've seen the result.

1264
01:32:52,858 --> 01:32:57,112
To perfect this scheme,
my second idea

1265
01:32:57,196 --> 01:32:59,364
was to find an
unwitting accomplice

1266
01:32:59,448 --> 01:33:02,450
among the criminals
invited here for punishment.

1267
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:05,620
I needed a respectable fool.

1268
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:08,123
And naturally I selected

1269
01:33:08,207 --> 01:33:11,209
a man whose fear of death

1270
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:13,878
might make him
extremely cooperative.

1271
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:16,464
I proposed a scheme to confuse

1272
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:18,466
the imaginary Mr. Owen.

1273
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:20,468
It was simply this:

1274
01:33:20,553 --> 01:33:23,013
I must appear to
be the next victim.

1275
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,973
Remember the seaweed?

1276
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:27,475
Armstrong and I
placed it in your room.

1277
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,978
Your scream was perfect.

1278
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:35,692
We pretended to rush out, but
according to our plan,

1279
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:37,402
we came back.

1280
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:41,323
Now, I was assumed to be dead.

1281
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:46,578
Killed by that gun,
I had borrowed from Mr. Lombard.

1282
01:33:46,662 --> 01:33:49,831
And which he found
later on the steps.

1283
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,085
I counted on everyone's
confusion in the dark.

1284
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:58,923
And I counted on Armstrong
to play his part to the hilt.

1285
01:34:09,518 --> 01:34:13,104
I knew no one would challenge
the doctor's authority.

1286
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:16,358
When he would say: He has
been shot through the head.

1287
01:34:16,567 --> 01:34:20,028
After that, I had
to play my part.

1288
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:22,864
And what a part it was!

1289
01:34:23,115 --> 01:34:26,951
No one would suspect me,
least of all the dear doctor,

1290
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:31,790
who thought I was about to
discover the unknown murderer,

1291
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:34,125
and was waiting for
me on the beach.

1292
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:36,795
And worrying about
the success of our plan.

1293
01:34:36,879 --> 01:34:40,799
A few minutes later, he had
nothing more to worry about.

1294
01:34:40,966 --> 01:34:44,886
Justice had triumphed
once again.

1295
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:47,555
Too late, he had
learned that drinking,

1296
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:51,726
when it gets out of hand,
can be fatal.

1297
01:34:51,894 --> 01:34:56,981
So you see, the whole thing
has been as inevitable

1298
01:34:57,066 --> 01:34:58,817
as the nursery rhyme.

1299
01:34:59,151 --> 01:35:01,486
When the boat arrives
from the mainland,

1300
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:03,988
there will be ten dead
bodies and a riddle,

1301
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:06,324
no one can solve
on Indian Island.

1302
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:07,992
Ten?

1303
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:11,413
My dear child,
I'm an old and sick man.

1304
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:14,249
I received my death
sentence a year ago.

1305
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:18,086
Rather than go
painfully and slowly

1306
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:21,589
I choose to leave
this wicked world

1307
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:24,426
with a proud record
of good deeds.

1308
01:35:26,178 --> 01:35:29,013
But how can you force me
to hang myself?

1309
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:31,850
The only living
person found here

1310
01:35:31,934 --> 01:35:34,769
with nine corpses,
will certainly be hanged.

1311
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:37,272
As the last little Indian,
has to be.

1312
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:42,944
Public hanging isn't pretty.

1313
01:35:43,028 --> 01:35:46,614
If you'll allow me to give
you a piece of friendly advice,

1314
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:49,117
do it now, privately.

1315
01:35:49,201 --> 01:35:51,578
It's more dignified.

1316
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:59,544
And now my work is done.

1317
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:10,013
Never should trust a woman.

1318
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:14,642
Thanks for the advice, Mr. Owen.

1319
01:36:15,227 --> 01:36:16,811
But if I hadn't
trusted you, darling,

1320
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,229
and you hadn't trusted me...

1321
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:20,064
By the way,
why did you trust me?

1322
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:21,733
Why did you?

1323
01:36:21,817 --> 01:36:25,278
On account of one thing,
Mr. Owen couldn't foresee.

1324
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:29,657
Aaah! Somebody!
Somebody's still alive!

1325
01:36:34,705 --> 01:36:36,498
Good morning.

1326
01:36:37,833 --> 01:36:40,919
- Ready to leave now?
- Ho, ho, are we!

1327
01:36:41,003 --> 01:36:43,087
Are the others ready too?

1328
01:36:43,839 --> 01:36:45,924
You call them.

1329
01:36:46,305 --> 01:37:46,168
