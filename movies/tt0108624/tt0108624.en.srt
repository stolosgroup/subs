00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:53,650
There was a legend, that, Kwok Ching
and his wife Wong Yung

3
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,775
got the sword of Yeung Guo.

4
00:00:56,775 --> 00:01:00,150
They mixed it with fine gold
and made two swords.

5
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,817
One is called Tao-lung
and the other named Yee-tin.

6
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:06,358
They also wrote all they've learnt
together with Yue-fei's tactics

7
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:10,025
and the secret of the most powerful
Kung Fu scroll, the Lunar Secret

8
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:11,858
was hidden inside the swords.

9
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:14,900
Whoever got it, whoever
could rule the world of martial arts.

10
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:21,025
The supreme of
the world of martial arts...

11
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:34,775
Kung Fu Master

12
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:46,192
Thus, no matter evil or virtuous,

13
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:48,650
in order to get these two weapons

14
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,775
numerous fights were caused...

15
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:56,442
Two groups were thus formed.

16
00:01:56,442 --> 00:01:59,817
One was headed by Shaolin.

17
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:00,817
Shaolin.

18
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:01,942
Wu-tong.

19
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:03,150
Ngo-mei.

20
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,067
Kun-lun.

21
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:06,025
Hung-fling-

22
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:08,233
Hwa-shan.

23
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:14,817
Their opponent was the Fire Sect
which was came from Persia.

24
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:16,358
They called themselves the Ming Sect.

25
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:19,108
But, they were named
the Evil Sect by others.

26
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:22,442
They were so mysterious and
were always against the Yuan Dynasty.

27
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,983
Ming Sect always caused riots
against the government.

28
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:26,150
Their headquarters were located
at the Bright Summit.

29
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,775
Four branch-leaders - Purple, White,
Golden and Green were all powerful.

30
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,525
They were: Queen of Purple Dragon.

31
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:34,025
King of White Eagle.

32
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:35,400
King of Golden Lion.

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,858
And King of Green Bat.

34
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,858
Two groups were
strongly against each others.

35
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:44,400
Their fellows couldn't
make friends with each other.

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,275
Otherwise, they could be killed.

37
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:50,900
Chang Tsui-san,
the 5th student of Chang San-fung

38
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,650
was a righteous and hero,
disregarded the unreasonable rules

39
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,150
and fell in love with Yan So-so,
the daughter of King of White Eagle.

40
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,483
He even make friend and be brothers
with Tse Shun, King of Golden Lion.

41
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:10,317
Shing Kwun,
King of Golden Lion's master

42
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:12,525
in order to help Yuan's government
to destroy Ming Sect,

43
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,192
he killed Tse Shun's family.

44
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:15,567
Tse Shun risked his life to seize

45
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:17,192
the To-lung Sword
to take revenge for his family,

46
00:03:17,192 --> 00:03:19,317
end up, he killed many innocent lives.

47
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:23,567
Go!

48
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:28,525
Tsui-shan and So-so

49
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:31,775
didn't want others
to know Tse's whereabouts,

50
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:35,942
so they went to
a nobody-land - Ice and Fire Island

51
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:38,442
and live in seclusion.

52
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:40,442
Although he got the sword,

53
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:43,650
Tse Shun couldn't get
the secret of the To-lung Sword,

54
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,025
until the one hundredth birthday
of Chang San-fung.

55
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:49,983
Tsui-san brought his wife
and his son Mo-kei

56
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:51,692
to visit his master.

57
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:06,108
Crab in sugar candy.

58
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:07,067
I want it.

59
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:08,983
- Please give me one.
- Alright.

60
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:10,733
Pick yourself.

61
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:13,733
Mo-kei, enjoy it. Good boy.

62
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,358
- Thank you mom.
- Let's go.

63
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:17,442
- Is it yummy?
- Yes.

64
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:22,275
I asked you not to get down.

65
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,442
This is about Wu Tong Mountain.
I think it doesn't matter.

66
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,067
It's hard to tell.

67
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:28,525
For To-lung Sword,
they can do whatever in mind.

68
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:30,942
Dad, why do they want
Godfather's To-lung Sword?

69
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,108
I have told you many times.

70
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:39,483
Don't mention your Godfather's name,
don't you remember?

71
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,317
I won't do that again.

72
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:42,192
Remember

73
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:46,358
no matter who asks
about your Godfather,

74
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:49,858
no matter how they push you,
don't say a word about Godfather.

75
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:51,108
Yes.

76
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:53,983
Dad said that
we can't betray our friends,

77
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:55,858
or it will be non-righteous.

78
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:57,608
Good boy.

79
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:00,567
I think Master will like you.

80
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,983
Is Grand-master kind?

81
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:04,483
He is the kindest one
among the kindest.

82
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:09,608
Chang Tsui-san...

83
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:10,858
It hurts.

84
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:11,983
It's "The Cry from Jinx",

85
00:05:11,983 --> 00:05:14,025
it will affect one's mind.
Resist it with your inner power.

86
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:16,775
Or, you will hypnotize
and lose your mind.

87
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,608
Who are you? Please show up.

88
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,150
Jinx's palm?

89
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:44,150
Mo-kei.

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,650
Are you the notorious "Jinxs"?

91
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,275
Chang, if you want your son back,

92
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:58,192
tell us where
the King of Golden Lion is.

93
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,567
Stop dreaming.

94
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,525
If we hit your son with
our "Jinx's Palm", what do you think?

95
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:04,400
How dare you?

96
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,442
The kid is innocent.
Why do you ill treat this kid?

97
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:11,317
If you let him go,

98
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:13,817
Wu-tong and the Ming Sect
will appreciate so much.

99
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:16,900
Are you threatening me
with Wu-tong and Ming Sect?

100
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,317
Even that old jerk Chang San-fung
is here, I won't be scared.

101
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:21,525
Don't you?

102
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:24,942
Master...

103
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:28,275
I, Chang San-fung,
beg you to let the boy go.

104
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:30,650
I see, the famous Chang San-fung

105
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,567
is ust a fatty.
I am all eyed.

106
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:35,692
Right,

107
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:40,692
my name is being exaggerated.
It's not a big deal.

108
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:44,233
Fatty, if you are afraid of
my "Jinx's Palm",

109
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,233
ask your student to tell us
where Tse Shun is.

110
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,192
Right. It is because of one girl.

111
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:52,317
Tsui-san, told them then.

112
00:06:52,317 --> 00:06:55,192
Master, Tse Shun is my buddy.

113
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:57,108
If I betray him, I am not righteous
and not loyal to my buddy.

114
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:58,108
Right,

115
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:01,317
how can you be non-righteous?
How can you face others then?

116
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:04,233
Please give us face then.

117
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:07,692
Old bluffer, step aside
if you are afraid to death.

118
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:10,233
Or you will die
on your 100th birthday.

119
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:14,608
It's useless to sigh.

120
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,900
You assholes, I think that

121
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,150
I shouldn't quarrel or get angry
on my 100th birthday.

122
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,108
You two forced me to break my rule.

123
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:28,775
I must teach you a good lesson.

124
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:29,525
Brother.

125
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,525
If you hit him once,
I'll hit him 100 times then.

126
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,525
Hubby, your master
is so hot tempered.

127
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,983
He is always hot tempered.

128
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Okay, let's release
the hostages together.

129
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,483
Okay, I don't think
you would pull off a shunt.

130
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,775
One

131
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,608
two

132
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:51,650
three.

133
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:55,900
Mo-kei.

134
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:01,525
Mo-kei.

135
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:09,400
- Watch out.
- Let's go.

136
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,317
Jinx's Palm?

137
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,150
Mo-kei.

138
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,817
Take Mo-kei to Shaolin... no...
Take him to Wu-tong.

139
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:24,525
I will get the antidote
from that two guy.

140
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:36,483
Don't! If we go on like this,
Mo-kei will be killed.

141
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,233
Cut.

142
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:40,108
Mo-kei.

143
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:43,025
Mo-kei.

144
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,483
Brother, how is he?

145
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,358
Jinx's Palm is so powerful.

146
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,858
I think, we have to
wait for Master's antidote.

147
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:53,858
How is Mo-kei...

148
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:54,858
Mom

149
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:58,150
I feel pain!

150
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,400
Don't panic, Mo-kei!

151
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:03,900
Here are some candies.

152
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,275
Eat one and taste it if you feel pain.
So you won't feel pain anymore, got that?

153
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,358
Uncles,

154
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:15,150
The representatives of Shaolin,
Ngo-mei, Hung-tung,

155
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,025
Wah-shan and Kun-lun
are approaching here.

156
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:17,983
They seems to
come celebrating Master's birthday,

157
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:20,400
in fact, they want Uncle Chang to tell
where King of Golden Lion is.

158
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:34,150
Today is the birthday of my master.

159
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,900
He asked us not to
make any grand celebration

160
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,192
so he may enjoy a peaceful birthday.

161
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:42,650
We appreciate your visit
and we will express our thanks later.

162
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,817
Please go back.

163
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:50,692
We dare not to disturb Master Chang

164
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:53,567
but he has to hand out
Chang Tsui-san and Yan So-so

165
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,567
and tell us
where is the King of Golden Lion.

166
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:57,900
Then, we will leave at once.

167
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,442
Mastress No-mercy,
where do you think it is?

168
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:04,650
How dare you get anyone you wish?

169
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,983
In order to take revenge
for the victims killed by Evil Sect.

170
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:11,442
We want to get Tse Shun by any means.

171
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:15,108
If you don't hand us the wanted.

172
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:18,358
I'll fight with you then.

173
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:20,692
I've heard that you
are great in Kung Fu.

174
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:22,108
I, Sung Yuen-kiu,
would like to offend you now.

175
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:37,858
Chang Tsui-san,
if you won't come out,

176
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:40,358
your seniors will be killed.

177
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:41,233
Stop!

178
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,692
Mastress No-mercy, don't go too far.

179
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:48,025
You are willing to show up
with your bitch!

180
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:49,608
Where is King of Golden Lion?

181
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,858
I won't tell you
my buddy's whereabouts.

182
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:53,608
You deserve it.

183
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:57,275
You want to be friend
with that murderer.

184
00:10:58,108 --> 00:10:59,358
I will wake you up.

185
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,608
Bitch...

186
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:29,192
You?

187
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:32,942
Damn nun...

188
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:39,192
You?

189
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:42,525
Watch my powerful Yee-tim Sword!
It's no big deal.

190
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:48,442
If your master Kwok Shang
were not my best friend,

191
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,025
I wouldn't give you face today.

192
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:52,817
There will only be bad luck to the world
if Yee-tin Sword is with you.

193
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,692
I will keep this sword
for you're your master for 7 years.

194
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:57,900
7 years later, ask a better student
to collect it back.

195
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:02,942
Chang San-fung, how dare
you protect your sinful student?

196
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,067
If we attack you together,

197
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:09,650
I don't think you can kill all of us.

198
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,108
When you are exhausted,
you will be in deep shit too.

199
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,608
How dare you? Are you threatening me?

200
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:17,858
Master, I will be the one
wholly responsible for this matter.

201
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:20,608
They come for me only.
Let me settle by myself.

202
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:23,983
Okay! You may settle by yourself.

203
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:26,983
About fighting,
I have never been scared.

204
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:27,983
Are you threatening me?

205
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:33,358
Seniors

206
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:38,608
if you want me to tell
my brother's whereabouts.

207
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:43,608
In fact, you want his sword
and be the supreme only.

208
00:12:44,483 --> 00:12:47,358
I will never betray my friend.

209
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:51,983
But I don't wanna my master
to risk his life with you

210
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:54,775
at his old age.

211
00:12:56,608 --> 00:13:00,025
Well, I will give you an answer now.

212
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,275
Tsui-san...

213
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:33,817
Dad!

214
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:35,525
Dad!

215
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,775
Dad!

216
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,400
Why do you kill yourself?

217
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,525
Mom

218
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:50,192
Mom! Why did Dad do so?

219
00:13:51,817 --> 00:13:52,650
Mo-kei,

220
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,525
recognize each face.

221
00:13:57,817 --> 00:13:59,317
Remember them one by one.

222
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:01,442
You have to remember all their faces.

223
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:06,692
Each of them is stained
with your Dad's blood.

224
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,817
Did they push Dad to death?

225
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,525
You have to take revenge for your Dad.

226
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:16,192
Don't let them escape.

227
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:21,233
Madam Yan, we feel sorry for
the death of your husband.

228
00:14:21,858 --> 00:14:26,483
Now, you are the only one
who knows where Tse Shun is.

229
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:33,483
Master Hung Man, come here,
I will tell you.

230
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,608
But will you let my son and me to go?

231
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,108
Monks don't take their words back.

232
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:42,108
Okay, I will tell you only.

233
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,608
Madam, can you make it clear?

234
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:51,983
Master, King of Golden Lion
is living there.

235
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:54,942
Wish you to get the Sword soon.

236
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,608
- Madam...
- Where is he?

237
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,900
- She didn't tell.
- You wanna get the Sword alone!

238
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:03,858
Mom.

239
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:12,233
Mo-kei, mom cheated them.

240
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:14,650
See, how powerful is
my cheating skill!

241
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:18,275
Remember,

242
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:20,983
don't ever trust any woman.

243
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:27,025
More beautiful the woman is,
more capable is she to tell lies.

244
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,817
Mom.

245
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:47,567
We've to take revenge for 5 brothers.

246
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:48,817
Let's forget this, first of all,
to save Mo-kei.

247
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:40,358
Mo-kei...

248
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:44,983
Master.

249
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:47,858
You have terrific inner power.

250
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:49,317
So what?

251
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:52,358
In these years, I've never got a way
to cure you from feeling cold.

252
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:56,817
If not the Shaolin monk
jumped from here,

253
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:59,817
he could have cured you
with his "Great Solar Stance".

254
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:00,817
Great Solar Stance?

255
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,983
Great Solar Stance is
the mysterious kung fu of Shaolin.

256
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:05,858
It's as powerful
as the "Great Lunar Stance".

257
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,608
The Scroll has been lost
in Shaolin for 300 years.

258
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:12,192
Accidentally,
a cooking monk in Shaolin

259
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:15,483
discovered it inside a sutra.

260
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,233
After he learnt the kung-fu,

261
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:19,983
he defeated over 30 monks
and then escaped.

262
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:21,483
He even came to challenge me.

263
00:17:35,817 --> 00:17:38,858
Chang, you are really great.

264
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:41,442
Great Solar Stance can make you famous
in this world of martial arts.

265
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:43,483
I think, you are not virgin
before practising such kung-fu.

266
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:45,233
Otherwise,
I couldn't have defeated you.

267
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:53,233
I can't imagine this kind of kung-fu
isn't invincible.

268
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,650
Why should I try so hard
to practise then?

269
00:17:57,525 --> 00:17:59,025
Chang San-fung, see you.

270
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:04,525
Nuts.

271
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:09,650
If he wasn't dead, his kung-fu
would have saved you.

272
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,775
My dear boy, no matter how, you'd be
virgin to practise kung-fu.

273
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,358
So, your kung-fu
would be more powerful.

274
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,025
Don't think I am
a hundred years' old granny.

275
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:17,150
My dick erects every morning.

276
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,275
What?

277
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,775
Why isn't mine do the same?

278
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:23,775
You are weak.

279
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:27,192
Master.

280
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:28,317
What's the matter, Ching-su?

281
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,067
7 years passed.

282
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,900
Ngo-mai's Master No-mercy sent
her student Chow Chi-yu here,

283
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,567
to get back their Yee-tin Sword.

284
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:35,942
Chow Chi-yu?

285
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:15,942
How are you, Master Chang?

286
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:18,858
Is No-mercy's temper better?

287
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:24,358
She's studied Buddhism recently,
she has great improvement.

288
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:27,858
You are a polite girl, it's lucky
for her to get such good student.

289
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:30,567
Mo-kei, return
the Yee-tin Sword to her.

290
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:39,942
Brother Mo-kei, are you
the son of Mr. Chang Tsui-san?

291
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:42,483
I...

292
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:45,817
Yes, Brother Mo-kei is
the orphan left by uncle.

293
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:47,983
lam Sung Ching-su.

294
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:50,150
My dad is the eldest brother
of "Wu-tong seven heroes".

295
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,358
Thank you brother Mo-kei.

296
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:56,650
Chi-yu, why not stay here
for few days?

297
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,733
Let my student Yen-kiu teach you
our sword stance as present.

298
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:01,900
Thank you Master Chang.

299
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:29,025
Brother Mo-kei.

300
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:33,275
Are you supervising them?

301
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,692
Master Chang loves you so much,

302
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:39,692
I think you will
be his successor for sure.

303
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:46,317
Don't worry,

304
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:49,275
Mo-kei can't practise Kung-fu,
we will take care of him.

305
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:51,692
Sister Chi-yu, why don't you guys
practise together?

306
00:20:56,317 --> 00:20:58,150
He was hurt by "Jinx's Palm"
8 years ago.

307
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,442
He can't practise Kung-fu anymore.

308
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:04,775
Dad.

309
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:09,525
Ching-su, Master
wants to practise Tai-chi Sword

310
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,192
for three months.

311
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:13,733
We have to stay with him
in a secret cell.

312
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:18,733
In these three months, you've
to take care of everything in Wu-tong.

313
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:20,358
Thank you, Dad.

314
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:22,817
Ching-su, you have to work hard.

315
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:26,358
In the 3rd generation of Wu-tong,
Mo-kei can't practise Kung-fu.

316
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:28,858
You are the only one
that we have to depend on.

317
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:32,483
Master Chang made
one hundred "Heart Strangthening Pills".

318
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:34,733
You give one pill
per night to Mo-kei

319
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,358
so it can stop him
from feeling cold.

320
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:39,317
Ching-su will
take good care of Mo-kei.

321
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:56,400
What are you doing?

322
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:58,900
Go... go.

323
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,900
Brother Mo-kei, what happened?

324
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:07,400
Someone peeped at you.

325
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,275
Really?

326
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:11,650
They are so bad. I am so scared.

327
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:13,733
They have all gone.

328
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,483
lam still scared.

329
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:16,900
Why not come and accompany me?

330
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,275
I know you would not accompany me.

331
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:35,150
Let me accompany you.

332
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,317
I know you care me most.

333
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,817
Do you feel hot?

334
00:22:42,817 --> 00:22:44,692
- No.
- You are sweating.

335
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,525
How dare you!

336
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,942
Chang Mo-kei,
don't you think you are a lady-killer?

337
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:21,067
Brother Ching-su,
will there be any accident?

338
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,358
Don't worry, I am in-charge now.

339
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:44,692
You Jinx, you dragged
your parents to death.

340
00:23:44,692 --> 00:23:46,942
You only know
how to flatter Master Chang.

341
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:49,567
So he passes you his inner energy
to keep you away from coldness.

342
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:53,233
If he passed me his inner energy
I'd have been top graded Kung-fu master.

343
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:54,483
Your mom is a jinx.

344
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:56,192
You can insult me, but not my mom.

345
00:23:56,192 --> 00:23:58,483
I just wonder you are the blood
of my uncle or not.

346
00:23:58,483 --> 00:24:03,275
Maybe you are a son of a bitch!

347
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,650
Go to hell!

348
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,775
Brother Ching-su.

349
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:15,108
Catch him, I wanna chop his hand off.

350
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:21,400
I see, Wu-tong is not heroic at all!

351
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,275
My friend, who are you?

352
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:26,525
Friend? I am not your friend.

353
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:27,650
Get dressed.

354
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Bitch!

355
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Come down if you have guts.

356
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,067
Wu-tong's kung-fu is nothing special.

357
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,525
The kung-fu of Ming Sect
is much more powerful.

358
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:03,817
Sister Chi-yu, attack her
with your Yee-tin Sword.

359
00:25:04,775 --> 00:25:06,275
You bitch.

360
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:07,817
Yee-tin Sword is really in Wu-tong.

361
00:25:07,817 --> 00:25:10,317
Aren't you leaving? Watch out,
don't let the dogs of Wu-tong kill you.

362
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:12,567
I don't allow you to insult Wu-tong.

363
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:13,817
You must be insane.

364
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:16,150
I will chat with you after the fight.

365
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,858
Bitch, I will let you see
how powerful my sword is.

366
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:49,858
Thank you!
I come for this sword indeed.

367
00:25:49,858 --> 00:25:52,358
I want to break
this unbreakable "Cold-chain".

368
00:25:52,358 --> 00:25:53,483
Wu-tong Sword Stance.

369
00:25:59,108 --> 00:25:59,817
Here I go!

370
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:05,483
Escape.

371
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:13,650
Your kung-fu is so bad.

372
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,275
Forget about me, go now.

373
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:17,525
They would kill you
if they catch you up.

374
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,525
Kidding, you bring me
to this dead end?

375
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,275
Chang, you allied with the Evil Sect
and mess our temple.

376
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:34,025
Now I'll exile you with the name of
Acting In-charge of Wu-tong.

377
00:26:34,983 --> 00:26:37,275
- Wu-tong students have my order.
- Yes.

378
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:38,650
- Kill with no mercy.
- Yes.

379
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,358
Miss, I've cragged you down.

380
00:26:40,358 --> 00:26:41,525
Call me Siu Chiu.

381
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:43,983
How dare you seduce man
in such critical moment?

382
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:45,233
Where can you go?

383
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:21,192
Why do you loose your hands
without any notice?

384
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:22,442
For I touched yours...

385
00:27:25,192 --> 00:27:28,233
Dumb-bell, you must be educated
by your dad.

386
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:30,608
My dad died many years ago.

387
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,567
You called Chang Mo-kei.

388
00:27:33,858 --> 00:27:35,817
Is your dad Chang Tsui-san?

389
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:40,858
- Mr. Chang, I am your maid Siu Chiu.
- Get up first.

390
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:42,733
Siu Chiu is the maid of King
of White Eagle.

391
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:45,483
Because I offended King of White Eagle,
he lock me up.

392
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:47,942
I went into fugitive.
I've heard Yee Tin Sword is in Wu-tong

393
00:27:47,942 --> 00:27:49,317
I want to make use of it.

394
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,608
Luckily I met you
and you saved my life.

395
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:53,858
Get up first.

396
00:27:53,858 --> 00:27:55,817
I am not your master.

397
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:56,942
You touched me again.

398
00:27:59,983 --> 00:28:01,067
You are the grandson
of King of White Eagle.

399
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:02,317
So I have to greet you Mister.

400
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,817
In fact, I haven't seen
my grandfather since birth.

401
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,150
What kind of noise is it? Monster?

402
00:28:16,858 --> 00:28:17,608
<i>Go...</i>

403
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,400
- This way.
- That way.

404
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,400
I can't imagine
there would be visitors for me.

405
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,150
You are...

406
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:53,067
I am the soul of hell.

407
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:56,775
Are you the student of Wu-tong?

408
00:28:56,775 --> 00:28:57,942
lam Chang Mo-kei.

409
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,150
I haven't eaten human flesh
for a long time.

410
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:04,525
Chang San-fung made me suffer here.

411
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:07,525
It's not too much to eat
one of his student, right?

412
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:10,442
Are you the cooking monk?

413
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:12,317
You remember me?

414
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:17,942
The girl behind you is so attractive.

415
00:29:18,442 --> 00:29:20,317
She must be more delicious than you.

416
00:29:20,317 --> 00:29:22,650
She isn't student of Wu-tong,
just come and eat me!

417
00:29:25,817 --> 00:29:28,692
You are heroic too!

418
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:30,692
Senior...

419
00:29:32,525 --> 00:29:35,358
Mister...Mister Chang, how are you?

420
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,233
It's cold...

421
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:44,192
What have you done to him?

422
00:29:44,192 --> 00:29:47,733
Kidding! He has already been
seriously injured.

423
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:52,317
Who hurt you?

424
00:29:52,317 --> 00:29:55,108
I was hit by the "Jinx's Palm"
8 years ago.

425
00:29:58,108 --> 00:30:00,233
Nothing can cure it.

426
00:30:00,483 --> 00:30:05,483
It must be Master Chang passes you
inner energy in these years.

427
00:30:05,942 --> 00:30:07,858
He loves you so much.

428
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:10,858
Senior, I know you can cure him.
I beg you to cure him.

429
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:14,525
My "Great Solar Stance"
is the only solution.

430
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:17,025
But why should I cure Chang's people?

431
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:22,858
Chang Mo-kei, unless
you scold your Master Chang as asshole,

432
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:26,983
I will teach you "Great Solar Stance"
to cure you from coldness.

433
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:28,025
Impossible.

434
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:35,275
You don't save him, that's okay,
why did you hit him?

435
00:30:35,275 --> 00:30:40,275
Just scold Chang as
"Shame-less asshole" for three times.

436
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:44,025
Then you will free
from this kind of suffer forever.

437
00:30:44,775 --> 00:30:47,650
You will also have invincible power.

438
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:50,358
This is a piece of cake.

439
00:30:51,858 --> 00:30:53,525
Follow me,

440
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:59,150
Chang is a shameless asshole...

441
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:06,275
Shameless asshole...

442
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:07,192
is you.

443
00:31:07,192 --> 00:31:10,775
Okay! I will see how can
you get through this night.

444
00:31:14,692 --> 00:31:16,192
Mister...

445
00:31:16,192 --> 00:31:18,067
- It's cold.
- Very cold?

446
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,525
Mister how are you?

447
00:31:23,525 --> 00:31:25,692
- It's cold.
- Still very cold?

448
00:31:25,692 --> 00:31:26,817
It's cold.

449
00:31:28,442 --> 00:31:29,567
It's cold.

450
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:34,525
Will it be warmer?

451
00:32:11,192 --> 00:32:13,317
I'm still alive. I'm still alive.

452
00:32:14,442 --> 00:32:15,608
Mister are you alright?

453
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:16,442
Siu Chiu.

454
00:32:19,775 --> 00:32:21,900
You were lucky last night.

455
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,650
You will ice-cold
two or three times a day.

456
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,358
If no one use the inner energy
to keep your life.

457
00:32:28,358 --> 00:32:30,650
You will die.

458
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,025
You hard-hearted.

459
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:35,900
Chang Mo-kei, if you don't learn
my "Great Solar Stance",

460
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,775
you will suffer coldness
for the rest of your life.

461
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:43,608
Leave Wu-tong, and be my student.

462
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:46,900
Master Chang is so nice to me,
I can't do that.

463
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,858
You are sick.

464
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,608
Why do you push him
to learn your kung-fu?

465
00:32:52,358 --> 00:32:56,483
1 O years ago, I was defeated
by Chang San-fung.

466
00:32:57,858 --> 00:32:59,150
I am so furious.

467
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:02,942
I want my student

468
00:33:02,942 --> 00:33:05,942
to be superior
than any of his student.

469
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,192
Why don't you teach me?

470
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:09,692
If a woman practise
"Great Solar Stance",

471
00:33:09,692 --> 00:33:10,817
one year later,

472
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:14,025
she will have flat chest,
with hairy arms and legs,

473
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:17,442
with beard and man's voice.

474
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,150
Do you want it?

475
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:21,567
Forget it.

476
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:24,817
Mister, his backbone is broken,
he moves with that ball.

477
00:33:24,817 --> 00:33:25,900
Why not promise him now?

478
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,942
After learning his kung-fu,
then we can take our words back.

479
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,442
Wu-tong student is
always righteous and virtuous!

480
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:35,525
I am a Wu-tong student...
but he forces me to study his kung-fu,

481
00:33:35,525 --> 00:33:37,442
there must be a trick.
I won't learn any of it.

482
00:33:37,442 --> 00:33:39,317
I don't think you can push me
to get your kung-fu.

483
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,817
Can't I?

484
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:43,817
Siu Chiu.

485
00:34:05,483 --> 00:34:06,858
Let me help you.

486
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:08,108
I don't allow you to do so.

487
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,650
Great Sun appears,
the blood flows backward.

488
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,483
Don't press my head to your ass.

489
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:26,442
Air from belly goes through
the whole body.

490
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:28,692
It's breaking.

491
00:34:32,192 --> 00:34:34,317
Blood Sea. Top of the back.
Solar pool.

492
00:34:34,317 --> 00:34:35,692
Door of life. Ken-suk...

493
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,442
Chang,

494
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:54,317
you have the 1st level
of the Great Solar Stance.

495
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:58,692
You have my kung-fu now.

496
00:34:58,692 --> 00:35:00,692
You can never get rid of it.

497
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:02,442
You...

498
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,650
I'll push you to learn the 2nd level.

499
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,442
Unless you die,

500
00:35:07,442 --> 00:35:10,983
or you are betraying Wu-tong.

501
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:17,317
I am useless to let

502
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:21,317
that evil bitch hit Mo-kei
down the cliff. I was late.

503
00:35:21,317 --> 00:35:24,358
I could only kill the bitch,
but couldn't save Mo-kei.

504
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:29,233
Please kill me,
as compensation to Uncle Chang.

505
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:30,192
Okay, I will kill you now.

506
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:34,108
Yuen-kiu, even you kill him,
you can't save Mo-kei instead.

507
00:35:34,108 --> 00:35:35,608
It's useless to kill him.

508
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:38,483
Brother Ching-su tried his best.

509
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:40,108
Mo-kei is such a poor boy.

510
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:42,858
Death may be a release to him.

511
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:47,858
Shaolin invite us to launch a raid
to Bright Summit.

512
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:50,858
We'd maintain peace and righteousness
of the world of martial arts.

513
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:54,900
Yuen-kiu, lead your juniors,
ching-su and chi-yu to go with you.

514
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,150
Yes, master.

515
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,025
The 9th level

516
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:10,858
"Great Solar in the Sky"

517
00:36:26,608 --> 00:36:30,942
Chang, you have got all stance
from "Great Solar Scroll".

518
00:36:30,942 --> 00:36:34,025
From now on, you are full of
mysterious and powerful energy.

519
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,692
Your wound is cured too.

520
00:36:36,692 --> 00:36:39,275
From now on, it's hard for you
to get hurt or get killed.

521
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:42,817
Master, you made it?

522
00:36:45,317 --> 00:36:46,192
Thank you Master.

523
00:36:47,692 --> 00:36:49,192
Aren't you unwilling to learn
my kung-fu?

524
00:36:49,192 --> 00:36:51,025
It should be a suffering instead.

525
00:36:51,192 --> 00:36:55,900
I know you didn't mean to teach me.
You just let me lose face of my master.

526
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,567
So I just tricked you
to teach me your kung-fu.

527
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:03,692
I have to take revenge for my parents,
I wish to learn it most.

528
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:05,067
You're cunning.

529
00:37:05,442 --> 00:37:08,192
Not only pretty women
are not trustworthy,

530
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:11,275
you can't even trust
those seem to be kind-hearted!

531
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:12,358
I wanna kill you.

532
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,608
I have the same kung-fu as you have.
How can you kill me?

533
00:37:24,817 --> 00:37:26,817
Watch out, he is very powerful.

534
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,858
Senior, please forgive me.

535
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:59,775
You cured me by your kung-fu.

536
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:01,275
Thank you for your lessons.

537
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:03,150
You cunning guy.

538
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,900
If I can make my revenge,
I will come back to save you.

539
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,900
You will die terribly.

540
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,150
Let's wait and see who will die first.
Let's go.

541
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:16,233
See how long
will you two get together.

542
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:18,150
You will not happy ending.

543
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,025
I've made it.

544
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:42,775
Shaolin, Ngo-mei, Hung-tung,
Kwun-lun and Wah-shan,

545
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:45,317
all of you are stained
with the blood of my parents.

546
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:57,150
I want you to repay.

547
00:39:00,817 --> 00:39:02,525
You look horrible.

548
00:39:03,817 --> 00:39:08,400
If you were me, you kept every hatred
inside your heart for 8 years.

549
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,442
To be bullied and insulted
all the time.

550
00:39:11,275 --> 00:39:13,817
When you have a chance to release,
you'll just like what I am doing now.

551
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:16,442
Are you going back to Wu-tong?

552
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:20,108
Sung Ching-su
is the only son of my uncle.

553
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,608
I can't take revenge to him,

554
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:23,358
no way.

555
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:26,942
I won't go back to Wu-tong.

556
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:30,608
With the help of my
"Great Solar Stance",

557
00:39:30,608 --> 00:39:33,233
I can go everywhere.

558
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:35,483
I will go to Bright Summit
to see my Grandfather,

559
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:37,108
and will beg him to unlock you.

560
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,108
Thank you.

561
00:39:38,483 --> 00:39:41,817
We risked our lives together.
Don't call me Mister anymore.

562
00:39:41,817 --> 00:39:44,692
I love to serve you.
Will you let me serve you then?

563
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:47,358
You are so nice to me,
I will always remember it.

564
00:39:47,942 --> 00:39:51,608
Now you are so powerful,
I think you will attract many girls.

565
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:53,733
Then, you will forget me soon.

566
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:57,983
Once there is sun,
I won't let you leave me.

567
00:40:11,025 --> 00:40:11,733
Mister.

568
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,400
Mister, there are candies for sale.

569
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,900
These were the last thing
that my mom brought me.

570
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:31,483
After I was hit by "Jinx's Palm",
she gave me three candies.

571
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:33,025
She asked me to eat one
when I feel pain.

572
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,275
When they died,
you ate the first one, right?

573
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:40,692
I dried these two.
So I've to keep it properly.

574
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:43,942
- Take us some wine and food.
- Yes.

575
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,192
Quick!

576
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,192
The 6 schools of martial arts are
launching a raid to the Bright Summit.

577
00:40:47,192 --> 00:40:50,567
I am sure they will
destroy the Evil Sect.

578
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:55,192
If we are late,
we will miss the great moment.

579
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:56,692
So what if we can catch them?

580
00:40:57,817 --> 00:41:00,442
It means more people
will be sent to hell only.

581
00:41:00,442 --> 00:41:05,400
There are 4 branch leaders
and the "invincible 5 Elements Flag".

582
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,192
Don't you think a small potato
like you can destroy them?

583
00:41:09,192 --> 00:41:10,275
How ignorant are you!

584
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:11,900
She must be somebody in the Evil Sect.
Arrest her.

585
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,567
Yes!

586
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:24,567
Let's hide up first.

587
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:36,858
You're putting a quart
into a pint pot!

588
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:38,567
Is she somebody in the Ming Sect?

589
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:40,608
I've never seen her there before.

590
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:43,983
Let's deal about the raid
to Bright Summit.

591
00:41:43,983 --> 00:41:45,983
I will try my best.

592
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:53,817
Do you know them?

593
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:57,358
Of course, they hit me with
"Jinx's Palm" 8 years ago.

594
00:41:58,317 --> 00:41:59,483
Don't panic.

595
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:02,317
Many powerful kung-fu masters are here,
we can't compete with them.

596
00:42:02,317 --> 00:42:03,900
- Mr. Deer.
- How are you?

597
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,775
Master, we all depend on you.

598
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:10,733
Please send my regards
to His Majesty, see you.

599
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:15,150
Who is hiding?

600
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:15,858
Come out!

601
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:18,400
What are you doing here?

602
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,150
Kid, what are you looking at?

603
00:42:28,983 --> 00:42:30,358
He seems to be familiar to us.

604
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:35,900
Forget it, a couple is
enjoying chatting here.

605
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,650
Let's

606
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:42,358
I just wanna...

607
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:44,025
Luckily you didn't move, see...

608
00:43:01,442 --> 00:43:03,067
This guy must be somebody.

609
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:06,692
Even Deer Man and Crane Man
seem to be his fellows.

610
00:43:06,692 --> 00:43:08,942
Guy? This is a woman.

611
00:43:08,942 --> 00:43:12,775
Woman? She looks like my mom.

612
00:43:12,775 --> 00:43:16,650
She is pretty, so you said
she looks like your mom.

613
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,192
You look like my mom now.

614
00:43:18,192 --> 00:43:19,317
Still kidding?

615
00:43:19,317 --> 00:43:21,692
The Bright Summit is surrounded
by the 6 schools. Let's hurry there.

616
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:27,483
The Evil Sect is well prepared.

617
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:29,483
The "5 Elements Flags"
are all in position.

618
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,858
Even Wai at-siu, King of Green Bat
has come back to help.

619
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:35,733
Even though he is
against King of White Eagle.

620
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:39,858
If Queen of Purple Dragon and
King of Golden Lion are back,

621
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:43,483
it'll be difficult for us
to deal with.

622
00:43:44,608 --> 00:43:46,608
If King of Golden Lion is back,
that's prefect.

623
00:43:46,608 --> 00:43:49,108
We can seize his To Lung Sword.

624
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:50,817
Do you want my Yee-tin Sword too?

625
00:43:50,817 --> 00:43:52,233
That's what I want.

626
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:54,233
I dare not to.

627
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:57,567
Queen of Purple Dragon is
the Holy Lady of Persia's Ming Sect.

628
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,692
She's disappeared for many years.
It's believed that she went to Persia.

629
00:44:00,692 --> 00:44:04,567
After a severe fight,
King of Golden Lion were Blind.

630
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:06,233
It's not difficult to handle him.

631
00:44:07,192 --> 00:44:09,150
But King of White Eagle
and King of Green Bat

632
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,775
are difficult to handle.

633
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:13,775
Uncle, I have an idea.

634
00:44:13,775 --> 00:44:14,483
Go ahead.

635
00:44:16,025 --> 00:44:19,525
King of White Eagle has a grandson.

636
00:44:19,525 --> 00:44:23,858
He is the son of Chang sui-san.
He is called Chang Mo-kei.

637
00:44:23,858 --> 00:44:26,233
He died few months ago.

638
00:44:26,858 --> 00:44:29,150
King of White Eagle doesn't know it.

639
00:44:30,483 --> 00:44:32,733
An old man

640
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:35,858
if he meet his grandson again,
he will be very happy.

641
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:39,900
If his grandson attacks suddenly,

642
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:43,275
it is sure that he will
have great chance to kill him.

643
00:44:43,275 --> 00:44:44,275
Great idea.

644
00:44:44,275 --> 00:44:46,650
So we can kill King of White Eagle
and King of Green Bat easily

645
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,775
and rob all the money of them.

646
00:44:48,608 --> 00:44:51,567
We are from decent schools of
martial arts, how can we do so?

647
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:55,150
You are using my passed nephew.
I don't agree to do so.

648
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,317
Isn't it good? We just
wanna help the poor people only.

649
00:44:58,775 --> 00:45:02,192
I agree with Master Yuen-chun.

650
00:45:03,525 --> 00:45:07,192
You asked someone to act as Chang Mo-kei.
Who is the most suitable person then?

651
00:45:07,192 --> 00:45:10,150
The son of Mr. Sung
is the best choice.

652
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,775
I won't allow our Wu-tong student
to do such thing.

653
00:45:13,942 --> 00:45:16,692
You cunning bastards
are discussing evil traps.

654
00:45:16,692 --> 00:45:18,442
Watch out for being hit by thunder!

655
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:31,650
Bat's down.

656
00:45:32,692 --> 00:45:34,608
It's King of Green Bat, Wai Yat-siu.

657
00:45:37,692 --> 00:45:40,192
Wai, let my wife go.

658
00:45:40,858 --> 00:45:44,108
Your wife is so fat, it's no big deal
for me to suck her blood.

659
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:45,108
Damn it!

660
00:45:51,817 --> 00:45:53,608
No-mercy, you killed my wife.

661
00:45:53,608 --> 00:45:55,192
If anyone is bitten by Wai Yat-siu,

662
00:45:55,192 --> 00:45:58,108
one will lose his mind
and obey Wai only.

663
00:45:58,108 --> 00:46:00,108
If I don't kill your wife,
we will have one more enemy.

664
00:46:00,108 --> 00:46:00,733
You

665
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:02,983
You can't complete with her.

666
00:46:05,108 --> 00:46:07,442
Wai doesn't know
how powerful is Yee-tin Sword.

667
00:46:07,442 --> 00:46:09,233
He used Mrs. Ho to be shield.

668
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,692
I believed that he is hurt
by the energy of my sword.

669
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,650
Your Highness.

670
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Have the 6 schools
arrived the hill side?

671
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,483
They have all arrived, your Highness.

672
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,483
Set the "5 elements position".

673
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:47,150
When they come halfway,
I want half of them to die.

674
00:46:47,275 --> 00:46:47,983
Yes.

675
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,108
I am back.

676
00:46:53,275 --> 00:46:54,983
Your Highness.

677
00:46:54,983 --> 00:46:59,067
Bat, I am glad you come to help,
that means, you really love our sect.

678
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:02,442
Old man, I've got some information.

679
00:47:02,442 --> 00:47:05,025
By the way, I fought with No-mercy.

680
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:07,650
Her Yee-tin Sword is really powerful.

681
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:08,525
Are you alright?

682
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,817
Of course, I'll be alright.

683
00:47:11,692 --> 00:47:13,317
Set the position now.

684
00:47:13,317 --> 00:47:16,525
Someone who claims himself the grandson
of King of White Eagle, Chang Mo-kei,

685
00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:17,900
just kill him without a warning.

686
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:18,567
Yes.

687
00:47:19,442 --> 00:47:20,400
What did you say? My grandson?

688
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,067
They'll send someone to act
as your grandson to assassinate you.

689
00:47:26,192 --> 00:47:28,650
If our "Holy Fire Tablet"
is still here,

690
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,317
I won't scare her Yee-tin Sword.

691
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:31,817
Bullshit!

692
00:47:31,817 --> 00:47:34,067
If our Master Yeung didn't disappear,

693
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:37,733
with his "Magic Stance",
he would have killed them easily.

694
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,733
It hurts.

695
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:44,192
Are you hurt?

696
00:47:44,192 --> 00:47:45,608
Of course.

697
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:48,692
But I can't lose my face
in front of them.

698
00:47:48,692 --> 00:47:50,942
Never mind,
I'll cure you by my inner power.

699
00:47:50,942 --> 00:47:53,983
It's useless, you've to suck
the position of the wound.

700
00:47:53,983 --> 00:47:55,483
- No problem.
- Really?

701
00:47:55,483 --> 00:47:59,108
Yes, I didn't take my words back.

702
00:47:59,108 --> 00:48:00,317
What a good buddy.

703
00:48:00,317 --> 00:48:02,108
Look, the wound is onto my ass.

704
00:48:04,317 --> 00:48:06,608
It's alright if you don't suck,
but you shouldn't kick me!

705
00:48:26,108 --> 00:48:27,108
So many people.

706
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,275
They don't seem to
be the man from Ming Sect.

707
00:48:29,733 --> 00:48:30,900
Why are there so many flags?

708
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,108
This is the code of our Sect.

709
00:48:35,108 --> 00:48:37,025
They have rushed into the forbidden zone
of the 5 Elements Flag.

710
00:48:37,025 --> 00:48:37,775
5 Elements Flag?

711
00:49:41,317 --> 00:49:42,983
Don't retreat!

712
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:46,983
We are from decent schools,
we can't cowards.

713
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:51,733
If someone coward,
someone will be killed.

714
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:54,067
- You are right...
- You go first.

715
00:49:54,067 --> 00:49:56,108
Chi-yu, give me my Yee-tin Sword.

716
00:49:56,108 --> 00:49:57,192
Yes, Master.

717
00:50:11,067 --> 00:50:11,817
Go.

718
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:25,150
Let's chase.

719
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,650
Pals, I am Siu-chiu,
the maid of King of White Eagle.

720
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,608
This is the grandson of King
of White Eagle, Mr. Chang Mo-kei.

721
00:52:53,608 --> 00:52:54,733
You are Chang Mo-kei?

722
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:56,025
Yes, I am.

723
00:52:56,025 --> 00:52:58,025
By the order of King of White Eagle:
Who claims to be Chang Mo-kei,

724
00:52:58,025 --> 00:52:59,650
whoever should be killed. Kill him.

725
00:53:00,775 --> 00:53:01,275
Go.

726
00:53:10,817 --> 00:53:12,025
- Rush over there.
- Hey!

727
00:53:38,942 --> 00:53:40,025
lam Chang Mo-kei.

728
00:53:40,025 --> 00:53:40,942
Kill!

729
00:53:43,192 --> 00:53:44,567
You even don't know who is your enemy,
you deserve to be beaten.

730
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:56,233
Great Solar Stance.

731
00:54:26,358 --> 00:54:27,483
Bravo!

732
00:54:27,483 --> 00:54:29,692
Hero, which school do you come from?

733
00:54:32,608 --> 00:54:34,233
Master, he is Chang Mo-kei.

734
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,650
He is the son of Chang Tsui-san?

735
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:49,775
Why is he so powerful?

736
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:52,608
Where are you taking me to?

737
00:54:52,608 --> 00:54:54,983
- This is the forbidden zone of Ming Sect.
- What? Forbidden zone?

738
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:58,983
Shall we go into?

739
00:54:58,983 --> 00:55:01,150
Other than the master of our sect
can enter before his death.

740
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:05,650
If he dies outside,
the people who carry his corpse

741
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:06,983
should commit suicide in here.

742
00:55:06,983 --> 00:55:07,775
How about you?

743
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,150
lam a maid, King of White Eagle
doesn't let me join the sect.

744
00:55:11,858 --> 00:55:13,275
Don't go.

745
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,733
Go.

746
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:20,650
Damn it, if you move one more step,
I will make you dead terrible.

747
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,442
I would be terrible
if I stay here, you fool.

748
00:55:23,442 --> 00:55:24,317
Mister, let's go.

749
00:55:24,567 --> 00:55:26,317
- Chase them!
- Go!

750
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,025
Commander, what'll we do?

751
00:55:30,692 --> 00:55:32,567
These are graves of our ex-masters.

752
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:34,067
There are many traps inside.

753
00:55:34,067 --> 00:55:36,317
If we enter,
they will be killed for sure.

754
00:55:36,317 --> 00:55:37,942
Let's go back to help.

755
00:55:57,858 --> 00:55:59,358
What's the matter?

756
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:00,483
I am scared.

757
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:03,358
Don't be afraid, look!
They are all skulls.

758
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:06,692
I think they were the one
who carried the corpse, as you said.

759
00:56:07,192 --> 00:56:08,692
Why don't we go out?

760
00:56:08,692 --> 00:56:10,358
We are surrounded by the Flag Soldiers.

761
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:11,733
So many men outside,

762
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:14,442
I don't want to hurt
my grandfather's men with my kung-fu.

763
00:56:14,442 --> 00:56:16,983
I thank, we have no choice
but to go forward.

764
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:20,358
I know there is a road
to get to the Bright Summit.

765
00:56:26,358 --> 00:56:29,358
How do you know that much since you are
only the maid of King of White Eagle?

766
00:56:30,608 --> 00:56:32,233
I heard it, thus I know it.

767
00:56:33,483 --> 00:56:36,067
My grandfather locked you
with such heavy chain.

768
00:56:36,067 --> 00:56:37,358
There must be some reasons.

769
00:56:38,317 --> 00:56:39,983
Who are you? Don't cheat me!

770
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:41,275
Don't you trust me?

771
00:56:41,275 --> 00:56:42,733
<i>T just want to know the truth.</i>

772
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,858
Mister, I have made an oath,
I can't tell anybody.

773
00:56:44,858 --> 00:56:47,025
But I promise,
I didn't mean to hurt your grandfather

774
00:56:47,025 --> 00:56:48,025
and I will never hurt you.

775
00:56:48,858 --> 00:56:50,733
Please let me
keep some secret. Will you?

776
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:54,775
I promise, I will tell you
when it's the time.

777
00:56:54,775 --> 00:56:56,983
Okay, let's talk later.

778
00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:05,150
There are some footprints
on the ground.

779
00:57:13,025 --> 00:57:16,108
Yeung Ting-tin, you are the master
of the Evil Sect, but so what?

780
00:57:16,108 --> 00:57:18,900
Even you took away my lover, so what?

781
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,692
Can't imagine you would die here.

782
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:28,775
I, Shing Kwun, am now using
the 6 schools to destroy your Evil Sect.

783
00:57:29,317 --> 00:57:33,942
I also want to take away
your "Magic Stance" too.

784
00:57:33,942 --> 00:57:36,442
Then, I will be invincible

785
00:57:36,442 --> 00:57:40,442
and to be the Pope of Yuan Dynasty.

786
00:57:40,442 --> 00:57:42,275
Even I don't have the To-lung Sword.

787
00:57:42,275 --> 00:57:44,150
I can still be the Supreme of
the world of martial arts.

788
00:57:46,942 --> 00:57:49,067
The ex-master of Ming Sect
disappeared for over 20 years.

789
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:50,442
In fact, he died right here.

790
00:57:50,442 --> 00:57:53,442
This may be Shing Kwun,
the foe of my Godfather.

791
00:57:54,192 --> 00:57:55,942
I see, he became
the dog of Yuan Government.

792
00:57:55,942 --> 00:57:57,817
He set a variance between
the 6 schools and Ming Sect.

793
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,442
That's why he dragged
my Godfather's family to death.

794
00:58:00,442 --> 00:58:01,275
Who?

795
00:58:03,983 --> 00:58:05,233
Chang Mo-kei.

796
00:58:05,233 --> 00:58:06,567
Didn't you die?

797
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:08,358
What's the enmity
between you and Ming Sect?

798
00:58:08,358 --> 00:58:11,483
What's the enmity between you and my dad?
Why did you drag them like this?

799
00:58:11,483 --> 00:58:15,608
Yeung Ting-tin took my lover from me.

800
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:20,317
I had adultery with his wife for 3 years.
At last, he discovered that.

801
00:58:20,317 --> 00:58:23,358
That's why he got mad.
But he still wanted to kill me.

802
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:25,983
My lover wanted to cover me,
so she committed suicide.

803
00:58:28,108 --> 00:58:30,817
I stayed 20 years
in Shaolin as undercover.

804
00:58:30,817 --> 00:58:33,567
I just wait for this chance
to destroy Ming Sect.

805
00:58:34,108 --> 00:58:36,608
You seduced his wife
and ruined his Evil Sect.

806
00:58:36,608 --> 00:58:39,358
And you claimed yourself reasonable.
What a shame!

807
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:43,108
No matter it's right or wrong,

808
00:58:43,108 --> 00:58:45,400
it's not your turn to criticize me.

809
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:50,858
Chang Mo-kei,
I am sending you to see your parents.

810
00:58:52,483 --> 00:58:53,108
Get lost.

811
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:10,900
What kind of kung-fu it is?

812
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:12,775
Great Solar Stance.

813
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,650
I can't imagine
I would be defeated by you.

814
00:59:17,775 --> 00:59:21,150
Chang Tsui-san had a secret indeed.

815
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:22,150
What is it?

816
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:31,650
Shit!

817
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:33,567
Get away, I try to break it
with my "Great Solar Stance".

818
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,067
Mister.

819
00:59:45,317 --> 00:59:46,692
Don't use
"Great Solar Stance" anymore.

820
00:59:46,692 --> 00:59:48,775
I am afraid that it would collapse.

821
00:59:48,775 --> 00:59:50,150
Are we waiting for death then?

822
00:59:50,775 --> 00:59:51,942
We've to find another exit.

823
01:00:13,817 --> 01:00:14,817
There are some words.

824
01:00:17,483 --> 01:00:20,692
Those who come into this cell.
Should bow to the skeleton

825
01:00:20,692 --> 01:00:23,233
or the soul will give you trouble.

826
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:25,442
We are going to die,
we'll be souls too.

827
01:00:25,442 --> 01:00:27,442
We don't need to scared.

828
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:30,233
Maybe we will be saved.

829
01:00:30,233 --> 01:00:31,983
We should respect the dead,
come and bow.

830
01:00:34,692 --> 01:00:37,067
Master Yeung,
we are forced to disturb you.

831
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:38,233
If we have a chance to get out.

832
01:00:38,233 --> 01:00:39,983
We will revenge for you,
to kill Shing Kwun.

833
01:00:39,983 --> 01:00:41,067
Please bless us.

834
01:00:56,525 --> 01:00:58,483
- What are these words?
- It's the Persia language.

835
01:00:58,775 --> 01:01:00,525
- Can you read it?
- Sure.

836
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,358
After bowing to me,

837
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:05,525
You will have my "Magic Stance".

838
01:01:05,525 --> 01:01:08,025
After you learnt it,
you can push the stone open

839
01:01:08,025 --> 01:01:09,233
and reach Bright Summit.

840
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:14,025
Mister, the "Magic Stance"
is written on the rocks.

841
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:18,525
Master Yeung was really wise.

842
01:01:18,525 --> 01:01:21,233
He knew Shing Kwun
wouldn't bow to him

843
01:01:21,233 --> 01:01:23,358
so he designed such trap.

844
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:25,525
Practise now, then we may get out.

845
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:29,108
But it's not right to
steal Ming Sect's kung-fu.

846
01:01:29,775 --> 01:01:31,525
It's written that,
after you've learnt it,

847
01:01:31,525 --> 01:01:34,067
you should pass a message
on behalf of Master Yeung -

848
01:01:34,067 --> 01:01:36,817
ask King of Golden Lion
to be his successor.

849
01:01:36,817 --> 01:01:39,192
The "Magic Scroll"
should be kept by him too.

850
01:01:39,192 --> 01:01:42,317
Then, get the "Holy Fire Tablet"
from Persia's Ming Sect.

851
01:01:42,317 --> 01:01:44,192
He wanted your Godfather
to be his successor.

852
01:01:44,192 --> 01:01:46,025
Since you are his godson,
it doesn't matter to learn his kung-fu.

853
01:01:46,192 --> 01:01:48,275
But, how long should it take?

854
01:01:49,442 --> 01:01:51,525
It's written that...

855
01:01:51,525 --> 01:01:53,317
It takes 30 years
for ordinary people.

856
01:01:53,317 --> 01:01:57,442
For those great kung-fu masters,
it just take 6 hours.

857
01:01:57,442 --> 01:02:00,150
I have the base of "Great Solar Stance",
I just need 6 hours.

858
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,025
Go ahead then.

859
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:07,692
King of Green Bat, you are hurt.

860
01:02:08,817 --> 01:02:10,442
Don't waste it!

861
01:02:11,942 --> 01:02:14,067
Where are the women?

862
01:02:14,942 --> 01:02:16,067
Over there.

863
01:02:18,608 --> 01:02:20,483
Do you want me
to suck all your blood?

864
01:02:20,483 --> 01:02:22,858
- We are the red cross.
- We come to save.

865
01:02:28,358 --> 01:02:30,108
He is bleeding.

866
01:02:31,317 --> 01:02:32,108
Beat him.

867
01:02:37,483 --> 01:02:40,233
If I were not hurt seriously,
I would have kill you.

868
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,275
Old buffer,
I have stopped the bleeding for you.

869
01:03:05,525 --> 01:03:08,858
King of White Eagle,
you are really something.

870
01:03:08,858 --> 01:03:11,525
We break even.

871
01:03:11,525 --> 01:03:14,525
Dad, he is hurt.
Why don't you kill him?

872
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:16,900
He fought against five,
instead, he won.

873
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,483
If we take such chance,
how can we claim ourselves heroes?

874
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:21,233
Stop!

875
01:03:25,775 --> 01:03:26,525
What's the matter?

876
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:29,275
- You don't attack,
- we, Wah-shan School will attack now!

877
01:03:29,275 --> 01:03:34,275
I can't imagine...

878
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,817
I would be bullied by such jerks.

879
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:40,900
Old bluffer, let's fight together
for our beloved sect.

880
01:03:43,067 --> 01:03:44,692
The Evil Sect
is going to be terminated.

881
01:03:44,692 --> 01:03:49,067
Chi-yu, go with your sisters
to kill all the people from Evil Sect

882
01:03:49,067 --> 01:03:52,400
and extinguish their holy fire.

883
01:03:55,442 --> 01:03:56,317
Yes, Master.

884
01:03:59,817 --> 01:04:02,692
King of White Eagle,
you are a great kung-fu master.

885
01:04:02,692 --> 01:04:04,150
Your "Eagle's claws Stance" is
no one in the world of martial arts.

886
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:06,775
It's as great as
the "Dragon Claws Stance" of Shaolin.

887
01:04:06,775 --> 01:04:07,817
You'd better commit suicide.

888
01:04:16,692 --> 01:04:18,608
Old bluffer, don't be so impulsive.

889
01:04:30,858 --> 01:04:32,692
Listen.

890
01:04:32,692 --> 01:04:35,108
I, Chang Mo-kei request you
to stop for a while.

891
01:04:35,108 --> 01:04:37,733
Mo-kei, aren't you dead?

892
01:04:37,733 --> 01:04:39,317
Is he the son of So-so?

893
01:04:39,317 --> 01:04:40,483
That's your grandson?

894
01:04:40,483 --> 01:04:42,317
Thank you for your concern.

895
01:04:42,317 --> 01:04:44,567
Today, the fight between
Ming Sect and the 6 schools

896
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:47,483
is all a trap set by Shing Kwun,
the master of Tse Shun.

897
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:48,858
Please keep calm
and not to fall into his trap.

898
01:04:48,858 --> 01:04:51,733
Bull shit!
The Evil Sect is so brutal.

899
01:04:51,733 --> 01:04:53,817
Wai Yat-siu needs
blood for practising,

900
01:04:53,817 --> 01:04:56,358
Tse Shun killed many innocent people,
they should be killed.

901
01:04:56,358 --> 01:04:57,817
Yes, I need blood for practising,

902
01:04:57,817 --> 01:05:00,858
but I need chick's blood,
pig's blood and my own blood only.

903
01:05:00,858 --> 01:05:03,400
On that night, Mrs. Ho of Kwun-lun School
was killed by you.

904
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,858
I didn't bite her.

905
01:05:04,858 --> 01:05:09,150
About manslaughter...
Old nun, you killed more than me.

906
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:09,775
You...

907
01:05:10,775 --> 01:05:13,900
Shing Kwun serves Yuan,
he wants us to kill among ourselves.

908
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,150
Mastress, I hope you understand.

909
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:18,025
As you said...
Where is Shing Kwun now?

910
01:05:18,025 --> 01:05:20,025
He went undercover in Shaolin
for over 20 years,

911
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,400
he is masked.

912
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:29,483
How dare you frame
my Uncle Yuen Chun?

913
01:05:30,775 --> 01:05:31,733
Where is Yuen Chun?

914
01:05:31,733 --> 01:05:34,650
He sneaked into the graveyard and
wanted to steal the "Magic Scroll".

915
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:36,650
Master Yeung was
dragged to death by him.

916
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:38,775
Siu Chiu, make it clear.

917
01:05:38,775 --> 01:05:41,650
Grandfather,
I won't let anybody hurt you.

918
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:44,692
You insulted Shaolin
what a big mouth you're having

919
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:46,817
Try my Dragon's Claws Stance.

920
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,817
Master, would you let us go
if I can defeat you?

921
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:56,817
Deal.

922
01:05:59,442 --> 01:06:00,942
So go ahead.

923
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,608
This guy is really powerful.

924
01:07:11,608 --> 01:07:14,150
If I have 6,000 points
He has at least 10,000 points.

925
01:07:29,983 --> 01:07:30,858
Dragon's Claws Stance!

926
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:44,608
OK. Terminate my kung-fu now.

927
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:48,817
I just come to stop your fight
not to create any more troubles.

928
01:07:48,817 --> 01:07:52,442
By the way, I used the kung-fu of Shaolin.
It's not an insult at all.

929
01:07:53,192 --> 01:07:54,275
Please forgive me.

930
01:07:56,942 --> 01:07:57,692
Okay, let's go.

931
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,942
Chang Mo-kei, let me challenge you.

932
01:08:10,942 --> 01:08:12,317
They pushed my dad to death.

933
01:08:12,775 --> 01:08:15,275
Now, they come to slaughter
without reasons.

934
01:08:15,275 --> 01:08:16,692
I have to take revenge for dad.

935
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,525
No way. If I duel with them,

936
01:08:23,525 --> 01:08:25,233
it's being trapped by Shing Kwun.

937
01:08:25,233 --> 01:08:26,150
I must hold my temper,

938
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:28,525
to be supreme,
I can fight with the Gov't.

939
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:31,442
Watch out, you should
pay attention to her sword.

940
01:08:31,442 --> 01:08:33,150
Right, don't fight with her.

941
01:08:34,067 --> 01:08:35,525
Mastress, please go ahead.

942
01:08:40,025 --> 01:08:41,317
Magic Stance!

943
01:08:46,317 --> 01:08:48,442
Damn you nun.

944
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:50,817
- Siu Chiu.
- Yes.

945
01:08:57,817 --> 01:08:58,775
Thank you, mister.

946
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:05,317
Brother Mo-kei, in fact
I was forced to trap you.

947
01:09:05,317 --> 01:09:06,567
Please forgive me.

948
01:09:06,567 --> 01:09:08,442
I have never minded that.

949
01:09:08,442 --> 01:09:10,442
Please bring this sword
to your master.

950
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:14,483
Anybody wants to challenge me again?

951
01:09:17,942 --> 01:09:18,692
Chi-yu.

952
01:09:23,233 --> 01:09:23,858
Brother.

953
01:09:33,983 --> 01:09:35,317
Mister.

954
01:09:36,733 --> 01:09:38,858
Don't die...

955
01:09:38,858 --> 01:09:40,108
Mister. Don't die...

956
01:09:42,317 --> 01:09:45,608
Let's attack them together.
lam sure we can kill him.

957
01:09:45,983 --> 01:09:49,317
Who dares to take their advantage,
Who is going to be Wu-tong's enemy.

958
01:09:49,317 --> 01:09:50,942
You are the bastard,

959
01:09:50,942 --> 01:09:52,650
let's go.

960
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,025
Mister.

961
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:01,025
You can't die, don't leave me.

962
01:10:01,025 --> 01:10:04,025
I am protected by "Great Solar Stance",
I won't die.

963
01:10:04,025 --> 01:10:06,775
But I can't use my kung-fu
in this week.

964
01:10:07,608 --> 01:10:09,775
Mo-kei, take a good rest.

965
01:10:09,775 --> 01:10:12,358
Come back to visit Master Chang
if you have time.

966
01:10:12,358 --> 01:10:15,400
Since we protect you,
we've gone against the other 5 schools.

967
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,233
We should leave as soon as possible.

968
01:10:17,233 --> 01:10:19,983
Or we will be blamed of
being allied with Evil Sect.

969
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:22,275
So what?
Who do you think you are?

970
01:10:22,275 --> 01:10:24,275
Maybe, we will
save your Wu-tong one day.

971
01:10:24,275 --> 01:10:25,775
- What are you bull-shitting?
- Ching-su.

972
01:10:25,775 --> 01:10:26,608
Uncle

973
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:32,650
please bring the Yee-tin Sword
to Master Chang.

974
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:35,942
- Don't let No-mercy get it anymore.
- Alright.

975
01:10:35,942 --> 01:10:37,317
- Mo-kei.
- Mister.

976
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:38,442
Go.

977
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:39,317
Take care.

978
01:10:41,025 --> 01:10:41,775
Mister.

979
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,192
Yan Tin-tsing, Wai Yat-siu and
"5 Elements Flags" greet Master Chang.

980
01:10:48,192 --> 01:10:49,275
I am not your master.

981
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:54,317
There is a tradition that, whoever
uses "Magic Stance" is our master.

982
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:57,942
Our sect has been splitted
in all these years.

983
01:10:57,942 --> 01:11:00,317
King of Golden Lion
and Queen of Purple Dragon

984
01:11:00,317 --> 01:11:03,025
left after fighting
for the leadership.

985
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,192
You saved us.

986
01:11:05,192 --> 01:11:07,567
Other than you who is qualified
be the master then?

987
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:10,775
But Master Yeung wanted
my Godfather to be his successor.

988
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,817
Either you or your Godfather
is the same.

989
01:11:17,692 --> 01:11:18,983
Your Highness.

990
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:22,983
Wah-shan school is coming back
with a troop. They want an attack.

991
01:11:22,983 --> 01:11:25,233
Damn it, what a bastard!

992
01:11:26,317 --> 01:11:29,317
I am Chu Yuen-chang.

993
01:11:29,317 --> 01:11:31,858
Now it's emergency that...

994
01:11:31,858 --> 01:11:34,108
please instruct us what to do.

995
01:11:35,317 --> 01:11:36,608
Since many of you are hurt,

996
01:11:36,608 --> 01:11:40,692
we'd better hide up into the graveyard.
What do you think?

997
01:11:40,692 --> 01:11:43,483
If you are willing to be our master,
we will do whatever you instructed.

998
01:11:45,192 --> 01:11:46,608
Listen, my followers.

999
01:11:46,608 --> 01:11:49,192
Get into the graveyard
and hide up first.

1000
01:11:49,733 --> 01:11:54,608
After we've recovered,
we will take our revenge.

1001
01:11:54,608 --> 01:12:00,275
Bravo, Holy Master...

1002
01:12:22,858 --> 01:12:25,650
Wonderful!

1003
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:30,150
It's really a blessing
to have you be our leader.

1004
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:33,650
Chu Yuen-chang, I just take the post
temporarily for my Godfather.

1005
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:35,525
May I be frank...

1006
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:39,692
although you keep on refusing
to be the Master.

1007
01:12:39,692 --> 01:12:41,567
I could tell from your eyes

1008
01:12:41,567 --> 01:12:45,150
you were willing to be the Master.

1009
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:47,567
We have so many followers,

1010
01:12:47,567 --> 01:12:50,817
and we fight with the gov't continuously.
We have strong power.

1011
01:12:51,817 --> 01:12:55,192
Since you want to take revenge,

1012
01:12:55,192 --> 01:13:00,192
after being the master, you'll
have greater chance to take revenge.

1013
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:03,567
And you may turnover
Yuan Dynasty and to be the King.

1014
01:13:03,567 --> 01:13:05,150
It's possible.

1015
01:13:05,817 --> 01:13:06,817
Cut the crap.

1016
01:13:06,817 --> 01:13:08,442
King of White Eagle is old,

1017
01:13:08,442 --> 01:13:11,900
King of Green Bat is so care free.
They can't assist you much.

1018
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,817
No matter what,

1019
01:13:14,817 --> 01:13:18,192
just instruct me,
I am willing to help.

1020
01:13:18,817 --> 01:13:22,108
From your eyes,
I can tell you are ambitious.

1021
01:13:22,692 --> 01:13:25,858
If I make you my right hand,
you'll have better success.

1022
01:13:27,233 --> 01:13:30,108
You're really wise.
I do want to be the Master,

1023
01:13:30,817 --> 01:13:34,358
but the wise people
is usually disgusting.

1024
01:13:34,358 --> 01:13:37,192
- I understand.
- Get out of here.

1025
01:13:48,817 --> 01:13:52,608
- Master, please let us go.
- Master, forgive us.

1026
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:56,067
Wah-shan is a decent school,
but with you jerks.

1027
01:13:56,067 --> 01:13:59,358
Master, don't kill us.
I will tell you a secret.

1028
01:13:59,358 --> 01:14:00,608
Go ahead.

1029
01:14:00,608 --> 01:14:04,733
Wu-tong students were
attacked by some monks.

1030
01:14:04,733 --> 01:14:08,025
They seem to be from Shaolin.
All the students were caught.

1031
01:14:08,733 --> 01:14:13,025
Master, we've discovered that Mr. Yan
of Wu-tong is hurt. He is ahead.

1032
01:14:13,525 --> 01:14:14,275
Master

1033
01:14:15,275 --> 01:14:16,025
Uncle Yan...

1034
01:14:16,983 --> 01:14:18,775
- Mo-kei.
- How are you?

1035
01:14:18,775 --> 01:14:22,400
We met some Shaolin monks
on our way back to Wu-tong.

1036
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,483
They poisoned us with "Scent"

1037
01:14:26,483 --> 01:14:29,275
which is the most poisonous thing
in this world of martial arts.

1038
01:14:29,275 --> 01:14:32,275
Those who smell or ate it
will lose his kung-fu and energy.

1039
01:14:33,108 --> 01:14:35,275
Only the special antidote
can solve it.

1040
01:14:35,275 --> 01:14:38,608
I held my breathe, so I could escape.

1041
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:43,025
My brothers were all arrested.

1042
01:14:44,775 --> 01:14:48,525
But later, I met two monks,
they were so powerful.

1043
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:52,067
I was seriously hurt,
they broke all my joints.

1044
01:14:52,192 --> 01:14:53,775
They are so cruel.

1045
01:14:53,775 --> 01:14:56,692
Let's go Shaolin and
get my uncles back.

1046
01:14:56,942 --> 01:14:58,067
- It's sold up.
- Right.

1047
01:14:58,067 --> 01:14:59,692
- All hired?
- Yes, you may ask them.

1048
01:14:59,692 --> 01:15:01,067
Go there? OK.

1049
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:06,692
Master, all the doctors around
are hired and all the herbs

1050
01:15:06,692 --> 01:15:09,150
are bought by one person.

1051
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:09,900
It's strange.

1052
01:15:10,442 --> 01:15:12,317
It may be done by the Shaolin monks.

1053
01:15:12,317 --> 01:15:16,692
No, he is living nearby,
a place called "Green Willow Villa".

1054
01:15:16,692 --> 01:15:20,150
Mister, I think they are sure
that we need herbs to cure Yan...

1055
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:21,317
so they set this trap for us.

1056
01:15:22,067 --> 01:15:23,025
Green Willow Villa?

1057
01:15:23,525 --> 01:15:26,858
Green Willow Villa

1058
01:15:31,983 --> 01:15:35,983
Welcome.
My master is long waiting for you.

1059
01:15:35,983 --> 01:15:37,733
May I know his name?

1060
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:40,108
You will know it later.

1061
01:15:47,692 --> 01:15:49,983
Damn it, do you want to trap us?
Speak up, or I will suck your blood.

1062
01:15:49,983 --> 01:15:53,983
My men's blood is stink.

1063
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:58,942
If you want it,
I've prepared some fresh blood for you.

1064
01:15:59,608 --> 01:16:02,733
Why don't you tell us your name?

1065
01:16:02,733 --> 01:16:04,358
lam Chao Min,

1066
01:16:04,358 --> 01:16:07,067
a no-body in the world of martial arts.
It's meaningless to you.

1067
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:08,858
If you are scared, please leave.

1068
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:10,733
Watch out!

1069
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,900
Mister, she is the one
we saw in the restaurant.

1070
01:16:19,358 --> 01:16:22,775
Grandfather, King of Bat,
she is the master of "Jinxes".

1071
01:16:22,775 --> 01:16:24,275
There may be a severe fight later.

1072
01:16:26,525 --> 01:16:29,275
You are really something.

1073
01:16:29,275 --> 01:16:33,983
Couldn't think you are so powerful
when I saw you last time.

1074
01:16:33,983 --> 01:16:36,275
I can't imagine
you could defeat the 6 schools

1075
01:16:36,275 --> 01:16:39,608
and be the master of the Ming Sect.

1076
01:16:39,608 --> 01:16:41,858
What a young hero!

1077
01:16:41,858 --> 01:16:46,275
May I know why did you buy
all herbs and hire all the doctors?

1078
01:16:47,275 --> 01:16:50,317
I have heard that
Mr. Yan was hurt by Shaolin.

1079
01:16:50,317 --> 01:16:51,817
I am afraid that he would be
mis-treated by some poor doctors,

1080
01:16:51,817 --> 01:16:54,567
so I caught
all the poor doctors here.

1081
01:16:56,317 --> 01:17:02,067
Instead, I've prepared
the "Black Jade Paster" for him.

1082
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,192
Mister.

1083
01:17:05,317 --> 01:17:08,067
We are not friends,
why do you help us?

1084
01:17:08,067 --> 01:17:13,025
We make friends with heroes is
always the practice of our Yuan Gov't.

1085
01:17:13,025 --> 01:17:16,317
You are the number one
kung-fu master in the world,

1086
01:17:16,317 --> 01:17:18,650
this doesn't mean anything.

1087
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:21,442
The Black Jade Paster is
the most wonderful medicine in the world.

1088
01:17:21,442 --> 01:17:23,775
How can she give us that easily?

1089
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:26,775
You are Manchurian.

1090
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:28,400
My dad is King of Yue-yang.

1091
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,233
Shaolin is so foolish
to challenge you.

1092
01:17:32,233 --> 01:17:34,692
We will help you to terminate them.

1093
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:37,233
Mister, is it Yee-tin Sword?

1094
01:17:39,983 --> 01:17:40,608
Right.

1095
01:17:41,983 --> 01:17:44,192
We will settle our own matters.

1096
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:45,858
We don't want the interference
from the government.

1097
01:17:45,858 --> 01:17:47,358
Thank you very much.

1098
01:17:48,567 --> 01:17:51,358
Master Chang, please stay,

1099
01:17:51,358 --> 01:17:54,108
I've prepared some food for you.

1100
01:17:54,108 --> 01:17:57,358
I will get changed, may I be excused.

1101
01:17:57,733 --> 01:17:59,733
We are leaving.

1102
01:18:00,483 --> 01:18:03,483
Do you know there is
"Black Jade Paster" or not?

1103
01:18:06,608 --> 01:18:08,567
Damn it, how cocky are you?

1104
01:18:10,692 --> 01:18:11,942
Is it true or not?

1105
01:18:13,858 --> 01:18:14,900
It smells nice.

1106
01:18:17,108 --> 01:18:19,025
This may be a trap, we'd better go.

1107
01:18:19,025 --> 01:18:19,900
- Go.
- Yes.

1108
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:27,608
You...

1109
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,983
Master, we are so tired,
we lost our energy.

1110
01:18:32,608 --> 01:18:37,025
My brothers are all poisoned by this.

1111
01:18:37,608 --> 01:18:39,483
I am the only one
who held the breathe.

1112
01:18:39,483 --> 01:18:40,650
What can we do now?

1113
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:42,275
I will get the antidote from her.

1114
01:18:42,275 --> 01:18:43,983
Siu Chiu, take care of here.

1115
01:19:07,317 --> 01:19:10,442
You do keep your promise.

1116
01:19:10,442 --> 01:19:13,192
You come to drink with me.

1117
01:19:15,025 --> 01:19:17,567
Why do you trap us?

1118
01:19:19,192 --> 01:19:22,317
Master Chang, no one asked you
to touch the wooden sword.

1119
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:25,692
It's because one of you is greedy.

1120
01:19:25,692 --> 01:19:27,692
That's why they are poisoned.

1121
01:19:27,692 --> 01:19:28,650
Bring me the antidote.

1122
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:32,567
Master Chang, are you begging me
or forcing me?

1123
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:35,567
Where are the "Jinxs"?

1124
01:19:36,192 --> 01:19:37,483
Ask them out.

1125
01:19:37,483 --> 01:19:39,483
Are you scared about them?

1126
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:43,067
I won't tell where they are
so you will be scared.

1127
01:19:44,483 --> 01:19:46,942
Don't think that I won't beat you
because you are woman.

1128
01:19:46,942 --> 01:19:50,733
I know, so, I decided to...

1129
01:19:50,733 --> 01:19:51,733
attack first.

1130
01:20:24,775 --> 01:20:28,525
Master Chang,
why don't you play a song with me?

1131
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:44,608
Stop playing.

1132
01:20:44,608 --> 01:20:45,733
I am loving it!

1133
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:02,525
Master Chang, do you want to
see my leg? Just tell me.

1134
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:03,900
Why do you take my shoes?

1135
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,692
You are so cunning,
how can you claim yourself heroic?

1136
01:21:06,692 --> 01:21:08,650
I am hot hero at all!

1137
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:11,775
I am cunning woman.

1138
01:21:11,775 --> 01:21:13,817
Have you heard that? Woman is cunning.

1139
01:21:13,817 --> 01:21:15,150
I won't argue with you.

1140
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,275
If you don't give me antidote,
I will burn your Green Willow Villa.

1141
01:21:18,275 --> 01:21:22,275
I won't give in a damn

1142
01:21:22,275 --> 01:21:26,942
but your fellows
are seriously poisoned.

1143
01:21:26,942 --> 01:21:28,942
If they can't get the antidote
with 4 hours,

1144
01:21:28,942 --> 01:21:31,942
they can never re-gain their kung-fu.

1145
01:21:31,942 --> 01:21:34,942
Time is running short.

1146
01:21:35,317 --> 01:21:36,192
Jinx's Palm.

1147
01:21:47,358 --> 01:21:48,733
This is not "Jinx's Palm".

1148
01:21:48,733 --> 01:21:52,483
No, I don't know it.
Ijust wan t to scarify you.

1149
01:21:54,358 --> 01:21:56,733
If I didn't take back half energy,

1150
01:21:56,733 --> 01:21:58,817
you would have been killed.

1151
01:21:58,817 --> 01:22:00,608
You don't wish to kill me.

1152
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:02,567
You like me.

1153
01:22:02,567 --> 01:22:03,442
Bull shit.

1154
01:22:07,483 --> 01:22:10,733
You love your maid more?
Or love me more?

1155
01:22:10,733 --> 01:22:12,608
If you don't take the antidote out,
I will kill you.

1156
01:22:13,233 --> 01:22:14,608
Go ahead.

1157
01:22:14,608 --> 01:22:17,733
Answer me,
or I won't give you antidote.

1158
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:18,567
You...

1159
01:22:20,483 --> 01:22:22,233
I know you love the maid more.

1160
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:26,025
I have made No-mercy going there.

1161
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:27,733
How cunning are you!

1162
01:22:28,525 --> 01:22:29,650
Go,

1163
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:33,733
if you go like this, your fellows' kung-fu
can never be re-gained.

1164
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,150
It seems that I have no choice.

1165
01:22:48,275 --> 01:22:49,358
Give me or not?

1166
01:22:49,358 --> 01:22:50,233
<i>No.</i>

1167
01:22:50,483 --> 01:22:51,900
Give me or not?

1168
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:52,983
No matter how, no!

1169
01:23:00,233 --> 01:23:01,275
Aren't you scared of me?

1170
01:23:01,275 --> 01:23:04,692
I will be your woman sooner or later.
I don't need to resist.

1171
01:23:04,692 --> 01:23:07,567
Anyway, no one will help me.

1172
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:09,400
You can do whatever you want.

1173
01:23:10,192 --> 01:23:11,442
Shameless.

1174
01:23:12,692 --> 01:23:13,567
Chang Mo-kei,

1175
01:23:15,442 --> 01:23:16,942
I can give you antidote

1176
01:23:16,942 --> 01:23:21,192
and the "Black Jade Paster".

1177
01:23:21,192 --> 01:23:22,067
But,

1178
01:23:23,067 --> 01:23:24,567
you've to promise me three things.

1179
01:23:33,192 --> 01:23:35,192
Master, where are
those people of Ming Sect?

1180
01:23:35,192 --> 01:23:37,067
They seem to be disappeared.

1181
01:23:37,067 --> 01:23:38,442
Master, look!

1182
01:23:43,317 --> 01:23:45,317
No-mercy again.

1183
01:23:45,317 --> 01:23:47,483
Siu Chiu, leave us.

1184
01:23:47,483 --> 01:23:50,067
No, Master asked me to stay here.

1185
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:52,358
No matter how, I have to delay.

1186
01:23:52,358 --> 01:23:54,317
You bastards,
what evil deeds are you planning?

1187
01:23:55,567 --> 01:23:58,067
Master, they seem to be poisoned.

1188
01:23:58,067 --> 01:24:00,942
Damn you! If you dare to come over,
I will suck all your blood!

1189
01:24:04,942 --> 01:24:06,608
What are you looking at?

1190
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:09,067
I have too much blood,
it's alright to split some out.

1191
01:24:09,067 --> 01:24:11,733
I have let you go once.

1192
01:24:11,733 --> 01:24:15,817
Now, I have a chance to kill the evils
for the world of martial arts.

1193
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:18,608
Master, it's not heroic
to take such advantage.

1194
01:24:18,608 --> 01:24:20,317
Bitch, get lost!

1195
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:22,733
Bitch, if you can resist
3 stances from me,

1196
01:24:22,733 --> 01:24:24,192
I will let you kill.

1197
01:24:25,483 --> 01:24:26,858
How dare you.

1198
01:24:27,108 --> 01:24:29,025
Or, I will take three stances from you.
If you defeat me,

1199
01:24:29,025 --> 01:24:30,275
then I'll let you do
whatever you want.

1200
01:24:30,275 --> 01:24:31,775
What a sharp tongue.

1201
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:34,775
If you can resist three of my stances,
I will let you go.

1202
01:24:34,775 --> 01:24:35,483
Come on.

1203
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,650
Siu Chiu...

1204
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:40,525
- How are you?
- Are you alright?

1205
01:24:41,858 --> 01:24:43,025
I can stand it.

1206
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,150
Two more.

1207
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:54,775
Master, she is seriously injured,
why not let me to kill her?

1208
01:24:54,775 --> 01:24:56,900
I should not take my words back.

1209
01:24:58,525 --> 01:24:59,400
I dare not.

1210
01:25:21,275 --> 01:25:23,900
Siu Chiu,just leave us.

1211
01:25:27,775 --> 01:25:28,692
One more.

1212
01:25:28,692 --> 01:25:30,942
You are looking for death,
I can't help you.

1213
01:25:40,442 --> 01:25:42,067
- Master.
- Master.

1214
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:49,525
- Siu Chiu.
- Mister.

1215
01:25:50,942 --> 01:25:51,817
Go.

1216
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:57,692
- King of Bat, take the antidote to them.
- Yes.

1217
01:25:57,692 --> 01:25:59,942
Mo-kei, why did Chao Min
give you antidote?

1218
01:25:59,942 --> 01:26:00,983
Be careful of tricks.

1219
01:26:00,983 --> 01:26:03,233
I wanted her to eat three
in front of me. It should be real.

1220
01:26:06,108 --> 01:26:08,358
Siu Chiu.

1221
01:26:09,983 --> 01:26:10,817
Mister.

1222
01:26:10,817 --> 01:26:12,358
What a couple.

1223
01:26:14,442 --> 01:26:16,483
Bitch, how dare you come?

1224
01:26:16,483 --> 01:26:17,483
Why not?

1225
01:26:17,483 --> 01:26:19,858
Your master promised me
to do three things for me.

1226
01:26:19,858 --> 01:26:20,858
That's why I gave him
the antidote to save your lives.

1227
01:26:21,483 --> 01:26:22,317
Mister.

1228
01:26:23,483 --> 01:26:25,483
I just promised to do three things
which are not against conscience.

1229
01:26:25,483 --> 01:26:26,608
Not against heroism.

1230
01:26:26,608 --> 01:26:29,858
I won't let you marry
such pretty girl, Siu Chiu.

1231
01:26:31,608 --> 01:26:34,108
Isn't it against conscience?

1232
01:26:35,108 --> 01:26:37,275
Master Chang, not that easy.

1233
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,983
When I have something in mind,
I will look for you.

1234
01:26:43,108 --> 01:26:46,150
I have never met such cunning woman!

1235
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:49,983
This woman must
be great foe of our Ming Sect.

1236
01:26:49,983 --> 01:26:53,233
There must be some story behind
the raid against Wu-tong by Shaolin.

1237
01:26:53,233 --> 01:26:55,400
We have to go to Shaolin Temple now.
To get the truth.

1238
01:26:59,733 --> 01:27:02,400
- Master.
- Master, are you alright?

1239
01:27:12,233 --> 01:27:16,192
Mastress No-mercy, King Yu-yang
wants you to be his guest.

1240
01:27:16,192 --> 01:27:17,025
After you.

1241
01:27:20,692 --> 01:27:23,192
Shaolin Temple

1242
01:27:23,567 --> 01:27:25,900
Why is so quiet?

1243
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:31,567
Master Chang Mo-kei, together with
King of White Eagle and King of Green Bat

1244
01:27:31,567 --> 01:27:33,192
wants to meet your master.

1245
01:27:40,025 --> 01:27:43,150
Our master has his order,
he doesn't want to see anyone.

1246
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:47,317
We come a long way to here.
We want to see him now, it's urgent.

1247
01:27:47,317 --> 01:27:48,567
Please tell your master.

1248
01:27:49,192 --> 01:27:51,067
He doesn't want to see you.

1249
01:27:51,067 --> 01:27:52,692
Go back.

1250
01:27:52,692 --> 01:27:55,942
Wait. From your movement,

1251
01:27:55,942 --> 01:27:57,358
It doesn't seem to
be the kung-fu of Shaolin.

1252
01:27:57,358 --> 01:27:59,983
You just have your head shaved,
and scratched.

1253
01:27:59,983 --> 01:28:03,192
You are not a real monk.

1254
01:28:04,858 --> 01:28:06,067
I said he is fake.

1255
01:28:07,608 --> 01:28:09,192
Master, let's get in
and check it out.

1256
01:28:09,192 --> 01:28:09,817
Okay.

1257
01:28:18,608 --> 01:28:19,817
Mister, look!

1258
01:28:20,608 --> 01:28:23,233
Kill Shaolin first, then Wu-tong

1259
01:28:23,233 --> 01:28:24,983
We, Ming Sect is the supreme
of the world of martial arts

1260
01:28:24,983 --> 01:28:27,233
It's a trap.

1261
01:28:27,233 --> 01:28:29,692
Are all the kung-fu masters
of Shaolin killed?

1262
01:28:29,692 --> 01:28:32,483
They maybe poisoned by "Scent".

1263
01:28:32,483 --> 01:28:36,067
I think most of them may be nabbed.

1264
01:28:36,067 --> 01:28:37,692
- Shit.
- What's the matter?

1265
01:28:37,692 --> 01:28:39,525
Kill Shaolin, then Wu-tong.

1266
01:28:39,525 --> 01:28:41,108
They must have gone to Wu-tong.

1267
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:42,650
- Let's hurry there.
- Yes.

1268
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:43,775
Do you want to leave? Not that easy.

1269
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:49,900
Master, you'd better leave first.

1270
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,483
Master, what's the matter?

1271
01:28:55,483 --> 01:28:57,650
Hung-shang from Shaolin
wants to meet Master Chang.

1272
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:58,483
Follow me.

1273
01:29:04,525 --> 01:29:07,150
Master, Shaolin has
had the greatest disaster.

1274
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:09,858
We were raided by the Evil Sect,
other than me. No one is alive.

1275
01:29:09,858 --> 01:29:10,900
Really?

1276
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:12,400
The kung-fu masters who launched a raid
to the Bright Summit

1277
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,608
were all arrested by the Evil Sect.

1278
01:29:13,608 --> 01:29:14,650
Master Chang,
if you don't do something,

1279
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:16,233
the whole world of martial arts
will be under the control of Evil Sect.

1280
01:29:16,233 --> 01:29:17,150
Get up first.

1281
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:20,317
Watch out, Master.

1282
01:29:28,025 --> 01:29:30,317
This monk is fake,
he is from the Evil Sect.

1283
01:29:30,317 --> 01:29:31,650
Where is your dad and uncles?

1284
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:32,567
Master.

1285
01:29:33,942 --> 01:29:35,567
Mo-kei didn't die,

1286
01:29:35,567 --> 01:29:38,192
he joined the Evil Sect
and learnt lots of Evil Magic.

1287
01:29:38,192 --> 01:29:42,442
My dad and four uncles
were not prepared.

1288
01:29:43,067 --> 01:29:45,567
Five of them...

1289
01:29:46,442 --> 01:29:47,775
Ching-su, what's happened?

1290
01:29:54,025 --> 01:29:54,942
Master.

1291
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:58,817
Ching-su, how dare
you assassinate me?

1292
01:30:02,067 --> 01:30:05,608
Even a scapegoat couldn't cheat you.

1293
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:08,983
Master, you should be
the man of the world.

1294
01:30:08,983 --> 01:30:12,233
You are great in kung-fu,
it's not wise to be a taste here.

1295
01:30:12,942 --> 01:30:16,317
Why not follow me to work
for the government

1296
01:30:16,317 --> 01:30:18,692
to enjoy prosperous life together.

1297
01:30:18,692 --> 01:30:19,358
You...

1298
01:30:38,358 --> 01:30:41,733
Chang San-fung, do you remember us?

1299
01:30:41,733 --> 01:30:44,025
I see, the troubles
in all these years

1300
01:30:44,025 --> 01:30:46,025
were designed by the government.

1301
01:30:46,025 --> 01:30:48,150
Right, you are right.

1302
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:52,608
Our Majesty wants to make you
the Pope of our government.

1303
01:30:52,608 --> 01:30:54,275
If you are willing to work for us,

1304
01:30:54,275 --> 01:30:56,608
your school will
enjoy prosperity together.

1305
01:30:56,608 --> 01:30:59,608
Your students will be the generals.

1306
01:30:59,608 --> 01:31:02,150
To settle the riots for my government.

1307
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:05,150
I Chang San-fung,
do whatever I think its right,

1308
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:06,733
but I'll never be a tribal betrayer.

1309
01:31:06,733 --> 01:31:07,900
Chang,

1310
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:11,025
you don't work for us, what you
have to do is only to go to hell.

1311
01:31:13,358 --> 01:31:15,650
Don't panic,
I just want to scratch my back.

1312
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:36,317
Chang, how much blood do you have?

1313
01:31:36,317 --> 01:31:37,400
Protect Master.

1314
01:31:46,442 --> 01:31:48,150
Don't, let me handle this.

1315
01:31:54,067 --> 01:31:55,317
Magic Stance.

1316
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,650
Master.

1317
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:06,483
Master, are you alright?

1318
01:32:06,483 --> 01:32:08,233
- Mo-kei.
- How are you?

1319
01:32:09,233 --> 01:32:10,942
Ching-su,
that bastard assassinated me.

1320
01:32:48,483 --> 01:32:51,858
Why are you so powerful?

1321
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:55,150
You asked me to keep my virtue.
I haven't used that.

1322
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:56,150
Cut the crap.

1323
01:33:14,025 --> 01:33:14,900
Your Highness.

1324
01:33:19,775 --> 01:33:22,733
How can you be that impolite
to Master Chang?

1325
01:33:22,733 --> 01:33:25,483
How are you, Master Chang?
I am Chao Min.

1326
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:29,525
Your Highness.

1327
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:33,817
Master Chang, don't be tough.

1328
01:33:33,817 --> 01:33:36,942
Do you want your students
to be killed?

1329
01:33:36,942 --> 01:33:39,442
Men must die once.

1330
01:33:39,442 --> 01:33:42,025
But we should die meaningfully.

1331
01:33:42,025 --> 01:33:44,400
Master, don't panic, I am here.

1332
01:33:46,067 --> 01:33:51,067
Master Chang, do you remember...
you've promised to do three things for me?

1333
01:33:51,525 --> 01:33:52,525
Will you keep your promise?

1334
01:33:52,525 --> 01:33:56,817
If only they are not against conscience
and not heroic. I'll help.

1335
01:33:56,817 --> 01:34:00,692
First, you can't use
the "Great Solar Stance".

1336
01:34:00,692 --> 01:34:02,692
Just tie himself up, alright?

1337
01:34:04,442 --> 01:34:08,942
What a sharp tongue,
I'll seal your mouth sooner or later.

1338
01:34:10,817 --> 01:34:13,942
Second, don't use
your "Magic Stance".

1339
01:34:14,233 --> 01:34:17,192
Alright, I promise.

1340
01:34:17,192 --> 01:34:19,692
- What kind of kung-fu will you use?
- Master, teach me any.

1341
01:34:20,442 --> 01:34:22,233
Why not the kung-fu of Wu-tong?

1342
01:34:22,233 --> 01:34:23,733
- Isn't it alright?
- It's alright.

1343
01:34:23,733 --> 01:34:24,733
Master, come on.

1344
01:34:47,608 --> 01:34:51,983
Tai-chi, grows from nothing.

1345
01:34:52,317 --> 01:34:54,275
Master, you start that so late.

1346
01:34:54,275 --> 01:34:56,108
I couldn't stand. Quick.

1347
01:34:57,025 --> 01:34:58,525
Mo-kei, now I teach you

1348
01:34:58,525 --> 01:35:03,858
my self-developed tactics
since 100-year-old Tai-chi Fist

1349
01:35:07,233 --> 01:35:10,650
It's the origin of motion.
The origin of everything.

1350
01:35:10,650 --> 01:35:13,483
Positive and negative is connected.
Can't be separated.

1351
01:35:13,483 --> 01:35:16,983
Two elements help each other.
They are against each other.

1352
01:35:16,983 --> 01:35:20,650
Keep calm.
Mind your respiration.

1353
01:35:20,650 --> 01:35:24,150
Concentrate your mind.
Pay full attention.

1354
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:27,900
Turn soft to hard.
Use both soft and hard.

1355
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:31,650
In Tai-chi,
there is soft and hard.

1356
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:35,567
Use both soft and hard.
Generate the force as you wish.

1357
01:35:49,192 --> 01:35:52,317
Mo-kei, you're protected
by the "Great Solar Stance",

1358
01:35:52,317 --> 01:35:54,525
you can learn
all kinds of kung-fu quickly.

1359
01:35:54,525 --> 01:35:57,692
Tai-chi, just remember
it's meaning, not the stance.

1360
01:35:57,692 --> 01:36:01,817
Forget all your stance.
Thus you can make it.

1361
01:36:14,275 --> 01:36:14,942
Can you remember?

1362
01:36:16,150 --> 01:36:17,483
I've forgotten.

1363
01:36:17,483 --> 01:36:19,442
- What is the name of these stances?
- Forgot.

1364
01:36:19,442 --> 01:36:21,108
- What's the surname of your dad?
- Forgot.

1365
01:36:21,108 --> 01:36:24,608
Okay, just remember one thing -
To beat them with no mercy.

1366
01:37:59,025 --> 01:38:00,692
Congratulations,
you have such a good student.

1367
01:38:01,442 --> 01:38:03,067
You have a good grandson too.

1368
01:38:04,150 --> 01:38:06,692
I will let you go now.

1369
01:38:08,192 --> 01:38:12,150
Chang Mo-kei,
I won't let you repay me that easily.

1370
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:14,650
The lives of the six schools
are controlled by me.

1371
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:17,900
If I don't go back within three days,
they will all be killed.

1372
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:20,275
What do you want?

1373
01:38:20,275 --> 01:38:22,983
Today, you are lucky. Let's go.

1374
01:38:23,733 --> 01:38:25,692
Not that easy. Don't go.

1375
01:38:26,358 --> 01:38:28,608
Okay, I won't go.

1376
01:38:28,608 --> 01:38:30,483
I will stay here for more days.

1377
01:38:31,483 --> 01:38:33,233
You'd better prepare
the funerals for your friends.

1378
01:38:33,692 --> 01:38:35,692
You may go
but not Ching-su.

1379
01:38:36,108 --> 01:38:38,233
Your Highness, don't leave me.

1380
01:38:39,483 --> 01:38:43,317
Such heartless dog,

1381
01:38:43,317 --> 01:38:46,108
it's useless for me to keep.

1382
01:38:46,108 --> 01:38:47,608
Take it if you like.

1383
01:38:51,108 --> 01:38:54,067
Master, I deserved to be killed,
I am useless.

1384
01:38:54,067 --> 01:38:57,483
Master,just let me go.

1385
01:38:57,483 --> 01:38:58,858
How can you face your dad?

1386
01:39:00,108 --> 01:39:01,733
Mo-kei...

1387
01:39:02,233 --> 01:39:05,483
Since we grow up together,
please beg Master to let me go, please.

1388
01:39:05,483 --> 01:39:06,358
Mo-kei.

1389
01:39:06,358 --> 01:39:08,150
Uncle Sung has one son only.

1390
01:39:08,775 --> 01:39:11,525
If I kill you,
he will have no descendant.

1391
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:13,775
Alright.

1392
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:20,150
Master, I have terminated
all his kung-fu.

1393
01:39:20,150 --> 01:39:21,275
Please let him stay alive.

1394
01:39:22,275 --> 01:39:22,983
Alright.

1395
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:26,275
Master, thank you.
Thank you.

1396
01:39:29,525 --> 01:39:30,525
Chang Mo-kei,

1397
01:39:31,483 --> 01:39:32,775
you still have to do
one more thing for me.

1398
01:39:32,775 --> 01:39:35,983
If you want to save the six schools,
come to capital to look for me.

1399
01:39:36,305 --> 01:40:36,879
