00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:52,970
<i>Long ago,
the world was full of wonder.</i>

3
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,045
<i>It was adventurous...</i>

4
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:04,048
<i>exciting...</i>

5
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:08,318
<i>and best of all...</i>

6
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:10,453
<i>there was magic.</i>

7
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:13,791
<i>Boombastia!</i>

8
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,836
<i>And that magic
helped all in need.</i>

9
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:28,438
<i>Flame Infernar!</i>

10
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:39,851
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

11
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:57,699
<i>But it wasn't
easy to master.</i>

12
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,668
<i>And so the world found
a simpler way to get by.</i>

13
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,573
I call it the light bulb.

14
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,382
'Tis so easy.

15
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:14,049
Huh.

16
00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:18,688
<i>Over time...</i>

17
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,525
<i>...magic faded away.</i>

18
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,479
<i>But I hope...</i>

19
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,153
<i>...there's a little
magic left...</i>

20
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,721
<i>in you.</i>

21
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,776
<i>All right.</i>

22
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,743
<i>We're gonna get
Warrior Z90 fit.</i>

23
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:18,013
<i>Let me hear you say,
"I'm a mighty warrior."</i>

24
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:19,248
I'm a mighty warrior.

25
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,816
Morning, Mom.

26
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,520
Oh! Blazey, down!

27
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:28,059
Bad dragon!
Back to your lair.

28
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,894
Happy birthday,
Mr. Adult Man.

29
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:33,028
No, Mom.

30
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,900
Hey, buddy. Don't wipe off
my kisses.

31
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:37,299
What?

32
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,435
You're wearing
your dad's sweatshirt.

33
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:41,703
Oh. You know.
Finally fits.

34
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:44,139
Aw, my little chubby cheeks
is all grown up!

35
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,376
Okay, okay. Mom, I gotta eat
something before school.

36
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:48,777
Ah, we don't have
much food.

37
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:50,446
I still have to go
to the grocery store.

38
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:51,814
Ah, hands off, mister.

39
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,449
Those are
for your party tonight.

40
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:55,683
It's not a party, Mom.
It's just us.

41
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:57,753
You could invite those kids
from your science class.

42
00:03:57,755 --> 00:03:59,888
You said they seem
pretty rockin'.

43
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,291
I'm, uh, pretty sure
I didn't say it like that.

44
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:03,959
And besides,
I don't even know them.

45
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:06,395
Well, your birthday's a day
to try new things.

46
00:04:06,397 --> 00:04:07,963
Be the new you.

47
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:09,564
Speaking of
trying new things,

48
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:11,333
did you sign up
for driving practice?

49
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,868
No!
No.

50
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,603
I know you're a little scared to
drive, sweetie pie, but...

51
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:18,240
I'm not scared, Mom.
I'm gonna move Barley's game.

52
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,541
Okay, but you know
how he gets when someone

53
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,944
touches that board.

54
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:24,480
Well, he's gotta learn
how to clean up his toys.

55
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:25,680
Halt!

56
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,686
Doth my brother dare disrupt
an active campaign?

57
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,387
Oh, come on!

58
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:32,520
You know, Ian,

59
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,721
in the days of old,
a boy of 16

60
00:04:33,723 --> 00:04:35,190
would have
his strength tested

61
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,624
in the Swamps of Despair.

62
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:38,626
I'm not testing anything.
Just let me go.

63
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:39,694
Let him go.

64
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,796
Okay.

65
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:41,930
But I know you're
stronger than that.

66
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:43,731
There's a mighty warrior
inside of you.

67
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,167
You just have to
let him out.

68
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:46,601
Right, Mom?

69
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:47,870
Oh, that's good.

70
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:49,838
Barley! You stink!

71
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,140
When was the last time
you showered?

72
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:52,875
If you tried a little
harder, you actually could

73
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:54,943
probably wiggle out of this.

74
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:58,380
See? Mom knows how
to let out her inner warrior.

75
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,515
Thank you.

76
00:04:59,517 --> 00:05:00,751
Now, take out
the trash.

77
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,553
<i>Stay on the
lookout for a runaway griffin.</i>

78
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,688
Ah, Officer Bronco.

79
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,025
Barley, Barley, Barley.

80
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:11,827
Every time the city tries
to tear down

81
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,162
an old piece of rubble,

82
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:15,831
I gotta drag my rear end
out here and deal with you.

83
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,100
I don't know
what you're talking about.

84
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,535
Oh, really?

85
00:05:19,537 --> 00:05:22,071
<i>I will not let you
tear down this fountain.</i>

86
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:24,739
<i>Ancient warriors
on grand quests</i>

87
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,741
<i>drank from its
flowing water.</i>

88
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,944
Barley.

89
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,813
They're destroying
the town's past.

90
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,314
Ugh. Well,
come on in.

91
00:05:32,316 --> 00:05:33,714
Rest your haunches
for a minute.

92
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:35,019
Thank you, hon.

93
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,921
Ugh.

94
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:39,988
Hey there,
birthday boy.

95
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,125
So, ya workin' hard
or hardly workin'?

96
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:45,494
I'm just, you know,
making toast.

97
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:46,727
I'm serious, Barley,

98
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,530
you need to start thinking
less about the past

99
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:50,399
and more about
your future.

100
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:51,936
Ah, she's right.

101
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:55,940
You can't spend all day
playing your board game.

102
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,109
<i>Quests of Yore</i>
isn't just a board game.

103
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:03,512
It's a historically-based
role-playing scenario.

104
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:04,745
Did you know,
in the old days,

105
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:07,682
centaurs could run
70 miles an hour?

106
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:09,485
I own a vehicle.
Don't need to run.

107
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:10,953
Well, Ian,
you could definitely

108
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,488
learn a lot
from <i>Quests of Yore.</i>

109
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,889
- You wanna play?
- I don't.

110
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:15,457
You could be
a crafty rogue or...

111
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,693
Ooh! I know!
You can be a wizard.

112
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:20,596
I shall cast a spell
on thee!

113
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:21,964
Hey! Careful of
Dad's sweatshirt!

114
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,299
I don't even remember Dad
wearing that sweatshirt.

115
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,302
Well, you do only have,
like, two memories of him.

116
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,170
No, I've got three.

117
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:29,905
I remember
his beard was scratchy,

118
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:31,639
he had a goofy laugh,
and I used to play

119
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,308
- drums on his feet.
- Drums on his feet. Right.

120
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,443
I used to go...

121
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:38,149
- Whoa!
- Five-second rule. Hah!

122
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:40,681
It's okay.
You just got to pull it.

123
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:41,919
No!

124
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:43,220
Barley!

125
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:45,320
Uh, you know...

126
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,556
I'm just gonna get some
food on the way to school.

127
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:49,391
I'll sew that
later tonight, okay?

128
00:06:49,393 --> 00:06:50,592
Wait, wait, wait.

129
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:53,562
By the laws of yore,
I must dub thee a man today.

130
00:06:53,564 --> 00:06:54,662
Kneel before me.

131
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,899
Oh! That's okay.
I gotta get going.

132
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:58,066
All right, well,
I'll pick you up later.

133
00:06:58,068 --> 00:06:59,334
We'll perform
the ceremony at school.

134
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,269
Oh! No, no, no, no.

135
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:02,106
Don't do that.
Don't do that. Okay, bye!

136
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:16,218
Hey!

137
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,286
Go Griffins!

138
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:18,153
What?

139
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:19,588
You go to
Willowdale College?

140
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,689
Oh, no.
This was my dad's.

141
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,393
Lightfoot?
Wilden Lightfoot?

142
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:25,460
Yeah.

143
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:27,229
You're kidding.
I went to college with him.

144
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,331
- Really?
- Yeah.

145
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:33,003
Boy, I was so sorry to hear
that he passed away.

146
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,103
Yeah. Thanks.

147
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:39,208
You know, your dad was
a great guy. So confident.

148
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,411
When he came into a room,
people noticed.

149
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:46,081
The man wore the ugliest
purple socks every single day.

150
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,082
What? Why?

151
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:49,184
Hey, that's exactly
what we asked.

152
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:50,919
But he was just bold.

153
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:54,156
I always wished I had
a little bit of that in me.

154
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:58,994
Yeah. Wow. I've never heard
any of this about him before.

155
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:01,029
- What else do you remember?
- Dad!

156
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:03,699
Oh, sorry. Gotta get
this guy off to school.

157
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:05,767
Hey, it was nice
meeting you.

158
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,938
Yeah. You, too.

159
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:10,474
Huh.

160
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,077
Bold.

161
00:08:57,521 --> 00:09:00,024
Okay, class.
Sit down. We're starting roll.

162
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:09,164
Hey, uh, Gorgamon. Um...

163
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,167
Would you mind not putting
your feet on my chair today?

164
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:13,068
Sorry, dude.

165
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,303
Got to keep
them elevated.

166
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:16,038
Gets the blood flowing
to my brain.

167
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,174
It just makes it a little
hard for me to fit in there.

168
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:20,742
Well, if I don't have
good blood flow,

169
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:22,779
I can't concentrate
on my schoolwork.

170
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:25,347
You don't want me to do bad
in school, do you?

171
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:27,017
Uh...

172
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:28,886
No.

173
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,487
Thanks, bro.

174
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:35,792
First road test.

175
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:37,027
Any volunteers?

176
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:42,232
A left here.

177
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,937
Now, take this on-ramp
for the freeway.

178
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:51,041
Okay, yeah. I'm, uh,
super ready for that.

179
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:55,946
Uh...

180
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:58,781
It's nice and fast.

181
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,948
Just merge into traffic.

182
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,516
Yep. Just any minute.

183
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,617
- Merge into traffic.
- Uh...

184
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:03,685
Merge into traffic!

185
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:06,388
I'm not ready!

186
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,389
Pull over.

187
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,830
All right. So, what should
we do this weekend?

188
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:15,030
Move to a cooler town?

189
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,331
Oh, hey.
What up, dudes? Um...

190
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,333
I'm, uh, having
a party tonight,

191
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:20,770
and I was wondering if
you wanted to come over

192
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:23,004
and get down
on some cake.

193
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:25,107
That's not
something anyone says.

194
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:27,311
Okay, don't say "dudes."
"Gang"?

195
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:30,479
What's up, gang?

196
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:32,447
What's up, gang?

197
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:38,086
Hey.
What's up, gang?

198
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:40,689
Oh, hey.
Uh, Ian, right?

199
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:43,425
Oh! I didn't know
you knew my...

200
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:44,993
Anyway...

201
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:47,028
uh, if you like parties,
then I'm...

202
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,463
I was gonna
do a party...

203
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:49,998
- What?
- What I was trying to say is

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,400
if you're not doing
anything tonight...

205
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:53,735
but I'm sure you probably
are doing something tonight...

206
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,670
and you like cake
like I like cake,

207
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:58,206
I've got a cake
at my house.

208
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,575
Are you inviting us
to a party?

209
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,543
That's the one.

210
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:03,578
Oh. Yeah,
we don't have any plans.

211
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,646
- Yeah, okay.
- Totally.

212
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:05,947
Really?

213
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:07,716
I guess we can just take
the bus over to my house.

214
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,154
Oh, no, no, no.

215
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:15,592
Ha-ha! Is that
the birthday boy I see?

216
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,197
Behold!
Your chariot awaits!

217
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:23,698
Do you know that guy?

218
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,368
- Uh...
- Sir Iandore of Lightfoot.

219
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,570
Seems like he's
talking to you.

220
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:29,671
Hey, Ian!

221
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,074
Hey, Barley.

222
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:35,010
Yeah, we were actually
gonna take the bus.

223
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:36,913
The bus? Nay!

224
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:38,781
I will give you
and your companions

225
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:40,982
transport upon Guinevere.

226
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,785
Um, who's Guinevere?

227
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,953
My mighty steed.

228
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,222
Oh. That's embarrassing.

229
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:49,224
That's okay, girl.
Patch you back up.

230
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:52,060
He's just joking around.

231
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:54,498
You've got
something on your face.

232
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:59,102
Oh, no. You... just...
Wait, no. It's... No...

233
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,069
Oh! Uh...

234
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:02,170
You know what?
I just remembered

235
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:03,806
that my birthday
is, uh, canceled.

236
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,207
- What?
- I mean, the party.

237
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:06,809
Uh, it was never
actually happening.

238
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,510
It was just this
huge misunderstanding.

239
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:09,678
So, I got to go.

240
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,048
Okay. Bye!

241
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:21,824
Ooh. Whoops! Sorry.
Let me just file those.

242
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:24,927
Hey, did those kids
write on your face?

243
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:26,428
Here. I'll get it.

244
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,730
Can we please
just go home?

245
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:31,700
Okay, well, we'll perform
your birthday ceremony later.

246
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:33,034
Then you'll be ready
for adulthood

247
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:34,736
and its gauntlet
of challenges.

248
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:35,872
You know,
in ancient times,

249
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:37,038
you celebrated
your day of birth

250
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,507
with a solemn quest.

251
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,076
Of course, those were nothing
compared to the challenges

252
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:42,613
of the old days.

253
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:48,018
Mom?

254
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:50,187
Mom?

255
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:37,399
<i>Will, you're not gonna
get that thing working.</i>

256
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,567
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

257
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,135
<i>I'm gonna watch
from over here</i>

258
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:42,237
<i>for when it blows up.</i>

259
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,572
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

260
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,273
<i>I'll bet good money
you can't get it to work.</i>

261
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:46,541
<i>Oh, is that right?</i>

262
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:47,409
<i>Yep.</i>

263
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:48,610
<i>But you're
doing a good job of</i>

264
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:50,245
<i>making it look like
you know what you're doing.</i>

265
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,014
<i>Well, I'm trying to.</i>

266
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,849
<i>Did you check
if it had batteries?</i>

267
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:56,184
<i>Of course you didn't.</i>

268
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:57,252
<i>I know.</i>

269
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,386
<i>So, is it really working?</i>

270
00:13:58,388 --> 00:13:59,623
<i>Let's find out.</i>

271
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:02,157
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

272
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:09,364
<i>Will, you're not going
to get that thing working.</i>

273
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:10,498
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

274
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,233
<i>I'm gonna watch
from over here</i>

275
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:13,970
<i>for when it blows up.</i>

276
00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:15,170
Hi, Dad.

277
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:16,872
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

278
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:17,940
It's me, Ian.

279
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,008
<i>Oh, is that right?</i>

280
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,276
Yeah. Did you
have a good day?

281
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,979
<i>Well, I'm trying to.</i>

282
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:24,579
Yeah. Me, too.

283
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:27,148
Although, I could clearly use some help.

284
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:32,153
I sure do wish I could spend
the day with you sometime.

285
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:33,388
<i>I know.</i>

286
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,123
Well, there are so many
things we could do.

287
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,993
I bet it'd be really fun.

288
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:38,159
<i>Let's find out.</i>

289
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:40,261
Yeah. I mean, I'd love to.
We could, uh...

290
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:42,733
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

291
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:45,837
Yeah.

292
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:47,537
Bye.

293
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:55,143
Oh, my...

294
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,880
Barley, keep your soldiers
off my land

295
00:14:57,882 --> 00:14:59,347
or our kingdoms
will go to war!

296
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,249
Sorry, Mom!

297
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:04,185
Oh, this is the world's
longest gap year.

298
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:06,187
Honey, I was
gonna do that.

299
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:07,622
It's okay.

300
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:10,392
Wow! You must have been taught
by some kind of sewing master.

301
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:13,765
Yeah. A very humble sewing master.

302
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,637
What was Dad like
when he was my age?

303
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,807
Was he always
super confident?

304
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:25,841
Oh, no.

305
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,913
It took him a while
to find out who he was.

306
00:15:30,114 --> 00:15:31,783
I wish I'd met him.

307
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:34,549
Oh, me, too.

308
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:38,821
But, hey, you know,
when your dad got sick,

309
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:40,188
he fought so hard

310
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,260
because he wanted to meet you
more than anything.

311
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:50,534
You know what?
I have something for you.

312
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:54,536
I was gonna wait
until after cake,

313
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,939
but I think you've waited
long enough.

314
00:15:56,941 --> 00:15:58,074
What is it?

315
00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:01,344
It's a gift
from your dad.

316
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:08,216
What do you mean,
it's from Dad?

317
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,719
I don't know. Mom said
it was for both of us.

318
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:11,954
What is it?

319
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:16,626
He just said to give you this
when you were both over 16.

320
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:20,832
I have no idea
what it is.

321
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:29,304
No way!

322
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:30,840
It's a wizard staff.

323
00:16:30,842 --> 00:16:32,174
- Dad was a wizard.
- What?

324
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:34,476
Hold on, your dad
was an accountant.

325
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:36,979
I mean, he got interested
in a lot of strange things

326
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,180
when he got sick, but...

327
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:39,782
There's a letter.

328
00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:41,316
"Dear Ian and Barley,

329
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:43,618
"long ago, the world
was full of wonder.

330
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,021
"It was adventurous,
exciting,

331
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:47,823
"and best of all,
there was magic.

332
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:50,126
"And that magic
helped all in need.

333
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:51,659
"But it wasn't easy
to master.

334
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:54,429
"And so the world found
a simpler way to get by.

335
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,766
"Over time,
magic faded away,

336
00:16:56,768 --> 00:17:01,402
"but I hope there's
a little magic left in you.

337
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:04,574
"And so I wrote this spell,
so I could see for myself

338
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,611
"who my boys
grew up to be."

339
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:11,048
"Visitation Spell."

340
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,417
I don't believe this.

341
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:18,319
This spell
brings him back.

342
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:20,655
For one whole day,
Dad will be back.

343
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:22,390
- What?
- Back? Like back to life?

344
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:23,658
That's not possible.

345
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,227
It is with this!

346
00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:28,296
I'm gonna meet Dad?

347
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,366
Oh, Will, you wonderful nut.
What is this?

348
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:33,969
Now, a spell this powerful
needs an assist element.

349
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,871
And, I mean, for this to work,
Dad would've had to find

350
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:37,773
a Phoenix Gem!

351
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:39,008
Wow.

352
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,708
There's only
a few of these left.

353
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,978
Hold on!
Is this dangerous?

354
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,016
We're about to find out.

355
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:49,118
- Ah!
- What?

356
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,686
Splinter.

357
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:55,925
"Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

358
00:17:55,927 --> 00:18:00,630
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

359
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:07,702
Hold on. I was just
grippin' it wrong.

360
00:18:07,704 --> 00:18:10,605
"Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

361
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:14,644
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

362
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:16,544
"Only once is all we get,

363
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:18,080
"grant me this rebirth.

364
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:20,448
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

365
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,884
"One day
to walk the earth."

366
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:26,090
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

367
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:27,655
Barley.

368
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:38,666
I'm sorry you guys
don't have your dad here,

369
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:43,705
but this shows just how much
he wanted to see you both.

370
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,541
So much
that he'd try anything.

371
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,847
That's still
a pretty special gift.

372
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,746
Yeah.

373
00:18:57,621 --> 00:19:01,991
Hey, wanna come with me
to pick up your cake?

374
00:19:01,993 --> 00:19:04,494
That's okay.
Thanks, Mom.

375
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:37,494
"Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

376
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:44,936
"Till tomorrow's sun
has set...

377
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:54,444
"one day to
walk the earth."

378
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,316
Hey, man,
what are you doing in here?

379
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:02,384
Holy Tooth of Zadar!
How did you...?

380
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:03,788
I don't know.
It just started.

381
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:11,829
Whoa! Feet!

382
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:33,315
Hang on. I can help!

383
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:34,517
Barley, no!

384
00:20:58,242 --> 00:20:59,243
Dad?

385
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:03,914
He's just legs.

386
00:21:06,217 --> 00:21:07,216
There's no top part.

387
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:08,851
I definitely remember
Dad having a top part!

388
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:11,288
Oh, what did I do?
This is horrible.

389
00:21:13,224 --> 00:21:14,557
Uh...

390
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:21,999
Hello?

391
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:26,435
It's really him.

392
00:21:26,437 --> 00:21:29,171
Dad, you are
in your house.

393
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:30,174
Whoa, whoa!

394
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,577
He can't hear us.

395
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:43,018
What are you doing?

396
00:21:58,668 --> 00:22:02,807
That's right, Dad.
It's me, Barley.

397
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,151
Yeah, that's Ian.

398
00:22:14,518 --> 00:22:16,586
Hi, Dad.

399
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:27,296
I messed
this whole thing up.

400
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:28,797
Now he's gonna be
legs forever.

401
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,934
No, not forever.
The spell only lasts one day.

402
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,002
At sunset tomorrow,
he'll disappear,

403
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:36,073
and we'll never be able
to bring him back again.

404
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,008
Okay, okay, okay.
24 hours.

405
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,812
That doesn't give us
much time, but...

406
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:48,817
Well, we'll just have
to do the spell again.

407
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:50,219
You mean
you have to.

408
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:52,988
A person can only do magic
if they have the gift.

409
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,689
And my little brother
has the magic gift.

410
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:56,624
Okay! Okay.

411
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,227
But I couldn't even
finish the spell.

412
00:22:58,229 --> 00:23:00,562
Well, you're gonna have
plenty of time to practice.

413
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:02,833
'Cause we have to find
another Phoenix Gem.

414
00:23:07,338 --> 00:23:11,340
A-ha! We'll start at the place
where all quests begin.

415
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:13,375
The Manticore's Tavern.

416
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:15,244
It's run
by a fearless adventurer.

417
00:23:15,246 --> 00:23:16,778
She knows where to find
any kind of gem,

418
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,880
talisman, totem...

419
00:23:17,882 --> 00:23:19,680
Barley, this is for a game.

420
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:21,383
Based on real life.

421
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:22,650
How do we know
this tavern

422
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,986
- is still there?
- It's there.

423
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:25,854
Look, my years of training
have prepared me

424
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:27,189
for this very moment.

425
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:29,424
And I'm telling you,
this is the only way

426
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:32,229
to find a Phoenix Gem.

427
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:35,032
Trust me.

428
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:42,171
Whatever it takes,
I am gonna meet my dad.

429
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:45,376
You hear that, Dad?
We're going on a quest.

430
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:50,913
Come on, Guinevere.

431
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:53,482
Uh, maybe we should
just take the bus.

432
00:23:53,484 --> 00:23:55,819
She's fine.

433
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:19,007
Anyway,
it's just, like,

434
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:21,276
this award for math.
It's no big deal.

435
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:23,881
But I'll show you
when we get back home.

436
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:26,782
Hey, uh,
what are you two

437
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:28,050
Chatty Charlies up to
back there?

438
00:24:28,052 --> 00:24:30,319
You know, I felt weird
talking to Dad

439
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:32,489
without a top half, so...

440
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,091
ta-da!

441
00:24:34,825 --> 00:24:36,158
Oh, that's great!

442
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,493
Dad, you look
just like I remember.

443
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:39,561
Hey, don't worry,
we'll have

444
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:40,896
the rest of you here
before you know it.

445
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:42,464
And then,
first thing I'm gonna do,

446
00:24:42,466 --> 00:24:44,533
introduce you
to Guinevere.

447
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:46,702
Rebuilt this
old girl myself,

448
00:24:46,704 --> 00:24:48,904
from the lug nuts
to the air conditioning.

449
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:55,777
Showing Dad your van?

450
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:57,980
- That's your whole list?
- What list?

451
00:24:57,982 --> 00:24:59,181
- Oh.
- What's that?

452
00:24:59,183 --> 00:25:01,016
I'm just working
on a list of things

453
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:02,284
I wanted to do with Dad.

454
00:25:02,286 --> 00:25:03,151
You know,

455
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:06,121
play catch, take a walk,
driving lesson,

456
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:08,423
share my whole life story
with him.

457
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,625
That's cool.

458
00:25:09,627 --> 00:25:12,728
Oh. But before you cast Dad's
spell again, you're gonna

459
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,063
have to practice your magic.

460
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:17,199
This book is for a game.

461
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:19,701
I told you,
everything in <i>Quests of Yore</i>

462
00:25:19,703 --> 00:25:21,370
is historically
accurate.

463
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:22,738
Even the spells.

464
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,874
So start practicing,
young sorcerer.

465
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:30,247
Okay, Dad.
Let's try some magic.

466
00:25:34,585 --> 00:25:35,951
Hey, sweetie?

467
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:39,421
Ugh! Blazey. Oh, this dragon
is always under my feet.

468
00:25:39,423 --> 00:25:41,892
Honey, you want some cake?

469
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:22,864
<i>Aloft Elevar.
Aloft Elevar.</i>

470
00:26:22,866 --> 00:26:25,067
I can't get this
levitation spell to work.

471
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:26,935
Maybe I could try
something else

472
00:26:26,937 --> 00:26:28,704
like Arcane Lightning?

473
00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:30,372
Yeah, like a level-one mage
could bust out

474
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:32,074
the hardest spell in
the <i>Enchanter's Guide Book.</i>

475
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:33,742
Maybe we'll
stick with the easy ones.

476
00:26:33,744 --> 00:26:36,545
Yeah, well, it's not working.
Am I saying it wrong?

477
00:26:36,547 --> 00:26:38,680
Well, mmm,
you said it right.

478
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,082
It's just,
for any spell to work,

479
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:42,084
you have to speak
from your heart's fire.

480
00:26:42,086 --> 00:26:43,885
- My what?
- Your heart's fire.

481
00:26:43,887 --> 00:26:47,124
You must speak with passion.
Don't hold back.

482
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,124
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

483
00:26:49,126 --> 00:26:52,294
No, like <i>Aloft Elevar.</i>

484
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:53,261
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

485
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:55,664
No, from
your heart's fire!

486
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:58,033
- <i>Aloft Elevar!</i>
- Don't hold back.

487
00:26:58,035 --> 00:26:59,769
- <i>Aloft Elevar!</i>
- Heart's fire!

488
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:01,236
Stop saying
"heart's fire."

489
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:04,375
This just clearly
isn't working.

490
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,912
Hey, it was
a good start.

491
00:27:14,952 --> 00:27:18,653
Oh. Gather your courage, men.
We've arrived.

492
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:21,523
The Manticore's Tavern.

493
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:23,525
Huh. It is still here.

494
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:24,928
Yeah, I told you.

495
00:27:30,968 --> 00:27:34,204
Come on, Dad.
That's good.

496
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:38,073
All right, listen.
First, let me do the talking.

497
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:39,908
Secondly,
it's crucial we show

498
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,443
the Manticore
the respect she deserves,

499
00:27:41,445 --> 00:27:44,246
or she will, thirdly,
not give us a map to the Phoenix Gem.

500
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:45,882
Wait, wait, wait.
The map?

501
00:27:45,884 --> 00:27:47,449
I thought she had
a Phoenix Gem.

502
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:49,852
You're so cute.
Hear that, Dad?

503
00:27:49,854 --> 00:27:52,154
He's a smart kid,
he just doesn't know how quests work.

504
00:27:52,156 --> 00:27:55,157
Well, is there anything else
you're forgetting to tell me?

505
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:56,826
Mmm. No.

506
00:27:56,828 --> 00:27:57,959
<i>♪ Happy happy birthday</i>

507
00:27:57,961 --> 00:27:59,261
<i>♪ Come join us on a quest</i>

508
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,798
<i>♪ To make your birthday party

509
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,899
<i>♪ Hey!</i>

510
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:04,767
Okay, okay,
so the tavern

511
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:05,967
changed a little
over the years,

512
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:09,504
but the Manticore
is still the real deal.

513
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:12,441
I'll have the soup
of the day.

514
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:14,611
Would my lord like
a cup or cauldron?

515
00:28:18,248 --> 00:28:21,950
Madam, I request an
audience with the Manticore.

516
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,985
But of course, milord.

517
00:28:25,422 --> 00:28:27,522
Oh, Manticore!

518
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:34,196
No. No, no, no.
The real Manticore.

519
00:28:34,198 --> 00:28:36,431
The fearless adventurer.

520
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:38,569
Oh. You mean Corey?
She's over there.

521
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:41,336
Quick!
Somebody help me.

522
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:43,104
These griffin nuggets were
supposed to go out

523
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:45,474
minutes ago.

524
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:47,709
That's the Manticore?

525
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:49,978
Oh, great and powerful
Manticore.

526
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,047
Whoa! Sir, you're right
in the hot zone.

527
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:53,448
You're late, Adolphus.

528
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,419
I understand there's traffic.
You need to plan for that.

529
00:28:58,622 --> 00:29:01,757
Well, maybe your mother should
get her own car!

530
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,258
Your fearlessness?

531
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,828
My brother and I seek a map
to a Phoenix Gem.

532
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,097
Oh! Well, you've come to
the right tavern. Table 12.

533
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:13,301
I have the parchment you
desire right here. Behold!

534
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:15,771
Oh. That's
a children's menu.

535
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:18,740
Isn't that fun? They're all
based on my old maps.

536
00:29:18,742 --> 00:29:19,809
Uh, now...

537
00:29:19,811 --> 00:29:21,142
The great Manticore
sends you

538
00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:22,879
on your adventure
with a hero's blessing.

539
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:24,246
And here's some crayons.

540
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:26,949
That's very amusing,
your dominance,

541
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:28,951
but might you have
the real map?

542
00:29:28,953 --> 00:29:31,088
Uh, yeah.
It's, uh, over there.

543
00:29:32,556 --> 00:29:34,289
That's it.

544
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:36,258
- This is perfect.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

545
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,727
What are you doing?
You can't take this.

546
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:40,163
We have to.

547
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:41,998
What is that?

548
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,133
It's our dad. And we have
a chance to meet him, but...

549
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:47,536
But we can't do that
without a Phoenix Gem.

550
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:51,339
No! My days of sending people
on dangerous quests are over.

551
00:29:51,341 --> 00:29:52,240
What? Why?

552
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:53,575
'Cause they're dangerous.

553
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:56,478
Corey, the karaoke
machine's broken again.

554
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,384
I'm sorry,
but you are not getting this map.

555
00:30:00,952 --> 00:30:02,284
Don't worry, ladies,

556
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:04,252
your adventure will continue
momentarily.

557
00:30:04,254 --> 00:30:05,988
Okay,
I can handle this.

558
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,825
No, Ian.

559
00:30:09,192 --> 00:30:11,526
Miss mighty Manticore,
ma'am...

560
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:12,762
What are you doing?

561
00:30:12,764 --> 00:30:14,396
Kid, this is not
a good time.

562
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,065
Ugh. I'm giving this place
a one-star review.

563
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:19,334
It's just,
I've never met my dad and...

564
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:20,535
Look,
I'm sorry about that.

565
00:30:20,537 --> 00:30:22,404
But if you get hurt
on one of my quests,

566
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:24,941
guess who gets sued
and loses her tavern?

567
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:26,541
I can't take
that kind of risk.

568
00:30:26,543 --> 00:30:29,678
Now, if you'll just excuse me,
I have important things to do.

569
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,212
Testing.

570
00:30:31,214 --> 00:30:33,248
<i>♪ You haunt my dreams</i>

571
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,549
<i>♪ My inbetweens</i>

572
00:30:34,551 --> 00:30:37,019
Please,
we need that map.

573
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:38,353
No, I am not
giving you the map.

574
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:40,255
That's it!
I am done talking.

575
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:42,959
- Well, I'm not!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

576
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:45,260
You say you can't risk
losing this place.

577
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:46,428
Look at that Manticore.

578
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,864
She looks like
she lived to take risks.

579
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:51,433
That Manticore didn't have
investors to look out for.

580
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,101
She didn't have
payroll to cover.

581
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:55,071
She could just
fly out the door

582
00:30:55,073 --> 00:30:56,605
whenever she wanted
and slay a magma beast.

583
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,841
Are you gonna fix
the machine or not?

584
00:30:58,843 --> 00:31:00,009
Yeah, in a minute.

585
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:01,844
Okay, maybe
this place isn't

586
00:31:01,846 --> 00:31:03,645
as adventurous
as it used to be.

587
00:31:03,647 --> 00:31:05,513
So it isn't filled
with a motley horde

588
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,282
willing to risk
life and limb

589
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:09,384
for the mere taste
of excitement.

590
00:31:09,386 --> 00:31:11,319
But so what?

591
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:13,121
Who ever said you have to
take risks in life

592
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:14,689
to have an adventure?

593
00:31:14,691 --> 00:31:17,294
Apparently, you did.

594
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:24,836
Table 32 said their
mozzarella sticks are cold.

595
00:31:25,937 --> 00:31:27,702
What have I done?

596
00:31:27,704 --> 00:31:28,971
Well, it's not too late.

597
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:30,205
I mean, you could just
give us the map.

598
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:31,439
This place
used to be dangerous.

599
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:32,574
Dangerous!

600
00:31:32,576 --> 00:31:34,175
- And wild!
- Wild!

601
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:37,079
I used to be
dangerous and wild!

602
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:40,283
Dangerous and wild!

603
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:46,055
Wow.

604
00:31:46,057 --> 00:31:49,894
I'm living a lie!
What have I become?

605
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:53,062
Oh, no.

606
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:56,431
Everybody out!

607
00:31:56,433 --> 00:32:00,168
This tavern is closed
for remodeling.

608
00:32:10,148 --> 00:32:13,383
Sorry, the karaoke machine
is broken!

609
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:19,757
Oh.

610
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:24,459
No! No, no, no!

611
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:25,527
No.

612
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:26,530
We gotta go!

613
00:32:36,273 --> 00:32:37,641
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

614
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,653
That was unbelievable.

615
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:53,388
I mean, you were just like...

616
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,124
and the beam
was just floating there!

617
00:32:55,126 --> 00:32:57,059
My brother is a wizard.

618
00:32:57,061 --> 00:32:59,061
I can't believe
that worked.

619
00:32:59,063 --> 00:33:01,463
Oh! You're gonna nail
Dad's spell now.

620
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:03,331
Except we don't
have a map.

621
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:06,534
But we've got this. Behold!

622
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:09,939
Look, on a quest, you have
to use what you've got.

623
00:33:09,941 --> 00:33:11,439
And this is
what we've got.

624
00:33:11,441 --> 00:33:14,944
Best part is, little Kayla
already solved the puzzle.

625
00:33:14,946 --> 00:33:16,779
Well, according to Kayla,

626
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:19,516
we just have to look
for Raven's Point.

627
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:24,053
Raven's Point.
Raven's Point.

628
00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:26,254
Yes! The gem must be
in the mountain.

629
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:27,757
We could be there
by tomorrow morning.

630
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:28,758
Tomorrow morning?

631
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,028
That still gives us
plenty of time with Dad.

632
00:33:34,198 --> 00:33:36,397
Yeah. Well, it looks like

633
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,401
the expressway should
take us right there.

634
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:42,704
Mmm. Expressway is
a little too obvious.

635
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:45,507
On a quest, the clear path
is never the right one.

636
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:46,441
What?

637
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:47,877
During one <i>Quests
of Yore</i> campaign,

638
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:49,845
Shrub Rosehammer and I
took the easy route,

639
00:33:49,847 --> 00:33:52,882
led him straight into the
belly of a gelatinous cube.

640
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:55,017
Only reason I didn't
suffer the same fate?

641
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,351
I followed my gut.

642
00:33:56,353 --> 00:34:00,355
And it's telling me
we take an ancient trail

643
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:02,323
called the Path of Peril.

644
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:04,260
But the expressway
is faster.

645
00:34:04,262 --> 00:34:05,627
Maybe not in the long run.

646
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:07,096
I know you
want this to be

647
00:34:07,098 --> 00:34:08,998
like one of
your adventure games,

648
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,232
but all that matters

649
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:12,001
is that we get to spend
as much time

650
00:34:12,003 --> 00:34:13,703
as possible with Dad.

651
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:21,879
So, we should just take
the expressway, right?

652
00:34:23,047 --> 00:34:25,446
Yeah, you're right.

653
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:27,750
But if you end up
inside a gelatinous cube,

654
00:34:27,752 --> 00:34:30,351
you are on your own.

655
00:34:43,201 --> 00:34:44,867
<i>Manticore's Tavern</i>

656
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:46,334
<i>ahead on your right.</i>

657
00:34:48,873 --> 00:34:50,572
- Hey.
- <i>I'm just checking in.</i>

658
00:34:50,574 --> 00:34:52,041
<i>Did you catch up
to the boys yet?</i>

659
00:34:52,043 --> 00:34:53,108
No, not yet.

660
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,676
But I'm a little worried
because we had

661
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:56,846
a weird family issue
come up,

662
00:34:56,848 --> 00:35:00,082
and, well, this just isn't
like Ian to run off.

663
00:35:00,084 --> 00:35:01,951
I mean, Barley, yes,
but not Ian.

664
00:35:01,953 --> 00:35:03,018
You know, it's late,

665
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,920
you shouldn't have to
be out looking for 'em.

666
00:35:04,922 --> 00:35:06,387
I know, it's silly.

667
00:35:06,389 --> 00:35:08,690
I'm sure they're both
probably on fire.

668
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,359
- <i>Fire?</i>
- Fire! The place is on fire!

669
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:13,528
- My boys! I gotta go!
- <i>Laurel!</i>

670
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,331
Get it off, get it off,
get it off!

671
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,497
Excuse me. Hello?

672
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:18,767
Please, I'm looking for
two teenage elves.

673
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:21,536
I told you already,
there were two teenage elves.

674
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:23,873
Oh! Those are my sons.
Where did they go?

675
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:26,275
Oh. They went on a quest
to find a Phoenix Gem.

676
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:27,609
But don't worry,
don't worry.

677
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:29,477
I told them about the map,
I told them about the gem,

678
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:30,745
I told them
about the curse.

679
00:35:30,747 --> 00:35:32,447
I forgot to
tell them about the curse.

680
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:33,749
- The what?
- Oh, boy.

681
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:35,683
Listen, this one's gone
a little...

682
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:38,787
Your boys are in grave danger!
But I can help!

683
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:40,122
Whoa, hey, hey!

684
00:35:40,124 --> 00:35:43,458
You're not going anywhere.
We got questions for you.

685
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,527
I know where they're going!
We can still save them!

686
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,398
Okay, I think
everything's good here.

687
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:53,135
Last name "Manticore",
first name "The".

688
00:35:53,137 --> 00:35:55,971
Hold on, you're right.
She has gone a little...

689
00:35:55,973 --> 00:35:59,110
It's no wonder with
a wound like that.

690
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:01,377
That's just a scratch.

691
00:36:01,379 --> 00:36:03,711
Oh, I'm sorry, are you
an expert on minotaurs?

692
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:05,114
- Manticores.
- Manticores?

693
00:36:05,116 --> 00:36:06,181
Well, no...

694
00:36:06,183 --> 00:36:07,349
Well, then
you wouldn't know

695
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:09,218
that when their blood
is exposed to air,

696
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,485
it makes them go bonkers.

697
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:11,787
I don't think
that's true.

698
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:13,923
See? She's already losing
her grip on reality.

699
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:15,590
So, why don't you let me
save her life

700
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,192
before it costs you yours?

701
00:36:17,194 --> 00:36:18,726
- Okay.
- Thank you.

702
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:21,297
Could we have a little privacy
here, please?

703
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:22,730
Just lie back.
That's good.

704
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:24,532
But get your head
a little bit higher.

705
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:27,071
Just don't take too long
back there, okay?

706
00:36:27,637 --> 00:36:29,038
Hey, you hear me?

707
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,307
I said don't take
too long back there,

708
00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:32,742
because...

709
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,612
All right,
how do we help my boys?

710
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,615
Ooh! I'm gonna like you.

711
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:43,052
Radio,
headlights, brakes,

712
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:44,420
tires, rims.

713
00:36:44,422 --> 00:36:45,854
I mean, it's hard
to tell now, Dad,

714
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:47,022
before I replaced
her parts,

715
00:36:47,024 --> 00:36:48,960
Guinevere was actually
kind of a piece of junk.

716
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:56,233
Looks like we're not gonna get
to do everything today, Dad.

717
00:36:57,802 --> 00:36:58,869
That's okay.

718
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:01,138
I just wanna meet you.

719
00:37:04,741 --> 00:37:07,376
But don't worry, we'll,
uh, have you fixed up

720
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:09,111
and back home to see...

721
00:37:09,113 --> 00:37:10,545
Oh, man. Mom!

722
00:37:10,547 --> 00:37:11,914
Barley, we're not
gonna be able

723
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:14,249
to get Dad back in time
to see Mom.

724
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:15,650
Oh.

725
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:18,153
Well, Dad, at least you won't
have to meet the new guy.

726
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:21,556
So,
you workin' hard or hardly workin'?

727
00:37:22,994 --> 00:37:23,859
Yeah.

728
00:37:23,861 --> 00:37:25,526
Barley, Barley, Barley.

729
00:37:25,528 --> 00:37:27,528
Every time there's trouble,
I gotta deal with you.

730
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,831
Is that your Colt?

731
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:29,697
Yeah.

732
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:31,266
You're gonna
wanna work on that.

733
00:37:31,268 --> 00:37:33,737
No, no, no!
Come on, old girl.

734
00:37:40,811 --> 00:37:42,610
I thought you
said you fixed the van.

735
00:37:42,612 --> 00:37:44,579
Relax. Guinevere is fine.

736
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:45,881
Her stomach
is just a little empty.

737
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:47,449
But it says
we have a full tank.

738
00:37:47,451 --> 00:37:49,820
No. That doesn't work.

739
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:58,229
Oh. Only a few drops left.

740
00:37:58,963 --> 00:38:01,531
Maybe if
there's a gas station...

741
00:38:06,504 --> 00:38:07,836
Hmm.

742
00:38:14,412 --> 00:38:16,845
Is there a magic way
to get gas?

743
00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:20,617
Oh!
I like your thinking, young mage.

744
00:38:23,154 --> 00:38:24,119
Growth spell!

745
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:26,388
We grow the can,
and then the gas inside

746
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,555
will grow with it.

747
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:30,259
Uh, that's kind of
a weird idea.

748
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:32,161
I know!
I like it, too.

749
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:33,429
Okay.

750
00:38:33,431 --> 00:38:35,864
Loosen up. Heart's fire.
Here we go.

751
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:38,666
Whoa. It's not
that simple.

752
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:39,935
This one learns
a little magic,

753
00:38:39,937 --> 00:38:41,537
thinks he's Shamblefoot
the Wondrous,

754
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:43,005
am I right, Dad?

755
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:45,240
A growth spell is a
bit more advanced.

756
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,675
Not only do you have to
speak from your heart's fire,

757
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:50,179
but now you also have to
follow a magic decree.

758
00:38:50,181 --> 00:38:51,346
A magic what?

759
00:38:51,348 --> 00:38:54,416
It's a special rule that keeps
the spell working right.

760
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:56,518
This one states,
"To magnify an object,

761
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,888
"you have to magnify
your attention upon it."

762
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,824
While you cast
the spell,

763
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:04,326
you can't let anything
distract you.

764
00:39:04,328 --> 00:39:05,461
Okay.

765
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:06,528
Ow!

766
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,628
- What?
- Splinter.

767
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,931
Can we sand
this thing down?

768
00:39:08,933 --> 00:39:10,399
No. It's an ancient staff

769
00:39:10,401 --> 00:39:12,267
with magic
in every glorious fiber.

770
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:13,601
You can't sand it down.

771
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:17,773
All right. All right.
Here we go. Focus.

772
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:20,309
- Uh...
- Something wrong?

773
00:39:20,311 --> 00:39:22,743
Sorry, it's just,
your stance is, uh... Here.

774
00:39:22,745 --> 00:39:24,712
Chin up, elbows out,
feet apart,

775
00:39:24,714 --> 00:39:26,381
back slightly arched.

776
00:39:26,383 --> 00:39:28,083
- Okay, how's that feel?
- Great.

777
00:39:28,085 --> 00:39:30,018
- Oh, one more thing...
- Barley!

778
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,155
Okay, okay.

779
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:37,394
<i>Magnora Gantuan!</i>

780
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:41,830
Don't let the magic
spook you.

781
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:42,833
Okay.

782
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:45,167
- Elbows!
- What?

783
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:46,201
Elbows up!

784
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:47,668
No, no, no, it's too high.
That's too high.

785
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,037
I'm trying to focus here.

786
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:51,041
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Focus. Focus on the can.

787
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:53,575
Focus.

788
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,245
Focus.

789
00:39:56,247 --> 00:39:58,048
Barley! Ah!
Forget it!

790
00:40:00,551 --> 00:40:02,518
It worked!

791
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,255
The can is huge.

792
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:06,555
And the van is huge.

793
00:40:06,557 --> 00:40:07,655
And you're...

794
00:40:07,657 --> 00:40:08,857
Oh, no.

795
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:10,526
- What happened?
- Looks like you shrunk me.

796
00:40:10,528 --> 00:40:11,894
How?

797
00:40:11,896 --> 00:40:13,795
Well, if you mess up a spell,
there are consequences.

798
00:40:13,797 --> 00:40:15,898
I only messed up because you
wouldn't stop bothering me.

799
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,266
I was trying
to help you.

800
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:18,467
Well, don't try
to help me.

801
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:20,602
Oh, okay. Fine.
I won't!

802
00:40:20,604 --> 00:40:23,073
Whoa, whoa. Dad, it's me.

803
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:26,208
Whoa! Dad, it's okay.
Don't worry.

804
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,311
I'm gonna fix this.

805
00:40:28,745 --> 00:40:29,811
Well, where are you going?

806
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:31,146
To find a gas station.

807
00:40:31,148 --> 00:40:32,948
- Well, I'm going, too.
- Fine.

808
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,418
Hey, I don't
need your help.

809
00:40:34,818 --> 00:40:36,453
Fine with me.

810
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:40,457
Oh.

811
00:40:51,635 --> 00:40:52,901
I just need
a little break.

812
00:40:52,903 --> 00:40:54,939
My baby legs
can't go that fast.

813
00:40:57,441 --> 00:40:59,740
Look, a gas station.

814
00:40:59,742 --> 00:41:00,909
Good.

815
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:03,579
Oh, wait, I forgot.

816
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:05,781
You don't need my help.

817
00:41:05,783 --> 00:41:09,386
Hey, I don't need you to carry me.
I'm a grown man.

818
00:41:11,155 --> 00:41:12,688
Dad!

819
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,324
Come on, it's okay.
Barley is with me.

820
00:41:15,326 --> 00:41:16,491
Yeah, I'm fine, Dad.

821
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:18,560
The side effects are supposed
to wear off eventually.

822
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:19,727
Do I look
any bigger yet?

823
00:41:37,747 --> 00:41:39,514
Hey! Did you
just bump into me?

824
00:41:39,516 --> 00:41:41,550
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't see you there.

825
00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:44,686
Do it again,
and you'll see me in your nightmares.

826
00:41:59,169 --> 00:42:01,169
This one's lucky.
I know it.

827
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:05,040
Give me a bag of extra-sours.
Keep the change.

828
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:07,177
Outta the way,
beanstalk.

829
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:10,912
Uh, 10 on pump two,
please.

830
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:15,617
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting us food.

831
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:17,085
All right, I got it.

832
00:42:17,087 --> 00:42:19,288
And a couple of these.
Thank you.

833
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,623
Psst. I have to
go to the bathroom.

834
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:22,691
Can it wait?

835
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:24,426
It's your pocket.

836
00:42:24,428 --> 00:42:27,062
Can we have the bathroom
key, please?

837
00:42:27,064 --> 00:42:29,064
Okay, be quick.
I want to get out of here.

838
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:31,500
Okay, I'm goin'.

839
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:33,370
That'll be 12.99.

840
00:42:34,038 --> 00:42:35,570
Hey, watch it!

841
00:42:35,572 --> 00:42:37,541
You got a problem, Shades?

842
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:41,076
Answer me
when I'm talking to you.

843
00:42:41,078 --> 00:42:43,078
I'm sorry,
I don't really know

844
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,713
where his head's
at right now.

845
00:42:44,715 --> 00:42:46,517
How could this night
get any worse?

846
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:51,386
You know, I would
fly us to help your boys,

847
00:42:51,388 --> 00:42:54,022
but the old wings aren't
what they used to be.

848
00:42:54,024 --> 00:42:56,425
Oh, that's fine.
So, about this curse...

849
00:42:56,427 --> 00:42:57,626
It's my own fault.

850
00:42:57,628 --> 00:42:59,127
I should be doing
my wing exercises

851
00:42:59,129 --> 00:43:00,797
every morning,
but you know how that goes.

852
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:02,998
Please, the curse.
What does it do?

853
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,835
Right. Sorry.
It's a Guardian Curse.

854
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:10,238
If your boys take the gem,
the curse will rise up

855
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,741
and assume the form
of a mighty beast,

856
00:43:12,743 --> 00:43:14,710
and battle
your sons to the...

857
00:43:14,712 --> 00:43:17,346
Ooh. Well, how do
your boys do in a crisis?

858
00:43:17,348 --> 00:43:19,247
Not great. One of them
is afraid of everything,

859
00:43:19,249 --> 00:43:21,149
and the other
isn't afraid of anything.

860
00:43:21,151 --> 00:43:24,119
Yeah, that skinny kid
of yours is pretty fearless.

861
00:43:24,121 --> 00:43:25,987
No, no. You mean
the big one, Barley.

862
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:28,957
No, no, the little guy.
Ooh, he really let me have it.

863
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:31,993
What? No, look, you said
you could help them, right?

864
00:43:31,995 --> 00:43:33,364
Every curse has a core,

865
00:43:34,064 --> 00:43:36,031
the center of its power.

866
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,699
And only one weapon
forged of

867
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:39,802
the rarest metals
can destroy it,

868
00:43:39,804 --> 00:43:41,870
my enchanted sword,

869
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:44,339
the Curse Crusher!

870
00:43:44,341 --> 00:43:47,442
Well, okay, but you don't
seem to have that on you.

871
00:43:47,444 --> 00:43:49,244
I sold it.

872
00:43:49,246 --> 00:43:51,213
Got in a little tax trouble
a few years back.

873
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:54,516
But don't worry,
I know just where to find it.

874
00:43:54,518 --> 00:43:55,785
I am on my way, boys.

875
00:43:55,787 --> 00:43:58,021
Just try to stay
out of trouble.

876
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:04,794
What is
taking you so long?

877
00:44:04,796 --> 00:44:06,296
Who you
calling "whimsical"?

878
00:44:06,697 --> 00:44:08,096
Oh, no.

879
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:09,564
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You've got a lot of nerve.

880
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:10,499
I'm just saying,

881
00:44:10,501 --> 00:44:12,769
sprites used to fly around
spreading delight.

882
00:44:12,771 --> 00:44:13,902
That's a good thing.

883
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:15,504
Sprites can't fly.

884
00:44:15,506 --> 00:44:18,640
Well, your wings don't work
'cause you stopped using them.

885
00:44:18,642 --> 00:44:21,109
- You calling me lazy?
- No, no, no.

886
00:44:21,111 --> 00:44:23,311
Not you.
Your ancestors.

887
00:44:23,313 --> 00:44:25,580
What did you say
about my ancestors?

888
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:26,749
I didn't mean lazy...

889
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,283
I'm sorry, very sorry.
He's sorry, too.

890
00:44:28,285 --> 00:44:30,018
You don't need to fly.
Who needs to fly?

891
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,386
I mean, you've got
those great bikes.

892
00:44:31,388 --> 00:44:33,622
What are you doing?
I was just discussing history.

893
00:44:33,624 --> 00:44:36,057
Barley, I'm trying to
take care of you and Dad,

894
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:37,760
and you're not making it
any easier.

895
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:39,363
Dad, come on.

896
00:44:40,464 --> 00:44:41,530
Oh, no.

897
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:46,003
Hey! You're dead!

898
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,304
We're dead! We're dead!
We're dead!

899
00:44:49,306 --> 00:44:51,774
Relax. They won't be
able to lift those bikes.

900
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:53,375
They are strong.

901
00:44:53,377 --> 00:44:55,477
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

902
00:44:55,479 --> 00:44:56,545
It's locked.

903
00:44:56,547 --> 00:44:57,548
What?
Where are the keys?

904
00:45:00,717 --> 00:45:02,152
I got this.

905
00:45:02,887 --> 00:45:04,419
Come on, Barley.

906
00:45:04,421 --> 00:45:06,023
Whoa!

907
00:45:07,424 --> 00:45:08,623
Okay, go, go, go!

908
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,227
No. No, no, no. No way.

909
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:13,430
You're gonna have to.

910
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:20,101
Come on.
Why won't it start?

911
00:45:20,103 --> 00:45:21,236
There's a sweet spot.

912
00:45:21,238 --> 00:45:22,637
Not in the middle,
not quite at the end.

913
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:24,074
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

914
00:45:25,175 --> 00:45:27,676
Come on, Guinevere!

915
00:45:27,678 --> 00:45:30,380
Put it in "o" for "onward."

916
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:37,354
Drive!

917
00:45:40,892 --> 00:45:43,091
Okay, you're gonna
have to merge.

918
00:45:44,963 --> 00:45:46,127
- Speed up!
- I can't do this.

919
00:45:46,129 --> 00:45:47,763
- Yes, you can.
- I'm not ready!

920
00:45:47,765 --> 00:45:49,664
You'll never be ready. Merge!

921
00:45:52,703 --> 00:45:54,772
Nice job!

922
00:46:00,143 --> 00:46:02,379
- Hey, don't hit Gwinny.
- Barley!

923
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:07,148
- Oh, no.
- Get around 'em!

924
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,751
- They're not letting me in.
- Signal.

925
00:46:08,753 --> 00:46:10,051
You don't have a signaler.

926
00:46:10,053 --> 00:46:12,589
Stick your arm straight out
the window to signal left.

927
00:46:19,563 --> 00:46:22,432
- Get back here.
- Just keep driving.

928
00:46:28,672 --> 00:46:30,107
Barley!

929
00:46:33,912 --> 00:46:36,077
The mountains are north.

930
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,681
You need to get
all the way over.

931
00:46:41,552 --> 00:46:42,617
What the...?

932
00:46:43,821 --> 00:46:46,323
Oh, it is on, Shades!
Get 'em!

933
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:02,337
- Ian, stay focused!
- I can't!

934
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:05,642
You have to focus
or we are all dead!

935
00:47:07,244 --> 00:47:09,379
Just stay cool.

936
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:20,056
Way to go, Guinevere!

937
00:47:24,494 --> 00:47:25,495
Hit it!

938
00:47:29,232 --> 00:47:31,000
We're not gonna make it!

939
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:50,019
Dad, are you okay?

940
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:52,220
He's fine, thanks to
the skillful driving

941
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:54,824
of Sir Ian Lightfoot.
High five!

942
00:47:54,826 --> 00:47:56,058
What is happening?

943
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,228
I think the spell
is wearing off.

944
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:00,330
Get off my face.

945
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:10,171
Chantor's Talon! Cops!

946
00:48:10,173 --> 00:48:11,673
- Pull over.
- I don't have a license.

947
00:48:11,675 --> 00:48:13,577
My wallet's still tiny.

948
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:20,215
<i>Step out
of the vehicle.</i>

949
00:48:20,217 --> 00:48:21,549
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

950
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:23,553
How are we gonna explain...?
Oh, no. Dad!

951
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,330
You have a long night
there, buddy?

952
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:36,431
Sir, I'm gonna ask you

953
00:48:36,433 --> 00:48:37,499
to walk this straight line.

954
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:38,801
They're gonna take Dad.

955
00:48:38,803 --> 00:48:39,668
Okay, okay.

956
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,237
Oh, I got it.
The disguise spell.

957
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,074
You can disguise yourself
to be anyone you want.

958
00:48:45,076 --> 00:48:46,207
But what if I
mess up again?

959
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:47,375
According to the spell,

960
00:48:47,377 --> 00:48:49,277
"Disguising yourself
is a lie,

961
00:48:49,279 --> 00:48:51,147
"so you must tell the truth
to get by."

962
00:48:51,149 --> 00:48:54,249
As long as you don't tell a
lie, the spell will be fine.

963
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:57,619
Okay. Who are
we gonna be?

964
00:48:57,621 --> 00:48:59,789
Okay, we're taking you
down to the station.

965
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:02,792
What seems to be the problem

966
00:49:02,794 --> 00:49:06,261
here, fellow police folk?

967
00:49:06,263 --> 00:49:07,362
Officer Bronco?

968
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:09,165
Were you in that van?

969
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:10,665
Affirmative.
And we will...

970
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:13,002
I mean, I will take
full responsibility

971
00:49:13,004 --> 00:49:14,302
for that fella right there,

972
00:49:14,304 --> 00:49:16,504
so you can just release him
over to me.

973
00:49:16,506 --> 00:49:18,239
Hey,
I wanted to be the front.

974
00:49:18,241 --> 00:49:19,607
No way.
I'll do the talking.

975
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:21,043
Bronco, I thought
you were working

976
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:22,277
on the other
side of town.

977
00:49:22,279 --> 00:49:23,948
I, uh, changed my mind.

978
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:26,816
Something wrong?

979
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:28,719
Just a little neck cramp.

980
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,353
You have to stop lying.

981
00:49:32,355 --> 00:49:34,255
Answer every question
with a question.

982
00:49:34,257 --> 00:49:36,224
What exactly
are you doing out here?

983
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:38,493
Uh... What am I doing
out here?

984
00:49:38,495 --> 00:49:41,362
What are any of us
doing out here?

985
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:44,532
Whoa. I never thought
about it like that.

986
00:49:44,534 --> 00:49:45,734
Nice.

987
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:47,970
With all due respect,
you didn't answer my question.

988
00:49:47,972 --> 00:49:50,338
Well, we were
just exercising

989
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,377
some driver's education
drills for Ian.

990
00:49:55,345 --> 00:49:57,113
Who is Ian?

991
00:49:57,115 --> 00:49:59,347
Oh, is that
Laurel's kid?

992
00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:02,184
Ian is Laurel's kid.

993
00:50:02,186 --> 00:50:05,020
Your stepson was swerving
all over the road.

994
00:50:05,022 --> 00:50:06,254
Yeah, well...

995
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:08,356
that guy's
not all there today.

996
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:11,361
Yeah, he does seem
a little off.

997
00:50:12,562 --> 00:50:15,330
You seem
a little off yourself.

998
00:50:15,332 --> 00:50:19,135
Uh, actually, if I'm being
completely honest,

999
00:50:19,137 --> 00:50:20,435
I'm not super great

1000
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:21,871
in this kind
of situation,

1001
00:50:21,873 --> 00:50:23,906
and I'm starting
to freak out a little bit.

1002
00:50:23,908 --> 00:50:27,475
And I'm all sweaty and weird,
and I don't know what to say

1003
00:50:27,477 --> 00:50:29,912
and I just feel like
I can't do anything right,

1004
00:50:29,914 --> 00:50:31,412
and I'm a total weirdo.

1005
00:50:31,414 --> 00:50:34,083
Hold on, hold on.

1006
00:50:34,085 --> 00:50:36,684
I think I know
what's going on here.

1007
00:50:36,686 --> 00:50:38,286
Uh... You do?

1008
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:40,488
It's not easy
being a new parent.

1009
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:43,058
My girlfriend's daughter got
me pulling my hair out, okay?

1010
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,994
Oh. Oh, yeah.

1011
00:50:44,996 --> 00:50:46,762
All right,
we can let him go.

1012
00:50:46,764 --> 00:50:50,833
Okay, well, I'm just gonna
take him to the van.

1013
00:50:50,835 --> 00:50:53,869
Hey, it gets better. All right?
Good luck, Bronco.

1014
00:50:53,871 --> 00:50:55,403
You, too, Officer.

1015
00:50:55,405 --> 00:50:58,174
Keep workin' hard
or hardly workin'.

1016
00:50:59,409 --> 00:51:02,077
Now, that was
a good Colt.

1017
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,645
I don't envy you,
Bronco.

1018
00:51:03,647 --> 00:51:05,848
That Lightfoot kid
is a handful.

1019
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:08,683
Uh, I'm gonna have to
disagree with you there.

1020
00:51:08,685 --> 00:51:11,887
I think Ian's
a pretty stand-up citizen.

1021
00:51:11,889 --> 00:51:14,656
Not him,
the older one.

1022
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:15,523
What?

1023
00:51:15,525 --> 00:51:18,326
I mean,
the guy's a screwup.

1024
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,129
You can't say
you don't agree.

1025
00:51:20,131 --> 00:51:21,731
Um, I don't.

1026
00:51:24,135 --> 00:51:25,335
What?

1027
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:28,336
I mean, okay, well...

1028
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:30,873
I gotta get going.
Gotta get Ian home.

1029
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:33,575
I mean, I'm late for work.

1030
00:51:33,577 --> 00:51:35,376
Sorry, I mean,
I'm feelin' a little sick.

1031
00:51:35,378 --> 00:51:37,412
I mean tired.
Sick and tired. Gotta go!

1032
00:51:37,414 --> 00:51:38,783
See you Monday!

1033
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,855
Oh, man.
Bronco is losin' it.

1034
00:51:45,857 --> 00:51:47,790
See, that's why
I never got married.

1035
00:51:47,792 --> 00:51:49,994
Old Gore can't
be tied down.

1036
00:51:55,498 --> 00:51:57,099
This is Specter.

1037
00:51:57,101 --> 00:52:00,771
Can you put me through
to Officer Colt Bronco?

1038
00:52:10,747 --> 00:52:14,250
Barley, I don't know
what happened back there.

1039
00:52:14,252 --> 00:52:16,553
But I don't think
you're a screwup.

1040
00:52:19,023 --> 00:52:21,926
Maybe the magic just got it
wrong, you know.

1041
00:52:22,994 --> 00:52:24,159
Yeah.

1042
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:28,730
I don't know
what happened.

1043
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:30,966
Barley! Barley!

1044
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:39,409
Where are you going?

1045
00:52:40,912 --> 00:52:42,945
Barley, come on.
This is all just...

1046
00:52:42,947 --> 00:52:44,179
I'm not a screwup.

1047
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:45,446
I didn't say
you were.

1048
00:52:45,448 --> 00:52:47,182
The magic said it for you.

1049
00:52:47,184 --> 00:52:48,784
Well, the magic
got it wrong.

1050
00:52:48,786 --> 00:52:50,451
Magic doesn't
get it wrong!

1051
00:52:50,453 --> 00:52:51,754
The cop asked a question,

1052
00:52:51,756 --> 00:52:54,722
you answered, and magic
revealed the truth. Right?

1053
00:52:54,724 --> 00:52:55,590
Right?

1054
00:52:55,592 --> 00:52:57,625
I don't know how
any of this stuff works.

1055
00:52:57,627 --> 00:52:59,427
All I know is
that everything

1056
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:01,096
we've done tonight
has gone wrong.

1057
00:53:01,098 --> 00:53:02,998
Yeah, it's gone wrong because
you won't listen to me.

1058
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,133
Are you kidding?

1059
00:53:04,135 --> 00:53:05,768
Because everything we've
done has been your idea.

1060
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:07,036
But you didn't do it my way.

1061
00:53:07,038 --> 00:53:08,736
You didn't let me
handle the Manticore.

1062
00:53:08,738 --> 00:53:10,505
You freaked out when I
talked to the sprites.

1063
00:53:10,507 --> 00:53:12,007
'Cause you don't think
I have good ideas.

1064
00:53:12,009 --> 00:53:13,208
What? Of course I do.

1065
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:15,878
Great! Then I think we should
take the Path of Peril.

1066
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,048
And I also think that
would be good, normally...

1067
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:19,915
See?

1068
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:21,616
But, I told you,
this isn't a game.

1069
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:23,419
All that matters today
is Dad,

1070
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:25,620
and right now
he's sitting in that van,

1071
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:27,089
and he's confused...

1072
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:28,092
What?

1073
00:53:31,896 --> 00:53:33,128
What is he doing?

1074
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:35,663
I think he can feel the
vibrations of the music,

1075
00:53:35,665 --> 00:53:38,202
and he's dancing.

1076
00:53:41,939 --> 00:53:42,974
Wow.

1077
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,910
He is terrible.

1078
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:53,951
Yeah. He's really,
really bad.

1079
00:53:54,752 --> 00:53:56,452
Oh, no.
Here he comes.

1080
00:53:56,454 --> 00:53:58,519
No, no, no. Thanks, Dad.
Dad, thank you.

1081
00:53:58,521 --> 00:53:59,654
I'm good.

1082
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:00,923
Stop.

1083
00:54:00,925 --> 00:54:03,225
Okay. Okay.

1084
00:54:03,227 --> 00:54:04,659
No, no, no!

1085
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,494
I'm not really
a big dancer.

1086
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:07,898
Uh...

1087
00:54:10,301 --> 00:54:13,302
Just imagine what the top half
of this dance looks like.

1088
00:54:13,304 --> 00:54:15,572
I bet it goes
something like this.

1089
00:54:24,614 --> 00:54:25,914
Ow.

1090
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:28,252
Ah, you danced your
shoelaces loose there, Pop.

1091
00:54:32,023 --> 00:54:35,026
You know,
I wanna see him, too.

1092
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,761
Yeah, I know.

1093
00:54:38,763 --> 00:54:40,661
It's not fair for you
to call me a screwup

1094
00:54:40,663 --> 00:54:43,700
if you don't give me a chance
to get something right.

1095
00:54:44,301 --> 00:54:46,237
Just do one thing
my way.

1096
00:54:47,471 --> 00:54:50,072
You really think
this Path of Peril

1097
00:54:50,074 --> 00:54:52,143
is the best way
to go to the mountain?

1098
00:54:56,113 --> 00:54:57,281
Okay.

1099
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:14,863
Uh... So, where is
your magic sword?

1100
00:55:14,865 --> 00:55:17,134
It lies beyond
those gates.

1101
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:21,236
If we don't leave here
with the sword,

1102
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:23,238
your boys are doomed.

1103
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,506
There you are.

1104
00:55:24,508 --> 00:55:26,275
One garlic crusher.

1105
00:55:26,277 --> 00:55:27,742
No, Curse Crusher.

1106
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:29,945
It's a large magical sword.

1107
00:55:29,947 --> 00:55:31,113
Sword.

1108
00:55:31,115 --> 00:55:33,482
Sword, sword, sword.

1109
00:55:33,484 --> 00:55:35,152
I mean, I got this thing.

1110
00:55:36,353 --> 00:55:37,886
- That's it!
- How much?

1111
00:55:38,856 --> 00:55:41,557
- Let's call it, uh, 10.
- Great!

1112
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:43,258
Forged of
the rarest metals,

1113
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,261
the only sword of its kind
in all the land.

1114
00:55:47,264 --> 00:55:50,399
Hello, old friend.
We shall never part again.

1115
00:55:50,401 --> 00:55:52,401
Oh! Turns out this sword

1116
00:55:52,403 --> 00:55:55,703
is the only sword of its
kind in all the land.

1117
00:55:55,705 --> 00:55:59,640
So, let's call it 10,000.

1118
00:55:59,642 --> 00:56:03,145
- You can't do that!
- Well, I just did.

1119
00:56:03,147 --> 00:56:04,679
Okay, you had better...

1120
00:56:04,681 --> 00:56:06,647
Yeah?

1121
00:56:06,649 --> 00:56:08,317
Hey, I talked
to some other officers,

1122
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,552
and they said the boys
were last seen going north.

1123
00:56:10,554 --> 00:56:12,121
- Are they okay?
- <i>They're fine.</i>

1124
00:56:12,123 --> 00:56:14,423
But the officers said...
Well, honey,

1125
00:56:14,425 --> 00:56:17,126
<i>this night keeps getting
stranger and stranger.</i>

1126
00:56:17,128 --> 00:56:18,794
Do you know who I am?

1127
00:56:18,796 --> 00:56:20,963
Some kind of
winged bear-snake lady?

1128
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:23,265
Argh! Winged
lion-scorpion lady!

1129
00:56:23,267 --> 00:56:24,632
It sure does.

1130
00:56:24,634 --> 00:56:26,135
Listen, I need
that sword.

1131
00:56:26,137 --> 00:56:28,170
My sons have a
once-in-a-lifetime chance

1132
00:56:28,172 --> 00:56:29,238
to see their father.

1133
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,241
Now, my oldest son...

1134
00:56:31,876 --> 00:56:34,109
Holy son of a...
You killed her!

1135
00:56:34,111 --> 00:56:36,812
It's okay. She's only
temporarily paralyzed.

1136
00:56:36,814 --> 00:56:38,480
Hey, you can't do this.

1137
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:40,382
- Well, I just did.
- Grab the sword.

1138
00:56:40,384 --> 00:56:41,583
Don't you touch that.

1139
00:56:41,585 --> 00:56:42,751
Here you go.

1140
00:56:42,753 --> 00:56:44,253
And a little something extra
for your trouble.

1141
00:56:44,255 --> 00:56:45,420
I love your store.

1142
00:56:45,422 --> 00:56:46,957
Oh, that's so pretty.

1143
00:56:47,391 --> 00:56:49,091
Hey! Hey!

1144
00:56:49,093 --> 00:56:50,893
Yeah!

1145
00:56:50,895 --> 00:56:52,294
Laurel, what's happening?

1146
00:56:52,296 --> 00:56:54,129
- Yeah!
- <i>Hello? Are you all right?</i>

1147
00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:55,097
<i>Laurel?</i>

1148
00:56:55,099 --> 00:56:57,566
Oh, Colt, I can't talk.
The boys need me.

1149
00:56:57,568 --> 00:56:59,434
Wait!

1150
00:56:59,436 --> 00:57:01,105
Dang those kids.

1151
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:06,709
Huh.

1152
00:57:33,204 --> 00:57:35,070
<i>♪ We're heading on a quest</i>

1153
00:57:35,072 --> 00:57:36,805
<i>♪ Our father we must retrieve</i>

1154
00:57:36,807 --> 00:57:38,974
<i>♪ The Lightfoot brothers
can't be stopped</i>

1155

<i>♪ Something, something</i>

<i>♪ That rhymes with retrieve</i>

1157
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:49,117
Yeah, we're still here.

1158
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,521
Well, good morning to thee,
dear Lightfoot men.

1159
00:57:52,523 --> 00:57:55,490
Welcome to
the Path of Peril.

1160
00:57:55,492 --> 00:57:57,626
It's not
much of a path.

1161
00:57:57,628 --> 00:58:00,295
Well, you know, they never
really developed around here.

1162
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:02,231
So, heads up, we could
run into anything.

1163
00:58:02,233 --> 00:58:05,500
A centicore, wolf dragon,
gelatinous cube.

1164
00:58:05,502 --> 00:58:07,970
Okay, what is
a gelatinous cube?

1165
00:58:07,972 --> 00:58:09,871
Oh, it's
a giant green cube

1166
00:58:09,873 --> 00:58:12,774
that instantly disintegrates
all that it touches.

1167
00:58:12,776 --> 00:58:14,676
We are not gonna
run into a... Oh! Stop!

1168
00:58:14,678 --> 00:58:16,247
Ahh!

1169
00:58:25,456 --> 00:58:26,755
What is this?

1170
00:58:26,757 --> 00:58:28,156
Bottomless pit.

1171
00:58:28,158 --> 00:58:32,160
Whatever falls in there,
falls forever.

1172
00:58:34,932 --> 00:58:37,266
Aw, Dad, come here.

1173
00:58:37,268 --> 00:58:38,233
Ian, check it out.

1174
00:58:38,235 --> 00:58:41,737
This is
an ancient drawbridge.

1175
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:43,005
We lower that bad boy

1176
00:58:43,007 --> 00:58:45,776
and we are on our way
to Raven's Point.

1177
00:58:46,677 --> 00:58:48,879
Look around for a lever.

1178
00:58:50,547 --> 00:58:51,747
Found it.

1179
00:58:51,749 --> 00:58:54,318
But it's on
the other side.

1180
00:58:55,252 --> 00:58:57,421
Okay, I got this.

1181
00:58:57,855 --> 00:58:59,456
<i>Aloft Elevar.</i>

1182
00:59:03,894 --> 00:59:05,527
You can't cast
a levitation spell

1183
00:59:05,529 --> 00:59:06,928
on something
that far away.

1184
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:09,131
It only has, like, a 15-meter
enchanting radius.

1185
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:11,135
Dad, can you
believe this guy?

1186
00:59:12,202 --> 00:59:14,836
What we need
is a Trust Bridge.

1187
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:17,205
It's a spell that creates
a magical bridge

1188
00:59:17,207 --> 00:59:18,540
you can walk on.

1189
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:21,743
Just say
<i>"Bridgrigar Invisia."</i>

1190
00:59:21,745 --> 00:59:23,945
Okay.
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia.</i>

1191
00:59:23,947 --> 00:59:26,283
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia!</i>

1192
00:59:29,186 --> 00:59:31,420
- It didn't work.
- No, the spell's still going.

1193
00:59:31,422 --> 00:59:33,922
You won't know if your bridge
worked until you step on it.

1194
00:59:33,924 --> 00:59:35,190
Step on what?

1195
00:59:35,192 --> 00:59:37,159
If you believe the bridge
is there, then it's there.

1196
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:39,227
- But it's not.
- Well, not with that attitude.

1197
00:59:39,229 --> 00:59:41,498
I'm not gonna step out
onto nothing.

1198
00:59:44,568 --> 00:59:46,101
Now we've got a rope.

1199
00:59:46,103 --> 00:59:47,703
But you're not gonna
even need it because...

1200
00:59:47,705 --> 00:59:48,937
- I want the rope!
- Okay.

1201
00:59:48,939 --> 00:59:50,739
I'm just saying you're not
gonna need the rope,

1202
00:59:50,741 --> 00:59:52,976
because I know
you can make that bridge.

1203
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,788
I'm dying! I'm dying! I'm dead!
I'm dead! I'm dead!

1204
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,589
- Oh, my life is over.
- I got you.

1205
01:00:10,894 --> 01:00:12,127
Okay, you fell.

1206
01:00:12,129 --> 01:00:13,895
- But was that so bad?
- Yes!

1207
01:00:13,897 --> 01:00:16,932
- Are you still alive?
- Yes.

1208
01:00:16,934 --> 01:00:19,836
Okay, so now you know
the worst that can happen.

1209
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:22,306
So, there's nothing
to be scared of, right?

1210
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:28,946
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia!</i>

1211
01:00:31,915 --> 01:00:35,652
Hey. You can do this.

1212
01:00:44,228 --> 01:00:46,595
- Yeah!
- There you go!

1213
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:50,767
Believe with
every step.

1214
01:00:53,303 --> 01:00:55,305
Oh, yeah!

1215
01:00:58,843 --> 01:00:59,975
You've got me, right?

1216
01:00:59,977 --> 01:01:01,178
I still got you.

1217
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:05,983
Ian Lightfoot
is fearless.

1218
01:01:09,788 --> 01:01:12,256
This is amazing!

1219
01:01:14,826 --> 01:01:16,391
Yeah! But just keep going.

1220
01:01:16,393 --> 01:01:19,463
Don't look back.
Just straight ahead.

1221
01:01:21,131 --> 01:01:23,365
You've still got
the rope, right?

1222
01:01:23,367 --> 01:01:25,000
Yeah, I got it.

1223
01:01:25,002 --> 01:01:27,736
I am not afraid!

1224
01:01:27,738 --> 01:01:30,672
Oh, man, I could stay
out here all day.

1225
01:01:30,674 --> 01:01:32,007
Huh. Huh.

1226
01:01:32,009 --> 01:01:34,777
Okay, but keep moving.
We've gotta see Dad, remember?

1227
01:01:34,779 --> 01:01:38,449
Hey, Dad,
this last step is for you.

1228
01:01:39,784 --> 01:01:41,952
Ahh!

1229
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:48,791
Oh.

1230
01:01:55,934 --> 01:01:57,800
He did it, Dad.

1231
01:02:05,609 --> 01:02:07,910
That was amazing.

1232
01:02:07,912 --> 01:02:10,412
How long was
the rope gone?

1233
01:02:10,414 --> 01:02:13,383
Oh, just, like,
the second half of it.

1234
01:02:13,885 --> 01:02:16,017
I needed that rope.

1235
01:02:16,019 --> 01:02:18,388
Oh, but did you?

1236
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:26,430
Ian! Look.

1237
01:02:27,866 --> 01:02:29,433
It's a raven.

1238
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,437
The clue on the menu said
Raven's Point.

1239
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:37,038
Yeah.
In the mountains.

1240
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,441
But maybe the puzzle
didn't mean the mountain.

1241
01:02:39,443 --> 01:02:42,379
Maybe it means follow
where the raven is pointing.

1242
01:02:46,116 --> 01:02:48,617
It's another raven.

1243
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:50,987
That one could be
pointing to another raven,

1244
01:02:50,989 --> 01:02:52,922
all the way to the gem.

1245
01:02:52,924 --> 01:02:55,290
I... I had us going
the wrong way.

1246
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:57,526
Well, I told you.
My gut knows where to go.

1247
01:02:57,528 --> 01:02:59,628
Don't you, boy?
Yes, you do.

1248
01:03:00,932 --> 01:03:02,364
- Huh.
- Come on, Dad.

1249
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:04,699
Guinevere will get us
to that raven in no time.

1250
01:03:10,574 --> 01:03:13,809
You guys...

1251
01:03:13,811 --> 01:03:15,410
...are in trouble,
big time.

1252
01:03:15,412 --> 01:03:16,913
No, no, no, Colt.
We found a spell.

1253
01:03:16,915 --> 01:03:19,982
If we finish it before sunset,
we'll get to see our father.

1254
01:03:19,984 --> 01:03:21,716
Ahh!

1255
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:23,318
Well, uh,
your mom told me

1256
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,922
there was some kind of
strange

1257
01:03:25,924 --> 01:03:27,355
family issue going on,

1258
01:03:27,357 --> 01:03:30,458
and this is
definitely strange.

1259
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:31,493
But no, dang it.

1260
01:03:31,495 --> 01:03:33,395
I'm not letting you
upset your mother anymore.

1261
01:03:33,397 --> 01:03:35,798
Now you get in the vehicle,
I'm escorting you home.

1262
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,999
No. No way.

1263
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:38,803
I'm giving you
to the count of three.

1264
01:03:40,972 --> 01:03:43,204
- Okay, we'll go.
- Ian.

1265
01:03:43,206 --> 01:03:45,475
He's a police officer.

1266
01:03:52,549 --> 01:03:53,682
What are you doing?

1267
01:03:53,684 --> 01:03:55,218
I don't know.

1268
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:57,789
Son of a...

1269
01:04:00,257 --> 01:04:02,591
I need backup.
Runaway van!

1270
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:06,628
Yeah! Iandore Lightfoot,
breaking the rules.

1271
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:08,396
I can't believe
I'm running from the cops.

1272
01:04:08,398 --> 01:04:09,664
You're not running
from the cops,

1273
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:12,100
you're running from
our mom's boyfriend.

1274
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:15,405
Okay, now you're running
from the cops.

1275
01:04:26,985 --> 01:04:28,450
Hold on!

1276
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:30,554
Whoa!

1277
01:04:33,992 --> 01:04:36,524
Yeah! Nice going,
Guinevere!

1278
01:04:52,342 --> 01:04:54,676
Oh, what did I do?
I shouldn't have driven away.

1279
01:04:54,678 --> 01:04:56,277
No, it was great.

1280
01:04:56,279 --> 01:04:57,880
Hey, block the road
with those boulders.

1281
01:04:57,882 --> 01:04:59,614
What? How?

1282
01:04:59,616 --> 01:05:00,548
Arcane Lightning.

1283
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:02,250
You said that's
the hardest spell.

1284
01:05:02,252 --> 01:05:03,418
You are ready.

1285
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,153
"To make lightning
strike with ease,

1286
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:06,789
"one must follow
all decrees."

1287
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:07,957
You have to
do everything.

1288
01:05:07,959 --> 01:05:09,058
Speak from
your heart's fire,

1289
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,528
trust yourself, focus,
all of it.

1290

<i>Voltar Thundasir.</i>

1291

<i>Voltar Thundasir.</i>

1292
01:05:18,803 --> 01:05:20,669
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

1293
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:30,046
I can't! I can't do it.

1294
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:35,820
We're not gonna see you, Dad.
And it's all my fault.

1295
01:05:55,338 --> 01:05:56,640
What are you doing?

1296
01:06:42,186 --> 01:06:43,755
What the...?

1297
01:06:52,964 --> 01:06:54,496
Barley.

1298
01:06:54,498 --> 01:06:57,300
She was just
a beat-up old van.

1299
01:06:58,368 --> 01:07:00,470
Come on, we gotta go.

1300
01:08:04,235 --> 01:08:05,435
Wait.

1301
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:21,884
Oh. You see that, Dad?

1302
01:08:21,886 --> 01:08:24,989
The apprentice has become
the master.

1303
01:08:27,091 --> 01:08:28,692
It looks like water.

1304
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:35,630
So, what's the,
uh, X mean?

1305
01:08:35,632 --> 01:08:38,901
On a quest,
an X only means one thing.

1306
01:08:38,903 --> 01:08:42,539
We go to the end of the water,
we'll find that Phoenix Gem.

1307
01:08:54,886 --> 01:08:55,953
Unicorns!

1308
01:09:14,738 --> 01:09:16,040
Whoa.

1309
01:09:18,309 --> 01:09:19,944
Cool.

1310
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:26,115
This water
could go on for miles.

1311
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:28,350
We don't have
that kinda time.

1312
01:09:28,352 --> 01:09:30,352
If we had something
to float on,

1313
01:09:30,354 --> 01:09:32,354
we could cast
a velocity spell on it,

1314
01:09:32,356 --> 01:09:34,356
fly down the tunnel
like a magic jet ski.

1315
01:09:34,358 --> 01:09:36,691
Well, there's not
much to float on.

1316
01:09:36,693 --> 01:09:38,459
Remember, on a quest,

1317
01:09:38,461 --> 01:09:41,098
you have to use
what you've got.

1318

<i>Magnora Gantuan!</i>

1319

Woo-hoo!

01:09:49,907 --> 01:09:51,508
<i>Accelior!</i>

1321
01:09:52,509 --> 01:09:53,842
Whoa!

1322
01:09:53,844 --> 01:09:56,378
This is
actually kinda cool.

1323
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:59,081
So, what other spells
do you know?

1324
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:01,549
Brace
yourself, young mage.

1325
01:10:01,551 --> 01:10:04,587
I know all there is
to know of magic.

1326
01:10:07,557 --> 01:10:08,991
Colt, we know
where the boys are going.

1327
01:10:08,993 --> 01:10:11,293
We just have to get to them
before they unleash the curse.

1328
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:13,929
- <i>The what?</i>
- Let's crush some curses!

1329
01:10:13,931 --> 01:10:15,563
The curse. The curse
that protects the gem

1330
01:10:15,565 --> 01:10:17,166
by turning into a rock
dragon or something.

1331
01:10:17,168 --> 01:10:18,233
<i>A what dragon?</i>

1332
01:10:18,235 --> 01:10:19,368
I can't explain it.

1333
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:21,103
I just know we have
to get to the boys fast.

1334
01:10:21,105 --> 01:10:23,707
Oh, we'll get to them fast.
We'll get to them so fast.

1335
01:10:24,241 --> 01:10:25,573
Oh!

1336
01:10:25,575 --> 01:10:28,509
Well, I almost had 'em,
but Ian, he just drove off.

1337
01:10:28,511 --> 01:10:30,312
- Huh. Good for him.
- <i>What?</i>

1338
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:32,047
No, I just mean
he's scared to drive.

1339
01:10:32,049 --> 01:10:34,183
Thinks something's gonna
come at him out of the...

1340
01:10:44,694 --> 01:10:46,462
Oh! I think
I stung my leg.

1341
01:10:46,464 --> 01:10:48,529
<i>Laurel, what happened?
What's goin' on?</i>

1342
01:10:48,531 --> 01:10:49,965
You almost
killed me, lady.

1343
01:10:49,967 --> 01:10:52,134
Are you okay?
Where did you come from?

1344
01:10:52,136 --> 01:10:53,435
You were
in our flight path.

1345
01:10:54,637 --> 01:10:56,537
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1346
01:10:56,539 --> 01:10:58,073
Oh, no. Our transport!

1347
01:10:58,075 --> 01:11:00,175
How are we going
to get to your sons now?

1348
01:11:00,177 --> 01:11:03,412
Come on, Pixie Dusters,
let's take to the skies.

1349
01:11:03,414 --> 01:11:05,648
- Yeah!
- I was born to fly!

1350
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:09,652
How do you feel about
exercising those wings?

1351
01:11:10,553 --> 01:11:11,756
Uh...

1352
01:11:14,091 --> 01:11:15,457
<i>Boombastia!</i>

1353
01:11:15,459 --> 01:11:17,895
- Ah, remember...
- Oh, right.

1354
01:11:18,329 --> 01:11:19,797
<i>Boombastia!</i>

1355
01:11:20,798 --> 01:11:21,964
Whoa!

1356
01:11:21,966 --> 01:11:24,900
Yeah! You're a natural!
Think fast.

1357
01:11:24,902 --> 01:11:26,168
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

1358
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:28,272
Yeah! Nice!

1359
01:11:29,306 --> 01:11:31,040
Careful how much boat
you're eating there, man,

1360
01:11:31,042 --> 01:11:33,142
we still gotta make it
to the end of the tunnel.

1361
01:11:33,144 --> 01:11:34,711
Yeah. Good point.

1362
01:11:37,948 --> 01:11:40,516
I can't believe
I'm this close

1363
01:11:40,518 --> 01:11:42,418
to actually
talking to Dad.

1364
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,519
You know what
I'm gonna ask him?

1365
01:11:43,521 --> 01:11:45,087
If he ever gave himself
a wizard name.

1366
01:11:45,089 --> 01:11:45,954
What?

1367
01:11:45,956 --> 01:11:47,022
Well, 'cause he was
into magic.

1368
01:11:47,024 --> 01:11:48,556
Lots of wizards
have cool names.

1369
01:11:48,558 --> 01:11:50,325
Alora the Majestic.

1370
01:11:50,327 --> 01:11:52,693
Birdar the Fanciful.

1371
01:11:52,695 --> 01:11:54,163
Anyway,
it'll just be nice

1372
01:11:54,165 --> 01:11:56,365
to have more than
four memories of him.

1373
01:11:56,367 --> 01:11:57,732
- Uh, three.
- Hmm?

1374
01:11:57,734 --> 01:11:59,334
You only have
three memories.

1375
01:11:59,336 --> 01:12:00,601
Oh, yeah.

1376
01:12:00,603 --> 01:12:01,904
Barley, do you have

1377
01:12:01,906 --> 01:12:03,872
another memory of Dad
you haven't told me?

1378
01:12:03,874 --> 01:12:07,376
No, it's just
not my favorite.

1379
01:12:07,378 --> 01:12:08,977
What do you mean?

1380
01:12:11,048 --> 01:12:13,916
When Dad was sick,

1381
01:12:13,918 --> 01:12:18,956
I was supposed to go in
and say goodbye to him.

1382
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:23,227
But he was hooked up
to all these tubes,

1383
01:12:24,694 --> 01:12:27,664
and he just didn't
look like himself.

1384
01:12:28,566 --> 01:12:30,733
I got scared,

1385
01:12:31,668 --> 01:12:33,871
and I didn't go in.

1386
01:12:36,841 --> 01:12:38,040
That's when I decided

1387
01:12:38,042 --> 01:12:41,178
I was never gonna be
scared ever again.

1388
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:48,786
Oh. Looks like
we're coming up on somethin'.

1389
01:12:58,628 --> 01:13:00,264
The final gauntlet.

1390
01:13:12,843 --> 01:13:15,678
The Phoenix Gem
is just on the other side.

1391
01:13:18,549 --> 01:13:21,550
Careful, there could be
booby traps.

1392
01:13:21,552 --> 01:13:23,552
This place is, like,
1,000 years old.

1393
01:13:23,554 --> 01:13:24,989
There's no way
there could be...

1394
01:13:31,595 --> 01:13:33,030
Oh, no.

1395
01:13:34,131 --> 01:13:35,698
It can't be.

1396
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:39,270
A gelatinous cube!

1397
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:46,842
Run!

1398
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:47,943
Whoa! Wait!
It's some kind of puzzle.

1399
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:49,311
We gotta
figure it out before...

1400
01:13:49,313 --> 01:13:50,745
No time.
Grab a shield.

1401
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:05,196
- Jump! Trust me!
- What?

1402
01:14:07,298 --> 01:14:08,399
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

1403
01:14:11,669 --> 01:14:12,870
Ow.

1404
01:14:14,505 --> 01:14:15,705
Ian.

1405
01:14:25,683 --> 01:14:27,049
Whew!

1406
01:14:27,051 --> 01:14:29,286
Don't step on that.

1407
01:14:31,922 --> 01:14:34,191
I didn't touch it.

1408
01:14:38,195 --> 01:14:39,296
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

1409
01:14:47,004 --> 01:14:49,504
The tile down there has the
same shape as the opening.

1410
01:14:49,506 --> 01:14:50,939
Maybe we were supposed
to step on it?

1411
01:14:50,941 --> 01:14:52,207
- What?
- I got it.

1412
01:14:52,209 --> 01:14:53,210
No, Barley!

1413
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:01,885
Oh! It's working!

1414
01:15:04,855 --> 01:15:07,823
It's impossible.

1415
01:15:07,825 --> 01:15:10,492
No one can hold
their breath that long.

1416
01:15:43,794 --> 01:15:45,294
We made it!

1417
01:15:45,296 --> 01:15:46,328
Oh.

1418
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:49,331
The Phoenix Gem
awaits beyond this door.

1419
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:50,565
Shall we?

1420
01:15:50,567 --> 01:15:52,234
We certainly shall!

1421
01:15:52,236 --> 01:15:54,136
Dad, we have followed
the quest,

1422
01:15:54,138 --> 01:15:57,308
and it has led us
to our victory!

1423
01:16:16,393 --> 01:16:17,959
We're back home.

1424
01:16:17,961 --> 01:16:20,996
No, that doesn't make sense.
We took the Path of Peril.

1425
01:16:20,998 --> 01:16:22,097
We followed the ravens,

1426
01:16:22,099 --> 01:16:24,099
we went to the end
of the water...

1427
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:26,735
Unless the X meant
stay away from the water.

1428
01:16:26,737 --> 01:16:28,805
Or it could be,
like, a campfire?

1429
01:16:28,807 --> 01:16:30,172
It's okay.
We can figure this out.

1430
01:16:30,174 --> 01:16:32,874
Figure out what?
We're back where we started.

1431
01:16:32,876 --> 01:16:34,376
I mean, it has to be here.
There was a gauntlet.

1432
01:16:34,378 --> 01:16:36,178
I mean, unless that
gauntlet was for,

1433
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:38,046
coincidentally,
some different quest.

1434
01:16:38,048 --> 01:16:39,314
- That's a possibility.
- What?

1435
01:16:39,316 --> 01:16:42,119
No, no, no. This has to be
where the Phoenix Gem is.

1436
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,221
I followed my gut.

1437
01:16:44,888 --> 01:16:47,723
- Oh, no.
- What?

1438
01:16:47,725 --> 01:16:49,826
The gem is
in the mountain.

1439
01:16:49,828 --> 01:16:51,693
The mountain
we could have been to

1440
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:53,695
hours ago
if we just...

1441
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,263
If we just stayed
on the expressway.

1442
01:16:55,265 --> 01:16:57,099
No, the expressway
is too obvious.

1443
01:16:57,101 --> 01:16:58,233
You can never take
the obvious...

1444
01:16:58,235 --> 01:17:00,803
If I hadn't listened
to you! Okay?

1445
01:17:00,805 --> 01:17:02,237
I can't believe this.

1446
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,740
You act like you know
what you're doing,

1447
01:17:04,742 --> 01:17:06,108
but you don't
have a clue,

1448
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:09,244
and that's because
you are a screwup.

1449
01:17:09,246 --> 01:17:10,813
And now you've
screwed up my chance

1450
01:17:10,815 --> 01:17:12,616
to have the one thing
I never had!

1451
01:17:19,056 --> 01:17:20,255
Where are you going?

1452
01:17:20,257 --> 01:17:23,060
To spend what little time
we have left with Dad.

1453
01:17:24,328 --> 01:17:26,328
Ian, wait!

1454
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:29,064
We can still find
the Phoenix Gem.

1455
01:17:29,066 --> 01:17:31,301
We just have to
keep lookin'.

1456
01:17:32,202 --> 01:17:33,570
Ian!

1457
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:35,506
Ian!

1458
01:17:47,184 --> 01:17:48,417
No, Dad.

1459
01:17:48,419 --> 01:17:49,553
He's not here.

1460
01:18:01,432 --> 01:18:04,001
Come on. Where is it?

1461
01:18:04,668 --> 01:18:06,069
Follow the water.

1462
01:18:12,777 --> 01:18:13,843
Ugh...

1463
01:18:13,845 --> 01:18:15,878
All right. Come on,
out of the fountain.

1464
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,046
No, I'm looking
for an ancient gem.

1465
01:18:18,048 --> 01:18:20,015
Oh, yeah, we know.
"The old days."

1466
01:18:20,017 --> 01:18:21,851
No! Stop! Please! No!

1467
01:18:21,853 --> 01:18:23,118
Okay, ow, okay!

1468
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,187
Okay. I'm leaving.

1469
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:28,056
- Hey!
- Come on!

1470
01:18:28,058 --> 01:18:31,426
Can someone call the cops?
We got the history buff again.

1471
01:18:58,689 --> 01:19:00,489
- <i>I can't do this.</i>
- <i>Yes, you can.</i>

1472
01:19:00,491 --> 01:19:03,360
- I'm not ready!
- You'll never be ready. Merge!

1473
01:19:05,395 --> 01:19:06,597
<i>Nice job!</i>

1474
01:19:14,973 --> 01:19:17,541
- Think fast.
- <i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

1475
01:19:53,011 --> 01:19:55,043
Woo-hoo!

1476
01:19:55,045 --> 01:19:56,578
<i>I know
you're stronger than that.</i>

1477
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:59,581
<i>My little brother
has the magic gift.</i>

1478
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:00,883
<i>Don't hold back.</i>

1479
01:20:00,885 --> 01:20:02,719
<i>Hey. You can do this.</i>

1480
01:20:29,513 --> 01:20:32,649
Okay, come on.
Get down right now.

1481
01:20:55,305 --> 01:20:57,708
Yeah! Yeah!

1482
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:04,981
Barley!

1483
01:21:04,983 --> 01:21:06,483
Ian! Look!

1484
01:21:10,021 --> 01:21:11,254
Behind you!

1485
01:21:14,491 --> 01:21:16,126
It's a curse.

1486
01:22:09,981 --> 01:22:11,314
Barley, run!

1487
01:22:15,285 --> 01:22:17,587
What do you want?
The gem?

1488
01:22:18,655 --> 01:22:19,757
Fine, take it!

1489
01:22:23,861 --> 01:22:24,862
Ha-ha!

1490
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:47,983
The Manticore!

1491
01:22:47,985 --> 01:22:49,151
Mom?

1492
01:22:49,153 --> 01:22:51,386
It's okay, boys,
we'll take care...

1493
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:53,856
Whoa... You're tilting!
You're tilting!

1494
01:22:53,858 --> 01:22:56,125
- Mom!
- Go see your father!

1495
01:22:56,127 --> 01:22:59,095
It's okay! If they stab
the beast's core

1496
01:22:59,097 --> 01:23:01,229
with that sword,
the curse will be broken.

1497
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:02,499
Come on!

1498
01:23:30,862 --> 01:23:33,796
Barley, what I said before...
I am so sorry.

1499
01:23:33,798 --> 01:23:35,867
There's no time.
The sun's about to set.

1500
01:23:37,667 --> 01:23:39,969
Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

1501
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:43,775
Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth!

1502
01:23:46,878 --> 01:23:48,813
Time to crush a curse!

1503
01:23:55,619 --> 01:23:57,587
Ooh, my back.

1504
01:24:02,894 --> 01:24:04,594
I am a mighty warrior.

1505
01:24:14,437 --> 01:24:17,041
I am a mighty warrior!

1506
01:24:23,114 --> 01:24:25,682
Hurry! I can't
hold this for long!

1507
01:24:31,889 --> 01:24:34,091
No! No, no, no! Barley!

1508
01:24:58,115 --> 01:25:00,117
Boys, it's coming back!

1509
01:25:05,589 --> 01:25:06,922
I'll go distract it.

1510
01:25:06,924 --> 01:25:08,057
What? No!

1511
01:25:08,059 --> 01:25:09,490
If you do that,
you'll miss Dad.

1512
01:25:09,492 --> 01:25:12,864
It's okay.
Say hi to Dad for me.

1513
01:25:14,232 --> 01:25:17,333
- No. You go and say goodbye.
- What?

1514
01:25:17,335 --> 01:25:19,802
I had someone
who looked out for me.

1515
01:25:19,804 --> 01:25:21,736
Someone who
pushed me to be

1516
01:25:21,738 --> 01:25:24,206
more than I ever
thought I could be.

1517
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:26,010
I never had a dad,

1518
01:25:26,978 --> 01:25:28,846
but I always had you.

1519
01:25:37,889 --> 01:25:39,556
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia!</i>

1520
01:25:41,158 --> 01:25:42,592
<i>Boombastia!</i>

1521
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:53,369
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

1522
01:26:08,286 --> 01:26:09,486
No!

1523
01:26:17,361 --> 01:26:18,561
No! No, no, no!

1524
01:26:21,132 --> 01:26:21,997
Use what I have.

1525
01:26:21,999 --> 01:26:24,366
Uh, what do I have?
I have nothing.

1526
01:26:24,368 --> 01:26:27,269
Splinter.
Magic in every fiber.

1527
01:26:27,271 --> 01:26:29,439
<i>Magnora Gantuan!</i>

1528
01:26:31,142 --> 01:26:34,611
No!
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

1529
01:26:41,385 --> 01:26:42,585
Ian!

1530
01:26:43,321 --> 01:26:44,688
<i>Accelior!</i>

1531
01:27:10,114 --> 01:27:11,514
Ian!

1532
01:29:00,057 --> 01:29:01,325
What did he say?

1533
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:05,894
He said he always thought
his wizard name

1534
01:29:05,896 --> 01:29:09,164
would be
Wilden the Whimsical.

1535
01:29:09,166 --> 01:29:12,167
Wow. That's really terrible.

1536
01:29:12,169 --> 01:29:13,936
I know.

1537
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,475
He also said
he's very proud

1538
01:29:19,477 --> 01:29:22,712
of the person
you grew up to be.

1539
01:29:23,613 --> 01:29:27,918
Well, I owe an awful
lot of that to you.

1540
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,089
He kinda
said that, too.

1541
01:29:34,792 --> 01:29:38,095
Oh, and he told me
to give you this.

1542
01:30:06,857 --> 01:30:10,161
<i>Long ago,
the world was full of wonder.</i>

1543
01:30:12,662 --> 01:30:16,064
<i>It was adventurous,
exciting,</i>

1544
01:30:16,066 --> 01:30:19,635
<i>and best of all,
there was magic.</i>

1545
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:24,973
Whoa! Watch it!

1546
01:30:24,975 --> 01:30:28,010
Bullseye!

1547
01:30:28,012 --> 01:30:30,345
And then, with a slash
of my mighty sword,

1548
01:30:30,347 --> 01:30:33,450
I severed the beast's wings
from its wretched body!

1549
01:30:34,585 --> 01:30:37,886
Okay, who wants cake?

1550
01:30:40,991 --> 01:30:44,092
And I think, with a little
bit of magic in your life,

1551
01:30:44,094 --> 01:30:46,028
you can do
almost anything.

1552
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:48,297
Is that how you put the
school back together?

1553
01:30:48,299 --> 01:30:49,231
Uh, yes.

1554
01:30:49,233 --> 01:30:50,666
Is that also
how you destroyed

1555
01:30:50,668 --> 01:30:52,167
the school
in the first place?

1556
01:30:52,169 --> 01:30:53,802
Uh, also yes.

1557
01:30:55,573 --> 01:30:57,940
- Hey, that was great.
- Thanks.

1558
01:30:57,942 --> 01:31:00,844
- You going to the park later?
- Yeah! See you there.

1559
01:31:05,748 --> 01:31:07,416
Mom! Oof!

1560
01:31:09,653 --> 01:31:10,919
Blazey, down!

1561
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:12,888
Who's a good dragon?
Who's a good dragon?

1562
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:14,289
So, how was school?

1563
01:31:14,291 --> 01:31:15,723
It was really good.

1564
01:31:15,725 --> 01:31:16,892
Well, all right.

1565
01:31:16,894 --> 01:31:18,860
Hey, there he is.
You workin' hard?

1566
01:31:18,862 --> 01:31:21,296
No, hardly workin'.

1567
01:31:21,298 --> 01:31:24,933
Oh, I gotta go. I'm meeting
the Manticore for a night out.

1568
01:31:24,935 --> 01:31:26,802
<i>We got
a one-one-three in progress.</i>

1569
01:31:26,804 --> 01:31:28,036
<i>All units report.</i>

1570
01:31:28,038 --> 01:31:30,305
Duty calls.
Time to hit the trails.

1571
01:31:30,307 --> 01:31:31,640
Oh, you forgot
your keys!

1572
01:31:31,642 --> 01:31:35,244
Don't need 'em.
I was born to run.

1573
01:31:35,246 --> 01:31:36,313
Hyah!

1574
01:31:40,751 --> 01:31:41,952
Oh!

1575
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,955
Ah.

1576
01:31:46,323 --> 01:31:47,756
So, how's
the new van?

1577
01:31:47,758 --> 01:31:50,058
Oh. Guinevere the Second
is great.

1578
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:52,794
I've almost got enough saved
up for a sweet paint job.

1579
01:31:52,796 --> 01:31:54,963
- No, please don't.
- Why not?

1580
01:31:54,965 --> 01:31:57,534
Because I already
took care of it.

1581
01:31:58,802 --> 01:32:01,105
Oh, yeah!

1582
01:32:02,873 --> 01:32:04,873
Okay, best way
to the park is to take

1583
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:07,843
a little something
called the Road of Ruin.

1584
