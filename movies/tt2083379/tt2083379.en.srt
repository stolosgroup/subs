<i>- Yeah, what do you</i>
<i>want me to say, bruce?</i>

3
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,526
<i>He broke into our offices</i>

Accessed our files,
our computers.

<i>Do we know what?</i>

6
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,400
well, we could
assume everything.

7
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,402
Well, this is
a major liability.

8
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:45,537
You're telling me.
Renaldo, now!

9
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,306
- Okay okay.
- <i>Vamos, vamos. </i>Let's go.

10
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:50,709
- <i>Okay.</i>
<i>- Does the army know who he is?</i>

11
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:54,146
Oh yeah.
Francisco francis.

12
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,851
Come on, renaldo.
Come on.

13
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,652
Just keep walking
to the car, okay?

14
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,387
- Just walk to the car.
- <i>Renaldo!</i>

15
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,491
- Mama! Mama!
- No, renaldo!

16
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,559
- <i>Renaldo!</i>

17
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,297
- Mama! Mama!

18
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,333
<i>No no no no no no no!</i>

19
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,372
- No no no no no no.

20
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,279
She's dead, renaldo.
Come on, come on, come on.

21
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,715
- <i>Vamos vamos vamos.</i>
<i>- no. No. No!</i>

22
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,784
No! Mama! No!

23
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,520
- Mama.
- Come on,
come on, come on.

24
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:37,789
Come on, come on,
get inside. Come on.

25
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,698
- Let me out!

26
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,336
No! No.
No. No!

27
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,505
I don't care
what general aguila's
doing right now!

28
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,641
<i>I want you to put him</i>
<i>on the phone now!</i>

29
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,943
Let me out right now!
Let me out!

30
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,645
It's tony green
from clearbec!

31
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,647
<i>- let me out of this car!</i>

32
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,696
- <i>Por favor! Por favor!</i>

33
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,671
- Ah!

34
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,547
Jesus christ.

35
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,623
<i>Did you ever hear about</i>
<i>the great transformation?</i>

36
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,959
<i>Yeah, I think. What was</i>
<i>that again?</i>

37
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,495
<i>It started about</i>
<i>300 years ago in England...</i>

38
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,831
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>...With the turning</i>
<i>of public lands</i>

39
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,733
<i>Into private property.</i>

40
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,468
<i>And it changed</i>
<i>the way we think,</i>

41
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,638
<i>The way we view time</i>
<i>and land and water</i>

42
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,574
- <i>And even people.</i>
<i>It turned them into units...</i>

43
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,477
<i>...Commodities</i>
<i>to be bought and sold,</i>

44
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,747
- <i>And therefore exploited.</i>
<i>- Yeah, but what is</i>
<i>bought and sold is constant.</i>

45
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,016
- <i>That's never gonna change.</i>
<i>- You know what, sarah?</i>

46
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,752
That is absolutely incorrect.
Society needs to approve

47
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,854
<i>Of the things to be turned</i>
<i>into commodities</i>

48
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,589
<i>Before they can</i>
<i>be bought or sold.</i>

49
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,692
People can be bought
or sold, correct?
That did happen.

50
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:24,696
As horrific and diabolical
as that may sound,
it's a fact.

51
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,633
Yeah, and still slavery happens
<i>in some countries today.</i>

52
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,301
<i>Regrettably true.</i>

53
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,670
<i>But why is it</i>
<i>that in western society,</i>

54
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,539
- <i>We no longer</i>
<i>buy or sell people?</i>
<i>- Because it's immoral</i>

55
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,409
- <i>And it's wrong</i>
<i>in all aspects.</i>

56
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,678
<i>Well, is it wrong</i>
<i>to sell water?</i>

57
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,682
<i>- What about air?</i>
<i>Would it be wrong to sell air?</i>

58
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:46,318
<i>Air. Come on, man.</i>
<i>You can't sell air.</i>

59
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,821
- <i>No?</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Well, what if</i>
<i>you can't afford it, hmm?</i>

60
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,991
<i>There's lots of people</i>
<i>all around the world that</i>
<i>can't afford much water.</i>

61
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,661
- <i>And what happens?</i>
<i>-</i> <i>I don't know.</i>

62
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:58,897
<i>They die. Is it</i>
<i>so far-fetched, sarah?</i>

63
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,066
You can sell water,
but you can't sell air?

64
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,602
Think about it.
I'll take the next caller.

65
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,638
Hello, this is jack begosian.
You're on the air.

66
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,641
- <i>The name's charlie.</i>
<i>- Hello, charlie. Good morning.</i>

67
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,077
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>I want to know when we're</i>

68
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,314
- <i>Gonna talk</i>
<i>about the</i> real <i>truth.</i>
<i>- What truth is that, charlie?</i>

69
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,916
<i>About the aliens</i>
<i>taking over the white house.</i>

70
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,918
The aliens taking over
the white house?

71
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,853
<i>You know</i>
<i>you know it, jack.</i>

72
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,058
You mean
illegal aliens, charlie?

73
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,926
<i>No, you're making light.</i>

74
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,696
<i>Extraterrestrial beings</i>
<i>are a real threat</i>

75
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:33,031
- <i>To our way of life, jack.</i>
<i>- only if</i>
<i>you exchange</i>

76
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,966
Bodily fluids
with them, charlie.

77
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,835
I'm not. Are you?

78
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,705
- <i>no.</i>
<i>- Then we're doing our part.</i>

79
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:42,674
Thanks for calling.
Last call.

80
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,676
Hi, this is jack begosian.
You're on the air.

81
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,611
<i>Hey, man.</i>
<i>It's van from oakland.</i>

82
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,380
Hello, van from oakland,
california.

83
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,382
- Thanks for the call.
- <i>Question, jack.</i>

84
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:52,417
- Yes?
- <i>Why did you quit?</i>

85
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,453
Why did I quit what?

86
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,388
<i>The agency, dude.</i>

87
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,357
- <i>Everybody knows.</i>

88
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,927
- Why did I quit?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

89
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,698
<i>Well, van, uh,</i>

90
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,636
<i>When you can't</i>
<i>affect change from within--</i>

91
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,405
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>positive change--</i>

92
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,807
You have an obligation,
if you're at all conscious,

93
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,510
To get out
and try other things.

94
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,046
- That's what I'm doing.
- <i>Other things?</i>

95
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,449
- <i>You mean ways</i>
<i>to affect change?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

96
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:27,386
<i>You think people want</i>
<i>to hear the truth, man,</i>
<i>but they don't.</i>

97
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,388
<i>They want sound bites,</i>
<i>celebrity gossip,</i>

98
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,956
<i>Scandal. You know.</i>

99
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,024
<i>This is true.</i>

100
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,160
<i>The news doesn't have</i>
<i>to be truthful anymore,</i>

101
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,095
- <i>Just entertaining.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Nice!</i>

102
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,930
<i>You know,</i>
<i>our values are eroding.</i>

103
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,167
<i>Our morals--</i>
<i>what are we doing here, man?</i>

104
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,903
<i>The real question is</i>
<i>"what are we really after?"</i>

105
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,906
<i>Is there some ultimate end,</i>

106
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,742
<i>Or are we just into</i>
<i>some sort of endless pursuit</i>

107
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,678
- <i>Of nothing more</i>
<i>than pleasure?</i>
<i>-</i> <i>What do you think?</i>

108
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,047
<i>I believe there's meaning</i>
<i>to it, to our lives.</i>

109
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,450
- <i>That's what I believe.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Meaning?</i>

110
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,585
- <i>Like what?</i>
<i>-</i> <i>I haven't learned</i>
<i>that answer yet.</i>

111
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,954
<i>Well, keep up the good work</i>
<i>until they shut you down, dude.</i>

112
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,090
<i>Oh, they're not gonna</i>
<i>shut me down, van.</i>

113
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,726
<i>Oh yeah, they will.</i>
<i>The cia's suing you, right?</i>

114
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,095
Uh, rumors.

115
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,597
And I hate
to break it to you,

116
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,801
- But the c.I.A. Does not sue.
- <i>What do they do then?</i>

117
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,769
<i>They have</i>
<i>several other options.</i>

118
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,574
<i>But I'd welcome</i>
<i>my day in court.</i>
<i>Do you think they would?</i>

119
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,544
<i>Think about it.</i>
<i>Thanks for the call.</i>

120
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,115
One last thought.

121
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,588
Sometimes it seems
like a bleak picture,

122
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,493
But it really isn't,
because the basic nature
of mankind is good.

123
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,496
<i>And if you don't</i>
<i>believe me,</i>

124
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:46,998
<i>Go on the subway</i>
<i>or on the bus at rush hour</i>

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,734
<i>And take a good look around,</i>
<i>look at the people.</i>

126
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,704
Black, brown,
red, yellow, white.

127
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,073
<i>You're all coming home</i>

128
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,942
<i>From an honest day's work.</i>

129
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,178
And they don't do it
for the money,

130
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,849
Because their jobs are
paying them very little.

131
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,786
<i>But they do it</i>
<i>for their families.</i>

132
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,991
They do it
for the ones they love.

133
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,926
<i>And you can see it.</i>

134
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,896
<i>And you can feel it.</i>

135
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,898
<i>You can see it</i>
<i>in their tiredness,</i>

136
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,600
<i>In their resignation</i>

137
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,735
<i>And you can feel it</i>
<i>in their commitment--</i>

138
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,171
<i>Their commitment</i>
<i>to their families.</i>

139
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,977
<i>This is jack begosian.</i>
<i>Good night. Good morning.</i>

140
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:19,157
And can you make reservations
for clare van huysen and I

141
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,926
At that new
french restaurant for two?

142
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,861
- You know the one.
- <i>At 2:00?</i>

143
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:26,031
00.

144
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:29,034
<i>But the ribbon-cutting</i>
<i>ceremony at the hospital</i>
<i>won't be over by then.</i>

145
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,970
- Oh, it won't?
- <i>No.</i>

146
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,972
<i>I'll make it two</i>
<i>00.</i>

147
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,708
- Okay, perfect. Thank you.

148
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,812
<i>So, yes, clearbec</i>
<i>is very pleased</i>

149
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,815
To have funded this new wing
dedicated to children's
cancer research.

150
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,617
And in addition
to this wing,

151
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,586
Clearbec has also funded
a hospice

152
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:51,022
<i>For the out-of-town parents,</i>
<i>which will allow them</i>

153
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:54,059
Extended stays with the children
during ongoing treatment.

154
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,860
<i>So thank you, everyone.</i>

155
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,363
To our future--
the children.

156
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:01,700
<i>Miss swinton, miss swinton,</i>
<i>how much is clearbec paying</i>

157
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,903
To the south african government
<i>to privatize the water system?</i>

158
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:08,607
Miss swinton!
My message is in the car.
Just listen to it.

159
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,376
- Miss swinton.
Miss swinton, stop!

160
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:12,944
Back!

161
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:20,085
Your company killed my family,
killed my entire town.

162
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,954
Poisoned them,
then shot the survivors.

163
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,789
You will remember them.

164
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,230
<i>Oh my god.</i>

165
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:35,066
<i>I presume I have your</i>
<i>attention now, miss swinton.</i>

166
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,335
- <i>My country and many others</i>
<i>in south america...</i>

167
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,805
<i>...Are in the war</i>
<i>for water rights.</i>
<i>Who knows of this?</i>

168
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,275
<i>Few, as it is not happening</i>
<i>in new orleans or new york.</i>

169
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:48,079
<i>The noise you hear</i>
<i>is gunfire.</i>

170
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,849
<i>Children, women and men</i>
<i>are being gunned down</i>

171
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,717
- <i>Outside tayca, ecuador.</i>

172
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:56,187
<i>I recorded it.</i>
<i>I saw it.</i>

173
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,824
<i>Inagua, a local subsidiary</i>
<i>of clearbec,</i>

174
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,994
<i>Your family's company,</i>
<i>installed a water-</i>
<i>purification system</i>

175
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,797
<i>For tayca</i>
<i>and the surrounding area.</i>

176
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,699
<i>The system did not purify,</i>

177
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,834
<i>Just the opposite.</i>

178
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,004
<i>A very bad form of typhus</i>
<i>emerged in the town.</i>

179
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,179
<i>Francisco francis broke</i>
<i>into the inagua office.</i>

180
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,049
<i>Clearbec's own report</i>
<i>stated what was happening</i>

181
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,985
- <i>And how they were involved.</i>

182
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,894
Get down.
Get down.

183
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,098
<i>And the army,</i>
<i>clearbec's partner in ecuador,</i>

184
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,366
<i>Moved into my town</i>
<i>and quarantined the area.</i>

185
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:21,005
<i>They had orders</i>
<i>to find francis and kill</i>
<i>any residents</i>

186
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,808
- <i>That were</i>
<i>trying to get out.</i>

187
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,002
<i>No one knew what to do</i>
<i>with the sick and the dying.</i>

188
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,071
<i>Then the soldiers</i>
<i>began to get sick.</i>

189
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,408
<i>They began</i>
<i>to execute everyone.</i>

190
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,067
Okay, let's go.

191
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,092
<i>Question, jack.</i>
<i>Why'd you quit?</i>

192
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,998
I thought I answered
that question already.

193
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,068
<i>Yeah, but I want</i>
<i>the real reason.</i>

194
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,411
<i>I stopped</i>
<i>believing in lies.</i>

195
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,482
<i>Including my own.</i>

196
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,195
<i>Clearbec has provided you</i>
<i>quality water products</i>

197
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,130
<i>For over 50 years.</i>

198
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,399
<i>Clearbec stands</i>
<i>for integrity,</i>

199
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,501
<i>Value, quality.</i>

200
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,504
<i>Your body is</i>
<i>over 70% water.</i>

201
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,539
<i>Over 70%.</i>

202
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,942
<i>You deserve</i>
<i>the best water possible.</i>

203
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,257
<i>The kid was my assistant</i>
<i>last summer.</i>

204
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,093
<i>- okay? How the hell did</i>
<i>he get to toronto?</i>

205
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,629
Whatever.
He just blew his brains out

206
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,132
In front of my sister
at a press conference, tony.

207
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:37,268
Okay, bruce, you should
never have authorized

208
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,437
- The use of force here.
- I didn't.

209
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,406
- <i>Then who did?</i>
<i>- General aguila.</i>

210
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,442
- He said he had no choice.
- <i>That's bullshit!</i>

211
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,345
I saw it happen.
It was murder, bruce.

212
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:50,648
Aguila is a general
for the ecuadorian army.

213
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,084
<i>He's not an officer</i>
<i>or an employee of clearbec.</i>

214
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,486
<i>We</i> are not guilty
of anything.

215
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:59,190
I'm saddened
and disgusted as to what
happened down there,

216
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,526
- <i>But we are not to blame.</i>
<i>- Yeah, so? Then what?</i>

217
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,494
- Damage control.
- <i>Damage control?</i>

218
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,330
- Yes.
- Do you understand

219
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,332
That it was more
than just a few villagers?

220
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,267
<i>It was hundreds</i>
<i>of people, bruce!</i>

221
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,702
Even though
clearbec is innocent,

222
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,603
We can't let
our south african partners

223
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,139
<i>Find out</i>
<i>what really happened</i>
<i>down there, all right?</i>

224
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,975
- It's best for the company.

225
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,544
Tony, I'll call you back.

226
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,312
- <i>Call me back!</i>

227
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,482
How are you?

228
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,284
Oh jesus,
are you all right?

229
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,355
What happened in ecuador?

230
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,258
I am so sorry
you had to see that.

231
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,663
We pulled
a file on that kid.
He was a nutcase.

232
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,367
He was working
for an anti-government
rag magazine.

233
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,569
He infiltrated
our ecuadorian offices.

234
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,205
<i>I listened to a tape</i>
<i>he left for me.</i>

235
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,508
- A tape?
- What did we do down there?

236
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:56,180
- We have interests in ecuador.
You know that.
- Interests?

237
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,616
- Yes.
- A boy doesn't...

238
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,587
Blow his head off
over interests.

239
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,023
We're an international
company.

240
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,225
We can't <i>possibly</i> make

241
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:10,228
Everyone happy <i>all</i> the time.
It gets complicated.

242
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,263
It's <i>best</i> you don't
get involved.

243
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,133
Don't get involved
in <i>our</i> own company?

244
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:19,570
The company
that our father built?

245
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,639
Morgan, you do lunches.

246
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,475
You do ribbon cuttings.
You do fundraisers.

247
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,811
You do bad marriages.

248
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,217
Wow.

249
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,624
All right, I'm sorry.

250
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,427
You should go home,

251
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,063
Clean yourself up.
Okay?

252
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,666
- I'm sorry.

253
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,451
What happened
in ecuador needs
to be contained, doug.

254
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,453
Believe me, bruce,
I know that.

255
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:11,622
None of these events
can be traced back
to clearbec

256
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,691
- At any cost.
- Right.

257
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,527
Now tony was shaken up,
but I think he will
be all right.

258
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,130
But from what
I just heard,

259
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,599
I'm afraid your sister
might be a problem.

260
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,367
What are you
suggesting?

261
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:26,104
Morgan needs
to be deflected.

262
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,508
Goldman brothers, line two.
You gotta take it.

263
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,647
<i>- bobby, how are you?</i>

264
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,749
How the hell
do you expect me
to get this closed?

265
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,485
Have you seen what's
coming about clearbec

266
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,186
Since that kid
blew his brains out?

267
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,288
That kid was
a nut job, robert.

268
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,124
The press is
all over it, bruce.

269
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,192
It's completely killing
the financing.

270
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,161
We have to close
by the end of next week,

271
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:53,131
Otherwise
south africa pulls out.
That's the scheduled close.

272
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,200
You want to be closed
by the end of next week,
then our fees just doubled.

273
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,336
Does that mean we're not
playing squash on Saturday?

274
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,837
<i>You'll have</i>
<i>a new deal memo in an hour.</i>

275
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,140
<i>I want it signed</i>
<i>and executed back today.</i>

276
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:05,143
- Fine.
- <i>And if anything else</i>
<i>like this happens, bruce,</i>

277
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,578
We're out of this deal.

278
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,217
- Bye-bye.

279
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,211
<i>I have no idea</i>
<i>how many were killed.</i>

280
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,846
<i>Hundreds.</i>

281
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,854
- <i>They burned</i>
<i>the bodies, the evidence.</i>

282
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,689
<i>But some got away.</i>

283
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,565
<i>I did.</i>
<i>Were they infected?</i>
<i>Did they survive?</i>

284
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,367
- <i>I don't know.</i>

285
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,941
<i>I pray that francisco francis</i>
<i>made it out.</i>

286
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,978
<i>Francis is a great man.</i>

287
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,514
<i>They jail him, beat him,</i>
<i>try to kill him,</i>

288
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:19,784
- <i>But he keeps rising up.</i>
<i>- Shh. Shh.</i>

289
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,555
<i>He is witness</i>
<i>to what happened.</i>

290
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,757
<i>He will tell the truth.</i>

291
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,569
<i>If he is alive,</i>
<i>you must help him.</i>

292
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,771
<i>May god have mercy</i>
<i>on you if you don't.</i>

293
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,680
<i>Jason, I made you</i>
<i>your favorite breakfast.</i>

294
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:53,317
If you're not gonna eat it,
then you might as well
go to your room.

295
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,325
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

296
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,730
He's not eating,
just staring
at the clock.

297
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:08,499
- What's wrong
with the clock?
- Nothing.

298
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,870
- Since when is he not eating?

299
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,672
A couple of days.

300
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,407
How come
you haven't told me?

301
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:19,010
I've been trying to.

302
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,850
You don't know.
He's so frustrating.

303
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,785
I mean...

304
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,654
Karen.

305
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,726
You were the one
who wanted to move
out here, off the grid...

306
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:41,032
- I know.
- ...And deal with his issues.

307
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,502
I can't do it
by myself.

308
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,606
You are not by yourself.

309
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:50,508
Yes, I am.

310
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:56,580
You're here,
but you're not here.

311
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,954
I feel it.

312
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,957
And jason sure
as hell feels it

313
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:10,094
- More than I do.
- I know.

314
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,598
You need to spend
some time with him.

315
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,604
Quality time.

316
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,879
Jack.

317
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,684
Just be with him,

318
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,687
Spend more time
with your son.

319
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,522
<i>Please.</i>

320
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,448
<i>Bruce, listen to me.</i>

321
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,751
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>about this, okay? Please.</i>

322
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:08,919
<i>We gotta help these people.</i>
<i>We can't just leave them.</i>

323
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,455
<i>We have to call in</i>
<i>world health.</i>

324
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,758
<i>They can contain</i>
<i>the typhus.</i>

325
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,893
Tony, if we call in
the w.H.O.,

326
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,995
That's like sending out
a press release

327
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,498
Saying that clearbec
caused the typhus outbreak.

328
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,166
And if that happens,
the government of south africa

329
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,701
Will pull out
of the deal for sure.

330
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,936
You think
the south african deal

331
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:29,039
- Justifies what aguila did?
- No, I don't,

332
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,075
But he said
it was a disaster
beyond imagination,

333
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,744
That what he did was
the only way to contain
the typhus outbreak.

334
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,014
- And you believe him, right?
- We have a company to run.

335
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,716
I have shareholders
to report to.

336
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:40,718
<i>Now we have to do</i>
<i>the right thing.</i>

337
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,621
What the hell happened
to our filtration system
down there?

338
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:46,857
The river flooded, okay?
That's what happened.

339
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:50,694
- But we've tested
for that extensively.
- The sewers backed up

340
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:53,164
And then rats were
infesting the town.

341
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,933
The market will crucify us
if this ever gets out.

342
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,002
I don't know, man.
I don't know. I don't--

343
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:00,538
I don't know anymore.
Just-- you tell me.

344
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,441
- What's the official story?
- The truth.

345
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,146
He broke into
our filtration plant
and sabotaged the system.

346
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,215
That's what caused
the typhus outbreak.

347
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:12,950
The army came in
to apprehend him.

348
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,653
Francis and his men fired back.
The army returned fire.

349
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,755
There were casualties, period.
End of story.

350
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,657
<i>Have they gotten</i>
<i>to francis yet?</i>

351
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,792
The guy's hiding up
in the mountains somewhere.

352
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,930
All right, tony. You do
whatever you can to help
those people down there,

353
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:28,499
But <i>plea</i>keep
a lid on it.

354
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,118
You wanna go help me
stack some firewood?

355
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,757
Come on.

356
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,263
I heard you crying
last night, mommy.

357
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,799
Why were you crying?

358
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:04,602
Um, because...

359
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:07,137
Mommy saw something
that made her feel sad.

360
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:10,174
<i>My sister called me.</i>
<i>She said she's being followed.</i>

361
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,209
<i>She's been online</i>
<i>trying to figure out</i>

362
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:15,246
- What really
happened in ecuador.
- You tapped into her computer?

363
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:17,848
- Yes.
- Never authorized you
to do that.

364
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,051
Well, I apologize, bruce.
I didn't think you'd object.

365
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,854
She's on our system,
and we have responsibilities.

366
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,923
We both have to answer
to the board of directors.

367
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:28,859
This is her flavor
of the week. She'll lose
interest in a second.

368
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:32,129
I don't agree.
I think this really
has her going.

369
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:35,900
She made an appointment
with tom delmonte about this.

370
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,835
- Her lawyer? Hmm.
- <i>Yes.</i>

371
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,970
I think we should
call in torrance.

372
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,072
I don't know.

373
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,741
Well, there's a lot of things

374
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:46,277
In this situation which
could use special handling.

375
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:48,812
We should
call in tor now.

376
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,185
<i>Did you listen to the tape?</i>

377
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,955
- <i>Yes.</i>
<i>- Were you able</i>
<i>to make arrangements</i>

378
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,957
<i>To send money</i>
<i>to the boy's family?</i>

379
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,960
I'm sorry,
we couldn't locate
any relatives at all.

380
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:08,699
I need to find out
what happened down there.

381
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:12,169
Clearbec does have
legitimate interests
in south america, morgan.

382
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:15,205
Look, the boy stuck
a gun into his mouth

383
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,107
And blew his brains out
in front of me.

384
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,809
I think something...

385
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,744
Ugly is being covered up.

386
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,014
And I think
that you should
not get involved.

387
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,050
Oh.

388
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:28,619
Can you find me someone
to send down there?

389
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:30,321
you're serious?

390
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,828
Umm... There's one
of our investigators
in washington

391
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,730
That might be helpful.
I could speak to him.

392
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,966
- I'll get back to you.
- Thank you.

393
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,942
- uh-huh?

394
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:55,212
It's calder.
We have a situation.

395
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,247
I.D. Number?

396
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:02,186
237418665.

397
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:06,056
I understand
your south african
deal's in jeopardy.

398
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,759
- <i>That's why</i>
<i>I'm calling you.</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

399
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,260
Well, you should
have called earlier.

400
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,997
We have
some problem areas.

401
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:16,367
And I think morgan swinton
may be one of them.

402
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,005
- She and bruce really close?
- Well, they're siblings,

403
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:23,140
But if push comes
to shove

404
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,809
I imagine bruce will do
what he has to do.

405
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,647
Send me
what you have on this.

406
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,248
Send me everything.

407
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,150
<i>I was in south america</i>
<i>a long time.</i>

408
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,285
I never saw
anything like this.

409
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:37,187
It's a serious mess.

410
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:40,057
We have to make this
disappear.

411
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,298
- yeah.

412
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,968
<i>Doing much these days, jack?</i>

413
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,172
- Not really.
- Some civilian wants

414
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,074
Something checked out
in ecuador, good money.

415
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,842
You take it.

416
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,778
<i>I've still got a price</i>
<i>on my head down there.</i>

417
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,781
Take a flight,
look around, fly back home,

418
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:06,750
- <i>File a report,</i>
<i>pick up a nice check.</i>
<i>- What? What's the matter?</i>

419
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,921
- I don't think so.
- <i>You can't outrun it, jack.</i>

420
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:14,425
- You oughta know that by now.
- I don't like you, clive.

421
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:17,261
No, you don't like anybody
who knows what you did.

422
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:19,329
Come on,
let's pick this up, come on.

423
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,198
You forget--
it was for a good cause.

424
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,901
It wasn't for a cause.
It was for vested interests.

425
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:26,036
- go.
- <i>Take the job.</i>

426
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,905
I got a family now.

427
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:31,008
- You're marking time.
- I've already hung up, clive.

428
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,165
<i>- oh.</i>

429
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,021
Hey, you're leaving
earlier and earlier.

430
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,232
I have
a lot of work to do.

431
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,237
I listen to your show
every night, jack.

432
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,374
You know that?

433
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:13,210
I lie in bed
and I listen to it...

434
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,446
Until I fall asleep.

435
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:22,586
It's the next best thing
to having you beside me.

436
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:28,926
I'm always amazed
at how much you give
to complete strangers.

437
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,362
It's a part of the show.

438
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,300
I wish you'd bring
more of the show home.

439
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,174
What is it, jack?

440
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,911
What are you looking for?

441
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,551
Like the show says.

442
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,021
Yeah.

443
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,091
Well, maybe the truth
is right here.

444
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,630
You were always
the smartest girl
in the room.

445
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,169
I gotta go.

446
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,942
Jason ate a little bit
with me today.

447
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,648
Just a little bit.

448
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:34,258
<i>I don't care what you say!</i>

449
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,061
- <i>I think it was stupid.</i>
<i>- I disagree. It wasn't stupid.</i>

450
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,931
It was an impassioned choice,
a sacrifice.

451
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:44,968
<i>My father always told me</i>
<i>there is nothin' worth layin'</i>
<i>your life down for.</i>

452
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,372
- <i>I disagree.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>You don't know what</i>
<i>you're talkin' about!</i>

453
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:51,275
- What is life without freedom?
- <i>You're still alive.</i>

454
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:54,044
<i>Is freedom worth dying for?</i>

455
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:57,514
- <i>No, it is not.</i>
<i>- That's the question.</i>

456
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,283
<i>This is jack begosian.</i>

457
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:01,385
<i>Good night</i>
<i>and good morning.</i>

458
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:11,962
Jack?

459
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,432
Jack begosian?

460
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,370
- Yes.
- I'm morgan swinton.

461
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:23,206
<i>Yes, I know.</i>
<i>I saw you on the news.</i>

462
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,375
You have a moment?

463
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:26,944
I need to talk with you.

464
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,555
the village was quarantined

465
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,324
And many people,
perhaps hundreds,

466
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:43,460
Died or were executed
for corporate protection.

467
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,395
Clearbec may
be implicated.

468
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,130
I need someone
to go down there

469
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,732
And find out
what happened,

470
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:51,168
And you come
highly recommended.

471
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,503
I'm told you're...

472
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,572
Very familiar
with that part
of the world.

473
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,741
I've already said no.

474
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,576
And I'm asking you
to reconsider.

475
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:05,515
There may be survivors,
witnesses to what happened.

476
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,751
If there are,
I need you to bring
them back here.

477
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:09,686
- And then what?
- I'll go public.

478
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:13,357
I'll stop them
from doing that deal
in south africa, because--

479
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,994
You know what
they'll do down there.

480
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:19,062
Bleed it dry.

481
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:22,366
It'll be like trying
to suck an elephant
through a straw.

482
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,701
<i>I'll pay you very well,</i>
<i>mr. Begosian.</i>

483
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:27,504
50,000 before
you travel down
to ecuador.

484
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,473
If you come back
with witnesses,

485
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:31,708
Another 200,000.

486
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,278
All expenses paid,
including private air travel.

487
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,516
Wasn't your father
the founder of clearbec?

488
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,754
- Yes.
- Then why are
you doing this?

489
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:48,058
My father taught me
everything has a price,

490
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,227
But not everything
should be for sale.

491
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,132
Ever seen a boy
blow his brains out
in front of you?

492
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,569
Unfortunately.

493
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,507
Clearbec was
a good company,
mr. Begosian.

494
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,515
Listen
to this recording.

495
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:16,153
Francisco francis.

496
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:21,191
That name mean
anything to you?

497
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:29,800
<i>- A very bad form of</i>
<i>typhus emerged in the town.</i>

498
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:32,769
<i>Francisco francis broke</i>
<i>into the inagua office.</i>

499
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,704
<i>Clearbec's own report</i>
<i>stated what was happening</i>

500
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,573
<i>And how they were involved.</i>

501
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,575
They had orders to find francis
<i>and kill any residents</i>

502
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,410
<i>That were trying to get out.</i>

503
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,412
<i>No one knew what to do</i>
<i>with the sick and the dying.</i>

504
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,147
<i>They began</i>
<i>to execute everyone.</i>

505
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,851
I was offered $250,000 to take
a job in south america.

506
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,354
$250,000.

507
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,459
Who would offer you that?

508
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,295
Her name is
morgan swinton.

509
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,730
She's a major
shareholder

510
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,632
In clearbec,
the water company.

511
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,468
Her father founded
the company

512
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,136
And her brother bruce
runs it.

513
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,508
It's been a long time
since you've been out
in the field, jack.

514
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,846
You don't have
to do this.

515
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:18,381
Listen to me.

516
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,150
There was a name
on the c.D.

517
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,319
There was
a name mentioned.

518
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:30,393
- Francisco.
- Who?

519
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,197
Francisco francis.

520
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,267
He was responsible for...

521
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:40,637
Organizing a peasant revolt
in south america.

522
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,273
They were protesting
the privatization of water,

523
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:47,177
Land rights
and industrial pollution.

524
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,879
He became...

525
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,219
Quite militant

526
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:59,823
And he was labeled
an eco-terrorist.

527
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,660
You knew him.

528
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,703
If he's alive...

529
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:16,573
And if he's in trouble,

530
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:18,842
I need to help him.

531
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,378
Why?

532
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,483
I owe him.

533
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:28,552
For what?

534
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,689
You know
I can't tell you that.

535
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,391
It's best
you don't know.

536
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:36,459
My god, what did
you do down there?

537
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,707
Just think of the money.

538
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,517
look, if you--

539
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,953
If you need to do this...

540
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,224
I need--
I need your blessing.

541
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,428
Then do it.

542
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,667
Do it,
but don't do it for us.

543
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:20,470
It's the same thing.

544
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,884
okay.

545
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,022
<i>Okay.</i>

546
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:41,625
<i>-</i> <i>this is</i>
<i>jack begosian.</i>

547
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:44,027
<i>Somewhere along the line,</i>
<i>we decided to turn</i>

548
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,863
<i>The seven deadly sins</i>

549
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:49,532
- <i>Greed, gluttony, anger--</i>

550
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:53,870
- Hello?
- Yes, this is jack begosian.

551
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,372
<i>We're on.</i>

552
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,707
Thank you.

553
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,410
Don't thank me yet.

554
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:01,978
I need the 250 up front.

555
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,813
<i>All up front?</i>

556
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,750
Yes, for my family,

557
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:09,052
And any unforeseen expenses.

558
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:11,321
My advice is to keep
a low profile

559
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:12,856
<i>And stay away</i>
<i>from your brother.</i>

560
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:14,591
My brother would
never harm me.

561
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:16,526
I can't guarantee that.

562
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:18,928
I'll get back to you
to finalize arrangements.

563
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,021
- Did you get my list?
- <i>Yes.</i>

564
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,157
I arrive in quito tomorrow.

565
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,025
<i>Who are</i>
<i>you working for now?</i>

566
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:31,194
Myself.
Gotta go.

567
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,919
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

568
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,789
What's the matter, champ?

569
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,891
Come on,
walk me to the truck.
I wanna talk to you.

570
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,660
Come on.

571
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:18,541
- <i>Can you</i>
<i>get the door for me?</i>
<i>- Okay, dad.</i>

572
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,543
- <i>You got it?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

573
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:22,212
<i>Good boy.</i>

574
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:25,114
<i>Yeah.</i>

575
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,650
- Come here, I want
to talk to you.
- Okay.

576
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,122
You know, daddy's gotta
go away on this trip.

577
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,896
So you gotta be the man
of the house, all right?

578
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:41,631
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

579
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,900
And you gotta take care
of mom, all right?

580
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,870
And no matter
what happens,

581
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:49,606
You're gonna be
my son forever.

582
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:52,075
Right?

583
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,847
Nothing could
ever change that.

584
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,751
<i>And I'm gonna be</i>
<i>your dad forever, right?</i>

585
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,253
<i>Yeah, forever.</i>

586
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,924
Now, look.

587
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,194
See this?

588
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,098
Look at that.
Who's there?

589
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,001
- Me and mom.
- You and mom,
that's right.

590
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:21,271
And I'm gonna have you guys
with me all the time.

591
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:24,073
And I'm gonna
place you right here
next to my heart, okay?

592
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:25,842
I have you with me
all the time,

593
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:27,944
Then nothing can ever
happen to me.

594
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,986
<i>this is jack begosian.</i>

<i>I am instructing you</i>
<i>to answer the question!</i>

602
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:00,710
I will remove mr. Begosian
from this hearing

603
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:02,111
Before I instruct him
to answer.

604
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,948
<i>Did you lie under oath,</i>
<i>mr. Begosian?</i>

605
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,183
Don't answer
that question, jack!

606
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:09,652
<i>The cia has no standing</i>
<i>in this hearing.</i>

607
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,925
<i>Please answer the question,</i>
<i>mr. Begosian.</i>

608
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,161
<i>Did you lie under oath?</i>

609
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,369
<i>Yes.</i>

610
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,739
<i>I lied.</i>

611
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,897
Welcome to quito,
mr. Shore.

612
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,834
Come on up.

613
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,303
I got something
to show you.

614
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,805
Thank you.

615
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:14,083
Welcome to my home.
Come on in.

616
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:16,019
Close the door.

617
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,721
Miguel said
you might need

618
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:20,657
A little bit
of protection, so...

619
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,360
You pick.

620
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:26,763
Come on,
let's get out of here.

621
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,331
I'll give you
a good price.

622
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,134
Let's go.

623
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:39,342
What's your hurry?
I'm gonna get you
there on time.

624
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,111
- Give me the keys.
- You don't want me to drive?

625
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,212
- No.
- I'm your guide.

626
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:44,414
Get in the car.

627
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:46,049
Good! That way,
I can keep drinking.

628
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,788
You're lucky
you know my friend miguel.

629
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,225
He says you two
worked together before.

630
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,964
- He says I can trust you.
- He said I could trust you.

631
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:04,867
I'm very good
at what I do, my friend.

632
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,203
So you work
both sides, then?

633
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:11,074
yeah, but only one
at a time, okay?

634
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:13,910
- A man of principles.
- I'm a professional.

635
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:15,712
You pay me,
I work for you.

636
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:17,880
And I'm the only one
that knows where they're at.

637
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,883
I got smugglers that work
the mountains for me,

638
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,119
And they see
a lot of things.

639
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:24,454
Tell me
this one thing then.

640
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:25,988
What?

641
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,292
Francisco francis--
is he alive?

642
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:31,794
For now, yeah.

643
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,767
I arranged
a back-up vehicle
like you asked.

644
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,302
It's up by esmeralda.

645
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:41,771
It's the old slave town.

646
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:44,240
It's gonna be
a quick extraction.

647
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,776
We find francis,
we're in and we're out.

648
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:49,245
I know you have
a plane waiting.

649
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:54,283
But what if
francis doesn't want
to go with you?

650
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,352
what then, my friend?

651
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:58,755
Then he won't survive.

652
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:01,457
South africa has
over 50 million people.

653
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:03,493
We'll be running
the entire water system

654
00:46:03,495 --> 00:46:05,495
<i>And</i> we're in negotiations
with greece.

655
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:08,097
- <i>Greece is going</i>
<i>to privatize water?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

656
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,399
<i>Look, I've been hearing</i>
<i>nasty rumors about clearbec.</i>

657
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:13,202
Our reputation as
an international provider

658
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:15,805
Of high-quality
water service
is impeccable.

659
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,306
<i>Yeah right,</i>
<i>I'll send you my story.</i>

660
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:19,475
Send it to me before
it goes to print.
Thanks, wayne.

661
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,944
<i>I need the study on</i>
<i>water-level projections...</i>

662
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:23,913
You're late.
You have docs to sign.

663
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:28,151
I'm not signing anything
until I get some answers
about ecuador.

664
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:30,386
I wouldn't mind
a coffee though.

665
00:46:30,388 --> 00:46:32,855
Tracy, coffee,
straight up.

666
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:36,893
Morgan, this deal
with south africa is huge.

667
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:39,362
We are going
to own every drop
that country's got.

668
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:40,830
Wow.

669
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:42,899
That'll certainly
drive up the profits,

670
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:45,134
- Won't it, people?
- Come sign these.

671
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,537
<i>- uh, that'll be my arm.</i>

672
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,175
- hang on.

673
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:54,210
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

674
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:56,479
When was the last time
you brought the kids

675
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:59,115
Up to the lake house,
like dad did with us?

676
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:01,317
<i>Have you seen these</i>
<i>water table assessments?</i>

677
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,219
I want you
to listen to me.

678
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:05,288
I have power
over your bank accounts,

679
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,056
Your estate
and your stocks.

680
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:08,991
That's the way
dad set this up.

681
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,927
And I can have
that changed.

682
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,328
- No, you can't.
- Oh?

683
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:16,032
You can't.
Your well-being

684
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:17,834
Is inextricably linked

685
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,569
To the well-being
of clearbec.

686
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:21,504
You have to sign
these papers.

687
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,906
You <i>need</i>
<i>to sign these papers.</i>

688
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:26,609
No. You need me
to sign these papers.

689
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:30,112
I have to have
a cup of coffee.

690
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:32,982
thank you.

691
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,954
- Yes?
- Morgan just hired

692
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:40,122
Jack begosian
to go to ecuador.

693
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:42,458
Morgan's hired someone
to go to ecuador?

694
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,428
Not just someone--
jack begosian.

695
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,330
Who's jack begosian?

696
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,616
That's correct, general.

697
00:48:06,618 --> 00:48:10,019
I'm sending you
an extensive file
on him right now.

698
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,522
Jack begosian?

699
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:15,524
That's correct.

700
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,994
- <i>I understand, mr. Calder.</i>
<i>- Thank you, general.</i>

701
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:22,531
The army is
controlling access

702
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:24,433
To the area where
my men have seen him.

703
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,403
Give them
a little bit of money

704
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,238
And they'll let us
move through.

705
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,374
No!

706
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:34,343
- no!

707
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,582
Slow down here.

708
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,450
Just let me
do the talking, okay?

709
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:43,219
I know how
to handle these matters.

710
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,992
Listen.
If he asks you who I am,

711
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:52,161
Tell him I'm a canadian
nature photographer.

712
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:54,130
- Do you have a camera?
- No.

713
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:55,531
That can be a problem.

714
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:12,214
No vehicles allowed
past this point.

715
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:16,485
Ask him how long
it would be on foot
to the bird sanctuary.

716
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:20,289
The bird sanctuary.
Um...

717
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,031
A day and a half.

718
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,301
Ask him,
if he would be so kind,

719
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:35,571
If we leave him
our jeep, and let us
pass through on foot.

720
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,713
- He says yes.
- Okay.

721
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:46,015
Tell him thank you very much,
and come get your stuff.

722
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:47,483
- thank you.

723
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,624
- get 'em out of the road.

724
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,167
It's okay.

725
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:08,437
<i>- it's okay. It's okay.</i>

726
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,407
No.

727
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,717
Morning, bruce.

728
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,487
Some liabilities close
to home have developed.

729
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:27,156
- With my sister?
- No, tony green.

730
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:29,158
- Tony?
- He's going to the press.

731
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,527
He already set up
a meeting with a reporter.

732
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,463
<i>It's what you need.</i>
<i>It's what you--</i>

You can't do that!
You cannot shoot
soldiers here!

And then you leave
a witness behind!

737
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:44,774

- Yeah, too late!

738
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:47,343
Yeah, too late for me!
I'm toast!

Who was your meeting with,
mr. Green?

758
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:13,429
I had no meeting.
My meeting's with you.

759
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:16,565
It's our understanding
you were scheduled to meet

760
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:20,603
With a member of the press
unfriendly to our cause.

761
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:24,440
Yeah, well-- your cause?
That's what you call it?

762
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:27,343
- It is my duty to protect
my country, mr. Green.

763
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:29,812
Okay, let me
tell you something
about your understanding.

764
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:32,481
<i>It's based</i>
<i>on a misunderstanding</i>

765
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,717
Because I didn't meet
with any reporter.

766
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,919
What an unfortunate
answer, mr. Green.

767
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:40,189
As we say...

768
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:42,858
For I have already met
with the reporter.

769
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,296
This only confirms
our suspicions about you.

770
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:50,533
- No. No no.
- My men will take care
of you from here.

771
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:53,602
The reason
this has happened

772
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:58,240
Is because too many people
have too much,

773
00:52:58,242 --> 00:53:02,344
And too many people
have too little.

774
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,448
So this is not over
by any means.

775
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,718
I agree with you.
<i>Vaya con dios.</i>

776
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,755
Hey! Hey, man!

777
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:14,957
I am an american.

778
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,926
- I'm an american!

779
00:53:16,928 --> 00:53:19,361
You can't do this to me!

780
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:25,367
Yes, general?

781
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,836
Your associate seems
to be missing.

782
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:30,973
Well, if you find him,
have him give me a call.

783
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:32,675
I will.

784
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:36,445
We have located
your jack begosian.

785
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:39,582
There is $1 million
for you

786
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:41,784
If you could dissuade
francisco francis

787
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:45,321
And jack begosian
from leaving ecuador.

788
00:53:45,323 --> 00:53:46,822
Oh, mr. Calder,

789
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:49,558
I believe they're worth
a million each.

790
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,761
I think you're right.

791
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,606
<i>This is jack begosian.</i>
<i>You're on the air.</i>

792
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:05,908
<i>I was hoping we could talk</i>
<i>about eternity, jack.</i>

793
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,544
In what sense?

794
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:11,614
<i>Do you think that there's</i>
<i>some aspect of ourselves</i>

795
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:14,617
<i>That lives on,</i>
<i>beyond this life?</i>

796
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:18,654
<i>Yes, in the example</i>
<i>we leave.</i>

797
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,291
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

798
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:25,294
In the example
you leave behind,

799
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:27,830
Good or bad,
that's what's remembered.

800
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,500
<i>How do you want</i>
<i>to be remembered, jack?</i>

801
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,720
<i>Well, I've done</i>
<i>some things that</i>

802
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:53,689
<i>I'm not proud of...</i>

803
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,829
<i>And, uh,</i>
<i>will never be forgotten.</i>

804
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,399
<i>That are--</i>

805
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:07,536
Are impossible
to forgive.

806
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:13,542
<i>But I'm trying to do</i>
<i>my best to make amends</i>

807
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,411
<i>And catch up...</i>

808
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:19,415
<i>And do my part.</i>

809
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,819
<i>Thanks for the call.</i>

810
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:48,110
- You all right?

811
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:12,368
<i>- Hold up.</i>

812
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,806
Put your gun down.

813
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:23,045
Put your gun down!

814
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:31,920
- Hey!

815
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:18,634
You'll get your money
by next Friday, quako.

816
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:21,203
I must tell you,
if this is forced
to referendum,

817
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:23,639
We cannot deliver
on our agreement.

818
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:25,707
<i>If this is not settled</i>
<i>next Friday,</i>

819
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:27,910
- <i>It may well go</i>
<i>to referendum.</i>
<i>- Rest assured</i>

820
00:57:27,912 --> 00:57:31,146
- We'll be closed next week.
- <i>My associates and I</i>
<i>have always felt</i>

821
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,949
<i>Clearbec was</i>
<i>the most qualified company</i>
<i>with which to work.</i>

822
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,219
- Good.
- <i>But we've been hearing</i>
<i>some very unfavorable rumors</i>

823
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:39,054
<i>Regarding clearbec</i>
<i>in ecuador.</i>

824
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:40,789
Oh, it's nothing
to worry about.

825
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,491
<i>There are</i>
<i>many companies</i>

826
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:44,626
<i>We can do this deal</i>
<i>with, bruce.</i>

827
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:48,063
- Rest assured
we'll be closed.
- <i>Good.</i>

828
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:50,499
We'll be awaiting
your payment.

829
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,209
Alberto shore
de canada.

830
00:58:00,211 --> 00:58:02,544
What is your real name?

831
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:06,849
Jack.

832
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:10,252
Jack begosian.

833
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:13,489
What brings you
to these mountains,

834
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:15,090
Jack begosian?

835
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:25,033
I came looking
for the survivors
of the attack at tayca.

836
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:28,270
Why? To what end?

837
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:31,607
The people I work for,

838
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:33,809
They want
the world to know

839
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:35,511
The wrong
that was done here,

840
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,946
<i>And the people</i>
<i>who did it charged.</i>

841
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:40,048
That's never gonna happen.

842
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,050
Clearbec pays millions
and millions of dollars

843
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,619
To the politicians here.

844
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:45,120
They can be stopped.

845
00:58:45,122 --> 00:58:46,922
Okay.

846
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:49,191
Well, I admire
your spirit.

847
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,064
Were you at tayca?

848
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:57,766
Yes, I was.

849
00:58:57,768 --> 00:58:59,735
There was
a massacre there.

850
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:01,570
I'm aware.

851
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,273
What brought you there?

852
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,809
My father
lived in tayca.

853
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:12,014
We were visiting him
when the typhus broke.

854
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:18,554
I went
to the offices of inagua

855
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:21,156
To get some answers.

856
00:59:21,158 --> 00:59:22,925
But I got none.

857
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:26,028
So I broke in that night
and I got many answers.

858
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:29,798
...Terrorist.

859
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,302
They say that
I poisoned the water.

860
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:35,971
They say that
I attacked the army.

861
00:59:35,973 --> 00:59:38,307
Neither is true.

862
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:40,175
It's a lie.

863
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,811
I believe you.

864
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,718
Let me help you,
francisco.

865
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,896
Thank you.

866
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,405
So how do you know
my name, jack?

867
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:53,749
You were the founder

868
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:56,184
And the leader
of <i>la vida campesina.</i>

869
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:02,190
I didn't lead them well.

870
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:07,329
The movement almost died
underneath me.

871
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:10,098
I learned
that nothing grows

872
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,734
Out of the barrel
of a gun

873
01:01:12,736 --> 01:01:15,404
But violence.

874
01:01:15,406 --> 01:01:19,741
And that mao was wrong
and gandhi was right.

875
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,377
You said you found answers

876
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:24,746
When you broke into
the offices of inagua.

877
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:29,818
Clearbec's filtration system
is what caused the typhus.

878
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,220
You have proof?

879
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:34,322
I have their records.
I downloaded them.

880
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:36,858
- I have them over here.
- Then come with me,

881
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,694
Be a witness
against clearbec.

882
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:41,363
- Tell your story.
- Francisco.

883
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,198
Come with me.

884
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,067
Francisco.

885
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,109
- <i>Okay.</i>
<i>- Okay?</i>

886
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:59,414
My wife--
she doesn't trust you.

887
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,450
I know.

888
01:02:01,452 --> 01:02:03,719
She thinks
that our family
won't be safe.

889
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:06,922
Is your family safe here?

890
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,958
How long can
they live like this?

891
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,793
How long
can anyone live?

892
01:02:11,795 --> 01:02:15,130
Until we die.

893
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,966
Come with me.

894
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,002
We will stop clearbec
from doing

895
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:22,871
What they did here
in other countries.

896
01:02:22,873 --> 01:02:24,906
How do you know
they'll listen to us?

897
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,243
You have to trust me.

898
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,012
<i>Francisco.</i>

899
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:33,849
<i>You must trust me.</i>

900
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:35,817
You must
trust me!

901
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,826
I put my trust in you.

902
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:01,102
Thank you.

903
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,607
We need to move now.

904
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:41,610
- Get your family out!

905
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:44,346
- Momma!
- Mia! Mia! <i>Vamos!</i>

906
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:47,148
Vamos, <i>mia.</i>
<i>Vamanos, vamanos!</i>

907
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:51,219
<i>-</i> go go go go go go
go go go go go go!

908
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,921
Get your family out!

909
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:01,630
come on, come on.

910
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:04,165
Come on, move it.
Come on, come on, come.

911
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:05,667
Come on. Come on.

912
01:05:09,306 --> 01:05:12,040
<i>- hey!</i>

913
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:40,669
- mama!

914
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,441
Come on, let's go.
Let's move.

915
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:55,410
- I can't.
I gotta go back!
- What?!

916
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,581
He must not
go back up there.

917
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:01,516
Please please,
take care of my family.

918
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:03,685
If something happens to you,
the truth will not get out.

919
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:06,554
- she has the truth.

920
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,126
- Keep moving downhill.

921
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:14,596
- Mama.

922
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:43,725
It's okay, it's okay.
Shh shh.

923
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:47,195
- shh.

924
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:50,131
<i>- go. Go go go.</i>

925
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:52,600
- let's go.

926
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:55,136
- You ready?
Let's go. Come on.
- Yeah.

927
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,414
<i>Shoot to kill. Got it?</i>

928
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:09,150
- Yes.
- Wait for my first shot.

929
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,580
- Ah!

930
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,640
Okay, get 'em out of here!
Get 'em out of here!

931
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,414
Vaya con dios!

932
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,851
Francisco!
Your family, let's go!

933
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:19,587
- <i>Let's move!</i>

934
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:22,423
Francisco, we gotta move!
Vamos! Vamos!

935
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,540
It's all clear up there.

936
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,809
Okay?
Rest up a little.

937
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:17,545
We'll hide out
in a bit.

938
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:27,355
Francisco,
may I sit for a moment?

939
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:29,624
Of course.

940
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:48,843
There's something
you need to know.

941
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,348
What?

942
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,354
I worked for the c.I.A.
In south america.

943
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:03,691
I see.

944
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:05,660
I'm the man responsible

945
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:07,562
For sending you to prison.

946
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,672
<i>Well, then...</i>

947
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,009
I'm indebted to you.

948
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,513
I don't understand.

949
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,651
When I went to prison,

950
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:32,620
It changed...
The way I thought.

951
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:36,357
I wrote this book,
"presence is born."

952
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:39,394
I published it
under a pseudonym.

953
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:44,565
You wrote
"presence is born"?

954
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:46,401
Yes.

955
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,905
That book was
very successful.

956
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:52,840
It was a best-seller.

957
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:56,744
Yes, I--
I gave all the rights

958
01:11:56,746 --> 01:11:59,414
Of that book
to <i>la vida campesina.</i>

959
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,985
- You regret that?
- No.

960
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:09,824
<i>La vida campesina</i> is
150 million people strong.

961
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:13,494
It's a movement

962
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:17,432
Of peasants and farmers
who are fighting,

963
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:20,535
Unlike me, peacefully,

964
01:12:20,537 --> 01:12:22,737
For the integrity
of their land and their water

965
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:24,939
And for the needs of

966
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:26,574
All their children,

967
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:28,676
And the children to come.

968
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,353
Do you have children?

969
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:39,921
I have a boy.

970
01:12:39,923 --> 01:12:42,890
His name is jason.

971
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:52,633
"you will be my son
forever and ever."

972
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:55,770
I wrote that

973
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,450
<i>si.</i>

974
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:11,686
Nothing will
ever change that.

975
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:15,723
Nothing.

976
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:18,025
I'm sorry, my friend.

977
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,096
It was a gift.

978
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,135
It was a gift to me.

979
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,174
We need to move on.

980
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:11,179
<i>- I have a vehicle</i>
<i>waiting for us up here.</i>

981
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:20,955
- Give me your hand. Come on.

982
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,666
<i>Francisco.</i>

983
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:36,838
- Francisco.

984
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:46,747
francisco! Francisco!

985
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:48,649
Francisco!
Francisco!

986
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:52,153
Francisco! Francisco!
Francisco! Francisco!

987
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:54,522
Francisco, let's go!
We have to get out of here!

988
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:57,692
Francisco! Francisco!
Francisco! Francisco!

989
01:14:57,694 --> 01:14:59,560
Francisco!
Francisco!

990
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:53,180
<i>The people down here</i>
<i>regard you a hero.</i>

991
01:15:53,182 --> 01:15:55,816
<i>They call you</i>
<i>francisco francis.</i>

992
01:15:55,818 --> 01:15:58,152
I was born
in san francisco.

993
01:15:58,154 --> 01:16:01,589
<i>You received your ph.D.</i>
<i>In environmental studies,</i>

994
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:03,891
<i>Came down here with</i>
<i>greenpeace to south america,</i>

995
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,726
<i>And now you're serving</i>

996
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:08,095
<i>11 years</i>
<i>in a very tough prison.</i>

997
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:11,599
- Yes.
- <i>How did you become involved</i>

998
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:14,869
<i>In the south american</i>
<i>water wars that resulted</i>
<i>in you becoming incarcerated?</i>

999
01:16:14,871 --> 01:16:16,938
How could I not
get involved?

1000
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:20,274
It became illegal for farmers
to collect rainwater

1001
01:16:20,276 --> 01:16:24,111
Because clearbec owned
all the water rights
in the whole country.

1002
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:27,014
That's like saying,
"I own god."

1003
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:29,617
<i>Do you have any regrets</i>

1004
01:16:29,619 --> 01:16:33,254
<i>About what you did</i>
<i>and being here today?</i>

1005
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:35,790
I regret the violence.

1006
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,125
I regret...

1007
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:42,229
<i>Not having enough...</i>

1008
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:45,866
Knowledge...

1009
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,371
To make the...

1010
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:54,842
<i>Proper choices</i>
<i>that would have...</i>

1011
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,979
<i>Helped the people.</i>

1012
01:16:57,981 --> 01:17:00,114
<i>I regret that.</i>

1013
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:04,852
<i>- hello?</i>

1014
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:07,254
Hello, can you hear me?

1015
01:17:07,256 --> 01:17:10,992
- <i>Hello?</i>
<i>- Mom, it's for you.</i>

1016
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,929
Thank you, sweetie.

1017
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:16,197
Thank you.

1018
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:17,999
hello?

1019
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:19,634
Yes, this is jack.

1020
01:17:19,636 --> 01:17:21,168
<i>I've found</i>
<i>francisco francis.</i>

1021
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,803
Oh!

1022
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,207
Yes.

1023
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:27,675
Is-- is he--

1024
01:17:27,677 --> 01:17:28,976
He's alive.

1025
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:32,913
I need you to call
the number I gave you.

1026
01:17:32,915 --> 01:17:35,282
<i>Tell them there are</i>
<i>four people coming in.</i>

1027
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:37,418
I'm gonna text you
the names.

1028
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:39,987
Confirm you received them,
forward and delete.

1029
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,255
<i>You got that?</i>

1030
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:42,923
And-- and--

1031
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,359
Hello?!

1032
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,262
<i>Jack?</i>

1033
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:58,339
- <i>Yes?</i>
<i>- Well, looks like you're gonna</i>
<i>get your money's worth.</i>

1034
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,279
When that plane lands,

1035
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:08,182
<i>We've got</i>
<i>to prevent begosian</i>

1036
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,384
From bringing
francis <i>anywhere</i>

1037
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:12,319
Where he could cause
any more damage.

1038
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:16,323
Because, bruce,
if we don't, we are finished.

1039
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:21,228
We've gone too far, doug.
Too far.

1040
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:24,231
<i>Bruce, listen to me.</i>

1041
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:27,268
Francisco francis
has <i>many</i> enemies.

1042
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:29,870
Violent people who will
stop at <i>nothing</i>

1043
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:31,238
To eliminate him.

1044
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,241
<i>They hired</i>
<i>an assassin-- tor.</i>

1045
01:18:34,243 --> 01:18:37,378
<i>The assassin will kill</i>
<i>jack begosian</i>

1046
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,880
And francisco francis.

1047
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:43,350
<i>Our</i> security will kill
the assassin

1048
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:47,455
<i>Because they're there</i>
<i>protecting morgan.</i>

1049
01:18:47,457 --> 01:18:50,858
And morgan will still
be a liability.

1050
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:05,005
Am I your enemy now, bruce?

1051
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:08,409
No, but...

1052
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:11,078
What you're doing will
bring down clearbec, morgan.

1053
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:14,281
Maybe clearbec deserves
to be brought down.

1054
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:18,219
You're forgetting
all the good that
we have done.

1055
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:22,356
You're forgetting
those thousands of towns
and villages

1056
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:25,826
That we provided
water for that otherwise
wouldn't have had it.

1057
01:19:25,828 --> 01:19:28,395
You're forgetting about all
the lives of the children
that we saved.

1058
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:32,833
No, I'm not.
But I'm not forgetting
about ecuador either.

1059
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:36,103
I'm sorry that
that happened. I am.

1060
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:39,306
<i>But you're forgetting</i>
<i>to look at the big picture.</i>

1061
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:42,243
We have to move on.
We have to move forward.

1062
01:19:42,245 --> 01:19:45,412
- There's just
too much at stake.
- Too much what?

1063
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:47,782
<i>When is it enough, bruce?</i>

1064
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,186
I can't believe
you of all people
would say that.

1065
01:19:52,188 --> 01:19:54,255
Do you remember
what daddy used to say?

1066
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,160
<i>It's never too late</i>

We're funded.

What do you want me

What about your sister?

You owe me one, jack.

When tor takes them out,
I need you to kill him.

Plant this cellphone

There's 43 calls

A golf bag? Really?

1176
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,893
You think
we can't handle this, jack?

1177
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:37,697
There are a thousand ways
to spin this.

1178
01:30:37,699 --> 01:30:39,533
Francis is a terrorist.

1179

You're lunatic fringe, jack.

You know that?
You hear me?

You made shit

Well, we can.

We can, jack!

Let me tell you
how this is gonna work.

1185
01:30:56,484 --> 01:30:58,485
Before your skin
starts to blister,

1186
01:30:58,487 --> 01:31:00,921
You're gonna
smell something.

1187
01:31:00,923 --> 01:31:02,789
You're gonna smell
your hair

1188
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:06,126
And your eyebrows
as they begin to burn.

1189
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:13,533
Then your eyes,
they're gonna ooze.

1190
01:31:13,535 --> 01:31:15,902
They're gonna run
like broken egg yolks.

1191
01:31:15,904 --> 01:31:17,771
I know what you did.

1192
01:31:17,773 --> 01:31:20,707
I saw what you did.
You're not--

1194
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:27,247
You are not better
than me, jack!

1195
01:31:27,249 --> 01:31:29,850
We are exactly alike!

1196
01:31:31,552 --> 01:31:33,954
Take a look
at yourself, jack!

1197
01:31:33,956 --> 01:31:36,923
We are <i>exactly</i> alike!

1198
01:31:36,925 --> 01:31:40,794
I know who you are!

<i>In a golf bag</i>

1201
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:52,739
<i>Outside the house.</i>
<i>His name is doug calder.</i>

1202
01:31:52,741 --> 01:31:55,809
<i>He's the man responsible</i>

<i>This is jack begosian,</i>

1204
01:32:09,591 --> 01:32:11,725
And for those of you just
tuning in, you are listening

1205
01:32:11,727 --> 01:32:14,227
To the new daytime version
of "the truth."

1206
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:16,162
Today I have
with me, the--

1207
01:32:16,164 --> 01:32:19,199
The great honor to have
francisco francis,

1208
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:21,234
The founder
of <i>la vida campesina</i> movement,

1209
01:32:21,236 --> 01:32:25,705
Who brought to light
the atrocities committed
by clearbec in ecuador.

1210
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:28,074
Francisco,
the floor is yours.

1211
01:32:28,076 --> 01:32:31,244
Thank you
for having me, jack.

1212
01:32:31,246 --> 01:32:33,780
The reason that
the clearbec incident

1213
01:32:33,782 --> 01:32:36,616
Is so horrible
is that it exposes

1214
01:32:36,618 --> 01:32:39,653
The lengths to which
corporate interests will go

1215
01:32:39,655 --> 01:32:41,221
In order
to protect themselves.

1216
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:43,156
Absolutely.

1217
01:32:43,158 --> 01:32:45,091
We'd like
to hear your thoughts.

1218

1226
01:33:04,947 --> 01:33:07,614
For conspiracy
to commit murder.

1227
01:33:07,616 --> 01:33:09,182
<i>The guy's already</i>
<i>out on bail.</i>

1228
01:33:09,184 --> 01:33:11,084
<i>He's got all the money</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

1229
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:13,086
<i>You know how</i>
<i>the system works, jack.</i>

1230
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,689
<i>No client's guilty</i>
<i>until they run out of money.</i>

1231
01:33:15,691 --> 01:33:18,625
- Well said.
Thanks for the call.

1232
01:33:18,627 --> 01:33:21,628
You know, jack, I think
that the important thing
to realize here

1233
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:24,097
Is that the water deal
in south africa has
been stopped,

1234
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:25,832
Just as it was stopped
in paraguay,

1235
01:33:25,834 --> 01:33:27,801
Just as it should
be stopped everywhere.

1236
01:33:27,803 --> 01:33:29,869
We are talking
about a natural resource,

1237
01:33:29,871 --> 01:33:31,905
A natural resource that
should be controlled

1238
01:33:31,907 --> 01:33:33,373
By the government
for the people,

1239
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:36,042
Not by the private entity
whose major interests

1240
01:33:36,044 --> 01:33:38,878
Are to maximize profit.
We have individuals

1241
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,649
Who can't even afford
to buy a piece of bread,

1242
01:33:42,651 --> 01:33:45,285
And now they won't even
be able to afford

1243
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:48,655
Drinking
a glass of water.

1244
01:33:48,657 --> 01:33:50,357
This is something
that cannot occur.

1245
01:33:50,359 --> 01:33:52,692
This is something
that we have to stop.

1246
01:33:52,694 --> 01:33:54,961
You're listening
to francisco francis

1247
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:57,397
- On "the truth."
next caller.

1248
01:33:57,399 --> 01:33:59,633
<i>I just want to know</i>

1249
01:33:59,635 --> 01:34:01,368
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>makes people like swinton</i>

1250
01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:03,737
<i>Step over the line</i>
<i>the way he did.</i>

1251
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:07,340
We all have demons.

1252
01:34:07,342 --> 01:34:09,376
Each of us.

1253
01:34:09,378 --> 01:34:11,911
<i>Oh, come on!</i>
<i>Bruce swinton was greedy!</i>

1254
01:34:11,913 --> 01:34:14,648
<i>He just wanted</i>
<i>more and more.</i>

1255
01:34:20,689 --> 01:34:22,889
It's not only about greed.

1256
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:29,396
- <i>Fear, selfishness.</i>

1257
01:34:29,398 --> 01:34:31,865
<i>Are you excusing him, jack?</i>
<i>Is that what you're doing?</i>

1258
01:34:31,867 --> 01:34:34,300
It's just not that simple.
I'm not defending him,

1259
01:34:34,302 --> 01:34:38,071
I'm not excusing him,
nor am I excusing myself.

1260
01:34:40,242 --> 01:34:43,777
You know, jack,
sometimes we--

1261
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:45,712
We do things...

1262
01:34:45,714 --> 01:34:47,414
That are difficult
for us to let go of,

1263
01:34:47,416 --> 01:34:50,083
Surrendering control,

1264
01:34:50,085 --> 01:34:51,985
Even of the thought
that we can...

1265
01:34:51,987 --> 01:34:53,987
Judge or forgive
ourselves.

1266
01:34:53,989 --> 01:34:56,356
All the things that
we've done, the things
we carry in our past,

1267
01:34:56,358 --> 01:34:58,391
They only add up to this--

1268
01:34:58,393 --> 01:34:59,793
To this moment.

1269
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:05,198
Hi.

1270
01:35:08,169 --> 01:35:09,903
Where are you?

1271
01:35:09,905 --> 01:35:12,739
I'm at the lake house.

1272
01:35:12,741 --> 01:35:15,041
Even violence.
Non-violence itself is

1273
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:17,410
Not the absence
of fighting the enemy.

1274
01:35:17,412 --> 01:35:20,313
<i>It's-- it's the ability</i>
<i>to fight</i>

1275
01:35:20,315 --> 01:35:22,982
The <i>dee</i>of the enemy,
not the human being.

1276
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:26,152
The lake house?

1277
01:35:26,154 --> 01:35:28,922
And I know that
what you have done

1278
01:35:30,324 --> 01:35:32,992
Has opened up
a road to save

1279
01:35:32,994 --> 01:35:34,828
Thousands and thousands
of people.

1280
01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:36,996
God, we used
to come here a lot

1281
01:35:36,998 --> 01:35:38,798
When we were kids,
didn't we?

1282
01:35:41,335 --> 01:35:42,902
Yeah.

1283
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:46,406
It's a little chilly but...

1284
01:35:46,408 --> 01:35:48,441
It's beautiful as ever.

1285
01:35:48,443 --> 01:35:51,211
<i>You taught me</i>
<i>how to swim there.</i>

1286
01:35:51,213 --> 01:35:53,179
You have brought light...

1287
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:56,750
<i>To a situation...</i>

1288
01:35:56,752 --> 01:35:58,885
That was in the dark.

1289
01:36:04,825 --> 01:36:06,059
Bruce, I'm on my way.

1290
01:36:06,061 --> 01:36:07,393
You've saved

1291
01:36:07,395 --> 01:36:09,863
Countless amounts
of people,

1292
01:36:09,865 --> 01:36:13,833
And for that I'm very
very thankful to you,
jack begosian.

1293
01:36:13,835 --> 01:36:15,135
<i>Morgan.</i>

1294
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:20,140
- <i>Yeah?</i>
<i>- I'm proud of you.</i>

1295
01:36:21,108 --> 01:36:22,308
Don't--

1296
01:36:26,148 --> 01:36:27,914
Bruce?

1297
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:50,370
At the end of the day,
all we can do is

1298
01:36:50,372 --> 01:36:52,138
Search for the truth,

1299
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:55,275
Learn from it
and most importantly
defend it.

1300
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:01,181
So on behalf of myself
and francisco francis,

1301
01:37:01,183 --> 01:37:05,185
I am jack begosian
and you're listening
to "the truth."

1302
01:37:05,187 --> 01:37:08,121
Good night
and make it a good day.

1303
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:13,827
- Thanks for having me.
- All right.

1304
01:37:15,896 --> 01:37:18,398
<i>I, myself--</i>
<i>I'm going home and that's--</i>

1305
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:21,167
<i>That's a good place</i>
<i>to start.</i>

1306
01:38:00,107 --> 01:38:01,875
Come here.

1307
01:38:27,501 --> 01:38:30,336
<i>Beyond the ideas</i>
<i>of wrong-doings</i>

1308
01:38:30,338 --> 01:38:34,107
<i>And right-doings</i>
<i>is a field.</i>

1309
01:38:35,309 --> 01:38:37,410
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>

1310
01:38:38,305 --> 01:39:38,931
