2
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,835
Do you find me sadistic?

3
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:38,308
You know, I'll bet I could fry
an egg on your head right now.

4
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:40,393
If I wanted to.

5
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,607
You know, kiddo...

6
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:52,531
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

7
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:58,578
to know that there's nothing
sadistic in my actions.

8
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:04,042
Well, maybe towards
those other jokers.

9
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:08,463
But not you.

10
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:13,052
No, kiddo.

11
00:02:13,136 --> 00:02:14,929
At this moment...

12
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:23,646
This is me at my most
masochistic.

13
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:27,775
Bill, it's your baby.

14
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:44,333
# I was 5 and he was 6 #

15
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:48,213
# We rode on horses
made of sticks #

16
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:51,967
# He wore black
and I wore white #

17
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,886
# He would always win
the fight #

18
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:55,137
# Bang bang #

19
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,555
# He shot me down #

20
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:57,890
# Bang bang #

21
00:02:57,973 --> 00:03:00,184
# I hit the ground #

22
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,102
# Bang bang #

23
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:04,646
# That awful sound #

24
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,565
# Bang bang #

25
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:11,236
# My baby shot me down #

26
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:23,041
# Seasons came and changed
the time #

27
00:03:23,124 --> 00:03:27,545
# When I grew up,
I called him mine #

28
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,631
# He would always laugh
and say #

29
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:32,800
# "Remember when
we used to play?" #

30
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:35,261
# Bang bang #

31
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:36,554
# I shot you down #

32
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:38,473
# Bang bang #

33
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:39,724
# You hit the ground #

34
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,226
# Bang bang #

35
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:43,895
# That awful sound #

36
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:46,564
# Bang bang #

37
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:51,319
# I used to shoot you down #

38
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:03,332
# Music played
and people sang #

39
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:08,003
# Just for me
the church bells rang #

40
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:19,390
# Now he's gone #

41
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:22,059
# I don't know why #

42
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:26,939
# And till this day,
sometimes I cry #

43
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:29,191
# He didn't even say goodbye #

44
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:32,779
# He didn't take the time
to lie #

45
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:35,323
# Bang bang #

46
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:36,741
# He shot me down #

47
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:38,159
# Bang bang #

48
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:39,452
# I hit the ground #

49
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:42,247
# Bang bang #

50
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,416
# That awful sound #

51
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:47,377
# Bang bang #

52
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:55,260
# My baby shot me down #

53
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,603
Coming!

54
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:46,772
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

55
00:06:50,753 --> 00:06:53,715
What you gonna do now, huh?
What you got?

56
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,593
I got your ass!
Remember that? Huh? Remember?

57
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:08,105
Okay.
Come on, bitch.

58
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:12,359
Come on.
Bring it on.

59
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:52,984
Mommy, I'm home.

60
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,402
Hey, baby.

61
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:56,404
How was school?

62
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:01,117
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

63
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:03,245
Oh.

64
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,915
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his ass

65
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:08,334
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

66
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:11,086
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

67
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,464
Baby, now, you can't
come in here.

68
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:17,510
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

69
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:26,769
This is an old friend of mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

70
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:28,812
Hi, honey.

71
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,648
I'm

72
00:08:30,731 --> 00:08:32,483
What's your name?

73
00:08:35,444 --> 00:08:37,696
Her name is Nikki.

74
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:39,366
Nikki.

75
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:42,994
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

76
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:46,873
How old are you, Nikki?

77
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:53,672
Nikki, asked you
a question.

78
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:55,632
I'm 4.

79
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:58,260
4 years old, eh?

80
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:02,639
You know,
I had a little girl once.

81
00:09:04,099 --> 00:09:06,768
She'd be about 4 now.

82
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:13,484
Now, baby, me and Mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk

83
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:14,652
to talk about.

84
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:16,153
You can go in your room now.

85
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:19,240
And I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

86
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:21,158
Okay?

87
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,036
Nikkia!

88
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,372
In your room.
Now.

89
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:41,679
You want some coffee?

90
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:44,015
Yeah. Sure.

91
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,025
This Pasadena homemaker's name

92
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:54,192
is Jeanne Bell.

93
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:56,403
Her husband is
Dr. Lawrence Bell.

94
00:09:56,486 --> 00:09:59,489
But back when we were
acquainted, four years ago,

95
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:01,408
her name was Vernita Green.

96
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:04,494
Her code name was Copperhead.

97
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:06,330
Mine, Black Mamba.

98
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:07,998
Do you have a towel?

99
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:10,709
Yeah.

100
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:15,047
Thanks.

101
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,382
You still take cream and sugar?

102
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:19,009
Yeah.

103
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:24,098
So I suppose it's a little late
for an apology.

104
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:26,476
You suppose correctly.

105
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,811
Look, bitch, I need to know

106
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,564
if you're gonna start more shit
around my baby girl.

107
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:33,816
You can relax for now.

108
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:38,655
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

109
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:41,282
That's being more rational

110
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:43,660
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

111
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:47,914
It's mercy, compassion
and forgiveness I lack.

112
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:50,124
Not rationality.

113
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:56,214
Look.

114
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:59,843
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.

115
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,346
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.

116
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:05,307
You have every right
to want to get even.

117
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:07,726
No, no, no, no, no.

118
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,144
No.

119
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:12,815
To get even, even Stephen,

120
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:19,113
I would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

121
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:24,118
then wait for your husband
to come home and kill him.

122
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:26,620
That'd be even, Vernita.

123
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:28,914
That'd be about square.

124
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:32,000
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

125
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:33,628
But I can't.

126
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:38,007
All I can tell you is that I'm
a different person now.

127
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:42,053
Oh, great.
I don't care.

128
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:43,722
Be that as it may,

129
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:46,850
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

130
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:51,312
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

131
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:54,899
Bitch, you can stop right there.

132
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:58,069
Just because I have no wish
to murder you

133
00:11:58,153 --> 00:11:59,821
before the eyes of your daughter

134
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:02,490
does not mean parading her
around in front of me

135
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:05,285
is gonna inspire sympathy.

136
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:08,371
You and I have
unfinished business.

137
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:10,666
And not a goddamn fucking thing
you've done

138
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,251
in the subsequent four years,

139
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:16,547
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

140
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:19,967
So when do we do this?

141
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,927
It all depends.

142
00:12:22,011 --> 00:12:24,847
When do you wanna die?

143
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,683
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?

144
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:29,268
How about tonight, bitch?

145
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:31,562
Splendid.
Where?

146
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:34,398
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach little league

147
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:35,775
about a mile from here.

148
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:38,194
We meet there around 2:30
in the morning,

149
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:42,281
dressed all in black,
your hair in a black stocking.

150
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:44,868
And we have us a knife fight.

151
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,912
We won't be bothered.

152
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:52,125
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.

153
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:03,136
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw

154
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,554
with an edged weapon.

155
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:06,973
Fuck you, bitch.

156
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:09,351
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.

157
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:13,730
So you can just kiss my
motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

158
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:15,649
Black Mamba.

159
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:18,610
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

160
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:19,862
Weapon of choice?

161
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:22,698
If you wanna stick with your
butcher knife, that's fine.

162
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:26,911
Very funny, bitch.

163
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:28,746
Very funny!

164
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:30,184
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

165
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:34,397
For that, I'm sorry.

166
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,317
But you can take my word for it.

167
00:14:40,236 --> 00:14:42,780
Your mother had it coming.

168
00:14:57,503 --> 00:15:04,595
When you grow up, if you still
feel raw about it...

169
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:09,850
I'll be waiting.

170
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:16,273
For those regarded as warriors...

171
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:18,692
When engaged in combat...

172
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:24,406
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.

173
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:32,039
Suppress all human emotion and compassion...

174
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:43,385
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.

175
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:55,563
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.

176
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:22,258
Come on out to Dallas.

177
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:26,512
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

178
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:28,723
And next, we got some record.

179
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:31,934
Very own wild man,
Charlie Feathers.

180
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,481
# Well #

181
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:47,533
# I'm just a single fellow
with a lot on my mind #

182
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:50,287
# And I'm lookin' for me
a woman #

183
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,581
# But she's mighty hard
to find #

184
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:55,333
# Asked my country cousin #

185
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,919
# Checked the hottest spots
in town #

186
00:16:58,003 --> 00:17:00,630
# Oh, that little bitty woman #

187
00:17:06,928 --> 00:17:12,100
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.

188
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:14,770
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

189
00:17:15,937 --> 00:17:19,566
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.

190
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:23,487
Give me a figure.

191
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,364
Nine dead bodies.

192
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:27,992
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

193
00:17:28,076 --> 00:17:30,912
Bride. Groom.

194
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:32,705
Reverend.

195
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:35,249
Reverend's wife.

196
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:39,295
They even shot that old colored
fella that plays the organ.

197
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:41,839
It would appear
somebody objected to this

198
00:17:41,923 --> 00:17:44,801
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.

199
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:52,934
Good gravy, Marie.

200
00:17:58,106 --> 00:17:59,899
What'd I tell you, Pop?

201
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:03,153
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

202
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:06,031
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

203
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:07,699
You're in a house of worship.

204
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:09,368
Sorry, Pop.

205
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,956
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

206
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:18,043
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.

207
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:21,463
Four, maybe five strong.

208
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:23,590
How can you tell?

209
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:26,343
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.

210
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:30,472
This ain't no
squirrelly amateur.

211
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:33,684
This is the work of a salty dog.

212
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:36,646
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.

213
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:40,358
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

214
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:43,736
all the colors are kept
inside the lines.

215
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,324
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

216
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,462
Who's the bride?

217
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:03,006
Don't know.

218
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:05,008
The name
on the marriage certificate

219
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:07,969
is Arlene Machiavelli.

220
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:09,345
That's a fake.

221
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:11,515
We've been calling her
"The Bride"

222
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,100
on account of the dress.

223
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:16,187
You can tell she was pregnant.

224
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,980
Man would have to be a mad dog

225
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:21,775
to shoot a goddamn good-looking
gal like that in the head.

226
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:25,738
Look at her.

227
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:32,578
Hay-colored hair.
Big eyes.

228
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:35,414
She's a little
blood-spattered בngel.

229
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:40,878
Son Number One?

230
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:42,129
Yeah?

231
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:46,760
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

232
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:24,088
I might never have liked you.

233
00:22:25,547 --> 00:22:28,801
Point in fact, I despise you.

234
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,139
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

235
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:40,562
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

236
00:22:40,646 --> 00:22:43,650
that our kind
is rarely afforded.

237
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:47,070
My gift to you.

238
00:22:53,827 --> 00:22:55,578
For fuck's sake.

239
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,500
Hello, Bill.

240
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:04,170
What's her condition?

241
00:23:04,254 --> 00:23:06,423
Comatose.

242
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:08,716
Where is she?

243
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,053
I'm standing over her right now.

244
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:14,222
That's my girl.

245
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:19,562
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.

246
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:20,855
What?

247
00:23:20,938 --> 00:23:22,523
We owe her better than that.

248
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:24,358
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

249
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:26,068
Will you keep your voice down?

250
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:28,028
You don't owe her shit!

251
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:30,197
May I say one thing?

252
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:32,116
Speak.

253
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:35,202
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.

254
00:23:35,286 --> 00:23:37,163
But you didn't kill her.

255
00:23:37,246 --> 00:23:39,206
And I put a bullet in her head.

256
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,460
But her heart
just kept on beating.

257
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:44,128
Now, you saw that yourself

258
00:23:44,211 --> 00:23:49,008
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?

259
00:23:49,884 --> 00:23:53,388
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.

260
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:58,977
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

261
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,979
But one thing we won't do

262
00:24:01,062 --> 00:24:05,442
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat

263
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:08,403
and kill her in her sleep.

264
00:24:09,488 --> 00:24:12,157
And the reason
we won't do that thing

265
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,162
is because that thing
would lower us.

266
00:24:17,245 --> 00:24:19,623
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

267
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,834
I guess.

268
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:25,420
Do you really have to guess?

269
00:24:25,545 --> 00:24:27,590
No.

270
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:31,427
I don't really have to guess.
I know.

271
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,056
Come on home, honey.

272
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:38,434
Affirmative.

273
00:24:39,602 --> 00:24:41,812
I love you very much.

274
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:43,940
I love you, too.

275
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,611
Bye-bye.

276
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,209
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

277
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,382
Word of advice, shithead.

278
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,510
Don't you ever wake up.

279
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:53,011
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

280
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:56,264
Bill, it's your baby.

281
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:01,915
Oh, my baby.

282
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:29,610
Four years.

283
00:27:29,694 --> 00:27:31,278
Four years.

284
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:03,311
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.

285
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:05,313
You getting your freak on
or what?

286
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:07,232
Oh, yeah, boy.

287
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:13,572
20, 40, 60, 75.

288
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:15,615
Yeah.
Now here's the rules.

289
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:17,409
Rule number one.

290
00:28:17,492 --> 00:28:18,577
No punching her.

291
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,454
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner

292
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:22,080
or less some teeth, jig's up.

293
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:24,541
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

294
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:26,626
And by the way,
this cunt's a spitter.

295
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,088
It's a motor-reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.

296
00:28:30,172 --> 00:28:33,176
- Now, are clear on rule one?
- Yeah.

297
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:36,387
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites, no hickeys.

298
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:39,098
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.

299
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:42,310
After that,
it's all good, buddy.

300
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:44,479
Now, her plumbing down there
don't work.

301
00:28:44,562 --> 00:28:46,147
So feel free to come in her
all you want.

302
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,107
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.

303
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:49,942
I'll be back in 20.

304
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,528
Yeah.

305
00:28:52,612 --> 00:28:54,363
Oh, shit.

306
00:28:54,447 --> 00:28:56,949
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes

307
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:59,619
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

308
00:28:59,702 --> 00:29:03,122
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

309
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:06,083
Bon appetit, good buddy.

310
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:18,180
Oh, yeah.

311
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,266
Oh, God damn.

312
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,977
You are the best-looking girl
I've had today.

313
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:15,405
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.

314
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:17,156
Coming in, ready or not.

315
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,910
Hey buddy, did you have
yourself a good time?

316
00:30:52,526 --> 00:30:54,070
Where's Bill?

317
00:30:54,696 --> 00:30:56,781
Where's Bill?

318
00:30:57,949 --> 00:30:59,242
Please stop hitting me.

319
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,493
Where's Bill?

320
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,622
I don't know who Bill is!

321
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:05,206
Bullshit!

322
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:16,676
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?

323
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,930
Jane Doe, huh? We don't know
shit about you, do we?

324
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:21,973
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

325
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:25,852
My name is Buck,
and I'm here to fuck.

326
00:31:29,315 --> 00:31:31,943
Your name is Buck.

327
00:31:32,026 --> 00:31:33,611
Right?

328
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:36,948
And you came here to fuck.

329
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:38,366
Right?

330
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:40,493
Wait a minute.
Wait.

331
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:08,021
"Pussy Wagon."

332
00:32:08,105 --> 00:32:09,982
You fucker.

333
00:32:37,134 --> 00:32:40,138
Texas. Okay.

334
00:34:25,746 --> 00:34:28,541
Wiggle your big toe.

335
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:35,881
Wiggle your big toe.

336
00:34:42,972 --> 00:34:45,683
Wiggle your big toe.

337
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,274
Wiggle your big toe.

338
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,990
Wiggle your big toe.

339
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:02,284
As I lay in the back
of Buck's truck,

340
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:05,078
trying to will my limbs
out of entropy...

341
00:35:05,162 --> 00:35:06,830
Wiggle your big toe.

342
00:35:06,913 --> 00:35:10,834
...I could see the faces of
the cunts who did this to me.

343
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:13,795
And the dicks responsible.

344
00:35:15,088 --> 00:35:20,260
Members all of the Deadly Viper
Assassination Squad.

345
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:24,347
When fortune smiles
on something

346
00:35:24,431 --> 00:35:26,683
as violent and ugly as revenge,

347
00:35:26,766 --> 00:35:30,896
it seems proof like no other
that not only does God exist,

348
00:35:30,979 --> 00:35:33,106
you're doing his will.

349
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,776
At a time when I knew the least
about my enemies,

350
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,945
the first name
on my death list,

351
00:35:38,029 --> 00:35:41,782
O-Ren Ishii,
was the easiest to find.

352
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:44,452
But when one
manages the difficult task

353
00:35:44,535 --> 00:35:46,996
of becoming queen
of the Tokio underworld,

354
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:50,249
one doesn't keep it a secret,
does one?

355
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:07,391
O-Ren Ishii was born
on an American military base

356
00:36:07,475 --> 00:36:09,560
in Tokio, Japan.

357
00:36:09,644 --> 00:36:13,065
The half-Japanese, half-Chinese
American Army brat

358
00:36:13,148 --> 00:36:16,485
made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9.

359
00:36:16,568 --> 00:36:18,862
It was at that age
she witnessed

360
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:20,822
the death of her parents
at the hands

361
00:36:20,906 --> 00:36:26,578
of Japan's most ruthless
yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.

362
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:43,030
Mommy.

363
00:40:52,602 --> 00:40:54,896
She swore revenge.

364
00:40:54,979 --> 00:41:00,109
Luckily for her,
Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.

365
00:41:02,237 --> 00:41:06,157
At 11, she got her revenge.

366
00:41:08,868 --> 00:41:13,206
Look at me, Matsumoto...

367
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:18,211
...take a good look at my face.

368
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:22,298
Look at my eyes.

369
00:41:24,842 --> 00:41:27,096
Look at my mouth.

370
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:29,557
Do I look familiar?

371
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:34,395
Do I look like somebody...

372
00:41:34,478 --> 00:41:36,647
you murdered?!

373
00:42:49,388 --> 00:42:54,393
By 20, she was one of the top
female assassins in the world.

374
00:43:41,817 --> 00:43:44,653
At 25, she did her part
in the killing

375
00:43:44,736 --> 00:43:49,200
of nine innocent people,
including my unborn daughter,

376
00:43:49,283 --> 00:43:54,163
in a small wedding chapel
in El Paso, Texas.

377
00:43:54,247 --> 00:44:01,879
But on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake.

378
00:44:01,963 --> 00:44:04,590
She should have killed 10.

379
00:44:05,216 --> 00:44:09,429
However, before satisfaction
would be mine,

380
00:44:09,512 --> 00:44:11,723
first things first.

381
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:14,809
Wiggle your big toe.

382
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:23,819
Hard part's over.

383
00:44:23,902 --> 00:44:27,990
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.

384
00:45:02,484 --> 00:45:04,569
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?

385
00:45:04,652 --> 00:45:06,946
Okinawa.
One-way.

386
00:45:33,974 --> 00:45:35,100
Hi.

387
00:45:35,184 --> 00:45:37,520
Welcome...

388
00:45:41,607 --> 00:45:43,526
Welcome.

389
00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:46,737
You English?

390
00:45:46,862 --> 00:45:49,198
Almost.
American.

391
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:52,952
American.
Welcome, American.

392
00:45:53,035 --> 00:45:54,411
Domo.

393
00:45:54,495 --> 00:45:57,122
My English very good.

394
00:45:57,206 --> 00:45:58,790
You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?

395
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:00,459
You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?

396
00:46:00,543 --> 00:46:01,627
No, no.

397
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,588
Just a few words I learned
since yesterday.

398
00:46:04,672 --> 00:46:07,258
Um, may I sit at the bar?

399
00:46:07,341 --> 00:46:09,761
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please, sit.

400
00:46:13,682 --> 00:46:16,518
What other words did you learn?

401
00:46:16,601 --> 00:46:18,562
Oh, just a minute.

402
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:23,149
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.

403
00:46:23,233 --> 00:46:26,152
I'm watching my soap operas.

404
00:46:26,236 --> 00:46:29,698
Lazy bastard...

405
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:31,700
Screw your soap opera... Hurry up!

406
00:46:31,783 --> 00:46:33,159
The tea's hot.

407
00:46:33,243 --> 00:46:35,453
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?

408
00:46:35,537 --> 00:46:37,122
Shut up!

409
00:46:37,205 --> 00:46:39,958
Get your ass out here!

410
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:42,294
Uh, excuse me.

411
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:47,466
Uh, what other Japanese
do you know?

412
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:48,759
Oh, let's see.

413
00:46:48,843 --> 00:46:50,720
Um, "arigato."

414
00:46:50,803 --> 00:46:53,264
"Arigato."
Good!

415
00:46:53,347 --> 00:46:57,268
Um, I already said "domo,"
right?

416
00:46:57,351 --> 00:46:59,896
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

417
00:46:59,979 --> 00:47:01,105
"Konn-itch-iwa."

418
00:47:02,815 --> 00:47:04,734
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."

419
00:47:04,817 --> 00:47:06,235
Konnichi wa.
Please repeat.

420
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,737
Konnichi wa.

421
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,030
Perfect.

422
00:47:09,113 --> 00:47:10,698
Good, good, good.

423
00:47:10,781 --> 00:47:13,618
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.

424
00:47:13,701 --> 00:47:15,244
Oh, you're making fun of me!

425
00:47:15,328 --> 00:47:17,915
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.

426
00:47:17,998 --> 00:47:21,126
Pronunciation very good.

427
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:25,797
You say arigato
like we say arigato.

428
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:32,095
Well, thank you.
I mean, arigato.

429
00:47:33,722 --> 00:47:36,141
You should learn Japanese.

430
00:47:36,224 --> 00:47:38,226
Very easy.

431
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,354
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.

432
00:47:40,437 --> 00:47:42,439
Most difficult.

433
00:47:42,522 --> 00:47:45,484
But you have Japanese tongue.

434
00:47:47,945 --> 00:47:49,529
Okay, okay.

435
00:47:52,115 --> 00:47:56,120
Oh.
Oh, my God.

436
00:47:56,204 --> 00:48:02,669
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea.
Hurry up... goddammit!

437
00:48:06,422 --> 00:48:10,176
Lazy oaf...

438
00:48:14,597 --> 00:48:17,308
What d'ya want?

439
00:48:17,392 --> 00:48:18,851
I beg your pardon?

440
00:48:18,935 --> 00:48:22,146
Uh, drink.

441
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,439
Oh, yes.

442
00:48:23,523 --> 00:48:26,025
A bottle of warm sake, please.

443
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:27,902
Warm sake?

444
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:29,822
Very good!

445
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:31,490
One warm sake!

446
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:34,576
Sake? In the middle of the day?

447
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:39,456
- Day, night, afternoon -
Who gives a damn- Get the sake!

448
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,167
How come I always have to get the sake?

449
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:43,919
You listen well...

450
00:48:44,044 --> 00:48:47,172
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.

451
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:49,466
If this were the military,

452
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:53,095
I'd be General by now.

453
00:48:53,178 --> 00:48:55,931
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

454
00:48:56,056 --> 00:48:59,810
If you were General, I'd be Emperor,

455
00:48:59,893 --> 00:49:02,061
and you'd still get the sake -

456
00:49:02,062 --> 00:49:04,733
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake.

457
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:05,859
Do you understand?

458
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,944
I'm not bald, okay? I shaved my head.

459
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,904
Do you understand me?

460
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,826
Sorry.

461
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:20,123
Oh! Oh, oh.
First time in Japan?

462
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:21,583
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

463
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:24,878
What brings you to Okinawa?

464
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,713
I came to see a man.

465
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:29,382
Oh, yeah.

466
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,385
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?

467
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,054
Not quite.

468
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,847
Not friend?

469
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,265
I never met him.

470
00:49:37,348 --> 00:49:39,143
Never?

471
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,395
Who is he?

472
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,813
May I ask?

473
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,442
Hattori Hanzo.

474
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:01,665
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

475
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,961
I need Japanese steel.

476
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,342
Why do you need Japanese steel?

477
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,764
I have vermin to kill.

478
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:24,523
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

479
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,777
Huge.

480
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:58,702
May I?

481
00:51:58,785 --> 00:52:00,538
You may.

482
00:52:03,416 --> 00:52:04,918
Wait.

483
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:07,545
Try the second one down.

484
00:53:00,474 --> 00:53:02,434
Funny.

485
00:53:02,518 --> 00:53:04,979
You like samurai swords.

486
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:10,443
I like baseball.

487
00:53:17,867 --> 00:53:21,538
I wanted to show you these.

488
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:23,540
However...

489
00:53:23,623 --> 00:53:27,877
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...

490
00:53:28,295 --> 00:53:34,217
...I no longer make instruments of death.

491
00:53:34,301 --> 00:53:36,094
What I have here...

492
00:53:36,928 --> 00:53:42,934
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

493
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:48,649
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

494
00:53:52,361 --> 00:53:56,032
...I have retired.

495
00:54:03,956 --> 00:54:06,125
Then give me one of these.

496
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:08,544
These are not for sale.

497
00:54:09,754 --> 00:54:12,131
I didn't say "sell me."

498
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:14,133
I said "give me."

499
00:54:16,218 --> 00:54:19,473
Why should I help you?

500
00:54:19,598 --> 00:54:24,436
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

501
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:30,442
And considering the student,

502
00:54:30,525 --> 00:54:35,655
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.

503
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,715
You can sleep here.

504
00:55:34,758 --> 00:55:37,136
It will take me a month...

505
00:55:39,763 --> 00:55:41,432
...to make the sword.

506
00:55:42,558 --> 00:55:45,310
I suggest you spend it practicing.

507
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:15,820
I've completed doing...

508
00:57:17,155 --> 00:57:21,576
...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,

509
00:57:23,537 --> 00:57:26,831
...to never do again.

510
00:57:29,709 --> 00:57:33,088
I have created "something that kills people."

511
00:57:35,173 --> 00:57:41,304
And in that purpose, I was a success.

512
00:57:43,932 --> 00:57:46,393
I've done this because philosophically,

513
00:57:47,435 --> 00:57:53,025
I am sympathetic to your aim.

514
00:57:56,028 --> 00:58:01,701
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

515
00:58:02,618 --> 00:58:06,205
If on your journey, you should encounter God...

516
00:58:06,289 --> 00:58:09,458
...God will be cut.

517
00:58:21,762 --> 00:58:24,682
Yellow-haired warrior...

518
00:58:24,765 --> 00:58:27,352
Go.

519
00:58:27,436 --> 00:58:29,313
Domo.

520
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,920
It was one year after
the massacre in El Paso, Texas

521
00:58:54,004 --> 00:58:56,006
that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny

522
00:58:56,089 --> 00:58:58,342
financially
and philosophically in her

523
00:58:58,425 --> 00:59:00,803
Shakespearian-in-magnitude
power struggle

524
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:02,347
with the other yakuza clans

525
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:06,476
over who would rule vice
in the city of Tokio.

526
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,853
When the final sword
was sheathed,

527
00:59:08,936 --> 00:59:12,023
it was O-Ren Ishii
and her powerful posse...

528
00:59:13,274 --> 00:59:16,569
...the Crazy 88,
that proved the victor.

529
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,948
The pretty lady
to O-Ren's right,

530
00:59:21,032 --> 00:59:23,576
who's dressed like
she's a villain on "Star Trek,"

531
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,121
is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.

532
00:59:27,205 --> 00:59:31,876
The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale.

533
00:59:31,959 --> 00:59:35,296
Another former protegee
of Bill's.

534
00:59:37,758 --> 00:59:39,968
The young girl
in the school-girl uniform

535
00:59:40,052 --> 00:59:45,349
is O-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.

536
00:59:45,432 --> 00:59:48,894
Gogo may be young,
but what she lacks in age,

537
00:59:48,977 --> 00:59:51,438
she makes up for in madness.

538
00:59:51,522 --> 00:59:53,565
Do you like Ferraris?

539
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:59,488
Ferrari... ltalian trash.

540
01:00:08,956 --> 01:00:10,624
Do you want to screw me?

541
01:00:12,127 --> 01:00:15,839
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?

542
01:00:16,756 --> 01:00:18,216
Yes.

543
01:00:21,636 --> 01:00:23,638
How 'bout now, big boy?

544
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:27,183
Do you still wish to penetrate me...

545
01:00:29,144 --> 01:00:31,019
...or is it I...

546
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,189
...or is it I... who has penetrated you?

547
01:00:34,315 --> 01:00:36,401
See what I mean?

548
01:00:37,819 --> 01:00:42,407
The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,

549
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:46,912
the head general of O-Ren's
personal army, the Crazy 88.

550
01:00:48,664 --> 01:00:50,958
And just in case
you were wondering

551
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:54,920
how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American

552
01:00:55,004 --> 01:00:59,800
become the boss of all bosses
in Tokio, Japan,

553
01:00:59,884 --> 01:01:01,677
I'll tell you.

554
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:04,346
The subject of O-Ren's blood
and nationality

555
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:07,099
came up before the council
only once.

556
01:01:07,183 --> 01:01:12,104
The night O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.

557
01:01:12,188 --> 01:01:14,565
The man who seems bound
and determined

558
01:01:14,648 --> 01:01:17,109
to break the mood
is Boss Tanaka.

559
01:01:17,193 --> 01:01:20,029
And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...

560
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:25,869
Boss Tanaka!

561
01:01:25,952 --> 01:01:27,788
What's the meaning of this outburst?

562
01:01:27,871 --> 01:01:29,915
This is a time for celebration!

563
01:01:29,998 --> 01:01:33,293
And what exactly are we celebrating?

564
01:01:34,294 --> 01:01:36,546
The perversion of our illustrious council?

565
01:01:38,381 --> 01:01:41,635
Tanaka, have you gone mad?

566
01:01:41,718 --> 01:01:43,053
I will not tolerate this!

567
01:01:43,136 --> 01:01:45,722
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

568
01:01:46,473 --> 01:01:52,395
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

569
01:01:57,235 --> 01:01:59,403
My father...

570
01:01:59,487 --> 01:02:00,655
...along with yours,

571
01:02:00,738 --> 01:02:03,199
and along with yours,
started this council.

572
01:02:03,282 --> 01:02:04,700
And while...

573
01:02:04,784 --> 01:02:06,452
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...

574
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:08,454
...they weep in the afterlife...

575
01:02:09,038 --> 01:02:10,581
Shut up!

576
01:02:10,665 --> 01:02:12,917
...over the perversion committed today!

577
01:02:13,584 --> 01:02:16,504
Outrageous!

578
01:02:16,587 --> 01:02:18,798
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!

579
01:02:18,881 --> 01:02:20,174
Bastard!

580
01:02:20,967 --> 01:02:22,301
Fuck face!

581
01:02:22,385 --> 01:02:24,011
Gentlemen.

582
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:31,603
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

583
01:02:33,438 --> 01:02:38,026
By all means, allow him to express it.

584
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:43,198
I speak, of the perversion done to this
council,

585
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,785
...which I love...

586
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:48,704
...more than my own children,

587
01:02:49,496 --> 01:02:54,459
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!

588
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:21,321
So that you understand how serious I am...

589
01:03:21,404 --> 01:03:23,740
...I'm going to say this in English.

590
01:03:37,337 --> 01:03:39,756
As your leader...

591
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:41,758
I encourage you from time to time,

592
01:03:41,841 --> 01:03:45,846
and always in a respectful
manner, to question my logic.

593
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,181
If you're unconvinced

594
01:03:47,264 --> 01:03:49,725
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

595
01:03:49,808 --> 01:03:51,018
tell me so.

596
01:03:51,101 --> 01:03:52,728
But allow me to convince you.

597
01:03:52,811 --> 01:03:54,855
And I promise you,
right here and now,

598
01:03:54,939 --> 01:03:58,484
no subject will ever be taboo.

599
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:01,862
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

600
01:04:04,281 --> 01:04:05,741
The price you pay

601
01:04:05,824 --> 01:04:09,119
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage

602
01:04:09,203 --> 01:04:13,040
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.

603
01:04:13,123 --> 01:04:15,501
Just like this fucker here.

604
01:04:17,379 --> 01:04:20,382
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches

605
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:25,303
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!

606
01:04:27,389 --> 01:04:28,974
I didn't think so.

607
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:35,146
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

608
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:37,691
One ticket to Tokio, please.

609
01:07:12,432 --> 01:07:13,685
Moshi moshi.

610
01:08:49,574 --> 01:08:50,909
Hey!

611
01:08:53,078 --> 01:08:54,704
- Hey, yeah!
- Hey, yeah!

612
01:09:33,704 --> 01:09:35,747
Gogo.

613
01:11:49,717 --> 01:11:52,762
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to
any selfish demands they make.

614
01:11:52,846 --> 01:11:54,348
They demand ridiculous things.

615
01:11:54,432 --> 01:11:57,101
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?

616
01:11:57,184 --> 01:11:58,185
What's gonna happen?

617
01:11:58,269 --> 01:11:59,645
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

618
01:11:59,728 --> 01:12:01,564
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

619
01:12:01,647 --> 01:12:03,065
No, I don't want that.

620
01:12:50,447 --> 01:12:51,990
Yes, it's me.

621
01:12:55,702 --> 01:12:59,164
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

622
01:13:14,347 --> 01:13:17,308
Who do you remind me of?

623
01:13:18,351 --> 01:13:20,228
Charlie Brown!

624
01:13:21,354 --> 01:13:23,773
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.

625
01:13:23,856 --> 01:13:25,191
Charlie Brown.

626
01:13:25,274 --> 01:13:26,651
Four pepperoni pizzas.

627
01:13:26,734 --> 01:13:28,569
That's not on our menu...

628
01:13:28,653 --> 01:13:30,655
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!

629
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:34,742
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

630
01:13:36,077 --> 01:13:38,246
O-Ren Ishii!

631
01:13:39,372 --> 01:13:42,125
You and I have unfinished business!

632
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,553
Charlie Brown, beat it.

633
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:23,812
Miki.

634
01:15:41,665 --> 01:15:43,792
TEAR THE BITCH APART!

635
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:19,390
So, O-Ren, any more subordinates
for me to kill?

636
01:17:20,892 --> 01:17:22,769
Hi!

637
01:17:23,853 --> 01:17:25,813
Gogo, right?

638
01:17:26,773 --> 01:17:28,274
Bingo.

639
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:30,318
And you're Black Mamba.

640
01:17:32,028 --> 01:17:35,656
Our reputations precede us.

641
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:38,326
Don't they?

642
01:17:39,911 --> 01:17:45,208
Gogo, I know you feel you must
protect your mistress.

643
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:48,796
But I beg you.

644
01:17:48,879 --> 01:17:50,923
Walk away.

645
01:17:57,262 --> 01:17:59,264
You call that begging?

646
01:18:04,895 --> 01:18:08,232
You can beg better than that.

647
01:21:21,931 --> 01:21:23,891
Is that what I think it is?

648
01:21:23,975 --> 01:21:26,686
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

649
01:21:26,769 --> 01:21:34,068
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

650
01:21:34,944 --> 01:21:36,821
Silly rabbit.

651
01:21:37,321 --> 01:21:38,322
Trix are for...

652
01:21:38,406 --> 01:21:39,490
Kids.

653
01:26:01,635 --> 01:26:02,928
# I'm doin'#

654
01:26:03,012 --> 01:26:04,972
# Ain't nobody doin' but me #

655
01:26:05,055 --> 01:26:06,765
# Nobody but me #

656
01:26:06,849 --> 01:26:08,809
# Yes, I gonna philly,
I'm doin'? #

657
01:26:08,892 --> 01:26:11,145
# Ain't nobody doin' but me,
baby #

658
01:26:11,228 --> 01:26:12,563
# Nobody but me #

659
01:26:12,646 --> 01:26:15,649
# Well, let me tell you
nobody #

660
01:26:15,733 --> 01:26:18,485
# Nobody but me #

661
01:26:18,569 --> 01:26:20,446
# Well, let me tell you
nobody #

662
01:26:20,529 --> 01:26:21,989
# Nobody #

663
01:28:08,306 --> 01:28:12,894
This is what you get
for fucking around with yakuzas!

664
01:28:12,978 --> 01:28:14,855
Go home to your mother!

665
01:29:13,499 --> 01:29:16,335
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...

666
01:29:16,418 --> 01:29:19,171
...take them with you!

667
01:29:20,756 --> 01:29:22,257
However...

668
01:29:23,509 --> 01:29:27,596
...leave the limbs you've lost.

669
01:29:28,765 --> 01:29:32,268
They belong to me now.

670
01:29:36,731 --> 01:29:39,567
Except you, Sofie!

671
01:29:40,276 --> 01:29:43,446
You stay right where you are.

672
01:30:36,917 --> 01:30:39,421
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

673
01:30:43,842 --> 01:30:46,011
Where was it made?

674
01:30:47,512 --> 01:30:49,180
Okinawa.

675
01:30:50,724 --> 01:30:54,060
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

676
01:30:54,978 --> 01:30:57,147
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

677
01:30:57,230 --> 01:30:58,648
YOU LIE!

678
01:31:10,952 --> 01:31:13,663
Swords however, never get tired.

679
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:18,419
I hope you've saved your energy.

680
01:31:21,964 --> 01:31:23,716
If you haven't...

681
01:31:25,051 --> 01:31:27,637
...you might not last five minutes.

682
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:31,807
But as last looks go,

683
01:31:32,808 --> 01:31:34,810
you could do worse.

684
01:34:13,432 --> 01:34:18,103
Silly Caucasian girl
likes to play with samurai swords.

685
01:34:20,356 --> 01:34:23,234
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

686
01:34:26,362 --> 01:34:29,573
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

687
01:34:59,938 --> 01:35:01,648
Attack me...

688
01:35:02,566 --> 01:35:04,276
...with everything you have.

689
01:35:59,166 --> 01:36:02,085
For ridiculing you earlier...

690
01:36:04,546 --> 01:36:06,798
...I apologize.

691
01:36:15,098 --> 01:36:16,850
Accepted.

692
01:36:32,825 --> 01:36:34,327
Ready?

693
01:36:38,539 --> 01:36:40,291
Come on.

694
01:37:13,242 --> 01:37:22,543
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

695
01:39:28,422 --> 01:39:30,091
Sofie.

696
01:39:30,883 --> 01:39:32,635
Sofie.

697
01:39:32,718 --> 01:39:34,428
My Sofie.

698
01:39:34,512 --> 01:39:36,848
I'm so sorry.

699
01:39:39,976 --> 01:39:43,354
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

700
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:45,189
No more of that.

701
01:39:45,648 --> 01:39:47,441
But still...

702
01:39:47,525 --> 01:39:49,652
But still nothing.

703
01:39:51,654 --> 01:39:55,032
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

704
01:39:55,116 --> 01:39:58,035
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

705
01:39:59,078 --> 01:40:02,082
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

706
01:40:02,166 --> 01:40:04,293
The first reason is information.

707
01:40:04,376 --> 01:40:08,462
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!

708
01:40:08,463 --> 01:40:09,840
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.

709
01:40:11,216 --> 01:40:15,345
But I am gonna ask you
questions.

710
01:40:15,429 --> 01:40:19,474
And every time
you don't give me answers,

711
01:40:19,558 --> 01:40:22,060
I'm gonna cut something off.

712
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:28,859
And I promise you, they will be
things you will miss!

713
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:31,737
Give me your other arm!

714
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:38,369
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

715
01:40:38,453 --> 01:40:39,871
If you had to guess...

716
01:40:39,954 --> 01:40:41,414
What they've been doing.

717
01:40:41,497 --> 01:40:42,832
Why she left you alive...

718
01:40:42,916 --> 01:40:44,626
And where I can find them.

719
01:40:44,709 --> 01:40:47,503
What would be your guess?

720
01:40:48,504 --> 01:40:51,132
Guessing won't be necessary.

721
01:40:51,216 --> 01:40:53,301
She informed me.

722
01:40:55,637 --> 01:40:59,265
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

723
01:41:00,391 --> 01:41:01,893
As I said before,

724
01:41:01,976 --> 01:41:05,521
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

725
01:41:06,648 --> 01:41:11,946
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

726
01:41:12,029 --> 01:41:15,824
everything that happened
here tonight.

727
01:41:15,908 --> 01:41:19,245
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

728
01:41:19,328 --> 01:41:22,915
by witnessing
your deformed body.

729
01:41:22,998 --> 01:41:27,169
I want you to tell him all the
information you just told me.

730
01:41:27,253 --> 01:41:30,297
I want him to know what I know.

731
01:41:30,381 --> 01:41:34,593
I want him to know
I want him to know.

732
01:41:34,677 --> 01:41:37,096
And I want them all to know

733
01:41:37,179 --> 01:41:43,852
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

734
01:42:06,751 --> 01:42:12,340
Revenge is never a straight line.

735
01:42:15,051 --> 01:42:16,845
It's a forest.

736
01:42:17,804 --> 01:42:21,016
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

737
01:42:21,976 --> 01:42:25,396
...to get lost... to forget where you came in.

738
01:42:28,733 --> 01:42:32,570
That woman deserves her revenge.

739
01:42:37,783 --> 01:42:42,246
And we deserve to die.

740
01:42:45,624 --> 01:42:49,587
She must suffer
to her last breath.

741
01:43:02,351 --> 01:43:05,270
How did you find me?

742
01:43:05,354 --> 01:43:07,105
I'm the man.

743
01:43:11,026 --> 01:43:14,446
One more thing, Sofie.

744
01:43:14,529 --> 01:43:19,534
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?

745
01:43:20,305 --> 01:44:20,515
