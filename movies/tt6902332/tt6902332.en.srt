3
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:45,417
You're too young for my sister, Miguel.

4
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,417
She doesn't even know your name.

5
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,542
She will.

6
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:04,583
What are you doing? Finish your homework.

7
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,625
Dinner's almost ready.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,792
Complete.

9
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,333
Hello?

10
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:14,583
Rosa.

11
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,500
- You have to leave.
- What?

12
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,333
Take Miguel and go, now.

13
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,292
Wait, wait. What's going on?

14
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,833
The Cartel is after me. You have to go.

15
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:28,208
What about you?

16
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,625
Don't worry about me.

17
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,917
Just follow the plan.

18
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,625
Carlos, wait, what happened?

19
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,958
They'll want to set an example.

20
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:37,708
They'll come for you next.

21
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:42,250
Who was that, mama?

22
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:47,333
It was your uncle Carlos.

23
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,125
Bring your stuff. We need to leave.

24
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,667
If we don't find it...

25
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,833
What do we tell Angel?

26
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,042
We'll find it.

27
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:25,500
Mmm-hmm.

28
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:29,208
You cross the Cartel
Carlos, your family well pay.

29
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:35,725
Come on, Jackson.

30
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:57,183
Sorry, girl.

31
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,766
BP, this is Jim Hanson.

32
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:19,434
I've got four or five IAs

33
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:22,516
heading north out near my ranch,

34
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:24,184
about a half-mile from the fence.

35
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,225
Over.

36
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:29,475
Copy that, Jim.

37
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:30,975
Agents on the way.

38
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,833
Water.

39
00:05:57,058 --> 00:05:58,558
Easy. Easy.

40
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:03,058
Hanson here. Better send a medic out.

41
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,933
Found one left behind. Over.

42
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:08,808
You James Hanson?

43
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:10,975
Who's asking?

44
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:13,725
Carl Neeham, from Pima
County Merchants Bank.

45
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:19,683
It's a Notice of Trustee's sale.

46
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:22,433
Let you know that the ranch is
to be sold at auction in 90 days.

47
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:23,975
What?

48
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:25,767
Law requires you be notified.

49
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:28,391
I'd have called, but I couldn't
find a phone listing for you.

50
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:31,433
I was in last month, explained
my situation to Ned Fremont.

51
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:32,683
- He assured me...
- Yes, well,

52
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:34,100
Ned's no longer with us.

53
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:35,975
Not sure why he didn't follow it,

54
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:37,309
but bank policy is to take action

55
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,309
if there hasn't been a
payment in over six months.

56
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:42,558
You should also know, Mr. Hanson,

57
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,184
that the bank has the right to sell
the property before those 90 days

58
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:47,475
if it receives a reasonable
offer from a third party.

59
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:53,267
Uh...

60
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,059
Mr. Hanson?

61
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,558
That hill over there...

62
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:02,349
Spread my wife's ashes
on top of it last year.

63
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:07,100
I'm sorry for your loss.

64
00:08:07,142 --> 00:08:09,141
- Look, Mister...
- Neeham.

65
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,142
I'm no deadbeat.

66
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:14,808
I just a need a little time to
sort things out, get back on track.

67
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,225
Yeah, like I said, you've got
90 days, you know, most likely.

68
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:21,309
Um, my number's on there
if you have any questions.

69
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:23,808
You have yourself a good evening.

70
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:34,933
Frame's almost built, and I
got to watch my budget and all.

71
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,184
Anyway, don't you have a ranch to run?

72
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,767
Sold most of it off.

73
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:41,433
Down to the last few head of cattle.

74
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,683
Christine's medical bills wiped me out.

75
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,267
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

76
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:50,767
I can dig that hole for you.
It'll be done by sundown.

77
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:57,391
I wouldn't be asking if
I didn't need the job.

78
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:00,059
Look, Jim, that kind of
work is not for someone...

79
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:02,975
Someone my age? Come on, Randall.

80
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:04,725
You know I can outwork any man here.

81
00:09:05,642 --> 00:09:08,350
Listen, I got a new
project starting next month.

82
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:10,850
Come see me then, I'll see
what I can find for you, okay?

83
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,516
Yeah. Okay.

84
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,059
I was out your way last week.

85
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:23,934
Things are looking mighty lean.

86
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:25,100
Tell me about it.

87
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:28,225
At 70 cents per pound,

88
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:32,558
- we're talking 17 grand.
- Ah.

89
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:34,225
Could you make it 20?

90
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:37,642
There's not a lot of profit selling
underweight cattle, you know.

91
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:42,184
I'm sorry, Jim.

92
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:44,142
Let me know what you decide, buddy.

93
00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:14,184
Sorry to bother you, Sarah.
I thought you'd want to know.

94
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,642
I appreciate it, Angie.

95
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:18,683
Yeah. It's been a long time
since I've seen him here.

96
00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:25,350
Hey, there, stranger.

97
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:29,433
Hey, Sarah.

98
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:33,100
- This seat taken?
- It's for you.

99
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:35,350
Drink?

100
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,142
Mmm-mmm. No, thanks.

101
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,725
- Thanks for the call yesterday.
- Mmm.

102
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,517
A few more hours, that fella
would've been one for the coroner.

103
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:46,683
His lucky day, I guess.

104
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:50,183
Not sure he sees it that way.

105
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,017
Walked all the way from Honduras,

106
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,017
spent his life savings on a coyote

107
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:57,308
who left him in the middle of nowhere.

108
00:10:58,017 --> 00:10:59,475
All for naught.

109
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,850
Yeah, it's a cruel world.

110
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,225
That pass has kept us busy all week.

111
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:10,350
The cartels are running
everything through there.

112
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:12,517
Drugs, people, guns.

113
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:14,350
What else is new?

114
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:15,934
I worry about you,

115
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:19,767
out there on the front
lines, all by yourself.

116
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:24,017
It would be fine if the government
would get its shit together

117
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,767
and figure that mess out.

118
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:33,517
What is going on?

119
00:11:34,683 --> 00:11:35,934
What are you doing back here?

120
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,642
Been wondering that myself.

121
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:45,975
What the hell am I doing?

122
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:50,892
I guess I'm trying to understand

123
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:52,308
how you work your whole life,

124
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,892
serve your country, pay your taxes,

125
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:57,850
and end up without a pot to piss in.

126
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:01,642
Lost my home,

127
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:03,183
my livelihood,

128
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,141
and the only person that
made any of it worthwhile.

129
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:19,642
Come on, let's... let's get you back.

130
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:22,809
Come on.

131
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,183
There we go.

132
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:50,392
Leave it, Sarah. Just leave it.

133
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,850
Ah.

134
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:09,392
I like to remember her like this.

135
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:12,266
Smiling, laughing.

136
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:18,725
I've never seen my mom so happy
as the day she married you.

137
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,225
Wasn't right, her going
out the way she did.

138
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:25,308
Watching her suffer like that.

139
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:29,183
I couldn't imagine anything worse.

140
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:31,100
Now I know.

141
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:37,266
Come on.

142
00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:40,266
Let's get you to bed.

143
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,058
Come on, Pops.

144
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:49,433
Rest these old bones.

145
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,392
It wasn't right, Sarah.

146
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:04,600
I miss her, too.

147
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:06,141
Yeah?

148
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,392
Rest up.

149
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:15,642
Yeah.

150
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,417
Get down!

151
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:10,792
It's the Cartel.

152
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,208
They control this area.

153
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,208
We have to turn back.

154
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,458
We just got here! We're almost there!

155
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:23,083
If they find us here, I'm dead.

156
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,292
Let's go back

157
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,917
and we'll try on another day.

158
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,208
- Look, I'll pay more.
- It's not worth it.

159
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:32,458
Please! Please, get us across.

160
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,500
I beg of you, get us across.

161
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:36,833
Alright.

162
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,125
Just left of that bush

163
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,875
there's a break in the fence.

164
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,792
You want to risk it,

165
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,292
- you're on your own.
- No, no.

166
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:57,375
Let's go.

167
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,208
Let's go, let's go.

168
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:07,100
Who's the best dog in the world?

169
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,208
Mom.

170
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,208
Help me.

171
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,833
Hurry! Help me find the opening.

172
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:32,458
Here!

173
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,058
Who's a good boy?

174
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,684
Jackson is. Jackie...

175
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,100
Jeez.

176
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:11,142
Hey, hey! Wait, wait!

177
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:14,392
You're never going to make
it through there like that.

178
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,142
It's miles to the nearest road.

179
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,208
Do you understand?

180
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,559
You... You will help us?

181
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:22,684
I'll call the Border Patrol.

182
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,016
No! Sir, sir, sir, please! Please!

183
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:26,767
No. No Border Patrol.

184
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,808
I pay you.

185
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,142
What?

186
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,058
To help us, I pay you.

187
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,100
I'm not a smuggler, lady.

188
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:38,808
Border Patrol will help you out.

189
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,850
No! Listen, get you to a doctor.

190
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:42,808
Please, sir! No, no!

191
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,183
Please. Please!

192
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:50,975
Please!

193
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:53,016
Dispatch, this is Jim Hanson.

194
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,434
Go ahead, Jim.

195
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:57,891
I've got two IAs,

196
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:59,933
about a klick south of Stone Ridge.

197
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:03,016
Copy that.

198
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:04,517
We're spread thin right now.

199
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,808
It'll be a few.

200
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,850
Ten-four.

201
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:10,058
I'll get you some water.

202
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:10,833
Mom.

203
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:17,975
Jackson, stay.

204
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,167
Old man!

205
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,250
I am here for the women and the boy.

206
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:30,708
Speak in English.

207
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,308
I come here to take the woman and the boy.

208
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:39,891
Sorry, Pancho. These illegals are mine.

209
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:44,058
You are Border Patrol?

210
00:18:45,142 --> 00:18:46,308
Marine Corps.

211
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,808
So you are keeping your country safe

212
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,725
all by yourself, huh, Marine Corps?

213
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,850
Something like that.

214
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,267
I am a soldier, too.

215
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,891
My orders are to take them back with me.

216
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,267
You're no soldier.

217
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:14,183
And I don't scare easy.

218
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:17,308
Now I've already called the cavalry,

219
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,100
so I suggest y'all just
turn around and adiós.

220
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,350
I am not going to ask again.

221
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:32,475
The woman and the boy.

222
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:33,975
Hand them over.

223
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:40,725
This ain't worth it, boys.

224
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,559
Give them to me!

225
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,434
Get in the truck. Move.

226
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,958
Mom! Mom!

227
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,392
Oh, shit.

228
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:47,434
Stay down.

229
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:52,142
Jackson, quiet.

230
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:53,225
Jackson!

231
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,891
Dispatch, this is Hanson.

232
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,517
I've just taken heavy fire.

233
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,641
I've got a wounded...

234
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,375
Boss.

235
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:38,792
Your brother...

236
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,917
He's dead.

237
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:04,516
Okay, let's...

238
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:06,933
Nice and easy.

239
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:11,683
Sir...

240
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:14,725
They take him, they kill him.

241
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,808
No, look, those guys
are gone. They're gone.

242
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,309
No, please.

243
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,434
All I have...

244
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,808
It's yours... To help him.

245
00:22:26,516 --> 00:22:27,725
This...

246
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:30,683
My cousin...

247
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:32,933
In Chicago.

248
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,392
Please.

249
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:37,434
Mamá.

250
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,292
My love.

251
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:45,542
My love.

252
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:47,958
Come here.

253
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:55,125
You're going to stay with this man, OK?

254
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,583
Take this.

255
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,100
Sir...

256
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,392
Please.

257
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:10,850
Please.

258
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,184
Mamá.

259
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:15,600
Mamá.

260
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:02,892
It doesn't make sense.

261
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:05,184
No point trying to understand the cartels.

262
00:24:05,225 --> 00:24:06,641
Better just to avoid them.

263
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:09,017
What's going to happen to the kid?

264
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:12,808
Unaccompanied minors are
sent to holding in Nogales.

265
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:15,892
He most likely will end up in foster care.

266
00:24:19,184 --> 00:24:20,184
Diaz.

267
00:24:21,142 --> 00:24:22,600
What was the boy talking about?

268
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:27,641
He said if you hadn't stopped them,

269
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:29,267
his mother would still be alive.

270
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,850
Hey, he's just a kid.

271
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:43,350
Jim, I need you to come by the
station and make a statement.

272
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,767
Good boy, Jackson.

273
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:41,975
Good morning, babe.

274
00:25:45,475 --> 00:25:47,017
Get some grub, huh?

275
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,558
Let's get some grub.

276
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,142
Good boy.

277
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:16,433
All I have is yours.

278
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:18,475
They take him, they kill him.

279
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:20,059
Please. Please.

280
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,350
God damn it!

281
00:28:12,183 --> 00:28:16,266
Denny, that kid whose
mother died last night,

282
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:18,517
has he been sent on to Nogales yet?

283
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:20,850
No, he's being deported.

284
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:22,059
What?

285
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,225
Mexican authorities say he's got a relative

286
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:25,850
waiting for him on the other side.

287
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,767
Uh, I need to see him.

288
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,225
Sorry, Jim, can't do that.

289
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:33,767
Just a few minutes.

290
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:35,266
I already cleared it with Sarah.

291
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:36,433
Call her and check.

292
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,059
- Make it quick.
- Thanks.

293
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,767
Psst! Hey, come on.

294
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,059
You're not safe here, comprende?

295
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,809
Let's go, come on.

296
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:41,100
Come on.

297
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:05,892
Hey.

298
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,958
Tell the others, we're crossing.

299
00:30:48,392 --> 00:30:50,642
Stay here, understand?

300
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,475
Come on, Jackson. Come on.

301
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,558
God damn it.

302
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,058
Gentlemen.

303
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,058
Passports and visas, please.

304
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:54,517
Open the back, please.

305
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,308
All clear!

306
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:21,083
Go ahead.

307
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,725
- What the hell you doing?
- Let me go.

308
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:46,350
Listen to me or you're
going to get yourself killed.

309
00:32:46,392 --> 00:32:48,725
They send you back, those
men are there waiting for you.

310
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,500
Understand?

311
00:32:50,308 --> 00:32:52,183
Come on.

312
00:33:25,225 --> 00:33:26,809
What?

313
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:32,433
I'm doing what your mother asked.

314
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:35,016
I'm taking you to your family in Chicago.

315
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,725
You know, Chicago?

316
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,667
Family.

317
00:33:44,142 --> 00:33:47,141
Hell, you don't understand
a damn word I'm saying.

318
00:36:02,808 --> 00:36:05,100
Hey, you hungry?

319
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,850
Thirsty?

320
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:10,392
Food. Uh...

321
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,642
Comida.

322
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:12,891
Yeah?

323
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,350
Mmm...

324
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:26,725
Hey. What's the matter?
You got to be hungry.

325
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:47,309
That's what I thought.

326
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,183
- Hey.
- Hello.

327
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:40,517
I need to buy an atlas.

328
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,058
- A what?
- An atlas.

329
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:45,142
Like a map book. With all the states.

330
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:49,850
Uh, you could try looking on
that bottom left shelf over there.

331
00:37:50,808 --> 00:37:53,017
We don't really sell maps much anymore.

332
00:37:53,058 --> 00:37:55,766
Everyone pretty much just
googles it on their phone.

333
00:37:56,892 --> 00:37:58,434
Hey, hey!

334
00:37:59,017 --> 00:38:00,058
Huh!

335
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,225
My lucky day.

336
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:02,267
How about that?

337
00:38:04,058 --> 00:38:05,683
You going on a road trip?

338
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:07,309
Yeah, something like that.

339
00:38:08,892 --> 00:38:10,392
There's no price on this.

340
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:12,392
It's probably outdated.

341
00:38:12,434 --> 00:38:14,183
You can have it on the house.

342
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,725
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

343
00:38:17,017 --> 00:38:18,808
Thank you.

344
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:20,683
- Have a good one.
- You, too.

345
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:43,958
- Find this guy.
- OK.

346
00:39:08,558 --> 00:39:09,766
Sarah Reynolds.

347
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:11,058
Sarah, it's Jim.

348
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,017
Thank God.

349
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,725
You all right?

350
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:16,017
Yeah, I'm fine.

351
00:39:16,058 --> 00:39:18,225
Just called to tell you not to worry.

352
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:20,600
What the hell were you
thinking, taking that kid?

353
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,683
They were going to kill him,
the ones who killed his mother.

354
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:26,058
They were waiting for him at the border.

355
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,766
So you don't come to me
with that information?

356
00:39:28,808 --> 00:39:30,600
You just take him and leave?

357
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:33,267
Christ, Jim, you put
my ass on the line here.

358
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:37,766
I can only keep this
thing quiet for so long.

359
00:39:38,892 --> 00:39:40,683
I need you to bring back that kid.

360
00:39:40,975 --> 00:39:42,058
Now.

361
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,892
I... I can't do that.

362
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:45,309
Why not?

363
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,267
His mom, she...

364
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:48,933
We made, like, a deal.

365
00:39:49,392 --> 00:39:51,184
Jim...

366
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:53,433
Listen.

367
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,142
We sent agents up to your house.

368
00:39:56,184 --> 00:39:58,058
It was burned to the ground.

369
00:39:58,558 --> 00:40:01,892
Whoever these guys were at the
border, they're not messing around.

370
00:40:02,184 --> 00:40:04,142
Now tell me where the hell you are.

371
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:06,558
I'll call you later.

372
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:08,433
Jim...

373
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:15,683
God damn it!

374
00:40:16,267 --> 00:40:19,100
Why the hell did you
have to cross my property?

375
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:22,142
You damn well ought to
appreciate what I'm doing for you.

376
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:27,600
I don't even want to be
in your stupid country.

377
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:37,142
Well, well, well. He speaks.

378
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:41,142
Hey, Jackson, you hear that?

379
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:44,750
Hey, got something.

380
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:52,042
He just used his card at
a gas station in New Mexico

381
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:53,500
half an hour ago.

382
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:55,958
Load the gear, let's go.

383
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:01,683
I want to go home.

384
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,808
Look, it's not safe for you there.

385
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,516
Why are you doing this?

386
00:41:07,558 --> 00:41:09,433
Because your mother asked me to help.

387
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:11,683
Why did you call the Border Patrol on us?

388
00:41:11,725 --> 00:41:14,309
Because I didn't want to
find your bodies on my land.

389
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:17,225
If you want to help me,
you could take me back.

390
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:18,892
I'll find my own way home.

391
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:22,017
I'm taking you to your family in Chicago.

392
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:24,433
After that, I don't
give a shit what you do.

393
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:29,516
Look...

394
00:41:30,225 --> 00:41:34,017
It may not seem like it right
now, but this is what's best.

395
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:39,059
And I'm sorry.

396
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:42,184
I'm sorry what happened
to your mom and all.

397
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:50,017
Shit.

398
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:10,600
I gotta go, Mom. Bye.

399
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,125
Do you speak Spanish, queen?

400
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,225
No, sorry.

401
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:18,267
Mmm.

402
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:24,516
I come here looking for a man and a boy.

403
00:42:25,558 --> 00:42:27,516
And they drive a, uh...

404
00:42:28,308 --> 00:42:29,350
Truck... Tsk!

405
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:31,225
A pickup truck.

406
00:42:31,266 --> 00:42:32,558
Yeah, he was here.

407
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:34,558
He was on a road trip.

408
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,850
You know where?

409
00:42:36,184 --> 00:42:37,350
No, sorry.

410
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:44,350
Do you know, um, which direction he go?

411
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:45,642
I didn't notice.

412
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:47,391
Sorry.

413
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:48,433
Oh.

414
00:42:53,516 --> 00:42:55,017
Was he here?

415
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:57,184
That's not... That's not
really what that's for...

416
00:43:07,475 --> 00:43:08,642
Show me.

417
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:37,917
We're heading Northeast.

418
00:43:50,516 --> 00:43:52,017
This is just about dry.

419
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:53,808
You're lucky the block didn't crack.

420
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,517
You see, it's leaking around the core. Hmm.

421
00:43:56,558 --> 00:43:58,600
There's something lodged in here.

422
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:00,517
Looks like a slug.

423
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,017
Someone using your truck
for target practice?

424
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,892
Yeah, something like that.
Can you replace the radiator?

425
00:44:07,934 --> 00:44:09,308
Yeah, sure.

426
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,934
Take a day or two to get the part.

427
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,892
We can't wait around that long.

428
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:15,475
I wouldn't drive it the way it
is. You could blow your engine.

429
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:19,142
I suppose I could probably
patch it temporarily

430
00:44:19,183 --> 00:44:21,517
so that you could get where you are going.

431
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:22,725
Great.

432
00:44:23,308 --> 00:44:25,308
- See you tomorrow.
- What?

433
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,892
It's after 6:00. We're closed.

434
00:44:31,642 --> 00:44:33,266
Pima County Merchants Bank.

435
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:35,266
You may enter an extension at any time.

436
00:44:37,183 --> 00:44:39,350
You've reached the
voicemail of Carl Neeham.

437
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:40,517
Please leave a message.

438
00:44:40,558 --> 00:44:42,017
Yeah, Mr. Neeham...

439
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,059
Uh, Mr. Neeham, it's Jim Hanson here.

440
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,183
Listen, I was able to work something out.

441
00:44:49,225 --> 00:44:51,767
Uh, if you can give me
just a few more days,

442
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:55,059
I can come in and make
things current on my loan.

443
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:57,642
Uh, thanks.

444
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:05,934
Okay. Double whiskey and a Coke.

445
00:45:05,975 --> 00:45:07,934
You boys ready to order?

446
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:09,892
I'll have the steak. Rare.

447
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,100
And for the young man?

448
00:45:13,725 --> 00:45:15,642
Can I have a hamburger? Mmm-hmm.

449
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:17,892
Thank you.

450
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:19,391
Thanks.

451
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:23,266
Where'd you learn to speak English?

452
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:25,350
School.

453
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,141
Must have been a good student.

454
00:45:30,183 --> 00:45:32,975
My mom, she made me study a lot.

455
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:36,850
Those men at the border,

456
00:45:36,892 --> 00:45:38,517
you know why they were after you?

457
00:45:39,767 --> 00:45:41,308
My Uncle Carlos.

458
00:45:42,433 --> 00:45:44,725
He did something that made the cartel mad.

459
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:48,266
Called my mom and said we had to leave.

460
00:45:51,725 --> 00:45:53,100
What about your dad?

461
00:45:54,558 --> 00:45:55,725
He's dead.

462
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:56,934
Died before I was born.

463
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,600
Your name is Miguel?

464
00:46:04,058 --> 00:46:05,225
Yes.

465
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:06,767
Jim.

466
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:19,934
I need to go.

467
00:46:21,058 --> 00:46:22,058
Huh?

468
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,017
Oh, yeah. Go on.

469
00:47:08,684 --> 00:47:09,809
Jim.

470
00:47:11,725 --> 00:47:12,725
Jim.

471
00:47:21,225 --> 00:47:22,558
Jackson.

472
00:47:23,475 --> 00:47:24,767
Good boy.

473
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,308
Jackson?

474
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,392
Little shit!

475
00:48:45,308 --> 00:48:47,016
I'll do the shopping from here on.

476
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,392
Yeah, no guarantees on that, yeah?

477
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:01,433
If I were you, I'd get
the whole thing replaced

478
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:03,891
when you get back home, wherever home is.

479
00:49:03,933 --> 00:49:04,975
Yeah, will do.

480
00:49:05,016 --> 00:49:07,100
How old's your boy?

481
00:49:09,975 --> 00:49:11,475
He's not my kid.

482
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,308
You know how to read that thing?

483
00:49:47,308 --> 00:49:48,433
We're, uh...

484
00:49:49,225 --> 00:49:50,559
We're around here someplace.

485
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:19,042
Hello.

486
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:48,183
Can I help you?

487
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:54,292
Boss.

488
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:56,208
Boss.

489
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:04,417
The card was used 20 miles west of here.

490
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:21,975
If you had a phone,

491
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:23,600
we could have looked up the fastest way.

492
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,225
So I hear.

493
00:51:28,267 --> 00:51:30,725
Why do you not have one?
Is it because you're old?

494
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:32,475
What?

495
00:51:32,517 --> 00:51:34,434
Some old people don't like phones.

496
00:51:35,475 --> 00:51:37,016
No, that's not it.

497
00:51:38,475 --> 00:51:41,100
Nobody needs to call me,
and I like it that way.

498
00:51:47,725 --> 00:51:49,225
Do you think I'll like it in Chicago?

499
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,100
Don't know why not.

500
00:51:53,933 --> 00:51:56,600
I spent some time there one
summer when I was about your age.

501
00:51:58,475 --> 00:51:59,808
I remember...

502
00:52:00,434 --> 00:52:01,642
I remember how green it was.

503
00:52:02,308 --> 00:52:04,225
Oh! And the hot dogs.

504
00:52:04,267 --> 00:52:05,600
You like hot dogs?

505
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,475
You'll like these.

506
00:52:09,142 --> 00:52:11,058
Chicago's famous for them.

507
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:13,308
No ketchup, though. Uh-uh.

508
00:52:14,308 --> 00:52:16,683
Mustard, pickles, that sort of thing.

509
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,517
Never had one as good anywhere else.

510
00:52:36,308 --> 00:52:37,808
What the hell?

511
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:04,517
Stay calm and be quiet.

512
00:53:09,225 --> 00:53:10,641
Your license, please.

513
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:15,600
Looks like you had a little incident.

514
00:53:15,641 --> 00:53:16,933
Yeah.

515
00:53:20,808 --> 00:53:22,808
How are you there today, young man?

516
00:53:25,058 --> 00:53:26,100
Okay.

517
00:53:27,475 --> 00:53:29,392
Any weapons on you, sir?

518
00:53:29,434 --> 00:53:32,850
I've got a .45 under the
seat and a rifle in the back.

519
00:53:32,891 --> 00:53:33,933
Both registered.

520
00:53:35,183 --> 00:53:36,683
Step out of the vehicle, please.

521
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:39,808
I didn't think I was speeding.

522
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,142
Is there a problem?

523
00:53:41,183 --> 00:53:42,559
I just want to have a word with the boy.

524
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,100
It'll only take a minute.

525
00:53:53,808 --> 00:53:55,641
Jackson, stay.

526
00:54:03,683 --> 00:54:04,975
Walk back to my vehicle, please.

527
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,058
Go ahead and have a seat in the back.

528
00:54:39,225 --> 00:54:41,225
Conley, you out there?

529
00:54:44,267 --> 00:54:46,309
I got tired of waiting and ate without you.

530
00:55:04,892 --> 00:55:07,892
Go ahead and have a seat in your
truck while I run your information.

531
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,392
Can I have my keys so I can run the A/C?

532
00:55:14,434 --> 00:55:16,350
It'll only take a minute.

533
00:55:17,058 --> 00:55:18,516
Jackson... Come on.

534
00:55:18,558 --> 00:55:19,600
Come on.

535
00:55:19,641 --> 00:55:22,600
You, uh... You didn't talk to the boy.

536
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:25,392
What?

537
00:55:25,434 --> 00:55:28,184
You said you wanted a word with the
boy, but you didn't speak to him.

538
00:55:29,683 --> 00:55:30,766
Get in the truck.

539
00:55:41,058 --> 00:55:42,100
How much?

540
00:55:42,142 --> 00:55:43,641
Excuse me?

541
00:55:43,683 --> 00:55:46,392
How much are they paying
you to betray that badge?

542
00:55:46,434 --> 00:55:47,850
Get in the truck.

543
00:55:47,892 --> 00:55:49,516
You turn us over to them, they'll kill us.

544
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:51,641
Get in the fucking truck!

545
00:56:25,975 --> 00:56:28,267
Miguel, back in the truck! Now!

546
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:02,309
Wait here.

547
00:57:23,142 --> 00:57:24,142
What's up?

548
00:57:29,267 --> 00:57:30,309
Stay down.

549
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:33,708
Where is he?

550
00:57:34,475 --> 00:57:35,516
Hey!

551
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:36,875
Where is he?

552
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:38,641
- I don't... What? I don't understand...
- Where is he?

553
00:57:38,683 --> 00:57:40,142
- Where? Where? Where?
- I don't know!

554
00:57:49,892 --> 00:57:50,892
Don't look.

555
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:17,875
Let's go.

556
00:58:41,475 --> 00:58:42,558
Come on.

557
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,308
I'll be right back.

558
00:59:03,142 --> 00:59:04,225
That'll be fine.

559
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:09,350
If you're paying cash,
I can do 900 for both.

560
00:59:10,059 --> 00:59:11,350
Ammo is on the house.

561
00:59:11,391 --> 00:59:13,266
- Sounds fair enough.
- Need some ID.

562
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,975
Devil Dog, huh?

563
00:59:17,017 --> 00:59:18,391
'Nam?

564
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:19,600
Two tours.

565
00:59:19,642 --> 00:59:22,391
Hmm. I had a brother over there.

566
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,059
He didn't make it back.

567
00:59:25,558 --> 00:59:26,725
Sorry to hear that.

568
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,225
We lost some good men.

569
00:59:28,266 --> 00:59:29,850
We did.

570
00:59:29,892 --> 00:59:31,516
Got to run a background check.

571
00:59:31,558 --> 00:59:34,225
Normally doesn't take too
long, but the computer's down.

572
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:37,017
Might be a few hours,
tomorrow at the latest.

573
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:39,225
I... I can't wait.

574
00:59:39,266 --> 00:59:41,642
You see, I'm just passing through, and...

575
00:59:41,683 --> 00:59:45,516
I'm sorry, I can't risk losing my license.

576
00:59:47,934 --> 00:59:50,516
Look, I'm no criminal,

577
00:59:50,558 --> 00:59:53,642
but someone's after me,
and I need to watch my back.

578
00:59:53,683 --> 00:59:55,100
The police can't help me.

579
00:59:55,142 --> 00:59:57,350
I know it's asking a lot, but...

580
00:59:57,391 --> 00:59:58,892
It's life or death.

581
01:00:00,975 --> 01:00:03,350
Something bad happens,

582
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,184
these end up in the wrong hands...

583
01:00:09,225 --> 01:00:11,017
I'll report them stolen.

584
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:14,184
I understand. Thanks.

585
01:00:16,683 --> 01:00:18,642
This trouble you're in...

586
01:00:18,683 --> 01:00:20,225
That your own doing?

587
01:00:20,892 --> 01:00:21,934
Not exactly,

588
01:00:21,975 --> 01:00:26,266
but I made a choice, and
I got to live with it.

589
01:00:26,683 --> 01:00:28,642
So long as it's for the right reasons.

590
01:00:35,391 --> 01:00:37,183
Sarah, Jim's on the phone.

591
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:40,767
Listen, the DEA says

592
01:00:40,808 --> 01:00:44,100
the man you saw at the
border is Mauricio Guerrero.

593
01:00:44,142 --> 01:00:47,266
Recruited as a kid, soldiering
for the cartel ever since.

594
01:00:47,308 --> 01:00:49,767
And the man that you
shot? That was his brother.

595
01:00:50,225 --> 01:00:52,642
Jeez.

596
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:54,725
Mexican police have a source that said

597
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:58,350
that kid's uncle stole money
from the Vasquez Cartel.

598
01:00:58,391 --> 01:01:00,308
Found him hanging from an overpass.

599
01:01:01,266 --> 01:01:03,767
I don't know exactly what
you've got going on here,

600
01:01:03,808 --> 01:01:05,767
but it is not worth it.

601
01:01:06,225 --> 01:01:09,059
This Mauricio will find you,

602
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,017
and when he does,

603
01:01:11,059 --> 01:01:14,141
he will kill you and that boy.

604
01:01:16,892 --> 01:01:18,475
It's time to let this go.

605
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,183
Jim?

606
01:01:29,225 --> 01:01:31,017
Yeah, yeah, all right.

607
01:01:31,059 --> 01:01:32,475
I'll bring him in.

608
01:01:33,809 --> 01:01:35,183
Where are you?

609
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,725
Uh, in the Texas Panhandle somewhere.

610
01:01:37,767 --> 01:01:40,017
A town called Weyburn.

611
01:01:40,059 --> 01:01:43,225
Okay, find the local sheriff's
office. They'll get you back here.

612
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,892
No, I can't trust them.

613
01:01:46,183 --> 01:01:47,225
Fine.

614
01:01:47,266 --> 01:01:49,725
Then I'll come myself.

615
01:01:49,767 --> 01:01:51,308
Just...

616
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:53,350
Just stay off the streets,
and lay low till I get there.

617
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:55,266
Can you please do that for me?

618
01:01:55,308 --> 01:01:56,475
Yeah.

619
01:02:01,809 --> 01:02:03,225
What do you think?

620
01:02:04,517 --> 01:02:06,100
- Okay.
- Yeah?

621
01:02:17,975 --> 01:02:19,558
Here you go.

622
01:02:39,683 --> 01:02:40,809
Why are we parking here?

623
01:02:41,934 --> 01:02:44,141
I think it best we stay out of sight.

624
01:02:44,183 --> 01:02:45,683
Come on, take your bag.

625
01:02:51,266 --> 01:02:53,141
I'd like a room, please.

626
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,892
$39 plus tax.

627
01:02:54,934 --> 01:02:56,975
Credit card and ID, please.

628
01:03:05,392 --> 01:03:06,475
Will this do?

629
01:03:13,058 --> 01:03:15,141
Go on, get yourself cleaned up.

630
01:03:38,517 --> 01:03:39,892
You're welcome.

631
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:46,350
Um... Oh, I'll get some salt for the eggs.

632
01:03:46,392 --> 01:03:47,767
Forget the salt.

633
01:03:52,725 --> 01:03:54,266
Do you think they'll marry?

634
01:03:56,809 --> 01:03:58,350
I don't know.

635
01:03:59,809 --> 01:04:01,600
I suppose they might.

636
01:04:03,058 --> 01:04:04,850
I have a girlfriend at home.

637
01:04:04,892 --> 01:04:07,058
Someday, I'll marry her.

638
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:11,725
Do you have a wife?

639
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:13,350
Not anymore.

640
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:15,266
What happened?

641
01:04:16,058 --> 01:04:17,725
She died.

642
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:19,642
Cancer. Shitty disease.

643
01:04:23,058 --> 01:04:26,183
They say you get used to
being alone after a while.

644
01:04:28,266 --> 01:04:31,058
That's just crap.

645
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:35,767
You could get a girlfriend.

646
01:04:37,475 --> 01:04:40,016
I don't think so.

647
01:04:40,058 --> 01:04:41,850
I'm not young and handsome like you.

648
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:50,642
When we get to Chicago,

649
01:04:50,684 --> 01:04:53,892
the first thing I want
to do is eat a hot dog.

650
01:05:01,517 --> 01:05:03,308
Look, Miguel...

651
01:05:12,517 --> 01:05:15,558
It's late. Maybe you ought
to get some sleep, huh?

652
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,975
Want to go out, boy?

653
01:06:03,725 --> 01:06:06,475
Jackson. Jackson!

654
01:06:12,183 --> 01:06:14,517
Miguel, wake up. We have to go.

655
01:06:22,267 --> 01:06:24,517
911, what's your emergency?

656
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,058
There's a robbery in progress
here at the Blackwood Motel

657
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,308
on Route 12.

658
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:30,225
There's at least three men with guns.

659
01:06:30,267 --> 01:06:32,684
Three men, sir? Can you describe these men?

660
01:06:34,267 --> 01:06:35,600
Hello?

661
01:06:40,308 --> 01:06:41,725
Go.

662
01:06:48,016 --> 01:06:50,142
Hello, sir? Hello?

663
01:06:50,183 --> 01:06:52,100
Sir, are you okay?

664
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:19,559
Marine Corps!

665
01:07:21,767 --> 01:07:23,975
You killed my brother!

666
01:07:27,058 --> 01:07:30,350
You can't hide forever, Marine Corps!

667
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:40,917
We better go, boss.

668
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:50,208
I will kill you.

669
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:58,350
The truck is right through there.

670
01:07:58,392 --> 01:08:01,350
Go get in it and wait for me.

671
01:08:01,392 --> 01:08:03,392
Okay? Where are you going?

672
01:08:03,433 --> 01:08:05,183
I got to get my dog.

673
01:08:05,225 --> 01:08:06,850
Go now. I'll be there in a minute.

674
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:19,100
Jackson, no.

675
01:09:31,683 --> 01:09:33,725
He's in heaven now.

676
01:09:33,766 --> 01:09:35,350
No such thing.

677
01:09:37,392 --> 01:09:40,350
Just something people tell
you to make you feel better.

678
01:09:41,559 --> 01:09:44,808
My dog's nowhere but buried,
and that ain't where he belongs.

679
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:48,350
You might as well get that heaven
crap out of your head right now.

680
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:49,434
You are wrong.

681
01:09:49,475 --> 01:09:51,142
The only thing I was wrong about

682
01:09:51,183 --> 01:09:53,183
was driving your ass across the country.

683
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,183
I'm taking you back.

684
01:09:58,725 --> 01:10:00,517
I know about the money.

685
01:10:03,517 --> 01:10:05,517
I looked in the bag.

686
01:10:07,891 --> 01:10:08,891
Get in the truck!

687
01:10:15,683 --> 01:10:16,683
Miguel!

688
01:10:20,475 --> 01:10:21,850
Miguel!

689
01:10:43,475 --> 01:10:46,100
911 got a call on a robbery in progress.

690
01:10:46,142 --> 01:10:47,766
We showed up, the owner's neck was broken.

691
01:10:48,683 --> 01:10:50,475
Still money in the drawer, though.

692
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:54,392
A guest says he saw a man and a
boy enter this room last night.

693
01:10:54,434 --> 01:10:55,892
Seems they left here in a hurry.

694
01:10:56,641 --> 01:10:58,766
Maybe you can explain
what the hell is going on.

695
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,641
Where are you, Jim?

696
01:11:35,475 --> 01:11:38,933
Look, maybe I should have
said something about the money.

697
01:11:40,475 --> 01:11:42,850
It doesn't matter now, but...

698
01:11:42,892 --> 01:11:44,850
I made a mistake thinking I could help you.

699
01:11:48,683 --> 01:11:50,975
We're not going to Chicago?

700
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,142
I'm sorry about Jackson.

701
01:12:27,475 --> 01:12:29,225
He was a great dog.

702
01:12:29,267 --> 01:12:31,475
Yeah. Yeah, he was.

703
01:12:32,475 --> 01:12:36,392
Thanks, um, for helping
give him a proper burial.

704
01:12:38,142 --> 01:12:41,475
I hope someday there's
a funeral for my mother.

705
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:17,725
Come on.

706
01:13:22,184 --> 01:13:23,309
Excuse me, sir.

707
01:13:24,683 --> 01:13:25,683
Um...

708
01:13:26,392 --> 01:13:28,683
I was wondering if you could help...

709
01:13:28,725 --> 01:13:31,142
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord.

710
01:13:32,433 --> 01:13:35,641
May the perpetual light shine upon Rosa.

711
01:13:36,808 --> 01:13:39,350
And may her soul, through the mercy of God,

712
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:41,808
rest in peace.

713
01:13:43,975 --> 01:13:45,225
Amen.

714
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,725
Thanks.

715
01:13:59,475 --> 01:14:01,059
It's a lonely experience

716
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,017
to lose someone so close,

717
01:14:04,309 --> 01:14:05,683
especially for a child.

718
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:09,267
He's your, what? Grandson?

719
01:14:10,309 --> 01:14:12,267
No. Um, I knew his mother.

720
01:14:12,309 --> 01:14:14,558
She asked me to look after him.

721
01:14:15,309 --> 01:14:17,017
That's no small request.

722
01:14:18,225 --> 01:14:20,059
She must have had a lot of faith in you.

723
01:14:35,808 --> 01:14:36,808
Jim?

724
01:14:37,059 --> 01:14:38,350
Yeah, it's me.

725
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:39,683
Tell me you're safe.

726
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:40,725
- We're okay.
- Is that him?

727
01:14:41,267 --> 01:14:42,433
Find out where he is.

728
01:14:42,475 --> 01:14:44,516
Good. Now tell me exactly where you are.

729
01:14:44,558 --> 01:14:45,808
- I got the sheriff with me.
- Sarah...

730
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:47,933
I got plenty of firepower.
I just need to know...

731
01:14:47,975 --> 01:14:49,350
Sarah.

732
01:14:49,683 --> 01:14:53,059
Listen, the kid's not going back.

733
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,725
That's what I'm calling to tell you.

734
01:14:55,641 --> 01:14:57,142
I'm doing what his mother asked.

735
01:14:57,184 --> 01:14:58,892
I'm taking him to her family.

736
01:15:00,184 --> 01:15:01,933
That is not up to you.

737
01:15:01,975 --> 01:15:04,767
And what kind of life's he
going to have back in Mexico?

738
01:15:04,808 --> 01:15:07,642
In protection forever,
if he even lasts a week?

739
01:15:07,683 --> 01:15:09,600
He can apply for asylum here.

740
01:15:09,642 --> 01:15:10,892
With what happened to his mother,

741
01:15:10,933 --> 01:15:12,350
he'd have a strong case.

742
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:14,184
Can you guarantee he'll get it?

743
01:15:14,808 --> 01:15:16,850
Especially the way things are now?

744
01:15:19,892 --> 01:15:21,892
Tell me what's going on with you here.

745
01:15:23,642 --> 01:15:25,475
Let me help you while I still can.

746
01:15:27,892 --> 01:15:29,100
This kid, he...

747
01:15:29,683 --> 01:15:31,475
He didn't bring any of this on himself.

748
01:15:31,516 --> 01:15:33,892
He just needs someone to give him a chance.

749
01:15:35,391 --> 01:15:36,975
I can't shake the feeling

750
01:15:37,017 --> 01:15:40,975
that your mom is somehow
guiding me through this.

751
01:15:41,433 --> 01:15:43,308
She'd want me to help this kid.

752
01:15:45,475 --> 01:15:48,017
If you do this, there's nothing
more I can do to help you.

753
01:15:49,516 --> 01:15:50,725
I know.

754
01:15:52,558 --> 01:15:54,225
You do what you've got to do.

755
01:15:56,475 --> 01:15:57,725
We're heading to Chicago.

756
01:15:57,767 --> 01:15:59,850
Give me a few hours if you can.

757
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:03,558
See you around, Sarah.

758
01:16:08,059 --> 01:16:10,308
So? What'd he say?

759
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,391
Where's he headed?

760
01:16:14,558 --> 01:16:15,808
I don't know.

761
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:22,892
{\an8}The killer of a highway
patrol officer yesterday.

762
01:16:22,934 --> 01:16:26,391
{\an8}Officer Jay Conley was
found murdered along Highway 40,

763
01:16:26,433 --> 01:16:27,975
west of Amarillo.

764
01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:29,558
Police say they have little to go on,

765
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,683
and are asking for the public's help.

766
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:34,391
Anyone who may have
witnessed anything suspicious

767
01:16:34,433 --> 01:16:37,767
is asked to contact the
Texas authorities or the FBI.

768
01:16:38,142 --> 01:16:39,266
In other news,

769
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:40,975
closing arguments are expected to begin...

770
01:16:51,558 --> 01:16:53,850
I guess we'd better buy another map.

771
01:16:56,767 --> 01:16:59,059
Figure out how to get you to Chicago.

772
01:17:25,792 --> 01:17:26,583
Boss.

773
01:17:50,808 --> 01:17:51,892
Hello?

774
01:17:54,017 --> 01:17:55,183
Yeah.

775
01:17:58,266 --> 01:17:59,266
No problem.

776
01:18:11,934 --> 01:18:13,934
Miguel, come here.

777
01:18:20,892 --> 01:18:22,141
Want to try?

778
01:18:23,391 --> 01:18:24,767
Look, stand here.

779
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,600
Now, your finger here.

780
01:18:29,558 --> 01:18:30,558
There you go.

781
01:18:31,683 --> 01:18:35,017
Now, line up this with this notch

782
01:18:36,517 --> 01:18:38,141
with that can on the left.

783
01:18:38,975 --> 01:18:40,475
Spread your legs a little.

784
01:18:41,391 --> 01:18:44,183
Now, put your finger on the trigger.

785
01:18:45,308 --> 01:18:47,433
The gun's going to kick back hard,

786
01:18:47,975 --> 01:18:49,183
so brace yourself.

787
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:54,433
And when you're ready, just squeeze.

788
01:18:56,558 --> 01:18:57,600
Try it again.

789
01:18:57,642 --> 01:18:59,725
Hold it steady, relax your shoulders.

790
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:01,475
Keep them loose.

791
01:19:02,141 --> 01:19:03,850
Now, take a deep breath,

792
01:19:04,517 --> 01:19:05,975
let half of it out...

793
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:09,141
And squeeze that trigger.

794
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:16,350
You're a natural.

795
01:19:19,141 --> 01:19:21,308
Press this button here
to remove the magazine.

796
01:19:22,767 --> 01:19:24,308
Pull the slide back to clear it.

797
01:19:25,809 --> 01:19:27,600
Now the gun's empty and safe.

798
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:39,392
You were a soldier?

799
01:19:39,934 --> 01:19:41,141
Yeah. Marine.

800
01:19:42,058 --> 01:19:43,975
- You fought in a war?
- Mmm-hmm.

801
01:19:46,183 --> 01:19:47,558
You killed other soldiers?

802
01:19:52,558 --> 01:19:55,475
Someday, I will kill those men.

803
01:19:57,892 --> 01:20:01,350
There's absolutely nothing that
feels good about killing another man.

804
01:20:04,058 --> 01:20:06,600
Your mother died to give you
a chance at a better life.

805
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:09,517
Don't waste it.

806
01:20:15,475 --> 01:20:16,809
This is the spot.

807
01:20:57,850 --> 01:21:00,475
Do you still get sad when
you think about your wife?

808
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:04,600
I miss that woman every day.

809
01:21:06,934 --> 01:21:09,308
Life doesn't always play
out the way you expect.

810
01:21:12,141 --> 01:21:14,100
There are good times ahead for you, Miguel.

811
01:21:16,225 --> 01:21:17,600
Your mom's watching over.

812
01:21:18,558 --> 01:21:20,016
She'll make sure of that.

813
01:21:29,392 --> 01:21:30,725
This belongs to you.

814
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:36,850
I don't want it.

815
01:21:38,475 --> 01:21:39,725
It's cartel's money.

816
01:21:46,058 --> 01:21:50,475
Then I guess we've got no use for this.

817
01:22:40,725 --> 01:22:42,141
You know something?

818
01:22:42,725 --> 01:22:44,141
It's not bad.

819
01:22:49,475 --> 01:22:50,559
Ready?

820
01:23:52,392 --> 01:23:53,517
Where are we going?

821
01:23:54,767 --> 01:23:56,850
Let's take some side roads for a while.

822
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:04,458
Hello.

823
01:24:07,267 --> 01:24:08,642
Exit 209?

824
01:24:09,684 --> 01:24:10,725
You sure?

825
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:12,042
OK, thank you.

826
01:24:12,417 --> 01:24:13,625
Five miles back.

827
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:33,333
Look! It's him.

828
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:35,958
Go ahead! Go ahead! Go ahead!

829
01:24:47,267 --> 01:24:48,684
Is that him?

830
01:24:48,725 --> 01:24:49,850
Hold on tight.

831
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:14,058
Shit!

832
01:25:45,475 --> 01:25:46,725
Get out.

833
01:25:56,475 --> 01:25:57,975
We should run. He'll kill us.

834
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:00,559
Not if I get him first.

835
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:03,350
Miguel, let's go.

836
01:27:03,392 --> 01:27:04,559
Come on.

837
01:27:11,458 --> 01:27:12,958
Boss, boss.

838
01:27:30,333 --> 01:27:31,708
Where is that bastard?

839
01:27:45,892 --> 01:27:46,892
Come on.

840
01:28:01,267 --> 01:28:02,892
Stay down. Here.

841
01:28:06,017 --> 01:28:07,558
If anything happens to me,

842
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,766
you get out of here, and you
run as far away as you can.

843
01:28:10,808 --> 01:28:12,225
Understand?

844
01:29:01,933 --> 01:29:03,434
Miguel, come over here.

845
01:29:06,766 --> 01:29:09,516
I need you to create a distraction.

846
01:29:09,558 --> 01:29:14,058
Count to 30, then fire
two quick shots out there.

847
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,392
It's ready.

848
01:29:17,267 --> 01:29:19,017
Start counting. Now.

849
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:32,792
I'm going around.

850
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,875
10, 11...

851
01:29:51,167 --> 01:29:53,292
14, 15...

852
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:16,042
28, 29...

853
01:31:21,516 --> 01:31:22,558
Miguel?

854
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,667
Marine Corps!

855
01:31:48,933 --> 01:31:50,600
Get in here and let's finish this!

856
01:31:57,142 --> 01:31:58,808
Drop your gun!

857
01:32:05,683 --> 01:32:06,725
Drop it!

858
01:32:15,933 --> 01:32:18,391
Let him go, you bastard.

859
01:32:18,683 --> 01:32:20,892
Let him go?

860
01:32:20,933 --> 01:32:22,308
Why?

861
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:28,266
He's going to make a good soldier one day.

862
01:32:29,808 --> 01:32:31,433
He's going to be trained by the best.

863
01:32:32,892 --> 01:32:34,308
He will never kill for you.

864
01:32:35,975 --> 01:32:36,975
No?

865
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:40,516
You know, I was...

866
01:32:41,934 --> 01:32:43,516
I was just like him one day.

867
01:32:45,475 --> 01:32:48,391
We all learn to do what
we must do to survive.

868
01:32:49,225 --> 01:32:50,850
Just like you and me, soldier.

869
01:32:51,725 --> 01:32:53,100
We made our choices.

870
01:32:53,142 --> 01:32:54,683
Let him make his.

871
01:32:56,725 --> 01:32:59,225
Do you think I had a choice?

872
01:32:59,266 --> 01:33:00,266
Huh?

873
01:33:01,683 --> 01:33:03,100
I never had a choice!

874
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:05,850
Miguel.

875
01:33:09,975 --> 01:33:13,059
Now he's going to kill his first man today.

876
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,558
- Same as...
- Miguel.

877
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,808
Look at me.

878
01:33:59,808 --> 01:34:01,225
Yeah!

879
01:34:48,792 --> 01:34:49,625
Shoot!

880
01:34:50,208 --> 01:34:51,208
Shoot!

881
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,333
Avenge your mother.

882
01:34:54,475 --> 01:34:56,308
Miguel, don't listen to him.

883
01:34:56,975 --> 01:34:57,916
Don't do it.

884
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:58,792
Kill me.

885
01:34:59,208 --> 01:35:00,125
Kill me.

886
01:35:00,433 --> 01:35:02,100
Give me the gun.

887
01:35:02,141 --> 01:35:03,308
Give me the gun.

888
01:35:03,708 --> 01:35:04,542
Kill me.

889
01:35:20,683 --> 01:35:22,558
Miguel, walk away.

890
01:35:24,225 --> 01:35:25,934
Walk away. Now.

891
01:35:35,767 --> 01:35:36,975
Wait.

892
01:36:39,141 --> 01:36:41,350
Now you have a choice.

893
01:38:37,517 --> 01:38:38,892
This is for you.

894
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:23,058
Miguel!

895
01:39:25,667 --> 01:39:28,333
Thank God you're OK, son.

896
01:39:30,708 --> 01:39:31,917
Come here.

897
01:39:33,417 --> 01:39:34,542
Come here.

898
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:35,958
Everyone come here!

899
01:39:36,208 --> 01:39:37,417
It's Miguel.
