And so?

3
00:01:26,268 --> 00:01:28,566
And so,
I'm sitting there staring at him, right?

4
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:31,935
He tells me to get my crunchy
fucking fucknuts the fuck out of there.

5
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:33,540
You believe that shit?

6
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,108
- You know what I said, right?
- No, what did you say?

7
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:41,941
- Shit. "Okay."
- You fucking said, "Okay."

8
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:43,607
I'm sure you did.

<i>Control Center,
this is Stillwell 1215.</i>

10
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:13,346
Go ahead, Stillwell 1215.

11
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:15,813
I'm about four cars
out of 57th Street station...

12
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:17,747
...being delayed
by a red signal light.

13
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:21,622
Should be green, Stillwell 1215.

14
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,848
Yeah, tell me something
I don't already know.

15
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:27,856
All right, roll through it slow,
extreme caution, per the rulebook.

16
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:42,806
Yeah, cracked rail. Nine-hundred feet
from the east end of the platform.

17
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:45,467
It's the goddamn cold.
Metal contracts, you know that.

18
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:47,773
I got it, I got it.
How long it take to fix it?

19
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:50,041
Gotta put a plate on it. Two hours.

20
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:53,981
Thank you. Make it an hour and a half,
I'll buy you a beer.

21
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:27,248
Shit, G.B. I hate to see you
down here on the floor, man.

22
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,081
Temporary, baby. I'll be up there
behind the glass before you know it.

23
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:45,832
I'm gonna need the R train...

24
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:48,335
...to switch over
to the express tracks at 34th.

25
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,497
- Which express tracks?
- The one that Q uses.

26
00:03:50,674 --> 00:03:53,734
Once they exit the 57th Street,
they can switch over to the F Line.

27
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:55,003
Straight into Queens.

28
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:58,615
Once they get to Queens, they switch
back at 36th Street to the R Line.

29
00:03:58,783 --> 00:04:02,946
All you gotta do, suspend the W,
N and R will pick up the slack.

30
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:49,587
I can't see where I gotta look.

31
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:52,233
Unlock the door.
Do it now or I'll kill you. Do it.

32
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:55,293
All right, all right.

33
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,585
Shut up and walk.

34
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:20,087
First car, go.

35
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:32,596
See? I told you I could do this.

36
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,471
Big fucking deal,
you did what you said you'd do.

37
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:54,290
All right.

38
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,929
Five minutes of peace.

39
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,231
- Yeah!
- Nice!

40
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:05,268
- Nice.
- All right.

41
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:06,996
There you go.

42
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:14,141
I'm on the train and I still got you.

43
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,674
<i>- You still got me?
- I got you. What are you doing?</i>

44

45
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:23,317
Oh, my God.

46

Baby? Baby?

47
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,247
Give me the cutting key.

48
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:29,710
Cutting key.

Come in, Pelham 123.

50

Not now, okay?

58

59
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:40,050
- Brooklyn.

Yeah.

61
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:44,483
I thought so.

62

Who's driving Pelham 123?

63
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,695
Maybe something fell on the tracks.

64
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:41,771
Wait. Are we going backwards?

65

...on the southbound Lexington
Avenue Line just north of you.

67
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:07,202
Listen up,
we need to stop and stay in-station.

68

All southbound locals
just north of the 51 st Street station.

69
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:13,372
The operator on 123
is Jerry Pollard.

70
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:16,480
I know Jerry Pollard.
I went to motorman school with Jerry.

71

73

<i>This is Control Center.
What's going on, 123?</i>

74
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:32,357

them, see what we see in the cab.

75
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,966
<i>Yeah, this is South Ferry 105. I can't
get my windshield wiper to turn on.</i>

76
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:39,568
South Ferry 105, there's a circuit
breaker right behind you for that.

77

What's going on?

78

Maestro, what's going on?

79
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:01,615
- Cop.

80

- Fuck.

When I say stop, stop it hard.

82

84
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:30,443

97

Now, you understand commodities,
don't you?

157
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,738
You know, pork bellies?
Gold? Light crude?

158
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:28,372
Listen, no disrespect, but maybe I'm
not the guy you should be talking to.

159
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,745
Oh, no, you are exactly the guy
I wanna talk to.

160
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,615
Now, I want you to look at the ticker
and you tell me...

161
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:37,188
...what is the going rate
for a New York City hostage today?

162
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:42,089
<i>You think a million dollars
is too much? I do. I think it's corny.</i>

163
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:44,628
Now get your calculator out.
You got one?

164
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:50,929
<i>- Do you have a calculator?
- Yeah, we got one. I got one.</i>

165
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:56,735
Okay, good. Add this up.
You got $526,315 and 79 cents.

166
00:15:56,909 --> 00:16:00,605
<i>That's 526,315. 79.</i>

167
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,538
<i>Now, times that by 19.</i>

168
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:04,909
What do you got?

169
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,347
What is he, a goddamn accountant?

170
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,484
- That's 10 million?
- What do you got?

171
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:15,619
That comes out to 10 million
plus one cent.

172
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:16,817
That is a deal.

173
00:16:16,994 --> 00:16:19,292
You call the mayor
and you tell him the price.

174
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:23,424
<i>And then you tell him I want it in
100,000 $ 100 bills, you got that?</i>

175
00:16:23,803 --> 00:16:25,395
I got it. What about the one cent?

176
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:27,299
Keep that, that's your broker fee.

177
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:30,407
Now, I want the rest
in plain suitcases...

178
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:33,703
...the kind with the wheels
and the portable handle, okay?

179
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,973
Now, this is not a futures contract.
This is a spot trade.

180
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:40,174
<i>That means there's a time limit on it.
Okay, you got that?</i>

181
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:42,582
Now, what do you think
is a fair time limit?

182
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:47,483
You know, I don't know.
I'm really just a guy...

183
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:50,627
Come on, give me a time limit.
Give me a fair time limit.

184
00:16:53,497 --> 00:16:55,556
- Thursday.
- I was thinking more like an hour.

185
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:57,325
Now, what's your watch say?

186
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:00,594
Two-thirteen.

187
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,534
Oh,
that's exactly what my watch says.

188
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:05,869
So at 3:13, I want that money here,
motherfucker.

189
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,408
<i>And after that, there is a late fee.</i>

190
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,014
What do you think
that late fee is gonna be?

191
00:17:15,352 --> 00:17:17,148
<i>Come on, tell me what it'll be.</i>

192
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,687
You're gonna kill the passengers?

193
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:22,791
Oh, commodities
is what I start to kill.

194
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,792
One for every minute
past the deadline I am forced to wait.

195
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,691
They become more valuable
this way...

196
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:29,388
...and still at the same price.

197
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:32,300
He's underground.
He's never gonna pull this off.

198
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,095
- Don't tell me, tell him.
- Who the hell is this guy?

199
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,738
- I don't know who it is!
- Garber, just stay with it.

200
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:39,498
What's your name?

201
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,473
- What's your name, my man?
- My name?

202
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:43,706
What's your name?

203
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:46,210
Tell him?

204
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,981
- Garber.
- Garber, okay.

205
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,846
Now, seriously, man,
in 59 minutes...

206
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:52,782
...I'm gonna start killing passengers.

207
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:56,254
So my advice to you is to get on
the phone, get the mayor notified now.

208
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:58,126
Listen, I mean...

209
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,354
I'm just a civil-service employee.
I can't get ahold of the mayor.

210
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:02,930
That's your problem, not mine.

211
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:06,465
It's like, who's responsible for
who lives and who dies in New York?

212
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:08,102
<i>That's New York City's problem.</i>

213
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,263
Get the fuck off the radio
and notify the mayor, motherfucker!

214
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,005
Okay.

215
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:28,351
Nine months of this and I'm free.
Next mayor gets inaugurated...

216
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:31,582
...I'm gonna be in Saint-Tropez
on the beach with a piסa colada.

217
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,125
I will never have to ride the subway
ever again.

218
00:18:34,295 --> 00:18:37,287
- Never say never, sir.
- Never.

219
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:39,629
All right,
what's next for the afternoon?

220
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:41,366
East Harlem Elementary at 2:30.

221
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:44,059
<i>You're to read
The Cat In The Hat to the third grade.</i>

222
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:47,536
Every time I go to the schools,
I get sick. They all have runny noses.

223
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:51,404
Call Dr. Katz, tell him I want him
waiting at the school, with a flu shot.

224
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,254
Mayor's office.

225
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,065
- He's in Car 3.
- Yeah.

226
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:16,959
What happened?

227
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:19,338
Somebody just hijacked a 6 train.

228
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:21,940
It's stopped in the tunnel
between 51 st and 42nd.

229
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:24,804
Another idiot with a gun.
What do we know?

230
00:19:24,978 --> 00:19:27,606
It's unclear, but I have a car
waiting for us downstairs.

231
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:29,338
Subway will get us there faster.

232
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:31,380
All right. Let the doors close.

233
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,111
Tell them we'll meet them
at 59th Street.

234
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:41,259
Tell the conductor
this is now an express.

235
00:19:41,428 --> 00:19:43,589
- We're skipping the next five stops.
- What?

236
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:46,196
- I gotta get to work.
- Hold on, hold on.

237
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:49,425
Everybody will get where they
need to go, we'll make all the stops.

238
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:52,126
Maybe he's not such a douchebag
after all, huh?

239
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:54,597
Funny.

240
00:19:58,043 --> 00:20:00,307
Figures you'd be the one
to get a call like this.

241
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:03,970
Hostage negotiation team here in five
minutes and the mayor's been notified.

242
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:06,275
- You gonna tell him?
- Get the fuck out of here.

243
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:08,645
My shift's over in 10 minutes.

244
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:10,548
- What are you staring at?
- Your face.

245
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:12,882
I'm trying to remember
for when it's not here.

246
00:20:13,056 --> 00:20:15,957
- You gonna start in on me?
- Right, I'm gonna start in on you.

247
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:18,220
- Don't fuck this up, Garber.
- You wanna do it?

248
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:19,953
It's your station, your call.

249
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,496
- Oh, it's my call now?
- That's right. Your call.

250
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,023
Come on.

251
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:33,175
<i>Pelham 123, come in, this is
Rail Control Center. Are you there?</i>

252
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,203
Gerber Baby boy. What's up?

253
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:40,746
Garber. Just wanted to let you know
the mayor's been notified.

254
00:20:41,183 --> 00:20:42,377
Are they gonna pay?

255
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:46,347
I don't know. I'm just the,
what'd you call me? The broker.

256
00:20:46,522 --> 00:20:49,423
No, no, you represent
the city of New York right now, buddy.

257
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:53,152
I can tell you you're dealing with one
of the all-time bureaucracies, I know.

258
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:56,388
- I mean, it takes time.
- You'd better fix the bureaucracy...

259
00:20:56,564 --> 00:20:59,328
...because when the time comes,
these hostages...

260
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:01,992
...are gonna go real quick.

261
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:06,273
You got it, you got it.
Any other demands?

262
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:08,409
Yeah,
no fucking pizza for them, either.

263
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:11,410
No, I mean, are you guys, like,
you know, are you terrorists?

264
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,606
Do I sound like a terrorist?
Do I terrorize you?

265
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:18,083
Actually, you don't, but I mean,
not that I ever talked to one.

266
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:19,278
So...

267
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:22,117
So, what, this is just about money?

268
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,918
Oh, is there anything else?

269
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:25,354
There's not dying.

270
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:28,928
Yeah, well, you live, you die. You
go with the current or you fight it...

271
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:30,758
<i>... you all end up
in the same place.</i>

272
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:33,901
- Where's that, Jersey?
- Yeah, you watch it. I was born there.

273
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:36,768
I'm just saying,
you're up in the motorman's cab.

274
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:40,375
That means you're on the radio, which
means that you're an easy target.

275
00:21:40,543 --> 00:21:42,510
<i>You gotta know the drill.</i>

276
00:21:43,745 --> 00:21:45,440
I know that soon I won't be alone...

277
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:49,276
...and if I'm the first to get shot,
I'm the first of many to get shot.

278
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,543
That's correct,
but then you'd still be dead.

279
00:21:52,387 --> 00:21:55,618
Dead is an improvement on a lot
of things I can think of, buddy boy.

280
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,280
Sounds like he slept with my ex.

281
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,150
You know, we all owe God a death.

282
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:05,128
And I'm a man who pays his debts.
Are you a man who pays his debts?

283
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:08,393
Yeah, yeah, sure.
TV, cable, and my mortgage.

284
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:12,972
- That's a little like dying once a month.
- You're married, you're a married man.

285
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:14,331
Maybe.

286
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:18,841
No, no, no. You're married, man.
Married men have mortgages.

287
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,146
You got a mortgage?

288
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:24,112
I don't know. Why don't you tell me,
then we'll both know?

289
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:29,277
I don't know. I'm sure someone
out there loves you dearly and...

290
00:22:29,455 --> 00:22:31,285
<i>... you know,
would be worried about you.</i>

291
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:33,253
<i>You're in the motorman's cab...</i>

292
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:35,689
<i>... you got no cover,
sniper on the way.</i>

293
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:38,329
Well, you know,
circumstances are my protection...

294
00:22:38,496 --> 00:22:41,659
...because right now, you know,
hostages are good insurance.

295
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:44,359
By the way I see it,
I'm pretty well-protected.

296
00:22:47,073 --> 00:22:50,064
You know, this reminds me
of being in a confessional.

297
00:22:50,508 --> 00:22:52,032
Are you Catholic?

298
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:53,944
I'm married, you're Catholic.

299
00:22:54,113 --> 00:22:56,172
<i>- Maybe. I don't know.
- No, you're Catholic.</i>

300
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:57,543
And a good Catholic...

301
00:22:57,717 --> 00:23:00,208
...would know he's got
a trainload of innocent people.

302
00:23:00,386 --> 00:23:02,547
You don't wanna
kill innocent people, do you?

303
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:05,121
A good Catholic
knows that nobody is innocent.

304
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:09,090
And I'm not gonna kill all these
hostages. I'd give up my leverage.

305
00:23:12,797 --> 00:23:15,459
Well,
I hope you know what you're doing.

306
00:23:15,634 --> 00:23:19,799
It's running like a fucking Swiss watch
down here, so don't worry about it.

307
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,200
So, what do I call you anyway?

308
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:25,466
Call me Ryder.

309
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:27,575
As in "train rider"?

310
00:23:27,746 --> 00:23:29,839
Call me Ryder, with a Y.

311
00:23:30,015 --> 00:23:31,141
<i>Ryder.</i>

312
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:34,511
<i>I like you, Garber.</i>

313
00:23:35,353 --> 00:23:37,321
I do like you, man.

314
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:39,479
You may be
the last friend I ever make.

315
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:44,756
Well, I hope you're wrong, Mr. Ryder.
But, you know, I'm just a guy.

316
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:47,090
<i>I'm just a guy
on the other end of the mic.</i>

317
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:50,330
Oh, you don't think
this was meant to be?

318
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:53,732
You don't think this was fate,
you and me?

319
00:23:54,637 --> 00:23:57,197
I don't know. Things happen
that lead to other things.

320
00:23:57,373 --> 00:23:59,671
And maybe this was one of them,
but that's it.

321
00:23:59,842 --> 00:24:03,437
I never get excited
about coincidence.

322
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:06,377
Well, you got 50 fucking minutes,
so check me.

323
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,917
All right. 50 minutes, check.

324
00:24:09,352 --> 00:24:11,217
And don't call me
unless you got news.

325
00:24:11,387 --> 00:24:14,185
- You got it.
- Motherfucker.

326
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:16,023
G.B.

327
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,688
You're fucking good, man.

328
00:24:21,864 --> 00:24:23,695
Okay. Move it the other way.

329
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,971
All right, come on, move it.
The other way.

330
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:38,071
Okay, now move it back a little less.

331
00:24:41,717 --> 00:24:43,707
Bingo. Got it.

332
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,379
All right, we got it.

333
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,052
- Who's talked to these jokers?
- That would be me.

334
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:24,053
Yeah, under my supervision.
Who are you?

335
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,488
Vincent Camonetti,
NYPD Hostage Negotiation Team.

336
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,183
John Johnson,
Chief Transportation Officer.

337
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,693
Walter Garber.
I'm Console Dispatch, right now.

338
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:34,299
What can you tell me, Walter?

339
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,531
His name is Ryder, with a Y.

340
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:40,332
And he's asking
for $ 10 million by 3:13.

341
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:44,637
Looking toward the future. Say what
he'd do if he doesn't get the money?

342
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:47,371
He said he'd kill a passenger
every minute we go over.

343
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,912
- Starting at 3:13 p. m.?
- 3-1-3, yes, sir.

344
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,880
- Anything else?
- He's smart.

345
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:54,782
If he's smart, why is he doing
something so fucking stupid?

346
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:57,184
- On the train radio?
- We can get him right here.

347
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:59,518
Any chance that we can get
a signal down there?

348
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,557
We'd like to get him
on one of our cells.

349
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,662
No,
there's no chance, not where he is.

350
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:06,994
What's this?
"Leverage, spot trade"?

351
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:10,033
Yeah, it's weird. He's like
a money guy, like a Wall Street.

352
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:13,933
He talked about the passengers
like they were commodities.

353
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,199
- "Catholic"?
- Yeah, I think he's Catholic.

354
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,902
For chrissakes, Garber, you gonna tell
us what his zodiac sign is now?

355
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,979
I'm just saying I think he's Catholic.

356
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,411
Man asked me about "Catholic."
I wrote it down. I'm giving my opinion.

357
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,346
Unlike other people,
I have an opinion.

358
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:29,748
Fellas, can we settle
this dispute later?

359
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,980
- Absolutely.
- Why do you think he's Catholic?

360
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:35,614
I think he's Catholic because he talked
about original sin and confessions.

361
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:38,057
I wrote it down.
I didn't know what else to do.

362
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,889
- Did he ask for a priest?
- No.

363
00:26:40,063 --> 00:26:41,724
Good. Anything else?

364
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,597
He sounded, the way he was talking,
he sounded like he's not afraid to die.

365
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:49,901
Yeah, well, it's early yet.

366
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:53,368
- The calls are coming through...?
- Right here.

367
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:55,512
You hit the blue button,
you can reach him.

368
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,011
- He'll come back to you.
- Mind if I take your seat?

369
00:26:58,181 --> 00:27:00,581
- No, no, go right ahead.
- Thank you, Walter.

370
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,774
You're welcome.

371
00:27:01,952 --> 00:27:04,716
This is the six wire.
You don't have to touch that one.

372
00:27:04,888 --> 00:27:06,412
- Okay.
- That goes around the room.

373
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,818
- Six wire.
- Why don't you...

374
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:10,084
Just hit the talk here
and then that mutes it.

375
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,353
Take the rest of the day off.
Get out of here.

376
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:15,053
I thought I'd stick around,
just make sure that...

377
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:19,691
Well, that wasn't a suggestion.
So why don't you go home?

378
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,136
All right.

379
00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:28,411
This is it. You got all the information
over here about the 313.

380
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:31,445
- Wait for his call.
- You want me to work it up right now?

381
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:35,107
You call headquarters, let them know
that I'm here and I'm on the job. Okay.

382
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:50,426
I gotta take a piss.

383
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:51,827
So who's stopping you?

384
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:56,802
All right. We wouldn't wanna end up
on any Amnesty International lists...

385
00:27:56,972 --> 00:27:59,532
...so step up to the door, face out.

386
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,608
Open the middle door.

387
00:28:02,377 --> 00:28:04,174
Do what you gotta do.

388
00:28:06,582 --> 00:28:08,277
Can I jump down there?

389
00:28:20,728 --> 00:28:23,094
- You gotta go or don't you?
- I do, I gotta go.

390
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:27,462
Step up, my man. Let's go, let's go.

391
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:40,074
That kid's going places.
All right, close the doors.

392
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:41,611
<i>Pelham 123, come in.</i>

393
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:45,478
<i>- Pelham 123, please come in.
- All right, everybody, sit down!</i>

394
00:28:56,761 --> 00:28:57,785
Who is this?

395
00:28:57,963 --> 00:29:01,900
This is Lieutenant Camonetti. I'm with
the NYPD Hostage Negotiation Team.

396
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:04,730
I'd like to talk to you
about the situation that we're in.

397
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:06,394
Where the fuck is Garber?

398
00:29:06,572 --> 00:29:08,130
Mr. Garber is a train dispatcher.

399
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:11,366
- This is now a police matter.
- Yeah, well, I wanna talk to Garber.

400
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:15,570
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryder,
but Mr. Garber is no longer involved.

401
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:18,305
Motorman, up!

402
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,579
- Put Garber on.
- To be honest...

403
00:29:21,753 --> 00:29:23,312
...Mr. Garber has gone home.

404
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:25,979
Put Garber on the fucking line
or I kill the motorman.

405
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:31,954
I guarantee you I am the best person
for you to be talking to right now.

406
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:33,860
Give me a moment
and I'll explain why.

407
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,028
You were always
gonna be the first one to go.

408
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,562
Oh, Jesus!

409
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:41,099
Jesus.

410
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:45,767
Mr. Camonetti...

411
00:29:45,944 --> 00:29:48,777
...you got 60 fucking seconds
before I kill another.

412
00:29:48,947 --> 00:29:52,576
- Okay? Fifty-nine, 58, 57...
- Get him. Just get Garber.

413
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:55,379
- Fifty-six, 55, 54...
- We're trying to locate Garber...

414
00:29:55,553 --> 00:29:57,544
...ASAP, Mr. Ryder.
Why did you do that?

415
00:29:57,722 --> 00:30:01,282
Mr. Camonetti or whatever
fucking greaseball name you got...

416
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,858
...the city of fucking New York
killed Jerry, okay?

417
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:07,225
<i>Fifty-three, 52, 51...</i>

418
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:12,196
Garber. Garber!

419
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:15,826
Garber, he killed Jerry Pollard, man.

420
00:30:16,005 --> 00:30:18,599
Come on,
he wants to talk to you right now.

421
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:21,442
He's here. He's on the way.

422
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:27,081
Eleven, 10, nine, eight, seven...

423
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:32,983
- He's approaching the desk.
- Six, five, four, three, two, one...

424
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:34,622
Hey, it's me, it's Garber.

425
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:37,323
Garber! You didn't say goodbye.

426
00:30:39,262 --> 00:30:40,286
You killed Jerry?

427
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,558
No, the city of fucking New York
killed Jerry, okay?

428
00:30:43,734 --> 00:30:47,727
<i>The biggest rathole
in the world fucking killed Jerry.</i>

429
00:30:47,904 --> 00:30:50,805
Okay? Now you can
chalk another victim up to NYC.

430
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:54,101
- Now, can everybody hear me?
- Yeah, we hear you, loud and clear.

431
00:30:54,277 --> 00:30:56,074
Now you don't have to tell
the cops...

432
00:30:56,245 --> 00:31:00,238
...they don't tell me how to do it or how
it's gonna be. I fucking tell them.

433
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:02,213
Don't you ever, ever
leave me again.

434
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:05,046
Or I'll just have to hunt you down
and I'll kill you.

435
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,848
Now, you got 39...

436
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:10,948
Thirty-nine minutes. Check me.

437
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:12,919
Thirty-nine, check.

438
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,295
This is Staley to ESU 2.
What's your position?

439
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:27,964
ESU 2 approaching hostage car
from south tunnel.

440
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:29,671
Go, go, go.

441
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:34,805
Ten-million dollars. I'll write him
a check and get it over with.

442
00:31:34,982 --> 00:31:38,383
- He wants it in cash.
- I was joking, LaSalle.

443
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:41,613
But we've been given one hour
to get the money together.

444
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:44,223
Ten-million dollars.
Where do they get these numbers?

445
00:31:44,392 --> 00:31:46,553
Actually, 10 is the limit, sir.

446
00:31:46,727 --> 00:31:47,751
Why is that?

447
00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:51,193
Request to the City Controller,
he forwards it to one of our lenders...

448
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:55,391
...cash gets released to the Federal
Reserve. Limit at any time is 10 million.

449
00:31:55,568 --> 00:31:58,230
Some idiot with a gun
wouldn't know that. I didn't know.

450
00:31:58,405 --> 00:32:01,239
- Well, you're very busy, sir.
- How do you know that?

451
00:32:02,743 --> 00:32:04,335
Here he is.

452
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:07,480
- Henry, what's the situation?
- They killed a hostage.

453
00:32:07,648 --> 00:32:09,674
These guys may be the real deal.

454
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:11,841
I thought there was one idiot
with a gun.

455
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:14,715
Multiple gunmen. They're not sure.
They've got 18 hostages.

456
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:18,120
They'll kill more in an hour. That's
the limit. They want you to know.

457
00:32:18,292 --> 00:32:19,816
- What do we know?
- Not amateurs.

458
00:32:19,994 --> 00:32:21,723
They cut out a car,
stopped on a rise.

459
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:23,921
They can see us coming
100 yards either way.

460
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:25,565
How long to get the money?

461
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:26,893
- I don't know.
- Find out.

462
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:30,661
- You're not thinking of paying, are you?
- I'm thinking of time and being ready.

463
00:32:30,837 --> 00:32:32,828
Call the Controller.
Tell them we'll pay.

464
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:37,607
What's with you and Garber, huh?
Tell me about him.

465
00:32:37,776 --> 00:32:38,902
Scheduled to work today?

466
00:32:39,077 --> 00:32:41,272
- Yeah, absolutely. But...
- But what?

467
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:44,279
He's only had this particular job
for a couple weeks now.

468
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:47,077
- Well, why is that?
- Well, he's under investigation.

469
00:32:47,251 --> 00:32:48,513
What?

470
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:51,678
- We were gonna suspend him...
- What's he being investigated for?

471
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:57,690
He went to Japan. He had to take
a look at some new trains...

472
00:32:57,862 --> 00:32:59,955
...and the allegation
is that he took a bribe.

473
00:33:00,131 --> 00:33:01,791
Took a bribe?
Does he have a record?

474
00:33:01,965 --> 00:33:03,364
- Not that I know.
- You sure?

475
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:05,967
Yeah, yeah. I don't think so.
I gotta take this.

476
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:09,366
<i>The identity of the hijackers
is still unclear.</i>

477
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:13,635
<i>The Hostage Negotiation Team has
just arrived at MTA headquarters...</i>

478
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,745
<i>... to determine
if this is a terrorist enterprise.</i>

479
00:33:17,447 --> 00:33:20,280
Is that what we are? An enterprise?

480
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:23,280
We're an enterprise.

481
00:33:27,324 --> 00:33:31,693
Well, pilot reports
that the aircraft has begun its descent.

482
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:40,801
This is Staley to ESU 4.
What's your ETA?

483
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:43,735
Approximately two minutes
south of target.

484
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:46,503
Why is the train called
Pelham 123?

485
00:33:47,111 --> 00:33:49,636
Comes out of Pelham Bay
at 1:23 in the afternoon.

486
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:52,643
How did you end up with this call?

487
00:33:52,816 --> 00:33:54,750
It's a Lexington Avenue train.

488
00:33:54,918 --> 00:33:57,409
I got the Lexington Avenue desk.
Came through my desk.

489
00:33:57,587 --> 00:33:59,782
Can you think of a reason
why you'd be targeted?

490
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:02,982
Someone wanna hurt you?
Something against you or something?

491
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:04,387
No.

492
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:12,525
You recognize his voice?

493
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:18,096
No. No, as I said, it was a coincidence
it came through my desk.

494
00:34:19,508 --> 00:34:22,841
Did you pick this desk?
Or was it assigned to you?

495
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,844
Did I...?

496
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:28,983
I said, did you pick this desk
or was it assigned to you?

497
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,723
Can I take my coat off?

498
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:41,489
Doesn't make any sense.

499
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,392
- What doesn't?
- Guy you're talking to.

500
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:46,898
He ain't a train dispatcher.
Walter Garber.

501
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:49,059
- He's a big shot.
- Big shot at what?

502
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:51,398
Rail Control.
I mean, he runs things up there.

503
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:54,235
- At least he did before I went up.
- His name is Walter?

504
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:55,740
Yeah.

505
00:34:57,077 --> 00:35:00,046
Dude like that
shouldn't be answering the phone.

506
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:08,350
- Mr. Ryder wants to talk to you.
- Right.

507
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:11,423
Are you sure you don't have
some sort of relationship with him?

508
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:16,028
I assure you, whatever relationship
I have with him is better than yours.

509
00:35:16,195 --> 00:35:19,097
Jerry, my friend, was killed
while you were talking to Ryder.

510
00:35:19,266 --> 00:35:21,791
Maybe that's a question
you ask yourself instead of me.

511
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:23,903
I didn't have anything to do
with this.

512
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:26,767
But what I have in you,
Mr. Garber, is an unknown variable.

513
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,464
- Unknown variable?
- Right. People's lives are at stake.

514
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:31,109
- I understand that.
- Excuse me...

515
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:33,609
...if I try to get more comfortable
with you, okay?

516
00:35:34,413 --> 00:35:36,506
It ain't working, but okay.

517
00:35:37,316 --> 00:35:38,647
Now, with that in mind...

518
00:35:38,818 --> 00:35:42,379
...would you agree
to a consensual search of your house?

519
00:35:42,555 --> 00:35:44,546
Take me 40, 45 minutes
to get a warrant.

520
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,050
What...

521
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:51,458
Yes, okay.

522
00:35:55,202 --> 00:35:56,533
Got him.

523
00:35:57,337 --> 00:35:59,737
Walter Garber, right there.

524
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,367
No shit, look at this.

525
00:36:06,078 --> 00:36:09,047
- Guy took a bribe, man.
- Yeah.

526
00:36:10,216 --> 00:36:11,240
Baby!

527
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:24,455
ESU 2, this is Staley.
What's your overall status?

528
00:36:24,629 --> 00:36:26,096
All positions secured.

529
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:28,789
<i>All right,
hold your fire until instructed.</i>

530
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:37,567
Pelham 123, can you hear me?

531
00:36:38,008 --> 00:36:39,839
Yeah, loud and clear, back at you.

532
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,478
All right,
the mayor has agreed to pay...

533
00:36:42,646 --> 00:36:45,080
...and they're getting the money
together right now.

534
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:46,273
<i>Good.</i>

535
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,112
Well, you know, you got 28 minutes,
so I advise him to make haste.

536
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:53,283
- I'm sure he will.
- So is your first name Walter?

537
00:36:54,524 --> 00:36:56,515
- Excuse me?
- Your name, is it Walter?

538
00:36:59,062 --> 00:37:00,324
<i>- Yes, it is.
- Good.</i>

539
00:37:00,496 --> 00:37:02,293
What are you doing
dispatching trains?

540
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:05,263
I thought you were some sort of
MTA big shot.

541
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:09,367
I work for the MTA.
Today they put me at dispatch...

542
00:37:10,672 --> 00:37:11,697
...and my bad luck.

543
00:37:11,874 --> 00:37:13,865
I thought you didn't
believe in bad luck.

544
00:37:14,043 --> 00:37:16,409
I said I didn't believe in fate.

545
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:19,309
Do you believe in
rigged contracts for new trains?

546
00:37:20,783 --> 00:37:23,775
Look, what are
we talking about this for?

547
00:37:23,953 --> 00:37:26,853
- I need to know who I'm dealing with.
- You need to know who...?

548
00:37:27,022 --> 00:37:31,118
Yeah, I want to know who I'm dealing
with. I mean, are you a bad penny?

549
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:32,793
Let me explain something to you.

550
00:37:33,762 --> 00:37:35,730
Being accused of something
is one thing.

551
00:37:35,897 --> 00:37:38,525
Being guilty of it
is something entirely different.

552
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,100
Well, agreed. But you gotta
take me through this, my man.

553
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:46,035
You got to tell me from the top.
This whole train thing. Come on.

554
00:37:50,278 --> 00:37:52,371
All right,
I started out in maintenance.

555
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:55,744
Platform maintenance,
track maintenance, flagman...

556
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:58,214
<i>...conductor.
- Conductor, really?</i>

557
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,020
Yeah. And then motorman.

558
00:38:01,188 --> 00:38:03,179
A motorman.
How long did you do that for?

559
00:38:03,858 --> 00:38:05,257
I drove them over six years.

560
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:08,418
I went to tower operations,
assistant dispatcher, dispatcher.

561
00:38:08,596 --> 00:38:09,620
<i>I finally ended up...</i>

562
00:38:09,797 --> 00:38:13,460
Yeah, you're assistant chief
transportation officer or something.

563
00:38:13,634 --> 00:38:17,034
- Right?
- That's right.

564
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,606
And part of my job is to go out
to the manufacturers, you know...

565
00:38:21,775 --> 00:38:26,337
<i>... the people who build the trains
and bid on contracts for the trains.</i>

566
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,038
Is that where you took the bribe?

567
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:30,980
The Japanese train
over the Canadian train?

568
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:35,350
I did not take a bribe, all right?
I was accused of taking a bribe.

569
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,991
I have not been proven guilty yet.

570
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,559
They haven't said yet.
I mean, they haven't decided.

571
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:45,131
Well, they got no proof. I don't care
what they decide. It doesn't matter...

572
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:46,960
Then is this
when they demoted you?

573
00:38:47,134 --> 00:38:50,125
That's correct. They demoted me,
pending the outcome.

574
00:38:50,303 --> 00:38:53,067
And now they're trying
to humiliate you, is that right?

575
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,900
Motherfuckers.

576
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:57,167
<i>Look, I know
how these things work, man, okay?</i>

577
00:38:57,343 --> 00:38:59,607
<i>Everything doesn't seem
to appear like what it is.</i>

578
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:02,111
But you've gotta be
completely honest with me, man.

579
00:39:02,282 --> 00:39:04,977
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- How did you do it?

580
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,311
I didn't. I'm innocent.

581
00:39:07,486 --> 00:39:08,510
Oh, you're innocent.

582
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:10,552
No, you're talking to a Catholic,
man.

583
00:39:10,722 --> 00:39:13,418
We've been over innocent before.
Okay?

584
00:39:13,592 --> 00:39:17,790
Look, I've been through all this, man.
So just tell me, how did you do it?

585
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,598
I didn't do it.

586
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,826
Okay, that's it! That's fucking it!

587
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:25,670
Damn it.

588
00:39:27,405 --> 00:39:29,669
- Kid. You.
- Me?

589
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:32,605
No, no, you. Up.
Get the fuck over there.

590
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,169
I don't know what you did
to piss him off.

591
00:39:35,346 --> 00:39:37,905
Garber.
You know what I'm looking at?

592
00:39:38,348 --> 00:39:40,839
<i>- Do you know what I'm looking at?
- No, I do not.</i>

593
00:39:41,017 --> 00:39:44,282
First there's my gun, and at the end
of my gun... What's your name?

594
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:47,515
- George. Everyone calls me Geo.
- George. His friends call him Geo.

595
00:39:47,692 --> 00:39:49,455
<i>Got this '80s skateboard thing
going.</i>

596
00:39:49,627 --> 00:39:53,063
He makes it work, but it's not gonna
look too good in his casket.

597
00:39:53,497 --> 00:39:56,432
Listen, Ryder, just slow down.
We haven't reached the deadline.

598
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:58,626
No, there's no fucking deadline,
man.

599
00:39:58,803 --> 00:40:00,361
You just gotta tell me the truth.

600
00:40:00,538 --> 00:40:02,335
<i>- About what?
- The bribe!</i>

601
00:40:02,507 --> 00:40:04,771
- Did you take it?
- I didn't take a bribe.

602
00:40:04,943 --> 00:40:07,468
Okay, you got five seconds
to save this kid's life.

603
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:09,443
I didn't do anything.

604
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,343
- Five...
- Just wait a second.

605
00:40:11,515 --> 00:40:13,779
- Four, three...
- Wait a second!

606
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:15,509
Two...

607
00:40:15,686 --> 00:40:18,450
- Fucking tell him how you did it.
- All right, okay.

608
00:40:23,327 --> 00:40:25,625
<i>- Say it.
- I took the bribe.</i>

609
00:40:27,497 --> 00:40:29,055
How much?

610
00:40:29,733 --> 00:40:31,064
Thirty...

611
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:32,724
How fucking much?

612
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,895
Thirty-five thousand dollars.

613
00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:37,471
How did you do it?

614
00:40:38,074 --> 00:40:41,009
I went to Japan
to look at these trains.

615
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:42,906
It's part of my job.

616
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,511
I...

617
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,616
I don't get to vote, okay?
I just recommend.

618
00:40:48,784 --> 00:40:52,982
I chose what I thought
was the best train...

619
00:40:53,155 --> 00:40:56,147
...the Japanese had the best train,
and I made my recommendation.

620
00:40:56,325 --> 00:40:57,985
That's before you took the bribe.

621
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:00,218
Yes.

622
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:02,726
That was the train
you were gonna pick anyway, huh?

623
00:41:02,896 --> 00:41:05,832
- Yes.
- And now you're fighting for your job...

624
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,900
...and they're trying
to humiliate you?

625
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:12,335
No, no, no. I did what I did.

626
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:14,338
And...

627
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:17,336
And it's not, you know,
it's not the MTA's fault.

628
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:19,035
What did you spend it on?

629
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,344
Look, what does this
got to do with anything, huh?

630
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:24,074
What did you fucking spend it on?

631
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:27,379
I used the money for my kids,
all right?

632
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,215
To pay my children's tuition.

633
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:33,552
I have a 17-year-old.
I have a 19-year-old daughter.

634
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:38,359
And I used the money to pay
for their college tuition, all right?

635
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:46,402
You know what, Garber?

636
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:48,737
You're my goddamn hero,
you know that?

637
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:52,435
<i>You got a kid here, you don't even
know him, you saved his life.</i>

638
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:56,441
That's brave, man.
That's fucking heroic.

639
00:41:57,516 --> 00:42:00,281
- Tell Garber thank you.
- Thank you, Garber.

640
00:42:00,454 --> 00:42:02,422
"Thank you, Garber,
for saving my life."

641
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:04,585
Thank you, Garber,
for saving my life.

642
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,221
You're welcome.

643
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:14,055
Sit down.

644
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:17,563
You're just like me, Garber.
I fueled this city.

645
00:42:17,737 --> 00:42:21,229
I fed it breakfast every morning,
and now we're the bad guys.

646
00:42:21,407 --> 00:42:24,342
I don't think so.
I don't fucking think so!

647
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:42,926
<i>- Hello, Therese.
- Honey, look.</i>

648
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:45,961
There are police here, Walt.
They wanna search the house.

649
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:47,860
They said you said it was okay.

650
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:54,036
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay.
It's... Just let them in.

651
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:56,164
We got nothing to hide.

652
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,131
Is this about the investigation?

653
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,970
No, no. You watching TV?

654
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,540
This hostage thing.
Yeah, yeah, I'm watching it.

655
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,106
Well, it's just that...

656
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:08,181
I'll tell you about it
when I get home...

657
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,845
...but I'm in the middle of it now and
they wanna do background checks...

658
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:14,013
...on everybody involved here
from the MTA.

659
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:17,752
- That's why they're at the house.
- All right, okay. But you're okay?

660
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,056
I'm fine, I'm fine. Just let them in.
I'll see you when I get home.

661
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,722
All right. Okay, bye.

662
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,027
I'm sorry, Walter.

663
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,436
I am.

664
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:30,800
Listen, don't let this guy
bring you into his reality, all right?

665
00:43:30,973 --> 00:43:33,737
That's what he wants to do.
He hurts you, you get angry.

666
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,105
- He's got the advantage. Understand?
- Yeah.

667
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:38,304
Just deflect, if you can.

668
00:43:39,148 --> 00:43:41,344
- Okay? All right.
- All right.

669
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:09,738
I hope they don't get fucking lost.

670
00:44:16,018 --> 00:44:17,849
Fuck me! Ten-million bucks.

671
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:22,685
The joke is,
say we dipped in, took some?

672
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:25,793
Bad guys would count it,
come up short, probably kill us.

673
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:27,525
No shit.

674
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,767
Geo, what the fuck's happening?

675
00:44:43,544 --> 00:44:46,673
<i>Geo. Geo, what's going on?</i>

676
00:44:49,017 --> 00:44:50,644
Geo.

677
00:44:52,253 --> 00:44:54,380
I'm a fucking hostage.

678
00:44:56,624 --> 00:45:00,857
Listen to me.
Stream it on our site. Call the news.

679
00:45:01,296 --> 00:45:02,923
<i>Shit.</i>

680
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:10,335
Hey.

681
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,773
We've gotta do something.
They're gonna kill us.

682
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:22,573
You got a plan?

683
00:45:23,283 --> 00:45:24,648
I thought you'd have one.

684
00:45:31,924 --> 00:45:33,824
Because I'm some
tough-looking black guy?

685
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:37,487
I saw that ring on your finger.

686
00:45:43,301 --> 00:45:44,791
That was a long time ago.

687
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:47,597
- Okay?
- My husband had one just like it.

688
00:45:54,512 --> 00:45:55,843
<i>A severe sell-off underway...</i>

689
00:45:56,013 --> 00:45:59,277
<i>... the Dow is down 450 points
in very heavy trading...</i>

690
00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:01,781
<i>... as Wall Street reacts
to the terrorist attack...</i>

691
00:46:01,952 --> 00:46:04,887
<i>... of the New York City
subway system.</i>

692
00:46:11,762 --> 00:46:15,128
- How's my hair look?
- Fine. You ready to make a statement?

693
00:46:15,298 --> 00:46:17,324
When I have something to tell them.

694
00:46:17,501 --> 00:46:19,128
It's a leadership moment, sir.

695
00:46:19,303 --> 00:46:22,137
I'm not running for re-election,
for fucking president.

696
00:46:22,307 --> 00:46:24,537
I left my Rudy Giuliani suit at home.

697
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:28,043
You're being selfish.
It'll take 30 seconds to reassure them.

698
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,577
- Over there!
- Mr. Mayor!

699
00:46:36,754 --> 00:46:40,019
- Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!
- Will you be making a statement?

700
00:46:40,191 --> 00:46:43,217
We're doing everything
the situation demands.

701
00:46:43,394 --> 00:46:46,261
I'm not gonna speculate right now.
All right?

702
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,590
- Mayor, is it terrorism?
- No.

703
00:46:49,032 --> 00:46:50,624
Hey.

704
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,700
Mayor! Are they terrorists?

705
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:55,167
All right, all right, all right!

706
00:46:55,338 --> 00:46:57,465
Listen, nobody said anything
about terrorism...

707
00:46:57,641 --> 00:47:00,940
...or a bomb, anything like that.
Let's stop that right now, all right?

708
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:03,875
How about your divorce? Care
to speculate how that's going?

709
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:05,172
Your divorce, sir.

710
00:47:05,347 --> 00:47:07,247
Been a lot of talk in the news
lately...

711
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:11,284
...that you have extramarital problems.
Your divorce, sir!

712
00:47:13,022 --> 00:47:14,717
Put it on channel 15.

713
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:18,155
We got a girl in Brooklyn watching it
on her boyfriend's computer.

714
00:47:18,327 --> 00:47:20,386
- It's on the damn Internet.
- What?

715
00:47:22,797 --> 00:47:24,458
Hold on.

716
00:47:25,466 --> 00:47:27,331
- Son of a bitch.
- That's Ramos, isn't it?

717
00:47:27,502 --> 00:47:28,594
That's Phil Ramos.

718
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:30,203
- Yes, it is.
- Who's Phil Ramos?

719
00:47:30,371 --> 00:47:34,102
He was a motorman. He killed a
couple of passengers 10 years ago?

720
00:47:34,275 --> 00:47:38,075
High on cough syrup, ran into the
platform, went to jail for manslaughter.

721
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:39,907
Phil Ramos, I want everything.

722
00:47:40,081 --> 00:47:43,448
Prison time, known associates, the
works. Looks like it's from the floor.

723
00:47:43,618 --> 00:47:46,280
- Should the Internet be working there?
- No. No way.

724
00:47:46,454 --> 00:47:48,922
Maybe that's how he knows about you.
He Googled you.

725
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:50,751
Or maybe Ramos told him,
who knows?

726
00:47:54,128 --> 00:47:56,995
Goddamn, it's the mayor.
Hello, Your Honor.

727
00:48:00,268 --> 00:48:02,463
Do me a favor,
forget about those guys.

728
00:48:02,637 --> 00:48:03,729
Easy for you to say.

729
00:48:03,905 --> 00:48:05,600
You rather be
one of those hostages?

730
00:48:05,773 --> 00:48:06,865
No.

731
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:10,135
Listen up, I'll give you a crash course
on hostage negotiating.

732
00:48:10,311 --> 00:48:11,971
We're like rodeo clowns.

733
00:48:12,145 --> 00:48:15,673
We keep the bull from focusing on
what he'd like to do. Which is what?

734
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,181
- Kill a cowboy.
- Exactly.

735
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,820
Now, he's got his deadline.
You slow things down.

736
00:48:19,987 --> 00:48:23,855
Preservation of life. That's our mission.
Guy's already proven he's serious.

737
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:26,084
Next deadline's gonna give
a chance again.

738
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,023
- How do we deal with that?
- Get the money there on time.

739
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:31,630
If we don't, we pretend
the deadline doesn't exist...

740
00:48:31,798 --> 00:48:33,925
...talk through it, we buy time,
get movement.

741
00:48:34,101 --> 00:48:35,466
- Movement?
- That's right.

742
00:48:35,635 --> 00:48:39,469
Contradicts himself, inconsistency in
his demand, you got some movement.

743
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:43,200
- Right.
- All right, let's go out there.

744
00:48:45,845 --> 00:48:47,312
<i>This was the scene
moments ago...</i>

745
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,812
<i>... outside the Rail Control Center
in Midtown.</i>

746
00:48:49,982 --> 00:48:52,212
<i>I'm not gonna speculate right now.</i>

747
00:48:52,385 --> 00:48:54,650
That is a beautiful suit
he's got there.

748
00:48:57,691 --> 00:49:00,659
Can't get it out of my head.
I'm gonna die today.

749
00:49:01,827 --> 00:49:06,662
Visualization's a very powerful thing.
You keep thinking it, you never know.

750
00:49:19,643 --> 00:49:22,407
Please let it be me
who drops this motherfucker.

751
00:49:29,086 --> 00:49:31,146
Hey, Garber. You there, buddy?

752
00:49:33,324 --> 00:49:34,722
Yeah, I'm here.

753
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:37,087
<i>A little birdie told me
the mayor walked in.</i>

754
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:38,558
Can I talk to him?

755
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:43,764
<i>- Can he hear me?
- How does he know I'm here?</i>

756
00:49:45,335 --> 00:49:47,599
- Does he have a camera in here?
- Can he hear me?

757
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:51,831
We can, we can, we can...
We can all hear you here. Yes.

758
00:49:52,008 --> 00:49:56,707
Okay, good. So tell him...
Tell him I wanna make him a deal.

759
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,744
<i>Tell him I'll make him a deal
right now.</i>

760
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:01,508
Okay, all right.

761
00:50:01,684 --> 00:50:03,276
Well, come on, speak up,
Mr. Mayor.

762
00:50:03,453 --> 00:50:05,250
You're talking to your constituents.

763
00:50:05,421 --> 00:50:08,912
We got a train full
of registered voters. Don't you care?

764
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,685
Don't you care about your voters?

765
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:16,389
This is not a good idea.
Don't talk. Don't engage with him.

766
00:50:16,566 --> 00:50:19,228
I know what I'm doing,
I've been doing this a long time.

767
00:50:19,403 --> 00:50:20,597
<i>Come on, buddy, speak up.</i>

768
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:23,466
You gotta hit the blue button there,
Your Honor.

769
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:26,472
Yes, this is the mayor.

770
00:50:26,909 --> 00:50:29,139
Hey. Good to meet you, man.

771
00:50:29,312 --> 00:50:31,712
And listen, tell me this, is this true?

772
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:33,212
I read that you make, like...

773
00:50:33,382 --> 00:50:37,011
<i>... one dollar a year to be a mayor
of New York, is that true?</i>

774
00:50:37,186 --> 00:50:39,484
Yes, but at least it's honest work.

775
00:50:39,655 --> 00:50:43,249
After taxes that's, like,
87 cents, isn't it?

776
00:50:43,425 --> 00:50:44,449
Yes.

777
00:50:44,626 --> 00:50:45,991
Don't bullshit me, man.

778
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:50,291
It would take, like, 3000 years
to pay off that suit that you're wearing.

779
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:53,366
What do you got, 20, 30 million
dollars or something like that?

780
00:50:53,535 --> 00:50:56,436
You don't get that without screwing
someone, screwing everyone.

781
00:50:56,604 --> 00:50:58,731
I'm sure your wife knows
something about that.

782
00:51:03,577 --> 00:51:05,102
You said you had a deal for me.

783
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,111
Yeah, I do.
I wanna make you a deal.

784
00:51:07,282 --> 00:51:09,409
I wanna tell you
you could come down here...

785
00:51:09,584 --> 00:51:13,610
...and I will trade you for all these
passengers in the train, how's that?

786
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:21,519
Okay, you could save the lives
of 17 New Yorkers.

787
00:51:21,695 --> 00:51:23,595
Now, that's a good deal.

788
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:27,461
<i>What do you think?</i>

789
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:33,462
Give us a moment.

790
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:35,370
Okay.

791
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:37,777
I'll give you a moment.

792
00:51:40,114 --> 00:51:42,742
You turn this into a circus,
gonna get someone killed.

793
00:51:42,917 --> 00:51:45,477
Now, you entered his world, exit it.

794
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:54,418
Okay, time's up. What's the deal?

795
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,458
It's a nice offer, but I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to decline.

796
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:00,690
Good. Because if you begged me,
I wouldn't give you that deal, man.

797
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:03,664
You think anyone cares about
a philandering asshole like you?

798
00:52:03,835 --> 00:52:06,827
New York would love me to
pull the fucking trigger on you.

799
00:52:07,005 --> 00:52:10,566
Hey, Garber. This is the... This is
the guy that's trying to get rid of you.

800
00:52:10,742 --> 00:52:12,676
- Keep talking.
- Do you believe this shit?

801
00:52:12,844 --> 00:52:14,539
<i>- Calm...
- You don't think he...</i>

802
00:52:14,713 --> 00:52:16,180
...broke the same rules
we broke?

803
00:52:16,348 --> 00:52:18,179
- He knows it, I know it.
- Calm him down.

804
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,873
<i>- All right...
- He can eat shit.</i>

805
00:52:20,051 --> 00:52:21,484
- Calm him down.
- You're...

806
00:52:21,652 --> 00:52:23,517
<i>- You're breaking up.
- He can kiss my ass!</i>

807
00:52:23,688 --> 00:52:25,714
I like the deal.
It's a good deal, but...

808
00:52:25,891 --> 00:52:27,222
<i>Fuck you, Mr. Mayor!</i>

809
00:52:27,392 --> 00:52:31,021
Now, I want my fucking money now!
You understand me? Now!

810
00:52:31,196 --> 00:52:34,131
- Just tell him the money's on the way.
- The money's on the way.

811
00:52:34,299 --> 00:52:36,823
Because he's, like,
a used-car salesman, this asshole.

812
00:52:37,001 --> 00:52:39,368
He can lick my bunghole,
motherfucker!

813
00:52:40,205 --> 00:52:42,730
One mistake
and everyone has something to say.

814
00:52:43,442 --> 00:52:44,704
Was she worth it?

815
00:52:44,876 --> 00:52:48,608
Yes. You have nine minutes.
How are you gonna get the money?

816
00:52:48,781 --> 00:52:52,046
They're shutting down every
intersection here to Brooklyn.

817
00:53:00,225 --> 00:53:02,090
Phil Ramos, male, Hispanic, 39.

818
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,421
Sentenced two to four years
for manslaughter...

819
00:53:04,596 --> 00:53:06,564
...paroled last month from Clinton.

820
00:53:06,732 --> 00:53:09,928
His PO, Justafarro, says he's
living in a halfway house in Queens.

821
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:13,468
He's not an absconder, he made his
appearances, his piss has been clean.

822
00:53:13,638 --> 00:53:16,630
But he was a no-show at work today.
He didn't call in, nothing.

823
00:53:16,807 --> 00:53:18,638
He knows the system.

824
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:21,073
The perfect place in the subway
to stop the train.

825
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:23,975
He's been out a month.
This wasn't planned in three weeks.

826
00:53:24,148 --> 00:53:27,172
Find out Ramos's cellmates,
who worked in the laundry with him.

827
00:53:27,349 --> 00:53:29,647
Call lists, visitors lists ASAP.

828
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:42,889
<i>105 North Avenue.</i>

829
00:53:53,508 --> 00:53:54,634
- Shit! Look out!
- Shit!

830
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:07,353
<i>The market has tumbled
nearly 7 percent...</i>

831
00:54:07,522 --> 00:54:09,581
<i>... as investors continue
to react to events...</i>

832
00:54:09,757 --> 00:54:11,156
They just came off the bridge.

833
00:54:11,325 --> 00:54:14,352
Why didn't we send
a helicopter for the money?

834
00:54:16,264 --> 00:54:19,131
Now remember what I said
about talking through deadlines.

835
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,929
We better have a plan B in case
the money isn't there on the dot.

836
00:54:23,104 --> 00:54:24,901
Put him on his heels.
He knows things.

837
00:54:25,073 --> 00:54:26,938
- We know things too, right?
- Right.

838
00:54:27,108 --> 00:54:30,135
Ask him about Phil Ramos. All right?
Just get him talking.

839
00:54:30,312 --> 00:54:31,336
You can do it.

840
00:54:35,516 --> 00:54:37,450
- Hey, Ryder.
- The money here yet?

841
00:54:37,618 --> 00:54:38,642
<i>On the way.</i>

842
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,981
Then what the fuck
are you calling me for?

843
00:54:41,155 --> 00:54:43,055
Actually, I just called to talk.

844
00:54:44,192 --> 00:54:46,353
<i>Oh, yeah?
What do you wanna talk about?</i>

845
00:54:47,128 --> 00:54:50,392
You said that
being in the motorman's cab...

846
00:54:50,564 --> 00:54:52,964
...was a little like
being in a confessional, right?

847
00:54:53,133 --> 00:54:54,157
Yeah?

848
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:57,167
I was thinking maybe it's like
being in a prison cell too.

849
00:54:57,337 --> 00:55:00,829
What are you trying to say? That
if I get caught, I'd better get used to it?

850
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:03,703
No, I'm just wondering.
Maybe you're already used to it.

851
00:55:03,877 --> 00:55:08,438
I'm wondering maybe that's how
you meet a guy like Phil Ramos?

852
00:55:08,614 --> 00:55:10,241
How the fuck he know that?

853
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:12,441
Why don't you tell me?
Then we'll both know.

854
00:55:12,618 --> 00:55:13,915
After today's confession...

855
00:55:14,086 --> 00:55:16,077
<i>... you're gonna find your ass
in prison too.</i>

856
00:55:16,255 --> 00:55:18,917
Which is my point. I want you
to hook me up on the inside.

857
00:55:19,091 --> 00:55:22,218
You know everybody. This way,
when I come up with my heist plan...

858
00:55:22,393 --> 00:55:24,362
...you know, I'll cut you in.

859
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,158
I can see I've inspired you.
Okay, I got a story for you.

860
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:30,302
<i>It might help you in prison.
You wanna hear it? We got a minute.</i>

861
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:31,936
I'd like to hear a little story.

862
00:55:32,104 --> 00:55:34,698
<i>So back in the day,
when I was a high roller...</i>

863
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:36,398
When were you ever a high roller?

864
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:40,033
<i>I told you I fed this city breakfast.</i>

865
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,235
Grits and eggs?

866
00:55:41,412 --> 00:55:43,539
Something like that.
Anyway, back in the day...

867
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,115
...I took this chick to Iceland.

868
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:48,886
Iceland? Is that where
all the high rollers go?

869
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:52,114
Six hours from Kennedy
and the nightclub scene is...

870
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:53,519
...you know, is intense.

871
00:55:53,692 --> 00:55:55,556
<i>I thought I'd take this chick
to Iceland.</i>

872
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,126
<i>- What's her name?
- Ludvika.</i>

873
00:55:57,295 --> 00:56:00,264
She was Lithuanian.
She was an ass model.

874
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:02,123
She asked you what?

875
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,033
You heard of hand models?

876
00:56:04,202 --> 00:56:06,602
<i>Advertisement?
Right, she was an ass model.</i>

877
00:56:06,771 --> 00:56:10,138
She did jeans and, you know,
magazines and shit.

878
00:56:10,308 --> 00:56:12,468
Anyway,
it was Fashion Week in New York...

879
00:56:12,643 --> 00:56:14,611
...and I took her to Iceland.

880
00:56:14,778 --> 00:56:18,976
Ludvika, Lithuanian, ass model,
Iceland, you took her to the ice.

881
00:56:19,149 --> 00:56:20,616
<i>- So what?
- Well, for 500 bucks...</i>

882
00:56:20,784 --> 00:56:23,275
<i>... they'll take you on a dogsled ride
on a glacier.</i>

883
00:56:23,453 --> 00:56:26,123
<i>- Dogsled?
- Yeah. And you know the old saying:</i>

884
00:56:26,124 --> 00:56:27,324
<i>If you're not the lead dog...</i>

885
00:56:27,724 --> 00:56:29,824
<i>...the view never changes?
- Right.</i>

886
00:56:29,825 --> 00:56:33,782
Otherwise, you're always looking at
the asshole of the dog in front of you.

887
00:56:33,783 --> 00:56:35,884
<i>Be funny in a minute
when I get to that part.</i>

888
00:56:35,885 --> 00:56:37,085
It's funny now.

889
00:56:54,186 --> 00:56:56,786
And it's 8 in the morning,
we haven't been to bed yet...

890
00:56:56,986 --> 00:56:58,987
<i>... and we're tooling across
this glacier...</i>

891
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:02,386
<i>... and I got this hangover that's
creeping up the back of my neck...</i>

892
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:04,587
...and guess what I'm looking at?

893
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:08,187
Obviously you're staring at the ass
of the dog in front of you.

894
00:57:08,287 --> 00:57:09,387
You got it.

895
00:57:09,486 --> 00:57:12,387
So this dog, out of nowhere,
just lifts its hind legs up...

896
00:57:12,587 --> 00:57:14,687
...and puts them in
the harness there...

897
00:57:14,887 --> 00:57:18,088
<i>... and just takes a shit
while he's running on his front paws.</i>

898
00:57:18,287 --> 00:57:20,588
So he's dumping
and running all at the same time.

899
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:22,988
Now, that's multi-fucking-tasking
if you ask me.

900
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,989
Get out of here. Did it hit you?

901
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:26,790
Shit always hits you, man.

902
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,389
I didn't know it at the time,
but it was profound.

903
00:57:42,489 --> 00:57:44,589
<i>- Profound? You lost me.
- Yeah.</i>

904
00:57:44,689 --> 00:57:48,690
Well, you know, when I went to
prison later on, which you called...

905
00:57:48,889 --> 00:57:51,490
...I had trouble going to the toilet.

906
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,090
<i>You know, a privacy thing.</i>

907
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:58,891
<i>And I couldn't take a shit.
I was scared shitless, literally.</i>

908
00:57:59,491 --> 00:58:01,092
So you know what I thought of?

909
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:03,692
<i>- You thought of the dog.
- That's right.</i>

910
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:07,692
<i>I thought if that dog could do
what it needed to do, so could I.</i>

911
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:09,692
Saved my fucking life.

912
00:58:10,992 --> 00:58:12,692
Wow, that is profound.

913
00:58:12,892 --> 00:58:14,192
Keep going.

914
00:58:14,693 --> 00:58:16,992
And, you know, it's...

915
00:58:17,092 --> 00:58:19,793
People adapt. It's like you and I,
like today.

916
00:58:19,893 --> 00:58:21,693
We didn't know how it
was gonna start.

917
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:23,393
<i>- Wrong.
- Wrong what?</i>

918
00:58:23,493 --> 00:58:25,393
I knew exactly
how it was gonna start.

919
00:58:25,593 --> 00:58:28,094
Yeah, but do you know
how it's gonna end?

920
00:58:29,594 --> 00:58:32,094
- I'm tired of talking to you, Garber.
- Wait a minute.

921
00:58:32,294 --> 00:58:34,694
Call me when the money comes in.
You got four minutes.

922
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:39,894
I don't know what he looks like,
but he sounds good.

923
00:58:40,095 --> 00:58:42,095
Fucking talk shit,
what are you doing?

924
00:58:42,295 --> 00:58:44,895
He's got a sexy voice though.
He'd be my bitch in prison.

925
00:58:45,096 --> 00:58:46,496
Where are we?

926
00:58:46,596 --> 00:58:49,196
Less than 10 blocks away.
We'll make it.

927
00:58:57,396 --> 00:58:58,598
Fuck, look out!

928
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:17,899
Jesus.

929
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,601
Shit. The goddamn money car
crashed on 1 st Avenue.

930
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:27,601
Get a radio car,
put it on the motorcycles, get it there.

931
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,601
Watch it. Easy.

932
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:32,601
Here, lean up here.

933
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:34,301
Hey, get that last bag.

934
00:59:59,503 --> 01:00:02,003
- You got 22 seconds, Garber.
- All right, we just had...

935
01:00:02,203 --> 01:00:06,002
...a little problem over here, that's all.
- I don't care.

936
01:00:13,103 --> 01:00:14,903
- Two minutes.
- Just tell him it's here.

937
01:00:15,003 --> 01:00:17,503
- How's he gonna know?
- I don't think we should lie.

938
01:00:17,604 --> 01:00:19,804
- Tell him the truth.
- No, tell him it's there.

939
01:00:19,904 --> 01:00:21,004
Tell him the truth?

940
01:00:21,904 --> 01:00:23,105
He's gonna make me do it.

941
01:00:34,306 --> 01:00:38,307
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
- Tell him the truth or lie?

942
01:00:38,507 --> 01:00:40,508
- Tell him the truth.
- Tell him it's there.

943
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:42,707
- Four, three...
- Tell him it's here.

944
01:00:42,907 --> 01:00:44,409
- It's here.
- Two, one.

945
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:47,209
The money's there,
it's at 42nd and Vanderbilt.

946
01:00:50,509 --> 01:00:53,510
Liar! Motherfucking liar!

947
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:54,910
Seven.

948
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:59,310
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
- Ryder. All right, listen.

949
01:00:59,411 --> 01:01:01,210
<i>- Lucky lady, up.
- We made a mistake.</i>

950
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:03,710
<i>- I think that's him. That's Ryder.
- Lucky lady, up.</i>

951
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:06,210
- Listen to me, it was an accident.
- Keep talking.

952
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:08,411
Ryder, we made a mistake.
It's my fault.

953
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,310
- The car crashed.
- Tell him something!

954
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:12,311
- That's why the money's not there.
- Up!

955
01:01:13,811 --> 01:01:14,911
- Up!
- Wait.

956
01:01:15,211 --> 01:01:16,911
- Fuck, no.
- Get up!

957
01:01:17,111 --> 01:01:18,512
Get back in line!

958
01:01:18,711 --> 01:01:20,511
Ryder, like one minute
it's gonna take.

959
01:01:25,512 --> 01:01:27,912
<i>Don't do this, for God's sake.
It was an accident.</i>

960
01:01:28,012 --> 01:01:29,212
- Come on.
- Wait.

961
01:01:29,412 --> 01:01:30,612
It's the only plan I got.

962
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,412
Ryder, listen, it was an accident.

963
01:01:32,612 --> 01:01:35,512
It was an accident, Ryder.
We made a mistake.

964
01:01:35,712 --> 01:01:38,212
It was an accident, Ryder!
It was an accident!

965
01:01:38,412 --> 01:01:39,812
Come on, motherfucker!

966
01:01:40,513 --> 01:01:42,112
Oh, shit.

967
01:01:43,813 --> 01:01:45,013
God!

968
01:01:46,013 --> 01:01:47,312
Oh, my God.

969
01:01:53,413 --> 01:01:56,614
ESU Team 1 to Sniper 1,
do you have a shot?

970
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:58,814
That's your fault.

971
01:02:05,114 --> 01:02:06,914
I got an easy shot. Please advise.

972
01:02:07,816 --> 01:02:09,715
<i>- Stand by.
- Roger that.</i>

973
01:02:21,616 --> 01:02:22,816
Shit!

974
01:02:40,018 --> 01:02:41,218
What the fuck happened?

975
01:02:42,618 --> 01:02:45,718
Accidental discharge.
I just got bit by a fucking rat.

976
01:02:46,118 --> 01:02:47,319
It's accidental discharge.

977
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:49,920
Who? Who got shot? Was it Ryder?

978
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,320
No, it was Ramos.

979
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,320
- Sergeant? The money there yet?
- What? Yes, yes.

980
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,221
<i>- Are you there?
- Get in here.</i>

981
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:08,620
Shoot any motherfucker that moves.

982
01:03:09,221 --> 01:03:11,020
- That's an order!
- Shit on your orders.

983
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:12,322
<i>Can you hear me, Ryder?</i>

984
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:16,222
Okay,
now somebody else has to die.

985
01:03:16,323 --> 01:03:17,723
Two people, maybe all of us.

986
01:03:21,523 --> 01:03:22,623
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

987
01:03:22,723 --> 01:03:25,424
I heard you, but you gotta understand,
the circumstances...

988
01:03:25,623 --> 01:03:27,223
...they're different now for you.

989
01:03:27,423 --> 01:03:28,522
<i>- You gotta rethink.
- No.</i>

990
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:29,823
You got to adapt.

991
01:03:30,022 --> 01:03:33,023
No, I gave you instructions,
and you know the consequences!

992
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:34,723
I mean, don't you have a plan B?

993
01:03:34,823 --> 01:03:36,824
No, plan B is enforcing plan A!

994
01:03:37,024 --> 01:03:40,223
And the minute you stop believing me,
motherfucker, that's it!

995
01:03:40,324 --> 01:03:43,125
I believe you, you gotta believe
and understand those cops...

996
01:03:43,325 --> 01:03:45,726
...are gonna be down
and next to you any second...

997
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:48,526
Bring it, man! Let them
unload their guns, I don't care!

998
01:03:48,726 --> 01:03:50,926
And what's the point of that?
What's the point?

999
01:03:51,126 --> 01:03:53,526
I told you we all owe God a death.

1000
01:03:53,726 --> 01:03:56,626
And now it's two minutes
past the deadline, two minutes.

1001
01:03:56,826 --> 01:04:00,026
Which means two people,
almost three, have to go.

1002
01:04:00,226 --> 01:04:01,526
They have to die.

1003
01:04:04,226 --> 01:04:06,426
The money's there, Ryder.
Nobody else has to die.

1004
01:04:06,626 --> 01:04:07,627
<i>The money's there.</i>

1005
01:04:07,826 --> 01:04:12,127
<i>I don't know what you owe God. I can
tell you, you can't pay him in cash.</i>

1006
01:04:14,127 --> 01:04:16,428
You never see a U-Haul
behind a hearse, Ryder.

1007
01:04:16,627 --> 01:04:20,128
<i>The Egyptians tried it. It doesn't work.
You can't take the money with you.</i>

1008
01:04:21,828 --> 01:04:23,228
<i>Ryder?</i>

1009
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:25,628
<i>You can't take the money with you.</i>

1010
01:04:26,328 --> 01:04:30,229
All this talk of God,
I think I need to pray.

1011
01:04:30,429 --> 01:04:32,129
Give me a minute.

1012
01:04:35,429 --> 01:04:36,430
I can do that.

1013
01:04:42,531 --> 01:04:43,931
You did good, Walter.

1014
01:04:48,031 --> 01:04:50,131
What's the reality of getting in,
ending this?

1015
01:04:50,331 --> 01:04:52,632
We'd have to be willing to accept
heavy casualties.

1016
01:04:52,832 --> 01:04:54,732
It's a hard choice, but I say make it.

1017
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:59,032
New York City does not have
an acceptable casualty rate.

1018
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:01,132
This is your area,
what do you suggest?

1019
01:05:01,332 --> 01:05:04,533
We should buy time. So far this
son of a bitch hasn't allowed us to.

1020
01:05:04,632 --> 01:05:06,833
This might be the first time
we got through.

1021
01:05:06,933 --> 01:05:09,533
Trust your man? He confessed
to a felony 20 minutes ago.

1022
01:05:09,733 --> 01:05:12,834
There are people down there
who are alive because of him.

1023
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:15,033
Until we change the rules
or hope runs out...

1024
01:05:15,233 --> 01:05:18,035
...we should stick with the situation
we have now.

1025
01:05:19,435 --> 01:05:20,835
Do what you need to do.

1026
01:05:32,235 --> 01:05:33,835
Hey, Garber, you there?

1027
01:05:34,436 --> 01:05:36,536
<i>- Yeah, I'm here.
- Speak up.</i>

1028
01:05:36,635 --> 01:05:38,336
I'm here.

1029
01:05:39,136 --> 01:05:41,636
<i>- I talked to God.
- That's good. What did he say?</i>

1030
01:05:41,836 --> 01:05:44,537
He said I should trust in him.
All others, pay cash.

1031
01:05:44,737 --> 01:05:46,936
How soon can you get it down here?

1032
01:05:48,338 --> 01:05:51,738
From that station, it would take them
about five minutes to walk it down.

1033
01:05:51,938 --> 01:05:54,137
<i>- No can do.
- About 10 minutes to walk it down.</i>

1034
01:05:54,337 --> 01:05:55,637
No, no, no, I mean you, man.

1035
01:05:55,837 --> 01:05:57,937
How long would it take you
to come down here?

1036
01:05:59,037 --> 01:06:00,637
Don't understand.
What do you mean?

1037
01:06:00,737 --> 01:06:02,338
I mean you. I wanna meet you.

1038
01:06:02,538 --> 01:06:05,638
And if you bring it,
I know the cops aren't bringing it.

1039
01:06:06,538 --> 01:06:09,338
Well, you know, I don't know
how I'm gonna carry that money.

1040
01:06:09,538 --> 01:06:11,938
- It must weigh...
- Two-hundred and twenty pounds.

1041
01:06:12,138 --> 01:06:13,839
Stick it in a wheelbarrow
or something.

1042
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:16,339
Why are we discussing weight?
Shouldn't you think:

1043
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:19,639
- "Get the fuck out of there"?
- Okay, get the fuck out of there.

1044
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,739
Good, that's progress.
Now, look, plan B. Your idea.

1045
01:06:22,939 --> 01:06:26,238
And part of plan B is you, Garber,
deliver that money...

1046
01:06:26,439 --> 01:06:29,239
...or I kill another hostage,
you got that?

1047
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:35,139
You got seven minutes, buddy boy.

1048
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,141
You got six minutes and 55 seconds,
check me.

1049
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:49,142
Do it!

1050
01:06:50,942 --> 01:06:51,942
I check.

1051
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:56,142
And tell that sleazebag negotiator
to call me when you've got the money.

1052
01:06:59,843 --> 01:07:01,543
You don't have to do this.

1053
01:07:26,646 --> 01:07:29,747
Finally somebody got their head
out of their ass, huh?

1054
01:07:34,947 --> 01:07:35,947
Hello?

1055
01:07:36,147 --> 01:07:38,447
Hey, how you doing, baby?
What are you doing?

1056
01:07:39,447 --> 01:07:42,948
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm watching the thing, the hostages.

1057
01:07:43,148 --> 01:07:46,448
They mentioned you. They said a
dispatcher was talking to the terrorists.

1058
01:07:46,648 --> 01:07:48,548
Yeah, yeah, they're not terrorists.

1059
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:51,047
They are if they're down there
waving guns.

1060
01:07:51,147 --> 01:07:53,548
Right, right.
Listen, Therese, are you listening?

1061
01:07:53,748 --> 01:07:57,248
- I'm listening.
- Look, I'm the one that...

1062
01:07:57,448 --> 01:08:00,149
You're right. I was the one
that's been talking to them.

1063
01:08:00,849 --> 01:08:04,049
I knew it. I am so proud of you.

1064
01:08:04,249 --> 01:08:06,749
After everything, all this,
them trying to fire you.

1065
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:09,050
<i>Them sticking you
in a dispatch job and you...</i>

1066
01:08:10,049 --> 01:08:11,249
Where are you?

1067
01:08:11,449 --> 01:08:13,550
I'm at a heliport.

1068
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:15,750
I'm getting ready
to get on a helicopter...

1069
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:20,049
...because they want me to take
the money down to the tunnel.

1070
01:08:20,249 --> 01:08:23,450
What? Are they crazy?

1071
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:26,352
- It's real simple. There's nothing to it.
- Over there.

1072
01:08:26,452 --> 01:08:30,152
What it is, is he knows I'm not a cop,
so he wants me to come down...

1073
01:08:30,352 --> 01:08:32,553
Is it all right if I wait here?
Can I wait here?

1074
01:08:32,753 --> 01:08:36,053
They need me to take the money down
because they know I'm not a cop...

1075
01:08:36,253 --> 01:08:40,054
...and, you know, they're saying
that he might kill somebody, honey.

1076
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:43,254
Well, then somebody has to die,
because you can't.

1077
01:08:43,354 --> 01:08:44,854
He's talking to his wife.

1078
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:47,255
I understand, baby.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1079
01:08:47,355 --> 01:08:49,353
- Just tell Angela at the meet...
- Let's go!

1080
01:08:49,554 --> 01:08:51,054
When she runs over the hurdles.

1081
01:08:51,254 --> 01:08:53,354
Tell her to run straight through
the hurdles.

1082
01:08:53,454 --> 01:08:56,854
- Just like I always tell her, okay?
- Come on, we gotta go.

1083
01:08:57,054 --> 01:08:59,155
You tell her yourself.

1084
01:08:59,254 --> 01:09:01,355
<i>- Now, you listen to me.
- Yeah, I'm listening.</i>

1085
01:09:01,555 --> 01:09:04,957
Now, you do what you have to do,
but we need milk.

1086
01:09:05,156 --> 01:09:07,457
So on your way home,
I want you to bring a gallon.

1087
01:09:07,657 --> 01:09:09,957
Of milk? Okay.

1088
01:09:10,157 --> 01:09:11,557
You promise.

1089
01:09:11,757 --> 01:09:14,157
Why do we...? Why a gallon?
Why not a half a gallon?

1090
01:09:14,357 --> 01:09:17,057
Just bring a gallon. A gallon.

1091
01:09:17,557 --> 01:09:19,557
Okay. Okay.

1092
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:23,057
I can get a half a gallon,
I'll get a half a gallon.

1093
01:09:23,657 --> 01:09:24,857
I gotta go.

1094
01:09:28,757 --> 01:09:30,258
All right, thanks, guys.

1095
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:48,360
Put your... Put your headset on.

1096
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:03,962
You ever do anything like this before?
You know, go in unarmed?

1097
01:10:04,162 --> 01:10:06,162
Yeah. Two years ago, Brooklyn.

1098
01:10:06,361 --> 01:10:10,062
Flatbush Avenue.
I got the hostages out.

1099
01:10:12,862 --> 01:10:14,062
And the guy with the gun?

1100
01:10:15,562 --> 01:10:18,462
The guy with the gun,
didn't end well for him.

1101
01:10:18,862 --> 01:10:21,462
- For the guy with the gun?
- Yeah.

1102
01:10:27,263 --> 01:10:30,063
It's nice seeing it
from this perspective, huh?

1103
01:10:30,964 --> 01:10:33,063
You can see what you're fighting for.

1104
01:10:48,364 --> 01:10:50,664
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1105
01:10:53,965 --> 01:10:55,065
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

1106
01:10:56,064 --> 01:10:57,565
Yeah.

1107
01:11:01,666 --> 01:11:03,867
<i>Well, do you love me back?</i>

1108
01:11:04,367 --> 01:11:06,667
<i>Can't really talk right now.</i>

1109
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,568
<i>All you have to say is "Yes."</i>

1110
01:11:14,668 --> 01:11:17,168
<i>That's a lot less words than saying,
"I can't talk."</i>

1111
01:11:22,568 --> 01:11:25,669
<i>I'm having a really weird
fucking day.</i>

1112
01:11:28,569 --> 01:11:30,670
Oh, God.

1113
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:34,270
If we'd anticipated this,
we could have made a lot of money.

1114
01:11:38,271 --> 01:11:39,871
What kind of guy
would you expect...

1115
01:11:40,071 --> 01:11:42,272
...to take a model to Iceland
for the weekend?

1116
01:11:42,372 --> 01:11:44,270
- An ass model.
- An ass model.

1117
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:47,771
- A Wall Street guy.
- A Wall Street guy.

1118
01:11:55,472 --> 01:11:57,072
He's here!

1119
01:11:57,572 --> 01:11:59,972
<i>The one-hour time limit
reported earlier has expired.</i>

1120
01:12:00,172 --> 01:12:04,673
<i>We're not sure who this is. It could
be hostage negotiators or detectives.</i>

1121
01:12:04,873 --> 01:12:07,373
<i>Once we have any updates,
we'll be back to you live.</i>

1122
01:12:14,772 --> 01:12:15,972
- Camonetti.
- How are you?

1123
01:12:16,173 --> 01:12:18,273
- Mr. Garber, Lieutenant Staley.
- Pleasure.

1124
01:12:18,474 --> 01:12:21,074
- You got a radio set up to the train?
- Set up right there.

1125
01:12:21,275 --> 01:12:23,574
You can talk to the train
or to Rail Control.

1126
01:12:23,775 --> 01:12:27,175
Okay. Just do what he says,
and remember everything you see.

1127
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:28,776
Let's go.

1128
01:12:31,075 --> 01:12:33,176
So who the hell did you fuck
to get this job?

1129
01:12:33,276 --> 01:12:35,776
Myself. It was easier than it looked.

1130
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:38,676
Yeah, fucking yourself always is.

1131
01:12:42,076 --> 01:12:45,576
<i>Pelham 123, come in.
Pelham 123, come in.</i>

1132
01:12:45,676 --> 01:12:46,876
Who am I talking to?

1133
01:12:46,976 --> 01:12:50,076
This is Lieutenant Camonetti.
We spoke earlier.

1134
01:12:50,277 --> 01:12:53,377
Yeah, you're the greaseball.
What'd you do, go out for a pizza?

1135
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,377
<i>What's my money doing, man?
Where is it?</i>

1136
01:12:55,577 --> 01:12:59,378
Mr. Garber is in the tunnel.
The money is two minutes away.

1137
01:12:59,578 --> 01:13:01,577
Oh, Garber, man.
That is a dependable man.

1138
01:13:01,778 --> 01:13:03,278
He's a good man too.

1139
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:05,378
Absolutely. How about you, Ryder?

1140
01:13:05,478 --> 01:13:07,878
Everybody's got some good in them,
don't you think?

1141
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:09,979
Is this where
you try to get through to me?

1142
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,480
I don't think so, motherfucker.
Now I got three instructions for you.

1143
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,780
Number one,
when this conversation is over...

1144
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,880
...I want you to restore the power
to the whole sector.

1145
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,381
Number two,
I want you to clear the local tracks...

1146
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,981
...from 68th Street
down to Coney Island.

1147
01:13:24,081 --> 01:13:26,481
<i>And when I say, "Clear,"
I don't wanna see no cops.</i>

1148
01:13:26,581 --> 01:13:27,981
<i>I want all the lights green.</i>

1149
01:13:28,181 --> 01:13:30,082
Don't trip me up with a red,
got that?

1150
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:31,382
Absolutely.

1151
01:13:31,582 --> 01:13:34,581
And number three,
don't play games with me...

1152
01:13:34,782 --> 01:13:39,083
...or I'll track you down and I'll fuck you
in your greaseball ass, motherfucker!

1153
01:13:40,882 --> 01:13:42,283
Over and out.

1154
01:13:45,883 --> 01:13:47,484
Let's go.

1155
01:13:52,384 --> 01:13:53,384
All right.

1156
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:55,984
- Know how to use one of these?
- No.

1157
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:57,984
It's really simple. Okay?

1158
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,485
Safety's on, safety's off.

1159
01:14:00,685 --> 01:14:01,985
On, off.

1160
01:14:02,185 --> 01:14:04,885
Aim at anything you don't like,
you pull the trigger.

1161
01:14:05,086 --> 01:14:07,686
- What if they frisk me?
- We got that covered.

1162
01:14:09,584 --> 01:14:11,485
- That's it?
- That's it.

1163
01:14:12,885 --> 01:14:14,385
It's got a false bottom.

1164
01:14:14,585 --> 01:14:17,284
It's gonna be this one. You got that?

1165
01:14:18,285 --> 01:14:20,285
- I got it.
- Good.

1166
01:14:20,785 --> 01:14:22,185
Don't worry about it.

1167
01:14:23,285 --> 01:14:25,285
Just don't fuck it up.

1168
01:14:30,285 --> 01:14:31,585
Okay.

1169
01:14:31,786 --> 01:14:33,786
We got an ID on Ryder.

1170
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:37,886
Dennis Ford. He was released from
Clinton Correctional two weeks ago.

1171
01:14:38,086 --> 01:14:39,486
Did a nine-year stretch.

1172
01:14:39,686 --> 01:14:42,186
The last four on the same cell block
as Phil Ramos.

1173
01:14:42,386 --> 01:14:44,887
His name shows up
on an Icelandic Air passenger list...

1174
01:14:45,087 --> 01:14:47,987
...in September of 1998,
right after Fashion Week.

1175
01:14:48,688 --> 01:14:50,988
Dennis Ford. You remember?

1176
01:14:51,088 --> 01:14:53,688
We used his case when
he was running as an example of...

1177
01:14:53,888 --> 01:14:57,390
The kind of nonsense that we would
clean up if I got elected mayor, yeah.

1178
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:58,890
He ran a private equity firm.

1179
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:00,990
His biggest client
was the pension fund.

1180
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:03,190
- He siphoned off...
- Twenty-million dollars.

1181
01:15:03,391 --> 01:15:06,091
He did a plea bargain for three.
The judge gave him 10.

1182
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:08,289
Maybe that's why he's so pissed off.

1183
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:11,990
Judge gave him 10 years because we
didn't recover all of the city's money.

1184
01:15:12,191 --> 01:15:14,190
Couple million unaccounted for.
Seed money.

1185
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:15,390
Seed money? For what?

1186
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:19,492
For today, you play the terrorist card,
you panic the market into a drop.

1187
01:15:19,591 --> 01:15:22,393
You know it's coming, you make
a great deal with $2 million.

1188
01:15:22,592 --> 01:15:24,792
- What about the hostage money?
- That's nothing...

1189
01:15:24,993 --> 01:15:28,492
...compared to the money you could
make. Let's get downtown to the SEC.

1190
01:15:28,693 --> 01:15:30,893
Check the trades,
especially the put options.

1191
01:15:46,193 --> 01:15:49,194
- Good luck, Garber.
- See you when you get back.

1192
01:15:55,194 --> 01:15:57,195
We got company.

1193
01:16:11,896 --> 01:16:12,896
Garber.

1194
01:16:13,397 --> 01:16:17,197
When you put your socks on
this morning, did you ever think...?

1195
01:16:19,098 --> 01:16:20,998
Turn around, let him frisk you.

1196
01:16:24,098 --> 01:16:26,999
I was worried about you.
I thought maybe you'd get lost...

1197
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,699
...but then I remembered
you were a motorman, so...

1198
01:16:29,799 --> 01:16:32,399
These tunnels don't change much,
do they?

1199
01:16:32,599 --> 01:16:34,199
Just the people in them.

1200
01:16:37,599 --> 01:16:39,599
- Are we good?
- It's here. We're good.

1201
01:16:39,799 --> 01:16:41,100
All right, come on up.

1202
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,800
Let's go.

1203
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,701
Damn.
You're taller than I thought you'd be.

1204
01:17:07,901 --> 01:17:10,601
You're good-looking too.
Come on, sit down.

1205
01:17:11,302 --> 01:17:12,602
It's nice to meet you.

1206
01:17:26,804 --> 01:17:28,804
What do you weigh,
about, what, 220?

1207
01:17:29,704 --> 01:17:33,205
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
220 on a good day.

1208
01:17:35,605 --> 01:17:37,405
Oh, that's Ramos.

1209
01:17:38,205 --> 01:17:41,705
He's what you would have called
the brains in the operation.

1210
01:17:43,506 --> 01:17:44,906
Dumb fuck.

1211
01:17:49,407 --> 01:17:52,207
So how long has it been
since you've driven one of these?

1212
01:17:56,008 --> 01:17:58,708
- That's why you brought me here?
- You're a motorman, right?

1213
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:00,809
Once a motorman,
always a motorman.

1214
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:04,708
You play your cards right,
you might get a part of the cut.

1215
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:20,010
Well, this is...

1216
01:18:20,609 --> 01:18:23,110
It's a new train.
I'm not certified on the new trains.

1217
01:18:23,309 --> 01:18:26,609
Well, I got faith in you, man.
But I'm going to ask you one question.

1218
01:18:26,809 --> 01:18:29,609
You know, that thing when you
told your wife about the 35 K...

1219
01:18:29,809 --> 01:18:30,909
...how did she react?

1220
01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:33,709
- We gotta talk about...?
- Don't be sensitive.

1221
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:36,009
- I'm not being...
- Did she freak out or what?

1222
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:38,509
She wasn't happy,
but she understood.

1223
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:39,909
Well, that's love, right?

1224
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:42,610
No, that's marriage.
That's another thing.

1225
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:45,310
You think they're gonna move
that train?

1226
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:49,112
Seems like a possibility. How are we
with street-level, emergency exits?

1227
01:18:49,312 --> 01:18:50,412
I got a blanket.

1228
01:18:50,612 --> 01:18:54,012
I got radio cars and a man
at every exit from 42nd to South Ferry.

1229
01:18:54,512 --> 01:18:56,112
We gotta go.

1230
01:18:56,312 --> 01:18:58,312
Hey, Camonetti.

1231
01:18:58,712 --> 01:19:00,012
Fucking greaseball, man.

1232
01:19:00,812 --> 01:19:03,012
Hey, greaseball, speak up.

1233
01:19:03,112 --> 01:19:05,412
I see red. I don't see green.

1234
01:19:05,612 --> 01:19:07,612
What's taking so fucking long?

1235
01:19:07,812 --> 01:19:09,112
Blanket is not tucked in yet.

1236
01:19:09,313 --> 01:19:11,713
Stall him. I need two minutes,
buy me two minutes.

1237
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:13,413
Haven't cleared the tracks yet.

1238
01:19:13,513 --> 01:19:16,713
Mr. Ryder, we'll be up and ready
in less than two minutes.

1239
01:19:16,914 --> 01:19:18,713
We're gonna move forward here,
okay?

1240
01:19:18,913 --> 01:19:21,713
We're gonna move forward,
and if we get onto a red signal...

1241
01:19:21,813 --> 01:19:23,114
...and the brakes trip up...

1242
01:19:23,314 --> 01:19:26,014
...your friend Walter Garber's
getting it in the head.

1243
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:31,016
- You got it?
- Yes, sir. I got it.

1244
01:19:31,216 --> 01:19:32,516
Let's roll, let's roll.

1245
01:19:33,916 --> 01:19:35,316
Hope you were bluffing.

1246
01:19:35,516 --> 01:19:38,517
Yeah, I'm bluffing, man.
You gotta say what you gotta say.

1247
01:19:40,616 --> 01:19:43,617
You thought by coming down here,
you'd be redeemed, didn't you?

1248
01:19:43,817 --> 01:19:45,817
God bless you, Garber.

1249
01:19:47,017 --> 01:19:49,317
You're more fucked up than I am.

1250
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:52,518
At least the same fucked up.

1251
01:19:52,718 --> 01:19:54,518
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1252
01:20:00,718 --> 01:20:01,818
Let's go.

1253
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,020
She's on the move.

1254
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,221
Put some speed on it.

1255
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,520
He's by me, headed south.
Male, black, at the controls.

1256
01:20:35,021 --> 01:20:36,421
Motherfuckers.

1257
01:20:36,521 --> 01:20:40,321
You're playing with fire, my man.
I wanna see them green.

1258
01:20:40,422 --> 01:20:43,422
Turn to green or I'll put a hole
in Garber's head right now.

1259
01:20:43,522 --> 01:20:45,122
- Do it!
- We believe you.

1260
01:20:45,322 --> 01:20:46,923
We're moving as fast as we can.

1261
01:20:47,123 --> 01:20:50,823
- What happens if they run a red light?
- It'll trip the brakes.

1262
01:20:51,023 --> 01:20:52,423
Coming up on the first one.

1263
01:20:55,523 --> 01:20:58,823
There, that's what I'm looking for.
That's what I'm looking for.

1264
01:20:59,322 --> 01:21:00,522
Here he comes, right now.

1265
01:21:13,725 --> 01:21:16,026
Garber's driving the train.
Sniper confirmed it.

1266
01:21:16,126 --> 01:21:18,926
What are you saying, he's
in on it? There ain't no way.

1267
01:21:19,126 --> 01:21:21,026
Sniper killed Ramos,
he was their driver...

1268
01:21:21,226 --> 01:21:23,026
...they probably need Garber
to drive.

1269
01:21:31,627 --> 01:21:35,628
They get to Coney Island, they hit the
trippers and the brakes will come on.

1270
01:21:40,129 --> 01:21:41,529
- Is that 33rd?
- Yes, sir.

1271
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:44,229
- How far to the signal?
- About a tenth of a mile.

1272
01:21:44,429 --> 01:21:47,329
You stop when we get there.
We're moving out. You got that?

1273
01:21:47,529 --> 01:21:48,930
I'm slowing down now.

1274
01:21:57,529 --> 01:21:58,630
Are they slowing down?

1275
01:21:58,829 --> 01:22:01,030
They have to.
They're coming up to a signal point.

1276
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:07,730
What is that?

1277
01:22:07,931 --> 01:22:09,931
You're the old motorman,
you tell me.

1278
01:22:24,932 --> 01:22:28,232
- She stopped just below 33rd Street.
- What the hell are they doing?

1279
01:22:28,332 --> 01:22:29,832
Oh, jeez.

1280
01:22:30,032 --> 01:22:31,132
Why that little stop?

1281
01:22:31,332 --> 01:22:33,233
Train has to stop at signal points.

1282
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:34,633
Some kind of an override?

1283
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:37,833
Yep, some kind of an override,
that's right.

1284
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:41,833
There we go.
Okay, let's move out. Let's go, let's go.

1285
01:23:07,936 --> 01:23:09,636
Roosevelt tunnel, which way?

1286
01:23:10,936 --> 01:23:12,637
Which way?

1287
01:23:18,537 --> 01:23:20,637
She's moving again.
Next stop, 28th Street.

1288
01:23:21,137 --> 01:23:22,537
Why that little stop, huh?

1289
01:23:22,637 --> 01:23:25,036
- I told you, the signal points.
- How do you know...

1290
01:23:25,137 --> 01:23:28,237
...they didn't set the throttle, jump?
- We got every exit covered.

1291
01:23:28,437 --> 01:23:29,737
There's nowhere to go.

1292
01:23:29,937 --> 01:23:32,437
Listen, the throttle can't be set.
It has to be held.

1293
01:23:32,537 --> 01:23:34,638
<i>It's the failsafe,
it's a dead-man's switch.</i>

1294
01:23:34,838 --> 01:23:36,838
Doesn't have a hand
pressing down on it...

1295
01:23:37,038 --> 01:23:40,239
...the train stops cold.
Believe me, they're still aboard.

1296
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:50,741
It's going faster.

1297
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,242
Emri, off the track. Come on.

1298
01:24:20,144 --> 01:24:21,344
Let's go!

1299
01:24:23,944 --> 01:24:26,044
Garber, come on.

1300
01:24:27,744 --> 01:24:29,544
Come on!

1301
01:24:40,845 --> 01:24:43,146
It's gonna derail
before it gets to Coney Island.

1302
01:24:46,946 --> 01:24:49,247
That's it. That's it right there.
Roosevelt tunnel.

1303
01:24:52,146 --> 01:24:54,746
It's a fucking train crossover.
Come on. Cross over now!

1304
01:24:54,846 --> 01:24:57,346
- What?
- Come on, move!

1305
01:25:02,247 --> 01:25:03,447
Hey!

1306
01:25:17,648 --> 01:25:20,549
- Fuck it, let's go!
- We gotta find him!

1307
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:23,149
We don't have time! Let's go!

1308
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:42,151
I love you. I fucking love you.

1309
01:25:42,352 --> 01:25:44,452
<i>Geo, I fucking love you too.</i>

1310
01:25:57,953 --> 01:26:01,054
Hello? Hello?

1311
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,559
We're getting calls.

1312
01:27:15,759 --> 01:27:18,158
Cops on the platform
are seeing passengers...

1313
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:21,960
...nobody in the motorman's booth.
- Believe me, they're still aboard.

1314
01:27:24,861 --> 01:27:26,960
It's all right!
As soon as we hit a red light...

1315
01:27:27,161 --> 01:27:30,761
...the brakes will stop it automatically.
- Yeah, but they're all green!

1316
01:28:37,568 --> 01:28:38,768
Four stops away.

1317
01:28:50,368 --> 01:28:51,568
Two stops.

1318
01:29:05,271 --> 01:29:07,271
Oh, Jesus. The train just stopped.

1319
01:29:15,672 --> 01:29:17,772
I really gotta take that piss.

1320
01:29:19,572 --> 01:29:22,673
There's no hijackers onboard,
just passengers.

1321
01:29:23,773 --> 01:29:25,673
Where was that first stop
that they made?

1322
01:29:25,873 --> 01:29:27,073
Near 34th.

1323
01:29:27,873 --> 01:29:29,773
- That's by the Roosevelt spur.
- The what?

1324
01:29:29,973 --> 01:29:32,974
<i>A derelict tunnel
built under the Waldorf Hotel.</i>

1325
01:29:33,174 --> 01:29:36,774
Converge everything on that area.
Throw a goddamn dragnet over it!

1326
01:30:10,277 --> 01:30:11,877
Hey!

1327
01:30:22,378 --> 01:30:24,078
Freeze!

1328
01:30:37,681 --> 01:30:39,381
Put your hands in the air!

1329
01:31:01,782 --> 01:31:03,382
Hey!

1330
01:31:03,782 --> 01:31:05,382
Hey!

1331
01:31:07,082 --> 01:31:10,282
Hey. Get out, get out, get out.

1332
01:31:10,982 --> 01:31:12,082
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1333
01:31:12,782 --> 01:31:14,082
I'm sorry.

1334
01:31:45,685 --> 01:31:47,385
Out of the... Get out of the way!

1335
01:32:05,089 --> 01:32:06,290
Just go, go, go.

1336
01:32:33,591 --> 01:32:35,392
<i>- 911 operator.
- Hello? Hello?</i>

1337
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:38,291
<i>- This is Walter Garber, MTA.
- How do you spell that?</i>

1338
01:32:38,491 --> 01:32:40,191
Don't worry about how to spell it.

1339
01:32:40,291 --> 01:32:42,191
Just tell Lieutenant Camonetti...

1340
01:32:42,391 --> 01:32:44,791
...that Ryder is headed
to the Manhattan Bridge!

1341
01:33:25,195 --> 01:33:28,796
<i>Cars everywhere. Nobody's
going anywhere for a long time.</i>

1342
01:33:36,796 --> 01:33:37,896
Hey. Hey!

1343
01:33:40,697 --> 01:33:42,398
- Is he in there?
- No, no, no.

1344
01:33:42,598 --> 01:33:43,898
- No.
- Where did he go?

1345
01:33:44,097 --> 01:33:47,498
Brooklyn. He said he couldn't wait,
he started walking.

1346
01:33:47,698 --> 01:33:49,298
This fucking city!

1347
01:34:23,601 --> 01:34:25,403
Come on, you guys. Move out!

1348
01:34:35,302 --> 01:34:37,003
Ryder!

1349
01:34:40,604 --> 01:34:41,703
Don't move.

1350
01:34:43,204 --> 01:34:45,804
So is this how you thought
the day was going to end, huh?

1351
01:34:46,004 --> 01:34:48,004
When you put your socks on
this morning?

1352
01:34:48,104 --> 01:34:50,104
This make you feel better, Garber?

1353
01:34:51,304 --> 01:34:53,305
That make everything okay now?

1354
01:34:53,405 --> 01:34:55,704
No! But it's a start.

1355
01:34:58,905 --> 01:35:00,705
Don't move.

1356
01:35:23,306 --> 01:35:25,307
Don't move!

1357
01:35:27,907 --> 01:35:29,307
Hey!

1358
01:35:31,007 --> 01:35:34,307
Garber Baby boy,
I ain't going back to prison.

1359
01:35:34,507 --> 01:35:38,908
I don't... I don't think you got any...
Any options now or leverage.

1360
01:35:40,408 --> 01:35:41,608
Hey!

1361
01:35:44,109 --> 01:35:45,509
Hey!

1362
01:35:45,709 --> 01:35:48,209
We all owe God a death,
I told you that.

1363
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:50,410
You're wrong, Ryder.
We owe God life.

1364
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:53,210
Life. And that's the life
I gave you back today.

1365
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:55,510
And now you have to
give me something back.

1366
01:35:58,410 --> 01:36:00,310
What are you talking about?

1367
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:03,810
You got a gun in your hand,
I want you to use it. Shoot me.

1368
01:36:04,009 --> 01:36:08,012
No, shoot me before they shoot me,
or I'm gonna kill you.

1369
01:36:08,911 --> 01:36:11,711
I will shoot you.
I don't want to, but I will.

1370
01:36:11,812 --> 01:36:13,112
- Hey!
- I thought you cared.

1371
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,412
- No!
- You said:

1372
01:36:14,512 --> 01:36:17,512
"Ryder. Ryder,
don't you have anyone who cares?"

1373
01:36:17,612 --> 01:36:18,712
I thought that was you.

1374
01:36:18,912 --> 01:36:21,512
- Come on, man, pay it back.
- I'm not gonna shoot you.

1375
01:36:21,712 --> 01:36:23,513
I'm gonna give you 10,
then deal's off.

1376
01:36:23,713 --> 01:36:27,014
I got a gun, I'm gonna use it.
I'm gonna take your life back.

1377
01:36:28,714 --> 01:36:30,913
- Hey!
- Come on, man!

1378
01:36:31,113 --> 01:36:36,613
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1379
01:36:36,813 --> 01:36:40,014
You gonna take this down to zero?
Come on, motherfucker, shoot me!

1380
01:36:40,114 --> 01:36:42,314
I am not going to shoot you!

1381
01:36:43,413 --> 01:36:46,215
Five, four. Come on.

1382
01:36:46,314 --> 01:36:48,415
- Hey!
- Three.

1383
01:36:48,716 --> 01:36:50,016
Police, drop your weapon!

1384
01:36:50,216 --> 01:36:52,716
I'm disappointed in you. Two.

1385
01:37:02,717 --> 01:37:04,917
You're my goddamn hero.

1386
01:37:16,018 --> 01:37:17,919
Drop your weapon!

1387
01:38:03,121 --> 01:38:04,722
Mr. Garber.

1388
01:38:07,122 --> 01:38:09,222
- Interesting day, huh?
- Yes, sir.

1389
01:38:09,421 --> 01:38:11,923
You know, just about every day
I make a speech...

1390
01:38:12,123 --> 01:38:14,323
...and it starts with:

1391
01:38:14,523 --> 01:38:18,123
"I'd like to thank you on behalf of
the city of New York," blah, blah, blah.

1392
01:38:18,223 --> 01:38:20,925
And I never know
who I'm thanking or why.

1393
01:38:21,425 --> 01:38:22,525
But you...

1394
01:38:23,827 --> 01:38:25,327
...did a hell of a thing today.

1395
01:38:25,526 --> 01:38:27,826
You went to bat
for the city of New York.

1396
01:38:27,926 --> 01:38:30,926
And on behalf of me,
I'd like to thank you.

1397
01:38:31,826 --> 01:38:34,926
Well, you're welcome.
I mean, it's been an amazing day.

1398
01:38:35,127 --> 01:38:38,526
Everybody's thanking me all day,
but I appreciate it. You're welcome.

1399
01:38:38,927 --> 01:38:41,127
And I want you to know...

1400
01:38:41,328 --> 01:38:45,027
...that tomorrow, the city of New York
is going to go to bat for you.

1401
01:38:46,728 --> 01:38:49,228
In a big way. You understand?

1402
01:38:49,428 --> 01:38:50,428
Yes, sir.

1403
01:38:51,328 --> 01:38:53,728
And this city
has a very good batting average.

1404
01:38:54,528 --> 01:38:57,328
- I appreciate it.
- All right.

1405
01:38:58,428 --> 01:38:59,428
I'm gonna get home.

1406
01:39:00,028 --> 01:39:01,228
Oh, take my car.

1407
01:39:01,729 --> 01:39:04,329
- No, no, I'll take...
- Put the siren on and everything.

1408
01:39:04,529 --> 01:39:06,228
- There's a siren on there?
- Yes.

1409
01:39:06,428 --> 01:39:08,529
No, I'll take the subway.
But I appreciate it.

1410
01:39:08,729 --> 01:39:09,729
- Really?
- Yeah.

1411
01:39:09,929 --> 01:39:13,330
You know, me, subway all my life.
I get home faster than you anyway.

1412
01:39:13,429 --> 01:39:15,428
Not you, but, you know,
everybody else.

1413
01:39:15,629 --> 01:39:17,129
But thank you, sir.

1414
01:39:17,329 --> 01:39:18,529
You a Yankee fan?

1415
01:39:19,029 --> 01:39:21,729
No. Well, yes. Yes, of course.

1416
01:39:22,529 --> 01:39:23,629
Yeah, right.

1417
01:45:28,665 --> 01:45:31,765
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors.</i>

1418
01:45:32,305 --> 01:46:32,162
