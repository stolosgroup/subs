00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,754
This sucks.

3
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,643
You haven't seen Matt, have you?

4
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,186
Yeah, I saw him go upstairs.

5
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,280
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

6
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,953
Don't dress me.

7
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,455
You're gonna be okay.

8
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,916
The both of you are gonna get through this

9
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,002
because the Lord has a plan for you.

10
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,023
- I know, Mom. But don't put on my shoe.
- You're just gonna pick yourself up

11
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:15,176
and be this wonderful, special guy
you've always been.

12
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,804
Yeah, I don't need you to tie my shoe.

13
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,973
Don't tie it, Mom.

14
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,614
We have to do this soon.

15
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,728
What do you mean by soon?

16
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,077
- The baby's not due for another two weeks.
- Yeah.

17
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,561
Your amniotic fluid's low,

18
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,999
and your daughter's already
a healthy size. So let's get her out.

19
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,169
- It's a girl.
- I heard her. I heard what she said.

20
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,254
Oh, sorry.
Were you waiting to find out?

21
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,548
You would've knew that
if you were our regular doctor,

22
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:57,302
who chose this week of all weeks
to go to Maui, which is insane.

23
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,012
Why not go bodysurf?

24
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,014
You know, it's just our first kid.

25
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:04,142
Also, she's still breech, so I wanna
schedule a cesarean for this evening.

26
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,060
- For this evening?
- Mm-hmm.

27
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,064
Well, I haven't even set up the crib.
I didn't...

28
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,689
Are you serious?

29
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:13,234
See, I knew I should've taken care of it.
You told me to take it off my list.

30
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,613
'Cause I wanted you to take it off
your list. I'm handling it. I got it.

31
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,239
That's really reassuring.

32
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,043
- Honey, I'm handling it.
- Are you really ready for this?

33
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,786
Yes! No... Who's really ready?

34
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,540
Like, what does that mean when you say,
"Are you really ready for this?"

35
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,792
This evening? Can we do it tomorrow?

36
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:34,214
'Cause I got a fantasy football draft.
Um, me and some guys from work.

37
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,549
We put
a nice little pool together, and we...

38
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,426
I'm kiddin'.
Why are you taking me serious?

39
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,269
Stop. Relax, honey, all right?

40
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,555
That's a good one.

41
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,359
- All right.
- You good?

42
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,892
Yeah, my hands started sweatin'.

43
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,101
- I know.
- Yeah.

44
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,229
Whoo!

45
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,400
<i>Why couldn't you guys
give us adequate warning?</i>

46
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,486
Well, we just thought
it'd be fun to surprise you.

47
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,656
We said, "You know, we should have
this baby tonight and mess with Marion."

48
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,718
<i>- Love your sense of humor, Matt.</i>
- Yeah, well, at least I got one. Bye-bye.

49
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,079
Oh, okay. Mom, we'll call you
as soon as it's over, okay? I love you.

50
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,790
<i>No, no!
Skype me while it's happening.</i>

51
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,459
- What? Mom!
- Okay, now we're just being weird.

52
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,920
<i>I want to be in the room with my daughter</i>

53
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,881
<i>and to see my granddaughter
when she enters the world.</i>

54
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,591
Well, I'll be here to take care of her.

55
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,551
<i>Like you took care of Cousin Janey's baby?</i>

56
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,345
Mom, that is ancient history.

57
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,490
- Here we go. Here we go.
<i>- Not that ancient.</i>

58
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,557
<i>You don't put a baby on your lap</i>

59
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,810
<i>and then strap a seat belt over you</i>

60
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,981
<i>in the passenger seat
in an automobile driving to 7-Eleven.</i>

61
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,793
I know you don't hold a baby
in your lap and strap a seat belt over you

62
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,462
while you in the passenger seat
of an automobile driving to 7-Eleven.

63
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,362
I know that!

64
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,281
<i>Terrific. Skype me.</i>

65
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,367
<i>Sweetie pie, Mommy will see you tomorrow.</i>

66
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,411
- Okay, bye. Bye.
<i>- I-</i>-

67
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,247
Give Daddy
a kiss, hmm?

68
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,333
And a kiss from Mommy.

69
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,417
Two kisses.

70
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,211
- Wake up.
- Oh my God.

71
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,796
I'm ready. I'm ready to dance.

72
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,931
- Matt. Hey, man.
- Hey.

73
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,015
What's goin' on?

74
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,977
Oh hey,
stay away from that tuna casserole.

75
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,646
The one in the middle tastes like ass.

76
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,400
My mom
made that casserole, Oscar.

77
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:23,239
It's really good.
It's really... It's got, like, a tang.

78
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,284
- It's all right, man. It's okay.
- Like a tangy...

79
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,287
Come here.

80
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,331
Matt.

81
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,957
- Jordan, I don't...
- Come here.

82
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,209
Nope, come here.
Bring it in. You need this.

83
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,836
Bring it in.

84
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,923
Let it out. Breathe, breathe.

85
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,926
Come on, man.

86
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,721
Let me tell you something. That speech...

87
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,722
Your speech.

88
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:51,184
You went up there, and you talked.

89
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,564
I don't, um...

90
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,944
I don't know what to say.

91
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,782
I... I would've assumed
you'd have written something,

92
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,034
but you said, "No, I'm freestyling this."

93
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,287
Okay, we done?
'Cause I can't do this right now.

94
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,082
- Please.
- No. Nope, Matt. Look at me.

95
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,793
- You can, and let me tell you why.
- You're not listening to me.

96
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,236
Remember Camp Winapoo?
You remember we went to Camp Winapoo?

97
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,631
- I do.
- And you got the poison ivy in your face.

98
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,509
Your face started blistering.
It was... it was bubbling, and the bumps...

99
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,303
Then the bumps was poppin',
so you had pus comin' out of your face.

100
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,971
And you looked crazy as hell, right?

101
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,055
You came to lunch,
and your crush was there, Marcy.

102
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,433
You used to love Marcy.

103
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,311
And when she saw him, she screamed.

104
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,356
- And you was devastated.
- Yeah.

105
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,483
- But you got through that.
- Yeah.

106
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,401
You got through that?

107
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,195
Because you're strong and confident.

108
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,947
And you'll get through this too.

109
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,035
This is so much worse than that.

110
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,663
How is that the same?

111
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,998
- I'm just trying...
- I promise you...

112
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,876
I'mma punch you in the face.
Don't say nothin' else to me.

113
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,378
- Wow...
- I told you I can't.

114
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,713
Jordan, I swear to God.

115
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,924
- Why you ballin' up your fists?
- Swear to God. Stop.

116
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,851
- How do you feel?
- Good.

117
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,978
- It's gonna be okay, all right?
- Okay.

118
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,312
I love you so much.

119
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,607
- I love my anesthesiologist.
- Stop it. Stop playin'.

120
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,236
- You're so beautiful.
<i>- Matt! Matt!</i>

You're doing great, Liz.
Might wanna look away now, Matt.

124
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,369
It's happening.
I wanna look, but I don't wanna look.

125
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,497
But I do wanna look,
but I don't want to look.

126

Okay? How we doin', doc?

- Love you. How you feelin'?

154
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,305
A little sore but...

155
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,599
- How are you doing, Liz?
- I wanna see Maddy.

156
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,559
Hey.

157
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,519
I thought you might.

158
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,843
Matt, I'm gonna need you
to come around here and help me.

159
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,108
- Gladly.
- She's gonna be a bit wobbly.

160
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,086
- Okay.
- We're gonna take this slow, okay?

161
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,028
Take your time. Take your time.

162
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,574
- Let's get you to the chair. Easy, easy.
- Ready for a 10K.

163
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,535
- All right.
- Guys, I feel light-headed.

164
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,620
Take your time, honey. Take your...

165
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:44,041
Liz? Liz? Liz? What's wrong with her?

166
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,353
- Was she dizzy earlier?
- What's wrong? Liz? I don't know!

167
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,004
- Liz?
- She's having trouble breathing.

168
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,898
- What do you mean?
- I'm gonna get help.

169
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,257
- Look at me!
- Medical emergency!

170
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,800
Liz! Liz! Look at me!

171
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,523
- Give her space.
- What's wrong with her?

172
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,114
- Liz?
- I need an oxygen mask!

173
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,406
- Liz!
- Can you hear me?

174
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,270
- I need you to step back now!
- Wait a minute.

175
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,947
- That's my wife.
- She collapsed.

176
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,120
- There were no precursory signs.
- What's goin' on? Liz!

177
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,038
- That is my wife!
- Her pressure dropped.

178
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,691
- Two milligrams of epi.
- Wait a minute, man. Liz! Wait a... Liz!

179
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,743
Mr. Logelin.

180
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,121
Hey. What's up, doc?
What's... what's goin' on, man?

181
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,082
Your wife had
a pulmonary embolism.

182
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,418
Uh, a blood clot traveled to her lung.

183
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,502
What does that mean?

184
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,837
What's that mea...

185
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,230
Don't tell me my wife is dead.

186
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,318
- Don't tell me my wife is dead.
- What? What? What?

187
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,572
What is it? Is it Maddy? What? Jus... Matt!

188
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:05,456
No! No!

189
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,686
How?

190
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,209
I would trade everything
to spend one more day with you.

191
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,809
Here she is.

192
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,259
He's not ready for a baby.

193
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,219
He hasn't even put the crib together.

194
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,931
Well, you know,
he's always been extremely immature.

195
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,101
Oh, hi, Matt. How are you, dear?

196
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,519
I'm extremely immature.

197
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,025
- Can you give the baby, please?
- I just gave her a bottle.

198
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:56,942
Okay.

199
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,327
You know, Maddy,

200
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,457
if you could have only one parent,
I wish you could've had your mom.

201
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,339
'Cause she would've been better at it.

202
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,637
I think sooner than later.

203
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,435
I don't know.

204
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,562
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

205
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,355
Mmm, mmm, hmm?

206
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,650
I don't know how he gonna do this.

207
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,986
- I know.
- See? Will you tell him that?

208
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,323
Nah.

209
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,461
All right! All right, Maddy!

210
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,840
Okay. You win. You win, Maddy.

211
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,344
Tell me what it is. Are you hungry? Huh?

212
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,179
You want your diaper changed again?

213
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,020
Okay. Wait a second.

214
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,690
Hold on, Maddy.

215
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,234
Okay. Here.

216
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,820
All right. Okay.

217
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:26,115
All right, all right. Huh?
Wait, I didn't get it all.

218
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,743
Oh my G... Shit!

219
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,001
What are you doin' up?

220
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,462
I probably will never sleep again.

221
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,091
What is that on that baby's bottom?

222
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,552
It's a diaper.

223
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,387
It looks like a balloon animal.

224
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,973
- Is it inside out?
- The diaper's on fine.

225
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,058
I just came down to give her a bottle.

226
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,062
Already done. We heard her crying.

227
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,732
- Mm-hmm. Give her some.
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,821
There you go. There you go.

229
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,507
Matthew, darling, we've been talking...

230
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,367
We think
you should move back to Minnesota.

231
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,663
- It's financially prudent.
- It is. You can find a job there.

232
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,666
Your mom and I
can help you raise Maddy.

233
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,544
We'll all be together.
You'll have a church, a support system.

234
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,797
- You're all alone here.
- I'm not alone, okay? My job is here.

235
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,594
There are no good tech jobs at home.
My friends are here.

236
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,262
Your friends are kind of weird.

237
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,307
Okay. That may be true,
but they're my friends, Ma.

238
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,850
Liz is here.

239
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,313
And every place that I look here,
<i>every </i>single place that I look

240
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,522
makes me think of her.

241
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,233
Mom, you always talk
to me about God's plan.

242
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,110
I would love to know what the odds are

243
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,113
of me meetin' somebody from my hometown
halfway across the country.

244
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,281
God?

245
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,866
I had a plan.

246
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,787
Liz was to go away to grad school
and then come back and work and live.

247
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,289
That was the plan before she met you.

248
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:02,044
Now, you want to stay, do that,
but Maddy comes with us.

249
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,922
- Marion, it's...
- It's the best thing for her.

250
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,467
Believe it or not, it's best for you too.
I care about you.

251
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,971
You think you can do this, but you can't.

252
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,933
Raisin' a child, that's a... that's
a nonstop, all-day, all-night affair.

253
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,898
I understand,
and I'll... I'll think about it.

254
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,359
Okay.

255
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,200
I thought about it.

256
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,746
Yeah, I just... I just thought about it.
You're right.

257
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:42,209
No, Marion, you're right. I can't.
I... I can't do it. But you know what?

258
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,169
I'm gonna do it.

259
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,423
Yeah, I'm... I'mma do it.
I'm gonna bring Maddy up.

260
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,427
I'm... I'mma bring Maddy up
because I'm her father.

261
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,804
- And because I love her.
- I know you love her.

262
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,727
Do you know that I love her, Marion,
because I doubt that you really do.

263
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,059
I have no doubt you love that baby.

264
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,729
I have no doubt you loved my Liz.

265
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,233
But you wanna keep Maddy to yourself
because you need a life raft.

266
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,403
I'm sorry I messed up your plan.

267
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,039
You catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

268
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,166
You catch even more with a flyswatter.

269
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,250
Marion!

270
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:29,048
If there's one piece of advice that
I could give you about bringing up a kid...

271
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,386
Let go.

272
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,640
Look, as a parent,
we do all this shit, right?

273
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,643
Trying to make everything perfect.

274
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,938
But we don't have any control.

275
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,399
You just have to accept that fact.

276
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,321
Liz loved you.

277
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,908
And it made me happy to see that.

278
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,703
And I also saw how much you loved her.

279
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,001
Yeah.

280
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,378
You are a, um...

281
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,132
You're a good father.

282
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,845
She was lucky to have you, Mike.

283
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,640
Thanks.

284
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,477
Hmm.

285
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,335
I had an aunt who died this past year.

286
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,418
She was 99.

287
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,132
Wow. That, uh... that must've been a shock.

288
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,215
It was.

289
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,220
Listen, I want you to take as much time...

290
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,138
Okay.

291
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,097
...as you need.

292
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,932
- Thank you.
- Five weeks, six weeks.

293
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,392
I don... Whatever.

294
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,227
I'll probably need about ten,

295
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,646
twenty years.

296
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,357
- Well, yeah...
- That would do it, but I... I need my job.

297
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,361
You know? That's why
I can't, uh... I can't have that time.

298
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,489
Listen, Howard, I was thinking
maybe I could just work from home

299
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,868
and... and come in as you need me. You know?

300
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,287
And when I come in,
I'd have to bring my daughter with me.

301
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,873
- You're taking care of her?
- That's correct.

302
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,208
All right. Good. Great. Okay.

303
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,211
You don't think I can do it.

304
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,005
It's not that I don't think you can do it...

305
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,215
- Because I'm a man?
- No.

306
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,339
See, what is it
that a woman has that a man doesn't?

307
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,888
Patience. Emotional vulnerability.

308
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,556
Uh...

309
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,515
Breasts.

310
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,725
Some men have breasts.

311
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,769
I'm gonna let that go
'cause you're grieving.

312
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,938
Listen, I love babies.

313
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,274
You know, I have three of them myself.

314
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,944
They're not babies anymore in the picture,
but when they started, they were babies.

315
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,197
And I'm tellin' ya, it's brutal.

316
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,240
It'll wipe you out.

317
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,617
She have solid poops yet?

318
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,743
No. Nope.

319
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,412
I'm, uh... I'm dealing with
the creamy shit right now.

320
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,789
Enjoy the creamy shit. It's a big jump.

321
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,417
When you get to solid poops,
it's not a picnic.

322
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:11,835
Okay.

323
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,963
Save that. Put it in the...
with your roses and your flowers

324
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,299
'cause it's packed with nutrients,
that stuff.

325
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,719
- That's... It's... it's a great tip.
- Yeah.

326
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,864
The London account,
I know it's comin' up in five weeks.

327
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,265
I just wanna tell you, I'm on it.

328
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:29,478
You know, I'm more than capable
of doin' the job that needs to be done.

329
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,064
You know, but if you feel
like I'm... I'm not or I can't be,

330
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,427
maybe you could put Oscar on it.

331
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,192
- Jesus Christ. Oscar?
- And see... Yeah.

332
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,362
No, no, no, no. Nah, no, no. Forget Oscar.

333
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,613
- Did you ask him?
- Um...

334
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,199
Did you ask him,
"Do you want Oscar to handle the clients?"

335
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,010
- Yeah. I did.
- Remember? Like we rehearsed?

336
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,869
I said it, Oscar. It worked.

337
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,497
- I told you it would. That's great news.
- Yeah. Yeah. D...

338
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,754
It's kind of cruel
to send flowers to someone who's grieving.

339
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:00,634
'Cause, you know, flowers die,
and then you gotta throw them out.

340
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,719
It's just such a bummer.

341
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:07,432
You know, I've never seen,
like, a... like, a person pass or anything.

342
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,935
But, um, you know,
I've seen a squirrel pass.

343
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,778
It makes you wonder
about the circle of life.

344
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,855
But it's not really a circle.
It's like a line.

345
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,608
- 'Cause there's a beginning and an end.
- Hey, Oscar.

346
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,903
Can you stop talking?

347
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,281
Man, you sound just like my wife.

348
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,162
You're gonna swaddle Maddy, aren't you?

349
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,789
Did you swaddle Liz?

350
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,872
I sure did.

351
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,918
Then, yeah, I mean, I'mma do
whatever Liz would've wanted me to do.

352
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,630
But this... this looks insane.

353
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,300
I mean, that's...
that's tight there, Marion.

354
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,444
What, do you think
she's gonna run away or somethin'?

355
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,762
- Hmm.
- What up?

356
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,055
How you doin'?

357
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,057
These are Flamin' Hots.

358
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,394
Anybody want some? Grandmas?
Want me to give one to the baby? Mmm.

359
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,980
Y'all lookin' good, ladies.
Can I say that to you?

360
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,440
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

361
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,066
- No problem. You know...
- Stop it.

362
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,279
- Your pajama-robe thingy...
- Jordan. Stop it.

363
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,196
What am I doin'?

364
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,300
- You're flirtin' with my mother.
- I'm not flirtin'.

365
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,844
I'm looking at you flirt with my mama.

366
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:10,912
I'm flirtin' with both your mamas.
Hey, Marion, how you doin'? Looking good.

367
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,956
- Jordan.
- Kind of a blouse-sweater, huh?

368
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,625
Jordan, stop it.

369
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,771
- I can't help your mom is a GILF.
- That's it.

370
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,064
- Yeah, I said it.
- Stop.

371
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,674
Look, man, I got a... a present for you.
Can I give you a present?

372
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,260
Wait right here. I'll be right back.
I got somethin' for you.

373
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,596
We've been makin' a list. We need onesies.

374
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,600
And you need a lock. A toilet lock.
You know, they can drown in the toilet.

375
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,683
Look,

376
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,229
I've been meaning to ask, wh...
How long... how long are you stayin'?

377
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,083
- I wish I didn't have to go back...
- I'm not talking to you, Mom.

378
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:43,236
We've discussed that. But, Marion,
I wasn't a hundred percent sure about you.

379
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,949
Well, since you refuse to move back
to Minnesota, I'll stay six months.

380
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,244
Six months?

381
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,663
- Yes.
- What about Mike?

382
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,874
Oh, I don't care
about Mike right now.

383
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:56,958
Hey, Matt.

384
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,338
Hey, uh, Mike. How you doin', man?

385
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,964
- Doin' well, man.
- Okay.

386
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,218
I want us to be honest for a second.

387
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,928
Okay, let's be honest.

388
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,265
The first thing I want to say
is that I love havin' you here.

389
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,349
I know you do.

390
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,893
No, I... I love it.

391
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:18,647
But what worries me is
that if you're here...

392
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,067
you know, if you're... if you're here
for an extended period of time,

393
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,444
we're gonna end up
gettin' on each other's nerves.

394
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,612
In just six months?

395
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,782
That's why I was thinking
maybe you could leave when my mom leaves.

396
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:32,828
What would I look like goin' home
before I know that you are capable

397
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,996
of taking care of my newborn grandchild?

398
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,707
How are you ever gonna know
if you don't let me do it?

399
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,001
That is a great damn point.

400
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,588
Huh? Forty-love.

401
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,758
Forty-love, Matt. Here you go, brother.
Look what I got for you, huh?

402
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,842
What is that, Jordan?

403
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,553
- I got you a pet.
- That's a goldfish.

404
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,557
And let me tell you somethin',
kids with pets are really happy.

405
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,059
Also, they don't get any allergies.
Did you know that?

406
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,978
That's cats and dogs.

407
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,233
- Damn it, you read the same article.
- Okay. Jordan, this is... this is...

408
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,527
All right,
I'm bullshitting you, man.

409
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,112
I'm sorry. Excuse my French.

410
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,549
I hate this fish.
You remember Tanya? She gave me this fish.

411
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,326
Tanya broke up with me
and left this dirty-ass fish in my house.

412
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,995
Can you take me to the baby store?

413
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,539
- Hell yeah!
- Thank you.

414
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,417
Team Single Father! I'm here
to help you at the end of the day.

415
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,962
Thank you.
Okay, Marion. How about we do this?

416
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,882
How about... how about,
when you go back, right,

417
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,051
I promise to give you updates,
let you know how Maddy's doin'?

418
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,846
Uh, I'll post pictures
on my Instagram all the time.

419
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:33,847
All right.

420
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,725
I will go home when Anna goes.

421
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:41,396
But if you are not handling
everything all very well,

422
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,690
you move your butt back to Minnesota.

423
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,235
- Why would I agree to that?
- Because it's not about you.

424
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,198
- Deal.
- Brother, real quick.

425
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,993
- You good on the fish?
- I don't want the fish, man.

426
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,512
- How you doin'?
- Good. You?

427
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,330
I'm doin' fine. Here you go.

428
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,457
- These are great.
- Oh, well...

429
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,753
You better stop smilin' at me like that.
Here you go.

430
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,590
I don't have no kids.
This is for my friend.

431
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,510
This for his baby. You know,
man, he's buyin' all this stuff.

432
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,012
He's paying for everything.

433
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,014
Oh, here we go.

434
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,935
This is, uh... this is
your diaper rash ointment for you.

435
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,104
This one's Maddy's.
Just do... do his separate.

436
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,106
Here. Just put yours over there

437
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,776
so she knows that you
have to pay for the stuff that you got

438
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,611
for your problem by yourself.

439
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,574
And this one's the one
I'm paying for for Maddy.

440
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,865
- That's yours. This is Maddy's.
- Okay.

441
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,659
He says situa... I mean...

442
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,079
- Bumps.
- Bumps. But it's... it's shavin' bumps.

443
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,802
- On your butt.
- Not on my butt.

444
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,042
- I have shavin' bumps from shavin' and...
- On your...

445
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,294
And I saw a video

446
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:50,090
that people use diaper rash ointment
to keep their skin clear

447
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,693
from gaining shavin' bumps.
That's why I got such a smooth neck.

448
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,094
- Look how...
- You look great...

449
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,011
- I look great?
- Yeah.

450
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,972
See, look at that.
Yeah, she said I look great.

451
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,265
Ask to see his butt.

452
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:03,812
"Now insert
the eighth 44-millimeter screw."

453
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,986
I don't see it. I don't see
the eighth 4... 44-millimeter screw.

454
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:11,945
I don't see it.

455
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:16,116
You're not even looking for real.
Look... look next to your shoe. Look.

456
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,660
Okay.

457
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,204
Why do you keep acting like you dumb, huh?

458
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,248
Because I didn't see it,
I'm acting like I'm dumb?

459
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,250
You acting like
a dumb mother-fudger right now.

460
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,437
- Don't cuss at me in front of my child.
- I didn't. I called you a mother-fudger.

461
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,588
Why are you sayin' "fudge"?

462
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,911
There's a baby.
I don't wanna curse in front of the baby.

463
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,633
So why not just choose another word?

464
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,718
I did. "Fudge."

465
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,096
Man. You know, your daddy is a witch.

466
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,016
Yeah, I said it. He's a dumbass witch.

467
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,394
Goofy mother-fudger.

468
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,275
See, it's not...

469
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,570
Just reach under and flip the switch.

470
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,447
I did reach under. It's broken.

471
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,073
You've always been so impatient.

472
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,367
Stop. This ain't got nothin'
to do with patience!

473
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,078
I'm telling you I'm trying to do it,
and you just... I can't!

474
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,622
I can't, Mom!

475
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,372
Shit.

476
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,709
I can't do none of it.

477
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,503
I can't do it.

478
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,006
Not without Liz.

479
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:17,260
You just have to do what's best for her.

480
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,096
That's all you have to do
the rest of your life.

481
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,557
And I believe you can do that.

482
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,276
Right here.

483
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,362
Show-off.

484
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,697
I'm gonna be praying
for you ten times a day.

485
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,203
Listen, if it's nine,
don't kill yourself, okay?

486
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,788
Love you, Mom.

487
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,082
- That's real lucky.
- "Goodbye, Nana."

488
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,542
- Come, come, come.
- You got her?

489
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,378
We have a deal now.

490
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,841
If it's in her best interest,
you're moving back. Okay?

491
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,967
No being selfish.

492
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,551
Agreed.

493
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,727
- Love you!
- Good luck.

494
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,647
I love you, Maddy.
Grammy loves you.

495

the school that Mom wanted you to go to.

00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,884
Which means
that that's where you gonna go.

00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,845
They got nuns there, and you'll like nuns.

553
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,932
You'll like nuns 'cause nuns
dress like penguins. That's a fact.

554
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,100
And they're celibate.

No.

589
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,217
Excuse me.

590
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,262
Um, I'm sorry.
AA is down the hall to the right.

591
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,388
I'm not here for that.

592
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,033
I'm not... I'm not here for the AA meeting.
That's not why I'm here.

593
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:43,396
She, uh... she just went to sleep,
but she's been, like, crying for hours.

594
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,691
I mean <i>hours</i> to the point
where I'm... I'm exhausted.

595
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,651
And my face hurts,
and I'm getting frustrated.

596
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,903
And I don't know
how to break the stroller down.

597
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,072
I don't know how to fold it up.

598
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,784
Okay. Well, sorry,
but this is a group for new mothers.

599
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,038
You're lying, because
on that sign out there, it says "parents."

600
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,290
I'm a parent,
and I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

601
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,792
I don't have nobody else
to talk to about this shit.

602
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,962
Speaking of shit, the girl's
got some stuff flyin' out of her ass.

603
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,130
It's like a fire hose.

604
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,773
I don't know if it's normal or not,
but it's two different kinds.

605
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,359
She can either hit you with a streamer.

606
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,804
That's when it's all put together,
and it's... it's a little solid.

607
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,306
And it's... it's a direct hit.

608
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,849
Or she'll buckshot you.

609
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:23,227
And that's... that's that spray.
It's... it's a quick... whop!

610
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:27,690
I need help. I need the crying to stop.

611
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,026
How do I make the crying stop?

612
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,406
Okay, um, my oldest had colic
for the first couple of months.

613
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,910
- What's colic?
- It's when babies cry for hours on end

614
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,788
without any reason until you feel
like your eyes are about to pop out.

615
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,624
I gave the baby colic.

616
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,834
No, that's... that's not how colic works.

617
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,558
I'm not washing my hands,
and I'm touching the baby.

618
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,067
And that's how I gave the baby colic.

619
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,926
You don't give a baby colic.
It's more of a digestive thing.

620
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,512
That's a relief.

621
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,223
Thing that worked for me
was white noise, surprisingly.

622
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,349
White noise?

623
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,642
White noise.

624
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,628
And then looking ahead,
I'm gonna turn it over to Matt.

625
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,923
And he's gonna show you
how this all can work for your customers.

626
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,633
All right, Matt, you're up.

627
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,430
- Matt.
- Matt!

628
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,807
I'm not sleep.

629
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,183
Sleep.

630
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,686
Nah, this guy never sleeps.
He's deep in thought.

631
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,689
Yeah, deep in... That's exactly what it is.

632
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,274
Very deep in thought.

633
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,109
Thank you. Thank you, Howard.

634
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,779
And the reason why
is because I'm so excited...

635
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,503
- Yeah.
- ...uh, about this.

636
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,033
With this upgrade, there's thousands,

637
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,495
and I mean thousands
of preset visuals from flooring

638
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:08,958
to, uh... to walls
to lighting that really offers...

639
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,459
You hear cryin'?

640
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,714
Crying? I don't hear
any crying.

641
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,424
I have a deviated septum,

642
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,509
so my nose whistles sometimes.
Maybe that's it?

643
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:22,680
No, that's... that's not what it is.
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a second, please.

644
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,182
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Where...

645
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,683
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

646
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,396
Here we go. Here we go.

647
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,690
- Huh? Huh?
- Okay. Vacuum, yeah.

648
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,150
Come on. Shh.

649
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,944
We're gonna vacuum. We're gonna vacuum.

650
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,904
Hey, Maddy!

651
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,780
- Hey, hey. Whoa.
- This vacuum sucks.

652
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,532
- What's going on?
- Come on, Maddy.

653
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,618
What's going on now? What are you doing?

654
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,786
- What's going on?
- He's doing the vacuum thing.

655
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,806
- Here, let me take her.
- The vacuum thing?

656
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,582
- Okay.
- She likes the vacuum noise.

657
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,958
Hey! Hi.

658
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,335
Uh, Matt's got a baby.

659
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,504
Hey, I apologize
for storming out like that.

660
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,964
But she goes on these crying jags,

661
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,301
and it's impossible
to really get her to stop and calm down.

662
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,262
- Does she wanna try sucking on my pinkie?
- No.

663
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,157
- I used to help with my kids.
- No. Howard, no.

664
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,742
- They loved to suck on the pinkie.
- Not sanitary.

665
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,061
Maybe this will help, mate.
It's, um... it's a white noise app.

666
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,730
- It helps me sleep.
- Thank you.

667
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:16,192
My baby always calmed down
with skin-to-skin contact.

668
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,737
She's 25 now.

669
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,657
And I want you to notice
the easy map-tree interface as well.

670
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,201
Once again, it's about giving
our customers what they want,

671
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,285
which is the simplicity.

672
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,663
Right? Isn't that what you want, huh?

673
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,164
- They want simplicity.
- Okay.

674
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,001
I got a problem now.
This is a place of business, right?

675
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,380
It's not a place of babies.
In here, I'm kinda...

676
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,465
I'm the designated asshole.

677
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,591
Who designated you?

678
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,262
- I'm just asking. Was it from birth or...
- Hey.

679
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,806
You don't think
there's an asshole above me?

680
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,725
And above that asshole, another asshole.

681
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,185
An asshole chain.

682
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,189
It's an asshole chain.
That's exactly what it is.

683
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,231
So... Yeah?

684
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,110
Just wanted to say,
great presentation, Matt.

685
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,196
Definitely memorable.
We'll be talking this week.

686
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,990
Thank you. Thank you for that.

687
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,075
It means a lot
since I'm about to get fired.

688
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,743
- Thank you for...
- No.

689
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,867
We'll be in touch. Thank you, Fionna.

690
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,081
See ya.

691
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,581
Go on. Finish.

692
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,502
Hey, you're not that lucky.
I'm not firing you.

693
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:20,339
I just happen to be worried about you.
When's the last time you had a break?

694
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,842
You know,
there's a new thing called babysitters.

695
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,802
- Oh, hi, Maddy.
- Yeah.

696
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,723
My name is Summer.
I'm going to pick you up now.

697
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,184
Oh, she doesn't speak English yet.
She's just a baby.

698
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,021
Oh, I believe you have
to treat the infant with respect.

699
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,274
Right, Maddy? We've got this.

700
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,785
Yeah, yeah.

701
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,869
That's it.

702
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,209
All daddies deserve
some time off. Have some fun.

703
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,128
You got a babysitter. Have a good time.

704
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,630
You need this, bro.
You a single parent now.

705
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,383
Which is crazy to me to say this.
"Matt is a dad."

706
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,927
To say that out loud still sound...
"Matt is a dad."

707
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,721
That is crazy. So insane.

708
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,639
- That's crazy. Hey.
- What are you doin'?

709
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,224
Nothin'. I'm just listening to you.

710
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,643
Are you serious right now?

711
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,605
- What?
- What do you mean? What was that?

712
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,149
You don't see the diversity
just walked past? Huh?

713
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,151
- All the flavors. For all of us.
- Okay.

714
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,195
I gotta get going, man. I'm going home.

715
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,906
- Matt.
- Excuse me.

716
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,949
- Excuse me.
- Matt! Matt! Matt! Hey, hey, Matt!

717
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,993
- What, man?
- What's up? Where you goin'?

718
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,677
What do you mean, where I'm goin'? Home!

719
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,015
- Why are you leavin'?
- Because I'm not havin' a good time.

720
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,679
What? We got girls back there.
We're taking shots, having a good...

721
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,712
I don't care about no girls, man. What
makes you think I care about girls now?

722
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,506
Man, I brought you out
to have a good time.

723
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:47,051
I don't want your version
of a good time, Jordan.

724
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,134
I don't want it.

725
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,238
Okay, look. I get it.
You haven't been out since Liz.

726
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,972
- But it's...
- Shut the... Hey, man.

727
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,516
Don't.

728
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,645
Don't do that. Don't bring Liz up.

729
00:39:58,854 --> 00:39:59,854
Don't do that.

730
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,776
Idiot.

731
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,446
- Say bye.
- Bye.

732
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,531
Goodbye.

733
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:12,201
We're never gonna see her again, are we?

734
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:15,454
All we need is us.
We don't need no one else.

735
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,643
Here come Javier.

736
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:41,272
That's daddy's new best friend.
He brings us our formula, our diapers.

737
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,859
He gives us everything we need
so we don't have to talk to people again.

738
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,862
If anybody else ring this bell,
they die. You hear me?

739
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,031
I say, if anybody
ring Daddy bell, they gonna die.

740
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,164
I said, "No ringin'."

741
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,167
I said, "No ringin' the damn bell."

742
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,669
I'm gonna kill somebody.

743
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,466
Good morning.

744
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,425
- Hi.
- Hey.

745
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,676
Where is my grandbaby?

746
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,760
What are you...

747
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,928
Is she dressed?

748
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,307
- What are you doing here, Marion?
- Well, it's Maddy's pediatrician visit.

749
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,310
Oh, shit! Is it Thursday already? Shit!

750
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,606
Yeah, you didn't forget
the pediatrician's visit, did you?

751
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,066
I didn't forget anything.
You just caught me.

752
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,319
We was about to leave.
She just got out of the tub.

753
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,945
You left her in the tub?

754
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,113
Good.

755
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,865
Yeah.

756
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,201
How's she been eating?

757
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,619
Uh...

758
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,788
I mean, okay, I guess, you know?

759
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:40,872
She, um...

760
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,891
For the most part, I... I think it's fine.

761
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,878
Every once in a while, if she's sleeping,

762
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,339
I may let her go,
like, an extra hour or something.

763
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,591
And how about you? How are you doing?

764
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,302
It's not... it's not really about me.

765
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,096
- It's about...
- How is Maddy? Is she okay?

766
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,724
Look, I know I ain't perfect.

767
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,894
I know that. I'm... I'm actually nothin'.

768
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,023
- I'm a joke, okay? Lis...
- Matt, you're not a joke.

769
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,233
Maddy is doing great.

770
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,902
She's moved up
to the 60th percentile in weight

771
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,612
and 70th in height.

772
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,864
You can start feeding her
when she's hungry.

773
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,784
Look, I hope
you don't mind me saying this,

774
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,245
but your wife would be very proud of you.

775
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,513
It's okay, Marion.

776
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,140
It's all right.

777
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,211
You hungry? You wanna go get lunch?

778
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:49,275
Uh, no, no. Actually, um,
I gotta get back to the airport.

779
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,235
- Already?
- Yeah, yeah.

780
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,572
I told Mike
that I was spending the day at the spa.

781
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,155
You told...

782
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,922
Want me to take you?
I can give you a ride.

783
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,912
No, she needs to get to her little nap.

784
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,163
You want a little nap?

785
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,790
Oh God. Matthew,

786
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:09,044
today was a good day for you as a parent.

787
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,631
You keep all these little victories
like you had today

788
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,883
in a little box inside you.

789
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,137
They'll be your most prized possessions.

790
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,348
And don't let me
have to come back up here

791
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:26,979
<i>before</i> Father Mayfield
is going to christen her in Minnesota.

792
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,398
Saint Augustine's, three weeks.
I'll see you there.

793
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,608
Wait, what do you...

794
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,192
Minnesota, three weeks. See you.

795
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,236
- Minnesota in three...
- Grammy loves you, Maddy.

796
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,281
Nobody... nobody said nothing
to me about Minnesota.

797
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,203
Who finished up
their whole bottle? You did.

798
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,372
Yes, you did. You were hungry.

799
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,540
Huh?

800
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,625
"I'm hungry, Daddy."

801
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,960
It's her first flight.

802
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,338
I never would have guessed.

803
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,048
- She's a cutie.
- Yeah...

804
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:57,885
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

805
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,345
I'm so sorry.

806
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,180
- Hey!
- Yeah!

807
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,308
- Hey!
- Oh boy!  Maddy!

808
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,978
- What a bundle of joy!
- Hey!

809
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,313
Hi, sweetheart!

810
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:12,566
- Got it? Okay.
- Good? Good? Come on now.

811
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,824
Anna, come on,
let's get something cold to drink.

812
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:21,909
Okay.

813
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:48,185
Remember when I caught
you guys messin' around in here?

814
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,687
Oh my goodness.

815
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,771
Yes, I do.

816
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,857
You chased me with Mike's hockey stick.

817
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:58,445
You kept... you kept yellin' out,
"Not in this house. Not in this house!"

818
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,281
You thought
you were gonna get lucky that night.

819
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,367
You got damn lucky, didn't you?

820
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,286
It's amazing
what you can do when you're scared.

821
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,788
I've never been that fast.

822
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,248
The room looks different.

823
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:14,628
Oh, I brought a lot of things
down from the attic, from her childhood.

824
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,589
I like it. I like it a lot.

825
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,176
At first, I spent whole days in here.

826
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,346
Whole days.

827
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,973
Just lyin' on the bed,

828
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,684
smelling the pillows.

829
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,353
Cryin'. Pissed.

830
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:35,816
I'm down to one hour each day.
That's all I allow myself now.

831
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:42,781
I'd like for you to let
Maddy come and stay with us sometimes.

832
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:44,742
When she's bigger.

833
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,244
She could spend summers here.

834
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,203
Summers?

835
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,998
Matt, she needs family.

836
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,377
She'll need a woman in her life.

837
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,382
And I don't mean some woman
you met in the club.

838
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,259
Or on Tinders.

839
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,763
Tinders?

840
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,392
I'm not on Tinder. And what are you...

841
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:14,271
How do you know about Tinder?
Where are you gettin' this stuff?

842
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,027
Hey, I'm...

843
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,783
You think maybe
you can watch Maddy for me tonight?

844
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,659
Yeah! Yes!

845
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,205
So I can go meet up with some friends,
go have a drink.

846
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,041
- Yeah, you do that. Yeah!
- All right. Okay.

Mom?

853
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,696
Did Dad like having a baby?

854
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,115
Oh, he loved babies.

855
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,118
That's why he had so many of them
with so many different women.

856
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,247
Yeah, but he married you.

857
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,123
Yes, lucky me.

858
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,085
I was lucky 'cause I had you.

859
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,215
I'm just hopin' I can be

00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,552
You're a good mom.

861
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,139
Maddy, guess what?

862
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:32,765
See the baby?

863
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,479
Isn't she beautiful? Sister...

864
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,647

Wake up, Daddy! It's a school day!

871
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,152
- Wake up!
- I'm up.

872
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,612
You gotta treat it like a...

873
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,032
like you're sneaking up on it and grab it.

874
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:34,745
Over, under, over.

875
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,038
Okay.

876
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,000
Okay, that's one. Just let me...

877
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,086
What is this?

878
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,300
I think it's a new... a new... a new look.

879
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,678
I think it's a new hairstyle
that can catch on if given a chance.

880
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,472
Just stay still.

881
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,599
We gotta go top. Let me...

882
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,937
Hold on, okay?

883
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,740
All the girls are wearing skirts,

884
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:15,327
but skirts make me feel
like I forgot my pants.

885
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,371
But she said it's a rule.

886
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,791
Rules? We don't need no stinkin' rules.

887
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:26,505
- Maddy, do you like goin' to school here?
- Mommy wanted me to be here. I like it.

888
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,299
That's all I needed to hear then.

889
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,385
All right, go ahead. I love you.

890
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,469
Love you too.

891
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,055
Two kisses.
Forehead, forehead. I got you.

892
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,223
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

893
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,812
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

894
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,523
Mr. Logelin,
we need to discuss the dress code.

895
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,191
Hey, you have a good day, okay?

896
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:48,026
There's a dress code here!

897
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,700
Maddy, it's on you.
You wanna check or bet?

898
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:55,826
All in.

899
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,744
All in again?

900
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,828
- Wow!
- All in again?

901
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,957
- I'm gonna go ahead and fold, chief.
- You gonna fold like a chump.

902
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,127
- She looks serious.
- I don't know if she's bluffin' or not.

903
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,254
- Seriously.
- Let me see your face.

904
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,299
That's a poker face right there.
That's a poker face.

905
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,943
How can you break that down? You can't.

906
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,848
I don't know what you got
going on in that head.

907
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:19,307
I can see into the mind of Maddy. Hold on.

908
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,606
I got nothin', guys. I'm out. I fold.

909
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,484
I'm goin' all in. You kiddin' me?

910
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,653
Look at this. Bam. Queens.

911
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,238
- What do you have?
- What do you got?

912
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,825
- Aces.
- What? What?

913
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,869
- No!
- Pocket rockets.

914
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,672
- Pocket aces.
- Okay. That was a good hand.

915
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,165
- She got pocket rockets!
- It's all yours. Take it.

916
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,876
- Scoop it. It's yours.
- What? Okay, that's all you.

917
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,645
- This is all mine.
- Okay. Go ahead.

918
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,421
You're not gonna eat
all that today either.

919
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,505
Ship it!

920
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,132
There you go.

921
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,222
Did you... did you eat your veggies?
What is that, cake?

922
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,565
Oh yeah!

923
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,735
They're having so much fun.
Makes you wish you had a kid to bring.

924
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,613
Oh, I do. Crazy one's mine. That's Maddy.

925
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,907
Hi, Daddy!

926
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,368
- Hey!
- Cannonball!

927
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,412
Are you Matt?

928
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,246
I am Matt.

929
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,669
I think I know why
Oscar and Rose insisted I come today.

930
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,963
- I think we're being set up.
- Oh, wow.

931
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:35,050
I told 'em to stop trying.

932
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,677
- Funny thing is I said the same thing.
- Yeah?

933
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,740
We should mess with 'em. Throw your drink
in my face, make it look real bad.

934
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,642
Or we could break up with them as friends.

935
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,394
You know what?
I've been looking for new white people.

936
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,481
I have. I really have.

937
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,067
There's plenty here. So...

938
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,151
What do you do?

939
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,277
Uh, I'm an animator.

940
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,905
An animator?
That's cool. That's different.

941
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,783
I, uh... I work with this guy.

942
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:00,866
I work with Oscar.

943
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,495
- Hey.
- That's my name.

944
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,289
Don't wear it out. Just kidding.
You can say it as much as you want.

945
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,253
So, you two meeting
at, uh, Oliver's birthday party.

946
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,336
Yeah.

947
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,238
- Pretty great.
- What are the odds?

948
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,715
What are the odds, you know?

949
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,844
I mean, you know,
you're great, and you're great and...

950
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,470
It's just, uh...

951
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:24,057
- It's not a setup though. You know?
- Got it. Got it.

952
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,892
- Very smooth, by the way, Oscar.
- Yeah.

953
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:27,811
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

954
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:28,894
Great.

955
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,231
Thank you.

956
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,232
Hi, Rose.

957
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,315
Hi, Rose.

958
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,692
Unreal.

959
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,945
My name's Liz.

960
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,072
Stop playin'.

961
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:44,327
Um, I'm not playing. My name is...
Well, Lizzie is what my friends call me.

962
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,583
You're an animator.

963
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:53,503
- What have you animated?
- I work on a show called <i>Lucky Jim</i>.

964
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,923
<i>Lucky Jim</i>. I know what that is.
Maddy loves that show.

965
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,759
You let her watch <i>Lucky Jim</i>?

966
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:01,887
Yeah, it's a cartoon.

967
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,014
Have you ever watched it?

968
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,474
It's called <i>Lucky Jim</i>
because he gets lucky.

969
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,061
- You talkin' about sex?
- Uh-huh.

970
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,900
- I thought he was, like, a leprechaun.
- Yeah, he's a leprechaun.

971
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:19,321
A really lucky, really horny leprechaun.

972
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,700
Is there, like, a warning on it
that kids shouldn't watch it?

973
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,493
There's definitely a warning.

974
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,559
Y <i>ou know where the pot of gold is?</i>

975
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,061
Begorra,
<i>the pot of gold is right over there.</i>

976
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:36,213
<i>And now that rainbow's up and disappeared.</i>

977
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,173
<i>I think you're full of horse blarney.</i>

978
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:41,136
<i>I'd like to show you what I'm full of,
me lassie, if you've no objection.</i>

979
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:46,389
<i>I've no objection
to plucking the clover out of you.</i>

980
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,515
<i>I'm seeing stars.</i>

981
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,018
<i>You'll be seeing
more than stars in a moment.</i>

982
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,518
That's it.

983
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,099
- Oh, that's off.
- Daddy, they were about to wrestle.

984
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:57,651
I know that.
I know that. And that's a little...

985
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,945
It's a little too violent
for you to watch, honey.

986
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,113
- Wait, did you call her?
- Zip it.

987
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,991
- What do you mean, "Zip it"?
- Zip it. Don't be a bonehead.

988
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,053
- Why I gotta be a bonehead?
- Don't be a bonehead.

989
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,477
- Maddy can handle it, right?
- Stop. What'd I ask you to do?

990
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:10,580
Handle what?

991
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,374
- Jordan, what'd I say?
- Look, I got this.

992
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,684
- Jordan, I don't...
- I got this.

993
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,669
- Jordan...
- That's what friends are for.

994
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,921
Sometimes two adults
meet each other, right?

995
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,631
And they fall in love.

996
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,675
And then they both are nearsighted.

997
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,303
Have that in common
and all these beautiful things.

998
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,555
They take long walks in the park together.

999
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,641
You know, you find that special someone.

1000
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:34,604
But then they get real petty one day
and kick you in your back

1001
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,856
'cause you snoring while you sleep.

1002
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,566
- What?
- You're sleeping on the floor.

1003
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,859
- You're all messed up.
- What?

1004
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,672
- Carpet burns on your arm.
- That's... What are you... That's enough!

1005
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,215
- It's not enough, okay?
- It is enough.

1006
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,616
You don't know
if you're gonna find a special someone.

1007
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,702
You're not talking about nobody
but yourself...

1008
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,465
You know he's talking
about himself, right?

1009
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:54,874
I know. But if they liked each other,
and then they didn't like each other,

1010
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,878
couldn't they like each other again?
And wouldn't that be fun?

1011
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,965
- Yeah, Maddy.
- Wow.

1012
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,051
Give me a high five
or something, a hug. Come here.

1013
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,137
- I mean...
- You are brilliant. You a genius.

1014
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,389
Gotta be to make sense
of all that stuff you just said.

1015
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,475
Don't be a hater.
I wanna... Look, you are so smart.

1016
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,394
You definitely don't get that
from your daddy.

1017
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,148
How come you wear boys' pants?

1018
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,191
Okay, stay together. No running.

1019
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,277
Hey, Maddy, are you a boy?

1020
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,445
Are you a girl?

1021
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,696
Zip it, bonehead!

1022
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:25,780
Madeline!

1023
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:30,410
I really don't understand this.
The kid was teasin' her.

1024
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,370
Maybe you should talk
to that kid's parents.

1025
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,288
I have.

1026
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:37,250
But he was teasing her because
she was the only girl wearing pants.

1027
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:41,338
What if a boy wanted to come
to school dressed in a skirt?

1028
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:45,175
Then that's that boy's business.
It's the 21st century.

1029
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:49,846
Mr. Logelin, Madeline is in kindergarten.
She doesn't have a mother to model after.

1030
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:54,351
I am well aware
of what my daughter doesn't have.

1031
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:59,731
You have to at least show her
that wearing girls' clothing is an option.

1032
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:03,526
I just don't... I just don't understand
why nuns are so tough.

1033
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:08,323
Why are you guys so tough? Like, what...
what is it that happens in nun camp

1034
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,116
that makes you guys this strict?

1035
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,914
I'm not gonna say anything else because
I don't wanna get struck by lightning.

1036
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:18,708
Okay, here you go, Maddy.
What about these here?

1037
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,003
No. I want these.

1038
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,172
- You want those?
- Yeah.

1039
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,548
Um...

1040
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,677
Okay, if that's what you want.

1041
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:31,846
Are you going out?

1042
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:36,684
Yes. Rose is coming over,
and Daddy's gonna go out.

1043
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,312
With Oscar?

1044
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,106
No, not with Oscar.

1045
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,441
With Jordan?

1046
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,984
No, not with Jordan.

1047
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,652
A lady?

1048
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,030
Yes, it's a lady.

1049
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:50,907
Does that bother you?

1050
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,159
- Does it bother you?
- I asked first.

1051
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,037
Is it Sister Kathleen from school?

1052
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:59,165
No, it is not Sister Kathleen from school.

1053
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,959
Then that's okay. Who is it?

1054
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,836
It's a lady friend
from the birthday party.

1055
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:08,967
You know what?

1056
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,177
I got a surprise for you.

1057
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:15,432
See, I was gonna wait till you got older.
This was Mommy's jewelry box.

1058
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:19,477
I want you to pick something out
of here that can be just for you.

1059
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:22,272
- Anything?
- Anything you want.

1060
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,731
Hmm.

1061
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,817
This one.

1062
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,321
Wow.

1063
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,450
I like this one.

1064
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,834
Such a good choice.

1065
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,880
Such a good choice.

1066
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,884
Hmm, let me put it on you.

1067
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,183
Is she in this? Mommy?

1068
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:04,105
Yeah, she's in there.
She's in you. She's in me. She's in...

1069
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,775
She's in whoever she touched.

1070
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,611
So...

1071
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,030
And what did she say to that?

1072
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:15,533
Oh, she said
that her mom is in her because of DNA.

1073
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,578
- What?
- Yeah, that's... I swear to God.

1074
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,205
What? Is she some kind of genius?

1075
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,832
You know what it is?
Maddy just asks a lot of questions.

1076
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,168
- Mmm.
- I took her to this mummy show.

1077
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:30,131
They were talking about DNA at the show,
so I tried to explain to her what DNA was.

1078
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,175
And in doing that, she just...

1079
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:33,927
What?

1080
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:38,097
Um, I guess
I'm kind of surprised you're still single.

1081
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,350
All those hot single moms
at the kiddie park.

1082
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,809
Stop it. Stop.

1083
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,604
There's nothing hot about single parents.

1084
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:48,816
We are overworked,
sleep-deprived, covered in baby vomit.

1085
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,193
- That's hot.
- That's hot?

1086
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,237
- It's hot.
- All that is hot?

1087
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,281
- You're funny. You're very funny.
- You've just been through a lot.

1088
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,283
You and Maddy.

1089
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,785
We have been through a lot.

1090
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,829
But we're okay, you know? We, uh...

1091
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,544
We're on our own, and we're... we're fine.

1092
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,170
I get that, you know?

1093
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:12,715
I'm on my own, and I'm fine too.
I like where I'm at.

1094
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,384
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

1095
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:18,638
So, you, um... you must have had
a good example of how to be a dad?

1096
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,057
No. No, I did not.

1097
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,893
Actually, I had
the complete opposite of that.

1098
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,729
I know what not to do because of my dad.

1099
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,277
I'm gonna kiss you now, okay?

1100
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,778
Okay.

1101
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,781
I think I'm prepared.

1102
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:41,119
Oh, do you prefer
my false teeth in or out?

1103
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:45,331
Leave 'em in, just in case I mess up,
so I got something to blame it on.

1104
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,416
Sure.

1105
00:59:57,176 --> 01:00:01,347
Does it... bother you
that my name is Lizzie?

1106
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:04,641
No.

1107
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,395
But you can change it if you want to.

1108
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:11,357
Okay. You know,
if you wanna call me anything like,

1109
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,735
"Your Highness,"

1110
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,529
or like, my mom was gonna name me Majesty.

1111
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,948
Anything along those lines is great.

1112
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,867
Okay. Noted.

1113
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,410
- Mm-hmm.
- What about Hank?

1114
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,415
What about Hank?

1115
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:28,333
Why?

1116
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,501
- You said anything I want.
- Okay.

1117
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,503
- Okay?
- Okay, we'll... we'll test it out.

1118
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:35,715
- Okay. Let's test it out right now.
- Is that a deal? Okay. We'll test it out.

1119
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,259
Go. Go get in the...
go get in the house safe, Hank.

1120
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,637
Oh my God.

1121
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,157
- Thanks for the good time, Hank.
- Hank!

1122
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,908
- Hank!
- Good night!

1123
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:48,186
No, all right, stop it.
That's enough. Thank you.

1124
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:49,687
Good night.

1125
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:01,324
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

1126
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:02,991
Mmm.

1127
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,286
Hey.

1128
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,287
You're late.

1129
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,580
What do you mean, I'm late?

1130
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,916
You told Rose you'd be home at 11.

1131
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:14,087
Well, guess what? It is 11:13 right now.

1132
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,630
Yeah. Late.

1133
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:18,549
All right.
That is not that late. Hey, Rose.

1134
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,301
Hey. I swear I put her to bed.

1135
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:21,260
- Did you?
- Uh-huh.

1136
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,864
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna ground me because I'm late?

1137
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,348
Huh? Is that what you wanna do?

1138
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,351
Do you wanna ground
your dad because he's late, huh?

1139
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,977
- Yes, yes.
- There you go.

1140
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,312
- Good.
- Are your shoes tied?

1141
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,956
- I don't think his shoes are tied.
- Hey.

1142
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,357
- Hey, Maddy.
- Where's Daddy?

1143
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,233
Oh, um...

1144
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,946
Yeah, so, your dad had to work late,

1145
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,657
but, uh, we wanted to come watch you play

1146
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,535
and then maybe get
some ice cream afterwards.

1147
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:48,454
'Cause he's not doin'
anything fun with anyone,

1148
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,790
and I am telling you the truth.

1149
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,225
I'm gonna walk you through
how our software

1150
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:11,811
can help you redesign
every aspect of your new mall.

1151
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,330
What you gotta see... What are you...

1152
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,114
What's goin' on? Stop it.

1153
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,711
Sorry, it's Bring Your Kid to Work Day,
so you can only imagine the...

1154
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,278
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1155
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:23,948
- Let's go out.
- No. Wait a second. Stop it, Maddy. Stop.

1156
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,601
We are... we are...

1157
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,579
- I've got your keys.
- Put my keys down.

1158
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,381
I'm gonna throw them
out the window.

1159
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,581
Wait, put my key...

1160
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,834
Give me the keys. Stop.
What are you doing? Whatis...

1161
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,879
<i>- </i>What's your favorite movie?
<i>- His Girl Friday.</i>

1162
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:39,964
Okay. That's a great movie.

1163
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,047
Um...

1164
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:42,759
<i>Bringing Up Baby.</i>

1165
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:48,097
Let me think more recent.
Let me think, like, not before the 1940s.

1166
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,181
Ask me mine.

1167
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,935
- What's your favorite movie?
- <i>I'm Gonna Git You Sucka.</i>

1168
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:01,277
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1169
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,696
What is that?

1170
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,020
I'm serious. I thought
there was something on the window.

1171
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:08,201
No, I don't fall for your tricks no more.

1172
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,704
What? I thought something was
on the window. I'm not gonna trick you.

1173
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,044
Oh my gosh.
There's a booger on your shirt.

1174
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,546
Take it off now! Take it off now!

1175
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,800
Take it off now!

1176
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:27,428
Um, before we eat,
I gotta tell you somethin'.

1177
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,972
- I gotta tell you somethin' important.
- Okay.

1178
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,099
So, Saturday night I gotta go out,

1179
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:34,977
<i>but</i> Jennifer's mom said
you can stay the night.

1180
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,147
Why can't I come with you?

1181
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,359
One reason why you can't come with me
is I gotta do a bunch of grown-up stuff.

1182
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,402
- All right?
- Mmm. Yeah.

1183
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,486
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1184
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,781
Okay, baby,
it's time to go to bed.

1185
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,366
Are you gonna sleep in those?

1186
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:52,078
You should take them off. Flip, flip.

1187
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,038
Okay, hop in.

1188
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,296
Aw, okay. Good night, baby.

1189
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,968
Good night, sweetie. Mommy loves you.

1190
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,265
Good night, Maddy.

1191
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,731
You wanna go back to my place?

1192
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:25,403
- For what? You wanna play some poker?
- I don't know how to play poker.

1193
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:28,531
But I was thinking something
even more fun than that.

1194
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,282
Wow.

1195
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,535
Is it Twister?

1196
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,412
It's a form of Twister.

1197
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:37,456
Okay, okay.

1198
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,334
All right, so now that I have
this information, I wanna be honest.

1199
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,418
Okay.

1200
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:45,047
I just wanna make sure that I'm...

1201
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,551
- That I'm keeping Maddy...
- First.

1202
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,012
- Yes. Like, she has to be...
- I know.

1203
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:52,305
...a priority, you know?

1204
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,057
- I understand.
- That's...

1205
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,475
I really do. I get it.

1206
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,602
Okay.

1207
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,271
That's part of what I like about you.

1208
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,564
Well,

1209
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,610
then maybe I should teach you

1210
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:07,528
how to play poker.

1211
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:18,122
Wow! This is amazing!

1212
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:21,667
I know, right?
It's gonna be so much fun.

1213
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,015
Hey, y'all gotta stop it!

1214
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:37,600
That's enough.

1215
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:39,560
Hey, slow it do...

1216
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,814
It's way too loud in here!

1217
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,361
- You okay, Maddy?
- Yes.

1218
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,904
Yeah?

1219
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,072
Yeah?

1220
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:54,241
- Hey, this is cool.
- Hey! Y'all gotta turn this...

1221
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,077
It's too loud!

1222
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,329
Come on, stay close.

1223
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:03,084
Dad! You hit the clown!

1224
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,460
Oh my God!

1225
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,671
He... he okay, Maddy.

1226
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,547
Yeah, yeah.

1227
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,150
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1228
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,385
Come on, give me your hand.
Give me your hand, honey.

1229
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,553
What an amazing day, huh?

1230
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,597
- Mm-hmm.
- It's, like, the best day ever.

1231
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:19,058
I feel like nothing can mess up
a day like this.

1232
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,143
- It was so perfect.
- Yeah, it was very fun.

1233
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:25,314
Yeah. I wanted, um... I wanted
to talk to you. Can I talk to you?

1234
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:28,734
- Yeah.
- So... I, um...

1235
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:34,198
I wanna introduce you
to somebody that I've been seeing.

1236
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:37,076
It's like a... it's like a friend I got...

1237
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:42,039
Well, I've been dating.
I've... I've been dating a friend, right?

1238
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:45,584
That I've... that I've been...
that I've been seeing,

1239
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:49,839
but I... I think
that you would... you would like her.

1240
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:51,007
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

1241
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,925
Can I have a lollipop?

1242
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,137
Absolutely. Yeah,
let's... let's get you some more stuff.

1243
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,722
Some more candy, okay?

1244
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,433
Maybe take one home,
and we finish this talk?

1245
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,643
Okay, but I don't wanna meet anyone.

1246
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,111
Hey, come... come here. Come here, Maddy.

1247
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,089
- Come here, come here, come here.
- What?

1248
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,197
- Hey.
- Hey.

1249
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:17,217
- How are you?
- Good.

1250
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:20,453
Good. Uh, Maddy, this is... this is Lizzie.

1251
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,414
Hey! Well, you can call me "Swan"

1252
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:27,334
or "Dude" or "Butthead"!

1253
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,921
Hey, so you guys wanna go
to the Tea Party thingy?

1254
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,465
- You wanna do that?
- Mmm.

1255
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:34,467
- Mmm.
- No?

1256
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,803
After 15 minutes, I heard they throw
the tea in the water, which could be cool.

1257
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,097
- Mmm.
- Yeah. I'm super ambivalent too.

1258
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,015
Mmm.

1259
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:45,061
I do hear there's a cool spiders exhibit
in this kids' museum.

1260
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:45,978
Wanna do that?

1261
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,356
- I like tarantulas, but we already went.
- Yeah.

1262
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,567
Okay, how about we wing it?

1263
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:52,568
- Yeah?
- Okay.

1264
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,421
- Let's wing it, Swan.
- Let's wing it!

1265
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:56,405
This is nice. You guys are...

1266
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,283
- Right? This is cool. Maybe it's too soon.
- Look at that over there!

1267
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:10,919
Ah.

1268
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,047
Hold on. Ah.

1269
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,925
- Yes!
- Whoa! Whoa!

1270
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:18,344
When the boat comes,
hit 'em with a wave.

1271
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,679
You ready?
Hit 'em with a wave. There you go.

1272
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:23,349
See that? See how cool that is?

1273
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,266
Yeah.

1274
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,478
I used to play
with these ducks when I was little!

1275
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,897
Hi, Billy.

1276
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:30,898
Hi, Bella.

1277
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:32,667
- That was your favorite...
- Hi, Lily!

1278
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:33,811
...and that was your favorite.

1279
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:35,611
- Duck, duck, duck, duck...
- Oh my goodness.

1280
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:37,613
- ...duck, duck, duck, duck...
- Oh, my... Ow.

1281
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:39,031
...duck, duck, duck, goose!

1282
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,117
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

1283
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:44,912
Let me do a solo.

1284
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,459
Solo, yes!

1285
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,797
You wanna draw the castle?

1286
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,358
- Yeah.
- What color?

1287
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,634
Hmm. Purple and black.

1288
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:01,095
- Ooh.
- And blue.

1289
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:04,223
That'll be great.
And then maybe in the middle,

1290
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:07,393
you could, like, add
some fire or something.

1291
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,019
- Totes.
- You know?

1292
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:10,855
Oh, wow.

1293
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,398
- Hey.
- Hey, Swan.

1294
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,862
- You like it?
- Yeah. No, this is, uh... this is somethin'.

1295
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,745
Maddy, I don't know
if we can keep this goin'.

1296
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:20,823
Why not?

1297
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:23,409
Well, because they're... they're walls.

1298
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,036
Our house isn't the house for this.

1299
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:29,039
Grandma... Grandma's house, those walls

1300
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,683
are the walls you wanna write on
because all her walls are white.

1301
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:33,669
Are you visiting your grandma soon?

1302
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:36,463
- Yeah. It's her birthday.
- Ooh, nice.

1303
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,716
Is Swan still here?

1304
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,926
Yes. She's actually in the hallway.

1305
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,137
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Not tonight.

1306
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,098
She wanted to come in
and tell you good night though, okay?

1307
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,016
Yeah?

1308
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,099
Swan?

1309
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:50,227
Hmm?

1310
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:51,979
Hey, Maddy.

1311
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,690
So I had a blast today. Did you have fun?

1312
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:55,608
- Yeah.
- Good.

1313
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,861
Is she gonna sleep in your bed
when she does sleep here?

1314
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:02,865
Yuck. Yuck.

1315
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:05,367
- No, I think that's... that's disgusting.
- Ick.

1316
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,703
Yeah. Yuck to death.

1317
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:09,455
She'll sleep in the bathtub.

1318
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,832
You can borrow a pillow if you want.

1319
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:14,543
That is so nice.
That'll make it more comfortable.

1320
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,128
- So generous.
- Yeah.

1321
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,297
You should take notes.

1322
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:21,175
- 'Night, Maddy.
- Good night. Get some rest.

1323
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,511
You forgot the two kisses.

1324
01:10:28,265 --> 01:10:30,226
I almost did.

1325
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:34,396
That's one from me. And...
...that's a big one from Mommy. Okay?

1326
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,480
I love you.

1327
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,191
Get some sleep.

1328
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:51,247
- You okay?
- Um, no, I just forgot somethin'.

1329
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,998
I'm a little upset at myself.

1330
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,293
Um, thank you.
You were great with her today.

1331
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,128
Please.

1332
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:01,882
It was easy. Maddy is fantastic.

1333
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:08,931
Maybe you could come over to my place
in the morning after dropping Maddy off?

1334
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,476
You might get a little lucky
if you bring me a latte.

1335
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:14,895
Okay.

1336
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:19,960
- Mr. Logelin.
- I gotta get out of here.

1337
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,704
It's so late. I'm sorry.

1338
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:42,131
Here we have a rule
that all girl students wear skirts.

1339
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:44,800
Rules? We don't need no stinkin' rules.

1340
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,343
That's what my dad says.

1341
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:48,929
Okay. Well, your daddy signed a paper

1342
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,181
when you were first accepted
at this school,

1343
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,267
and he agreed to follow the rules.

1344
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:57,396
Sister Kathleen would like you
to follow the rules

1345
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,773
and wear this skirt starting today.

1346
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,502
Are those boys' underwear?

1347
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,339
Maddy wears boys' underwear.
Everyone, look.

1348
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,716
- Maddy wears boys' underwear.
- Look, boys' underwear!

1349
01:12:25,799 --> 01:12:29,136
- Boys' underwear! Boys' underwear!
- Zip it, Darren!

1350
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:31,555
- You zip it.
- I'm warning you, Darren.

1351
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:33,098
- Boys' underwear!
- Boys' underwear!

1352
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,182
Cannonball!

1353
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:46,028
I want my daddy!

1354
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,334
Where's Daddy?

1355
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,504
We're still trying to reach him.

1356
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:21,480
Maddy Logelin?

1357
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:23,022
Thank you.

1358
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,776
Maddy? Maddy?

1359
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:26,859
- Daddy!
- Maddy.

1360
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:30,114
Hey. Oh my God, Maddy.

1361
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:32,950
Hey. Hey, babe.

1362
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:34,410
Oh, let me see. Let me see.

1363
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,578
- Mr. Logelin, I...
- Please, please.

1364
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:38,497
How you doin', huh?

1365
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:40,374
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1366
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:41,458
What?

1367
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,043
You're sorry? No.

1368
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:46,380
You don't... you don't have to be sorry.
Dad, Daddy's sorry.

1369
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:48,215
Okay, come on. We're leavin'.

1370
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:50,300
- Sir, sir, sir, wait.
- No!

1371
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,219
- Wait, sir, she needs stitches.
- No!

1372
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:53,929
Listen to me.

1373
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:57,033
We're not doin' anything here because
you don't know how to do nothin' right.

1374
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:59,393
I've been here. No, thank you. Come on.

1375
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:01,186
I know she's gonna have
a substantial scar

1376
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,479
if she doesn't get stitches.

1377
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,158
Look at me.

1378
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,244
You're so strong.

1379
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:21,290
Such a strong little girl. Okay?

1380
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,291
I'm proud.

1381
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:25,127
Guess who else is proud?

1382
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,088
Mommy. Mommy would be proud right now.

1383
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:31,008
We're gonna go get some stitches, okay?

1384
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:33,635
Squeeze my hand, that's all.

1385
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:35,761
There you go.

1386
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,893
Mm-hmm-hmm. Good job, Maddy.

1387
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,521
You're doin' good.

1388
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,276
- Hey.
- Hey.

1389
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:51,195
I've been calling. Is she all right?

1390
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,530
Yeah, um...

1391
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,200
Sorry I didn't pick up.

1392
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:59,578
I'm just, uh, a little upset because
I feel like I should've been there sooner.

1393
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,807
You can't blame yourself.
It was just an accident.

1394
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:03,831
I actually can.

1395
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,461
I can blame myself because I wasn't there.

1396
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:09,944
Anything could've happened to her.
She could've lost her eye.

1397
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,005
She didn't.

1398
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,799
- She could have.
- But she didn't.

1399
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:20,057
Can I, um... can I see her?
I brought her this guy.

1400
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,100
It's very sweet.

1401
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:25,979
I think she's sleeping though.

1402
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:31,527
I just think
that, right now, she's not ready.

1403
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:37,366
- Ready for what?
- For this. She's not ready for

1404
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:39,451
this, this.

1405
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,119
She's not ready, or you're not ready?

1406
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:45,123
Look, Swan,
the hospital that I was at today,

1407
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:48,669
it's the same hospital that Liz died in.

1408
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:53,632
I mean, thank God, thank God today
I got there in time to hold her hand.

1409
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,344
Because with Liz, it was different.
With Liz,

1410
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:00,889
I didn't get to hold her hand.
I got shoved out the room.

1411
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:07,646
I got shoved out the room,
and when I came back, she was gone.

1412
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:08,729
Hmm.

1413
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:11,587
She was gone, and there was a little...

1414
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,902
there was a tube
stickin' out of her mouth.

1415
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:21,785
Matt, I am so sorry
that happened to you.

1416
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:23,662
It didn't happen to me.

1417
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:25,747
That's the problem.

1418
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:29,585
It did not happen to me.

1419
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,563
- Okay.
- So don't be sorry.

1420
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:32,754
Don't be sorry for me.

1421
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:37,217
Okay, I'm, um, um... I'm, um... I'm gonna go.

1422
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:40,304
Would you give Maddy my love please?

1423
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,068
What's going on? What's wrong?

1424
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:57,487
I can't find Mommy's necklace.

1425
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,865
You can't find it?
Did you misplace it?

1426
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,366
I don't remember.

1427
01:17:02,242 --> 01:17:03,994
What do you mean,
you don't remember?

1428
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:05,996
Do you think it came off
on the playground?

1429
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:07,079
Maybe.

1430
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,000
Okay, all right. Hey, hey, hey.

1431
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:12,210
It will come up. All right?

1432
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:16,381
- I need you to go to Croatia.
- Croatia?

1433
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:17,633
Yeah, just for a month.

1434
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,426
Just set up the office there. That's all.

1435
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:22,929
Why don't you send Oscar?
His wife's Croatian. He speaks Croatian.

1436
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,056
- He does?
- Yes.

1437
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,642
Yeah, I don't care.
I'm gonna send you. I trust you.

1438
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,102
Howard, that's tough, man.
That... that's really tough for me.

1439
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:32,064
I don't know if I can leave Maddy
for over a month. I can't do that.

1440
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:35,025
It's an opportunity.
College tuition's not gettin' any cheaper.

1441
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:37,148
College tuition?
I'm trying to get through the week.

1442
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:40,405
Yeah, well, hey, that's how it happens.
Think about it.

1443
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:42,032
I don't need to...

1444
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,665
Yeah, I mean,
I should be traveling for work right now.

1445
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,793
I just don't... I don't know if I wanna
leave her with a friend for that long.

1446
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:55,295
And this is
just the beginnin' travel-wise.

1447
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,756
<i>Welcome to not knowing
the right thing to do.</i>

1448
01:17:58,256 --> 01:17:59,716
<i>That's a dad specialty.</i>

1449
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:01,425
Hmm.

1450
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,183
Is Swan coming to Minnesota?

1451
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:11,103
Uh...

1452
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:13,480
I don't think we're gonna be seeing
much of Swan anymore.

1453
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:14,898
Why not?

1454
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:17,317
Because Swan and I broke up.

1455
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,945
What? You didn't talk to me about that!

1456
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,739
I did not talk to you about it
because I don't need your permission.

1457
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:24,616
Call her and say you're still going out.

1458
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,076
No. It doesn't work like that.

1459
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,159
So make it work.

1460
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:30,247
Stop. You're pushin' it. I don't even know
why you're actin' like you care.

1461
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:31,873
You didn't even wanna meet her.

1462
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:34,459
Yeah, but now I know her.
And we need more people.

1463
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:37,379
- Other people have more people.
- What are you talking about, Maddy?

1464
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:38,797
It's always just us.

1465
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,757
Oh, I'm sorry for being your dad.

1466
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,884
I'm sorry for bein' around.
Is that what you want?

1467
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:44,886
It's not even just us all the time.

1468
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:47,931
You got Jordan.
You got Oscar. You got Poker Sundays.

1469
01:18:48,014 --> 01:18:50,350
Swan's not at Poker Sunday.

1470
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,144
Because Swan does not play poker.

1471
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,227
I don't care!

1472
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:57,232
I like her, and I like my grandmas
and Grandpa Mike. And we never see them!

1473
01:18:57,315 --> 01:18:59,443
Okay, what are you talkin' about?
Where are we goin'?

1474
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:02,988
How come, when something good happens,
it always gets taken away?

1475
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:07,451
I don't have an answer for that.

1476
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:10,078
And I don't have an answer
for anything else you wanna ask me.

1477
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:11,538
Don't ask me no more questions.

1478
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:13,582
For the rest of the day,
for the whole flight,

1479
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:15,505
I'm not answerin'
nothin' else that you ask me.

1480
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:17,794
Do you hear me? Question time is over.

1481
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:20,172
I give you an inch,
you take a mile. Carry your bag.

1482
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:23,592
- Uh!
- What? Who you uh-ing? Who...

1483
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:27,137
Hey, stop stompin',
I'll tell you that much.

1484
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:31,933
We are going to have so much fun.
Your cousins are waiting for you, Maddy.

1485
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:36,104
Yeah, wait till you see your room, girl.
It is fabulous.

1486
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,565
Yeah, come on in.

1487
01:19:38,648 --> 01:19:41,151
That's your art
on the wall there.

1488
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:43,111
Cool.

1489
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:45,530
I like to unpack,

1490
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:50,160
because I don't like things
to be all in a jumble in my luggage,

1491
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:51,953
and I can't find anything.

1492
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:55,874
I lost Mommy's necklace.

1493
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:58,502
Yeah. Your daddy told me.

1494
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:01,588
Why don't I buy you another necklace?

1495
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:03,548
It won't be the one Daddy bought Mommy.

1496
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,718
That's true. That's true.

1497
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:09,554
What was she like?

1498
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:17,646
Your mom was the best!

1499
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:23,026
'Cause she was strong and smart.

1500
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:25,612
You... you know, you remind me a lot of her.

1501
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:29,616
Hey, should we take a little Mommy tour
around the neighborhood?

1502
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:31,618
- Yeah.
- Just the two of us. Come on.

1503
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:34,996
That's where your mommy's best friend,
Anastacia, lived.

1504
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,791
Stacy. There's a creek behind their house,

1505
01:20:37,874 --> 01:20:41,586
and they used to go off
in there, diggin' up tadpoles.

1506
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:45,048
And they would bring
all of that smelly mess

1507
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:47,342
and mud into my kitchen.

1508
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:49,511
And then, every Saturday morning,

1509
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:53,890
this is where
your mom would come and play soccer!

1510
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:23,670
Hey, um, is Liz's room
permanently set up for Maddy now?

1511
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:24,796
Yes, yes.

1512
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:27,841
- Is that problematic?
- I think it's confusin'.

1513
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,469
With all she's been through,
the accident and everything else.

1514
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,597
Well, it wasn't exactly an accident.

1515
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:35,682
What is that supposed to mean?

1516
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:38,894
If you had followed the rules
the school asked you to follow

1517
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:41,313
instead of encouragin' her to act out.

1518
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,647
You don't think I know that?

1519
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,609
You don't think
I blame myself for what happened?

1520
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:48,278
You don't really expect me
to argue that, do you?

1521
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:51,364
- Let it go.
- Why do I try, man?

1522
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,575
- We are all trying.
- No, we're not.

1523
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:56,369
- We have nothing in common outside of Liz.
- We have...

1524
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,580
- Nothing in common!
- We have Maddy.

1525
01:21:58,663 --> 01:22:02,542
Mike, I apologize to you.
I'm not stayin' here. I'm not.

1526
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:06,379
- I'm not dealin' with you.
- Oh, please.

1527
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:10,258
I think you both sorta have
a thing or two in common.

1528
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,305
What are you doing?

1529
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:17,974
We're leavin'.
We're goin' over to Grandma Anna's.

1530
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,018
I don't wanna leave! I wanna stay here!

1531
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:23,855
Hey, hey. Don't start with me, Maddy.
All right? It's just for a little bit.

1532
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:25,774
You never listen to me.

1533
01:22:25,857 --> 01:22:27,067
Maddy.

1534
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,611
This was Mommy's room,
and I wanna stay here.

1535
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:31,821
I wanna live here
with Grammy and Granddad.

1536
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:33,823
Why can't we both stay here?

1537
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,283
I don't wanna go back.

1538
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,119
I don't wanna go to St. Joseph,

1539
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:40,497
even if Mommy wanted me to wear a uniform.

1540
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,297
Okay, listen...

1541
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,929
Mommy would have wanted you to be happy.

1542
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:01,685
That's what Mommy would have wanted.
Come here.

1548
01:23:33,633 --> 01:23:34,676
Happy.

1549
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,097
She seems really happy over there.

1550
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:42,934
- You know what I was thinkin' about?
- Hmm?

1551
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,228
That time when I asked Dad
could I go live with him

1552
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:47,151
'cause you wouldn't let me
do what I wanted to.

1553
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:52,652
I certainly remember. He brought you
right back here, all across town.

1554
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:55,237
He knew.

1555
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:59,034

1566
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,285
when you were a baby

1567
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:48,833
to... always try and do
what was best for you.

1568
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,505
And right now, I can't. I can't move here.

1569
01:24:56,132 --> 01:25:00,220
You know, but that shouldn't mean
that you... that you can't.

1570
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:06,226
You know, Grandma Marion and Grandpa Mike,

1571
01:25:08,311 --> 01:25:09,604
they brought up Mommy.

1572
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,524
And Mommy was the best.

1573
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:13,942
She was just like you.

1574
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:17,028
You know, um...

1575
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:25,161
You and your mom are
the best thing that ever happened to me.

1576
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,502
And I, uh...

1577
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:38,216
I wanna... I wanna thank you...

1578
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:42,220
for taking care of me.

1579
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,351
I want you to know that I tried,

1580
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:53,898
but... I know that you're happy here.

1581
01:25:56,025 --> 01:25:59,028
I just wanna do
what your mom would have wanted me to do.

1582
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,199
Two kisses.

1583
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:08,663
- One for Mommy.
- One for me.

1584
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:20,215
Hey.

1585
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:24,470
This is gonna be fun.

1586
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:27,891
It's gonna be so much fun, you know.

1587
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:30,935
You get to... you get to spend time
with Grandma and Grandpa.

1588
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:33,605
You'll be back?

1589
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:36,774
Yeah, yes. Of course, I'll be back.

1590
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:41,070
You know, Dad's just gotta go,
gotta go to work and, you know,

1591
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:45,575
take care of some stuff.
And I don't... I don't wanna be selfish.

1592
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:49,537
I want you to spend time
with... with your family here.

1593
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:53,708
All right? It'll be great.
This will be... this will be good.

1594
01:26:54,834 --> 01:26:55,834
Okay?

1595
01:26:56,419 --> 01:26:57,503
All right, give me a hug.

1596
01:26:58,338 --> 01:26:59,338
Mmm.

1597
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:18,191
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1598
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:16,457
Look, Matt, um, now,
I know you don't really wanna hear this,

1599
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:23,464
but, like, honestly, none of us thought
you would've did the job you did.

1600
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:24,382
Hmm.

1601
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,301
We thought
you didn't have a chance

1602
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:28,261
of taking care
of this little girl by yourself.

1603
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:33,016
Honestly, you did a way better job
than any of us thought you would do, man.

1604
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:35,810
You should be proud of yourself, man.
You did that.

1605
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:38,146
I mean, she ain't die, right?

1606
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,690
- I mean, I fed her.
- Yeah.

1607
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:44,986
Put Pampers on her, gave her some clothes.

1608
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:47,279
Yeah.

1609
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:49,782
Yeah, that's a good job.

1610
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:55,830
I mean, what I did, you gotta say, it was
probably the bare minimum of parenting.

1611
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:57,498
That should be enough, right?

1612
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:59,167
I think you're being hard on yourself.

1613
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:02,003
- I didn't mean it like...
- No, I'm not being hard on myself.

1614
01:29:02,962 --> 01:29:05,256
Nobody else thought
that I could raise my child.

1615
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:06,882
So, why did I?

1616
01:29:07,925 --> 01:29:09,344
What am I doin'?

1617
01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:12,138
What am I doin'?
What decision am I making,

1618
01:29:12,221 --> 01:29:14,849
and who's the decision best for?
'Cause I don't know.

1619
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:17,351
Cheers.

1620
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:19,975
- I'm not... I'm not cheering that.
- I did it.

1621
01:29:24,984 --> 01:29:26,903
Matt, come on in.

1622
01:29:26,986 --> 01:29:29,447
Close the door. Grab a chair.

1623
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:30,448
Yes, sir.

1624
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:33,493
I got... got some bad news.

1625
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:34,744
Bad news?

1626
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:36,746
I'm leavin'.

1627
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:41,501
I'm leaving the office.
I'm, uh, moving up that chain.

1628
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:44,796
And I've recommended you
to take over my job.

1629
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:49,300
Yeah, I... I figured
now you got more time to focus.

1630
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:52,011
You can travel more for work.
I think you're ready.

1631
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:56,140
This could... this could be yours.
Also throwin' in...

1632
01:29:58,184 --> 01:29:59,310
a new salary.

1633
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,315
It says, "Buy dog food."

1634
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:05,399
Turn it over.

1635
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:10,779
Wow.

1636
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:14,826
- There's your college tuition.
- I mean, I... I don't know what to say.

1637
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,702
You know what? You deserve it.

1638
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:17,662
Thank you.

1639
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:19,372
You deserve it.

1640
01:30:19,455 --> 01:30:21,833
You know...
...I'm proud of you.

1641
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,710
I don't know why, I've always felt
sorta like a father figure to you.

1642
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:26,546
- Hmm?
- Not a father, but, you know,

1643
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:28,589
like a... an uncle maybe or a cousin.

1644
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:31,509
Kinda like a... a... a big brother.

1645
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,846
Neighbor? Maybe I felt like a neighbor.

1646
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:36,806
- Big... bigger, older neighbor.
- Got ya.

1647
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:39,892
And I don't wanna get all sappy.
I'm not gonna get all sappy.

1648
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:41,436
You don't have to really get into...

1649
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,800
I'm not... I'm not...
No, no. But what I wanna say...

1650
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:47,733
I'm very glad I didn't fire you.

1651
01:30:48,901 --> 01:30:50,194
I'm, um...

1652
01:30:52,196 --> 01:30:53,196
I'm glad too.

1653
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:56,366
You're a good man.

1654
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:59,745
Now go kick some ass in Croatia.

1655
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:01,831
- And next month, London.
- Okay.

1656
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:06,559
I'm gonna see that and raise it.

1657
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:08,795
What is that?

1658
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:12,175
- Don't waste our time. Just fold.
- Don't fold, J.

1659
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:14,218
Am I the only one that feel like this?

1660
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,387
Does it feel weird that Maddy's not here?

1661
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,848
- Yeah, yeah, it does.
- Huh?

1662
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:20,994
We usually, like, play with, you know...

1663
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:22,138
- Cookies. Yeah.
- ...cookies.

1664
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:24,353
Cookies. I mean, the chips,
you know, that's cool too.

1665
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:25,771
You know, cash game,

1666
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:28,316
but do you have any, uh...
you know, do you have any cookies?

1667
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:29,999
You want cookies? Is that what you want?

1668
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:32,004
- We'll take some cookies.
- Cookies would be great.

1669
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:33,868
Tell you what,
I'mma bring the cookie out here.

1670
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:35,406
Y'all better eat every damn cookie.

1671
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:36,490
- Okay.
- You hear me?

1672
01:31:36,532 --> 01:31:38,701
- Yes.
- You better eat every damn cookie.

1673
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:40,786
Or else it's gonna be a problem out here.

1674
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:44,040
Let it be a cookie left
after I bring these cookies out.

1675
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:47,543
I mean, all he had to do
is say he miss her too, you know.

1676
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:44,535
The snacks are okay.
Not super international,

1677
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:45,953
but they do have Brazil nuts.

1678
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:49,957
Dude, thanks so much
for taking me on this trip. Seriously.

1679
01:33:50,666 --> 01:33:51,792
So psyched to be wingman.

1680
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,754
Yeah, well,
my Croatian's a little rusty, man.

1681
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:57,840
- Teach me some stuff.
- Yeah, for sure. Okay.

1682
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:01,052
Uh, repeat after me. <i>Začepi.</i>

1683
01:34:02,094 --> 01:34:03,846
<i>- Začepi.
- Začepi.</i>

1684
01:34:03,929 --> 01:34:06,098
<i>- </i>What does that mean?
<i>- </i>It means, "Be quiet."

1685
01:34:06,682 --> 01:34:08,267
- "Be quiet"?
- <i>Začepi</i>.

1686
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:10,992
Why would I...
why would I wanna learn that?

1687
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:14,774
Well, I mean,
you know, have you met me?

1688
01:34:14,857 --> 01:34:16,359
<i>- Začepi?</i>
- Yeah.

1689
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:19,070
My wife says that all the time.
You know,<i> "Začepi</i>."

1690
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:20,153
You know?

1691
01:34:20,571 --> 01:34:24,950
Look. Look at the duck.
Look at the ducky. Look at the ducky.

1692
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:26,952
Look at the duck.

1693
01:34:28,954 --> 01:34:30,206
Look at the ducks.

1694
01:34:31,123 --> 01:34:32,792
Oh, yeah.

1695
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:35,086
You like that duck?

1696
01:34:35,586 --> 01:34:36,586
Huh?

1697
01:34:37,129 --> 01:34:38,255
You like that duck?

1698
01:34:39,423 --> 01:34:41,550
No? Come on. Let's see the next one.

1699
01:34:42,968 --> 01:34:44,679
Ooh, ooh. What about this duck?

1700
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,263
You like that duck?

1701
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:48,808
No? All right.

1702
01:34:48,891 --> 01:34:50,393
This one was my favorite.

1703
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:54,105
- She says that one was her favorite.
- Because it always looks at the sun.

1704
01:34:55,940 --> 01:35:00,528
Okay. I love you, Dad.
I'll call you when I get back to the dorm.

1705
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:02,863
No, I'm not nervous.

1706
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:04,489
Yeah.

1707
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:07,451
Yeah. I can do anything.

1708
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:11,539
- Bro. Look.
- What?

1709
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:13,749
Oh my goodness.

1710
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:17,294
Maddy. Hey. Hey.

1711
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:19,130
Come here. You can do it, Maddy.

1712
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,840
Jordan! Jordan!

1713
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:23,508
Come on, Maddy!

1714
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:26,242
- Come on, Maddy!
- Come on.

1715
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:28,222
Jordan, do you see this?

1716
01:35:28,305 --> 01:35:30,725
- Are you watching?
- I'm watching this.

1717
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:31,976
Oh my gosh.

1718
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,520
Hey! Jordan!

1719
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:37,773
Jordan! She walkin'!

1720
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:43,362
Somebody's cuttin' onions
or something close to us. I don't know.

1721
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:48,492
Ready for your first day?

1722
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:51,620
This is gonna be kinda tough because
she's never been around anybody but me.

1723
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:54,540
So there's probably gonna be
separation issues. But you're a big girl.

1724
01:35:54,623 --> 01:35:58,252
- Give daddy two kisses.
- One for me, one for Mommy. Okay?

1725
01:35:58,961 --> 01:35:59,961
Mmm.

1726
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:01,838
Mmm.

1727
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:06,177
Maddy. Maddy.

1728
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:09,068
I'll just hang out to watch a little bit.

1729
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:10,681
- Sure. No problem.
- Okay?

1730
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:13,893
We should probably head
to the gate.

1731
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:17,605
Oh, do you want to, um, talk or sleep,
you know, on the flight?

1732
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:21,066
I tend to do both, actually.
Talk in my sleep.

1733
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:24,320
Um, so if I do,
just, you know, kind of nudge me awake,

1734
01:36:24,403 --> 01:36:26,655
or you can probably even talk
to me, actually.

1735
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,908
I'm pretty interesting
when I'm sleep-talking.

1736
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:29,992
I believe in you.

1737
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:34,455
Thanks, man. I mean, that's really sweet.

1738
01:36:34,538 --> 01:36:35,790
I... I believe in you too.

1739
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:39,502
- Matt?
- I really believe in you.

1740
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:41,670
Uh, the gate's actually that way. Matt?

1741
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:42,797
<i>Začepi!</i>

1742
01:36:44,673 --> 01:36:45,673
Got it.

1743
01:37:01,982 --> 01:37:02,982
Hey.

1744
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:04,609
Hey.

1745
01:37:09,448 --> 01:37:13,327
Daddy! Whoo!

1746
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:17,665
- I didn't know you were coming today!
- Oh! I surprised you!

1747
01:37:17,748 --> 01:37:20,209
- Oh! Guess what?
- What?

1748
01:37:20,292 --> 01:37:21,627
Look what I found.

1749
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,629
- You found it!
- Yes, I did.

1750
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:26,432
I found it and said, "I gotta get
on a plane and fly all the way here

1751
01:37:26,465 --> 01:37:28,843
to give it to you myself in person."
Come here.

1752
01:37:30,135 --> 01:37:31,135
Let me see.

1753
01:37:33,722 --> 01:37:34,974
So let's go home.

1754
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:37,893
Don't cry.

1755
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,144
I'm not gonna cry.

1756
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:41,939
Wherever you are, I wanna go there.

1757
01:37:43,774 --> 01:37:45,734
Wherever you are, I wanna go there too.

1758
01:37:46,735 --> 01:37:47,903
Give me a hug.

1759
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:49,363
Mmm.

1760
01:37:52,741 --> 01:37:53,741
Mmm.

1761
01:37:55,494 --> 01:37:57,371
I'll see you back here
at Christmastime, okay?

1762
01:37:57,454 --> 01:37:58,454
Okay.

1763
01:37:58,789 --> 01:38:02,293
Come on, Maddy. Come on.
Right here. There you go.

1764
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,505
I just wanna say thank you, Marion.

1765
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:11,552
For... understanding, you know?

1766
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:16,432
I don't understand anything anymore.

1767
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:23,105
But I know... I know
that she would be so proud of you, Matt.

1768
01:38:24,189 --> 01:38:27,151
You know, she said you were the one

1769
01:38:27,776 --> 01:38:31,906
when you showed up
with those little grocery store flowers.

1770
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,658
You had 'em gripped so tight,
you crushed the stems.

1771
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,994
I did. I did.

1772
01:38:37,077 --> 01:38:40,247
I was... I was nervous as hell.

1773
01:38:40,831 --> 01:38:42,958
I remember that day like it was yesterday.

1774
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:46,170
It was yesterday.

1775
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:02,603
Take care of her.

1776
01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:06,523
Grammy loves you.

1777
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:10,361
And Grandpa loves you too.
Give me a hug.

1778
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:12,446
Okay, put you down, huh? All right.

1779
01:39:12,529 --> 01:39:14,949
Take care of your papa. Travel safe.

1780
01:39:15,032 --> 01:39:16,825
- See you later, Mike.
- Mm-hmm.

1781
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:20,871
- Dad?
- Hmm?

1782
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:23,958
Are there the schools near us
where you don't wear a uniform?

1783
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:28,003
Uh, yes, there are, but I'm thinking
about sending you straight to college.

1784
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:30,881
So, we won't have
to worry about that, okay?

1785
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:08,252
Hey.

1786
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:09,335
Hey.

1787
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:14,341
We were in the neighborhood,
so we figured we'd stop by.

1788
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:15,425
No, we weren't.

1789
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,723
- We were in the neighborhood.
- No, we weren't.

1790
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:19,513
We weren't.

1791
01:40:19,596 --> 01:40:24,018
We were <i>not</i> in the area.
But I stopped, and I... I got some flowers

1792
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:27,104
that say, "Sorry for being an idiot."

1793
01:40:28,897 --> 01:40:31,942
I wanted to come and bring
the flowers by here and give them to you.

1794
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:34,379
I didn't want you not to be here
then leave 'em on the step.

1795
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:36,488
Then somebody come by,
they steal the flowers,

1796
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:38,741
and you never get the flowers. You know...?

1797
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:42,745
You know, there are a lot
of flower thieves in this building.

1798
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:45,308
- I didn't wanna say nothin', but yeah.
- That's really astute.

1799
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:47,373
Maddy?

1800
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:50,169
It's so good to see you. How you been?

1801
01:40:50,252 --> 01:40:53,630
- I have a really loose tooth. Look.
- Ew.

1802
01:40:54,214 --> 01:40:56,675
Hey, tooth fairy will visit.

1803
01:41:02,264 --> 01:41:03,599
So, I'll take those.

1804
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:07,852
I'm sorry.

1805
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:10,146
Can you forgive me?

1806
01:41:12,232 --> 01:41:16,236
I... need to talk to Maddy for a second.

1807
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,530
Okay.

1808
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:22,034
All right.
I have a very serious question to ask you.

1809
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:26,538
What are your favorite flavors
of ice cream?

1810
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:28,373
Hmm.

1811
01:41:28,457 --> 01:41:29,792
Strawberry.

1812
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:30,959
I like strawberry.

1813
01:41:31,043 --> 01:41:32,377
Vanilla.

1814
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:34,755
Coffee.

1815
01:41:34,838 --> 01:41:35,964
Hold up. Coffee?

1816
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:40,094
Seriously?
You actually like coffee ice cream?

1817
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,220
Huh.

1818
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:45,349
You don't like actual coffee, do you?

1819
01:41:45,432 --> 01:41:46,850
No, that's gross.

1820
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:48,852
Okay. Good. Yes, that's gross.

1821
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:52,022
If he is giving you coffee,
will you text me?

1822
01:41:54,024 --> 01:41:55,024
Deal.

1823
01:41:55,651 --> 01:41:58,904
Baby. Hmm.

1824
01:41:59,988 --> 01:42:00,988
All right.

1825
01:42:01,323 --> 01:42:03,909
Have we left him waiting long enough?

1826
01:42:03,992 --> 01:42:04,992
Eh.

1827
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:08,038
I guess.

1828
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:09,414
Girl, I guess too.

1829
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:11,083
Come on.

1830
01:42:13,001 --> 01:42:15,796
Maddy and I
are gonna go get some ice cream.

1831
01:42:17,339 --> 01:42:18,340
You wanna third wheel?

1832
01:42:19,883 --> 01:42:21,802
<i>♪ I know it's been hard on you... ♪</i>

1833
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:23,262

01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:25,638
Yes, I would.

1835

<i>♪ That they don't think
That much of you... ♪</i>

1836

1837
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:35,524
<i>♪ Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream ♪</i>
