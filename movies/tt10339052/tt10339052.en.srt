3
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:34,708
He's dead. Bugger off!

4
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:46,981
Oh, fuck.

5
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:30,491
All right,
let's hear it.

6
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:33,226
Okay, um...

7
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:36,964
"'Dragons of Orion'
is boring, absurd,

8
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:41,167
"and, frankly, it may only
be fit for a prison library

9
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,102
"as an added form of punishment.

10
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,740
"This is the third subpar
release in a row

11
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:49,175

publishing house

12
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:50,844
"of J.F. Stanbridge.

13
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:53,681
"It's difficult to tell
if Lucy Stanbridge

14
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:56,149
"is trying to distance herself
from the series literary fare

15
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,551
"that made the house relevant,

16
00:03:57,618 --> 00:04:00,487

17
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:02,389
"Perhaps it's time

18
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:04,491
"You clearly didn't inherit
your father's golden touch

for nurturing series material."

20
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:08,762
What does he know? Nothing.

21
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:10,564
Young adults don't read
"The Times."

22
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:11,665
I mean...

23
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:14,300
Young adults do not
read "The Times."

24
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:16,169
No, not "The Times."

25
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:19,773
What?

26
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:26,914
<i>"Dragons of Orion" is dumb.</i>

27
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:28,682
<i>All caps, "dumb."</i>

28
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:30,517
<i>It's trying to be Harry
Potter,</i>

29
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,653
<i>but it's not even
a bad "Twilight."</i>

30
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,688
- Who is that?
- Tracy's book club.

31
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:37,290
She has over
four million followers.

32
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:39,460
<i>But seriously,
who would write this?</i>

33
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:41,395
<i>I'd rather just starve</i>

34
00:04:41,462 --> 00:04:43,330
<i>than read another page
of this</i>

35
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:44,632
- <i>brain-sucking...</i>
- Oh, shit.

36
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:46,533
<i>...mind torture of a book.</i>

37
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,502
I have to get out of here.

38
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:02,549
You're the best.

39
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:07,253
You're the best, kiddo.

40
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:12,359
You're the best.

41
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,468
Shit.

42
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,671
Ugh.

43
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:47,928
Rachel, we need our own
Drew Davis.

44
00:05:47,995 --> 00:05:49,463
We need to look within.

45
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,365
This is not
brain-sucking mind torture.

46
00:05:51,432 --> 00:05:53,100
Burn it.
We need relevant writers

47
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,569
that can make us relevant again,
okay?

48
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:57,104
Who do we have in the pipeline?

49
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:58,539
Lily Dahl, next spring.

50
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:01,341
Libraries love her.
Bookstores, not so much.

51
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:03,844
- Mario Actavio.
- Mario Actavio. Yeah.

52
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:06,747
We need books that sell outside
of Latin America, please.

53
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:08,082
Henry Dudston.

54
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:10,316
Yeah, you know,
I got his first three chapters.

55
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:13,654
It's incomprehensible.
I think he's using again.

56
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:17,357
- That's the pipeline.
- That's the pipeline?

57
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:19,927
Everyone else is dead
or unaffordable.

58
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:21,195
Really? Ahem...

59
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,996
Is there anyone, um...

60
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:25,399
I don't know, is there anyone
dead we can revive?

61
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:27,835
Maybe a manuscript
in the basement or something?

62
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:30,437
Maybe, but pointless.

63
00:06:30,504 --> 00:06:32,406
- And he's not dead.
- Who?

64
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:33,941
Harris Shaw.

65
00:06:35,576 --> 00:06:37,177
Really? I thought he was dead.

66
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:40,547
Well, no one has heard of him
since your dad published him.

67
00:06:40,614 --> 00:06:42,281
What's his advance?

68
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:43,851
It was likely negotiated
in the '70s,

69
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,487
so I'd imagine
it's relatively small.

70
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:48,088
Let's look up his contract.

71
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:49,490
Wait, still, Lucy...

72
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:50,991
What?

73
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:52,993
He hasn't written anything
since "Atomic Autumn."

74
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,428
So?

75
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:55,763
Actually, it's all
he's ever written,

76
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:58,432
and that was almost
50 years ago.

77
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:01,535
Great. That means
that he's had a lot of time

78
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:03,904
to come up with something new,
right?

79
00:07:03,971 --> 00:07:05,906
Let's do it.

80
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:08,242
I mean, he could be dead,
actually.

81
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:11,211
Okay, am I crazy?
Tell me I'm reading that right.

82
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:13,113
Um...

83
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,748
a $25,000 advance,

84
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:17,618
and it looks like
it was already paid.

85
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:20,154
That means he owes us a book,
right?

86
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,388
- No.
- He owes us...

87
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:23,490
- I mean...
- Oh, my God.

88
00:07:23,557 --> 00:07:24,725
I wouldn't...

89
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,393
Harris Shaw owes us
a goddamn book.

90
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,928
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, yes.

91
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,430
This is exactly what we need.
This... This could...

92
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:31,698
This could save the house.

93
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:33,467
Hold on.
Hold on, there's more.

94
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:35,169
- There's more. There's more.
- What? I knew it.

95
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:36,870
- Two books.
- Ha.

96
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:39,373
The legendary Harris Shaw
owes us a book.

97
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,175
Okay, stop mumbling.

98
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,043
- Say it out loud. Out, out.
- There will be no edits.

99
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,379
There will be no edits
or revisions to the draft

100
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:47,114
submitted by the author.

101
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:48,549
- Uh...
- What?

102
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:51,385
Yeah. In exchange,
the author must promote the book

103
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:53,053
in accordance with
the publisher's request.

104
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,455
Let me see that. Why would
my father agree to this?

105
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:56,824
Let's just forget about it

106
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,826
and move on to something
more realistic, okay?

107
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:01,061
Well, doesn't matter.
Harris Shaw is a legend...

108
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:04,164
- He's a drunk, he's a recluse.
- He is someone that captures...

109
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:05,799
He's a madman, okay?

110
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:09,903
You know that story about he
shot his assistant once...?

111
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:23,650
Let's try again.

112
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:25,252
Really? I mean,
he's probably...

113
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,920
- What was it?
- Okay.

114
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:28,288
9-1-4...

115
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:30,757
I'm sorry, darling.

116
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:32,092
You know?

117
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,630
I knew it was stupid
and foolish and rubbishy.

118
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:40,901
You know bloody telephones.

119
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:44,204
Telephones are bullshite,
aren't they?

120
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:45,906
Hey.

121
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:47,174
Bullshite.

122
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:48,742
This is crazy.

123
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:50,711
We don't even know if he lives
in Westchester anymore.

124
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:52,946
Well, I don't know.
I guess we'll find out.

125
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:56,483
Did you know he left Britain
to evade taxes?

126
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,052
Yeah, a lot of famous people
do that.

127
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:01,722
And he was thrown out of
Ireland for disorderly behavior.

128
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:03,490
So? He's opinionated.

129
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:04,758
Ireland, Lucy.

130
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:07,127
They invented
disorderly behavior.

131
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:09,062
And here we go again.

132
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,964
He shot his last
assistant

133
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:13,166
because he mistook him
for a bear.

134
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,135
- Oh, I don't believe that.
- How is that even possible?

135
00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:17,437
I don't believe...
You can't believe everything

136
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:18,972
they put on those websites,
okay?

137
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,041
Anyone can write that stuff.
It's fiction.

138
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:23,610
- They went to court for it.
- I don't believe it.

139
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:25,279
No way. He didn't shoot anyone.

140
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:27,414
We're screwed.

141
00:09:31,752 --> 00:09:33,320
Okay, this is it.

142
00:09:33,388 --> 00:09:34,755
189.

143
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:37,925
Holy parking tickets.

144
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:44,598
"Piss off."

145
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,801
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

146
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:51,204
Well, it was a lovely drive.

147
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:52,572
Let's go.

148
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,842
Oh, come on.
That's probably a joke.

149
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:57,177
Mm...

150
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:58,379
looks pretty serious.

151
00:09:58,445 --> 00:09:59,613
Let's go around back.

152
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,382
Come on. Come on.

153
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:05,485
See, I think "piss off"
pertains to the whole property.

154
00:10:05,552 --> 00:10:07,422
We're just checking on him,
okay?

155
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,956
Maybe he needs our help.

156
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:10,425
You don't know.

157
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,926
A lot of neighbors here.

158
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:16,730
Lucy!

159
00:10:16,797 --> 00:10:18,899
You're officially
trespassing.

160
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:21,635
Rachel, I don't care, okay?

161
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:23,971
We need this,
all right?

162
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:25,472
Fine. Fine.

163
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:28,875
Probably dead.

164
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:30,911
Mummified in some
rocking chair.

165
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:33,613
- Lucy!
- It's an adventure, right?

166
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,128
"Piss off." It says, "piss off."

167
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:01,708
Mr. Shaw?

168
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:05,846
Okay, we're officially,
officially trespassing.

169
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,215
It's fine.

170
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:11,618
Wow.

171
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:14,221
Look at all these books.

172
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:20,794
Oh! Oh!

173
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:22,430
Uh-oh! We're not bears!

174
00:11:22,497 --> 00:11:23,630
We're not bears!

175
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:25,565
Didn't you see
the signs?

176
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:29,036
I can't stand people
who can't read.

177
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:33,140
I'm Lucy Stanbridge,
from Stanbridge Publishing.

178
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,215
Thank you.

179
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:43,984
This is Rachel.

180
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:45,986
We're so sorry
to disturb you.

181
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:48,655
Love what you've done
with the place.

182
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:50,090
It's nice.

183
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,497
That's a beautiful cane.

184
00:11:56,563 --> 00:11:58,466
What kind of wood
is that?

185
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,600
Blue whale's dick.

186
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,069
Hmm.

187
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:03,538
Wow.

188
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,373
You're Joe's daughter.

189
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,908
Yes. I'm Lucy.

190
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:10,277
How is that venal,
toughy-nosed old git?

191
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:12,346
Um, he's...

192
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:13,947
not, um...

193
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:16,451
Not what?

194
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:18,285
He left the company to me.

195
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:19,953
He left the company to you?

196
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,355
Yeah, that's what I said.

197
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:25,759
Joe spoke very highly of you,
and can I just say,

198
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:27,761
"Atomic Autumn," wow,
that novel is...

199
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:31,698
I heard your mother
hung herself.

200
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,836
She suffered
from depression.

201
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:39,507
Where's my check?

202
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:41,141
What check?

203
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,344
The piece of paper that
you change for a sum of money,

204
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:47,482
the price of the reprint
of "Atomic Autumn."

205
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:50,150
Yeah, no, that's not why
we're here, Mr. Shaw.

206
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:52,119
Then why the bloody hell
are you?

207
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:53,787
Good question.

208
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:59,726
We at Stanbridge Publishing
were wondering

209
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:01,161
if you're working
on anything new.

210
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:03,830
The world doesn't need
anything new from me.

211
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:05,533
It's been a real pleasure,
Mr. Shaw.

212
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,067
No, we're not done yet.
On the contrary.

213
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:10,036
I think the world is ready
for new words by you.

214
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:11,539
Specifically Stanbridge
Publishing.

215
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:12,806
Rachel, contract.

216
00:13:12,873 --> 00:13:15,175
Now, I know this is from
a long time ago.

217
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,645
If you look here...

218
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:21,848
I believe that
is your signature.

219
00:13:21,915 --> 00:13:24,284
- Yeah.
- Yes.

220
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:26,587
So as you can see,

221
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:28,922
you owe us a book.

222
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:32,659
Got any manuscripts
collecting dust

223
00:13:32,726 --> 00:13:34,995
on any of these shelves?

224
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:36,497
Come on.

225
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:38,599
Anything you want
to show me?

226
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:42,436
I know my dad is the only editor
you've ever worked with, but...

227
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:46,840
I mean, if I could do a tenth
of what my dad did for you

228
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:49,276
and "Atomic Autumn,"
then I would have gotten you

229
00:13:49,343 --> 00:13:52,879
a tenth of the way
to a Pulitzer, right?

230
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:54,981
Whoa.

231
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:58,251
From the root
to the fruit.

232
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:08,195
- You think that gun was loaded?
- Think that cane was really...

233
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:18,171
Probably.

234
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:32,380
<i>I live my life
exactly as I want to</i>

235
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:34,548
<i>by my own rules
and own standards.</i>

236
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:37,652
<i>Yeah, I've always been
very interested in writing.</i>

237
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:40,688
<i>And I remember
when I was a boy,</i>

238
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:43,790
<i>I always read books about
great families and houses.</i>

239
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:45,493
<i>But is that... I mean,</i>

240
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,827
<i>that's really your sheet
angle, isn't it?</i>

241
00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:51,465
<i>My wife Elizabeth
is a tremendous anchor for me,</i>

242
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:53,434
<i>is my whole life.</i>

243
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:55,302
<i>Well, the one thing
you've both got in common</i>

244
00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:57,438
<i>is extraordinary amounts
of money that both of you...</i>

245
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:00,474
<i>I mean, do you think
that you're worth it?</i>

246
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,108
<i>I remember
when I left school,</i>

247
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:03,778
<i>everybody went into
a regular job,</i>

248
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:06,212
<i>and I knew they were gonna get
a good living all their lives.</i>

249
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,283
<i>Whereas I could have been
penniless my entire life.</i>

250
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:12,185
<i>And I was paid on a gamble.</i>

251
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:35,676
"Asshole.

252
00:16:35,743 --> 00:16:40,880
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you."

253
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:50,190
I'm really happy for you,
Luce.

254
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:53,026
I am. It's a great deal
for both of us.

255
00:16:53,093 --> 00:16:55,396
Jack's right.
We got a good deal here.

256
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:58,031
Sorry, the name
of the publishing house

257
00:16:58,098 --> 00:17:00,701
still stays intact.

258
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:02,268
Of course.
Of course.

259
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:04,572
- Bottom of six.
- Absolutely. Yeah.

260
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:16,916
- What are you doing?
- Sod off.

261
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:18,352
Moron.

262
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,887
You cut me off, man.

263
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,292
Move your car!

264
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,695
You're in the fucking way.

265
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:29,597
- Get the fuck out of the way.
- Oh, my God.

266
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:32,333
Lucy, I'm really not out
to get you here.

267
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,702
Believe it or not,
I'm actually trying to help.

268
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:36,269
I am selling you my catalogue,

269
00:17:36,337 --> 00:17:39,407
and you're trying to help me,
Jack? How is that?

270
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:41,842
I'm offering to keep
your father's legacy intact.

271
00:17:41,908 --> 00:17:43,778
His legacy is intact.

272
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:45,679
Of course it is.
Of course.

273
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:52,285
Shit.

274
00:17:52,353 --> 00:17:54,187
You think he should have
given the company to you?

275
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:55,656
I... Did I say that?
I never said that.

276
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:57,591
- You don't have to say it.
- He, on the other hand,

277
00:17:57,658 --> 00:17:59,493
always called me the son
he never had, so...

278
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,829
- You weren't family.
- No, that's true.

279
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:05,064
But I came pretty close, though,
didn't I?

280
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,440
Don't bother.
I know the way.

281
00:18:23,684 --> 00:18:25,151
Holy shit.

282
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:38,131
Your pound of flesh,
silver spoon.

283
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:50,644
You trying to drive up
the price, is that what this is?

284
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:53,714
Well, a new Shaw book
does add value to the catalogue.

285
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:56,517
Fine.
Shoot me a number.

286
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:59,319
- There's no longer a number.
- No, no, no, no.

287
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:01,054
There's publishing,
there's marketing costs.

288
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,723
You're not equipped
to handle this.

289
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,958
That's none of your business,
is it?

290
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:05,593
He's got a cult following
at best.

291
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:07,361
Hemingway had a cult
following.

292
00:19:07,428 --> 00:19:09,563
Yeah, Hemingway
had Max Perkins to edit him.

293
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,332
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

294
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:12,900
Lucy, be realistic.

295
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:14,067
Your father shaped
"Atomic Autumn"

296
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,336
into a best seller.

297
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:17,404
Who's going to edit this one?
You?

298
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:20,006
"The Future Is X-Rated."

299
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:21,307
It sounds like something
from the '80s.

300
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,776
How do you know
if it's any good?

301
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:24,645
If my dad believed in him,
I believe in him.

302
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:27,013
Nice weather
we're having, huh?

303
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:29,750
Very much the same
every day, so...

304
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:34,889
Every day, same...
Same weather.

305
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:36,590
You are in over your head.

306
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:38,492
- What are you talking about?
- Kid...

307
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,562
get me a Johnnie Walker
Black Label.

308
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:43,364
Uh, okay.

309
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,366
It's not some
silly YA novel.

310
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:47,233
It's out of your league.
You know it and I know it.

311
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,769
Do we have
any Black Label?

312
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:50,337
Get out.

313
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:52,439
Now.

314
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:54,173
It's fitting
that the writer

315
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,709
who put this place
on the map

316
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:58,177
is the man who's going
to wipe it clear off.

317
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,617
Phil, we are publishing
this manuscript, okay?

318
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:05,486
Well, he's right.

319
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:08,422
You can't afford
the publishing costs,

320
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:11,291
let alone the advances
on the books already coming in.

321
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,594
Well, then we will
borrow it.

322
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:16,162
The banks aren't going
to lend you any more,

323
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:18,164
not even with this.

324
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:21,234
Then transfer it
from my trust.

325
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:25,606
Lucy, that trust was meant
to look after you.

326
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:29,175
And I was meant to look after
the publishing house.

327
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,352
Times have changed.

328
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:41,522
So how a book
is released today

329
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:45,492
has become just as meaningful
as its content.

330
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:49,763
I won't do
the bloody tour.

331
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:52,533
Mr. Shaw, um...

332
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,768
Give me a call
when the check comes in.

333
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:58,237
You are aware of the contract
that you signed with my father.

334
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:03,109
The one that states
that you do the tour,

335
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:05,512
or I edit the book.

336
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:08,247
So those are your choices.

337
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:10,851
I'll be damned if I let
the incompetent hand

338
00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:14,021
of nepotism molest my words...

339
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:16,457
silver spoon.

340
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:20,226
I'm just thinking about
what's best for the book.

341
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:21,862
And you think that's you.

342
00:21:23,897 --> 00:21:26,433
You snarky dilettante.

343
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,835
Those are your choices.

344
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:35,109
All right.

345
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:37,210
But just the tour.

346
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:39,046
Fine.

347
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:40,514
And you got to take care
of Hemmy.

348
00:21:40,581 --> 00:21:42,583
- Hemmy?
- Hemmy's my cat.

349
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,619
He needs medical attention
three times a day.

350
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:47,253
Great. Rachel's great
with cats.

351
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,591
Jeez, my roommate,
she's allergic to cats.

352
00:21:50,658 --> 00:21:53,027
That's okay.
You can stay at my place.

353
00:21:53,093 --> 00:21:54,561
- Not a problem.
- Okay.

354
00:21:54,628 --> 00:21:56,295
Oh, yeah, and I'll need
plenty of

355
00:21:56,363 --> 00:21:58,732
Johnnie Walker Black Label,

356
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,902
White Wolf cigars,

357
00:22:01,969 --> 00:22:04,203
and shelled peanuts.

358
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,106
The salted kind.

359
00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:07,941
Of course.

360
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:10,878
Also, I don't want
to get up before noon.

361
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,212
Um, I don't do interviews.

362
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,615
And I like my...

363
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,047
And now, it is my great pleasure
to introduce a lion

364
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:49,183
of American literature.

365
00:22:49,248 --> 00:22:53,252
One of the most controversial
writers of our time...

366
00:22:54,488 --> 00:22:56,255
a national treasure...

367
00:22:57,591 --> 00:23:00,127
You know what? Make that
an international treasure.

368
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:02,429
An iconoclast.

369
00:23:02,496 --> 00:23:04,631
"An iconoclast."

370
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:07,434
The author
of "The Future Is X-Rated"...

371
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,002
"Iconoclast."

372
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:10,704
...Mr. Harris Shaw.

373
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:12,873
You would have loved that
word, wouldn't you, darling?

374
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:17,778
Who the bloody hell
are you staring at?

375
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:22,182
At least I wrote
my own books.

376
00:23:22,248 --> 00:23:26,019
His life's work
has touched all of us.

377
00:23:26,086 --> 00:23:28,622
"Iconoclast."

378
00:23:30,691 --> 00:23:32,993
Harris Shaw?

379
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,361
Ah.

380
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:38,465
There he is.

381
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:43,871
Thank you. Thank you.

382
00:23:46,106 --> 00:23:47,541
There he is.

383
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:57,551
Thank you.

384
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:04,091
Good evening.

385
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:10,330
I came here tonight
to read to you

386
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:12,499
from my book.

387
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:15,235
But I have found...

388
00:24:15,301 --> 00:24:17,671
a piece of literature

389
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:22,209
more compelling
and more honest

390
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:26,380
than anything
I could write.

391
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:32,686
And I want to share it
with you tonight.

392
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:42,262
Penthouse.

393
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,037
September 1977.

394
00:24:52,105 --> 00:24:57,544
"Lindsay had the ass
of a 12-year-old boy.

395
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,548
"And the kind of tits

396
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:03,684
"that hung off her

397
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:08,956
like drops of fresh
morning dew."

398
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:13,961
Dew. Dew.

399
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,340
<i>So, the profile I made him
is blowing up.</i>

400
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:27,274
- <i>It's off the charts.</i>
- Thank you for doing that.

401
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:28,742
Okay, I'll talk to you after.
Bye.

402
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:31,812
Oh, my God, you really have
the tiger by the tail here.

403
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:34,081
He's outrageous.

404
00:25:34,147 --> 00:25:35,582
That's Harris Shaw.

405
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:37,084
That was absolutely horrifying.

406
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:41,922
But somehow you have over 20,000
followers already.

407
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:43,457
Incredible.

408
00:25:43,523 --> 00:25:45,759
Christ had followers.

409
00:25:45,826 --> 00:25:47,928
It didn't end well for him.

410
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:49,630
The Bible was a best seller,
wasn't it?

411
00:25:49,696 --> 00:25:51,366
Lucy Stanbridge.
There you are.

412
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:52,666
Fuck. Shit, shit.

413
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:54,568
Okay, this man
that is coming towards us

414
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:56,103
is an absolute nightmare.

415
00:25:56,169 --> 00:25:58,238
He thinks he's Truman Capote.
He has an insane ego.

416
00:25:58,305 --> 00:25:59,406
You have to be nice to him.

417
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:00,674
And the great Harris Shaw.

418
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:02,876
Penthouse letters
at a book launch.

419
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:04,244
Edgy.

420
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:05,846
Harris, this is Halpern Nolan,

421
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:07,881
the book reviewer
for "The Times."

422
00:26:07,948 --> 00:26:09,082
Yeah?

423
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:11,485
I don't like book critics.

424
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:14,054
Well, I can't help you there.

425
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:15,689
Did you have a look
at my book, Halprick?

426
00:26:15,756 --> 00:26:18,759
- It's Halpern.
- It's Halpern.

427
00:26:18,825 --> 00:26:20,060
I did.

428
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:24,431
And I found it frankly
totally pessimistic.

429
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:26,767
- Well, it has a happy ending.
- Please.

430
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,635
The last woman on earth
is left barren,

431
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:30,103
and the last man is impotent.

432
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,939
And when they finally
do conceive,

433
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,640
mother and baby die
in childbirth.

434
00:26:33,707 --> 00:26:35,709
How the hell
is that a happy en...?

435
00:26:35,776 --> 00:26:37,611
Harris.

436
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:40,814
You still are fucking up
the best, Halprick.

437
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:42,482
- Harris, let him go.
- You're bullshite.

438
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:44,251
You're all bullshite!

439
00:26:44,318 --> 00:26:46,586
Harris, get off of him.

440
00:26:46,653 --> 00:26:48,522
Jesus!

441
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:50,157
What the hell
is the matter with you?

442
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:51,392
Nothing.

443
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,593
You will be hearing
from my attorney.

444
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,095
Halpern.

445
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:59,166
You, stay.
Halpern. Halpern.

446
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:01,301
Rachel? Call Phil.

447
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,703
Who are you looking at?

448
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:05,906
Fuck off.

449
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:07,674
- Halpern!
- He tried to kill me.

450
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:09,377
I'm calling the police.

451
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:10,744
Fuck.

452
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:13,947
You can't cancel the reading.

453
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:16,516
The book is brilliant
and Shaw is trending, okay?

454
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,218
You know what that means?

455
00:27:18,285 --> 00:27:21,356
He's trending online, you know?
Right up there with, uh...

456
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:23,056
Just hold on
for a second.

457
00:27:23,123 --> 00:27:26,493
...global warming
and obese cats.

458
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,662
He is not homophobic, okay?

459
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:30,130
He hates everybody.

460
00:27:30,197 --> 00:27:32,599
He hates children.
He hates families. He hates me.

461
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,900
Line two.

462
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:36,069
And, in fact,
"it's all bullshite"

463
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:38,772
is now the number two...

464
00:27:39,873 --> 00:27:42,477
uh, most popular hashtag.

465
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:43,643
"Bullshite" is not
a bad word.

466
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,447
It just means "bullshit"
in British.

467
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:49,583
You know, British people
are crazy.

468
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:51,118
And, by the way,

469
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:53,920
social media does not represent
the real world, okay?

470
00:27:53,987 --> 00:27:55,822
Hello?

471
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:57,758
No one has a problem
with Harris Shaw.

472
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:01,228
He's a very kind old man
who is a...

473
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:02,929
is a... is a legend.

474
00:28:02,996 --> 00:28:05,333
You publish him first, okay?

475
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,502
So don't look at me like that.

476
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:09,337
- Yeah?
- Hi.

477
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:11,238
How's it going?

478
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:13,173
Everyone's canceling.

479
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:16,477
The Lizard Lounge has it.

480
00:28:16,543 --> 00:28:18,346
Mm-hmm. What?

481
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:20,047
The bar in Boston?

482
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:22,916
They just tweeted an invitation
for Harris to do a reading.

483
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:24,317
Yeah, it's a bar.
Forget it.

484
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:26,019
Not just any bar.

485
00:28:26,086 --> 00:28:29,723
It's where Harris performed his
spoken word back in the day.

486
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,558
It's where he read
his unpublished stories.

487
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:34,895
- It's where your father...
- Discovered him.

488
00:28:37,697 --> 00:28:40,100
It's kind of perfect.

489
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:41,868
Book him.

490
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:44,505
And I'll go bail him out.

491
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:47,040
He's already booked.

492
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:49,943
Good.

493
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,645
<i>Book any damn barn,</i>

494
00:28:51,711 --> 00:28:53,313
<i>any city that canceled us.</i>

495
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:55,816
<i>We are doing this tour.</i>

496
00:29:01,922 --> 00:29:05,592
I am not riding
in that crotch rocket.

497
00:29:10,697 --> 00:29:13,367
Wee! Whoo!

498
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:17,671
Sorry. I am a good driver.
I just...

499
00:29:17,737 --> 00:29:20,240
This is backwards for me.

500
00:29:24,177 --> 00:29:25,779
Whee!

501
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:29,616
This is exciting.

502
00:29:37,492 --> 00:29:40,827
Man, I used to beg my dad
to take me on book tours

503
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:42,662
when I was little.

504
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:46,601
But he never would.

505
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:50,371
He always told me
that the road

506
00:29:50,438 --> 00:29:52,507
was no place for a young girl.

507
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:53,874
So...

508
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:57,578
do you remember that cartoon

509
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:00,013
with the coyote
and the roadrunner?

510
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,115
Do you remember that?

511
00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:03,850
We used to watch it
on television,

512
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:06,286
and my dad, he would point
to the screen and say,

513
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:09,490
"You can come on tour with me
when you're as quick

514
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,925
and crafty
as that roadrunner."

515
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:15,095
And I never knew
what that meant.

516
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:18,765
You don't want to talk?

517
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:20,934
I don't want to talk to you.

518
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,982
The roadrunner's top speed

519
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:13,454
is about 20 miles an hour.

520
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:18,693
And the coyote is 43-plus.

521
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:23,730
So this cartoon
is bullshite.

522
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:31,004
Truth is always
the first casualty.

523
00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:34,040
It's all bullshite.

524
00:31:35,842 --> 00:31:38,646
This is a book tour,
you see?

525
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:41,748
So why don't I
read something?

526
00:31:41,815 --> 00:31:43,149
Eh?

527
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:44,884
- Whoo!
- Come on, dude.

528
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:48,188
"Bullshite. Bullshite.
Bullshite."

529
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:51,359
"Bullshite. Bullshite.

530
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:54,595
"Bullshite. Bullshite.

531
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,795
Bullshite."

532
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:57,897
- Bullshite.
- Bullshite!

533
00:31:57,964 --> 00:31:59,600
Bullshite. Bullshite.

534
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:03,903
Bullshite! Bullshite! Bullshite!

535
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,839
Yeah. Bullshite.

536
00:32:05,905 --> 00:32:08,643
Bullshite! Bullshite! Bullshite!

537
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:11,545
Bullshite! Bullshite!

538
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,901
Bullshite! Bullshite! Bullshite!

539
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:36,704
He's great.

540
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:38,339
Yeah.

541
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:40,106
Yeah!

542
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,817
Just a reminder
to everybody

543
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:54,622
that this man wrote a book.

544
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:57,725
That it's for sale right now.

545
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:59,593
I got it live.

546
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,827
Yeah, come on.

547
00:33:00,894 --> 00:33:02,262
Another pour,
will you?

548
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:06,367
Yes, finally,
someone that reads.

549
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:08,469
Wow.

550
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:10,338
So, got T-shirts?

551
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:11,739
No.

552
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:13,273
I have books.

553
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:16,076
Uh...

554
00:33:16,142 --> 00:33:18,479
yeah, you should sell T-shirts.

555
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,081
I'll keep that in mind.

556
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:24,150
Jeez.

557
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:32,426
I thought that went
rather well.

558
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:34,160
You know, Harris,
it would be helpful

559
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:35,463
if at the next reading

560
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:38,599
you would actually read
from the book.

561
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,468
If you won't let me edit it,

562
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:43,604
at least let me sell it,
okay, Harris?

563
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:46,072
Harris?

564
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:49,008
Don't forget the books.

565
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:16,002
What the fuck?

566
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:27,448
Bloody hell.

567
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:50,438
So...

568
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:53,607
I'm going to read
from the book.

569
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,811
"Bullshite. Bullshite.
Bullshite.

570
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:59,112
Bullshite."

571
00:35:17,263 --> 00:35:19,767
Bullshite! Bullshite! Bullshite!

572
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:23,704
Bullshite! Bullshite!
Bullshite! Bullshite!

573
00:35:33,146 --> 00:35:35,616
<i>Bullshite. Bullshite.</i>

574
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:37,183
<i>Bullshite.</i>

575
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:42,188
<i>Bullshite. Bullshite.
Bullshite.</i>

576
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:44,991
<i>Bullshite.</i>

577
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:47,093
<i>Bullshite. Bullshite.</i>

578
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,696
<i>Bullshite.</i>

579
00:35:48,762 --> 00:35:50,698
<i>Bullshite! Bullshite!</i>

580
00:35:50,764 --> 00:35:52,433
<i>Bullshite! Bullshite!</i>

581
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,868
I don't get it.

582
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:56,035
Hipsters are supposed to love
old things, aren't they?

583
00:35:56,102 --> 00:35:58,472
Thrift stores and vinyl.

584
00:35:58,539 --> 00:35:59,874
Communism.

585
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,675
<i>Why isn't the book selling?</i>

586
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,210
We just haven't hit
critical mass.

587
00:36:04,277 --> 00:36:06,145
I may be in critical condition
before that happens.

588
00:36:06,212 --> 00:36:07,548
<i>Can I take your order?</i>

589
00:36:07,615 --> 00:36:08,782
<i>Hold on.</i>

590
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:10,149
Oh... hi.

591
00:36:10,216 --> 00:36:12,353
- <i>I would like an...</i>
- Okay.

592
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:15,054
- Hi, can you hear me?
- <i>May I take your order?</i>

593
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:16,757
<i>Can you speak up?</i>

594
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:18,091
Damn it.

595
00:36:18,157 --> 00:36:19,793
Wow.

596
00:36:20,861 --> 00:36:22,262
Hold on.

597
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:24,565
Trust funds, am I right?

598
00:36:24,632 --> 00:36:26,165
Trust what?

599
00:36:26,232 --> 00:36:29,436
Trust... and have fun,
and-and...

600
00:36:29,503 --> 00:36:31,338
<i>and everything
will be all right.</i>

601
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:34,040
- That's my motto.
- <i>What are you talking about?</i>

602
00:36:34,107 --> 00:36:35,676
I don't need your stupid
mottos, Rachel,

603
00:36:35,743 --> 00:36:36,810
I need book sales.

604
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:38,044
- <i>Excuse me?</i>
- Hi.

605
00:36:38,111 --> 00:36:39,780
<i>You can take my order.
All right, you know what?</i>

606
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:41,314
<i>Forget it.
Can I ask you a question?</i>

607
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:43,817
- Hello?
- Have you heard of Harris Shaw?

608
00:36:43,884 --> 00:36:46,754
<i>That old crazy dude
from the Internet?</i>

609
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,088
Yes, yes, him.
Have you read his book?

610
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:50,791
<i>He wrote a book?</i>

611
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:53,192
<i>He pissed on a book.
I didn't know he wrote one.</i>

612
00:36:53,259 --> 00:36:55,029
Odd. This is what
I'm talking about.

613
00:36:55,094 --> 00:36:56,630
Something must be wrong.

614
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:58,298
<i>Why don't you check
with the vendors,</i>

615
00:36:58,365 --> 00:36:59,800
<i>see if the book is placed
prominently.</i>

616
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:01,167
Of course, I'm on it.

617
00:37:01,234 --> 00:37:03,202
See if something got lost
in the system.

618
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:05,606
<i>Are you going
to order something?</i>

619
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:07,206
What do you want?

620
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,914
Hi, I'm with
Stanbridge Publishing.

621
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,816
This needs to be
in the window.

622
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:17,651
Uh, we're actually focused

623
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:20,421
on female empowerment
books this month.

624
00:37:21,922 --> 00:37:23,958
Have you met
Lucy Stanbridge?

625
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:27,361
She's the living embodiment
of female empowerment, okay?

626
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:28,862
You know, if she were here
right now,

627
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:30,831
she might even tell you
to get your shit together.

628
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:32,900
So get your shit together.

629
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:34,401
Please.

630
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:38,472
Thanks.

631
00:37:39,673 --> 00:37:40,774
Thank you.

632
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:45,244
What about talk shows?

633
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:47,715
He's too unpredictable
for network TV.

634
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:50,249
But the booker at Fallon
said maybe,

635
00:37:50,316 --> 00:37:52,353
if there's a cancelation.

636
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:53,754
Yes, wake up!

637
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:54,788
Then cancel someone.

638
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,155
What do you mean,
cancel someone?

639
00:37:56,222 --> 00:37:57,858
I don't know,
put out a hit.

640
00:37:57,925 --> 00:37:59,460
Put some ether on a rag
or something.

641
00:37:59,526 --> 00:38:01,895
I don't care how you do it,
just do it!

642
00:38:03,162 --> 00:38:05,099
Oh, no, no, no.
He's sleeping.

643
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:07,001
He's alive.
He's sleeping.

644
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,702
He's an old man.

645
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:10,704
He's Harris Shaw,
the famous author.

646
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:11,872
Let's go.

647
00:38:11,939 --> 00:38:13,641
Do you want to buy a book?

648
00:38:13,707 --> 00:38:15,342
I have...

649
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:17,044
- <i>Wake up!</i>
- Lucy?

650
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:18,612
Harris, come on!

651
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:23,517
Why doesn't anyone
want to buy your fucking book?

652
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:26,185
- Has Jack called?
- <i>Repeatedly. He won't stop.</i>

653
00:38:26,252 --> 00:38:27,621
And?

654
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:29,255
And...

655
00:38:29,322 --> 00:38:30,691
you told me not to answer.

656
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:33,259
Okay, well, maybe next time
you should.

657
00:38:33,326 --> 00:38:34,662
<i>Look, Harris is already
a legend.</i>

658
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:36,730
<i>But he's also
a brilliant writer.</i>

659
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:38,766
<i>Now, get him to read
from the book.</i>

660
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:41,167
That's...

661
00:38:41,234 --> 00:38:42,703
God, you're funny, Rachel.

662
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,972
- <i>I'm being serious.</i>
- I'm serious.

663
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,240
I'm nothing to Harris.

664
00:38:47,306 --> 00:38:48,776
I can't get him to do anything.

665
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:51,310
All I am to him
is is fucking driver

666
00:38:51,378 --> 00:38:53,447
and his scotch Sherpa, okay?

667
00:38:53,514 --> 00:38:55,382
<i>You're Lucy Stanbridge.</i>

668
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:58,085
<i>You're also his editor
and his publisher.</i>

669
00:38:58,152 --> 00:39:01,488
Right, two things he does not
want me to be, believe me.

670
00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:02,890
It's not happening.

671
00:39:02,956 --> 00:39:05,059
Did you order something

672
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,927
from Logo & Go apparel?

673
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:09,262
<i>I think they're T-shirts
or something.</i>

674
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:10,864
Uh...

675
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,766
What? I can't hear you.

676
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,300
You're breaking up.

677
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:23,177
Bugger off.

678
00:39:23,242 --> 00:39:25,311
It's your alcohol!

679
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,382
They're 20 each.

680
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,551
Two for 35.

681
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:32,653
I'll throw in the book.

682
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,221
I'll throw in
two books.

683
00:39:35,288 --> 00:39:37,458
Give you a little discount.

684
00:39:37,524 --> 00:39:41,294
You don't even have to buy it
if you just wear it.

685
00:39:48,402 --> 00:39:50,236
Dive bars and T-shirts.

686
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:52,339
It's impressive.

687
00:39:54,808 --> 00:39:56,309
It's... It's...

688
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:57,678
It's part of the new

689
00:39:57,745 --> 00:40:01,081
Harris Shaw lifestyle
brand approach.

690
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,717
What's that, the Martha
Stewart of hard living?

691
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:05,119
Mm-hmm.

692
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:07,921
Kale is out.
Scotch is in.

693
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,322
Right.

694
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:12,659
What are you doing here?

695
00:40:12,726 --> 00:40:14,027
Well, I've been
following your tour

696
00:40:14,094 --> 00:40:15,863
and, you know, I wanted
to come check in on you.

697
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:17,865
You got time for a drink?
I'm buying.

698
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:32,146
Okay, I just...

699
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:33,547
I just want to say,

700
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:35,314
just because I'm giving up

701
00:40:35,382 --> 00:40:39,219
does not mean that I'm going
to let you fuck me on this deal.

702
00:40:39,285 --> 00:40:40,454
I don't...

703
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,855
I don't want
to play any games.

704
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:44,191
No more games.
I don't want to play games.

705
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:45,659
No more games.

706
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:50,998
I just feel like I have
something that you want.

707
00:40:51,064 --> 00:40:52,332
- Yeah.
- And so,

708
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,700
I'm going to take
full advantage of it.

709
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,736
- Okay.
- So we'll just...

710
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:58,472
We'll just call Phil
in the morning, right?

711
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,474
- It's already taken care of.
- Okay.

712
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:04,545
- Wait.
- What?

713
00:41:04,611 --> 00:41:06,113
- What did you say?
- It's already taken care of.

714
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,016
- It's done, it's good.
- Wait, wait a minute.

715
00:41:09,082 --> 00:41:10,384
How could you...

716
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,852
How could you two
negotiate without me?

717
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:14,054
- It's my company.
- Don't worry.

718
00:41:14,121 --> 00:41:16,056
It's a fair number.

719
00:41:17,758 --> 00:41:19,927
It's a lower number,
isn't it?

720
00:41:25,032 --> 00:41:26,400
Isn't it?

721
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:30,437
What?

722
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:32,005
Oh, Jesus.

723
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,974
Unbelievable.

724
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,175
Un-fucking-believable.

725
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,978
Of course it's a lower number.

726
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:40,080
- You're further in the hole now.
- Oh, my God.

727
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:41,949
The book still adds value.

728
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:43,684
No one's interested
in the book.

729
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,319
They're interested
in this freak show...

730
00:41:45,385 --> 00:41:47,387
We haven't hit
critical mass, okay?

731
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:49,723
We're not there yet.
But we will be.

732
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,592
You're dragging the man's
legacy through the mud.

733
00:41:51,658 --> 00:41:53,460
Oh, whatever.
His...

734
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:54,828
Harris's legacy
is on him, okay?

735
00:41:54,895 --> 00:41:56,730
I'm talking about
your father's.

736
00:42:01,336 --> 00:42:02,669
Get out.

737
00:42:13,146 --> 00:42:15,983
Oh, and when you talk
to Phil in the morning,

738
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:19,519
please tell him
that he's fucking fired.

739
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:36,703
<i>The book needed a more
cohesive shape.</i>

740
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,772
<i>A greater unifying thing.</i>

741
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:40,474
<i>A great editor strains</i>

742
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,276
<i>the metaphorical dregs
from the wine,</i>

743
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:45,045
<i>and it's clear Mr. Shaw
needs a great editor,</i>

744
00:42:45,112 --> 00:42:48,181
<i>as this new vintage
will not age well, I'm afraid.</i>

745
00:42:48,248 --> 00:42:50,918
<i>Succinctly put,
as usual, Mr. Nolan.</i>

746
00:42:50,984 --> 00:42:54,621
<i>But do you think fans of Shaw's
seminal novel, "Atomic Autumn,"</i>

747
00:42:54,688 --> 00:42:57,491
<i>might still appreciate
"The Future Is X-Rated"?</i>

748
00:42:57,557 --> 00:42:59,626
<i>Mr. Shaw and I
have our differences,</i>

749
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:01,261
<i>but this isn't personal.</i>

750
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:05,032
<i>The book is determined
to offend every ideology</i>

751
00:43:05,098 --> 00:43:07,901
<i>that apparently brought on
its so-called event.</i>

752
00:43:07,968 --> 00:43:09,569
<i>It's a laundry list
of grievances</i>

753
00:43:09,636 --> 00:43:11,872
<i>rather than a thoughtful
examination</i>

754
00:43:11,939 --> 00:43:13,341
<i>of how this world came to be.</i>

755
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:16,276
<i>So, what do you make
of this so-called tour?</i>

756
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,211
<i>Well, while the book
is far from perfect,</i>

757
00:43:18,278 --> 00:43:21,748
<i>I think it deserves better
than its author's urine.</i>

758
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:24,818
<i>If it's legitimacy
the publisher's looking for,</i>

759
00:43:24,885 --> 00:43:27,888
<i>a circus isn't the best way
to achieve it.</i>

760
00:43:27,955 --> 00:43:29,323
<i>To quote from the book itself,</i>

761
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,792
<i>"Art is not propaganda.</i>

762
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:34,194
<i>It's an expression
of the truth."</i>

763
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:44,905
"Art is not propaganda.

764
00:43:44,972 --> 00:43:48,141
It is an expression
of the truth."

765
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,910
Your words.

766
00:43:49,977 --> 00:43:53,847
I want you to read
from the book.

767
00:43:55,182 --> 00:43:57,250
Go and get me
another bloody bottle.

768
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,154
There will be no edits
or revisions

769
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,923
to the draft submitted
by the author.

770
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,959
In exchange, the author
must promote the book

771
00:44:06,026 --> 00:44:08,261
in accordance with
the publisher's request.

772
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:09,663
I am the publisher,

773
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,567
and my request is that you read
from the book.

774
00:44:14,668 --> 00:44:16,069
It is not selling, okay?

775
00:44:16,136 --> 00:44:17,871
No one is buying it.

776
00:44:17,938 --> 00:44:21,708
You're not very good at your
job, are you, silver spoon?

777
00:44:21,775 --> 00:44:23,243
That is not fair.

778
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,746
You didn't even give me
a chance to edit it.

779
00:44:25,812 --> 00:44:29,484
This book needed
a more cohesive shape.

780
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:31,018
A great unifying theme.

781
00:44:31,084 --> 00:44:33,320
That's a quote
from public radio.

782
00:44:33,388 --> 00:44:36,823
We're not exactly
Susan-bloody-Sontag, are we?

783
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,692
No, I'm...

784
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,728
From the root
to the fruit.

785
00:44:41,795 --> 00:44:43,263
What does that even mean?

786
00:44:43,331 --> 00:44:46,401
It means that you don't have
the fucking freedom

787
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:48,802
to tell me what to do.

788
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:50,037
If your words
are so fucking perfect,

789
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:51,805
then why didn't you
read from it?

790
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:53,940
Why don't you go and get me
another fucking bottle.

791
00:44:54,007 --> 00:44:56,176
Fine, drink yourself to death.

792
00:44:56,243 --> 00:44:59,112
Meanwhile, I'm going to edit
your fucking stupid book.

793
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:03,717
Look, this is me
editing your book.

794
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,185
And I'm doing such a great job.
You know why?

795
00:45:05,252 --> 00:45:07,921
Because I got a perfect score
on my SATs.

796
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:10,991
I got a 3.9 grade point average
at Vassar.

797
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:13,994
I was president of my class
every fucking year!

798
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:16,696
I was captain
of the cross-country team.

799
00:45:16,763 --> 00:45:18,131
I worked all the time, okay?

800
00:45:18,198 --> 00:45:20,334
I had no friends
and no personal life,

801
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:23,937
because I was working
and I was really good at it.

802
00:45:24,004 --> 00:45:28,409
Oh, but all that

It's all fucking bullshite.

00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:33,180
I don't need this.

805
00:45:33,246 --> 00:45:34,848
Neither do you, clearly.

806
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:36,817
Fine.

807
00:45:41,522 --> 00:45:43,023
Fine.

808
00:45:45,092 --> 00:45:47,894
Go and get me
a fucking bottle.

809
00:45:50,297 --> 00:45:51,665
Go on.

810
00:46:00,874 --> 00:46:02,577
Fucking hell.

You guys, don't go now.

You said you were
going to read.

You fucking read it to them.

They're not here for me.

829

And I'm not fucking here
for them.

830
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:51,419
You know what?
It wouldn't matter anyway,

831
00:47:51,485 --> 00:47:53,588

reads anymore.

Well, no.

So, the book is selling.

Yes. Sales are up.

All because
of this gimmick.

Well, I think
what they're reading

has something
to do with it.

Okay.

- What?
- I'm going to be the host.

936
00:53:09,035 --> 00:53:11,005
You're going to be you...

937
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:13,039
except nicer.

938
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,777
More likeable.

939
00:53:16,844 --> 00:53:18,111

Again, I'm the host.

944
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:30,391
You're you, but censored.

945
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,492
Remember?

946
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:33,494
- Yeah.
- Okay, action.

947
00:53:35,094 --> 00:53:36,931
Thank you, thank you.

948
00:53:36,997 --> 00:53:38,231
What a great audience.

949
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,701
Hey, did you hear
about the hungry clock?

950
00:53:40,768 --> 00:53:42,068
It went back for seconds.

951
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:45,739
Ha! Your father should have
left you a bloody talk show.

952
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:47,841
Yeah. Okay.

953
00:53:47,908 --> 00:53:50,044
Can you just please humor me?

954
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:52,646
- Okay, go on, then.
- Mr. Shaw,

955
00:53:52,713 --> 00:53:54,213
what is your book about?

956
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,418
Well, it's about 350 pages.

957
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,920
That's very funny, Mr. Shaw.

958
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,623
It's been, what, 40 years

959
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,726
since anyone has seen
or heard from you?

960
00:54:05,793 --> 00:54:08,062
What have you been up to
all this time?

961
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,631
I've been drinking.

962
00:54:10,698 --> 00:54:11,832
Cheers.

963
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:16,604
You can't drink
on television, Harris.

964
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,439
This is going
to happen tomorrow.

965
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,641
- Oh.
- I'm going to ask you again.

966
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:23,043
Harris, it's been
a really long time

967
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:24,745
since anyone's seen you.

968
00:54:24,812 --> 00:54:26,647
What have you been up to
all this time?

969
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:30,116
- Drinking.
- Goddamn it.

970
00:54:30,985 --> 00:54:32,553
But why publish now? Huh?

971
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:35,656
What was the inspiration
for this new book?

972
00:54:35,723 --> 00:54:37,190
Money.

973
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,427
Money?

974
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:43,330
Well, I didn't have
a lot else to do anyway,

975
00:54:43,397 --> 00:54:44,999
so, you know...

976
00:54:45,065 --> 00:54:46,299
- Money and boredom.
- Yeah.

977
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:48,167
If you're really bored
you start writing.

978
00:54:48,234 --> 00:54:50,437
So you might as well
make some money.

979
00:54:50,504 --> 00:54:52,606
See, people have
switched the channel by now.

980
00:54:52,673 --> 00:54:54,975
You wrote your new book
because of money.

981
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,677
- Yeah, money.
- You know,

982
00:54:56,744 --> 00:54:59,380
- despite your mantra...
- I need the money.

983
00:54:59,446 --> 00:55:02,449
...the very popular
hashtag "bull..." bleep

984
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:05,786
is sweeping the nation.

985
00:55:05,853 --> 00:55:07,054
But I read the book,

986
00:55:07,121 --> 00:55:09,757
and I happen to think that...

987
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:13,761
there's an element of truth
behind those words.

988
00:55:14,862 --> 00:55:16,063
That's right.

989
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:19,298
A profound, deeper meaning
that you're getting at.

990
00:55:19,366 --> 00:55:21,035
Toughy-nosed git.

991
00:55:22,336 --> 00:55:25,039
You can't call the host names.

992
00:55:25,105 --> 00:55:27,074
I'm not talking
to the host.

993
00:55:28,475 --> 00:55:31,011
Go ahead,
give me an example

994
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:34,448
of the truth in my book.

995
00:55:34,515 --> 00:55:36,950
You want to know
what I think?

996
00:55:37,017 --> 00:55:38,452
Yeah.

997
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:41,320
Well, you said you knew
about the truth.

998
00:55:41,388 --> 00:55:44,391
Tell me the bloody truth.

999
00:55:46,727 --> 00:55:51,932
Mary and the baby die
during childbirth, right?

1000
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:55,234
And Arthur says that he's going
to bury himself alive

1001
00:55:55,301 --> 00:55:57,203
along with them.

1002
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,706
But he doesn't do it.

1003
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,807
He can't do it.

1004
00:55:59,873 --> 00:56:03,309
And your words imply
that he's a coward

1005
00:56:03,377 --> 00:56:04,845
because of that.

1006
00:56:04,912 --> 00:56:06,447
But I don't...

1007
00:56:06,513 --> 00:56:09,349
I don't think that's true.

1008
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:15,055
Because the wealthiest place
on earth is not, as you write,

1009
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:16,724
the graveyard.

1010
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,792
It's being alive.

1011
00:56:20,226 --> 00:56:22,963
Even if you're left
completely alone.

1012
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:26,433
What you don't realize is that
you have completely failed

1013
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,970
to rob the last man
on earth of hope.

1014
00:56:30,037 --> 00:56:31,338
Hope.

1015
00:56:33,272 --> 00:56:34,908
That's the truth
that I found.

1016
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,179
Oh, my God.

1017
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,651
Did you write all this down?

1018
00:56:46,386 --> 00:56:49,356
Yeah, it all on the manuscript
in the car.

1019
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:52,258
Go and get the manuscript.

1020
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,828
- Really?
- Please.

1021
00:57:00,134 --> 00:57:01,568
Bloody hell.

1022
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:09,209
- Hey.
- <i>Just so you know,</i>

1023
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:11,445
<i>agents are calling.</i>

1024
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:14,414
They want to send us
manuscripts.

1025
00:57:14,481 --> 00:57:15,649
What are you talking about?

1026
00:57:15,716 --> 00:57:17,351
<i>The call I just got</i>

1027
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:20,286
<i>from Drew Davis's agent
was particularly interesting.</i>

1028
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,822
Rachel, do not play with me.

1029
00:57:21,889 --> 00:57:23,791
<i>She wants to meet
with you.</i>

1030
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,694
She's very intrigued by your
commitment to Harris Shaw.

1031
00:57:27,761 --> 00:57:29,797
Oh, my God.
Harris Shaw.

1032
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,232
Fucking I knew it.

1033
00:57:32,298 --> 00:57:34,168
I knew it.

1034
00:57:34,234 --> 00:57:35,903
- How's he doing?
- <i>You know what?</i>

1035
00:57:35,969 --> 00:57:38,071
<i>I think he's starting
to respect me.</i>

1036
00:57:38,138 --> 00:57:40,073
I think he wants
to see my edits.

1037
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,043
You made edits?

1038
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:46,146
<i>I'm sure they're great.</i>

1039
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,714
<i>But don't show it to him.</i>

1040
00:57:47,781 --> 00:57:49,449
Well, he asked to see them.

1041
00:57:49,516 --> 00:57:51,552
Lucy, why rock the boat

1042
00:57:51,618 --> 00:57:53,319
when you're this close
to shore?

1043
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,257
Yeah, no. Yeah.

1044
00:57:57,323 --> 00:57:59,493
You know what I mean, right?

1045
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,195
Yeah. Okay.

1046
00:58:01,261 --> 00:58:02,696
<i>Have a good night.</i>

1047
00:58:02,763 --> 00:58:03,964
Bye.

1048
00:58:21,648 --> 00:58:24,852
Unity of effect?

1049
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,086
Unity of effect.

1050
00:58:26,153 --> 00:58:29,189
It's the effect of the book
on the reader

1051
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,557
is the purpose of the piece.

1052
00:58:30,624 --> 00:58:33,594
- Oh, yeah? Ah.
- It's the unity of effect?

1053
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:37,364
You mean that your
Papa Stanbridge,

1054
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:41,602
he donated a wing
to your school

1055
00:58:41,668 --> 00:58:45,873
so that you could understand
this bloody phrase.

1056
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,876
Just forget about it.
Just... You know what?

1057
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,778
Just forget...
Forget this ever happened, okay?

1058
00:58:51,845 --> 00:58:53,747
I don't fucking forget
easily.

1059
00:58:53,814 --> 00:58:55,115
You want to know something?

1060
00:58:55,182 --> 00:58:58,785
You are trying to accomplish
two things at once,

1061
00:58:58,852 --> 00:59:01,188
when you only need
to accomplish one.

1062
00:59:01,255 --> 00:59:02,589
Yeah?

1063
00:59:02,656 --> 00:59:03,957
Can you remember that?

1064
00:59:04,024 --> 00:59:07,461
Sometimes a man

1065
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:10,898
has to dare
to be ambitious.

1066
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,267
For instance,

1067
00:59:13,334 --> 00:59:14,768
I'm about to smoke...

1068
00:59:17,571 --> 00:59:19,439
and piss...

1069
00:59:20,407 --> 00:59:21,575
at the same time.

1070
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:23,744
- Ugh.
- Yes.

1071
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:29,283
And I think you should stick
to your young adult bullshite

1072
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:31,518
that you keep
churning out.

1073
00:59:41,628 --> 00:59:42,963
You like what I...

1074
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,765
You like what I had
to say earlier.

1075
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,733
You asked to see my edits.

1076
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,602
You said you wanted
to see them.

1077
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:50,704
Fucking fraud.

1078
00:59:52,539 --> 00:59:55,042
You fucking fraud.

1079
01:00:09,723 --> 01:00:12,292
I don't care what you think,
okay?

1080
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,161
I don't fucking care.

1081
01:00:14,227 --> 01:00:15,729
Yeah?

1082
01:00:15,796 --> 01:00:17,798
Well, it doesn't look like it
from here.

1083
01:00:21,268 --> 01:00:22,602
You know how much I care

1084
01:00:22,669 --> 01:00:25,906
about you and your famous
stupid book?

1085
01:00:25,973 --> 01:00:28,909
I've never even read
"Atomic Autumn."

1086
01:00:28,976 --> 01:00:29,910
I've nev...

1087
01:00:29,977 --> 01:00:32,112
Okay, okay.

1088
01:00:32,179 --> 01:00:33,647
Wait. Hold on.

1089
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:38,218
Heave away.

1090
01:00:39,786 --> 01:00:41,456
I've got you,
all right?

1091
01:00:41,521 --> 01:00:43,623
You're done. You're done.

1092
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:46,159
Okay, give me
your hand.

1093
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:48,095
Give me your hand.

1094
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:56,404
You know,
my dad told me

1095
01:00:56,471 --> 01:00:58,105
that the greatest day
of his life

1096
01:00:58,171 --> 01:01:00,140
was when he published
your book.

1097
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:05,812
If he chose the book
over you...

1098
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,015
he chose wrong.

1099
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:14,087
I always wanted to be
just like him.

1100
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:18,859
The great Joseph Stanbridge.

1101
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:24,865
"You're the best, kiddo.
You're the best."

1102
01:01:26,501 --> 01:01:29,302
That's what he used to say to
me after I'd read to him.

1103
01:01:32,773 --> 01:01:36,176
So we beat on...

1104
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:39,112
boats against the current,

1105
01:01:39,179 --> 01:01:44,317
borne back ceaselessly
into the past.

1106
01:01:44,385 --> 01:01:45,552
The past.

1107
01:01:47,154 --> 01:01:48,588
Gatsby.

1108
01:01:48,655 --> 01:01:50,857
Oh, well,
is that a fact?

1109
01:01:52,692 --> 01:01:56,063
It was Elizabeth's
favorite book.

1110
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,764
Hmm.

1111
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:03,270
What was she like?

1112
01:02:04,405 --> 01:02:05,972
Huh?

1113
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:10,243
You ever hear people talk about
the one that got away?

1114
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,611
Yeah.

1115
01:02:11,678 --> 01:02:15,816
Well, I was the one
who married her.

1116
01:02:18,852 --> 01:02:19,986
Well, if she was so special,

1117
01:02:20,053 --> 01:02:21,389
why the hell
would she marry you?

1118
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:29,830
Well, even the worst of us
get lucky.

1119
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,037
Hey, I'll show you
something.

1120
01:02:37,104 --> 01:02:40,307
This is a picture
of us when...

1121
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:44,945
we were at this book award.

1122
01:02:47,881 --> 01:02:50,518
Look the hell up.
You see? See there?

1123
01:02:50,585 --> 01:02:52,953
- Mm-hmm.
- That's a beer stein.

1124
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,089
You know what it was full of?

1125
01:02:56,156 --> 01:02:57,324
Champagne.

1126
01:02:59,793 --> 01:03:03,964
It's so typical
of Elizabeth.

1127
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,572
I'm going to read
your book, Harris.

1128
01:03:11,638 --> 01:03:13,240
Okay?

1129
01:03:14,941 --> 01:03:16,643
I'm going to read it.

1130
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,079
Oh, yeah?
I don't doubt it.

1131
01:04:11,432 --> 01:04:14,868
You look like
you might need this.

1132
01:04:24,545 --> 01:04:26,079
Thank you.

1133
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:37,425
What are you doing?

1134
01:04:37,491 --> 01:04:40,695
I thought if I made
another pass,

1135
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,963
we might reissue the book.

1136
01:04:49,403 --> 01:04:51,171
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1137
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:53,807
Maybe.

1138
01:05:00,548 --> 01:05:05,085
And maybe we could work
on the next one together.

1139
01:05:06,354 --> 01:05:07,521
Next one?

1140
01:05:09,222 --> 01:05:10,458
Yeah.

1141
01:05:10,524 --> 01:05:11,891
Well, after you go
on the show tonight,

1142
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:13,293
they're going to want more.

1143
01:05:13,361 --> 01:05:16,430
Let's just not wait
another 40 years, okay?

1144
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:01,875
Hello?

1145
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:28,001
So, we have to make a quick stop
along the way.

1146
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:29,670
Some business.

1147
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:31,871
I'm in no hurry.

1148
01:06:31,938 --> 01:06:34,408
Okay, good.

1149
01:06:34,475 --> 01:06:36,176
It won't take long.

1150
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:38,713
Fuck.

1151
01:06:38,779 --> 01:06:40,748
I told you, go straight
forward and sit like that.

1152
01:06:40,815 --> 01:06:42,315
There you go.

1153
01:06:42,383 --> 01:06:43,917
Got it.

1154
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:17,778
Hi.

1155
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:19,513
So sorry I'm late.

1156
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,515
I'm just glad you finally
made it in person.

1157
01:08:21,582 --> 01:08:24,385
Yeah. So has there
been a change

1158
01:08:24,452 --> 01:08:26,921
in his medication
or his routine?

1159
01:08:26,986 --> 01:08:28,321
Everything is the same.

1160
01:08:28,389 --> 01:08:31,358
He was fine until he saw
some man on the news.

1161
01:08:31,425 --> 01:08:34,127
- Really?
- He was as docile as could be.

1162
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:36,262
And then this.

1163
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,055
Holy shit.

1164
01:09:03,457 --> 01:09:05,291
Oh, bloody hell.

1165
01:09:06,527 --> 01:09:07,628
Lucy?

1166
01:09:10,531 --> 01:09:13,066
Sir, are you supposed
to be out of your room?

1167
01:09:13,132 --> 01:09:14,802
Sod off.

1168
01:09:14,869 --> 01:09:16,069
Oh.

1169
01:09:16,135 --> 01:09:17,438
Lucy.

1170
01:09:18,639 --> 01:09:21,040
I'm so sorry. I...

1171
01:09:21,107 --> 01:09:23,544
Did you see him do this?

1172
01:09:23,611 --> 01:09:24,712
Lucy!

1173
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,448
- What's going on?
- Jesus.

1174
01:09:27,515 --> 01:09:29,917
This is like a fiendish
incarnation of fucking hell!

1175
01:09:29,984 --> 01:09:32,185
Okay, Harris,
can you please wait in the car?

1176
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:35,422
I promise I'll explain
everything later.

1177
01:09:35,489 --> 01:09:36,690
Please?

1178
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:40,794
What?

1179
01:09:41,896 --> 01:09:43,029
Look.

1180
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:45,332
Those are my fucking words.

1181
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:46,934
What do you mean, your words?

1182
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:50,471
This. Those are my words
scribbled on that wall.

1183
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:55,275
Who the fuck has done that?
I've never been here.

1184
01:10:05,352 --> 01:10:08,622
There's someone here
that wants to see you.

1185
01:10:10,056 --> 01:10:12,225
It's Harris Shaw.

1186
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:20,968
He hasn't had
a lucid moment in...

1187
01:10:48,829 --> 01:10:50,163
Dad?

1188
01:10:51,699 --> 01:10:53,132
Dad.

1189
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,903
Dad, can you hear me?

1190
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:58,539
Daddy, it's Lucy.

1191
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:08,181
Harris?

1192
01:11:12,019 --> 01:11:14,455
Hey, what just happened
in there.

1193
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:17,791
You made out
he was fucking dead.

1194
01:11:17,858 --> 01:11:19,192
I...

1195
01:11:19,258 --> 01:11:21,127
Harris, why did he
look at you like that?

1196
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:22,763
He knows he's a goddamn
fraud.

1197
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:23,664
What?

1198
01:11:23,731 --> 01:11:24,965
That's what happened
in there.

1199
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:28,435
Right, here we go.
It's all bullshite, right?

1200
01:11:29,603 --> 01:11:32,706
That man found you,
remember?

1201
01:11:32,773 --> 01:11:34,207
That man made you.

1202
01:11:34,273 --> 01:11:36,877
My wife made me.

1203
01:11:36,944 --> 01:11:38,045
What?

1204
01:11:38,112 --> 01:11:39,346
What are you saying?

1205
01:11:39,413 --> 01:11:41,548
Joseph pretended
to be a great editor,

1206
01:11:41,615 --> 01:11:44,250
but he didn't touch
a fucking word.

1207
01:11:44,317 --> 01:11:45,218
That's not true.

1208
01:11:45,284 --> 01:11:47,421
Elizabeth did it all.

1209
01:11:47,488 --> 01:11:50,758
Joseph, he's not an editor.

1210
01:11:50,824 --> 01:11:52,158
He's a bloody thief.

1211
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:53,527
No.

1212
01:11:54,628 --> 01:11:55,763
That's not true.

1213
01:11:55,829 --> 01:11:57,331
Mm-hmm.

1214
01:11:57,398 --> 01:12:01,402
Your precious little daddy
is a fucking liar!

1215
01:12:04,071 --> 01:12:06,640
Then why didn't you
fucking tell me that?

1216
01:12:06,707 --> 01:12:09,576
If that's true,
then why did you tell everyone?

1217
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:11,979
Money.

1218
01:12:12,046 --> 01:12:14,848
We didn't have any money.

1219
01:12:16,215 --> 01:12:17,518
Elizabeth was pregnant.

1220
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,620
She wanted this house
more than anything.

1221
01:12:19,687 --> 01:12:24,692
And she said I'll get the
credit on the next book.

1222
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:26,060
It doesn't matter.

1223
01:12:26,126 --> 01:12:29,430
She said,
"We'll get it next time."

1224
01:12:31,065 --> 01:12:33,199
But, of course,

1225
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,503
there wasn't a next time.

1226
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:40,541
I mean, there couldn't
be a next time without her.

1227
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:44,243
I'm nothing...

1228
01:12:44,945 --> 01:12:46,680
without her.

1229
01:12:53,487 --> 01:12:55,689
You think you're a fraud?

1230
01:12:55,756 --> 01:12:57,958
That's it.

1231
01:12:58,025 --> 01:12:59,126
Right?

1232
01:12:59,193 --> 01:13:00,494
Fuck you.

1233
01:13:02,261 --> 01:13:04,798
- And leave me alone.
- Harris...

1234
01:13:04,865 --> 01:13:06,232
Get out of here.

1235
01:13:46,874 --> 01:13:49,376
- Come on, move it!
- I'm walking over here.

1236
01:13:49,443 --> 01:13:51,912
Get the fuck out of the way.

1237
01:13:53,947 --> 01:13:55,849
You're going to get
yourself killed, man.

1238
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:57,651
- Watch it.
- Get out of the way!

1239
01:13:57,718 --> 01:13:59,620
Sod off!

1240
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:12,298
- Look, it's him.
- Are you sure?

1241
01:14:12,366 --> 01:14:14,268
Yeah, look in the window.

1242
01:14:14,334 --> 01:14:16,302
OMG, you're Harris Shaw.

1243
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:18,505
Fuck off, you wankers.

1244
01:14:18,572 --> 01:14:20,274
Harris Shaw
just called us wankers.

1245
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,409
That's so awesome!

1246
01:14:22,476 --> 01:14:23,877
What's it mean?

1247
01:14:26,312 --> 01:14:28,348
- Hold on.
- Okay.

1248
01:14:49,336 --> 01:14:50,871
Fucking fraud.

1249
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,788
<i>If it was meant
as a publicity stunt,</i>

1250
01:16:14,855 --> 01:16:16,623
<i>it seems to have worked.</i>

1251
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:18,125
<i>The book continues to climb</i>

1252
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:20,160
<i>the "New York Times"
best seller list.</i>

1253
01:16:20,227 --> 01:16:21,862
<i>Shaw's no stranger
in controversy,</i>

1254
01:16:21,929 --> 01:16:24,131
<i>with incidents
of public indecencies...</i>

1255
01:16:24,197 --> 01:16:26,334
<i>And tonight,
people everywhere</i>

1256
01:16:26,401 --> 01:16:29,169
<i>are burning the book
in a show of solidarity.</i>

1257
01:16:29,236 --> 01:16:32,639
<i>Harris Shaw has certainly
made his mark.</i>

1258
01:16:32,706 --> 01:16:35,075
<i>We're all hoping
for a speedy recovery.</i>

1259
01:16:46,787 --> 01:16:48,655
Uh, well, we are so thrilled

1260
01:16:48,722 --> 01:16:52,059
that you'd even consider us,
Miss Davis.

1261
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:55,963
I want to push boundaries.
Get edgier, Lucy.

1262
01:16:56,029 --> 01:16:58,465
I mean,
not "pee on my book" edgy,

1263
01:16:58,532 --> 01:17:00,435
but, no,
the culture today,

1264
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,736
the man's
"we be provocative."

1265
01:17:02,803 --> 01:17:04,671
And given what you've done
with Shaw,

1266
01:17:04,738 --> 01:17:06,773
I think you might
be just what I need.

1267
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,141
So, does that mean

1268
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:09,943
that there's a provocative book
on the way?

1269
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:14,648
A marriage on the rocks.
Literally.

1270
01:17:14,715 --> 01:17:17,084
A couple decides
to test their compatibility

1271
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:19,553
by attempting to summit
Mount Everest together.

1272
01:17:19,619 --> 01:17:23,657
But a fight for their marriage
becomes a fight for their lives.

1273
01:17:23,724 --> 01:17:28,295
Nicholas Sparks
meets Jon Krakauer.

1274
01:17:28,363 --> 01:17:29,596
- You get me?
- Yeah.

1275
01:17:29,663 --> 01:17:31,432
Are you ready for the title?

1276
01:17:31,498 --> 01:17:33,633
Yes.

1277
01:17:35,102 --> 01:17:36,471
"Foreverest."

1278
01:17:36,536 --> 01:17:39,172
"Foreverest."
Wow.

1279
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,776
I'm sorry,
this is the hospital.

1280
01:17:42,843 --> 01:17:45,312
I'm just going to take this.

1281
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:47,382
Hello? Yes.

1282
01:17:47,448 --> 01:17:49,082
So sorry about that.

1283
01:17:49,149 --> 01:17:50,817
An emergency.

1284
01:17:52,953 --> 01:17:56,656
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you're saying.

1285
01:17:56,723 --> 01:17:58,558
What are you saying?

1286
01:17:58,625 --> 01:18:00,594
Heart disease.

1287
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,329
Lung cancer.

1288
01:18:02,397 --> 01:18:03,964
Cirrhosis of the liver.

1289
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:09,736
Okay, so is there
anything you can do?

1290
01:18:09,803 --> 01:18:11,805
I'm afraid there isn't.

1291
01:18:12,973 --> 01:18:14,107
I...

1292
01:18:15,476 --> 01:18:17,611
I don't understand
what that means.

1293
01:18:17,677 --> 01:18:19,414
What...

1294
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,148
What are we supposed
to do then?

1295
01:18:26,387 --> 01:18:27,754
We help him die.

1296
01:18:36,863 --> 01:18:38,598
Come on out.

1297
01:18:38,665 --> 01:18:40,501
Come on, Hemmy.
It's time to go.

1298
01:18:40,567 --> 01:18:42,135
Good boy.

1299
01:18:42,202 --> 01:18:43,371
This is crazy.

1300
01:18:43,438 --> 01:18:45,238
What about work?

1301
01:18:45,305 --> 01:18:46,807
Um, you know,

1302
01:18:46,873 --> 01:18:49,643
I can do my end
remotely.

1303
01:18:49,709 --> 01:18:52,746
And what about
Drew Davis?

1304
01:18:52,813 --> 01:18:55,282
Drew Davis can wait.

1305
01:18:55,349 --> 01:18:57,984
- What is that?
- He needs this. It's his bird.

1306
01:19:02,289 --> 01:19:05,359
Hey, handsome.
Looking for a ride?

1307
01:19:28,148 --> 01:19:31,051
So you're officially
a best seller now.

1308
01:19:32,487 --> 01:19:35,055
I should have set myself
on fire sooner.

1309
01:19:36,823 --> 01:19:38,191
You know, that would
have saved me

1310
01:19:38,258 --> 01:19:39,793
a lot of time and money.

1311
01:19:42,563 --> 01:19:44,532
If it makes you feel
any better,

1312
01:19:44,599 --> 01:19:48,201
some kids are actually burning
the book after they read it.

1313
01:19:53,106 --> 01:19:55,876
You don't have
to stick around, you know.

1314
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:02,749
Maybe I want
to stick around.

1315
01:20:06,521 --> 01:20:08,356
It won't be for long.

1316
01:20:47,694 --> 01:20:49,129
Welcome home.

1317
01:20:49,196 --> 01:20:51,865
What the hell
did you do?

1318
01:20:51,932 --> 01:20:53,434
Not much.

1319
01:20:53,501 --> 01:20:55,369
Just tidied up a little bit.

1320
01:20:56,903 --> 01:20:58,738
I'm going to go
get your stuff.

1321
01:20:58,805 --> 01:21:00,106
Okay.

1322
01:21:02,643 --> 01:21:04,579
Who put a collar on you?

1323
01:21:04,645 --> 01:21:05,912
Come here.

1324
01:21:05,979 --> 01:21:08,215
Come and be with me.

1325
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:09,450
Oh!

1326
01:21:09,517 --> 01:21:10,651
Hey.

1327
01:21:10,717 --> 01:21:11,952
Come around.

1328
01:21:12,018 --> 01:21:13,787
Oh, that's it.

1329
01:21:13,853 --> 01:21:15,222
Give me a kiss.

1330
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:16,990
Oh, I love you.

1331
01:21:17,057 --> 01:21:18,959
I love you so much.

1332
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,194
Are you comfortable?

1333
01:21:21,261 --> 01:21:23,331
Do you want more blankets
or pillows or...?

1334
01:21:23,397 --> 01:21:27,000
No, I'm comfortable
thank you very much.

1335
01:21:28,068 --> 01:21:29,736
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1336
01:22:34,568 --> 01:22:36,570
I read "Atomic Autumn."

1337
01:22:40,775 --> 01:22:42,075
And?

1338
01:22:42,142 --> 01:22:43,310
And...

1339
01:22:47,682 --> 01:22:49,049
I think it's...

1340
01:22:50,016 --> 01:22:52,018
really good.

1341
01:22:52,085 --> 01:22:55,055
And the ending,
I just...

1342
01:22:56,222 --> 01:22:59,893
trying to decide
between him and her freedom.

1343
01:23:00,994 --> 01:23:02,630
And then she leaves.

1344
01:23:02,697 --> 01:23:04,064
It's just...

1345
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:06,334
God, it's so gutsy, it's...

1346
01:23:07,967 --> 01:23:09,737
How did you...?

1347
01:23:09,804 --> 01:23:11,104
Why did you do that?

1348
01:23:11,171 --> 01:23:13,741
I wanted to write
a cautionary tale,

1349
01:23:13,808 --> 01:23:18,945
but my wife only believed
in bold choices.

1350
01:23:19,012 --> 01:23:22,282
There were no lies
in her fire.

1351
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:26,252
And you have that same fire,
don't you, love?

1352
01:23:27,588 --> 01:23:28,922
Hmm?

1353
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:31,625
- I do?
- Yeah.

1354
01:23:35,128 --> 01:23:37,598
I want to go out.

1355
01:23:37,665 --> 01:23:39,667
You want to go outside?

1356
01:23:39,734 --> 01:23:40,867
Yes.

1357
01:23:40,934 --> 01:23:42,936
Help me get dressed

1358
01:23:43,002 --> 01:23:44,904
and I'll tell you why.

1359
01:23:49,075 --> 01:23:52,912
This is where she used to come
to read.

1360
01:23:54,314 --> 01:23:55,949
What happened to her?

1361
01:23:57,083 --> 01:23:58,586
Uh, we...

1362
01:24:02,623 --> 01:24:04,425
...we lost the baby, and...

1363
01:24:08,261 --> 01:24:11,297
Elizabeth went
a week later.

1364
01:24:13,534 --> 01:24:17,003
I should have done this
years ago.

1365
01:24:21,908 --> 01:24:24,043
When I go...

1366
01:24:25,546 --> 01:24:27,415
spread me here.

1367
01:24:30,216 --> 01:24:32,085
It's where I belong.

1368
01:24:35,556 --> 01:24:38,057
Harris, do you want me
to call anyone?

1369
01:24:38,124 --> 01:24:40,326
Like a friend,
or family, or...?

1370
01:24:41,529 --> 01:24:44,998
No, the cat's got all the
names.

1371
01:24:50,003 --> 01:24:52,673
It's time that you do...

1372
01:25:46,059 --> 01:25:47,260
- Good day, ma'am.
- Hello.

1373
01:25:47,327 --> 01:25:49,730
Verne Olson.
Eastern Mutual.

1374
01:25:49,797 --> 01:25:53,767
Five hundred thousand dollars?
Really? How is that possible?

1375
01:25:55,469 --> 01:25:58,839
He took a line of credit out
against the house in 2005.

1376
01:25:58,906 --> 01:26:00,574
Right.

1377
01:26:00,641 --> 01:26:02,443
This book went
out of print.

1378
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:04,210
Pardon me?

1379
01:26:04,277 --> 01:26:06,079
Well, he doesn't have
this kind of money, so...

1380
01:26:06,145 --> 01:26:07,915
Harris Shaw?

1381
01:26:07,982 --> 01:26:09,550
I find that a little hard
to believe.

1382
01:26:09,617 --> 01:26:11,184
He's not going to get
a return on the book

1383
01:26:11,251 --> 01:26:12,620
for at least six months.

1384
01:26:12,686 --> 01:26:15,789
Well, surely you could
get him an advance, or...?

1385
01:26:15,856 --> 01:26:17,290
No. That's not...

1386
01:26:17,358 --> 01:26:19,426
Yeah, that's not how it works.

1387
01:26:20,861 --> 01:26:22,897
Um, Mr. Olson,

1388
01:26:22,963 --> 01:26:25,031
look, this house
is really special.

1389
01:26:25,098 --> 01:26:27,801
He's written
his life's work here.

1390
01:26:27,868 --> 01:26:31,070
His wife died here.

1391
01:26:31,137 --> 01:26:32,640
His...

1392
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:37,210
He wants to live out
his life here.

1393
01:26:37,277 --> 01:26:39,245
I mean, what are you going
to do, kick him out?

1394
01:26:39,312 --> 01:26:40,648
He's Harris-fucking-Shaw, okay?

1395
01:26:40,714 --> 01:26:42,950
This house should be deemed
historical.

1396
01:26:43,017 --> 01:26:45,619
It should be turned
into a museum or something.

1397
01:26:45,686 --> 01:26:46,987
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1398
01:26:47,053 --> 01:26:48,756
He pays back the $500,000,

1399
01:26:48,822 --> 01:26:51,458
or it'll hit the market
in two weeks.

1400
01:26:54,929 --> 01:26:58,064
The buggers just used to call
or send lettuce.

1401
01:27:01,435 --> 01:27:04,137
They tried to throw me
out of here.

1402
01:27:05,773 --> 01:27:07,206
Yeah.

1403
01:27:11,545 --> 01:27:13,447
I'm a best-selling author.

1404
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:21,355
Lucy...

1405
01:27:22,489 --> 01:27:24,858
they can't do that, right?

1406
01:27:24,925 --> 01:27:26,360
- No?
- No.

1407
01:27:26,427 --> 01:27:28,227
- Okay.
- No.

1408
01:27:37,871 --> 01:27:39,640
They can't do that.

1409
01:27:40,841 --> 01:27:42,376
Can they, Elizabeth?

1410
01:27:53,587 --> 01:27:56,222
Okay, Roxanol ever three
to six hours, remember?

1411
01:27:56,289 --> 01:27:58,124
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

1412
01:27:58,191 --> 01:28:00,193
- Depending on pain.
- Yes.

1413
01:28:02,997 --> 01:28:06,066
Lucy, you're finally
on your feet again.

1414
01:28:06,132 --> 01:28:08,134
You worked so hard.

1415
01:28:08,201 --> 01:28:10,771
Are you 100% positive?

1416
01:28:10,838 --> 01:28:12,006
I want to do this.

1417
01:28:12,072 --> 01:28:13,474
It's the right thing to do.

1418
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:16,209
Okay. Whatever you need.

1419
01:28:17,378 --> 01:28:19,312
I really appreciate this.
Thank you.

1420
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:20,714
You got it.

1421
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,267
Great. That's great.

1422
01:28:42,903 --> 01:28:45,039
So glad this worked out
in the end.

1423
01:28:45,105 --> 01:28:47,273
I really do think
it's for the best.

1424
01:28:47,341 --> 01:28:48,676
Don't you?

1425
01:28:53,981 --> 01:28:56,215
Yeah, you're doing
the right thing here, Luce.

1426
01:28:56,282 --> 01:28:58,085
It's going to keep
Joe's legacy alive.

1427
01:28:58,152 --> 01:28:59,853
You should feel good about it.

1428
01:29:04,825 --> 01:29:06,292
There you go.

1429
01:29:07,394 --> 01:29:08,729
Thank you.

1430
01:29:13,667 --> 01:29:15,469
So?

1431
01:29:15,536 --> 01:29:18,304
Well, you got
what you wanted, so...

1432
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:20,474
go.

1433
01:29:20,541 --> 01:29:22,208
Well, I mean,
to be fair,

1434
01:29:22,275 --> 01:29:25,612
I didn't get everything
I wanted, did I?

1435
01:29:26,914 --> 01:29:28,115
Oh, you didn't?

1436
01:29:28,182 --> 01:29:29,516
No.

1437
01:29:31,351 --> 01:29:32,786
Hmm.

1438
01:29:34,021 --> 01:29:35,321
Hmm.

1439
01:29:38,826 --> 01:29:39,760
Holy shit.

1440
01:29:39,827 --> 01:29:41,428
So sometimes,
this thing jams.

1441
01:29:41,495 --> 01:29:43,397
- But...
- Lucy.

1442
01:29:43,464 --> 01:29:45,599
...sometimes it works.
You want to find out?

1443
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:48,168
He's made you nuts,
hasn't he?

1444
01:29:48,234 --> 01:29:50,471
I know.

1445
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:56,844
No problem.

1446
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:59,079
Got a meeting with Drew Davis
in an hour.

1447
01:29:59,146 --> 01:30:00,313
Don't want to be late.

1448
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:01,782
Tell her I said hi.

1449
01:31:34,241 --> 01:31:36,877
<i>"He had come a long way
to this blue lawn,</i>

1450
01:31:36,944 --> 01:31:40,047
<i>"and his dream must have seemed
so close</i>

1451
01:31:40,113 --> 01:31:41,982
