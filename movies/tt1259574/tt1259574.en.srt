1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:14,283
A little girl goes missing.

3
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:17,078
The pack salivates.

4
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,747
If it bleeds,
it leads, right?

5
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,334
Eddie Dunford,
crime correspondent,

6
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,379
back home to take the North.

7
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,634
Business first.

8
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,427
Dad won't mind waiting.

9
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,688
Edward.

10
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:45,147
I'm sorry to hear about your father.

11
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:46,899
Oh, yeah, thank you very much,
Mr. Hadley.

12
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:48,901
He had a good innings, eh?

13
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:51,654
This is Detective Superintendent Jobson.

14
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,738
Oh, right.

15
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:54,198
Pleasure, sir.
Pleasure to meet you.

16
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:55,575
Mr. Dunford's hoping to be

17
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:57,243
the Post's new crime correspondent.

18
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:59,453
Oh, aye,
I always got on well with Jack Whitehead.

19
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,331
Good old Jack, eh?

20
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:04,500
He'll be standing in for a trial period.

21
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:06,252
That's right.

22
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:10,631
Pleasure to meet you...
and to work.

23
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,008
Is he a local lad?

24
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:14,719
Well, he cut his teeth
on our Yorkshire Post,

25
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:16,554
but he's been down south.

26
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,264
Young Turk, then, eh?

27
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,350
Made a pig's ear of it
from what I understand.

28
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:24,854
I'm giving him a month to prove himself.

29
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,731
So where's Whitehead?

30
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:28,190
- Jack?
- Yeah.

31
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:30,192
On the piss, probably.

32
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,402
Don't worry, son.

33
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:33,070
You've got your legs well under the table.

34
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:34,363
Just do the job.

35
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:35,573
I know,
I know.

36
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:37,366
Fuck him.
He's not getting in on this one.

37
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:38,868
Yeah, funeral is in two hours.

38
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:40,119
It's going to be tight.

39
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:41,370
I know.
We'll make it.

40
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,372
Aye-up, owl's on.

41
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:46,125
Gentlemen, we'll keep this brief.

42
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:50,713
At 4:00 p.m. yesterday evening,
3rd of September,

43
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,715
Clare Kemplay disappeared
on her way home

44
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:55,051
from Morley Grange Junior and Infants.

45
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:57,637
Clare is ten years old.

46
00:03:57,763 --> 00:04:00,598
She was wearing a red anorak,

47
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:03,893
gray school uniform,
and red Wellington boots.

48
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,229
Mrs. Kemplay now would like
to read a short statement.

49
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:08,230
Thank you.

50
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:10,024
- Poor cow.
- No, I know.

51
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,068
Yeah, do you reckon dad did it?

52
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:13,361
I would like to appeal

53
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,197
to anyone who knows where my Clare is,

54
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,741
or who saw her after yesterday teatime,

55
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:22,078
to please contact the police.

56
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:25,206
Clare is a very happy girl.

57
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,751
And I know she wouldn't just-

58
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:31,379
never just run off without telling me.

59
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:35,091
Please, if you know where she is...

60
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:38,678
Please, this is...

61
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:41,263
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:46,727
All right, lads,
that's your lot.

63
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:05,496
I'm sorry, Mum.
I'm really sorry.

64
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:08,457
I'm really,
really sorry I'm late.

65
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,626
"Business before pleasure,"
he always said.

66
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:12,128
She means Dad.

67
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:14,797
Remember Dad?

68
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,053
He were Yorkshire's finest tailor,
William was.

69
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:23,514
He was a good lad,
your dad.

70
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,141
You knew where you were with him.

71
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:26,559
Reliable.

72
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:28,853
Well, now,
Edward Dunford,

73
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,605
North of England crime correspondent.

74
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,315
"Mrs. Sandra Kemplay

75
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:35,276
made an emotional plea this morning... "

76
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,694
Did you write that, love?

77
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,779
Our new byline boy is Eddie.

78
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,948
You'll be wanting his autograph next.

79
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,658
He'll always be "Little Eddie" to me.

80
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:44,285
It's a step up, lad.

81
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,537
It's a pity your dad's not here to see it.

82
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:49,165
Hey, is that one of his?

83
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,041
This?
No.

84
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,710
This is a Lord John,
Carnaby Street.

85
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,962
Oh, aye.

86
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,423
It doesn't look good,
does it? This Kemplay lass.

87
00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:59,341
24 hours,
not a thing.

88
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:01,177
There's been a couple now,
aren't there?

89
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:02,636
Yeah, going back.

90
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,305
Wasn't there a little lass from Rochdale?

91
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,682
There were one not so
long ago in Castleford.

92
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:08,851
Yeah, Jeanette Garland.

93
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:10,144
Never found her neither.

94
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,854
No?
Didn't they?

95
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,522
Hear them wheels.

96
00:06:13,648 --> 00:06:16,066
They never caught no one.

97
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:19,361
Never do, though,
do they?

98
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:47,598
Aye-up, Chuck.

99
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:48,724
How are you?
You all right?

100
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,227
Good to see you.

101
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:53,979
The prodigal returns.

102
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:55,940
Eddie.

103
00:06:59,194 --> 00:07:01,278
Here to see the old man,
Miss Moneypenny.

104
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,530
Didn't cut it down south, then?

105
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,448
Funny.

106
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,075
So, sir,
if I could get your attention,

107
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,910
we have three missing girls.

108
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:11,455
They're all aged between eight and ten.

109
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:15,835
1969, 1972,
and then the day before yesterday.

110
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:19,129
And they all go missing within
miles of one another, sir.

111
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:22,216
This could be the A34
murders all over again.

112
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,176
Well, do let's hope so, eh,
Mr. Dunford?

113
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:26,387
Yeah, fingers crossed, eh?

114
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,098
I was being sarcastic, Edward.

115
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:31,559
Sorry.

116
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,769
Have you spoke to Jack
Whitehead about this?

117
00:07:33,895 --> 00:07:35,062
No.

118
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,606
No, this is-this is my story.

119
00:07:37,732 --> 00:07:39,775
Isn't it,
Mr. Hadley?

120
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:42,653
Spot the Ball.

121
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,030
It's the reason why 39%
of working-class males

122
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:47,199
buy this paper.

123
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:49,577
That's interesting.

124
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,537
You honestly think so?

125
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:55,791
What about- about working-class males?

126
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,711
Do you think it could be the same man?

127
00:07:58,837 --> 00:07:59,795
Yes, sir.

128
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:02,882
Yes, I do.

129
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:05,259
Right, I'll fix you up with a one-to-one.

130
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,511
First thing in the morning
with DCS Molloy.

131
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,805
Bill Molloy suspects itinerants.

132
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:11,682
Gypsies.

133
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:12,766
Oh, well...

134
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,185
Of course he does.

135
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:17,062
Now, don't push him, lad.

136
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:19,189
This paper enjoys a good relationship

137
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:21,025
with our newly
amalgamated police force.

138
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:22,818
And I, for one,
would like to keep it that way.

139
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:25,529
Of course, sir.
Of course.

140
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:27,156
Good.

141
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:29,658
You know, you really ought to
have a go at these, Edward.

142
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:30,951
They'd be right up your street.

143
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,286
Thank you, sir.
I will.

144
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:36,457
- Edward.
- Yep?

145
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:39,793
Don't cock it up, eh?

146
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:54,475
♪ You think you've got it all set up ♪

147
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,226
Yeah, unbelievable.

148
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:59,021
They hacked the fucking
swan's wings off.

149
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:00,064
Clean off.

150
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,857
Left the poor bastard lying there.

151
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:02,983
You're joking.

152
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,693
Yeah.
Still alive, apparently.

153
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,320
Some kids found it.

154
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,447
- Hey, Eddie.
- Yes, yes.

155
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:09,740
How did it go with Hadley?

156
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,075
Ah, he's not convinced.

157
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:12,701
Usual bollocks,
"Don't cause a fuss. "

158
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:14,411
Right.

159
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:16,038
One thing's for sure:

160
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:17,331
They're linked,
all right.

161
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,667
I know it.

162
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,418
Yeah, but linked how?

163
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:23,420
Everything's linked, Eddie.

164
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:26,966
Show me two things that aren't.

165
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:28,717
Stoke City and the fucking championship.

166
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:31,011
Hmm.
Come here.

167
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:38,811
Eddie, it's a conspiracy.

168
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:41,730
We've got MI5 keeping
an eye on our Harold,

169
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:43,899
Mountbatten waiting in the
wings with a military junta.

170
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:44,900
Bollocks.

171
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,777
There are death squads out there.

172
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:48,570
They give them a taste
in Northern Ireland,

173
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:49,738
bring them back home hungry.

174
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:50,823
Fuck off!
Death squads.

175
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:52,992
And every city has its death squads.

176
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:54,410
Sentence first,
evidence after.

177
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:56,120
All right, well,
I'll steer well clear

178
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:57,913
of Wakey County Council
death squad, then.

179
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:58,914
You can laugh.

180
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,416
I will.

181
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:02,751
Why not work Watergate in there, too,
while you're about it?

182
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:03,752
Death squads, Barry?

183
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:07,381
Come on,
you're losing it, mate.

184
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:12,845
- Oh, shit.
- What?

185
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:15,180
Oh, you're a lucky man, Dunford.

186
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:17,516
Mr. Gannon?

187
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:20,352
BJ, in there.

188
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:22,312
Are you all right, fella?

189
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:27,067
Fucking hell.

190
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,277
Business.

191
00:10:28,403 --> 00:10:31,071
I didn't think it were pleasure,
did I?

192
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:41,290
Having a nice time back up North?

193
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,167
Yeah, you know, Barry.

194
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:44,918
Gets a bit obtuse.

195
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,587
Obtuse?

196
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,131
There's a big word for you.

197
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:51,842
Oh.
How about you?

198
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:53,302
How about me what?

199
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:58,182
Are you having a good time?

200
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,142
Oh, I love being on me own in bars.

201
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:01,894
Oh, no, you weren't.
You weren't alone.

202
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,897
You could have come over.

203
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:07,649
Well, I wasn't invited.

204
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:11,111
Oh, poor baby.

205
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:17,159
Oh, I love you.

206
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,994
I love you, Eddie.

207
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,664
♪ Who had love that's now departed?
♪

208
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,084
♪ I know I've got to find ♪

209
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,461
♪ Some kind of peace of mind ♪

210
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:42,643
I've missed you, Eddie, love.

211
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,081
Eddie.

212
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,584
It's for him.

213
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,010
Yeah?

214
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:20,973
Dunford, I thought you
were a fucking journalist.

215
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:23,934
Well, you best start asking questions.

216
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,477
Who is this?

217
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,646
You don't need to know.

218
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:31,024
Are you interested in the Romany way?

219
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,818
White vans and gypos.

220
00:12:32,944 --> 00:12:34,653
Where?

221
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,447
Hunslet Beeston exit off the M1.

222
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:38,907
When?

223
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:42,911
Mischief night came early,
and you're late.

224
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:59,488
Someone had torched
the whole fucking place.

225
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:01,698
It was-it was like Vietnam or something.

226
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:04,493
Well, Bill Molloy's got it in
for the gypsies, hasn't he?

227
00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:07,246
You reckon it was the police?

228
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:08,372
Their style.

229
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:13,418
That land's earmarked.

230
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:16,463
New John Dawson development.

231
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,343
Here, don't be late, mate.

232
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:24,513
The Badger doesn't like newspapermen.

233
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,723
Into the lion's den you go.

234
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,186
Come on, then, son.

235
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:32,854
Surprise me.

236
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:35,607
Well, Mr. Molloy, sir,
I was just wondering

237
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,360
if there were any more
news on Clare Kemplay?

238
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:39,361
Nothing.

239
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:40,862
Sweet fuck all.

240
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:42,823
That poor lass is dead, son.

241
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:46,827
And Jeanette Garland,
Susan Ridyard?

242
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,664
There are some similarities there, eh?

243
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,751
I'm thinking about the A34 murders,
Cannock Chase.

244
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:56,712
What the fuck do you know
about Cannock Chase?

245
00:14:56,838 --> 00:14:59,006
Just that it turned out

246
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,008
it was the work of one man,
wasn't it?

247
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,719
And here we have Jeanette Garland,
Susan Ridyard,

248
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:05,220
Clare Kemplay- they all go missing.

249
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:07,347
You're not the first one
to put that together, son.

250
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,682
You vain little twat.

251
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,976
My senile bloody auntie could.

252
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:13,520
You haven't got a story, son.

253
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,647
Best we find her body,
and quick.

254
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:17,399
Check the bins.

255
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:20,527
See who's got themselves
an early awayday.

256
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,237
All right.

257
00:15:22,363 --> 00:15:26,033
Pull in local gypos and paddies.

258
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,121
Have we met before, son?

259
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:32,914
No.

260
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,041
No, I don't think so.

261
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,209
Good.

262
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,919
You do your digging,
and I'll do mine.

263
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:39,254
Now fuck off.

264
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:43,592
Sir.

265
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,352
Fucking plods.

266
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:56,646
Breaking news...

267
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:10,952
Reporter, are you?

268
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:12,079
That obvious,
is it?

269
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,247
We've seen a few around here.

270
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,041
Ridyards aren't in, love.

271
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:17,292
Oh, right.

272
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:18,794
Well, do you know when they'll be back?

273
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,337
Gone away for a few days.

274
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:21,755
Can't blame them.

275
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,256
Brings it all back.

276
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,926
And what with them finding that
new one over in Fitzwilliam.

277
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:27,844
Sorry, what?

278
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,012
Clare Kemplay.

279
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,013
They found her.

280
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,139
Just on the news.

281
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:33,767
Dumped on a building site.

282
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:39,856
Eddie.

283
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:41,483
Aw, thanks for letting me know, love.

284
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,276
Oh, fuck you, Eddie.

285
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,238
Oh, Jack Whitehead,
the crime reporter of the year.

286
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:47,531
Fancy you being here.

287
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:49,366
Oh, glad you could join us, Scoop.

288
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:52,494
Boss wants to see you, ASAP.

289
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,081
Early bird and all that.

290
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:58,166
Is it true you like it up
trap two from Jack?

291
00:16:58,292 --> 00:16:59,793
You're the one who's fucked, Scoop.

292
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,003
You couldn't be reached,
so I sent for Jack.

293
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,463
So I'm off the story?

294
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,048
Not at all,
not at all, no.

295
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:06,800
Just sit down a minute, Edward.

296
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,844
Edward, park your ass.

297
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,303
I want a word.

298
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,847
Look, I've got a couple of other things

299
00:17:11,973 --> 00:17:14,015
I want you to follow up for me,
all right, a favor.

300
00:17:14,142 --> 00:17:15,058
Wha-what?
What favor?

301
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:16,518
I want you to go to Shangri-la.

302
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:17,644
What?

303
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,646
Shangri-la.

304
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,356
It was a silver wedding
present apparently,

305
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:24,609
her favorite film.

306
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,944
What are you on about?

307
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,487
Dawson Place.

308
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,532
John Dawson,
the construction magnate.

309
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:31,700
Right.

310
00:17:31,826 --> 00:17:35,495
Barry's got a theory:
local corruption.

311
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,080
Barry reckons that Marjorie Dawson

312
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:39,875
will corroborate all the stuff
we've dug up on her husband.

313
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:43,545
Now, look,
Marjorie Dawson is not a well woman.

314
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:46,089
It is ethically dubious to bother her.

315
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:47,799
So I want you to go with Barry

316
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:50,385
and make sure he doesn't
go off at the deep end.

317
00:17:50,511 --> 00:17:52,679
All right,
so what about Clare Kemplay?

318
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,182
We'll let Jack handle it
for the most part, eh?

319
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,725
You can do the background.

320
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,143
Who found her?

321
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:04,608
A builder's mate,
a lad from Fitzwilliam.

322
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:08,403
Now, Edward,
I'm asking you to drop it.

323
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:10,572
All right.

324
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:12,032
Good.

325
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:15,827
So you'll stay away
from Fitzwilliam, then?

326
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,738
Hiya.
Mrs. Cole?

327
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,739
Edward Dunford.

328
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,616
I'm from the Yorkshire Post.

329
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:55,784
To see our Leonard,
isn't it?

330
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,785
Yeah, that's right.

331
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:58,286
Just a quick chat.

332
00:18:58,412 --> 00:18:59,663
He's had enough with police.

333
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,164
He don't need to keep going over it.

334
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,707
Mary, Mary,
it's okay.

335
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,126
It's all right.

336
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:06,461
Hi.

337
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:07,462
Sorry.
I'm Martin Laws.

338
00:19:07,588 --> 00:19:08,672
Pleasure.
Edward Dunford.

339
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:09,798
Sorry about my hands.

340
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:11,258
I've been working on the allotment.

341
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,592
Sorry about that.
- Not a problem.

342
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,302
I'm just here for a quick
chat with Leonard,

343
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:15,303
if that's all right?

344
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:16,930
I don't want to bother you.

345
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:22,143
Put the comic away, Leonard.

346
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,354
All right, Leonard?

347
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,981
I'm Edward Dunford.

348
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:27,649
I'm a journalist for the Yorkshire Post.

349
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,734
I just want to ask you a couple
of questions, you know.

350
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,902
Naught to worry about at all.

351
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:32,362
They thought he'd done it,
you know?

352
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:33,405
Shut up, Mum.

353
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:34,781
Hey, you.

354
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,952
The police realized it was a mistake.

355
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:44,457
So why did they think
you'd done it, Leonard?

356
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:47,043
Ask them.

357
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:48,378
He's a good boy,
Mr. Dunford.

358
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:50,589
He didn't do nothing.

359
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:52,007
No, I don't...

360
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,800
I can see that.

361
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,719
You might as well get some
brass out of it, Leonard,

362
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:57,053
and tell us what happened.

363
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,055
It's not about the money,
Mr. Dunford.

364
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:00,849
It's the truth that matters.

365
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:06,855
Leonard will show you the place.

366
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:08,815
She were a lovely little thing.

367
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,131
We were waiting for the gaffer,

368
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:34,382
but he never come.

369
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:35,550
Right.

370
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:38,219
And it were raining, so...

371
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:39,721
we were just arsing about,
you know?

372
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,431
Yeah.

373
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:43,892
I went over to have a wazz, like.

374
00:20:47,355 --> 00:20:50,065
And that's when I saw her.

375
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:51,900
Down there?

376
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:54,694
She were lying there.

377
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:58,239
She had...

378
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:00,909
She had wings.

379
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:02,452
What?

380
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:04,579
Oh, fuck!

381
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,002
I couldn't believe it were her.

382
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,475
On the day she went missing,

383
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:28,770
Clare was wearing a red cagoule
and red Wellington boots.

384
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:31,272
When Clare left Morley Grange
Junior and Infants School,

385
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:33,900
she was seen by
witnesses heading south...

386
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:53,628
You hard at it, Jackie?

387
00:21:53,754 --> 00:21:56,047
Hello, Scoop.

388
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:58,967
Just had a chat with Leonard Cole.

389
00:21:59,093 --> 00:22:01,469
You naughty boy.

390
00:22:01,595 --> 00:22:05,515
Didn't Auntie Hadley say you had
to go home for an early bath?

391
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:10,103
Heard you were over at
Clare Kemplay's postmortem.

392
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,563
The police are

393
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:15,275
withholding exact details.

394
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:19,571
Haven't you got a family to go home to?

395
00:22:23,451 --> 00:22:25,034
You keep following me like this,

396
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:27,996
your friend Barry's going
to get very jealous.

397
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:31,124
Did you get a look at it?

398
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,584
Your friend

399
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,169
or the postmortem?

400
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:37,589
Yeah, I saw it.

401
00:22:37,715 --> 00:22:39,841
- And?
- And?

402
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:42,343
And that little girl

403
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,889
was tortured, raped,
and strangled

404
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:47,849
in that order.

405
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,851
Right.

406
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:51,519
I want all the details.

407
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:52,854
No, you don't, Scoop.

408
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,105
Jack.

409
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:55,982
Jack, don't fuck around.

410
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,359
Hey, whatever happened
to all those novels

411
00:22:58,486 --> 00:22:59,569
that you wanted to write,

412
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:02,363
but you were too scared
shitless to even try?

413
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,364
All right, mate.

414
00:23:03,491 --> 00:23:05,867
All right.

415
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:07,368
You fucking tell me.

416
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:08,745
Eddie.

417
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:13,875
Eddie, I am pissing on my
trouser leg and yours too.

418
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:16,377
You are fucking pathetic.

419
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:18,338
Just a hack.

420
00:23:22,092 --> 00:23:24,928
Such insight.

421
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:27,722
♪ The yellow jester does not play ♪

422
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:30,934
♪ But gently pulls the strings ♪

423
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,770
♪ He smiles as the puppets dance ♪

424
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:36,564
♪ In the court of the crimson king ♪

425
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:40,401
A man left this for you, love.

426
00:23:40,528 --> 00:23:41,694
Nice man.

427
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,530
Said he were a friend of yours.

428
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:47,075
Jack somebody or other.

429
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:51,037
Mum, I'm working.

430
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,026
"Presence of coal dust... "

431
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:38,543
Ligature marks.

432
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,804
Tears and bruising.

433
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,890
Swan's wings stitched into her back.

434
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,020
Stitched into her back.

435
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:10,617
"4 luv.
"

436
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,619
Carved into her skin.

437
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:16,456
Carved into her skin.

438
00:25:32,556 --> 00:25:35,600
Here we are,
at Shangri-la.

439
00:25:40,314 --> 00:25:43,358
All great buildings resemble crimes,
they say.

440
00:25:43,484 --> 00:25:44,609
Oh, yeah?

441
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:52,241
Right.

442
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:54,202
Oh, fuck Hadley.

443
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:56,412
I'm going to go and talk to
Jeanette Garland's family.

444
00:25:56,538 --> 00:25:58,081
You still you think there's a connection

445
00:25:58,207 --> 00:25:59,874
to Clare Kemplay and
t' other missing girls?

446
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,376
Absolutely, yeah.

447
00:26:01,502 --> 00:26:03,127
Good lad.

448
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:05,421
And, uh,
don't go off the deep end, Barry.

449
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:15,056
New Labour government,
what is being seen

450
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:17,016
as a resounding victory for the miners.

451
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:20,895
Around 260,000 miners have
accepted weekly pay rises

452
00:26:21,021 --> 00:26:23,523
ranging from six pounds to...

453
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,387
Hiya.

454
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,014
Are you Mrs. Paula Garland?

455
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,765
Yeah.

456
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:59,892
Hi.

457
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,019
I'm Edward Dunford.

458
00:27:01,145 --> 00:27:02,937
I'm from the Yorkshire Post.

459
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:06,232
I just wanted a quick chat about Jeanette.

460
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:11,612
Sure?

461
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:14,407
Thank you.

462
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,369
Mr. Garland about, or...

463
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,498
No.

464
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:24,417
What is it that you want, Mister-

465
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,169
Mr. Dunford?

466
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:29,130
Um, well...

467
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:33,634
I'm doing this article,
and it's about the...

468
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:35,970
about parents of children
who have gone missing.

469
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:40,641
It's about how people like yourself,

470
00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:43,061
like your husband,
have coped

471
00:27:43,187 --> 00:27:46,898
after all the fuss has died down.

472
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:51,027
It must be a very difficult time for you,
bring it all back.

473
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:52,361
I understand that.

474
00:27:52,488 --> 00:27:54,155
I know how you must have felt.

475
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:56,574
No, you have no idea how I feel.

476
00:27:58,452 --> 00:27:59,827
No.

477
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:05,500
I mean, one of the things,
for example...

478
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:07,376
do you feel

479
00:28:07,503 --> 00:28:10,338
that the police could
have done anything more

480
00:28:10,464 --> 00:28:11,422
to have helped you?

481
00:28:11,548 --> 00:28:12,548
Yeah, there was one thing.

482
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:14,133
Right.
What was that?

483
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,094
They could have found my daughter.

484
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:20,264
Yeah.

485
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,557
You come into my house

486
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:23,184
like you're discussing the weather

487
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,311
or some war

488
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,479
in another fucking country.

489
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:29,065
You know,
this thing happened to me.

490
00:28:31,568 --> 00:28:34,779
Can you get out, please?

491
00:28:34,905 --> 00:28:36,739
Just get out!

492
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,121
He killed himself.

493
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:46,207
What?

494
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,334
Her husband's dead?

495
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,629
Never got over Jeanette.

496
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:53,381
Sucked on a shotgun a year back.

497
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:57,218
Oh... shit.

498
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:59,887
You're supposed to know
these things, Dunford.

499
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:01,055
It didn't exactly make

500
00:29:01,181 --> 00:29:02,682
the front page down south,
did it?

501
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:03,683
Well, it did here.

502
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,059
You should have fucking known.

503
00:29:05,185 --> 00:29:06,519
Do your job.

504
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:10,314
Time, gentlemen, please.

505
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:12,942
How about you?

506
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:15,403
How was,
um- how was Shangri-la?

507
00:29:23,704 --> 00:29:26,122
Mrs. Dawson told me my life's in danger.

508
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:31,460
Bollocks.

509
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:38,759
Look, Barry, if you believe it,
you've got to tell someone.

510
00:29:38,886 --> 00:29:40,261
Oh, yeah, who?
The law?

511
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:41,345
Fuck that.

512
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:44,348
These people are the law.

513
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:47,059
Eddie.
- Yeah?

514
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:48,895
That gypsy camp,
Hunslet Carr.

515
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,938
- Yeah?
- Take a closer look.

516
00:29:51,064 --> 00:29:54,108
Dawson set up a ?00
million property trust.

517
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:56,777
100 million.

518
00:29:56,904 --> 00:30:00,531
It would be interesting to know
who else is on that board.

519
00:30:00,657 --> 00:30:03,201
There are death squads out there, eh?

520
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:04,452
You're ignorant, Dunford.

521
00:30:04,578 --> 00:30:05,661
Try carrying a history book

522
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:07,330
along with that notepad of yours.

523
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,834
Want a lift or what?

524
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,170
I'm going t' other way.

525
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:19,550
Piss head!

526
00:30:19,676 --> 00:30:22,887
Never had the urge to
deliver us from evil, then?

527
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,641
No, never.

528
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:31,979
The devil triumphs when
good men do naught.

529
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:09,183
What are you doing here, lad?

530
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:11,352
Just been for a pint.
What about you?

531
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:14,438
Fuck off.

532
00:31:14,564 --> 00:31:16,482
It's all right;
I'm over 18-

533
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,192
Shut up,
you little poof!

534
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,409
I didn't do anything!
What do you want?

535
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:27,827
I'll tell you what we don't want.

536
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:30,871
We don't want tits like
you bothering people

537
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:32,081
we don't want bothering.

538
00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:36,043
Yeah.
Not very nice, is it?

539
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:38,087
Is it?

540
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:39,714
Fuck!

541
00:32:36,897 --> 00:32:38,731
All right, Mrs. Garland?

542
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,652
It seems like a nice local.

543
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:45,863
Yeah, yeah.
It used to be.

544
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,369
You mind if I have a seat for a sec?

545
00:32:52,496 --> 00:32:55,373
One of them for me?

546
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,890
Come here often?

547
00:33:13,016 --> 00:33:16,519
It sounds like you're trying to pick me up,
Mr. Dunford.

548
00:33:19,689 --> 00:33:20,856
I hope your friends in the force

549
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:22,358
don't see us here together.

550
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:24,026
What?

551
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:28,614
What are you talking about?

552
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,615
It's all right.

553
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,117
I got the message.

554
00:33:33,703 --> 00:33:34,703
You didn't have to do that.

555
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,081
You didn't have to go to the police.

556
00:33:37,207 --> 00:33:39,250
Well, I never-I never said
anything to the police.

557
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:40,418
- No?
- No.

558
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:41,919
- Who'd you tell, then?
- No one.

559
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:43,629
Look, Mrs. Garland...

560
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,630
Paula.

561
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,340
It's Paula.

562
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:50,344
Paula, I'm very,
very sorry...

563
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,721
about earlier.

564
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,685
It's all right.
You were doing your job.

565
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:03,190
Might help find my little girl.

566
00:34:03,316 --> 00:34:06,485
Yeah, but still,
I was right out of order.

567
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,279
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

568
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,326
I didn't know about your husband.

569
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:16,287
Right.

570
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:18,372
Well...

571
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:22,001
the ring always felt a bit loose,
to be honest.

572
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:28,174
And there,
that was a stupid thing to say.

573
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:35,681
Do you want another drink?

574
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:46,567
Just another drink,
that's all.

575
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:49,236
That's a bad idea.

576
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:02,828
Eddie?

577
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,413
It's for you.

578
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:06,874
About Barry.

579
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:17,509
Come on!

580
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:19,219
Come on!
Come on!

581
00:37:34,778 --> 00:37:35,903
His brakes went.

582
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:38,113
Straight into the back of a van, bang.

583
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,032
A pane of glass sliced through,
scalped him.

584
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:43,994
Took the top of his
fucking head clean off.

585
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,746
Are they sure it's him?

586
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:47,873
Barry's dead, mate.

587
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,042
Yeah, and in fucking Morley too.

588
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:52,836
Dead drunk is what I heard.

589
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,091
Yeah, you'd know,
wouldn't you, Jack?

590
00:37:57,217 --> 00:38:01,261
Oh, mea culpa.

591
00:38:01,388 --> 00:38:03,055
But it wasn't me getting
the dear departed

592
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,390
pissed up,
was it?

593
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:11,188
Come on, lads.
Press conference.

594
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:25,786
Are you sure you've got
the stomach for it, Scoop?

595
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:28,789
What, just like you, Jack?

596
00:38:28,915 --> 00:38:30,833
Oh, no.

597
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:34,294
No, you're the man.

598
00:38:34,421 --> 00:38:37,589
Jack Whitehead's away
from his desk just now.

599
00:39:04,284 --> 00:39:06,618
Sergeant Bob Fraser.

600
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:07,828
Thanks for coming,
Mr. Dunford.

601
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:08,829
Yeah.

602
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:10,956
I know you were friends.

603
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,584
Mm, yeah.

604
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:17,504
So the van was carrying plates of glass?

605
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,672
Yes.

606
00:39:18,798 --> 00:39:20,466
And one of them went
through his windscreen?

607
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,593
Yes.

608
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:26,972
So you reckon it were instantaneous?

609
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,307
I'd say so, sir. Yes.

610
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:30,434
Yeah.

611
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:33,771
Fuck.

612
00:39:33,897 --> 00:39:36,690
Yeah.

613
00:39:36,816 --> 00:39:39,359
I understand you last saw Mr. Gannon

614
00:39:39,486 --> 00:39:42,154
in the Shakespeare Public House.

615
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,198
Would you say that he
was drinking heavily?

616
00:39:44,324 --> 00:39:46,033
No.

617
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,367
No.

618
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:49,328
And you've no idea where
he went from there?

619
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:52,164
Mm-mm.

620
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,500
No idea why he might
have come to Morley?

621
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,335
No, none.

622
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:57,961
I see.

623
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,674
We almost have all the details, sir.

624
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:07,221
There will be an inquest tomorrow.

625
00:40:07,347 --> 00:40:08,555
That's a bit quick,
isn't it?

626
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:11,391
I think the family are keen to,

627
00:40:11,518 --> 00:40:14,311
you know,
get it all sorted.

628
00:40:20,527 --> 00:40:22,110
If anything occurs to you,
I can be reached

629
00:40:22,237 --> 00:40:23,779
through the Morley police station.

630
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:28,951
You're one of the good ones,
aren't you, Sergeant?

631
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,789
I do my best, sir.

632
00:40:33,915 --> 00:40:35,666
Not good copy,
is it?

633
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:36,708
No.

634
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:41,547
No.

635
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:20,377
"We live in an age of great
investigative journalism.

636
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,298
"Barry Gannon was one of the
men who gave us that age.

637
00:41:24,424 --> 00:41:27,801
"Where he saw injustice,
he asked for justice.

638
00:41:27,927 --> 00:41:30,470
"Where he saw lies,
he asked for the truth.

639
00:41:30,597 --> 00:41:31,680
"Barry Gannon once said,

640
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:34,808
"'The truth can only make us richer.
'

641
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:37,269
"For those of us who seek the truth,

642
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:42,566
Barry Gannon's passing
can only make us poorer. "

643
00:41:42,692 --> 00:41:46,403
Not overly panegyric,
is it?

644
00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:48,530
Panegyric?

645
00:41:48,656 --> 00:41:50,240
No, I don't think so.

646
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:52,242
Here.

647
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:59,041
Do we really need this?

648
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,542
Interesting story.

649
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:02,920
Been a spate of animal mutilations,

650
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:06,715
hacked-about swans found
over on Bretton Park.

651
00:42:06,841 --> 00:42:09,176
I'm not stupid, lad.

652
00:42:09,302 --> 00:42:10,928
Jack showed me the postmortem.

653
00:42:11,054 --> 00:42:14,431
Right, well,
it's background, isn't it?

654
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:18,352
We'll get some police quotes.

655
00:42:18,478 --> 00:42:19,645
Maybe we'll run it on Thursday.

656
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,188
Thank you very much, sir.

657
00:42:21,314 --> 00:42:24,066
No mention of Clare Kemplay, mind.

658
00:42:24,192 --> 00:42:26,318
Just straightforward animal abuse,

659
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:28,028
like those pit ponies.

660
00:42:28,154 --> 00:42:29,529
All right.
Yeah, no problem.

661
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:32,032
And try and pull back on
the more visceral details.

662
00:42:32,158 --> 00:42:33,951
You don't want that with your cornflakes,
do you?

663
00:42:34,077 --> 00:42:35,160
No.

664
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,912
Absolutely, Mr. Hadley.
Thank you.

665
00:42:37,038 --> 00:42:38,288
- Edward.
- Yes?

666
00:42:38,414 --> 00:42:39,790
You're trying too hard.

667
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:42,334
You're just like Barry.

668
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,379
Do you know we could be
sued because of Barry?

669
00:42:45,505 --> 00:42:48,674
Mrs. Dawson's recovering up
at Hartley's after his visit.

670
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,050
Hartley's loony bin?

671
00:42:50,176 --> 00:42:52,010
Nursing home.

672
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,303
Sorry.

673
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:56,306
Sorry to,
uh- to hear that, sir.

674
00:42:56,432 --> 00:42:57,849
Take care,
won't you, lad?

675
00:42:57,976 --> 00:42:59,643
Yeah.

676
00:43:08,861 --> 00:43:13,323
I'm just here to see my Auntie Marjorie.

677
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:15,200
Marjorie Dawson.
Sorry.

678
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:18,203
We had to give her
something for her nerves.

679
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:21,164
She was in a right state
when they brought her back.

680
00:43:27,088 --> 00:43:31,383
Mrs. Dawson,
you have a visitor.

681
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:35,387
It's Eric, Mrs.
Dawson, your nephew.

682
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:37,889
It sometimes takes her
a while to come round.

683
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:39,474
I know.
I understand.

684
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,226
Oh, thank you.

685
00:44:01,497 --> 00:44:03,749
It's locked.

686
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,712
Who are you?

687
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:10,547
I'm Edward Dunford.

688
00:44:10,673 --> 00:44:12,674
I'm a journalist.

689
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,635
So you've been telling lies?

690
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,014
It's the privilege of the profession.

691
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:39,159
I just want to ask you

692
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:41,870
a couple of questions, Mrs. Dawson.

693
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:45,165
I can't help you,
Mr. Dunford.

694
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:47,459
I don't know.

695
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:50,837
I think maybe you can.

696
00:44:50,963 --> 00:44:52,756
See, um...

697
00:44:52,882 --> 00:44:56,259
See, you told my friend
Barry Gannon that-

698
00:44:56,385 --> 00:44:58,637
that his life was in danger,

699
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:01,681
and he was killed last night.

700
00:45:01,808 --> 00:45:04,810
How terrible.

701
00:45:06,312 --> 00:45:09,689
You didn't know that,
did you?

702
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:12,442
Who knows what I'm supposed
to know these days?

703
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:17,280
See, I just can't figure it out.

704
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:22,119
Why-why would you tell my
friend that he was in danger?

705
00:45:24,914 --> 00:45:27,791
He always used to be so careful.

706
00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:30,544
Who?
Your husband?

707
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:37,134
You smell so strongly.

708
00:45:38,678 --> 00:45:41,596
I'm sorry.

709
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:44,266
You smell of death.

710
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,942
Look, Mrs. Dawson.

711
00:45:54,068 --> 00:45:55,485
Don't touch me!

712
00:45:55,611 --> 00:45:57,445
Hey, it's all right.
I'm not gonna-

713
00:45:57,572 --> 00:45:59,281
Please, don't!

714
00:45:59,407 --> 00:46:01,158
I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not.

715
00:46:01,284 --> 00:46:02,450
Shh.
It's okay.

716
00:46:02,577 --> 00:46:03,493
It's all right.

717
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:04,619
It's all right!

718
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,040
Tell them about the others.

719
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,625
- What?
- The others.

720
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:12,586
What others?
What are you talking about?

721
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,755
Please tell them where they are.

722
00:46:15,882 --> 00:46:18,216
Will you tell me what
you're talking about?

723
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:19,968
Hello.
You must be going.

724
00:46:20,094 --> 00:46:22,554
Lying bastard!

725
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:24,514
Get up!

726
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,016
All right.
All right!

I found you by the car.

733
00:48:47,283 --> 00:48:49,492
You were covered in blood.

734
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:58,293
What time is it?

735
00:48:58,419 --> 00:49:01,379
Just gone 6:00, love.

736
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:18,271
Okay.

737
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:20,690
What are you doing?

738
00:49:20,816 --> 00:49:21,733
Mum.

739
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:22,734
Don't be daft.

740
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:23,777
You're not fit.

741
00:49:23,903 --> 00:49:25,737
This is my work, right?

742
00:49:26,947 --> 00:49:28,156
Don't do this to me.

743
00:49:30,785 --> 00:49:33,203
Mum, Mum, Mum, Mum, Mum.

744
00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:37,290
He really loved you,
your dad.

745
00:49:39,668 --> 00:49:42,170
He had a funny way of showing it.

746
00:49:42,296 --> 00:49:46,633
Upset Mum again,
and you're out on your ear.

747
00:49:46,759 --> 00:49:49,052
You never did one good thing, you.

748
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,774
Mum, I've got to go.

749
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,942
Okay?

750
00:50:08,614 --> 00:50:10,615
It's not safe.

751
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:57,787
Hi there.

752
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:07,547
Dad?

753
00:51:37,453 --> 00:51:39,621
Sit down, then.

754
00:51:43,042 --> 00:51:45,001
Here you go.

755
00:51:45,127 --> 00:51:47,462
Thank you.

756
00:51:47,588 --> 00:51:50,256
So what happened to your hand?

757
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,800
It was the same two coppers

758
00:51:52,927 --> 00:51:54,302
that warned me off last time I was here.

759
00:51:54,428 --> 00:51:55,386
Look, I told you before.

760
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:57,847
I never said anything to the police.

761
00:51:57,973 --> 00:52:01,476
Paula, please.

762
00:52:02,603 --> 00:52:05,647
Come on.
I need to know.

763
00:52:07,942 --> 00:52:09,943
Paula, please tell me.

764
00:52:13,113 --> 00:52:15,532
Right.

765
00:52:15,658 --> 00:52:18,910
I was upset after you went so...

766
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:21,037
so John came over.

767
00:52:22,665 --> 00:52:24,666
Who's John?

768
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:27,126
John Dawson.

769
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:38,221
So what did you tell him?

770
00:52:38,347 --> 00:52:40,348
I told him some fucking
journalist had been round

771
00:52:40,474 --> 00:52:41,474
asking questions.

772
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,851
You pissed me off.

773
00:52:43,978 --> 00:52:45,853
Well, there you go, then.

774
00:52:50,484 --> 00:52:52,902
Why didn't you tell me about Dawson?

775
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:59,284
He was very kind to us
when Jeanette went missing.

776
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,744
Substandard housing,
dodgy property trusts,

777
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:03,830
backhanders to the local council.

778
00:53:03,956 --> 00:53:05,373
He's been very good to me.

779
00:53:05,499 --> 00:53:06,583
Oh, yeah?
I bet he has.

780
00:53:06,709 --> 00:53:08,084
Oh, what is that supposed to mean?

781
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:09,794
Do you think he'd do something like this?

782
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,837
- No.
- No?

783
00:53:10,963 --> 00:53:12,088
No.
Why would he?

784
00:53:12,214 --> 00:53:13,798
I don't know.
Maybe because of what I know.

785
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:17,552
Huh, and what do you know, Eddie?

786
00:53:17,678 --> 00:53:19,012
I know that Clare Kemplay was found

787
00:53:19,138 --> 00:53:20,555
on a Dawson construction site.

788
00:53:23,642 --> 00:53:24,934
You're talking nonsense.

789
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,186
And I know all the Dawsons
in this world care about

790
00:53:27,313 --> 00:53:29,230
are their lies and their money.

791
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:30,481
Look, you don't know anything.

792
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:33,276
You're j-just a-a boy.

793
00:53:37,197 --> 00:53:40,658
And I know that there is
some bastard out there

794
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:43,286
who is taking, raping,
murdering little girls

795
00:53:43,412 --> 00:53:44,704
and nobody's going to stop him

796
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,289
because no one really fucking cares.

797
00:53:46,415 --> 00:53:48,499
What, and you do?

798
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,460
Yeah, maybe I do.

799
00:54:04,391 --> 00:54:05,516
Thank you.

800
00:55:56,962 --> 00:55:59,672
Okay, here we are.

801
00:55:59,798 --> 00:56:05,636
Two little dickey birds, yeah,
sitting on the wall,

802
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:09,474
one called Peter,

803
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,186
one called Paul.

804
00:56:14,855 --> 00:56:18,566
Fly away, Peter.

805
00:56:18,692 --> 00:56:20,026
Fly away, Paul.

806
00:56:29,703 --> 00:56:34,207
You know,
when she was just a baby, I...

807
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:39,587
I used to lie awake at night

808
00:56:39,713 --> 00:56:46,552
and-and wonder what I'd do
if anything happened to her.

809
00:56:46,678 --> 00:56:50,264
And I-and I'd run to her room,
and I'd-

810
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,601
and I'd wake her up and...

811
00:56:53,727 --> 00:56:58,940
I'd hug her and hug her and hug her.

812
00:56:59,066 --> 00:57:01,776
And...

813
00:57:01,902 --> 00:57:06,155
And when she never came home,

814
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:09,909
all those terrible,
terrible things had come true.

815
00:57:23,423 --> 00:57:24,924
Come here.

816
00:57:26,093 --> 00:57:27,677
I've got you.

817
00:57:30,472 --> 00:57:32,473
I've got you.

818
00:57:53,328 --> 00:57:55,872
Good piece by Hadley,
wasn't it?

819
00:57:55,998 --> 00:57:57,790
A bit on the panegyric side,
I thought.

820
00:57:57,916 --> 00:58:00,668
Aye, I suppose.

821
00:58:00,794 --> 00:58:03,337
Barry would have appreciated it.

822
00:58:03,463 --> 00:58:05,131
Doubt it.

823
00:58:10,095 --> 00:58:13,556
Come for a spin in the Jensen,
Mr. Dunford?

824
00:58:17,019 --> 00:58:19,353
Why would I want to do that?

825
00:58:21,356 --> 00:58:25,443
I was a great admirer
of your late colleague.

826
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,570
Such a waste.

827
00:58:30,908 --> 00:58:33,284
John Dawson.

828
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:36,245
Fuck the press club wake, eh?

829
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,417
Jump in.

830
00:58:41,543 --> 00:58:42,877
Jump in.

831
00:58:54,973 --> 00:58:58,392
This nation's in fucking chaos
with its hung parliaments.

832
00:58:58,518 --> 00:58:59,644
A year ago,

833
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:02,313
they were to bring back rationing.

834
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:05,816
Now we've got inflation at fucking 25%.

835
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:08,903
The country's at war,
Mr. Dunford.

836
00:59:09,029 --> 00:59:11,072
The governments and the unions,
the left and the right,

837
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:13,199
the rich and the poor.

838
00:59:13,325 --> 00:59:15,826
Then you've got your enemies within:

839
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:18,996
your paddies,
your wogs, your niggers,

840
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:20,915
your fucking gypos,

841
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:23,334
the poofs, the perverts,
even the bloody women.

842
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,878
They're all out for what they can get.

843
00:59:26,004 --> 00:59:28,631
I tell you, soon,
there'll be naught left for us lot.

844
00:59:28,757 --> 00:59:31,968
Time to turn the tide.

845
00:59:32,094 --> 00:59:34,095
So you're not a Labour man, then?

846
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:35,721
Of course I bloody am.

847
00:59:35,847 --> 00:59:37,890
The Tory cunts have
out priced themselves.

848
00:59:38,016 --> 00:59:40,726
Your Labour man will always do a deal.

849
00:59:43,897 --> 00:59:47,066
The trouble with your generation is,
you know naught.

850
00:59:47,192 --> 00:59:50,611
Your lot never fought a bloody war.

851
00:59:50,737 --> 00:59:52,905
Fucking cowboys and Indians then, son.

852
00:59:53,031 --> 00:59:55,574
Like now.

853
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:03,749
Are you going to continue
our late friend's crusade

854
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:08,254
against local corruption,
Mr. Dunford?

855
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:12,174
Why'd you ask me that?

856
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,969
Me and Barry had a very
special relationship.

857
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:19,098
Most of the time.

858
01:00:21,435 --> 01:00:24,145
Mutually beneficial,
it was.

859
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,898
In what way?

860
01:00:30,277 --> 01:00:33,154
I'm in a fortunate position to be able to

861
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,199
occasionally pass on
information that comes my way,

862
01:00:37,325 --> 01:00:39,326
certain officials sticking their fingers

863
01:00:39,453 --> 01:00:43,539
where they shouldn't,
that kind of thing.

864
01:00:46,543 --> 01:00:48,544
You like the cut?

865
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,381
Top man,
your dad.

866
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:58,262
Knew how to cut his cloth.

867
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,723
Solid, dependable.

868
01:01:02,601 --> 01:01:04,977
That's not you,
is it, Mr. Dunford?

869
01:01:06,438 --> 01:01:08,647
You're more like me.

870
01:01:08,774 --> 01:01:11,567
We like to fuck and make a buck,
and we're not right choosy how.

871
01:01:11,693 --> 01:01:13,319
Isn't that right?

872
01:01:14,863 --> 01:01:17,448
Eh?

873
01:01:20,327 --> 01:01:23,537
Drop by Saturday lunchtime.

874
01:01:23,663 --> 01:01:25,831
I've got something that
might interest you.

875
01:01:34,508 --> 01:01:35,633
Mr. Dunford.

876
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:37,301
What?

877
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:40,262
My wife is a very unwell woman.

878
01:01:40,388 --> 01:01:45,601
Speak to her again,
it won't be your hand that gets smashed.

879
01:01:47,187 --> 01:01:48,354
Come on.

880
01:01:55,028 --> 01:01:56,862
Seen Jack's leader?

881
01:02:00,492 --> 01:02:01,909
Ziggy was in, love.

882
01:02:02,035 --> 01:02:03,327
Looking for you.

883
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:05,746
Who were?

884
01:02:05,872 --> 01:02:07,623
Poof with the orange hair.

885
01:02:07,749 --> 01:02:11,043
He's outside.

886
01:02:38,071 --> 01:02:40,072
I saw you at Barry's funeral,
didn't I?

887
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:44,285
We've seen things,
you know?

888
01:02:44,411 --> 01:02:45,953
I'll bet you have.

889
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,957
Listen, I know people,
powerful people,

890
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:51,208
because I have sucked the cocks

891
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,711
of some of the greatest
men this country has.

892
01:02:53,837 --> 01:02:56,297
Well, a boy should have a hobby.

893
01:02:56,423 --> 01:02:57,631
Listen, don't let me keep you.

894
01:02:57,757 --> 01:02:58,883
Hey, relax.
Just relax.

895
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:01,427
I'm sorry.

896
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,018
It's all right.

897
01:03:09,144 --> 01:03:10,144
Okay?

898
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:16,192
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

899
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:18,485
I'm not going to bite you.

900
01:03:18,612 --> 01:03:22,323
You liked Barry,
didn't you?

901
01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:25,534
Yeah, I did,

902
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,453
because he was kind.

903
01:03:27,579 --> 01:03:28,454
Yeah, he was.

904
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:30,122
Yeah.

905
01:03:30,248 --> 01:03:34,460
And he liked you.

906
01:03:34,586 --> 01:03:36,378
He said he wanted to help you.

907
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:43,802
This is his life's work.

908
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:46,555
He said to give it to you

909
01:03:46,681 --> 01:03:49,016
in case anything happened to him.

910
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,355
Do you think Barry was murdered?

911
01:03:56,816 --> 01:04:00,444
Listen to me.

912
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,697
BJ loved Barry,

913
01:04:03,823 --> 01:04:08,369
really loved him.

914
01:04:08,495 --> 01:04:13,332
But he was too fucking
scared to go to his funeral.

915
01:04:25,887 --> 01:04:29,473
I don't know who did Barry.

916
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,184
I don't want to know.

917
01:05:04,884 --> 01:05:08,220
Michael John Myshkin of 69
Newstead View, Fitzwilliam,

918
01:05:08,346 --> 01:05:09,972
was today taken into police custody

919
01:05:10,098 --> 01:05:11,765
for the murder of Clare Kemplay.

920
01:05:11,891 --> 01:05:14,101
Myshkin has insisted...

921
01:05:14,227 --> 01:05:15,436
It's fucking mental out there.

922
01:05:15,562 --> 01:05:16,687
So who is he?

923
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:18,022
Works for a photo lab.

924
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:20,107
Dad's a Polack,
hardly speaks a word of English.

925
01:05:20,233 --> 01:05:21,567
That's lucky.

926
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:26,530
Are you Michael John Myshkin

927
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:29,325
of 69 Newstead View, Fitzwilliam?

928
01:05:31,411 --> 01:05:32,786
Yes.

929
01:05:32,912 --> 01:05:35,122
You are accused that on or between

930
01:05:35,248 --> 01:05:37,583
August the 31st and
the 1st of September

931
01:05:37,709 --> 01:05:39,960
you did murder Clare Kemplay

932
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:42,629
against the peace of our sovereign lady,
the queen.

933
01:05:42,756 --> 01:05:45,507
Mr. Myshkin,
the West Yorkshire Metropolitan Police

934
01:05:45,633 --> 01:05:47,259
have requested that
you be held in custody

935
01:05:47,385 --> 01:05:48,886
for a further eight days.

936
01:05:49,012 --> 01:05:53,140
The court understands that
you have no objection.

937
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,143
No.

938
01:05:56,269 --> 01:05:57,728
Michael John Myshkin,

939
01:05:57,854 --> 01:05:59,897
due to the seriousness of the accusation,

940
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:01,690
your case will be referred
to the Crown Court.

941
01:06:01,816 --> 01:06:05,652
In the interim,
you will be remanded in custody.

942
01:06:07,989 --> 01:06:10,199
And that concludes the business
for today, your worships.

943
01:06:10,325 --> 01:06:12,159
Thank you.

944
01:06:12,285 --> 01:06:13,660
Please!
No!

945
01:06:13,787 --> 01:06:15,788
It-it wasn't me!

946
01:06:15,914 --> 01:06:17,331
It was the wolf.

947
01:06:17,457 --> 01:06:19,833
Under those beautiful carpets!

948
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:20,876
What was that?

949
01:06:21,002 --> 01:06:22,211
What did he- what did he just say?

950
01:06:22,337 --> 01:06:23,337
The wolf?
What was that?

951
01:06:23,463 --> 01:06:25,130
Something about carpets.
Bollocks.

952
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:35,933
They got the bastard, then, Scoop?

953
01:06:36,935 --> 01:06:39,061
You can't go in there!

954
01:06:40,688 --> 01:06:42,689
Bloody farce isn't it.
Myshkin didn't do it, did he?

955
01:06:42,816 --> 01:06:44,316
He's confessed.

956
01:06:44,442 --> 01:06:46,527
Yeah, but it's- it's absolute bollocks.

957
01:06:46,653 --> 01:06:48,529
Nefarious deeds carried
out in what he called

958
01:06:48,655 --> 01:06:49,905
his "underground kingdom.
"

959
01:06:50,031 --> 01:06:51,448
Jack, did you see him?
He's retarded.

960
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:53,534
No, his dad's just a Polack,
that's all.

961
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,202
What's happened to your hand?

962
01:06:55,328 --> 01:06:56,703
I hope it don't cramp your style.

963
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:58,872
- Fuck off.
- Now watch your language.

964
01:06:58,998 --> 01:07:01,250
They found all kinds of things
in Myshkin's room, Scoop.

965
01:07:01,376 --> 01:07:03,585
Photos of little girls,
boxes of them.

966
01:07:03,711 --> 01:07:05,796
Well, he does work in a photo lab.

967
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:07,172
He's coughing for the lot.

968
01:07:07,298 --> 01:07:09,049
Clare Kemplay,
Jeanette Garland,

969
01:07:09,175 --> 01:07:11,135
and the Ridyard girl,
right back to 1969.

970
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:13,053
Right, so he's 22, right?

971
01:07:13,179 --> 01:07:15,097
So, therefore,
he would have been 16

972
01:07:15,223 --> 01:07:16,557
when Susan Ridyard went missing.

973
01:07:16,683 --> 01:07:18,183
- So?
- So fuck you, Jack!

974
01:07:18,309 --> 01:07:19,393
Hey!

975
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:20,894
Now, watch your language in my office!

976
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:22,896
Feels wrong,
doesn't it, eh?

977
01:07:23,022 --> 01:07:26,650
All that slog,
all those hunches.

978
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,445
You just don't want it to be him, Scoop.

979
01:07:29,571 --> 01:07:30,821
I was the same once.

980
01:07:30,947 --> 01:07:32,156
You're in their pockets.

981
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:34,324
What are you talking about?

982
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:36,410
Police going about their business,

983
01:07:36,536 --> 01:07:39,913
supported by the good old Yorkshire Post.

984
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:42,374
The truth is the truth, Scoop.

985
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,959
And it's a bitter pill,

986
01:07:44,085 --> 01:07:45,794
but you'll get used to it one day.

987
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,463
I'll handle the press conference, boss.

988
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:48,547
Thanks, Jack.

989
01:07:48,673 --> 01:07:50,007
Fucking chamber yourself, Jack.

990
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:51,300
- Edward!
- Yeah?

991
01:07:51,426 --> 01:07:52,968
I won't have you coming in here like this.

992
01:07:53,094 --> 01:07:53,969
- Like what?
- Like this.

993
01:07:54,095 --> 01:07:55,304
Now, take the rest of the month off

994
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:57,556
and get that hand sorted out.

995
01:07:57,682 --> 01:08:00,058
Are you listening to me, lad?

996
01:08:00,185 --> 01:08:01,518
Edward?

997
01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:06,440
How well do you know John Dawson?

998
01:08:06,566 --> 01:08:08,859
Do you mind?

999
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:11,111
Edward, I haven't got time

1000
01:08:11,237 --> 01:08:13,197
for your adolescent conspiracy theory.

1001
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:16,158
Go on, get home,
and get yourself sorted out.

1002
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:50,025
She's dead,
isn't she?

1003
01:08:56,324 --> 01:08:58,450
It's all right.

1004
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:15,962
♪ Love awhile ♪

1005
01:11:16,089 --> 01:11:21,051
♪ And when love goes ♪

1006
01:11:21,177 --> 01:11:26,139
♪ You try to hide the tears inside ♪

1007
01:11:26,265 --> 01:11:28,433
The Karachi's closed, hen.

1008
01:11:30,478 --> 01:11:32,771
It's all right, Clare.

1009
01:11:32,897 --> 01:11:35,023
He's with me.

1010
01:11:35,149 --> 01:11:36,817
Same again, love.

1011
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:45,617
You look like shit.

1012
01:11:45,743 --> 01:11:47,035
Up all night.

1013
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:48,912
What's your excuse?

1014
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:51,998
I've got my weaknesses, lad.

1015
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:52,999
Aye.

1016
01:11:53,126 --> 01:11:55,127
Paula Garland one of them?

1017
01:11:58,506 --> 01:12:00,966
Me and Paula go back a long way.

1018
01:12:01,092 --> 01:12:03,802
We're old friends.

1019
01:12:05,972 --> 01:12:07,764
I like this place.

1020
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,100
It's private.

1021
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:12,144
Just the wogs and us.

1022
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:15,063
That's how I like things, private.

1023
01:12:16,983 --> 01:12:18,859
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1024
01:12:20,653 --> 01:12:23,905
Another round, Sammy.

1025
01:12:24,031 --> 01:12:27,200
And bring the pud trolley over.

1026
01:12:27,326 --> 01:12:30,203
I want to show Mr.
Dunford some delights.

1027
01:12:32,165 --> 01:12:34,166
I think you know we've got
an important investment

1028
01:12:34,292 --> 01:12:35,959
over at Hunslet Carr.

1029
01:12:38,504 --> 01:12:40,172
Feast your eyes.

1030
01:12:42,175 --> 01:12:44,926
What about that, then?

1031
01:12:46,053 --> 01:12:47,053
Look.

1032
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:50,098
It's got little trees and everything-

1033
01:12:50,224 --> 01:12:52,809
what your Yanks call a shopping mall.

1034
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:54,728
You've got your high-street chains,

1035
01:12:54,854 --> 01:12:57,939
cinema, bowling alleys,
cafs, restaurants,

1036
01:12:58,065 --> 01:12:59,441
all under one roof.

1037
01:12:59,567 --> 01:13:00,776
Put an hotel in there,

1038
01:13:00,902 --> 01:13:03,278
there's no need to fuck off home.

1039
01:13:03,404 --> 01:13:05,989
Not bad, eh?

1040
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:07,908
And your pals on the
West Yorkshire Police

1041
01:13:08,034 --> 01:13:11,578
already cleared the site for you so...

1042
01:13:11,704 --> 01:13:13,747
Gypos.

1043
01:13:13,873 --> 01:13:16,291
Squatters.

1044
01:13:16,417 --> 01:13:17,667
That's my land.

1045
01:13:17,794 --> 01:13:20,420
So what's the problem?

1046
01:13:20,546 --> 01:13:23,340
I've got investors to look after,
haven't I?

1047
01:13:23,466 --> 01:13:26,468
Is Bill Molloy one of them?

1048
01:13:26,594 --> 01:13:27,886
Don't be a cunt.

1049
01:13:29,764 --> 01:13:31,598
Of course Bill Molloy's one of them,

1050
01:13:31,724 --> 01:13:33,391
not the only copper neither.

1051
01:13:33,518 --> 01:13:36,561
Give it to him, Paul.

1052
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:43,109
Open it.

1053
01:13:44,862 --> 01:13:46,363
Take a fucking look, lad.

1054
01:13:59,502 --> 01:14:03,672
I apologize for the vile content
of these snaps, Mr. Dunford.

1055
01:14:03,798 --> 01:14:06,591
I hear you're a bit of a cunt man.

1056
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:11,972
Sticks in the craw,
doesn't it?

1057
01:14:12,098 --> 01:14:14,599
I mean,
how can they do it?

1058
01:14:16,143 --> 01:14:17,644
Who is this?

1059
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,062
Who is it?

1060
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:21,147
Bloody hell!

1061
01:14:21,274 --> 01:14:25,068
That's Councilor William Shaw
of the Labour Party, that is.

1062
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:27,696
That's your man most likely to succeed.

1063
01:14:27,822 --> 01:14:30,782
He's your nigger in the whatsit,
is Councilor Shaw,

1064
01:14:30,908 --> 01:14:33,243
traitor to the cause.

1065
01:14:34,328 --> 01:14:37,330
It's a scoop is what it is.

1066
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,626
An ambitious lad like yourself.

1067
01:14:41,752 --> 01:14:43,795
Make your name with this one.

1068
01:14:49,468 --> 01:14:51,094
No.
Wrong boy, Dawson.

1069
01:14:56,976 --> 01:14:59,060
Gonna be a failure all of your life, son?

1070
01:15:02,106 --> 01:15:03,356
Come on, Eddie.

1071
01:15:03,482 --> 01:15:08,528
I need a little support,
a little cooperation.

1072
01:15:08,654 --> 01:15:10,113
You play your part, son,

1073
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,574
we'll all get what we want.

1074
01:15:15,453 --> 01:15:16,786
No.

1075
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:21,625
I'm a journalist.

1076
01:15:23,711 --> 01:15:25,545
Oh, yeah?

1077
01:15:27,673 --> 01:15:28,840
Like Barry.

1078
01:15:30,509 --> 01:15:32,844
I respected Barry.

1079
01:15:36,015 --> 01:15:39,059
He was a good man.

1080
01:15:39,185 --> 01:15:42,479
Problem is,
he had his own agenda.

1081
01:15:48,569 --> 01:15:51,863
Is that why you had him killed?

1082
01:15:53,491 --> 01:15:56,117
What the fucking hell are
you gonna do about it?

1083
01:15:56,243 --> 01:15:57,202
Eh, son?

1084
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:00,330
You're a fucking student
with your notebook.

1085
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:03,166
I do not want to be a part of this!

1086
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,250
Tough shit.

1087
01:16:04,377 --> 01:16:05,418
You already are.

1088
01:16:35,032 --> 01:16:35,991
All right, yes.

1089
01:16:36,117 --> 01:16:38,618
I went to see John last night.

1090
01:16:38,744 --> 01:16:42,414
I told you.
He's been very kind.

1091
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:44,541
So you fucked him?

1092
01:16:46,752 --> 01:16:48,920
You fucked John Dawson?

1093
01:16:50,297 --> 01:16:52,048
Me?

1094
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,300
I'll fuck anything in trousers.

1095
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:57,512
You shouldn't have said that.

1096
01:17:01,225 --> 01:17:02,600
Go on, then.

1097
01:17:10,901 --> 01:17:13,403
What are you going to do?

1098
01:17:13,529 --> 01:17:17,157
You chose to get involved.

1099
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,493
You see?
You don't care.

1100
01:17:20,619 --> 01:17:25,457
You don't really fucking care at all,
do you?

1101
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:27,000
You just want to rescue me.

1102
01:17:27,126 --> 01:17:28,501
Well, you're not the first.

1103
01:17:28,627 --> 01:17:30,628
And you think you'll be the last?

1104
01:17:32,465 --> 01:17:34,883
Oh, no.

1105
01:17:35,009 --> 01:17:35,884
Eddie, wait.

1106
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:37,260
I'm sorry.

1107
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:38,970
I'm sorry.

1108
01:17:40,973 --> 01:17:42,766
Please, listen to me.

1109
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:48,521
Dawson fucks

1110
01:17:48,647 --> 01:17:51,107
who he wants to fuck.

1111
01:17:54,695 --> 01:17:56,654
He takes what he wants.

1112
01:18:22,765 --> 01:18:25,266
How long have you known him for?

1113
01:18:33,859 --> 01:18:36,986
All my life.

1114
01:19:09,061 --> 01:19:11,938
We've got to get out of this place.

1115
01:19:12,064 --> 01:19:13,982
What?

1116
01:19:14,108 --> 01:19:17,277
We've got to get out of Yorkshire.

1117
01:19:19,697 --> 01:19:20,697
I can't.

1118
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:23,199
Yeah.
Yeah, you can.

1119
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:26,119
Yeah, you can.

1120
01:19:35,754 --> 01:19:38,464
They've got sunshine down south.

1121
01:19:38,591 --> 01:19:40,592
Yeah.

1122
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:50,935
They've got seaview flats
and warm summer breezes.

1123
01:20:03,657 --> 01:20:07,243
Let's just go there right
now and never come back.

1124
01:20:15,586 --> 01:20:16,669
Pack a bag.

1125
01:20:18,505 --> 01:20:20,173
Yeah?

1126
01:20:20,299 --> 01:20:22,675
Yeah.

1127
01:20:22,801 --> 01:20:23,885
Okay.

1128
01:20:24,011 --> 01:20:25,053
I'll be back.

1129
01:20:25,179 --> 01:20:27,138
A couple of hours,
all right?

1130
01:20:45,616 --> 01:20:47,200
All right,
so you're one of the good ones,

1131
01:20:47,326 --> 01:20:48,409
aren't you,
Sergeant Fraser?

1132
01:20:48,535 --> 01:20:50,203
No, you are.

1133
01:20:50,329 --> 01:20:52,664
Not many of them left.

1134
01:20:59,171 --> 01:21:03,091
This is Barry Gannon's life's work.

1135
01:21:03,217 --> 01:21:05,301
This is high-level corruption:

1136
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:09,764
business, local government,
West Yorkshire Police.

1137
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:11,724
- Who in particular?
- Have a look.

1138
01:21:18,315 --> 01:21:20,275
Is this too hot for you?

1139
01:21:37,835 --> 01:21:39,711
I thought I could do it,
but I can't.

1140
01:21:51,557 --> 01:21:54,100

Eddie, lad.

Some people I'd like you to meet, son.

1182
01:25:02,122 --> 01:25:04,624
I just want to see Paula.

1183
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,167
That's all I want to do.

1184
01:25:06,293 --> 01:25:09,128
I'm not interested in
your filthy little world.

1185
01:25:09,254 --> 01:25:11,047
I just want to see Paula.

Paula's gone, son.

1187
01:25:12,758 --> 01:25:15,176
Long gone.

1188
01:25:15,302 --> 01:25:18,971
Come on, you know that,
don't you?

1189
01:25:19,097 --> 01:25:22,058
Where is she?

1190
01:25:22,184 --> 01:25:23,184
Let it go, lad.

1191
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:24,268
Let me introduce you to-

1192
01:25:24,394 --> 01:25:25,478
- Paula!
- Eddie, lad.

1193
01:25:25,604 --> 01:25:28,231
Paula!

1194
01:25:28,357 --> 01:25:30,191
Paula!
- No!

1195
01:25:30,317 --> 01:25:31,192
Paula!

1196
01:25:31,318 --> 01:25:33,152
I said...

1197
01:25:33,278 --> 01:25:37,281
Tell them about the others.

1198
01:25:37,407 --> 01:25:39,951
Beneath the beautiful new carpets.

1199
01:25:40,077 --> 01:25:41,285
Beneath the grass.

1200
01:25:41,411 --> 01:25:42,578
Way after your bedtime.

1201
01:25:48,126 --> 01:25:50,044
Where is she?

1202
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:54,173

He is now.

1210
01:26:30,252 --> 01:26:31,919
Come on, sunshine.

1211
01:26:43,515 --> 01:26:44,724
Get off!

1212
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:46,642

1213
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:49,103
Fuck!

01:26:50,689 --> 01:26:52,273
Fuck!

1215
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:34,857
Please, please, please.

1216
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:10,851
What is it?

1217
01:28:14,314 --> 01:28:15,314
What is it?

1218
01:28:19,945 --> 01:28:21,195
Take a seat, lad.

1219
01:28:21,321 --> 01:28:24,156
Want me to take a seat?

1220
01:28:24,282 --> 01:28:25,783
Okay.

1221
01:28:44,761 --> 01:28:48,723
I want you to put your hands...

1222
01:28:48,849 --> 01:28:51,350
down on this,
like me.

1223
01:28:52,769 --> 01:28:54,019
Come on.

1224
01:28:54,146 --> 01:28:55,354
Put them down flat.

1225
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,523
Come on.

1226
01:29:07,617 --> 01:29:09,994
Yeah, nice and flat.

1227
01:29:25,385 --> 01:29:28,053
Help!

1228
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:31,724
Help me.

1229
01:29:59,836 --> 01:30:01,170
Up.

1230
01:30:28,532 --> 01:30:30,324
Look at her.

1231
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:32,576
Look at her!

1232
01:30:32,702 --> 01:30:34,620
Forensics, lad.

1233
01:30:34,746 --> 01:30:37,206
You're all over her clothes,
in her flat,

1234
01:30:37,332 --> 01:30:39,083
under her fingernails,
up her cunt!

1235
01:30:39,209 --> 01:30:40,543
You're all over her.

1236
01:30:40,669 --> 01:30:42,211
You did it,
didn't you, eh?

1237
01:30:42,337 --> 01:30:44,630
Go on,
say it.

1238
01:30:44,756 --> 01:30:45,923
Say you did it.

1239
01:30:46,049 --> 01:30:48,634
Bill!

1240
01:30:49,636 --> 01:30:52,304
Stay with him.

1241
01:31:18,957 --> 01:31:20,958
I didn't do it.

1242
01:31:28,091 --> 01:31:28,966
I didn't do it.

1243
01:31:29,092 --> 01:31:30,843
I loved her.

1244
01:31:32,929 --> 01:31:37,391
Of course you didn't do it.

1245
01:31:37,517 --> 01:31:40,519
We know who did, though,
don't we?

1246
01:31:42,564 --> 01:31:45,065
Don't we, lad? Eh?

1247
01:32:21,603 --> 01:32:23,520
Keep fucking still!

1248
01:32:23,647 --> 01:32:25,648
Behave!

1249
01:32:34,157 --> 01:32:35,699
That's it.

1250
01:32:35,825 --> 01:32:37,117
Oh, shit.

1251
01:32:37,243 --> 01:32:38,661
Oh, for fuck...

1252
01:32:38,787 --> 01:32:40,329
Say, "Do it!"

1253
01:32:40,455 --> 01:32:41,830
- No!
- Yes! Now!

1254
01:32:41,957 --> 01:32:42,831
Now!
Now!

1255
01:32:54,427 --> 01:32:56,178
No!

1256
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:57,846
No, please!

1257
01:32:57,973 --> 01:32:59,223
We were only joking.

1258
01:33:03,937 --> 01:33:05,479
Are you all right, lad?

1259
01:33:05,605 --> 01:33:07,106
Are you all right, lad?

1260
01:33:07,232 --> 01:33:09,191
- We're just joking.
- Just joking.

1261
01:33:11,653 --> 01:33:12,569
Hey!

1262
01:33:12,696 --> 01:33:14,530
Come on!

1263
01:33:14,656 --> 01:33:16,573
Now, these-

1264
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:19,827
These are a different ball
game altogether, son.

1265
01:33:19,953 --> 01:33:21,370
These are real.

1266
01:33:21,496 --> 01:33:23,122
Just relax.

1267
01:33:23,248 --> 01:33:24,289
It's all over now, mate.

1268
01:33:24,416 --> 01:33:26,041
This is the easy bit.

1269
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:27,042
Give me that.

1270
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,252
Put it in his pocket.

1271
01:33:28,378 --> 01:33:30,045
Put it in his pocket.

1272
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:31,714
Right.

1273
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:37,094
Now you are going to do us a little favor.

1274
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:38,387
Come here.

1275
01:33:38,513 --> 01:33:39,680
Come with me.

1276
01:33:41,474 --> 01:33:43,600
You see this?

1277
01:33:43,727 --> 01:33:47,062
This is the North.

1278
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:49,356
We do what we want.

1279
01:36:40,987 --> 01:36:43,030
The others?

1280
01:36:45,575 --> 01:36:49,411
Beneath the beautiful carpets.

1281
01:36:49,537 --> 01:36:53,207
He always used to be so careful.

1282
01:37:00,506 --> 01:37:03,634
Where is he?

1283
01:37:19,442 --> 01:37:22,277
Eddie, is that you?

1284
01:37:24,489 --> 01:37:27,324
Never did one good thing,
did I?

1285
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:35,374
Please come home, love.

1286
01:37:37,627 --> 01:37:39,795
No.
I'm sorry.

1287
01:37:39,921 --> 01:37:42,089
Can't.

1288
01:37:42,215 --> 01:37:43,924
Bye, Mum.

1289
01:38:49,449 --> 01:38:52,909
Look who's here.

1290
01:39:05,006 --> 01:39:07,132
Well...

1291
01:39:07,258 --> 01:39:10,761
All this over the fucking shopping center?

1292
01:39:10,887 --> 01:39:12,721
Fucking hell!

1293
01:39:19,604 --> 01:39:23,273
Paula were your fault, son.

1294
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:28,904
Letting that prick of yours lead
you where you shouldn't go.

1295
01:39:37,330 --> 01:39:40,290
And what about the children?

1296
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:42,667
The wolf does for John.

1297
01:39:42,794 --> 01:39:44,669
Private weakness.

1298
01:39:44,796 --> 01:39:47,506
Fucking hell,
I'm no angel.

1299
01:39:47,632 --> 01:39:48,965
The wolf does for John.

1300
01:42:02,642 --> 01:42:08,396
They got sunshine down south
and warm summer breezes.

1301
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:13,401
Let's just go there right
now and never come back.
