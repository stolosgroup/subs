1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,750
I'll be late...

3
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,750
80. Let's go!

4
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:21,542
Good morning.

5
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:23,083
Good morning, taras.

6
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,208
- Good morning!
- Good afternoon!

7
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:35,917
Good morning!

8
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:39,917
Good“.

9
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:43,458
Good afternoon.

10
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,792
Good morning!

11
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,268
- Is that my journal?
- Yes, take it.

12
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:54,851
Mykola, you have something on your cheek.

13
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:58,601
Yanukovych refused to sign
an agreement with the eu

14
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,934
and set a course
for improving relations with Russia.

15
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,643
The largest protest took place
on maid an in Kyiv,

16
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:07,726
the special forces killed
more than 100 protesters.

17
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,292
Look, a sniper...

18
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,643
President of Ukraine,
Viktor yanukovych fled to Russia,

19
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,643
leaving his post as commander-in-chief.

20
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,143
Crimea was completely captured

21
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,809
and taken under the control
of the Russian Federation.

22
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,167
Crimea

23
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:27,583
Velocity is a physical quantity

24
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:30,000
that characterizes the motion

25
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:35,000
and distance that
an object travels per unit of time.

26
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,583
The velocity is calculated

27
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:43,208
by the formula v=s/t.

28
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:46,393
Where v is the speed...

29
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:49,625
- Are you a moron?
- Shut your mouth, faggot!

30
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,792
Ivan...

31
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,333
Sis distance.

32
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,000
And t is time.

33
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,976
Can you hit in the same place again?

34
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,667
Reset timer?

35
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,958
0.9 seconds.

36
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,792
I measured a distance of seven meters.

37
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,958
Ivan, what is the speed?

38
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,917
Taras...

39
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,875
7.8 meters per second.

40
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:58,958
Yes.

41
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,667
It was at this speed

42
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,750
that Ivan spat out a piece of paper.

43
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,083
Well, Ivan...

44
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:19,375
If the time is not 0.9, but 0.7

45
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,917
at the same distance...

46
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,917
What would the speed be?

47
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:27,708
Write the answer on the board.

48
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,250
Is there an answer?

49
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,667
Now it's clear
what you are distracted by...

50
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Goodbye.

51
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,042
Goodbye, taras.

52
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,000
Listen, digger...

53
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:38,917
I'm sorry?

54
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,708
You're a stranger here, get out.

55
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,292
Lyosha, are you ready?

56
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:00,958
Yes.

57
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,458
The voronenko family
are the first eco-settlers in donbas.

58
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:09,167
A year ago,
they registered a two-hectare plot of land

59
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,930
near horlivka
and moved to live in a field.

60
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,958
Mykola has three higher education degrees,
mathematician, physicist, and ecologist.

61
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,708
Explain what caused
you to take such a radical step?

62
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:23,458
As an ecologist, I understand
that difficult times await us.

63
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:28,292
Only by changing the harmful way
of life to an ecological one,

64
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,417
can we have a chance
to save the planet and ourselves.

65
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,333
How long do you plan to live here?

66
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:39,083
We want to have and raise a child here.

67
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,750
Is your wife pregnant?

68
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,833
Yes.

69
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,625
This means
everything will work out just fine.

70
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,583
Tell me, what is this sign?

71
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,083
This is our ancestral sign.

72
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,792
And what does it mean?

73
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,125
Paw of a white raven.

74
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,708
Will you tell me?

75
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,042
- This is... an ancient...
- Get the microphone closer.

76
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let me hold it.

77
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:11,958
Legend...

78
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:17,458
Raven created the world
out of darkness, waving his wings.

79
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,625
And the world is
a black ocean with a shore,

80
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,375
where people will soon come to live.

81
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,000
The raven, feeling pity for the people,

82
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,875
turns the ocean's salty water
into fresh water and food,

83
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,042
but in return...

84
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:39,000
Sacrifices its snow-white feathers.

85
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Thank you.

86
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,250
Lesha, stop.

87
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,875
Come on in, now I'll show you inside...

88
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,708
And this is a windmill.

89
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:54,250
I can tell you later about it,
by the way, I made it myself.

90
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:02,542
Shall we start with a dynamo machine?

91
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,833
I'll show you how it works...

92
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,208
See?

93
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:20,292
Lyosha, film just a few more details
and these sketches.

94
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,417
And you're not afraid to give birth here?

95
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,125
No, I'm not afraid.

96
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Hmm...

97
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,417
Lena,

98
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,000
- I hope we are done?
- Yes, we're done.

99
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:01,000
- I haven't shown you everything yet...
- Nikolai, thank you, we've had enough.

100
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,458
Two crazy people.

101
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,375
Something fell out.

102
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,167
We do not throw trash here.

103
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,333
Goodbye.

104
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,333
Let's go.

105
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,042
Don't worry,

106
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,720
someday everything
will come back to normal.

107
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:10,125
Come with me, my dear love

108
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:14,292
to a place with shining stars

109
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:18,333
there are rivers, mountains live on love

110
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:22,333
the birds sing for us

111
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:26,667
your eyes are shining like emeralds

112
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,375
and disappeared
in the misfortune of summer

113
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:36,375
I will give you the whole world

114
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,667
and a daughter with the name nasty a

115
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:46,250
I will give you the whole world

116
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,625
and a daughter with the name...

117
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,167
Nasty a...

118
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,250
This is for you from us.

119
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:15,792
Your little angel.

120
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,333
Will protect you.

121
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,125
Buriy, we pass the line.

122
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,958
Confirmed. Chevrons.

123
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:38,792
Caution!
State border of Ukraine. No passage.

124
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,208
Get up, be fast!

125
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming...

126
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,542
Oh, a normal engine!

127
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,500
Flying!

128
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,375
I'm flying...

129
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,167
Yes, everything was canceled.

130
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,167
No, I don't know...

131
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,625
Maybe it won't be...

132
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,417
Yes, I'll close it.

133
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,458
This morning, an unknown bus stopped

134
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:06,125
near the horlivka police department
in the donetsk region.

135
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,083
It is also noted that
armed militants in balaclavas

136
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,792
and pro-Russian activists

137
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:15,292
continue to maintain the buildings
of regional state administrations

138
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,167
in slovyansk, kramatorsk, and donetsk.

139
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,583
And...

140
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,708
It just became clear
that special forces of gur

141
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:26,083
of the Russian Federation took part

142
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:30,250
in the capture
of the rada verkhovna of crime a.

143
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,667
Take your hands off of her!

144
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:07,917
Who are you?

145
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,667
Bitch!

146
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,625
What are you doing here, khokhlyara?

147
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,875
I'm a teacher, I live here.

148
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,958
Are you a pacifist or something?

149
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,875
- Who is he?
- My husband.

150
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,083
In Russian, fuck, just talk!

151
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:38,750
Husband“.

152
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,500
Don't touch her, she is pregnant!

153
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:43,958
And what is this?

154
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,792
Those are my drawings.

155
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:48,958
Look at her face, she's definitely a spy!

156
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,333
Stand!

157
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,833
Don't squeal!

158
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:14,875
Everyone, let's go.

159
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,125
What about him?

160
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,167
We are leaving, I said.

161
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,250
Bitch!

162
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,833
Fuck!

163
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,042
Get in the car quickly.

164
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,792
Please don't die...

165
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,167
Don't die, I'm here...

166
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,208
I'm here with you. No, no...

167
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,125
Local?

168
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,042
Documents?

169
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,708
In the bag.

170
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,250
Who is she?

171
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:23,042
Wife.

172
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,625
Mykola voronenko...

173
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,833
Looks like he is ours.

174
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,625
Come on.

175
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,833
I don't care what happened there!

176
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,750
Why the fuck is he here?

177
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:26,417
So, I should have left him
in the middle of the field?

178
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,583
I do not understand.
And if it's their spy?

179
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,292
Have you thought about that?

180
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,708
Well, of course,
you haven't thought about it.

181
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:36,875
Your head just doesn't work that way.

182
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,478
But you are clearly not aware of that.

183
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,833
So, listen to me carefully.
Take him away from here as far as...

184
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,167
Stop...

185
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:50,000
Did you blindfold him
when you drove him to us?

186
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,625
What? Do you have no brain at all?

187
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:59,458
You leaked our base to him, you idiot!

188
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,750
Should I shoot him now?

189
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:05,792
Ah, go away... you motherfucker!

190
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:08,833
Skinny,

191
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,667
what did I tell you?

192
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,708
Go to the toilet
with a weapon in your hand!

193
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:16,792
That's right!

194
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,417
Why are you reaching for your gun?

195
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,542
Do you want to shoot yourself?

196
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:25,958
We need to drive them out.

197
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:30,292
What did he say?

198
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,250
I want to drive them out of our land.

199
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:52,583
- Falcons flutter in the sky.
- Falcons flutter in the sky.

200
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:56,167
- Our squad flies into battle.
- Our squad flies into battle.

201
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,500
- We will defeat the enemies.
- We will defeat the enemies.

202
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:02,958
- Although they crawl from all sides.
- Although they crawl from all sides.

203
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:05,333
Come on, guys, come on.

204
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:08,375
Faster. Tempo, tempo I said! Come on!

205
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,375
Bad!

206
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,500
As you were!

207
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:20,875
Show him.

208
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,125
As you were!

209
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:39,250
That's it, comrade!

210
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,667
Come on, come on, men, faster!

211
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:46,250
Thirty-three,

212
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,750
thirty-four...

213
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,833
- Thirty-five!
- Keep the body straight.

214
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:53,375
Thirty-six!

215
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,417
Thirty-seven!

216
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,583
And now have a rest!

217
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:09,083
Well, do you enjoy being here
as a pacifist?

218
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,625
Yes, sir, Mr. Commander!

219
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,583
I'm glad to hear that.

220
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:19,083
Permission to speak, sir, Mr. Commander!

221
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:20,750
Permitted.

222
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:25,292
I'm not a pacifist, Mr. Commander.

223
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:28,917
My code name is raven!

224
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:31,000
Dead raven!

225
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:35,500
I said one and a half!

226
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,833
This code name still needs
to be earned, comrade.

227
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,000
Do you understand?

228
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:50,250
Yes, sir, Mr. Commander!

229
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:54,042
Chief.

230
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:00,458
Crazy?

231
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,000
Hey, bud, you want tea?

232
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:08,833
And you?

233
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,792
Don't sleep!

234
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:37,625
Quickly, quickly...

235
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:40,333
Girls, don't get caught in your bras!

236
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:04,542
The war will come to an end while you are
still swarming like a pacifist!

237
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,750
Start again! Disassemble!

238
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:20,309
Quickly! Let's not linger!

239
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,542
Twenty-eight,

240
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,417
twenty-nine...

241
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,875
- Lower!
- Forty...

242
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:10,875
Attention!

243
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:14,500
There are not enough snipers at the front.

244
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:19,542
Volunteers organize free courses.
Are you interested?

245
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,250
Bad, klym, dunay, good.

246
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:33,250
What? A pacifist? You too? Sit down.

247
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,417
I, private raven, ask to join!

248
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:40,917
Listen, you don't know
how to remove a magazine from the ak!

249
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,125
Which of you is a sniper?

250
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:47,500
Let me show you!

251
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:53,083
Interesting. And what can you show us?

252
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:00,458
Disassembly-assembly of ak in 20 seconds.

253
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,208
In 20 seconds?

254
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,708
This should be fun.

255
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:12,875
Well,

256
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:15,125
you asked yourself.

257
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:19,625
Come on.

258
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:30,500
Well, warrior... ready?

259
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,250
Well.

260
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:47,708
Come on!

261
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:09,042
Well.

262
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:12,018
Congratulations to private raven...

263
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:13,434
Eighteen seconds!

264
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:14,958
Well done! Bravo!

265
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,875
Well done!

266
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,000
That's what I understand.

267
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,708
Find him one sks.

268
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:46,625
Right turn! March!

269
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:49,667
Right turn! March!

270
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,000
Nobody likes snipers

271
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:56,333
because they are insidious and elegant.

272
00:37:57,125 --> 00:38:01,375
There are no forbidden methods
of waging war for them.

273
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,208
Professional snipers work in disguise
without modern special equipment.

274
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:15,875
Their position
is almost impossible to detect.

275
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:17,708
Especially...

276
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,333
If no shots are heard
or they are hidden under another noise.

277
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:25,292
Excuse me,

278
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:27,958
what does that mean?

279
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,000
In order not to get caught,
the sniper fires his shot

280
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:35,833
during a machine gun fire
or the sound of explosions.

281
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,250
Next!

282
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:47,542
Budkevych.

283
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,417
- Next!
- Dunaevsky.

284
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:09,667
Next!

285
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,750
Voronenko.

286
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,833
Next!

287
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:26,167
- What is this?
- A horse in a coat!

288
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,792
This is sks.
"Simonov's self-loading carbine"!

289
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,375
Next!

290
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:35,292
This is a mistake.

291
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,958
I have to have an svd like everybody else.

292
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:44,583
Dear, no need for songs here!
Is it a circus for you here?

293
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,434
Do I look like a clown?

294
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,208
This is, the fucking, army!

295
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:51,512
Your task is to pick up the fucking gun
and get the fuck out of here!

296
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,083
Can I go?

297
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:59,333
What is this... blaster, fuck!

298
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:02,167
And we are all space pirates here,
for fuck's sake!

299
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:03,708
Don't giggle!

300
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,434
Soldiers, I do not repeat anything twice.

301
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:12,000
Nobody is going to jerk off with you here!

302
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,792
Next!

303
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,250
Look, raven.

304
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,125
Will you give me your blaster for a shot?

305
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:03,250
The basic rule of a sniper is to remain
invisible under any circumstances.

306
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:07,125
If you move, assume you've been killed.

307
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:10,667
Moved.

308
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:12,417
Minus one point.

309
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,500
Minus.

310
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,250
Minus.

311
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,208
Minus.

312
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:47,958
Have a look
at your 1963 dragunov sniper rifle.

313
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:55,500
With its obsolete
7.62 by 54 mm ammunition,

314
00:41:56,458 --> 00:42:00,208
it has a working distance

315
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,042
of approximately 600 meters.

316
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,625
In contrast,

317
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:14,417
modern 8.6 by 70 lapua Magnum

318
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:18,917
or 12.7 by 99 bmg...

319
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:23,458
Rifles hit targets...

320
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,750
Even at 2,000 meters.

321
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,833
And how far does your rifle shoot?

322
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:37,958
Remington 308 caliber
has a working distance of...

323
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:43,333
About 800 meters.

324
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,333
And if the enemy has a better shot?

325
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,583
Then you are unlucky.

326
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:56,208
This is called a ballistic vulnerability.

327
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,083
But it's not a rifle
that makes a sniper dangerous...

328
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:05,583
But his intelligence and endurance.

329
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:09,042
The next task...

330
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:11,542
Be ready.

331
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:16,333
The sniper must always be stable
and focused.

332
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:18,292
Charge!

333
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:22,167
Take aim.

334
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:27,208
Ready.

335
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:32,292
One, two, three... fire!

336
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:38,042
Plus.

337
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:44,208
Ready.

338
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,958
One, two, three... fire!

339
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:53,167
Plus.

340
00:43:57,958 --> 00:43:58,958
Ready.

341
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:02,667
One, two, three... fire!

342
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:07,458
Minus.

343
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:10,083
It's not possible with such a firearm!

344
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,167
Some succeeded.

345
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:19,125
One of the important skills a sniper

346
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:21,809
has to have is the ability to be able
to calculate quickly in your head.

347
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:23,753
Your eyes will be occupied
with observing things.

348
00:44:23,917 --> 00:44:25,458
Forget about the calculator.

349
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,792
To determine the distance,

350
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:30,833
you must multiply
the size of the object by 1000

351
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:33,917
and divide by the number
of points in sight.

352
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,583
So the task is to determine
the distance to the kamaz.

353
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,000
The height of the kamaz is 3.45...

354
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:45,625
And has seven points,

355
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,217
the height
of the armored personnel carrier...

356
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:51,125
Is 2.35...

357
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:55,167
And has 2.5 points.

358
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:57,500
Tank width...

359
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:00,917
3.46...

360
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:02,625
Allow me...

361
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,583
Is something unclear, raven?

362
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:08,333
- I want to give the answer.
- Try it.

363
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,875
Distance to kamaz is 493 meters.

364
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,958
That's right.

365
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,750
940 meters and 804 and a half.

366
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,650
To the armored personnel carrier
and to the tank accordingly.

367
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:32,958
Not bad, raven.

368
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:14,208
Before the shot,
everyone should call his code out loud.

369
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:16,417
"Code green" for I can shoot.

370
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,167
"Code red" for I can't shoot.

371
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:21,208
Get ready!

372
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:23,875
Attention!

373
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:25,833
Three,

374
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:28,000
two, one...

375
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,667
Code green.

376
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:34,542
Code green.

377
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:41,042
Bob, minus.

378
00:46:41,417 --> 00:46:42,417
Bad, plus.

379
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:44,292
Yartur, plus.

380
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:45,375
Klym, plus.

381
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:46,833
Mor, minus.

382
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:48,375
Dunay, plus.

383
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,250
Raven, minus...

384
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:53,750
Exam completed.
Discharge everyone's weapons.

385
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,333
Raven, haven't you heard the command?

386
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:12,458
The exam is not over yet.

387
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:15,042
Why is that?

388
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,917
I didn't shoot.

389
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:22,125
Are you going to wait for dawn?

390
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,333
The code is green!

391
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:29,542
Wow, holy blaster!

392
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,000
Plus three, raven.

393
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:43,875
Thank you for waiting.

394
00:47:47,292 --> 00:47:48,167
Klym!

395
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,250
Yes sir!

396
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:50,833
Second-class.

397
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:52,792
Congratulations.

398
00:47:53,292 --> 00:47:55,042
I serve the Ukrainian people!

399
00:47:58,708 --> 00:47:59,583
Dunay!

400
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:00,667
Yes sir!

401
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:03,083
Third-class. Congratulations.

402
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:05,417
I serve the Ukrainian people!

403
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:09,458
Raven!

404
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:10,542
Yes sir!

405
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:11,708
First-class.

406
00:48:13,167 --> 00:48:14,167
Congratulations.

407
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,625
I serve the Ukrainian people!

408
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:22,083
- Bad!
- Yes sir!

409
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,458
Second-class. Congratulations...

410
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:32,125
Tell me, why did this happen?

411
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:39,750
Why is it that my world
is not enough for your world?

412
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:47,792
The two of us touched for a moment

413
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:56,792
and time passes us by craftily

414
00:48:57,917 --> 00:49:03,750
nobody knows where to go now

415
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:12,625
nobody is waiting at home

416
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,417
dive in, love your will

417
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:28,458
but don't get lost in the pain

418
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:36,667
and awaken, awaken strength in yourself

419
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:44,458
build strength in yourself

420
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:52,125
my dear, my dear...

421
00:49:53,417 --> 00:50:00,417
I wish we had wings...

422
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,167
We need to go to the zero line
to our positions.

423
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,130
Here they captured our checkpoint
on the bridge.

424
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,708
I don't have enough people...

425
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:23,958
We need to clean up
before they get strengthened.

426
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:27,125
What do they have?

427
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:31,000
No armor, nothing heavy. We'll handle it.

428
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:33,625
And the machine gunners?

429
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:37,167
Pokemon and rpk.

430
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:42,542
Okay, take the snipers and assault team.

431
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:44,417
Plus.

432
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,833
Plus.

433
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:58,667
- Hello, guys.
- We wish you good health!

434
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:02,500
- Voron...
- Aye, sir.

435
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:04,167
Pack up your staff.

436
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:07,667
Yes, sir, lieutenant colonel.

437
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,458
Third in position.

438
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:50,917
First in position.

439
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:55,292
The second is ready.

440
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:12,958
What is the distance?

441
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:17,500
400 meters.

442
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:24,208
Two up.

443
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:38,208
Your machine gunner is on the left,

444
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:42,083
I'm working on the right.

445
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,333
Plus.

446
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:52,125
Ready.

447
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:58,708
Prepared.

448
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:01,042
Countdown.

449
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:03,708
Plus.

450
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Two,

451
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
one...

452
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,042
- Car on 9!
- Stop!

453
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:18,208
Cap, machine. Two civilians.

454
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,250
Get out of the car!

455
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,250
Documents.

456
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:56,250
- Give me my passport!
- Watch your hands, bitch!

457
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,625
Wait.

458
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,250
Plus.

459
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:26,083
Attention!

460
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:31,667
Countdown.

461
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:34,583
Three...

462
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:36,667
Two...

463
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:38,708
One!

464
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:52,560
Contact.

465
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:53,934
Get back, bitch!

466
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,167
The target
is a militant behind the hostage.

467
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:01,708
I operate near the hostage.

468
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:17,417
Lie down, stupid!

469
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:21,458
Hit. Clean!

470
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,958
Congratulations
on your first successful task.

471
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,500
Clean!

472
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:30,792
Come on.

473
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:53,667
Hello guys.

474
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,542
- Congratulations, boys!
- Hello.

475
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,458
- Are klym and dunay here?
- I am not sure.

476
00:57:12,542 --> 00:57:13,542
Bad!

477
00:57:14,542 --> 00:57:15,583
Hello.

478
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:16,667
Where are klym and dunay?

479
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:18,708
On the mission.

480
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,458
Dunay“.

481
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:14,375
Where is klym?

482
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:01,375
What did you find out?

483
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,833
The medic said that the bullet
in klym's body opened like a flower,

484
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:11,583
some fragments passed through,

485
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:14,833
and others got stuck in the armor plate.

486
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:19,792
The guy had no chance.

487
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:24,417
The vehicle breaks through,

488
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,833
what can we say about the body...

489
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:30,042
They want to demoralize us.

490
01:03:36,667 --> 01:03:37,833
So that's it.

491
01:03:39,542 --> 01:03:42,417
We need to quickly occupy
our trench at the zero line,

492
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,833
where ours were evacuated.

493
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:49,893
Take a detour along this forest strip,
the drg enemy was noticed here.

494
01:03:49,917 --> 01:03:52,042
I'll give you an assault group to cover.

495
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:53,726
As you occupy the trench,

496
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,976
keep an eye
on their positions here, nearby.

497
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,667
Just be careful,

498
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:01,625
there may be a sniper somewhere.

499
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:03,708
If it's clean,

500
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:05,855
I'll send a company to strengthen it.

501
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:08,708
Follow.

502
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:10,833
Plus.

503
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:18,917
Cossacks, five minutes left.

504
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:17,917
Report...

505
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:20,500
First clear.

506
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:22,125
Plus.

507
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:29,917
Distance 120.

508
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:32,875
Plus.

509
01:06:51,917 --> 01:06:55,518
Cap, third post. I see a group of five.

510
01:06:55,542 --> 01:07:01,250
Russian uniform, confidently going
on the green to meet you, do you Roger?

511
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:02,625
Plus.

512
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:06,125
The goal will be in 25.

513
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,500
Twenty...

514
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:15,500
Fifteen...

515
01:07:18,917 --> 01:07:19,958
Ten,

516
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:21,792
nine...

517
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:23,167
Ivan?

518
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Six,

519
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
five,

520
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:29,000
four,

521
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,375
three,

522
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:33,167
two,

523
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:34,917
one.

524
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:36,333
Fire!

525
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:51,458
Good job.

526
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:59,458
- We're done, finish it.
- Plus-plus.

527
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:15,375
Who is Ivan?

528
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:19,958
My former student from horlivka.

529
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,333
He made his choice.

530
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,083
As did I...

531
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,625
Huh, yeah. Piece of shit.

532
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:05,625
So what's up?

533
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:10,292
Stretches checked.

534
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:13,750
It will not be possible
to climb through quietly.

535
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:28,125
Who is in the photo?

536
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:31,042
Family.

537
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:33,542
Can I have a look?

538
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:40,000
My wife svitlana

539
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,417
and daughters, vika and myroslava.

540
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:47,233
Do the kids know where you are now?

541
01:10:51,417 --> 01:10:52,977
They think that I'm on a business trip.

542
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,500
My wife and I agreed that
if they know less, they will sleep better.

543
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:02,125
That's why she's worried
about everyone there.

544
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:06,208
Got it.

545
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:25,208
Is this your amulet?

546
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:39,083
This is my...

547
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:41,667
Family.

548
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:03,542
Their positions are here.

549
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:06,434
Keep an eye on them.

550
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:07,583
Yes, I understand. Crystal.

551
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:20,625
Yes, of course, Nikolai ivanych,

552
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:23,125
we will do everything, don't worry.

553
01:12:23,833 --> 01:12:25,458
On the other side, we need more.

554
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:31,792
Five minutes. Come on, come on.

555
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:33,208
Understood, I'm working.

556
01:12:34,292 --> 01:12:35,976
Are the weapons checked?

557
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,125
Batteries, walkie-talkies,

558
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:38,500
- first aid kits.
- We have it!

559
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:39,602
Everything is there!

560
01:12:39,626 --> 01:12:40,768
Take off the flag, fuck...

561
01:12:40,792 --> 01:12:45,708
- Exactly! Shoot, bro!
- Come on.

562
01:12:46,042 --> 01:12:48,750
Just cut the normal branches,
why are you dragging this shit.

563
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:55,292
Here they have two.

564
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:58,167
Here is a machine gun and a sniper pair.

565
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:01,184
- Will you cover-up?
- Yeah.

566
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:02,625
Do you need an assistant?

567
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:05,042
I'll handle it.

568
01:13:05,917 --> 01:13:08,059
- Everything is ready.
- Let's get everyone inside.

569
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:12,083
- Get inside!
- Start engine!

570
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:18,167
- Start engine!
- Let's go!

571
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:55,125
At 11 o'clock there is a car.

572
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:58,750
I see.

573
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:05,833
Two militants near the car.

574
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,625
Continue observation.

575
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:46,042
A fighter with a machine gun.

576
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:52,292
The code is green. I can work!

577
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:54,875
I do not allow you to.

578
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:56,958
Keep observing.

579
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:01,250
A fighter with a machine gun.

580
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:04,643
The code is green. I can work!

581
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:06,875
Put on the fuse!

582
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,750
A fighter with a machine gun!
The code is green! I'm shooting!

583
01:16:12,792 --> 01:16:14,958
Put on the safety. That is an order!

584
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:19,417
Motherfucker!

585
01:16:42,417 --> 01:16:43,625
I have 200!

586
01:17:22,083 --> 01:17:23,958
Sniper at 10 o'clock!

587
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:35,125
Sniper! On the tenth! Distance 2,000.

588
01:17:41,542 --> 01:17:42,917
The first minus.

589
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,833
Second in the sector k4.

590
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:48,958
Yes. We are working.

591
01:19:36,417 --> 01:19:37,958
I asked at the top...

592
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:45,750
Secret services will look
for the killer of the cap.

593
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:53,208
When there is information,

594
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:55,625
I'll call you

595
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,708
and you will deal with it.

596
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:06,167
Do you understand?

597
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:21,583
Dismissed.

598
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,500
Captain...

599
01:21:04,792 --> 01:21:05,792
It's time for us.

600
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:19,833
Yakut.

601
01:22:21,208 --> 01:22:22,208
What do you have?

602
01:22:23,458 --> 01:22:24,708
How long will I be lying here?

603
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:27,292
I won't be able
to wash off this shit for a week.

604
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:35,708
Be patient, makar.
You will lie in my shit all my life.

605
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:38,708
Fuck off.

606
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:02,083
I waved everything.

607
01:23:41,792 --> 01:23:45,333
I will crawl to you.

608
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:05,250
Makar, respond.

609
01:24:13,625 --> 01:24:17,500
Fuck. Where are you, have you fallen?

610
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:22,250
You, bitch.

611
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:09,333
The third-largest nuclear arsenal

612
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:12,667
in the world.

613
01:25:13,417 --> 01:25:16,417
And in 1994 a memorandum was signed

614
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,583
between Ukraine, Russia,
Great Britain, and the usa...

615
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:20,667
That's right.

616
01:25:20,708 --> 01:25:26,000
The memorandum on non-proliferation
guaranteed Ukraine's independence,

617
01:25:26,083 --> 01:25:28,833
sovereignty, and borders.

618
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:33,292
We all know how Russia respects
the borders of other states...

619
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:36,917
So the solution to this problem...

620
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:15,667
Brigade commander

621
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:22,726
Speaking.

622
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,417
It lit up near horlivka.

623
01:26:25,417 --> 01:26:27,167
He fired two of our scouts.

624
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:31,292
Was it in a wide range?

625
01:26:31,792 --> 01:26:32,625
Yes.

626
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:35,625
The first, two days ago.
The second, today.

627
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:37,393
From one position?

628
01:26:37,417 --> 01:26:41,667
Not by the phone.
At the meeting. Get ready.

629
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,250
ID?

630
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:13,625
Drive.

631
01:28:13,833 --> 01:28:14,917
Open it.

632
01:28:42,792 --> 01:28:45,917
Code name elbrus, second-class.

633
01:28:46,542 --> 01:28:47,542
Congratulations.

634
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:53,750
- Beast, third-class, congratulations.
- Yeah.

635
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,667
- Ray, third-class...
- Yes.

636
01:28:58,458 --> 01:28:59,458
Congratulations.

637
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:04,417
- Congratulations.
- I serve the Ukrainian people!

638
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:07,208
- How are you?
- Alive.

639
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:11,958
Got you this.

640
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:14,917
Thank you.

641
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:28,458
- Hello!
- Hi!

642
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:35,667
Cadets, at ease.
Grab your stuff and get in the car.

643
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:38,250
Raven“.

644
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,000
- Ready?
- Yes sir.

645
01:29:44,458 --> 01:29:45,458
Follow me.

646
01:29:51,375 --> 01:29:52,375
Attention to all.

647
01:29:53,375 --> 01:29:55,495
Recently, intelligence provided us
with information...

648
01:29:56,667 --> 01:29:57,708
Show the slide.

649
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,833
Russian sniper. Call sign "sery".

650
01:30:02,917 --> 01:30:07,125
Works with 12.7 over long distances,
mostly 1.5 km.

651
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:10,292
The bullets are wide-ranging.

652
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:15,375
He has already killed five of our snipers
and three machine gunners.

653
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:17,958
Show the site.

654
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:22,518
He publishes his videos to demoralize us.

655
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:26,184
In one of these videos, is our cap.

656
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:27,208
Shit!

657
01:30:28,083 --> 01:30:29,708
Yesterday our sniper

658
01:30:29,792 --> 01:30:31,875
was killed by the same bullet
between armor plates

659
01:30:31,958 --> 01:30:33,792
near a chemical plant next to the river.

660
01:30:34,667 --> 01:30:37,125
Today was the same,
they hit in the same sector.

661
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:38,833
They didn't change position?

662
01:30:39,792 --> 01:30:41,458
Cover it with mines.

663
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:43,042
It won't work.

664
01:30:44,292 --> 01:30:46,375
Raven, you are a local,
explain to the guys.

665
01:30:47,792 --> 01:30:50,458
There is a chlorine storage under pressure
in the chemical plant.

666
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:54,958
Well, fuck them.
Ptur him to the damn mother.

667
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:58,542
- Explosion of cylinders is guaranteed.
- So what?

668
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:01,333
Environmental disaster.

669
01:31:01,417 --> 01:31:02,417
Fuck.

670
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:05,207
Is that clear to everyone?

671
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:09,833
The plan is as follows. Map.

672
01:31:11,292 --> 01:31:13,412
There are a total of eight militants
on the territory.

673
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:15,393
The sniper himself is probably
in a building

674
01:31:15,417 --> 01:31:17,018
where there are warehouses with chlorine.

675
01:31:17,042 --> 01:31:19,708
Plus two of his observers
are probably on the floors.

676
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:21,500
So,

677
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:26,375
the first pair of snipers
takes the first fighter.

678
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:31,125
The second and third are these targets.

679
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,917
The fourth and fifth are these two.

680
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:35,833
And the final targets,

681
01:31:36,667 --> 01:31:38,042
two observers...

682
01:31:39,292 --> 01:31:40,375
And sery.

683
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:45,167
What's the point? Anyway, we cannot
shoot this chlorine under pressure.

684
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,500
Our task is to clear the access only.

685
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:51,708
And then what?

686
01:31:55,917 --> 01:31:57,625
Then raven climbs up to him.

687
01:32:06,333 --> 01:32:07,333
Questions?

688
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:11,292
Get ready.

689
01:32:57,667 --> 01:32:59,125
Raven, status.

690
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:05,125
Three hours.

691
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:08,083
Plus.

692
01:33:54,375 --> 01:33:55,417
First.

693
01:33:58,292 --> 01:33:59,458
In position.

694
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:02,750
Second.

695
01:34:04,417 --> 01:34:05,667
In position.

696
01:35:06,083 --> 01:35:07,500
Raven, status...

697
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:16,000
In position...

698
01:35:39,917 --> 01:35:41,167
Ah, pacifist...

699
01:35:42,125 --> 01:35:44,708
I should have shot you then...

700
01:35:57,083 --> 01:35:58,958
- Clear.
- Plus.

701
01:36:11,083 --> 01:36:13,375
Attention, readiness. Report...

702
01:36:13,542 --> 01:36:15,042
First ready.

703
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:22,042
Second ready.

704
01:36:22,833 --> 01:36:24,417
Third ready.

705
01:36:30,083 --> 01:36:31,167
Fifth ready...

706
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,333
I see the target, the code is green.

707
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:41,667
Countdown...

708
01:36:42,208 --> 01:36:43,042
Five,

709
01:36:43,208 --> 01:36:44,144
four,

710
01:36:44,168 --> 01:36:45,226
three,

711
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:46,268
two,

712
01:36:46,292 --> 01:36:47,292
one.

713
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:03,833
Whose fire?

714
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:07,833
Fuck if I know.
The moron is watering somewhere.

715
01:37:22,333 --> 01:37:23,333
Report!

716
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:24,958
Clear.

717
01:37:25,792 --> 01:37:27,875
- Raven, work.
- Plus.

718
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:43,292
First.

719
01:37:44,417 --> 01:37:45,792
First.

720
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:49,375
Second.

721
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:51,208
In place.

722
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,208
Report.

723
01:37:53,833 --> 01:37:55,042
Group, report...

724
01:37:55,917 --> 01:37:57,167
Group, report.

725
01:37:58,875 --> 01:38:00,375
Group, report.

726
01:38:10,625 --> 01:38:14,125
- There is no connection with the group.
- Second, report to me.

727
01:39:02,625 --> 01:39:03,750
Seryl

728
01:39:21,833 --> 01:39:23,917
- Hold your position!
- Yes.

729
01:39:50,417 --> 01:39:51,500
Fuck.

730
01:39:52,292 --> 01:39:54,458
- Second...
- In place.

731
01:39:58,083 --> 01:40:00,208

- Affirmative.

732
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,893
- I have one 200.
- What happened?

733
01:40:04,917 --> 01:40:06,083
Sniper.

734
01:40:11,625 --> 01:40:14,101
Clear. What about the security group?

735
01:40:14,125 --> 01:40:15,559
No connection.

736
01:40:15,583 --> 01:40:19,125
Got it. Ten minutes. Hold your position.

737
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:22,208
Yes.

738
01:40:26,792 --> 01:40:27,833
Second.

739
01:40:28,708 --> 01:40:29,708
In place.

740
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:32,292
Return to your position
and guard the entrance.

741
01:40:32,375 --> 01:40:33,375
Yes.

742
01:42:16,833 --> 01:42:17,833
Fuck”.

743
01:43:03,833 --> 01:43:05,333
Sery. Do you copy?

744
01:43:08,417 --> 01:43:10,643
Sery, arrived with a group. Do you copy?

745
01:43:10,667 --> 01:43:13,500
You shit bags will answer us for crime a.

746
01:43:52,083 --> 01:43:53,792
- Clean.
- Clean.

747
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,750
Raven, the perimeter is clean.

748
01:43:58,083 --> 01:43:59,083
Plus.

749
01:45:52,667 --> 01:45:54,167
Let him stay with me...

750
01:47:00,583 --> 01:47:02,500
Guide your hand, lord,

751
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,583
to destroy all enemies...

752
01:47:07,125 --> 01:47:08,792
On this land.

752
01:47:09,305 --> 01:48:09,535
