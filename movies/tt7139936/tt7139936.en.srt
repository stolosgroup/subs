13
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,250
This is Yardley.

14
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,754
Which is supposed to be
a very good liberal art school.

15
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,351
Definitely tonguey
enough for my mother.

16
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:32,409
With its beautiful rural campus.

17
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:36,897
Which is total bullshit, because
you get ticks, walking in the grass.

18
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:41,368
Yardley is more structured
than the first college I went to.

19
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:46,790
I lasted a few months at one of those
serious Ivy League sudo intellectual joints,

20
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:50,752
which my mother thought would
give me an "appropriate" education.

21
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:54,548
She says I have a high IQ, and
I'm not living up to my potential.

22
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:58,324
Even though last weekend I
made 20 grand playing poker.

23
00:01:58,467 --> 00:01:59,726
But I'll get to that.

24
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,117
Yardley is where I met
Ashleigh, from a school paper.

25
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:05,867
That's my girlfriend - Ashleigh Enright.

26
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:08,329
My dad knew one of her
father's banks in Arizona.

27
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,427
And naturally, with
those family credentials,

28
00:02:10,427 --> 00:02:13,407
my mother wants us to
get married, sight unseen.

29
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:15,554
It's the one area I
agree on with my mother.

30
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:18,100
Because even though we've
only been going out for a few months.

31
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,154
I'm hopelessly in 
love with Ashleigh.

32
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:23,304
I got an interview
with Roland Pollard.

33
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:26,452
Oh my Gosh, that is amazing.
How did you land that?

34
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:29,371
He has a new movie
coming out this fall.

35
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:31,774
And the assignment originally
went to Priscilla McCain,

36
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:34,548
but she's totally got
mono, so I'm doing it.

37
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:37,035
Mono's like a two
credit chores at the school.

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,507
Listen Ash, I think
this is great for you.

39
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:40,484
When is it?

40
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,058
It's the 28th of this month.
A Saturday.

41
00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:45,018
And it's on campus?

42
00:02:46,478 --> 00:02:49,731
- It's in Manhattan.
- It's in Manhattan, are you serious?

43
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:53,485
This is fantastic, we were always talking
about going into Manhattan for a special weekend.

44
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,192
Look, I'm going to make a
reservation at the Carlyle.

45
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:58,950
It's the place I'm
always telling you about,

46
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,869
with the piano player at the bar,
he sings his old Broadway tunes.

47
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,463
I'll take you up for lunch and
dinner, how does that sound?

48
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:06,804
We go see around city.

49
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:08,202
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

50
00:03:08,457 --> 00:03:10,251
I mean, it will cost a fortune.

51
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:13,754
Relax, I'm loaded, I scored
20 big ones last Sunday.

52
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:17,216
- Not another crap game?
- No, stud poker this time.

53
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:21,095
Sitting there with 3 tens, and some
guy with aces up keeps raising me.

54
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:24,765
How did you get all the money
to play in such a big poker game?

55
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:26,517
My horse came in this weekend.

56
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:28,885
I'm telling you this is
why I have to go to Vegas.

57
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:31,117
I'm a gambler and I don't
know how else to put it.

58
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:34,177
I've always wanted you to
have to show me around Manhattan.

59
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:35,856
This is going to be
absolutely fantastic.

60
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:38,158
I'm going to, maybe, get in
touch with my dad's ticket brocker.

61
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:40,434
He'll get us tickets to
Hamilton, how does that sound?

62
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:43,396
Actually, I don't want all my
parents know I'm in town that weekend.

63
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:45,083
Why not?

64
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,252
My mother is having 
her big annual fall gala,

65
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:49,116
and she's apoplectic 
I'm not coming.

66
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:53,182
I told her I have a major paper due,
otherwise I have to put an appearence.

67
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,140
It's like death.
It's like having ...

68
00:03:55,556 --> 00:03:57,494
Drinks with a hundred
bullshit people,

69
00:03:57,494 --> 00:04:00,247
not one of which has ever
been turned down by a co-op.

70
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,855
I can't believe it.

71
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:06,358
An interview with the
director of "Winter Memories".

72
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:09,201
Didn't we see "Winter Memories"
together on our first date?

73
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:09,944
I think so.

74
00:04:09,944 --> 00:04:11,154
I'm just so excited.

75
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:15,367
You have to help me come up with
the list of profound questions to ask him.

76
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:17,288
I don't want to come
off like a twit.

77
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:18,686
You are not going
to come off like a twit.

78
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,094
Actually, now that
I'm thinking about it.

79
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,289
We can't stay at the Carlyle,
it's too close to my parents house.

80
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,127
But I want you to have a park view.
You know what?

81
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:25,260
We going to stay at the Pierre.

82
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:28,667
That way you can have a park view,
it's a safe distance from my parents house.

83
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:31,400
Then after dinner we're going
to go to the Carlyle, we go to bar,

84
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:32,709
and spend some time there.

85
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:36,921
It's very old New York. I really love it.
The murals are by Ludwig Bemelmans.

86
00:04:39,882 --> 00:04:41,801
I've only been to Manhattan
twice, you know.

87
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:45,012
Once when I was 2, and
then once when I was 12.

88
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,148
All I remember is we
got incredible bargains.

89
00:04:49,315 --> 00:04:51,004
My parents could not
believe that you could buy

90
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:54,167
a Birkin bag and a Rolex
on the blanket off the street.

91
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:55,828
For only 200 dollars.

92
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:09,842
Are there any other questions
you can think of that I can ask him?

93
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:15,223
Find out who influenced
him more on love.

94
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:18,267
Denis de Rougemont
or Ortega y Gasset.

95
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:21,187
How do you always
know all that stuff?

96
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:24,482
I read, I just don't read
what they give us at school.

97
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,694
Do I really care who wins between
Beowulf & Grendel, no I don't.

98
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,197
Maybe if I had a
little money on it.

99
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,242
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

100
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,617
No college reporters
won a Pulitzer, right?

101
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:39,918
I do not think so.

102
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:41,806
You are going to be fine, don't
put so much pressure on yourself.

103
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:42,867
I think it's going to be great.

104
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:45,211
Listen, I want to see the 
Weegee photos at MoMA,

105
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,744
and I booked us a 
dinner at Daniel's.

106
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:49,548
It's kind of a nice place, we can
dress up for it. It would be really nice.

107
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:51,844
And I splurged on
the suite at the Pierre.

108
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:54,639
What the hell, right? It's poker
winnings, it's not even real money.

109
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:10,154
Gatsby, it's beautiful!

110
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:12,114
I wanted to do something special.

111
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,081
The flowers.

112
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:17,863
- That's not me, I don't know what that is.
- Champagne.

113
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:21,467
Look at that view.

114
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:24,121
I wanted it to be high enough
so you could see Central Park.

115
00:06:25,562 --> 00:06:28,734
Central Park.
Exciting.

116
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:31,769
Thank you so much, sir.
I really appreciate that.

117
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,127
Thank you.

118
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,325
Later maybe we could 
take a carriage ride?

119
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:36,963
Yeah.

120
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,096
If it doesn't rain.

121
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,805
We could ride in the rain, it's very moody.
It's very romantic.

122
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:42,578
 I prefer it.

123
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:44,423
What time is it?

124
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:46,129
Yeah we should go, 
this is hotel at downtown.

125
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,466
It might be a 
little bit of a traffic.

126
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,380
- It is far?
- It's in Soho.

127
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:52,627
You are going to like Soho.
It's filled with creative people.

128
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:56,590
Then it got commercially expensive, so all
the creative people moved to Tribeka.

129
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:59,259
And that got expensive,
so they all moved to Brooklyn.

130
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:02,012
Next move is back in
with their parents.

131
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,161
He's only giving me an hour.

132
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,268
It's good, we have a
01:30 lunch reservation.

133
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,866
What are you going
to do while I'm upstairs?

134
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,220
I do not know.

135
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:23,663
Just roam around Soho, 
maybe visit my brother.

136
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,924
I can't say how nice it is that
you're back in the city.

137
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,633
If it weren't for you I don't know if I
would ever find my way back to Yardley.

138
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:32,970
- What would you do?
- Find some brilliant way to ruin my life.

139
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,831
Hi, I'm here for
Mr. Roland Pollard.

140
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,565
Roland, this is Ashleigh
Enright from Yardley.

141
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:43,921
- How do you do?
- Ashleigh, this is Roland.

142
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:47,517
The screening is all set up.
We are running on a really tight schedule.

143
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:52,355
First of all, I'd just like to say that
what an honor this is for me.

144
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:56,651
I just want to say you're by far the most
interesting american director.

145
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:57,861
Thank you.

146
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:00,595
I write in the arts for a paper

147
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:03,596
and I always put you right 
in the class with Renoir and De Sica.

148
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:07,396
I'm surprised to hear that 
someone your age is

149
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:09,157
familiar with 
Renoir and De Sica.

150
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:14,284
Film is my total thing.
I've seen all the american classics.

151
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:17,127
Particularly the europeans.
Kurosawa is my favourite.

152
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:22,375
Technically, he is not european,
technically, he's, obviously, japanese.

153
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:25,420
But you really 
speak to my soul.

154
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:29,173
What college are you from?

155
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,407
Yardley. It's small.

156
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:34,359
I know it well, my first
wife went there.

157
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:36,402
- Really?
- Yes.

158
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,817
Brilliant woman, long blonde hair
and a state of the art overbite.

159
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:45,007
Very sexy.
A philosophy major.

160
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:47,803
To tell you the truth I
didn't deserve her, and

161
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:50,411
I didn't end up with
her either, so ...

162
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:53,449
Well, that's a...

163
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:57,473
Neither, either, nor yawn.

164
00:08:57,473 --> 00:08:58,747
I imagine.

165
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:04,111
I guess, it's probably
more yawn that either.

166
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:06,194
Are you from New York?

167
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:08,504
Tucson, Arizona.

168
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,113
What does your family do?

169
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:12,753
I was afraid you'd ask.

170
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:14,108
My father owns banks.

171
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:15,504
Is that bad?

172
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:18,046
I know what you are thinking.

173
00:09:19,214 --> 00:09:23,093
"Republicans, the one percent".
But we are not.

174
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:28,557
We're just, totally Episcopalians,
who happen to just be rich.

175
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:30,976
That's how my Ashley was.

176
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:33,616
Who's your Ashley?

177
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,201
My first wife.

178
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:39,489
The one with a long blonde hair
and a state of the art overbite.

179
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:42,283
Her name was Ashley?

180
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:44,869
A-S-H-L-E-Y.

181
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:51,000
Mine is A-S-H-L-E-I-G-H.

182
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:53,461
You use a Forbes 500 spelling.

183
00:09:56,381 --> 00:10:00,677
Since this is your first meaningful
assignment, would you like a scoop?

184
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,555
Of?

185
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:09,227
Inside information.
You've heard what the term is.

186
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:11,312
Oh, a scoop!

187
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:17,777
I'd rather share this with you, than
some slick gossip-hungry newspaper.

188
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:19,571
Oh my God.

189
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:26,077
You keep going, I'm liable to have my
famous psychological hiccup fits.

190
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:28,037
When I'm nervous I stammer.

191
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,831
Is this the scoop?

192
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:32,500
No, that's not the scoop.

193
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:36,296
The worst, of course, is
when I'm sexually conflicted.

194
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:38,923
Then I'll hiccup indefinitely.

195
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:44,612
The scoop is -

196
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:47,614
I am not happy 
with this film.

197
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,543
You're not?

198
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,654
I am thinking of quitting, actually.

199
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:54,865
That's the scoop.

200
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:01,872
If I could speak
frankly, Mr. Pollard.

201
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,540
You've never had mass appeal.

202
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:10,070
You're too original.

203
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:14,435
And you've never once made
one single commercial concession.

204
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:18,420
You are a free creative spirit.

205
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:25,594
Like Van Gogh, or
Rothko, or Virginia Woolf.

206
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,849
Of course, they
all committed suicide.

207
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,811
It's a very sweet
thing to say, actually.

208
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:36,777
You should read me on you.

209
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:39,921
I wrote that your 
best work is yet to come.

210
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:45,194
It's only in, Yardley Argus,
but we have a good circulation.

211
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:47,376
You think that my best
work is yet to come?

212
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:49,170
I do.

213
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:52,298
And I haven't seen your
new film, but I'm willing to bet...

214
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:53,341
Would you like to?

215
00:11:55,051 --> 00:11:56,344
I'd love to.

216
00:11:57,094 --> 00:12:01,015
I know how secretive you are.
Which I, totally, respect.

217
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:03,282
What are you doing now?

218
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:04,371
Now?

219
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:08,125
Yes now. I'm screening it
for Ted Davidoff, who did the script.

220
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:12,929
I know who he is, he writes
all your movies, he's a genious.

221
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:15,431
The screening has
some last minute changes.

222
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,033
Face saving changes.

223
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:18,868
How long does it run?

224
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:22,330
I guess I could shift
my lunch plans.

225
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:27,668
One thing about New York City -
you are here or you are nowhere.

226
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:33,132
You cannot achieve this level of anxiety,
hostility and paranoia anywhere else.

227
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:34,717
It's really exhilarating.

228
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:39,952
Anyhow, I decided to treat 
myself to a cigarette holder,

229
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:41,283
which makes me look dapper

230
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:44,209
and serves the double duty 
of delaying the inevitable onset

231
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:45,905
of cancer or emphysema.

232
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,569
I smoke too much.

233
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,914
So then who do I meet, 
but one of the most obnoxious

234
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:54,289
and revolting characters 
from my high school.

235
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,115
Welles?
Hey.

236
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,224
Troller.

237
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,446
I heard that you 
flanked out of freshman year.

238
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,222
No, I didn't flunk out, 
I transferred up to Yardley,

239
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:05,426
because the first place 
I tried was too unstructured.

240
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,099
They word around is flunked.

241
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:08,924
No.

242
00:13:09,512 --> 00:13:11,681
Where the hell is Yardley,
Afghanistan?

243
00:13:12,307 --> 00:13:13,422
Upstate.

244
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:15,159
- Have you heard about Finletter?
- No.

245
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:18,105
He got thrown out of Princeton
for passing bed checks.

246
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,608
- No, I didn't hear about that.
- The big deal.

247
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:23,778
Because of his father he's
got like the all-time golden parachute.

248
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,239
He could commit mass murder and he'd
still have a cushy job waiting for him.

249
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,910
- It's a weird way to put it.
- And Millstein is marrying Carol Durand.

250
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,164
Which, I'll never understand,
because she resembles Yasser Arafat.

251
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,583
Not to mention she's an Ice Queen.

252
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,127
You can't believe everything.

253
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:41,640
What are you doing in town?

254
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,779
It's my girlfriend, I'm just showing 
her around for the weekend.

255
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:47,376
- Who is your girlfriend?
- You wouldn't know her.

256
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:49,211
But she's got a 
name, hasn't she?

257
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:51,838
Ashleigh.

258
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,951
Like Ashley Wilkes
in "Gone with the Wind"?

259
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,106
That whimp.

260
00:13:58,286 --> 00:13:59,371
What about Josh Loomis?

261
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,457
I just saw Josh.
He's shooting a movie at Minetta.

262
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,002
- A movie?
- It's his student film.

263
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,922
NYU project, it looked
completely stupid to me.

264
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,714
You should stop by.

265
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:13,348
He's with Evans 
and the younger Tyrell.

266
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:17,778
You've always liked Josh.
That turned into a classic whimp.

267
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:22,032
Did you say Amy's younger sister is there?
Is Amy there?

268
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,078
Amy is at Vassar.
Big deal. I'm impressed.

269
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:30,540
Flat-chested.
Like two dimes on a hanging board.

270
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:34,586
- Amy was beautiful.
- Yeah, if you like Grace Kelly.

271
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:37,297
What are you in town for?

272
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:41,259
My girlfriend, she has an interview
with Roland Pollard for the school paper.

273
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:42,636
Who's that?

274
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:47,182
It's a director. He did
"Winter Memories", "Moonlight".

275
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:49,851
Oh yeah! 
I can't stand his flicks.

276
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:55,440
All that whimpy emotional probing,
and never a single decent toilet joke.

277
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:59,929
You should go and watch them shoot.
You could be in it.

278
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,907
They're looking for volunteers.

279
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:05,999
With that cigarette holder you
could be the perfect milk toast nerd.

280
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,960
I'm running a little bit late.

281
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:14,508
I wouldn't trust my girl with
a big time Hollywood director.

282
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:16,635
Good to know.

283
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:19,763
- You didn't ask me what I am doing.
- What are you doing?

284
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:21,878
I'm only pre-med.

285
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,461
We have paw at 
the boarding of Grenada.

286
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,363
I can't make lunch.

287
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,889
What? Why not?

288
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:31,459
- I have to see his film.
- You do?

289
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,281
It's an unbelievable opportunity.

290
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,909
And then we're going to 
discuss it after and everything.

291
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:39,036
How did this develop?
I though you just had an hour with him.

292
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:41,430
So did I, but then he 
started opening up to me.

293
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,422
He did?

294
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,079
He is going through 
this real artistic crisis.

295
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:47,148
There's a real story here.

296
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:48,898
We have a lunch reservation.

297
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,254
You wouldn't want me to
say no to the screening?

298
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:56,781
I am here for work.
We'll have plenty of time.

299
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,211
When? The film's going
to take a couple of hours.

300
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:00,795
I mean.

301
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:04,258
It's 1 now, the movie 
will probably be over around 3

302
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,070
and then I'll have all afternoon.

303
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:07,948
How did you get friendly so fast?

304
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:12,536
He's going through this
whole self-sabotage trip.

305
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:15,709
It's a scoop.

306
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:17,426
Is that him?

307
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:19,221
Yes.

308
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,015
He's a little older
looking than I thought.

309
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:28,663
It's a good look though, 
don't you think?

310
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,085
He is a sufferer.

311
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,067
So what, what's so great 
about suffering?

312
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:36,738
You should hear him talk
about the arts, he's so passionate.

313
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:39,992
I can see how all of his leading
ladies fall in love with him.

314
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:41,785
Do you want me 
to meet him?

315
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:44,830
- I wouldn't want you to spook him.
- It's okay.

316
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,150
No, he's a very private person.
And distraught.

317
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,070
I'll see you later and
I'll meet you back at Carlyle at 3.

318
00:16:52,237 --> 00:16:54,197
It's the Pierre.
The Carlyle is tonight.

319
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:01,621
What the hell is it about older guys
that seem so appealing to women.

320
00:17:02,372 --> 00:17:06,835
All they are is decrepit.
What is sexy about short-term memory loss?

321
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:09,233
I never want to get old.

322
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:12,230
Of course, with my smoking 
habit, I'll be spitting blood at 40.

323
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,878
If she's going to get 
some big inside news story,

324
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:19,215
she has to put in 
time with this guy.

325
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:21,321
Meanwhile, it's going to rain soon.

326
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:24,261
Gatsby!

327
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,008
Josh.

328
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:27,927
How are you man?

329
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:29,549
- It's nice to see you.
- It's good to see you.

330
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,091
I just ran into Alman Troller.

331
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,939
He told me you were 
shooting a short film down here,

332
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:34,318
I thought I'd stop 
by and say hi.

333
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,903
It's just my mid-term project, 
it's nothing big actually.

334
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:38,132
How's Yardley, 
is that where you are?

335
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:39,926
It's okay, I'm not really 
liking it too much,

336
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,718
I'd rather be going 
to school in the city, but...

337
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:43,790
You know my mother. 
If it's not the perfect image,

338
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,088
she bites down that cyanide capsule 
she keeps for special emergencies.

339
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:48,429
I didn't know that.

340
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:49,764
The only thing I remember 
about them is

341
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:52,006
 that they had that 
fundraiser for Jeb Bush, right?

342
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:53,423
- Right.
- Right.

343
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:56,788
So listen, how are you? 
How's life?

344
00:17:57,373 --> 00:17:59,291
What's going on here? 
What are you doing here?

345
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,336
You know, just out here trying
to create modern film-noir classic.

346
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:03,638
Okay, alright.

347
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:05,112
- Do you want to be in it?
- No.

348
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:06,711
- Come on, man.
- No.

349
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:10,102
We're just light on extras, we
have all those people who never showed.

350
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:11,510
You wouldn't have
to talk or anything.

351
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,937
Seriously, you just 
get in the car,

352
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:15,010
and then on action you 
let the girl out, that's it.

353
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,502
- Okay, I don't have to talk?
- None. Zero words.

354
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:20,251
- I can handle that.
- Okay, there you go.

355
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:21,590
You remember Chan, don't you?

356
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,010
- Chan Tyrell.
- Hi.

357
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:27,347
- You're Amy's little sister, right?
- Good to see you.

358
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:30,892
- Should we do this?
- Yeah, go in there.

359
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:33,728
I like that coat, actually,
no, keep that on.

360
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:36,856
Listen, I hear your older
sister's at Vassar now, right?

361
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:39,265
Yeah, political science major.

362
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:40,179
Can you believe it?

363
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:42,948
I mean Amy never heard 
the news that Lincoln was shot.

364
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:45,097
Chan Tyrell.
This is insane.

365
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,962
You were a little girl, and now
you are, actually, a young woman.

366
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,715
You are not going to
start singing Gigi, are you?

367
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:54,128
- I'm not going to start singing...
- So here's the story.

368
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:56,608
She is totally mad with
loss and she can't let go off you.

369
00:18:57,576 --> 00:18:59,911
She kisses you and then
she bursts away.

370
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,220
Chan Tyrell.

371
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:05,049
Incidentally, I apologise in
advance for ruining your scene.

372
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,944
- I'm not an actor.
- I'm not an actress either.

373
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:09,448
I'm just helping out a friend.

374
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,574
And we kiss?

375
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,243
Yeah, that's why I never
wanted to be an actress.

376
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,706
You have to fake passion
with all kinds of weirdos.

377
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:20,459
- Thank you.
- Nevermind.

378
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,837
Just kiss me so I can
really feel it in my toes.

379
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:26,965
I used to kiss your older sister, did
she ever say anything about that or no?

380
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:30,636
I don't know, I don't recall.
I think maybe she said you were a 4.

381
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,181
- A 4? She said I was a 4?
- I don't know, maybe a 6.

382
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:39,186
Maybe a 6, I can't recall.
Just this kiss, I want it to be hot.

383
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,189
If we are going to do it,
let's do it right.

384
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,483
- Good work ethic.
- Thank you.

385
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:47,611
Action.

386
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,037
Cut.

387
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,831
Are you going to
keep your mouth closed?

388
00:20:00,874 --> 00:20:03,181
I have a girlfriend, Chan.
I don't think I can do this.

389
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,347
I'm sorry, I think I froze.

390
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:07,935
You have a girlfriend?
Who's your girlfriend?

391
00:20:08,144 --> 00:20:09,986
Her name is Ashleigh, 
she's from Yardley.

392
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,790
She's from Tuscon originally.

393
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,514
Tuscon? You are dating 
a girl from Arizona?

394
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:15,828
Do I have your permission?

395
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,711
What do you guys 
talk about, cactuses?

396
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,104
Rattlesnakes.

397
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:23,272
Arizona? That would be 
great for your asthma.

398
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,221
I don't have asthma.

399
00:20:26,295 --> 00:20:29,006
When we were kissing, I
thought I heard you wheezing.

400
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:31,925
I always remembered
you as a very snotty kid.

401
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:34,251
Ready?

402
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,545
What are you up to now?

403
00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:39,924
- I am studying design at a fashion Institute.
- That's unique.

404
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:41,133
Rolling.

405
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:43,928
Scene 19, take 2.

406
00:20:45,054 --> 00:20:46,013
Action.

407
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:53,104
Cut.
That's better.

408
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:55,835
Josh, he's way too uptight 
to open up his mouth.

409
00:20:55,974 --> 00:20:57,268
Are you still 
seeing that shrink?

410
00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:59,158
Give me a break, alright?
I was just taking a walk.

411
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,956
He asked me to help out, alright? 
I've never acted before.

412
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:05,282
- Scene 19, take 3.
- Action.

413
00:21:10,248 --> 00:21:11,874
Josh, it's starting to rain.

414
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:18,840
And cut. Great.

415
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:23,136
See, I knew you could do it.
And I won't tell your girlfriend.

416
00:21:23,928 --> 00:21:25,517
Josh, you like it, you 
want a different version?

417
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,121
- I can...
- No, we go with that version.

418
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:28,576
That's the version, 
we're sticking with that.

419
00:21:28,576 --> 00:21:30,136
Alright, well, have 
fun in Arizona.

420
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,451
And whatever you do, don't 
get lost in a desert and die of thirst.

421
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,127
I'll be sure to 
bring a canteen.

422
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,005
Don't fall in the Grand Canyon
too, it's really deep.

423
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:49,840
She's always been the 
pain in the ass, kid sister.

424
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:51,087
How could she not be?

425
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:53,923
Amy was gorgeous, and so
sexually advanced.

426
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:57,176
Word on Amy was she performed
an oral sex at the bar mitzvah.

427
00:21:57,635 --> 00:21:59,784
Maybe they should make that 
a part of every jewish holiday.

428
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:01,288
Certainly beats fasting.

429
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:05,025
It's also a great way to celebrate the
Jewish New Year, what a great Hanukah gift.

430
00:22:07,777 --> 00:22:09,500
I wonder what's 
been bothering Hunter.

431
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:12,385
Something was definitely 
on his mind when I called him.

432
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:20,383
- Gatsby!
- Surprise.

433
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,678
- I told you I might drop in.
- That's crazy!

434
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:25,305
Listen, if you have something
to do I can come back...

435
00:22:25,472 --> 00:22:28,141
- No, I have nothing to do.
- Good to see you.

436
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:29,669
How are you?

437
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:33,242
- I'm good, you?
- Good.

438
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:35,270
Are you coming 
for Mom's party?

439
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,347
No, you can't tell 
her I'm here, okay?

440
00:22:38,122 --> 00:22:39,717
It's okay, Hunter, 
you can pull it off.

441
00:22:39,717 --> 00:22:41,335
You are engaged and 
not in the house now,

442
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:43,115
she's not going to 
take your phone away.

443
00:22:43,787 --> 00:22:46,423
- If Mom finds out she'll die.
- No, she won't, she'll live.

444
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:47,648
And she's not going to find out.

445
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:48,990
Well, count me in.

446
00:22:49,156 --> 00:22:52,349
It's Ashleigh, my girlfriend, she has
to do an interview with Roland Pollard,

447
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:54,079
the film director 
for the school paper.

448
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:55,252
It's a big coup.

449
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,593
Ashleigh? 
Someone the mom's high on?

450
00:22:57,722 --> 00:23:00,182
- She's never even met her.
- Hunter, your parents want to ...

451
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:04,729
- Gatsby, It's so good to see you!
- It's good to see you, how are you?

452
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:06,772
I'm good, what are 
you doing in town?

453
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:09,340
His girlfriend is 
interviewing Roland ...

454
00:23:09,623 --> 00:23:11,102
Pollard, the film director, but,

455
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:14,172
do me a favor don't tell my mom
I'm here, it's going to be a big party ...

456
00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:16,364
He hates parties, Mr. Anti-social.

457
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:19,841
You always hated 
Mom's literary salons.

458
00:23:19,886 --> 00:23:23,306
It's rich housewifes who have
the leisure to pursue esoteric culture.

459
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:25,391
The out of work,
discussing the out of print.

460
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:28,895
She just wanted to make sure
that we are exposed to great literature.

461
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:31,534
What about Jimmy Cannon then?
Or what Tom Adair?

462
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:33,695
It's not all giant insects
and model maids.

463
00:23:33,783 --> 00:23:36,473
You are not going to 
duck out of our wedding, huh?

464
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:38,118
How can he? 
He's the best man.

465
00:23:38,557 --> 00:23:39,969
He cries at weddings.

466
00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:44,052
He's not as tough as he makes out.
He cries at weddings and funerals.

467
00:23:44,352 --> 00:23:45,228
Same reason.

468
00:23:46,235 --> 00:23:49,280
I'm going to go take a shower.
But there's coffee.

469
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:51,840
- I'm so glad you're here.
- It's nice being here.

470
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:55,374
I've always liked her.

471
00:23:55,513 --> 00:23:56,431
Gatsby.

472
00:23:57,882 --> 00:23:59,349
- What's the matter?
- Gatsby.

473
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,868
I don't want to go
through with this wedding.

474
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:03,805
What?

475
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:04,971
I can't do it.

476
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:07,712
I can't, and I can't 
pull out now.

477
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:10,548
It would kill her, it's two hundred
guests invited, they booked ...

478
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:13,549
the Century Club, they 
booked an orchestra!

479
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:14,699
God, save me!

480
00:24:15,392 --> 00:24:17,727
Okay, alright.
What happened?

481
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:19,469
You'll think I'm so stupid.

482
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:21,508
I'm not going to think you're stupid,
just tell me what happened?

483
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:22,949
I can't, it's too stupid.

484
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:25,836
You're making me anxious, I want to hear
this fascinating piece of stupidity.

485
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:27,546
She's ... bright.

486
00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:31,000
Gatsby, she's nice, she's kind.

487
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:31,852
So?

488
00:24:32,457 --> 00:24:34,214
I can't stand the way she laughs.

489
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:35,585
What?

490
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:37,065
Yeah, I can't take her laugh.

491
00:24:37,682 --> 00:24:38,933
- Her laugh?
- Yes.

492
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:40,661
Yeah, her laugh.

493
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:43,330
Hunter, that's probably the most
idiotic thing I've heard in my life.

494
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:44,998
I told you'd think it's stupid.

495
00:24:45,487 --> 00:24:46,706
What's wrong with her laugh?

496
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:48,438
Listen to it, it's 
a total turn-off.

497
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,271
How much do you love her?

498
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:53,117
I do, I love her, I love 
her, it's just her laugh.

499
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,582
If you love her 
then get over it.

500
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:56,532
I can't. I've tried.
I've tried.

501
00:24:57,556 --> 00:25:00,297
Last night, we were talking 
in bed and she laughed

502
00:25:00,421 --> 00:25:02,486
and I couldn't 
make love to her.

503
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,324
- What?
- I couldn't, I was impotent.

504
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:06,366
From her laugh?

505
00:25:07,034 --> 00:25:08,994
- It's happened before.
- Hunter, you have to see a shrink.

506
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:11,138
- I'm serious.
- I don't need a shrink.

507
00:25:11,138 --> 00:25:13,514
I know what the problem
is - she has a fatal laugh.

508
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:19,893
A cross between Dad's sister Betty
and Lennie in "Of Mice and Men".

509
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,814
I've never heard of a
problem like that before.

510
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:24,952
You are young, Gatsby.

511
00:25:24,952 --> 00:25:27,549
The world is full of 
tragic little dealbreakers.

512
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:29,450
Haven't you been 
seeing Lily for over a year?

513
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,765
Why is this coming up now?

514
00:25:31,465 --> 00:25:32,549
Have you talked 
to her about it?

515
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:36,121
I brought it up, tactfully, but

516
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:38,738
I don't think she realises 
how serious it's gotten.

517
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,074
I love her, but I can't 
marry her, Gatsby.

518
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:44,211
I won't be able to 
have sex with her.

519
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,598
No, you mean you 
don't want to marry her

520
00:25:45,598 --> 00:25:47,737
so you're focusing 
on this laugh insanity?

521
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:51,388
Spare me the fruits of your Upper East
Side talking, listen to her laugh.

522
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:53,548
When she comes down, 
we'll get her to laugh.

523
00:25:53,713 --> 00:25:55,128
You'll see what I mean.

524
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:02,941
I can't.

525
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,227
- I can't do this, I'm sorry.
- Rollie.

526
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,244
I know, I'm sorry, Ted.

527
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:08,741
- Rollie, come on.
- It's actually, it's physcially...

528
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:10,129
- Don't do this.
- making me sick.

529
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:11,103
Don't do this.

530
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,641
- It's humiliating.
- It's a process, Rollie.

531
00:26:12,923 --> 00:26:14,781
- Your changes are shit.
- Rollie, sit down.

532
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,632
- Everything that I did is shit.
- Not shit, different, different.

533
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:17,267
Mr. Pollard.

534
00:26:17,364 --> 00:26:19,823
- It's not different.
- Not all the changes work, but some are good.

535
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:21,480
Thank you for coming, Ashleigh,
I need to get a little air.

536
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
- It's a process.
- I need some space.

537
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,625
- Come and sit down.
- I need to get out.

538
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:24,182
Don't do this.

539
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,935
- I need to think about.
- Don't! No booze.

540
00:26:27,477 --> 00:26:28,687
- Please, no booze.
- What?

541
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:29,885
Come on.

542
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:35,802
You just watched 2 hours of
an existential steaming shit pile

543
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,393
and that's all that
you can say to me?

544
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:39,981
- It's a process, we do this every time.
- Ted, Ted.

545
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:42,518
Rollie, come on, back.
Don't drink.

546
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,277
Oh, God.

547
00:26:43,277 --> 00:26:46,071
- Shouldn't we go afer him?
- That's the sure sign he is going to drink.

548
00:26:46,475 --> 00:26:47,993
You go, you can go.

549
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:49,519
I have to watch it all

550
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,900
to be able to talk 
to him intelligently about it.

551
00:26:53,462 --> 00:26:55,005
I love the movie so far.

552
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,883
- You do?
- I do.

553
00:27:00,844 --> 00:27:01,762
Let's go back.

554
00:27:03,515 --> 00:27:06,247
There's a high-stakes card
game later at a Fremont Hotel.

555
00:27:06,247 --> 00:27:08,643
I can't make it, but I know
you love that kind of thing.

556
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:11,450
You want me to call Joe Cohen,
and say you'll take my chair?

557
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,996
I would love a high-stakes card game,
I'm loaded right now, but

558
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:17,113
Ashleigh and I, we
have plans for tonight.

559
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:18,378
I'm dying to meet Ashleigh.

560
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:20,654
I know, I don't know 
where she is right now.

561
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,114
- I was supposed to show her city today.
- You better take an umbrella.

562
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:25,695
Watch, I'll make her laugh.

563
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:30,116
I was just telling Gatsby...
Larry Nash told me a great joke.

564
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:33,173
Two cannibals are eating
a comedian and one says:

565
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,973
 "Hey, do you taste 
something funny?"

566
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,363
That is so ufunny.

567
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,277
Okay, that's my que, Hunter,
lovely to see you as always.

568
00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:42,611
Lily, thank you 
for the coffee.

569
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:43,991
- I heard one more.
- Sure.

570
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,530
A homeless man stopped a Jewish
mother on the street and said:

571
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,325
"Lady, I haven't eaten in 3 days.
And she said: "Force yourself".

572
00:28:11,354 --> 00:28:12,790
Hello, Ashleigh, what's going on?

573
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,953
You said you were going 
to call me 30 minutes ago.

574
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:19,046
I know, but the film got delayed.
I'm up at this screening room place.

575
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:23,005
It's fine, just meet me at the
Museum of Modern Art on 53rd Street.

576
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:25,806
We'll grab a bite to eat there and
then we are going to go see the Weegee's.

577
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:28,517
- I can't. I can't.
- What do yo mean, why not?

578
00:28:28,597 --> 00:28:30,432
Because I'm onto a 
real story here.

579
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:34,936
This is a 70 million dollar movie
and Rollie is very unhappy with it.

580
00:28:35,937 --> 00:28:37,147
You call him Rollie?

581
00:28:37,731 --> 00:28:39,310
Yeah, and Ted and I, 
we have to find him.

582
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,688
We have to find 
him and talk with him.

583
00:28:40,688 --> 00:28:44,066
Before he adds one of his crazy fits,
and then re-edits the whole thing and ruins it.

584
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:45,600
Who is Ted?

585
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:49,562
Gatsby, I can't talk right now.
But I'll call you as soon as I'm through.

586
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:53,441
And if I'm running late, I'll
just meet you back at the Plaza.

587
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,299
It's not the Plaz...
It's the Carlyle!

588
00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:58,989
It's a bar and the
piano for tonight.

589
00:29:00,203 --> 00:29:04,291
He's not at the hotel and he didn't show
up for the press interview, so

590
00:29:04,406 --> 00:29:07,719
he's wallowing in self-loathing
somehere, drinking Courvoisier,

591
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:09,987
thinking of new ways
to screw up our work.

592
00:29:10,176 --> 00:29:12,224
I thought the film was 
full of wonderful things.

593
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:14,033
Me too. Tell him, you ...
Tell him, tell Roland.

594
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:16,300
Because hearing that from
me won't mean anything.

595
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,582
I'm always at this end of the
argument, but you are fresh,

596
00:29:19,582 --> 00:29:21,546
honest, new generation woman.

597
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:23,989
Especially a pretty one, maybe ...
You may...

598
00:29:24,113 --> 00:29:25,941
Come on, let's find him.
Are you okay?

599
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:27,438
- Yeah.
- Come on.

600
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:33,129
He doesn't like her laugh?
No, Ashleigh's laugh is perfect.

601
00:29:33,797 --> 00:29:37,676
Let's go, Ashleigh, we're blowing
the day and it's so moody out.

602
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,171
We could be on a ferry,

603
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,814
or the top of the Empire 
State Building, black and white.

604
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,783
- Yeah, he was here.
- He was here?

605
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,683
He seemed very distraught.
He knocked back a couple of brandies.

606
00:29:48,683 --> 00:29:50,824
Mumbled something about
heading out to the studio.

607
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,418
Okay. Let's take my car
and head out to Queens.

608
00:29:55,738 --> 00:29:57,852
- Queens?
- Yeah, it's a big film studio.

609
00:29:57,852 --> 00:29:59,071
Do you still want to come?

610
00:29:59,378 --> 00:30:00,608
Definitely.

611
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:02,753
When Rollie gets
drunk and morose,

612
00:30:02,753 --> 00:30:04,474
he likes to wander 
around the sound stages

613
00:30:04,474 --> 00:30:06,209
 and pretend he's 
Norma Desmond.

614
00:30:06,353 --> 00:30:07,777
- Thanks.
- Sure.

615
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,703
Can I ask you a few questions?
Since I am on assignment.

616
00:30:20,703 --> 00:30:22,152
Sure.

617
00:30:22,308 --> 00:30:24,517
What's your favorite 
film of Rollie's?

618
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:27,767
"Winter Memories", 
the one in Venice.

619
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:29,518
When did you first see it?

620
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:34,690
It's with Gatsby, actually, it
was on our very first date.

621
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,503
Dialogue made 
me want to kiss him.

622
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,466
That line about love and death,
being two sides of the same coin.

623
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:43,843
Did you understand it?

624
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,430
No.

625
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:51,684
I got confused, and felt insecure.

626
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:55,021
Like I wanted to, just,
be held and kissed.

627
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,325
Have you ever been to Venice?

628
00:30:58,492 --> 00:31:00,277
No, but Gatsby has.

629
00:31:01,746 --> 00:31:03,289
- Oh my God!
- What?

630
00:31:03,873 --> 00:31:06,375
I knew it!
I knew it!

631
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:08,856
- Are you okay?
- Oh God!

632
00:31:08,856 --> 00:31:10,272
You turned all white.

633
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:11,883
I knew it!
She was lying!

634
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:13,551
- Who?
- Connie, my wife!

635
00:31:13,718 --> 00:31:16,262
- She's seeing Lipszyc!
- Who's Lipszyc?

636
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:19,515
She said she was going shopping
with her sister, in Connecticut.

637
00:31:19,682 --> 00:31:22,143
But she's walking into
Lipszyc's building!

638
00:31:22,518 --> 00:31:23,944
Is Lipszyc a spy?

639
00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:24,867
What?

640
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,095
No, Larry Lipszyc.
My friend, my best friend.

641
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:30,249
My best friend. I can't believe it.
She must...

642
00:31:30,563 --> 00:31:32,106
They're having an affair.

643
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:36,533
Oh God, are you okay?
You are clutching your heart.

644
00:31:36,918 --> 00:31:38,625
Okay, here's what we do.

645
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:42,758
We sit here, we wait until she
comes out, and then I'll confront her.

646
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,408
I hope there's not a gun in here
in glove compartment, like in your movies.

647
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:49,678
You better go.
You go.

648
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:52,765
No, I can't leave you alone.
You are all white and shaky.

649
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:57,019
Breathe. Deeply breathe.

650
00:31:57,644 --> 00:32:00,021
Deeply. Dr. Ross said breathe.

651
00:32:00,814 --> 00:32:03,567
Deeply. Breathe deeply.

652
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:09,072
No, not you.
Me.

653
00:32:10,175 --> 00:32:11,474
Oh God.

654
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:13,438
Taxi!

655
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:15,858
Taxi!

656
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:25,730
Oh my God, Chan.
What are you doing here?

657
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,833
What the hell, 
you were shooting ...

658
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:28,458
- Hey, you take it, I'm getting out of this one.
- No, no, no, get in, Gatsby.

659
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:29,823
- Are you sure?
- I'll drop you.

660
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:33,228
-  Hey, where are you going?
- You remember, the same 5th Avenue joint.

661
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,307
I remember your appartment
well for my days with Amy.

662
00:32:36,474 --> 00:32:40,228
I remember you calling for her,
my parents kept warning her about you.

663
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:41,854
Warning? Why the hell
would they be warning her?

664
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:44,779
Because on the first date 
you took her walking in the rain

665
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:46,584
and she got bronchial pneumonia.

666
00:32:46,728 --> 00:32:48,205
For Christ's sake, I'm never
going to get over this.

667
00:32:48,205 --> 00:32:49,983
You can't get it
from being wet!

668
00:32:49,983 --> 00:32:51,944
Don't yell at me.
I thought it was romantic.

669
00:32:52,021 --> 00:32:52,986
That's because it is romantic.

670
00:32:52,986 --> 00:32:55,708
- It's a romatic gesture.
- That's what I'm saying.

671
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,627
You should tell that to Ashleigh.
She thinks I'm nuts.

672
00:32:58,153 --> 00:33:00,655
Who's Ashleigh?
That rodeo queen you're dating?

673
00:33:01,156 --> 00:33:04,325
She's not a cowgirl, she comes from one of
the biggest banking families in Tuscon.

674
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:06,755
She was a dead butone, actually.
She came out.

675
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:08,253
She came out?
Is she gay?

676
00:33:08,455 --> 00:33:11,149
No, she's not gay, she's 
charming and beautiful.

677
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:12,436
And we were 
supposed to have this...

678
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:15,069
Goddamn weekend in the city
together, and suddenly she's...

679
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,196
Parked down with all these 
interviews for the school paper.

680
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,448
She's ambitious, you should
find that admirable.

681
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:26,243
One, it was supposed to be one little ...
One tiny little, lousy, hour intervew.

682
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,788
Instead, you know.
Lost the whole, goddamn, weekend.

683
00:33:30,664 --> 00:33:31,865
Would you just relax?

684
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:34,643
- I don't really know why?
- I'm having a hard time relaxing, Chan.

685
00:33:34,643 --> 00:33:37,163
Because this was going
to be a special weekend.

686
00:33:37,172 --> 00:33:38,943
Instead I'm out here in a ...

687
00:33:38,943 --> 00:33:41,738
Wandering streets, like Hagar
in a goddamn desert or something.

688
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:45,055
Don't tell me, tell her.
Tell her to get her priorities straight.

689
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:48,266
You want to drink some wine, walk in
the rain and give her bronchitis.

690
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:53,026
Okay, look she's, apparently,
onto a very big story.

691
00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:54,929
She takes her job
very seriously, alright?

692
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:56,097
Fine, then get over it.

693
00:33:58,167 --> 00:33:59,668
I'm in the process of
getting over it.

694
00:33:59,985 --> 00:34:02,130
Unless you are worried
somebody's hitting on her.

695
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,892
- What the hell does that mean?
- I don't know.

696
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:06,491
Is she interviewing attractive men?

697
00:34:07,318 --> 00:34:09,382
I've never really thought about it.
I don't know.

698
00:34:10,055 --> 00:34:12,003
Some might say they are interesting.

699
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,493
Then maybe you better
step in and assert yourself.

700
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:18,197
- Do you think I have to be more demanding?
- I would.

701
00:34:19,587 --> 00:34:22,215
These are like movie big
shots she's hanging out with.

702
00:34:22,548 --> 00:34:24,926
- Suits?
- Yes, a director and a screenwriter.

703
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:28,137
Artists, they are usually passionate.

704
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,139
Oh, Jesus Christ!

705
00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:33,708
Okay, you're right,
I have to call her now.

706
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:35,719
The sooner the better.

707
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,512
- You think there's that much of a rush?
- I don't know.

708
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:39,639
Oh, Christ, alright.

709
00:34:40,515 --> 00:34:41,732
It's your idea.

710
00:34:43,189 --> 00:34:44,544
What do you think I should say?

711
00:34:45,113 --> 00:34:47,115
- There's nothing you can say.
- What do you mean?

712
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,962
Without sounding possessive.

713
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,272
Christ, Chan, you just 
encouraged me to call her.

714
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:52,357
Now I'm asking for your help

715
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,148
and you are telling me
there's nothing I can say?

716
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,126
You are so wishy washy.

717
00:34:56,317 --> 00:34:59,913
Now that I see your M-O I
know exatly why Amy 86ed you.

718
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:00,957
No.

719
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:03,412
Amy didn't dump me,
I got sick of seeing her.

720
00:35:03,412 --> 00:35:06,383
Yeah, because everytime you'd call,
and I'd say it was you on the phone,

721
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:08,898
she'd wave her arms and
say "I'm not in, I'm not in".

722
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:11,051
Hey, Gatsby?

723
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:13,744
Hey, Ashleigh.
Listen.

724
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:17,661
Look, I know you are very busy, and
that's why we came to New York, right?

725
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:20,934
And no one has more respect
for honest ambitions than I do.

726
00:35:21,468 --> 00:35:24,221
Do I have to listen to this
without an airsick bag?

727
00:35:24,511 --> 00:35:28,224
I can't talk to you right now.
I'm kind of involved in the situation.

728
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:30,726
We have a number of
things planned for today.

729
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:33,113
I'm very busy right now.

730
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:35,613
But, I really, I can't explain 
it over the phone.

731
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:37,914
Ashleigh, we were talking
about one movie interview.

732
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:40,231
What could possible be so
secretive about that?

733
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:41,699
What's so CIA?

734
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:45,590
Unless there's some
funny business going on?

735
00:35:46,546 --> 00:35:48,631
I'll talk to you later.
Bye, Gatsby.

736
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,306
Oh, these, goddamn, 
cellphones are ...

737
00:35:53,582 --> 00:35:56,062
I don't know, to me it sounds
dubious to the max.

738
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:58,532
It sounds dubious to you
because you have sinister mind.

739
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:02,847
- You must really love her.
- I do, she's a breath of fresh air.

740
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:07,101
She's charming and delightful.
She's pretty.

741
00:36:07,726 --> 00:36:10,187
She's sexy and somehow
at the same she's witty.

742
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:13,524
She sings very nicely.
She plays the flute.

743
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:15,368
I don't know how to 
break this to you.

744
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,664
But I'm sick of 
hearing about her, okay?

745
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,283
Was that your boyfriend?

746
00:36:22,576 --> 00:36:23,911
Gatsby.
Yeah.

747
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,122
- Are you still dizzy?
- No, I'm okay.

748
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,043
What's Gatsby do?

749
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:33,545
He goes to Yardley too.

750
00:36:34,296 --> 00:36:36,924
Which he refers to as 
"Forced law on University."

751
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:39,176
Is he a journalist too?

752
00:36:40,052 --> 00:36:42,179
He's not really 
focused professionally.

753
00:36:42,805 --> 00:36:46,600
I think that in his wildest dreams
he'd like to be Sky Masterson.

754
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:50,020
- A Broadway bookie?
- He's a little eccentric.

755
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:52,398
In what way?
Eccentric?

756
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,737
I think it has to do with the fact that
he and his mom never really hit it off.

757
00:36:59,822 --> 00:37:03,992
She was always forcing him to
read everything, and learn piano...

758
00:37:04,907 --> 00:37:06,471
He is really smart.

759
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:07,948
He was one of those 
students who...

760
00:37:07,948 --> 00:37:11,353
He doesn't have to study for a
test and then he just aces it.

761
00:37:11,353 --> 00:37:12,271
Sounds like me.

762
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,898
To tell you the truth.

763
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:20,828
Don't tell anybody, but I think
he has a touch of Asperger's.

764
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:26,482
- You know what Chan?
- Yeah?

765
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:28,146
I'm going to get out of here too.

766
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:32,972
- What are you doing now?
- Why?

767
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:35,429
Why, because I have a
little bit of time to kill.

768
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:37,198
And I thought about 
going to Modern Museum.

769
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:38,404
Look at the WeeGee exhibit.

770
00:37:38,404 --> 00:37:41,907
Oh, I see. You have nothing better to
do so you want me to keep you company?

771
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:44,008
You know what? Forget it.
I dated your older sister.

772
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:46,157
You've always had a little
bit of an attitude, okay?

773
00:37:46,157 --> 00:37:47,320
I'm not looking for any trouble.

774
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,017
I have to check out some paintings
at the Mat's Profession Class.

775
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,768
If you want to
keep me company.

776
00:37:51,768 --> 00:37:53,805
I don't know why 
you couldn't have just...

777
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,107
Fine, it's going to be fun.

778
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:56,331
We can get on
each other's nervs.

779
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:58,375
Alright, let me change, I'm soaked.
Are you hungry?

780
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,420
I'd give you an Arizona lunch,
but we are all out of beef jerky.

781
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,495
Brings back a lot of memories.

782
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,243
My folks are in East
Hampton for the weekend.

783
00:38:12,243 --> 00:38:13,207
How come you didn't go?

784
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,635
I've got a date tonight.

785
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:15,824
You?

786
00:38:15,824 --> 00:38:18,285
Don't be startled,
it turnes out I'm desirable.

787
00:38:18,452 --> 00:38:20,537
Who's the unfortunate victim?

788
00:38:20,704 --> 00:38:24,458
You wouldn't know him,
he's a girlfriend's dermatologist.

789
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,001
It's romantic.

790
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:30,296
Don't forget to show him those three
irregular black moles on your back.

791
00:38:30,515 --> 00:38:31,645
I'm sure they're nothing.

792
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:34,279
I really hope I won't regret
not going to the Hamilton's.

793
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,500
The beach is so pretty
in the rain too.

794
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:39,791
- Would you have to be with your parents.
- So what? I love my parents.

795
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,001
You know them, they are fun.
Don't you have fun with your parents?

796
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:45,467
No, fun is not the 
word I would use.

797
00:38:45,593 --> 00:38:46,746
Alright, I'll be right back.

798
00:38:46,746 --> 00:38:50,083
- Hey, listen, can I play your piano?
- Yeah, go ahead, it's a family heirloom.

824
00:41:07,003 --> 00:41:08,922
I love a "cocktail lounge" piano.

825
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:12,132
Outside it drizzles, grey.

826
00:41:12,758 --> 00:41:15,813
New York City, enveloped
in the light mist.

827
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:19,150
Two lovers have a date
to meet at 6 o'clock.

828
00:41:19,525 --> 00:41:23,071
At Grand Central Station, under
the clock, like in the movie.

829
00:41:23,312 --> 00:41:26,649
I love that movie,
but I see it outside.

830
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:31,218
At the East River?
With the tugboats around the water?

831
00:41:31,218 --> 00:41:34,326
- I love tugboats.
- Almost, you're in the Rainbow Park.

832
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,554
I know! I know!
Under the clock.

833
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:41,321
Which clock?

834
00:41:41,613 --> 00:41:45,325
The Delacorte clock, where all the
animals go around in Central Park.

835
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,514
I love it, it's very old movie.

836
00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:51,059
My Mom and I used to watch
old movies together all the time.

837
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:55,731
She would study the decor.
They are so fabulously escapist.

838
00:41:56,773 --> 00:42:00,700
In my version he's
waiting, the music plays.

839
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:03,072
And she never comes.

840
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:06,150
Or she's waiting and he
chooses the other woman.

841
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:08,615
Can't they just kiss in the rain?

842
00:42:08,615 --> 00:42:11,376
That sounds pretty good
to me, even if it is commercial.

843
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,781
- Picture yourself.
- Okay.

844
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:15,055
It's four minutes to six.

845
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,800
You're pacing up and down,
rain drops have just started to fall.

846
00:42:19,634 --> 00:42:22,136
You're at your Delacorte clock
in Central Park.

847
00:42:22,762 --> 00:42:25,261
Expecting your ...

848
00:42:26,137 --> 00:42:27,370
Dermatologist.

849
00:42:27,487 --> 00:42:30,712
But he just diagnosed a
carcinoma in his own limp.

850
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:32,714
It's metastasizing as you wait.

851
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:37,391
Would you give me a break?
In my version, everything's fine.

852
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:40,936
He meets me, holds me,
kisses me.

853
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:43,689
It's lovely.
Nobody needs a biopsy.

854
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:48,319
Connie!

855
00:42:48,821 --> 00:42:50,009
- Connie!
- Ted.

856
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:53,095
Is this how you are shopping 
with Judy in Connecticut?

857
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:54,223
What are you doing here?

858
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,059
I happen to see you out
the window, from the car.

859
00:42:57,477 --> 00:42:58,516
By sheer chance.

860
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:01,539
- Really? That's awkward, isn't it?
- Awkward, awkward?

861
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,288
You've been sleeping with
him for months, haven't you?

862
00:43:04,288 --> 00:43:05,921
- We were going to tell you.
- When?

863
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:08,686
- When we moved to London?
- No.

864
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,865
Your dream?
That we had moved to London?

865
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:13,321
It just happened, Ted.
We both fought it.

866
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:17,259
I'm sure you fought it, in every hotel
room, on every matress, in a backseat.

867
00:43:17,383 --> 00:43:18,883
This isn't about sex.

868
00:43:18,883 --> 00:43:21,519
It's always about sex.
Everything is about sex.

869
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,132
The economies are about sex.

870
00:43:23,132 --> 00:43:25,372
I can't have this
outburst with you on the street.

871
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:28,754
You, with my best friend.
It's such a cliché, I can't believe it.

872
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:30,773
Don't get down on 
Larry, he adores you.

873
00:43:30,905 --> 00:43:32,247
He identifies with you.

874
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,195
I know, he uses my 
aftershave, and my wife.

875
00:43:35,624 --> 00:43:36,476
Who is she?

876
00:43:36,476 --> 00:43:38,719
- Ted, is everything okay?
- What does that have to do with anything?

877
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:41,695
- Who is she?
- No, everything is fine, stay there Ashleigh.

878
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:42,834
Keep dry.

879
00:43:43,965 --> 00:43:46,638
- I'm with the Yardley Argus.
- The what?

880
00:43:47,134 --> 00:43:50,313
- The Yardley Argus.
- She's a reporter, doing a piece on Rollie.

881
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:52,952
On Rollie? Then what is she doing
with you, following me?

882
00:43:52,952 --> 00:43:54,532
- Don't try and turn this around.
- I'm not turning...

883
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:57,516
Don't try and turn this around.
You've been caught. You're caught.

884
00:43:57,686 --> 00:44:02,433
You, who make a fool of yourself
over every young, ambitious starlet model.

885
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:04,596
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

886
00:44:04,596 --> 00:44:07,341
You've been having an
affair with Larry Lipszyc.

887
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:10,247
And you are spying on me with who?
Your 15-year-old concubine?

888
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:10,838
She's a journalist.

889
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:12,087
- I'm 21.
- She's 21.

890
00:44:12,087 --> 00:44:13,624
She's 21?
- She's a journalist.

891
00:44:13,624 --> 00:44:15,834
- I have a proof of age, actually.
- No, you don't need this.

892
00:44:15,882 --> 00:44:17,122
This always happens in bars.

893
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:19,335
- You've been caight.
- You know what, as long as you are a reporter.

894
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:21,989
I would like to make a
press release about my husband.

895
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:24,577
- Really?
- Can I write this down?

896
00:44:24,577 --> 00:44:25,935
- Sure, go ahead.
- Ashleigh, please.

897
00:44:25,935 --> 00:44:30,302
Ask him how many times
he has been unfaithful to me?

898
00:44:30,305 --> 00:44:32,035
She's demented.
You're demented.

899
00:44:32,035 --> 00:44:36,287
- His secretary, the actresses, the poetess.
- Wrong, wrong.

900
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:37,860
- The poetess?
- The poetess?

901
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,614
Were all these women for
a pleasure or for some project?

902
00:44:39,848 --> 00:44:42,026
Stop filling her head with lies.
Ashleigh, come here.

903
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:47,685
Take this address to the studio, okay?
Find Rollie, come on.

904
00:44:48,223 --> 00:44:50,769
- Find Rollie.
- I don't know my way around New York.

905
00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:52,509
It's okay, tell the cab driver...

906
00:44:52,509 --> 00:44:55,249
- Find Rollie. Stop.
- Ask him if he ever slep with Samantha Leroy.

907
00:44:55,581 --> 00:44:59,715
- The Argus is not a tabloid.
- There are no papers that are not tabloid.

908
00:44:59,715 --> 00:45:02,913
Encourage him about the movie,
so he doesn't mangle it and ruin it, okay?

909
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:04,440
Please, don't print any of this.

910
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:07,351
- Don't worry, we always protect there from naughty.
- I'm sure.

911
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:08,872
Connie!

912
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,457
Connie!

913
00:45:17,198 --> 00:45:19,831
The first time I kissed your
sister was in this museum.

914
00:45:19,998 --> 00:45:21,049
I know, she told me.

915
00:45:21,049 --> 00:45:23,513
She said that you were 
looking at a Hieronymus Bosch

916
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:24,762
and it made you feel romantic.

917
00:45:24,762 --> 00:45:25,878
So that you kissed her.

918
00:45:25,899 --> 00:45:28,145
As of she knew your
shrink wasn't helping you.

919
00:45:28,317 --> 00:45:30,279
Don't tell she got 
the kiss of the 4.

920
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:33,675
If she'd quoted you a figure 
higher I'd have her audited.

921
00:45:39,092 --> 00:45:42,185
There's something charming
about that elegance.

922
00:45:43,394 --> 00:45:46,814
My mother would've liked Sargent
to have painted her in just that pose.

923
00:45:48,107 --> 00:45:50,526
The dressed so beautifully
in Paris back then.

924
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,655
I could see moving to Paris.

925
00:45:54,011 --> 00:45:57,222
I never really asked you.
What are you future plans, Gatsby?

926
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,921
I don't know, I'm floundering.

927
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:01,469
What does that mean?

928
00:46:01,597 --> 00:46:02,906
I don't know 
who I want to be.

929
00:46:03,563 --> 00:46:05,662
I just know what I don't 
want to be, is that terrible?

930
00:46:05,984 --> 00:46:07,694
So you have no game plan?

931
00:46:08,157 --> 00:46:10,756
I know I don't 
want to be a test pilot,

932
00:46:10,756 --> 00:46:13,542
or clergyman 
or proctologist, so...

933
00:46:14,266 --> 00:46:15,673
Ruled those out.

934
00:46:16,475 --> 00:46:17,977
I get it, you don't fit in.

935
00:46:18,603 --> 00:46:21,177
That's why I always had a crush
on you when you dated Amy.

936
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:23,346
- You had a crush on me?
- I did, isn't it weird?

937
00:46:23,763 --> 00:46:27,464
I don't know, maybe it's because
you took her to do oddball things.

938
00:46:27,613 --> 00:46:29,616
You took her to one 
of those divey piano bars,

939
00:46:29,616 --> 00:46:31,078
where no one 
else ever took her.

940
00:46:31,642 --> 00:46:33,455
I did take her to her 
first crap game.

941
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:36,437
I know and I loved that.
I loved hearing every detail.

942
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,658
I was hoping she would
get serious with you,

943
00:46:38,658 --> 00:46:41,478
because you were not like
all the other idiots she dated.

944
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:44,195
I thought you 
were a special idiot.

945
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,232
I'm glad I impressed you, Chan.

946
00:46:47,575 --> 00:46:50,407
I remember Amy came home and 
she told me that you took her to

947
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:53,509
Ballbay scene at Central Park 
and made love to her.

948
00:46:54,499 --> 00:46:57,002
- She told you about that?
- Every moist detail.

949
00:46:57,169 --> 00:46:58,521
Now I embarrassed.

950
00:46:58,658 --> 00:47:00,639
Don't be, that night
she gave you a 6.

951
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:02,522
She gave me a 6?
Amy.

952
00:47:03,236 --> 00:47:04,591
With a asterix.

953
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:06,296
She said you 
were a little tense.

954
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:09,423
Yeah, Central Park can be a
little dangerous at 2 AM.

955
00:47:09,423 --> 00:47:11,371
- But very romantic.
- Okay.

956
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:13,009
And then it started to rain.

957
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:14,751
That was the best part.

958
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:19,005
Her hair got wet, her clothes
started to cling to her body.

959
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,325
- She started sneezing.
- I don't really remember that part.

960
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,334
Now that I think of it, Chan.

961
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:29,047
You always were around,
giving me the fish eye.

962
00:47:29,948 --> 00:47:31,575
You are just realising this now?

963
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:36,911
That's all you have to say?

964
00:47:36,911 --> 00:47:39,685
You didn't think I was
cute or attractive, anything?

965
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:42,043
You seemed fine.

966
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,158
You mean I had no
physical deformities.

967
00:47:45,304 --> 00:47:48,120
I didn't have acromegaly
or a hunchback.

968
00:47:48,288 --> 00:47:49,898
You know what, Chan, I wasn't
really paying attention,

969
00:47:49,898 --> 00:47:52,131
because I was a little tense
in front of your parents.

970
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:56,451
Amy would make her entrance,
like a, goddamn, Miss America.

971
00:47:57,436 --> 00:47:59,316
I'm sure Ashleigh is 
a beauty queen type.

972
00:47:59,316 --> 00:48:03,108
She is, she was an actual first-place
winner at her high school in Tuscon.

973
00:48:03,421 --> 00:48:04,606
4H, right?

974
00:48:05,206 --> 00:48:06,616
Yes, how did you guess?

975
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,927
Ink it in.
Let's get out of here.

976
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:15,095
These crazy egyptians, they
put all their money on an afterlife.

977
00:48:15,558 --> 00:48:18,431
Listen, Gatsby, let me tell you,
you only look once.

978
00:48:18,577 --> 00:48:20,853
But once is enough if
you find the right person.

979
00:48:22,287 --> 00:48:24,568
You think she's giving me
a runaround today?

980
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:26,572
I'm struggling to
keep my spirits up.

981
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,930
You really are hooked
on her, aren't you?

982
00:48:31,279 --> 00:48:32,238
Oh my God!

983
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:35,283
That's my aunt and uncle!
They're here for my mother's party.

984
00:48:35,806 --> 00:48:36,290
What party?

985
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,021
They remembered the date - 
my mother's party tonight,

986
00:48:38,021 --> 00:48:39,208
They going to 
tell her I'm here.

987
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:40,762
- Okay.
- I can't discuss this, I have to hide.

988
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:43,879
Why don't you duck into the
mummy case, I'll get some white tape.

989
00:48:44,582 --> 00:48:49,593
<font color="#00ffff">Subtitles by sub.Trader
subscene.com</font>

990
00:48:57,277 --> 00:48:57,986
Hello?

991
00:48:58,275 --> 00:49:02,268
Gatsby, I finally got alone.
Where are you?

992
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:05,455
Let me put is this way.
Have you heard of King Tut?

993
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,061
You are where?
What are you doing?

994
00:49:17,804 --> 00:49:19,926
Hello?
Gatsby, hello?

995
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,041
Gatsby, what a surprise!

996
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:28,002
I was about to 
call your mother.

997
00:49:35,551 --> 00:49:36,865
Hi, can I help you?

998
00:49:37,379 --> 00:49:38,991
I'm looking for Roland Pollard.

999
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:41,073
Roland Pollard?
Right, he was here earlier.

1000
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:43,131
I'm not sure
if he's still back there.

1001
00:49:43,895 --> 00:49:45,563
Mom, it was all planned, okay?

1002
00:49:45,563 --> 00:49:47,568
Ashleigh and I wanted 
to surprise you tonight.

1003
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,262
I happen to run into uncle
Tyler and aunt Grace, okay?

1004
00:49:50,262 --> 00:49:52,016
But don't worry, we are 
going to be there for dinner,

1005
00:49:52,016 --> 00:49:53,669
 it's going to be a 
great time, I just...

1006
00:49:53,669 --> 00:49:56,714
I thought it would be a
fun surprise.

1007
00:49:56,964 --> 00:49:59,300
Oh, we spoiled your surprise.

1008
00:50:00,361 --> 00:50:01,487
Mr. Pollard?

1009
00:50:04,282 --> 00:50:05,158
Rollie?

1010
00:50:06,492 --> 00:50:07,243
Hello.

1011
00:50:07,544 --> 00:50:08,739
Can I help you?

1012
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:11,360
Have you seen Mr. Pollard?

1013
00:50:11,835 --> 00:50:14,711
Rollie's gone.
He left an hour ago.

1014
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,329
Did he seem okay?

1015
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:22,501
To be honest, he seemed
a little drunk to me.

1016
00:50:23,878 --> 00:50:24,837
Are you two friends?

1017
00:50:27,548 --> 00:50:30,134
Oh my God!
You're Francisco Vega.

1018
00:50:31,249 --> 00:50:32,292
Is that good or bad?

1019
00:50:33,745 --> 00:50:37,299
If my roommate was here,
she'd hemorrhage.

1020
00:50:39,126 --> 00:50:42,129
She thinks you are the greatest thing to
come along since the morning-after pill.

1021
00:50:43,036 --> 00:50:43,911
Me too.

1022
00:50:45,538 --> 00:50:47,540
I can't believe I'm talking
to Francisco Vega.

1023
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:52,600
Look at me, I'm a journalist
and I'm reduced to total adolescence.

1024
00:50:55,008 --> 00:50:57,385
- You're Francisco Vega!
- I know that.

1025
00:50:58,252 --> 00:51:00,212
I guess the key question
here is - who are you?

1026
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:04,431
Who am I? Is that what
you're asking who I am?

1027
00:51:05,973 --> 00:51:08,809
- My identity?
- Yeah, is it coming to you?

1028
00:51:11,606 --> 00:51:13,733
I can't believe I'm blanking on it.

1029
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,133
Check your driver's license.

1030
00:51:16,229 --> 00:51:18,769
Right.
Yeah, right.

1031
00:51:20,628 --> 00:51:21,370
Okay.

1032
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:25,047
I'm Ashleigh Enright.

1033
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:26,592
I knew it would be on there.

1034
00:51:30,095 --> 00:51:32,266
I work for the Yardley Argus.
I write for them.

1035
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:35,487
And I'm here in New York, because
I'm interviewing Mr. Pollard.

1036
00:51:35,881 --> 00:51:38,592
Wow, you look exatly the
same but better.

1037
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:41,237
Let me tell you something.

1038
00:51:41,537 --> 00:51:44,749
You look more beautiful than 
any journalist I've ever met.

1039
00:51:45,712 --> 00:51:47,673
You can make a very
sexy anchorwoman.

1040
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,053
How can you say that when
you're in the papers every week

1041
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:51,974
with those die-models
and actresses?

1042
00:51:52,054 --> 00:51:52,877
- Get in, get in.
- Where are we going?

1043
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:53,952
Not now guys, not now.

1044
00:51:53,952 --> 00:51:56,417
Come on, give us a break!
Come on! No!

1045
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:58,909
Should I be in here?

1046
00:51:59,363 --> 00:52:00,598
Make yourself at home.

1047
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,145
- Would you like to sit down?
- No, no, no.

1048
00:52:04,312 --> 00:52:05,855
- Would you like a drink?
- No thanks.

1049
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,399
Would you like to
have dinner with me?

1050
00:52:08,463 --> 00:52:10,052
Would I like to
have what with you?

1051
00:52:11,372 --> 00:52:14,177
I have no plans, but to
get an early bite and then.

1052
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,756
You and I can go
to a party together.

1053
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,802
Party?
Dinner?

1054
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,333
What about Tiffany Griffin?
I though...

1055
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:25,687
- I don't want to talk about her.
- You two were twosome.

1056
00:52:25,806 --> 00:52:27,444
No, we just broke up.

1057
00:52:28,242 --> 00:52:30,196
I'm going to change 
into my street clothes.

1058
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:32,087
While you think about it, okay?

1059
00:52:37,356 --> 00:52:38,274
Oh, Gosh.

1060
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:43,306
Great, now I have to take Ashleigh
to my Mom's, goddamn, party.

1061
00:52:43,707 --> 00:52:45,000
Why is that so bad?

1062
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,554
Why is that so bad, Chan?
Because I wanted to spend the night

1063
00:52:47,554 --> 00:52:52,097
with Ashleigh alone in New York,
not with forego of wasp plutocrats.

1064
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:55,214
A forego of wasp plutocrats?

1065
00:52:55,357 --> 00:52:58,152
Sounds like something on
the menu out of a fusion restaurant.

1066
00:52:58,944 --> 00:53:02,541
I'm not interested in the euro, or
how many Basquiats somebody owns,

1067
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:04,744
or whether they prefer a
falcon to a gulfstream.

1068
00:53:05,467 --> 00:53:07,377
These things have no
meaning to me.

1069
00:53:07,871 --> 00:53:10,327
I noticed you haven't
renounced your family's money.

1070
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:12,069
What does that mean?

1071
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,980
That means you could move out.

1072
00:53:15,282 --> 00:53:17,583
Get a job, put 
yourself through college.

1073
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:18,910
Oh yeah, as of what?

1074
00:53:20,246 --> 00:53:22,060
Piano player in the dive.

1075
00:53:22,427 --> 00:53:26,181
Or, maybe a poker player?
Dice hustler?

1076
00:53:27,032 --> 00:53:29,493
You're bad, Chan.
You are going straight to hell.

1077
00:53:30,286 --> 00:53:33,414
There is something romantic
about gamblers.

1078
00:53:33,872 --> 00:53:36,834
And old songs.
Meeting under the clock.

1079
00:53:37,626 --> 00:53:39,712
Yeah, maybe in movies,
but this is real life.

1080
00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:43,048
Real life is fine for people
who can't do any better.

1081
00:53:46,175 --> 00:53:49,785
It's been fun killing time with you.
Have fun with blue neves tonight.

1082
00:53:50,218 --> 00:53:51,928
- Who?
- Your skin doctor.

1083
00:53:53,388 --> 00:53:56,641
At least he knows enough not to
wind up in the egyptian tomb.

1084
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,276
- Vega!
- Francisco!

1085
00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:08,945
- Thanks for being here.
- It is always like this?

1086
00:54:10,738 --> 00:54:11,656
This is nothing.

1087
00:54:13,491 --> 00:54:16,411
I'm just signing one.
Thank you, thank you for being here.

1088
00:54:17,745 --> 00:54:19,330
Sorry, we have to go.
Sorry.

1089
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:24,711
- Francisco, who is the young lady?
- I'm no one.

1090
00:54:24,878 --> 00:54:27,164
- What do you do?
- I'm no one really.

1091
00:54:27,475 --> 00:54:31,395
I was Miss Amiability in Scottsdale.
Not really a big deal.

1092
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:32,711
Where did you guys meet?

1093
00:54:33,462 --> 00:54:34,379
Let's go, come on.

1094
00:54:36,602 --> 00:54:37,858
No story here.

1095
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:40,385
Okay, thank you.
Thank you for being here.

1096
00:54:40,788 --> 00:54:42,473
Ciao, ciao, ciao.

1097
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:46,065
That's it, that's it.
Alright, thank you for coming, thank you.

1098
00:54:47,177 --> 00:54:49,429
There is so much the public
wants to know about you.

1099
00:54:50,417 --> 00:54:54,045
Is it true that you were born on the
Orient Express right outside of Budapest.

1100
00:54:54,987 --> 00:54:57,138
Are your 2 sisters as
beautiful as you are?

1101
00:54:58,106 --> 00:55:00,067
Please be honest, 
but be modest.

1102
00:55:02,527 --> 00:55:03,737
They are, yeah.

1103
00:55:06,406 --> 00:55:07,657
They are actually even pretier.

1104
00:55:08,492 --> 00:55:09,637
Taylor especially.

1105
00:55:09,637 --> 00:55:12,261
She looks a little bit like
your girlfriend Tiffany Griffin.

1106
00:55:12,656 --> 00:55:14,283
- Could be worse.
- Yeah.

1107
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:21,707
Are you seriously considering
making remake of "White Heat"?

1108
00:55:21,873 --> 00:55:23,917
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Me?

1109
00:55:25,252 --> 00:55:28,422
Yeah. Sorry I shouldn't
have asked that.

1110
00:55:29,047 --> 00:55:31,842
Sorry, I've been drinking.

1111
00:55:33,176 --> 00:55:38,015
The candle lights are coloring
your face in quite an amazing way.

1112
00:55:40,689 --> 00:55:44,359
I'm sorry, you have a very
affective smile, you know?

1113
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:49,530
I couldn't help but ask
if you have a boyfriend or not.

1114
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:54,160
Do I have a boyfriend.
Is that what you're asking?

1115
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:01,042
Yes and, technically, no.

1116
00:56:02,356 --> 00:56:04,915
There's this boy at Yardley.

1117
00:56:07,158 --> 00:56:09,783
But he's just a boy.
He's a mere youth.

1118
00:56:11,069 --> 00:56:12,910
We dated a few times.

1119
00:56:14,145 --> 00:56:15,806
You must be crazy about him.

1120
00:56:16,548 --> 00:56:18,591
Is he the captain
of the football team?

1121
00:56:19,797 --> 00:56:22,633
Football?
Gatsby? No.

1122
00:56:23,151 --> 00:56:25,367
No, he doesn't play football.

1123
00:56:26,421 --> 00:56:28,389
He likes to figure
out the point spread.

1124
00:56:28,943 --> 00:56:30,531
So the mathematician.

1125
00:56:32,113 --> 00:56:33,657
Not exactly.

1126
00:56:34,575 --> 00:56:35,743
Gatsby is a...

1127
00:56:37,286 --> 00:56:38,662
Gatsby is very dear.

1128
00:56:40,451 --> 00:56:42,221
Very amusing.

1129
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:45,291
He's unusual.
Quaint.

1130
00:56:47,366 --> 00:56:50,805
That's the world I would
use to describe Gatsby - quaint.

1131
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:53,662
He's exotic.

1132
00:56:54,311 --> 00:57:00,834
Searching, shall we say, for his
romantic dream from a vanished age.

1133
00:57:04,073 --> 00:57:06,909
- What is this wine?
- It's Chateau Meyney.

1134
00:57:09,394 --> 00:57:11,438
I shouldn't imbibe so copiously.

1135
00:57:13,023 --> 00:57:16,276
Alcohol plays havoc on
my cerebral neurons.

1136
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:18,513
And how?

1137
00:57:20,209 --> 00:57:21,630
I lose my sensor.

1138
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:26,017
I become loose, uninhibited.

1139
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:31,280
passionate, aggressive, wicked.

1140
00:57:31,855 --> 00:57:32,832
Absurd.

1141
00:57:38,486 --> 00:57:39,403
Hello.

1142
00:57:40,488 --> 00:57:41,739
Is this where the poker game is?

1143
00:57:42,156 --> 00:57:44,075
- Who are you?
- My name is Gatsby Welles.

1144
00:57:44,286 --> 00:57:46,747
- Who?
- He's okay, that's Hunter's brother.

1145
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:50,581
I'm just going to take
Hunter's chair if that's alright.

1146
00:57:50,581 --> 00:57:53,042
Yeah, Hunter called and
said you might sit in.

1147
00:57:54,835 --> 00:57:56,624
You sure you want
to play this game?

1148
00:57:56,624 --> 00:57:58,317
He's alright.
Hunter says he's a shark.

1149
00:57:59,326 --> 00:58:01,244
- Better watch out for him.
- Like a guppy.

1150
00:58:02,663 --> 00:58:05,916
If you guys are worried,
I have a little something.

1151
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:08,418
- This kid is loaded.
- Have a seat then, my friend.

1152
00:58:22,647 --> 00:58:24,023
I will call that.

1153
00:58:28,892 --> 00:58:31,582
This is crazy.
Maybe something's happened to her?

1154
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,288
Maybe she's in 
some kind of trouble.

1155
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:35,250
Raise, two thousand.

1156
00:58:36,915 --> 00:58:38,955
Maybe the story 
led her into danger.

1157
00:58:39,112 --> 00:58:41,392
Maybe she was 
kidnapped or murdered.

1158
00:58:41,981 --> 00:58:43,274
Should I call the police?

1159
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:46,902
Of course, it would be so
embarrassing if she turn up alive.

1160
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:51,670
Hey kid, do you going to call or not?
That's two thousand dollars.

1161
00:58:59,674 --> 00:59:00,550
I raise you.

1162
00:59:03,928 --> 00:59:06,055
I reraise you.
All-in.

1163
00:59:48,534 --> 00:59:51,669
With temperature's in the 60s, 
rain is predicted this evening.

1164
00:59:51,669 --> 00:59:53,446
It will be heavy at times.

1165
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:55,741
And more of it tomorrow, 
mostly cloudy

1166
00:59:55,741 --> 00:59:57,940
with the chance of showers 
in the late afternoon.

1167
00:59:58,073 --> 01:00:01,260
On a brighter note: 
Francisco Vega is in town

1168
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,612
with his new 
main-squeeze on his own.

1169
01:00:03,765 --> 01:00:05,998
All our spies could
find out is that she's

1170
01:00:06,184 --> 01:00:09,017
Ashleigh Enright, a beauty queen,
from Tuscon, Arizona.

1171
01:00:09,017 --> 01:00:11,929
They were spotted later having
drinks over candle light, and

1172
01:00:11,929 --> 01:00:14,145
apparently exchaging 
sweet nothings.

1173
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:18,405
I was Miss Amiability in Scottsdale.
Not really a big deal.

1174
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:20,835
- How did you guys meet?
- Who's the girl?

1175
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:24,750
Good luck, Francisco,
we are all rooting for you.

1176
01:00:24,931 --> 01:00:27,183
That gorgeous couple,
as if they need out help.

1177
01:00:31,018 --> 01:00:32,603
Jesus, I need a drink.

1178
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:36,899
I need a drink.
I need a cigarette.

1179
01:00:38,776 --> 01:00:40,945
What I really need
is a Berlin ballad.

1180
01:00:54,292 --> 01:00:55,251
May I get you another?

1181
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:57,378
Yeah, why don't you
make it a double.

1182
01:00:57,378 --> 01:00:58,337
You want a double?

1183
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:01,385
It's okay, I won't be operating
any form of machinery.

1184
01:01:09,807 --> 01:01:10,668
Hello.

1185
01:01:12,777 --> 01:01:15,571
Mom, you have to give me a chance.
I said I was going to be there tonight.

1186
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:19,594
Ashleigh's fine.

1187
01:01:22,396 --> 01:01:24,894
Yes, I'll wear a tie and I'll
be there on time, okay?

1188
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:26,776
I can't really talk right now.

1189
01:01:36,085 --> 01:01:39,338
Francisco Vega.
A bullshit actor.

1190
01:01:39,881 --> 01:01:42,008
This guy is incapable 
of a real moment.

1191
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:47,500
All those manured gestures and all
that phony self-promoting liberal politics.

1192
01:01:47,883 --> 01:01:51,471
When he offered to set himself
on fire to protest climate change,

1193
01:01:51,471 --> 01:01:52,692
they should've let him.

1194
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:55,174
If that's Ashleigh's taste.

1195
01:01:56,343 --> 01:01:58,345
The world is full of
beautiful women.

1196
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:01,492
Sorry, are you talking to me?

1197
01:02:01,627 --> 01:02:03,649
I'm sorry, I was actually
talking to myself.

1198
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:06,541
I know the feeling.

1199
01:02:08,047 --> 01:02:10,041
Have you seen a movie
"Out of the Past"?

1200
01:02:10,374 --> 01:02:13,127
- Excuse me?
- Jane Greer and Robert Mitchum.

1201
01:02:14,587 --> 01:02:16,653
She was bad news.

1202
01:02:17,062 --> 01:02:18,542
It's the luck of the draw.

1203
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,207
- Are you alone?
- I am.

1204
01:02:21,508 --> 01:02:23,122
Unless you want
some company.

1205
01:02:24,957 --> 01:02:25,874
Sure.

1206
01:02:29,626 --> 01:02:30,720
- Hi.
- Hi.

1207
01:02:30,891 --> 01:02:33,589
- I'm Terry Ford.
- My name is Gatsby Welles.

1208
01:02:33,745 --> 01:02:35,455
What's the matter, Gatsby?
You seem gloom.

1209
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:38,958
My girlfriend dumped
me for a movie star.

1210
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,683
You know what they say:
you can't fight charisma.

1211
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,831
I didn't want to
drink in my room alone.

1212
01:02:49,322 --> 01:02:50,588
Are you staying here?

1213
01:02:50,835 --> 01:02:54,881
No, I've been coming here since they
used to only serve me ginger ales by law.

1214
01:02:55,164 --> 01:02:56,633
I love the piano players.

1215
01:02:57,728 --> 01:02:59,939
And now I'm old enough
to order gin and vermouth.

1216
01:03:01,104 --> 01:03:02,189
Time flies.

1217
01:03:02,892 --> 01:03:05,497
Yeah, unfortunately, 
it flies, coach.

1218
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,518
What's that supposed to mean?

1219
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,204
It's not always a
comfortable trip.

1220
01:03:12,948 --> 01:03:13,866
Tell me about it.

1221
01:03:16,044 --> 01:03:17,336
What are you doing
here all alone?

1222
01:03:18,807 --> 01:03:19,706
Working.

1223
01:03:20,572 --> 01:03:21,629
What do you do?

1224
01:03:22,067 --> 01:03:23,444
I make dreams come true.

1225
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:28,282
- How do you do that?
- Use your imaginion.

1226
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,998
Do we go someplace where
we could be more alone?

1227
01:03:38,712 --> 01:03:40,057
Sure.

1228
01:03:40,718 --> 01:03:41,653
Why not.

1229
01:03:41,962 --> 01:03:42,868
Okay.

1230
01:03:43,345 --> 01:03:44,596
I get five hundred, sweetie.

1231
01:03:46,264 --> 01:03:47,140
Five hundred?

1232
01:03:48,641 --> 01:03:49,559
Right.

1233
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:52,573
I know what's you are thinking.
Five hunderd seems pretty steep.

1234
01:03:53,777 --> 01:03:54,861
But it's New York.

1235
01:03:56,443 --> 01:03:57,944
How would you like
to make five thousand?

1236
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:00,007
Five thousand?

1237
01:04:01,953 --> 01:04:03,170
To do what?

1238
01:04:03,403 --> 01:04:05,536
Just to be my date for a
few hours at the party.

1239
01:04:06,345 --> 01:04:09,567
Clothes stay on, no fondling,
no exhange of fluids.

1240
01:04:10,198 --> 01:04:11,888
Just a little role playing.

1241
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,461
What kind of party?

1242
01:04:14,253 --> 01:04:18,633
Just my Mom's big fall,
bullshit blowout.

1243
01:04:19,492 --> 01:04:22,369
I won 15 G's in the poker game
and I need a date with me.

1244
01:04:22,909 --> 01:04:26,371
Classy item, who answers the
name of Ashleigh Enright.

1245
01:04:27,978 --> 01:04:29,652
- I hope I'm dressed okay.
- Absolutely.

1246
01:04:29,652 --> 01:04:30,642
It's a little fancy.

1247
01:04:31,179 --> 01:04:32,514
- You look perfrect.
- Okay.

1248
01:04:34,049 --> 01:04:36,179
These things can be a
little boring, alright?

1249
01:04:36,814 --> 01:04:38,214
Thank you for coming.

1250
01:04:38,569 --> 01:04:39,787
- Hey, Vega.
- How are you?

1251
01:04:39,787 --> 01:04:42,654
- Very good.
- Good to see you.

1252
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:44,432
This guy is the best cook.

1253
01:04:44,432 --> 01:04:46,378
You have to make 
on of those paella again.

1254
01:04:46,378 --> 01:04:47,672
- Hi, doll.
- Hey.

1255
01:04:48,691 --> 01:04:49,158
How are you?

1256
01:04:49,158 --> 01:04:51,224
I wondered if I could steal
you away for 2 minutes

1257
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:53,793
to talk about your fall schedule
and project with your name on it.

1258
01:04:53,793 --> 01:04:54,664
- Right now?
- Yes now.

1259
01:04:54,751 --> 01:04:56,878
Okay, okay, do you mind?
Just 2 minutes.

1260
01:04:56,878 --> 01:04:57,946
- Are you going to be okay?
- Yeah.

1261
01:04:57,946 --> 01:04:59,099
Yeah? Sure?

1262
01:04:59,471 --> 01:05:00,254
I'll be fast.

1263
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,520
Thank you.

1264
01:05:08,357 --> 01:05:10,253
- You're Gabriela Summers.
- Yes.

1265
01:05:10,253 --> 01:05:12,081
I have so many
questions for you.

1266
01:05:13,001 --> 01:05:14,586
- For my article.
- Okay.

1267
01:05:16,036 --> 01:05:18,498
It's not that much farther.
It's just up the corner here.

1268
01:05:18,793 --> 01:05:20,010
Great, I love to walk.

1269
01:05:20,151 --> 01:05:22,039
It's actually the 
same house I grew up in.

1270
01:05:23,273 --> 01:05:25,384
I bet you went to one
of those fancy school?

1271
01:05:25,384 --> 01:05:26,661
Yeah, I did.

1272
01:05:27,515 --> 01:05:31,143
Is true that all the kids there
have charge accounts at Bergdorf and Prada

1273
01:05:31,271 --> 01:05:33,724
and spend lots of money
and do lots of drugs?

1274
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:35,766
I wouldn't know, I didn't hang
out with the most of the kids.

1275
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:38,264
I just liked to watch old
movies and play my violin.

1276
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:39,802
It's kind of weird.

1277
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:42,542
You were a bookworm?

1278
01:05:42,967 --> 01:05:44,405
Not really.
My mother is just...

1279
01:05:45,196 --> 01:05:48,523
Culture vulture, according to
her I must visit this museum.

1280
01:05:48,523 --> 01:05:51,862
Or I must attend this piano
recital, or see this opera.

1281
01:05:52,146 --> 01:05:56,184
I must read my Henry James, even if Henry
James puts me to sleep, you know?

1282
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:58,046
I like Charlie Parker.

1283
01:05:58,538 --> 01:05:59,855
Who's that?

1284
01:06:00,751 --> 01:06:02,536
Forget it, that's alright.

1285
01:06:02,536 --> 01:06:03,941
You really are in a bad mood.

1286
01:06:04,978 --> 01:06:06,238
There you are.

1287
01:06:06,385 --> 01:06:07,373
Excuse me for the interruption.

1288
01:06:07,373 --> 01:06:09,250
- You're here.
- Yes, I am.

1289
01:06:09,896 --> 01:06:11,272
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

1290
01:06:11,982 --> 01:06:14,151
I had to get my
thoughts in line.

1291
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,561
You vanished off the planet.
Mr. tortured artist.

1292
01:06:17,865 --> 01:06:19,636
Can I speak to you
alone for a minute?

1293
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,116
Yeah.

1294
01:06:21,927 --> 01:06:23,957
I have actually been
dying to talk to you.

1295
01:06:24,369 --> 01:06:26,812
Your movie was so much better
than you let me to believe.

1296
01:06:26,812 --> 01:06:27,688
Yes?

1297
01:06:28,063 --> 01:06:32,067
And the climax was so moving.
It was very vintage Roland Pollard.

1298
01:06:33,277 --> 01:06:34,194
Sit.

1299
01:06:37,019 --> 01:06:39,730
I was afraid I wasn't
going to see you again.

1300
01:06:41,858 --> 01:06:44,819
Forgive me.
I'm a little drunk.

1301
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,613
We were very
worried about you.

1302
01:06:48,406 --> 01:06:52,994
I spent the day, thinking,
reflecting about my work, my life.

1303
01:06:55,788 --> 01:06:58,207
I want for us to get to
know each other, Ashleigh.

1304
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:00,585
You do?

1305
01:07:01,294 --> 01:07:03,921
Would you consider coming
with to the South of France?

1306
01:07:04,714 --> 01:07:06,007
The where of what?

1307
01:07:07,047 --> 01:07:12,303
Your voice is the only voice, that's
adding me clarity for me in ages.

1308
01:07:12,469 --> 01:07:16,473
The only voice that enouraged
me, what I actually believed in.

1309
01:07:18,225 --> 01:07:19,226
Like a muse.

1310
01:07:21,187 --> 01:07:23,200
I think you had too
much to drink today.

1311
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,866
I know I have.

1312
01:07:26,066 --> 01:07:26,942
Come with me.

1313
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:30,384
You can wake up every
morning, smelling orange trees.

1314
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:34,435
I'll talk to you about
my new movie

1315
01:07:34,735 --> 01:07:37,468
and I can learn from your
own spoiled honesty.

1316
01:07:39,843 --> 01:07:42,512
You can smell the orange trees.

1317
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:47,936
I think you are confusing me
with this like total, other Ashley.

1318
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:49,854
L-E-Y spelling.

1319
01:07:51,988 --> 01:07:53,531
I thought that was you!

1320
01:07:54,324 --> 01:07:55,241
Ashleigh.

1321
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,312
- You are here.
- I'm here.

1322
01:07:58,312 --> 01:08:00,444
Everybody's here.
Roland's here.

1323
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:02,670
I came with him.
I was trying...

1324
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:04,509
I was trying to figure
out a way to cantact you.

1325
01:08:05,429 --> 01:08:08,392
- I apologise for today.
- It's okay.

1326
01:08:08,392 --> 01:08:10,575
You were very very
understanding, thank you.

1327
01:08:10,755 --> 01:08:12,716
- I felt really bad for you.
- No, no, no, I'm fine.

1328
01:08:13,628 --> 01:08:16,926
I'm fine, I'm about as well
as it could be expected.

1329
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:17,884
Yeah.

1330
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,438
For a guy, that just
discovered that

1331
01:08:22,944 --> 01:08:25,454
- his wife is with his best friend.
- Yeah.

1332
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:27,745
- You're at the party!
- I am at the party.

1333
01:08:27,745 --> 01:08:29,641
I got home, I got 
to my appartment

1334
01:08:29,641 --> 01:08:31,954
and I was wondering 
why Connie's infidelity

1335
01:08:32,473 --> 01:08:34,387
didn't wound me as
deeply as it should.

1336
01:08:35,938 --> 01:08:38,998
I kept thinking about, I remembered
what you said about my movies.

1337
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:41,860
And I thought, my God, 
why is Ashleigh's

1338
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,945
approbation is so meanigful to me?

1339
01:08:44,543 --> 01:08:47,155
Really, it was.
And it strucked me, it stricked me.

1340
01:08:47,155 --> 01:08:48,759
You and I were 
thrown together.

1341
01:08:49,356 --> 01:08:54,536
We were trying to find a wandering
rogue Roland Pollard.

1342
01:08:54,536 --> 01:08:57,569
We had an adventure together.
And in the movie version.

1343
01:08:57,569 --> 01:09:01,107
In my movie version, the guy
who looks up and he realises

1344
01:09:01,547 --> 01:09:04,009
 he's fallen in 
love with the girl.

1345
01:09:05,692 --> 01:09:08,773
- I've played that role so many times.
- Writers like this does not come along...

1346
01:09:08,773 --> 01:09:09,691
- Hi.
- Hey.

1347
01:09:12,151 --> 01:09:14,464
I'm going to call Sam if you
don't answer me by Friday.

1348
01:09:14,464 --> 01:09:15,987
Yes, alright, ciao.

1349
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,843
- I'm sorry, it took me so long.
- It's so funny.

1350
01:09:18,962 --> 01:09:21,889
My father would always say when
drinking you should never mix

1351
01:09:22,196 --> 01:09:23,693
grain and grape together.

1352
01:09:24,074 --> 01:09:26,053
But I think they
go really good.

1353
01:09:28,508 --> 01:09:29,940
I think we should split.

1354
01:09:30,853 --> 01:09:31,917
We should split?

1355
01:09:36,283 --> 01:09:40,153
Gatsby, if you always intended to
come you should've told us.

1356
01:09:40,645 --> 01:09:42,939
You know I am
not fond of surprises.

1357
01:09:43,398 --> 01:09:47,193
Mother, Dad, this is
my girlfriend Ashleigh Enright.

1358
01:09:47,514 --> 01:09:48,432
Hi, how are you?

1359
01:09:49,149 --> 01:09:51,234
- How lovely to meet you, Ashleigh.
- You too.

1360
01:09:51,299 --> 01:09:53,181
- One's a pleasure.
- Hi, how are you?

1361
01:09:53,181 --> 01:09:54,694
- I'm well, thanks.
- Nice to meet you.

1362
01:09:54,694 --> 01:09:58,240
- I've done business with your father.
- Yes, he speaks very highly of you.

1363
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:01,493
Actually, I've never
met him, it's his bank.

1364
01:10:01,826 --> 01:10:03,787
Yes, he's got so many banks.

1365
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:07,108
How are things at Yardley?

1366
01:10:07,419 --> 01:10:11,256
It's very quiet, we get a lot of snow
in the winter, that sort of thing.

1367
01:10:11,633 --> 01:10:13,828
Very rural, but I chose 
it because they have

1368
01:10:13,951 --> 01:10:16,338
a great Kurdish 
studies program, yes.

1369
01:10:16,338 --> 01:10:18,196
Have you thought
more about the career?

1370
01:10:18,196 --> 01:10:21,616
Your father was bemoaning the fact
that you are still undecided.

1371
01:10:22,243 --> 01:10:23,753
I have, Leonard.

1372
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:25,922
I want to go into nuclear physics

1373
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:28,558
and maybe open a little 
store and sell dark matter.

1374
01:10:29,104 --> 01:10:30,353
He's kidding you. No.

1375
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:34,118
He likes to sit at the piano
and sing, and play blackjack.

1376
01:10:34,859 --> 01:10:38,812
And when you were a boy, your mother
wanted you to be a concert pianist.

1377
01:10:39,543 --> 01:10:41,307
She always had 
big plans for me.

1378
01:10:41,307 --> 01:10:43,202
How about you, Ashleigh?
What are your plans?

1379
01:10:43,202 --> 01:10:46,205
- She wants to be a journalist, actually.
- TV or print?

1380
01:10:46,321 --> 01:10:48,725
- Political stuff, she'll report from all of the...
- TV, I'd like to do the weather.

1381
01:10:48,959 --> 01:10:49,954
Troubled spots.

1382
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:51,357
On the weather.

1383
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:57,312
Right.

1384
01:11:00,007 --> 01:11:04,025
You've been staring at Ashleigh all
night long, is there something wrong?

1385
01:11:04,531 --> 01:11:06,708
There is something
about that girl.

1386
01:11:06,857 --> 01:11:08,297
She's quite pretty.

1387
01:11:08,641 --> 01:11:11,039
And sophisticated for 
a young girl.

1388
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:22,825
Come on in.

1389
01:11:25,756 --> 01:11:27,007
- Look at this place.
- Nice, isn't it?

1390
01:11:28,111 --> 01:11:31,740
What was that all about with
Ted Davidoff and Rollie Pollard?

1391
01:11:32,854 --> 01:11:33,951
We were just talking.

1392
01:11:34,218 --> 01:11:35,571
Yeah? Alright.

1393
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:37,936
Don't worry.

1394
01:11:38,849 --> 01:11:41,252
I'm sure they are very interested
in that story you are writing.

1395
01:11:42,051 --> 01:11:43,802
Today has been 
quite a story.

1396
01:11:45,879 --> 01:11:48,672
And that's just the beginning.
Please, sit down.

1397
01:11:49,512 --> 01:11:50,546
Relax.

1398
01:11:52,816 --> 01:11:54,109
This is really amazing.

1399
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:56,382
She's very charming.

1400
01:11:56,853 --> 01:11:59,126
And hot, you didn't
say Ashleigh was hot.

1401
01:11:59,276 --> 01:12:01,612
- I told you she was sexy.
- Is she older than you?

1402
01:12:02,632 --> 01:12:03,550
She looks older.

1403
01:12:04,914 --> 01:12:06,791
That's what you want,
a little experience.

1404
01:12:08,561 --> 01:12:10,064
You have to grow up
and have a profession.

1405
01:12:10,064 --> 01:12:12,738
You think a girl like that
wants to live hand to mouth.

1406
01:12:13,464 --> 01:12:14,924
Funny you should
put it that way.

1407
01:12:16,751 --> 01:12:18,920
Keep your hand on
the wheel, Ashleigh.

1408
01:12:20,932 --> 01:12:23,120
He obviously wants
to go to bed with you.

1409
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,740
How do you feel about this?

1410
01:12:29,055 --> 01:12:30,098
You have a boyfriend.

1411
01:12:31,766 --> 01:12:32,683
Yes, but...

1412
01:12:34,526 --> 01:12:36,110
This is Francisco Vega.

1413
01:12:37,904 --> 01:12:40,113
Apart from him, being so sexy.

1414
01:12:41,799 --> 01:12:43,486
He's an international icon.

1415
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:47,119
Mahatma Gandhi.

1416
01:12:48,147 --> 01:12:49,273
How can you say no?

1417
01:12:50,816 --> 01:12:52,818
This is the story you can
tell your grandchildren.

1418
01:12:54,487 --> 01:12:55,696
May I show you upstairs?

1419
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:58,263
Sure.

1420
01:12:58,592 --> 01:13:00,593
If you liked it here, you're
going to love it over there.

1421
01:13:00,593 --> 01:13:01,781
Okay.

1422
01:13:02,793 --> 01:13:04,031
I got us some whiskey.

1423
01:13:06,788 --> 01:13:07,873
Is this where you sleep?

1424
01:13:08,444 --> 01:13:09,599
Yeah,

1425
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,266
when I sleep.

1426
01:13:12,459 --> 01:13:15,871
You can see the whole apartment
from here, it's quite special.

1427
01:13:15,871 --> 01:13:17,471
- Nice.
- Yeah, I know.

1428
01:13:18,087 --> 01:13:19,005
I know.

1429
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:30,523
Let me help you.

1430
01:13:34,407 --> 01:13:35,575
Look at you.

1431
01:13:36,951 --> 01:13:39,663
Who the hell is that?
Give me a sec.

1432
01:13:40,901 --> 01:13:43,362
- Yes?
- It's Tiffany! I'm home!

1433
01:13:44,609 --> 01:13:46,531
I thought you two
weren't together anymore.

1434
01:13:46,531 --> 01:13:47,924
No, we...
Oh no!

1435
01:13:48,747 --> 01:13:49,563
Wait a second.

1436
01:13:50,315 --> 01:13:51,472
It's going to be fine.

1437
01:13:52,206 --> 01:13:53,810
You said that you weren't
together anymore.

1438
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:54,859
Yeah, I know...

1439
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:56,761
You know what,
you have to hide there.

1440
01:13:56,908 --> 01:13:58,135
Go behind that door.

1441
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:00,587
Go, she can't see you.
Go.

1442
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:14,491
- Surprise! Hi!
- What are you doing here?

1443
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:15,614
We wrapped 2 days early.

1444
01:14:15,614 --> 01:14:17,944
I'm so glad you are home 
it's starting to pour.

1445
01:14:18,531 --> 01:14:19,740
I just got off the plane.

1446
01:14:21,465 --> 01:14:23,355
I bet you weren't
expecting me.

1447
01:14:23,811 --> 01:14:25,099
I'm loving this.

1448
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,403
Fransciso, why are you...
What are you doing running around?

1449
01:14:30,781 --> 01:14:32,425
Getting ready for you.

1450
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:39,509
Welcome back.

1451
01:14:41,265 --> 01:14:44,268
I just got off the plane.
We wrapped 2 days early.

1452
01:14:45,171 --> 01:14:48,591
I came right from airport.
I knew If I'm being surprise I'll arouse you.

1453
01:14:52,194 --> 01:14:54,405
Baby. I've missed you.

1454
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:55,874
Yeah, me too.

1455
01:14:55,874 --> 01:14:57,207
I've missed you too.

1456
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:04,582
What was that?

1457
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:09,862
- I didn't hear anything.
- I'm sure I heard something.

1458
01:15:16,582 --> 01:15:17,594
- Baby.
- One sec.

1459
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:27,627
Come back, that was nothing.

1460
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:34,666
Excuse me, which
way the Waldorfl is?

1461
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:38,691
What's on your mind, mother?

1462
01:16:43,193 --> 01:16:44,738
I want to have
a word with you.

1463
01:16:44,915 --> 01:16:45,618
No, no.

1464
01:16:45,618 --> 01:16:47,584
Please don't do this
to me tonight, mom.

1465
01:16:47,718 --> 01:16:50,848
I'm not really in the mood for one of
your tete-a-tete's where I come out

1466
01:16:50,848 --> 01:16:53,827
on the short end as always.
I really couldn't take it tonight.

1467
01:16:53,945 --> 01:16:55,499
Okay?
Where is Ashleigh?

1468
01:16:55,499 --> 01:16:58,479
- I asked her to leave.
- What? Why?

1469
01:16:58,626 --> 01:17:00,670
Don't give me that
Ashleigh bullshit.

1470
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:03,014
I smelled hooker the second
she walked through the door.

1471
01:17:03,629 --> 01:17:04,797
Mother, do you
hear yourself?

1472
01:17:05,424 --> 01:17:07,249
Damn right I hear myself.

1473
01:17:07,728 --> 01:17:09,183
I'm shoked.

1474
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:13,003
Okay, I apologise.

1475
01:17:14,303 --> 01:17:17,033
I met her in the bar at Carlyle
and I gave her five thousand bucks

1476
01:17:17,033 --> 01:17:19,984
to pretend she was Ashleigh,
who has dumped me.

1477
01:17:19,984 --> 01:17:21,525
Five thousand?!

1478
01:17:21,749 --> 01:17:25,127
It was worth that much for you
to make a fool of your father and me?

1479
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:28,328
I was in a bad mood, it was
my idea of a joke.

1480
01:17:28,328 --> 01:17:29,910
So it was a bad joke, okay?

1481
01:17:30,075 --> 01:17:33,996
I won a lot in a card game, so...
It was an act of rebellion.

1482
01:17:34,206 --> 01:17:37,251
- It was an act of hostility.
- Hostility and rebellion.

1483
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,613
Rebellion against what?

1484
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:42,946
Private schools, a nice
home, summers in Europe?

1485
01:17:43,113 --> 01:17:45,530
Against a life of pretentious
appropriateness:

1486
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:48,013
appropriate friends,
appropriate schools,

1487
01:17:48,013 --> 01:17:51,515
appropriate women, that you
may or may not approve of.

1488
01:17:52,142 --> 01:17:55,061
You resent me
because I set a high bar.

1489
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:57,830
Mother, I don't resent you
because you set a high bar.

1490
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:59,473
I just want you to see me.

1491
01:17:59,619 --> 01:18:02,652
I'm never going to be like Hunter.
I'm not going to roll off the assembly line

1492
01:18:02,652 --> 01:18:03,919
and make you proud.

1493
01:18:04,151 --> 01:18:07,047
You lied to me when you said that
you were too busy to come to my party.

1494
01:18:07,129 --> 01:18:10,399
That you were too busy at
work, snowed under at Yardley.

1495
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:14,213
I did lie to you, because I didn't
want to come to your party, alright?

1496
01:18:14,213 --> 01:18:18,223
I wanted to spend the day with Ashleigh
in the city and have a great time.

1497
01:18:18,223 --> 01:18:19,234
Where is Ashleigh?

1498
01:18:19,265 --> 01:18:21,383
I told you she dumped me.
We became separated.

1499
01:18:21,454 --> 01:18:23,135
This city has its own agenda.

1500
01:18:23,313 --> 01:18:25,706
And your rage with 
me is so great

1501
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:28,426
that you express it by 
bringing home a whore?

1502
01:18:28,426 --> 01:18:29,732
An escort, Mother.

1503
01:18:30,123 --> 01:18:32,024
Let's not split pubic hairs.

1504
01:18:32,345 --> 01:18:35,681
Anything to shake up that
collection of appropriate snobs.

1505
01:18:36,265 --> 01:18:40,895
So you bring her to my gala as
your girlfriend to make a fool of me?

1506
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,165
I'm sorry.

1507
01:18:43,215 --> 01:18:44,130
I don't know why 
I'm like this.

1508
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:47,125
I don't know where I get this perverse 
streak in my system from.

1509
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:48,189
I don't know.

1510
01:18:49,254 --> 01:18:50,984
You get it from me.

1511
01:18:51,657 --> 01:18:54,982
I get it from you,
the queen of good taste?

1512
01:18:59,492 --> 01:19:00,368
Alright.

1513
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,994
You're a big enough boy to hear
the whole inappropriate story.

1514
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:10,208
I met your father,

1515
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:15,171
in the exact same 
line of work.

1516
01:19:17,215 --> 01:19:18,508
An escort service.

1517
01:19:20,467 --> 01:19:23,178
Or more to the point: hooking.

1518
01:19:24,846 --> 01:19:28,892
As that working girl you
tried to slip pass us as Ashleigh Enright.

1519
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:31,840
What?

1520
01:19:33,206 --> 01:19:34,540
Lower your eyebrows.

1521
01:19:38,461 --> 01:19:40,582
I knocked on your 
father's hotel room door

1522
01:19:40,582 --> 01:19:42,651
because that's how 
I made my living.

1523
01:19:44,126 --> 01:19:45,503
Fresh from Gary, Indiana.

1524
01:19:47,688 --> 01:19:53,735
Providing the lonely male of the
species with a little casual recreation.

1525
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:56,099
For a fee.

1526
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:01,422
Except in you father's
case we fell in love.

1527
01:20:03,696 --> 01:20:05,555
And not only do we marry.

1528
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:09,721
Winston used my hardened
nest egg to start the company

1529
01:20:10,179 --> 01:20:13,766
that has enabled us to
live a pretty privileged life.

1530
01:20:15,022 --> 01:20:17,858
You following?
Or am I going too fast?

1531
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:22,112
And I put myself
through school,

1532
01:20:22,279 --> 01:20:26,408
so my brilliant young son
can laugh at my pretentious.

1533
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:36,215
What I'm saying is that, if I have
been to over too far in my pursuit

1534
01:20:36,215 --> 01:20:40,541
of the finer things and
of cultivating an image.

1535
01:20:41,923 --> 01:20:44,259
If I have caused
you some discomfort.

1536
01:20:46,255 --> 01:20:49,569
It's only an overzealous 
ex-professional hustler

1537
01:20:49,569 --> 01:20:52,273
from the mid west, 
trying to erradicate

1538
01:20:53,568 --> 01:20:59,083
unsavory remnants of many hotel
rooms I still wake up screaming over.

1539
01:21:00,278 --> 01:21:03,466
And if you can't understand
where you get your

1540
01:21:03,466 --> 01:21:06,433
mysterious urge to consort
with a demi-monde.

1541
01:21:08,656 --> 01:21:09,949
You have my genes.

1542
01:21:13,781 --> 01:21:17,576
And I'm sorry to lay this X-rated tale
on my sweet college boy,

1543
01:21:17,677 --> 01:21:20,814
but something tells
me that the time is right.

1544
01:21:48,384 --> 01:21:51,178
Just put on the chairs and
then we done, alright?

1545
01:21:52,763 --> 01:21:54,724
- Hey, Gatsby.
- Hey, Johnny.

1546
01:22:43,104 --> 01:22:44,647
I saw you on television.

1547
01:22:49,011 --> 01:22:50,047
Nothing happened.

1548
01:22:51,445 --> 01:22:53,990
I'm really exhausted.
I've been walking forever.

1549
01:22:54,532 --> 01:22:55,964
And then I got 
lost on the train.

1550
01:22:55,964 --> 01:22:58,442
Ashleigh, you were
with a famous movie star.

1551
01:22:59,061 --> 01:23:00,492
But nothing happened.

1552
01:23:00,943 --> 01:23:02,163
I'd love to believe you.

1553
01:23:04,915 --> 01:23:07,877
Just too many drinks,
too much weed.

1554
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:11,739
I'm just a little
too tired to explain.

1555
01:23:12,474 --> 01:23:16,019
Tomorrow, I promise, but really
Gatsby, nothing happened.

1556
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:21,435
Take off your rain coat, I'm going to
get you some black coffee.

1557
01:23:22,739 --> 01:23:24,783
I can't, I have no 
clothes underneath.

1558
01:23:28,004 --> 01:23:31,965
So with Roland Pollard
it was like a spiritual thing.

1559
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,259
I was his muse, some 
inspiration because he's...

1560
01:23:35,731 --> 01:23:38,150
Really going through a 
rough creative period.

1561
01:23:38,818 --> 01:23:42,738
And also, my name is totally 
the same as his first wife's.

1562
01:23:42,908 --> 01:23:46,119
Who also went to Yardley.
Who he's never really gotten over.

1563
01:23:46,411 --> 01:23:47,990
And then Ted Davidoff.

1564
01:23:48,709 --> 01:23:52,584
He was just absolutely traumatized 
by this affair his wife was having

1565
01:23:52,584 --> 01:23:53,843
with his best friend.

1566
01:23:53,912 --> 01:23:55,222
And there I was, you know.

1567
01:23:55,355 --> 01:24:00,658
Just a person there to talk to, 
to hold his hand, during the crisis.

1568
01:24:01,294 --> 01:24:02,629
What about Francisco Vega?

1569
01:24:03,525 --> 01:24:05,777
Like James Dean, 
minus the acting chops?

1570
01:24:05,937 --> 01:24:09,538
Francisco Vega was just after my body.
But I was onto him.

1571
01:24:09,832 --> 01:24:12,230
And I have a terrific 
material for a hot story.

1572
01:24:12,230 --> 01:24:13,447
I dated a hunk.

1573
01:24:14,303 --> 01:24:15,513
What about you?

1574
01:24:16,435 --> 01:24:18,645
How was going to 
your Mom's fahrey?

1575
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:21,732
It was pretty nice, actually.

1576
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,523
We got in a sort of a 
crazy conversation.

1577
01:24:26,945 --> 01:24:29,943
For the first time in my life 
she surprised me in a good way.

1578
01:24:31,214 --> 01:24:32,506
Now I feel closer to her.

1579
01:24:34,028 --> 01:24:37,031
Must have been a big talk.
What did you discuss?

1580
01:24:38,671 --> 01:24:40,048
The oldest profession.

1581
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:42,744
Journalism?

1582
01:24:44,408 --> 01:24:45,826
That's the second oldest.

1583
01:24:47,051 --> 01:24:49,887
Let's put it in this way, she's a 
lot more than I gave her credit for.

1584
01:24:51,006 --> 01:24:52,132
I sold her short.

1585
01:24:53,192 --> 01:24:55,778
What a shame we never 
got to take that carriage ride.

1586
01:24:55,945 --> 01:24:57,260
We can still do it.

1587
01:24:57,559 --> 01:24:59,302
We have plenty of 
time, we can get it in.

1588
01:24:59,839 --> 01:25:01,397
Said the John to my mom.

1589
01:25:02,022 --> 01:25:03,985
- What?
- Nothing.

1590
01:25:04,202 --> 01:25:06,204
We should probably leave 
our luggage downstairs.

1591
01:25:06,627 --> 01:25:09,088
As you know I'd hate to 
miss our bus back to Yardley.

1592
01:25:21,642 --> 01:25:23,227
New York on a misty day.

1593
01:25:25,229 --> 01:25:27,564
I can't tell why it means something 
to me, but it means everything.

1594
01:25:29,595 --> 01:25:32,139
It's only one carriage ride 
and the weather's gloomy.

1595
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:38,719
I couldn't really sleep last night.
Did you hear all those fire engines?

1596
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:39,682
I did.

1597
01:25:40,109 --> 01:25:42,198
The roaring traffic's boom.

1598
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:44,871
Silence in my lonely room.

1599
01:25:45,268 --> 01:25:48,397
I know that! That's from 
Shakespeare, right?

1600
01:25:55,404 --> 01:25:56,696
Sir, would you stop 
for a second?

1601
01:25:57,427 --> 01:26:00,222
- Why are we stoping?
- Ashleigh, you go back to Yardley.

1602
01:26:00,632 --> 01:26:02,606
- I'm going to stay in New York.
- What?

1603
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,909
I need a carbon 
monoxide to survive.

1604
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:08,913
- What are you talking about?
- We are two different creatures, right?

1605
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:11,958
You like the sound of crickets 
and I like the rattle of the taxies.

1606
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:14,277
You blosom in 
the sun and me...

1607
01:26:14,441 --> 01:26:16,281
I come into my 
own under grey skies.

1608
01:26:16,843 --> 01:26:19,929
You were a big hit here, you 
are a crackerjack reporter.

1609
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:23,922
You were loved spiritually, emotionally and 
physically by 3 gifted men, right?

1610
01:26:24,122 --> 01:26:25,402
- Yeah.
- You don't want to be with me.

1611
01:26:25,402 --> 01:26:26,898
You deserve better than I am.

1612
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:29,483
Are you dropping 
out of Yardley?

1613
01:26:30,736 --> 01:26:32,219
If I won't sound 
to pretentious:

1614
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:33,931
I want to review
my other options.

1615
01:26:33,931 --> 01:26:36,309
Excuse me, sir, do you think 
it's possible to take her to Pierre hotel?

1616
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:38,842
- Gatsby, I do not understand.
- You take this. Just take this.

1617
01:26:39,177 --> 01:26:40,972
Get your luggage 
and return to Yardley.

1618
01:26:41,994 --> 01:26:43,915
So you're not 
coming back to Yardley?

1619
01:26:44,865 --> 01:26:47,119
I don't know Ash, I have to 
figure some stuff out of my life.

1620
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:49,997
Have a great trip and you tell 
everybody at Yardley I said goodbye.

1621
01:26:50,164 --> 01:26:52,041
So you're not 
coming back to Yardley?

1622
01:26:53,427 --> 01:26:54,735
Gatsby.

1623
01:26:54,979 --> 01:26:56,609
Wait, sir, I'm...

1624
01:26:57,784 --> 01:26:59,880
Gatsby, I don't understand.

1625
01:27:09,263 --> 01:27:12,516
Could you hurry?
I think it's starting to rain.

1626
01:28:49,427 --> 01:28:51,134
How did I know you'd be here.

1627
01:28:51,134 --> 01:28:53,547
You didn't think I was going 
to blow this moment, did you?

1628
01:28:53,547 --> 01:28:55,234
What about the skin doctor?

1629
01:28:55,595 --> 01:29:00,090
Very handsome, very rich 
and very clever, but I'm here.

1630
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:03,164
For a kiss that was a 
maximum of an eight?

1631
01:29:04,189 --> 01:29:06,858
It's fall.
By spring I'll have you up to 10.

1632
01:29:30,478 --> 01:29:35,283
