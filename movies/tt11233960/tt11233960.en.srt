00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:33,708
[Vince] The release plan. Read it.
It's how you stay out of here.

but I can't keep that up--</i>

00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,875
[Vince] Does your release alter the terms
of your no-contact order? Yes or no?

23
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:24,791
No.

24
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,500
[Vince] Can you reach out
to the victim's family? Yes or no?

25
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,750
No.

26
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,458
[Vince] Couple weeks
staring at the ceiling,

27
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,583
people sometimes wanna make amends.

28

[Vince] The main thing
for success is a job.

35
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,416
- You either have, or you're looking.
- Got a job. Carpentry.

36
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,416
[Vince] Hmm.

37
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, if it doesn't pan out,
I got a friend in seafood packing.

38
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,791
My man, Stan.
He takes my people on a trial basis.

39
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm good.

40
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,625
Take the card.

41
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,875
Take the card.

42
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,208

00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,416
Except for you.

47
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,750
Have you been taking your meds?

48
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,916
- Yes, Dad. Jesus.
- Hey.

[door opens]

50
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,958
- Katherine.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

51
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,208
You don't need to be sorry.

52
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,583
- I didn't mean to freak you out.
- Don't worry.

53
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,750
So what do we know?

54
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:56,666
Oh. She's got a broken rib,
dislocated shoulder, and a concussion.

55
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,958
When you get out of the hospital,
you need to come stay with us for a while.

56
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,916
- No, Dad. I'm fine.
- I think that's a good idea.

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,458
My recital's coming up.

58
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,208
[dad] Well, we'll cross
that bridge when we come to it.

59
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,041
You can practice at home.

You and I will meet here
every Tuesday, 11:00 a.m. without fail.

00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,125
Thanks for the ride.

[woman 1] You sold my stuff!
I had to walk all the way downtown!

[woman 2] I worked with you for months.

67
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,958

House rules are simple.

No fightin', stealin',
destroying property.

74
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,333
[woman 4] Come on, get up.

75
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,250
Shower. Ten minutes.

76
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,958
- Everything else, use your common sense.
- [woman yelling]

77
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,541
- [woman 5] How about a knock?
- Val, you know the rules.

78
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,541
Ladies. Your new roommate, Ruth.

79
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,791
You can all introduce yourselves.

80
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,291
I'll let you get settled in.

Hey, dickhead.

00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,875
We're gonna just let this go?

84
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,958
Twenty years of Dad's life,

85
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,083
and this bitch
gets out early for good behavior?

86
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,291
What is that?
You think Dad would want that?

87
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,583
How do I know what Dad would want, Keith?

88
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,458
What is it? Stress, huh?

89
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,708
Doc's put me back on something.

90
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,791
It'll go away.

91
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,166
[man] Hey.

92
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,916
There's nothing we can do about it anyway.

93
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,625
I'm thinking you and me,
couple of baseball bats.

94
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,958
[scoffs]

95
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,416
Yeah, that'd solve
all our problems, and then what?

96
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,500
Come on, man.

97
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,375
I drove to Purdy.

98
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,333
And I watched that bitch walk out.

99
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,541
Hey, you need to leave this alone.

100
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,000
You're not with me on this?

101
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,125
No, I'm not with you.
I got a family. I got a kid.

102
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,666
She's living in Chinatown.

103
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,750
Hey.

104
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,875
- But what about Dad?
- Now, look.

105
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,583
You need to leave this alone.

- [mom] Hmm.

109
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,291
I don't know if it's my state of mind,
but these papers are worse than ever.

110
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,375
- [dad] <i>Lord of the Flies?</i>
- [mom] Mmm-hmm.

111
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:52,875
This student is writing about
how Piggy was made into an "escape goat."

112
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,000
They said she was drifting
before she ran the light.

113
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,291
She was just distracted.

114
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,583
It's… a coincidence?

115
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,333
The release letter?
There's no way Katherine saw that.

116
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:24,208
It's just… the same day.

117
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,541
- What if she tries to find Katherine?
- She can't.

118
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,833
And this was an accident.

119
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,333
It has nothing to do with Ruth Slater.

What do you even get somebody
for their retirement?

141
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,208
A fishing rod or something?

162
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,291
Ruth!

163
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,791
[birds chirping]

164
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,375
[woman] Whose idea was it?

165
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,958
You can either tell me the truth,
or I'll find out. Your choice.

166
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,375
[footsteps approaching]

167
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,416
The ramp?

168
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,333
All right. Well, you guys know my advice.

169
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,541
- No outside counsel.
- [man] Got it.

170
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,625
I did it.

171
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,416
- How'd you do it, Ryan?
- I just did it.

172
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,875
I dragged the wood over
and put it up on bricks.

173
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,083
[man 2] Uh, Mrs. Ingram?

174
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,666
- You're both grounded.
- [Ryan] What?

175
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,291
- That's not fair.
- I said I did it.

176
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,416
Those pieces of wood are 70 pounds each.
It's a two-man job.

177
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,958
Mrs. Ingram,
you wanna take a look at this?

178
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,875
[woman] Mmm.

179
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,250
Creepy.

180
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,958
People put baby shoes in walls
to protect them from evil spirits.

181
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,583
Leave 'em in there.
Someone put 'em in there for a reason.

182
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,083
Love y'all. [kisses]

183
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,958
- [man] Bye, babe.
- [woman] Bye, babe.

184
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,791
[door closes]

185
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,125
- [man] Who got air?
- [chuckles]

186
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,416
[man chuckles]

187
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,000
[woman] He totally loves her.
You don't know what you're talking about.

188
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,083
They met on a beach in Maui.

189
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:19,041
No, they were laughing
when you left the room. [laughs]

190
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,250
No, seriously,
like, we're gonna lose this deal

191
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,666
if you don't pull it together.

192
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,500
They were laughing at you when you left.

193
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,541
- [tires screech]
- [people shouting]

194
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,000
[high-pitched squealing]

195
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,291
[woman on phone] Hey!

196
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,916
[man] Just start pushing, man.
Just go, go, go!

197
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,583
- [man] Get in there. Come on.
- [man 2] Hey, hey! Calm down!

198
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,416
[man 3] Hurry up, man!

199
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,208
[man catcalling]

200
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,708
[man] <i>Don't know what to tell ya.</i>

201
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,250
It says I start today, second shift.

202
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,583
Nope.

203
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,000
I got my carpentry certificate.
I did a year of welding.

204
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:05,041
I don't need birdhouses
and stop signs. Okay?

205
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,083
Did you get a phone call or a visitor

206
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,291
between when I had a job
and when I didn't?

207
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,625
Okay.

208
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,666
[machines whirring]

209
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,250
[man] Ah, come on. Show us a little more.

210
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,041
[Stan] After two hours, you get a break.
After five hours, you get lunch.

211
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,500
Another two hours, you get another break.

212
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,416
You gotta leave the line
to take a waz or something, go ahead.

213
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,708
But make sure that you're telling a person
where you're going and how long you'll be.

214
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,625
Here on the floor,
keep your head on a swivel, all right?

215
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,333
Everything here is sharp.
Everything's heavy.

216
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,250
Everything can hurt you. Be careful.

217
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,916
These guys are gonna help you out.
Welcome to the graveyard shift.

218
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:01,958
[man] Hey.

219
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,625
- [man] You speak English?
- Yeah.

220
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,416
That's Magda. I'm Blake.

221
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,708
Just do what we do.

222
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,333
[car horn honks]

223
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,250
Hey. You need a ride someplace?

224
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,416
You sure?

225
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,375
You look freezing cold.

226
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,791
See you tomorrow.

227
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,333
[knocking at door]

228
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,083
[knocking at door]

229
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,958
[woman] Hey. You're past your ten.

230
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,916
- [door unlocks]
- What the fuck?

231
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,833
- [woman] Hurry up!
- [banging on door]

232
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,666
[grunts]

233
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,791
[woman] Drag your bitch-ass out next time.

234
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,083
[horn honks loudly]

235
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,791
[siren wailing]

236
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,375
[blowing]

237
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,083
John.

238
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,125
There's a woman in the front yard.

239
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,083
You know who she is?

240
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,666
[telephone ringing]

241
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,083
[telephone ringing]

242
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,833
- [Ruth] Not leaving. Not leaving, Mac.
- [Mac] <i>I hear you.</i>

243
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,541
<i>I know that your daddy would not
want you gettin' in deeper trouble.</i>

244
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,625
[Ruth] Bullshit, Mac.

245
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,833
[Mac] <i>I just want you</i>
<i>to consider your little sister.</i>

246
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:45,541
[Ruth] I've got a gun, and I swear to God,
they come in this house, I'm gonna use it.

247
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,250
- [Mac] <i>Help me help you.</i>
- [Ruth] Get…

248
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,250
You can come stay with us.

249
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,666
Boys can bunk in the basement.
You and Katie can have the bedroom.

250
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,833
- [Ruth] <i>We're not leaving. Stop.</i>
- [Mac] Beth would love to have you.

251
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,875
[Ruth] You know the second I step out
of here, they're gonna take her from me.

252
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,500
We are not leaving!

253
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,375
Get off my porch! I'm not leaving--

254
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:03,958
[John] Hello.

255
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:06,875
Hello.

256
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,041
Can I help you with something?

257
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,166
I was just looking
at everything you've done.

258
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,875
It's really beautiful.

259
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,416
You one of our neighbors?

260
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,541
Uh, just…
I just did some work on the house.

261
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,333
Way back.

262
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,375
- We just moved in a few months ago.
- [Ruth] Yeah?

263
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:31,000
- The remodel?
- No, no. Before that.

264
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,708
Yeah, I just did finishes.

265
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,750
Um, some built-ins
and a hutch, stuff like that.

266
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,416
The hutch in the entry?

267
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,375
We both love that thing.

268
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,416
That's what sold my wife on the house.

269
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,500
She actually-- She just repainted it
to match the new interior.

270
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,291
I bet that looks great.

271
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,333
Well, you can come in
and have a look if you want.

272
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,458
Oh, no. I don't… I don't wanna interrupt.

273
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:03,000
You're not interrupting.
We're not doing anything.

274
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,833
- Are you sure?
- [chuckling] I'm sure.

275
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:07,916
Come on. Uh…

276
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:09,958
I'm John Ingram, by the way.

277
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,375
- Ruth.
- Hey, Ruth. Come on.

278
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,750
[door opens]

279
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,166
This is it.

280
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,250
Hun, this is Ruth.

281
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,541
Ruth, Liz.

282
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:39,125
She did work on the house.
In fact, she built the hutch.

283
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:41,541
Which is a good thing.

284
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:44,250
Otherwise, I would have had to buy
some fancy piece of furniture.

285
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,416
[muffled laughter]

286
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,333
And drop some pro bono work.

287
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,916
[Liz] You know the Balabans?

288
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
[Ruth] Uh…

289
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,333
Uh, before them, when it was a farm.

290
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,000
[Liz] Oh.

291
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:05,208
Yeah, 'cause we found
some baby shoes in the wall.

292
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:09,916
[Ruth] Hmm.

293
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,500
Yeah, I didn't… I didn't know them.

294
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,333
You live in the neighborhood?

295
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,875
My sister and I did.

296
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,708
[John] And where do you live now?

297
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:28,250
Mmm, in… in Seattle.

298
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,291
Ruth!

299
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,708
[high-pitched squeal]

300
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:38,666
- [boy] Mom. Is my laptop downstairs?
- [gasps]

301
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,416
- Whose job is that?
- [John] Try the TV room.

302
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:45,375
Uh, I didn't really realize
how late it was. I need to get going.

303
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,166
But thank you very much
for letting me see your beautiful home.

304
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,000
[breathing heavily]

305
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,666
Hey, how far is your car parked?

306
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,958
Uh, I'm gonna catch the bus.
If I run, I'll be okay.

307
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:06,416
Ruth, stop, just give me a minute.

308
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,833
It's getting dark.
I'm gonna give you a ride.

309
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,500
And you don't remember
the people you worked for?

310
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,416
I… I don't remember.

311
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,250
- Really?
- It's been so long.

312
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:33,708
You're a lawyer?

313
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,958
Yeah. How did you know that?

314
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:39,291
- Pro bono?
- Oh yeah.

315
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,375
What kind of law do you do?

316
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:46,500
Corporate.

317
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:50,791
I do some trust work.

318
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:51,833
[Ruth] Hmm.

319
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,041
Um…

320
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,250
I've actually been looking
for someone who does family law,

321
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,041
and I don't know
if you know anybody that--

322
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,375
What are you up to?

323
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,125
Look, you've been lying
since you said hello.

324
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:17,708
When people want a lawyer,
they just call one up.

325
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:20,916
Something's not right.

326
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,666
Ruth.

327
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,166
What's up with you?

328
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,166
I lived in that house
with my little sister

329
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,666
when my parents died.

330
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,583
Went into the system.

331
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:46,416
She got adopted, and that's just
the last place I was with her.

332
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:53,583
I wrote her for years
and, you know, I didn't…

333
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:57,500
I didn't hear anything back. I don't know.
I don't even know if she's alive.

334
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:04,916
But I didn't wanna
unload that on your family. [chuckles]

335
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,916
Look, well, the system…

336
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,166
the system can be hardcore.

337
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,208
I've seen it before.

338
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:17,458
[Ruth] Hmm.

339
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:22,208
But you guys made
a really nice home of it.

340
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,791
- Thank you.
- Beautiful.

341
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:29,125
Thanks for the ride. [clears throat]

342
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:40,750
Ruth. Ruth. Look.

343
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:46,666
It's tricky what you're tryin' to do.
I'm gonna see if I can help you out.

344
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:54,875
Here you go.

345
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,375
Give my office a call.

346
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:01,666
Okay, thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

347
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:26,000
[mom] Call if you think of anything else.

348
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:28,250
Oh, I might pop into Trader Joe's.
Do you want anything?

349
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:32,041
- Mom, the fridge is beyond packed.
- I only have to go in for an hour.

350
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:35,541
- Text, if you need anything.
- [Katherine] I'm good, but thank you.

351
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,458
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

352
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,958
I'm like a bomb being disarmed.

353
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,333
[girl] They'll relax.
Just give them some time.

354
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,250
Thank you.

355
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:49,000
[girl] You know, they heard you up
all night again last night.

356
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,750
Gotta go back on your meds.

357
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,916
I can't play on that stuff.

358
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,375
- But thank you for not telling them.
- Of course.

359
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:01,416
None of us can hear a difference.

360
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,541
Yep, and you're all tone-deaf.

361
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:06,875
But you need sleep.

362
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:09,125
Are you having those nightmares again?

363
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:13,625
[muffled screaming]

364
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,750
[Katherine] <i>Sometimes.</i>

365
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:20,041
[sighs] They're just random flashes, so…

366
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,958
<i>Same as usual.</i>

367
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,125
What else do you remember?

368
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:36,833
[blowing]

369
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,000
[Katherine] <i>There was music.</i>

370
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:49,250
<i>And a woman close to me,
but I can't make out who it is.</i>

371
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,958
<i>I don't know what she was to me.</i>

372
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,500
[girl] Maybe it's somebody in foster care.

373
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:05,375
Yeah.

374
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:07,291
You know,
we could actually look into that.

375
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:09,500
- See if there's anybody--
- I'm not doing that.

376
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,166
Why not?

377
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:13,333
'Cause you guys are my family.

378
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:17,000
Yeah, but, like, aren't you curious?
Don't you wanna know about your past?

379
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,958
No, Em, I don't need proof that
I'm more fucked up than you are.

380
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,500
Well, don't get pissed.

381
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:26,791
[sighs]

382
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,708
Sorry. [chuckles softly]

383
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,416
[electric tool whirring]

384
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,708
[electric tool whirring]

385
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,708
- [Ruth] Hello.
- [man] Come on up.

386
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:09,833
[door closes]

387
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:21,708
Hey. Can I help you?

388
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:24,500
Yeah, I was, uh,
walking by, and I heard you.

389
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:28,541
Just came in to see if you guys
are looking for extra hands or anything.

390
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:31,041
Sorry, we're a NGO,

391
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,375
so we're not really
looking for help right now.

392
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:35,541
Okay.

393
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,750
- [Ruth] What's it gonna be?
- Kitchen for the homeless.

394
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:44,708
Community center. It's donation-based.

395
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:48,291
That's why I had
to let go of most of my guys.

396
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,416
It's probably a good thing you let 'em go.

397
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,125
They should've snapped
a line a couple times

398
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:55,458
before they got
so enthusiastic about framing.

399
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,375
You wanna make sure
that that's true and plumb

400
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,958
or that door's not going to hang right.

401
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,250
You have references?

402
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:07,916
Give me an hour.

403
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:12,250
They're gonna pay me minimum wage.
Well, it's almost minimum wage,

404
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:15,416
but it's a great deal for both of us,
and I get to sharpen my skills.

405
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,166
- Sharpen your skills?
- Yeah.

406
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,750
I'm thinking you look like hell.

407
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:20,583
You told me to get a job. I got two.

408
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,458
- You been usin'?
- What?

409
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:25,125
You seem a little edgy to me. You okay?

410
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:35,000
So this guy knows
you're an offender, right?

411
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,083
He didn't ask.

412
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,875
Why is he willing to trust you?

413
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:41,708
That stud wall you're leaning against,
I built it in 45 minutes.

414
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,333
You better tell your boss who you are.

415
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:49,125
Why? I gotta be a convict wherever I go?

416
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:52,500
No, you're a cop killer
everywhere you go, yes.

417
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:55,916
Sooner you accept it, the better.

418
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,666
[Blake] What do you mean I eat fast?

419
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,416
That's why you're the champ.

420
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,666
Okay. You finish yours before me. [laughs]

421
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,375
[Stan] You can't leave the line

422
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,916
unless you tell the person beside you
where you're goin'.

423
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,125
You gotta waz, take a waz.
Just let somebody know what's happenin'.

424
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:38,208
Here on the floor,
keep your head on a swivel, okay?

425
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:41,375
Everything here is sharp.
Everything can hurt you. Be careful.

426
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:43,333
Welcome to the graveyard shift.

427
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,083
You always wanted
to be in the fish game or…

428
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,375
[Ruth chuckles softly]

429
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:17,625
[laughs]

430
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,791
- [rock music blasting over speakers]
- Oh. Sorry.

431
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,083
[volume decreases]

432
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:30,875
I didn't know that was gonna be so loud.
Sorry, that's, uh…

433
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,375
I know it sounds weird,
but that's actually my band.

434
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,916
That's me on the drums.

435
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:42,666
So I don't know.
We've got our own thing going.

436
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,875
You like it or…

437
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,708
Uh…

438
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:49,708
- Yeah.
- [laughing] You hate it.

439
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:52,708
I don't hate the drums.

440
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:54,708
Yeah.

441
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:07,875
- You live here?
- It's my second job.

442
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,208
Second job?

443
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,416
- Have a good night. Well, day.
- [car door closes]

444
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,541
[Blake] See you in the line.

445
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,916
[piano music playing]

446
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,958
[scream echoing]

447
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:09,000
[Ruth over speaker] <i>Hi, John.</i>
<i>It's Ruth, calling again.</i>

448
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,458
<i>Sorry to keep calling.</i>

449
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:14,208
<i>I just wanna know
if you've heard anything.</i>

450
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:16,041
<i>Um…</i>

451
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,291
<i>Please call me, thanks.</i>

452
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,541
[nail gun firing]

453
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,458
[Ruth sighs]

454
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,791
[siren wailing in distance]

455
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:54,833

[siren stops]

459
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,833
- [Blake] Ruth!
- [clattering]

460
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,541
- [Ruth] Fuck!
- [Blake] Oh shit!

461
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,833
- Fuck!
- [Blake] Shit, I'm sorry.

462
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:44,250
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- What the fuck!

463
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:47,208
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- [Blake] I'm sorry. God!

464
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:48,666
What are you doing?

465
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,083
I called your name.
I… I didn't hear anything. So I just--

466
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:54,875
- You can't do shit like that!
- I was… Donuts. I was gonna--

467
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,708
- You cannot trespass like that.
- Shit. I'm sorry.

468
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:59,875
What do you want? Why are you here?

469
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:03,958
I couldn't sleep,
and I thought about you here working,

470
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:07,791
and I thought
maybe you would want some donuts, so…

471
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:11,916
I'm sorry.

472
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,166
[Ruth] You can't come
into people's places like that.

473
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,166
- You can't do that.
- I know.

474
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,250
[panting]

475
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:22,125
Shit. I also… I brought you this…

476
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:24,833
this coat here. Just…

477
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,666
You know, it's really good,

478
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,541
and I got another that's smaller at home
if this one's too big,

479
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,166
but this one's way better.

480
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,250
I mean, your coat sucks, so I just…

481
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:38,750
I don't know.
Maybe you wanna just try it on.

482
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:42,750
You brought me a jacket? Why?

483
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,666
Uh, well, just so you'd be warm.

484
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,000
Do you wanna try?

485
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:09,500
- I got it. I got it.
- [Blake] Sure.

486
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,666
I'll just clean up this mess here.

487
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:26,291
Hey, that… looks pretty good. That's…

488
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:28,833
That fits. Here, this…

489
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:32,083
[hesitating] Sorry,
it's just that there's a hood here.

490
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:33,791
That's like really…

491
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:37,583
[chuckles softly]

492
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,750
Sorry, you don't have to…

493
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,083
- I'm sorry I scared you.
- No.

494
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:50,375
I'm sorry about the donuts.

495
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,958
Good luck with, uh, you know…

496
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,041
Sorry.

497
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:16,083
[Ruth on voice mail]
<i>John, uh, it's Ruth again.</i>

498
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,041
<i>I didn't give you the whole story.</i>

499
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:28,291
<i>And I'm sure by now you've
worked out all the parts I left out. Uh…</i>

500
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:33,291
<i>Please give me a chance to explain.</i>

501
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:38,416
<i>You know, for 20 years,
I wrote thousands of letters.</i>

502
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,583
<i>I did everything I could to reach her
the way that the system wanted me to,</i>

503
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,833
<i>but I… I didn't hear anything.</i>

504
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:49,291
<i>I don't wanna disrupt her life,</i>

505
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,333
<i>and I'm not looking
for a second chance. I just…</i>

506
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:57,541
<i>You know, man,
I just… I just wanna know that she's okay.</i>

507
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:02,875
<i>If I had told you the full truth,
you wouldn't have offered to help me,</i>

508
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:07,208
<i>and I know that's not an excuse,
but I really need your help.</i>

509
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:12,291
<i>If I could just…
maybe just talk to the parents.</i>

510
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,625
[Ruth sighs]

511
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:17,791
<i>Please, John, she's my sister.</i>

512
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:21,583
<i>Thanks. Bye.</i>

513
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,250
Yeah, okay.

514
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,708
- [Liz] Morning, Tyler.
- Morning.

515
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:33,833
[Tyler sighs]
Working mostly upstairs today?

516
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:34,750
Yeah.

517
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:39,125
Did you know the family
that lived here before the Balabans?

518
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:42,333
Westovers. Nice folks.
Put in the mantelpiece.

519
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:44,666
They have a daughter named Ruth?

520
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:49,083
No. That'd be the Slaters.

521
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:52,625
It was way back.
Didn't they tell you about that?

522
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:54,875
Mmm-mmm.

523
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,541
Oh jeez.

524
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:01,958
Ruth's dad killed himself.

525
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,625
She was living in the house alone
with her little sister.

526
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,041
Sheriff came to evict.

527
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:12,541
She killed him.

528
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:23,125
{\an8}-[indistinct chatter]
- [upbeat music playing over speakers]

529
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,291
How does that look? Does it look goofy?

530
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,916
- Officer, you gonna arrest me?
- [scoffing] Yeah, for being a prick.

531
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:55,541
Did your brother pass along
that information I gave him?

532
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,541
[Steve] What information?

533
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:59,625
I got two work addresses.

534
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:03,666
One's near a fucking armpit,
South King Street, Sixth Ave South,

535
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,583
near Hing Hay Park, Chinatown.

536
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:08,458
She's there every day. All by herself.

537
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,666
[Keith] You coming back in?
They're making speeches.

538
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,416
He was Dad's friend.
You could act like you care.

539
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,750
What the fuck are you doing?

540
00:44:23,416 --> 00:44:26,958
What you should be doing.
Everybody's trying to have a good time--

541
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:29,041
Pressing the cops about Ruth Slater.

542
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,458
- Are you fucking crazy?
- They're not gonna care what we do.

543
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:32,625
There's no "we."

544
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:36,875
You're not gonna do anything anyway.
You just talk like always.

545
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:38,791
You're the one who doesn't do anything.

546
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:43,250
You don't remember what it was like
when we lost the house. That's her fault.

547
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:45,333
We lost it 'cause
Mom couldn't stop drinking.

548
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,208
And why do you think that is?

549
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,958
You don't remember him. I do.

550
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:54,166
But sure, carry on with your nice life,
like it just didn't happen.

551
00:44:58,458 --> 00:44:59,958
I'm not saying that it didn't happen.

552
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,166
She walks around free.

553
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,875
She's got a job and a guy.

554
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,250
She lives like it never happened.

555
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:16,666
Now, you tell me if that's fair.

556
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,541
Hey. What you guys doin'?

557
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:23,541
We have a sitter for once.
Can't we just have fun?

558
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,750
Thought big brother had that handled.

559
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,916
You're an asshole.

560
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,541
Just think about it.

561
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:59,958
[John] And you got air.
You had perfect control of that thing.

562
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:04,083
[Ryan] Bro, I totally dusted you on
the quad. You just can't say it. [laughs]

563
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:06,916
No, no, he's right. He did perfect.

564
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,625
- [John laughing]
- [door closes]

565
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:11,541
Hey, babe.

566
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,500
How could you not have told me?

567
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:17,083
- [footsteps approaching]
- Mom, I did the quad at, like, full speed.

568
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:23,666
Look.

569
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:27,375
Once I found out,
I wasn't just gonna take her case.

570
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:30,541
- She was in my house with our children.
- Yeah.

571
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:35,000
And you're right, I should've told you
when I found out, and I'm sorry.

572
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,833
When a murderer talks her way
into my kitchen to relive the moment,

573
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:39,666
yeah, you should've told me. Shit, John.

574
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:41,833
Wait a minute.

575
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,750
What do you mean,
"you wasn't gonna take the case?"

576
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,166
She came by the office today.

577
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,500
No, no, no.

578
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:52,041
Liz, she wasn't reliving something.
That was trauma.

579
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:54,291
She wasn't shot at
in some Kuwaiti firefight.

580
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:56,416
She killed somebody in cold blood.

581
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:01,250
[John] The woman has been in the system.
You know, that can be more harm than--

582
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:02,791
If that were any of your Black sons

583
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:04,583
who had been
in the system in this situation,

584
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:05,666
they would be dead.

585
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:13,000
I'm just saying that she did her time,
and she has every right--

586
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,375
I'm not talking about her rights.
I'm talking about her lying.

587
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:20,416
If she tells the truth, she's denied
her rights, you know that as well as me--

588
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,583
- That is not the reality for that woman.
- That's a reality.

589
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:24,000
She would not be denied her rights

590
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:27,708
because she could easily find
a bleeding heart attorney in you.

591
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:31,458
I can't tell you
what to do professionally,

592
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:33,416
but you keep her shit away from here.

593
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,958

[tires squeal]

595
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:42,333
[man] Stay clear.

596
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:45,625
Whoa! Right there.

597
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,625
[uneasy music playing]

598
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,333
[Ruth] Why are you guys always late?

599
00:48:55,416 --> 00:48:57,250
[man 2] We showed up. I don't know, lady.

600
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,500
[Ruth] How about a heads-up next time?

601
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:25,416
[man 2] Our apologies, ma'am.
Will you sign this form?

602
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,791
Since you're making me late,
you can give me a hand.

603
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,625
Thank you.

604
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:02,416
[Steve] So what's this place gonna be?

605
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,875
A community center for the homeless.

606
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:24,250
[whispering] What else? What else? Okay.

607
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:32,000
[Steve] It's some
really nice work in here.

608
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:35,625
Well, your parents must be proud.

609
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,291
[Ruth] Uh…

610
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:39,583
I don't know. They're dead.

611
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:42,916
Um, listen, I gotta run.
Thanks for the help.

612
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:47,541
That's rough. Your parents dying.

613
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,083
Yeah, but life goes on, right?

614
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:51,708
[bus departing]

615
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:04,583
Look, I really appreciate the help,
but I need to get going.

616
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:08,791
[chuckles]

617
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:10,833
Yeah. Sorry, I don't wanna hold you up.

618
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:14,750
Nice to meet you.

619

00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:37,000
Shit.

[car horn honking]

627
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,625
- One minute to spare.
- [Ruth] Did I make it or not?

628
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:11,041

- It's none of my business?
- No.

- It's my right.

She's probably scared of you.

You were right.

It's not fair.

- You serious right now?
- Not your bullshit plan.

665
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:21,041
She's still got a sister out there.

666

[Blake] When you think about,

had a lot more love, right?

No, it's just, like, a lot more focus.
It's not wild, you know.

Man, Patty, she… she always
looks like she's scowling.

She always got that look on her face,

Anyway, those are her nephews.
They're… they're really cool.

They're, like, a Seattle institution.

Their grandpa was
the first Asian-American Seattle cop.

Yeah, he's kind of like a hero cop.

remember, no crack today.

785
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,708
[dad] See ya.

786
01:07:38,791 --> 01:07:40,416
- [Rachel] Have a good day.
- [Emily] Bye.

787
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:32,583
[Rachel] Have fun. You got this.

788
01:08:32,666 --> 01:08:34,083
[Katherine] You don't need
to walk me inside.

789
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:35,000
[dad] Okay.

790
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:36,375
[Rachel] Love you.

791
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,041
[echoing laughter]

792
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:29,083
[scream echoing]

793
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,916
[John] They don't have to be here.
Remember that.

794
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:46,041
But they're looking
for any reason to say no.

795
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,041
Hello.

796
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,250
Ruth, this Michael and Rachel.

797
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:59,083
Now, they've asked me to conceal
their last names for this proceeding.

798
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:03,500
Let's have a seat.

799
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:07,791
[Michael clears throat]

800
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:12,833
[John] All right.

801
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:21,333
So, first thing, I'd like to
thank the two of you for coming.

802
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,250
I think it's best that
we all just stay open.

803
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,625
There's a lot of complicated feelings,

804
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:29,583
and I'm here
to help wade through that with you.

805
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:34,583
- Okay.
- Okay. Um…

806
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:40,375
Well, first of all, the no-contact order
was the judge's decision.

807
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:42,791
Not ours.

808
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,291
Katherine… [hesitates]

809
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:50,750
Katherine has no conscious memory
of her life before us.

810
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:53,125
She was traumatized.

811
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,708
Now she's doing well.

812
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:01,625
Of course she struggles sometimes,
like everyone, but…

813
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:05,375
She has opportunities
she never would've had.

814
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:06,875
[Rachel] She's very talented.

815
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:08,541
[Michael] She has a good life.

816
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:11,083
A loving family, stability.

817
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:12,958
[high-pitched squeal]

818
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:15,875
Who would it possibly benefit
to disrupt that?

819
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:19,541
We don't know anything about Miss Slater

820
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:21,291
except that she's been
in prison for murder,

821
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:26,000
and I understand
she's trying to rebuild her life, but…

822
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:29,791
What would Katherine gain
by meeting her now?

823
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:36,375
- Can I speak?
- Yes.

824
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,416
Katie…

825
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:42,750
Katherine…

826
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:48,791
My mom died having her,
so I raised her from a baby.

827
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,208
Dad didn't do anything before he…

828
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,125
before he gave up. He quit.

829
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:02,291
I didn't. I don't quit. Not on Katie.

830
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:07,583
But life doesn't start at five.

831
01:12:09,666 --> 01:12:11,041
Those are big years.

832
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:15,791
Do you have kids of your own?

833
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:24,958
Whatever her life was like before,
and I'm sure there were good moments,

834
01:12:26,166 --> 01:12:28,166
they were obliterated by what you did.

835
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:30,208
Does she really not remember me?

836
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:31,916
- She doesn't.
- [Ruth] I don't believe that.

837
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,833
I don't believe
that she doesn't remember me.

838
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:35,791
Does she know about the no-contact order?

839
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:38,041
- Ruth, calm yourself down.
- Does she?

840
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:41,000
[Michael hesitates]
You know what's striking to me?

841
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,875
Is that we're here
because of what you want.

842
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:45,666
Not what's best for our daughter.

843
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,583
[John] I think maybe you should

844
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:51,250
move on to something else.

845
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:54,541
Do you have any other questions?

846
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:57,000
Is she sleeping?

847
01:13:00,291 --> 01:13:01,750
She never slept as a kid.

848
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:05,791
She sleeps fine. You know, I…

849
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:08,708
I don't think
there's anything more to talk about.

850
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:10,541
- Don't… Just…
- [Michael] Rachel? Let's go.

851
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:12,583
I wrote and sent letters
to Social Services.

852
01:13:12,666 --> 01:13:16,000
Did you get any of my letters?
Did Katie read any of my letters?

853
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:18,541
Everything we did,
we did in her best interest.

854
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:21,333
- What did you fucking do to my letters?
- Ruth, calm down.

855
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:24,375
What did you do to my letters?

856
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:28,166
Did you throw them away?
Did you burn them?

857
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:30,625
Look at me when I'm talking to you, bitch!

858
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:33,208
- Okay, that's it. Come on, Rachel.
- [John] Ruth!

859
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:35,458
You burned my fucking letters
like I don't exist?

860
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:37,666
- You asked us to come. We came.
- [Ruth] What the fuck?

861
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,791
- If you had any respect--
- Respect?

862
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:43,000
Talk about respect.
I spent 20 years in a fucking cell

863
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:46,291
the size of your walk-in closet,
waiting for one shred of information!

864
01:13:46,375 --> 01:13:47,791
[Michael] You were
in that cell for a reason!

865
01:13:47,875 --> 01:13:50,291
What gives you the reason
to treat me like I don't exist?

866
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:52,000
- [Michael] You keep her away from us!
- I exist!

867
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:54,916
Or I'll press charges.
You'll go back today!

868
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,291
- I exist!
- Listen to him, he's right!

869
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:58,291
[panting]

870
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:01,375
I didn't burn your letters.

871
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:03,166
Then tell her about me!

872
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:07,291
Rachel?

873
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:17,208
[John] I think that's as far
as I can take it, Ruth.

874
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,375
[melancholy music playing]

875
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:31,250
Fuck!

876
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:33,166
[yells]

877
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:34,791
Fuck!

878
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:39,125
[yells]

879
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,958
[birds squawking]

880
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:10,625
[Blake] Hey, Ruth.
Could you just wait one second?

881
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:13,958
I have one thing to tell you,
and then I'm gonna leave you alone, okay?

882
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:15,750
- I'm good. I'm good!
- [Blake] You're not good.

883
01:16:15,833 --> 01:16:17,333
- I'm good! Okay?
- Okay.

884
01:16:17,416 --> 01:16:19,166
- Look, I'm a convict.
- I'm good.

885
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:21,083
I'm a convict.

886
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:25,250
I got out of Clallam
a year and a half ago.

887
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,083
I'm sorry, Ruth. You just… It hit me.

888
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:33,041
You said what you said, and I just froze,

889
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:36,583
and I fucking sat there like an asshole,
and I hate myself for it. But…

890
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:37,875
[hesitates]

891
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,375
You're on active, right?

892
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:45,416
Yeah, no known felons.

893
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:49,166
[laughs]

894
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:52,750
I mean, shit, we're in violation
just standing here, right?

895
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:56,833
Ruth, I had to talk to somebody.

896
01:16:58,125 --> 01:16:59,625
I guess word got out.

897
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:06,458
I… I'm sorry, Ruth.

898
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,458
I'm sorry for everything.

899
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:30,291
[cell phone buzzing]

900
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:34,041
Hello.

901
01:17:35,708 --> 01:17:36,750
Hello?

902
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:43,625
- What do you want from me?
- [Emily] <i>I'm sorry.</i>

903
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:46,250
<i>I'm…</i>

904
01:17:49,416 --> 01:17:50,625
<i>I'm calling because…</i>

905
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:53,333
<i>I read your letters.</i>

906
01:17:57,458 --> 01:18:00,666
- It's you?
<i>- No, it's not Katherine.</i>

907
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,416
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

908
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,875
<i>Can I meet you somewhere?</i>

909
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,041
<i>Anywhere you want.</i>

910
01:18:25,666 --> 01:18:28,458
[voice mail] <i>This is Keith.</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

911
01:18:28,541 --> 01:18:30,333
<i>Maybe I'll get back to you.</i>

912
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:31,416
[line beeps]

913
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:35,500
Where the fuck are you?
You were meant to take over an hour ago.

914
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:38,541
Call me.

915
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:41,458
[engine starts]

916
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:50,875
[indistinct chattering]

917
01:19:00,666 --> 01:19:01,541
[girl] Molly!

918
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:03,333
Hi.

919
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:06,250
[conversation continues indistinctly]

920
01:19:22,916 --> 01:19:25,000
[Ruth] Excuse me. Excuse me.

921
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:28,916
[child] Thank you.

922
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:54,333
Skipping school?

923
01:19:58,875 --> 01:19:59,875
[Emily] Yeah.

924
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:05,250
Skip school a lot?

925
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:08,208
Uh-huh.

926
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:14,916
We all do things we probably shouldn't,
but we get back on track, right?

927
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:17,166
Yeah.

928
01:20:19,958 --> 01:20:21,916
Wish I'd gone to school more.

929
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:25,541
Really liked it.

930
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:35,041
My baby sister
was a lot younger than I was,

931
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:38,750
so I stayed home,
and I played school with her.

932
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:44,625
I was teaching her how to tie her shoes,
but her hands were just so tiny.

933
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:52,791
What was… what was your sister like?

934
01:20:58,625 --> 01:21:03,583
We lived on a farm, and we had this horse,
and she named him "Cheese."

935
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:06,333
[chuckles] 'Cause that
was her favorite food.

936
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:07,875
[chuckles]

937
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:10,958
She was funny.

938
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:17,000
I wonder all the time what she looks like…

939
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,333
what she became.

940
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:27,375
She plays the piano.

941
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:31,916
She's really good at it too.

942
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:41,416
Katherine doesn't know about you.

943
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:45,458
She has memories.

944
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:49,000
What kinda memories?

945
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:57,333
Mmm… Think I should go.
Nobody knows that I'm here.

946
01:21:57,416 --> 01:21:59,583
Okay. It's all right.

947
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,583
Thank you for talking to me.

948
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:04,208
Um…

949
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:08,583
She has a rehearsal this afternoon.

950
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:12,750
Cornish Auditorium at 4:00 p.m.

951
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:15,333
You can watch her play.

[uneasy music playing]

953
01:22:40,958 --> 01:22:45,416
[Ruth] Hey, John.
I have a chance to see Katie.

954
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:49,125
And I really don't wanna screw this up,
so I need you to…

955
01:22:49,791 --> 01:22:52,000
I just need you
to call me back today, okay?

956
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:55,458
Okay. Thanks. It's Ruth. Thanks.

[crying continues]

959
01:23:37,416 --> 01:23:38,750
[Steve] Where's your mama?

960
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:42,083
Huh?

961
01:23:43,666 --> 01:23:44,958
Where's your mom?

962
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:50,708
- Oh! Shit! Steve.
- [woman] Steve?

963
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:51,875
[Keith] Oh shit.

964
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:54,375
[Keith] Look, Steve.

965
01:23:54,916 --> 01:23:57,833
[woman] I'm sorry, Steve.
I'm sorry. Please.

966
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,875
[Keith] Steve. Look, I just…

967
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:01,583
- [Steve] Motherfucker!

[Steve] Fuck you!

01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,375
[Keith] I'm sorry.

973
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,458
[sobbing] I screwed up, Steve.

974
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:34,958
Steve! Please!
Please don't go, please! Steve, please!

978
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:16,750
{\an8}-Uh, I'm here for John Ingram, please.
- [receptionist] Okay.

979
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:20,166
{\an8}Hi, is Mr. Ingram available?

980
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:22,750
{\an8}Okay, thank you.

981
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:24,833
{\an8}I'm sorry, ma'am.
Mr. Ingram is away this week.

982
01:25:24,916 --> 01:25:27,291
- I can give him a message.
- You can't just…

983
01:25:27,375 --> 01:25:29,833
[receptionist] I'm afraid
I just don't have him right now.

984
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:32,041
[panting]

985
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:47,333
[Ruth] Hey. Hey, is your dad here?

986
01:25:47,958 --> 01:25:50,125
Uh, no. He's away.

987
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,958
- Is your mom here?
- [boy] Yeah.

988
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:53,791
I need to talk to her. Can you go get her?

989
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:56,083
- Go get her. Go get her, please.
- Mom!

990
01:25:56,166 --> 01:25:58,250
I… Yeah. Sure.

991
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:06,708
Mom? Somebody's here for Dad.

992
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:10,041
Mom!

993
01:26:28,166 --> 01:26:29,625
- [man] Get down!
- [Corey] Ruth!

994
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:32,083
[screaming]

995
01:26:32,166 --> 01:26:34,291
I'm getting the keys!
I'm getting the keys!

[door opens]

997
01:26:43,625 --> 01:26:47,125
Oh, no, no, no.
Get the fuck off my property.

998
01:26:47,208 --> 01:26:49,666
Get in the house now.
You got a lot of nerve coming here.

999
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:51,750
- I need to talk to John right away.
- [Liz] How dare you?

1000
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:53,250
[Ruth] I'll leave. Tell me where he is.

1001
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:55,375
This is not our problem.
You're not his client.

1002
01:26:55,458 --> 01:26:56,791
I have a chance to see my sister,

1003
01:26:56,875 --> 01:26:58,875
and I just need to know,
can I go by myself?

1004
01:26:58,958 --> 01:27:01,333
- Do I have to take him with me?
- I don't give a shit.

1005
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:03,958
She was taken away from you
because of your choices.

1006
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:07,375
Look, please don't talk to me
about choices right now, okay?

1007
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:10,500
Listen, no one forced you to kill that man
or lie your way into my house.

1008
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:12,750
Okay, you know what?
I'm sorry for the lies.

1009
01:27:12,833 --> 01:27:15,208
I'm sorry for everything
that happened here.

1010
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:18,708
I went to prison for half my life,
so I think I've more than paid for it.

1011
01:27:18,791 --> 01:27:22,208
You were sent to prison!
You have to take responsibility for that.

1012
01:27:22,291 --> 01:27:24,708
Oh my God. I said I did it.
Can you tell me where John is?

1013
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:27,416
[Liz] John would tell you exactly
what I'm telling you right now.

1014
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,833
You lost your opportunity. Lost it!

1015
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:33,125
John looks at you. He sees someone
who deserves a second chance.

1016
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:34,625
I don't see that.

1017
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:37,166
I hear someone
who'd say anything to get what she wants.

1018
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:39,291
You would do exactly
the same thing for your kids.

1019
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:40,375
[Liz] No. Don't go there.

1020
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:42,458
Don't even pretend this is about her.

1021
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:43,833
Exactly! I was protecting her!

1022
01:27:43,916 --> 01:27:46,166
- You are not a victim!
- I said I did it!

1023
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,416
All right? That's bullshit!

1024
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:50,375
- I had to make a choice!
- Face it, you traumatized her.

1025
01:27:50,458 --> 01:27:53,583
- Do not even pretend this is about her!
- I fucking said I did it!

1026
01:27:53,666 --> 01:27:56,166
She was only five years old!

1027
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:59,708
She was only five years old!

1028
01:28:03,541 --> 01:28:04,666
[sobs] She was…

1029
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:12,041
[exhales shakily] Oh fuck.

1030
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:17,125
What happened, Ruth?

1031
01:28:18,541 --> 01:28:20,666
[Mac] <i>I just want you</i>
<i>to consider your little sister.</i>

1032
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:22,208
[Ruth] I've got a gun in this house,

1033
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:25,125
and I swear to God,
they come in this house, I'm gonna use it.

1034
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:28,000
Get… Where are you going?

1035
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:31,041
How many times do I gotta tell you?

1036
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:33,833
You come to that door,
and I swear to fucking God…

1037
01:28:33,916 --> 01:28:37,541
We are not leaving! We are not leaving!

1038
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:42,375
Corey, get off my fucking porch!

1039
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:44,083
Go ahead, try it.

1040
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:46,541
- Go ahead and try it, Corey. Try…
- Ruth!

[gasping] Katie? Hey, Katie?
Katie? Katie? Katie?

1043
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:02,416
No!

1044
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:06,208
Katie, Katie, Katie.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1045
01:29:20,916 --> 01:29:22,125
It was my fault.

1046
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:25,291
I did it. [sniffles]

1047
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:44,666
[softly] Shit.

1048
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:51,166
What time is your meeting?

1049
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:53,916
[Ruth] It's at 4:00.
I'm not gonna make it.

1050
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:29,791
I'm hungry.

1051
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:33,708
I know. Food's coming. It's coming.

1052

[waitress] Okay, here you go, sweetie.
The full stack.

1053

Eat as much as you want.
As much as you can.

1054
01:31:01,208 --> 01:31:04,416
Katie, I'm so sorry I made you do that.

1055
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:09,375
Do what?

I'm gonna go somewhere, okay?

And I want you to stay here
and eat all you can, okay?

Hey.

[Katherine] Hmm.

Katie, look at me. Look at me.

I'm always gonna love you.
No matter what, okay?

- I love you too.
- I know you do.

Eat up.

Yeah. She's not here.
But I have the address where she is,

[Ruth] You're making a mistake.

1121
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:35,500
Let her go. She's innocent.

You do not talk about him!

<i>He said you boys would give up your room
so we had a place to go.</i>

Shut the fuck up.

He was kind.

And I am so sorry
I took him away from you.

make you feel better?

01:39:30,416 --> 01:39:31,833
But life doesn't go on.

Shut up. Shut up.
