00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,960
It's another hot, sunny day today here
in Southern California.

3
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,157
Temperature is 84
for downtown Los Angeles,

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,754
overnight lows of 75.

5
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,999
I think about that day

6
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,710
I left him at a Greyhound station
west of Santa Fe

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,430
We were 17, but he was sweet
and it was true

8
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,110
Still, I knew what I had to do

9
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,396
'Cause I just knew

10
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,153
Summer Sunday nights

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,029
We'd sink into our seats
right as they dimmed out all the lights

12
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,591
A technicolor world
made out of music and machine

13
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,469
It called me to be on that screen

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,677
And live inside each scene

15
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,436
Without a nickel to my name,
hopped a bus, here I came

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,434
Could be brave or just insane,
we'll have to see

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,159
'Cause maybe in that sleepy town

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,993
He'll sit one day, the lights are down

19
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,040
He'll see my face and think
how he used to know me

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,477
Climb these hills,
I'm reaching for the heights

21
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,594
And chasing all the lights that shine

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,469
And when they let you down,
it's another day of

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,997
You get up off the ground,
it's another day of

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,640
'Cause morning rolls around

25
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,952
And it's another day of sun

26
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,598
I hear 'em every day

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,435
The rhythms in the canyons
that'll never fade away

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,230
The ballads in the barrooms
left by those who came before

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,597
They say "You gotta want it more"

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,956
So I bang on every door

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,759
And even when the answer's "no"

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,752
Or when my money's running low

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,470
The dusty mic and neon glow are all I need

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,512
And someday as I sing my song

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,478
A small-town kid'll come along

36
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,995
That'll be the thing to push him on

37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,514
And go, go

38
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,991
Climb these hills,
I'm reaching for the heights

39
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,756
And chasing all the lights that shine

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,151
And when they let you down,
it's another day of

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,954
You get up off the ground,
yes it's another day of

42
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,076
'Cause morning rolls around

43
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,232
And it's another day of sun

44
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,753
When they've let you down

45
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,434
And morning rolls around

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,352
It's another day of sun

47
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,511
It's another day of sun

48
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,676
It's another day of sun,
sun, sun, sun, sun, sun

49
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,400
It's another day of sun

50
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,835
Just another day of sun

51
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,551
It's another day of sun

52
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,997
Another day has just begun

53
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,438
And it's another day of sun

54
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,591
It's another day of sun.

55
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,797
...already has won three Oscars,

56
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,193
including for the 1998 film
Shakespeare in Love...

57
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,793
I mean, we could not
believe what was happening.

58
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,635
And I swear to God, she was wrecked.

59
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,996
She was completely wrecked!

60
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,678
I know. I know, it was pure insanity.

61
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,956
It's insanity...

62
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,394
Ah!

63
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,757
"Lunacy! It was pure lunacy."

64
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,638
What is his prob... I should go.

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,400
Cappuccino, please.

66
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,472
- Right. Of course.
- On us.

67
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,353
Oh, no, thank you. I insist.

68
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,394
Did you see who that was?

69
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,189
Shit!

70
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,519
- Mia, where do you think you're going?
- Oh, it's five after.

71
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,671
- You better be here early tomorrow.
- Okay.

72
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,634
Have a good night!

73
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,756
Oh!

74
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,152
She was wrecked!
It was pure lunacy, it was...

75
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,632
It was so crazy, and I just...
Oh, you would have died.

76
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,231
No, Turner's fine.
Turner's fine. I just, um...

77
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,438
Are you gonna wait 'til Denver
to tell her, or...?

78
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,030
What?

79
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,909
Okay.

80
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,354
No, I'm happy for you.

81
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,873
I am. I'm happy for you, I just...

82
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,033
I just thought...

83
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,470
I don't know what I thought,

84
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,279
- I guess I thought...
- One second.

85
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,880
- What, Ruby?
- Jessica's on the phone.

86
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,556
- Um, tell her I'll call her back.
- In two minutes?

87
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,797
- Less than two minutes.
- I'll go get your lunch.

88
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,553
I'm almost done. Thank you.

89
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,316
Oh, you know what? I think we're good.
Thanks for coming in.

90
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,075
Whoa! Holy shit! You wanna open a window?

91
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,039
- I was trying to give you an entrance.
- Thank you.

92
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,998
Mia! How'd the audition go?

93
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,116
Eh.

94
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,590
Eh, same here. Was Jen there or Rachel?

95
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,149
- I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.
- They're the worst.

96
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,358
- Well, I don't know if they were there.
- I bet that they were.

97
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,000
Why is there a convention in the bathroom?

98
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,279
Two minutes, people.
Mia, you're coming, right?

99
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,591
I can't! I'm working.

100
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,400
What?

101
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,071
Did she just say "working"?

102
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,158
- What?
- I'm sorry it didn't go well today,

103
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,391
and there's like four things in my inbox
that you're perfect for,

104
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,393
and I will submit you.
But right now you're coming!

105
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,755
It'll be fun.

106
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,593
- It's not gonna be fun.
- It could be.

107
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,110
It's not. It's gonna be
a bunch of social climbers

108
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,715
all packed into one of those
big glass houses.

109
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,120
This looks familiar.

110
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,715
- I was gonna give that back.
- How long have you had this?

111
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,757
- A long time.
- Come on, Mia.

112
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,069
When else are you gonna get to see

113
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,152
every Hollywood cliché crammed
into the same room?

114
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,754
We'll make fun of it together!

115
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,992
I'm disappointed in you, Lex.
There's nothing to make fun of.

116
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,869
This party's gonna be like
humanity at its finest.

117
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,758
You've got the invitation

118
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,672
You've got the right address

119
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,274
You need some medication?

120
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,238
The answer's always "yes"

121
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,118
A little chance encounter

122
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,398
Could be the one you've waited for

123
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,075
Just squeeze a bit more

124
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,437
Tonight we're on a mission,
tonight's the casting call

125
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,398
If this is the real audition

126
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,278
Oh, God help us all!

127
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,238
You make the right impression

128
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,677
Then everybody knows your name

129
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,638
You're in the fast lane!

130
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,236
Someone in the crowd
could be the one you need to know

131
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,036
The one to finally lift you off the ground

132
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,830
Someone in the crowd
could take you where you wanna go

133
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,674
If you're the someone ready to be found

134
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,195
The someone ready to be

135
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,671
Do what you need to do
'til they discover you

136
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,436
And make you more
than who you're seeing now

137
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,273
So with the stars aligned

138
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,317
I think I'll stay behind

139
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,393
You've got to go and find

140
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,913
That someone in the crowd

141
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,030
Hey, girl!

142
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,271
That someone in the crowd

143
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,236
Is someone in the crowd

144
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,552
The only thing you really see?

145
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,630
Watching while the world
keeps spinning 'round

146
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,600
Somewhere there's a place

147
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,431
Where I find who I'm gonna be

148
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,599
A somewhere that's just
waiting to be found

149
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,637
Someone in the crowd
could be the one you need to know

150
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,509
The someone who can lift you
off the ground

151
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,310
Someone in the crowd could take you where
you wanna go

152
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,153
Someone in the crowd could make you

153
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,277
Someone in the crowd will take you

154
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,875
Flying off the ground
if you're the someone

155
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,556
Ready to be

156
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,438
Found.

157
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,074
No, no.

158
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,675
Oh, come on! What?

159
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,314
Ahh!

160
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,558
Please stop sneaking into my home.

161
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,313
You think Mom or Dad
would call this a home?

162
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,675
What are you doing?

163
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,433
Please don't do that.
Please don't sit on that.

164
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,556
Are you kidding?

165
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,835
Please don't sit on that.
Don't sit on that.

166
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,320
Don't sit on that.
Hoagy Carmichael sat on that!

167
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,710
- Oh, my God!
- "The Baked Potato" just threw it away.

168
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,395
- I can't imagine why.
- And now you're just sitting on it.

169
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,597
- I got you a throw rug.
- I don't need that.

170
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,479
What if I said Miles Davis pissed on it?

171
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,632
It's almost insulting. Is it true?

172
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,360
When are you gonna unpack these boxes?

173
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,113
When I unpack them in my own club.

174
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,716
Oh, Sebastian! It's like a girl broke up
with you and you're stalking her.

175
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,393
You're not still going by there, are you?

176
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,237
That's...

177
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,511
You won't believe it.
They turned it into a samba-tapas place.

178
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,638
- Oh, my God, Sebastian!
- Samba. Tapas.

179
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,755
Pick one, you know? Do one right.

180
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,390
- I have someone I want you to meet.
- I don't wanna meet anyone.

181
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,790
No, no, I don't wanna meet anyone.

182
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,270
- Dad gave you this? You'll like her.
- Yes.

183
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,716
I don't think I'm gonna like her.
Does she like jazz?

184
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,712
- Probably not.
- Then what are we gonna talk about?

185
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,672
I don't know! It doesn't matter, okay?

186
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,838
Because you're living like a hermit.
You're driving without insurance!

187
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,240
- "It doesn't matter"?
- Yeah, it doesn't matter.

188
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,800
- Okay. Well then,
- You need to get serious.

189
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,360
I know a guy with a face tattoo
that you should see.

190
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,510
- Okay, low blow.
- Heart of gold.

191
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,871
- Get serious!
- "Get serious"?

192
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,159
Laura... I had a very serious plan
for my future.

193
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,391
- I know.
- It's not my fault I got shanghaied.

194
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,632
You didn't get shanghaied.
You got ripped off!

195
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,870
What's the difference?

196
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,192
I don't know.
It's not as romantic as that.

197
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,350
Don't sit...

198
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,120
Everybody knew that guy
was shady except for you.

199
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,596
Why do you say "romantic"
like it's a dirty word?

200
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,515
Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.

201
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,875
I'm not gonna call her.

202
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,280
And the thing is...

203
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,556
you're acting like life's got me
on the ropes.

204
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,280
I want to be on the ropes. Okay?

205
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,919
I'm letting life hit me
'til it gets tired.

206
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,310
- Oh?
- Then I'm gonna hit back.

207
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,153
It's a classic rope-a-dope.

208
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,478
Okay, Ali. I love you. Unpack your boxes.

209
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,120
- I'm gonna change the locks.
- You can't afford it.

210
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,194
I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes.

211
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,750
Hey.

212
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,309
- Bill. Thanks for having me back.
- You're welcome.

213
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,993
I want you to know you're lookin'
at a new man,

214
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,197
- a man that's happy to be here.
- Good. Excellent.

215
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,352
- Very-easy-to-work-with man.
- And you're going to play the set list?

216
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,840
Happy to.

217
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,640
Even though I don't think anyone cares
what I play, but, yeah.

218
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,276
Well, if by "anyone" you mean anyone
other than me, that would be correct.

219
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,238
I care, and I don't wanna hear
the free jazz.

220
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,437
Right. Okay.

221
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,113
Although I thought in this town

222
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,272
it worked on a sort of
"one for you, one for me" type system.

223
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,917
How 'bout two for you, one for me?

224
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,639
How 'bout all for you and none for me?

225
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,120
- That's perfect, yes.
- Great.

226
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,759
- Okay.
- Mutual decision, then.

227
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,320
Right. Made by me.

228
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,596
Right. And I sign off on it, so...

229
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,434
Whatever. Tell yourself
what you wanna know.

230
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,637
Well. Welcome back.

231
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,872
There's a nice way to say that, Karen.

232
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,320
Seb.

233
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,115
I hear what you're saying,

234
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,879
but I don't think you're saying
what you mean.

235
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,872
Yeah, I don't think you hear
what I'm saying. You're fired.

236
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,156
Well, that's what you're saying,
but it's not what you mean.

237
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,471
- What you mean is...
- You're fired.

238
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,792
- "Play the set list."
- No, I'm saying it's too late.

239
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,475
- It's a warning.
- What planet are you from?

240
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,519
- Don't fire me, Bill. Don't fire me.
- You're done. I'm sorry, Seb.

241
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,875
It's Christmas.

242
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,078
Yeah, I see the decorations.
Good luck in the new year.

243
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,589
I just heard you play, and I wanted to...

244
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,670
I don't like the fissure on the GT scan.
Did you test for achromatopsia?

245
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,356
DOA on 23rd. Perp laughin'
his face off at the PD.

246
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,840
Damn Miranda rights.

247
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,957
This is my classroom.

248
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,918
You don't like it, the door's to my left.

249
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,992
Lady, why you be trippin' like that?

250
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,472
No, Jamal. You be trippin'.

251
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,994
Over here!

252
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,439
We're talking away

253
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,831
I don't know what I'm to say,
I'll say it anyway...

254
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,474
Oh, Mia!

255
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,597
- Hi.
- Hi.

256
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,399
- I want you to meet my friend, Carlo.
- Hi.

257
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,596
- Hi. Carlo.
- Carlo, this is Mia.

258
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,751
- Mia? Hi. How are you?
- Yes, Mia.

259
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,399
Carlo is a writer.

260
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,358
Yeah. They say I have a knack
for world-building.

261
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,715
I got a lot of heat right now.

262
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,156
There's been a lot of buzz, people talkin'
about me, which is exciting.

263
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,072
I mean, you work so hard,
and then all that validation.

264
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,833
- I'm gonna grab a drink.
- Okay.

265
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,798
Yeah, it's really nice to meet you.

266
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,238
I'll be gone

267
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,434
In a day or two

268
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,878
So needless to say

269
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,474
I'm odds and ends

270
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,394
But I'll be stumbling away

271
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,716
Slowly learning that life is okay

272
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,598
Sorry.

273
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,911
Say after me

274
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,071
It's no better to be safe than sorry

275
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,792
Take on me

276
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,920
Take me on

277
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,480
Take on me

278
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,793
I'll be gone

279
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,794
In a day or two

280
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,638
Thank you. Any other requests?

281
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,839
Girl in the front!

282
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,115
"I Ran."

283
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,511
"I Ran." A fantastic suggestion.

284
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,512
All right, piano man,
tickle those ivories.

285
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,000
Let's hit it.

286
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,833
One! Two! Three! Four!

287
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,799
That's right.

288
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,914
I walk along the avenue

289
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,756
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you

290
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,991
Meet a girl like you

291
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,400
Me?

292
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,989
Stop.

293
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,992
With auburn hair and tawny eyes

294
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,478
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through

295
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,679
You hypnotize me through

296
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,960
And I ran, I ran so far away

297
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,280
I couldn't get away...

298
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,957
All right, I remember you.

299
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,436
And I'll admit
I was a little curt that night.

300
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,670
Curt?

301
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,638
Okay, I was an asshole. I can admit that.

302
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,710
Okay.

303
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,032
But requesting "I Ran" from a serious
musician, it's just... it's too far.

304
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,750
My Lord! Did you just say
"a serious musician"?

305
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,991
- I don't think so.
- Can I borrow what you're wearing?

306
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,833
- Why?
- 'Cause I have an audition next week.

307
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,912
I'm playing a "serious" firefighter.

308
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,992
So you're an actress.
I thought you looked familiar.

309
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,719
Have I seen you in anything?

310
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,838
Uh... coffee shop
on the Warner Brothers lot.

311
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,036
That's a classic.

312
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,873
- Oh, I see. You're a barista.
- Yeah.

313
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,032
And I can see how you could then
look down on me from all the way up there.

314
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,112
Time to... next set.

315
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,876
He doesn't... I don't...
he doesn't tell me what to do.

316
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,360
He just told you what to do.

317
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,319
I know. I let him. What's your name?

318
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,436
- Mia.
- Mia.

319
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,478
Guess I'll see you in the movies.

320
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,911
- You heard of Joseph Campbell?
- Uh, yeah.

321
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,435
I have this idea to do a re-imagining
of Goldilocks and The Three Bears,

322
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,079
but from the perspective of the bears.

323
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,038
- The hero's journey.
- It could be like a franchise.

324
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,110
- Right.
- There's a lot we don't know.

325
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,873
There could have been a fourth bear,
we don't know.

326
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,320
George Michael!

327
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,030
Hello.

328
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,315
- Sorry, it's...
- Yeah, yeah.

329
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,596
I know that guy. Did you get your keys?

330
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,679
Mmm-hmm, yes.

331
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,991
- Can you grab mine?
- Can I what?

332
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,554
Would you be able to grab mine? My keys?

333
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,790
- I can't, your...
- Sorry.

334
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,315
- Can you grab my keys?
- Oh.

335
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,989
- Please?
- Oh, there we go.

336
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,878
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

337
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,117
- What kind?
- It's a Prius.

338
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,120
I mean, that doesn't help me.

339
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,874
- With a green ribbon.
- All right.

340
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,993
- Those look, uh, comfortable.
- They are.

341
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,751
Thank you for saving the day back there.

342
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,799
Well, you didn't really
give me much of a choice.

343
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,799
It's pretty strange that we keep running
into each other.

344
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,553
It is strange.

345
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,030
Maybe it means something.

346
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,156
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

347
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,879
Where's my car?

348
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,592
You gotta put that thing to your chin.

349
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,080
- This?
- Yeah.

350
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,833
Yeah, it makes your head
into an antenna, so...

351
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,195
- Ooh.
- I think it gives you cancer,

352
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,078
- but you find your car faster.
- What?

353
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,914
You don't live as long, but you get where
you're going quicker, so it all evens out.

354
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,514
That sounds terrible.

355
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,200
- Just a suggestion.
- You're a...

356
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,034
You're a real, um...
what's the word I'm looking for?

357
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,713
"Knight in shining armor"?

358
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,838
- Weirdo. That was the word. Weirdo.
- Okay.

359
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,040
Not much to look at, huh?

360
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,673
I've seen better.

361
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,840
The sun is nearly gone

362
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,357
The lights are turning on

363
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,995
A silver shine that stretches to the sea

364
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,792
We've stumbled on a view

365
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,874
That's tailor-made for two

366
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,797
What a shame those two are you and me

367
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,752
Some other girl and guy

368
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,560
Would love this swirling sky

369
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,997
But there's only you and I

370
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,596
And we've got no shot

371
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,037
This could never be

372
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,793
You're not the type for me

373
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,109
Really?

374
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,240
And there's not a spark in sight

375
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,997
What a a waste of a lovely night

376
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,793
You say there's nothing here?

377
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,553
Well, let's make something clear

378
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,950
I think I'll be the one to make that call

379
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,030
But you'll call?

380
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,760
And though you look so cute
in your polyester suit

381
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,910
- It's wool.
- You're right

382
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,754
I'd never fall for you at all

383
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,072
And maybe this appeals

384
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,959
To someone not in heels

385
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,920
Or to any girl who feels

386
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,676
There's some chance for romance

387
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,991
But I'm frankly feeling nothing

388
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,355
Is that so?

389
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,432
Or it could be less than nothing

390
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,280
Good to know, so you agree?

391
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,350
That's right

392
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,633
What a waste of a lovely night.

393
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,279
Ah!

394
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,354
Hi, Greg. Oh, sorry I'm late.

395
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,830
Yeah. Be there soon. Okay, bye.

396
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,912
- It was just right there.
- Just right here.

397
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,154
Do you want a ride to your car?

398
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,516
No, I'm just right up here.

399
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,673
Good night.

400
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,070
Good night.

401
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,076
Excuse me. This is gluten-free, right?

402
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,998
- No.
- What?

403
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,560
Mmm-mmm.

404
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,393
Ugh! I'd like a refund.

405
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,999
Okay. Let me check on that for you.

406
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,276
Mia...

407
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,875
- Hi.
- You're closing Friday.

408
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,600
I can't close on Friday.
I have an audition, remember?

409
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,990
Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.

410
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,152
Oh, and we need to have a little talk
tomorrow, okay?

411
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,959
Fix your apron, please.

412
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,269
Okay.

413
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,474
You again!

414
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,515
What are you doing here?

415
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,832
Oh, you know, just meetings
and... studio heads and...

416
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,274
How'd you get on the lot?

417
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,910
I basically just hauled ass
past the guard gates.

418
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,310
I think I have 20 minutes
until they find me.

419
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,519
You don't have a break coming up, do you?

420
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,398
I'm off in ten minutes, so...

421
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,194
Can I hide in the bathroom?

422
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,431
- Yes.
- Okay.

423
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,915
Sorry.

424
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,959
Um... I actually do have to check.
I'm sorry.

425
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,675
That's the window that Humphrey Bogart
and Ingrid Bergman

426
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,876
looked out of in Casablanca.

427
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,155
- Wow!
- Yeah.

428
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,152
I can't believe you work
right across the street from that.

429
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,993
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

430
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,869
What was your Bogart's name?

431
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,156
What's his name? Is it Greg?

432
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,272
Yeah. Greg.

433
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,159
Right. How long have you been...

434
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,993
We've been seeing each other
for about a month.

435
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,679
Oh, that's great.

436
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,080
He's, um... He's sweet.

437
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,231
Anyway, I love
being around this stuff, you know?

438
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,310
I know what you mean.

439
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,632
I get coffee five miles out of the way
just so I can be near a jazz club.

440
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,200
- Really?
- Yeah, the Van Beek.

441
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,350
- Do you know it?
- Mmm-mmm.

442
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,878
All the big swing bands used to play
there. Count Basie, Chick Webb.

443
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,350
Anyway, it's a samba-tapas
place now, so...

444
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,200
What's a samba-tapas place?

445
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,749
It's just a samba place
where they serve tapas.

446
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,117
- Oh.
- Yeah, so the joke's on... history?

447
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,475
I don't know. That's L.A.

448
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,236
They just worship everything
and they value nothing.

449
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,716
We're about to roll. Stop, please, guys.

450
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,916
Okay.

451
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,559
- You're rolling?
- Yeah.

452
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,996
I know. They shoot movies on my street
all the time, so I know about movies.

453
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,275
- Come this way.
- Great.

454
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,670
It's a lock-down.

455
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,717
- I love her!
- And here we go.

456
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,712
Hey! How'd you get into all this?

457
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,234
And roll!

458
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,720
- Get into what?
- Sound speed!

459
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,314
You know, movies, acting...

460
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,392
- Action!
- Oh, um...

461
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,314
- My aunt was an actress.
- Oh, okay.

462
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,756
She was in a traveling theater company.

463
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,036
I grew up in Boulder City, Nevada.

464
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,715
So across the street from my house
there was this little library

465
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,393
that had an old movie section.

466
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,912
So she took me and we spent an entire day
watching all these old movies

467
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,040
like Notorious and Bringing Up Baby
and Casablanca.

468
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,554
- And...
- Cut it there! Cut!

469
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,677
- Check the gate.
- So we can talk now.

470
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,592
- She sounds incredible.
- She was incredible.

471
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,275
And I would put on all these plays
in my bedroom,

472
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,594
and it would basically just be she and I
re-enacting those scenes from the movies.

473
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,080
And then I would write my own plays.

474
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,719
- Wow.
- Um... Yeah.

475
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,473
I love it.

476
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,678
So anyway, I left college
after two years to come here

477
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,594
and my last audition was for a teen show

478
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,831
pitched as
"Dangerous Minds meets The O.C."

479
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,994
So, yeah, should've been a lawyer.

480
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,992
'Cause the world needs more lawyers.

481
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,196
It doesn't need more actresses.

482
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,680
You're not just an actress.

483
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,355
- What do you mean, "just an actress"?
- You said it yourself.

484
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,875
You're a child prodigy playwright.

485
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,394
That is not what I said.

486
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,996
Well, you're too modest
to say it, but it's true.

487
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,833
You could just write
your own roles, you know?

488
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,798
Write something that's
as interesting as you are,

489
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,314
and you don't have to audition for this...

490
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,760
- uh, piece of caca.
- Yeah.

491
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,240
Look at Louis Armstrong.

492
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,000
He could've just played the marching band
charts that he was given.

493
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,799
But he didn't do it. What did he do?

494
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,952
- What did he do?
- Well, he made history, didn't he?

495
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,279
Well, I'm gonna stop auditioning
and I'm gonna make history instead.

496
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,954
Well, my work is done here.

497
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,272
I should probably tell you something now,
just to get it out of the way.

498
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,589
- Mmm-hmm?
- I hate jazz.

499
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,550
Are you okay?

500
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,916
What do you mean, you hate jazz?

501
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,753
It just means that when I listen to it,
I don't like it.

502
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,753
Yeah, but it's such a blanket statement
you don't like jazz.

503
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,069
What are you doing right now?

504
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,840
Nothing.

505
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,474
I just think that people,
when they say that they...

506
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,036
you know, hate jazz, they just...

507
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,955
They don't have context, they don't know
where it comes from.

508
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,670
Jazz was born in a little
flophouse in New Orleans,

509
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,712
and it's just because people
were crammed in there,

510
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,360
they spoke five different languages,
they couldn't talk to each other.

511
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,229
The only way they could communicate
was with jazz.

512
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,720
Yeah, but what about Kenny G?

513
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,032
- What?
- What about Kenny G?

514
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,952
I mean, what about elevator music?

515
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,509
You know, jazz music that I know?

516
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,353
- What about it?
- From my life?

517
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,750
- Mmm-hmm?
- I just find it relaxing.

518
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,230
It's not relaxing. It's not, it's not.

519
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,438
Sidney Bechet shot somebody because
they told him he played a wrong note.

520
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,749
That's hardly relaxing.

521
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,039
Yeah, but where I grew up there was
this station called K-Jazz 103.

522
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,954
And people would just put on that station
when they had a cocktail party...

523
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,269
Right.

524
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,511
And everyone would
kinda just talk over it.

525
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,590
I know.

526
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,114
- 'Cause it was...
- That's the prob...

527
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,556
Okay, okay. So I think
that's part of the problem,

528
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,433
is that you can't hear it, you know?
You have to see it.

529
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,796
You have to see what's at stake.
I mean, look at these fellas.

530
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,156
Look at the sax player right now.

531
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,471
He just hijacked the song.
He's on his own trip.

532
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,153
Every one of these guys is composing,

533
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,959
they're rearranging, they're writing.

534
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,554
Then they're playing the melody.
They're just...

535
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,994
And now look, the trumpet player.

536
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,560
He's got his own idea.

537
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,157
And so, it's conflict,
and it's compromise, and it's just...

538
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,594
It's new every time.

539
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,151
It's brand-new every night.
It's very, very exciting.

540
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,712
And it's dying. It's dying, Mia.

541
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,274
It's dying on the vine.

542
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,671
And the world says, "Let it die.
It had its time."

543
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,558
Well, not on my watch.

544
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,436
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna have my own club.

545
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,119
- Really?
- Yes.

546
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,999
We're gonna play whatever we want,
whenever we want,

547
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,313
however we want,
as long as it's pure jazz.

548
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,669
Hi, this is Mia Dolan.

549
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,194
Yeah, I just missed a call.

550
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,519
- I got a callback!
- What? Come on! For what?

551
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,638
For a TV show. The one I was
telling you about earlier.

552
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,916
- The "Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?
- Yeah.

553
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,231
- Congratulations! That's incredible!
- It's really exciting.

554
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,312
I feel like I said negative stuff
about it before.

555
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,119
- What?
- It's like Rebel Without a Cause.

556
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,270
Sort of.

557
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,637
"I got the bullets!"

558
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,518
Yes.

559
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,112
- You've never seen it!
- I've never seen it.

560
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,874
Oh, my! You know,
it's playing at the Rialto.

561
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,076
- Really?
- Yes.

562
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,631
You should go... I mean, I can take you.

563
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,710
Okay.

564
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,234
- You know, for research.
- For research.

565
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,152
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

566
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,391
Um, Monday night, 10:00 o'clock.

567
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,278
- Yeah. Great.
- Okay.

568
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,714
For research.

569
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,399
City of stars

570
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:06,159
Are you shining just for me?

571
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,312
City of stars

572
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,155
There's so much that I can't see

573
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,752
Who knows?

574
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:25,599
Is this the start
of something wonderful and new?

575
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,755
Or one more dream

576
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,231
That I cannot make true.

577
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,113
- Stand right there, please.
- Okay. Nice to meet you.

578
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,752
- Hi.
- Hi.

579
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,835
In your own time.

580
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,195
Okay.

581
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,600
Two options.

582
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,990
You either follow my rules
or follow my rules.

583
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,309
- Capisce?
- Thank you.

584
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,870
- Oh...
- Thanks.

585
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,189
I can do it a different way.

586
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,670
No, that's fine.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

587
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,550
- That was fun. Thanks.
- Bye.

588
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,518
Oh, hey, Mia?

589
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,592
- Hey.
- Greg's here.

590
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,674
- What do you mean...
- Hey, babe. Got a space out front.

591
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,479
- Great.
- We should get going.

592
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,119
- Okay.
- My brother landed really early.

593
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,760
- Did you forget? You forgot.
- Shit.

594
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,559
That's tonight.

595
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,950
- That's okay. You forgot.
- Yeah. Okay.

596
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,440
All right, so then I'll just get changed.

597
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,989
- Okay. Great.
- Okay. Great.

598
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,795
- Yeah, that's him.
- Um...

599
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,633
Hey, Josh, yeah. Uh...

600
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,713
Just pickin' up Mia.
We'll be there in, like...

601
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,150
But now we've got this
surround-sound set-up, so it's like...

602
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,596
- It's like being in a movie theater.
- Wow.

603
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,080
But better than being
in a theater, really.

604
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,038
- I can't wait.
- You know theaters these days.

605
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,952
- Yeah.
- They're so dirty.

606
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,440
Yeah, I know. And smelly.

607
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,079
And they're either too hot or too cold.

608
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,839
I know. The quality's really fallen off.

609
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,355
The quality's terrible.
And there's always people talking.

610
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,954
- Because...
- Which is just... Oh, it's the worst!

611
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,232
- Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on one second.
- The texting.

612
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,230
Hello?

613
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,879
- Probably work.
- Mmm.

614
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,753
- Sorry. So, yeah, we love it.
- Oh, it's so nice.

615
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,880
- Well, we have to come. Maybe.
- You should. Come by.

616
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,513
- I got one word for you, man.
- Mmm-hmm?

617
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,832
- Indonesia.
- Never heard anyone say that.

618
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,038
I don't even know. I can't keep track
of it, but honestly, it was life-changing.

619
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,351
- Really?
- Yeah. It affected me.

620
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,955
- It was incredible.
- Is it amazing?

621
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,236
- Yes.
- A five-star jungle eco-resort

622
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,118
- you would not believe.
- Amazing.

623
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,520
We were thinking about Nicaragua.

624
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,354
The thing about Nicaragua is it's less
developed, it's a little under-developed.

625
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,430
Right.

626
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,196
I think there's a little more... Yeah,
then, I just don't know if it's safe.

627
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,953
- Yeah, yeah. It's...
- You know?

628
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,156
Yeah, you don't want to explore too far.

629
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,754
Kind of a "natives are restless"
sort of thing.

630
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,796
Actually, China's going to build a canal.

631
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,120
I'm sorry.

632
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,956
...the immensity of our universe.

633
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,839
For many days before the end of our earth,

634
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,639
people will look into the night sky

635
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:48,237
and notice a star increasingly bright
and increasingly near.

636
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,710
As this star approaches us...

637
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,510
Jim Stark.

638
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,398
I'll go find a place. I'm sorry.

639
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,960
As this star approaches us,

640
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,952
the weather will change.

641
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:04,193
The great polar fields of the north
and south will rot and divide,

642
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,318
and the seas will turn warm.

643
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,632
The last of us search the heavens
and stand amazed,

644
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,554
for the stars will still be there
and will be...

645
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,589
Mmm...

646
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,077
I have an idea.

647
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,438
What is that? Is it a script?

648
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,920
It's a play.

649
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,834
A play? You better give us all roles!

650
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,755
Actually, it's a one-woman show!
So I can't.

651
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,559
Wow. Is that gonna happen every time?

652
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,279
I think so.

653
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,477
Ahh! It's one-way!

654
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,352
- I love you.
- I love you too.

655
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,319
Oh!

656
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,040
Sebastian?

657
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,835
Keith.

658
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,320
Come here, man.

659
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,913
- How are you?
- I've been good, man.

660
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,753
This is Mia. Mia, Keith.

661
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,069
Hi, Mia. Nice to meet you.

662
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,720
- Nice to meet you.
- I used to play with this guy.

663
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,393
Went to school together.

664
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,119
- So how you been, brother?
- Great.

665
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,634
Never been better. How 'bout you?

666
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,473
I been really good. Been very busy.

667
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,029
- I got a new combo.
- Okay. Cool.

668
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,554
We're lookin' for keys.

669
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,475
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

670
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,438
- No, I'm good.
- Are you sure? It pays.

671
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,279
I'm good.

672
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,636
Let's just grab a drink then.
It's been too long.

673
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,995
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you, Mia.

674
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,480
Nice to meet you.

675
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,674
"The end."

676
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,632
- Genius.
- Really?

677
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,359
- Yes. Yes.
- Really?

678
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,669
It feels really nostalgic to me.

679
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,194
- Is it too nostalgic?
- That's the point. That's...

680
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,710
Are people gonna like it?

681
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,360
- Fuck 'em.
- You always say that.

682
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,116
- Well, I truly believe it.
- I made you something.

683
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,840
- For what?
- For your club.

684
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,995
Why does it say "Seb's"?

685
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,639
'Cause I think you should call it "Seb's."

686
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,710
- What?
- 'Cause no one will come

687
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,399
to "Chicken on a Stick."

688
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,392
Is that a music note as an apostrophe?

689
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,755
- Yes! Yeah.
- That's pretty cool.

690
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,957
It's gotta be "Chicken on a Stick,"

691
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,872
because Charlie Parker got his nickname...

692
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,270
I know, because he loved chicken.

693
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,590
That's why they called him "Bird."

694
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,434
So I'm gonna have chicken, beer, jazz.
"Chicken on a Stick."

695
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,797
I know. You should drop the chicken
and just have drinks and jazz, and also...

696
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,952
- I'm not droppin' the chicken.
- You could maybe do it somewhere else.

697
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,315
- What are you talk...
- Find a new spot.

698
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,834
It's gotta be the Van Beek.

699
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,240
Well, it doesn't have to be the Van Beek.

700
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,755
I can't let them samba
all over its history.

701
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,752
I can't do it.

702
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:21,676
- You can let them, but you refuse to.
- Your play's incredible.

703
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,959
You know, the whole world
from your bedroom.

704
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,033
What else do they want? Who's doing that?

705
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,311
- I'm doing that.
- You're doing that.

706
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:37,633
Who was that guy at The Lighthouse?
The guy that offered you the gig?

707
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,836
- Keith.
- Yeah.

708
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,994
- Why was it so weird between you two?
- It's always weird with him.

709
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,309
- Really?
- Yeah.

710
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,672
But he seemed kinda nice
'cause he did offer you a job.

711
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,879
- Are you gonna call him?
- No. No.

712
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,872
All right.

713
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,237
So... Here's what we know.

714
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,118
Yeah?

715
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,591
It's definitely "Chicken on a Stick,"

716
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,717
and your play is gonna be a triumph.

717
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,951
It's a one-woman show, so it's just me...

718
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,509
No, I mean, I'm acting in it, too.

719
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:18,836
No, Mom, I'm not getting paid.
I'm paying to do it.

720
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,794
He's great. He's gonna
open his own jazz club.

721
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,519
Yeah, it's gonna be incredible.

722
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,713
No, he hasn't. He hasn't opened it yet.

723
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,029
He needs some...

724
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,919
He's saving up, I think.

725
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,072
No, he doesn't have a steady gig.

726
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,959
But he's figuring it out,
it's just been a little tricky lately.

727
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,232
Mom, he's gonna find a way to open it
and you're gonna love it, okay?

728
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,549
How's Dad?

729
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:07,718
Sebastian. Come on in, man.

730
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,112
- Thanks for comin'.
- Thanks for having me.

731
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,556
Wasn't sure I'd see you today.

732
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,518
- So... Here's the deal.
- Okay.

733
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,513
We got distribution with Universal.
We've got our own imprint.

734
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,000
About to go on the road.

735
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,157
Uh, we can pay you 1,000 bucks a week,

736
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,358
plus a cut of the ticket revenue
and merchandising.

737
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,079
Sound good?

738
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,591
- Sebastian? All right.
- Yeah.

739
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,955
- Let's play.
- Okay.

740
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,919
Tonight.

741
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,070
I know. It's different.

742
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,556
But you say you wanna save jazz.

743
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,075
How you gonna save jazz
if no one's listening?

744
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,635
Jazz is dying because of people like you.

745
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,919
You're playin' to 90-year-olds
at The Lighthouse.

746
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,475
Where are the kids?
Where are the young people?

747
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:53,952
You're so obsessed with Kenny Clarke
and Thelonious Monk.

748
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,679
These guys were revolutionaries.

749
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,874
How are you gonna be a revolutionary
if you're such a traditionalist?

750
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,749
You're holdin' onto the past,
but jazz is about the future.

751
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,552
I know.

752
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,553
The other guy, he wasn't as good as you.

753
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,714
But you're a pain in the ass, man.

754
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,599
City of stars

755
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:06,995
Are you shining just for me?

756
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,113
City of stars

757
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:14,114
There's so much that I can't see

758
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,558
Who knows?

759
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,795
I felt it from the first embrace
I shared with you

760
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:30,074
That now our dreams

761
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,994
May finally come true

762
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,840
City of stars

763
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,436
Just one thing everybody wants

764
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,880
There in the bars

765
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:53,831
Or through the smokescreen
of the crowded restaurants

766
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,998
It's love

767
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,754
Yes, all we're lookin' for is love

768
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:03,237
From someone else

769
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,516
- A rush
- A glance

770
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,956
- A touch
- A dance

771
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,999
A look in somebody's eyes

772
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,151
To light up the skies

773
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,517
To open the world and send it reeling

774
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,718
A voice that says "I'll be here"

775
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,190
And you'll be all right

776
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,079
I don't care if I know

777
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,237
Just where I will go

778
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,677
'Cause all that I need's
this crazy feeling

779
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,834
The rat-tat-tat of my heart

780
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,192
Think I want it to stay

781
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,399
City of stars

782
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,190
Are you shinin' just for me?

783
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:46,116
City of stars

784
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,157
You never shined

785
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,551
So brightly.

786
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:25,517
I don't know why I keep movin' my body

787
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:30,436
I don't know
if this is wrong or if it's right

788
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,751
I don't know if it's the beat

789
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,514
But something's taken over me

790
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:40,192
And I just know I feel so good tonight

791
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,038
I don't know what your name is,
but I like it

792
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:56,558
I've been thinkin' 'bout
some things I wanna try

793
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,109
I don't know what you came to do

794
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,874
But I wanna do it with you

795
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:04,953
And I just know I feel so good tonight

796
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,191
Oh, if we keep on dancin'

797
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:15,196
Take our rhythm to new heights

798
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:20,877
Feel the heat of passion, baby

799
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,397
Light up the night!

800
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,591
We can start a fire!

801
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,149
Come on, let it burn, baby

802
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,232
We can start a fire!

803
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,636
Let the tables turn, baby

804
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:39,034
We can start a fire!

805
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,111
I just know I feel so good

806
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,271
Don't you know I feel so good

807
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:48,593
I just know I feel so good

808
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,478
Tonight

809
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:57,991
I don't care if this turns into a riot

810
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:02,438
Let's get reckless, tear this place
down to the floor

811
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,870
Turn the music way up loud

812
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,919
Can't nobody stop us now

813
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,072
I just know I feel so good tonight

814
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,752
I just know I feel so good tonight

815
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,396
We can start a fire!

816
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,200
Come on, let it burn, baby!

817
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,317
We can start a fire!

818
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,596
Let the tables turn, baby!

819
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:49,471
We can start a fire!

820
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,553
Oh, I just know I feel so good

821
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,109
Don't you know I feel so good

822
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:59,592
Don't you know, don't you know

823
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,194
Tonight!

824
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,793
Hey, it's me.

825
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,200
Uh, I'm not sure where you are right now.

826
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,513
I think Boston?
Maybe Dallas, I don't know.

827
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,478
Uh...

828
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:53,318
I haven't heard from you in a little while
and I miss you.

829
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,833
All right, bye.

830
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,478
I thought... Surprise.

831
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,433
Gotta leave first thing in the morning,
but I just had to see you...

832
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,678
It's so nice to be home.

833
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,159
I'm so glad you're home.

834
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,791
How's the play goin'?

835
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,519
Um... I'm nervous.

836
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,319
- You are? Why?
- Mmm-hmm.

837
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,392
Because what if people show up?

838
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,755
Piece of caca.

839
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,312
- You nervous about what they think?
- I'm nervous to do it.

840
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,359
I'm nervous to get up on a stage
and perform for people...

841
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,794
I mean, I don't need to say that to you.

842
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,476
- It's gonna be incredible.
- You don't get it, but I'm terrified.

843
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,474
They should be so lucky to see it.
I can't wait.

844
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,040
I can.

845
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,469
When do you leave, the morning?

846
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:30,712
Yeah. 6:45.

847
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:31,836
- Ooh.
- Boise.

848
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,911
- Boise?
- Boise.

849
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,639
To Boise!

850
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,874
You should come.

851
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,549
To Boise?

852
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,313
Yeah, you can knock that
off your bucket list.

853
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,394
Oh, that would be... really exciting.
I wish I could.

854
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,709
What are you doing after the tour?

855
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,560
Why can't you?

856
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:54,790
- Come to Boise?
- Yeah.

857
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,314
'Cause I have to rehearse.

858
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,392
But can't you rehearse anywhere?

859
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,476
Anywhere you are?

860
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,392
I mean, I guess.

861
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,871
Um... well, all my stuff is here,
and it's in two weeks,

862
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,714
so I don't really think that would be...

863
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:18,158
- Okay. Well.
- ...the best idea right now, but...

864
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,436
I wish I could.

865
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,398
We're just gonna have to try
and see each other.

866
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,675
We almost never see each other.

867
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,353
I know, but when are you done?

868
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,194
What do you mean? I mean...

869
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,351
When are you finished with the whole tour?

870
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:35,320
After we finish, we're gonna go
and record, and then we go back on tour.

871
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,834
You know, we tour so we can
make the record,

872
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,196
so we can go back and tour the record.

873
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,350
So it's like the long haul?

874
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,278
What do you mean, "the long haul"?

875
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:54,639
I mean the long haul, like you're gonna
stay in this band for a long time.

876
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,400
On tour.

877
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,913
What did you think I was gonna do?

878
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,913
I don't...
I hadn't really thought it through.

879
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,195
I didn't know that the band...

880
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,997
- was so important.
- You didn't think it would be successful?

881
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,674
Um...

882
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,514
No, that's not really what I mean.
I just mean that you...

883
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,310
You're gonna be on tour for,
what, months now? Years?

884
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,959
Yeah. I don't believe... This is it.

885
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,430
I mean, it could feasibly be...

886
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,240
I could be on tour with this
for a couple of years, at least.

887
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,039
Just this record.

888
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,354
Do you like the music you're playing?

889
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,997
I don't...

890
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,676
I don't know what it matters.

891
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,832
Well, it matters, because if you're gonna
give up your dream,

892
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,836
I think it matters that you like
what you're playing on the road for years.

893
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,840
Do you like the music I'm playing?

894
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:54,880
Yeah. I do.

895
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,316
I just didn't think that you did.

896
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,790
- Yeah, well...
- You always said Keith is the worst,

897
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,998
and now you're gonna be on tour with him
for years, so I just didn't...

898
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,560
- What are you doing right now?
- ...know if you were happy.

899
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,676
- Why are you doing this?
- I don't...

900
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,911
- What do you mean, why am I doing this?
- I thought you wanted me to do this.

901
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,753
It just sounds like now
you don't want me to do it.

902
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,309
What do you mean, I wanted you to do this?

903
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,517
This is what you wanted for me.

904
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,676
To be in this band?

905
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,480
To be in a band.
To have a steady job, you know?

906
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,911
To be... you know.

907
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,957
Of course I wanted you
to have a steady job,

908
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,997
so that you could take care of yourself
and your life

909
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,355
and you could start your club.

910
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,796
So I'm doing that, so I don't understand.
Why aren't we celebrating?

911
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,792
Why aren't you starting your club?

912
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,395
You said yourself no one
wants to go to that club.

913
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,517
No one wants to go to a club
called "Chicken on a Stick."

914
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,670
So change the name!

915
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,911
Well, no one likes jazz! Not even you!

916
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,838
I do like jazz now because of you!

917
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,355
And this is what I thought
you wanted me to do!

918
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:47,638
What am I supposed to do?
Go back to playing "Jingle Bells"?

919
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:48,710
I'm not saying that.

920
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,956
I'm saying why don't you take
what you've made and start the club?

921
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,680
Scraping pennies so I can start a club
no one wants to go to?

922
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,599
People will want to go to it
because you're passionate about it,

923
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,996
and people love what other people
are passionate about.

924
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,436
- You remind people of what they forgot.
- Not in my experience.

925
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:07,796
Well, whatever, all right?
It's just time to grow up, you know?

926
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,951
I have a steady job,
this is what I'm doing.

927
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,713
And now all of a sudden
if you had these problems,

928
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,519
I wish you would have said them earlier,

929
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,034
before I signed
on the goddamn dotted line!

930
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,839
I'm pointing out that you had a dream

931
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,673
that you followed,
that you were sticking to...

932
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,877
This is the dream! This is the dream.

933
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,235
This is not your dream!

934
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,551
Guys like me work their whole lives
to be in something

935
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,712
that's successful, that people like.
You know?

936
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,635
I mean, I'm finally in something
that people enjoy.

937
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,074
Since when do you care about being liked?

938
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,640
Just 'cause I don't enjoy it,
it doesn't matter.

939
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,672
Why do you care so much about being liked?

940
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,752
You're an actress!
What are you talking about?

941
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,599
Maybe you just liked me
when I was on my ass

942
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,751
'cause it made you
feel better about yourself.

943
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,791
- Are you kidding?
- No.

944
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,109
I don't know.

945
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,836
Okay, fellas. I'll see ya tomorrow.

946
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,149
- Sebastian?
- Yeah?

947
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,879
You're good for tonight, right?

948
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,514
What are you talking about?

949
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,160
7:00, the photo shoot.

950
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,511
MOJO. Are you good?

951
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,591
- I thought that was next Thursday.
- No, it's tonight.

952
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,634
Is that okay?

953
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,952
- Give me the other camera!
- What's wrong with that one?

954
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,477
"What's wrong with that one?" It doesn't
bloody work, that's what's wrong with it!

955
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,233
All right, trumpet, that's lovely.

956
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,912
Lovely! Beautiful, beautiful!

957
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,276
Okay, keyboard. Okay, look up.

958
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,353
That's good. That's good,
that's lovely. Lovely.

959
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:31,275
Okay, cut the music!
That is lovely. That's lovely.

960
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:35,149
Okay, now bite your lip
like this, sort of like...

961
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,870
like you're concentrating on something,
I don't know, like a piece of your music.

962
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,189
Bite my what?

963
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,158
Your lip. You know, bite your lip like...

964
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,034
Yeah, that's good. That's great.

965
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,349
Beautiful! Beautiful.

966
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,717
Okay, now just move your glasses
down on... onto the nose...

967
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,395
A little bit further, just a little bit,
a touch further.

968
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,716
Keep your head down, but look up at me.

969
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,473
Look sort of moody.

970
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:00,155
Yeah! That's beautiful! That is great!

971
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,278
Okay, turn the keyboard on live!

972
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,680
Do you wanna hear the keyboard then?

973
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:07,400
You don't have to bite your lip now.

974
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,915
Well, actually play something.

975
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,117
Play something. You know? Anything.

976
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,920
You're a pianist, aren't you?
Play something.

977
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,159
That's great, that's beautiful.

978
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,072
That's lovely. Oh, that's good.

979
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,197
No, don't stop. Keep playing.

980
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,920
Go on, just keep playing. That was great!

981
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:19,077
...shoot myself in the head.

982
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,719
She's not even good.

983
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,439
That whole window thing...

984
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,910
Yeah, what was that shit with the window?

985
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,640
Oh, my God! Don't quit your day job.

986
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,552
Oh, well...

987
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:32,519
Not good. One-woman shows
are always terrible.

988
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,029
Mia!

989
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,714
Mia. I'm so sorry.

990
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,600
Just tell me how it went. How was it?

991
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,115
- Don't help me.
- I'm sorry.

992
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,556
- I'm sorry I've been such a prick.
- You're sorry, you're sorry...

993
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:14,394
You're sorry. You're sorry...

994
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,315
I'm gonna make it up to you.
Let me make it up to you, okay?

995
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,911
- I don't blame you for not wanting...
- It's over.

996
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,992
- What is?
- It's over.

997
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,400
What?

998
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,754
All of this.

999
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:38,390
I'm done embarrassing myself.
I'm done, I'm done.

1000
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,159
- Nobody showed up.
- So what? So what?

1001
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,675
I can't pay back the theater.
This is so...

1002
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,838
I'm gonna go home for a while.

1003
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:50,675
- I'll come see you tomorrow.
- No, I'm going "home" home.

1004
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,355
- This is home.
- No, it's not anymore.

1005
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,639
- Yep?
- Hi, I'm trying to reach Mia Dolan.

1006
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,229
Wrong number.

1007
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,880
She's not answering her cell.
I was told I might find her here.

1008
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:18,189
Not anymore.

1009
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,431
- Okay, well, if you do talk to her...
- I won't.

1010
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,239
...could you tell her Jane
at Amy Brandt Casting

1011
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,879
is trying to reach her?

1012
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:30,949
Casting?

1013
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,840
Who the hell is that?

1014
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,709
Shut that thing off!

1015
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,669
Why did you come here?

1016
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,031
- Because I have good news.
- What?

1017
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:05,750
Amy Brandt, the casting director?

1018
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,197
- Yeah.
- She was at your play, and she loved it.

1019
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:13,194
And she loved it so much that she wants
you to come in tomorrow

1020
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,954
and audition for this huge movie
that she's got.

1021
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:19,600
I'm not going to that.

1022
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:22,956
- I'm not going to that.
- What?

1023
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,760
That one's gonna be...
No. That one's gonna be...

1024
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,115
I'm sorry?

1025
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,032
That will kill me.

1026
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:31,954
- What?!
- What?

1027
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:33,838
What? Shh! Stop!

1028
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,394
- No!
- Shh! Shh!

1029
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:37,597
You have to be quiet.
We're in a neighborhood.

1030
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,797
If you want me to be quiet,
you have to make some goddamn sense!

1031
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,109
- Tell me why you're not going.
- They'll call the police.

1032
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,236
- Because. Because...
- Why?

1033
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,994
I've been to a million auditions,
and the same thing happens every time

1034
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:47,914
where I get interrupted because someone
wants to get a sandwich!

1035
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,640
Or I'm crying, and they start laughing!

1036
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,757
Or there's people
sitting in the waiting room,

1037
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:57,039
and they're like me, but prettier
and better at the...

1038
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,759
Because maybe I'm not good enough!

1039
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,116
- Yes, you are.
- No...

1040
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:02,759
- No, maybe I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

1041
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,639
- Maybe I'm not.
- You are.

1042
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,795
Maybe I'm one of those people
that has always wanted to do it,

1043
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,112
but it's like a pipe dream for me,
you know?

1044
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,634
And then, you said it,

1045
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:19,554
you change your dreams,
and then you grow up.

1046
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,836
Maybe I'm one of those people,
and I'm not supposed to.

1047
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,957
And I can go back to school,

1048
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,157
and I can find something else
I'm supposed to do.

1049
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:30,234
'Cause I left to do that,
and it's been six years,

1050
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,913
and I don't want to do it anymore.

1051
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:36,869
Why?

1052
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:42,073
- Why what?
- Why don't you want to do it anymore?

1053
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:46,629
'Cause I think it hurts
a little bit too much.

1054
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,155
You're a baby.

1055
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,114
- I'm not a baby. I'm trying to grow up.
- You are.

1056
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,759
- You're crying like a baby.
- Oh, my God.

1057
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:57,958
You have an audition tomorrow at 5:30.

1058
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,714
I'll be out front at 8:00 A.M.

1059
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,196
You'll be out front or not, I don't know.

1060
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,354
How'd you find me here?

1061
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,433
The house in front of the library.

1062
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:54,712
- I got coffee.
- Okay, great.

1063
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,075
Mia?

1064
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,356
Hi, Mia. I'm Amy and this is Frank.

1065
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:23,715
Hi. How are ya?

1066
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,071
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad we found you.

1067
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,594
Me, too.

1068
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:33,880
The film shoots in Paris,
and we don't have a script.

1069
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,440
It's gonna be a process.

1070
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,597
We're gonna build the character
around the actress.

1071
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:40,320
It's a three month rehearsal
and a four month shoot.

1072
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,073
Okay.

1073
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:47,710
And we thought that you
could just tell us a story.

1074
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,029
About?

1075
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:52,796
- You can just tell us anything.
- Anything?

1076
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,679
Yeah, just tell us a story.
You're a storyteller.

1077
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,877
Um...

1078
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,032
Whenever you're ready.

1079
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,076
My aunt used to live in Paris.

1080
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,069
I remember she used to come home

1081
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:26,440
and she would tell us these stories
about being abroad, and...

1082
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:30,069
I remember...

1083
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:34,598
She told us that she jumped
into the river once.

1084
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,712
Barefoot

1085
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:42,794
She smiled

1086
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:47,113
Leapt without looking

1087
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:54,399
And tumbled into

1088
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:56,989
The Seine

1089
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:04,154
The water was freezing

1090
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:08,757
She spent a month sneezing

1091
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:13,471
But said she would do it again

1092
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:21,560
Here's to the ones who dream

1093
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:29,559
Foolish as they may seem

1094
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:37,392
Here's to the hearts that ache

1095
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:44,634
Here's to the mess we make

1096
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,760
She captured a feeling

1097
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,992
Sky with no ceiling

1098
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:57,199
The sunset inside a frame

1099
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,716
She lived in her liquor

1100
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,838
And died with a flicker

1101
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:10,079
I'll always remember the flame

1102
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:17,515
Here's to the ones who dream

1103
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:24,397
Foolish as they may seem

1104
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:30,471
Here's to the hearts that ache

1105
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,918
Here's to the mess we make

1106
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,471
She told me

1107
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,394
A bit of madness is key

1108
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:45,752
To give us new colors to see

1109
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:52,031
Who knows where it will lead us?

1110
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:56,512
And that's why they need us

1111
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:59,798
So bring on the rebels

1112
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,395
The ripples from pebbles

1113
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:06,793
The painters and poets and plays

1114
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,590
And here's to the fools

1115
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:13,479
Who dream

1116
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:18,794
Crazy as they may seem

1117
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:24,000
Here's to the hearts that break

1118
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:27,079
Here's to the mess

1119
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,720
We make

1120
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,034
I

1121
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:38,591
Trace it all back to then

1122
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:47,032
Her and the snow and the Seine

1123
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:53,597
Smiling through it

1124
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:59,359
She said she'd do it

1125
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,714
Again.

1126
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,633
When do you find out?

1127
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,040
Oh, they said the next couple days.

1128
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,510
But I'm not expecting
to find anything out.

1129
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:26,869
You're gonna get it.

1130
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,280
- I really might not.
- Yes, you are.

1131
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:31,034
- I hope you're not disappointed.
- I know.

1132
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:33,760
I know. I know these things.

1133
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,069
Where are we?

1134
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:43,599
- Griffith Park.
- Where... are we?

1135
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,433
I know.

1136
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,553
I don't know.

1137
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,158
What do we do?

1138
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,199
I don't think we can do anything,

1139
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:59,193
- 'cause when you get this...
- If I get this.

1140
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:04,071
When you get this, you gotta give it
everything you got.

1141
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:07,189
Everything.

1142
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,919
It's your dream.

1143
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,957
What are you gonna do?

1144
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,918
I gotta follow my own plan, you know?

1145
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,071
Stay here and get my own thing goin'.

1146
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:26,439
You're gonna be in Paris. Good jazz there.

1147
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:31,356
And you love jazz now. Right?

1148
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:34,309
Yes.

1149
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,990
And I guess we're just gonna
have to wait and see.

1150
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,872
I'm always gonna love you.

1151
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,153
I'm always gonna love you, too.

1152
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,272
Look at this view!

1153
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:14,200
- I've seen better. Yeah.
- It's the worst.

1154
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,552
I've never been here during the day.

1155
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:14,719
Hi. Could I have two iced coffees, please?

1156
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,269
- Right. Of course.
- On us.

1157
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,272
Oh, no, thank you, I insist.

1158
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:53,235
Sounds good. Harris did a good job.

1159
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:55,880
- Took him long enough.
- It always does.

1160
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:57,394
Signature time.

1161
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:01,637
Not doin' too bad, Seb.

1162
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:04,599
- "Not too bad" is great.
- See ya tonight.

1163
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:06,000
See ya tonight.

1164
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,119
Hi.

1165
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,271
- How was your day?
- Good.

1166
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,799
- Hmm. How is she?
- She's great.

1167
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,109
- Yeah?
- Yeah, come on.

1168
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,317
Hi, buddy!

1169
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:44,390
I didn't think you were gonna be home yet.

1170
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,631
- Are you drawing?
- Yeah.

1171
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:49,792
Can I help? You know I love to draw.

1172
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:31,960
Okay, Chelsea, we're gonna go.
Are you good?

1173
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:34,635
- We're good.
- You need anything?

1174
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,712
Bye, baby.

1175
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,120
- Say "bye, Mommy."
- Sleep well.

1176
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,351
- Bye, Mommy.
- Have fun with Chelsea.

1177
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:41,794
Have fun. Bye, Mia.

1178
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:43,553
- Bye. Thank you so much.
- Good night, guys.

1179
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:45,836
- Night, sweetie. Bye.
- Good night.

1180
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,758
Oh, boy.

1181
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:00,031
What if we miss this?
What do you wanna tell Natalie?

1182
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:03,033
Oh... We'll just see it back in New York.

1183
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,679
Okay.

1184
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:09,791
- I do not miss this.
- This is bad.

1185
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:18,634
Do you want to just
pull off here and get dinner?

1186
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,837
- Sure, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

1187
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,195
Okay.

1188
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,351
Do you want to check it out?

1189
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,834
This place is pretty cool.

1190
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:29,953
I love them.

1191
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:20,872
Cal Bennett on sax!

1192
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,679
Javier Gonzalez on trumpet.

1193
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:25,400
The lovely Nedra Wheeler on bass.

1194
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:30,350
The one and only
Clifton "Fou-fou" Eddie on drums!

1195
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:31,794
And a little too good on piano,

1196
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:34,475
so good he's gonna own
this place if I'm not careful,

1197
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,119
Khirye Tyler, everybody.

1198
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:49,514
Uh...

1199
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:51,512
Welcome to Seb's.

1200
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:43,837
I just heard you play and I want to...

1201
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,440
Do you want to stay for another?

1202
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:41,638
- No, we should go.
- All right.

1203
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:45,470
One, two. One, two, three, four.

1204
01:59:46,305 --> 02:00:46,466
