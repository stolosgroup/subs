3
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,853
The screams ofthe victim
deaden his pain.

4
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,815
The act of killing
makes him feel intensely alive.

5
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,651
aWhat he feels next is not guilt...

6
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,528
...but disappointment.

7
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,030
It was not as wonderful as he'd hoped.

8
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,825
Maybe next time, it will be perfect.

9
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,746
And as his determination builds
to take another life...

10
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,373
...he plans, in obsessive detail...

11
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,292
...what props he'll bring...

12
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,461
...what knots he'll tie.

13
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,131
Let me ask you guys something.

14
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,758
What turns you on?

15
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,969
What really does it for you?
Is it a great body?

16
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:38,055
Is it a nice smile? Is it beautiful legs?

17
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:43,603
What turns on a serial killer is the suffering
and death of another human being.

18
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,606
Now, l'd like to ask you guys a favor.

19
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,692
If you could all stand up,
all the men in the room.

20
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,486
Please indulge me.

21
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,910
Come on, it's only fair,
after all the time you've ogled us.

22
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,538
Now, would everybody under 20
and over 35 have a seat.

23
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:07,293
If you are of Asian or African-American
descent, you may sit down.

24
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,087
Kenny, turn that light on, please...

25
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,882
...so we can get a good look
at these guys.

26
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,093
Ladies, what do you see?

27
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,721
Some pretty cute guys, don't you think?

28
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,475
If one of these fellas asked you out
for a drink, you'd go.

29
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,393
Let me tell you something.

30
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:28,606
Nine out of 10 serial killers
are white males...

31
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,399
...aged 20 to 35...

32
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,527
...just like these.

33
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,572
Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono...

34
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,116
...Berkowitz, Dahmer, Ted Bundy.

35
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,327
They were quiet, unassuming...

36
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,912
...even nice.

37
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,498
They had jobs.
They made decent neighbors.

38
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,792
Their victims trusted them.

39
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,335
The FBI estimates...

40
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,713
...there could be as many
as 35 serial killers...

41
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,758
...cruising for victims even as l speak.

42
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,427
Guys, sit down. You're scaring me.

43
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:03,891
Serial killers are not
a 20th-century invention...

44
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,727
...but we are spawning them
in greater numbers.

45
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,565
The state of Florida
spent almost $8 million...

46
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,400
...to electrocute Ted--

47
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,570
You're dead.

48
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,870
Sorry.

49
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,458
The state of Florida spent $8 million
to electrocute Ted Bundy.

50
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,045
Wouldn't that money have been
better spent keeping him confined...

51
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,756
...subject to intense scientific scrutiny?

52
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:41,470
Isn't our best hope to try to identify
the Ted Bundys of the future...

53
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,431
...before they kill?

54
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,558
Thank you.

55
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,649
- Don't park next to vans.
- Thank you.

56
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:54,942
Thanks for coming.

57
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,944
I'm hitting the ladies' room.

58
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,947
Since she's using the ladies' room,
I'll use the men's room.

59
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,326
- Thanks for your help, Tom.
- Anytime.

60
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,415
Hello?

61
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,718
Sorry, ma'am.

62
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,221
- Okay, doc, it's all yours.
- Thank you.

63
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:33,916
Dr. Hudson?

64
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,292
Hello?

65
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,848
Come out with your hands up.

66
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,352
I'm not gonna ask you--

67
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,779
What are you doing with my gun?

68
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,032
How'd you get my gun?

69
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,953
What are you doing in the ladies' room?
Are you spying on little girls again?

70
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:16,125
Hey. I'll tell you something right now. Hey!

71
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,210
Don't she look pretty up there, officer?

72
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,379
You know what l want to know?

73
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,549
Help me out on this, Dr. Hudson,
since you're the expert.

74
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,718
How would a fartknocker like me...

75
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,345
...take out a dumb guy like this?

76
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,347
Would you stick him...

77
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,766
...or would you shoot him?

78
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,226
Stick him or shoot him? l can't--

79
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,773
I can't decide, but l think
I'll just go ahead on and do both.

80
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:48,324
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Hot potato!

81
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,287
You bloodied up my knife, you dog.

82
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,997
I hate cops.

83
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,793
Hey, Dr. Hudson.

84
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,256
What do you say me and you
have a little fun?

85
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,495
John Adams....

86
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,497
Adams...

87
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,207
...Jefferson...

88
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,961
...James Monroe, James Madison...

89
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,381
...John Quincy Adams.

90
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,802
Andy?

91
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,935
John Quincy Adams.

92
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,729
Andrew Jackson.

93
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,066
Martin Van Buren.

94
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,485
Wait a minute. This is so stupid.

95
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,571
Calvin Coolidge.

96
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,072
Andy?

97
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,146
Oh, God!

98
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,385
Hello, Kate.

99
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,654
I got you beat.

100
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,123
Bye, Kate.

101
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,875
Police! Freeze!

102
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,635
The good news is, you're still alive.

103
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,805
You see a downside to that?

104
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,016
This is pretty remedial stuff, Ruben.

105
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,310
Remedial? Let's review the scenario.

106
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,229
Didn't anyone at the Academy
teach you to shoot conservatively?

107
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,190
Boom-boom-boom-ba-boom-boom-boom?

108
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,441
You shredded him.

109
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,109
I'm an intuitive cop.

110
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,195
With poor impulse control.

111
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,239
Let's assume you didn't mow down
a 75-year-old man...

112
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,450
...who couldn't hear your warning
because he's deaf.

113
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,659
Huh? Eh?

114
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,872
Let's say you greased the guy
while he was trying to surrender. Ah.

115
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,374
Well, he jumped out at me.

116
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,876
Now you're on leave pending an inquiry.

117
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,629
Friends wonder if you're a psychopath.
On top of that...

118
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:58,342
...the guy's junkie wife's lawyer slams
a wrongful-death action up your tail.

119
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,677
All right, smartass,
let's see how you do.

120
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,311
The shoulder of his gun hand's exposed.

121
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:13,273
You hit the brachial nerve,
he drops the gun. You read him his rights.

122
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,485
Plus, you haven't taken a human life
so your karma's still okay.

123
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,446
You hungry? l'm starving.

124
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,741
- Aren't you gonna answer that?
- No, it's probably not important.

125
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,201
I'm sure she thinks it is.

126
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,620
How about Moroccan?
You like couscous?

127
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,164
Don't you want to know which one it is?

128
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,793
Hello?

129
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,755
You must have mental telepathy.
I was just about to call you.

130
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,342
The usual.
Long days making sure justice prevails.

131
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,459
- 10390 Mariposa.
- Yeah.

132
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,712
Scaffolding on the north
and west sides of the building.

133
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,923
Great. The Mouth is here.

134
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,925
You can end her career.

135
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,011
Pop her in the brachial nerve,
she'll drop the microphone.

136
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,930
I miss your sexy ways

137
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,473
It's a thought.

138
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,808
Yeah

139
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,019
I miss the ins and outs--

140
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,613
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

141
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,282
Can you confirm reports
that this latest murder...

142
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,409
...fits the same pattern as the other two?

143
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,787
We just got here. l'm not prepared to--

144
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,374
Is there a serial killer stalking
the streets of San Francisco?

145
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,001
- Susan, thank you.
- Excuse me. l'm a member of the press.

146
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,461
Hey, MJ, all done.

147
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,882
Hey, Jim. Can you grab some overalls
from the crowd, some nice, clear faces?

148
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,968
- l'll make them say "cheese."
- Oh, Jesus.

149
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,886
The landlady found her.

150
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,138
The front door was open.
She tried the bell.

151
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,517
The tenant didn't answer,
so she went inside and found the body.

152
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:57,354
She used the telephone to dial 911,
otherwise she touched nothing.

153
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,815
- You're thinking robbery?
- lt doesn't look like it.

154
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,818
It's all yours, kids.
I'll take care of the Mouth.

155
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,278
Good morning, sir.

156
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,573
- With this scaffolding, we should call--
- l'll call the contractor.

157
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,949
Take this.

158
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,995
- Good morning.
- Morning.

159
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,621
Morning, MJ.

160
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,249
- Were you first on the scene?
- Yes.

161
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,251
- That the landlady?
- Yeah.

162
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,712
- Ruben? Thanks.
- Sure.

163
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,464
- "Johnson." What's the first part?
- Mike.

164
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,341
Did you touch anything, Mike?

165
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,678
I don't want to get excited about
latents and find out they're yours.

166
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,263
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't?

167
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,556
Mm-mm.

168
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,224
Okay.

169
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:38,353
She usually goes jogging
in the morning, to the Delores Park.

170
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,296
- Hi, Bill.
- Hey, MJ.

171
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,432
- Ruben?
- Yeah?

172
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,768
- This one.
- Okay.

173
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,940
Hi.

174
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,692
- Morning.
- Morning, MJ.

175
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,628
- Hi.
- Wow!

176
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,090
- Uh-huh.
- Pretty wild.

177
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,259
- How you doing?
- Okay.

178
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,178
Got an estimate for me?

179
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,305
- About eight hours.
- Mm-hm.

180
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,059
I'm seeing ligature marks, petechiae.

181
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,727
Strangled, huh?

182
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,729
- Same as the others.
- Yeah.

183
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,607
- Bag all the stuff on the bedside table?
- Yes.

184
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:09,194
Thanks, Bill. Excellent.
That's the only one l need.

185
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,368
Mike?

186
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,911
Yes, ma'am.

187
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,414
- Were you the first one here?
- Yes.

188
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,915
Did you touch anything?

189
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,709
No, ma'am.

190
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,712
What's wrong, Mike?

191
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,130
Nothing.

192
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:32,718
If you're holding out on me,
I'll get it out of you. You know I will.

193
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,014
There was a stocking around her neck
when l found her.

194
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,435
- l don't know what happened to it.
- Hmm.

195
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,855
Who else was in there
before the CSI showed up?

196
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,108
Lieutenant Quinn.

197
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,820
That's all right, then. Thanks, Mike.

198
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:57,117
Celebrating 25 years
of the spirit of the '60s in San Francisco...

199
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,121
...the Festival of Love got underway today
in Golden Gate Park.

200
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,082
- Why did you remove evidence from the--?
- Shh.

201
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,334
I want to hear this.

202
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,336
In Potrero Hill...

203
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:12,674
...homicide detectives discovered
yet another grisly murder today.

204
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,845
Police would not comment, but informed
sources inside the department...

205
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,722
...tell us this latest death...

206
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,643
...could be the work of the same killer
responsible for the deaths of two women.

207
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,229
Susan Schiffer, Potrero Hill.

208
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,148
You messed with the scene.

209
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:32,027
Somebody around here can't keep
his big yap shut, and I'll find out who.

210
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,820
What did you do with the stocking?

211
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,280
I tagged it.

212
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,825
I don't want some blabbermouth
leaking the m.o. to her...

213
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,621
...so she can tell everyone,
leaving us nothing to play.

214
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,708
Am l in charge of this thing or not?

215
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,960
Why are you so prickly?

216
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,881
I ought to be the one deciding
what evidence to sequester, sir.

217
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,966
All right, inspector.

218
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:59,054
Which evidence on this case
would you like to sequester?

219
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:02,682
- The stocking around the neck.
- The stocking around the neck.

220
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,976
God, you're one pushy broad, MJ.

221
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,479
I'll take that as a compliment, sir.

222
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,980
MJ?

223
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,237
I didn't say serial killer,
you didn't say serial killer.

224
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,918
For chrissake.

225
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,753
Again.

226
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,287
George Washington.

227
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,830
John Adams.

228
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,457
Thomas Jefferson.

229
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,251
James Madison.

230
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,712
James Monroe.

231
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,134
Oh, come on, Helen.

232
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,387
John Quincy Adams.

233
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,931
Martin Van Buren.

234
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,163
Idiots!

235
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:55,462
So you followed the girl home.
And then what?

236
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,297
I killed her.

237
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,926
Where did you do that?

238
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,762
It was in the bathtub.

239
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,016
Why did you do that?

240
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,478
She was dirty.

241
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,522
She was a very dirty girl. Very dirty.

242
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,818
So do you remember...

243
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,696
...how many times you stabbed her?

244
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,325
Eighty-seven.

245
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,037
Harvey?

246
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,831
Yeah?

247
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,917
Get the fuck out of here.

248
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,086
I got work to do. Come on.

249
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,464
Come on, let's go. What?

250
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,549
The blood of the innocents
are on these hands.

251
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,136
I understand. That's a terrible thing.
But let me tell you...

252
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,348
...if you come back,
I'll make you stand in the corner again.

253
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,641
Bye, Harvey!

254
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,062
- But innocent blood is on these hands.
- l understand. lt's terrible.

255
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,563
Bye, Harv.

256
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,566
You don't care about the truth.

257
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:03,196
We pay for city government, just like this,
and you never care about the truth.

258
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,447
I killed her!

259
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,075
- I know.
- l killed her in the bathtub.

260
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,743
Goodbye, Harvey.

261
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,996
- Hi.
- Hi. Whew.

262
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,040
Was it something I did in another life?

263
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,127
Probably something you did in this one.

264
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,715
Stuff came in from Mercer.
Medical, dental receipts.

265
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,217
- Nothing in common with the others.
- Ruben.

266
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,302
What is that around your neck?

267
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:31,599
I'd get one like yours, Nikko,
but I don't live near the Kmart.

268
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,227
How about friends, acquaintances?

269
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,398
Uh-uh. The only thing these girls
had in common is they all owned vibrators.

270
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,191
It's a tool of survival.

271
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,028
How can he come to work wearing that?

272
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,529
God. Lay off him.

273
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,489
A cop should look like a cop.

274
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,783
What's the world coming to?

275
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,620
Let me let you talk
to the lead inspector on the case.

276
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,039
Hold on.

277
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,917
MJ, we got Deep Throat again.

278
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,586
How many calls is that, Pach?

279
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:02,630
That makes three today. Fourteen, total.

280
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,258
Phone company set up on our Centrex?

281
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,760
Yeah, this morning.

282
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,262
Have Gigi put a tracer on her ass.

283
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,306
I'll see if it'll work.

284
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,516
Inspector Monahan speaking. Homicide.

285
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,893
Yes, hello.

286
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,854
Ask her about the moon bike.

287
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,523
I'm really interested in your ideas.

288
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,358
The moon bike....

289
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,113
- What is that?
- Moon bike?

290
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,784
I said a "lunar cycle."
I think he might be on a lunar cycle.

291
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,953
Because the first two murders
were 28 days apart.

292
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,330
Still want to crack jokes?

293
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:39,834
No, this is no joke. Neither is tying up
police lines with crank calls.

294
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,711
Are you calling me a crank?

295
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,048
Do you have any evidence to report?
Did you know the victims?

296
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,674
This is number three.

297
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,426
That is an opinion, not evidence.

298
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,387
May I ask who l'm speaking with?

299
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,101
Aah.

300
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,856
Who's Helen Hudson?

301
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,943
Dr. Hudson,
what did you think of his claim...

302
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,028
...that he tied these women to a tree...

303
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,073
...and burned them alive
because Joan of Arc told him to?

304
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,491
He was lying.

305
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,201
How do you know?

306
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,580
People suffering from aural
hallucinations hear voices in both ears.

307
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:18,832
In stereo.

308
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,209
Daryll Lee told me...

309
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,545
...Joan of Arc always appeared
on his left side...

310
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,964
...and spoke softly in his left ear.

311
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,758
Those are the lab results,
hot off the press. No sperm.

312
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,176
Wow.

313
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,220
So we've got a serial.

314
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,180
You didn't say that.

315
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,891
You interviewed Cullum three times.

316
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,602
Who's that?
The woman that got the cop killed?

317
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,104
She might be useful.

318
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:44,399
The woman is a wrong number.
Work the clues, for chrissake.

319
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,650
Sir?

320
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,736
What clues? We don't have any clues.

321
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,489
Nobody here has ever worked
a serial case before.

322
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,491
Whoa, whoa, whoa. l have.

323
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,993
- The Zodiac, right?
- Right.

324
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:58,997
Did anyone ever catch the Zodiac,
or did he die of old age?

325
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,373
What?

326
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,168
Commissioner's on 2,
about the Chinatown thing.

327
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,086
Work the clues.

328
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,050
Only part. l see. But what else?

329
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,012
Mr. Cullum satisfies the rules for sanity...

330
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,347
...in being fully aware
at the time of the murders...

331
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,933
...that his actions were wrong
and unlawful.

332
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,728
Thank you, Dr. Hudson.
No more questions.

333
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,647
You're dead.

334
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,365
- Hello.
- San Francisco Homicide.

335
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,035
I'm lnspector Goetz.
This is lnspector Monahan.

336
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,245
- Yes?
- ls Helen Hudson here?

337
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,414
I'm her assistant. Can I help?

338
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,250
If we could have a few minutes?

339
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,085
Come in.

340
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,592
This way, please.

341
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,806
Dr. Hudson, this is
Inspectors Goetz and Monahan.

342
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,100
He's escaped again, right?

343
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,102
- l'm sorry?
- Well?

344
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,146
Is he out or isn't he?

345
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,315
I'm not following, ma'am.

346
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,817
Let's talk about your phone calls.

347
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,444
Phone calls?

348
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,988
I didn't make any phone calls.

349
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,242
Isn't this nice?

350
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,745
Would everyone like to sit down?
Shall l make coffee?

351
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,497
Get me my stuff.

352
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,207
Joyfully.

353
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:28,795
I talked to you this morning, Dr. Hudson.

354
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,296
Do you remember?

355
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,298
Of course I remember.

356
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:35,927
There's nothing wrong with my memory.
You called me a crank.

357
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,097
- Yes, ma'am.
- l suppose I am.

358
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,599
I got a couple of crank calls myself.

359
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:45,061
That's why I thought
Daryll Lee Cullum was out of prison.

360
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:49,148
If Daryll Lee had gotten out,
you'd be the first to know.

361
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,318
Well, good. l'm relieved.

362
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:56,030
l hate to sound like
a broken record, but you called us.

363
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,365
Yes.

364
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,452
- l did. I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
- Why?

365
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,124
There's a serial killer out there who's
strangled three women. He'll do it again.

366
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:10,336
lf there's evidence connecting these
murders, nothing's been reported.

367
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,339
- How do you connect them?
- l don't know.

368
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:18,136
Twenty years of clinical experience
and having serial killers on the brain.

369
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,847
Would you work with us on this?

370
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,183
You're kidding, right?

371
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,019
No, ma'am.

372
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:31,316
I thought you knew
that I don't do this anymore.

373
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,650
I'm retired.

374
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,321
Is that why you called us 14 times?
Because you're retired?

375
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,906
Help me out. l really admire your work.

376
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,825
Does she do this...

377
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,244
...wide-eyed-little-girl routine often?

378
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,163
Yeah.

379
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,081
Does it work?

380
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,167
- Usually.
- Sometimes.

381
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,003
You can spare me the bullshit.

382
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,673
You don't admire me or like me.
None of your people do.

383
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,844
But the thing is, l don't give a fuck!
That's the upside of a nervous breakdown.

384
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,389
If you don't mind,
I have a very busy day.

385
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,769
Well, ma'am, it's a hell
of an apartment you got here.

386
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,312
I guess...

387
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,398
...the books you wrote
about these scumbags paid well.

388
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,401
Now, we can't afford to pay you...

389
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:16,903
...your usual fee...

390
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:20,490
...but if you'd be so kind as to look....

391
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,867
I don't want these here.

392
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,079
- Would you be comfortable downtown?
- l don't want to see these here.

393
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,456
- l'll drive you, if you prefer.
- Andy?

394
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,126
Andy? Andy!

395
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,505
- Andy! Andy!
- What's wrong?

396
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:41,135
lt's all right. It's okay.
Just breathe. l'm here. Breathe.

397
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,138
- Should we call the paramedics?
- No.

398
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,474
It's just a good, old-fashioned
panic attack.

399
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:50,561
She hyperventilates till she faints, then her
breathing gets normal and she's fine.

400
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,772
- What did we do?
- She's agoraphobic.

401
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,149
She's afraid of spiders too?

402
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,443
She hasn't left home in over a year.

403
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:58,820
She's okay?

404
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,781
She's fine. ln half an hour,
she'll be singing.

405
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,574
Tell her...

406
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,660
...we're sorry we bothered her.

407
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,746
Did you want her to look at those?

408
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,415
If you do, leave them.

409
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,792
I'll make sure they're safe.

410
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,627
Tell her to call me...

411
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,504
...if she feels like it.

412
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,681
That one is a strange ranger.

413
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,976
Quinn said she was a crackpot.

414
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:34,021
He forgot to mention
pill-popping juicehead...

415
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,024
...hyperventilating, agoraphobic asshole.

416
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,653
I thought she was sweet.

417
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,655
Ruben!

418
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,449
Honest to God!

419
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,139
Are they gone?

420
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,141
All gone.

421
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,851
Oh, God!

422
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,979
I must have looked like such an asshole.

423
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:16,814
No, no.

424
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,733
You look good with a bag on your head.

425
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:20,151
Oh, God.

426
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,694
I want to die.

427
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:22,945
I wouldn't.

428
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,530
He'll be back.

429
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,073
Who'll be back?

430
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,409
Don't be coy.

431
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,745
You thought he was cute too.

432
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:33,289
- No, I didn't. l did not.
- Didn't you?

433
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:38,002
You like those cute, brutal types
with the eyebrows and the handcuffs.

434
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,380
Admit it.

435
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,219
- Oh, God.
- What? What'd l say?

436
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,595
Nothing.

437
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,764
I miss men.

438
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,933
Yeah? And what am I?

439
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,684
You know what l mean.

440
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,103
I miss sex.

441
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,901
He was pretty cute.

442
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,903
Yes, he was very cute.

443
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,450
Okay, no young cops for you.

444
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:14,747
Come on. Up you go. Sit over here.
Look at these pictures.

445
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,249
Why are these here?

446
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,750
I'll get you some coffee.

447
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,127
Andy, l can't.

448
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,588
Why don't you just die, then?

449
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:27,802
They'll find you years from now amongst
unopened mail and unread newspapers.

450
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:32,431
Yeah, the old hermit lady.
She lived on cat food and Camembert.

451
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,226
She used to be
a really good shrink once.

452
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,145
Make up your mind. Here's your coffee.

453
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,939
Live or die.

454
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,536
Andy?

455
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,561
You scared me.

456
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,105
Burning the midnight oil?

457
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,109
This stuff never gets any easier.

458
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:38,362
Yeah. That's why they pay us
the small bucks.

459
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,114
Hey, listen.

460
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,911
Do you...?

461
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,085
What would you think if...

462
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:56,130
...when you're finished here
we go to Joe's and we...

463
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:59,174
...have a steak and....

464
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,012
I don't think so.

465
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,890
Thanks anyway.

466
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:10,811
What? You got other plans?
Not that it's any of my business....

467
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,898
You got that right.

468
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,442
Bean curd, smoked-eel sushi.

469
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,818
Oh, Nikko.

470
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,863
We got prawn tempura, seaweed salad.
You want to join us?

471
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,449
You kiss your mother after eating that?

472
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,659
No. I can kiss you, if you like.

473
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,119
Go fuck yourself.

474
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,545
Who put the bug up his ass?

475
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,255
Where's my cheeseburger?

476
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,299
I made an executive decision.

477
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,426
Japanese.

478
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,429
It's better for your heart.

479
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,265
Ruben? Ruben?

480
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,143
You didn't even get french fries.
You're pissing me off.

481
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,020
Here, here.

482
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,939
Any word from...

483
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,858
...Helen "Put a Bag Over My Head"
Hudson?

484
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,027
Not yet, but there will be.

485
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,278
No way.

486
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,822
Five bucks she's going to call tonight.

487
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:05,699
Deal.

488
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,120
Wait a minute.

489
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,124
What's this Quarter Pounder
with cheese doing here?

490
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:28,555
Homicide.

491
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,557
Inspector Monahan, please.

492
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:34,019
These three are
the work of the same man.

493
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,896
This one is different.

494
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,856
Are you testing me?

495
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:41,652
Well, not exactly.
We had reason to believe....

496
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,737
I have to take tests now?

497
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:47,950
Ongoing case?

498
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,827
Six months.

499
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,538
The scene is disorganized.

500
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:56,458
The killer lives nearby.
He would've been too disoriented to drive.

501
00:38:56,626 --> 00:39:00,754
One is
a mental patient, the other is a boyfriend.

502
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,590
Someone who was denied sex
on this occasion...

503
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,342
...who knew and cared about her.

504
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,802
He beat the shit out of her.

505
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,595
But he felt remorse.

506
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:12,516
He covered her up afterward,
because he felt conflicted.

507
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,394
Not like this man.

508
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:19,606
These are the work of someone
who is not conflicted at all.

509
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,151
He's doing exactly what he wants to do.

510
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,569
Highly organized.

511
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,905
I'll bet there were no prints,
no stains, no blood. Right?

512
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,324
- Right.
- No sign of forced entry.

513
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,076
He probably conned his way in.

514
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,079
These may or may not be about sex...

515
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,789
...but they're about power.

516
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,959
See the multiple thumbprints
along the throat?

517
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,711
Was the hyoid bone broken?

518
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,463
Yes, it was.

519
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,216
He strangles them face to face,
so they can see his power...

520
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,927
...and he can watch their terror.
That gets him off.

521
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,138
Then he revives them and does it again.

522
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:56,143
Look for an intelligent white male,
20 to 30 years old, socially functional...

523
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:59,605
...with a major interest in golden oldies.

524
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,902
Did I pass?

525
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,863
You passed.
What do you mean by "golden oldies"?

526
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,076
Where's the stocking
that was tied around this one's neck?

527
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,827
How'd you know that?

528
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,789
I mean, l assume it was a stocking
and not pantyhose...

529
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,832
...tied in a big loopy bow...

530
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,417
...like this one, right?

531
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,003
Right.

532
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,923
For goodness sakes,
it's the Boston Strangler.

533
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:30,385
He's imitating Albert DeSalvo's
crime scene down to the kinky details.

534
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,680
This guy's copycatting a serial killer
who's been dead for....

535
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,015
Twenty years.

536
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,768
Why DeSalvo? Why not somebody
in the news recently?

537
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,895
Gacy or Ramirez?

538
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,480
I don't know.

539
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,274
I mean, these guys are like viruses.

540
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,944
There's always some new mutation.

541
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:54,827
Tears are running down your breast

542
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,872
And your friends

543
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,168
Treat you like a guest

544
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,548
Don't you want somebody to love?

545
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,216
Hi. Heh.

546
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:28,443
The commissioner is up my ass,
saying we could use help here.

547
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,780
We could use help.
We need their VICAP, we need their...

548
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,158
- ...database thingies.
- Yeah, yeah.

549
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,910
The FBI will bury you with fucking help.

550
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,370
During Patty Hearst...

551
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:42,416
...some snot-nose with a crew cut
took over my office for a month.

552
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,960
So you're saying...?

553
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,171
I'm saying, if you need help...

554
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,340
...Nikko is almost through
with the Chinatown thing.

555
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,467
That really won't be necessary, sir.

556
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,387
Join us. We need you.

557
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,556
Anyone with a similar profile
to the Strangler.

558
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,142
Or with a German wife.
Can you do that?

559
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,686
Anyone who wears green pants....

560
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,229
The files in from Boston, yet?

561
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,398
Should be here tomorrow.

562
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,442
Nikko, what are you up to?

563
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,735
Going to Chinatown.

564
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,945
Sit in on this for a minute.

565
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,075
Pach, what do you got?

566
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,718
Winning?

567
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,428
I'm pulverizing him.

568
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,305
All right, l'm off, then.

569
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,140
- See you.
- Have a good time.

570
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,559
I won't wait up.

571
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,104
Ha!

572
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,564
I got you.

573
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,400
She's next.

574
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,735
How do you know?

575
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,070
Because l watched
her face change to that.

576
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,031
- Did you try to play it back?
- No.

577
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,657
How did he send this to you?

578
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,576
He's hacked into her lnternet address.

579
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,161
Can we trace it?

580
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,997
- Only if he's online right now.
- He ain't.

581
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,665
Can we rewind or...?

582
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,252
Yeah, we should be able to play it back.

583
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,796
- How long is the program?
- Thirty seconds.

584
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:38,342
- Can we get a copy of that face?
- No, it's too big a file.

585
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,719
- Huh?
- Back up to tape.

586
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:45,474
She's got a tape backup.
We can make a copy and take it with us.

587
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,726
How do you know about all this?

588
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:51,021
Misspent youth in video arcades,
I guess.

589
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,106
A lot of quarters.

590
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,027
Why would he send this to you?

591
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,236
Why do you think?

592
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,863
No one mentioned your involvement.

593
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,824
There is no involvement. l'm not involved!

594
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,744
This is a game they play.
They hang around watching the cops...

595
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,245
...feeling superior to them.

596
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,664
Instead of catching him,
you led him to me.

597
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,125
He didn't write to me,
he wrote to you. Why?

598
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,211
Because I'm their damn pinup girl.

599
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:18,173
They all know me. They have libraries.
They collect clippings.

600
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,258
I'm the fucking muse of serial killers.

601
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:22,594
Holy shit.

602
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,554
What the...?

603
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,436
- No.
- Yeah.

604
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,146
Excuse me.

605
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,025
Christ.

606
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,070
Try the C drive too.

607
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,114
Any other suggestions?

608
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,283
It's gone. The file is not here.

609
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,954
It's not on C drive, and it's not in List.
The utilities aren't retrieving it.

610
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:51,415
You think he put a virus in there?

611
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,500
- Yeah.
- What exactly is...?

612
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:56,753
He wrote a virus into the program.
You try to copy it, it's erased.

613
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:57,963
He booby-trapped it!

614
00:45:58,131 --> 00:45:59,840
I gotta hand it to the guy.

615
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,760
- He's a smart motherfucker.
- Do you remember what she looked like?

616
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,846
Yes.

617
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,848
She looked like a girl.

618
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,851
She looked like a million other girls.

619
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,853
Okay?

620
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,312
I barely saw her.

621
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,113
I'm going to the office to get
a systems guy on this. Maybe Marty.

622
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,489
Or Mercer.

623
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:25,699
What are you doing?

624
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,117
Unplugging this.

625
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,036
It's an open window.
He can crawl in any time he likes.

626
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:34,207
He comes in, we grab him.
It's the only lead we've got.

627
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:35,625
And what am I?

628
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,752
The lamb tied to the stake?

629
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,465
You don't get it. This is the only space
that I have in the world.

630
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,217
- You're not gonna get it.
- l'll get a guard here.

631
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,219
I don't want a fucking guard here!

632
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,512
All right. Hey.

633
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,931
- We're all working together.
- l'm not.

634
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,851
- l'm not working with anybody.
- This is what we'll do.

635
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:57,481
Turn the monitor back on and I'll stay
until we figure out what's happening.

636
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,567
- Go on.
- Catch you later.

637
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,277
All right?

638
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,363
Heil Hitler.

639
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:19,127
I don't think he's gonna send us
anything else tonight. He's too busy.

640
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,837
Yeah.

641
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:24,716
You want a drink?

642
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:26,551
No, thank you.

643
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,136
Always on duty?

644
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,514
Always.

645
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,099
So...

646
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:37,771
...what about you
and the wee inspector?

647
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,233
What about us?

648
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,364
Are you?

649
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,783
We're partners.

650
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:52,786
Partners? In every way?

651
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:54,788
Not yet.

652
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,875
Self-confident.

653
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,504
Actually, I'm shy...

654
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:03,797
...selective.

655
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,007
The trouble is I'm....

656
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,761
I'm finding myself....

657
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:13,932
Well, you're in the witness category,
you see.

658
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:24,943
Well....

659
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,114
In better times, maybe.

660
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,575
Yeah.

661
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:40,917
Peter! Peter!

662
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,463
I've been calling and calling.
Didn't you hear me?

663
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,342
You completely forgot about me.

664
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:52,345
Very thirsty, weren't you,
my little sweetie?

665
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,306
Come on.

666
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,016
Are you teasing me?

667
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,851
Naughty little boy.

668
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,605
What are you doing?
Want to watch Letterman with me?

669
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,024
Well, l could, but--

670
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,359
I don't watch talk shows on my own.

671
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,819
I know.

672
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,113
It's just-- I'm right--

673
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,531
Oh, go on.

674
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,908
Go back to your silly little computers.

675
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,453
Thanks.

676
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,581
Haven't you forgotten something?

677
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,804
I love you.

678
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,765
Yeah, me too.

679
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,425
Uh-oh.

680
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,220
Looks like you're in a bit of trouble.

681
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,638
Okay.

682
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,099
I'm going to place my hand...

683
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,475
...right here.

684
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,855
Okay. l'm gonna put my elbow right here.

685
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:09,607
And just...

686
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,820
...cut a little hole.

687
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,074
There, now.

688
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,577
Didn't l say l'd take care of you?

689
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,955
Goodness. You're so hot.

690
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:31,921
Now, this is gonna hurt a little bit,
I'm afraid.

691
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,758
They claim they didn't see anything.

692
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,094
You received a call from dispatch
at 6:35 a.m.?

693
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:42,348
Correct. 6:35. The first unit arrived
about 15 minutes later.

694
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,516
Great.

695
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,852
Did you isolate the kids
who found her?

696
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,772
Yes, they're over on the side
of the hill.

697
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,482
How many of you knew her?

698
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,317
We just danced with her.

699
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:53,651
Really?

700
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,862
You just met her tonight?

701
00:51:57,031 --> 00:52:00,366
Uh-huh. Excuse me. Good afternoon.

702
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,537
Did you stand too far
from your razor this morning?

703
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:07,040
- Good morning.
- l was up all night with a sick friend.

704
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,375
- l want to talk to you.
- What?

705
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,545
Have you got a thing going
with MJ now?

706
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,215
- l don't believe it.
- You don't believe it?

707
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,717
Good God, man, you stink.

708
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,804
Heavy date last night?
Are you screwing around on her already?

709
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,555
What's wrong with you?

710
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:26,434
Me? l'll tell you something,
you just treat her right, okay?

711
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:30,313
Don't go screwing around on her.
She doesn't deserve that.

712
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:34,025
Nikko, remind me again
why she dumped you.

713
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,990
Why is he here?

714
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,660
What do you see?
Tell me what you see.

715
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:49,082
There are stains.
So she's been sexually assaulted.

716
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:53,169
No defense wounds. No ligature marks
or bruising, like the others.

717
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,546
Very cyanotic.

718
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,172
Asphyxiation, huh?

719
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,092
- Doesn't look like our guy.
- You don't think so?

720
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,969
- No.
- Look at her heels.

721
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:03,930
There's abrasions, but no bleeding.

722
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,932
- She's been dragged up here postmortem.
- Maybe.

723
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,185
On this stuff we're not gonna get
any prints or tracks.

724
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:10,895
Ooh. Long night?

725
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:13,398
- Don't you start.
- What about her arms?

726
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,236
Yeah. There's needle marks, all right.

727
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:20,655
Not tracks. Not a regular user.

728
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,116
Probably so stoned,
she never knew what got her.

729
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:24,492
Hope so.

730
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,786
A lot of little hippie girls.

731
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,874
They all want to make love.
They all want to be beautiful.

732
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,709
That's your type, right, Ruben?

733
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,712
What are you doing?

734
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,589
Want to be on the 6:00 news?

735
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,425
Go down and finish taking statements.

736
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:50,643
Let's get out of here.

737
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,989
I know. They found another one.

738
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,325
What? Ruben told you already?

739
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,327
No, I heard it on my scanner.

740
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,663
- Can l use your phone?
- Sure.

741
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,750
They want you to call the office?
Your phone is busted.

742
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:15,501
You're some piece of work.

743
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,796
I turned that damn scanner off,
but then l turned it on again.

744
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:23,092
I can't listen to it, but I can't
not listen to it. So I make Andy do it.

745
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,096
Are you on medication?
I need your whole brain on duty.

746
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,432
Well, l'm not on duty.

747
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,267
Neither is my brain.

748
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,187
Everything is different. Different guy.

749
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,357
She was asphyxiated, not strangled...

750
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,318
...dumped outdoors, sexually assaulted.

751
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,987
So nothing like DeSalvo.

752
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:44,989
Completely different.

753
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,034
Monahan. Messages, please.

754
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,161
So why do you need me?

755
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,121
I think I'm wrong...

756
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,708
...because there was something
artificial about it.

757
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,294
Like posed. She was on display.

758
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:02,423
Why drag a body
all the way up a hill, a huge hill...

759
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:04,759
...where it will be found by tourists?

760
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,470
You think he's changed his routine?

761
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,055
That doesn't happen.

762
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:11,391
Hello? Yes, no. Monahan.

763
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,351
These men are robotic.

764
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,230
The murder's a ritual.
The method is part of the pleasure.

765
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:19,107
Why is that computer turned off?

766
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,526
Because I turned it off.

767
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:23,152
You can't do that.

768
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,321
I believe l can.

769
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:28,741
- But would you like me to turn it back on?
- Yeah.

770
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:31,911
Okay. Thanks.

771
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:35,248
Hello, Ruben.

772
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:38,960
Please thank lnspector Goetz
for taking care of me last night.

773
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,840
Dr. Hudson wants me to thank you
for taking care of her last night.

774
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,467
Uh-huh.

775
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,057
Lab results on the new one.

776
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,269
Two kinds of sperm.

777
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,564
Well, l guess it's...

778
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:01,482
...a gang thing.

779
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,486
Thanks for the use of your phone.

780
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,289
There were two kinds of sperm?

781
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:22,295
They said one was a secretor,
the other was not?

782
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,006
How'd you know about that?

783
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:27,133
There were needle marks?

784
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:32,805
On her right arm?

785
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,225
So far, nothing they test for
comes out positive.

786
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:39,020
Was the body found
near a "No Dumping" sign?

787
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:40,229
Yes.

788
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,273
Like this?

789
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,819
I could've taken that picture.

790
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,529
Shit. He switched.

791
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,699
From DeSalvo to Bianchi
and Buono. The Hillside Strangler.

792
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:54,869
Two men. Two kinds of sperm.
Very witty, our guy.

793
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,413
You said that they're like robots--

794
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,666
Yeah, but "consistency
is the hobgoblin of small minds."

795
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:04,670
Tell them to test for chemicals found
- ammonia, ethanol....

796
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,965
- l know window cleaner.
- lt's what they injected into a victim.

797
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,718
Why these guys? Why in such detail?

798
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,596
He wants to dazzle us.

799
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,891
Anyone can strangle someone
in a bathtub, right?

800
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,935
He's saying, "Look out.

801
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,187
"I'm just getting started."

802
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:22,814
ln San Francisco...

803
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,650
...the mutilated body of an unidentified
young woman was discovered.

804
00:57:25,818 --> 00:57:27,610
Police have yet to comment
on the slaying...

805
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:31,656
...which is the fourth such body
to be found in the last six weeks.

806
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,408
Reporting live is Susan Schiffer.

807
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:38,663
In response to growing alarm,
a special task force is being set up...

808
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:40,832
...inside the police department.

809
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:45,169
Aiding the police is noted
criminal psychologist, Dr. Helen Hudson.

810
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:49,298
It was her expert testimony that
sent Daryll Lee Cullum to death row...

811
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,092
...for the murders of two young women.

812
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,346
Cullum later escaped and attacked
Dr. Hudson, killing a police officer.

813
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:59,725
Meanwhile, schoolyards are empty,
college campuses are deserted...

814
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:03,104
...and a terrified city locks its doors.

815
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,530
Hey, little darling.
Full service is available.

816
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,073
Want me to check your oil?

817
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,010
Oh, hi. Sorry.

818
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,470
I'm a little lost. Can you help me out?

819
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,598
Um, sure.

820
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,144
Thanks.

821
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:45,730
We have a white female, early 20s...

822
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:47,231
...found deceased in vehicle.

823
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,401
Gunshot trauma to head.
Request CSU forensics and coroner.

824
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:51,819
Backup is requested.

825
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,447
Gotcha.

826
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:55,865
It's a beauty.

827
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,200
Great.

828
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,452
I'll look at it in a sec.

829
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,460
The tape is there for a purpose, sir.

830
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,255
You thought you heard a backfire?
Where were you?

831
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,925
I was just waiting to cross the street,
going east.

832
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:16,886
Excuse me.

833
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:20,431
- Yeah?
- Hi, it's me, Helen.

834
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,308
Look, this isn't a good time.

835
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:25,102
It's a woman shot in a car, right?

836
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,438
No, it looks like a drive-by.

837
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:30,733
She's in a parked car, shot in the head,
no sexual assault.

838
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,443
Which side was she on?

839
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,821
- Look, I really got to--
- Was it the passenger side?

840
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:36,989
Yeah.

841
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,741
Was the tape player on?

842
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,285
I don't know. Was the tape player on
when you got here?

843
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:44,830
Yeah, it was. lt was driving me crazy,
so l shut it off.

844
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,332
You shut it off? Really?

845
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,918
Okay. Switch it on, would you?

846
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,046
It's still warm.

847
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:55,007
Don't laugh, but l think it might be
the Partridge Family.

848
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:58,010
Okay. You mind putting
the tape player on?

849
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:01,472
Helen thinks it might be
the Partridge Family.

850
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,187
I think I love you

851
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:09,939
Ruben, don't hang up.

852
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:11,941
Is there a gas station nearby?

853
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,819
- Yeah.
- With a phone booth?

854
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:16,696
- Uh-huh.
- Go look for a note.

855
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:18,572
Okay.

856
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,992
Here. l got to go check the pay phone.

857
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,645
It's Berkowitz, isn't it?

858
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:53,107
He's doing Son of Sam.

859
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:57,737
She was sitting in a parked car
when she was shot with a .44.

860
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,655
Look in the crowd.

861
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:02,074
Berkowitz liked to watch the cops work.

862
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:50,414
Helen, we found a note.

863
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:53,876
It says, "Police, let me haunt you
- I'll be back."

864
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,211
It's to Helen.

865
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:56,921
I'm going over there.

866
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:02,385
I know it's kind of late, but Ruben's
gonna drop by with a couple questions.

867
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,429
Look, l gotta go, so l'll see you later.

868
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,772
Inspector Monahan, Homicide.

869
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,233
Copy, go ahead.

870
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:21,070
I need a 1 0-25 to Pier One, Fort Mason.

871
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,614
Approach Code 2. Wait for instructions.

872
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:26,283
Alert the officer on security duty there.

873
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,412
Why do they put
these stupid alarms in cars?

874
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,621
Just pull it.

875
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:59,400
Just steal the car and go.

876
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:18,711
Burt?

877
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:15,601
John Madison.

878
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:18,979
Thomas Jeffer--

879
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,702
He knows what he's doing.

880
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,872
- I think l've got it.
- That one right there.

881
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,618
Shit!

882
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:42,081
I'll deal with you later, asshole.
Helen!

883
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:45,042
- Helen!
- You must think l'm a moron!

884
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:48,587
Until we know different,
I say the guy's just a junkie.

885
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:49,838
A junkie?

886
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:54,176
In a full-on SWAT suit?
Ruben, you're such a lousy liar.

887
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,719
Are you sure nothing's missing?

888
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:59,014
Yes, there is! The cop who was supposed
to be at my door!

889
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:00,224
Where was he?

890
01:07:00,392 --> 01:07:02,351
He screwed up. That's not the point.

891
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:06,271
It is! You dragged me into this,
you're supposed to protect me.

892
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:07,564
What are you doing?

893
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:10,025
I'm checking the bed! Okay?

894
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:13,070
That man is in and out of here
when he feels like it!

895
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:15,698
We got here as quickly
as we could, okay?

896
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,366
Fortunately we got here--

897
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:22,413
Why is that? Why did you come
to my rescue so fortuitously, huh?

898
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,332
What?

899
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:32,506
There was a note, wasn't there?
At the gas station.

900
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,466
I was right. What'd it say?

901
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:41,056
You think the guy's been in here before?
You said he comes when he feels like it.

902
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:42,725
I don't know.

903
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,353
Somebody came and messed
with my clothes.

904
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,189
And they put this red suit of mine
on the bed.

905
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:50,816
Anything special about it?

906
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:53,277
It was the one that I was wearing...

907
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:54,903
...at the lecture hall.

908
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,531
Oh. Why didn't you report this?

909
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,158
I didn't know.

910
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:02,870
I thought it was me, you know? l just--

911
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:06,123
I had taken a lot of pills
and l had been drinking.

912
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:10,169
I just didn't know.
I wasn't sure then, but l am now!

913
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,672
So stop pretending to me
that it's a burglar!

914
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:18,469
Stop treating me like l'm some
fucking idiot! Just tell me the truth!

915
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,054
Okay.

916
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,851
I think the man who has killed
five women in this city...

917
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,770
...was just in your apartment.

918
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,605
I don't know why.

919
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:33,942
But l do know he has a plan,
and you seem to be a part of it.

920
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:41,784
The truth is he's very smart,
and he's way ahead of us.

921
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:46,497
And l take it your moving is
out of the question?

922
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:48,957
No, thank you.

923
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,126
So all l know to do...

924
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:55,047
...is run the usual checks,
change your locks, tighten up security...

925
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:56,507
...and pray.

926
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:00,677
Feel better?

927
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:04,973
No.

928
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,602
But l appreciate your candor.

929
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:15,734
So when do I get to see this note?

930
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:20,280
Once that you've decided on a killing

931
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,628
Then you can turn a murder into art

932
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:40,259
There really isn't any need for bloodshed

933
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:44,638
You just do it with a little more finesse

934
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:50,644
If you can slip that tablet
lnto someone's coffee

935
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:54,690
Then it avoids an awful lot of mess

936
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:58,402
Because it's murder by numbers

937
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:00,487
One, two, three

938
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,781
It's as easy to learn

939
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:05,534
As your A-B-Cs

940
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,495
It's murder by numbers

941
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:10,497
One, two, three

942
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:13,792
It's as easy to learn as your--

943
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:16,879
Good morning, commissioner.

944
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,714
Good morning.

945
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,966
"Murder By Numbers," by The Police.

946
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:25,596
Obviously, the killer wants us to hear
this song for reasons other than...

947
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,472
...music appreciation.

948
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,766
Familiarize yourselves with the lyrics.

949
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:33,061
We need to figure out
what this guy's trying to tell us.

950
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:36,231
I think that about covers it.
Anything else?

951
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:37,858
Yes, inspector?

952
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:40,986
We're set up on Helen's phone line
so we can monitor calls...

953
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:44,072
- ...and anything coming to her modem?
- Yes, sir.

954
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,867
Questions? Commissioner?

955
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,040
There we go. Yes, that was it.

956
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:04,217
He is not a happy camper.

957
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,595
- The Hudson broad.
- What about her?

958
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:12,309
The commissioner thinks, and I agree,
that she's leaking like a rusty bucket.

959
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,520
Maybe she's trying to hype her new book.
I don't know.

960
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:18,899
She's just not reliable.
Especially after lunch.

961
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,778
She's the one person who has been
really useful to us on this case.

962
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:26,323
I do not want you discussing
this case with her...

963
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,742
...in any shape, way or form.

964
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:31,453
- Do l make myself clear?
- Crystal, sir.

965
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:47,970
Did that help any?

966
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,514
You don't feel fear, do you?

967
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:55,310
One of those people who thinks
everything happens for a reason.

968
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,270
And we're all "God's chillun."

969
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,438
How nice.

970
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:01,483
I put my ass on the line
to bring you that letter.

971
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,486
Are you gonna help me out or not?

972
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,200
"Helen, don't lose your head."

973
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,286
So we're on a first-name basis.

974
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:17,624
Is it a threat?
Does he want to cut off my head?

975
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,293
Dahmer cut off heads.

976
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:22,087
Kemper.

977
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:24,589
I think Rifkin did.

978
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:27,551
I'm sorry. It's difficult.

979
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:29,594
It's okay. Take your time.

980
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,936
"First you make a stone of your heart."

981
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:40,772
dissociation.

982
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:44,651
He's saying he's suffered.
Now it's our turn.

983
01:12:46,154 --> 01:12:47,612
What made a stone of his heart?

984
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,991
Usually it's rejection or humiliation
by a parent.

985
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,577
Gacy's father beat him for fun.

986
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:57,873
Kemper's mother locked him up
in a cellar when he reached puberty.

987
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:00,125
Something happened to this one.

988
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,586
Are these his first killings?

989
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:04,046
I think they are.

990
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,131
But he's thought about them.

991
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,593
This guy's copycatting.

992
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,678
He wants what those killers got.

993
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:14,514
Fame, the power to terrify us....

994
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:19,061
To take whoever, whatever he wants
without saying "please."

995
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:25,609
"And if you find that your hands
are still willing, you can turn murder...

996
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:27,569
...into art."

997
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:30,322
He wants us to think
what he's doing is art.

998
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:33,492
We're looking for someone
desperate for acceptance.

999
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,244
Probably has a fair academic record.

1000
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,705
And l think has a technical job.

1001
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:42,501
Something that demands
a certain precision.

1002
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:13,949
"Flushed with your very first success...

1003
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,576
...you must try a twosome
or a threesome...

1004
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:20,122
...and you'll find your conscience
bothers you much less."

1005
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,998
A gruesome twosome.

1006
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,959
Kemper did two in one day.

1007
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,794
Bundy at Chi Omega did three.

1008
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:30,590
Boston Strangler, Hillside Strangler....
Does the order mean anything?

1009
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:33,885
It's not chronological.
Son of Sam was before Hillside.

1010
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,680
He's sending you letters
like he's daring us to nail him.

1011
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:39,349
If he wants to be famous,
he has to be caught.

1012
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,518
So you can write a book about him.

1013
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:07,711
Ick.

1014
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,836
Good grief.

1015
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,904
- Thanks, Mike. Stick around, okay?
- Sure thing.

1016
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:03,451
It's lousy, but it's hot.

1017
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:06,830
- Thank you.
- Are you all right?

1018
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:08,123
Sure.

1019
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:12,252
- Yeah, Pach?
- He burnt the print off the finger.

1020
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:14,045
What a surprise.

1021
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,506
But he used it as a bookmark.

1022
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:19,175
The chapter where
Daryll attacks the good doctor.

1023
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:23,305
We know that Mr. Cullum was safe
in San Quentin last night, so...

1024
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,348
...why did this book
show up under the mattress?

1025
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:27,767
I'll call you one better.

1026
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,479
It's personally autographed.

1027
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:34,232
"Hey, doc, hope you like the book.

1028
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,485
Love and sloppy kisses,
Daryll Lee Cullum."

1029
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,529
That's cuddly.

1030
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,282
- Thanks, Pach.
- Yeah.

1031
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,409
Helen.

1032
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:46,703
Helen.

1033
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:48,788
I know what you're gonna say.

1034
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,083
I'll do the talking.

1035
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:58,923
- Hey, warden. How you doing?
- Hey, Daryll Lee.

1036
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:03,803
Daryll Lee, I want you to look
into this little camera here.

1037
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,723
Then I want you to speak
into this microphone.

1038
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:09,017
She gonna see me through that?

1039
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:13,188
- How she gonna hear me?
- Speak into the microphone.

1040
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:14,814
Hello?

1041
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,274
Hey, doc.

1042
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:17,776
Woohoo!

1043
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:22,489
I'm lnspector Monahan.
I'll be speaking for Dr. Hudson.

1044
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:24,199
Uh-uh. l'm hanging up.

1045
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:26,117
I ain't talking to a cop.

1046
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:29,579
Dr. Hudson just got your book.
Do you know anything about it?

1047
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:31,831
Yeah, l surely do...

1048
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:35,710
...but that's all I'll say till that foxy lady
gets on the horn.

1049
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,879
Put her on.

1050
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:42,467
Hello, Mr. Cullum.

1051
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:44,010
Doc!

1052
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,138
I've been expecting your call.

1053
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,933
From one author to another,
how'd you like my book?

1054
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:52,310
What do you know
about the man who delivered it?

1055
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:55,105
Peter Kurten? What about him?

1056
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:57,357
- Peter Kurten?
- Yeah.

1057
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:04,572
Peter Kurten is the name of a serial killer
from the '30s in Germany.

1058
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,158
l'll be damned, he took that man's name.

1059
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:09,661
He bothering you?

1060
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:12,914
He broke into my apartment
to leave your book.

1061
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,833
Kind of a hand-delivery?

1062
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,543
Did you put him up to it?

1063
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,796
Doc, this Kurten guy,
he's been writing me all these letters.

1064
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:22,507
I figured he owed me
a couple of favors.

1065
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:26,511
So I sent a book with him to your house.
I didn't think he'd break in.

1066
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:29,347
Steer clear of that son of a gun.
He's a freak.

1067
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:34,602
He told me he's gonna send me
$500 for some of my....

1068
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:38,148
- My spirit.
- Spirit?

1069
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:41,526
He said that he can make me immortal
if he had some of my spirit.

1070
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:43,445
You know what l'm saying?

1071
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:46,364
This is kind of embarrassing.

1072
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:49,617
I don't want to say it right out
in front of a lady.

1073
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:53,329
I think I know what you're referring to.
What did you do about it?

1074
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:56,166
I took some liquid soap,
put it in a sandwich baggie...

1075
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:59,210
...with a message from Jesus
to mend his ways.

1076
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:01,504
How will you contact Kurten?

1077
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:06,009
Buddy of mine got paroled.
I'll send the baggie with him.

1078
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:07,802
Kurten will hook up with him.

1079
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,388
- When and where?
- Do you know when and where?

1080
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:12,223
All depends, doc.

1081
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:13,725
Depends on what?

1082
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:17,896
You see, it gets awful lonesome
in here, doc.

1083
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:20,523
I think about you all the time.

1084
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,277
A personal token would be nice.

1085
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,321
Let's see.

1086
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:27,489
Something...

1087
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:29,365
...feminine...

1088
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:33,411
...something lacy, something frilly,
something pretty.

1089
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:35,205
I got it.

1090
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:39,125
Send me some of your squirrel covers.

1091
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,586
I beg your pardon?

1092
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:44,047
"l beg your pardon?"

1093
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:45,757
Your panties.

1094
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:48,843
You wear them, don't you?
That's what l want.

1095
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:51,471
- Jesus.
- I want them autographed to me personally.

1096
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:53,556
Daryll Lee Cullum. Deal?

1097
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:55,183
That's a promise.

1098
01:20:55,351 --> 01:21:01,105
My buddy's meeting Peter tonight at 10:00
at the Danver Meat Packing Company.

1099
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:06,694
Doc.

1100
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,280
How's life?

1101
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:10,615
Hey, Ruben...

1102
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:13,660
...how'd you like to get off
the Chinatown detail?

1103
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:17,205
We have a lead.
I think we can get this guy.

1104
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,207
Yeah, l'll be right down.

1105
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,835
That's why you gotta talk to me...

1106
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,630
...because Jesus kept you alive
for a reason.

1107
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:28,383
He knew Satan was in my heart,
raising my hand to kill you.

1108
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:32,011
And Satan knew l had a good six,
seven years of appeals...

1109
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:35,390
...before they'd drop
them cyanide tablets.

1110
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:37,267
And l'm just like Jesus.

1111
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:40,228
I got disciples too.

1112
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:46,276
They're dying to do whatever l ask them,
as long as I just say the word, doc.

1113
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:50,196
I'm death and life to you, doc.

1114
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,324
Death and life.

1115
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,249
Help me out.

1116
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:04,627
- l speak Mandarin. They're Cantonese.
- How can I get a statement?

1117
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:06,629
I wish I could help you out.

1118
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:09,132
I'll do anything you want.

1119
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:11,759
Here you go.

1120
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,851
Okay. You speak English?

1121
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:21,936
Huh?

1122
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:23,771
You speakie the English?

1123
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:25,231
Okay, let's go. Get up.

1124
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:26,649
Fuck you, asshole.

1125
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,318
We're taking a walk.

1126
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:30,486
Get your fucking hands off me!

1127
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,541
Come on, man, kick his ass!

1128
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:05,313
Well, we're out of here, babe.
Say good night to Hal.

1129
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:06,856
Good night, Helen.

1130
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:09,108
You're going out in public like that?

1131
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:11,611
Festival of Love. Power to the people.

1132
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:13,655
- Hang loose.
- Heavy. Far out.

1133
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,740
Like, psychedelic.

1134
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:17,033
Bye.

1135
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,461
You want the doughnut?

1136
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:31,631
You behave.

1137
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:33,675
I'll send you to your room.

1138
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:37,136
There's only a glazed.
You can't have the chocolate.

1139
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:42,183
Okay. Easy.

1140
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,065
Everybody take it easy.

1141
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:51,859
Hey, just-- What is he saying?

1142
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:54,404
Hold the gun down so it don't go off.

1143
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:57,782
Put up your weapons!

1144
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,450
Weapons up.

1145
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:03,162
Easy, easy. Put the gun down.

1146
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,415
Tell him to put the gun down.

1147
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,458
I don't know how to say that.

1148
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:09,669
- Take it easy. Okay.
- It's all right.

1149
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,717
You little shit. Okay.

1150
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:21,556
Nobody out that door!

1151
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:27,729
Aw, fuck!

1152
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,500
Hey!

1153
01:24:58,218 --> 01:24:59,552
Ruben!

1154
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:19,030
Freeze!

1155
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:21,824
- l'm a juvenile!
- Don't you fucking move!

1156
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,679
It's weird, you know?

1157
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,349
You think you're going to crash your car...

1158
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:50,478
...or go out in a blaze of glory
with some big bad guy.

1159
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:51,896
And what happens?

1160
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:53,523
Some jerk...

1161
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:56,234
...forgets to lock his stupid drawer.

1162
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:02,031
I can't tell you how many times
I saw the two of you together and l saw....

1163
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,075
You know.

1164
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:09,872
I'd see you with your heads together.
He'd be making some kind of dumb joke.

1165
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:15,169
And....

1166
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:18,339
And l wished....

1167
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,680
I wished him dead.

1168
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:27,598
Every time.

1169
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,855
You know what?

1170
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:39,110
The strange thing about it is,
I'd really give my life right now...

1171
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:40,903
...to bring him back.

1172
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:44,532
Nikko.

1173
01:26:57,629 --> 01:27:00,089
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.

1174
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:01,757
Terrible trouble.

1175
01:27:02,009 --> 01:27:03,634
Who gives a fuck?

1176
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:07,179
I give a fuck.

1177
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,985
You know that in all the years
I've known you...

1178
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:23,070
...l've never seen you cry.

1179
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:33,080
He's on paid leave. I managed
to talk the commissioner out of no pay.

1180
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:40,963
You take his, you take mine.

1181
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:44,008
Now I'm supposed to lose
three good cops in one day?

1182
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:45,509
Sir...

1183
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:50,598
...l tried to control the situation.

1184
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:56,270
I tried to control it. l made a choice.

1185
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:02,068
It didn't work out.

1186
01:28:04,655 --> 01:28:06,197
An officer got killed.

1187
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:09,617
Mary Jane, you made a decision,
and it was the right decision.

1188
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,703
You just got the wrong result. That's all.

1189
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,585
You go out and you get drunk.

1190
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,213
I am.

1191
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:29,261
- Yeah?
- We missed him.

1192
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,681
Jesus Christ! How'd that happen?

1193
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:33,057
It was my fault.

1194
01:28:33,684 --> 01:28:35,309
I was so stupid.

1195
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,061
We had a....

1196
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:42,024
We had a problem with the--

1197
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:43,776
Ruben's dead.

1198
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:50,866
- Come in.
- No, really. I'm okay.

1199
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:53,077
I thought you should hear it
from somebody...

1200
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:55,204
...instead of seeing it on the news,
because...

1201
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:58,249
...l know that you and he had...

1202
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,042
...a thing.

1203
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:03,879
No. No, we didn't.

1204
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:05,339
He was just....

1205
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:09,552
He was a...

1206
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,012
...sweet man.

1207
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,304
I thought of him as a boy.

1208
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:15,016
- Come in.
- No, I'm okay.

1209
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:18,477
- Come in for just a sec.
- Answer your phone.

1210
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:21,272
Let me tell you something.

1211
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,525
Nine out of ten serial killers
are white males...

1212
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:26,569
...aged 20 to 35, just like these.

1213
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:32,324
The FBl estimates that there could be
as many as 35 serial killers...

1214
01:29:32,826 --> 01:29:35,745
...cruising for victims even as l speak.

1215
01:29:36,455 --> 01:29:37,621
All right, guys--

1216
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,332
Peter Kurten?

1217
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:01,353
- Oops! Sorry!
- Bitch!

1218
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:04,648
Fame

1219
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:07,651
Lets him loose
Hard to swallow

1220
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:09,487
Fame

1221
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,448
Puts you there
Where things are hollow

1222
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,950
Fame

1223
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:21,207
Not your brain, it's just the flame

1224
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:24,376
That burns your change to keep you insane

1225
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:28,506
Get the tap on Hudson's phone
and see if it traced a call two minutes ago.

1226
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,591
There's a tap on my phone?

1227
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:32,843
Yeah, just this second. He hung up.

1228
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:35,429
Don't argue. Please, please just do it.

1229
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:38,516
Is it possible this guy was a student
of mine?

1230
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:40,559
Where did you give this lecture?

1231
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:43,979
All over the country. Dozens of times.
It was my stock lecture.

1232
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:46,607
When was the last time you gave it here?

1233
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:50,736
Would have been last year,
just before....

1234
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:52,571
I'm getting it.

1235
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:57,159
That's it. That's the order I gave it.

1236
01:30:57,327 --> 01:31:01,205
"DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
Berkowitz, Dahmer." Dahmer's next.

1237
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:03,541
Which means he'll kill a man
and after that--

1238
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,459
He'll do Ted Bundy.

1239
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:07,378
Yeah?

1240
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:08,838
The Sound Factory? Perfect.

1241
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:12,466
I know where it is. l'm going now.
Give me some backup.

1242
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:14,635
Christ, Helen!

1243
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:16,303
Just maybe....

1244
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:17,972
Maybe.

1245
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:47,102
Helen.

1246
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:56,654
He's gonna do Ted Bundy next.

1247
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:58,948
That was the last name on the list.

1248
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:02,326
He'll pick the most extravagant murder.

1249
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,995
The song talked about a threesome.

1250
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:09,750
Bundy killed three girls in one night
at that sorority house...

1251
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,669
...Chi Omega.

1252
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,755
He-- He faked injuries.

1253
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:19,635
He wore a cast on one arm,
and he used crutches...

1254
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:21,762
...and he asked the girls for help.

1255
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:23,973
And he....

1256
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:25,724
He drove...

1257
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:29,144
...a very distinctive car. lt was a....

1258
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:30,479
Gold VW Bug.

1259
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:32,773
We need to get on the DMV.

1260
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:36,944
We want records on all gold
or tan-colored VW Bugs, any year.

1261
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:42,241
I want an in-person check
on every registered owner.

1262
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:49,123
Anyone who's registered a gold, yellow,
tan or any light-colored VW Bug.

1263
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:52,418
Contact campus security
at every college within 50 miles.

1264
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:57,548
They need to warn all female students,
especially those with long hair...

1265
01:33:57,716 --> 01:34:01,218
...to avoid any contact
with males they don't know.

1266
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:07,683
Report any man with an injury
or a handicap.

1267
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:14,648
DMV printouts on all Bug owners.

1268
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:16,567
- Beautiful.
- Mm-hm.

1269
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:32,249
No. No. No.

1270
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:34,543
That's him.

1271
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:39,381
He gave him the drink,
they went out on the dance floor and....

1272
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:40,799
You're absolutely sure?

1273
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:42,384
Yeah, that's him.

1274
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:44,511
Peter Foley, Daly City.

1275
01:35:10,997 --> 01:35:13,082
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1276
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:19,546
We've got him.

1277
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:24,968
Call the SWAT team.
I'm not taking any chances with this fuck.

1278
01:35:33,269 --> 01:35:36,814
Kind of defeats the purpose
of my Miracle Bra...

1279
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,190
...but who's looking?

1280
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:39,983
I hear you're onto him.

1281
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:41,318
Good work.

1282
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:43,028
Just horseshit luck.

1283
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:44,696
I don't think so.

1284
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,952
You take care out there. Okay?

1285
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:51,995
Don't l always?

1286
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:55,916
I love you.

1287
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,168
You know?

1288
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:00,003
Yeah...

1289
01:36:01,548 --> 01:36:03,173
...l know.

1290
01:36:18,148 --> 01:36:21,024
You're looking good, team leader.

1291
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,863
This is a status "David."

1292
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,239
Go, team leader.

1293
01:36:27,407 --> 01:36:30,367
Peter Foley, this is the police.

1294
01:36:30,535 --> 01:36:32,202
Come to the front door.

1295
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:35,205
Come out with your hands
above your head.

1296
01:36:38,835 --> 01:36:42,671
Team leader,
we have a fire in the basement window.

1297
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:45,048
This is status "George." This is go.

1298
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:02,566
We got a dead woman on the bed!

1299
01:37:03,693 --> 01:37:04,860
No pulse.

1300
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:52,783
Lieutenant, can you tell us
what happened here tonight?

1301
01:37:52,951 --> 01:37:57,329
San Francisco Police developed evidence
that identified the killer...

1302
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:00,666
...known in the media
as "The Copycat Killer"...

1303
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:03,627
- ...as one Peter Foley...
- Come on.

1304
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:05,796
...who lived at this address.

1305
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:09,132
When Mr. Foley was asked
to step outside to be interviewed...

1306
01:38:10,552 --> 01:38:12,970
...it's believed that he set fire
to the residence.

1307
01:38:21,187 --> 01:38:24,773
Don't tell me you both want
to use the men's room.

1308
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:44,084
Hi, Helen.

1309
01:38:47,714 --> 01:38:50,799
I got your invitation, and l accept.

1310
01:38:51,175 --> 01:38:53,135
Helen, it's MJ.

1311
01:38:53,303 --> 01:38:56,054
I'm sure you heard on your scanner.
It was a mess.

1312
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:58,348
I know it's late, but l'm coming over.

1313
01:38:58,516 --> 01:38:59,850
That's perfect.

1314
01:39:00,018 --> 01:39:02,352
That is perfect, Helen.

1315
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:05,188
Sounds like we have company coming.

1316
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,983
Now, l'm not gonna lie to you.

1317
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:12,237
This is gonna hurt.

1318
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,365
This is lnspector Monahan, Homicide.

1319
01:39:56,532 --> 01:40:00,869
I'm at Pier One, Fort Mason. I've got
an officer down. I need assistance.

1320
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:03,121
Copy, Monahan.

1321
01:40:32,985 --> 01:40:34,277
Shit.

1322
01:41:35,465 --> 01:41:36,798
Up we go.

1323
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:41,636
Oh, hi there.

1324
01:41:41,804 --> 01:41:44,473
We join our program already in progress.

1325
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,601
Inspector Monahan...

1326
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:50,353
...don't you ever get tired...

1327
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,731
...being a day late and a dollar short?

1328
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:58,945
You probably think l'm just gonna
maybe slit her throat right now.

1329
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:01,698
Cut my losses, so to speak.

1330
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:03,825
Well...

1331
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:06,411
...wrong-o!

1332
01:42:06,788 --> 01:42:11,333
Do you really think
I'd get her all dressed up so pretty...

1333
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:14,044
...with no place to go?

1334
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:17,881
Now, if you're a smart cop...

1335
01:42:18,132 --> 01:42:20,050
...you'll know where to find us.

1336
01:42:20,218 --> 01:42:22,761
And if you're a really smart cop...

1337
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,805
...you'll come alone.

1338
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:28,767
Otherwise...

1339
01:42:29,811 --> 01:42:31,394
...it's bye-bye, Helen.

1340
01:42:33,189 --> 01:42:34,481
See you.

1341
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:32,581
No, this is wrong.

1342
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:37,294
Here we go, Helen.

1343
01:43:37,628 --> 01:43:39,087
There we go.

1344
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:40,714
Much better.

1345
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:42,799
What about him?

1346
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:45,302
Did I get the pose right?

1347
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:49,514
Did the best l could from the photos.
Come on, help me out.

1348
01:43:49,932 --> 01:43:53,143
Which way was his head?
Was it this way, or this way?

1349
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:54,978
Uh or unh?

1350
01:43:56,564 --> 01:43:57,939
This way.

1351
01:43:58,107 --> 01:43:59,608
Good. Excellent.

1352
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:02,527
Everything has to be just so.

1353
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:07,407
God, Helen, I remember...

1354
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:10,243
...watching you up on that big screen.

1355
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:12,162
In your red dress.

1356
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:14,539
God, you looked huge.

1357
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:16,333
Look at you now.

1358
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:17,834
So sad.

1359
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:21,379
But look on the bright side.

1360
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:25,342
I am gonna make you
the world's most famous victim.

1361
01:44:26,052 --> 01:44:28,011
Guess what that makes me?

1362
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:33,808
Did you know that more books have
been written about Jack the Ripper...

1363
01:44:34,143 --> 01:44:35,936
...than Abraham Lincoln?

1364
01:44:44,946 --> 01:44:46,696
It's a sick world...

1365
01:44:46,864 --> 01:44:48,365
...isn't it, Helen?

1366
01:44:54,497 --> 01:44:56,748
You are not to go in there alone.

1367
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:58,833
You wait for proper backup.

1368
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:01,044
And you acknowledge my order!

1369
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:05,048
You stay out of that building
until backup arrives! You copy?

1370
01:45:05,216 --> 01:45:06,633
Absolutely, sir.

1371
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,504
Careful, Helen.

1372
01:45:47,049 --> 01:45:48,800
See?

1373
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:52,512
Now you've cut yourself, haven't you?

1374
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,139
Hmm?

1375
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:01,271
See, Helen, l've been practicing.

1376
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:06,359
Want to know the trick? Hm?

1377
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:08,486
Small...

1378
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:11,114
...incisions...

1379
01:46:13,451 --> 01:46:15,035
...with a fine...

1380
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:17,203
...instrument.

1381
01:46:18,873 --> 01:46:20,248
That way, Helen...

1382
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:22,083
...l can make it last...

1383
01:46:22,251 --> 01:46:23,710
...for hours.

1384
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:27,881
And you will not believe
how long a minute can feel.

1385
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:34,637
Fuck you.

1386
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:36,765
What?

1387
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:38,850
You heard me, you little twerp.

1388
01:46:39,393 --> 01:46:41,269
You think I'm afraid of you?

1389
01:46:42,063 --> 01:46:43,563
I know you are.

1390
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:45,899
I know all about you.

1391
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:48,401
You're just a sad...

1392
01:46:48,903 --> 01:46:50,653
...second-rate...

1393
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:53,531
...boring, impotent little copycat.

1394
01:46:56,702 --> 01:46:58,369
Watch it, bitch!

1395
01:46:58,579 --> 01:47:01,998
Or I will slice that smile off your face,
do you hear me?

1396
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:06,252
- Daryll Lee couldn't get it up, either.
- Do you hear me?!

1397
01:47:16,472 --> 01:47:20,266
Okay. l see, Helen. Nice try.

1398
01:47:20,976 --> 01:47:23,144
Want to know a little secret?

1399
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,271
I'm onto your trick.

1400
01:47:25,773 --> 01:47:27,690
I won't kill you fast.

1401
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:30,276
No matter how much...

1402
01:47:30,611 --> 01:47:32,695
...you're gonna want me to.

1403
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:49,712
Excellent, Helen.

1404
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:52,215
See, here's where Daryll Lee got sloppy.

1405
01:47:57,054 --> 01:47:59,055
He wasn't expecting a second cop.

1406
01:47:59,223 --> 01:48:01,015
- But l am.
- l'm in here!

1407
01:48:01,183 --> 01:48:02,851
Helen, relax.

1408
01:48:03,018 --> 01:48:06,396
That other cop's collecting his pension.
So will she.

1409
01:48:07,273 --> 01:48:10,233
But if you warn her, l will kill her.

1410
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:22,245
This is lnspector Monahan.
I have a message for Quinn.

1411
01:48:22,413 --> 01:48:23,496
Go ahead.

1412
01:48:23,664 --> 01:48:25,081
Tell him...

1413
01:48:25,249 --> 01:48:27,125
...l'm sorry l blew it.

1414
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:52,502
Now, that's my gun, isn't it?

1415
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:55,588
What in the world are you doing...

1416
01:49:55,756 --> 01:49:57,298
...with my gun?

1417
01:49:57,925 --> 01:49:59,008
Huh?

1418
01:49:59,176 --> 01:50:00,677
Get your ass over here.

1419
01:50:00,928 --> 01:50:03,805
Come on, doc,
help me out in this situation.

1420
01:50:03,973 --> 01:50:06,307
What do I do?
Do I stick her or shoot her?

1421
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:08,017
Shoot her or stick her, huh?

1422
01:50:08,352 --> 01:50:10,353
Come on, doc, help me out.

1423
01:50:50,561 --> 01:50:53,271
You watch this, Helen. You watching?

1424
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:56,733
Perfect symmetry here.

1425
01:50:57,443 --> 01:50:59,694
Get up here, you dumb bitch.
You watching?

1426
01:51:01,196 --> 01:51:02,488
You watching this?

1427
01:51:07,536 --> 01:51:08,828
Hey, hey!

1428
01:51:08,996 --> 01:51:11,497
Helen, what are you doing? No!

1429
01:51:13,625 --> 01:51:15,668
Feet on here!

1430
01:51:25,846 --> 01:51:27,430
Damn it!

1431
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:38,733
Good try, Helen.
But you don't get off that easy.

1432
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:41,694
Come on, get up. Let's go.

1433
01:51:41,862 --> 01:51:43,696
Get up, bitch.

1434
01:52:10,307 --> 01:52:12,850
Shit! Shit!

1435
01:52:27,991 --> 01:52:30,535
Help us! Somebody!

1436
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:18,124
Somebody!

1437
01:53:18,292 --> 01:53:23,463
Help us!

1438
01:53:27,217 --> 01:53:31,053
Hey, Helen,
looks like l cured the agoraphobia.

1439
01:53:32,014 --> 01:53:33,973
Help us! Help!

1440
01:53:34,141 --> 01:53:35,141
Forget it!

1441
01:53:36,018 --> 01:53:37,351
Too late!

1442
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:40,396
Too late for you, Helen!

1443
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:58,080
Come on. Put up your dukes!

1444
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:03,669
What the fuck are you
laughing at, bitch? Huh?

1445
01:54:06,048 --> 01:54:08,382
What the fuck are you laughing at?!

1446
01:54:09,092 --> 01:54:10,843
What are you waiting for?

1447
01:54:11,553 --> 01:54:12,762
Go ahead.

1448
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:57,950
Dear Conrad:

1449
01:55:58,118 --> 01:56:00,119
Thank you for your letter.

1450
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:01,621
Praise the Lord.

1451
01:56:01,788 --> 01:56:06,834
I know you must be so happy
that he chose to spare Dr. Hudson.

1452
01:56:07,002 --> 01:56:10,546
The big guy moves in mysterious ways,
don't he?

1453
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:14,091
It just so happens l'm awaiting the arrival...

1454
01:56:14,259 --> 01:56:18,304
...of a pair of genuine
Helen Hudson undies...

1455
01:56:18,472 --> 01:56:21,140
...signed personal to me.

1456
01:56:21,308 --> 01:56:24,393
A real collector's item,
I'm sure you'll know.

1457
01:56:25,228 --> 01:56:26,646
They're yours.

1458
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:29,899
But don't forget,
a disciple must be strong...

1459
01:56:30,067 --> 01:56:32,902
...if he is to succeed where others fail.

1460
01:56:33,612 --> 01:56:38,366
Peter strayed from the path
and the Lord smote him good.

1461
01:56:38,533 --> 01:56:40,326
So keep it simple.

1462
01:56:41,036 --> 01:56:42,787
Then glory is yours...

1463
01:56:42,954 --> 01:56:45,539
...and "vengeance is mine"...

1464
01:56:45,707 --> 01:56:47,917
...as the Good Book says.

1465
01:56:48,752 --> 01:56:51,253
I know you'll get my meaning.

1466
01:56:55,926 --> 01:56:58,094
Happy hunting, partner.

1467
01:56:58,929 --> 01:57:00,805
Daryll Lee Cullum.

1468
01:57:01,305 --> 01:58:01,234
