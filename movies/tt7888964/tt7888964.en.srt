everyone is.

665
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:54,636
Short story long,
he's as bad as they come.

666
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:58,574
<i>A connected, funded sociopath</i>

668
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:06,348
So, he's a bad guy?

669
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,623
- Has he got any hobbies?
- Collects art,

670
00:45:14,656 --> 00:45:17,259
<i>to the tune of eight
and nine figures.</i>

671
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:19,528
Anything good?

672
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:20,696
Fuck if I know.

673
00:45:20,729 --> 00:45:22,464
But what I do know is,

674
00:45:22,497 --> 00:45:24,633
if he doesn't know
who you are yet,

675
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:25,834
<i>he will soon.</i>

676
00:45:25,867 --> 00:45:28,837
What have you got for me?

677
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,273
I found his dad.

678
00:45:31,306 --> 00:45:33,475
He's got him at
a nursing home downtown.

679
00:45:33,508 --> 00:45:35,544
That's not much.

680
00:45:35,577 --> 00:45:37,512
I wouldn't worry
about this Hutch guy.

681
00:45:37,546 --> 00:45:40,349
Your man here looks to be
as vanilla as they come.

682
00:45:40,382 --> 00:45:45,554
If you can't recognize a wolf

683
00:45:45,587 --> 00:45:49,758
I question the viability

684
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,628
I have a friend at the Pentagon.

685
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:54,296
I'll keep looking.

686
00:45:55,197 --> 00:45:58,233
One blackmail package coming up.

687
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:08,644

<i>of a loose end like you,</i>

692
00:46:16,986 --> 00:46:20,422
he'd have to give up
his share of the Obshak.

693
00:46:21,456 --> 00:46:23,458
The Obshak?

694
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,295
Think of it like the 401(k)

695
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:29,665
<i>of the Russian mob.</i>

696

697
00:46:32,001 --> 00:46:33,970

699
00:46:37,606 --> 00:46:40,609
That said, he's more than
a bit weary of this life.

700
00:46:40,642 --> 00:46:42,979
I think, if he had his way,
he'd probably walk away.

We've always talked

Oh, I'd love that.

718
00:47:51,948 --> 00:47:54,483
But, um, can we afford it?

719
00:47:54,516 --> 00:47:57,552
I guess the real question is:
Can we afford not to?

720
00:47:57,586 --> 00:48:00,655
- Well, that would be wonderful.
- Yeah.

Bone burns to ash
