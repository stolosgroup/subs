3
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,692
Marquis!

4
00:00:58,825 --> 00:00:59,793
There you are.

5
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:06,100
No!

6
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,703
Dad! No! No!

7
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,038
Please! Help!

8
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,502
- Marq!
- Babe?

9
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,872
- Babe?
- I have been pounding this door

10
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:48,541
for the last ten minutes.
There's something wrong with the knob.

11
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,378
Yeah, it's jammed.
What did you do now?

12
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,247
Marq, don't start with me.
I am late. Just break it down.

13
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:55,316
This a Belgian,
imported, $1500 door.

14
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,319
There is no scenario short
of fire or global catastrophe

15
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,088
in which I'm gonna use my foot
to kick down a $1500 door.

16
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:04,125
- I don't care how much the door costs.
- $1500.

17
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:07,328
- 1500? Just break down the door.
- Uh, I'm gonna go call a locksmith, okay?

18
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,530
- No, wait, Marq! You break down this damn door!
- I'm gonna be right back.

19
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,099
Right now,
or I swear to God!

20
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:15,602
- Marq!
- I'm on the phone right now, okay?

21
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,906
I'm talking to the locksmith. They said
there's only four people ahead of us.

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,541
- Be like three hours. That's all.
- Marq, come on!

23
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,544
This is very important.
I can't be late for this meeting.

24
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,149
I'm sorry. I'm on the phone still, okay?
So I can't hear you.

25
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,717
Marq? Goddamn you, Marq.

26
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,163
What? I mean, hey, hey.

27
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,067
Will you marry me?

28
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,570
Marquis T. Woods,
I hate you.

29
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,342
But thank you
for rescuing me.

30
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,412
Anytime.

31
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,481
I love that butt!

32
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,923
Fight. I want to fucking fight.

33
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,692
And when I say "I", I mean you,
my messenger of fucking doom.

34
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,861
Marquis T. fucking Woods.

35
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,565
My personal goddamn gladiator.

36
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,101
But has he lost his bite?

37
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:24,205
Don't think for one second, that just because
the majority of the plaintiffs in this case

38
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,207
happen to be "my people,"

39
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,709
that I don't plan on taking that
ball straight to their end zone

40
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:33,347
and cramming that ball down
the throats of their attorneys.

41
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,049
And that doesn't bother you?

42
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,851
Bother me?

43
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,487
Though the plaintiffs are black,

44
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,356
their attorneys are white.
Correction: lily white.

45
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,193
This is a class-action lawsuit
of some public delicacy,

46
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:49,796
so we must deal with it
delicately.

47
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:54,034
Why use fists when we've
not yet exhausted words?

48
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:58,072
You're right, Marquis.
As always.

49
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,474
That's why I love you.

50
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,409
Except I don't do it
for your love.

51
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,744
No, Wyman.
I do it for your money.

52
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,348
Cha-ching, dear friend.

53
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,656
<i>Mr. Woods, an Otis Peeley,
Esquire, on the line for you.</i>

54
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,693
Don't know if I'm familiar with an
attorney by that name, Peeley...

55
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:24,864
- What does he want?
- <i>Family matter, he said. He's calling from Kentucky.</i>

56
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,174
- Put him through.
- <i>Yes, sir. Transferring him now.</i>

57
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:36,709
<i>Good day, Mr. Woods.
Thank you for taking my call.</i>

58
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,980
<i>I'm afraid I have some bad
news about your father.</i>

59
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,416
<i>He's passed away.</i>

60
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,252
<i>I sure am sorry
to give you this news,</i>

61
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,054
<i>but you are listed
as the next of kin</i>

62
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:48,721
<i>and there are matters
of his estate</i>

63
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,391
<i>that need to be resolved.</i>

64
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:54,894
You don't talk about him
very much. What was he like?

65
00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:00,234
Ah, you know, I haven't seen
him since I was a kid, baby.

66
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:04,038
Not since I ran away from
Appalachia and didn't look back.

67
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,773
Let's say...
he wasn't a kind man.

68
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,275
Just...

69
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,112
stuck in time
a little bit.

70
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:14,315
It'll be good for you
to get this closure, Marq.

71
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:17,084
This place sounds more than
just a little stuck in time.

72
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:19,386
They even got electricity
out there?

73
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,556
- Elec-what?
- And indoor plumbing, right?

74
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,024
They even got black people?

75
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,559
Okay, that's enough.

76
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:28,828
This man was your dad's father.

77
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:32,333
So, this weekend's
pickup game, workout,

78
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,603
dance class, hang out with your
homies, whatever it is,

79
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,373
deem it canceled,
because we are all going up there

80
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,310
to pay our final respects,
and that's all there is to it.

81
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,413
Okay, change
of subject matter.

82
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:50,251
Ty, let's talk about this kid
that's been bullying you at school.

83
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,452
Huh?

84
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,596
So, Ty,
tell me what's going on.

85
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:06,934
Social media shit, Dad.
You wouldn't understand.

86
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,536
I think I do understand
quite well.

87
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,273
Look, always remember,
you talk to your teachers,

88
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,774
but whatever you do,
don't fight.

89
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,344
That's just what
they expect from us.

90
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,180
Now, you see, baby?
That was easy.

91
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,057
It's beautiful.

92
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,926
What do you say
we listen to some music?

93
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,198
Any requests?
Anything y'all want to hear? Not hear?

94
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,536
Sam? Ty?

95
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,342
All right.

96
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,481
Ah!

97
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,849
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

98
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:36,790
Kids, I used to sing this
to your mama.

99
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,694
Yeah!

100
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,162
Sing it, V.

101
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,031
<i>♪ 'Cause you're mine ♪</i>

102
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,105
<i>♪ 'Cause you're mine ♪</i>

103
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,256
Ah!

104
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,629
Whew!

105
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,100
Son, ladder. The big one.

106
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,068
Diesel.

107
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,237
Gotta love it.

108
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,309
Dad, how did you even know
this place was here?

109
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:04,445
Well, son, they got apps
for everything.

110
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:07,214
I bet this place doesn't
even exist on a map.

111
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,084
Look, real talk,
your pops is a straight-up bush pilot.

112
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,754
I could navigate by using
the stars if I had to.

113
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:19,426
And this plane right here?
This is what we call old school.

114
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,297
- Right, baby?
- Damn, it is hot.

115
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,704
Okay, this was nice.

116
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:34,842
I'll be in the plane writing in my
journal, if anyone's looking for me.

117
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,413
- I'm gonna hit the head. Anybody need anything?
- Mm-mm.

118
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,235
Are you kidding me?

119
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:13,547
Whoa, shit. Dammit...

120
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:24,224
Hey. Yo, brother,
any service around here?

121
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,593
Slavery times is over.

122
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,796
Pump your own damn gas.

123
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,567
Oh.

124
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,507
No.

125
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,642
Let me see.

126
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,913
- Uh...
- Damn, I ain't gonna steal it.

127
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,180
I just wanna look at it.

128
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,791
Hey, a mojo bag. I ain't seen
one of them since I was a kid.

129
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:02,964
But even then,
I wasn't too sure what it was.

130
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,298
Luck, man.

131
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,034
- Luck.
- Yeah, luck.

132
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,602
- You ever heard of it?
- Well, sure, I heard of luck.

133
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,405
- Protection?
- Protection from what?

134
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:15,509
From folks looking
to conjure your ass.

135
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,180
You must be rich.

136
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,618
How much that cost you?

137
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:28,655
I... I don't know, really.

138
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,125
You got it,
but you ain't know how much it costs?

139
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:42,636
My, uh...
My dad bought it for me.

140
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,171
Shit.

141
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,639
There we go.

142
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,242
Let's see there. Okay.

143
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,445
And you can keep
the change there, Pop.

144
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:55,682
Oh, and I need the facilities.
I gotta take a leak.

145
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,584
Privy's out back.

146
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,754
With a quarter moon
on the door, right?

147
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,863
It's been nice, uh, talking to you,
getting to know you. You have a good day.

148
00:12:09,998 --> 00:12:13,634
You ain't headed with that airplane
up into yonder foothills, is you?

149
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:18,940
- Yeah.
- And you ain't wanna be taking a mess of these along with you?

150
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,208
No, I'm cool. Thank you.

151
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,644
I don't believe
in that stuff.

152
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:24,912
Suit yourself.

153
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,683
- Can I have my phone back?
- What's up with your hand?

154
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,852
Oh, this?

155
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:35,622
Busted it playing ball.

156
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,824
Funny thing, though,
after it healed?

157
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,596
Boom, Steph Curry all day.
Jump shot's money.

158
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,637
Damn.

159
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,074
He really do have one.

160
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,574
Huh.

161
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,389
Fuck that.

162
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,892
So what y'all doing
up around here?

163
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:14,996
Funeral. My grandfather's.

164
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,131
I never met him.

165
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,466
I ain't heard of no one
dying around here.

166
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,802
No, further up that way.

167
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:33,413
Yeah, I best be gettin'.

168
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,882
Before them fish
quit to jump.

169
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:39,319
And next time you want
some service around here,

170
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:41,888
get you a 5G phone.

171
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:45,559
It's been years since we
got 4Gs or 3Gs around here.

172
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,866
Country-ass nigga.

173
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:54,768
What?

174
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,405
What did you just say?

175
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,675
I do not want to hear you use that
word again, do you understand me?

176
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,679
Yeah. I mean, Dad uses it.

177
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,347
It's every other word
on his playlist.

178
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:09,483
Please. I am talking about
"country-ass."

179
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,651
Don't do that,
hating other black folk.

180
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,955
At some point,
we were all country.

181
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:16,323
I do not want to hear that word
come out of your mouth.

182
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,593
- Yes, ma'am.
- Damn right, "Yes, ma'am."

183
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:22,629
Now get your sorry ass
back in that plane.

184
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,912
Now you know there was no way I was gonna
let my delicate derriere touch that.

185
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,949
Let's just get going.

186
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,786
Oh...

187
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:52,826
No, no, you gotta be kidding me.
You just... just hang tight. Be cool, okay?

188
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,333
Open the door.

189
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,937
Open the door.

190
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:14,282
Good day to you. I'm aware that the
civil aviation code here in West Virginia

191
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,684
stipulates that it's legal for
any private jet, single engine,

192
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:21,989
to land on any open strip of landing
area, private or otherwise.

193
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:23,323
Baby, you wanna?

194
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,826
The paper states it
right here, sir.

195
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,495
Here it is, right here.

196
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:34,302
Well, legal or not,

197
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,271
don't get much plane traffic
through here.

198
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,640
Thought I'd stop by and make
sure everything was copacetic.

199
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,045
So, where y'all headed today?

200
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,579
Cypress Ridge.

201
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:51,551
Well, if there's nothing else,
we'd like to get on our way.

202
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,188
Obviously, there's
a big storm a-brewing,

203
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:57,325
and I would just like to get my
beautiful family up top before that hits.

204
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,792
"Y'all have a nice day."

205
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:01,929
All right, y'all have
a nice day now.

206
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:04,497
Tydon.

207
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,135
- I say something?
- No, Sheriff, just kids having fun, that's all.

208
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,505
You understand.

209
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:58,085
Well, I hope everyone enjoyed their
first brush with the local color.

210
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:00,520
Dad, seriously,
this place is a creep show.

211
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,789
Come on, Sam,
it ain't that bad.

212
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:06,493
I bet there's a million billion inbred
hillbillies watching up at us right now.

213
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:10,131
Stroking it.
And I ain't talking no banjo, Sam.

214
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:12,899
Tydon, I have had just
about enough from you today.

215
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,105
Is something going on?

216
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,607
So what happened?
What did he say?

217
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,243
It doesn't matter
what he said.

218
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,810
Kids, put your headphones on.

219
00:17:23,945 --> 00:17:26,680
I said put your headphones on.

220
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:33,387
You want me to land the plane, pull off my belt,
go 12 rounds with the kid like my dad did?

221
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,323
Is that what you want?

222
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,491
Of course not, Marq.
But the way you treat them,

223
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,194
they're becoming
entitled jerks.

224
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:44,265
Give me a break. Because I give
my kids what I could never have?

225
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,765
And you turned out
just fine, Marq.

226
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,903
Veora, I didn't turn out
just fine. Okay?

227
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:52,974
If I had my way, your son and daughter
would spend their lives in a boardroom,

228
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:56,609
not in some jungle that I
couldn't get out of fast enough.

229
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:00,281
Except sometimes, Marq,

230
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:03,384
that jungle comes back
to find you,

231
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,653
no matter what boardroom
you're hiding in.

232
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,890
- Whoa!
- Dad?

233
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:13,626
It's fine. Stay back there.

234
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,796
I've flown in this before.
Everything's cool.

235
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,870
Dad! Dad!

236
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:26,907
Mayday! Mayday!

237
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:40,687
Take the knife!
Take the fucking knife, Marq!

238
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,789
Only cut them at the throat.

239
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,098
Veora?

240
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:58,865
What the fuck...

241
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:17,784
What the...

242
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,754
Where am I?

243
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:25,126
Well, well, well, well.

244
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,328
Look at what the cat
done drug in.

245
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:31,698
Mercy. All right, come on.

246
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,968
Let me get you on
back up on that bed.

247
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:36,870
What? Where? Where am I?

248
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:39,974
- Where am I?
- Up in my attic sewing room.

249
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:43,511
Only suitable room around here
that wasn't already took up.

250
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,013
Now come on,
come on, get on up.

251
00:20:46,147 --> 00:20:49,950
Ma'am, I just want to know how I got
here, where my family is.

252
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:53,487
Young'un, you been
rode hard and put up wet.

253
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:56,490
Now you get yourself
up on that bed, all right?

254
00:20:56,624 --> 00:20:59,360
All right? And then we can
talk ourselves a spell.

255
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:03,030
No, no, see... no, I don't need
to go to nobody's bed.

256
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:06,200
I just... I need to know
how I got here,

257
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,669
where the hell I am,
where my goddamn family is.

258
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,838
Oh, no. Earl!

259
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:14,475
- Earl!
- What?

260
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:19,480
Now if you gonna guest in my attic,
get one thing right from the start.

261
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:24,385
Vain naming the Lord
in this household? Oh, no!

262
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:25,619
Earl!

263
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:29,290
What you hollering
at me for, woman?

264
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:32,493
You know I got me a bad heart
and a mess of bad innards.

265
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,596
Don't be bad-innarding me.
I got a serious problem up here.

266
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:39,466
- What, he causing him a ruckus?
- No, mister, I was just asking...

267
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,970
I'll pitch a fit of my own,
he don't get himself back up on that bed.

268
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:48,175
You do look like you could
eat corn through a picket fence, though.

269
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,180
Yeah, he a big old boy,
too. Mm-hmm.

270
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:56,250
Too much for me, anyhow.
I'll fetch Lewis up.

271
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:57,651
Lewis?

272
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:01,155
No, ma'am. Ma'am...

273
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:04,225
I just wanna know
where the hell my family is?

274
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:17,638
Lewis don't talk much.
Some people think he's slow.

275
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,208
But trust me, there ain't
nothing slow about Lewis.

276
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:24,278
Hey, what's going on, man? Hey!

277
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,580
- Hey! What? Whoa!
- You calm yourself down.

278
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:28,482
You calm yourself down.

279
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:31,884
- Damn it. Hey, man!
- He definitely needs to calm himself.

280
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:35,356
No, I don't need to calm myself. Just need
to know where the fuck my goddamn family is.

281
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:38,058
- Oh! Lord Jesus.
- Boy, you was in an accident.

282
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,494
- Don't you even remember that?
- Accident...

283
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:43,030
Mayday!

284
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:47,201
Now rest yourself
back on that bed.

285
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:50,371
Oh, my God.
So what about my family?

286
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:56,677
I got a wife and I got a daughter
and a son. Have you seen my family?

287
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:00,847
Wasn't no one in that mushed
up old plane but your own self.

288
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:02,583
Oh, no, no.
No, we gotta get 'em.

289
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,552
- Hey, man!
- You got some of that good rootwork, Ellie?

290
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:07,588
Earl, you know I do.

291
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,556
And if he can't calm himself,

292
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,860
I'm sure the good Lord will be okay
if I went on and did it for him.

293
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:16,430
Hell no, I don't need that.
I just need...

294
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:19,400
What's sauce for the goose
is sauce for the gander.

295
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:20,968
Oh, no!

296
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:29,903
I tell you, I'm gonna
cook you up one day.

297
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:37,177
Ah, you lookin' good,
Marquis T.

298
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:36,103
Oh!
Long fever-sleep.

299
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:38,405
Poison in your blood,
I suppose.

300
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:44,211
Had to put those on you too, 'cause you
was just clawing at your face so bad.

301
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:48,282
Oh, goodness. Oh, come on.

302
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:51,051
Must have been
one powerful dream.

303
00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:58,659
- Come on, get up.
- Hey, Ms. Eloise, come on, sit down here for a minute.

304
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:01,695
Ms. Eloise, I'm begging you.
I just need you to help me.

305
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:06,333
- Ah.
- What I really think I need is just an ambulance.

306
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,769
Ain't no hospital
within 50 miles of here.

307
00:26:08,903 --> 00:26:13,273
I'm talking about money. I mean it.
I got all the money you could ever want.

308
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,275
- Oh!
- Cost ain't no object.

309
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:18,111
So, I could pay you gladly for
any ambulance service to come here

310
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:20,581
from however far, it don't matter
what, whatever it takes,

311
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:24,117
just so a proper search team can
come back, look for my family.

312
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,954
You understand?
I'm trying to find my family.

313
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:29,289
And if you could kindly walk
me down them steps of yours,

314
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:31,391
then I'll use your phone.
I'll use your telephone.

315
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:33,527
I'll call on my own.
I mean that.

316
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,499
Mercy. You gonna learn,
if you live long as me,

317
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:41,134
money can't get you everything,

318
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:43,604
especially a telephone
when you ain't got one.

319
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:46,540
You're telling me
you ain't got no telephone?

320
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:49,376
Mm-mm. Supposed to be
bringing people together.

321
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:56,416
Well, it ain't nothing but just
the tools of the Great Divider. No!

322
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:59,720
Now I got
a little something here

323
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:02,456
that'll help you get better.

324
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:07,094
This is my latest
and greatest Boogity.

325
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,932
What is that?

326
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,768
A Boogity.
You ain't ever heard of a Boogity?

327
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:20,073
It's one thing
standing for another.

328
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:23,176
Now this,
it stands for you.

329
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,612
And the more it resembles you,

330
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:30,717
with blood and nail clippings
and hair, a pinch of semen...

331
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:35,355
...then, the more it is you.

332
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:39,760
The more good things
happen to it,

333
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:44,798
the more good things
happen to you.

334
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:48,402
Oh, a Boogity's
a kind of folk magic,

335
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:51,538
like a rootworker, a fixer.

336
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:56,810
You know how, when people say, "I'm
gonna fix you, I'm gonna fix you good,"

337
00:27:56,945 --> 00:27:58,378
that's what a rootworker do.

338
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:02,616
Mojos, potions, charms, tricks.

339
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:09,122
Oh! Son, you looking at
a straight-up, bona fide,

340
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:12,259
back-in-the-hills
rootworker right here.

341
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:14,494
Oh, yeah! Let me show you.

342
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:18,799
I put you up, I put you down.

343
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:22,569
I put you sideways
and I spin you around.

344
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:32,145
And then, see, I'm gonna put it over
here, in this here window...

345
00:28:33,982 --> 00:28:35,449
...to look out.

346
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:41,755
So it can see when help is
gonna come down the road.

347
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,223
Salt.

348
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:46,360
Yeah!

349
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:54,068
Marq, the devil can't come
in here and get you neither.

350
00:28:56,037 --> 00:29:02,376
Have a real good rest,
Marquis T. Woods.

351
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:41,916
Okay...

352
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:59,299
Let's go.

353
00:33:28,276 --> 00:33:32,445
Yeah! All right! All right!

354
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:37,184
Who wants a visit from the Ole Hoodoo Ghost?

355
00:33:37,318 --> 00:33:41,488
'Cause I got that good
rootwork that y'all come for,

356
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:43,823

for you today.

357
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,793
Special, y'all!
She's got that good rootwork.

358
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:49,230

359
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,332
But when that blood moon come,

360
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:53,134
we gonna fix you up real good.

361
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:57,204
Hush up now, Earl.
Who's ailing?

362
00:33:57,338 --> 00:34:00,807
And what about you, Lorraine?
Is you ailing? Come on up here.

363
00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:03,244
- Yeah!
- Come on up here.

364
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:05,112
Earl, catch that old tomcat.

365
00:34:05,246 --> 00:34:08,548
Take his tongue and put it
in Lorraine's Boogity.

366
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:10,817
And then save those eyes
for me later.

367
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:31,805
Ooh!

368
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:34,275
Speak, woman,
for you are healed!

369
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:37,411
Speak, woman. Speak up now.
Say them words.

370
00:34:37,544 --> 00:34:41,082
Come on, now. That darn cat
ain't got your tongue no more!

371
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:43,951
- No dang more!
- I can talk!

372
00:34:45,852 --> 00:34:48,755
See that! She's cured!
Now, we ain't done yet!

373
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:50,391
Whoo. All right!

374
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,126
Lewis.

375
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:56,030
Fetch that goat.
Now, Julius, here,

376
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:59,000
he ain't been able to see
since he had his accident.

377
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:02,535
Come on.
Come on up here with me.

378
00:35:10,478 --> 00:35:16,050
I need you to take those cat's
eyes and put them into Julius' Boogity.

379
00:35:17,717 --> 00:35:21,122
Now, Julius, if you had eyes,

380
00:35:21,255 --> 00:35:23,257
you'd be able to see.

381
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:27,761
But you don't have any eyes.
We gonna fix that.

382
00:35:27,894 --> 00:35:30,530
Earl, get those goat's eyes

383
00:35:30,663 --> 00:35:32,599
and bring 'em here to me.

384
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:38,838
Yes, yes, yes!

385
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:43,210
Lift your head for me.
That's good, Julius.

386
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:52,086
You want to see.
You want to see.

387
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:55,256
Now tell us, Julius,

388
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:59,193
- tell us what you see.
- What you see, Julius?

389
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:03,897
What you see?

390
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:12,907
Him.

391
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:23,050
Folks, we'll be right back.

392
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:31,591
I don't think
he could've gotten out.

393
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:33,928
Let's go see.

394
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:48,242
Lewis! Come!

395
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:10,424
The window's open.

396
00:38:10,558 --> 00:38:14,929
Yeah, I needed some air,
Ms. Eloise. That okay?

397
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:36,917
You soaked plumb through.

398
00:38:37,051 --> 00:38:39,486
You wasn't out
in the rain, were you?

399
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:42,855
In the rain?

400
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,025
Oh, come on, Eloise,
you kidding?

401
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:49,630
You know, I just ain't thinking
straight. I'm worried about my family.

402
00:39:11,485 --> 00:39:15,788
Anything special catch your eye
when you moved this curtain?

403
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:21,629
Like... Like what?

404
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:23,097
Oh, I don't know.

405
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,333
We were having ourselves
an old time revival

406
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:29,603
and I just thought you might
have caught yourself an eye-full.

407
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:34,208
I can't imagine
what a city boy like you

408
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:36,543
must have thought about that.

409
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,483
By that, you mean, what,
like faith healing? Something like that?

410
00:39:42,616 --> 00:39:46,387
Well, sort of.
Only instead of the Holy Spirit,

411
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,490
we use the Boogity.
Remember what I said?

412
00:39:49,623 --> 00:39:52,792
Come good to the Boogity,
come good to you.

413
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:57,231
Hmm, like, sticking
chicken legs in a doll

414
00:39:57,364 --> 00:39:59,799
till a paralyzed man
can walk.

415
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,002
Oh...

416
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:05,639
You just started sounding like them
folks that don't believe nothing

417
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,975
unless they can
see or touch it.

418
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:11,645
And with all due respect, Ms. Eloise,
you're starting to sound like my father.

419
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:15,683
Trust me, I've done met my share of
spiritual people in my day, sure have.

420
00:40:15,815 --> 00:40:19,753
All I'm saying is all of that,
I don't know, all of that mojo,

421
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:22,489
maybe it's just psychosomatic.

422
00:40:22,623 --> 00:40:27,894
Like somebody can believe in something
so bad until it physically becomes true.

423
00:40:28,028 --> 00:40:31,898
I mean, come on, you don't really believe
in all that stuff you been talking, right?

424
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:39,373
Guess I have to.

425
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:44,545
We don't have much in the way
of Obamacare around here.

426
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:50,951
Ms. Eloise,
I didn't mean it like that, okay?

427
00:40:51,085 --> 00:40:53,420
Of course you did.

428
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,026
You a city boy.

429
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:16,577
Of course. You better
than all of this.

430
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:30,758
You hear me, boy?
You think you're better than me, boy?

431
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,193
- You just like me, boy.
- No!

432
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:35,662
- Got that anger in you too. Can't escape it.
- No!

433
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:38,565
<i>Just like me.
Hey, where you going? Come back here, boy.</i>

434
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:40,200
<i>You're gonna see!</i>

435
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:23,043
I see you done worked yourself
up into a sure enough appetite.

436
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:25,145
Ah, it's so good,
Ms. Eloise.

437
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:28,482
Hey, look, uh...

438
00:42:28,615 --> 00:42:32,453
I've been meaning
to apologize to you.

439
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:35,355
Sorry about
what I said yesterday.

440
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:38,592
I didn't mean it.
I just really miss my family.

441
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:42,396
- Ah, I know, baby.
- Last time I was up here, it was with my pops,

442
00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:45,999
- and he just wasn't...
- He wasn't one to spare the rod.

443
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:53,173
I saw those scars on you.

444
00:42:58,111 --> 00:43:02,516
Yeah. Well, let's just say I
done spent the last 25 years...

445
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,587
trying to build a very
different life for myself.

446
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,490
Well, can't never could.

447
00:43:09,623 --> 00:43:13,260
You can't expect
a soul to be able to change

448
00:43:13,393 --> 00:43:15,762
the way he or she thinks,
you know, overnight.

449
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:21,168
Which is one of the reasons I said
you've gotta keep your strength up.

450
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:23,637
Let me get you
another helping.

451
00:44:12,052 --> 00:44:17,391
Now I do like
a man with an appetite.

452
00:44:17,524 --> 00:44:20,227
Oh! It means
you're getting stronger.

453
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,096
Well, it sure is good,
Ms. Eloise.

454
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,732
Say, Ms. Eloise,
when I was waking up...

455
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:31,338
I don't know, it sounded like
I heard like a ping.

456
00:44:31,906 --> 00:44:33,540
And then I heard it again.

457
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:37,210
Oh, that was probably just
me ringing the chow bell

458
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,179
for Earl and Lewis.

459
00:44:39,313 --> 00:44:41,448
Yeah, but it kinda sounded
like the ping that comes,

460
00:44:41,582 --> 00:44:44,751
you know, when a cellular
phone gets a message.

461
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:50,223
Ms. Eloise, somebody
could be looking for me.

462
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:53,928
Oh, well, that would be
a "I do declare" miracle,

463
00:44:54,062 --> 00:44:57,431
seeing how there ain't nothing
like that in this house.

464
00:44:57,564 --> 00:44:59,499
I done already
told you that.

465
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:04,404
You did tell me that.
You did mention that.

466
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:08,108
Um, I guess maybe
just a fever dream again.

467
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:11,378
- What you got going on there?
- Oh, just casting the bones.

468
00:45:11,511 --> 00:45:14,815
You know, you throw them
to tell your future.

469
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:17,651
- What's it telling you?
- Well, it's telling me

470
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:20,287
it'll probably be
around the blood moon

471
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,490
when you get
all that poison out of you

472
00:45:23,624 --> 00:45:26,360
and you see your family again.

473
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:29,030
I can see it right here,
as clear as day.

474
00:45:29,162 --> 00:45:32,833
And that blood moon is only
a couple of days away.

475
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:34,102
Ooh, come on.

476
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:37,638
- Try throwing them bones.
- Who, me?

477
00:45:37,771 --> 00:45:39,941
- No, come on. I can't do that.
- Come on.

478
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:45,178
I know you got that old-time
slave magic in you, Marquis T.

479
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:51,184
Oh, can you hear that?

480
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,624
That's your ancient self.

481
00:45:57,758 --> 00:46:01,561
Your better self
is calling you.

482
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:05,766
You know, you like Lewis was.

483
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:08,069
Uppity house Negro.

484
00:46:08,201 --> 00:46:11,872
- Had to be brought down a peg or two.
- Oh, come on, Ms. Eloise.

485
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:14,741
Oh, yeah. You like him.
You may live in the city,

486
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:18,046
but you ain't from there.
You from this land

487
00:46:18,178 --> 00:46:21,314
and everything
that empowers it.

488
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:24,418
This is the blood
that's running in your veins,

489
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:26,486
giving you your true life.

490
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,923
Ms. Eloise,
why are you telling me all of this?

491
00:46:30,058 --> 00:46:33,995
'Cause, baby,

492
00:46:34,128 --> 00:46:37,397
you somehow has forgotten,

493
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:41,868
for a spell, who you are.

494
00:46:42,502 --> 00:46:44,072
Now, what do you see?

495
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:48,275
All the wisdom of the
universe is in these bones.

496
00:46:48,408 --> 00:46:50,343
Won't you play with them?

497
00:46:55,016 --> 00:46:57,484
Eloise, why do you
keep locking that door, huh?

498
00:46:57,617 --> 00:46:59,653
It's for your own good.

499
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:02,522
I'm on your side.

500
00:47:05,892 --> 00:47:09,529
What a crock of shit.

501
00:47:12,033 --> 00:47:13,667
Oh, boy.

502
00:48:18,865 --> 00:48:20,001
Help.

503
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:25,572
Ooh! Oh, can't leave
all this mess

504
00:48:25,705 --> 00:48:28,842
- just laying around.
- Yeah.

505
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:33,014
- Might stink the whole place up.
- Yeah.

506
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:47,048
Earl, that you
and that old mangy bird again?

507
00:50:48,249 --> 00:50:51,218
I told you to put that bird
in the root cellar.

508
00:50:51,352 --> 00:50:55,156
Got that old-time magic!
That old-time magic!

509
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:00,794
Earl? That you?

510
00:51:00,928 --> 00:51:02,196
Shut the fuck up.

511
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,131
You old buzzard?

512
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:17,510
Shut the fuck up.

513
00:51:17,644 --> 00:51:19,479
I don't know what
Earl's been teaching you.

514
00:51:19,612 --> 00:51:21,848
You old raggedy rat
with wings.

515
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,251
But it's gonna stop,
I tell you that.

516
00:51:24,952 --> 00:51:26,120
Earl!

517
00:51:53,381 --> 00:51:54,514
Earl!

518
00:51:54,647 --> 00:51:56,649
Get Lewis!

519
00:54:42,316 --> 00:54:45,252
Come back here, boy.
What, you some kind of house nigga now?

520
00:54:45,386 --> 00:54:49,023
You're better than me 'cause you
can read your fancy books and all?

521
00:54:49,156 --> 00:54:51,625
It's real,
but you gotta believe.

522
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:54,662
You're just like me, boy.
You got that anger in you.

523
00:54:54,794 --> 00:54:56,397
You gotta believe
or it won't work.

524
00:55:19,386 --> 00:55:22,323
Ah, the blood moon's tonight.

525
00:55:23,691 --> 00:55:27,061
You're gonna feel
a whole lot better, Eloise.

526
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:04,224
Fuck!

527
00:57:08,562 --> 00:57:09,930
Okay.

528
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,978
Veora?

529
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:35,255
Tydon?

530
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:52,166
That old-time magic.

531
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:07,080
Veora? Sam? Ty?

532
00:59:47,221 --> 00:59:50,224
Why are you doing
all this, Eloise?

533
01:00:04,238 --> 01:00:06,073
Eloise.

534
01:00:06,807 --> 01:00:08,542
Earl.

535
01:00:09,576 --> 01:00:10,611
Lewis.

536
01:00:10,744 --> 01:00:14,147
"1860." What the fuck?

537
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:24,191
What are you up to,
you old crazy lady?

538
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:28,795
"Blood moon.
Transference of life spell."

539
01:00:32,032 --> 01:00:33,800
"Blood of my blood."

540
01:00:33,935 --> 01:00:35,402
Blood of my blood.

541
01:00:35,536 --> 01:00:37,504
"Seed of my seed."

542
01:00:38,572 --> 01:00:40,641
"Flesh of my flesh."

543
01:00:44,778 --> 01:00:48,382
Oh, my God.
They're putting a spell on me.

544
01:00:58,392 --> 01:01:00,527
<i>Gotta believe
or it won't work.</i>

545
01:02:10,897 --> 01:02:13,166
Come on, come on...

546
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:15,469
Yeah.

547
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:22,509
I fucking knew it.

548
01:02:23,343 --> 01:02:25,278
Ah, shit!

549
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:28,482
Fuck, come on, come on.

550
01:02:28,615 --> 01:02:31,385
If I had known that
Lorraine was gonna talk so much,

551
01:02:31,518 --> 01:02:33,720
I'd have never put a tongue
back in her mouth.

552
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:36,857
That woman can talk now.

553
01:02:36,991 --> 01:02:38,926
Ty's phone. Yes.

554
01:02:39,726 --> 01:02:41,795
All right...

555
01:02:43,397 --> 01:02:46,466
With all that cussin' you do,
I'm gonna sew it up.

556
01:02:52,006 --> 01:02:54,174
Whoa...

557
01:02:55,308 --> 01:02:57,411
Marquis T.,
you awake up there?

558
01:02:57,544 --> 01:03:00,514
About time to get
your dressings changed.

559
01:03:00,647 --> 01:03:04,052
Darn it, Ellie, did you
leave the door ajar again?

560
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:08,455
No. Sounds like something
your old barren ass would do.

561
01:03:08,588 --> 01:03:11,092
What if he ripped
that spike out?

562
01:03:11,224 --> 01:03:13,794
Been free-wheelin' all over
the farm while we was gone.

563
01:03:13,928 --> 01:03:16,196
Well,
we fixin' to find out, ain't we?

564
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:17,932
Lewis, bring that ax.

565
01:03:18,066 --> 01:03:20,801
Might gonna have
to chop at something else.

566
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,482
Oh, fuck.

567
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:43,416
Marquis T., you haven't
been walking around here, have you?

568
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:46,553
Oh, Ms. Eloise, no, no, no.

569
01:04:46,686 --> 01:04:49,389
- I just woke up.
- Uh-huh.

570
01:04:49,523 --> 01:04:52,459
Well, we gonna have to
look at that foot of yours.

571
01:04:53,995 --> 01:04:57,464
- Okay.
- There, there.

572
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:05,940
- Well...
- Yeah, it's looking better there, right?

573
01:05:06,673 --> 01:05:08,308
That's what them bones said.

574
01:05:08,441 --> 01:05:10,044
It'd be time
by the blood moon.

575
01:05:10,178 --> 01:05:13,680
Which is a total lunar eclipse,
ain't that right, Mr. Earl?

576
01:05:13,814 --> 01:05:17,018
Yeah, if my memory serves
me correct, that's tonight.

577
01:05:17,151 --> 01:05:18,552
Hmm, well!

578
01:05:18,685 --> 01:05:22,924
It looks a mite refreshed.

579
01:05:23,057 --> 01:05:24,791
Oh, ah, yes, it does.

580
01:05:24,926 --> 01:05:26,493
- Yeah.
- I'll grant you that.

581
01:05:26,626 --> 01:05:28,262
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

582
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:30,031
Well, you get your rest,

583
01:05:30,164 --> 01:05:34,068
since you're so close
to all of this being over.

584
01:05:42,676 --> 01:05:44,411
Go on, Lewis.

585
01:05:52,485 --> 01:05:54,021
Oh, come on, come on.

586
01:05:57,158 --> 01:05:58,491
Oh, come on...

587
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:02,495
Come on, son.
What's your passcode?

588
01:06:02,629 --> 01:06:07,034
Birthday... 2-1-6.

589
01:06:07,168 --> 01:06:08,401
Damn it.

590
01:06:12,439 --> 01:06:13,975
Fuck.

591
01:06:14,108 --> 01:06:16,177
You're a 16-year-old boy,

592
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,912
what could your passcode be?

593
01:06:21,115 --> 01:06:22,649
What would it be?

594
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:31,458
Ah! Yeah!

595
01:06:33,426 --> 01:06:35,930
Yeah. Hello?

596
01:06:36,063 --> 01:06:38,199
<i>Cypress Valley
Police Department.</i>

597
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:41,468
Listen, I've got 1% battery
left on this phone, okay?

598
01:06:41,601 --> 01:06:44,704
- So I gotta talk real fast.
- <i>Okay, now slow up, tell me what the heck's going on.</i>

599
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:47,909
We went down in a plane crash, all right?
Next thing I know, I wake up in this house

600
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:51,544
- I can't tell you where it is.
- <i>Hold up, you wouldn't happen to be Marquis T. Woods?</i>

601
01:06:51,678 --> 01:06:53,147
Yeah, yeah. That's me.
Do you know me?

602
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:55,649
<i>Know you?
Mr. Woods, we spoke.</i>

603
01:06:55,782 --> 01:06:58,219
<i>I checked in on you at
the gas station in Lemona.</i>

604
01:06:58,352 --> 01:07:02,455
- Yeah, I remember you. Yeah!
- <i>I've been looking for you all week.</i>

605
01:07:02,589 --> 01:07:05,960
<i>Your wife and daughter walked into the
police station about five days ago,</i>

606
01:07:06,093 --> 01:07:08,162
- <i>battered and bruised.</i>
- What about my son?

607
01:07:08,296 --> 01:07:10,463
- <i>Oh...</i>
- What was that?

608
01:07:10,597 --> 01:07:13,334
<i>Mr. Woods, I'm sorry, um,</i>

609
01:07:13,466 --> 01:07:16,569
<i>we have not found
your son yet.</i>

610
01:07:22,109 --> 01:07:23,677
<i>Mr. Woods?</i>

611
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:26,479
<i>Mr. Woods, listen, I'm sorry.</i>

612
01:07:26,613 --> 01:07:30,351
<i>Why don't you tell me where you are,
and I can come get you, at least.</i>

613
01:07:30,483 --> 01:07:34,422
Somewhere, in a house,
with these old goddamn people.

614
01:07:34,554 --> 01:07:35,990
They're black,
I can tell you that.

615
01:07:36,123 --> 01:07:38,326
Um, the woman is Eloise,
they call her Ellie.

616
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:41,695
I think her husband...
her husband, his name is Earl.

617
01:07:41,828 --> 01:07:44,165
<i>I do know an old couple
who go by those names.</i>

618
01:07:44,298 --> 01:07:46,300
<i>I'm right by
that farm right now.</i>

619
01:07:46,434 --> 01:07:49,903
<i>I'll come in.
Now, you stay by that phone, you hear?</i>

620
01:08:14,828 --> 01:08:16,496
That's it, that's it.

621
01:08:41,155 --> 01:08:42,189
Fuck.

622
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:47,061
You got a big
mouth, don't you?

623
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:59,106
See and feel that?

624
01:09:13,686 --> 01:09:15,990
Hey, Sheriff.

625
01:09:50,857 --> 01:09:53,527
<i>Hello? Mr. Woods?</i>

626
01:09:54,462 --> 01:09:57,364
<i>Mr. Woods?</i>

627
01:09:57,498 --> 01:09:58,999
<i>Mr. Woods, you there?</i>

628
01:10:48,349 --> 01:10:51,085
Earl, get Lewis.

629
01:10:53,686 --> 01:10:55,655
Get Lewis!

630
01:11:12,705 --> 01:11:15,675
What the hell?
What you doing?

631
01:11:17,111 --> 01:11:18,412
You okay?

632
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:22,849
What the hell's going on?

633
01:11:23,384 --> 01:11:24,817
What... What?

634
01:11:32,493 --> 01:11:33,893
What you doing?

635
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:39,300
- Are you gonna tell me...
- Just drive. Sheriff, okay?

636
01:11:39,433 --> 01:11:40,467
All right, I'm driving.

637
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:44,305
I'm driving. Now you gonna tell
me what the hell's going on?

638
01:11:44,438 --> 01:11:46,407
I don't know. If I knew,
I would tell you.

639
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:49,143
- All I know is they were keeping me prisoner.
- Prisoner?

640
01:11:49,276 --> 01:11:52,346
- Prisoner! Eloise and Earl!
- Eloise and Earl? It can't be.

641
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:55,683
- They're just the sweetest old couple.
- They're evil. I'm telling you.

642
01:11:55,815 --> 01:11:58,586
Evil conjurers, rootworkers,
backwoods fixers.

643
01:11:58,718 --> 01:12:01,255
And they ain't the only ones in on it.
They got big-ass Lewis in on it.

644
01:12:01,388 --> 01:12:05,559
They got a whole cult of these assholes up
here. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

645
01:12:05,693 --> 01:12:08,696
- A cult. Controlling people.
- Controlling people?

646
01:12:08,828 --> 01:12:12,032
It's just that, at the head of the
table, is crazy-ass Eloise.

647
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:14,401
And she's controlling
every single one of them.

648
01:12:14,535 --> 01:12:17,471
The freakiest-ass,
Afro-Appalachian cult you done ever seen.

649
01:12:17,605 --> 01:12:21,041
Well, now hold up there, fella.
I might not be too in-step with the times,

650
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:24,011
but that sounds
downright racist to me.

651
01:12:28,616 --> 01:12:31,252
What? Where are you...

652
01:12:37,258 --> 01:12:41,595
You and your bougie,
pretty-ass wife just wouldn't listen to me.

653
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:43,863
Go on. Get.

654
01:12:44,465 --> 01:12:45,399
Fuck you, man.

655
01:12:45,532 --> 01:12:48,202
Fuck you. Fuck you!

656
01:12:48,868 --> 01:12:50,170
Fuck you!

657
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:57,244
Haul that uppity-ass
city nigga into the barn.

658
01:12:58,878 --> 01:13:00,648
Thank you, Sheriff Pines.

659
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:04,451
If you've had your fun, I think
we can take it from here.

660
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:06,987
That rootwork is starting
to wear a bit thin.

661
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:10,524
- I'd see to it, I was you.
- Now don't you worry, Tom.

662
01:13:10,658 --> 01:13:12,192
I surely will.

663
01:13:12,326 --> 01:13:15,429
We gonna have us
a special power night tonight.

664
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:19,366
Oh, yeah. Everybody's
gonna get a little piece of this.

665
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:23,103
Lewis, go rustle up them folks
at the McFarland farm.

666
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:25,838
Tell them the blood moon is up.

667
01:13:36,984 --> 01:13:38,752
Ah! Veora!

668
01:13:38,885 --> 01:13:40,887
Veora! Sam!

669
01:13:41,021 --> 01:13:43,890
Ty! Hey, hey, it's Dad!

670
01:13:44,024 --> 01:13:46,960
They're not gonna hear you.

671
01:13:48,162 --> 01:13:51,165
I done told you,
you gotta reap what you sow.

672
01:13:59,673 --> 01:14:01,742
Bring me...

673
01:14:01,874 --> 01:14:03,110
that big one up here.

674
01:14:03,243 --> 01:14:05,079
Fetch him up
onto this here table.

675
01:14:10,684 --> 01:14:11,851
Yes!

676
01:14:16,156 --> 01:14:20,127
You think you're better
than everybody else that's here,

677
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,596
Mr. "Gotta See It,
Gotta Feel It."

678
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:27,267
Now, the only thing that
might be better about you

679
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:29,869
than all these people
right here,

680
01:14:30,003 --> 01:14:33,073
- is this heart...
- Yeah!

681
01:14:33,207 --> 01:14:35,609
...beating right here
in your chest!

682
01:14:35,743 --> 01:14:36,944
Yeah!

683
01:14:37,077 --> 01:14:39,313
And in about
the next ten seconds,

684
01:14:39,446 --> 01:14:41,582
you ain't gonna
even have that!

685
01:14:44,884 --> 01:14:46,587
Come on, Ellie.
Bring it on home.

686
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:49,857
Oh, Earl, now you think
you're ready for all this?

687
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:51,225
I'm ready, bring it home.

688
01:14:51,358 --> 01:14:52,693
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

689
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:57,398
You ready?
All right, then. Uh-huh.

690
01:15:02,803 --> 01:15:05,372
Get Lewis! Get Lewis!

691
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:17,284
Pick it up, and push it down.

692
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:21,755
Then push the bad stuff

693
01:15:21,889 --> 01:15:23,657
in the good bottle.

694
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:26,460
And the crazy old witch...

695
01:15:51,285 --> 01:15:54,621
All right, let me see you.
Sam, let me see you.

696
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:56,957
All right? Okay.

697
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:59,526
And my boy, you good?

698
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:00,961
Yeah, I'm good.

699
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:16,009
Follow me.

700
01:16:16,143 --> 01:16:18,278
Where are we going? Marq!

701
01:16:18,412 --> 01:16:21,615
Okay, Sam, Ty, find whatever you
can, put it in front of the door,

702
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:23,183
so they think
we're barricading in.

703
01:16:23,317 --> 01:16:24,818
- Come on, come on.
- Okay.

704
01:16:24,953 --> 01:16:26,887
I need you all to get out.
Follow the river.

705
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:29,990
I found us a car,
get us out of here. Hey.

706
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:32,893
I'm sorry.

707
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,262
You're all safe now.

708
01:16:35,395 --> 01:16:37,331
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

709
01:16:57,919 --> 01:17:00,754
Jesus. Fuck.

710
01:17:14,701 --> 01:17:16,503
I tried to warn you.

711
01:17:17,804 --> 01:17:20,975
Why don't you come out
and show yourself, boy?

712
01:17:21,108 --> 01:17:23,577
Huh?

713
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:26,680
You want some?
Come on and get it.

714
01:17:27,949 --> 01:17:29,316
Come on!

715
01:17:29,816 --> 01:17:31,051
Come on, boy!

716
01:17:32,886 --> 01:17:34,087
Where you at, boy?

717
01:17:38,058 --> 01:17:39,526
Where you at, boy?

718
01:18:15,762 --> 01:18:20,367
Come on! Come on!
Get him, get him!

719
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,303
Go get him! Go get him!

720
01:18:23,437 --> 01:18:26,273
Go. You get him.
You get him, Lewis!

721
01:18:28,175 --> 01:18:30,344
You stay there!

722
01:18:30,912 --> 01:18:32,179
You get him!

723
01:19:13,153 --> 01:19:14,688
Lewis?

724
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:48,122
Clever.

725
01:19:48,255 --> 01:19:54,461
Very clever, Mr. "Gotta See
It, Gotta Feel It."

726
01:19:56,830 --> 01:20:00,200
I guess that's why
I hide my Boogity,

727
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:02,170
where no one can mess with it.

728
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:17,484
Now, you see that, Ms. Ellie?

729
01:20:19,519 --> 01:20:21,521
That's why I made my own.

730
01:20:48,782 --> 01:20:50,417
Is that it?

731
01:20:53,487 --> 01:20:57,257
You're just gonna let
an old lady burn?

732
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:08,568
You taught me a lot, Ms. Ellie.

733
01:21:09,103 --> 01:21:10,904
And so did my pops.

734
01:21:42,335 --> 01:21:45,472
If it can keep the devil out,
it sure as hell ought to keep you in.

735
01:21:46,007 --> 01:21:49,243
No! No!

736
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:02,622
If you people get back,
I don't have to use these Boogitys.

737
01:22:04,891 --> 01:22:08,895
Everybody get back.
Let him through.

738
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:11,731
Let him through.

739
01:24:17,857 --> 01:24:20,660
<i>I put you up, I put you down.</i>

740
01:24:20,794 --> 01:24:23,965
<i>I put you sideways
and I spin you around.</i>
