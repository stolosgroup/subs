00:00:27,336 --> 00:00:29,005
Turn to the right,
milady.

4
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:30,405
Thank you.

5
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:37,312
That's it.

6
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:09,444
Hear ye,
hear ye, hear ye!

7
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:14,751
Lords! Knights! Squires!

8
00:01:14,818 --> 00:01:17,887
And all other
manner of people.

9
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:21,858
That by the command of Our
Lord, the king of France,

10
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:25,661
it is strictly prohibited,

11
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:29,631
on pain of death
and the loss of property,

12
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:32,501
for anyone here
to be armed,

13
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:34,871
or to carry
a sword or dagger

14
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:38,842
unless he be one who has
the express permission

15
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,543
of Our Lord, the king.

16
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:45,849
Each man is to fight

17
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:48,718
on horseback and on foot,

18
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:50,452
armed in the manner
that pleases him,

19
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,689
with any weapon or device
of attack or defense.

20
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:58,560
Except for weapons or
devices of equal design

21
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:02,431
or made with
charms or spells

22
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,035
or any other thing that is
forbidden by God and holy church

23
00:02:06,102 --> 00:02:07,971
to all good Christians.

24
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:12,574
If either combatant should
carry onto the field of battle

25
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:16,112
any arms that have been
forged with spells,

26
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:19,949
charms, enchantments,
or any other evil arts,

27
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:23,953
then so shall the malefactor
be punished as an enemy of God

28
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:26,622
or as a traitor

29
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:29,893
or as a murderer.

30
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:34,163
- Tighter. Tighter.
- <i>Monsieur.</i>

31
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:32,454
Knights, proceed.

32
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:02,952
Let them go!

33
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:06,889
Let them go! Let them go!

34
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:35,284
Come for your fight!

35
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:37,686
You're all gonna die!

36
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,858
You're all gonna die
like pigs!

37
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:45,928
Come on, then!

38
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,798
Come on, you failed scum...

39
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:49,932
We cannot
just sit here.

40
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,234
...and fight!

41
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:53,535
Jean, we were ordered by
Pierre to hold this bridge.

42
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:55,537
Orders be damned.
For the king.

43
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,841
For the king!

44
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,810
For the king!

45
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:42,952
Thank you.

46
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:53,595
I will make no apology
for how you men fought today.

47
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:56,766
It was an honor
to be there with you.

48
00:05:58,201 --> 00:06:00,903
Limoges is lost.

49
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,773
And our allies have failed
to take the port at Brest.

50
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,176
Our new Lord, Pierre,

51
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:10,880
has now resigned the campaign
and orders us home.

52
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,982
We move at dawn.

53
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:15,084
Hear, hear.

54
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:16,119
To the king.

55
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:21,257
Evidently,
Pierre is not happy.

56
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,161
Lives were saved.

57
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:27,396
Not in Limoges.

58
00:06:27,463 --> 00:06:29,832
Let us return home,
my friend.

59
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,735
You saved
my life today.

60
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:36,139
Thank you.

61
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:13,309
Declare yourself!

62
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:16,212
Squire Jean de Carrouges.

63
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,347
Son of the captain
of this fort.

64
00:07:18,414 --> 00:07:20,049
Open the gates!

65
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:38,201
It's a great honor
for Pierre

66
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:40,169
to have chosen your father's
castle for this ceremony.

67
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:42,805
I shall be prepared
to assume this captaincy

68
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:44,907
upon my father's passing.

69
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:46,375
Pray it is not
for many years.

70
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:48,711
Father. Mother.

71
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,746
Captain. Milady.

72
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:52,481
Squires.

73
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:54,350
Do not keep Our
Lord Pierre waiting.

74
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:56,018
...become your man.
I shall serve you for life.

75
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:03,025
So, Lord, I become your man.
I swear I shall serve you for life.

76
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:08,898
Milord, I become your man.
I shall serve you for life.

77
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:11,734
Milord, I become your man.
I swear I shall serve you for life.

78
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,810
Lord, I become your man.
I swear I shall serve you for life.

79
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:29,218
- Lord...
- Closer.

80
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,290
Lord,
I become your man.

81
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:36,292
I swear I shall
serve you for life.

82
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:52,541
Declare yourself.

83
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:55,978
It is I.
Helen of Troy.

84
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,483
Le Gris.

85
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:03,819
It's good to see
you, my friend.

86
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,490
Though I do not come
only as a friend.

87
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:12,295
I'm afraid there's more to
my visit than I have let on.

88
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:17,566
Speak.

89
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:23,239
Pierre has charged me with
the collection of debts.

90
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:25,408
I see.

91
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:29,045
I have already visited all the
other tenants in his domain.

92
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,181
And now...

93
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:33,349
You have come
to see me.

94
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,384
I have come
to see you.

95
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:43,359
These levies are
for military defense.

96
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:45,928
And you know as well as
anyone our enemy's present.

97
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:47,296
And we need to be ready.

98
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:48,898
When have I not been ready to
stand and fight for my king?

99
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,499
You have.

100
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:53,202
More than any other.

101
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:54,937
But that's not all
this Pierre wants.

102
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:56,205
No, what Pierre wants...

103
00:09:56,272 --> 00:09:58,074
Pierre wants the money
that he's rightfully owed.

104
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,382
I don't have it.

105
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:08,517
This plague has carried
off half my workforce.

106
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:10,152
My rent collection
is down.

107
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:11,620
My fields yield half
what they used to.

108
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:14,023
And the cost of labor
has now risen.

109
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,891
Yes.

110
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:21,464
How is it the other
vassals paid?

111
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,866
They paid because
I had to insist.

112
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,102
I see.

113
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,237
And now,
you insist upon me?

114
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,576
Let me talk to Pierre.

115
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:38,314
He's not without reason.

116
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:40,116
I will explain
your situation.

117
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,185
You are a true friend.

118
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:45,554
But I cannot return
empty-handed.

119
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:47,089
Of course not.

120
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:51,093
Thank you.

121
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:54,230
Let me see
what I have at hand.

122
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:17,686
- Think about this.
- I have.

123
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:18,988
You have not.

124
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:20,489
I will be fighting
under Admiral de Vienne.

125
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:23,292
The English are looting the
Cotentin Peninsula as we speak.

126
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,960
This plague has taken
your wife and son.

127
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:26,095
I will not stand by
whilst Lower Normandy falls.

128
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:27,630
Do not let
this obduracy take you.

129
00:11:27,697 --> 00:11:29,131
You have no heir.

130
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:31,333
If you die, all you have
will revert to Count Pierre.

131
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:34,537
A fact not lost on
Pierre, I'm certain.

132
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:36,205
He does not favor me
as he does you.

133
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:37,473
No,
you have much to live for.

134
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,408
What do I have to live for, here?
What?

135
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:41,143
A name.

136
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,080
It's too great and storied a name
for you to treat it so recklessly.

137
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:47,383
Your father has
the captaincy of Belleme.

138
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,251
When he dies,
you will inherit that garrison

139
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:50,553
and everything that
comes with it.

140
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:53,155
And I am your friend.

141
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:56,525
And there are many others like me
who would prefer you not perish.

142
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:01,697
I don't embark on this
campaign recklessly.

143
00:12:01,765 --> 00:12:03,499
I don't embark on it
just to fight.

144
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,401
Then why?

145
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:08,037
Jacques.

146
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:11,674
I am

147
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,310
broke.

148
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:17,346
I need money.

149
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,235
Long live the king!

150
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:16,539
Long live the king!

151
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,625
They're back!
Quick! Come on! They're back!

152
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,106
I'll take
that from you.

153
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:52,842
Let me help you, sir.

154
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:54,744
Turn around,
please, my lord.

155
00:13:57,814 --> 00:13:59,716
Lift, lift your arm.

156
00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:03,519
Take them more bread.

157
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:05,254
Over here.
They want some more.

158
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:26,308
Robert de Thibouville.

159
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,211
He's providing shelter
and vittles for us.

160
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,816
De Thibouville?

161
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:35,651
Did he not side with the
English against us at Poitiers?

162
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:38,354
Yes, but he was pardoned
along with the others.

163
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,189
He's with us now.

164
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,591
And he'll stay that way if
he knows what's good for him.

165
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:43,893
Steady, Jean.

166
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,829
It's a roof
over our heads.

167
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:47,663
Besides,

168
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:50,132
he has quite
the wine cellar.

169
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:07,349
What a beauty.

170
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:10,653
She is
a de Thibouville?

171
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,389
Yes. Her name is
even older than yours.

172
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,424
She's his only daughter.

173
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:17,593
There's a dowry
to be had.

174
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,895
Of course, a man would
have to bear the mark

175
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:20,462
of her father's
disgrace...

176
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:23,465
I don't imagine one
would suffer too greatly

177
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:25,300
at the task of
producing an heir.

178
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:29,672
Gentlemen, welcome.

179
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:31,407
You fought bravely.

180
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:33,843
Thank you for hosting us.

181
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,846
- I would like to introduce...
- Jean de Carrouges.

182
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:38,715
Your reputation
precedes you.

183
00:15:38,782 --> 00:15:40,817
As does yours.

184
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:44,486
It's my pleasure to
host you and your men.

185
00:15:44,553 --> 00:15:47,489
It is only just to support the
men who fight for the king.

186
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,861
Some lessons are learned
later in life, hmm?

187
00:15:54,898 --> 00:15:56,800
Allow me to introduce
my daughter.

188
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:58,400
Marguerite.

189
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:01,336
Marguerite, this is
Squire Jean de Carrouges.

190
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,240
Milady, I'm pleased
to meet you.

191
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:07,844
Pleasure is mine.

192
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,925
The dowry
includes this parcel as well.

193
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:24,626
Starting at
the hunting grounds.

194
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:32,534
What of this here?
The one to the north?

195
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:35,237
Aunou-le-Faucon.

196
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:42,511
As I say, starting at
the hunting grounds.

197
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:55,691
I'll have
that piece of land as well.

198
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,627
Most certainly.

199
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,912
Amen.

200
00:17:57,486 --> 00:18:00,023
I'm a very
jealous man, milady.

201
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:03,325
Tonight, you are mine and
will dance with no other.

202
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:06,896
And every night
hereafter.

203
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:44,600
No need to worry.

204
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:51,040
This is it.

205
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:59,082
Property starts
at the river mouth

206
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:02,451
and extends all the way
to the hill beyond.

207
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,420
So, this is
Aunou-le-Faucon.

208
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:08,457
This was meant to be
part of Marguerite's dowry.

209
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,425
She loved it here.

210
00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:12,594
And Pierre simply
gave it to you.

211
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,931
In appreciation
of my service.

212
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:19,102
His accounts were
in complete chaos.

213
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:22,105
Once I was able to reorder
them and collect the rents due,

214
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:25,407
everything started functioning
properly, and his fortunes turned.

215
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:28,610
Gave me this as a
sign of his gratitude.

216
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:34,717
It's not my doing.

217
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:36,886
The count is generous
and impetuous.

218
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:44,593
Let us eat.

219
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:55,972
I wish you'd seen
the gardens at Aunou-le-Faucon.

220
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,808
We had roses and lavender.

221
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,944
Then, we shall
have those here.

222
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,814
I remember my father built a swing
on the largest tree in the estate.

223
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:09,052
I will find the largest
tree and do the same.

224
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:12,055
I have such wonderful
memories of my summers there.

225
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:19,729
It's a pity Pierre
took that estate from your father.

226
00:20:19,796 --> 00:20:21,798
I know you miss it.

227
00:20:21,864 --> 00:20:25,902
It's the only way he
could pay what he owed.

228
00:20:25,969 --> 00:20:29,706
Pierre then just gave it
to Jacques Le Gris as a gift.

229
00:20:30,672 --> 00:20:33,209
Do all squires enjoy
such lavish gifts?

230
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:36,678
Le Gris more
than most.

231
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:39,581
He has become
Pierre's most trusted.

232
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:44,187
Perhaps Aunou-le-Faucon
is not gone for good.

233
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:48,690
Perhaps I shall not
let that rest.

234
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:52,095
Jean.

235
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:54,263
My love, I have
bled for this king.

236
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:56,265
He knows of me.

237
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,136
I may have more power
than you think.

238
00:21:00,203 --> 00:21:02,637
I know how powerful
you are.

239
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:09,812
This land was promised to me
as part of my wife's dowry.

240
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,950
The petition
is denied.

241
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:18,087
This decision comes directly
from His Majesty, the king.

242
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:32,667
Are you
Squire Jean de Carrouges?

243
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:33,936
That is I.

244
00:21:35,938 --> 00:21:37,140
What does it say?

245
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:38,607
'Tis your father.

246
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,690
Open the gate!

247
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:57,093
Open the gate!

248
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:01,596
Leave us.

249
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:11,941
I was in Paris
when the news came.

250
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:16,746
Your father died quietly.

251
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:18,214
In his sleep.

252
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,185
I am lost.

253
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:26,255
They tell me I'm to leave
here within a month.

254
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:31,294
You will do
no such thing.

255
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,296
I will assume
the captaincy.

256
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:34,997
You will keep your
quarters, your servants.

257
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:36,132
Everything will be
the way it was...

258
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:38,101
Jean, have you
not heard?

259
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,369
You're not going to follow
in your father's footsteps

260
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:43,072
as captain here
at Belleme.

261
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:45,208
What do you mean?

262
00:22:45,274 --> 00:22:49,345
Why did you have to sue the
count for a piece of land?

263
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:51,380
Just to impress
your bride.

264
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:54,283
That land was promised to me.
It was an appeal.

265
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,352
And now, you've made an
enemy of Count Pierre.

266
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:57,920
It was right.

267
00:22:57,987 --> 00:23:01,690
Right.
There's no right.

268
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:04,093
There is only
the power of men.

269
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:09,832
You sued him,
and you've made a powerful enemy.

270
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:13,703
Your father was
a hard man

271
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,973
but there was much about this
world that he understood.

272
00:23:21,277 --> 00:23:26,349
Who then will assume
my father's captaincy?

273
00:23:59,148 --> 00:24:00,383
Good day!

274
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:04,187
Join us, my squire.

275
00:24:04,253 --> 00:24:05,855
This is a day
for celebration.

276
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:11,727
I will not be
staying, milord.

277
00:24:11,794 --> 00:24:14,397
I do not wish to interrupt
such an occasion,

278
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:18,334
but my honor
compels me to speak.

279
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:25,107
I was angered,
but I spoke well.

280
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:26,943
I said to Pierre,

281
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,313
"Can you stand there,
as a man of honor, as my liege lord,

282
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:33,316
"and say that I am not man enough
to assume my rightful captaincy

283
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:37,486
"that my grandfather and my father
held for the last 20 years of his life

284
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:39,155
"and take command
of that garrison

285
00:24:39,222 --> 00:24:41,791
"and hold the fort of
Belleme for my king?"

286
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:42,959
And what said Pierre?

287
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,894
And there was Le Gris,

288
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:48,197
whose life I saved,
sitting by his side

289
00:24:48,264 --> 00:24:51,234
with his captaincy,
not even man enough to look at me.

290
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:54,904
He poisons milord
with evil advice.

291
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,273
Whispered in his ear,
blackening my name.

292
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:01,477
Surely, you did not
say this.

293
00:25:03,813 --> 00:25:05,815
You did.

294
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,388
We are no longer welcome
at court.

295
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:14,390
Jean...

296
00:25:14,457 --> 00:25:15,491
So be it.

297
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:35,911
Milord.

298
00:25:35,978 --> 00:25:37,880
Jean, an invitation
has arrived.

299
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:43,085
Your friend Jean Crespin
has invited us to his home.

300
00:25:43,152 --> 00:25:45,488
They are celebrating the
birth of their first child.

301
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:48,457
It's a boy.

302
00:25:48,524 --> 00:25:50,459
Oh, wonderful news.

303
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:52,228
It's been a year
since Belleme.

304
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,498
Perhaps we may
show our faces

305
00:25:55,564 --> 00:25:58,200
so they know we carry on
in spite of this injustice.

306
00:25:59,435 --> 00:26:01,937
A healthy child
in these times

307
00:26:02,004 --> 00:26:04,106
is cause for
a celebration.

308
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:10,479
Do you think I would deny
the rabble of Argentan

309
00:26:10,546 --> 00:26:13,082
the sight of
a true noblewoman?

310
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,319
Have a gown made.

311
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:30,199
This one is ready.
We need more hay over here.

312
00:27:00,262 --> 00:27:02,365
I am very glad
you chose to attend.

313
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:05,368
This will only do you
good, my love.

314
00:27:05,434 --> 00:27:08,070
Jean, I'm very pleased to see you.
It's been a long time.

315
00:27:08,137 --> 00:27:10,005
Congratulations, my friend.

316
00:27:10,072 --> 00:27:11,540
- Milady, you look lovely.
- Thank you.

317
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:13,509
Please, you're
most welcome.

318
00:27:31,994 --> 00:27:33,396
Pardon me, milady.

319
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:48,010
- Le Gris.
- Carrouges.

320
00:27:48,077 --> 00:27:51,380
Pax! Well done!
Well done, all!

321
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:53,983
Let there be no ill will among
the servants of the king.

322
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,117
He needs us all
right now.

323
00:27:55,184 --> 00:27:57,920
Hear, hear.
Well spoken, old friend.

324
00:27:57,987 --> 00:27:59,121
Marguerite, come.

325
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:00,389
Give our old friend
a kiss

326
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:03,025
and show the good faith
of the house Carrouges.

327
00:28:25,114 --> 00:28:27,349
I will return in just a few
months, my love.

328
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,719
I will be safe and well attended
to by Alice and your mother,

329
00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:31,220
but I will miss you.

330
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:32,321
This is what I do.

331
00:28:33,222 --> 00:28:34,423
Let me provide for you.

332
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,459
And what of you?

333
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:38,494
I have all
that I need.

334
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:40,229
Except an heir.

335
00:28:40,696 --> 00:28:41,731
My love.

336
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,668
It comes
as God wills it.

337
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:15,331
Be thou a knight
in the name of God.

338
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:17,466
Rise.

339
00:29:19,568 --> 00:29:21,303
Jean de Carrouges!

340
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:25,441
In honor of your service
to our king.

341
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:30,546
Quiet!

342
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:37,553
Be thou a knight
in the name of God.

343
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,355
Rise.

344
00:29:47,296 --> 00:29:51,300
All right, men!
Make preparations for battle!

345
00:30:08,551 --> 00:30:09,685
Sire?

346
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:31,507
Why do they run?

347
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:33,609
Why do they run?

348
00:30:36,846 --> 00:30:38,514
For the king!

349
00:30:51,193 --> 00:30:53,596
Our lord returns!

350
00:30:53,662 --> 00:30:55,497
They're coming!

351
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:58,100
Our lord returns!

352
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,636
Our lord returns!

353
00:31:05,274 --> 00:31:07,443
Our lord returns!

354
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:09,111
He's coming!

355
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,459
Welcome back, sire!

356
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:59,194
Milord,
you are not well.

357
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:03,399
This fever is all I've brought back
from that wretched place.

358
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:05,300
As well as
your knighthood.

359
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:08,337
Tomorrow,
I must go to Paris.

360
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:10,639
I'll be away one week.

361
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:11,741
What do you want?

362
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:13,409
I'm owed money
by the treasurer.

363
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:14,811
Jean, you are unwell.

364
00:32:14,878 --> 00:32:16,512
He's well enough
to travel.

365
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,948
To Paris?

366
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:20,582
That's three days' ride.

367
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,451
And Argentan.

368
00:32:22,518 --> 00:32:24,954
Duty demands that
I report to Pierre.

369
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:28,457
They will admire you
as a knight.

370
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:30,727
And you will confound

371
00:32:30,794 --> 00:32:32,929
those who had not expected
you to return, Sir Jean.

372
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:48,637
Sir Jean de Carrouges?

373
00:33:54,911 --> 00:33:56,678
Signature here.

374
00:34:06,723 --> 00:34:08,390
300 gold pieces.

375
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,447
Sire.

376
00:35:03,947 --> 00:35:05,849
I will be
in my chamber.

377
00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:08,117
Good night.

378
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:15,691
My love?

379
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,797
What is the matter?

380
00:35:20,864 --> 00:35:22,899
Has my mother quarreled
with you yet again?

381
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,435
No.

382
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:34,711
I have missed you.

383
00:35:39,548 --> 00:35:42,451
Did you not miss me?

384
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,153
I missed you
more than you know.

385
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,421
Then let us go to bed.

386
00:35:46,488 --> 00:35:48,091
- What? What is it, my love?
- I...

387
00:35:55,664 --> 00:35:56,966
Uh...

388
00:36:01,037 --> 00:36:05,407
Uh, When...
When you were gone, there was a day

389
00:36:05,474 --> 00:36:08,477
when your mother had
business in Saint Pierre.

390
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:09,645
Yes.

391
00:36:11,981 --> 00:36:16,819
She took the servants with her on
her errand, and I was left alone.

392
00:36:17,586 --> 00:36:19,155
Did she not
leave Alice?

393
00:36:19,222 --> 00:36:20,757
I told her in
no uncertain terms.

394
00:36:20,823 --> 00:36:22,892
She took
all the servants.

395
00:36:27,063 --> 00:36:30,199
Shortly after,
a man came unannounced.

396
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:34,469
I knew the man,
so I let him in.

397
00:36:35,537 --> 00:36:37,040
But he was not alone.

398
00:36:41,811 --> 00:36:43,512
He attacked me.

399
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:51,020
He pinned me down,
I protested.

400
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:54,857
I screamed, I cried out as best I
could, but there was no one here.

401
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:59,028
I was overpowered.
There was nothing I could do.

402
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:08,972
I was raped.

403
00:37:11,207 --> 00:37:13,675
Who? Who did this?

404
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,610
Who?

405
00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:17,780
Jacques Le Gris.

406
00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:27,156
Are you telling me
the truth?

407
00:37:27,223 --> 00:37:28,958
Yes. Yes.

408
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:30,026
Are you telling me
the truth?

409
00:37:30,093 --> 00:37:31,094
Yes, I am telling you
the truth.

410
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,829
You must believe me.

411
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:35,664
You must.

412
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:39,668
You are my beloved.

413
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:40,737
Here.

414
00:37:43,672 --> 00:37:45,574
I was not here
to protect you.

415
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,113
Please forgive me.

416
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:53,515
Please.

417
00:37:53,983 --> 00:37:55,251
Jean.

418
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:59,621
I want him to answer
for what he has done.

419
00:38:00,256 --> 00:38:01,724
And he will.

420
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:05,962
He will.

421
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,838
Collect the swords!

422
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:17,140
Show them in, please.

423
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:19,275
Take the horses down.

424
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:21,978
Move them aside.

425
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:24,747
Show them in, please.

426
00:38:24,814 --> 00:38:27,016
<i>And so,
I ask for your help.</i>

427
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:30,319
Marguerite is my wife,
and she has been wronged.

428
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:34,190
I will not allow this
to go unpunished.

429
00:38:34,257 --> 00:38:37,126
Your only avenue
is through Pierre.

430
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:39,062
Though I doubt he will
give you a hearing.

431
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:44,000
Tell the story
you've heard today.

432
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:46,869
Tell it anywhere you can
and to all who will listen.

433
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:49,072
We will be the subject
of gossip.

434
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:52,341
If the story is known
across Normandy,

435
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:54,576
Pierre will have to
grant us a hearing.

436
00:38:56,813 --> 00:38:58,147
I have a plan.

437
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,156
I request a duel to the death.

438
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:10,893
This custom was outlawed
years ago.

439
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:13,595
Not so, Your Grace.

440
00:39:13,662 --> 00:39:17,300
It is true that no duels have
been fought during your lifetime,

441
00:39:17,366 --> 00:39:20,069
though it remains
acceptable as a venue...

442
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:21,938
It would require
a full convening

443
00:39:22,004 --> 00:39:24,006
of the assembled
parliamentary body of Paris.

444
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:26,843
All 32 members of
Your Majesty's court.

445
00:39:27,376 --> 00:39:28,978
One of us has lied.

446
00:39:30,012 --> 00:39:31,613
Let us let God decide.

447
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,851
Sir Jean, if you
lose this duel,

448
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:38,087
thus proving these
accusations false,

449
00:39:38,154 --> 00:39:40,389
your wife would suffer
dire consequences.

450
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:44,827
God will spare those
who tell the truth.

451
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:46,695
And the truth
will prevail.

452
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,065
I am not afraid.

453
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,400
Excellent.

454
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:25,700
His Majesty,
King Charles VI!

455
00:40:25,768 --> 00:40:29,005
What is your
business today before this court?

456
00:40:42,952 --> 00:40:45,121
Most excellent
and powerful king

457
00:40:45,188 --> 00:40:46,289
and our sovereign lord,

458
00:40:47,757 --> 00:40:49,825
I present myself,

459
00:40:49,892 --> 00:40:51,727
Jean de Carrouges,

460
00:40:51,794 --> 00:40:52,995
knight,

461
00:40:54,263 --> 00:40:56,399
as an appellant
in your court

462
00:40:57,867 --> 00:41:02,071
and hereby do
accuse this squire

463
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:04,440
of a most foul crime

464
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:06,742
against my wife,

465
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:09,779
the Lady Marguerite de
Carrouges.

466
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:13,249
I charge that during the third
week of this January past,

467
00:41:13,316 --> 00:41:15,218
this same Jacques Le Gris

468
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:18,321
did feloniously

469
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:20,156
and carnally

470
00:41:20,223 --> 00:41:24,193
take my wife against
her will in our house.

471
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:29,799
And if this said
Jacques Le Gris

472
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:32,368
denies his crime,

473
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:35,404
I stand ready

474
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:39,242
to prove my charge by
my body against his

475
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:43,079
and to render him dead
at an appointed time.

476
00:42:00,997 --> 00:42:03,866
Come for your fight!

477
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:06,068
You're all gonna die!

478
00:42:07,036 --> 00:42:09,538
You're all gonna
die like pigs!

479
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,843
Come on, then!

480
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:16,345
Come on,
you failed scum...

481
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:17,513
We cannot just sit here.

482
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,115
...and fight!

483
00:42:19,182 --> 00:42:21,484
Jean, we were ordered by
Pierre to hold this bridge.

484
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,551
Orders be damned.

485
00:42:22,618 --> 00:42:24,220
They're baiting
you, Jean.

486
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:26,055
They want us to leave the
bridge so they can take Limoges.

487
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:30,926
Then they shall
have their wish!

488
00:42:32,328 --> 00:42:33,963
My son is a fool.
Let him go!

489
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,364
If he goes alone,
he will die.

490
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:37,133
For the king!

491
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,334
For the king!

492
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,165
I know he is stubborn.

493
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:11,233
Yes, stubborn,
difficult, jealous,

494
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,203
- rash, dimwitted, irascible, dimwitted...
- Yes. Yes, yes, I know, milord.

495
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,372
...stupid. He does not exactly
yield his rents on time.

496
00:43:16,439 --> 00:43:18,274
But I count him
as a friend.

497
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:22,144
He disobeyed me
and let Limoges fall.

498
00:43:22,211 --> 00:43:25,581
He believed he would succeed.
His intentions were good.

499
00:43:25,648 --> 00:43:28,584
He's no fucking fun.

500
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:32,355
You mean, you'd like to see more
of his gloom here in Argentan?

501
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:35,224
He postures and mopes about
like a black cloud.

502
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:39,195
Milord, I have fought with him and
seen the worst of this world with him.

503
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:41,497
He is loyal.

504
00:43:41,564 --> 00:43:43,599
Yeah. So are my
fucking hounds.

505
00:43:46,135 --> 00:43:48,904
As you wish. Take your leave.
Do as you like.

506
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:51,474
I think very little
of his character.

507
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,576
However, I think
a great deal of yours.

508
00:43:53,642 --> 00:43:56,479
It's the quality that most
recommends you.

509
00:43:56,545 --> 00:43:58,614
But do not let your loyalty
blind you.

510
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,351
- Thank you, milord.
- Yes.

511
00:44:03,986 --> 00:44:05,654
Le Gris?

512
00:44:05,722 --> 00:44:08,557
The gold? Or the sandal?

513
00:44:09,558 --> 00:44:11,060
- Gold.
- Indeed.

514
00:44:11,127 --> 00:44:12,228
The gold.

515
00:44:25,107 --> 00:44:27,076
No, no.
I know, I know...

516
00:44:31,447 --> 00:44:33,215
Ladies and gentlemen.

517
00:44:37,586 --> 00:44:39,388
Ladies and gentlemen.

518
00:44:39,455 --> 00:44:44,527
Under ordinary circumstances,
your hostess, the viscountess,

519
00:44:44,593 --> 00:44:48,431
my wife,
Lady Marie Chamaillart,

520
00:44:48,497 --> 00:44:51,333
would see the sun come
up with all of us,

521
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,502
sing louder,
dance more

522
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:55,037
and drink you all
under the table.

523
00:44:56,439 --> 00:44:59,208
However, she's fast at work
growing our eighth child

524
00:44:59,275 --> 00:45:01,177
in 14 years of marriage.

525
00:45:05,481 --> 00:45:07,683
Well, good night,
dear friends.

526
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:10,119
I shall wait up for
absolutely none of you.

527
00:45:10,186 --> 00:45:12,421
Especially my husband.

528
00:45:13,322 --> 00:45:14,390
Good night, dear.

529
00:45:14,457 --> 00:45:16,192
My love.

530
00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:17,259
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

531
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,961
Good night.

532
00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:27,336
Well, now,
perhaps the evening can truly begin.

533
00:45:29,438 --> 00:45:30,506
Where were we?

534
00:45:30,573 --> 00:45:33,042
Uh... Latour, read.

535
00:45:33,743 --> 00:45:36,612
I do not read Latin.

536
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:39,048
You do not even read.

537
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:41,350
I will read.
<i>The Book of Love.</i>

538
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:44,320
- Ooh.
- Rule number 24.

539
00:45:49,793 --> 00:45:51,093
Anyone?

540
00:45:54,096 --> 00:45:55,331
Squire?

541
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:02,137
"A new love
expels an old one."

542
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:07,576
Too true.

543
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:11,313
Well, it appears we have a
squire with a hidden talent.

544
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,615
Read, do read.

545
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:18,420
Uh...

546
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,325
The rule
of love number four.

547
00:46:23,392 --> 00:46:26,362
"Love is always growing,

548
00:46:27,196 --> 00:46:28,264
"or diminishing."

549
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,232
Insolent bastard!

550
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:33,602
He knows you.

551
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:46,081
"Nothing prevents a
woman from being loved by two men.

552
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,757
"Or a man from being
loved by two women."

553
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,161
Well read.

554
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:04,233
Oh. Come, come.

555
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,602
If you run,
I will only chase you.

556
00:47:13,342 --> 00:47:15,678
Wow, he grows serious.

557
00:47:15,745 --> 00:47:18,815
No! No! No!

558
00:47:18,882 --> 00:47:20,349
No!

559
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,623
No! No! No!

560
00:47:31,627 --> 00:47:34,096
No! No! No!

561
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:41,537
This customer is rough.

562
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:43,505
No!

563
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:44,774
And strong.

564
00:47:46,843 --> 00:47:49,713
Here, come take
some evil inside you.

565
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:54,249
- Pierre!
- Oh.

566
00:47:54,316 --> 00:47:55,351
Come, Pierre.

567
00:47:55,919 --> 00:47:57,186
Great!

568
00:47:57,252 --> 00:47:58,320
Pierre.

569
00:47:58,387 --> 00:47:59,588
Pierre.

570
00:48:06,328 --> 00:48:07,596
Life is good.

571
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:12,434
The wolves
have not slept, either.

572
00:48:14,403 --> 00:48:16,271
Your wife will
awaken soon, milord.

573
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,341
Best be in there
when she does.

574
00:48:19,408 --> 00:48:21,143
Pregnant and hysterical.

575
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,912
I prefer to take my chances
with the wolves.

576
00:48:25,214 --> 00:48:27,784
So, tell me, squire,

577
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:31,186
how does a man of war
become so learned in letters?

578
00:48:31,253 --> 00:48:33,689
I was born with neither
a name nor wealth.

579
00:48:33,757 --> 00:48:36,225
I prepared for
a life in the church.

580
00:48:37,593 --> 00:48:39,361
The requirements

581
00:48:40,596 --> 00:48:41,765
did not suit me.

582
00:48:41,831 --> 00:48:43,599
No, no.

583
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,401
A libertine after
my own heart.

584
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:46,702
That always
came to me easily.

585
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,807
Does that knowledge
also apply to numbers?

586
00:48:51,808 --> 00:48:53,743
It does, milord.

587
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:56,679
Then let me share this with
you, and this stays between us.

588
00:48:56,746 --> 00:48:58,213
Of course.

589
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,950
My accounts are in disarray.

590
00:49:01,017 --> 00:49:03,887
Would you mind bringing your
expertise to bear on my finances?

591
00:49:06,555 --> 00:49:08,758
How can this be?

592
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:13,362
Rents are late to come in.
The accountants are careless.

593
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:17,266
Milord, these nobles are holding the money
that they are meant to yield up to you.

594
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:19,301
The plague has carried off
half our workforce.

595
00:49:19,368 --> 00:49:21,270
Crop yields are down.
Labor costs are up.

596
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:22,404
I understand the numbers,

597
00:49:22,471 --> 00:49:24,908
and absolutely none of
this is your concern.

598
00:49:24,975 --> 00:49:27,509
You need to be prepared to raise
an army at a moment's notice.

599
00:49:27,576 --> 00:49:30,345
None of this works
if you're not solvent.

600
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:33,282
And when they say
they do not have it?

601
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:35,417
Well, let them
say that to me.

602
00:49:35,484 --> 00:49:37,954
Well, then.

603
00:49:50,332 --> 00:49:51,835
I was trying to have a word
with your lord.

604
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:55,270
This matter is between us.
Do not interrupt me again.

605
00:49:55,337 --> 00:49:56,305
All right,
let us look at the map.

606
00:49:57,406 --> 00:49:58,440
Shall we?

607
00:50:02,478 --> 00:50:04,914
There is, of course,
my property here at Bourg.

608
00:50:05,915 --> 00:50:09,018
No.
My good man, no.

609
00:50:09,085 --> 00:50:11,386
What's this here?

610
00:50:11,453 --> 00:50:12,488
Aunou-le-Faucon.

611
00:50:13,489 --> 00:50:14,523
No.

612
00:50:15,424 --> 00:50:17,827
It's one of my most
valuable estates.

613
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:26,002
It is to be part of
my daughter's dowry.

614
00:50:29,706 --> 00:50:33,509
I cannot just
give it to him.

615
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:38,748
My friend, Pierre's not asking you
to give him your finest estate.

616
00:50:38,815 --> 00:50:41,951
But Aunou-le-Faucon
is worth twice what I owe.

617
00:50:42,018 --> 00:50:45,354
Well, think of how good it will
feel to be completely without debt.

618
00:51:15,051 --> 00:51:17,452
Have you heard?
Reports from the north.

619
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:19,856
They say there's a father
so desperate,

620
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:23,325
he'll marry his own daughter
to Jean de Carrouges.

621
00:51:23,726 --> 00:51:24,961
Indeed?

622
00:51:25,028 --> 00:51:28,430
Yes, Robert de Thibouville,
the traitor.

623
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:32,367
Carrouges needs an heir.

624
00:51:32,434 --> 00:51:34,904
Is she the only
noblewoman in Normandy?

625
00:51:34,971 --> 00:51:36,605
He needs money as well.

626
00:51:36,672 --> 00:51:38,607
There's much
to recommend her.

627
00:51:38,674 --> 00:51:42,344
She's rich, young.
They say she's beautiful.

628
00:51:42,411 --> 00:51:44,446
Yes, and her father
betrayed the Crown.

629
00:51:44,513 --> 00:51:46,582
I make no apologies
for Robert de Thibouville.

630
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:49,585
Yeah. Only a shame he wasn't
beheaded for his treason.

631
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:52,989
He would have been spared
the sight of this humiliation.

632
00:51:53,056 --> 00:51:54,858
Gently.

633
00:51:56,558 --> 00:51:58,828
Yeah. Here, boy.

634
00:51:58,895 --> 00:51:59,863
Stag's blood.

635
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:03,733
Badge of honor.

636
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:06,602
Badge of honor.

637
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:09,772
Well done, Etienne!
Uh, Charles.

638
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,949
What?

639
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:22,952
He's suing me.

640
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:25,687
Oh. Come in.
Take your pants off.

641
00:52:25,755 --> 00:52:26,890
He's suing me!

642
00:52:26,956 --> 00:52:28,892
- Who?
- Me!

643
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:31,426
For land that is
rightfully mine.

644
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:34,797
Jean de Carrouges has filed a
lawsuit for a piece of property.

645
00:52:34,864 --> 00:52:37,066
Why would he sue you
for a piece of property?

646
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:39,501
Because you gave it
to me.

647
00:52:39,568 --> 00:52:41,637
He's suing you, too.
He's suing us both.

648
00:52:44,207 --> 00:52:46,075
I fail to see the amusement
here, milord.

649
00:52:46,142 --> 00:52:48,745
How do you sue for that
which was never yours?

650
00:52:48,811 --> 00:52:50,579
My squire.

651
00:52:50,646 --> 00:52:54,784
Will you finally submit that I
was right about Jean de Carrouges?

652
00:52:54,851 --> 00:52:56,920
He's saying he will take
the matter to the king.

653
00:52:56,986 --> 00:52:58,553
He has bled
for this king.

654
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,189
My cousin, the king.

655
00:53:00,256 --> 00:53:01,523
Pierre.

656
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:04,593
So have I bled.
So have you.

657
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,595
My friend,
this matter is settled.

658
00:53:06,662 --> 00:53:08,664
I'd hoped to
surprise you at court.

659
00:53:08,731 --> 00:53:12,534
Now, you have barged in and cast a
pall over a rather promising evening.

660
00:53:13,702 --> 00:53:15,537
So, I will tell you now.

661
00:53:15,604 --> 00:53:18,041
Jean de Carrouges will not be
the new captain at Belleme.

662
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:20,509
You will be the new
captain at Belleme.

663
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:22,812
As if by magic.

664
00:53:25,815 --> 00:53:27,516
Carrouges will
be furious.

665
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:30,019
Too true.
Now take your fucking pants off.

666
00:53:30,086 --> 00:53:32,621
Minor delay.

667
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:37,026
Who wants to help me
restore my previous state?

668
00:53:37,093 --> 00:53:38,728
Come here.

669
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:41,630
Come down, my boy!
Le Gris!

670
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:46,468
I will protect this
fortress of Belleme

671
00:53:46,535 --> 00:53:48,871
and command its garrison
as captain

672
00:53:48,938 --> 00:53:50,707
to the best of my ability

673
00:53:50,773 --> 00:53:53,776
against any and all
enemies of my king.

674
00:53:55,278 --> 00:53:56,678
Jacques Le Gris.

675
00:53:56,746 --> 00:53:59,949
Captain, rise
and be recognized.

676
00:54:39,322 --> 00:54:40,655
Good day!

677
00:54:41,891 --> 00:54:43,926
Join us, my squire.

678
00:54:43,993 --> 00:54:45,660
This is a day
for celebration.

679
00:54:46,561 --> 00:54:49,132
I will not be
staying, milord.

680
00:54:49,198 --> 00:54:51,801
Good God, man, tell me you're
not here to sue me again.

681
00:54:54,937 --> 00:54:57,740
Mock me, if you may,

682
00:54:57,807 --> 00:55:01,044
but you cannot change right
from wrong nor wrong from right.

683
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:04,814
Enlighten me, my squire,
as to what is right.

684
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:08,683
For as I see it, last time you
emerged was to file suit against me

685
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:10,219
for land I lawfully owned

686
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:12,989
and gifted to my most
faithful of squires

687
00:55:13,056 --> 00:55:15,657
for services rendered
by him unto me.

688
00:55:15,725 --> 00:55:17,692
What claim could you possibly
have had to this land?

689
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,761
You have owned it never.

690
00:55:18,828 --> 00:55:21,230
I know all
about your squire.

691
00:55:21,297 --> 00:55:24,566
The squire you
gifted the land to.

692
00:55:24,633 --> 00:55:28,037
The one who holds a captaincy
now that is rightfully mine.

693
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:29,172
My friend, please.

694
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:31,007
- Come, let us talk in private.
- No! No! No!

695
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:32,742
I shall be heard!

696
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:35,011
I do not accept this!

697
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:38,748
My father, for 20 years,
my father...

698
00:55:38,815 --> 00:55:41,017
I've waited for 20 years!

699
00:55:41,084 --> 00:55:44,053
There's not a nobleman in this hall
who would speak ill of your father.

700
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,189
You ask for my rents,
I yield them up.

701
00:55:47,256 --> 00:55:49,358
Here, as a man of honor,

702
00:55:49,425 --> 00:55:52,095
you say I am not the captain?

703
00:55:52,161 --> 00:55:55,865
You say to me
I am not the captain here?

704
00:55:55,932 --> 00:55:57,900
I say to you
whatever I like.

705
00:55:57,967 --> 00:55:59,836
I decide who is the captain
at Belleme.

706
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:02,738
That is what you prize.

707
00:56:02,805 --> 00:56:05,908
That. That sycophant.

708
00:56:07,642 --> 00:56:09,312
Sycophants all!

709
00:56:09,378 --> 00:56:11,981
I will sue!
I will sue you for this!

710
00:56:12,048 --> 00:56:14,117
In just three years,

711
00:56:14,183 --> 00:56:17,186
you've managed to marry
a traitor's daughter,

712
00:56:17,253 --> 00:56:20,223
sue me for land that never
belonged to you

713
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:22,792
and to stand before me for the
second time in as many years,

714
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:25,094
threatening
once again to sue,

715
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:28,297
all while speaking
of duty and honor.

716
00:56:28,364 --> 00:56:29,832
This is how you serve me?

717
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,268
I serve the king.

718
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,104
The king.

719
00:56:36,439 --> 00:56:37,874
The king.

720
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:41,944
Heaven and earth!

721
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:45,281
Heaven and earth what?

722
00:57:16,846 --> 00:57:18,181
14.

723
00:57:19,215 --> 00:57:22,084
37. 45.

724
00:57:22,718 --> 00:57:24,887
15. 17 borrowed...

725
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:40,102
Come.

726
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:42,004
Hello.

727
00:57:43,272 --> 00:57:45,474
Thought you were
asleep, milord.

728
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:47,143
Aye, great,

729
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,113
good friend.
No, almost,

730
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:55,351
but I spied candlelight,
and I knew it must be you.

731
00:57:55,418 --> 00:57:57,253
I work better alone.

732
00:57:58,788 --> 00:58:01,457
You make it hard for a man
to get his work done.

733
00:58:01,524 --> 00:58:04,894
I came here to tell you
I will not be joining you

734
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:06,429
for Crespin's celebration.

735
00:58:07,363 --> 00:58:08,831
Milord?

736
00:58:08,898 --> 00:58:11,834
Too far a ride,
too cold.

737
00:58:11,901 --> 00:58:14,303
We'll stay here and
fuck women of our own.

738
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:15,404
- No.
- No.

739
00:58:15,471 --> 00:58:18,908
No, I'm told Jean de
Carrouges will be there.

740
00:58:18,975 --> 00:58:21,344
It's time to
heal this wound.

741
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,846
He will never change.
Why even try?

742
00:58:23,913 --> 00:58:26,015
Because a feud between
your lordship's vassals

743
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:27,783
brings naught but trouble
and distraction.

744
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:29,085
Oh, good God.

745
00:58:29,152 --> 00:58:31,754
And because I once stood
godfather to his late son!

746
00:58:32,922 --> 00:58:35,091
I once held a place
in his heart.

747
00:58:35,157 --> 00:58:37,093
Do as you must.

748
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:40,329
You will get to see
the mysterious wife.

749
00:58:40,396 --> 00:58:45,935
Apparently, he's letting her out
of the dungeon for one time only.

750
00:58:46,002 --> 00:58:48,504
One can only hope he hasn't
taken away her books.

751
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:53,175
Carrouges' wife reads?

752
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:55,878
In as many languages
as you do, I'm told.

753
00:58:56,479 --> 00:58:58,147
Strange match.

754
00:58:58,214 --> 00:59:00,249
It is. Will wonders never cease?

755
00:59:00,316 --> 00:59:02,418
- Come to the celebration, milord!
- No.

756
00:59:02,485 --> 00:59:04,086
- Come!
- No.

757
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:14,864
Too much wine.
My Latin fails me.

758
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:17,333
"We forgive a child
afraid of the dark.

759
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,303
"Tragedy is men
afraid of the light."

760
00:59:22,538 --> 00:59:25,274
Your decency will be
the end of you.

761
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:26,976
And there is no end
to my decency.

762
00:59:27,043 --> 00:59:28,044
No, milord!

763
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,312
Recalculate!

764
00:59:32,415 --> 00:59:34,016
Sorry.

765
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:35,351
I think you'd enjoy it.

766
00:59:35,418 --> 00:59:38,287
We will ride from the valley
to where the river ends.

767
00:59:38,354 --> 00:59:41,524
We could, uh, dine there.

768
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:46,062
My servants could prepare
a picnic.

769
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:48,898
Oh, Jacques Le Gris,
save your breath.

770
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:51,434
I've heard all about you
from the ladies at court.

771
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,968
They're...
They're just boasting.

772
00:59:53,035 --> 00:59:54,070
Carrouges.

773
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:00,609
Pardon me, milady.

774
01:00:15,257 --> 01:00:16,292
Carrouges.

775
01:00:17,193 --> 01:00:18,227
Le Gris.

776
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:20,429
Pax! Well done!

777
01:00:20,496 --> 01:00:22,932
Well done, all!

778
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:26,302
Let there be no ill will among
the servants of our king.

779
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:28,237
His Majesty needs
us all right now.

780
01:00:28,304 --> 01:00:31,507
Hear, hear. Well spoken.

781
01:00:31,574 --> 01:00:33,476
Marguerite, come.

782
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:35,244
Give my old friend
a kiss.

783
01:00:35,311 --> 01:00:37,380
Show him the good faith
of the house Carrouges.

784
01:00:46,389 --> 01:00:47,623
Bravo!

785
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:03,672
If we...

786
01:01:05,341 --> 01:01:07,176
There.

787
01:01:07,243 --> 01:01:10,946
I think...
There you go.

788
01:01:22,726 --> 01:01:25,227
It's a shame we had
not met until tonight.

789
01:01:27,229 --> 01:01:28,597
Is it?

790
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:32,535
I had no idea what a
lucky man Carrouges was

791
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:35,571
for having such
a beautiful wife.

792
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,674
From what I have heard,

793
01:01:38,742 --> 01:01:41,510
you have no trouble
acquiring beautiful women.

794
01:01:44,013 --> 01:01:46,015
And from
what I have heard,

795
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:48,651
we may have a great
deal in common.

796
01:01:48,718 --> 01:01:51,320
What could we possibly
have in common?

797
01:01:51,387 --> 01:01:53,723
Appreciation of one another's
extraordinary good looks.

798
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:01,697
You are quite talented
when it comes to flattery.

799
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:03,699
I only
speak the truth.

800
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:05,367
And what else?

801
01:02:05,434 --> 01:02:07,036
You are a reader?

802
01:02:12,475 --> 01:02:13,609
Like myself.

803
01:02:15,377 --> 01:02:17,046
<i>Romance of the Rose.</i>

804
01:02:18,715 --> 01:02:20,115
I thought it rather dull.

805
01:02:20,182 --> 01:02:22,218
Dull?
The book is wretched.

806
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:28,157
I much prefer
<i>Percival's Courtesy.</i>

807
01:02:28,224 --> 01:02:31,427
It's a much more challenging
and interesting novel.

808
01:02:31,494 --> 01:02:33,295
Smart woman.

809
01:02:38,835 --> 01:02:42,271
Yet he is of so pure a
heart he's able to claim the Grail.

810
01:02:45,674 --> 01:02:47,711
I understand him.

811
01:02:56,753 --> 01:02:58,521
Don't
get ahead of yourself.

812
01:03:03,259 --> 01:03:04,693
Carrouges.

813
01:03:09,265 --> 01:03:11,500
Your wife charms me,
my friend.

814
01:03:40,129 --> 01:03:42,364
To even think is to covet,
my lord.

815
01:03:43,499 --> 01:03:46,235
No less sinful
than her coveting me.

816
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:28,110
Please forgive me.
I wish...

817
01:05:18,962 --> 01:05:20,229
Milord?

818
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:36,880
I've never seen you
like this, milord.

819
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:43,352
Nor have I, my friend.

820
01:05:43,419 --> 01:05:45,789
Word is not promising
on the Scottish front.

821
01:05:46,923 --> 01:05:49,591
Perhaps the Lady Marguerite's
already a widow.

822
01:05:49,658 --> 01:05:53,595
I would not wager against
Jean de Carrouges in battle.

823
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:56,800
What do you think
her and Jean speak about?

824
01:05:58,001 --> 01:06:00,669
You think
they read together?

825
01:06:00,737 --> 01:06:02,471
But he's illiterate,
though, isn't he?

826
01:06:04,808 --> 01:06:07,911
The debt we owe to our friends
is the greatest of all.

827
01:06:07,977 --> 01:06:10,412
Is it greater than love?

828
01:06:29,999 --> 01:06:32,601
I didn't train him properly.

829
01:06:32,668 --> 01:06:34,570
The fault is mine.

830
01:06:34,636 --> 01:06:37,639
My lords! My lords!

831
01:06:37,707 --> 01:06:41,778
I present the knight,
Sir Jean de Carrouges!

832
01:06:49,618 --> 01:06:52,889
Milord, I return from the royal
campaign in Scotland to report to you.

833
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:55,825
Rise, Sir Knight, speak.

834
01:07:00,662 --> 01:07:04,633
We found ourselves unwelcome
by our Scottish allies.

835
01:07:05,334 --> 01:07:06,668
We laid siege at Wark.

836
01:07:06,736 --> 01:07:09,806
Louder, Sir Knight,
they cannot hear you in the back.

837
01:07:12,942 --> 01:07:15,011
We laid siege at Wark.

838
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:17,446
Mm.

839
01:07:17,881 --> 01:07:19,548
Milord, I return

840
01:07:20,549 --> 01:07:23,285
with neither plunder
nor prisoners.

841
01:07:23,352 --> 01:07:26,723
And without five of the nine
squires under my command.

842
01:07:28,323 --> 01:07:30,960
Indeed,
I return a knight.

843
01:07:31,027 --> 01:07:33,863
One who curses Scotland and
the hour I set foot there.

844
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,732
Yes.

845
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:38,034
Word had arrived
ahead of you

846
01:07:38,101 --> 01:07:41,805
of your
calamitous campaign.

847
01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:43,639
A tragic result, Jean,

848
01:07:43,706 --> 01:07:45,975
though, I dare say,
no fault of your command.

849
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:47,010
Hear, hear!

850
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:54,017
Where are you off to now, Jean?

851
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:55,852
I'm bound for Paris.

852
01:07:55,919 --> 01:07:57,887
I have business with the
treasurer for my payment.

853
01:07:57,954 --> 01:07:59,454
Very good.

854
01:07:59,521 --> 01:08:01,490
A good soldier and good
fortune are not long parted.

855
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:05,594
I return a knight.

856
01:08:05,661 --> 01:08:09,531
That is the second time
you do not call me "sir."

857
01:08:09,598 --> 01:08:11,835
There will not be a third.

858
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:20,409
No offense intended,
Sir Jean.

859
01:08:21,744 --> 01:08:23,780
I will not be patronized

860
01:08:25,114 --> 01:08:26,716
by this squire

861
01:08:28,383 --> 01:08:30,787
who lies about court,

862
01:08:30,854 --> 01:08:34,356
waiting to be feted
with gift

863
01:08:34,423 --> 01:08:36,658
upon gift upon gift

864
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,729
and risks nothing!

865
01:08:41,164 --> 01:08:42,464
Nothing.

866
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,937
He may acquire more
property in this world,

867
01:08:49,571 --> 01:08:51,975
find more favor...

868
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,943
...eat more, drink more,

869
01:08:54,744 --> 01:08:56,946
bed more,

870
01:08:57,013 --> 01:09:00,850
and otherwise,
call himself a man of arms.

871
01:09:01,784 --> 01:09:03,820
But in this hall

872
01:09:03,887 --> 01:09:05,520
and any other,

873
01:09:05,587 --> 01:09:07,456
in my company,

874
01:09:07,522 --> 01:09:09,092
he will call me "sir."

875
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:11,460
Sir.

876
01:09:12,461 --> 01:09:13,495
Sir.

877
01:09:14,731 --> 01:09:16,431
Indeed,

878
01:09:16,498 --> 01:09:17,566
good sir.

879
01:09:20,602 --> 01:09:23,139
Enjoy your time in Paris,

880
01:09:23,206 --> 01:09:24,173
Sir Jean.

881
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:28,610
That is all, Jean.

882
01:09:35,118 --> 01:09:36,685
Milord.

883
01:09:52,135 --> 01:09:53,202
Who's there?

884
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:57,572
It's, uh, I, Adam Louvel,
milady.

885
01:09:57,639 --> 01:09:58,607
Adam Louvel?

886
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:01,844
I'm ashamed to have
to ask a great favor.

887
01:10:03,713 --> 01:10:06,716
My horse has thrown
a shoe and...

888
01:10:06,783 --> 01:10:07,917
Nobody's here.

889
01:10:07,984 --> 01:10:09,584
I'm not permitted
to open the door.

890
01:10:09,651 --> 01:10:11,520
No, of course.

891
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:15,158
I just wondered if I could come inside
and warm myself while he's reshod.

892
01:10:15,224 --> 01:10:18,127
I'm so sorry to have to ask.

893
01:10:18,194 --> 01:10:20,763
For a moment. I hate to ask.

894
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:22,031
- Oh...
- I...

895
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:30,639
Milady,
forgive me for intruding.

896
01:10:33,076 --> 01:10:36,245
I love you more than any other,
and I would do anything for you.

897
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:38,547
Everything I have is yours.

898
01:10:39,581 --> 01:10:41,818
How can you speak to me
like this?

899
01:10:41,884 --> 01:10:44,954
Marguerite, what way then
would I speak to you?

900
01:10:45,021 --> 01:10:47,857
Milady, you must know
it cannot be helped.

901
01:10:47,924 --> 01:10:50,727
My love for you
has consumed me.

902
01:10:50,793 --> 01:10:52,028
How dare you?

903
01:10:52,095 --> 01:10:53,930
Milady, when milord sets
his course for love...

904
01:10:53,997 --> 01:10:56,631
- Do not speak!
- You must leave now. Please.

905
01:10:56,698 --> 01:10:58,101
You heard the lady.
Leave us!

906
01:10:58,167 --> 01:10:59,135
Milord.

907
01:11:06,042 --> 01:11:08,543
- I am married.
- Yes.

908
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:10,279
You are saddled with
a terrible burden.

909
01:11:11,815 --> 01:11:14,784
A cold, callous man who
does not love you as I do.

910
01:11:14,851 --> 01:11:16,551
Who cannot appreciate you
for the marvel that you are.

911
01:11:16,618 --> 01:11:18,687
- Please.
- I only want for your happiness.

912
01:11:18,755 --> 01:11:20,957
I cannot bear to see
you in such hardship.

913
01:11:21,024 --> 01:11:23,292
I know your house's
finances are fragile.

914
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:24,994
My lord provides for me.

915
01:11:25,061 --> 01:11:26,062
Yes.

916
01:11:29,564 --> 01:11:32,201
But does he know
you to be the most...

917
01:11:33,102 --> 01:11:34,703
exquisite...

918
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,941
fascinating woman?

919
01:11:42,145 --> 01:11:43,946
A woman

920
01:11:44,981 --> 01:11:46,716
I would devote
my whole life to.

921
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:52,789
Oh, hear me say
I'm in love with you.

922
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:55,058
I know you love me, too.
You must.

923
01:11:55,124 --> 01:11:57,160
You must leave.
Now, please.

924
01:12:38,134 --> 01:12:39,836
Jeanette!

925
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:49,011
If you run,
I will only chase you.

926
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:01,991
- No.
- Yes.

927
01:13:02,058 --> 01:13:03,292
No.

928
01:13:05,128 --> 01:13:06,695
No.

929
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,301
No.

930
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:15,670
No!

931
01:13:43,866 --> 01:13:44,901
No.

932
01:13:48,104 --> 01:13:49,305
No.

933
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,074
Please, no.

934
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:48,998
You fear yourself guilty,
but, my love,

935
01:14:49,065 --> 01:14:51,734
I beseech you,
tell no one.

936
01:14:53,336 --> 01:14:56,038
For your own safety.

937
01:14:56,105 --> 01:14:58,241
If your husband
hears of this,

938
01:14:59,275 --> 01:15:00,443
he may kill you.

939
01:15:01,911 --> 01:15:03,379
Say nothing.

940
01:15:05,314 --> 01:15:07,450
I will keep quiet, too.

941
01:15:14,957 --> 01:15:17,326
Do not feel badly,
my love.

942
01:15:18,461 --> 01:15:20,963
We could not
help ourselves.

943
01:15:26,936 --> 01:15:29,205
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

944
01:15:29,272 --> 01:15:30,940
Speak, my son.

945
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:35,044
I carry a sin that weighs
heavy upon my heart.

946
01:15:35,111 --> 01:15:36,445
What is it, my son?

947
01:15:38,047 --> 01:15:40,416
I have committed
the sin of adultery

948
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:45,554
against a man I once
considered a friend.

949
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:46,889
You know
your commandments?

950
01:15:46,956 --> 01:15:48,491
Yes, Father.

951
01:15:49,191 --> 01:15:51,193
I ask forgiveness.

952
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:53,796
My son,
Matthew tells us,

953
01:15:53,863 --> 01:15:55,965
everyone who looks
at a woman with lust

954
01:15:56,032 --> 01:15:58,834
has already committed adultery
with her in his heart.

955
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:00,803
But is love a sin, Father?

956
01:16:02,538 --> 01:16:04,440
How can I seek absolution
for love?

957
01:16:04,507 --> 01:16:06,208
This is the work
of the Devil.

958
01:16:06,275 --> 01:16:08,244
This temptress
leads you astray.

959
01:16:08,311 --> 01:16:11,013
Just as Eve lured Adam
from the divine path.

960
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,281
That is not love.

961
01:16:12,348 --> 01:16:14,350
Then why?

962
01:16:15,618 --> 01:16:18,287
God is faithful.

963
01:16:18,354 --> 01:16:22,291
He will not let you be tempted
beyond what you can bear.

964
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:25,461
This is a test.

965
01:16:28,364 --> 01:16:29,465
- My friend.
- Milord.

966
01:16:29,532 --> 01:16:31,200
Sit.

967
01:16:39,542 --> 01:16:41,344
You will need to sit.

968
01:16:45,581 --> 01:16:46,615
Drink this.

969
01:16:53,356 --> 01:16:56,258
You should drink
all of it.

970
01:17:01,364 --> 01:17:02,965
There is no other way
to say this

971
01:17:03,032 --> 01:17:05,634
than to speak plainly.

972
01:17:05,701 --> 01:17:10,172
A most unspeakable charge
has been brought against you.

973
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,343
Jean de Carrouges
evidently,

974
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:15,945
among others,

975
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:18,881
has been telling any
and all who will listen

976
01:17:18,948 --> 01:17:20,316
that you...

977
01:17:22,118 --> 01:17:25,421
took his wife
against her will.

978
01:17:34,296 --> 01:17:35,498
I know not what to say.

979
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:40,669
Why would she say that?

980
01:17:40,737 --> 01:17:44,206
Jacques, it is
you and I here.

981
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:46,375
I must know.
This is a serious matter.

982
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:49,178
The accusation is false.

983
01:17:53,249 --> 01:17:56,619
Of course, she made the customary
protest, but she is a lady.

984
01:17:56,685 --> 01:17:58,454
It was not
against her will.

985
01:18:02,258 --> 01:18:05,060
Why would I ever
need to do that?

986
01:18:05,127 --> 01:18:07,296
Have you ever known me to
lack the company of women?

987
01:18:07,496 --> 01:18:09,165
No.

988
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:12,635
But you have not
been yourself of late.

989
01:18:12,701 --> 01:18:16,272
It is true, I confess,
it is a feeling I've never had before.

990
01:18:16,338 --> 01:18:17,573
A love...

991
01:18:20,209 --> 01:18:22,077
that I've never known.
It...

992
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:27,950
It's taken all my strength
not to return to her.

993
01:18:30,754 --> 01:18:32,254
We knew it was wrong,

994
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:34,690
I confessed my adultery,
and performed my penance.

995
01:18:34,758 --> 01:18:38,394
But I swear to you,
this charge of rape is false.

996
01:18:38,461 --> 01:18:41,130
Of course it's absurd.
It's as I suspected.

997
01:18:41,197 --> 01:18:43,265
But I must
defend my name.

998
01:18:43,332 --> 01:18:45,267
No, you must
do no such thing.

999
01:18:45,334 --> 01:18:47,102
On my honor, I will, milord.
I must.

1000
01:18:47,169 --> 01:18:50,306
I know you yearn to defend
your name and your honor,

1001
01:18:50,372 --> 01:18:55,044
but the common mind has no
capacity for this sort of nuance.

1002
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:57,112
They simply don't understand
the world as we do.

1003
01:18:57,179 --> 01:18:59,415
They see villains and
heroes, that is all.

1004
01:18:59,482 --> 01:19:00,516
Milord...

1005
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:02,618
Deny, deny, deny.

1006
01:19:02,685 --> 01:19:06,489
Everywhere, always,
at all times, and to all men.

1007
01:19:06,555 --> 01:19:08,357
You did not
commit adultery.

1008
01:19:08,424 --> 01:19:09,558
It never happened.

1009
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:12,161
There is no proof.

1010
01:19:12,228 --> 01:19:15,064
It will always be your word
against that of Jean de Carrouges.

1011
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:16,232
Yes, milord.

1012
01:19:17,767 --> 01:19:20,503
Of course we will have
to endure a public trial,

1013
01:19:20,569 --> 01:19:24,708
charges of rape will
be brought against you

1014
01:19:24,774 --> 01:19:28,043
and a verdict will be
rendered by your overlord

1015
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:30,246
adjudicating this
matter who,

1016
01:19:30,312 --> 01:19:32,615
as the fates
would have it,

1017
01:19:32,681 --> 01:19:35,284
happens to be me.

1018
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:45,094
I hereby find said Jacques Le
Gris to be completely innocent

1019
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,096
and wholly without guilt.

1020
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:49,665
I order the criminal
complaint annulled

1021
01:19:49,733 --> 01:19:51,735
and stricken
from the record.

1022
01:19:51,801 --> 01:19:54,303
Let there be no further
questions about it.

1023
01:19:55,104 --> 01:19:57,273
Let there be
no more gossip,

1024
01:19:57,339 --> 01:20:00,442
the penalty a
punishment by my hand.

1025
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:02,545
Is that understood?

1026
01:20:02,611 --> 01:20:05,815
As to the sworn testimony
of Lady Marguerite,

1027
01:20:05,882 --> 01:20:10,185
one can only come to the
conclusion she must have dreamt it.

1028
01:20:10,252 --> 01:20:13,222
Now, have these findings
sent immediately to Paris

1029
01:20:13,289 --> 01:20:17,126
before this insouciant knight troubles
our king any further with this nonsense.

1030
01:20:18,828 --> 01:20:20,262
Yes, speak.

1031
01:20:20,329 --> 01:20:22,531
Milord, I have
been informed

1032
01:20:22,598 --> 01:20:25,735
that Jean de Carrouges has
already travelled to Paris.

1033
01:20:25,802 --> 01:20:29,471
He is filing an appeal to His
Majesty at this very moment.

1034
01:20:38,113 --> 01:20:39,783
Cunt.

1035
01:20:39,849 --> 01:20:41,785
The benefit of clergy.

1036
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:43,853
There really is
no decision to make.

1037
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,822
You're a cleric
in minor orders.

1038
01:20:45,889 --> 01:20:48,858
So, you can escape the
jurisdiction of the secular courts

1039
01:20:48,925 --> 01:20:50,659
and be tried
by the Church

1040
01:20:50,727 --> 01:20:53,295
where conditions are
more favorable.

1041
01:20:54,731 --> 01:20:56,733
Men holding church office

1042
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,770
number disproportionately
among those accused of rape.

1043
01:21:00,837 --> 01:21:05,140
They escape serious punishment by
claiming benefit of clergy, so...

1044
01:21:05,207 --> 01:21:08,444
we'll have the church try your
case and be done with the matter.

1045
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:10,379
But what of my name?

1046
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:14,884
Was there

1047
01:21:15,752 --> 01:21:16,886
an affair?

1048
01:21:19,521 --> 01:21:20,790
Absolutely not.

1049
01:21:20,857 --> 01:21:24,693
It's strange she would claim
rape and risk her life.

1050
01:21:25,829 --> 01:21:28,464
Why would she do this?

1051
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:32,635
All of France is talking about
this, and I'm innocent.

1052
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:35,671
I've said publicly
that this never happened!

1053
01:21:35,739 --> 01:21:37,807
And yet,
under extraordinary pressure

1054
01:21:37,874 --> 01:21:40,542
and at great risk
to her name and reputation,

1055
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:43,780
Lady Marguerite has
said that it did.

1056
01:21:47,683 --> 01:21:49,719
Formally, this is
not about her.

1057
01:21:51,253 --> 01:21:52,822
Rape is not a crime
against a woman.

1058
01:21:52,889 --> 01:21:56,325
It is a property crime
against her male guardian.

1059
01:21:56,392 --> 01:21:58,327
In this case,
Jean de Carrouges.

1060
01:21:58,394 --> 01:22:02,932
This is not a matter over which a
duel should be fought to the death.

1061
01:22:04,768 --> 01:22:07,302
It should be
settled quietly.

1062
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:14,176
Take the benefit of clergy.

1063
01:22:16,645 --> 01:22:18,414
I'm not a coward.

1064
01:22:28,257 --> 01:22:31,961
Most excellent and powerful
king and our sovereign lord,

1065
01:22:32,028 --> 01:22:33,595
I present myself,

1066
01:22:33,662 --> 01:22:35,597
Jacques Le Gris,

1067
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:39,368
squire and defendant,

1068
01:22:39,435 --> 01:22:41,570
and I do hereby deny

1069
01:22:41,637 --> 01:22:43,338
all the aforesaid charges,

1070
01:22:43,405 --> 01:22:44,774
especially

1071
01:22:45,709 --> 01:22:47,977
of Jean de Carrouges,

1072
01:22:48,044 --> 01:22:50,312
that I did unlawfully...

1073
01:22:52,448 --> 01:22:53,917
and carnally

1074
01:22:53,983 --> 01:22:55,785
know his wife,

1075
01:22:55,852 --> 01:22:57,887
the Lady Marguerite de
Carrouges,

1076
01:22:59,288 --> 01:23:01,825
in the third week
of January last,

1077
01:23:01,891 --> 01:23:04,493
or at any other time.

1078
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,964
And I further maintain,
saving the honor of Your Majesty,

1079
01:23:08,031 --> 01:23:09,631
that the said knight

1080
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:11,600
has falsely

1081
01:23:11,667 --> 01:23:13,002
and wickedly lied!

1082
01:23:14,703 --> 01:23:16,605
And that he is false

1083
01:23:16,672 --> 01:23:19,241
and wicked
to say this thing.

1084
01:23:21,778 --> 01:23:23,747
And I further maintain...

1085
01:23:26,482 --> 01:23:28,417
and with the aid of God,

1086
01:23:29,853 --> 01:23:31,121
and with Our Lady,

1087
01:23:33,422 --> 01:23:37,359
I pledge to do whatever is
necessary to prove my innocence.

1088
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:53,777
The knight and the squire
have spoken well.

1089
01:23:55,344 --> 01:23:57,814
It is ordered now that the
parties present the affidavits

1090
01:23:57,881 --> 01:23:59,414
which, the court
having received,

1091
01:23:59,481 --> 01:24:01,718
will render a verdict
upon in a fortnight.

1092
01:24:02,952 --> 01:24:04,954
If either man

1093
01:24:05,021 --> 01:24:06,890
attempts to flee Paris,

1094
01:24:06,956 --> 01:24:10,292
it will be taken as
a sign of his guilt.

1095
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:12,962
Orders will be issued
for his summary arrest

1096
01:24:14,363 --> 01:24:16,032
and he will be hanged.

1097
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:30,046
The king will decide if a duel
should indeed be fought.

1098
01:24:36,585 --> 01:24:38,687
What now?

1099
01:24:52,769 --> 01:24:55,537
You will
have 330 livres in coin,

1100
01:24:55,604 --> 01:24:57,006
furnishings, cloth, and jewels

1101
01:24:57,073 --> 01:25:00,409
in addition to the estate
at Mont a Gudot as well as...

1102
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:01,978
And what of
Aunou-le-Faucon?

1103
01:25:03,512 --> 01:25:07,984
Uh, I was forced to sell that
property to Count Pierre.

1104
01:25:15,158 --> 01:25:17,459
You and I agreed
this land should be assumed

1105
01:25:17,526 --> 01:25:18,862
by whomever marries
your daughter.

1106
01:25:22,799 --> 01:25:24,633
Is this not part
of the dowry?

1107
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,602
I was unable
to pay my rents.

1108
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:28,537
You promised me.

1109
01:25:28,604 --> 01:25:30,707
We discussed this.

1110
01:25:30,773 --> 01:25:32,876
My daughter comes with the
money and the land that I've offered.

1111
01:25:32,942 --> 01:25:34,676
That is all that I own.

1112
01:25:36,578 --> 01:25:39,481
And what
of the bride price?

1113
01:25:39,548 --> 01:25:43,753
I offer you
a name of value.

1114
01:25:53,528 --> 01:25:58,533
I should expect she's capable
of performing her wifely duties?

1115
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,435
Bearing an heir.

1116
01:26:00,502 --> 01:26:03,505
My daughter
is strong and healthy

1117
01:26:03,572 --> 01:26:05,708
and ready to honor
the marriage.

1118
01:26:07,777 --> 01:26:11,613
The conception of an heir and
children to follow shall be swift.

1119
01:26:12,749 --> 01:26:14,650
And prolific.

1120
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:22,658
Proceed.

1121
01:26:24,827 --> 01:26:26,595
The
wedding will proceed!

1122
01:26:52,989 --> 01:26:54,556
You're perfect.

1123
01:27:19,115 --> 01:27:21,550
I hope this was
pleasurable for you.

1124
01:27:24,087 --> 01:27:26,022
Yes, milord, very.

1125
01:27:27,556 --> 01:27:29,058
I could not have asked

1126
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:31,861
for a more
satisfying wedding night.

1127
01:27:33,162 --> 01:27:36,899
Perhaps we have conceived
on this very night.

1128
01:27:51,314 --> 01:27:53,515
I think you would enjoy it.
We will ride

1129
01:27:53,582 --> 01:27:55,985
- from the valley to where the river...
- Milord. Carrouges.

1130
01:28:09,899 --> 01:28:10,967
Carrouges.

1131
01:28:12,368 --> 01:28:13,970
Le Gris.

1132
01:28:14,037 --> 01:28:15,738
Pax! Well done!

1133
01:28:15,805 --> 01:28:17,539
Well done, all!

1134
01:28:17,606 --> 01:28:20,575
Let there be no ill will
between servants of our king.

1135
01:28:21,576 --> 01:28:23,678
Marguerite, come.

1136
01:28:23,746 --> 01:28:25,114
Give my old friend a kiss.

1137
01:28:25,181 --> 01:28:27,649
Show him the good faith
of the house Carrouges.

1138
01:28:47,236 --> 01:28:50,339
Who is that squire?
He's dangerously handsome.

1139
01:28:50,406 --> 01:28:53,042
Mm. He has quite
the reputation.

1140
01:28:53,109 --> 01:28:54,643
Should milord not
return from battle,

1141
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:56,145
I would happily strengthen
that reputation.

1142
01:28:56,212 --> 01:28:57,947
Mm, I think that could
be arranged regardless.

1143
01:28:58,014 --> 01:29:00,682
- Marie.
- How can you speak like this?

1144
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:03,152
I should not be seen
nor heard with you.

1145
01:29:03,219 --> 01:29:04,921
My husband would
have my head.

1146
01:29:04,987 --> 01:29:07,023
But you would die happy.

1147
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:08,991
He's handsome.

1148
01:29:09,058 --> 01:29:10,793
Charming, I hear.

1149
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,628
True, he is handsome
and charming,

1150
01:29:13,695 --> 01:29:15,898
but my husband
does not trust him.

1151
01:29:22,939 --> 01:29:24,974
I am proud of you.

1152
01:29:25,041 --> 01:29:27,777
I know that this reconciliation
must have been difficult.

1153
01:29:27,844 --> 01:29:29,345
You gave me good counsel.

1154
01:29:30,313 --> 01:29:33,049
You are kind
to Jacques Le Gris.

1155
01:29:33,116 --> 01:29:35,284
That man is unduly
fond of himself.

1156
01:29:37,053 --> 01:29:38,988
But you see

1157
01:29:39,055 --> 01:29:42,925
how a smile and a kind word
go much further than a threat.

1158
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,295
Even if you don't mean it.

1159
01:29:51,367 --> 01:29:53,269
While I'm gone,

1160
01:29:53,336 --> 01:29:55,104
besides a bountiful harvest,

1161
01:29:55,171 --> 01:29:58,241
our fortunes will turn most on
the breeding of these horses.

1162
01:29:58,307 --> 01:30:00,343
And the collection
of rents?

1163
01:30:00,409 --> 01:30:02,078
Yes, of course.

1164
01:30:02,145 --> 01:30:04,080
Stand over there.

1165
01:30:04,147 --> 01:30:06,282
I bought this mare
for breeding.

1166
01:30:06,349 --> 01:30:09,919
Comes from a long line
of war horses.

1167
01:30:09,986 --> 01:30:12,955
She will foal many
a valuable colt.

1168
01:30:13,022 --> 01:30:14,123
Sometimes,
the difference

1169
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:16,859
between victory
and defeat,

1170
01:30:16,926 --> 01:30:18,227
between life and death...

1171
01:30:18,294 --> 01:30:20,897
- Get out of the way!
- Get out of the way!

1172
01:30:20,963 --> 01:30:21,998
Mind the gate!

1173
01:30:23,698 --> 01:30:24,967
No!

1174
01:30:25,034 --> 01:30:26,936
Whoa! Steady!

1175
01:30:27,003 --> 01:30:28,404
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- No!

1176
01:30:28,471 --> 01:30:29,839
Steady, girl.

1177
01:30:31,207 --> 01:30:32,241
- Easy! Easy!
- Get hold of her.

1178
01:30:32,942 --> 01:30:34,243
Not the stallion!

1179
01:30:35,745 --> 01:30:37,380
No! Not you!

1180
01:30:37,446 --> 01:30:39,148
Not with my mare!

1181
01:30:42,985 --> 01:30:45,154
<i>The gates remain closed!</i>

1182
01:30:45,221 --> 01:30:46,455
Yes, milord.

1183
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:49,325
The mare is in season!

1184
01:30:51,027 --> 01:30:53,396
These are not
trifling matters.

1185
01:30:53,462 --> 01:30:54,696
It costs money.

1186
01:30:58,868 --> 01:31:01,370
Nothing would get done around
here were it not for me.

1187
01:31:28,364 --> 01:31:32,468
I trust your little death was a
memorable and a productive one.

1188
01:31:32,535 --> 01:31:34,870
It was like none other.

1189
01:31:42,845 --> 01:31:45,248
Why have I not yet conceived?

1190
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:50,519
I want a child so very badly.

1191
01:31:50,586 --> 01:31:52,989
Wanting a child has nothing to
do with the matter, Marguerite.

1192
01:31:53,055 --> 01:31:54,790
We need a son.

1193
01:31:56,459 --> 01:31:58,261
You think
I do not know this?

1194
01:31:59,562 --> 01:32:01,430
I think of nothing else.

1195
01:32:01,497 --> 01:32:04,400
I did not have this problem
with my first wife.

1196
01:32:08,304 --> 01:32:10,473
I shall return
in a few months.

1197
01:32:10,539 --> 01:32:13,809
You will be safe here with
my mother and your servants.

1198
01:32:13,876 --> 01:32:15,778
You must never allow yourself
to be unattended.

1199
01:32:17,213 --> 01:32:19,849
And do not look so sad.

1200
01:32:19,915 --> 01:32:23,519
I prefer you to be in good
spirits as I go off to war.

1201
01:32:23,586 --> 01:32:26,322
I'm proud of you, milord.

1202
01:32:29,292 --> 01:32:30,926
You will take care
of the estate.

1203
01:32:30,993 --> 01:32:32,428
See that it does not
fall into disarray.

1204
01:32:32,495 --> 01:32:33,896
Of course.

1205
01:32:46,609 --> 01:32:48,010
- Good morning.
- Milady.

1206
01:32:48,077 --> 01:32:49,378
- Milady.
- Good morning.

1207
01:32:49,445 --> 01:32:51,547
Good morning, Henri.

1208
01:32:51,614 --> 01:32:53,816
Good morning
to you, milady.

1209
01:32:53,883 --> 01:32:56,052
The pregnancy
seems to be going well.

1210
01:32:57,486 --> 01:32:59,388
Yes, milady.

1211
01:32:59,455 --> 01:33:01,023
So why is she penned up?

1212
01:33:02,458 --> 01:33:05,394
Before my master left,
he had told me to do so.

1213
01:33:08,097 --> 01:33:11,400
My husband knows much
about horses,

1214
01:33:11,467 --> 01:33:13,369
riding them.

1215
01:33:13,436 --> 01:33:15,071
The upbringing,
I leave to you.

1216
01:33:17,606 --> 01:33:19,208
It would be better
for the health of the mare

1217
01:33:19,275 --> 01:33:20,576
to be roaming free.

1218
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:24,246
Then she shall roam free.

1219
01:33:24,313 --> 01:33:25,614
Thank you, milady.

1220
01:33:32,254 --> 01:33:36,492
This is last month's
rent as well, milady.

1221
01:33:36,559 --> 01:33:38,627
Were you unable to pay?

1222
01:33:38,694 --> 01:33:41,130
Your lord never came
to collect it.

1223
01:33:46,602 --> 01:33:49,438
- Is this unusual?
- No.

1224
01:33:49,505 --> 01:33:51,240
But it is no trouble.

1225
01:33:52,908 --> 01:33:54,477
Thank you.

1226
01:34:10,226 --> 01:34:12,228
Henri?

1227
01:34:12,294 --> 01:34:13,562
Yes, milady?

1228
01:34:13,629 --> 01:34:16,932
Are the oxen
not too slow?

1229
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:20,236
The thaw came late
this year.

1230
01:34:20,302 --> 01:34:22,004
It's been hard
going for them.

1231
01:34:22,071 --> 01:34:23,939
If we are to sow the oats
in time for harvest,

1232
01:34:24,006 --> 01:34:25,508
then we must be
much faster.

1233
01:34:25,574 --> 01:34:28,010
I should like to
use the horses.

1234
01:34:28,077 --> 01:34:30,479
Yes, but we never use the
horses for that purpose.

1235
01:34:30,546 --> 01:34:32,214
My master feels
they are too valuable.

1236
01:34:32,281 --> 01:34:35,551
They will be of no value if they
starve to death this winter.

1237
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:37,987
See that it's done.

1238
01:34:38,554 --> 01:34:39,655
Right away.

1239
01:34:43,058 --> 01:34:45,694
I see you have some sun
on your face, milady.

1240
01:34:45,762 --> 01:34:47,430
- You look well.
- Do I?

1241
01:34:47,496 --> 01:34:49,432
I prefer not to be pink.

1242
01:34:49,498 --> 01:34:51,200
Though it was
a lovely day.

1243
01:34:51,267 --> 01:34:54,136
A little color on one's
face proves they're alive.

1244
01:34:54,203 --> 01:34:56,138
Barely.

1245
01:34:56,205 --> 01:34:58,240
Have you heard we've a
famous tailor from Paris

1246
01:34:58,307 --> 01:35:00,276
arriving in the village
next week?

1247
01:35:00,342 --> 01:35:04,146
You've been working hard,
why not buy yourself a new dress?

1248
01:35:04,647 --> 01:35:06,315
Oh, I don't know.

1249
01:35:06,382 --> 01:35:08,451
He copies the dresses Queen
Isabeau's been seen wearing.

1250
01:35:08,517 --> 01:35:09,618
They're quite the rage.

1251
01:35:09,685 --> 01:35:11,086
I have seen those.

1252
01:35:11,153 --> 01:35:12,588
The neckline
is very low.

1253
01:35:12,655 --> 01:35:17,026
Almost so low that one might
see the queen's pierced nipples.

1254
01:35:17,092 --> 01:35:18,360
She does not.

1255
01:35:18,427 --> 01:35:19,729
- She does.
- She does not...

1256
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:22,732
Good evening.

1257
01:35:24,066 --> 01:35:25,401
Good evening.

1258
01:35:29,739 --> 01:35:32,274
Things seem to be
running quite well.

1259
01:35:33,108 --> 01:35:35,578
I enjoy doing
these tasks.

1260
01:35:35,644 --> 01:35:37,646
It's my pleasure.

1261
01:35:37,714 --> 01:35:39,415
Until he returns
from Scotland,

1262
01:35:39,482 --> 01:35:40,717
of course.

1263
01:35:41,718 --> 01:35:43,285
It is unfortunate,
however,

1264
01:35:43,352 --> 01:35:44,687
that you've not
been capable

1265
01:35:44,754 --> 01:35:48,023
of steering your husband away
from conflict with others.

1266
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:50,993
Jean does what he feels
is necessary.

1267
01:35:53,730 --> 01:35:56,665
May I ask what you're making?
It looks lovely.

1268
01:35:57,666 --> 01:36:00,369
I say with sorrow,

1269
01:36:00,436 --> 01:36:02,238
something

1270
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:04,273
apparently fruitless.

1271
01:36:06,442 --> 01:36:08,712
You are very cruel.

1272
01:36:11,213 --> 01:36:13,415
I am a good wife.

1273
01:36:13,482 --> 01:36:16,452
As long as you are fulfilling
your wifely duties.

1274
01:36:19,555 --> 01:36:22,658
Or perhaps you cannot
be pleased.

1275
01:36:33,235 --> 01:36:34,771
How is your sleep?

1276
01:36:34,838 --> 01:36:36,539
Often interrupted.

1277
01:36:36,605 --> 01:36:39,508
Flaccid joints.

1278
01:36:39,575 --> 01:36:41,410
Bitter taste in the mouth?

1279
01:36:42,411 --> 01:36:43,813
I don't know.

1280
01:36:46,148 --> 01:36:51,220
My lady, it appears you are suffering
from an imbalance of the four humors,

1281
01:36:51,287 --> 01:36:54,290
primarily black bile.

1282
01:36:54,356 --> 01:36:55,792
You are severely
melancholic,

1283
01:36:55,859 --> 01:36:59,695
your body is
cold and dry.

1284
01:36:59,763 --> 01:37:01,096
Perhaps this,

1285
01:37:01,163 --> 01:37:03,767
combined with various
other factors,

1286
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:05,568
including God's will,

1287
01:37:05,634 --> 01:37:08,103
could be
preventing conception.

1288
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:15,077
It is imperative that you
have a pleasurable conclusion

1289
01:37:15,144 --> 01:37:18,247
similar to your husband's,
in order to conceive a child.

1290
01:37:18,314 --> 01:37:19,281
You achieve this?

1291
01:37:20,316 --> 01:37:22,551
Yes.

1292
01:37:22,618 --> 01:37:26,422
You find intercourse with
your husband pleasurable?

1293
01:37:27,556 --> 01:37:29,425
Yes, of course, Doctor.

1294
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:34,330
Although I am not certain
I am experiencing

1295
01:37:34,396 --> 01:37:37,266
"the little death,"
as they say.

1296
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:41,303
But if you find it
pleasurable, then you are.

1297
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:44,373
Very well.

1298
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,275
When Jean returns,
he shall be grateful

1299
01:37:46,342 --> 01:37:50,714
as I have put the books in order,
as well as everything else.

1300
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:53,449
Perhaps he won't mind
the expense.

1301
01:37:53,515 --> 01:37:55,551
Let us both get dresses.

1302
01:37:55,618 --> 01:37:57,586
Surprise your new husband.

1303
01:37:57,653 --> 01:37:59,254
He would not approve.

1304
01:37:59,321 --> 01:38:01,457
He would say I have
enough dresses.

1305
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:04,126
I've only been married
a short time,

1306
01:38:04,193 --> 01:38:05,862
yet I now understand the
burden of this arrangement.

1307
01:38:05,929 --> 01:38:07,262
You are a newlywed.

1308
01:38:07,329 --> 01:38:08,664
Surely you do not
feel burdened.

1309
01:38:08,732 --> 01:38:10,232
Bernard is a frugal man

1310
01:38:10,299 --> 01:38:12,334
and he does not like
to kiss me.

1311
01:38:14,871 --> 01:38:17,139
I once thought his appearance
would become more pleasing,

1312
01:38:17,206 --> 01:38:19,341
but, instead,
it's become more repulsive.

1313
01:38:20,442 --> 01:38:22,779
So I suppose I am relieved

1314
01:38:22,846 --> 01:38:23,880
about the kissing.

1315
01:38:26,816 --> 01:38:29,919
He is not like Jean,
handsome and generous.

1316
01:38:29,986 --> 01:38:32,655
My marriage is not
without its problems.

1317
01:38:43,365 --> 01:38:44,934
I shall be right with
you, ladies.

1318
01:38:45,001 --> 01:38:46,402
Thank you.

1319
01:39:18,467 --> 01:39:22,471
Despite Le Gris'
many deplorable qualities,

1320
01:39:22,538 --> 01:39:24,741
one cannot be blind
to his appearance.

1321
01:39:24,808 --> 01:39:25,875
Crude as he is.

1322
01:39:25,942 --> 01:39:27,476
Offensive as well.

1323
01:39:28,745 --> 01:39:31,447
- They're all such fools.
- Hmm.

1324
01:39:32,481 --> 01:39:33,983
Agreed.

1325
01:39:49,565 --> 01:39:51,266
Welcome back, sire.

1326
01:40:00,944 --> 01:40:02,511
Welcome home, my love.

1327
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,269
I am so happy
to see you.

1328
01:40:27,336 --> 01:40:29,438
My God, Marguerite,

1329
01:40:29,505 --> 01:40:30,974
have you lost your dignity?

1330
01:40:33,442 --> 01:40:37,346
Go upstairs before the
others think you a harlot.

1331
01:40:38,782 --> 01:40:40,682
I am your wife.

1332
01:40:51,593 --> 01:40:55,531
Welcome home,
my courageous son.

1333
01:40:56,065 --> 01:40:57,666
Thank you.

1334
01:40:57,734 --> 01:40:59,969
Had I seen the gown
or known it was being made,

1335
01:41:00,036 --> 01:41:01,004
I would've stopped it.

1336
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:07,643
And how would you have
done that in my household?

1337
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:09,478
I wonder.

1338
01:41:09,545 --> 01:41:13,415
Are you gonna let your wife
speak to me in a tone like this?

1339
01:41:13,482 --> 01:41:15,718
Marguerite is a grown
woman, Mother.

1340
01:41:15,785 --> 01:41:17,319
The decisions she makes
are her own.

1341
01:41:17,954 --> 01:41:19,823
As well as
the lessons learned.

1342
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:26,062
Tomorrow I must go to Paris.

1343
01:41:26,129 --> 01:41:27,496
I'll be away one week.

1344
01:41:27,563 --> 01:41:30,532
But you are ill.
You must stay here, indoors.

1345
01:41:30,599 --> 01:41:31,968
Yes, please stay.

1346
01:41:32,035 --> 01:41:33,002
I'm owed money.

1347
01:41:34,469 --> 01:41:37,406
- I intend to collect it.
- Of course.

1348
01:41:37,472 --> 01:41:40,043
Perhaps you may
visit some old friends.

1349
01:41:40,109 --> 01:41:41,978
Le Gris is in Argentan.

1350
01:41:43,112 --> 01:41:44,747
Why Le Gris?

1351
01:41:48,617 --> 01:41:51,620
Please ensure Alice is
with her while I'm away.

1352
01:41:52,621 --> 01:41:54,556
I forbid you from
leaving the grounds.

1353
01:41:55,758 --> 01:41:57,861
It's not safe.

1354
01:41:57,927 --> 01:41:59,661
I...

1355
01:41:59,729 --> 01:42:02,698
I should like to
see my friends.

1356
01:42:02,765 --> 01:42:04,666
We're so isolated.

1357
01:42:04,734 --> 01:42:06,135
Precisely.

1358
01:42:06,202 --> 01:42:07,402
Mm.

1359
01:42:21,951 --> 01:42:23,685
Whoa!

1360
01:42:23,753 --> 01:42:26,022
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

1361
01:42:26,089 --> 01:42:27,790
Well, when will
you return?

1362
01:42:27,857 --> 01:42:29,893
When my tasks
are completed.

1363
01:42:29,959 --> 01:42:31,828
Before nightfall.

1364
01:42:31,895 --> 01:42:34,364
Jean insisted I not be left alone.
You heard him.

1365
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:36,933
- Antoine!
- Hyah!

1366
01:42:48,443 --> 01:42:51,513
Sow!

1367
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:53,182
Eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve...

1368
01:43:02,457 --> 01:43:04,027
Stay.

1369
01:43:12,201 --> 01:43:14,070
Who is there?

1370
01:43:14,137 --> 01:43:16,139
It is I.

1371
01:43:16,205 --> 01:43:18,808
Adam Louvel, milady.

1372
01:43:19,541 --> 01:43:20,710
Uh...

1373
01:43:21,778 --> 01:43:23,445
Adam Louvel?

1374
01:43:27,482 --> 01:43:29,919
- Hello.
- I, uh...

1375
01:43:29,986 --> 01:43:32,654
I have a great favor
to ask.

1376
01:43:32,722 --> 01:43:35,058
My horse has thrown a shoe.
Uh...

1377
01:43:35,124 --> 01:43:37,160
Nobody is here. I am not
permitted to open the door.

1378
01:43:37,226 --> 01:43:39,195
Of course.
I understand.

1379
01:43:39,262 --> 01:43:40,897
If I could...

1380
01:43:40,964 --> 01:43:43,066
Could I wait inside
while he's reshod?

1381
01:43:43,132 --> 01:43:45,068
Just to warm myself
for a moment.

1382
01:43:45,134 --> 01:43:47,070
- I...
- Will not be long at all.

1383
01:43:47,136 --> 01:43:49,671
Uh, it's just
an inconvenience.

1384
01:43:49,739 --> 01:43:51,506
- I'm so sorry to have to ask.
- Please.

1385
01:43:54,978 --> 01:43:56,145
Oh, I'm not alone.

1386
01:43:58,147 --> 01:44:01,483
Milady, forgive me
for intruding.

1387
01:44:13,162 --> 01:44:14,464
I love you.

1388
01:44:16,099 --> 01:44:17,834
More than any other.

1389
01:44:19,701 --> 01:44:21,137
And I would do
anything for you.

1390
01:44:22,905 --> 01:44:24,907
Everything I have
is yours.

1391
01:44:26,109 --> 01:44:28,211
How can you
speak to me this way?

1392
01:44:28,277 --> 01:44:30,913
Marguerite, what way then
would I speak to you?

1393
01:44:32,815 --> 01:44:35,918
Milady must know
it cannot be helped.

1394
01:44:35,985 --> 01:44:39,222
My love for you
has consumed me.

1395
01:44:39,922 --> 01:44:41,257
How dare you?

1396
01:44:41,324 --> 01:44:42,859
Milady, when milord sets
his course for love...

1397
01:44:42,925 --> 01:44:44,127
You must leave now. Please.

1398
01:44:44,193 --> 01:44:45,828
You heard the lady!
Leave us.

1399
01:44:45,895 --> 01:44:46,863
Milord.

1400
01:44:57,340 --> 01:44:59,709
- I am married.
- Yes.

1401
01:45:01,077 --> 01:45:03,179
And you are saddled
with a terrible burden.

1402
01:45:04,814 --> 01:45:08,284
A cold, callous man who
does not love you as I do.

1403
01:45:08,351 --> 01:45:10,619
Who cannot appreciate you
for the marvel that you are.

1404
01:45:10,685 --> 01:45:12,955
Oh, please,
do not speak of my husband.

1405
01:45:13,022 --> 01:45:14,623
I want only
for your happiness.

1406
01:45:16,092 --> 01:45:20,595
I cannot bear to see
you in such hardship.

1407
01:45:20,662 --> 01:45:23,332
I know your house's
finances are fragile.

1408
01:45:23,399 --> 01:45:25,168
My lord provides for me.

1409
01:45:25,234 --> 01:45:26,335
Yes.

1410
01:45:31,841 --> 01:45:35,178
But does he know you
to be the most exquisite,

1411
01:45:35,244 --> 01:45:36,712
fascinating woman?

1412
01:45:38,314 --> 01:45:41,017
A woman I would devote
my whole life to.

1413
01:45:46,289 --> 01:45:48,891
Ah, hear me say
I'm in love with you.

1414
01:45:51,626 --> 01:45:53,262
And I know

1415
01:45:53,329 --> 01:45:54,730
you love me too.
You must.

1416
01:45:55,664 --> 01:45:58,167
You must leave.
Please.

1417
01:46:04,807 --> 01:46:06,042
Marguerite,
do not fight this.

1418
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:32,667
Jeanette!

1419
01:46:37,707 --> 01:46:39,108
Jeanette!

1420
01:46:42,311 --> 01:46:44,679
If you run,
I will only chase you.

1421
01:46:50,453 --> 01:46:51,988
Jeanette!

1422
01:46:57,894 --> 01:47:00,730
No! No!

1423
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:09,305
Come here.

1424
01:47:12,375 --> 01:47:13,675
No.

1425
01:47:16,145 --> 01:47:18,080
No!

1426
01:47:36,732 --> 01:47:39,835
No! No! No!

1427
01:48:05,228 --> 01:48:07,063
No!

1428
01:48:07,129 --> 01:48:09,031
No! Please.

1429
01:48:09,098 --> 01:48:12,068
- Shh.
- Please, don't do this.

1430
01:48:12,134 --> 01:48:14,470
Please.

1431
01:48:17,106 --> 01:48:19,942
This is our moment.

1432
01:49:06,088 --> 01:49:07,456
Please.

1433
01:49:39,055 --> 01:49:42,291
Oh,
you feel yourself guilty.

1434
01:49:42,358 --> 01:49:46,295
Oh, but, my love,
I beseech you, tell no one.

1435
01:49:46,362 --> 01:49:49,532
For your own safety.

1436
01:49:49,598 --> 01:49:52,335
If your husband hears of this,
he may kill you.

1437
01:49:52,401 --> 01:49:53,402
Say nothing.

1438
01:50:13,289 --> 01:50:15,391
Do not feel badly,
my love.

1439
01:50:17,326 --> 01:50:19,228
We could not
help ourselves.

1440
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:13,649
Milady, we've returned.

1441
01:51:24,693 --> 01:51:27,496
She was trying a new cook,
and the dish was quite tasty,

1442
01:51:27,563 --> 01:51:29,398
save for the cheese.

1443
01:51:29,465 --> 01:51:32,668
I've never enjoyed this particular
cheese, but sadly, it's everywhere.

1444
01:51:34,136 --> 01:51:35,438
Thank you.

1445
01:51:35,504 --> 01:51:38,073
There is one example,

1446
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:40,176
and I've forgotten
the name of it, um...

1447
01:51:41,510 --> 01:51:47,116
it has various colors laced through it.
Oh, uh...

1448
01:51:47,183 --> 01:51:49,418
Do you know
the name of this cheese?

1449
01:51:49,485 --> 01:51:52,054
I think that
it is Roquefort.

1450
01:51:52,121 --> 01:51:55,958
No. No, no, not Roquefort.
It's not as strong as Roquefort.

1451
01:51:56,025 --> 01:51:57,727
But it has a certain texture

1452
01:51:57,794 --> 01:51:59,562
that is very good in cookery.

1453
01:52:04,734 --> 01:52:07,036
Milady.

1454
01:52:07,102 --> 01:52:08,637
You haven't been eating.

1455
01:52:10,039 --> 01:52:11,574
Are you ill?

1456
01:52:14,543 --> 01:52:18,047
Lady Carrouges has enquired
about your state of mind.

1457
01:52:20,082 --> 01:52:23,385
Uh, my state of mind is fine.
Thank you, Alice.

1458
01:52:30,226 --> 01:52:32,595
Do not open the door.

1459
01:52:32,661 --> 01:52:35,498
It's Marie. I'm here to see Marguerite.
Is she in?

1460
01:52:38,234 --> 01:52:39,268
Fine.

1461
01:52:42,071 --> 01:52:43,239
It's me.

1462
01:52:46,675 --> 01:52:48,644
- Come on in.
- Good day.

1463
01:52:52,248 --> 01:52:54,149
Marguerite!

1464
01:52:55,251 --> 01:52:58,320
I've never felt such joy.
I'm pregnant.

1465
01:52:58,387 --> 01:52:59,723
I'm pregnant.

1466
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,530
Are you...
Are you all right?

1467
01:53:07,596 --> 01:53:09,231
You don't seem yourself.

1468
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,602
Are you not happy for me?

1469
01:53:13,669 --> 01:53:15,638
I'm so very pleased for you.

1470
01:53:27,082 --> 01:53:28,450
Sire.

1471
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:36,158
I have missed you.

1472
01:53:39,261 --> 01:53:42,097
Did you not miss me?

1473
01:53:42,164 --> 01:53:44,500
Oh, I missed you
more than you know.

1474
01:53:46,535 --> 01:53:49,305
- Then let us go to bed.
- Jean...

1475
01:53:49,371 --> 01:53:51,808
- Marguerite, I've been away for many days.
- I cannot.

1476
01:53:53,142 --> 01:53:55,177
What do you mean,
you cannot?

1477
01:53:58,748 --> 01:54:01,317
Well, um,
I need to tell you something.

1478
01:54:01,383 --> 01:54:02,418
What?

1479
01:54:10,927 --> 01:54:13,562
What?

1480
01:54:13,629 --> 01:54:17,299
While you were gone, there was a
day when your mother had business

1481
01:54:17,366 --> 01:54:18,634
in Saint Pierre.

1482
01:54:18,701 --> 01:54:19,769
Yes.

1483
01:54:21,236 --> 01:54:24,540
And shortly after,
a man came, unannounced.

1484
01:54:26,609 --> 01:54:28,845
I knew the man,
so I let him in.

1485
01:54:32,181 --> 01:54:33,850
But he was not alone.

1486
01:54:40,356 --> 01:54:43,592
Jacques Le Gris entered our home
without my permission and...

1487
01:54:43,659 --> 01:54:46,228
- What about Le Gris?
- He forced me to this room.

1488
01:54:47,262 --> 01:54:48,297
To this bed.

1489
01:54:54,603 --> 01:54:55,739
He raped me.

1490
01:54:57,774 --> 01:54:59,776
Are you telling me
the truth?

1491
01:55:00,376 --> 01:55:02,645
Please.

1492
01:55:02,712 --> 01:55:04,748
Are you
telling me the truth?

1493
01:55:04,814 --> 01:55:08,384
Jean, please! I am telling you the truth.
You must believe me.

1494
01:55:08,752 --> 01:55:10,386
I screamed.

1495
01:55:10,452 --> 01:55:11,755
I screamed until
I lost my voice.

1496
01:55:11,821 --> 01:55:12,789
He forced you?

1497
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:15,224
He raped me.

1498
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:17,226
- You did not provoke this?
- No, Jean.

1499
01:55:17,292 --> 01:55:18,427
Could you not run?

1500
01:55:18,494 --> 01:55:21,230
I was pinned down,
I could not breathe.

1501
01:55:29,538 --> 01:55:33,575
Can this
man do nothing but evil to me?

1502
01:55:38,681 --> 01:55:41,283
Jean, I intend
to speak the truth.

1503
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:43,185
I will not be silent.

1504
01:55:49,826 --> 01:55:52,561
I have no legal standing
without your support.

1505
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:05,274
Then you shall
have it.

1506
01:56:08,410 --> 01:56:09,645
Come.

1507
01:56:12,514 --> 01:56:14,884
I will not allow him to be the
last man to have known you.

1508
01:56:16,351 --> 01:56:17,721
- Jean...
- Come.

1509
01:56:23,325 --> 01:56:24,828
Come!

1510
01:56:28,564 --> 01:56:30,900
Milady,

1511
01:56:30,967 --> 01:56:33,469
do you swear upon your life

1512
01:56:33,535 --> 01:56:35,805
that what you say is true?

1513
01:56:37,406 --> 01:56:39,441
I swear it.

1514
01:56:39,508 --> 01:56:42,311
Will you swear it
before God?

1515
01:56:42,377 --> 01:56:43,880
And all of France?

1516
01:56:46,916 --> 01:56:48,852
I will.

1517
01:56:49,418 --> 01:56:50,552
Then we fight.

1518
01:56:51,888 --> 01:56:53,288
Marguerite is my wife

1519
01:56:54,389 --> 01:56:56,425
and we have been wronged.

1520
01:56:57,526 --> 01:56:59,695
I will not allow it
to go unpunished.

1521
01:56:59,763 --> 01:57:02,564
Your only avenue
is through Pierre.

1522
01:57:02,631 --> 01:57:04,399
Though I doubt he will
give you a hearing.

1523
01:57:04,466 --> 01:57:07,302
Tell the story
you heard today.

1524
01:57:07,369 --> 01:57:10,339
Tell it anywhere you can
and to all who will listen.

1525
01:57:10,405 --> 01:57:12,574
We will be the subject
of gossip.

1526
01:57:12,641 --> 01:57:15,677
If the story is known
across Normandy,

1527
01:57:15,745 --> 01:57:18,313
Pierre will have to
grant us a hearing.

1528
01:57:19,783 --> 01:57:21,450
We have a plan.

1529
01:57:33,495 --> 01:57:34,530
Marie?

1530
01:57:37,466 --> 01:57:38,835
Stay a while.

1531
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:42,806
Why can't you look at me?

1532
01:57:44,373 --> 01:57:45,708
I cannot.

1533
01:57:45,775 --> 01:57:46,843
Marie?

1534
01:57:47,844 --> 01:57:49,979
Do you not recall?

1535
01:57:50,046 --> 01:57:52,916
You said, on one or more occasions,
that you found Le Gris handsome.

1536
01:57:55,417 --> 01:57:56,451
So did you.

1537
01:57:57,452 --> 01:57:58,855
But I do not
complain of rape.

1538
01:57:58,922 --> 01:58:00,522
Marie!

1539
01:58:02,992 --> 01:58:04,359
You do not believe me.

1540
01:58:07,396 --> 01:58:08,664
I have to go.

1541
01:58:12,434 --> 01:58:16,471
No, Jean, no!
This is not what I want!

1542
01:58:16,538 --> 01:58:18,908
Not what you want?

1543
01:58:18,975 --> 01:58:22,712
Can he not simply be tried for
his crime in the courts?

1544
01:58:22,779 --> 01:58:25,681
Pierre is the courts!

1545
01:58:25,748 --> 01:58:28,417
If you appeal to the king,
he will only side with Pierre

1546
01:58:28,483 --> 01:58:29,719
as he has in the past.

1547
01:58:33,022 --> 01:58:36,525
I will not appeal
to the king.

1548
01:58:36,592 --> 01:58:39,394
I will appeal to God.

1549
01:58:47,436 --> 01:58:50,439
Marguerite,
why have you done this?

1550
01:58:50,505 --> 01:58:53,408
Because what happened
to me is wrong.

1551
01:58:53,475 --> 01:58:56,578
Men like Le Gris take
women when they want

1552
01:58:56,645 --> 01:58:58,447
and how often they want.

1553
01:58:59,749 --> 01:59:01,516
Who do you think you are?

1554
01:59:03,152 --> 01:59:04,888
My son may die.

1555
01:59:06,122 --> 01:59:08,992
That is his choice.
Not mine.

1556
01:59:09,058 --> 01:59:12,161
You are no different from the peasants
our soldiers have their way with

1557
01:59:12,228 --> 01:59:14,596
when they are at war.

1558
01:59:14,663 --> 01:59:16,665
Do they complain?

1559
01:59:16,733 --> 01:59:19,035
I cannot be silent.
I must speak.

1560
01:59:19,102 --> 01:59:21,070
Marguerite!

1561
01:59:21,137 --> 01:59:24,573
All you have done is
bring shame to our family.

1562
01:59:26,776 --> 01:59:28,111
I am telling the truth.

1563
01:59:28,177 --> 01:59:30,847
The truth
does not matter.

1564
01:59:34,616 --> 01:59:37,552
You look at me as if
I were never young.

1565
01:59:40,056 --> 01:59:42,091
I was raped.

1566
01:59:44,994 --> 01:59:48,697
And despite my protestations
and my revulsion,

1567
01:59:48,765 --> 01:59:51,533
did I go crying to my lord

1568
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:52,936
who had better things
to worry about?

1569
01:59:53,002 --> 01:59:55,570
No, I stood up,

1570
01:59:56,906 --> 01:59:58,708
got on with my life.

1571
01:59:58,775 --> 02:00:00,509
But at what cost?

1572
02:00:00,575 --> 02:00:01,811
At what cost?

1573
02:00:05,214 --> 02:00:08,084
I'm alive.

1574
02:00:08,151 --> 02:00:10,787
Well, you have paid a dear
price for that privilege.

1575
02:00:14,023 --> 02:00:18,094
I have heard from several
sources that you told others

1576
02:00:18,161 --> 02:00:21,130
you found
<i>Monsieur</i> Le Gris handsome.

1577
02:00:22,999 --> 02:00:28,637
Perhaps you dreamt
this event,

1578
02:00:28,704 --> 02:00:30,472
wishing it to be true.

1579
02:00:32,008 --> 02:00:36,079
Yes, a long time ago,
some friends and I agreed

1580
02:00:36,145 --> 02:00:39,648
that he was handsome, but I told them
that I knew him to be untrustworthy.

1581
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:46,588
Noticing a man is attractive
reveals nothing but that.

1582
02:00:52,694 --> 02:00:55,064
And if one of these
women is your dearest friend,

1583
02:00:55,131 --> 02:00:58,633
why would she bring this
information to the court?

1584
02:01:00,003 --> 02:01:01,636
I do not know.

1585
02:01:04,007 --> 02:01:07,509
You've been with Jean
de Carrouges for how many years?

1586
02:01:08,311 --> 02:01:09,644
Five.

1587
02:01:09,712 --> 02:01:11,748
In that time,

1588
02:01:11,814 --> 02:01:14,050
you've not carried a child,

1589
02:01:14,117 --> 02:01:15,818
an heir to the family name.

1590
02:01:15,885 --> 02:01:18,221
No, <i>monsieur.</i> No.

1591
02:01:19,789 --> 02:01:21,724
And yet,
here you are,

1592
02:01:21,791 --> 02:01:26,628
six months from the incident
you claim is true,

1593
02:01:26,695 --> 02:01:28,998
and you are
six months pregnant.

1594
02:01:30,833 --> 02:01:32,869
Perhaps you have
another lover

1595
02:01:32,935 --> 02:01:36,638
and accuse Le Gris
to hide this.

1596
02:01:36,705 --> 02:01:39,876
As I have said,
I am loyal to my husband.

1597
02:01:41,277 --> 02:01:44,247
Do you enjoy having
intercourse with your husband?

1598
02:01:50,685 --> 02:01:52,755
Yes, of course.

1599
02:01:52,822 --> 02:01:54,891
It is not
a matter of course.

1600
02:01:54,957 --> 02:01:57,592
You are fully aware that
you cannot conceive a child

1601
02:01:57,659 --> 02:01:59,162
unless you
experience pleasure

1602
02:01:59,228 --> 02:02:01,130
- at the end.
- Yes.

1603
02:02:01,197 --> 02:02:03,132
Yes.

1604
02:02:03,199 --> 02:02:07,569
And do you experience
pleasure at the end?

1605
02:02:13,843 --> 02:02:16,245
Yes. I do.

1606
02:02:16,312 --> 02:02:19,082
A rape cannot
cause a pregnancy.

1607
02:02:19,148 --> 02:02:21,017
This is just science.

1608
02:02:21,084 --> 02:02:23,719
It permits
the court to wonder

1609
02:02:23,786 --> 02:02:27,990
if after five years
of marital relations,

1610
02:02:28,057 --> 02:02:30,692
your pregnancy is

1611
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:33,662
a coincidence.

1612
02:02:33,729 --> 02:02:38,101
Let us say we believe
you are telling the truth

1613
02:02:38,167 --> 02:02:42,338
and such an act did,
in fact, take place,

1614
02:02:43,638 --> 02:02:45,942
perhaps you enjoyed it

1615
02:02:46,008 --> 02:02:49,112
more than you're
willing to admit.

1616
02:02:49,178 --> 02:02:52,715
Please, explain to me
how one is to enjoy rape.

1617
02:02:52,782 --> 02:02:56,219
Did you
experience pleasure?

1618
02:02:59,322 --> 02:03:00,790
Simply answer
the question.

1619
02:03:00,857 --> 02:03:03,025
I experienced no pleasure!

1620
02:03:08,131 --> 02:03:10,366
Are there
any more questions?

1621
02:03:16,671 --> 02:03:22,378
If your husband were to lose the duel,
it would demonstrate God's judgment

1622
02:03:22,445 --> 02:03:24,981
and reveal you for having
borne false witness.

1623
02:03:25,715 --> 02:03:27,283
I understand.

1624
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:29,852
I'm certain
your husband told you,

1625
02:03:29,919 --> 02:03:34,423
the penalty for bearing false
witness against a man by a woman,

1626
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:36,926
in the case of rape,

1627
02:03:36,993 --> 02:03:40,196
is that you are to be
stripped and shorn,

1628
02:03:41,864 --> 02:03:45,735
fitted by the neck
with an iron collar,

1629
02:03:45,801 --> 02:03:49,438
lashed to a wooden post,

1630
02:03:49,505 --> 02:03:51,374
and summarily burned alive.

1631
02:03:55,378 --> 02:03:57,346
Lady Marguerite...

1632
02:03:59,248 --> 02:04:01,951
it is quite common

1633
02:04:02,018 --> 02:04:06,189
for the accused to burn
for 20 to 30 minutes

1634
02:04:06,255 --> 02:04:08,090
before they are dead.

1635
02:04:29,879 --> 02:04:31,280
I am telling the truth.

1636
02:04:38,354 --> 02:04:40,056
We will proceed
with the duel.

1637
02:04:59,141 --> 02:05:01,477
You think Le Gris handsome,
do you?

1638
02:05:02,878 --> 02:05:04,447
You have disgraced me

1639
02:05:04,513 --> 02:05:07,016
before my king
and all of France.

1640
02:05:07,083 --> 02:05:10,519
You knew what would happen to
me should you lose this duel.

1641
02:05:10,586 --> 02:05:12,088
You knew and
you didn't tell me.

1642
02:05:12,154 --> 02:05:14,156
God will not punish
those who tell the truth.

1643
02:05:15,791 --> 02:05:18,294
My fate and our child's fate
will be written,

1644
02:05:18,361 --> 02:05:21,097
not by God's will,

1645
02:05:21,163 --> 02:05:23,532
but by which old man
will tire first.

1646
02:05:28,204 --> 02:05:30,039
How dare you
speak to me this way.

1647
02:05:30,106 --> 02:05:31,841
What have I to lose?

1648
02:05:31,908 --> 02:05:34,477
I begged you to find another way,
and now I may be burned alive.

1649
02:05:34,543 --> 02:05:36,812
- I am risking my life for you.
- Hmm.

1650
02:05:38,948 --> 02:05:42,184
You are risking my life

1651
02:05:42,251 --> 02:05:44,820
so you can fight your enemy
and save your pride.

1652
02:05:45,921 --> 02:05:48,357
And that could render
our child an orphan.

1653
02:05:50,860 --> 02:05:52,128
Or did you not
think of that?

1654
02:05:52,561 --> 02:05:54,330
You are a hypocrite.

1655
02:05:55,464 --> 02:05:57,400
You are blinded
by your vanity.

1656
02:06:15,584 --> 02:06:17,186
All the preparations
are made.

1657
02:06:18,354 --> 02:06:20,289
I'm ready.

1658
02:06:22,391 --> 02:06:25,161
I should like to stay
a while longer.

1659
02:06:27,897 --> 02:06:30,066
Faith, Marguerite.

1660
02:06:30,132 --> 02:06:33,436
I finally gave birth to a son who I love
more than I could have ever imagined...

1661
02:06:36,005 --> 02:06:38,507
and I may not live
to see him grow.

1662
02:06:43,145 --> 02:06:44,313
This was my life.

1663
02:06:47,049 --> 02:06:49,952
Had I had known the truth
would deprive me of this love,

1664
02:06:51,587 --> 02:06:55,257
I believe I would have done what
many women before me had done.

1665
02:06:58,060 --> 02:06:59,362
Nothing.

1666
02:07:00,996 --> 02:07:02,932
- What you did was right.
- Mm.

1667
02:07:03,499 --> 02:07:05,267
Not if I die.

1668
02:07:08,571 --> 02:07:10,106
I am not like you, Jean.

1669
02:07:14,143 --> 02:07:16,312
A child needs his mother

1670
02:07:16,379 --> 02:07:18,581
more than a mother
needs to be right.

1671
02:07:42,972 --> 02:07:44,940
Knights, proceed.

1672
02:08:18,374 --> 02:08:20,075
Lady,

1673
02:08:20,142 --> 02:08:21,711
upon your evidence,

1674
02:08:21,778 --> 02:08:26,015
I hazard my life in combat
with Jacques Le Gris.

1675
02:08:26,081 --> 02:08:29,151
You know my cause
is just and true.

1676
02:08:37,193 --> 02:08:40,129
I say before all of you,

1677
02:08:40,196 --> 02:08:43,466
I spoke the truth.

1678
02:08:43,532 --> 02:08:44,734
Let it be
in God's hands.

1679
02:09:14,263 --> 02:09:17,366
There'll be rough justice
this day by the grace of God.

1680
02:09:21,504 --> 02:09:24,741
Let us pray this ends
like the duel at Flanders.

1681
02:09:24,808 --> 02:09:29,746
With Le Gris in a wrestling match,
removing Carrouges' testicles by hand.

1682
02:09:32,214 --> 02:09:34,149
Let them go!

1683
02:09:34,216 --> 02:09:37,586
Let them go! Let them go!

1684
02:09:49,833 --> 02:09:51,667
Quickly! Give it to me!

1685
02:09:51,735 --> 02:09:54,670
Lance, lance! Hurry!

1686
02:09:54,738 --> 02:09:56,505
Whoa. Whoa!

1687
02:09:56,572 --> 02:09:57,774
Out of the way!

1688
02:10:16,793 --> 02:10:18,762
Lance! Lance!

1689
02:10:48,557 --> 02:10:49,525
Axe, axe!

1690
02:14:11,326 --> 02:14:12,829
Carrouges may yet
bleed out.

1691
02:14:12,896 --> 02:14:13,963
Pray God.

1692
02:14:20,502 --> 02:14:22,471
Kill him! Kill him!

1693
02:14:28,644 --> 02:14:31,380
- Kill him!
- Kill him! Kill him!

1694
02:15:27,170 --> 02:15:28,872
Confess!

1695
02:15:33,843 --> 02:15:35,677
Confess to me.

1696
02:15:37,646 --> 02:15:39,082
Carrouges, there was no rape.

1697
02:15:42,919 --> 02:15:45,554
There was no rape.

1698
02:15:48,457 --> 02:15:50,692
There was no rape!

1699
02:15:55,464 --> 02:15:57,466
In the name of God

1700
02:15:57,532 --> 02:16:00,770
and on the peril of
damnation of my soul,

1701
02:16:00,837 --> 02:16:03,438
I am innocent of the crime!

1702
02:16:07,542 --> 02:16:09,746
Then you be damned.

1703
02:16:27,864 --> 02:16:29,966
Yes.

1704
02:17:21,851 --> 02:17:24,220
God be with
you, milady.

1705
02:17:32,295 --> 02:17:34,897
No...
Rise. You rise.

1706
02:17:36,733 --> 02:17:40,502
I grace you
with honor, knight.

1707
02:17:40,569 --> 02:17:42,671
God has spoken,

1708
02:17:42,739 --> 02:17:47,243
proving your cause
to be truthful and just.

1709
02:17:47,310 --> 02:17:51,546
You have fought
with strength and humility.

1710
02:17:51,613 --> 02:17:55,184
May God be with you
and your wife.

1711
02:17:57,987 --> 02:17:59,088
Your wife.

1712
02:19:33,216 --> 02:19:35,251
Long live Carrouges!

1713
02:19:39,055 --> 02:19:40,256
Carrouges!

1714
02:19:44,026 --> 02:19:45,962
The glory of Carrouges!

1715
02:19:50,433 --> 02:19:51,934
Carrouges!

1716
02:22:28,024 --> 02:22:29,425
Look at that!

1717
