Prime Minister,
but-but there was a,

1197
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:41,350
- there's a, you know...
- Do you know what I was

1198
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,290
in the room with, English?

1199
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,220
Your file, which I've read
in its entirety.

1200
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,420
And I have a few questions.
Did you or did you not

1201
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:49,460
burn the Côte de Roc restaurant
in Antibes to the ground?

1202
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:53,130
- Um...
- And did you or did you not fire a guided missile

1203
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,970
at a peloton
of French cyclists?

1204
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:57,440
- W-Well...
- Before commandeering

1205
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,240
an open-top bus and tossing
the tour guide off the top deck

1206
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,910
and then assaulting
an 82-year-old grandmother

1207
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:03,440
in a sandwich shop
before battering

1208
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,010
the employee
of said sandwich shop

1209
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:07,540
with two organic
sourdough baguette?

1210
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,310
Uh, I don't remember...

1211
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,550
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to be me?

1212
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:16,550
- Uh...
- Hmm?

1213
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:19,060
Do you have
even the foggiest notion

1214
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,060
of how virtually
impossible it is

1215
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:24,190
to get anything done
in the face of events

1216
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,060
and facts and voters

1217
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:30,930
and that tsunami of tosspots
we call the national press?

1218
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:34,440
Finally I get the chance to do
something good for my country,

1219
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,600
and what happens?

1220

The universe sends me you.

Well, do you know what I say?

1222
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,980
I say "up the universe's arse!"

1223

And do you know
what else I say?

You're fired
with immediate effect.
