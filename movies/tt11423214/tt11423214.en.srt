3
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,530
Stop!

4
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:04,197
Stop.

5
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:08,368
Stop, I'll do it.

6
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,538
Please, I'll obey.

7
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:17,377
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
just give me another chance.

8
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,614
I'll do what you ask. Please.

9
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,217
I'm sorry!

10
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:28,455
Sorry, I'll do better, please!

11
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:02,215
Get... let me go,
get off of me!

12
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,885
No!

13
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,318
Get in.

14
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:43,658
Sofia, you look completely
lovely this afternoon.

15
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,292
Absolutely perfect.

16
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,295
Now purse your lips.

17
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,531
That's it, just purse your lips.

18
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:59,607
Now, do you want
to please your man?

19
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,743
Yes?

20
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,377
Do anything he wants you to do.

21
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,281
You'll suck his cock daily.

22
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,817
Anything.

23
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:13,420
Good.

24
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,087
No, no!

25
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:48,990
Don't fight back.

26
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,424
Don't fight back, Lorian.

27
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,528
How do you know my name?

28
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,632
You have women here?

29
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,536
There's a cost
for everything beautiful.

30
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:03,871
Do you understand?

31
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:06,941
No.

32
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,377
No.

33
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:14,816
No, no, don't, don't.

34
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,520
There you go.

35
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:21,022
Good.

36
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,529
Now be still.

37
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:40,942
Look at that.

38
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,880
The best America has to offer.

39
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,118
Blonde and blue eyes.

40
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:53,988
The Führer would be so proud.

41
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,992
We had to make up

42
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:02,063
for our Heinrich's indulgence.

43
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,931
We couldn't help it though.

44
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:07,635
It's always your fault.

45
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,637
Do you understand?

46
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:12,840
Wait.

47
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,142
Wait.

48
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:22,817
You're such a disappointment,
Misha.

49
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,151
You're quite stupid, aren't you?

50
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:27,121
I got her, like you wanted,
and she's beautiful!

51
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,123
Even more than the others.

52
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:32,126
Beauty is a gift
you do not possess.

53
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,795
You could have.

54
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,164
It's too late now.

55
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,851
And if you keep sampling
the merchandise,

56
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,119
you'll diminish it.

57
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,220
I didn't touch her.

58
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,757
women
that weren't like you.

59
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:11,065
Look at you with your ugly hair
and your clown makeup.

60
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,735
You call yourself a woman?

61
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:21,943
And yet you make the girls up
very nicely,

62
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:24,845
but you do nothing with yourself
just to piss me off.

63
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,522
Why did you marry me then?

64
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,592
Just get our next Sofia ready.

65
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,534
It's no longer the same.

66
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:25,239
And they can't possibly
understand what that means.

67
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,642
But they will.

68
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,629
Hello?

69
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,834
Can you hear me?

70
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,743
Fuck!

71
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:59,019
Well, aren't you the picture
of beauty today, Lorian West?

72
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:02,022
Hmm?

73
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,490
Except that's
an unfortunate injury.

74
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:04,792
Let me have a look.

75
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,532
It's probably just
a light sprain.

76
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,370
Please let me go.

77
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:22,042
This place is full of dangers.

78
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:25,446
A person could easily hurt
themselves falling

79
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,349
on a rusty rake or pushing
too hard against a balcony.

80
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:30,851
This is just
a temporary place for us,

81
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:34,088
a waystation... of sorts.

82
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,890
For you, perhaps a crossroads.

83
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,425
Are you going to kill me?

84
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,395
Of course not.

85
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,164
A slight sprain.

86
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,433
You won't be able to run away,
but you'll be fine.

87
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:49,136
I think you know
my wife Misha already.

88
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,314
Let's get some ice on it.

89
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,016
You're, uh...

90
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,053
You're different.

91
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:18,899
We will punish you.

92
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,202
You don't seem to understand.

93
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:30,177
You traffic women.

94
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:34,048
We create beauty,

95
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:37,951
and we follow
a very high standard,

96
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:42,089
including the selection process.

97
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:45,893
Only when the change is complete
do we deliver.

98
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,428
A change?

99
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,033
Being curious won't help you.

100
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,402
Being obedient will.

101
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,661
Who are you?

102
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,198
Mm, no one.

103
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,434
No, no, no.

104
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,669
Wait.

105
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:04,238
Wait!

106
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:53,120
I'll survive it
and attain what you have!

107
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:56,056
You have no idea.

108
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,191
Aqua Velva.

109
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:23,150
You have eaten from the tree.

110
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,219
Now you will be as we.

111
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,321
My success is inevitable.

112
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:16,531
Oh my God!

113
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:31,211
You know, it's up to Heinrich

114
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:35,917
about letting you live
and selling you to a client.

115
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,687
At least you're not like
the others.

116
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,357
I have to go back.

117
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:49,296
Look up Revelation 18.

118
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:55,637
I'm not... I'm not really
a Bible person.

119
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:02,910
Can you get me
the keys to the car?

120
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,385
I'm not really
of my own free will,

121
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:15,288
or else I would...

122
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,525
I would kill them both.

123
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,930
Who controls you?

124
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,735
Look, he's gonna...
he's gonna come in here

125
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:28,970
and try to change you.

126
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:31,572
You just gotta go along,
you play the game.

127
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:35,409
You aren't who
you think you are.

128
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,845
I know that's hard
to understand.

129
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,381
You're the opposition.

130
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:47,922
I see things.

131
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:50,457
I see you getting out of here,

132
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,761
and that is
a one-time opportunity.

133
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:57,865
Well, well, well.

134
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,934
Isn't this nice?

135
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,804
You!

136
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:04,839
Out now!

137
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,841
Now!

138
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,544
You, look at me.

139
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:11,946
Look at me.

140
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:13,848
You stay put,

141
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,750
or next time it's your foot.

142
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:17,618
Do you understand?

143
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:22,023
Out!

144
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,891
Get the fuck out!

145
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,586
You just hate beautiful women.

146
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:55,355
You are to stay out of sight
and not mess with her.

147
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,758
That's 300K in there,

148
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,560
now maybe docked to 275
because of that toe.

149
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:03,363
Which you, Misha, cut off.

150
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,770
You did, by breaking the rules.

151
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:11,639
The rules?

152
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:15,408
We have rules now?

153
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,745
You know what you should do?
You should write them out

154
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,447
and then post them
on the internet.

155
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:25,052
You cold, miserable bitch!

156
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:28,355
I am a happily married woman.

157
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,063
Then, uh, why does Daddy
like fucking me

158
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:39,000
more than he likes fucking you?

159
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,036
You're lying.

160
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,574
You want me to comfort you?

161
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,745
It's all in your head.

162
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:55,482
They track you.

163
00:21:55,516 --> 00:21:58,853
You're becoming them.

164
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:00,855
Legion.

165
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:15,136
Why did you cut off my toe?

166
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,604
Ow!

167
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:18,139
Stop.

168
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:25,546
Honey, you need to do
exactly what you're told

169
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,983
if you want to live.

170
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,651
There's two ways this goes:

171
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:33,888
one, you're in a private jet
looking all pretty,

172
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:37,490
or two, you're pig food,

173
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:40,161
or three, there's always three.

174
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:43,564
So you should do everything
you can to protect me.

175
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:46,100
I can't promise anything
anymore.

176
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,506
Heinrich is quite something.

177
00:22:55,076 --> 00:22:58,079
Dark, bad boy,

178
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:00,047
with that sort of...

179
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:02,917
cosmopolitan trashy charm.

180
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:07,121
Sophisticated.

181
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:12,159
That just reels you in.

182
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,965
You can't resist, you know?

183
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:22,169
The dark power.

184
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:27,174
Ah-ah-ah.

185
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:32,813
Don't harm the merchandise.

186
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:40,054
You're not like the others.

187
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:45,793
But let me tell you something.

188
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:49,496
You won't even remember
your own face

189
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,232
when this is all over.

190
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:26,600
Costin' me money.

191
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:30,504
Look, I don't know
and I don't care

192
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:32,907
what kinda spooky shit
you got goin' on out here,

193
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,976
but we need product,
you understand?

194
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:37,712
Well, this is not
an exact science.

195
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:39,513
There's a spiritual dimension
as well.

196
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:42,883
Sometimes they...
they just don't make it.

197
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:47,021
Hmm, well, we're very happy
with the work so far, so...

198
00:24:47,054 --> 00:24:48,823
here's a gift.

199
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:52,059
The Holy Grail.

200
00:24:55,796 --> 00:24:58,032
Which we lovingly call
Aqua Velva,

201
00:24:58,065 --> 00:24:59,934
one of the greatest
quantum breakthroughs

202
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:01,969
of the last 200 years.

203
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:10,011
Nobody makes dolls
like you, Heinrich.

204
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:11,645
I know.

205
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,215
- That shit cracks you up.
- I know.

206
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,618
I'm gonna go upstairs,

207
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:20,988
dip the old wick, as they say.

208
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:29,864
You just don't understand
what I really am.

209
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:18,846
Ow.

210
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,381
Sorry.

211
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:24,752
I told him not to,
but he don't much listen to me.

212
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:26,220
Help me please.

213
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:32,159
You are very...

214
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:34,061
very nice.

215
00:26:34,095 --> 00:26:35,262
Let me go, okay?

216
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:37,164
I'll cooperate, just...

217
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,369
- My boyfriend, he's...
- Yeah, your boyfriend.

218
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:44,004
Jeff Blake?

219
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:48,109
- Can you call him?
- Sure.

220
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:51,879
You know he's the one
who set you up, right?

221
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:56,217
Oh, yeah, I mean, without him,

222
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,252
we wouldn't even know about you.

223
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,288
I can't believe that.

224
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:04,058
Mm-hmm.

225
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:06,060
Come on, look at you.

226
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:07,995
Why do you think
he was with you?

227
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:11,932
It sure must hurt, huh?

228
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:18,672
Detective Hennigan's
on the case.

229
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:20,841
And your parents?

230
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,710
They just hired my buddy,
Shawn James,

231
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:24,311
best damn P.I. in the state,

232
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:27,047
when good old Jeff,
your trusty boyfriend

233
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:29,917
reported you missin'.

234
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,286
Oh...

235
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,822
they all report to me.

236
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:37,158
Well, see,

237
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:39,260
I ain't just a sheriff.

238
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:10,324
It's girls like you
they want these days, Lori.

239
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:13,994
All-American beauty and brains.

240
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:17,264
Industry's really changin'.

241
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:20,234
So you won't mind me.

242
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:25,139
They'll be fucking you...

243
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,508
over...

244
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:32,379
...and over and over.

245
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:40,187
And you'll like it eventually.

246
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:42,223
I just hope you don't get
some psycho

247
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:44,258
who's into chainsaws and shit.

248
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:57,004
Oh, man.

249
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:59,406
No blue pill necessary.

250
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,118
That toe.

251
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:14,788
Oh, it was a mistake.

252
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:17,791
- It might cost us.
- That's all you care about?

253
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,862
I ain't gonna hurt you...

254
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:23,264
much.

255
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:26,834
Get off!

256
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:34,942
Goddamn bitch!

257
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:42,049
Fuck!

258
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:55,597
Time for you to become
a lovely woman.

259
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,168
You pull some shit like you did
with Maddox earlier,

260
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:03,871
and I'm gonna gut you
like a pig.

261
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:51,151
Open your eyes, Sofia.

262
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,320
Open your eyes.

263
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:55,389
Now, you were given
a mind-expanding substance

264
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:57,925
along with something else
to subdue you for long enough

265
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,527
for this to take hold.

266
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:01,261
You might call it
a date-rape drug.

267
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:03,063
Now, what color
am I holding up?

268
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:06,367
Blue.

269
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,104
Blue, very good, perfect.

270
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:11,905
Now you'll become my doll.

271
00:32:58,178 --> 00:33:00,414
Show me the way,

272
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,182
You're a doll.

273
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:36,518
Hmm?

274
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:38,085
Play with yourself.

275
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,428
I know.

276
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:52,399
I know, I know.

277
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:02,677
You are Sofia.

278
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,445
I want you,

279
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:08,348
Heinrich.

280
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:11,118
But you must be prescient
as well.

281
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:12,654
We can work on that.

282
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:13,688
Heinrich?

283
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:16,824
Lorian, you're beginning
to anticipate my needs.

284
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,530
Who do I rule over?

285
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:26,701
Are you chosen?

286
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:31,365
Maybe this time
you'll do what we ask,

287
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:34,401
but if you do not comply,

288
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:36,436
you know.

289
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:45,439
I know that look.

290
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:52,479
You are the power.

291
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,454
Rule over me.

292
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:31,418
Well!

293
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:34,822
- Oh, yeah!
- The latest Sofia.

294
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:36,557
Mmm.

295
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,829
Heinrich,
you're a goddamn genius.

296
00:37:41,863 --> 00:37:43,831
Yes, well,
the price has gone up.

297
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:47,802
Unfortunately, the cost
of materials is skyrocketing.

298
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,705
You're short this month.

299
00:37:50,738 --> 00:37:51,939
Yes, I know, I can explain...

300
00:37:51,973 --> 00:37:54,709
The AV is screwing
with your brain,

301
00:37:54,742 --> 00:37:55,910
your judgment.

302
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:57,578
We needed two this month.

303
00:37:57,612 --> 00:37:59,680
Now one's feral,
another one's dead.

304
00:37:59,714 --> 00:38:02,482
- Yes, I can explain that.
- Don't even try.

305
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:05,820
How did you know...

306
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:08,723
...that one is dead?

307
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:12,059
And they thought the Aqua Velva
was gonna enhance your work.

308
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:15,495
Don't worry,
you'll meet your quota.

309
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:20,601
You know that I spent
my whole life in the program.

310
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:25,039
The reason I left is because
there's no creativity anymore.

311
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:28,475
It's just meddling.

312
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:31,546
These dumb-fuck bureaucrats
run the world now.

313
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:33,548
Well,

314
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:36,416
that's why you're here
and they're not.

315
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,953
Take your time.

316
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,788
Thank you,
because I was beginning to think

317
00:38:40,822 --> 00:38:43,024
that you were all about
quantity over quality.

318
00:38:44,926 --> 00:38:48,830
The client's extremely pleased,
so fuck you, Heinrich, you win.

319
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:50,665
More money!

320
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,936
Simpleton.

321
00:38:57,638 --> 00:39:00,107
It's not too late.

322
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:03,511
Don't stay there.

323
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:05,746
You need me?

324
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,583
You're still here.

325
00:39:08,616 --> 00:39:12,419
Tell me about, uh, your life.

326
00:39:12,452 --> 00:39:14,155
You have a boyfriend?

327
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:20,094
Where do you work?

328
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:22,797
What makes you happy?

329
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,901
Your hands are warm.

330
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:38,613
We can help each other.

331
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:43,985
I was, uh...

332
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:48,589
I wanted to be successful.

333
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:55,529
My parents were racists.

334
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:57,965
I don't think that now.

335
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:02,870
When I was a little girl,

336
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:04,639
I had a pet hamster.

337
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,176
My brother killed it.

338
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,912
Her.

339
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:13,681
Sadie.

340
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:19,186
I had no idea what that meant.

341
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:26,794
Heinrich is under their control.

342
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:31,232
I think he loves me.

343
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:35,036
We can help each other.

344
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:36,938
You're my friend.

345
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:40,207
I'm not really anything.

346
00:42:19,673 --> 00:42:21,742
Anything?

347
00:42:21,776 --> 00:42:24,111
All right, last one.

348
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:46,100
Don't go where
they want you to go.

349
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:47,902
Look at me.

350
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,236
Look at me!

351
00:42:51,972 --> 00:42:55,242
My life, my joke life,

352
00:42:55,276 --> 00:42:59,346
isn't... wasn't... real anyway.

353
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,183
None of it ever has been.

354
00:43:02,216 --> 00:43:04,685
It's really your joke.

355
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,156
I'm your sick joke.

356
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,859
I'm not going back.

357
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:14,028
I can't be programmed.

358
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:17,832
Even if I get out of here,
I am not going back.

359
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:23,137
Everything is fake.

360
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:26,774
A box within a box within a box.

361
00:43:31,846 --> 00:43:33,214
A game.

362
00:43:35,182 --> 00:43:38,119
It's so much easier
than real life.

363
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:44,125
In a way.

364
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:39,813
So, we're talking to our guest,
Lorian West,

365
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:42,049
about her time
as a travel editor

366
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:44,251
at the Denver Post.

367
00:44:44,285 --> 00:44:45,719
Not me.

368
00:44:47,087 --> 00:44:48,088
Going to work.

369
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:54,028
Having a boyfriend.

370
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:57,164
Going to a political rally.

371
00:44:57,198 --> 00:44:58,399
Going to a party.

372
00:45:00,968 --> 00:45:03,270
Cruise.

373
00:45:03,304 --> 00:45:06,508
A vacation.

374
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:09,843
Selling them all.

375
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:12,446
Plotting your way
into the winner's circle.

376
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:14,516
So?

377
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,954
So, bend or break.

378
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:24,191
Okay, so what do you mean?

379
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:30,497
Perfect.

380
00:45:30,532 --> 00:45:33,400
Break this.

381
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:06,568
They program you to accept,

382
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:11,573
but they have no idea that they
are a program of a program.

383
00:46:11,606 --> 00:46:15,075
They programmed me
before they took me.

384
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:17,278
I'm a program clone.

385
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:09,129
I'm not going back.

386
00:47:17,605 --> 00:47:20,240
This is the key.

387
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:22,577
Pure DMT and a mix
of other hallucinogens

388
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:25,580
beyond what a human
can possibly process.

389
00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:30,552
Now we'll complete
the treatment.

390
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:34,888
Do you know that I developed
this technique

391
00:47:34,922 --> 00:47:36,558
over 20 years ago?

392
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:40,461
It's extraordinary.

393
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:47,669
Legion.

394
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:51,372
Legion.

395
00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:04,251
The time will come.

396
00:48:22,136 --> 00:48:24,037
Well done.

397
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:25,573
You think so?

398
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:30,545
Yes, I think we're ready
for the grand finale.

399
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:32,680
What if she fails?

400
00:48:34,649 --> 00:48:36,618
Why this sudden concern?

401
00:48:36,651 --> 00:48:39,019
I don't want to die.

402
00:48:46,193 --> 00:48:48,295
But you do.

403
00:48:55,302 --> 00:48:56,270
Now!

404
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:03,076
Here, Misha.

405
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,312
You can't practice enough.

406
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:15,222
Go!

407
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,398
There, you wanna try?

408
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,441
Now!

409
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,050
Don't worry, don't think,
just anticipate.

410
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:44,552
Okay?

411
00:49:44,586 --> 00:49:46,754
Try again.

412
00:49:46,788 --> 00:49:47,789
Go!

413
00:50:00,568 --> 00:50:03,571
Now, Sofia...

414
00:50:05,807 --> 00:50:08,175
Put the barrel in your mouth.

415
00:50:13,748 --> 00:50:16,618
Sofia, place the barrel
in your mouth.

416
00:50:17,652 --> 00:50:19,486
I told you.

417
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,836
Now pull the trigger.

418
00:50:46,446 --> 00:50:47,782
Did you put the word out, Misha?

419
00:50:47,815 --> 00:50:49,017
I did.

420
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:52,286
One must sacrifice the innocent
to save the.

421
00:50:58,225 --> 00:50:59,627
Beautiful.

422
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:03,463
Sometimes, we must kill
what we love.

423
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:26,153
That's it.

424
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,204
You know, there's more
to the vetting process

425
00:51:44,237 --> 00:51:45,372
than we let on.

426
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:49,811
But you thought
I just sold all my dolls

427
00:51:49,844 --> 00:51:51,546
to some foreign customers.

428
00:51:55,215 --> 00:51:56,316
I'm dizzy.

429
00:52:02,624 --> 00:52:03,858
I'm very selective

430
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:05,860
and very successful.

431
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:09,831
I almost don't want
to let you go.

432
00:52:09,864 --> 00:52:11,398
I think you should
come with us to Switzerland.

433
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:12,800
It's beautiful
this time of year

434
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:14,702
and I think it would be
wonderful for you.

435
00:52:24,746 --> 00:52:25,913
Priceless.

436
00:52:30,785 --> 00:52:34,221
You're so special.

437
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:35,790
It doesn't work on you,
does it?

438
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:40,762
Fucking bitch!

439
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:43,564
You ruined everything.

440
00:52:43,598 --> 00:52:45,600
You fucking ruined everything!

441
00:53:39,486 --> 00:53:42,657
You like it, don't you?

442
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:43,825
Huh?

443
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:49,463
Does it make you happy, huh?

444
00:53:57,538 --> 00:53:59,807
Shit.

445
00:53:59,841 --> 00:54:02,610
Yeah?

446
00:54:02,643 --> 00:54:05,680
Yeah, yeah,
I'm almost there, man, goddamn.

447
00:54:05,713 --> 00:54:08,315
I'll be there soon.

448
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:09,717
Yeah.

449
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:10,985
See y'all there.

450
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:29,302
Woo!

451
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,011
Woo!

452
00:54:49,023 --> 00:54:50,792
Beer?

453
00:54:50,825 --> 00:54:52,727
Hell yeah!

454
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,428
All right, woo!

455
00:55:09,744 --> 00:55:11,813
I want some pussy!

456
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:17,618
Yeah?

457
00:55:17,652 --> 00:55:19,587
Oh, shit!

458
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,855
How you doing there, Billy?

459
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:25,492
You ready now?

460
00:55:25,526 --> 00:55:26,994
Ooh, I never been so ready.

461
00:55:27,028 --> 00:55:28,596
Let's go.

462
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,574
I guess I'll leave you two
alone now.

463
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:30,658
Here I come, baby.

464
00:56:35,763 --> 00:56:37,665
Oh, you're so beautiful...

465
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,469
W-What the fuck?

466
00:56:42,502 --> 00:56:43,738
It's quite all right,
just relax.

467
00:56:43,771 --> 00:56:46,741
Who the fuck are you?

468
00:56:46,774 --> 00:56:48,709
Ah, ladies.

469
00:56:48,743 --> 00:56:50,711
Now, Sofia.

470
00:56:50,745 --> 00:56:53,681
Let's see what you think
of this situation.

471
00:56:53,714 --> 00:56:59,553
This... man
is about to fuck a corpse.

472
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:00,688
A dead body.

473
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:02,924
Is that sick or what?

474
00:57:10,598 --> 00:57:11,766
Hm?

475
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:16,070
Unfortunately,

476
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:18,072
for organ harvesting,

477
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:19,707
this one is out.

478
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:23,511
Is this acceptable to you,
Sofia?

479
00:57:23,544 --> 00:57:27,848
That this pig-man
would fuck a dead body?

480
00:57:32,153 --> 00:57:34,622
Shoot this piece of shit twice.

481
00:57:34,655 --> 00:57:36,057
In the face.

482
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,025
Hey, I paid by credit card.

483
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:39,727
Yes, we're very grateful.

484
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,029
You think you can just shoot me
and get away with it?

485
00:57:42,063 --> 00:57:43,631
Clients, they know where I am!

486
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:49,236
Dumb shits!

487
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,938
You'll pay.

488
00:58:00,548 --> 00:58:03,017
Somehow, I don't think so.

489
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:07,054
Hey, you!

490
00:58:07,088 --> 00:58:09,023
Shit-for-brains!

491
00:58:15,196 --> 00:58:18,232
Do you need help?

492
00:58:18,265 --> 00:58:19,567
Hm?

493
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:28,776
You should be playing.

494
00:58:41,222 --> 00:58:44,658
Daddy.

495
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:47,762
I've been bad.

496
00:58:49,797 --> 00:58:51,165
What?

497
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:32,006
Well, welcome.

498
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:33,774
How lovely you look
this evening.

499
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:42,016
- Thank you for inviting me.
- My pleasure.

500
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:51,692
Well, drink?

501
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:53,861
To you, dear one.

502
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:57,331
You've certainly
shown me something.

503
00:59:57,364 --> 00:59:59,333
You're indeed superior
in a manner of speaking,

504
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:01,402
and I have an announcement
to make.

505
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:06,907
You, Lorian,
are not a true Sofia.

506
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:09,977
No, don't be disappointed.

507
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,312
There's far more to do.

508
01:00:22,323 --> 01:00:24,091
To a prosperous future.

509
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:38,005
Things are looking up.

510
01:00:42,443 --> 01:00:45,412
You're very handsome tonight.

511
01:00:45,446 --> 01:00:46,780
Thank you.

512
01:01:09,103 --> 01:01:10,137
What is this?

513
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:16,210
Say hello to Lorian.

514
01:01:16,243 --> 01:01:17,244
Please.

515
01:01:17,278 --> 01:01:20,447
Wow.

516
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,763
Oh! I'll have some of that.

517
01:01:35,796 --> 01:01:37,097
Mmm.

518
01:01:45,439 --> 01:01:47,074
Yucky.

519
01:01:51,546 --> 01:01:53,747
You just think
you're so smart,

520
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:55,349
making the live sex toys

521
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:58,219
for the erectile
dysfunction set.

522
01:01:58,252 --> 01:02:00,120
You're a throwback
to an antiquated science,

523
01:02:00,154 --> 01:02:03,525
a dumb, brute force
used during World War II.

524
01:02:03,558 --> 01:02:06,260
Trauma creates more trauma.

525
01:02:06,293 --> 01:02:08,495
It's not just manipulation
of personality

526
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,631
and mental cognition,

527
01:02:09,664 --> 01:02:12,399
behavioral modification
and predictive programming.

528
01:02:15,202 --> 01:02:20,174
Splitting off opens for
the other side to infiltrate,

529
01:02:20,207 --> 01:02:23,477
and fail,
as they always do!

530
01:02:23,511 --> 01:02:25,946
Dissociation
and reprogramming.

531
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,516
The future grid is
nanodigitization

532
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:31,485
of the freaking universe!

533
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:35,055
Time and space.

534
01:02:35,089 --> 01:02:37,858
Mass consciousness
as the weapon of choice,

535
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:40,995
game theory
at the molecular point,

536
01:02:41,028 --> 01:02:46,800
at the biodigital...
nexus point.

537
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:49,537
You guys get it?

538
01:02:49,571 --> 01:02:52,574
It's called...
it's called technology!

539
01:02:54,141 --> 01:02:56,877
It's macro now, not micro,
uh-uh.

540
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:59,380
That's where the real money is,
you know?

541
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:02,916
Like, money?
Money, money?

542
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,552
What? Did you think
they were gonna pay you

543
01:03:04,586 --> 01:03:06,420
for a new Sofia?

544
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:12,926
That's funny.

545
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,564
You're just their little...
their little pet.

546
01:03:16,598 --> 01:03:17,898
Like a little kitty-kat.

547
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:22,870
We are leaving now.

548
01:03:22,903 --> 01:03:24,305
Lorian,
you're coming with me.

549
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:26,574
Gimme the fucking
smart keys, and yes,

550
01:03:26,608 --> 01:03:27,776
I do know what I mean,

551
01:03:27,808 --> 01:03:31,979
so stuff that forlorn look
up your tiny ass, sweetie pie.

552
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:39,219
Your generation just
doesn't understand quality.

553
01:03:39,253 --> 01:03:41,523
Or making things the right way,
the real way.

554
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:44,925
Step by step, by hand.

555
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,860
Keys! Now.

556
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:54,335
Smart keys.

557
01:03:56,337 --> 01:03:57,404
You bitch!

558
01:03:57,438 --> 01:03:59,373
Fuck!

559
01:03:59,406 --> 01:04:00,974
- Fuck.
- What?

560
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:02,476
You don't know anything
all of a sudden?

561
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:08,449
Uggh!

562
01:04:10,484 --> 01:04:11,318
Smart key.

563
01:04:11,352 --> 01:04:12,920
You have no fucking idea
how much damage

564
01:04:12,953 --> 01:04:14,488
- you have caused.
- I'm sure that you have

565
01:04:14,522 --> 01:04:16,990
added it all up
and calculated to the penny,

566
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:19,026
right?

567
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,227
Thank you!

568
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,395
Let's go.

569
01:04:38,412 --> 01:04:39,913
Motherfucker!

570
01:05:04,271 --> 01:05:06,140
Whiny.

571
01:05:06,173 --> 01:05:07,675
We could have sold her.

572
01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:10,411
But no, no, no, no, no,
you had to interfere.

573
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:13,947
Interfere with his brilliance,
with his process.

574
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:15,717
You hurt us.

575
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,284
Us?

576
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:24,391
Us? There is no us for you!

577
01:05:30,765 --> 01:05:32,700
All right, don't hurt her
too much, Misha.

578
01:05:32,734 --> 01:05:34,201
Stop, Misha!

579
01:05:34,234 --> 01:05:36,638
Why do you always have
to protect Charlotte?

580
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:37,539
It's about time you realized

581
01:05:37,572 --> 01:05:39,973
that your precious Lorian
is a failure

582
01:05:40,007 --> 01:05:41,408
and now we have to find her.

583
01:05:41,442 --> 01:05:44,445
I'm sure Maddox
has her already.

584
01:05:44,478 --> 01:05:45,979
Happy now?

585
01:06:25,653 --> 01:06:27,354
Hey, baby!

586
01:06:27,387 --> 01:06:30,758
How you doin' this evening?

587
01:06:30,792 --> 01:06:34,228
Hey. You okay, honey?

588
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:35,730
Hey!

589
01:06:35,763 --> 01:06:37,097
You okay?

590
01:06:40,267 --> 01:06:41,736
Obviously, she's not okay.

591
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:44,238
Hey, Candy?

592
01:06:44,271 --> 01:06:45,673
Shit.

593
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:12,499
Everything and everyone
is alive

594
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:14,769
and they want me
to help them.

595
01:07:22,577 --> 01:07:25,680
We need another 300K
for this next phase.

596
01:07:25,713 --> 01:07:27,314
And transportation.

597
01:07:27,347 --> 01:07:28,482
Next week, they say.

598
01:07:28,516 --> 01:07:30,083
We don't have
until next week!

599
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:31,686
Fucker!

600
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:33,453
Fucking stop it!

601
01:07:35,322 --> 01:07:36,524
We'll be in business
before this evening,

602
01:07:36,558 --> 01:07:38,593
just up your game.

603
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,533
Why don't you love me?

604
01:07:47,602 --> 01:07:48,670
I picked you up
when you were in

605
01:07:48,703 --> 01:07:50,337
a ridiculous punk band
going nowhere.

606
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:54,107
I just wish
Charlotte was dead.

607
01:07:56,578 --> 01:08:00,815
Don't you ever say that again.

608
01:08:00,848 --> 01:08:02,750
She's supportive of you?

609
01:08:02,784 --> 01:08:04,418
Your loyal one?

610
01:08:04,451 --> 01:08:05,887
Without us,
she would die.

611
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,891
Charlotte also
designed this program.

612
01:08:09,924 --> 01:08:12,192
Now, somehow,
she's deviated, regressed,

613
01:08:12,225 --> 01:08:13,595
but she was top in her class
at MIT

614
01:08:13,628 --> 01:08:14,696
in theoretical physics

615
01:08:14,729 --> 01:08:16,564
before I got her a real job.

616
01:08:16,598 --> 01:08:19,232
Now, her theories
never really panned out,

617
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:20,334
she doesn't have
any bragging rights,

618
01:08:20,367 --> 01:08:23,871
but do not fuck with her.

619
01:08:23,905 --> 01:08:25,339
She's very vindictive.

620
01:08:25,372 --> 01:08:29,142
Yeah. No, she's a masochist
and a murderer.

621
01:08:29,176 --> 01:08:30,511
She produces nothing.

622
01:08:30,545 --> 01:08:32,479
She helps nothing.

623
01:08:32,513 --> 01:08:33,748
And she will eventually
kill us.

624
01:08:33,781 --> 01:08:34,749
And if you can't see that,

625
01:08:34,782 --> 01:08:36,884
then you're not
a good judge of character.

626
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:40,387
There are worse things.

627
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:22,597
Better than that big lion
upstairs, hey?

628
01:09:27,001 --> 01:09:31,973
What happened to us, huh?

629
01:09:32,006 --> 01:09:35,208
with us?

630
01:09:35,242 --> 01:09:36,544
We were gonna
travel the world

631
01:09:36,577 --> 01:09:39,446
and live a good life.

632
01:09:41,015 --> 01:09:45,720
You just witnessed a tiny
measure of what I can do.

633
01:09:45,753 --> 01:09:46,921
Did you see that?

634
01:09:49,991 --> 01:09:52,426
Did you see that?

635
01:09:54,862 --> 01:09:56,698
Simple question, bubblehead.

636
01:10:01,803 --> 01:10:04,872
Now, I told you.

637
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:08,442
I don't like highlights, right?

638
01:10:08,475 --> 01:10:10,377
You knew this.

639
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:11,612
You failed to fix it.

640
01:10:11,646 --> 01:10:12,947
I want Lorian fully bleached.

641
01:10:15,415 --> 01:10:16,450
You know what our client wants,

642
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:19,020
so why are you trying
to destroy this operation?

643
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:23,591
That shit is killing you.

644
01:10:23,624 --> 01:10:25,560
This is the future, you idiot!

645
01:10:27,562 --> 01:10:29,997
I'm the way forward, me,
they chose me!

646
01:10:30,031 --> 01:10:34,001
Always up front,
not you want-to-bes, hm?

647
01:10:36,436 --> 01:10:40,007
We have a dream team here.

648
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,943
Charlotte will soon
see the light,

649
01:10:41,976 --> 01:10:43,044
and we'll make
so much money,

650
01:10:43,077 --> 01:10:45,546
it'll blow your
tiny fucking mind.

651
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,715
Here.
Have your subhuman shit!

652
01:10:47,749 --> 01:10:51,284
Knock yourself out!

653
01:10:51,318 --> 01:10:53,888
And some of us
are true pioneers.

654
01:10:57,091 --> 01:11:00,460
And fix Lorian's foot.

655
01:11:00,494 --> 01:11:02,897
I'm sick of your feeble attempts
at control.

656
01:11:16,511 --> 01:11:19,446
He doesn't see in you
what I see.

657
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:28,488
Sit with me?

658
01:11:33,594 --> 01:11:36,798
Ah, shit!

659
01:11:36,831 --> 01:11:38,833
I thought you were
completely changed.

660
01:11:38,866 --> 01:11:41,536
I don't know
who the fuck you are anymore.

661
01:11:41,569 --> 01:11:43,971
I should just
fucking kill you.

662
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:50,578
Lorian?

663
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:53,548
Sofia?

664
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:55,716
What the...

665
01:12:00,521 --> 01:12:02,557
Who the fuck
talking to?

666
01:12:09,429 --> 01:12:12,133
They just decided to kill you.

667
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:13,801
Why are you helping me?

668
01:12:13,835 --> 01:12:15,468
I am cooperating
with the enemy

669
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:17,638
because sometimes
you have to,

670
01:12:17,672 --> 01:12:19,472
to survive.

671
01:12:19,507 --> 01:12:21,509
You'll understand one day.

672
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:22,510
Don't worry, Lorian.

673
01:12:22,543 --> 01:12:24,712
I'll finish the work.

674
01:12:28,481 --> 01:12:32,687
I am a lion.

675
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,890
You are whatever
we want you to be.

676
01:13:30,578 --> 01:13:33,080
Touché, bitch.

677
01:13:47,662 --> 01:13:49,664
We are everywhere.

678
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:52,199
There is no escape.

679
01:13:56,604 --> 01:13:59,640
Never listen to the dead.

680
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,888
Even if I get out
of this place,

681
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:23,624
I'm not going back.

682
01:15:23,657 --> 01:15:26,694
They made me then, too.

683
01:15:26,727 --> 01:15:30,698
They cloned me
from a clone of a clone.

684
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:33,868
Shh!

685
01:15:36,337 --> 01:15:39,807
The world is a simulation.

686
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:43,010
There is no other explanation.

687
01:15:43,044 --> 01:15:45,679
I was chosen,

688
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:48,582
but I am not one of them.

689
01:15:48,616 --> 01:15:50,918
I know.

690
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:52,586
I know everything now.

691
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:33,327
Congratulations.

692
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,930
You're my finest creation.

693
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,735
Now she will do anything
and everything we ask

694
01:16:41,769 --> 01:16:44,371
in a far superior manner
to the average Sofia.

695
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:49,143
Because she's free.

696
01:17:25,779 --> 01:17:28,449
I'm no longer subject to
the whims of.

697
01:17:41,795 --> 01:17:46,033
I've gained no credit
for what I've achieved!

698
01:17:46,066 --> 01:17:47,801
This little monument

699
01:17:47,835 --> 01:17:50,037
is for the infantile.

700
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:53,073
The challenged,
the mentally impaired!

701
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,757
They can't stop
what has been set in motion.

702
01:18:43,791 --> 01:18:45,527
Motion is a change of position
between objects

703
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:49,463
within a given
interval of time.

704
01:18:49,496 --> 01:18:53,934
But without time, T,

705
01:18:53,968 --> 01:18:55,936
motion is unnecessary.

706
01:18:58,872 --> 01:19:01,041
I'm everywhere

707
01:19:01,075 --> 01:19:03,911
by simultaneously
,

708
01:19:03,944 --> 01:19:06,080
you miserable bastard.

709
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:19,093
I don't know where he is.

710
01:19:19,126 --> 01:19:20,094
Just listen.

711
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:21,829
They're pulling the operation.

712
01:19:21,862 --> 01:19:22,963
Don't ask me why.

713
01:19:22,997 --> 01:19:24,198
Oh, fuck!

714
01:19:24,231 --> 01:19:25,899
You have to kill Lorian.

715
01:19:25,933 --> 01:19:28,135
I'll deal with Heinrich.

716
01:19:28,168 --> 01:19:29,937
Those motherfuckers.

717
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:30,971
They used him.

718
01:19:31,005 --> 01:19:32,172
They used us.

719
01:19:32,206 --> 01:19:34,908
Some kind of half-assed
experiment.

720
01:19:34,942 --> 01:19:36,243
Of course.

721
01:19:36,277 --> 01:19:39,980
They drew the data
from the Sofias,

722
01:19:40,014 --> 01:19:41,215
and then mapped
the progression

723
01:19:41,248 --> 01:19:43,183
and probably planted Lorian
as a marker.

724
01:19:43,217 --> 01:19:44,018
And then, of course,

725
01:19:44,051 --> 01:19:45,886
all the data from
the Aqua Velva,

726
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:49,023
which is the real reason
for this whole thing.

727
01:19:49,056 --> 01:19:50,592
Fuck. I hate those bastards.

728
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:52,026
Well, we're pulling out.

729
01:19:52,059 --> 01:19:53,193
You kill Lorian,

730
01:19:53,227 --> 01:19:54,828
I'll get back to you.

731
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:20,054
You have to let her go.

732
01:20:22,189 --> 01:20:23,857
You know that
it's a balance,

733
01:20:23,891 --> 01:20:26,994
and sometimes,
you have to give one back

734
01:20:27,027 --> 01:20:29,430
in order to survive.

735
01:20:29,463 --> 01:20:31,398
She is the key.

736
01:20:31,432 --> 01:20:33,167
No.

737
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:36,470
You just chose
the wrong girl.

738
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:38,573
They've known ever since
they dropped her off.

739
01:20:38,606 --> 01:20:42,443
We have been under
their microscope ever since.

740
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:44,612
Lies!

741
01:20:44,646 --> 01:20:46,246
They want me to succeed.

742
01:20:59,561 --> 01:21:01,629
This can be
a total success.

743
01:21:01,663 --> 01:21:04,064
She's already broken through.

744
01:21:04,098 --> 01:21:06,634
It's over.

745
01:21:06,668 --> 01:21:08,135
Let her go.

746
01:21:38,633 --> 01:21:41,168
There's something
you need to understand.

747
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,376
If you think
I'm inferior to you

748
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:50,944
because of that...

749
01:21:58,318 --> 01:22:00,087
Love me.

750
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:06,628
I see.

751
01:22:09,029 --> 01:22:10,565
Is it okay?

752
01:22:35,189 --> 01:22:37,191
Gonna fuck you up, bitch!

753
01:22:44,431 --> 01:22:47,301
Lorian will destroy you.

754
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,590
Lorian!

755
01:23:08,623 --> 01:23:12,727
This is your quantum moment.

756
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,329
Charlotte doesn't believe
that I can transmute reality,

757
01:23:15,362 --> 01:23:17,699
but I just did!

758
01:23:23,638 --> 01:23:27,374
And you can feel it.

759
01:23:27,407 --> 01:23:28,710
Pulling you.

760
01:24:09,851 --> 01:24:12,119
Do you understand now?

761
01:24:12,152 --> 01:24:13,521
There are two worlds.

762
01:24:33,206 --> 01:24:35,543
I'm sure Maddox
has her already.

763
01:25:03,236 --> 01:25:05,907
There you are,
you little bitch.

764
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,875
Gonna get some!

765
01:26:46,741 --> 01:26:49,342
Goddamn!

766
01:26:49,376 --> 01:26:50,912
Bitch!

767
01:28:55,502 --> 01:28:57,004
You need a doctor.

768
01:28:59,874 --> 01:29:02,109
Maddox hasn't called yet.

769
01:29:02,143 --> 01:29:03,845
I can't reach him.

770
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,387
What's wrong with
having a little fun?

771
01:29:14,421 --> 01:29:17,091
You need to go
to the hospital.

772
01:29:17,124 --> 01:29:18,993
Just stitch me up,
s'il vous plaît.

773
01:29:44,185 --> 01:29:45,586
Does it hurt?

774
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,189
I feel nothing.

775
01:29:48,222 --> 01:29:50,625
I just want to fuck.

776
01:29:50,658 --> 01:29:52,593
Actually,
I just want to think.

777
01:29:55,062 --> 01:29:56,797
I just want to breathe,

778
01:29:56,831 --> 01:29:58,065
I just want to be.

779
01:30:00,801 --> 01:30:02,837
But there is a proviso.

780
01:30:06,007 --> 01:30:08,743
Not in a line,

781
01:30:08,776 --> 01:30:09,610
not in a series.

782
01:30:09,644 --> 01:30:12,513
I'm so tired
of a series of things.

783
01:30:15,482 --> 01:30:17,151
Do you realize
that's all your fault, Misha?

784
01:30:17,184 --> 01:30:18,819
You always think in a series
about everything,

785
01:30:18,853 --> 01:30:20,487
and you forced
everyone else around you

786
01:30:20,521 --> 01:30:22,723
to think in the same way.

787
01:30:22,757 --> 01:30:24,992
Yeah, well,
somebody needs to figure out

788
01:30:25,026 --> 01:30:28,963
the next fucking step,
and it's obviously not you.

789
01:30:28,996 --> 01:30:31,599
- Well, there you go again.
- You need me.

790
01:30:42,276 --> 01:30:43,945
I need...

791
01:30:47,281 --> 01:30:48,816
...a sign.

792
01:30:51,719 --> 01:30:54,121
It's Maddox.

793
01:30:57,158 --> 01:31:01,095
Shit!

794
01:31:01,128 --> 01:31:02,530
Let's go.

795
01:32:01,789 --> 01:32:05,159
You think you can take me?

796
01:32:05,192 --> 01:32:07,328
So far, you've done nothing!

797
01:32:07,361 --> 01:32:10,064
You silly lion!

798
01:32:11,766 --> 01:32:15,803
There's a whole world
you know nothing about!

799
01:33:34,014 --> 01:33:36,016
I am the future.

800
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:40,087
It's just the beginning.

801
01:33:45,759 --> 01:33:50,197
I am so sorry, dear brother.

802
01:33:57,705 --> 01:33:59,206
Oh.

803
01:34:09,049 --> 01:34:10,885
He was really your brother?

804
01:34:14,488 --> 01:34:18,692
I thought that was a game.

805
01:34:37,044 --> 01:34:38,946
I can't breathe.

806
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,482
You broke him,

807
01:34:41,516 --> 01:34:43,150
and I knew you would.

808
01:34:43,184 --> 01:34:44,718
That is why
I wanted you to leave.

809
01:34:44,752 --> 01:34:47,955
My brother was a master
of this world.

810
01:34:50,525 --> 01:34:52,193
You coulda fooled me.

811
01:34:52,226 --> 01:34:54,828
You are not one of us,

812
01:34:54,862 --> 01:34:57,331
so I tried to give you back,

813
01:34:57,364 --> 01:35:00,401
as a gesture of goodwill

814
01:35:00,434 --> 01:35:02,903
to allow us to continue
unabated.

815
01:35:06,006 --> 01:35:11,245
So you're the real mastermind
behind this wonderful

816
01:35:11,278 --> 01:35:13,447
humanitarian service.

817
01:35:16,283 --> 01:35:19,753
You fooled everyone.

818
01:35:19,787 --> 01:35:24,124
Even your pathetic brother
and his abuse-victim wife.

819
01:35:24,158 --> 01:35:26,360
I wanted you to kill Misha.

820
01:35:26,393 --> 01:35:29,830
She was never good for him,
bad blood.

821
01:35:29,863 --> 01:35:32,066
But you couldn't even do that.

822
01:35:32,099 --> 01:35:35,537
So you had your chances.

823
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:39,240
It was all in plain sight,
Lorian.

824
01:35:39,273 --> 01:35:41,809
You just couldn't see it.

825
01:35:43,444 --> 01:35:45,179
They're all dead now.

826
01:35:48,983 --> 01:35:50,351
As are you.

827
01:35:55,289 --> 01:35:56,890
Now.

828
01:35:56,924 --> 01:36:01,996
We have to go very slowly here,
Lorian.

829
01:36:16,511 --> 01:36:17,478
That's good.

830
01:36:17,512 --> 01:36:19,213
My. Who taught you that? Me!

831
01:36:19,246 --> 01:36:20,948
You're just not
good enough though.

832
01:36:44,071 --> 01:36:45,039
Bitch!

833
01:37:35,557 --> 01:37:39,293
You should have read
your own book.

834
01:37:42,429 --> 01:37:44,264
I know it by heart.

835
01:40:55,355 --> 01:40:57,625
On target.

836
01:41:00,895 --> 01:41:02,730
Hi.

837
01:41:02,764 --> 01:41:03,831
Lorian West here,

838
01:41:03,865 --> 01:41:05,733
of Lionheart
Self Defense School.

839
01:41:05,767 --> 01:41:07,835
Women are prey
for traffickers today

840
01:41:07,869 --> 01:41:10,437
and need to know
how to defend themselves.

841
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:11,706
The truth is,

842
01:41:11,739 --> 01:41:14,408
the kidnapping
and the sex trafficking

843
01:41:14,441 --> 01:41:17,477
of young to middle-aged women
is a real danger,

844
01:41:17,512 --> 01:41:20,548
even in upscale malls
and supermarket parking lots.

845
01:41:20,582 --> 01:41:23,585
I teach you
how to defeat any attacker.

846
01:41:23,618 --> 01:41:24,786
You know what I mean.

847
01:41:24,819 --> 01:41:26,320
Get some help.

848
01:41:26,353 --> 01:41:28,455
Call me before it's too late.

849
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:37,599
Even if I get out of this place,
I'm not going back.

850
01:41:37,632 --> 01:41:40,702
They made me then too.

851
01:41:40,735 --> 01:41:44,404
They cloned me
from a clone of a clone

852
01:41:44,438 --> 01:41:46,574
of a clone of a clone.

853
01:41:46,608 --> 01:41:48,141
The world is a simulation.

854
01:41:49,877 --> 01:41:53,180
There is no other explanation.

855
01:41:53,213 --> 01:41:55,516
I was chosen.

856
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:58,553
But I am not one of them.

857
01:41:58,586 --> 01:41:59,754
I know.

858
01:41:59,787 --> 01:42:01,221
I know everything now.

859
01:42:01,254 --> 01:42:02,489
I know everything now...

860
01:42:02,523 --> 01:42:03,891
I know everything now.

861
01:42:31,719 --> 01:42:33,955
You have eaten from the tree.

862
01:42:33,988 --> 01:42:35,957
Now you will be as we.
