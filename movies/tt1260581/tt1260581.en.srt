The Best UK, India and US IPTV channels

2
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,432
What sort of man do you think
is committing these murders?

3
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,684
He's a cool, intelligent,
cunning individual.

4
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,436
As having a deep hatred of prostitutes.

5
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,770
Hates prostitutes.

6
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,231
The killer they call the Yorkshire Ripper.

7
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,735
Brutal murder,
wasn't it?

8
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:45,112
Oh, yes, it was,
very brutal murder.

9
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,573
She's had very severe head injuries,
other injuries,

10
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:49,742
which I don't wish to
elaborate on at this time.

11
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,452
She has teeth marks left on her body

12
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,913
that gave police the
valuable information...

13
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,831
In the past four years,

14
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:59,001
12 women have died
in the very same way.

15
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:01,045
I'd like to say that I curse him

16
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:02,963
and that I hope he goes
rotten from head to foot

17
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,466
if the police don't get him first.

18
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,760
You daren't let your kids
go out in the street.

19
00:02:07,886 --> 00:02:09,887
Frightened to go over to the shops now

20
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,597
or anywhere near the Chapeltown area.

21
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:13,682
It's very frightening.

22
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,937
We have 5,000 officers in this force,

23
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:19,730
and I intend that all those officers

24
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:20,981
on every day of their duty

25
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,484
will be contributing to this inquiry.

26
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,319
This man has to be caught.

27
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:30,866
The police services are
stretched to their utmost

28
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:32,326
on the investigation.

29
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,911
I've got to admit to the public

30
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:36,664
that we've not been
successful up to now.

31
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,916
Hundreds of people are now
writing in with information.

32
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,001
Mail is arriving by the sackful.

33
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,295
Over 3,000 statements have been taken,

34
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:47,299
and 9,000 men have already
been eliminated from our inquiry.

35
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:50,344
We have received letters that
we believe to be genuine,

36
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,179
and we are presently analyzing a tape

37
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,515
that we also believe
comes from someone

38
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,225
we would very much like to talk to

39
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:58,852
in connection with this inquiry.

40
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,354
I'm Jack.

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,315
I see you are still having
no luck catching me.

42
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:05,442
I have the greatest respect for you,

43
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:10,948
but, Lord,
you are no nearer catching me now

44
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:13,534
than four years ago when I started.

45
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,868
I reckon...

46
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,620
And anyone who missed
the tape recording

47
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:20,874
can now put a phone call
in to to Leeds 469111.

48
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,711
Every time the phone rings,

49
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,504
I wonder if it's you.

50
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,008
If I get up in the middle of the night,

51
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:32,011
I can't help thinking about it,

52
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:35,472
and I feel that I really know you.

53
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,393
But I don't regard you as evil.

54
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:42,521
They never learn,
do they, George?

55
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:45,566
I bet you've warned them,
but they never listen.

56
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:50,029
Your voice is almost sad.

57
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:54,408
To me,
you're like a bad angel

58
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:58,579
on a mistaken journey.

59
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,916
And while I would never
condone your methods,

60
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:06,003
I can sympathize with your feelings.

61
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:09,256
The inevitable speculation
that Laura Baines

62
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,634
may be the 13th victim
of the Yorkshire Ripper.

63
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:14,470
We hope and pray

64
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:18,182
there may be no more
funerals like this one.

65
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,120
"And while I could never
condone his methods,

66
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,123
â€œI can sympathize with his feelings,"

67
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,292
Assistant Chief Constable Bill Molloy

68
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,544
on national news last night.

69
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,421
Christ.

70
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:50,547
He's lost it.

71
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,884
Badger Bill is retiring.

72
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,052
Philip?

73
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:56,720
I've asked Peter Hunter to join us.

74
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,514
I think he's our man.

75
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,184
He's assistant chief constable of
the Greater Manchester force.

76
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,937
Married, no children.

77
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:08,023
A good man,
a steady man.

78
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:11,151
Squeaky-clean.

79
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,736
They're ready for you now,
Mr. Hunter,

80
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:13,946
if you'd care to come this way.

81
00:05:14,072 --> 00:05:15,697
Thank you.

82
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,080
Mr. Hunter, gentlemen.

83
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:24,915
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Hunter.

84
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,208
Philip Evans,

85
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,544
regional inspector of
constabulary for Yorkshire.

86
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,547
Sir John Marsden,
chief inspector of constabulary.

87
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:34,174
Michael Warren from the Home Office.

88
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:39,054
As I said on the phone,
there's been another:

89
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,472
Laura Baines.

90
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:43,142
Student nurse,
20 years old.

91
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:44,351
Leeds again.

92
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,436
It's a farce.

93
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:49,523
Now, you saw Bill Molloy
on the box last night.

94
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,275
What do you make of him?

95
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:52,860
I think he's under a lot of pressure.

96
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,112
It's become a personal vendetta.

97
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:56,613
Can't have that.

98
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:59,575
There'll be a press conference tomorrow.

99
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:03,036
Harold Angus will tell
them Bill Molloy's out.

100
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:06,665
And there have been
calls for outside help,

101
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,126
a fresh perspective and so on.

102
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:11,962
Which is why we've
asked you here today.

103
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,798
We want you to head up a
covert Home Office inquiry

104
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:17,301
into the Ripper investigation.

105
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:19,052
Why covert?

106
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,220
Don't want to go

107
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,557
washing our dirty linen in public,
do we?

108
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,392
As far as West Yorkshire is concerned,

109
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,978
your squad will be there
in an advisory capacity.

110
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:31,899
Mr. Hunter,
this goes right to the top.

111
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,109
The home secretary is
taking a personal interest.

112
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:35,736
I'm quite sure he is, sir.

113
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,237
You'll handpick your own officers,

114
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,406
be based in Leeds,

115
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,366
and be answerable only to myself.

116
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:45,329
Ah, and the Home Office,
of course.

117
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,582
Ask.

118
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,917
Ask what, sir?

119
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,251
Why you?

120
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,420
That's what you want to know,
isn't it?

121
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,214
Okay, sir.
Why me?

122
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,051
You've previously been
involved in investigations

123
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:01,136
into the West Yorkshire force,
haven't you?

124
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:04,264
The Karachi Club shooting,
for one.

125
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,351
With all due respect, sir,
that was over five years ago.

126
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,102
I failed to reach a conclusion.

127
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,939
Why was that?

128
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,859
I couldn't continue my
inquiry for personal reasons.

129
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:18,070
These investigations,
they make you popular

130
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:21,240
with the West Yorkshire lads,
did they?

131
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:22,449
No, sir.

132
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,159
What is it they call you?

133
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:27,663
"Saint Cunt,"
isn't it?

134
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:29,831
Bother you, that?

135
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,668
No, sir,
it doesn't.

136
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:34,795
Then there's your answer.

137
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:53,939
DCS John Nolan,

138
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:58,277
20 years' experience,
done two tours with me.

139
00:07:58,403 --> 00:07:59,945
Good man.

140
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:01,697
And Detective Helen Marshall.

141
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:03,782
Helen Marshall?

142
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:04,950
Yes, sir.

143
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:06,535
These are the best we have.

144
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:09,955
I'd like them both,
if that's okay with you, sir.

145
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:12,791
I've been instructed to give
you whatever you need.

146
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:14,126
Thank you.

147
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:17,546
You made your mind up pretty quickly

148
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:18,588
about doing the job.

149
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,091
Not something I felt I could refuse.

150
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:22,759
You could have, Pete.

151
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,262
I would have.

152
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,472
It's a job that needs to be done.

153
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:29,975
It's an honor for the Manchester force.

154
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,978
Let's hope so, Peter.

155
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,482
We're working 24 hours a day,
seven days a week,

156
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:38,650
with limited time off.

157
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:41,653
So if you cannot commit,
please say so now.

158
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:42,946
I'm in.

159
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,740
Thanks, John.

160
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:47,367
I'll have to get someone to feed the cat,
I suppose.

161
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,036
Thank you.

162
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,788
John, me and you will
head over first thing.

163
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:55,042
Helen, we'll meet you in Leeds
Tuesday morning, 9:00 sharp.

164
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,877
Do they know we're coming?

165
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,920
Brass, yeah,
but not the lads or the press.

166
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:01,381
We're gonna keep it low-key.

167
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,841
Thank you.

168
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:05,677
Go and clear my desk, then, eh?

169
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:08,638
See you later, boss.

170
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,974
Thanks, John.

171
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,019
Thank you.

172
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:16,146
For what?

173
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:18,607
Asking for me.

174
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,151
No competition.

175
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,874
The Yorkshire Ripper has
claimed his 13th victim

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,334
as the West Yorkshire police

177
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,336
confirmed that the killing of Laura Baines

178
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:42,172
bore all the hallmarks of
Britain's most wanted man.

179
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:45,342
- Bloody Yorkshire.
- Yeah.

180
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:47,177
Republican prisoners in the Maze prison

181
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:48,720
have again embarked on a hunger strike

182
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:50,722
after the home secretary refused to...

183
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:52,641
Ladies and gentlemen,

184
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:54,643
last night,
an emergency meeting

185
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,812
of the West Yorkshire Police
Committee was called

186
00:09:56,938 --> 00:10:00,482
in the light of the
confirmation of Laura Baines

187
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:04,569
as the 13th victim of
the Yorkshire Ripper.

188
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:06,279
I would like to announce

189
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,449
a number of internal
operational changes.

190
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,951
How about your resignation?

191
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,953
Resign!

192
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,287
As of today,

193
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,624
Detective Chief
Superintendent Maurice Jobson

194
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,710
will have sole responsibility
for the hunt for this man.

195
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,379
Would you care to
comment on allegations

196
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:23,964
that valuable time has already been lost

197
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,298
on this investigation?

198
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,634
Was Laura Baines not reported
missing as early as 10:30?

199
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,219
I'm not taking questions
on this at this point.

200
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:31,138
Would you comment on
rumors that she bled to death

201
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,472
while officers failed to respond

202
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,433
to the repeated calls from her flatmates?

203
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,976
How do you respond to suggestions

204
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,311
that the so-called Yorkshire
Ripper tape is a hoax?

205
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,160
Bunch of fucking bastards!

206
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,327
Bloody shambles.

207
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,246
Like a fly to shit,
you are, Hunter.

208
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:57,247
Steady, Bill.

209
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:58,248
Can I have a word?

210
00:10:58,374 --> 00:10:59,666
And you can fuck off and all,

211
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,419
Detective Chief Superintendent.

212
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,421
Don't take it personally, Maurice.

213
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:05,797
He's had a shock.

214
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:07,549
You didn't tell him he was going?

215
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:09,718
I've arranged a nice
dinner for this evening.

216
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:10,969
We'll talk things over then.

217
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:12,012
Nice place.
Good steaks.

218
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,013
Just us.

219
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,097
I'm with John Nolan.

220
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:15,182
Oh, don't worry about John.

221
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,766
Dickie Alderman and a couple of the lads

222
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:19,269
will take care of him.

223
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:21,062
Harold Angus of West Yorkshire

224
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:23,690
announced that a brains
trust of senior detectives

225
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,983
are being drafted in to assist

226
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:26,651
in the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper.

227
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:28,028
This super squad will be led...

228
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,655
Don't waste any time,
do they?

229
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:33,033
Sorry there's no red carpet.

230
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,534
Didn't expect one.

231
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,536
That's lucky, then,
isn't it?

232
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,122
Who was shot to death
outside his home...

233
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:41,208
You keep going back for more

234
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,460
until they have to roll you out.

235
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,170
Are you sure?

236
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:46,838
No, thanks.

237
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:48,507
Not on hunger strike,
are you?

238
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:49,549
How do you mean?

239
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,219
Well, in sympathy, like.
The Maze.

240
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,887
You're Roman,
aren't you?

241
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,305
I'm not religious.

242
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:56,890
I heard you were.

243
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,767
No offense.

244
00:11:58,893 --> 00:12:01,686
You do know why I was
brought in by the Home Office?

245
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:04,189
I know everything, Hunter.

246
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:05,815
So you understand that to do the job,

247
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:07,567
I need unhindered access.

248
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:08,693
I wouldn't want to limit

249
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:11,780
the scope of your
investigation in any way.

250
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:13,114
I'm gonna need to copy all files

251
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:14,824
pertaining to the Ripper inquiry.

252
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,618
You know how many
files there are, Pete?

253
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:19,704
We had to reinforce the
floor to support them.

254
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,789
Another drink?

255
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:22,457
No.

256
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:26,044
Those files won't mean
fuck-all without a guide.

257
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,796
Well, if you could supply us with a liaison,

258
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:29,506
that would be a great help.

259
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:33,677
How's your wife these days, Hunter?

260
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,679
She's fine.

261
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,097
I heard she hadn't been too good.

262
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,348
That's all.

263
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,225
Don't mean to pry.

264
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:41,393
No, she's fine,
thank you.

265
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,562
I heard the casino's worth a visit.

266
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,398
That's me, gentlemen.
I've had a long day.

267
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:48,066
I think I'm gonna go back to the hotel.

268
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:49,234
You're the guest.

269
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,695
Maurice?
Memorandum.

270
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:58,577
It's, um,
terms of reference for your investigation.

271
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,164
"Terms of reference"?

272
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,457
What do you mean?

273
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,419
I don't like open-ended inquiries.

274
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,004
Joan?

275
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,507
Have I woke you up, darling?

276
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,218
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:57,345 --> 00:13:58,511
Go back to bed, darling.

278
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,388
I'll talk to you in the morning.

279
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:03,224
Yeah.

280
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:06,561
I miss you too.

281
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:08,688
All right, Joan.
Night-night, love.

282
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,899
Bye, baby.
Bye. Bye.

283
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:25,830
Mr. Hunter!

284
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:27,207
Jack Whitehead,
the Evening Post.

285
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,917
Police are still appealing for witnesses

286
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:31,336
to a robbery and shoot-out at
the Karachi Club in Wakefield

287
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:32,671
which claimed seven lives.

288
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:34,506
Can I have a word about the shooting,
the lads?

289
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:35,548
Two police officers

290
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,883
were seriously injured in the incident.

291
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,551
PC Tommy Douglas was
shot in the shoulder,

292
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,054
and Sergeant Bob Craven
suffered serious head injuries

293
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,347
in the attack.

294
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,560
Kill the fucking...
Kill them all.

295
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,270
It's like the papers say.

296
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:52,315
Sergeant Craven and PC
Douglas are on the mend,

297
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:56,403
but they're not up to
questioning just yet.

298
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,904
Kill them all.

299
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,030
Kill them all.

300
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:04,619
Our thoughts go out to the families

301
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:07,956
of PC Tommy Douglas and
Sergeant Bob Craven.

302
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:10,583
An outside force will be
reviewing the actions

303
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,085
of the West Yorkshire Police.

304
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,380
And we, of course,
welcome their inquiry.

305
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:16,881
Just as they're about to knock off,

306
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:18,466
Craven and Douglas get the call.

307
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:21,803
Call was logged at
1:28 a.m., anonymous.

308
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,099
Why does it smell so bad?

309
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,726
What about the barmaid?

310
00:15:27,852 --> 00:15:29,060
Looking for her.

311
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:30,186
Got a name?

312
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:32,021
Not yet.

313
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:36,025
Two shotguns,
one Smith & Wesson,

314
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:39,112
and two MP5s.

315
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,449
Craven reckoned a four-man team.

316
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,243
Well, we've got five guns.

317
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,122
I still can't get this clear.
Can you?

318
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,374
I just can't see it.

319
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,709
Something's wrong here.

320
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:29,579
Big night?

321
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:30,789
Building bridges,
you know.

322
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:31,790
You?

323
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,374
Couple of pints with Dickie Alderman,

324
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:34,876
a few of the lads,
friendly enough.

325
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:36,169
Learn anything?

326
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,712
Yeah, morale's low.

327
00:16:37,838 --> 00:16:39,547
Bill's going was the last straw.

328
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:41,257
Our presence doesn't help.

329
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,140
There's no phone line.
They're working on it.

330
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:50,433
Christ.

331
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,811
Keys are on the way, apparently.

332
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:54,354
Can't be too careful, now,
can you?

333
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,650
Detective Superintendent Bob Craven.

334
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,276
Sergeant back then,
wasn't it?

335
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:01,653
Aye.

336
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,780
You look in a better state
than the last time we met.

337
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,114
You don't.

338
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,969
Sorry I'm late.

339
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:34,519
Right.

340
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:35,854
I'm gonna be your liaison

341
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,692
along with Detective Inspector
Dickie Alderman here.

342
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:42,235
I've been involved since day one.

343
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,903
And we know the case
on a personal basis.

344
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,029
Yeah.

345
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:46,614
Probably forgotten more than most know.

346
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,116
That's a pity,
isn't it?

347
00:17:48,242 --> 00:17:51,119
You know what we mean,
Mr. Hunter.

348
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:53,121
Yeah.

349
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:54,914
Yeah.

350
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,605
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.

351
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:19,814
I'm going to give each one of you

352
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,149
a year or two of the investigation

353
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:23,234
and 24 hours to get
to grips with the files.

354
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,236
I want details of cars sighted,

355
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:27,989
descriptions of all witnesses,
suspects, whatever.

356
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:29,157
And this time round,

357
00:18:29,283 --> 00:18:31,826
I want them irrespective of blood type.

358
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:34,078
I want us to forget all
previous investigations,

359
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:36,122
and that includes the
Geordie accent on that tape.

360
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,917
Well, Bill Molloy was very,
very certain

361
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:40,793
that tape was genuine.

362
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,295
Well, Bill Molloy is off the case.

363
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,464
We're starting from scratch.

364
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,633
Right, John,

365
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:51,846
I want you to do 1974, '75,
and '76.

366
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:53,473
'76 was a very quiet one.

367
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,018
That's favoritism from the boss,
I reckon.

368
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:59,479
What do you reckon?

369
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:03,983
Helen, you get the short straw: '77.

370
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,860
Busy boy that Jubilee,
weren't he?

371
00:19:05,986 --> 00:19:06,986
Four in a row.

372
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,237
Why don't I do one of Helen's?

373
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:09,322
Here you are.

374
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,324
I'll do this one,
Clare Strachan.

375
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,284
No, no,
we'll keep it as it is.

376
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,577
You got a problem with that, Helen?

377
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:15,828
No, it's fine.

378
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,038
Okay.

379
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:20,667
I'll take '78, '79,
and Laura Baines.

380
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,043
Okay, listen.

381
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:24,170
The Yorkshire Ripper's
name is in those files.

382
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,171
Trust me.

383
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,464
We've had him in and let him go.

384
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,424
What makes you so sure of that?

385
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,801
Well, here's the problem, Bob.

386
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:31,970
You've been looking for some
hunchbacked lorry driver

387
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:34,013
with a Geordie accent and
flesh between his teeth

388
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,431
and a hammer in his back pocket.

389
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:37,767
Who do you think we
should be looking for, then?

390
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:38,810
Before this latest,

391
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:40,353
he was quiet for 15 months, right?

392
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,981
Makes you wonder what
he was doing all that time.

393
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:44,649
Exactly.

394
00:19:44,775 --> 00:19:46,985
What do you do in your spare time, Bob?

395
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:48,695
What?

396
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,863
What's your hobby?

397
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,117
I like chewing minge,
Mr. Hunter, why?

398
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:56,077
You don't get out as much
as you'd like to, right?

399
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:58,204
Obviously.

400
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,539
Why's that?

401
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,624
This job,
I suppose.

402
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,251
He's the same.

403
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:05,628
He's got the same bollocks
in his life as we've all got:

404
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:08,172
work, the wife, kids, holidays.

405
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:09,716
Oh, married with kids?

406
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,050
Oh, right, yeah.

407
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,886
Married.
No kids.

408
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,472
No one would cover up for him,
what he's done.

409
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:19,308
She doesn't think she's doing,

410
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,644
doesn't see him for what he really is,

411
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,730
but neither do we.

412
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,733
Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Hunter.

413
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,568
Your wife left a message.

414
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,777
She wants to know

415
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:32,447
if you're coming home for dinner tonight.

416
00:20:32,573 --> 00:20:34,741
Thank you.

417
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,580
You better hop to it,
Mr. Hunter, eh?

418
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,416
Don't want winter in the house, now,
do we?

419
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:55,261
God.

420
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,473
You couldn't get more
normal than Laura Baines.

421
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,808
He changed all that,
didn't he?

422
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:06,022
Laura gets off the bus at 9:29,
crosses the road.

423
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:08,733
He comes up behind her,
hits her on the head,

424
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:10,902
drags her over there.

425
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:15,531
She's got to be the last.

426
00:21:19,787 --> 00:21:22,163
You know people are gonna talk.

427
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:24,499
About what?

428
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,710
You punishing me with '77.

429
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:29,545
Bob Craven clocked it.

430
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:30,546
Yeah.

431
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:32,381
I don't like Mr. Craven.

432
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:34,342
He's a nob.

433
00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:36,427
According to the lads,
he hasn't been right in the head

434
00:21:36,553 --> 00:21:37,762
since the Karachi Club shooting.

435
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:39,097
Yeah.

436
00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:43,434
I think they left some bits
out when they rebuilt him.

437
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,062
God, that was a mess.

438
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,984
So what's up?

439
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,153
How do you mean,
"what's up?"

440
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,656
You said you wanted to see me.

441
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,826
That was it.
I wanted to see you.

442
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:00,827
Helen.

443
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:01,994
No, look.

444
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,538
I'm just finding it a little difficult

445
00:22:03,664 --> 00:22:05,373
pretending nothing ever
happened between us.

446
00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:08,042
That's all.

447
00:22:08,168 --> 00:22:11,129
Well, it didn't really,
did it?

448
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:15,800
Well...

449
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:18,219
Well, it did from where I'm standing.

450
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,350
Look, I'm not going to cause a scene.

451
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,185
I'm not going to contact the wife.

452
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,436
- Helen.
- It was a joke.

453
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:29,605
Look.

454
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:33,776
I don't regret anything.
It's done.

455
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:36,404
Just don't pretend it didn't.

456
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:41,617
It was disloyal.

457
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:45,454
It was unprofessional.

458
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:49,208
And it was unforgivable.

459
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:52,044
And I do regret it.

460
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,176
Well, that's your problem,
isn't it?

461
00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,303
It still happened.

462
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:10,354
57 times,
he stabbed her.

463
00:23:18,906 --> 00:23:20,281
77, Mr. Hunter?

464
00:23:20,407 --> 00:23:21,949
Yes, please.

465
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:25,203
Thank you.

466
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,918
64, please.

467
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,630
Thank you.

468
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:03,407
Night, then.

469
00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:00,464
I wasn't expecting you home, love.

470
00:25:05,345 --> 00:25:08,723
What's this?
A Vietnamese baby?

471
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:12,518
Oh, not now.
Let's talk another time.

472
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:18,649
I thought I'd put the tree up.

473
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:19,817
Oh, we're a bit late.

474
00:25:19,943 --> 00:25:21,986
Everything's up in the attic.

475
00:25:22,112 --> 00:25:23,988
It's all right.

476
00:25:24,114 --> 00:25:25,489
I'll get the steps from the garage.

477
00:25:25,615 --> 00:25:27,825
Have it up in no time.

478
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:30,494
Those lights are so old.

479
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,801
Shots fired in the private
bar of the Karachi Club.

480
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:48,471
Sergeant Craven and
PC Douglas respond.

481
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:51,640
Down the stairs,
eight dead, smoke,

482
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:54,518
four blokes in hoods with shotguns.

483
00:25:54,644 --> 00:25:55,519
More shots.

484
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:57,355
Beaten.
Left for dead.

485
00:25:57,481 --> 00:25:59,857
Dougie still can't remember a thing.

486
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:01,317
Bob,

487
00:26:01,443 --> 00:26:03,903
well, he's in a bit of a state.

488
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,031
Craven and Douglas knew
shots had been fired,

489
00:26:07,157 --> 00:26:08,991
knew the SPG are on their way,

490
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:11,827
and still they go charging in there?

491
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:13,746
Strange.

492
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,916
Hero cops, remember?

493
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,542
It don't quite add up,
does it?

494
00:26:18,668 --> 00:26:21,045
It's your investigation, Hunter.

495
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:22,588
I want to talk to them.

496
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,882
And you will but not just yet.

497
00:26:27,511 --> 00:26:28,427
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

498
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,012
Telephone call for Mr. Hunter.

499
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:32,390
It's your wife, sir.
It's urgent.

500
00:26:39,189 --> 00:26:40,856
Joan?

501
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:48,864
Oh, okay.

502
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,533
I'll be right back, okay?

503
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,701
I'm leaving now.

504
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:57,373
I'm so sorry, love.
I'm so sorry.

505
00:26:57,499 --> 00:26:59,708
Joan, we can try again.

506
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:24,525
Been over to the other side, boss?

507
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:26,193
No Helen?

508
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,863
No, she's on the rag,
isn't she?

509
00:27:28,989 --> 00:27:34,368
Now, I do like gravy with my beef,
don't you?

510
00:27:34,494 --> 00:27:36,829
Oh, cheers for that, Bob.

511
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,164
Get started,
shall we?

512
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,833
Joan Richards,

513
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:44,336
found on February the 6th, 1976,
in an alleyway

514
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:47,006
on the Manor Street
Industrial Estate, Leeds.

515
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:48,716
Structure of the investigation?

516
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:51,093
Fish and chip job,
as it was then.

517
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:52,094
Yeah.

518
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,262
They still had

519
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:55,014
Chief Superintendent
Jobson on it, though.

520
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,068
You were on this one, right, Bob?

521
00:28:08,195 --> 00:28:09,737
Yeah, yeah,
I were.

522
00:28:09,863 --> 00:28:11,906
So why don't you talk us through it?

523
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,368
It would be a great help if you could.

524
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,538
She had boot prints on her legs,

525
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,041
you know, Wellingtons.

526
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:25,211
Pulled her bra up over her tits,

527
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:26,629
shoved a piece of wood up her fanny,

528
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:28,005
that kind of thing.

529
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,134
Who was running it?

530
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,344
The Owl were running it.

531
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,678
Jobson.

532
00:28:34,804 --> 00:28:37,014
And two other names that
are gonna keep coming up:

533
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,683
Detective Inspectors
Alderman and Prentice.

534
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:40,684
Good team?

535
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,687
Oh, yeah.
Good team.

536
00:28:43,813 --> 00:28:46,857
Some of the best men we've got.

537
00:28:46,983 --> 00:28:48,067
And then you came on board.

538
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,402
And then I came on board,
Mr. Hunter, yeah.

539
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,738
And?

540
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,407
And the pathologist linked it
with the other murders, right?

541
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:58,369
That's about it, yeah.

542
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:01,580
Thanks for that, Bob.

543
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:02,581
Yeah.

544
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,832
Take a break,
shall we?

545
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,423
Bob?

546
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,676
Can I have a word?

547
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:30,526
Been around all this a long time,
haven't you?

548
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:32,027
Ripper?

549
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:36,198
Mm, too bloody long.

550
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:38,033
In deep,
aren't you?

551
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,868
Eats me up, yeah.

552
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:41,704
Same for a lot of the lads.

553
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,205
That's not a crime,
is it?

554
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:46,208
No.

555
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:49,545
You must have your own theories.

556
00:29:49,671 --> 00:29:52,464
Oh, I do, yeah.

557
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,883
So why don't you share them?

558
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,387
With you?

559
00:29:58,513 --> 00:30:01,557
No, I don't think I will.

560
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:05,311
We'll catch our Ripper,
not you, Mr. Hunter.

561
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:08,981
You're taking your time about it,
aren't you?

562
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,733
Yeah, well,
it's not just about the Ripper,

563
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:11,734
is it,
Mr. Hunter?

564
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,902
Not for you.

565
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:15,738
And that's not why you're here,
is it?

566
00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:17,406
Not really.

567
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:20,242
What do you mean?

568
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:24,371
You know what I mean.

569
00:30:24,497 --> 00:30:25,539
It's about seeing

570
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:29,043
how many of us you can
take down with him.

571
00:30:30,754 --> 00:30:33,130
Why would I want to do that?

572
00:30:33,256 --> 00:30:36,258
Because it's in your nature,
isn't it?

573
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:42,765
No, like I said,

574
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:47,436
we will catch our Ripper,
Mr. Hunter,

575
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:49,188
not you.

576
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,151
Can I go now?

577
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:57,237
Yeah.

578
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:26,934
You okay?

579
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,270
Yeah, working late, '77.

580
00:31:30,397 --> 00:31:31,355
There's a lot to do.

581
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:34,858
Yeah.

582
00:31:34,984 --> 00:31:37,653
Can I come in?

583
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:40,489
Isnâ€™t convenient.

584
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:43,409
Right.

585
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:44,576
Right, I'll see you tomorrow.

586
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,412
Yeah, see you.

587
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,461
Mr. Hunter?

588
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:42,342
My name is Martin Laws.

589
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:44,344
Could I have a word?

590
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:46,847
What can I do for you,
Mr. Laws?

591
00:32:46,973 --> 00:32:48,515
I have a young man outside.

592
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:51,185
He's an unsettled lad,

593
00:32:51,311 --> 00:32:53,353
but he's desperate to speak to you.

594
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,521
About what?

595
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:57,524
A young woman called Clare Strachan.

596
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,693
It'll only take a minute.

597
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,850
You best get in round that door.

598
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,478
I'll wait out here.

599
00:33:43,363 --> 00:33:45,572
Lock the doors.

600
00:33:45,698 --> 00:33:46,740
It's okay.

601
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:49,785
What happened to you?

602
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:53,455
Occupational hazard,
Mr. Hunter.

603
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:55,165
What's your name, lad?

604
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,668
No names.

605
00:33:59,462 --> 00:34:01,505
Did you come alone?

606
00:34:01,631 --> 00:34:03,924
You on the run?

607
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,760
Oh, always.

608
00:34:08,555 --> 00:34:10,681
You knew Clare Strachan.

609
00:34:10,807 --> 00:34:13,016
Bit late,
Mr. Hunter.

610
00:34:13,142 --> 00:34:15,352
She's been dead three years.

611
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:18,355
Oh, I'm aware of that.

612
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:21,191
How did you know her?

613
00:34:21,317 --> 00:34:24,862
She were a friend,

614
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:26,989
sister, really.

615
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:35,664
She didn't deserve what happened to her.

616
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,166
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

617
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:41,503
Ask Eric the pimp if you
want to know more.

618
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:43,338
A pimp?

619
00:34:43,464 --> 00:34:46,341
I think you're wasting my time,
aren't you, son?

620
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:50,512
She had two little daughters,

621
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:52,556
and she were loved.

622
00:34:54,642 --> 00:34:57,519
I mean,
that's more than a lot of people, isn't it?

623
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:01,189
BJ.

624
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:04,526
They call me BJ.

625
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:06,403
Mr. Hunter?

626
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:22,419
Hope that wasn't a complete
waste of your time,

627
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:25,255
but BJ was very insistent.

628
00:35:25,381 --> 00:35:28,258
What exactlyis your line of work,
Mr. Laws?

629
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,718
Community work.

630
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:35,724
I work with the sick,
the lonely, dispossessed.

631
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,310
Oh, goodness,
I'm not under arrest, am I?

632
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,146
You don't like the police much,
do you?

633
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,482
No love lost, no.

634
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,484
So when someone kicks
down your front door,

635
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,985
kills the dog,
and rapes the wife,

636
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,445
who are you gonna call?

637
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:50,739
Well, it certainly wouldn't be
the West Yorkshire police.

638
00:35:50,865 --> 00:35:54,076
They'd already be in there,
wouldn't they?

639
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,538
I might want to talk to you again.

640
00:35:58,665 --> 00:36:00,290
I stay in Fitzwilliam.

641
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:03,627
It's a little mining village
not far from here.

642
00:36:03,753 --> 00:36:07,798
Wouldn't think it was
your type of place, really.

643
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:11,009
Take care,
Mr. Hunter.

644
00:36:20,103 --> 00:36:22,646
"Dear Bill,
I warned you and Jack from the Post,

645
00:36:22,772 --> 00:36:25,816
"there's a surprise waiting
for you in Preston.

646
00:36:25,942 --> 00:36:27,818
"Whores getting younger all the time.

647
00:36:27,944 --> 00:36:30,821
Yours respectfully,
Jack from Hell."

648
00:36:30,947 --> 00:36:32,030
This letter was received

649
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,824
at the offices of The Telegraph and Argus,

650
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,618
13th June, 1977.

651
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,246
Helen?

652
00:36:46,713 --> 00:36:50,590
1977 was a hell of a Jubilee.

653
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:53,760
The "surprise in Preston"
was Clare Strachan,

654
00:36:53,886 --> 00:36:57,264
convicted prostitute and
registered alcoholic.

655
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,224
Clare wasn't immediately
linked to the Ripper.

656
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,809
The type of injuries didn't correspond.

657
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:03,311
She was taken to some disused garages

658
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:06,982
on Frenchwood Street,
had sex,

659
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:09,484
and was then hit on the head
with a blunt instrument.

660
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:13,155
She was kicked in the
face, head, breasts,

661
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:14,406
legs, and body.

662
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,742
Her attacker jumped up
and down on her chest,

663
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:20,537
causing a rib to puncture
a lung and kill her.

664
00:37:20,663 --> 00:37:23,123
She had bite marks on her breasts

665
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:25,125
and had been penetrated
by a variety of objects,

666
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:29,171
twice sodomized,
once postmortem.

667
00:37:30,423 --> 00:37:33,633
Sergeant Bob Craven was
sent to Preston to investigate

668
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,804
but found no evidence to
connect Strachan to the others.

669
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,974
Correct, Superintendent?

670
00:37:42,935 --> 00:37:46,146
Thank you,
Mr. Craven.

671
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:48,690
Her pimp was Eric Hall,

672
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:51,359
Detective Inspector Eric Hall.

673
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:52,861
This force?

674
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:56,531
Eric Hall was murdered in
an unconnected incident.

675
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:58,617
But before that,
he was a suspect.

676
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:02,621
Yeah, but I think you'll find
that the tests later revealed

677
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:05,957
that the killer of Strachan
and the writer of that letter

678
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:10,128
were the same person,
weren't they?

679
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,588
Same blood type: B.

680
00:38:11,714 --> 00:38:13,590
I mean,
that's very rare.

681
00:38:13,716 --> 00:38:16,468
But initially you didn't
think it was the same man.

682
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,011
No, at the start,
the only links we had

683
00:38:18,137 --> 00:38:19,513
were that they were all slags.

684
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,223
Until the letter.

685
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:23,141
And the sample.

686
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,142
Then Strachan was in.

687
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:27,479
Yeah.

688
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,649
Ooh, that felt like I were in court, then.

689
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:31,983
Relax, Bob.

690
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,318
You're amongst friends.

691
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,986
Yeah, I know.

692
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,321
Do you want to add anything else?

693
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,823
No, thank you.

694
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,491
I'm not convinced.

695
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,159
You're not convinced...

696
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:49,000
The semen found in Strachan,

697
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:50,585
the saliva off the letter,

698
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:53,004
the blood group all match.

699
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,173
That's neat.

700
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,176
No, that's forensics, love.

701
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,469
The point is,

702
00:38:59,595 --> 00:39:01,138
either Strachan was killed by the Ripper,

703
00:39:01,264 --> 00:39:02,597
or she wasn't.

704
00:39:02,723 --> 00:39:04,391
And if she wasn't,
then that would mean

705
00:39:04,517 --> 00:39:07,561
we've got ourselves two Jacks,
not one.

706
00:39:07,687 --> 00:39:08,687
Love.

707
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:23,660
Sorry to disturb you.

708
00:39:23,786 --> 00:39:24,661
What's up?

709
00:39:24,787 --> 00:39:25,829
Can I come in?

710
00:39:25,955 --> 00:39:28,165
Yeah.

711
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:31,168
That was an excellent job you did today.

712
00:39:31,294 --> 00:39:33,044
Do you really think we're
looking for two Jacks?

713
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:35,547
Well, it's a possibility,
isn't it?

714
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,048
Do you want something to drink?

715
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,175
I've got tea or coffee.

716
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:39,634
No, someone's just contacted me

717
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,138
on behalf of Libby Hall,
Eric Hall's wife.

718
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:45,599
But it's you she really wants
to speak to, apparently.

719
00:39:45,725 --> 00:39:47,767
Aye?

720
00:39:47,894 --> 00:39:49,936
You know what happened to her?

721
00:39:50,062 --> 00:39:51,897
I know a bit, yeah.

722
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:02,699
Things they did to her,

723
00:40:02,825 --> 00:40:05,368
things they made her do.

724
00:40:05,494 --> 00:40:08,288
Dragged to the bathroom,
tried to drown her.

725
00:40:08,414 --> 00:40:10,707
Left her on the floor for her son to find.

726
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,755
She turned religious after that,

727
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,799
like a lot of them do.

728
00:40:19,926 --> 00:40:21,718
Can't blame her.

729
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,019
You'd think she'd have moved.

730
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:39,569
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

731
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:41,863
I've invited Reverend Laws.

732
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:43,531
We've already met.

733
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:44,532
Mr. Laws.

734
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:46,201
Mr. Hunter.

735
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:49,871
Reverend Laws is a comfort.

736
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:51,873
This is Detective Helen Marshall.

737
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:54,709
- How are you?
- Okay.

738
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:56,628
You work your team too hard,
Mr. Hunter.

739
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,755
I'll be the judge of that.

740
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,801
Do you want to sit down?

741
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,344
Thank you.

742
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:20,151
Mrs. Hall, would you mind
if we had a word in private?

743
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:23,488
Well, there really isn't anything

744
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:27,325
that Reverend Laws hasn't already heard.

745
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,327
All the same.

746
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,831
No, it's okay.

747
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,582
It's fine. It's fine.
On you go.

748
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,876
Okay.

749
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,182
Eric was a suspect

750
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,019
on the Clare Strachan murder,
wasn't he?

751
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,312
Yeah.

752
00:41:55,438 --> 00:41:59,316
Until that letter came,
supposedly from the Ripper.

753
00:41:59,442 --> 00:42:01,526
You don't think Strachanwas
killed by the Ripper?

754
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,362
Eric knew it wasn't the Ripper.

755
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:07,699
He never did shut up about things,
did he?

756
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:11,369
He was calling people up, papers,

757
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,621
anybody who'd listen.

758
00:42:13,748 --> 00:42:16,666
So someone put them on to him...

759
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:17,792
shut him up.

760
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,881
Eric kept notes.

761
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:27,552
He kept recordings and everything.

762
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:28,553
I gave everything

763
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,057
to Detective Superintendent Jobson.

764
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,726
Okay.

765
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,896
It was three years ago.

766
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,814
And you've heard nothing?

767
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,734
Just a minute.

768
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,694
Okay.

769
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,207
I found these in the garage.

770
00:43:01,295 --> 00:43:04,714
Clare Strachan is page 13,
I think.

771
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,555
It's my husband's business interests.

772
00:43:13,933 --> 00:43:16,935
I didn't-- didn't ask any questions.

773
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:24,192
Did Eric have any
particularly close friends?

774
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:26,694
Not really, no.
Only Dougie.

775
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:28,363
Dougie used to come over

776
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:31,533
and play a round or two with
Eric every now and again.

777
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:33,201
Dougie?

778
00:43:33,327 --> 00:43:34,494
Tommy Douglas?

779
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,372
Yeah, and his wife, Sharon.

780
00:43:37,498 --> 00:43:38,706
She was much younger than him too.

781
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,834
I think she was model,
I think.

782
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:47,674
What would you do

783
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,510
if they threw you out?

784
00:43:50,636 --> 00:43:52,804
I don't know.

785
00:43:57,309 --> 00:44:02,188
Did some bad things,
did Eric.

786
00:44:02,314 --> 00:44:05,608
But he didn't deserve
what happened to him.

787
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,581
You look tired.

788
00:44:19,707 --> 00:44:22,500
I haven't been sleeping.

789
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:25,336
Isnâ€™t that the worst kind of hell?

790
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,722
Good night, Mrs. Hall.

791
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:46,608
What did he say to you?

792
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:48,443
Nothing, really.

793
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:50,528
He was just kind.

794
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,030
Kind?
What do you mean?

795
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,156
Kind about what?

796
00:44:53,282 --> 00:44:55,867
He was just friendly, Peter.

797
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,578
You're supposed to be on duty.

798
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:17,472
Your wife's been calling,
Mr. Hunter.

799
00:45:17,598 --> 00:45:19,599
And 64.

800
00:45:23,896 --> 00:45:25,772
I'm going up.

801
00:45:25,898 --> 00:45:27,607
You sure you don't want a quick drink?

802
00:45:27,733 --> 00:45:29,567
No, thank you.

803
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:34,197
Well, I'd better go and say hello.

804
00:45:36,575 --> 00:45:38,159
Don't forget to call the wife.

805
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:46,751
Evening.

806
00:45:49,088 --> 00:45:50,964
Want a drink?

807
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:54,133
Ah, okay,
Bob,I'll have a quick one.

808
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,636
Looks like you had one of them already.

809
00:45:56,762 --> 00:45:58,137
Steady on, Bob.

810
00:45:58,264 --> 00:45:59,639
Out of order.

811
00:45:59,765 --> 00:46:00,682
Oh, I don't know.

812
00:46:00,808 --> 00:46:03,309
I mean,
I fucking definitely would.

813
00:46:03,435 --> 00:46:04,352
Wouldn't you, Dickie?

814
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:05,895
Yeah.

815
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:07,772
Get him a drink.

816
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,607
I'll have a bitter, please, mate.

817
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:55,403
Yeah, well, Eric,
bent as a two bob note,

818
00:46:55,529 --> 00:46:58,031
gets involved with this gang
knocking off post offices.

819
00:46:58,157 --> 00:46:59,532
All goes belly-up.

820
00:46:59,658 --> 00:47:01,534
They take it out on him.

821
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,202
Brought it on himself, really.

822
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:04,370
Yeah, and onto her.

823
00:47:04,496 --> 00:47:05,872
Poor cow.

824
00:47:05,998 --> 00:47:07,999
She reckoned Eric got
done'cause he kept bleating on

825
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,585
about Clare Strachan not
being one of Ripper's.

826
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,381
Not Yorkshire Post,
is it, boss?

827
00:47:15,507 --> 00:47:17,383
It's part of Eric's stash.

828
00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:18,635
Nice.

829
00:47:18,761 --> 00:47:19,761
My guess is that

830
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:21,888
Eric Hall and Tommy
Douglas were running it.

831
00:47:22,014 --> 00:47:23,181
Dougie gets pensioned off,

832
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,058
sinks all his comp into wank mags.

833
00:47:25,184 --> 00:47:27,727
Makes sense.

834
00:47:27,853 --> 00:47:30,396
Listen, John,
are you okay holding the fort for a while?

835
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:32,857
Yeah, yeah,
good place to pause, take stock.

836
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,526
Okay, I want to talk to Dougie.

837
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:37,028
Douglas is fucked.

838
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,696
He's a bitter man.

839
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:42,241
Take care, Peter.

840
00:47:42,368 --> 00:47:46,079
And as they do so,
it's Bill Ady's Miss Hunter.

841
00:47:46,205 --> 00:47:50,750
Gaintree going wonderfully
well on the outside in third.

842
00:47:50,876 --> 00:47:52,752
She's a lovely-looking kid.

843
00:47:52,878 --> 00:47:55,088
You're a lucky man.

844
00:47:55,214 --> 00:47:57,173
She keeps me young,
does our Karen.

845
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:00,593
You got any yourself?

846
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:04,389
No, no,
just me and the wife.

847
00:48:06,141 --> 00:48:08,184
You came through all right, Dougie.

848
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,602
You think so?

849
00:48:09,728 --> 00:48:11,938
I'm on three different kinds of painkillers

850
00:48:12,064 --> 00:48:14,273
for this useless bugger.

851
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,776
Bastard.

852
00:48:16,902 --> 00:48:18,111
Never found them neither.

853
00:48:18,237 --> 00:48:21,239
Not likely to,
are they? Not now.

854
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,825
Least the force saw you all right.

855
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:25,159
Bollocks.

856
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:28,663
All this is all on the never-never,
isn't it?

857
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:31,916
Business didn't work out with Eric, then?

858
00:48:33,127 --> 00:48:34,502
What business?

859
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:36,379
Spunk magazine.

860
00:48:41,635 --> 00:48:43,886
Hello, love.

861
00:48:45,305 --> 00:48:46,848
Who's this?

862
00:48:46,974 --> 00:48:48,516
Peter Hunter, Sharon, love,

863
00:48:48,642 --> 00:48:50,393
assistant chief constable.

864
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:52,311
Yeah?

865
00:48:52,438 --> 00:48:54,647
Ten bloody years he gave you lot.

866
00:48:54,773 --> 00:48:55,982
Come on, Karen.

867
00:48:56,108 --> 00:48:58,234
Let's get some dinner.

868
00:49:02,448 --> 00:49:04,073
It was hard on her and all.

869
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:07,827
Some cunt tried to kill me.

870
00:49:07,953 --> 00:49:10,997
Can you imagine what that does to you?

871
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:13,499
Tell me about it, Dougie.

872
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:16,669
I never got the chance to ask before.

873
00:49:16,795 --> 00:49:19,464
That night at the Karachi Club?

874
00:49:23,552 --> 00:49:25,803
I don't remember a thing.

875
00:49:32,895 --> 00:49:34,771
What the fucking hell is he doing here?

876
00:49:34,897 --> 00:49:35,772
Sharon, please.

877
00:49:35,898 --> 00:49:36,856
I'm not fucking having it.

878
00:49:36,982 --> 00:49:37,899
I don't want you involved.

879
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:40,234
Not now. In the house,
come on.

880
00:49:44,531 --> 00:49:47,074
Pete.
Hi, good to see you.

881
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:48,242
You look well.

882
00:49:48,368 --> 00:49:49,869
You know why I'm here, Maurice?

883
00:49:49,995 --> 00:49:52,038
Um, short straw?

884
00:49:52,164 --> 00:49:54,207
Eric Hall.

885
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:56,709
Three years,
Leeds have had Eric Hall's notes.

886
00:49:56,835 --> 00:49:59,212
Yeah, well, he were always
up to his fucking neck in shit,

887
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:00,630
were Eric.

888
00:50:00,756 --> 00:50:01,881
Those notes his wife sent over,

889
00:50:02,007 --> 00:50:03,841
they were just ramblings,
to be honest.

890
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,468
Ramblings?

891
00:50:05,594 --> 00:50:08,805
Like the fact that he
pimped Clare Strachan?

892
00:50:08,931 --> 00:50:11,182
Yeah, well,
nothing was ever proved.

893
00:50:14,603 --> 00:50:15,937
What about this?

894
00:50:20,108 --> 00:50:22,485
Like I said,
he was up to his fucking neck in it.

895
00:50:22,611 --> 00:50:27,740
Maurice, that rag features
one of the Ripper's victims.

896
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:30,076
Occupational hazard,
isn't it?

897
00:50:32,746 --> 00:50:35,289
What happened, Maurice?

898
00:50:35,415 --> 00:50:36,833
How do you mean?

899
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:40,169
When did we start to be on
opposite sides of the fence?

900
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,422
We aren't.

901
00:50:43,549 --> 00:50:46,884
It feels like it, though,
doesn't it?

902
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,937
Whoo!

903
00:50:58,063 --> 00:51:00,815
Down into the fucking belly we go!

904
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:10,908
Is it all right if we smoke?

905
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,164
Oh, yes.

906
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:37,310
Right, Detective Inspector
Richard Alderman,

907
00:51:37,436 --> 00:51:38,769
Detective Inspector Jim Prentice,

908
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:40,104
I'd like to thank you for coming--

909
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,649
We got any sandwiches?

910
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:45,568
Let's get started,
shall we?

911
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:50,907
Both of you have been
involved in the Ripper inquiry

912
00:51:51,033 --> 00:51:52,783
from the off,
so obviously,

913
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,952
you both have a tremendous
amount of knowledge

914
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,787
about the different investigations,

915
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:59,123
the methods,
and procedures.

916
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:00,499
You were the senior detectives.

917
00:52:00,626 --> 00:52:02,001
Still are.

918
00:52:02,127 --> 00:52:06,255
Right, and the other detective
involved was Bob Craven?

919
00:52:09,468 --> 00:52:12,428
So I'm interested to know what you feel

920
00:52:12,554 --> 00:52:15,473
given that you've worked under
Bill Molloy and Maurice Jobson

921
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,600
What we feel?

922
00:52:19,811 --> 00:52:21,854
This is my first Sunday
off in three months.

923
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,523
Is that your best fucking question,
Mr. Hunter?

924
00:52:26,985 --> 00:52:28,653
Sit down.

925
00:52:30,155 --> 00:52:33,157
Sit down,
Detective Inspector.

926
00:52:39,331 --> 00:52:40,539
I'd like to know the differences

927
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:43,626
in the styles of operations,
if you don't mind.

928
00:52:43,752 --> 00:52:46,128
Everything was different.

929
00:52:46,254 --> 00:52:47,713
This was five years ago.

930
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,006
Much smaller op.

931
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:51,634
So Clare Strachan wasn't in at this stage?

932
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,594
Not until after the blood
tests and the letters.

933
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,097
Yeah, like you didn't know.

934
00:52:56,223 --> 00:52:59,225
Strachan was in and out for
quite some time, wasn't she?

935
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:00,685
Initially, yeah.

936
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:02,061
That's also true

937
00:53:02,187 --> 00:53:04,230
of a number of the other
murders and attacks, isn't it?

938
00:53:04,356 --> 00:53:05,648
What's your point?

939
00:53:05,774 --> 00:53:09,026
My point is, who's in,
who's out, and who decides?

940
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,403
So you want me and Jim to go through

941
00:53:10,529 --> 00:53:12,196
every fucking unsolved
murder in Yorkshire

942
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,073
and tell you why or why
they're not Ripper cases?

943
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:16,450
Just one.
Clare Strachan.

944
00:53:19,204 --> 00:53:21,914
Lucky the Ripper wrote that letter, eh?

945
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,750
Otherwise, Clare would have
been just another unsolved.

946
00:53:24,876 --> 00:53:26,377
It wasn't the fucking Ripper.

947
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:27,712
- Shut up, Dick.
- Shut the fuck up.

948
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:29,714
I'm not having this piece
of shit strolling in here

949
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,465
telling me what I can and can't say.

950
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:32,758
Come on, John.
You know.

951
00:53:32,884 --> 00:53:34,427
Everyone knows.
He's talking bollocks.

952
00:53:34,553 --> 00:53:35,970
- Of course it was the Ripper.
- Fuck off.

953
00:53:36,096 --> 00:53:38,055
Strachan was knocked up with Eric's kid,
wasn't she?

954
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:39,765
So he did her.

955
00:53:39,891 --> 00:53:41,434
So what's the Ripper doing

956
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,270
claiming Clare as one of his, then?

957
00:53:49,443 --> 00:53:51,819
It was only ever a rumor about
Strachan being knocked up,

958
00:53:51,945 --> 00:53:52,987
just hearsay.

959
00:53:53,113 --> 00:53:54,447
You still should have told me, John.

960
00:53:54,573 --> 00:53:57,033
Yeah, I know.
Sorry, boss.

961
00:53:58,243 --> 00:54:00,453
Jobson's not going to be very happy,
is he?

962
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:02,246
Way we've treated his lads.

963
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,914
Maurice can piss off.

964
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:07,418
It's a Home Office review.

965
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,420
Do you think you're up for all this, Pete?

966
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:10,671
How do you mean?

967
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:13,591
Well, it's getting dead murky,
isn't it?

968
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:17,553
No one takes the bone
off me this time round.

969
00:54:21,933 --> 00:54:24,643
Well, I'm going to get an early night.

970
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:26,145
See you in the morning, boss.

971
00:54:26,271 --> 00:54:27,146
- Okay.
- Night.

972
00:54:27,272 --> 00:54:28,272
Yeah.

973
00:54:47,334 --> 00:54:48,334
Hello.

974
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,335
Hunter?

975
00:54:49,461 --> 00:54:51,003
Tommy Douglas.

976
00:54:51,129 --> 00:54:52,838
I need to see you right away.

977
00:54:52,964 --> 00:54:54,173
What is it, Dougie?

978
00:54:54,299 --> 00:54:56,675
I need to see you.

979
00:54:56,802 --> 00:54:58,010
Right now?

980
00:54:58,136 --> 00:55:00,346
I've got serious information.

981
00:55:00,472 --> 00:55:01,680
Concerning?

982
00:55:01,807 --> 00:55:05,017
Concerning me,
for fuck's sake.

983
00:55:05,143 --> 00:55:06,685
Not on the phone.

984
00:55:06,812 --> 00:55:08,687
I need to see you.

985
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:54,543
No!

986
00:57:03,136 --> 00:57:05,679
Do they know who died first?

987
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,432
No.

988
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,309
Preliminary postmortem revealed

989
00:57:10,435 --> 00:57:13,938
Karen Douglas died of a single
stab wound to the heart.

990
00:57:15,774 --> 00:57:18,484
You said Douglas called you.

991
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:19,985
He had information.

992
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:21,111
About what?

993
00:57:21,238 --> 00:57:23,072
We'll never know now,
will we?

994
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:33,832
Ex-copper and his kid.

995
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:35,501
Top policeman.

996
00:57:35,627 --> 00:57:37,169
Sniff of the Ripper in there.

997
00:57:37,295 --> 00:57:39,338
Right fucking mess.

998
00:57:39,464 --> 00:57:41,507
Doesn't look good,
does it?

999
00:57:41,633 --> 00:57:43,175
You sound like you're blaming me.

1000
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:46,345
Word is, you've been
intimidating Jobson's officers,

1001
00:57:46,471 --> 00:57:48,180
questioning their integrity.

1002
00:57:48,306 --> 00:57:50,849
Well, I've certainly been
questioning their capabilities.

1003
00:57:50,976 --> 00:57:52,434
There've been threats of resignation.

1004
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,103
Oh, good.

1005
00:57:54,229 --> 00:57:57,273
Pete, it's a lousy job.

1006
00:57:57,399 --> 00:57:59,817
No one would blame
you if you pulled out.

1007
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:03,320
Absolutely not, sir.
No way.

1008
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:04,989
Not now.

1009
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:07,825
So long as you're not
letting it get to you, Peter,

1010
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,286
letting it get personal.

1011
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:01,503
Mr. Hunter,
I wonder if you could comment

1012
00:59:01,629 --> 00:59:03,255
on the catalog of bungling and neglect

1013
00:59:03,381 --> 00:59:05,257
that has characterized this investigation.

1014
00:59:05,383 --> 00:59:07,176
These issues are a
matter of concern to us

1015
00:59:07,302 --> 00:59:09,011
and are part and parcel of the review,

1016
00:59:09,137 --> 00:59:10,512
but it would be unprofessional of me

1017
00:59:10,638 --> 00:59:12,139
to comment any further at this time.

1018
00:59:12,265 --> 00:59:14,183
Are you, at present,
investigating any connection

1019
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:15,726
between the murders of Clare Strachan

1020
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,561
and a vice detective called Eric Hall?

1021
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:18,771
Not at all.

1022
00:59:18,897 --> 00:59:20,314
So there's no truth that those murders

1023
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,607
are linked to the recent murder

1024
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:23,942
of ex-policeman Thomas Douglas
and his daughter, Karen?

1025
00:59:24,069 --> 00:59:24,985
Absolutely not.

1026
00:59:25,111 --> 00:59:26,445
Are you able to confirm or otherwise

1027
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:27,946
rumors circulating to the effect

1028
00:59:28,073 --> 00:59:30,949
that you're about to be removed
from the so-called super squad

1029
00:59:31,076 --> 00:59:33,827
due to personal conflicts
with senior police officers?

1030
00:59:35,455 --> 00:59:37,247
Interview's over.
Thank you.

1031
00:59:39,084 --> 00:59:40,209
Where's Helen?

1032
00:59:40,335 --> 00:59:41,293
She should have been here.

1033
00:59:41,419 --> 00:59:42,628
I thought she would be.

1034
00:59:42,754 --> 00:59:44,755
When are you going back to Manchester?

1035
00:59:56,142 --> 00:59:58,352
Thank you.

1036
00:59:58,478 --> 00:59:59,686
Miss Marshall not in her room?

1037
00:59:59,813 --> 01:00:02,689
No, sir,
not since yesterday.

1038
01:00:03,691 --> 01:00:07,319
Oh, this was left for you, sir.

1039
01:00:11,366 --> 01:00:14,535
I heard they're closing all
the shops early again, sir,

1040
01:00:14,661 --> 01:00:16,453
because of him.

1041
01:00:18,957 --> 01:00:19,957
Thank you.

1042
01:00:52,532 --> 01:00:53,699
Hello, Mrs. Hall.

1043
01:00:53,825 --> 01:00:55,033
Hello.

1044
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,035
So sorry to bother you again.

1045
01:00:57,162 --> 01:00:58,203
I was just wondering

1046
01:00:58,329 --> 01:01:01,373
if Miss Marshall had
been back here at all.

1047
01:01:01,499 --> 01:01:04,042
Helen, yes.

1048
01:01:04,169 --> 01:01:07,546
She came back last night at about 9:30,
I think.

1049
01:01:07,672 --> 01:01:10,716
She wanted to see, um,
Reverend Laws.

1050
01:01:10,842 --> 01:01:13,218
He's helped me so much at least...

1051
01:01:13,344 --> 01:01:15,262
I'm really pleased that
they've become acquainted.

1052
01:01:15,388 --> 01:01:16,763
They met after we were here?

1053
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,432
Yes, yes.

1054
01:01:18,558 --> 01:01:19,933
She's become quite the convert.

1055
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:21,059
Oh, yeah?

1056
01:01:21,186 --> 01:01:24,104
He lives in Fitzwilliam,
doesn't he?

1057
01:01:26,191 --> 01:01:28,066
Netherton Close.

1058
01:01:29,527 --> 01:01:30,986
I've never been there myself, mind.

1059
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:09,209
Where have you been?

1060
01:03:09,335 --> 01:03:10,210
I had to go home.

1061
01:03:10,336 --> 01:03:11,712
What for?

1062
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:13,380
I was worried about you.

1063
01:03:13,506 --> 01:03:16,049
I don't want to talk about it, Peter.

1064
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:18,260
I went to see Mrs. Hall.

1065
01:03:18,386 --> 01:03:20,178
She said you were
looking for Martin Laws.

1066
01:03:20,305 --> 01:03:22,055
He's just been very supportive.

1067
01:03:22,181 --> 01:03:23,056
About what?

1068
01:03:23,182 --> 01:03:24,808
Just leave it, Pete, please!

1069
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:30,230
I've got some bad news.

1070
01:04:01,721 --> 01:04:04,473
Any of this gets out,
and I'm finished

1071
01:04:05,683 --> 01:04:07,351
Is it blackmail?

1072
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:08,352
Was there a note?

1073
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:09,728
No, no note

1074
01:04:09,854 --> 01:04:11,813
Well, then it's just someone
trying to rattle you

1075
01:04:11,939 --> 01:04:12,814
That's all

1076
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:15,317
Well, it's worked

1077
01:04:15,443 --> 01:04:17,361
What a fucking mess

1078
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:19,029
Hey, hey

1079
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,364
It'll be all right

1080
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,366
It's nothing

1081
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:25,202
It's just two people in a
park after a rough day

1082
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:26,536
It's nothing

1083
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:29,039
We all need a break, Pete.

1084
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:32,250
It's Christmas,
isn't it?

1085
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,630
Come on.
We should get a drink.

1086
01:04:43,638 --> 01:04:45,847
Here, young couple
just got married, right?

1087
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:47,849
And he comes home on a
Friday night from the pub,

1088
01:04:47,975 --> 01:04:49,685
and he says,

1089
01:04:49,811 --> 01:04:51,269
"I want to try a new sexual position."

1090
01:04:51,396 --> 01:04:53,605
She says, "Oh, aye,
what's that?"

1091
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:55,774
He says,
"It's called wheelbarrow, right,

1092
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,276
"and what you have to do is,

1093
01:04:58,403 --> 01:05:00,278
"you have to get down, like,
on all fours,

1094
01:05:00,405 --> 01:05:03,448
"and I'll get your legs,
and I'll slide in,

1095
01:05:03,574 --> 01:05:04,950
and then I walk you round."

1096
01:05:05,076 --> 01:05:06,618
And she went,
"All right, I'll do it,

1097
01:05:06,744 --> 01:05:09,121
as long as we don't go past me mum's."

1098
01:05:09,247 --> 01:05:10,122
To the super squad.

1099
01:05:10,248 --> 01:05:11,164
The brains trust.

1100
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:12,165
The fuckwits.

1101
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:13,458
Merry Christmas.

1102
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:47,075
Helen

1103
01:05:52,206 --> 01:05:53,415
That was fun

1104
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:55,208
Yeah, it was

1105
01:05:58,004 --> 01:06:00,756
I just-- I just wanted to
say thank you, really

1106
01:06:00,882 --> 01:06:03,759
Thanks for everything

1107
01:06:03,885 --> 01:06:07,095
And I wanted to say I'm sorry

1108
01:06:07,221 --> 01:06:09,931
I'm sorry if I insulted you.

1109
01:06:10,057 --> 01:06:11,057
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

1110
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:12,184
Pete.

1111
01:06:16,814 --> 01:06:20,817
I do like you,
too much.

1112
01:06:22,487 --> 01:06:24,529
That's why what happened happened.

1113
01:06:24,655 --> 01:06:26,573
Please, Pete, don't.

1114
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:32,287
I just wanted to tell you how I felt,
you know?

1115
01:06:32,413 --> 01:06:36,875
Lot of bloody good screwing
the boss did me, eh?

1116
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:40,295
God, what a pair.

1117
01:06:45,426 --> 01:06:46,718
You have a merry Christmas, Helen.

1118
01:06:46,844 --> 01:06:48,512
You too.

1119
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:07,989
Pete?

1120
01:07:11,369 --> 01:07:13,995
I fell pregnant.

1121
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:18,458
What?

1122
01:07:18,584 --> 01:07:22,128
I got rid of it.

1123
01:07:22,255 --> 01:07:23,421
When?

1124
01:07:23,548 --> 01:07:25,757
Um, Sunday

1125
01:07:25,883 --> 01:07:26,758
Manchester

1126
01:07:26,884 --> 01:07:29,594
Martin Laws helped me

1127
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,137
I'm sorry

1128
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:33,557
I'm so sorry

1129
01:07:37,562 --> 01:07:39,396
Why didn't you come to me?

1130
01:08:16,475 --> 01:08:18,768
I want to know what the fuck
you're gonna do about this mess.

1131
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:21,396
You let us worry about that, yeah?

1132
01:08:21,522 --> 01:08:23,231
You just keep it together, lad.

1133
01:08:23,357 --> 01:08:24,816
I am not going to be the fucking goat.

1134
01:08:24,942 --> 01:08:26,776
There's always a goat,
and it ain't going to be me.

1135
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:27,903
It won't come to that.

1136
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:28,904
Fucking right,
it won't.

1137
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:31,281
Is that a threat?
Are you...

1138
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:32,574
You threatening me, Dickie?

1139
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,911
I am just saying that it's got out of hand.

1140
01:08:36,037 --> 01:08:38,413
Right, he's going to rip this
whole fucking thing open.

1141
01:08:38,539 --> 01:08:40,916
Not a word, Dickie, eh?

1142
01:08:41,042 --> 01:08:42,417
Not a word.

1143
01:08:42,543 --> 01:08:45,754
Now, you'll shut up,
and you'll listen to me.

1144
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,297
We will take care of everything.

1145
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:48,757
That's what you say,
isn't it?

1146
01:08:50,968 --> 01:08:54,512
You will do as I say.

1147
01:08:54,639 --> 01:08:58,016
Or else I will start
fucking about with you.

1148
01:08:58,142 --> 01:09:00,143
I'm upset.

1149
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:08,526
We all are.

1150
01:09:08,653 --> 01:09:11,029
I can't do time.

1151
01:09:11,155 --> 01:09:13,031
I can't take a fall.

1152
01:09:15,493 --> 01:09:18,370
You won't have to, yeah?

1153
01:09:18,496 --> 01:09:20,997
I'll look after you.

1154
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:26,127
Gentlemen.

1155
01:09:26,253 --> 01:09:29,673
What do you want,
you fucking poof?

1156
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:32,175
Out.

1157
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,302
Get out.

1158
01:09:42,728 --> 01:09:44,854
What's the matter with him?

1159
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:49,484
Bad day.

1160
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:53,530
Aren't they all?

1161
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:58,910
"Always got to be a goat,"eh, Bob?

1162
01:09:59,036 --> 01:10:01,079
You know that, son.

1163
01:10:06,919 --> 01:10:09,546
You've had a few,
haven't you, Mr. Hunter?

1164
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,882
So who's it gonna be, then?

1165
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:16,011
Who's gonna take the fall for Dougie?

1166
01:10:18,556 --> 01:10:23,393
Tommy Douglas was my best mate.

1167
01:10:25,563 --> 01:10:28,064
Mate with a grudge and a big mouth.

1168
01:10:30,735 --> 01:10:35,697
Shall I tell you what I do know, eh?

1169
01:10:35,823 --> 01:10:37,699
You're fucked.

1170
01:10:37,825 --> 01:10:40,493
You're fucking finished.

1171
01:10:50,921 --> 01:10:52,464
Merry Christmas, Bob.

1172
01:12:31,522 --> 01:12:33,565
8:31 and 8 seconds.

1173
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:37,735
Thought Carl was gonna
have it off your wrist.

1174
01:12:37,862 --> 01:12:39,904
Took a shine to it,
didn't he?

1175
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:41,364
They're lovely,
aren't they?

1176
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,491
Yeah, they are.

1177
01:13:36,962 --> 01:13:38,338
Someone burnt my house down.

1178
01:13:38,464 --> 01:13:39,505
My fucking house!

1179
01:13:39,632 --> 01:13:40,840
I know.
I know.

1180
01:13:40,966 --> 01:13:42,634
Well, what the fuck are
you gonna do about it?

1181
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,385
- Peter, please.
- It was my house.

1182
01:13:44,511 --> 01:13:46,512
They could've killed us,
could've killed my wife.

1183
01:13:46,639 --> 01:13:47,639
Where's Joan now?

1184
01:13:47,765 --> 01:13:50,099
Are you asking me to trust you?

1185
01:13:52,269 --> 01:13:53,228
What's this?

1186
01:13:53,354 --> 01:13:56,105
Mr. Hunter.

1187
01:13:56,232 --> 01:13:57,774
Sit down, please.

1188
01:14:01,153 --> 01:14:03,238
Hear about the house?

1189
01:14:03,364 --> 01:14:05,073
Yeah, yeah,
we know, Pete.

1190
01:14:07,368 --> 01:14:08,701
What's going on?

1191
01:14:08,827 --> 01:14:10,828
Allegations have been made against you

1192
01:14:10,955 --> 01:14:13,748
that indicate a disciplinary offense.

1193
01:14:13,874 --> 01:14:15,250
What allegations?

1194
01:14:15,376 --> 01:14:17,502
We're making a number of inquiries.

1195
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:19,921
Peter, we would like to invite you

1196
01:14:20,047 --> 01:14:21,589
to take extra leave.

1197
01:14:21,715 --> 01:14:23,424
Extra leave?

1198
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:24,926
What about the Ripper inquiry?

1199
01:14:25,052 --> 01:14:26,594
Chief Superintendent John Nolan

1200
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,096
will take over your team.

1201
01:14:33,727 --> 01:14:37,605
Has this anything to do with
Detective Helen Marshall?

1202
01:14:37,731 --> 01:14:40,108
Can't say,
Mr. Hunter.

1203
01:14:40,234 --> 01:14:41,859
We'd like you to provide
us with the details

1204
01:14:41,986 --> 01:14:43,903
of your bank accounts,
you know, savings account,

1205
01:14:44,029 --> 01:14:45,863
any credit cards you might have.

1206
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:47,824
I'm afraid I can't give
you that information.

1207
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:48,825
Peter.

1208
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:50,910
The fire took the lot.

1209
01:14:51,036 --> 01:14:52,370
Very convenient.

1210
01:14:52,496 --> 01:14:53,538
Yeah, it is,
isn't it?

1211
01:14:53,664 --> 01:14:55,081
Very convenient.

1212
01:14:55,207 --> 01:14:56,749
You think about that, sir.

1213
01:14:56,875 --> 01:14:58,584
Take it easy.

1214
01:14:58,711 --> 01:14:59,919
Passport?

1215
01:15:00,045 --> 01:15:01,838
We lost everything

1216
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:03,006
Pity.

1217
01:15:03,132 --> 01:15:04,841
Fucking hell.

1218
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:06,843
It is now my intention to ask you

1219
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:08,219
to clear out your office

1220
01:15:08,345 --> 01:15:10,013
and to leave these
headquarters immediately.

1221
01:15:10,139 --> 01:15:11,723
You will have to make yourself available

1222
01:15:11,849 --> 01:15:14,976
for an interview tomorrow,2:00,

1223
01:15:15,102 --> 01:15:20,023
Leeds Street,
my office.

1224
01:15:22,067 --> 01:15:23,943
I'll give you a hand, eh?

1225
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:40,543
I'm, uh,
sorry about your house.

1226
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:42,378
This is your mail.

1227
01:15:44,715 --> 01:15:46,758
Still on the same side, Maurice?

1228
01:15:46,884 --> 01:15:48,426
Pete.

1229
01:15:48,552 --> 01:15:50,094
How deep does the rot go, Maurice?

1230
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:52,764
Eh, how deep?

1231
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:54,807
And who stops it?

1232
01:17:12,344 --> 01:17:13,845
Mr. Hunter.

1233
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:16,180
Welcome back, sir.

1234
01:17:16,306 --> 01:17:18,015
Whether Mr. Hunter's suspension

1235
01:17:18,142 --> 01:17:20,852
is in any way linked to an
apparently hostile report

1236
01:17:20,978 --> 01:17:23,688
he was preparing into the
management complexities

1237
01:17:23,814 --> 01:17:25,064
of the West Yorkshire police

1238
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:29,735
in regard to their handling
of the Ripper inquiry.

1239
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:31,487
Well, in this pizza parlor,

1240
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:33,698
they've noticed a very
sharp fall off in trade

1241
01:17:33,824 --> 01:17:35,032
since the Ripper's last victim.

1242
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:38,202
Hello, is Mr. Evans available, please?

1243
01:17:38,328 --> 01:17:40,580
It's Peter Hunter again.

1244
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:44,876
Yeah, I know that, love,
but it's quite urgent.

1245
01:17:45,002 --> 01:17:46,878
The prime minister has
taken a personal interest

1246
01:17:47,004 --> 01:17:48,546
in the hunt for the Ripper.

1247
01:17:48,672 --> 01:17:49,630
Okay, thank you.

1248
01:17:49,756 --> 01:17:51,299
Series of photofit pictures

1249
01:17:51,425 --> 01:17:52,967
of a man they would like to question

1250
01:17:53,093 --> 01:17:54,635
in connection with the killings.

1251
01:18:36,303 --> 01:18:39,680
Pete, I was worried about you, mate.

1252
01:18:39,806 --> 01:18:43,017
Hey, John.
I'm okay.

1253
01:18:43,143 --> 01:18:48,147
Listen, mate,
go home.

1254
01:18:48,273 --> 01:18:51,984
I haven't got a home.

1255
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:53,861
Go to Joan's folks'or wherever.

1256
01:18:53,987 --> 01:18:56,572
Just go.

1257
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,909
They're not finishedwith me, mate.

1258
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:02,954
I've got a meeting with
Angus and the Owl at 2:00.

1259
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,705
This whole thing is bollocks,
isn't it?

1260
01:19:04,831 --> 01:19:07,792
The whole thing,
absolute bollocks.

1261
01:19:07,918 --> 01:19:09,460
What about you?

1262
01:19:09,586 --> 01:19:11,629
Shouldn't you be getting them
all together, back to work?

1263
01:19:11,755 --> 01:19:13,631
Monday week,
if we're allowed to.

1264
01:19:13,757 --> 01:19:16,801
They're talking about
bringing another force in.

1265
01:19:16,927 --> 01:19:18,970
I don't even care.

1266
01:19:19,096 --> 01:19:22,473
Don't even care.

1267
01:20:18,447 --> 01:20:19,614
Yes?

1268
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,073
This is Peter Hunter.

1269
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:25,161
Oh, yes,
I've been watching you on the telly.

1270
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:26,662
Took your time.

1271
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:28,039
What have you got to tell me?

1272
01:20:28,165 --> 01:20:31,792
You have a date in Preston,
Frenchwood Street.

1273
01:20:31,918 --> 01:20:33,669
Tonight.

1274
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,927
String that bastard up!

1275
01:20:42,054 --> 01:20:43,429
Calm down.
Back up.

1276
01:20:43,555 --> 01:20:45,097
You've got to string him up,
the bastard!

1277
01:20:45,223 --> 01:20:46,140
What's going on?

1278
01:20:46,266 --> 01:20:47,433
They've got him,
haven't they?

1279
01:20:47,559 --> 01:20:48,559
- What?
- Ripper.

1280
01:20:48,685 --> 01:20:50,227
They've got fucking Ripper,
haven't they?

1281
01:20:50,354 --> 01:20:52,438
The Yorkshire bloody Ripper,
he's down in the belly now.

1282
01:20:52,564 --> 01:20:53,773
Hey, steady.
Come on.

1283
01:20:53,899 --> 01:20:55,232
Get back.

1284
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:57,151
Come on!
Back off.

1285
01:20:59,363 --> 01:21:01,113
It's over, Pete.

1286
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:02,114
It's all over.

1287
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,658
I know.
I've heard, John.

1288
01:21:03,784 --> 01:21:05,076
It's great news.

1289
01:21:20,425 --> 01:21:23,803
I think you're in serious trouble, Peter.

1290
01:21:39,736 --> 01:21:44,115
Well, they're all in my brain,

1291
01:21:44,241 --> 01:21:46,701
reminding me of the beast that I am.

1292
01:21:51,123 --> 01:21:53,416
You'll feel better now.

1293
01:21:55,168 --> 01:21:57,211
I should tell Monica.

1294
01:21:57,337 --> 01:21:59,046
Who's Monica?

1295
01:21:59,172 --> 01:22:01,966
Monica's my wife.

1296
01:22:07,431 --> 01:22:08,806
Tart pulls this punter.

1297
01:22:08,932 --> 01:22:10,975
"Looks like a good-looking Bee Gee,"
she says,

1298
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:12,476
luckiest bitch alive.

1299
01:22:12,602 --> 01:22:13,811
So I get up here,

1300
01:22:13,937 --> 01:22:15,730
and I remember him
saying he needed a slash

1301
01:22:15,856 --> 01:22:18,107
and going behind the tank,
so that's where I go.

1302
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,359
And fuck me if there ain't an
hammer and a bloody knife

1303
01:22:20,485 --> 01:22:23,028
on the ground by the back wall.

1304
01:22:23,155 --> 01:22:24,697
I says to myself,

1305
01:22:24,823 --> 01:22:26,657
"I've just caught he
Yorkshire bloody Ripper."

1306
01:22:26,783 --> 01:22:28,159
Well done, Sarge.

1307
01:22:30,704 --> 01:22:32,121
How about that, then?

1308
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:35,166
Result.

1309
01:22:35,292 --> 01:22:36,792
- Well done.
- Cheers.

1310
01:22:58,523 --> 01:22:59,774
Right, Peter,I'd like to get

1311
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:03,068
straight to who it is e're
talking about, okay?

1312
01:23:06,406 --> 01:23:07,948
Okay.

1313
01:23:08,074 --> 01:23:10,618
Good.

1314
01:23:10,744 --> 01:23:15,623
So first off,
Myrtle Thompson.

1315
01:23:15,749 --> 01:23:17,625
I think, yes.

1316
01:23:17,751 --> 01:23:19,251
You think?

1317
01:23:19,377 --> 01:23:21,921
I know.
Yes.

1318
01:23:22,047 --> 01:23:24,048
Good.

1319
01:23:24,174 --> 01:23:25,174
Anita Bird?

1320
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,842
Yes.

1321
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:27,843
Teresa Campbell?

1322
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:28,844
Yes.

1323
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:30,054
Joan Richards?

1324
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,096
Yes.

1325
01:23:31,223 --> 01:23:32,181
Marie Watts?

1326
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:33,182
Yes.

1327
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:34,183
Rachel Williams?

1328
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:35,351
Yes.

1329
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:36,352
Dawn Johnson?

1330
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:37,436
Yes.

1331
01:23:37,562 --> 01:23:38,437
Katie Burden?

1332
01:23:38,563 --> 01:23:39,563
Yes.

1333
01:23:39,689 --> 01:23:40,564
Clare Strachan?

1334
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:43,609
Yes-- no.

1335
01:23:43,735 --> 01:23:44,610
You sure?

1336
01:23:44,736 --> 01:23:46,695
I said I didn't do her.

1337
01:23:49,407 --> 01:23:50,324
Elizabeth McQueen?

1338
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:51,325
Yes.

1339
01:23:51,451 --> 01:23:52,326
Dianne Pickles?

1340
01:23:52,452 --> 01:23:53,327
Yes.

1341
01:23:53,453 --> 01:23:54,411
Laura Baines?

1342
01:23:54,538 --> 01:23:55,788
Yes.

1343
01:24:00,627 --> 01:24:04,171
It's a lot of women,
isn't it, Peter?

1344
01:24:04,297 --> 01:24:06,841
Think we've left anybody out?

1345
01:24:09,302 --> 01:24:12,096
Yeah.
We have.

1346
01:24:15,267 --> 01:24:17,268
You best tell us, then.

1347
01:24:18,603 --> 01:24:20,855
Okay.

1348
01:24:20,981 --> 01:24:23,649
I saw her in The Oak.

1349
01:24:26,778 --> 01:24:30,406
And she annoyed me,
probably in some minor way.

1350
01:24:32,117 --> 01:24:35,160
I took her to be a prostitute.

1351
01:24:35,287 --> 01:24:37,162
So I hit her,

1352
01:24:37,289 --> 01:24:42,001
not on the head,
and then it was on the head.

1353
01:24:42,127 --> 01:24:44,336
I scratched her buttocks.

1354
01:24:44,462 --> 01:24:47,006
It was with a piece f hacksaw blade.

1355
01:24:47,132 --> 01:24:51,176
She was drunk.

1356
01:24:51,303 --> 01:24:55,347
She was laughing at me,
and she said,

1357
01:24:55,473 --> 01:24:59,685
"Come on.
Get it over with."

1358
01:24:59,811 --> 01:25:02,521
I said, "Don't worry.
I will."

1359
01:25:02,647 --> 01:25:04,189
And I hit her with the hammer.

1360
01:25:04,316 --> 01:25:07,359
She made a lot of noise.

1361
01:25:07,485 --> 01:25:10,487
So I-- I hit her again.

1362
01:25:12,657 --> 01:25:15,576
She was wearingvery
strong and cheap perfume.

1363
01:25:18,496 --> 01:25:21,874
Then I pushed a piece
of wood up her vagina

1364
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,043
to show her how disgusting she was,

1365
01:25:24,169 --> 01:25:25,336
that she was dirty.

1366
01:25:25,462 --> 01:25:27,046
She just talked about sex.

1367
01:25:27,172 --> 01:25:28,714
I got some filling from a sofa,

1368
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:34,553
and I pushed it down her throat,

1369
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:38,223
and I held her nose.

1370
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:41,894
She was making a lot of noise,
and there was a car there.

1371
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:44,772
It drove up while I was hiding her, like.

1372
01:25:44,898 --> 01:25:47,942
So I used a Phillips screwdriver

1373
01:25:48,068 --> 01:25:49,026
a big one.

1374
01:25:49,152 --> 01:25:50,527
I let go of her nose after a while,

1375
01:25:50,654 --> 01:25:52,613
but she was still breathing
and making a lot of noise

1376
01:25:52,739 --> 01:25:55,532
so I held it again.

1377
01:25:55,659 --> 01:25:58,035
I pulled all her clothes off,
and I stabbed her in the lungs.

1378
01:25:58,161 --> 01:25:59,870
I was steaming with anger.

1379
01:25:59,996 --> 01:26:02,039
Her eyes were open.

1380
01:26:02,165 --> 01:26:03,415
She seemed to be looking at me.

1381
01:26:03,541 --> 01:26:05,209
So I did the strangest thing.

1382
01:26:05,335 --> 01:26:06,502
I-- I stabbed her in the eye.

1383
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:08,837
I remember, I-- I put it to the lid,

1384
01:26:08,964 --> 01:26:10,839
and I sat down,
jerked it in.

1385
01:26:10,966 --> 01:26:12,091
I said,
"I'm sorry."

1386
01:26:12,217 --> 01:26:13,550
Then I had sex with her.

1387
01:26:13,677 --> 01:26:15,052
Her eyes were looking at me body.

1388
01:26:15,178 --> 01:26:16,220
She went into the back,

1389
01:26:16,346 --> 01:26:18,222
and I tried to hit her.
but I missed, and then I cried.

1390
01:26:18,348 --> 01:26:19,932
I caught the side of the door instead.

1391
01:26:20,058 --> 01:26:21,475
I kicked her.

1392
01:26:21,601 --> 01:26:23,227
"There's no need for that,"she said.

1393
01:26:23,353 --> 01:26:25,229
And I hit her on the head.

1394
01:26:25,355 --> 01:26:27,690
I took her clothes off,
and I said to her,

1395
01:26:28,358 --> 01:26:30,484
"You can't trust anyone these days."

1396
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:44,081
Clare were just so tired of running.

1397
01:26:44,207 --> 01:26:46,583
This is where she ended up.

1398
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:48,877
Not very nice,
is it?

1399
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:56,510
Well, what do you think?

1400
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:03,392
What do I think?

1401
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:09,231
Obstruction, withholding
evidence, murder.

1402
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,400
I think I'll fucking arrest you.

1403
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:15,696
Arrest me?
They want BJ dead.

1404
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:19,908
Tell me!

1405
01:27:20,035 --> 01:27:21,285
She wasn't one of the Ripper's.

1406
01:27:21,411 --> 01:27:23,037
Then why was she killed?

1407
01:27:23,163 --> 01:27:24,204
Was it because of the porn?

1408
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:25,539
Was it something to do with that?

1409
01:27:25,665 --> 01:27:27,374
It wasn't because of the porn.

1410
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,210
It was because of what she saw.

1411
01:27:30,336 --> 01:27:33,213
I just want them to stop.

1412
01:27:33,339 --> 01:27:34,214
Help me.

1413
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:35,215
No, they'll kill me.

1414
01:27:35,341 --> 01:27:37,342
I'll fucking kill you!

1415
01:27:41,431 --> 01:27:48,228
Six years ago,
the Karachi Club,

1416
01:27:48,354 --> 01:27:52,066
BJ were there and Clare.

1417
01:27:52,192 --> 01:27:54,526
She were a barmaid.

1418
01:27:54,652 --> 01:27:56,153
There were bad men there

1419
01:27:56,279 --> 01:27:59,740
John Dawson, policemen

1420
01:27:59,866 --> 01:28:02,868
Bob Craven,
Tommy Douglas.

1421
01:28:02,994 --> 01:28:04,495
We saw what happened.

1422
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:12,753
We saw my friend Eddie
come for his revenge.

1423
01:28:18,343 --> 01:28:20,886
Eddie settled his score

1424
01:28:21,012 --> 01:28:23,222
and then we saw him leave.

1425
01:28:23,348 --> 01:28:26,934
And then BJ and Clare
saw what came after.

1426
01:28:28,061 --> 01:28:29,103
Kill the cunts!

1427
01:28:29,229 --> 01:28:31,105
Kill them all!

1428
01:28:31,231 --> 01:28:33,482
Clean it up.

1429
01:28:33,608 --> 01:28:36,193
Now!

1430
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:38,695
Men came with guns.

1431
01:28:38,822 --> 01:28:40,864
We heard their voices.

1432
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:42,407
They were policemen.

1433
01:28:44,202 --> 01:28:48,747
Bill Molloy,
men you know.

1434
01:28:48,873 --> 01:28:50,707
Kill the fucking cunt.

1435
01:28:53,253 --> 01:28:55,420
Kill them all.

1436
01:29:08,601 --> 01:29:11,145
No eyes.
No questions.

1437
01:29:11,271 --> 01:29:13,647
They got Clare.

1438
01:29:13,773 --> 01:29:15,482
I'm next.

1439
01:29:15,608 --> 01:29:16,483
You're lying.

1440
01:29:16,609 --> 01:29:17,484
Fuck off!

1441
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:18,652
You're hurting me.

1442
01:29:18,778 --> 01:29:19,987
Talk to someone else.

1443
01:29:20,113 --> 01:29:21,321
There's nobody else left.

1444
01:29:21,447 --> 01:29:23,824
They're all fucking dead.

1445
01:29:25,869 --> 01:29:28,829
Who killed her?

1446
01:29:28,955 --> 01:29:31,832
Tell me.

1447
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:34,209
You know.

1448
01:29:47,182 --> 01:29:50,225
You came,
and you went.

1449
01:29:50,351 --> 01:29:54,897
No one else asked questions.

1450
01:29:55,023 --> 01:29:57,482
My wife had a miscarriage.

1451
01:29:57,609 --> 01:29:59,860
I had to leave.

1452
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:04,865
Well, you're back now.

1453
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:11,538
And now you know.

1454
01:30:23,968 --> 01:30:25,719
John?

1455
01:30:25,845 --> 01:30:27,804
How are you doing, mate?

1456
01:30:27,931 --> 01:30:31,141
Are you still with me?

1457
01:30:31,267 --> 01:30:33,477
Come in.

1458
01:30:33,603 --> 01:30:35,103
Be careful, mind.

1459
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:38,232
You don't work here
anymore, remember?

1460
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:48,659
Craven's out of control, John.

1461
01:30:48,785 --> 01:30:51,578
It's got to stop here.

1462
01:30:55,959 --> 01:30:57,668
He's here.

1463
01:30:57,794 --> 01:30:59,211
He's down in the belly.

1464
01:31:03,132 --> 01:31:08,553
Like you said, Pete,
he's out of control.

1465
01:31:50,054 --> 01:31:54,266
Five men.
Five guns.

1466
01:31:54,392 --> 01:31:55,684
Got it clear now, Pete?

1467
01:31:57,979 --> 01:31:59,479
Not you, John.

1468
01:33:03,086 --> 01:33:05,295
You bastard!

1469
01:33:05,421 --> 01:33:08,215
Dirty fucking Ripper!

1470
01:33:59,225 --> 01:34:02,936
He's found peace, Mrs. Hunter,

1471
01:34:03,062 --> 01:34:05,063
peace at last.

1472
01:34:06,305 --> 01:35:06,929
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
