# Among the trees
and by the river #

3
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:51,061
# Lying there, my darling shivers #

4
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:55,191
# In her sleep
she dreams of winter #

5
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,132
# Whiter than her breast #

6
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:02,506
# I feel her heart
move through her chest #

7
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,045
# Warm and steady
as she rests #

8
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:10,139
# Hear water ebbing
with her breath #

9
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,117
# Lulling me to sleep #

10
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,950
# Ohh-ohh-ohh #

11
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:20,290
# Ohh-ohh-ohh #

12
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:24,094
# And here in the sky #

13
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:28,758
# Lights flash before our eyes #

14
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:32,930
# And I feel your warm hand #

15
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,202
# Slipping into mine #

16
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:38,300
# And we lay... #

17
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:40,642
You okay?

18
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:44,513
# Will I come around? #

19
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:54,118
# Do I know
what you are feeling now? #

20
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:03,928
# This morning
we drove out of town #

21
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:07,198
# Into the hills
and looking down #

22
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:10,743
# Saw the ocean all around #

23
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:12,903
# As far as we could see #

24
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:17,480
All right, I have a secret
to tell you.

25
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:19,279
You're in the middle of the road.

26
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:22,445
I know.
Do you wanna hear it?

27
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:24,146
Do you wanna
move your car first?

28
00:02:24,324 --> 00:02:26,019
No, not really.

29
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,524
Okay.

30
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:30,391
I just wanna tell you
one more thing.

31
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:32,259
All right.

32
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,331
What?

33
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,404
That's not gonna be good.

34
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:41,040
Okay, tell me.

35
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:46,607
I've been in love with you...

36
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:32,185
Hey, hey, hey.

37
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:35,618
Shh.

38
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,214
John Muir said,

39
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:02,151
"Let children walk with nature.

40
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:04,951
Let them see the beautiful
blendings and communions

41
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:06,821
of death and life,

42
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,327
their joyous, inseparable unity,

43
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:14,763
and they will learn that death
is stingless indeed

44
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:16,869
and as beautiful as life."

45
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:19,764
That is my hope for Bennett,

46
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:22,965
that this amazing young man,

47
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,442
who was taken from us so suddenly,

48
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:27,875
who was so well-loved,

49
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:31,540
who was surrounded by everything
that was beautiful to him.

50
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,682
It is in this spirit
that we return Bennett

51
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:41,590
to that form from which God
miraculously created all life.

52
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:54,319
Come on.
Open the door, Ryan.

53
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:56,285
Hold on.

54
00:07:58,725 --> 00:07:59,555
Come on.

55
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,819
Just let me... Ryan.

56
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:02,360
Just let me... Hey.

57
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:04,623
Come on, buddy.
Let me in.

58
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:07,096
Jesus Christ, Ryan.

59
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:10,464
Open up some of these windows,
would ya?

60
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,662
I don't care what you say.

61
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:13,796
Next time you're gonna
let Gloria up here.

62
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,907
Sorry.

63
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:18,034
Smells like something died
and went to heaven.

64
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:19,771
I didn't know she was here.

65
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,141
Well, she's not.

66
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,377
But she's coming back very soon.

67
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:26,713
Where have you been?

68
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,754
I've been here.

69
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:30,287
What, in the house?

70
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:31,980
Yeah.

71
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:34,286
Well, then just check in
from time to time, would you?

72
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,087
Your mother's worried.

73
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:37,127
Okay.

74
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:40,926
What I wanna know...
What I need to know is, um,

75
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:46,370
what were the 17 minutes like
for my son?

76
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:49,372
I don't know what to tell you,
Mrs. Brewer. I wasn't there.

77
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:52,876
You've spoken with every doctor,
every nurse, every paramedic,

78
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,844
every fireman
that was on call that night.

79
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:57,143
I don't know what other information
I can give you.

80
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,615
What about Jordan Walker?

81
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:00,218
Mr. Walker is still in a coma.

82
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,845
I know, but I have
a surveillance tape,

83
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:05,550
and in that tape
it looks as if they spoke,

84
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:07,182
that they might have had
a conversation.

85
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:10,353
Would he have been capable of having
a conversation with my son?

86
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:13,260
That depends on how slow
the bleeding in his brain was.

87
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,459
Uh, I mean, it's possible

88
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:18,969
that he could have stayed
conscious long enough

89
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:21,073
to carry on a conversation.

90
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:23,539
Then he would have been
the last person

91
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:25,201
to speak to my son
before he died.

92
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:26,744
Yes.

93
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,781
Uh, I have an appointment at 9:00.
I'm sorry.

94
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:31,510
When do you think he'll wake up?

95
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:34,746
Uh, as I've said numerous times
before, Mrs. Brewer,

96
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:37,482
I have given you
all the answers that I know.

97
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,058
But he could wake up.
I mean, what would be the signs?

98
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,592
I'm sorry.

99
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,753
Dr. Leonard, 2291.

100
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,095
Allen?

101
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:52,471
Allen?

102
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,474
Hi. Hi.
How are you?

103
00:09:56,576 --> 00:10:01,172
I'm sorry. I had a head
full of numbers.

104
00:10:01,314 --> 00:10:05,045
Oh, you're sweating. Here.

105
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:07,142
Uh...

106
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,346
Yeah.

107
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:11,354
Yeah, thank you.
You're right.

108
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,117
I'll turn up the A.C.

109
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:18,722
Is this, uh...
Is this roster correct?

110
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:21,197
'Cause I don't have Linda
down here for the summer.

111
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,393
How are you?

112
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:23,901
All right.

113
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:26,267
You look like
you've forgotten to sleep.

114
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,867
I'm all right. I'm fine.

115
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:31,000
Thanks for the flowers.
They're not necessary.

116
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:32,509
I wanted to call so many times.

117
00:10:32,612 --> 00:10:35,513
I didn't know what to do
in this situation.

118
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:38,617
I just want to be strong
for Grace, that's all.

119
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:41,515
- That's all I'm doing.
- Of course.

120
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,921
So, we got, um...

121
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:49,517
We got 30 students here.

122
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:51,630
Ready and praying to graduate.

123
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:55,030
Well, let's see what I can do, huh?

124
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:58,464
If you want anything,
anything at all,

125
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:00,402
just let me know.

126
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,804
I will.

127
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:32,734
Ah! I read about
an interesting idea today.

128
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:36,599
I even made a purchase.

129
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:43,515
There seems to be a lot of research
on the Web about grief,

130
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:48,679
and, uh, I stumbled across
a couple of interesting suggestions.

131
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:50,447
Oh, Allen, no, don't.

132
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:53,389
They suggested we use a bell.

133
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:10,333
We can ring this
when we're missing Bennett

134
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:14,174
or when we think about him.

135
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:19,409
You can put it anywhere
in the house you like.

136
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,147
Can I see the bell?

137
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:31,517
Hello.

138
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:33,285
Hello.

139
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,454
- Rose, right?
- Yeah.

140
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:39,190
Come on in.

141
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:41,596
Just through here.

142
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:50,298
Would you like some tea,
soda, water?

143
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:53,173
No, I'm fine. Thank you.
I'm sorry for just stopping by.

144
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,746
No, no, not at all.
I'm glad you did.

145
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:57,748
I've wanted to talk to you
since the service.

146
00:13:57,884 --> 00:13:59,442
Uh, yeah, I know.

147
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:01,679
I wish I could've given
your wife more answers.

148
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:04,017
I know how much she wanted them.

149
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:07,149
She certainly does want her answers.
She's very focused on the matter.

150
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:09,818
But, well, it's only a matter of time.

151
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:11,827
How are you feeling?

152
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:14,626
Oh...

153
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,667
Water.
Could I have some water?

154
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:17,827
Yes, of course.

155
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,837
Please, just sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

156
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:23,271
I've been trying to figure out
how you knew Bennett.

157
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:25,342
Are you part
of Youth in Government?

158
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:28,345
Uh, no.

159
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:33,544
Ah, you must be an intern, then,
at the paper.

160
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:34,915
No.

161
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:37,512
No? Um, community service?

162
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:40,114
Just tell me if I'm hot or cold.

163
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:41,487
Cold.

164
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:43,494
Well, not East lvy.

165
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:47,155
I don't think he held on to many
of his friends from his junior high.

166
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:52,066
No, I'm the one he got pregnant.

167
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:54,834
Excuse me?

168
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:57,373
I'm pregnant.

169
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:03,881
I'm sorry. I'm...
I don't understand.

170
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,508
I'm three months pregnant.

171
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:16,122
Is it Bennett's?

172
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:21,228
Yes.

173
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:27,005
Are you sure?

174
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:30,403
Yeah.

175
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:35,578
Are you going to keep it?

176
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,817
She told me
they only spent one night together.

177
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:47,357
I just can't believe
she has nowhere else to go.

178
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,825
There must be somewhere
she can stay

179
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:50,020
until the paternity test.

180
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:53,256
Paternity test? I'm not putting
that poor girl through that.

181
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:56,060
- Why are you defending her?
- I'm not defending her.

182
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:58,226
I just don't see why she would
make something like this up.

183
00:15:58,337 --> 00:16:00,805
- Because she's 18 and broke.
- Well.

184
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:03,305
I can't deal with this.
I just can't deal with this.

185
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:06,242
Grace, Grace, Grace.
Come here. Come here.

186
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:09,143
- We don't even know this girl.
- I know.

187
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:11,807
But she seems like a nice girl.

188
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:14,476
If it turns out to be his,
I'm not gonna be happy about it.

189
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:17,818
I mean, I don't want everybody
thinking that we're blessed.

190
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:19,618
You don't think we're blessed,
do you?

191
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,454
No, I don't.

192
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,926
She's probably the one
that dyed his hair blue, too.

193
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,327
He never would have done that.

194
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:27,797
Finish making the bed.
I'm gonna go down and gather...

195
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,892
Wait, wait, wait. Why does
she have to come to our house?

196
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:32,197
We're grieving.

197
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:34,330
That's not gonna be good
for the baby.

198
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:38,068
This must be her only choice.

199
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:57,955
Are you really pregnant?

200
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:00,932
Yeah.

201
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,932
That figures.

202
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:04,525
The one bad thing my brother does,

203
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:08,164
and he's not even here
to get in trouble for it.

204
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:09,307
I'm Rose.

205
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:11,069
I know, yeah.
I know who you are.

206
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:14,442
My brother kept your yearbook photo
on his bedside table.

207
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:16,672
- He did?
- Yeah, and I wouldn't touch it,

208
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,044
because he probably
jerked off to it every night.

209
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,483
So you're his little brother.

210
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:24,623
Yeah, the fuck-up.

211
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,917
He didn't tell you that?
He didn't tell you I was a fuck-up?

212
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:30,052
No, he never said
you were fucked up.

213
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:33,528
He was just being polite then.

214
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:36,327
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

215
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:38,460
Do I not look like I'm okay?

216
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:39,866
No, you seem a little jumpy.

217
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:43,839
I'm a little restless. Yeah.

218
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,881
You have a fever.

219
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:56,113
I don't know why.
I feel fine.

220
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:58,349
- Ryan?
- Yeah?

221
00:17:58,457 --> 00:18:01,085
My mom just checked into rehab.

222
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:04,890
Bananas and Gatorade should help.

223
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,157
Yeah.

224
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:22,669
What would you say

225
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:24,402
if someone asked you
about this night?

226
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:31,746
Why do you want a compliment
from me so badly?

227
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:35,547
Because you haven't
given me anything.

228
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:38,851
I've given you everything.

229
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,722
Right, but I want more.

230
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:46,195
I want to know
what you're thinking.

231
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:48,493
Please?

232
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:52,931
I would say...

233
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:59,877
I would say...

234
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,483
The greatest?

235
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,061
I like that.

236
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,763
I like those words.

237
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:54,659
I want my baby.
He's just... He's...

238
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,960
One appliance,
less than 1,500.

239
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,594
Somebody help me
find my baby!

240
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:01,831
Somebody help me find my baby!

241
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:03,966
See, I don't know where he went.

242
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:06,704
Have you seen my baby?

243
00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:08,837
I can't find him.
I can't find him.

244
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:11,178
- Calm, calm. Shh, shh.
- He's so small.

245
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:13,751
He was right here,
and now I can't find him!

246
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:15,581
Come on, sweetheart.

247
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:40,074
My mom takes walks
every night at 6:00.

248
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:41,974
I followed her two nights ago.

249
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:44,345
She just circles the block
over and over again

250
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,610
looking for James.

251
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:46,911
Hold that thought.

252
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:49,419
Hi. You must be Ryan.

253
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:50,613
Uh-huh.

254
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,154
Come in, please.
Sit down.

255
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:57,654
We were just finishing up
with Latent.

256
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:00,823
Feel free to listen or join in,
whatever you're comfortable with.

257
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:01,990
Okay.

258
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:03,659
Sorry, Latent.

259
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:07,336
When I asked my dad
where she was the first night,

260
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:09,235
he said she was looking for James.

261
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:11,536
Sometimes she'll just run
to his bedroom

262
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:12,736
and throw open the door,

263
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:15,643
like she expects to see him sitting
at his computer or something.

264
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:19,050
Often parents
that didn't view the body,

265
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:20,641
like your mother,

266
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:23,151
still look for their child in crowds.

267
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:25,018
Sometimes they even think
they see them.

268
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,590
It's normal, Latent.

269
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:29,387
The best thing you can do
for your mother

270
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:31,360
is talk about it with her.

271
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:33,965
I think it could help.

272
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:38,334
So, Ryan, hi.

273
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:39,927
Hi.

274
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:41,538
What brings you here?

275
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:43,607
Nothin'.

276
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:46,404
I just thought it was
the normal thing to do.

277
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:49,207
Are you experiencing
any symptoms of grief?

278
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:51,942
No.

279
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:57,819
Who are you here to see?
Jordan Walker.

280
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,186
I don't know why
they can't get this right.

281
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,260
He prefers the blinds open
during the day.

282
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:05,227
Does he really?
Did he tell you that

283
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,423
after he requested
the aquarium over there?

284
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:10,934
I just wanted a little life
in this room.

285
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:17,236
Uh, decaf caramel macchiato,
extra foam.

286
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:18,206
Sheila told me.

287
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,504
If you're trying to bribe me

288
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:21,169
into feeding that fish
on the weekend,

289
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,178
it's not gonna work.

290
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:25,546
No, it's fine.
I'll be here on the weekends.

291
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:31,014
Thank you.

292
00:23:31,123 --> 00:23:32,818
You're welcome.

293
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,392
Oh, and, Toni, could you
ask Dr. Jacobson

294
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:37,223
to stop in when he gets here?

295
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:39,194
I have a few questions for him.

296
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:42,659
- Right away.
- Thank you.

297
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:45,635
- You give him the balloons, okay?
- Yeah.

298
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:48,502
Mrs. Rodriguez?
- Yes?

299
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:03,354
She's cool. It's my dad.
He thinks it's stupid.

300
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:14,031
You know, you don't have to share
if you don't want to.

301
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,997
You can just listen.

302
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:18,160
I highly recommend
not sharing, actually.

303
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,797
These people
are like grief vultures.

304
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:24,068
And why are you here?

305
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:25,734
Nowhere else to go.

306
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:27,402
And my sister Amy
blew her brains out

307
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:28,605
while we were at church.

308
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:31,616
Oh. I'm sorry.

309
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,774
What about you?

310
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:35,249
Oh, my brother, um...

311
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:37,720
He died in a car accident.

312
00:24:37,823 --> 00:24:40,417
There are a ton
of car accidents here.

313
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,687
Latent's brother was in a car.
So was Sarah's and Jason's.

314
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:45,764
Uh, Hilary's sister O.D.'d,

315
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:48,900
and Jeremy's brother died
before he was even born,

316
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:50,796
and he's, like, the most
dramatic one here.

317
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:53,235
It's like, do you even
remember him?

318
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:55,533
So, you're the only suicide?

319
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:57,268
How do you know it wasn't murder?

320
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:02,340
Because you just said
she blew her brains out.

321
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:03,709
Oh.

322
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:05,750
Yeah. Only a suicide.

323
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:08,115
Really special.

324
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,587
You know, it does get easier,
or more interesting,

325
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,853
all the different layers
of fucked-up-ness.

326
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:20,254
I'm fine.
I'm doing okay, actually. Yeah.

327
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:21,399
Well, even if you're not,

328
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,161
the groups are really good ways
to talk about it.

329
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:25,827
Your friends are gonna start
avoiding you like the plague.

330
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:27,997
I'm not even really
talking about it with them.

331
00:25:28,106 --> 00:25:29,971
Well, then I'm really glad
you're here.

332
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:23,056
Did you ever notice me at all

333
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,855
any of those times
we passed each other?

334
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:29,297
Did you at least recognize me
at some point?

335
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:31,926
Keep your eyes closed.
I'm almost done.

336
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:34,870
Okay, they're...
they're closed.

337
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:37,066
They're shut.

338
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:38,870
Good.

339
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:46,515
So, you won, like, "Most Popular"
or "Best All-Around"

340
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:50,018
or "Best Guy to Know," right?

341
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:54,819
Uh, right, yeah.
It was just "Best All-Around."

342
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:57,361
So, you're a nice guy.

343
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,623
I think so.

344
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:03,257
Is that why you're here,
because you're nice to everyone?

345
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:06,568
No.

346
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:25,212
Okay, you don't look
like the prom king anymore.

347
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:28,192
Oh, shit!

348
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:31,262
My mom's gonna kill me.

349
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:34,389
I think it suits you.

350
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:35,466
Really?

351
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:36,625
Yeah.

352
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:37,997
You sure?

353
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:39,934
Yeah.

354
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:46,641
You're so pretty, Rose.

355
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,121
Just let us know
if there's anything you can't eat.

356
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:11,259
I can only imagine how sensitive
your stomach must be right now.

357
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,032
Oh, I mostly just crave
bean burritos from Taco Bell.

358
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,165
It was peanut butter
and bananas for Grace.

359
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:18,367
- Really?
- Right?

360
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:19,466
Right.

361
00:28:19,578 --> 00:28:21,170
When Grace delivered Ryan,

362
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,645
we thought she was gonna
give birth to a banana split.

363
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,514
That was Bennett, actually.

364
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:33,516
Ryan, how are you enjoying
your summer?

365
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:34,887
Summer's over.

366
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:38,586
Right.

367
00:28:38,697 --> 00:28:42,565
Don't know why I'm having
a hard time remembering that.

368
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:45,659
Okay, here's another one.
How's school?

369
00:28:45,837 --> 00:28:47,464
It's good.

370
00:28:47,572 --> 00:28:50,063
I got all the classes I wanted.

371
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,574
Me and the guys hung out
after school, went swimming,

372
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:54,702
and we might go see a movie later.

373
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:56,575
Excellent.

374
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:58,948
Why is it "excellent"?

375
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:02,576
Well, seems like a nice way
to spend a day.

376
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:06,222
All that's missing is a bean burrito.

377
00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:19,903
I've got something for Rose.

378
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:21,505
Great. Let's see it.

379
00:29:21,673 --> 00:29:22,731
So there's this Web site

380
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:24,365
where you can take
two people's picture

381
00:29:24,476 --> 00:29:26,876
and see what their unborn kid
looks like.

382
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:29,708
I took you and Bennett's
yearbook picture.

383
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:30,905
According to them,

384
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:33,746
your kid will definitely
be riding the short bus.

385
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,046
- Ryan, that's not appropriate.
Let me see.

386
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:38,951
Oh, look. Look!

387
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:41,615
At least it sets the standards
pretty low, right?

388
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:43,055
That's enough, Ryan.
Thank you.

389
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:44,321
You'll still love him, maybe.

390
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:47,023
Look, he's got Bennett's eyes.

391
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:50,760
Anyone know if the weather's
gonna clear up for the weekend?

392
00:29:50,902 --> 00:29:53,302
Why do you do that? Why do you
always change the subject

393
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:54,804
when Bennett's name comes up?

394
00:29:54,973 --> 00:29:55,871
I don't.

395
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:57,406
Yes, you do.

396
00:29:57,576 --> 00:30:00,044
- Grace.
- You do. Watch.

397
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:01,736
Did you dye our son's hair blue?

398
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:03,712
Rose doesn't want to talk
about this at the table.

399
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:05,544
- No, l...
- Why not? I just want to know.

400
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,448
Grace, leave it alone.
Why make a point now?

401
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:10,544
I'm not making a point.
I'm asking a question.

402
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:13,487
Did you or did you not
dye our son's hair blue?

403
00:30:13,658 --> 00:30:14,590
I'm finished.

404
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:16,724
Yes.

405
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,198
You know,
when I went to the morgue,

406
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:21,458
I didn't think it was him.

407
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:23,466
I thought they got the wrong boy,

408
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:26,731
because, I mean, our son
would never dye his hair blue.

409
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:29,966
And I thought maybe
they made a mistake, and then...

410
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:33,201
I saw his face, and...

411
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:36,542
it was him, it was our son,

412
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:40,015
and he was dead... again.

413
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:43,949
It was like he died... twice.

414
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:46,819
I'm sorry.

415
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:51,188
You see, I didn't want
to make a point.

416
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:54,595
I just... wanted to ask a question.

417
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,463
I could come to your office hours,

418
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,662
if that would be easier.

419
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:03,400
No, no, don't do that, Dante.
Let's go again from the top.

420
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:07,672
I'll come back tomorrow.
I'll just make an appointment.

421
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,184
I'm fine.

422
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:18,221
I'm fine.

423
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,983
Maybe you should think
about taking a little more time off.

424
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:25,026
I can find a midterm replacement.

425
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,791
No, no. Don't do that. I'm fine.

426
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:30,129
Just haven't had my morning coffee,
that's all.

427
00:31:33,004 --> 00:31:34,631
Will you have dinner
with me tonight?

428
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:36,297
No strings attached.

429
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:40,708
We used to be good friends.
Remember?

430
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:44,839
L... I just need one night of sleep,
that's all.

431
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,078
That's my problem.
I just need one night of sleep.

432
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,814
What about the beach house?

433
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:52,856
It certainly is a wonderful place

434
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:56,257
to forget about the world
for a while.

435
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,890
Grace loves the beach house.

436
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:06,165
Right.

437
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:09,866
Well, when Rick's mother died,

438
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:12,066
I took the whole family
to Florida for two weeks.

439
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:14,407
It made a difference.

440
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:22,043
I can't talk to you anymore.
You know that.

441
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,680
I'm just trying to make sure
you're taking care of yourself.

442
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:29,854
It's not always about Grace.

443
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:32,359
Ryan, we're gonna go
to the beach house.

444
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,021
- When?
- I don't wanna hear about it.

445
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:36,566
The decision's been made.
The whole family's going.

446
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:38,965
I said, when?

447
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:42,937
Now. Today.

448
00:32:43,108 --> 00:32:45,633
- Can I bring someone?
- Yeah. Sure. Who?

449
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,472
- Ashley.
- Fine. No drugs.

450
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:51,343
Please, Dad. Why not?

451
00:32:52,117 --> 00:32:54,847
I'm serious, Ryan. Okay?
Now help your mother pack.

452
00:32:54,953 --> 00:32:57,615
Do you think she wants a sample
before we go?

453
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,365
Please, Grace.
Turn that off, would you?

454
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:12,595
I don't understand
how the car crumpled like that.

455
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,502
Maybe we should show this
to Bill again because, you know,

456
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:17,837
maybe something was wrong
with the frame of the car.

457
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:19,910
There wasn't.

458
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:22,639
And he gets out of his truck,

459
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:24,806
then he goes towards Bennett,
and he's...

460
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:26,611
It looks like he speaks to him.
I mean, why...

461
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:27,650
That's Ryan's sample.

462
00:33:27,752 --> 00:33:29,720
If you want to test it,
he'd love you to test that.

463
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:33,018
...talk to him.
And then he gives him his jacket.

464
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:37,390
Are you gonna
test the sample or not? Huh?

465
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:42,429
He was alive for 17 minutes.

466
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:45,230
Aren't you just even
the slightest bit curious

467
00:33:45,337 --> 00:33:47,202
about what happened
in those 17 minutes?

468
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:51,901
Oh, you know, maybe this is
a good time to stop the testing.

469
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:54,511
You know?
I mean, Ryan's looking good.

470
00:33:54,612 --> 00:33:58,708
Best not push it.
What do you think?

471
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:01,377
I think it's really important
to be consistent.

472
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:06,153
All right.

473
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:10,953
I was just thinking that it's
too much for you, you know.

474
00:34:11,062 --> 00:34:13,724
It's fine. I'm fine. I can do it.

475
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:28,171
You didn't take her
to the beach house, did you?

476
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:34,184
Of course not.

477
00:34:39,724 --> 00:34:42,284
# Wrapped around each other #

478
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:47,161
# Trying so hard to stay warm #

479
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:50,664
# That first cold winter together #

480
00:34:53,037 --> 00:34:56,404
# Lying in each other's arms #

481
00:34:58,343 --> 00:35:01,506
# Watching those old movies #

482
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,240
Mmm. This is a great song.

483
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:10,285
Has anybody ever made love
to this song?

484
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,990
Mom has.
She's laughing.

485
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:16,788
# You were my leading lady #

486
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:19,521
# We had it all #

487
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:24,797
# Just like Bogie and Bacall #

488
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:30,701
# Starring in our own late,
late show #

489
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:50,659
Am I sitting on his bed?

490
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:51,660
Yeah.

491
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:53,787
- It's creepy.
- Yeah.

492
00:35:56,301 --> 00:35:57,461
Did you guys get along?

493
00:35:57,635 --> 00:35:59,933
Uh... yeah.

494
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:02,470
I mean, we did
when we were little.

495
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:04,974
My mom says I used to follow him
around all the time.

496
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:06,737
He is really cute.

497
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:09,211
My mom thinks that he was
the greatest thing that ever lived,

498
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:12,477
but, uh, he actually could be
a real cocksucker

499
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,675
when he wanted to.

500
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:18,186
He won a lot of shit.

501
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:19,687
Yeah.

502
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:21,826
Yeah, he did.

503
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:24,662
You probably would have
wanted to date him.

504
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:26,990
- No.
- Yeah, you would've.

505
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:29,498
Trust me.
He had that effect on people.

506
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:31,831
I think my mom even wanted
to date him sometimes.

507
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:36,331
What about you?

508
00:36:36,474 --> 00:36:37,998
What about me?

509
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,201
Who wants to date you?

510
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,980
I don't know.

511
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,380
Uh, you, maybe?

512
00:36:49,521 --> 00:36:51,318
Maybe.

513
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:55,883
Gonna win!

514
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:59,327
Gonna beat you down there!
Then you're going in the water!

515
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,372
Hi. Grace?
Do you have a minute?

516
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:21,816
Uh, sure.

517
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:26,189
Uh, I bought a book.

518
00:37:26,324 --> 00:37:28,690
I have this baby book,

519
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:32,024
and there are so many questions
I don't know the answers to.

520
00:37:32,196 --> 00:37:35,256
And so, I was hoping you might
like to help me fill it out?

521
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:37,991
Is now a bad time?

522
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:39,831
It's fine.
What do you need?

523
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:40,836
Um...

524
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:44,133
Okay, let's see.

525
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:46,005
Uh, his name.

526
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,011
How did you come up
with Bennett's name?

527
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:50,444
Tony Bennett.

528
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:51,741
The singer?

529
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,281
Mmm.

530
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:54,941
Oh.

531
00:37:57,956 --> 00:38:00,254
I'm having a really hard time
thinking of baby names.

532
00:38:03,728 --> 00:38:06,822
Allen and I couldn't agree
on the girl's name.

533
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:09,957
I wanted Ruby, and he wanted
something more traditional.

534
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:13,595
Ruby. That's pretty.

535
00:38:13,705 --> 00:38:15,570
So, I hope that helps you out.

536
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:16,765
Do you wanna feel?

537
00:38:16,874 --> 00:38:19,240
You know, aren't you gonna go
swimming with everybody?

538
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:22,108
He always kicks
when he hears your voice. Feel.

539
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:25,046
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Please?

540
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:40,458
It's strong.

541
00:38:40,632 --> 00:38:42,600
Yeah.

542
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:45,065
Again.

543
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:52,136
I never thought I'd get pregnant.

544
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,676
I didn't even think
you could the first time.

545
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:56,508
Who has that kind of luck?

546
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:00,143
Think it was Bennett's first time?

547
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:02,684
Yeah, I think so.

548
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:12,029
It's funny, isn't it, that...

549
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,530
you're the only one
who will talk about him with me?

550
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:17,998
I'd love to, more than anything.
I have so many questions.

551
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:23,133
I think you should go swimming.

552
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,472
I'm Bennett.

553
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:28,305
It's nice to meet you, Bennett.

554
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:30,210
You too.

555
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,140
- Okay.
- Hey, wait.

556
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:37,187
- Where are you going to college?
- Barnard. You?

557
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:38,516
I thought you were going to N.Y.U.

558
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:40,784
No, I'm going to Barnard.
They gave me a scholarship.

559
00:39:40,892 --> 00:39:41,756
All right. Great.

560
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:43,724
Yeah, I'm going to Berkeley.

561
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:46,126
No scholarship... yet.

562
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:55,305
I have to go to work
'cause I'm always really late.

563
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,806
All right. Okay. Uh...

564
00:39:57,942 --> 00:39:59,807
Uh, please don't go.

565
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:02,913
It's taken me, like, a year
to get the courage to talk to you.

566
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:05,881
Please don't go.

567
00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:10,511
You've waited till 3:15
on the last day of school.

568
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:14,819
Right. Yeah.
I never said I had good timing.

569
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:17,385
I have to go to work.

570
00:40:17,562 --> 00:40:20,998
Uh, can I maybe come...
Can I come with you?

571
00:40:23,134 --> 00:40:25,261
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry. L...

572
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:27,837
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You sure?

573
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:28,735
Yeah.

574
00:41:10,381 --> 00:41:12,611
Ryan!

575
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:14,640
Ryan!

576
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,185
Ryan!

577
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:19,256
Ryan!

578
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:21,291
There's strong currents
out there! Back!

579
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:23,484
Come out of the water!

580
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:24,355
What?

581
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:26,225
Don't question me!

582
00:41:26,397 --> 00:41:28,627
Don't! Just come out
of the water! Now!

583
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,233
I know how to swim!

584
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:32,700
Goddamn it! Come out now!

585
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:35,136
Right now, and I mean it!

586
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:39,437
Do you understand me?
Come out! Please!

587
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:41,978
Goddamn it!
Come out now!

588
00:41:58,095 --> 00:41:59,084
What are you doing?

589
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:01,392
You know what I was doing.
I know how to swim.

590
00:42:01,499 --> 00:42:03,592
You know better than that.

591
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:18,309
Hey.

592
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:20,812
Oh, hi. Hi.

593
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:23,079
Hi.

594
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:24,916
Did you swim?

595
00:42:26,457 --> 00:42:27,822
Yeah. Yeah, l...

596
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:30,655
Yeah, I did. It was a...

597
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:34,424
It was good. It was good.
A bit cold, but it was good.

598
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:38,026
You okay?

599
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:41,502
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm okay.

600
00:42:41,606 --> 00:42:42,903
Just fine.

601
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:46,503
Nothing like an ocean breeze,
you know.

602
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:50,547
I know. I always wanted
to live by the ocean.

603
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:52,548
My mom thought it was
too close to the moon.

604
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,514
Oh, that's a good one.

605
00:42:53,618 --> 00:42:55,279
Doesn't make any sense.

606
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:56,375
No, not really.

607
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:59,148
You know, your mother
is more than welcome

608
00:42:59,257 --> 00:43:01,191
to come and stay with us
if she wants.

609
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:04,455
That wouldn't work.
My mom's not really sane.

610
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:07,725
Oh, I don't think that would
scare anyone in our house.

611
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:12,428
The truth is,
I haven't told her I'm pregnant.

612
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:19,201
Why not?

613
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:23,177
Because she'll... she'll tell me
I've chosen the wrong path.

614
00:43:23,314 --> 00:43:25,282
I don't wanna hear that.

615
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:28,680
I don't think you've chosen
the wrong path.

616
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:32,220
I'm not 100% sure why you chose it,
but I'm not sorry you did.

617
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:33,756
I know there are other options.

618
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:36,224
Listen, we would have
supported you either way.

619
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:37,692
I'm not against any of them.

620
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:38,852
It's... Of course not.

621
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:40,954
It's just...
I don't know.

622
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:42,054
You don't have to...

623
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,326
No, I do know.

624
00:43:43,434 --> 00:43:46,631
Come here. Come here.
You don't have to know.

625
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:48,932
You don't have to know.
It's okay.

626
00:43:49,073 --> 00:43:52,270
We can talk about this
at another time and...

627
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,470
Should we catch a movie?

628
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,053
Ryan!

629
00:44:09,393 --> 00:44:11,156
Allen!

630
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:22,801
Do you wanna see
my only party trick?

631
00:44:22,907 --> 00:44:23,532
Sure.

632
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:26,132
Okay. Hold that.

633
00:44:27,345 --> 00:44:29,006
Mm-hmm.

634
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:34,711
Look at that.

635
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:37,219
That's good.

636
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:39,255
I've never actually
done that at a party.

637
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,359
I wonder how that comes up
organically.

638
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,985
Do you have any party tricks?

639
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:48,162
Um...

640
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:51,757
I don't know if it counts,
but I never forget people's numbers.

641
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:56,202
Hmm.
I... tend to memorize numbers.

642
00:44:56,374 --> 00:44:59,468
What are my numbers?

643
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:06,278
Well, you have 18 years,
216 months, 864 weeks,

644
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:09,113
25,920 days,

645
00:45:09,286 --> 00:45:14,121
311,040 hours.

646
00:45:14,225 --> 00:45:16,420
You came to our doorstep

647
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,657
on 8-14-2008 at 4:30 p.m.

648
00:45:21,766 --> 00:45:26,135
Your due date is 2-12-2009,

649
00:45:26,303 --> 00:45:30,569
which leaves 119 more days,

650
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:33,541
2,136 hours,

651
00:45:33,677 --> 00:45:38,376
128,160 minutes.

652
00:45:40,317 --> 00:45:43,411
And you have two heartbeats.

653
00:45:44,822 --> 00:45:48,121
As I get to know you,
I'll tell you more.

654
00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:53,490
That's a much better party trick.

655
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:03,806
Price check
on register four, please.

656
00:46:11,882 --> 00:46:14,214
Jesus Christ!

657
00:46:16,387 --> 00:46:18,321
What happened?
Where's Grace?

658
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:19,946
She's fine.
She's out back, waiting.

659
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:21,649
- My son?
- He's upstairs. He's fine.

660
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:23,056
Okay.
What, exactly, happened?

661
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,923
Your wife had a difficult time
at a grocery store

662
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:26,257
and needed assistance.

663
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:27,421
- And she's out the back?
- Yes.

664
00:46:27,531 --> 00:46:30,830
All right, thank you, officer.
This is Rose.

665
00:46:37,775 --> 00:46:39,140
Are you all right?

666
00:46:39,243 --> 00:46:41,404
I called a taxi.

667
00:46:41,512 --> 00:46:42,877
Why didn't you call me?

668
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:44,810
'Cause your phone was off.

669
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,281
I'm sorry.
I was at the movies.

670
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:53,018
You went to the movies?

671
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:55,285
Yes, with Rose.

672
00:46:55,392 --> 00:46:57,758
It was nice to get out.

673
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:05,492
Well, how could you
turn your phone off?

674
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:08,729
Grace, it was only
a couple of hours.

675
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:11,773
But anything can happen
in a couple of hours. Anything.

676
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:15,909
What happened
at the grocery store?

677
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:19,245
Was it a funny movie?
I mean, did you laugh?

678
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:22,044
Or was it sad?
Did you cry?

679
00:47:22,153 --> 00:47:22,983
Ouch.

680
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:26,318
Oh, God, Allen, don't do that.
I can't stand that "ouch" thing.

681
00:47:26,423 --> 00:47:27,253
Ouch.

682
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:29,588
Really. I'm warning you.
Don't start with that.

683
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:32,093
I just wanna know what happened
at the grocery store. That's all.

684
00:47:32,196 --> 00:47:33,322
Well, I've got an idea for you.

685
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:34,829
Why don't the two of you,
you and Rose,

686
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:37,991
go off to Paris or Rome
or somewhere really romantic

687
00:47:38,102 --> 00:47:42,163
and just get a vacation
from all this death?

688
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:44,603
Hey, hey.
That's not fair.

689
00:47:44,742 --> 00:47:46,869
No, you know what's not fair?

690
00:47:47,011 --> 00:47:51,414
It's not fair that you can go
to the movies with her

691
00:47:51,515 --> 00:47:54,006
and I can't even pass
Bennett's favorite cereal.

692
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:55,675
Come on, Grace, please.

693
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:57,048
Just don't... don't do this.

694
00:47:57,154 --> 00:47:58,678
- Don't... Just don't...
- Allen, stop it.

695
00:47:58,822 --> 00:48:01,222
- Goddamn it!
- Allen!

696
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:05,729
Allen! Where are you going?

697
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:07,854
No, don't!

698
00:48:11,702 --> 00:48:14,671
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

699
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:17,365
Let me help you.
Let me help you.

700
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:27,015
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

701
00:48:27,151 --> 00:48:29,517
I'm so sorry.

702
00:48:29,653 --> 00:48:30,449
I'm sorry.

703
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:35,349
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

704
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:39,292
I'm so sorry.
I really am sorry.

705
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:45,967
I love you. I love you.

706
00:48:46,103 --> 00:48:49,163
I love you. I love you.

707
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:56,274
Grace, I love you and no one else.
Do you understand me?

708
00:49:55,773 --> 00:49:57,138
I'm sorry.

709
00:49:57,241 --> 00:49:59,266
I'm so sorry I was gone so long.

710
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:01,071
But I'm back now.

711
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:03,373
And, oh, wonderful. Look.

712
00:50:03,514 --> 00:50:06,381
They can't even follow
the simplest instructions.

713
00:50:06,517 --> 00:50:10,977
How many times have I told them
that you need the light?

714
00:50:11,088 --> 00:50:16,355
But okay. Enough of that.
Let's read our Ellison again.

715
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,553
I don't even remember
where we are.

716
00:50:18,696 --> 00:50:23,065
Is it the seventh
or the eighth chapter?

717
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,065
Let's see.

718
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:26,726
Eighth chapter.

719
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:29,896
You know, we're gonna finish
this whole summer reading list,

720
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,008
which is a first.

721
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,505
And I gotta tell you
that the high-school one

722
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:36,636
is much more boring
than the college.

723
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:39,045
Okay. Where were we?
Let's see.

724
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:41,242
"He started toward me
as in a dream,

725
00:50:41,352 --> 00:50:43,252
trembling like the needle
of one of the gauges

726
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:46,221
as he pointed toward the stairs,
his voice shrieking.

727
00:50:46,323 --> 00:50:49,520
I stared. Something seemed
to have gone wrong.

728
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:53,460
My reflexes"...

729
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:59,366
You know, Allen...
he hasn't always been like this.

730
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:03,099
I don't want you to judge him.
He's actually a very kind man.

731
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,299
And you would see that
if you met him.

732
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:11,381
He's never loved anyone less
than he should. Never.

733
00:51:13,584 --> 00:51:15,347
I want you to know that.

734
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:27,624
It's just a phase. It's a phase
that we're going through. That's all.

735
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:29,733
Just like any other.

736
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:33,428
"'What's the matter? ', I stammered,
my voice low and my"...

737
00:51:33,537 --> 00:51:34,765
He's all yours.

738
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:37,066
Wait, what's going on?
Wait a minute. What?

739
00:51:37,207 --> 00:51:39,971
- Mr. Walker's being moved.
- What? Where? Why?

740
00:51:40,077 --> 00:51:42,204
Mr. Walker has warrants
out for his arrest.

741
00:51:42,312 --> 00:51:45,247
We're taking him to County Hospital,
where there's 24-hour security.

742
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:47,010
- Must be a mistake.
- There is no mistake.

743
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:49,711
Stop it! What about all his things?
You... You...

744
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,684
He's not gonna need any
of his things where he's going.

745
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:53,848
He's gonna be so terrified
if he wakes up and doesn't have his...

746
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:55,891
What do you think this kind of man
is gonna add to your life?

747
00:51:55,993 --> 00:51:56,823
Stop it! No...

748
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:59,589
The minute he wakes up,
if he wakes up,

749
00:51:59,763 --> 00:52:01,788
he's being shipped
straight to Rikers.

750
00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:03,626
Are you gonna visit him there, too?

751
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:53,843
I think Grace might be
having an affair.

752
00:52:55,586 --> 00:52:56,917
No.

753
00:52:57,087 --> 00:52:59,851
I wouldn't blame her if she was.

754
00:53:00,023 --> 00:53:01,923
I don't think she would do that.

755
00:53:05,796 --> 00:53:07,787
I did.

756
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:11,224
I had one.

757
00:53:18,842 --> 00:53:21,037
I needed to know
that she loved me.

758
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:27,948
Our entire married life,
I've always felt like...

759
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:31,248
we were on our first date.

760
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:32,982
Hmm.

761
00:53:37,127 --> 00:53:39,493
I never deserved her.

762
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,059
Never.

763
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:49,896
Do you want to go
to a party with me?

764
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:54,605
There's three kegs.

765
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:06,019
- I don't think I'm dressed for this.
- Oh, don't worry.

766
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:09,092
These people are
pretty nonjudgmental.

767
00:54:12,596 --> 00:54:14,928
Oh, my God! You're huge!

768
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:19,031
I didn't think it was possible
for you to stretch like that.

769
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:21,763
Shea, this is Allen.
Allen, this is Shea.

770
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:22,839
Hi. How are you?

771
00:54:23,006 --> 00:54:24,735
Hi. Nice to meet you.

772
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:26,604
Wait. You guys did realize
this was

773
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:29,873
a "Wear Something You'd Never
Be Caught Dead In" party, right?

774
00:54:30,013 --> 00:54:32,880
No. But I'm wearing Grace's
old maternity clothes,

775
00:54:32,983 --> 00:54:34,211
so that kinda works out.

776
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:36,286
- And you?
- This is it.

777
00:54:37,554 --> 00:54:39,784
Well, you're actually
kind of perfect, so...

778
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:41,016
Come on in.

779
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:43,022
Come in.

780
00:54:43,193 --> 00:54:45,559
- Yeah, man!
- Oh, boy.

781
00:54:45,662 --> 00:54:48,062
- Right on.
- Oh...

782
00:54:48,265 --> 00:54:49,357
Hey, hey.

783
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:54,401
I wouldn't be caught dead naked!

784
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:56,266
Yeah!

785
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:01,307
Hey, um, are you a pregnant teen
or something?

786
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:03,436
Yeah, I am.

787
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:05,548
Do you live under a freeway

788
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:07,378
and are gonna have
a homeless baby

789
00:55:07,484 --> 00:55:09,782
and use it to raise more money?

790
00:55:09,953 --> 00:55:12,046
No, I'm just a regular
pregnant teen.

791
00:55:12,155 --> 00:55:14,248
Oh. Right on!

792
00:55:14,358 --> 00:55:17,225
I wouldn't be caught dead
having a baby!

793
00:55:19,162 --> 00:55:22,256
Hey, is it okay if I just
come a little closer?

794
00:55:22,432 --> 00:55:25,697
Sit next to you guys for a second?
I just... I gotta tell you something.

795
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:34,808
Dude, I'm on acid.

796
00:55:34,978 --> 00:55:37,378
I'm trippin', y'all.

797
00:55:37,514 --> 00:55:39,778
That's the way
Britney Spears would say it.

798
00:55:39,883 --> 00:55:41,612
She'd be like,
"I'm trippin', y'all."

799
00:55:42,753 --> 00:55:43,811
- We can go somewhere else.
- Yeah.

800
00:55:43,987 --> 00:55:45,648
No, wait, wait.
Dude, wait. Stay.

801
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:48,316
Say something familiar, man, please.
Just say something familiar.

802
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:49,948
I'm just seeing too many ghosts.

803
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,595
I don't know.
French fries.

804
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:58,132
Yeah!

805
00:55:58,301 --> 00:56:01,600
- Mr. Bubble.
- Yeah.

806
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,798
Monkeys.

807
00:56:06,076 --> 00:56:08,977
The ones that rip your balls off
for not sharing birthday cake,

808
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:10,376
or the nice ones?

809
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:12,344
No. The nice ones.

810
00:56:12,482 --> 00:56:14,143
Yeah!

811
00:56:28,365 --> 00:56:29,730
What... That's...

812
00:56:32,703 --> 00:56:33,601
"Go, baby, go."

813
00:56:34,738 --> 00:56:36,706
Yeah!
Let's go.

814
00:56:36,873 --> 00:56:38,033
All right. Let's go.

815
00:56:39,209 --> 00:56:41,837
Bye.

816
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:43,513
What'd you do?

817
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:45,774
People signed my belly.

818
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:46,610
Oh.

819
00:56:46,717 --> 00:56:49,049
It seemed sweet at the time.

820
00:56:49,186 --> 00:56:53,145
"Have a great summer.
Good luck with the new kid."

821
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:58,492
I was never into yearbooks.
Do you want to sign?

822
00:56:58,662 --> 00:57:01,961
Um... all right.

823
00:57:21,752 --> 00:57:23,344
Don't you think it might
just be easier

824
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,920
if you talked about it with Grace?

825
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:33,987
Floodgates.

826
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:38,564
I don't know what I'd do
if they opened.

827
00:57:40,704 --> 00:57:45,471
I'll talk about someone,
but it'll really be him.

828
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:47,542
Why would you do that?

829
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:50,305
Because there are things
I need to tell you.

830
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:54,644
Okay.

831
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:56,241
Okay.

832
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,221
I knew this boy.

833
00:58:00,357 --> 00:58:02,587
He was really wonderful to me.

834
00:58:02,759 --> 00:58:04,386
Is that okay?

835
00:58:05,228 --> 00:58:07,219
Yes.

836
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:11,790
The first time I saw him
was in freshman English.

837
00:58:11,935 --> 00:58:14,631
He wore a baseball hat
on the first day of school,

838
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:16,739
and our teacher made him
take it off.

839
00:58:16,907 --> 00:58:21,173
And his hair was all pasted
on top of his head.

840
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,779
And he smiled at me
while he tried to fix it.

841
00:58:23,947 --> 00:58:27,508
We watched each other after that.

842
00:58:27,617 --> 00:58:31,053
And I started to feel
like I knew him.

843
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:33,122
I looked at his
yearbook picture so often,

844
00:58:33,223 --> 00:58:35,919
I knew his face by heart.

845
00:58:36,026 --> 00:58:39,086
Our senior year, I took piano,

846
00:58:39,229 --> 00:58:41,094
and he had soccer,

847
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:43,791
so we would pass each other
every day after school

848
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:47,426
in the exact same spot.

849
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:52,005
And it became something
I looked forward to,

850
00:58:52,175 --> 00:58:54,666
so much so that I could tell you
all the days he was absent,

851
00:58:54,778 --> 00:58:57,406
because those were the days
that I was disappointed.

852
00:58:57,514 --> 00:58:59,641
And sometimes
he would look at me.

853
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:04,480
Sometimes he would turn away.

854
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:07,751
And sometimes
it would be so intense

855
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:09,416
that we would start looking
at each other

856
00:59:09,526 --> 00:59:13,257
from the very beginning
of the steps.

857
00:59:14,464 --> 00:59:17,297
And then on the last day,

858
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,994
he talked to me.

859
00:59:20,904 --> 00:59:25,932
And everything he said was exactly
how I pictured it would be.

860
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:30,245
And he felt the way he felt
in my dreams,

861
00:59:30,347 --> 00:59:33,145
and I thought everything
was happening

862
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:37,277
exactly the way
it was supposed to.

863
00:59:39,422 --> 00:59:41,549
And I was the happiest
I've ever been...

864
00:59:41,658 --> 00:59:45,492
happy and scared
all at the same time.

865
00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:48,391
And if he had signed my belly,

866
00:59:48,498 --> 00:59:50,193
he would have written
something comforting.

867
00:59:57,707 --> 01:00:01,006
That's one of the most
difficult integrals

868
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:04,137
I've ever solved.

869
01:00:05,115 --> 01:00:08,482
Took me three years to do it.

870
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:12,645
And I was in love with him.

871
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:18,386
That's why I'm keeping this baby.

872
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:22,520
I was in love with him
for four years.

873
01:00:23,967 --> 01:00:26,367
I barely knew him,

874
01:00:26,503 --> 01:00:30,234
but everything
was exactly how I imagined it.

875
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:35,368
Everything was
just how I pictured it.

876
01:00:35,545 --> 01:00:38,241
And I have to keep this baby.

877
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:44,016
I think he was the love of my life.

878
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,815
I'm very tired.

879
01:01:16,987 --> 01:01:20,423
I can't fight it anymore.

880
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:27,086
I'm so tired.

881
01:02:14,911 --> 01:02:17,937
My mom says it's cool.
Yeah.

882
01:02:19,883 --> 01:02:21,851
That was a good story.

883
01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:23,247
Thanks.

884
01:02:23,353 --> 01:02:25,218
No, I mean... I don't...
I don't mean it that way.

885
01:02:25,321 --> 01:02:26,982
I mean, it was good to hear.

886
01:02:27,123 --> 01:02:30,388
Not good for you,
but good for me, I guess.

887
01:02:31,461 --> 01:02:33,952
So what was
your brother's funeral like?

888
01:02:34,064 --> 01:02:35,759
I don't remember.

889
01:02:35,865 --> 01:02:36,889
It's all just a blur?

890
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,697
No, I really don't remember.
I was too fucked up.

891
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:42,828
I didn't know you get high.

892
01:02:42,972 --> 01:02:44,496
I don't.

893
01:02:44,607 --> 01:02:46,734
My mom tests me every two weeks.

894
01:02:46,843 --> 01:02:48,743
It's pretty much
the only thing they do

895
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:51,507
that proves they know I'm alive.

896
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:54,583
Need a ride home?

897
01:02:54,684 --> 01:02:55,673
Yeah, sure.

898
01:02:58,555 --> 01:03:00,386
Baby is head down,

899
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:03,948
which means
you're getting very close.

900
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,119
How are you feeling,
Mr. Brewer?

901
01:03:07,297 --> 01:03:10,596
You look like
you could use some rest.

902
01:03:10,733 --> 01:03:13,793
Oh, I'm fine.
Thank you.

903
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:16,467
How's the baby?

904
01:03:16,606 --> 01:03:19,575
Just where we want her
to be right now.

905
01:03:19,676 --> 01:03:20,734
It's a girl?

906
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:23,037
I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.

907
01:03:23,213 --> 01:03:24,703
It's a girl?

908
01:03:24,881 --> 01:03:27,145
Oh, congratulations.

909
01:03:28,184 --> 01:03:29,947
Is she healthy?

910
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,213
Doesn't get any stronger
than that heartbeat.

911
01:03:32,355 --> 01:03:34,585
You've taken
really good care of her.

912
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:36,054
Oh, this is wonderful.

913
01:03:38,128 --> 01:03:42,656
This is wonderful.
Wonderful.

914
01:03:42,832 --> 01:03:45,733
Excuse me.

915
01:03:45,835 --> 01:03:48,235
It's wonderful.

916
01:03:48,371 --> 01:03:50,703
Okay. I'll be right back.

917
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,400
A girl.
A girl. Okay.

918
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:07,923
What is wrong with you?

919
01:04:08,057 --> 01:04:09,456
I just need a minute.

920
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:11,789
So, take a minute.
I'm going back in.

921
01:04:11,895 --> 01:04:13,294
No.

922
01:04:14,264 --> 01:04:18,860
I don't want this baby, Allen.
I don't care if I sound horrible.

923
01:04:19,002 --> 01:04:20,162
You sound horrible.

924
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:22,670
If Bennett were alive,
she never would have kept it.

925
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:24,569
- I can't be grateful to her.
- You don't have to be.

926
01:04:24,674 --> 01:04:25,470
- I won't.
- Fine.

927
01:04:25,575 --> 01:04:27,008
- I won't do it. I won't.
- Don't. Don't.

928
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:30,409
Don't do anything.
I don't care anymore.

929
01:04:30,513 --> 01:04:33,004
Don't I have the right
to tell you how I'm feeling?

930
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:37,344
Not when everything you say
is sounding so ugly.

931
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,044
You're right.
Losing a child is ugly.

932
01:04:39,155 --> 01:04:41,020
You don't have a patent on grief.

933
01:04:41,124 --> 01:04:42,853
You're not the only one
who knows how to do it.

934
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:44,824
- Other people grieve.
- You don't.

935
01:04:44,928 --> 01:04:46,725
- You haven't shed a tear once.
- I'm gonna go back in.

936
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:48,763
You used to get misty when
you would go to his sports events.

937
01:04:48,865 --> 01:04:50,662
Listen. Somebody has to
stand strong in this family.

938
01:04:50,767 --> 01:04:52,166
Somebody has to be together.

939
01:04:52,335 --> 01:04:54,462
If I fall apart, everything
goes to hell in a handbasket.

940
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:57,233
Well, I am so sorry that I can't
handle anything but my grief,

941
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,535
and I don't treat this family
like a goddamn army.

942
01:04:59,642 --> 01:05:02,110
It's not all about you
and your grief, Grace.

943
01:05:02,245 --> 01:05:05,408
There are people in our lives
who need our attention.

944
01:05:05,582 --> 01:05:08,244
Well, you don't give a puppy
to someone who's just lost their dog.

945
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,648
You just don't do that.

946
01:05:09,752 --> 01:05:12,243
So what do we do?
Give her back? Hmm?

947
01:05:12,355 --> 01:05:13,913
Give her 20 bucks?
Wish her luck?

948
01:05:14,023 --> 01:05:16,548
Don't praise her like she's a gift
that was given to us,

949
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:18,991
like it makes it okay
that our son is gone.

950
01:05:19,128 --> 01:05:20,755
It doesn't soften the blow.

951
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,329
She does for me.

952
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:26,526
Yeah.

953
01:05:26,703 --> 01:05:28,295
Oh, well, I'm so glad for you.

954
01:05:28,404 --> 01:05:31,931
I'm so glad that the girl that is
the reason our son is dead

955
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:33,668
softens the blow for you.

956
01:05:33,843 --> 01:05:34,867
That's unfair.

957
01:05:34,978 --> 01:05:37,344
What was he doing
in the middle of the road?

958
01:05:37,513 --> 01:05:39,242
If he'd been with his friends,
if he'd been with us,

959
01:05:39,382 --> 01:05:41,077
would he have been
in the middle of the road?

960
01:05:41,184 --> 01:05:42,048
Answer me that.

961
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:43,709
You don't know anything about it.

962
01:05:43,886 --> 01:05:47,322
You haven't made the slightest
effort to get to know this girl.

963
01:05:47,457 --> 01:05:49,925
I don't want to get to know her.
Why can't you understand that?

964
01:05:50,026 --> 01:05:51,653
It should have been her
that died that night.

965
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:52,750
It should have been her!

966
01:06:23,459 --> 01:06:25,086
Hello?

967
01:06:26,162 --> 01:06:28,221
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

968
01:06:28,331 --> 01:06:31,823
Yeah. Ashley left
this scarf in my car.

969
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:34,765
Um, who are you?

970
01:06:34,937 --> 01:06:37,565
I'm Amy. I live here.

971
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,766
- Amy.
- Yeah.

972
01:06:42,378 --> 01:06:45,677
Ashley's older sister Amy?

973
01:06:47,817 --> 01:06:51,275
What'd she tell you?
I grabbed a live wire?

974
01:06:51,387 --> 01:06:53,582
Fell overboard
on our family cruise?

975
01:06:53,756 --> 01:06:55,155
What'd you tell him this time,
you freak?

976
01:06:55,258 --> 01:06:56,350
- Ryan...
- I'm telling Mom.

977
01:06:56,459 --> 01:06:57,585
- I hate you!
- Freak.

978
01:06:57,694 --> 01:07:00,857
Ryan! Ryan, please.
Wait. I can explain.

979
01:07:00,963 --> 01:07:02,760
- Ryan, please just listen to me!
- Uh-uh.

980
01:07:02,865 --> 01:07:04,765
Look. They don't pay
any attention to me in there.

981
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:06,994
- I might as well be dead.
- You have no idea what it's like.

982
01:07:07,136 --> 01:07:09,331
- Yes, I do. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- No, you don't. No, you don't.

983
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,202
You're a liar!
That's what you are!

984
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:12,706
Look, it's all bad! Trust me!

985
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:15,141
You have no idea what it's like!

986
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:18,474
Say it! Say you have no idea
what it's like.

987
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:22,777
I have no idea.

988
01:07:22,885 --> 01:07:24,147
Open the gate.

989
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:25,584
Open the fucking gate!

990
01:07:25,688 --> 01:07:28,054
Ryan, look, please. I'm sorry.
I just wanted you to like me.

991
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:29,885
Fuck you!

992
01:07:34,163 --> 01:07:35,790
Hello?

993
01:07:38,835 --> 01:07:40,393
Hello?

994
01:08:17,707 --> 01:08:22,974
# Wanderers this morning came by #

995
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:24,103
# Where did they go? #

996
01:08:24,213 --> 01:08:27,114
- What have you done?
- I called Gloria.

997
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,808
You said we were
gonna talk about it!

998
01:08:28,918 --> 01:08:30,852
I couldn't live with the house
so neglected.

999
01:08:30,953 --> 01:08:33,513
Now, come on.
Please. Hey!

1000
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:35,054
- Idiot!
- What is wrong with you, Grace?

1001
01:08:35,158 --> 01:08:36,523
- How could you do this?
- Come here a second.

1002
01:08:36,626 --> 01:08:37,888
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.
What is this?

1003
01:08:37,994 --> 01:08:38,858
Hey! Grace.

1004
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:41,259
- You washed his shirt?
- Yeah.

1005
01:08:41,364 --> 01:08:43,457
- You're fired! Get out of here!
- Don't do this! Grace!

1006
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:44,931
What are you doing?
Stop it!

1007
01:08:45,034 --> 01:08:45,693
I'm sorry.

1008
01:08:45,802 --> 01:08:47,497
Grace.

1009
01:08:47,603 --> 01:08:49,833
You've erased him.
You did it on purpose.

1010
01:08:49,939 --> 01:08:51,497
What are you doing?
You're acting like a child.

1011
01:08:51,607 --> 01:08:52,835
I've done nothing like that at all.

1012
01:08:52,942 --> 01:08:56,503
I wanted to be able to see
his pictures and to smell him

1013
01:08:56,612 --> 01:08:57,704
now that he's gone.

1014
01:08:57,814 --> 01:08:59,076
Grace, he's here.

1015
01:08:59,248 --> 01:09:01,045
He isn't here!
He's dead! He's gone!

1016
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:02,845
I know that, goddamn it!

1017
01:09:02,952 --> 01:09:04,180
Don't you...
Don't...

1018
01:09:04,287 --> 01:09:06,812
There's nothing to hold on to!
Don't you understand that?

1019
01:09:07,023 --> 01:09:10,618
Just shed one tear.

1020
01:09:10,726 --> 01:09:15,129
I mean, what is wrong with you?
Can't you just cry one tear?

1021
01:09:15,398 --> 01:09:18,561
# Dear shadow alive and well #

1022
01:09:20,503 --> 01:09:23,734
# How can the body die? #

1023
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:28,640
# You tell me everything #

1024
01:09:28,744 --> 01:09:29,836
# Anything #

1025
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,648
Allen? Allen?

1026
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:37,284
Allen? I'm s... I'm sorry.

1027
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:42,149
# Into town one morning I went #

1028
01:09:42,258 --> 01:09:43,953
Oh, my God, Allen.

1029
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:49,225
# Staggering through
premonitions of my death #

1030
01:09:49,332 --> 01:09:52,062
# I don't see #

1031
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:54,693
Mrs. Brewer?

1032
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,045
He had all the symptoms
of a heart attack...

1033
01:10:06,215 --> 01:10:08,115
difficulty breathing,
tightness in his chest,

1034
01:10:08,251 --> 01:10:10,947
heartbeat changes, dizziness.

1035
01:10:11,053 --> 01:10:12,281
But it wasn't a heart attack?

1036
01:10:12,388 --> 01:10:15,289
Not as far as we can tell.
His E.K.G. Looks normal.

1037
01:10:15,391 --> 01:10:16,358
What was it?

1038
01:10:16,459 --> 01:10:18,950
Well, his body's under an incredible
amount of stress, Mrs. Brewer.

1039
01:10:19,061 --> 01:10:20,494
He has high blood pressure.

1040
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:22,496
His sinuses have led
to an ear infection.

1041
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:24,998
He's suffering
from extreme sleep deprivation.

1042
01:10:25,134 --> 01:10:27,125
But it was not a heart attack.

1043
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:29,067
Sometimes patients
manifest real symptoms

1044
01:10:29,171 --> 01:10:33,608
because it's easier to feel
physical pain than emotional.

1045
01:10:56,332 --> 01:10:58,562
Ryan. I wasn't expecting you.

1046
01:10:59,535 --> 01:11:01,594
Can I share?

1047
01:11:01,737 --> 01:11:03,261
My... My, uh, story.

1048
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:05,602
My whatever... whatever it is
you people do here.

1049
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:07,436
- Yes, of course.
- Okay.

1050
01:11:07,577 --> 01:11:09,772
Um, where do I start?
Where do you want me to start?

1051
01:11:09,946 --> 01:11:11,470
- You start wherever you like.
- Okay.

1052
01:11:11,581 --> 01:11:13,276
Can I say my brother's an asshole?

1053
01:11:13,382 --> 01:11:14,940
You can say whatever you want.

1054
01:11:15,051 --> 01:11:17,178
Okay. My brother
is an asshole, right?

1055
01:11:17,286 --> 01:11:19,846
And now he's some fuckin'
martyr god now that he's dead.

1056
01:11:19,989 --> 01:11:22,457
He's dead, by the way.
He's... He's dead, right?

1057
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:25,059
Did you not get a chance
to see the body?

1058
01:11:25,227 --> 01:11:27,821
I, um...
No, I was too fucked up.

1059
01:11:27,964 --> 01:11:30,091
My mom came in to get me,
and I couldn't even move.

1060
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:33,566
I couldn't move my head.
So I didn't get to say good-bye.

1061
01:11:33,703 --> 01:11:35,830
I just, uh, laid there in my bed

1062
01:11:35,938 --> 01:11:37,701
thinking about all the attention
he was gonna get

1063
01:11:37,807 --> 01:11:38,796
whenever he came home,

1064
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:41,535
and how all of his stupid friends
were gonna sign his cast

1065
01:11:41,677 --> 01:11:44,908
and how he'd probably get
a pity lay out of it.

1066
01:11:45,014 --> 01:11:49,678
So, um, I didn't get to say good-bye.

1067
01:11:49,785 --> 01:11:53,482
And now... You know,
the thing was about Bennett...

1068
01:11:53,656 --> 01:11:55,817
Um...

1069
01:11:55,925 --> 01:11:59,986
The thing was, he, um...

1070
01:12:06,402 --> 01:12:07,835
He...

1071
01:12:09,071 --> 01:12:11,904
He was never an asshole.

1072
01:12:14,343 --> 01:12:17,676
He was actually really cool to me.

1073
01:12:19,281 --> 01:12:21,476
And he could have ratted me out,
like, a thousand times,

1074
01:12:21,584 --> 01:12:24,314
and he never did.

1075
01:12:24,553 --> 01:12:27,147
Me and him used to do
all kinds of fun shit together,

1076
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:30,918
and the truth is,
I wanted to be just like him.

1077
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:34,188
I loved him more than anything.

1078
01:12:36,499 --> 01:12:41,459
And I was too fucked up
to say good-bye.

1079
01:12:42,938 --> 01:12:45,566
And in the end,
that's all I ever gave him,

1080
01:12:45,675 --> 01:12:47,575
was nothing.

1081
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:51,407
Do you know how that feels
to have your one shot

1082
01:12:51,547 --> 01:12:54,846
and fuckin' just blow it?

1083
01:12:55,418 --> 01:12:59,752
It's gone. I'll never get
that chance again.

1084
01:13:02,858 --> 01:13:05,850
I just miss him so much.

1085
01:13:24,246 --> 01:13:26,874
- Hey, Mrs. Brewer.
- He woke up.

1086
01:13:27,049 --> 01:13:29,176
Yesterday morning.

1087
01:13:29,351 --> 01:13:32,218
Nobody called me.
Is he all right?

1088
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:33,515
He seems okay.

1089
01:13:33,622 --> 01:13:36,591
He's getting transferred over
to Rikers in about 10 minutes.

1090
01:13:36,692 --> 01:13:38,626
Can I talk to him?

1091
01:13:38,728 --> 01:13:40,889
Make it quick.

1092
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:50,527
Hello.

1093
01:13:52,775 --> 01:13:55,141
I'm Grace.

1094
01:13:55,244 --> 01:13:57,712
Brewer.

1095
01:13:57,813 --> 01:13:59,644
Bennett's mother.

1096
01:13:59,749 --> 01:14:02,081
The boy in the car.

1097
01:14:04,887 --> 01:14:06,445
So?

1098
01:14:06,622 --> 01:14:09,386
So, you were the last person
to see my son alive.

1099
01:14:09,492 --> 01:14:12,928
Yeah, well, I had the green.
I'm gonna sue your whole family.

1100
01:14:13,095 --> 01:14:14,892
You remember?

1101
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,062
Um...

1102
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:22,660
Are you feeling better?

1103
01:14:22,772 --> 01:14:26,799
Does it look like
I'm feeling fuckin' better? Huh?

1104
01:14:26,909 --> 01:14:28,740
Uh... Um...

1105
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:32,675
I saw the surveillance video,

1106
01:14:32,815 --> 01:14:35,181
and it looks like
you spoke to my son,

1107
01:14:35,284 --> 01:14:39,015
like you comforted him
after the accident?

1108
01:14:39,155 --> 01:14:41,123
I didn't comfort anybody.
Okay?

1109
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:46,126
Now, I got some other shit
on my mind, if you didn't notice.

1110
01:14:46,228 --> 01:14:49,686
Do you remember
if he was in pain?

1111
01:14:49,799 --> 01:14:51,767
I'm not doing this, lady.

1112
01:14:51,901 --> 01:14:54,699
I have waited a very long time
to talk to you. Please.

1113
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:56,601
- Just go. Get out.
- No, please. I can't.

1114
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:59,936
- Get out!
- I can't.

1115
01:15:01,277 --> 01:15:04,940
He didn't die a hero or anything,
if that's what you want to hear.

1116
01:15:05,114 --> 01:15:06,638
It isn't.

1117
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:17,385
I don't know.

1118
01:15:17,493 --> 01:15:21,395
It happened.
It happened fast.

1119
01:15:21,497 --> 01:15:23,965
He asked me if it was his fault.

1120
01:15:24,133 --> 01:15:26,101
And then you told him
that it wasn't?

1121
01:15:26,202 --> 01:15:29,535
I told him not to worry about it.

1122
01:15:29,672 --> 01:15:30,969
And what else?

1123
01:15:32,808 --> 01:15:34,867
You really want
to know this, lady?

1124
01:15:34,977 --> 01:15:37,104
More than anything.

1125
01:15:40,683 --> 01:15:46,622
His body was caught in between
the front end of my truck

1126
01:15:46,722 --> 01:15:49,885
and his door.

1127
01:15:50,025 --> 01:15:53,620
There was so much crushed metal...
I don't know.

1128
01:15:53,729 --> 01:15:58,063
Maybe it was
holding him together.

1129
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,462
I didn't want to move him.

1130
01:15:59,568 --> 01:16:03,129
I don't think I could
even if I tried. Uh...

1131
01:16:04,573 --> 01:16:08,475
His right arm
was so... far behind his body,

1132
01:16:08,577 --> 01:16:11,876
it looked like
it wasn't even attached.

1133
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:16,448
I never seen anything like it.

1134
01:16:16,585 --> 01:16:19,452
And I had to climb out
over the top of my truck, uh,

1135
01:16:19,555 --> 01:16:21,546
just to get to him.

1136
01:16:23,592 --> 01:16:25,184
I don't think he was in pain.

1137
01:16:25,294 --> 01:16:29,162
I just, uh, think he was cold.

1138
01:16:29,265 --> 01:16:31,460
And then you gave him your jacket?

1139
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,160
Yeah, but it didn't make it
any better.

1140
01:16:34,336 --> 01:16:35,803
It was, um...

1141
01:16:35,905 --> 01:16:39,363
The... blood...

1142
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:41,670
The blood was making him cold.

1143
01:16:42,244 --> 01:16:43,734
How much blood?

1144
01:16:46,715 --> 01:16:48,376
How much?

1145
01:16:48,484 --> 01:16:53,353
More than, uh, I've ever seen.

1146
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,615
Was he scared?

1147
01:16:59,962 --> 01:17:01,623
Uh, I don't know.

1148
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:06,394
I mean, there was, uh...
fluid everywhere, but...

1149
01:17:06,568 --> 01:17:08,559
A bunch of stuff coming out
of him, you know?

1150
01:17:09,872 --> 01:17:11,601
Uh...

1151
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:14,903
He might have been crying,
I guess. I don't know.

1152
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,672
Was he crying
because he was in pain,

1153
01:17:17,813 --> 01:17:20,338
or was he crying
because he was scared?

1154
01:17:20,482 --> 01:17:23,110
- What's the difference?
- Which one was it?

1155
01:17:23,285 --> 01:17:25,446
Scared, I guess.

1156
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:31,988
Do you think
he knew he was dying?

1157
01:17:32,127 --> 01:17:34,857
Did he know he was dying?

1158
01:17:34,964 --> 01:17:37,592
He knew it was bad,

1159
01:17:37,733 --> 01:17:40,497
but it's not like we were talking
about God or anything.

1160
01:17:40,636 --> 01:17:43,764
I just told him,
"You listen for those sirens.

1161
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:47,932
Once you hear the siren,
everything will be all right."

1162
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:51,273
Oh, God.

1163
01:17:51,413 --> 01:17:53,278
He needed me,
and I wasn't there.

1164
01:17:53,415 --> 01:17:56,873
I should have been there
to make sure that he wasn't afraid

1165
01:17:57,019 --> 01:18:00,420
and tell him that I loved him
and hold him and...

1166
01:18:00,522 --> 01:18:01,511
Hey, hey, hey.

1167
01:18:03,025 --> 01:18:05,152
Hey.

1168
01:18:05,327 --> 01:18:09,354
Hey, hey, uh, you want some,
uh, water or something?

1169
01:18:09,498 --> 01:18:11,898
He needed me,
and he called out for me,

1170
01:18:12,001 --> 01:18:13,366
and I wasn't even there.

1171
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:16,098
Oh, he didn't call for you.

1172
01:18:16,271 --> 01:18:18,501
He called out for her
over and over again.

1173
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,473
That, uh, girl in his car.

1174
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:25,012
Rose?

1175
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:27,148
Rose. All he cared about
was Rose...

1176
01:18:27,249 --> 01:18:29,376
if she was hurt,
if she was in pain,

1177
01:18:29,485 --> 01:18:31,282
if she was asking for him.

1178
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:32,819
He kept telling me
over and over again,

1179
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:34,946
"You've got to help her.
You should be taking care of her."

1180
01:18:35,057 --> 01:18:39,221
But, uh, I thought she was dead.

1181
01:18:39,395 --> 01:18:40,623
He asked for Rose.

1182
01:18:40,729 --> 01:18:43,220
He even asked me
to turn up the radio.

1183
01:18:43,332 --> 01:18:45,960
This poor kid, he's got blood
coming out of his ears.

1184
01:18:46,135 --> 01:18:48,729
He wanted her to hear
this song that was playing.

1185
01:18:48,837 --> 01:18:53,501
He thought she might like to hear it.

1186
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:56,578
I have to go.

1187
01:19:07,222 --> 01:19:11,158
Relax. You can stay here
as long as you want.

1188
01:19:11,326 --> 01:19:15,854
And, Rose, I've called my mom
from women's correctional facilities.

1189
01:19:15,964 --> 01:19:18,990
This is, like, tiny, I swear.

1190
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:26,164
Hi. Lydia?

1191
01:19:26,308 --> 01:19:28,003
Yeah. Hi.
Uh, this is Shea.

1192
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:29,702
I'm Rose's friend from work.

1193
01:19:29,812 --> 01:19:31,177
Tell her I'm okay.

1194
01:19:31,346 --> 01:19:32,574
Rose is absolutely fine,

1195
01:19:32,681 --> 01:19:36,708
and, um, she actually wants me
to tell you something which...

1196
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:39,652
Okay. Well, we're not gonna need
a lot of your time, so...

1197
01:19:40,689 --> 01:19:42,589
Oh, l... I didn't know.

1198
01:19:43,759 --> 01:19:45,784
Um, she lost her job?

1199
01:19:45,961 --> 01:19:47,519
Ah.

1200
01:19:47,663 --> 01:19:50,689
And she only has 15 minutes left
on the phone.

1201
01:19:51,934 --> 01:19:54,630
Um, I'm really sorry
to hear about all that,

1202
01:19:54,736 --> 01:19:58,137
but, uh, Rose wants me
to tell you something,

1203
01:19:58,307 --> 01:20:01,071
which is that she is pregnant.

1204
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:07,980
Yay! Um, I'd say just like
three or four months.

1205
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:09,674
Yeah.
Oh, she's keeping it.

1206
01:20:09,785 --> 01:20:13,084
She put off Barnard for a year,
and, um...

1207
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:16,419
Yeah. She's just, like,
handling it like a total Republican.

1208
01:20:16,592 --> 01:20:20,619
And, um, she wants you to know
that she is not at all scared.

1209
01:20:20,796 --> 01:20:24,288
And, uh, she's getting support
from the father's family and...

1210
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:26,458
Um, I don't know.

1211
01:20:26,602 --> 01:20:29,833
I guess just whatever she needs.

1212
01:20:29,938 --> 01:20:30,802
Okay.

1213
01:20:30,973 --> 01:20:32,964
Um, she wants me
to ask you something.

1214
01:20:35,277 --> 01:20:39,145
Tell her it's okay
if she wants to come here.

1215
01:20:39,248 --> 01:20:40,806
Tell her it's fine.

1216
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:43,146
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1217
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:45,752
Uh...

1218
01:20:49,324 --> 01:20:51,258
What?

1219
01:20:52,094 --> 01:20:56,258
Um, she wants you to ask
for 10,000 up front.

1220
01:20:56,398 --> 01:20:59,561
She says that she'll come help you
if you can get the 10,000 now,

1221
01:20:59,668 --> 01:21:03,502
'cause, um, well, she thinks
it's what you'll need.

1222
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:16,945
She seemed, like, really glad
to hear that you were doing okay.

1223
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:18,917
That's fine.

1224
01:21:50,552 --> 01:21:53,146
Doctor said you could go?

1225
01:21:53,288 --> 01:21:54,949
Yeah.

1226
01:21:55,057 --> 01:21:56,490
Good.

1227
01:21:59,494 --> 01:22:01,689
You talked with Jordan Walker,
didn't you?

1228
01:22:05,434 --> 01:22:06,332
Yes.

1229
01:22:08,103 --> 01:22:09,832
What did you learn?

1230
01:22:17,946 --> 01:22:19,573
Bennett loved her, didn't he?

1231
01:22:28,624 --> 01:22:32,060
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

1232
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:36,789
I wanted him to call for me.

1233
01:22:36,932 --> 01:22:39,162
Is that such a terrible thing?

1234
01:22:39,268 --> 01:22:42,726
I call for you.

1235
01:22:43,605 --> 01:22:47,473
I call for you every day.

1236
01:22:48,777 --> 01:22:51,473
I'm here now.

1237
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:54,447
Oh, my God.

1238
01:22:54,616 --> 01:22:55,446
Poor baby.

1239
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:59,748
- Oh, my God, my poor boy.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1240
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:02,221
Oh, my poor, poor, poor,
poor boy.

1241
01:23:02,357 --> 01:23:04,222
Okay. It's all right.

1242
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:05,587
It's okay.

1243
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:08,860
Yes, it's okay.
All right.

1244
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:12,526
Yes. It's all right.

1245
01:23:14,836 --> 01:23:18,704
I know. I know.
I know. I know.

1246
01:23:18,807 --> 01:23:20,968
It's okay. It's okay.
That's it.

1247
01:23:21,076 --> 01:23:23,203
I wasn't there
when he needed me the most.

1248
01:23:23,345 --> 01:23:25,973
Had l... I could... I could...
I could have saved him.

1249
01:23:26,114 --> 01:23:29,311
I could have saved him.
I could have saved him.

1250
01:23:29,451 --> 01:23:30,213
Allen...

1251
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:33,220
I had 17 minutes,
and I could have saved him, Grace.

1252
01:23:33,322 --> 01:23:35,017
No. Listen to me.
Look at me. Allen.

1253
01:23:35,123 --> 01:23:36,750
Honey, you couldn't.
Listen to me.

1254
01:23:36,858 --> 01:23:39,486
It was a mistake.
It was a mistake.

1255
01:23:39,661 --> 01:23:41,629
He died on impact.
He didn't suffer at all.

1256
01:23:41,763 --> 01:23:43,628
You couldn't have done anything.

1257
01:23:43,765 --> 01:23:45,892
He didn't suffer.
There was no suffering.

1258
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:49,834
There was nothing
you could have done to help him.

1259
01:23:49,938 --> 01:23:52,031
- Really.
- Oh, Grace.

1260
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:54,909
Oh, Grace.

1261
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:57,240
It's okay.

1262
01:23:58,046 --> 01:24:00,105
Oh.

1263
01:24:01,249 --> 01:24:02,807
It's okay.

1264
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:09,285
Grace, we have to bring her home.

1265
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:12,792
- We have to.
- Okay.

1266
01:24:37,586 --> 01:24:40,180
All the places
she could have gone.

1267
01:24:40,322 --> 01:24:41,789
I'm gonna go look for her.

1268
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:44,222
We'll go with you.
Okay?

1269
01:24:44,326 --> 01:24:45,657
I'm ready. I'm okay.

1270
01:24:45,761 --> 01:24:48,025
Come on. Let's go.

1271
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:49,458
Good work.

1272
01:24:49,564 --> 01:24:51,589
After you.
No, don't...

1273
01:25:02,344 --> 01:25:04,244
Shea.

1274
01:25:05,914 --> 01:25:07,882
Hi. It's Allen Brewer here.

1275
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:10,918
Wow. You really would be
caught dead dressed like that.

1276
01:25:11,086 --> 01:25:13,748
- I'm looking for Rose.
- You lost her?

1277
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:17,149
- In a way.
- I don't know where she is.

1278
01:25:17,259 --> 01:25:19,853
I'd like very much to find her.
We're very worried.

1279
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:22,828
So, please, if you can
tell us something, at least...

1280
01:25:22,964 --> 01:25:25,194
It's about time.

1281
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:29,732
All right.

1282
01:25:29,838 --> 01:25:32,033
Try the place
where they crashed.

1283
01:25:32,207 --> 01:25:33,765
She goes there in the afternoons.

1284
01:25:38,313 --> 01:25:39,940
Okay.

1285
01:26:08,477 --> 01:26:10,536
Rose!

1286
01:26:13,648 --> 01:26:15,616
- Rose! Wait!
Rose!

1287
01:26:15,717 --> 01:26:17,116
Rose!
Rose!

1288
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,385
Don't worry, the baby is fine!

1289
01:26:27,529 --> 01:26:29,520
Rose, we were worried, okay?

1290
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:31,292
Why? Why would you be
worried about me?

1291
01:26:31,466 --> 01:26:35,129
Because I'm reading old yearbooks
to try to learn about my baby's dad?

1292
01:26:35,303 --> 01:26:38,295
Where you going, huh?
Hey, look, you're gonna miss her.

1293
01:26:39,608 --> 01:26:41,371
Because the most disgusting stuff
I've ever seen

1294
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:42,875
just came out of my body
on a bus?

1295
01:26:43,044 --> 01:26:44,909
Did your water break?
Are you in labor?

1296
01:26:45,046 --> 01:26:45,978
I'm fine!

1297
01:26:46,147 --> 01:26:50,550
Really wonderful progress, Rose.
A beautiful way to end the year.

1298
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:52,778
We were concerned about you.
You just disappeared.

1299
01:26:52,954 --> 01:26:57,152
Don't worry. I can do anything,
and this baby will be okay.

1300
01:26:57,259 --> 01:26:58,556
Bennett!

1301
01:26:59,528 --> 01:27:01,962
Let us take you to the hospital,
and if it's too soon,

1302
01:27:02,063 --> 01:27:04,122
then we'll just, uh...
we'll take you home.

1303
01:27:07,269 --> 01:27:08,759
I don't want to go home.

1304
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:11,634
I don't want my baby to grow up
in your messed-up home.

1305
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:12,707
Am I supposed to raise her

1306
01:27:12,807 --> 01:27:14,502
without ever talking
about her father?

1307
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:16,941
Tell her she can't even mention
his name in front of her grandfather

1308
01:27:17,045 --> 01:27:20,173
because he hasn't completely
acknowledged that he's dead?

1309
01:27:20,348 --> 01:27:22,373
Or worry at night
that her grandmother

1310
01:27:22,551 --> 01:27:23,745
is gonna smother her
in her sleep

1311
01:27:23,852 --> 01:27:25,911
because she'd rather
she didn't exist?

1312
01:27:26,021 --> 01:27:29,388
Or that her uncle will leave
urine samples next to her crib?

1313
01:27:30,859 --> 01:27:33,384
I'm sorry. That wasn't fair.
I like you, Ryan.

1314
01:27:34,963 --> 01:27:36,396
I like you, too.

1315
01:27:36,565 --> 01:27:38,032
Thank you.

1316
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:42,536
Look, I promise I won't
smother her in her crib.

1317
01:27:42,704 --> 01:27:47,903
I know I wasn't very helpful to you
in your situation,

1318
01:27:48,076 --> 01:27:51,876
and if I had to do it again,
I would do it completely differently.

1319
01:27:54,115 --> 01:27:56,515
Rose.

1320
01:27:56,618 --> 01:27:58,415
Look.

1321
01:28:00,121 --> 01:28:03,090
Once you have this baby,
you'll understand

1322
01:28:03,191 --> 01:28:05,751
that the most horrible thing
that can happen to a mother

1323
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:07,327
is to lose her child.

1324
01:28:13,902 --> 01:28:15,927
I'm sorry...

1325
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:21,207
for what happened between us.

1326
01:28:21,309 --> 01:28:23,402
I really am.

1327
01:28:24,746 --> 01:28:26,907
Please, Rose.

1328
01:28:27,082 --> 01:28:31,576
Give us a chance here.
Just... Just get in the car with us.

1329
01:28:32,621 --> 01:28:34,452
Please.

1330
01:28:42,097 --> 01:28:44,395
I don't even know who he is.

1331
01:28:45,533 --> 01:28:47,558
What do you want to know?
We'll tell you.

1332
01:28:47,736 --> 01:28:51,103
I want to know everything
I would know if he was still alive.

1333
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:53,230
I want more memories of him.

1334
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:56,537
Yeah.

1335
01:28:56,645 --> 01:28:58,840
We'll tell you everything
you want to know about him.

1336
01:28:58,947 --> 01:29:01,415
We'll just keep talking
till the baby comes.

1337
01:29:05,053 --> 01:29:07,647
There's a picture of Bennett
on the track.

1338
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:11,618
Was he fast?
Is my baby gonna be fast?

1339
01:29:11,793 --> 01:29:13,283
Yes.

1340
01:29:13,461 --> 01:29:14,860
How fast?

1341
01:29:15,997 --> 01:29:19,125
50-second 400-meter fast.

1342
01:29:20,168 --> 01:29:22,033
Wow.

1343
01:29:31,613 --> 01:29:35,071
Okay. Okay.

1344
01:29:36,117 --> 01:29:38,108
He was voted Best All-Around.

1345
01:29:38,219 --> 01:29:40,483
Why did they...
Why did people like him so much?

1346
01:29:42,657 --> 01:29:43,851
Tell me!

1347
01:29:44,025 --> 01:29:46,789
Uh, because he was a nice guy.

1348
01:29:46,895 --> 01:29:50,126
In third grade
when his friend Jack got glasses,

1349
01:29:50,298 --> 01:29:53,199
Bennett felt so bad for him that
he took Allen's reading glasses...

1350
01:29:53,368 --> 01:29:54,460
- You remember?
- Mm-hmm.

1351
01:29:54,569 --> 01:29:55,797
And he wore them to school
the next day

1352
01:29:55,904 --> 01:29:57,201
so Jack wouldn't be the only one.

1353
01:29:57,372 --> 01:29:59,636
Okay. Okay.

1354
01:29:59,741 --> 01:30:02,005
Um, who's this girl he's with?

1355
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:03,407
That is his prom date,

1356
01:30:03,511 --> 01:30:05,536
and he only went with her
because she gave good head.

1357
01:30:05,647 --> 01:30:06,909
- Ryan!
- That's true!

1358
01:30:07,015 --> 01:30:09,074
No, that's good. I like that.
That's information.

1359
01:30:09,184 --> 01:30:10,515
I think she was a very smart girl.

1360
01:30:10,685 --> 01:30:13,813
They studied English lit together
one summer at Oxford.

1361
01:30:13,922 --> 01:30:15,355
- She gave good head.
- What else?

1362
01:30:15,523 --> 01:30:16,615
- Ryan!
- It's true. It's true.

1363
01:30:16,725 --> 01:30:18,659
What else? What else?
What else? What else?

1364
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,250
He hated to have his picture taken.

1365
01:30:20,428 --> 01:30:23,226
Whenever I went to take his picture,
he'd always make this horrible face.

1366
01:30:23,331 --> 01:30:24,958
- What was the face?
- Oh, it was a...

1367
01:30:25,066 --> 01:30:26,966
Show me the face!

1368
01:30:27,068 --> 01:30:29,502
That's terrible.

1369
01:30:29,671 --> 01:30:31,832
He'd eat anything off his plate
as long as it was separated.

1370
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:32,565
That's true.

1371
01:30:32,674 --> 01:30:34,266
He'd take all the toppings
off his pizza

1372
01:30:34,375 --> 01:30:35,399
and he'd eat 'em in order.

1373
01:30:35,543 --> 01:30:36,942
It was really...
It was really weird.

1374
01:30:37,045 --> 01:30:39,843
Well, he was a little O.C.D.,
but in a very sweet way, right?

1375
01:30:39,948 --> 01:30:40,972
Mm-hmm.
Very sweet.

1376
01:30:41,116 --> 01:30:43,084
When he used to eat Cheerios,
he'd eat them in pairs

1377
01:30:43,184 --> 01:30:45,209
because he didn't want them
to be alone in his tummy.

1378
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:46,218
Ah, God, this hurts!

1379
01:30:46,354 --> 01:30:47,981
I used to give him shit
for that all the time.

1380
01:30:48,089 --> 01:30:50,023
And he never flossed.

1381
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:51,956
But he did wear an enormous
amount of cologne

1382
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:53,049
once he discovered it,

1383
01:30:53,228 --> 01:30:55,059
and his room smelled
like a men's magazine.

1384
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:57,858
Ow!

1385
01:30:57,966 --> 01:30:59,729
Oh! It's happening.

1386
01:30:59,834 --> 01:31:00,960
Yes, sweetie, it is.

1387
01:31:03,371 --> 01:31:04,998
I know, sweetie.
It's all right. It's all right.

1388
01:31:05,106 --> 01:31:07,700
Bennett lived for 18 years,
3 months, 7 days,

1389
01:31:07,809 --> 01:31:10,573
2 hours, 36 minutes.

1390
01:31:10,678 --> 01:31:14,808
He broke 6 bones in his lifetime
and had a 3.97 G.P.A.

1391
01:31:14,949 --> 01:31:17,281
He never had a girlfriend
before he met you.

1392
01:31:19,454 --> 01:31:23,550
His highest temperature was 104.3.

1393
01:31:23,691 --> 01:31:28,958
And uh, he knew how to count
before he said his first word.

1394
01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:30,461
Which was?

1395
01:31:31,866 --> 01:31:33,390
- Wow.
- Wow.

1396
01:31:35,537 --> 01:31:36,595
Thank you.

1397
01:31:36,704 --> 01:31:38,604
Of course.

1398
01:31:41,276 --> 01:31:43,335
Thank you.

1399
01:31:44,679 --> 01:31:47,739
You're doing great.
Just keep breathing.

1400
01:31:47,916 --> 01:31:49,975
That's it, sweetheart. Okay.
Squeeze my hand if you have to.

1401
01:31:51,486 --> 01:31:54,284
You're doing great. That's it.
Just keep breathing. That's it.

1402
01:31:54,455 --> 01:31:56,150
# Cryin' into your sleeves #

1403
01:31:56,257 --> 01:31:58,191
That's it.
We're gonna be there soon.

1404
01:31:58,293 --> 01:31:59,988
That's a girl.
You're doing great.

1405
01:32:00,094 --> 01:32:01,857
# 'Cause you miss
those lovin' arms #

1406
01:32:01,963 --> 01:32:04,864
It won't be long. That's a girl.
That's it. That's it.

1407
01:32:04,966 --> 01:32:08,094
# A lullaby keeps on playin' #

1408
01:32:09,537 --> 01:32:13,598
# You're thinkin' it's a dream #

1409
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:18,042
# 'Cause you miss
those lovin' arms #

1410
01:32:18,213 --> 01:32:19,680
Oh, my God.

1411
01:32:23,518 --> 01:32:25,782
Her name is Ruby.

1412
01:32:28,323 --> 01:32:32,953
# And you've got a good mind
to pray #

1413
01:32:35,263 --> 01:32:38,460
# They say it's all part of his plan #

1414
01:32:38,566 --> 01:32:43,299
# But what if he's got
slippery hands? #

1415
01:32:47,108 --> 01:32:51,374
# Well, it's a sad face
you're wearin' #

1416
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:54,380
# Like a burned-out sun #

1417
01:32:56,217 --> 01:33:01,086
# 'Cause you miss
those lovin' arms #

1418
01:33:04,559 --> 01:33:07,995
# You'd think a grown man
would care #

1419
01:33:08,162 --> 01:33:12,496
# About his bootlace undone #

1420
01:33:12,667 --> 01:33:17,900
# But you just miss
those lovin' arms #

1421
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:25,307
# Yeah, you miss
those lovin' arms #

1422
01:33:27,582 --> 01:33:32,451
# And you got a good mind to pray #

1423
01:33:34,355 --> 01:33:37,722
# They say it's all part of his plan #

1424
01:33:37,825 --> 01:33:43,388
# But what if he's got
slippery hands? #

1425
01:33:43,564 --> 01:33:46,590
# Well, goddamn #

1426
01:33:46,768 --> 01:33:50,465
# You're a boy, not a man #

1427
01:33:51,639 --> 01:33:56,599
# When you miss those lovin' arms #

1428
01:34:02,684 --> 01:34:03,548
Hey.

1429
01:34:07,822 --> 01:34:09,255
Hi.

1430
01:34:10,258 --> 01:34:11,953
Hi.

1431
01:34:42,156 --> 01:34:45,421
# Everybody wants to know you #

1432
01:34:45,526 --> 01:34:48,654
# They float all around your head #

1433
01:34:48,763 --> 01:34:52,199
# Like a mobile #

1434
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:56,031
# Hell, you don't know
what they're sayin' #

1435
01:34:56,137 --> 01:34:59,231
# Oh, but can't you tell #

1436
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:02,434
# You're a golden egg #

1437
01:35:02,543 --> 01:35:07,845
# Of all the ways
I said your name #

1438
01:35:07,949 --> 01:35:12,613
# A hundred times,
but now it's changed #

1439
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:17,350
# And little things
I didn't have #

1440
01:35:17,558 --> 01:35:20,152
# Are going off #

1441
01:35:20,294 --> 01:35:23,457
# Like bottle caps #

1442
01:35:23,564 --> 01:35:27,898
# A light,
catch a reflection #

1443
01:35:28,002 --> 01:35:33,030
# A cold night,
want some attention #

1444
01:35:33,241 --> 01:35:37,177
# I give without thinking #

1445
01:35:37,278 --> 01:35:40,577
# That's the way it is now #

1446
01:35:44,952 --> 01:35:49,616
# Soft spots,
our hearts made for breaking #

1447
01:35:49,724 --> 01:35:54,093
# Tie knots,
show me what you're making #

1448
01:35:54,195 --> 01:35:58,188
# We fight for a reason #

1449
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:02,597
# Now it's off to bed #

1450
01:36:16,517 --> 01:36:21,921
# If I could help you
as much as I wanted to #

1451
01:36:26,994 --> 01:36:30,361
# But, hell, you don't know
what I'm sayin' #

1452
01:36:30,565 --> 01:36:33,466
# Oh, but can't you tell #

1453
01:36:33,668 --> 01:36:36,762
# I love you #

1454
01:36:36,971 --> 01:36:42,068
# Of all the ways
I said your name #

1455
01:36:42,176 --> 01:36:47,113
# A hundred times,
but now it's changed #

1458
01:36:54,755 --> 01:36:58,122
# Like bottle caps #

1459
01:36:58,326 --> 01:37:03,491
# Going off like bottle caps #

1460
01:37:03,598 --> 01:37:08,092
# A light,
send a reflection #

1461
