<i>It looks like
the storm has passed.</i>

3
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,174
<i>New Yorkers, a season high,</i>
<i>seven inches</i>
<i>of rain last night.</i>

4
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,376
<i>High winds and flooding
in some areas</i>

5
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,478
<i>even left some
New Yorkers stranded.</i>

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,047
<i>City crews still working
this morning.</i>

7
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,281
<i>They're trying
to restore power</i>

8
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:54,119
<i>Good news is,</i>
<i>today should be sunny</i>
<i>with highs in the low 60s.</i>

9
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,625
<i>Relentless weather
these past few weeks.</i>

10
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,360
<i>So get out there,
enjoy the sun,</i>

11
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:03,228
<i>go to the park,
get outside if you can,</i>

12
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,797
<i>because it's not
gonna last long.</i>

13
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,165
<i>What are you doing, John?</i>

14
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,301
<i>Looking at you.</i>

15
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:44,803
<i>Come here.</i>

16
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,644
<i>Are you
still filming?</i>

17
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,772
<i>Just an anniversary...</i>

18
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,301
It's been a while.

19
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,304
My condolences.

20
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,308
How're you holdin' up?

21
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,076
I keep asking "Why her?"

22
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,981
There's no rhyme
or reason to this life.

23
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:19,017
It's days like today
scattered among the rest.

24
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,020
Are you sure?

25
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,722
Don't blame yourself.

26
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,840
What are you really
doing here, Marcus?

27
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,900
Just checkin' up
on an old friend.

28
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:43,742
Goodbye, John.

29
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,542
John Wick?

30
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,810
Yes.

31
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,112
Sign here, please.

32
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,388
And the pen.

33
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,757
Sorry.

34
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,039
Here you go.
Good night.
Thanks.

35
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,059
<i>"John, I'm sorry
I can't be there for you.</i>

00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:12,030

someone, to love.</i>

Hey.

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,823
Hey.

44
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,163
Daisy.

45
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,032
Of course.

46
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,072
Hey.

47
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:33,979
Come on.

48
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,873
I'm up. I'm up...

49
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,309
I'm up. I'm up.

50
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,662
Hey!

51
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,798
Oh.

52
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,166
Right.

53
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:42,847
What?

54
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,193
We'll grab you
some kibble later.

55
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,950
Nice ride.

56
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,021
Mustang.

57
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,222
Boss 429.

58
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,992
She a '70?

59
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,460
'69.

60
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,062
Huh.

61
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,897
Beautiful car.

62
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,139
Thanks.

63
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,102
How much?

64
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,870
Excuse me?

65
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,238
How much for the car?

66
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,841
She's not for sale.

67
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,046
Oh, I love dogs.

68
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,094
You have good day, sir.

69
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,885
All right, come on, then.

70
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,491
How you doin'?

71
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,238
You need to go?

72
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,288
Uh-huh.

73
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,713
Yo, Aurelio!

74
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,175
Ah?

75
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,745
I want a new VIN number
and some clean papers.

76
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,781
Where'd you get that car?

77
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,768
Is it here?

78
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,181
It was.

79
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,837
I asked you where
the hell did you get it?

80
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,808
<i>Iosef Tarasov nicked it.</i>

81
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:12,824
Viggo's son.

82
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,561
Yeah.

83
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,699
All right, get out of here.
Just get out of my shop.
Get out right now.

84
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,367
Did you just lose
your shit, Aurelio?

85
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,770
Because we own you.

86
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,444
What did you say?
What did you say to me?

87
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,812
We own you.

88
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,249
You don't own me, punk.

89
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,151
I work with your father,
all right?

90
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,522
The owner of that car,
did you kill him or what?

91
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:46,190
No.

92
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,593
I sure as hell
fucked up his dog.

93
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:49,794
You fucked up his dog?
That's what you did?

94
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,295
You fucked up his dog?

95
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,630
Yeah...

96
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,465
That's crazy shit, man.

97
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,772
Aw, look at you.
That's great.

98
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,342
You're gonna come into
my shop and you're gonna
pull a gun on me.

99
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,677
Ah, that's great, man.
Come on!

100
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,280
Now, either you kill me
right now

101
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,616
or you get the fuck
outta my shop!

102
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,288
Viggo is not
gonna like this.

103
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,258
How do you know
what Viggo likes
or doesn't like?

104
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,140
I'll tell you somethin'
he's gonna understand.

105
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,366
You've got a fuckin'
pair on you, old man!

106
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,610
I guess we'll be
takin' our business
someplace else.

107
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,843
<i>So what
are you gonna do?</i>

108
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,224
I need a ride.

109
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,207
Aurelio speaking.

110
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,117
I heard
you struck my son.

111
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,214
<i>Yes sir, I did.</i>

112
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,915
And may I ask why?

113
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:21,519
Yeah. Well, because he stole
John Wick's car, sir.

114
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:24,755
And, uh, killed his dog.

115
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:30,995
Oh.

116
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,426
Viggo?

117
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,861
Yeah?

118
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,497
They've agreed
to your terms.

119
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:07,732
I mean, it's not like
you gave them much

120
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,015
of a choice anyway,
though, right?

121
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,097
Congratulations.

122
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,609
Sir?

123
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,680
Have you seen my son?

124
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,433
How was your trip, kid?

125
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,769
We won't be hearing
from them anytime soon.

126
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,337
Or ever.

127
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,930
That's a nice jacket.

128
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,692
Thanks.
Yeah.

129
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:26,777
Should I go?

130
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,616
Viggo, English, please.
Come on...

131
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:34,719
Stay, God damn it!

132
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:37,201
What did I do?

133
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,624
We did
what you asked.

134
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,526
No one saw shit.

135
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,866
I'm not talking
about Atlantic City.

136
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,936
What, then?

137
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:55,072
You mean Aurelio's?
So I stole a fucking car!

138
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,640
Aw, fuck, Viggo!

139
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,602
Right, I'll go...
You stay!

140
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:22,867
It's not what you did, son,
that angers me so.

141
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,869
It's who you did it to.

142
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:27,438
Who? The fucking nobody!

143
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,008
That fuckin' nobody

144
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,778
is John Wick.

145
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,163
<i>He once was
an associate of ours.</i>

146
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,567
They call him Baba Yaga.

147
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,439
The Boogeyman?

148
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,174
Well, John wasn't exactly
The Boogeyman.

149
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:11,215
He was the one
you sent to kill
the fucking Boogeyman.

150
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,021
Oh.

151
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:19,590
John is
a man of focus,

152
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:21,826
commitment,

153
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:23,961
sheer will.

154
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,998
Something you know
very little about.

155
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,636
I once saw him kill
three men in a bar.

156
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,939
With a pencil.

157
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,775
With a fuckin'...

158
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,179
...pencil.

159
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,257
Then suddenly one day
he asked to leave.

160
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,894
It's over a woman,
of course.

161
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,735
<i>So I made a deal with him.</i>

162
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,840
I gave him
an impossible task.

163
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,211
A job no one
could have pulled off.

164
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,220
The bodies
he buried that day

165
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,258
laid the foundation
of what we are now.

166
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,764
And then, my son,

167
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,234
a few days
after his wife died,

168
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:39,970
you steal his car

169
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,708
and kill his fuckin' dog.

170
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,750
Father, I can
make this right.

171
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,112
Oh...

172
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:50,080
How do you plan that?

173
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,149
By finishing
what I started.

174
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:55,111
What the... Did he hear
a fucking word I said?

175
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,889
Iosef! Iosef! Listen!

176
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,293
Huh?

177
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:04,228
John will come for you.

178
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,002
<i>And you will do nothing,</i>

179
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,071
because you can do nothing.

180
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,607
So get the fuck
out of my sight!

181
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,137
<i>Hello, John.</i>

182
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,843
I heard about your wife,
and I'm sorry.

183
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:53,965
My condolences.

184
00:26:56,881 --> 00:27:01,218
<i>It seems to be fate,
or happenstance</i>

185
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,989
<i>or just bad fuckin' luck</i>
<i>caused our paths</i>
<i>to cross once again.</i>

186
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:10,961
John?

187
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,936
Let us not resort to
our baser instincts

188
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,939
<i>and handle this</i>
<i>like civilized men,</i>
<i>to move on...</i>

189
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:34,985
What'd he say?

190
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,056
Enough.

191
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,157
Oh, God.

192
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:45,944
Task your crew.

193
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,199
How many?

194
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,668
How many do you have?

195
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,319
Evenin', John.

196
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,454
Evenin', Jimmy.

197
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:05,923
Noise complaint?

198
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,559
Noise complaint.

199
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,139
You, uh, workin' again?

200
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:24,101
No, just sortin'
some stuff out.

201
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,944
Ah, well...

202
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,214
I'll leave you be, then.

203
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,350
Good night, John.

204
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:34,551
Good night, Jimmy.

205
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,970
This is Wick.

206
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,339
Yes, John Wick,
that's right.

207
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:57,975
I'd like to make
a dinner reservation for 12.

208
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,501
Good to see you, John.

209
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,364
Charlie.

210
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,384
You look good.

211
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,515
And here I'd feared
you'd left all this behind.

212
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,465
Will I be hearin'
from you anytime soon?

213
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,036
Goodbye, Charlie.

214
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,765
John.

215
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,771
Of course he did.

216
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,076
Put a contract
on John Wick.

217
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,644
How much?

218
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:41,886
Two million.

219
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,521
English, Viggo, please.

220
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:59,262
Put Iosef in
the Red Circle and wait.

221
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,666
For what?

222
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:04,835
For John Wick, of course.

223
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,328
Thank you.

224
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,699
To what
do I owe this visit?

225
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:41,671
I have a job for you.

226
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,574
And I've got a phone.

227
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,843
Hmm.

228
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:50,413
I want to offer you
this face to face

229
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:53,416
seeing as how you
might find it personal.

230
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,288
Would you kill John Wick
for two million dollars?

231
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,594
After all, you were close.

232
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,365
Is the contract exclusive?

233
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,167
No, it's open.

234
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,335
It's a timely matter,
it has to be handled quickly.

235
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,905
Consider it done.

236
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,909
Thank you, Marcus.

237
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:21,311
I know I can trust you.
Thanks for the drink.

238
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,471
Room 918.
Do enjoy your stay.

239
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,873
Thanks.

240
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:33,623
Good seeing
you again, John.

241
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:35,745
Perkins.

242
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,884
I have you for two nights.

243
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:43,019
Depending on business,
it may be more.

244
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,688
Of course, sir.

245
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,623
So when did the old place
get a facelift?

246
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,693
Around four years ago.

247
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:52,696
But I assure you, sir,
she really hasn't
changed much.

248
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:53,897
Same owner?

249
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,465
Same owner.

250
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,774
Room 818.

251
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,412
And, as always,

252
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:14,050
it is a pleasure
having you with
us again, Mr. Wick.

253
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,180
<i>What are
you doing, John?</i>

254
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,703
<i>Looking at you.</i>

255
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,112
<i>Come here.</i>

256
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,800
Hello, Winston.

257
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,504
Jonathan.

258
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,875
Now, as I recall,

259
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,944
weren't you the one
tasked to dole out

260
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:23,046
the beatings,
not receive them?

261
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:24,547
Rusty, I guess.

262
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,250
To what do
we owe the pleasure?

263
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,854
Iosef Tarasov.

264
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:33,523
What about him?

265
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:34,765
I'd like to talk with him.

266
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:38,728
A talk, you say.

267
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,800
I'm familiar with
the parlance, Jonathan.

268
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,270
I want to ask you this.

269
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:49,138
Have you returned
to the fold?

270
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,909
Just visiting.

271
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:55,011
Have you thought
this through?

272
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:58,815
I mean, chewed down
to the bone?

273
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,719
You got out once.

274
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:05,221
You dip so much as a pinky
back into this pond,

275
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:10,560
you may well find
something reaches out

276
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:12,929
and drags you
back into its depths.

277
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:14,197
Where do I find him?

278
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,101
Hey.

279
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,737
Wick's at The Continental.

280
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,109
Welcome home, John.

281
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:28,471
We have a contact there
who's willing to
take him out for us.

282
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:29,679
Yeah?

283
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,549
How brazen.

284
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,654
If they're willing
to break the rules
of Continental,

285
00:42:37,656 --> 00:42:39,222
double the bounty.

286
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,758
You know the rules.

287
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,860
No business
can be conducted
on these premises

288
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:47,297
lest incurring
heavy penalties.

289
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:51,968
Have a drink

290
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,672
and relax.

291
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,108
For now.

292
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,914
It's personal.

293
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,823
Holy shit! Jonathan!

294
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:16,092
Hey, Addy.
My God!

295
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,962
How long has it been?
Four years?

296
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:20,597
Five and change.

297
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,033
So tell me, how was life
on the other side?

298
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:26,035
It was good, Addy.

299
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,870
Far better than I deserved.

300
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,974
Hey, I'm sorry
to hear about your...

301
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:32,075
Thanks.

302
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,979
I've never seen
you like this.

303
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,047
Like what?

304
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,650
Vulnerable.

305
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,721
I'm retired.

306
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:46,656
Not if you're drinkin' here,
you're not.

307
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,259
Usual?
Please.

308
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,101
Compliments of the house.

309
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,637
Thanks.

310
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:11,300
Did you see
the tits on that girl?

311
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:16,372
Better hope Lita
is working tonight.

312
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,524
Are you scared of
the fuckin' boogeyman?

313
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:36,325
I'm not.

314
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:39,362
No. But you should be.

315
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,868
I want another bottle!

316
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,106
Right fuckin' now!
Go get me a bottle!

317
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,575
Come on!

318
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,518
Hello, Francis.

319
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,647
Mr. Wick.

320
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,864
Are you here
on business, sir?

321
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,400
Afraid so, Francis.

322
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,742
Why don't you
take the night off.

323
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,577
Thank you, sir.

324
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,209
Fuck you, motherfucker!

325
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,531
Where is Iosef?

326
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,323
Bath house, downstairs.

327
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,448
Go!

328
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,684
John Wick's there.
Go get him!

329
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,208
Move! He's here!
He's fucking here!
He's there! He's coming!

330
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,210
Get in! Get in!

331
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,378
Come on, come on!

332
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:22,951
Good evening, Mr. Wick.

333
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:24,086
Good evening.

334
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:25,921
How may I be of service?

335
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:26,989
Is the doctor in?

336
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:28,857
Yes, sir. 24/7.

337
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,859
Then send him up, please.
Yes, sir.

338
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:32,361
How good's your laundry?

339
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:36,832
I'm sorry to say that
no one's that good.

340
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,669
No. I thought not.

341
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,572
May I suggest
a drink, sir.

342
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:44,814
Bourbon, perhaps.

343
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,943
That sounds perfect.

344
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,060
So what sort of movement
am I looking at?

345
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:07,796
Well, if you're
lookin' to heal,

346
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:09,098
then keep it marginal.

347
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,635
However,
if you still have...

348
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:15,317
...business to attend to,

349
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,748
take two of
these beforehand.

350
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,380
Your stitches'll tear
and you'll bleed,

351
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,417
but you'll
have full function.

352
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:30,619
Do you need anything
for the pain?

353
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,455
No, I've got that covered.

354
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:41,824
Hey, John.

355
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:46,562
Perkins?

356
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:48,684
I thought
I'd let myself in.

357
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,599
I noticed.

358
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:01,610
I never knew Ms. Perkins
to get out of bed
for less than three.

359
00:58:01,612 --> 00:58:03,579
Viggo's giving me four
to break hotel rules.

360
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:06,581
That's unwise,
I assure you.

361
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,755
You were always a pussy.

362
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,733
Yes?

363
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,902
<i>I apologize for calling
you at this hour,</i>

364
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:37,039
but we have received
a number of grievances

365
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:39,281
from your floor
concerning the noise.

366
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,878
My apologies.

367
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,915
I was dealing with
an uninvited guest.

368
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,984
Have you need
then of, say,

369
00:59:48,986 --> 00:59:51,119
a dinner reservation,
perhaps?

370
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:53,822
Perhaps.
I'll have to get back
to you.

371
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:02,698
No!

372
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,801
Where's Iosef?

373
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:06,868
Fuck you.

374
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:07,936
Where's Viggo?

375
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,238
I'm not telling you shit!

376
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,708
Do you really wanna
die here, Perkins?

377
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:15,877
Give me somethin'.

378
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:21,950
Little Russia.

379
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:25,087
There's a church
near Cannon Court.

380
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:26,321
<i>What about it?</i>

381
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:27,856
<i>It's a front.</i>

382
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:30,178
It's where Viggo keeps
his private stash.

383
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,061
Thank you.

384
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,670
Do I know you?

385
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,873
I'm thinkin' so.

386
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,882
Hey, John.

387
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:55,784
Hey, Harry.

388
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:57,219
Everything all right?

389
01:00:57,221 --> 01:01:00,155
Yeah. Everything's fine.

390
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,091
I'll leave you
to it, then.

391
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:04,159
Hey, Harry?

392
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,929
You keen on
earning a coin?

393
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:09,398
Babysittin'
the sleepin' one?

394
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,866
Catch and release?

395
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:12,100
Catch and release.

396
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,967
My son,
how might I help you?

397
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:55,090
Motherfucker!

398
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:07,055
Let's go to the vault.

399
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,181
Open it.

400
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:28,210
Viggo will kill me.

401
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:34,229
Uh-huh.

402
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:47,362
Ladies, out.

403
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,477
Honestly,

404
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:04,946
what do you think
you're going to do
with all of that?

405
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:06,628
This.

406
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,933
Don't worry.

407
01:03:57,935 --> 01:03:59,301
Housekeeping will find you.

408
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,604
Treat all your ladies
like this?

409
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:05,507
You are no lady.
Trust me.

410
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,182
Harry, is it?

411
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,334
How'd you like to earn
more than just a gold coin?

412
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,192
You've broken the rules.

413
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:28,363
You've done business
on Continental grounds.

414
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:32,500
And management
does not take kindly
to that sort of behavior.

415
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,637
Fuck management.

416
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:45,280
Don't worry.
Housekeeping will find you.

417
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:53,889
Ashes to ashes.

418
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:56,658
Can we recover from this?

419
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,226
Viggo, you know
what was
in that vault, right?

420
01:04:58,228 --> 01:04:59,527
It was nothing.

421
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,166
Shit!

422
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:23,485
Come on!

423
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,199
I'll say this, John.

424
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:46,768
They sure as fuck
broke the mold with you.

425
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,673
Ay, ay...

426
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,118
You always had
a certain...

427
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,421
...audacity about you,
you know.

428
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:09,624
Right? Oh, yeah.

429
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:17,665
I can say you're
still very much
the John Wick of old.

430
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:19,768
Am I?

431
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:26,474
People don't change.
You know that.

432
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,277
Times, they do.

433
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,618
Do you know what
was in that vault?

434
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,753
Artwork, cash,
not without its worth,

435
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:41,489
but the leverage
I had on this city,

436
01:07:41,491 --> 01:07:45,427
audio recordings,
physical evidence,
blackmail,

437
01:07:45,429 --> 01:07:46,761
it was fuckin' priceless!

438
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:49,297
Priceless!

439
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,637
Yeah. I kind of
enjoyed that.

440
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:58,640
Yeah,
I know you did.

441
01:07:58,642 --> 01:07:59,707
Yeah.

442
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,143
Are you really laughing?

443
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,518
So...

444
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:16,724
Then you got married, ah?
Settled down.

445
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:19,447
How did you manage
that anyways?

446
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:21,830
Luck, I guess.

447
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:25,300
Yeah.

448
01:08:25,302 --> 01:08:28,336
Yeah, while you had
your wife, I had my son.

449
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:31,406
And believe me,
you had a far better deal.

450
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:38,680
And then you left.

451
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:40,815
And the way
you got out,

452
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:46,287
lying to yourself that
the past held no sway
over the future.

453
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:47,889
But in the end,

454
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:54,529
a lot of us are rewarded
for our misdeeds,

455
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:58,266
which is why
God took your wife

456
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:02,270
and unleashed
you upon me.

457
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,376
This life follows you.

458
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:13,281
It clings to you,

459
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:18,620
infecting everyone
who comes close to you.

460
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:21,422
We are cursed,
you and I.

461
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,927
On that we agree.

462
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:31,933
Finally, common ground.

463
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,602
Okay.

464
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:36,871
Step aside.

465
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:38,806
Give me your son.

466
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,442
John Wick.

467
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,452
It was just a fucking car!
Just a fuckin' dog!

468
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:52,887
Just a dog...

469
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,410
Viggo?

470
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:58,326
Yeah.

471
01:09:58,328 --> 01:10:00,728
When Helen died,
I lost everything.

472
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:05,400
Until that dog arrived
on my doorstep.

473
01:10:05,402 --> 01:10:08,636
A final gift from my wife.

474
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:11,806
In that moment,
I received some
semblance of hope.

475
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:16,878
An opportunity
to grieve unalone.

476
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:20,582
And your son

477
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,484
took that from me!

478
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:24,552
Oh, come on...

479
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,588
Stole that from me!

480
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:29,557
Killed that from me!

481
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:32,293
People keep asking
if I'm back.

482
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:34,896
And I haven't really
had an answer.

483
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:38,600
But now, yeah,
I'm thinkin' I'm back!

484
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:41,703
So you can either
hand over your son...

485
01:10:41,705 --> 01:10:45,373
...or you can die
screaming alongside him!

486
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,331
Cool it, cool it, cool it,
cool it, cool it!

487
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,434
John!

488
01:13:28,772 --> 01:13:30,492
Where is he?
Shit.

489
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,474
Shit!

490
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:40,982
I have your word that
if I tell you where he is,

491
01:13:40,984 --> 01:13:42,817
you'll let me walk away?

492
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:44,051
Pull the contract.

493
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:49,791
Done.

494
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,632
He's kept in a safe house.
Brooklyn.

495
01:13:57,634 --> 01:13:59,500
434 Wallace Place.

496
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,604
They know you're coming.

497
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:05,673
Of course.

498
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:07,074
But it won't matter.

499
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,241
Will you stop playing
the fucking video game?

500
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:17,678
Will you stop playing
that fucking video game?

501
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:30,124
Get down, get down!

502
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,435
Come on, come on!
Get down, get down!

503
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:02,316
Make the arrangements.

504
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:21,869
Thank you.

505
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,345
Our pleasure, sir.

506
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:31,746
A parting gift.
From the management.

507
01:17:31,748 --> 01:17:33,948
Compensation for
last night's unfortunate

508
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,130
incident.

509
01:18:24,099 --> 01:18:27,101
How many times
do I have to save your ass?

510
01:18:27,103 --> 01:18:28,135
I appreciate it.

511
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:30,204
Of course.

512
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:31,446
You look terrible.

513
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,075
No, I look retired.

514
01:18:34,077 --> 01:18:35,743
Retired?

515
01:18:35,745 --> 01:18:37,178
You really believe that?

516
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:53,867
You made a new life.

517
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,064
You'll find your way
back to it.

518
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:00,801
It's time to go home.

519
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:58,392
Let's get on with this,
whatever the fuck this is.

520
01:19:58,394 --> 01:19:59,527
Hello, Marcus.

521
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:14,241
This is John.

522
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,879
I appreciate you
granting my son
a swift death.

523
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:24,077
<i>I wouldn't know</i>
<i>how to reply</i>
<i>to that either.</i>

524
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:28,189
Marcus betrayed me.

525
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:41,402
You pulled the contract.

526
01:20:41,404 --> 01:20:46,173
And while it was open,
you had every chance,

527
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:49,443
every opportunity
to kill John Wick.

528
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:52,546
And if you had
done your job,

529
01:20:52,548 --> 01:20:54,849
my son would
be still alive!

530
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:59,386
<i>And in so doing,</i>

531
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:01,555
he broke the cardinal rule.

532
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:04,592
Thank you.

533
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:09,530
Ms. Perkins.

534
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,534
Why am I not surprised?

535
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:16,016
In for a penny,
in for a pound.

536
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:20,541
<i>So, John,
I had no choice.</i>

537
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,911
I always liked you, Marcus.

538
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,448
The last of the old guard.

539
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,153
Oh.

540
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:40,194
But unlike the others,
you go out on my terms.

541
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:43,030
God! No!

542
01:21:46,002 --> 01:21:47,401
No, my good sir.

543
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:51,038
I go out on my own.

544
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:13,994
See?

545
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,207
Well played, old friend.

546
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,383
We done, Viggo?

547
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:38,052
We're done.

548
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:39,294
Okay. Here.

549
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,288
Thank you.

550
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:46,727
Yeah. Fuel the chopper.

551
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:13,721
<i>Ms. Perkins,</i>
<i>I apologize for</i>
<i>calling you at this hour.</i>

552
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:59,333
Ms. Perkins,

553
01:23:59,335 --> 01:24:01,502
your membership
to the Continental
has been,

554
01:24:01,504 --> 01:24:04,271
by thine own hand,
revoked.

555
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:33,834
<i>I know what
you're thinking, Jonathan.</i>

556
01:24:33,836 --> 01:24:35,736
<i>We live by a code.</i>

557
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:37,438
Which is why I'm not
the one telling you that

558
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,440
a certain helicopter
at a certain helipad

559
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:41,882
is being fueled for
a certain someone.

560
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:02,162
Have you got my cigarettes?

561
01:25:02,164 --> 01:25:03,324
Yeah, I got your cigarettes.

562
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:28,222
Oh, fuck!

563
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:33,494
Yeah. Super.
Come on, let's go. Faster!

564
01:25:33,496 --> 01:25:35,656
The helicopter's
right down there.
Come on! Let's go!

565
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:49,810
Oh, shit!

566
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:51,879
Goddamn,
I knew he'd come.

567
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:08,595
What's fuckin' wrong
with this guy?

568
01:26:08,597 --> 01:26:10,297
Somebody give me a gun.
Who's got a gun?

569
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:13,934
Oh, God!

570
01:26:15,704 --> 01:26:17,638
That was a good one.

571
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,640
Who's got a gun?

572
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:35,856
Fuck!

573
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:55,668
Viggo, the helicopters,
right over there.
We have to get over there.

574
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:06,920
Ah!

575
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:13,961
Oh, my God,
I need a gun.

576
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:37,851
English, please.

577
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:38,933
Good luck.

578
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,522
Russian cocksucker.

579
01:27:42,524 --> 01:27:43,724
Ah!

580
01:27:43,726 --> 01:27:44,891
Fuck!

581
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:12,019
No!

582
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:16,917
No more guns, John.

583
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:21,021
No more bullets.

584
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,657
No more bullets.

585
01:29:31,933 --> 01:29:33,600
Just you and me, John.

586
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:35,802
You and me.

587
01:29:59,627 --> 01:30:01,962
What happened, John?

588
01:30:01,964 --> 01:30:04,731
We were professionals.
Civilized.

589
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,600
Do I look civilized to you?

590
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:31,518
Be seeing you, John.

591
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:34,921
Yeah.

592
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:37,691
Be seeing you.

593
01:32:28,943 --> 01:32:32,178
<i>Come on, John.
Let's go home.</i>

594
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,317
It's okay.

595
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:20,220
Let's go home.

595
