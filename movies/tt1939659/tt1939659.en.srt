2
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,844
Help.

3
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,081
Help me!

4
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,621
Help me, Lord.

5
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,517
I'm dying.

6
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,720
What is this?

7
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,325
Cancer?

8
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,582
Mother Mary, full of grace, protect me

9
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,551
and guide me in my hour of death.

10
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,115
It's a test.

11
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,551
Cut it down.

12
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,288
Cut it down.

13
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,197
Shh.

14
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,976
Sue Snell
and Tommy Ross, come on.

15
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,861
Let's go, ladies!
In the water! Caps on, please!

16
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,793
Chris and Sue, let's go!

17
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,655
I want you to keep it
in the air three times. All right?

18
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,420
We are graduating, Ms. Desjardin.

19
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,892
Yeah, Sue!

20
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,531
Get that.

21
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,138
Don't be afraid of the ball, ladies.

22
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,936
All right, here we go.

23
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,114
All right, Carrie White.
Let's get Carrie into the game.

24
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,889
You can't stand
on the sidelines all the time. Come on.

25
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,991
Whoo!

26
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:01,827
Carrie's serve.

27
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,886
Yeah, Carrie White!

28
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,090
Do it, Carrie! Yeah, yeah.

29
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,791
Throw it. Do it. Serve it.

30
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,298
Oh. Ow.

31
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,133
What the hell?

32
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,073
It's so funny, Chris.

33
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,382
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,650
Oh, my God.

35
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,078
You eat shit.

36
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,767
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.

37
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,135
No, he didn't. You're making it up.

38
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,670
He came up to me and I said,
"Well, you have to extend your hand..."

39
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,104
Now you're lying.

40
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,583
Help! Help! Help me!

41
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,519
Help me.

42
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,784
- Get off me, you freak!
- Please.

43
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,953
Oh, my God. Look what you did to my shirt.

44
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,197
Please!

45
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,893
Stop! Stop! Settle down.

46
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,298
I think I'm bleeding to death. Please.

47
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,271
Oh, my God. It's period blood.

48
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,606
I'm bleeding. I think I'm dying.

49
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,598
What? Oh, my God.

50
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,604
Please help me!

51
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,472
It's just your period.

52
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,413
Just plug it up.

53
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,478
- Help me!
- Oh, God!

54
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,813
Oh! She got you.
Help me!

55
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,322
God, just plug it up!

56
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,718
Help!

57
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,617
Plug it up!

58
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm sorry. No!

59
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,596
No!

60
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,337
Plug it up!

61
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,840
Girls, come on! Move!

62
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,178
Ladies.

63
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,315
- Oh, my God. Okay. All right.
- Help me.

64
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,652
Okay, honey, stand up.
Let's get you cleaned up.

65
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:21,927
Help me, help me.

66
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,088
Oh, Carrie, come on.

67
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,763
Stand up.
Come on, can you stand up?

68
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,356
It hurts! It hurts!

69
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,933
It hurts! Something's not right.
Something's not right.

70
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,434
Okay, okay. What are you talking about?

71
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,505
Ms. Desjardin,
I don't think she knows it's her period.

72
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,174
No!

73
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,666
All right, Sue.
Get out of here! You're not helping.

74
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,278
- No! No!
- Calm down!

75
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,616
Everyone get out! Now! Out!

76
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,487
Okay, deep breaths. Come here.

77
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,053
Come on. It's okay. You're okay, sweetie.

78
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,118
It's totally normal.

79
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,421
Shh.

80
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,394
Do you know what it means?

81
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,298
Okay, sweetie.

82
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,573
Are you, uh, feeling better?

83
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,374
Can I get you some aspirin?

84
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,946
Some juice or something?

85
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,227
Juice? Really, Henry?

86
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,741
Maybe you just
want us to leave you alone.

87
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,322
Carrie, honey,
I am so sorry that I slapped you.

88
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,824
I should have handled it better.

89
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:31,155
It's totally normal
for young girls to get their periods.

90
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,855
It usually actually happens
a little bit earlier.

91
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,398
Is this your first time?

92
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,842
Honey, do you understand
what's happening to your body?

93
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,312
Do you know what it means?

94
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,439
What?

95
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,013
I don't know.
I felt something moving down there.

96
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,515
- Oh, honey.
- Whoa!

97
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:57,213
Maybe you could, uh,
talk to a counselor about that

98
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,051
or a nurse.

99
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:03,393
Um, what I need to know
is who started throwing...

100
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,352
...things.

101
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,862
It was Chris Hargensen
and all of her friends.

102
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,092
- Cassie...
- "Carrie."

103
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,098
Carrie, did Chris Hargensen start this?

104
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:14,072
Honey, you don't have to protect them.

105
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,904
What they did was unforgiveable.

106
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,710
Okay, uh...

107
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,147
It doesn't seem that Carrie
is going to point the finger,

108
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,684
so Ms. Desjardin,
I need you to get to the bottom of this.

109
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,253
Let the punishment fit the crime.

110
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,243
Okay.

111
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,223
Carrie, you're excused
from P.E. class for the rest of the week.

112
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,626
Just take study hall, okay? At the library.

113
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,627
Yeah. We're going
to have to call your mom.

114
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,420
What?

115
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,297
We're going to have to
call your mother, Carrie.

116
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,637
I know she's had
problems with us in the past,

117
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,306
ever since the state stopped her from

118
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,908
homeschooling you anymore,

119
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,143
but we've got to bring her into this, okay?

120
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,211
Mmm-mmm. No.

121
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,813
Sweetie, we have no choice.

122
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,655
- We have to tell your mom what happened.
- No.

123
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,510
Carrie.

124
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,102
Hey. Hey, you.

125
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,732
Tina, give it to me. Give it here.

126
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,868
This is brilliant. Look at this video.

127
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:53,270
<i>Plug it up!</i>

128
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,602
She got her period. On my hand.

129
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,738
That is so disgusting.

130
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,873
It was on my hand and Sue's shirt.
It was so disgusting.

131
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,613
Mmm.

132
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,571
I'm sorry you had
to come to school today, Mom.

133
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,686
Let's go inside, little girl.

134
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,489
You need to come inside with me.

135
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,927
Mama, why didn't you tell me?

136
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,624
I was so scared, Mama.
I thought I was going to die.

137
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,357
Mama, they laughed at me
and they threw things at me.

138
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,034
We'll talk about this inside, Carrie.

139
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,097
No.

140
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,575
I want to talk about it right here.

141
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,203
I don't want to go inside with you.

142
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,863
Crazy Carrie, Crazy Carrie!

143
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,562
Crazy Carrie, Crazy Carrie.

144
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,510
Oh, Lord, help my child.

145
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,109
She's lost.

146
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,279
Mama, stop it.

147
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,677
Mama!

148
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,919
I don't want to upset you.

149
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,459
So, you're a woman now.

150
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,365
And God made Eve from the rib of Adam.

151
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,774
- And what, Carrie? Say it.
- No, Mama.

152
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,436
- Say it.
- Talk to me.

153
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,805
- Please just talk to me.
- And Eve was weak.

154
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,780
I just want you to talk to me.

155
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,249
And the first sin was
the sin of intercourse.

156
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,783
And the first sin was
the sin of intercourse.

157
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,444
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

158
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,489
And God visited Eve with a curse.

159
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,224
And the curse was a curse of blood.

160
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,626
I'm not going to say that.

161
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,828
That's not even in the Bible.
It doesn't say that anywhere.

162
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,898
Oh, Lord. Help this little girl
see the sin of her days and ways.

163
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,032
Show her if she had remained innocent,

164
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,168
the curse of blood would
not have come upon her as it did on Eve.

165
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,660
I'm not Eve, Mama. I didn't sin.

166
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,273
You showered with those other girls.

167
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,574
You had lust-filled thoughts.

168
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,610
Everyone has to shower, Mama.
Everyone. That's just the rules.

169
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,713
You must be different,
because He can see you.

170
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,748
I don't want to be different, Mama.
I want to be like them.

171
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,283
He can smell the sin on you.

172
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,085
And He will punish you.

173
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,654
I will not let that
come down upon you. I will not.

174
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,089
Lord have mercy.

175
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,292
No. "The Lord is good.
His unfailing love endures forever,

176
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,829
and his faithfulness continues
through all generations."

177
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,997
Psalms 100, verse 5.

178
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,131
I'm going to keep you
away from that school.

179
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,700
- You can't.
- We'll pray. We'll pray together.

180
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,703
To save our women-weak,
wicked, sinning souls.

181
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,002
You didn't tell me and they laughed.

182
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,199
I didn't sin, you sinned.

183
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,936
I did not.

184
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,441
I did not sin.

185
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,181
Go to your closet.

186
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,551
No, Mama.

187
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,153
Go to your closet and pray.

188
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,530
You pray.

189
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,027
No.

190
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,641
No!

191
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,809
No!

192
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,678
Get off me! Mama! Stop it!

193
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,914
- Go to your closet and
pray for forgiveness. - No!

194
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,644
- You pray.
- Mama! Help!

195
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,246
- No, Mommy!
- Come on.

196
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,913
Please! Help!

197
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,330
You pray, little girl.
Pray for forgiveness.

198
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,730
Mommy, let me go!

199
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,364
Let me out!

200
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,566
Mom!

201
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,209
God, you suck!

202
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,589
Help me. Help me.

203
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:10,941
What?

204
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,808
- I'm sorry.
- What?

205
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,988
Hey. What's wrong?

206
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,193
I really messed up today, Tommy.

207
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,101
What, that thing with Carrie?

208
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,433
You know about that?

209
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,938
Yeah, everyone knows about it,

210
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,669
but you're not responsible
for what Chris does.

211
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,337
Yeah, but it was me, too.

212
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,744
You threw tampons at Carrie White?

213
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,181
I kicked a kid in the ribs once.

214
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,491
Yeah, while he was knocked out.

215
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,026
Because this kid,

216
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,862
he used to beat the living shit out of me
every day in sixth grade.

217
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,490
Danny Patrick.

218
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,073
Did you apologize to Carrie?

219
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,342
Did you apologize
to Danny Patrick?

220
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,538
No, but we're not in sixth grade anymore.

221
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,369
Don't.

222
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,546
He was a dick to me.

223
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,516
What did Carrie White ever do to you?

224
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,719
Whoo!

225
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,855
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is why he lost his license.

226
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,831
Then why are you still driving?

227
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,840
I don't need a license
if they can't catch me.

228
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,971
Jackie's email, Jackie's email!

229
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,775
Chris, no. No!

230
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,914
Wow. Why don't you two
kiss or something while you're at it?

231
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,382
Oh, baby.

232
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,851
Don't be stupid.

233
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,717
Wait.

234
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,231
Do you think we're going to get detention
because of that?

235
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,200
- Because that would suck.
- No.

236
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:14,572
They should be thanking us
for helping her through her first period.

237
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,641
I got her a tampon. So what?

238
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,643
You were only trying to help her, right?

239
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,202
We should post it.

240
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,414
No, I'm in it.

241
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,442
No one's going to see you, Teenie.

242
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,549
What? What are you doing?

243
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,292
Carrie White.

244
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:40,931
Favorite movie?

245
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:41,956
<i>Bloodsport.</i>

246
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,766
Favorite drink?

247
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,203
Bloody Mary.

248
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,512
<i>Brightly beams</i>

249
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,481
<i>Our Father's mercy</i>

250
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:03,546
<i>From His lighthouse evermore</i>

251
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:09,291
<i>But to us He gives the keeping</i>

252
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:15,859
<i>Of the lights along the shore</i>

253
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:21,338
<i>Let the lower lights be burning</i>

254
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,934
Did you finish your prayers, little girl?

255
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,988
Yes, Mama.

256
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,066
That's my good girl.

257
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,494
I love you.

258
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,034
I love you, too, Mama.

259
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,407
All right, stand up.

260
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,354
Line up, please.

261
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,034
You have a big week
coming up. A big month, actually.

262
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:28,739
Probably the biggest month of your lives.
Prom and then graduation.

263
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,230
Are you excited?

264
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,235
You probably all have your dresses.

265
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,746
You have your dates by now.

266
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,346
What about you, Chris?

267
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,119
Who's the lucky guy?

268
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,854
Billy Nolan. You don't know him.

269
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,089
He doesn't go to this school.

270
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,625
Are you going to get him a boutonniere?

271
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,992
Or are you just going to pin
a bloody tampon to his lapel?

272
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,296
I so don't need to hear this.

273
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,696
You're not going anywhere.

274
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,365
What about you, Sue?

275
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:02,002
Are you and Tommy busy campaigning
to be Prom King and Queen?

276
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,038
I would have voted for you.

277
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,407
Not now.

278
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,143
You all did a shitty thing yesterday.

279
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,950
A really shitty thing.

280
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,619
And one of you
had the audacity to post a video.

281
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,458
Somebody made a video of it?

282
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,949
This is bullshit.

283
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,296
That's it. Thanks to Miss Hargensen,
you're all running suicides.

284
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,594
I'm not doing it.

285
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,360
That's up to you.

286
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:33,737
That's up to all of you, but anyone
who stops running is suspended.

287
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:36,707
And if you're suspended,
you're not going to prom.

288
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,911
While you're running,
I'd like for you to think long and hard

289
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,847
about what it would be like
to be Carrie White.

290
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,792
I'll be okay, Mama.

291
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,353
I'm going to leave work early today
and pick you up after school.

292
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,782
She can't do this to me.

293
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,951
Just let it go, Chris. We're almost done.

294
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,486
Then every day this week?

295
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,455
All because of Carrie White?

296
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,224
Like hell I will.

297
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,026
Keep moving, Hargensen.

298
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,128
Keep running or you're not going to prom.

299
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,426
Fuck you!

300
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,399
This is child abuse.

301
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,389
What did you say to me?

302
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,637
I'm not going to run another goddamn inch

303
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,305
because Carrie White got her period

304
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,375
and was too stupid to know what it was.

305
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,510
- What?
- You're suspended.

306
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,680
You're out of prom
and you're out of my class. Now.

307
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,215
- No.
- No?

308
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,051
You can't decide that.
She can't do this to us.

309
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,820
Goodbye, Chris. The rest
of you, keep at it.

310
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,155
Someone could die of dehydration.

311
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,224
Tina, you have a heart condition, right?

312
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,694
If we all stick together,
they're not going to suspend all of us.

313
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:08,098
They're not going to keep us all from prom.
There would be no prom.

314
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,225
Nik, Lizzy?

315
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,962
Let's go, ladies!

316
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,828
Heather?

317
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:18,375
This is bullshit!
We didn't do anything wrong.

318
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,077
All right, let's go.

319
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,070
Right, Sue? You're with me on this, right?

320
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,440
Come on.

321
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:26,940
Sue.

322
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,042
Come on.

323
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,590
Keep going, ladies.

324
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,257
This isn't over.

325
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:44,628
This isn't over by a long shot.

326
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,773
That's Carrie White.

327
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,596
Um, you know... Sorry.

328
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,725
I was just going to say,
you can make it full-screen. Watch.

329
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,508
All right, who's next?

330
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,017
Uh, Carrie. Favorite poem.
Did you bring one?

331
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:17,688
Yeah.

332
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,823
Why don't you come to
the front of the class

333
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,121
and share it with us all?

334
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,811
"This unfrequented place to find some ease"

335
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:48,107
"Ease to the body some, none to the mind"

336
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,385
"Times past,
and what once I was and what am now"

337
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,484
"O wherefore was my birth
from Heaven foretold"

338
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,331
"Twice by an Angel, who at last in sight"

339
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,927
"Of both my Parents all in flames..."

340
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,029
"...ascended."

341
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:15,107
Okay, uh, that was, uh...

342
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,581
...disturbing.

343
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,684
That is the most
you've said in class all year.

344
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:21,985
Is there anything else you'd like to share

345
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,754
or are you done scaring us for the day?

346
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,416
Asshole.

347
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,888
Excuse me, Mr. Ross.
Did you say something?

348
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,983
I said, "Awesome."

349
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,196
I just thought
what Carrie read was awesome.

350
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,366
Didn't you, Mr. Ulmann?

351
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,438
All right, who's next? Uh...

352
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,474
Nicki.

353
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,965
I mean, Lizzy.

354
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,379
Is anyone working?

355
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:01,889
Excuse me.

356
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,897
Is anybody working?

357
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,640
Oh, Margaret.

358
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,845
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I don't know where Hugo and Gloria...

359
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,680
Can I help you, Mrs. Snell?

360
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,012
Yes, I'm picking up.

361
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,324
Margaret, I want to say how sorry I am

362
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,384
about what happened at the school.

363
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:40,731
There's no excuse for what Sue did,
but she's a good girl.

364
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,098
Are any of those girls good?

365
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,805
Oh, that is beautiful work, Margaret.

366
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,408
Thank you.

367
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,715
I love what you've done with the neckline.

368
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,752
And the stitches. You can barely see them.

369
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,022
So few people can sew like this anymore.

370
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,225
I could never do anything like this myself.

371
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,260
Sue's going to look beautiful.

372
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,629
I am so excited for her.

373
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,932
I remember my prom.

374
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,800
Anyway, she's going to love it.

375
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,370
These are Godless times, Mrs. Snell.

376
00:32:27,742 --> 00:32:29,446
<i>This gym teacher
was running Chrissie</i>

377
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,014
into the ground and used profanity.

378
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,916
I believe the term "shitty" was used.

379
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,618
She can't do that.
It's abuse of power.

380
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,487
You're right, Daddy. That's what she said.

381
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,957
"Shitty." She's really abusive.

382
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,560
Ms. Desjardin was reprimanded
for what happened in class today.

383
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,729
But you know we've had a lot of problems

384
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,897
with your daughter in the past.

385
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:50,467
And now, with what she did
to her classmate, Carrie White.

386
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,703
The girl was having her...

387
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,271
What your daughter and her posse...

388
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,773
I'm not going to sit here
and listen to half-truths.

389
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,942
I know my daughter.
She said she didn't do it.

390
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,877
I want her prom privileges restored.

391
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,676
You can't prove she did anything, can you?

392
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,451
I believe that there is a
video of the incident.

393
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,846
And I think
your daughter is the one who took it.

394
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,425
I think a video like that would probably
be pretty damning to anyone in it

395
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,160
and to the person who made it.

396
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,996
Don't you, Mr. Hargensen?

397
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,431
I don't know. I'm just a gym teacher,

398
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:25,469
but it seems like a video like that
would probably affect college admissions,

399
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,736
possibly a lawsuit, tons of bad publicity.

400
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,509
I wonder what <i>The Today Show</i>
would do with a video like that.

401
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,579
I think we should just look at her phone
and if it's not there,

402
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,380
I owe you a huge apology
and she should be allowed to go to prom.

403
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:41,774
Chris.

404
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,323
Chris.

405
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:50,193
Daddy,
I'm not going to give them my phone.

406
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,762
I have personal things on here.

407
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,997
Isn't that invasion of
privacy or something?

408
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,100
Chrissie, if you want to go to prom,

409
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,770
just give them the damn phone
and we can be done with this.

410
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:00,971
I have to get back to work.

411
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,139
Dad.

412
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,904
God damn it,
just give them your phone, Chris.

413
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,238
No.

414
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,520
So, I'm officially out of the prom.

415
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,894
I bet that cocksucker Morton
loses his job, though.

416
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,463
My dad is suing him.

417
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,204
Jesus, Sue, why didn't you stand up for me?

418
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,807
We could have had them by the balls.

419
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,402
We deserved it
for what we did to Carrie White.

420
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,239
I thought I deserved it.

421
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,651
Desjardin was right.
We did a shitty thing for no reason.

422
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,719
Bullshit!

423
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,789
That Carrie goes around saying
that everyone but her and her mother

424
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,292
are going to hell
and you stuck up for her? Come on!

425
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,727
You can be such a pig sometimes, Chris.

426
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,129
What did Carrie White ever do to you?

427
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,898
She's been begging for it
since the sixth grade, Sue.

428
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,332
I got to go.

429
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:07,137
I seem to remember you were in there

430
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,072
throwing shit with the rest of us.

431
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,541
What was it that she was calling her?

432
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,476
- "Freak"?
- I stopped.

433
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,879
Oh, you stopped?

434
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,846
- Yeah.
- Why did you keep running?

435
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,176
Hmm?

436
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,352
- Why did you keep running, Sue?
- Stop it, Chris!

437
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,955
You kept running, Sue, little Suze,

438
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,691
because you've been dreaming
about senior year

439
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,393
and the perfect boyfriend
and the perfect prom

440
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,986
your whole goddamned life.

441
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,757
You already booked the hotel,

442
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,767
already practiced the sounds
you're going to make

443
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,362
when you and Tommy make love.

444
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:45,104
That's why you had this
bullshit change of heart.

445
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,540
You don't give a shit about Carrie White.

446
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,877
And everybody knows it.

447
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,344
Okay. I'll see you around, Sue.

448
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:22,928
Carrie?

449
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,720
Carrie?

450
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,576
I'm not going to let
anyone hurt you, little girl.

451
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,751
You're safe here with me.

452
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,631
Got it.

453
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:36,835
Hey.

454
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,284
How are you doing?
Good.

455
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,513
- Good?
- Yeah.

456
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,790
- What's up?
- I want you to take Carrie White to prom.

457
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,288
Good one, babe. Come on.

458
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,334
Are you serious?

459
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,002
I'm just trying to fix what I did.

460
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,671
Yeah.
I get that, but this is...

461
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,806
Sue, it's nuts.

462
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,174
Okay, so it's nuts.

463
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,677
But after what we did to her,
I have to do something.

464
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,578
I have to do something that counts.

465
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,047
Uh...

466
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,550
What even makes you think
that she would say yes to me?

467
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,651
She'd say yes.

468
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,319
We've barely even spoken.

469
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,055
I saw how she looked at you in class
when you rescued her.

470
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,149
What girl doesn't want to go to prom?

471
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,493
What girl doesn't want one magical night?

472
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,631
Maybe I can give that up for her.

473
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,157
No. Babe, I want you
to have that magic night.

474
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,037
I don't want to go to prom
with Carrie White.

475
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,471
I want to go to prom with you.

476
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,504
I can't go.

477
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,831
Hey, Carrie.

478
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,201
I was looking for you at the library

479
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,469
because that's where they said you were.

480
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,803
But, uh, you weren't there,
so I figured maybe you were here.

481
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,247
<i>"Telekinesis: Unlocking the Mind. "</i>

482
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,376
No, no.
Is that about, uh, hypnosis?

483
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,519
Because me and my friends, we tried that.

484
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,784
We actually hypnotized my boy's dog.

485
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,385
Anyway, um...

486
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:32,993
How are you doing?

487
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,494
I'm okay.

488
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,290
Cool.

489
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,797
So you know how, um, prom is next week?

490
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,070
You know?

491
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,544
Um, I was wondering,

492
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,309
if you don't have a date already,
maybe you want to go with me.

493
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,287
What?

494
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,654
The prom. Next week.

495
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:08,987
Carrie.

496
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,693
Hey.

497
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,307
- Carrie.
- Stop!

498
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,213
Please, just stop trying to trick me.

499
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:31,820
No, I'm not trying to trick you.
I'm not tricking you.

500
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,356
Aren't you with Sue Snell?

501
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,258
Yeah, I'm with Sue Snell,
but she doesn't want to go.

502
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:40,991
I'm sorry.

503
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,844
Did one of the girls try something again?

504
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,842
No.

505
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,558
I got invited to prom.

506
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,556
Really?

507
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,531
That's great news.

508
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,536
With who?

509
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:25,168
It's Tommy Ross.

510
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,776
Wow. Tommy Ross?

511
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,449
He is pretty dreamy, huh?

512
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,010
Yeah.

513
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,748
I know who he goes around with.

514
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,920
They're just going to trick me again.

515
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,128
Right?

516
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,234
Maybe he really meant it.

517
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,128
No.

518
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,272
Yes, of course he did.

519
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,537
Why?

520
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,715
Why would he want to go with me?

521
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:08,611
Come here.

522
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,954
Do you know what I see?

523
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,761
I see a beautiful young woman.

524
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,966
Maybe wear a little make-up.

525
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,935
Pinch your cheeks a little bit,

526
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,902
put some color in there.

527
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:33,008
Curl your hair.

528
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,102
Stand up straight.

529
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,338
There you go.

530
00:43:40,627 --> 00:43:42,452
<i>Come on, Sue.</i>

531
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,587
You and Chris are best friends.
If you two...

532
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:48,925
If you three are planning on playing a joke
on a lonely, defenseless girl...

533
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,426
This has nothing to do with Chris.

534
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,952
Or you, Miss Desjardin. And for me...

535
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:58,301
Listen, with due respect,
Miss Desjardin, this is between Sue and me.

536
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,803
It's kind of like a private thing.

537
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,739
And what is the big deal anyway?

538
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,980
It's just for one night, right?

539
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,944
Famous athletes like Tim Tebow,

540
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:11,381
he takes kids to prom all the time
and everyone loves him for it.

541
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,208
Really?

542
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,852
You're hardly a famous athlete.

543
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,353
This is a really big deal for her.

544
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,582
Listen. It doesn't matter.

545
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,657
She said no.

546
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,659
- So you'll try again.
- Don't.

547
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,888
- Okay.
- It's not okay.

548
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,319
Tommy,

549
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,366
when you show up to prom
with Carrie White on your arm,

550
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,503
don't you think you're going to look
the tiniest bit ridiculous?

551
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,802
We don't care how we look. Do we?

552
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,297
No.

553
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,137
Come on.

554
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,800
What are you doing here?

555
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,401
Aren't you going to ask me in?

556
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,503
What do you want? You can't be here.

557
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,200
Right to the point, huh?
Cool. About the prom.

558
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,375
You kind of left me hanging.

559
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,943
I already told you.

560
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,435
I know, but I was hoping
that you'd change your mind.

561
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,182
Girls change their mind all the time.

562
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,420
Why are you doing this?

563
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,786
Because I want to.

564
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,116
You need to leave.

565
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,028
I'm not leaving until you say yes.

566
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,965
Why is this so important to you?

567
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,161
Because I think
that we would have a good time.

568
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:46,571
And because I think
that what you read in class was cool.

569
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,310
I looked up that book
in the library myself.

570
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:55,650
That's the guy who brought
the temple down. Samson, right?

571
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,246
Yes.

572
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,591
Yes, okay, I'll go.

573
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,424
I have to be back by 10:30.

574
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,564
Sure, okay. Um...

575
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,802
I'll pick you up here at 7:00?

576
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,327
Okay.

577
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,962
Crazy, right?
Tommy Ross and Carrie White.

578
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:49,356
Where have you been?
I was worried sick. Come on. Come inside.

579
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,334
- I'm sorry I'm late, Mama.
- Just get inside.

580
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,530
Your supper's cold.
I'm going to have to heat it up.

581
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,040
I didn't know...

582
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:03,711
You're immodest.

583
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,383
I didn't know where you were.
I didn't know.

584
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,353
No, Mama. I took a bus to Main Street
and I bought cloth for a dress.

585
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:14,754
You are not to go anywhere
but to school and back. You know that.

586
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,693
Mama, before you say anything else,
I've been asked to prom.

587
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,791
Mama, I've been asked to prom.

588
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,570
Oh, God, why?

589
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,273
It's next Saturday and
he's a very nice boy.

590
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,072
And he'll come and meet you before
and he promised to have me home by 10:30.

591
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,711
- No, no, no.
- I already accepted.

592
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,076
I know this scares you.

593
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,575
It scares me, too.

594
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,748
The other kids,

595
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,882
they think I'm weird.

596
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,085
But I don't want to be.

597
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,421
I have to try to be a whole person.

598
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,894
Before it's too late.

599
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,206
He'll hurt you.

600
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:10,012
No, Mama.

601
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,448
No, Mama, there are bad people,
but not Tommy.

602
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,750
He's good.
You'll like him. He's a very nice boy.

603
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,086
Boys, boys. After the blood,

604
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:20,089
comes the boys sniffing,
slobbering like dogs.

605
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,457
Stop it, Mama.

606
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,260
He's going to paw at you until he finds
where that blood smell comes from.

607
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,696
He's going to take you, Carrie,
in his car out to the wilderness,

608
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,931
out where it's cold
and the roadhouses are and the whiskey.

609
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:30,232
Stop being so crazy.

610
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,500
You tell that boy you're not going.

611
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,635
No.

612
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,570
We'll move from here.
We're never going to stop moving.

613
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,505
You're going to go to your closet
and you're going to pray.

614
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,874
You're going to get in there
and you're going to pray for forgiveness.

615
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,274
No, never again, Mama!

616
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:56,958
Mama, stand up.

617
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,132
Mama, stand up!

618
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,035
Mama, I'm going.

619
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:16,372
- Witch.
- I'm not a witch, Mama.

620
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:18,748
There are no witches.

621
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,883
The devil's got her now.
Like he did before.

622
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:23,919
It's not the devil, Mama.
There are other people out there like me

623
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,021
who can do what I can do.

624
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,957
You poor child.
Don't you know he's working through you?

625
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,226
Mama, it's inherited.
It was passed down from Grandma

626
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,560
and it skipped you.

627
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,997
You know that. Maybe it came from Daddy.

628
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:37,432
He gave me a cancer.
I thought you were cancer.

629
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,830
- That's awful. Don't say that.
- She's lost to me.

630
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,409
Pray all you want, Mama, but I'm going.

631
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,411
And nothing's going to stop me.

632
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,715
And I don't want to talk about it anymore.

633
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,169
What are we doing?

634
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,365
What does this have to do
with Carrie White?

635
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:19,771
Baby, you said
you wanted us to do something about her.

636
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:28,951
It's a piggy!

637
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,056
Here, piggy, piggy.

638
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:36,792
Here, piggy, piggy.

639
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,233
It smells like shit in here.

640
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:42,156
Chris, pick one. Pick one
that looks like her.

641
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,595
Pig's blood for a pig.

642
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,504
That one.

643
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:56,769
Go on.

644
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,283
One quick swing, all right?

645
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:02,782
I got this.

646
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:09,592
Don't worry, little piggy,

647
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,788
Uncle Jack is going
to bash your head right in.

648
00:52:12,565 --> 00:52:13,829
You're not going to feel one...

649
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,695
Shut up! Do it already. Jesus.

650
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:23,265
I can't.

651
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,641
God, you guys are such goddamn pussies.

652
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,867
Shut up!

653
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:30,643
I'm sorry, Billy.

654
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,497
Come on, you got this.

655
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,741
All right, it's just one quick slice and...

656
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:02,339
Oh, my God.

657
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,544
Good job, baby.

658
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:30,004
Sue. Hey, are you okay?

659
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,884
There we go.

660
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,761
Billy. Hurry up.

661
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,801
Oh, my God.

662
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:09,038
When the time comes,
I'll let you pull the rope, okay?

663
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,336
Oh, I plan on it.

664
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,278
Did you guys see Sue today?

665
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,110
She looked awful.

666
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,581
I know Chris isn't coming.

667
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:53,742
She's suspended.

668
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,117
Do you think she'll crash?

669
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:56,439
You never know with Chris, right?

670
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,633
So, I think I'm going to
have the after-party.

671
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,187
No.

672
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,630
- What do you think?
- Down?

673
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:12,790
No.

674
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,337
Yeah.

675
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,274
Whoo!

676
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,403
Will you pin it on me, Mama?

677
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,036
Red.

678
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,083
I might have known it would be red.

679
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,312
It's pink.

680
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:11,889
I can see your dirty pillows.
Everyone will.

681
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,455
Breasts, Mama.

682
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:19,395
Breasts. You have them
and every woman has them.

683
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,600
Take off that dress, Carrie.

684
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:23,528
No.

685
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:26,475
Take it off and we'll burn it together
and pray for forgiveness.

686
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:27,976
Mama, it's modest.

687
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,912
Call that boy and tell
him you're not going.

688
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,448
You just tell him you're sick.

689
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,816
I don't want you to get hurt.

690
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:36,012
Or you could just be happy for me.

691
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,222
Mama, stop hurting yourself.

692
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:46,687
You know it's not going to make me stay.

693
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,099
He's not coming. It's a trick.

694
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,464
Same as always.

695
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,443
He's going to come.

696
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:02,878
They're going to laugh at you.

697
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,213
They're all going to laugh at you.

698
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:06,315
Mama, stop it.

699
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,150
I'm nervous enough as it is.

700
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,179
Thank you, sir.

701
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:22,564
You see, Mama?

702
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,066
You see, it's all going to be okay.

703
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,768
Oh, repent. It's not too late.

704
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:30,138
Mama, don't ruin this for me.
I'll be home early.

705
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,674
I'm going to have to
tell that boy the truth

706
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,142
that your father took me
and you were born of sin.

707
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,103
- You'll say nothing, Mama.
- And from that sin...

708
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,849
From that sin was born another.

709
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,217
The worst sin.

710
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:43,986
"A man or a woman who is a witch

711
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,521
among you is to be put to death."

712
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,682
"You are to stone them."

713
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,359
I'm warning you, Mama.

714
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,622
The devil's hand.

715
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,085
Please don't do this.

716
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,467
There will be a judgment, Carrie.

717
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:01,136
As Jezebel fell from the tower, you too...

718
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,611
Mama, you're not going to say
another word until I'm gone.

719
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:34,861
Mommy, I'm sorry.

720
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:40,475
I love you.

721
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,247
I'll be home early.

722
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,245
Hi.

723
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,017
Hi.

724
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,220
Do I look okay?

725
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,795
You look beautiful.

726
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,820
Tommy, can we wait a minute?

727
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,816
Yeah, sure,
we can wait as long as you want.

728
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:09,998
Are you scared?

729
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,228
They're not that bad.

730
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,332
Besides, I need you in there.

731
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,275
Dancing by myself all night,
I'd look awful silly.

732
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,306
Here, let me fix this.

733
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,183
I think this is supposed
to go on your wrist.

734
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:34,947
There.

735
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,893
Are you ready?

736
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,196
God, you look handsome, Ross.

737
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:16,290
Dawson!

738
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:20,502
Don't worry. If they kill each
other, I'll dance with you.

739
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:23,505
Carrie, this is my best buddy,
George Dawson.

740
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,541
And this is his girlfriend, Erika.
She goes to Dover.

741
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:27,531
Hi.

742
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,682
Come on, I'll show you the table.

743
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,717
I love your dress. Where did you get it?

744
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,119
I made it.

745
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,653
No kidding. Really?

746
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,246
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

747
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,130
Do you want to dance?

748
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:06,505
Or, if you want,
we could wait for a slower song.

749
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:08,172
Yeah.

750
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:13,616
I'll be back.

751
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,389
Miss Desjardin.

752
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,229
You look beautiful.

753
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:25,233
I'll let you two ladies talk.

754
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:27,569
Uh, do you want some punch?

755
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,604
I heard Greg and Harry spiked it.

756
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:30,765
Really?

757
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:33,299
No, I'm just kidding.

758
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,383
You're doing okay?

759
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,147
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

760
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:03,796
Listen.

761
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,138
Do you really have to be home so early?

762
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:12,814
I promised.

763
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:14,783
Yeah, I know. I understand.

764
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:18,587
But, um, a bunch of people,
we're going to the Cavalier after.

765
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,681
- That's okay.
- What is?

766
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,059
I know you want to hang out
with your friends, and that's...

767
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,126
No.

768
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,523
It's a slow song.

769
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:32,625
No.

770
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:34,236
Yeah. Come on.

771
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,371
No, Tommy. I've never danced before.

772
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,974
- It's okay.
- No, I can't. I can't do it.

773
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:41,843
You can't go to prom
and not have at least one dance.

774
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:42,944
I can't.

775
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:46,437
Carrie White,
will you have this dance with me?

776
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:52,681
Come on.

777
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,023
Come on.

778
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:11,066
It's so easy.
Take this hand in my hand. Like this, see?

779
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,043
You're going to put this hand
on my shoulder.

780
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:16,511
And I put my hand on your hip.

781
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,977
Then we sway.

782
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,146
See, it's easy.

783
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,985
You've got nothing to worry about.

784
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:25,715
And you're good, you're a good learner.

785
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,624
And then, if you want to get fancy with it,

786
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,650
we can do the <i>Dancing With The Stars.</i>

787
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,158
- Yeah.
- No.

788
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:34,887
Yeah. Ready? Look.

789
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,832
To the first one.

790
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,605
This is fun, right?

791
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,096
Tommy, why am I here?

792
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,198
Because I invited you.

793
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,393
But why?

794
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,960
Carrie, we're here.

795
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:18,873
We're at prom.
I'm having such a great time with you.

796
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,236
You are?

797
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:23,400
Yeah.

798
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:27,879
And I hope
that you're having a good time with me.

799
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:29,408
Yeah.

800
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,048
So, what do you say
we dance a little longer,

801
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:41,296
and then we see which poor fool
they crown King and Queen,

802
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:43,891
and then we go to the Cavalier?

803
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:48,626
And I'll have you home by 10:30.
How does that sound to you?

804
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:52,430
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

805
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,210
Maybe 11:00.

806
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,405
Whatever you want.

807
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,278
11:00.

808
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:41,289
<i>All right, everyone,
take your seats. Take your seats.</i>

809
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,858
<i>It's now time to vote for your King</i>

810
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:46,987
<i>and Queen of the prom. All right.</i>

811
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:53,134
<i>Ballots are on the table.
Everyone gets their own, please.</i>

812
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,126
<i>Guys, take your seats.</i>

813
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:56,627
Here.

814
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:02,372
<i>Make an "X" beside
the candidate of your choice.</i>

815
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:04,546
<i>Let's have the best prom ever.</i>

816
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:05,775
<i>Whoo!</i>

817
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:07,512
<i>All right.</i>

818
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,396
Tommy, we're on here.

819
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:22,464
Don't you want to be on there?

820
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:23,832
Do you?

821
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,166
Why not?

822
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:26,935
If we win, the only thing that happens is

823
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,699
we have to go up there on those thrones,

824
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,906
wave a scepter around
while they play the school song,

825
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:35,502
and then, uh, do a little dance
so everyone can see how idiotic we look.

826
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,546
They are beautiful.

827
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,242
You're beautiful.

828
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:44,346
So, who do we vote for?

829
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,122
I guess they're more
your crowd than mine.

830
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,244
I don't really have a crowd.

831
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,381
Well, I think we vote for ourselves, right?

832
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:54,018
No. No, don't vote for us.

833
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,131
To the devil with false modesty.

834
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,012
To the devil.

835
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,746
- Hurt yourself?
- No.

836
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,756
To my boy, George Dawson,
to the Fearsome Four,

837
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:24,893
Mike, Matt, Brian, and Brad.
I'm going to miss you guys.

838
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:27,158
- All set?
- Oh, yeah.

839
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,098
Good luck, kids. You've got my vote.

840
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,236
More ballots for you.

841
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,397
Hey, girl.

842
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:07,935
Here you go.

843
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,573
As soon as that bucket goes, we run.

844
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:14,094
We don't stick around for the laughs
or the screams or anything.

845
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:15,536
All right?

846
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,208
You got it?

847
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:21,109
Are you listening? Hey.

848
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,518
- What?
- When they get up there,

849
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,386
what's happening?
You're pulling the rope and when the...

850
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,789
- Shut up so I can hear.
- Hey. Listen to me. Listen.

851
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,024
If you get caught
and you say anything about what we did,

852
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:31,626
I will fucking kill you.

853
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,595
This isn't what
you bitches did in the shower.

854
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:34,862
This is criminal assault.

855
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,965
This is fucking jail time if we're caught.

856
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:38,126
I get it.

857
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:53,877
Hey. Whatever happens tonight,
you're Queen, okay?

858
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:58,349
And the results are in.
And it was very, very close.

859
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:04,926
A drum roll, please.

860
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:10,892
By one vote, our winners are...

861
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,998
Tommy Ross and Carrie White!

862
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,407
Come on.

863
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,907
Way to go, Carrie.

864
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:55,276
Heather, where's Chris?

865
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:57,435
What are you talking about? She's not here.

866
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,325
Hey, what's wrong?
Come on, go. You can do this.

867
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:18,827
We are fucking doing this.
It's too late to go back now.

868
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,628
Ewen High...

869
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:24,739
I give you your newly crowned
King and Queen of the prom,

870
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,936
Tommy Ross and Carrie White.

871
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,078
- Pull it!
- Shut up, Billy!

872
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:40,687
- Chris.
- Sue?

873
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:46,294
Sue.

874
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:48,136
What are you doing?
Come on. Come on, let's go.

875
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:50,356
No! Miss Desjardin, it's not me.
It's Chris.

876
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:51,931
Pull it, Billy, pull it!

877
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:53,334
Don't ruin this for Carrie.

878
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:54,859
- It's not me!
- Come on. Out.

879
01:12:58,607 --> 01:12:59,847
- Let her have this.
- No, wait!

880
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,544
What the hell?

881
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:51,050
<i>Plug it up!</i>

882
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,495
<i>Please help me!</i>

883
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,399
<i>Plug it up!</i>

884
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,908
Carrie, wait. Carrie.

885
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,108
<i>Help me.</i>

886
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:12,841
<i>No!</i>

887
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:18,784
<i>- Freak! Freak!
- Come on.</i>

888
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,926
Carrie, come on.

889
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:40,466
Tommy.

890
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,451
Tommy.

891
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,658
Tommy, no.

892
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,157
No.

893
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:12,668
Fuck.

894
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,709
You have an inch.

895
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:15,972
Yeah. Come on.

896
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:18,003
Go, go. Come on.

897
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:36,523
- Come on.
- Are you seeing this?

898
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:41,234
- Wait.
- Come on.

899
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,583
There's been an explosion.

900
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:07,495
Don't panic!

901
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:11,524
Bleachers!

902
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:39,050
We have to get to the door.

903
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:40,285
Nicki!

904
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,664
- Lizzy!
- Nicki!

905
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,756
- Come on! We got to go!
- Okay.

906
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,100
Tina, come on!

907
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:20,329
We're all going to die!

908
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:21,964
Come on!

909
01:19:07,258 --> 01:19:08,843
What are you doing? What are you doing?

910
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:11,479
- Nothing.
- Do you think this is a fucking game?

911
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,811
Shut up.

912
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,608
What are we going to do?

913
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,919
We're going to leave town
and we're never going to come back.

914
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:26,925
Okay? It's okay. It's going to be okay.

915
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:28,229
Okay.

916
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:55,152
Oh, my God! Watch out!

917
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:06,199
Shit town!

918
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:08,269
Go, move!

919
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,671
Oh, my God.

920
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,306
It's Carrie.

921
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:20,945
Run her down.

922
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:22,505
Kill her.

923
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:25,686
Kill her, Billy. Kill her, Billy! Kill her!

924
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:26,949
Shut up! I got this.

925
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,292
Come on!

926
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:44,998
Billy?

927
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:47,130
Billy?

928
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:49,067
Billy?

929
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:52,707
No.

930
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:21,822
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

931
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,161
Mama?

932
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:29,965
Mama?

933
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:04,397
Mama?

934
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:19,179
Mama!

935
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:48,874
No.

936
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,110
No.

937
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:53,042
No.

938
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:11,995
I'm so sorry.

939
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,083
Mama?

940
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:34,887
Mama?

941
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:42,299
Oh, Mama.

942
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:44,495
Mama, you were right.

943
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,941
They laughed at me, Mommy.

944
01:25:47,575 --> 01:25:49,406
They all laughed at me.

945
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:51,568
I knew they'd hurt my little girl.

946
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,414
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.

947
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:02,956
We slept in the same bed,

948
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:05,181
lived together sinlessly.

949
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:09,656
Then one night,
I saw him look at me in that way.

950
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:13,892
And we got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

951
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:18,872
And that's when he took me.

952
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:22,543
No, Mama. I don't want to hear it.

953
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:24,945
- And I liked it.
- Mama, no.

954
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:28,541
I should have given you to God
when you were born, but...

955
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:31,341
I was weak.

956
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:34,719
And I loved you so much.

957
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,621
And I said, "God,

958
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:41,724
let me keep my little girl."

959
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,859
"Let me keep her."

960
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,164
Let's pray.

961
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:49,666
Yes, Mama.

962
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:52,703
Yes, we'll pray.

963
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:56,508
I'll be the preacher.
You'll be my congregation.

964
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:04,882
"Our Father, Who art in heaven,

965
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:07,215
hallowed be Thy name."

966
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:09,314
"Thy kingdom come,

967
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:11,682
Thy will be done

968
01:27:13,094 --> 01:27:14,561
on earth

969
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:19,230
as it is in heaven."

970
01:27:21,035 --> 01:27:22,229
Mama!

971
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:37,848
Mama, please.

972
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,655
No, Mama. Mama, please.

973
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:46,159
This isn't your fault, Carrie. It's mine.

974
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,096
- Mommy, this isn't right.
- You know the devil never dies.

975
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:52,933
He keeps coming back.
You've got to keep killin' him.

976
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:56,703
- No, Mama.
- Over and over again.

977
01:27:56,704 --> 01:27:58,604
Mama, please. Mama!

978
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:07,804
No!

979
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:10,280
No, Mama.

980
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:18,891
Mama, stop it!

981
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,323
- Carrie.
- I'm sorry.

982
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:57,664
Carrie!

983
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:03,389
Okay.

984
01:30:07,168 --> 01:30:08,567
It's okay.

985
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:20,246
It's okay. No one's going to hurt you.

986
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:24,585
No one's going to hurt you.

987
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:43,896
Carrie?

988
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,770
Let me help you, Carrie.

989
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:53,280
Why couldn't you leave me alone?

990
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,475
I'm sorry.

991
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:00,477
Look what you turned me into.

992
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:02,279
Don't hurt me, Carrie.

993
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,890
Why not?

994
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,421
I've been hurt my whole life.

995
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,634
I killed my mom.

996
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:29,142
I want her back.

997
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:33,176
I'm scared.

998
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:55,806
We've got to get out of here!

999
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:57,670
Give me your hand.

1000
01:31:57,945 --> 01:31:59,378
Give me your hand.

1001
01:32:00,615 --> 01:32:01,809
Come on!

1002
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:10,149
- It's a girl.
- What?

1003
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:11,723
You don't know?

1004
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:14,158
Oh, my God.

1005
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,832
Get out!

1006
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,867
Get out!

1007
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:57,999
It's okay.

1008
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:39,212
<i>Miss Snell,
we're trying to determine the exact role</i>

1009
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:41,781
<i>Carrie White played in the tragedy
on prom night.</i>

1010
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:45,085
You would agree that you were under
an enormous amount of stress.

1011
01:33:45,086 --> 01:33:48,021
Isn't it possible
that what you saw was a natural act?

1012
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:53,627
My boyfriend,
most of my friends, died that night,

1013
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:56,222
but I know what I saw.

1014
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:59,830
<i>You want an explanation?</i>

1015
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:02,960
<i>Carrie had some sort of power,</i>

1016
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:06,005
<i>but she was just like me,</i>

1017
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:08,299
<i>like any of you.</i>

1018
01:34:08,743 --> 01:34:10,973
<i>She had hopes and she had fears.</i>

1019
01:34:12,246 --> 01:34:13,838
<i>And we pushed her.</i>

1020
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:22,779
<i>And you can only push someone so far</i>

1021
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:26,953
<i>before they break.</i>

1022
01:35:03,931 --> 01:35:06,900
<i>I can hardly make you mine</i>

1023
01:35:07,902 --> 01:35:10,666
<i>Tell it to you all the time</i>

1024
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:16,733
<i>At the end of a long day
and when I wake</i>

1025
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:22,005
<i>If you could just give me a sign</i>

1026
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:26,486
<i>We could leave it all behind</i>

1027
01:35:28,155 --> 01:35:32,057
<i>Stop taking the long way before we play</i>

1028
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:39,932
<i>I don't think I can make it
and I know you're the one</i>

1029
01:35:43,504 --> 01:35:47,565
<i>Staring into the tears like a loaded gun</i>

1030
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:25,010
<i>Well, I can hardly make you mine</i>

1031
01:36:26,213 --> 01:36:28,841
<i>Tell it to you all the time</i>

1032
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:35,114
<i>But you never wanted, but you had to take</i>

1033
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:40,819
<i>So I can never give you up</i>

1034
01:36:41,862 --> 01:36:44,854
<i>I guess it's 'cause it's just a crush</i>

1035
01:36:46,367 --> 01:36:50,428
<i>Before the end of a long
day and then I wake</i>

1036
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:58,669
<i>But I know you're not the one or the only</i>

1037
01:37:03,117 --> 01:37:06,712
<i>But we both know what
it's like to be lonely</i>

1038
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:12,892
<i>Well, these fantasies, they left us lonely</i>

1039
01:37:12,893 --> 01:37:16,124
<i>Boy, just bring all your love back to me</i>

1040
01:37:18,465 --> 01:37:21,832
<i>I guess for now this is how it'll be</i>

1041
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:29,335
<i>I don't think I can make it
Oh, you're the one</i>

1042
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:37,580
<i>Staring into the tears like a loaded gun</i>

1043
01:37:40,988 --> 01:37:45,186
<i>I don't think I can make it
Oh, you're the one</i>

1044
01:37:48,896 --> 01:37:53,390
<i>Staring into the tears like a loaded gun</i>

1044
01:37:54,305 --> 01:38:54,491
