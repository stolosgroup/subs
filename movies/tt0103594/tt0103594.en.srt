2
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,732
500 years ago, Spain was a nation
gripped by fear and superstition, ...

3
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,145
ruled by the crown and
a ruthless inquisition...

4
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:36,807
that persecuted men
for daring to dream.

5
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:39,852
One man challenged this power.

6
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:44,680
Driven by his sense of destiny,
he crossed the Sea of Darkness...

7
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,289
in search of honor, gold
and the greater glory of God.

8
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,050
<i>Of all the words my father wrote,
and there were many.</i>

9
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,930
<i>I remember these the most:</i>

10
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,130
<i>"Nothing that results from human progress,
is achieved with unanimous consent. "</i>

11
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,330
<i>"And those who are enlightened
before the others...</i>

12
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,970
<i>"... are condemned to pursue
that light in spite of others. "</i>

13
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,870
<i>"There was a time
when the New World didn't exist. "</i>

14
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,150
<i>"The sun set in the west on a notion,
where no man had dared to venture. "</i>

15
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,410
<i>"And beyond that,
infinity!"</i>

16
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,050
Look!

17
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,070
Now, half of the hull has gone.

18
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,010
Good.

19
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,570
And now?

20
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,110
Now, I only see the mast.

21
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,350
Close your eyes.
And don't cheat!

22
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,470
I'm watching.

23
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,670
Open them when I tell you.

24
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,790
Once I asked my father
where he wanted to go.

25
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,670
He replied:

26
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,690
"I want to travel all over the seas. "

27
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,830
"I want to get behind the weather. "

28
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,010
Now.

29
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,290
It's gone.

30
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,370
What does it tell you?

31
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,390
It's round, like this.

32
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,370
Round!

33
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,730
Come on, lad!

34
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,390
Good morning, Father.

35
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,470
Diego!

36
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,170
Kiss your brother, Diego.

37
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,370
I have something for you.

38
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,530
You'll be heard
at the University of Salamanca.

39
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,490
God! That's in a week!

40
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,230
That's what it says.

41
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,170
How did you manage it?

42
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,890
With some difficulty.

43
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,930
I had to promise them,
you weren't a total fool.

44
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,910
Marco Polo said he found
Earthly Paradise off the coast of China.

45
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,270
Do you believe this?

46
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,410
I believe in Paradise and Hell.
And I do believe that both can be earthly.

47
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,350
Now,
let's go through this again.

48
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,190
Why do you wish to sail west?

49
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,350
To open a new route to Asia.

50
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,970
Asia is the richest Kingdom.
The land of spices and gold.

51
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,350
At the moment there are
only two ways of reaching it.

52
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,210
By sea, sailing around the
African continent...

53
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,730
...the journey takes a year...

54
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,730
...or by land. But the Turks
have closed this route to all Christians.

55
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,690
There is a third way...

56
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,030
...by sailing west
across the ocean sea.

57
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,710
The distance is unknown.

58
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,630
It's said to be infinite.

59
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,890
Superstition!

60
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,075
I believe the Indies are
no more than...

61
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,530
...750 leagues
west of the Canary Islands.

62
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,070
How can you be so certain?

63
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,510
The calculations of Toscanelli,
Marin de Tyr...

64
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,570
- ... Esdras...
- Esdras is a Jew!

65
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,930
So was Christ!

66
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,110
Two minutes
and already you're a dead man.

67
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,130
- For telling the truth?
- Yes!

68
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,870
They're burning people for less.

69
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,990
The men you're about to confront...

70
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,910
...have no emotions.

71
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,630
You must learn to control
your passion.

72
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,430
Passion is something
one cannot control.

73
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,190
You need the blessing
of this commission.

74
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,610
If they say no...

75
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,410
...you would have to give up,
my son.

76
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,610
I will not give up.

77
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,390
Is it ambition?

78
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,710
We've been told lies
for so long...

79
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,090
...they said that
this was flat as this table...

80
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,910
...that monsters guard
the edge of the world!

81
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,750
I will not be told what to be afraid of
and what not to be afraid of!

82
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,910
I want to find out for myself.

83
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,190
I just hope your passion
will be contagious, my son.

84
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,390
Look, father!

85
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,250
Fernando!

86
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,170
Do you repent your sins...

87
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,210
...in the name of the Father...

88
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,350
...the Son and the Holy Spirit?

89
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,550
Burnings in the square!

90
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,530
They agreed to see me
in a week in Salamanca.

91
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,070
If my project is accepted,
I could be gone for years.

92
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,710
I know!

93
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,310
I haven't given you much of a life.

94
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,750
That's true, I have a child
by a man who won't marry me!

95
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,410
Are you going to argue?

96
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,530
I'd love to argue with you
more often, but you're never here.

97
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,050
Unfortunately, Senor Colombus,
that is precisely where our opinions differ.

98
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,710
You're familiar with Aristotle?
Eratosthenes? Ptolemeus?

99
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,910
I am, Your Eminence.

100
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,750
Then you cannot ignore that according
to their calculations, the circumference...

101
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:27,190
...of the Earth is approximately
22,000 leagues or more...

102
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:29,750
...which makes the ocean uncrossable.

103
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:33,570
But you may have found
new evidence...

104
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,850
...proving these great men
of knowledge are totally mistaken!

105
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,950
Your Excellencies are aware of
Marin de Tyr?

106
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:46,550
We are!

107
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,850
Then you are also aware that
his theories contradict Ptolemeus.

108
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,950
De Tyr believes the ocean to be
only 750 leagues.

109
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,590
DifferentiaToscanelli...

110
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,530
...and the French Cardinal D'Ailly,
both think that Marin De Tyr...

111
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,950
...is accurate in his calculations.

112
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:09,250
And therefore
that the ocean can be crossed.

113
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,310
Silence!

114
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:17,070
Gentlemen, are we here to examine
this man's proposal, or not?

115
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,470
Let's suppose for the moment
that Marin de Tyr is right.

116
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,190
Senor Colombus, in your opinion then,
how long would the voyage be?

117
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,490
Seven weeks.

118
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,010
- Six, during the summer months.
- Marin de Tyr is wrong!

119
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,870
He's been corrected many times, over
the centuries by the world's finest geographers.

120
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,890
Your voyage, Senor Colombus,
would take a year.

121
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,030
Suppose you cross this ocean
and suppose you reach Asia...

122
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,810
...what would Spain do there?

123
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,990
Trade, Your Excellency!

124
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,990
According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom
of China is one of the richest of the world.

125
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,890
Even the meanest buildings
are roofed with gold.

126
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,070
Is that all that interests you?
Gold?

127
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,355
No!

128
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,830
I'll bring these people
to the world of God...

129
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:11,270
...and make them subjects
of Castille and Aragon!

130
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,510
Instead of a Realm...

131
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,755
...Spain will become an Empire!

132
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,490
If God intended
our proximity to Asia...

133
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,650
...do you believe that he would have
waited for you to show it to the world?

134
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,050
He chose a carpenter's son
to reveal Himself to the world!

135
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,670
So you consider yourself
"The Chosen One"?

136
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,510
Asia can be found to the west...

137
00:15:40,545 --> 00:15:43,890
...and I will prove it!

138
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,790
The Treasurer of Spain
honours us with his presence.

139
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:03,730
The State has its reasons to be interested
in this man's proposition, Your Eminence.

140
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:06,470
With all due respect,
the judgement is ours.

141
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,710
Why not?

142
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,610
And what if he were right?

143
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,490
I've always found
such independent minds dangerous.

144
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,090
If the man had wings,
no doubt, he'd return from the skies...

145
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,690
...tells the heavens are empty!

146
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,770
I'd deplore the loss of
such a potential opportunity for Spain, though.

147
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,170
Especially
over this point of geography.

148
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,090
It's not a point of geography.
It's a point of reality.

149
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,410
This man is a mercenary.

150
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,010
States often use mercenaries...

151
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:45,850
...if it is to the benefit,
the stability of Spain, no?

152
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,610
It should be as much your concern
as it is mine.

153
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,210
Am I to understand, that you would
use your influence to assist this heretic?

154
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:02,610
Well, you know, Your Eminence,
the fascinating thing about power...

155
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,150
...is that, what could be given
so effortlessly...

156
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,310
...so easily be taken away!

157
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,990
And therefore nothing could justify
the participation of Your Majesties...

158
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,650
...in a venture that relies upon
such feeble assumptions...

159
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,830
...and which any man of knowledge...

160
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,070
...would take to be impractical,
if not impossible.

161
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,470
They didn't listen.
They don't want to listen.

162
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,370
- You mustn't give way to despair, you must wait.
- Wait?

163
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,590
I've waited seven years already,
how much longer do you want me to wait?

164
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,930
If God intends you to go,
you will go!

165
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,655
- Damn God!
- Christopher!

166
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,790
Damn all of you! You all sit at your desks,
concocting theories based on what?

167
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:04,410
You never leave the protection
of your gardens. Go out...

168
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,130
...find out what the world is about
and then tell me something I can accept.

169
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,430
These don't mean anything,
they are full of assumptions!

170
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,290
Just lies!

171
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,410
All of it, lies!

172
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,510
All of it, lies!

173
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,770
Father?

174
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,410
You must not speak to a man
doing penance.

175
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,110
And what can you do?

176
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,190
Nothing.
That's the point, Fernando.

177
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,690
Fernando!

178
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,170
Senor Colombus?

179
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,450
I've been looking
all over Sevilla for you.

180
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,830
Never expected to find a sailor
in a monastery.

181
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,695
My name is Pinzon.

182
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,950
Martin Alonzo Pinzon.
I'm a ship owner from Palos.

183
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,630
Is he a spy?

184
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,370
What is it?
Are you a trappist?

185
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,330
Vow of silence?

186
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,435
Penance?

187
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,510
It's just my luck.

188
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,550
Listen,
I'll do the talking for both of us.

189
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,195
You just nod, agreed?

190
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,410
Just as I do with the wife.

191
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,150
I know that the commission
turned you down, right?

192
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:38,630
What do you expect?
You're just a foreigner.

193
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,830
And I want to help you.

194
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,150
You wonder why I believe in you?
I'm a seaman, too.

195
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,090
We don't like to be told
where to go or not to go.

196
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,510
I don't look like much
but I have friends...

197
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,990
...important friends!

198
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,310
A banker, for example.

199
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,950
He finances me.
He's name is Santangel.

200
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,950
Have you heard of him?

201
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,510
He can get you
in audience with the Queen.

202
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,155
You know why?

203
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,330
She owes him money.
That's for it is.

204
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,050
You, me, the Queen, the world and its
mysteries! Everybody owes somebody something.

205
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,130
What do you say?

206
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,970
- Where can I meet this man?
- Here, right there!

207
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,310
May I ask you a question,
Don Luis?

208
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,570
Yes!

209
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,650
Why do you want to help me?

210
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,270
Faith...

211
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,210
...hope...

212
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,290
...charity!

213
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,030
But greater than all these...

214
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,010
...is banking.

215
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,810
Wait, Senores!

216
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,270
The Moors built Granada
centuries ago.

217
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,150
Now, we've taken it back.

218
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,530
But it's a tragic victory for us.
We're losing a great culture.

219
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,710
But I suppose there's a price
to be paid for every victory.

220
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:09,830
Isn't there Senor Colombus?

221
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,110
Don Luis de Santangel...

222
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,710
...to see Don Gabriel Sanchez.

223
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,790
Luis!

224
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,790
Senor Columbus, Senor Pinzon.

225
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,670
Rise!
Come forward!

226
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:39,170
I should not even be listening to you
since my Council has said no.

227
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,550
Santangel tells me
you're a man of honour and sincerety.

228
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:46,250
Sanchez,
you're not completely mad.

229
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,650
No more than the woman who said
she would take Granada from the Moors.

230
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:57,410
They believe the ocean is
uncrossable, Senor Columbus.

231
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,070
What did they say about Granada,
before today?

232
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,330
That it was impregnable!

233
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,150
I cannot ignore the verdict
of my Council.

234
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,390
Surely you can do anything
you want.

235
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,110
How little you know!

236
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,770
Why should I believe in you,
Senor Colombus?

237
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,715
May I speak freely?

238
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,330
You show no inclination
to speak otherwise.

239
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,490
I know what I see.

240
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,430
I see someone who doesn't
accept the world as it is.

241
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,630
Who's not afraid.

242
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,570
- I see a woman who thinks what if...
- A woman?

243
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,630
Forgive me...

244
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,870
...but you're the only Queen I know.

245
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:09,250
Then that makes us equal,
you're the only navigator that I know.

246
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,750
How old are you,
Senor Colombus?

247
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:19,210
Thirty-nine, Your Majesty.

248
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,510
And you?

249
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,250
I'm forty.

250
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,790
You will be informed
of our decision.

251
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,350
Actually, I thought
you were younger than I.

252
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,790
The cost would be ruinous.

253
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,070
No more than the cost of
two state banquets.

254
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:20,830
Two banquets,
for new lands and spices...

255
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,950
...and gold!

256
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:26,030
What are you saying, Sanchez?

257
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:31,370
Only that if he's right,
we have everything to gain.

258
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,950
And if he's wrong...

259
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,010
...we've so little to lose.

260
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,275
Tell me what he says.

261
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,930
He demands to be made a Knight...

262
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,710
...with the right to wear
the Golden Spurs...

263
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,790
...and that he will receive
the title "Don Christopher Colombus"...

264
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:14,230
...which will be extended
to his descendants.

265
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,595
So, what else?

266
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,570
He'll be named
"Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea"...

267
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,755
...Viceroy of the West Indies...

268
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:27,810
...Governor of all islands
or lands discovered...

269
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,170
...or as will be discovered
by him...

270
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,590
The highest titles of nobility,
Your Excellency...

271
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:40,230
...to an immigrant
sheltered by monks!

272
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,750
Furthermore...

273
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,930
...he'll receive
one tenth of all wealth or monies...

274
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:57,490
...precious gems, pearls, metals,
spices and other lucrative sources...

275
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:01,930
...acquired under his jurisdiction.

276
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,490
You worry too much, Francisco!

277
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,790
This man will have
to lower his demands.

278
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,930
Believe me!

279
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,830
He will!

280
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,730
I won't!

281
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:25,630
So we have considered your proposal
very carefuly, Senor Columbus. It is excessive.

282
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,790
- The responsibility is equally excessive.
- If you consider of the contract...

283
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,190
- I have given you that!
- No!

284
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,830
- No?
- No!

285
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:34,331
No!

286
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,110
And I thought he was an idealist.

287
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,730
Idealism and ambition
are not incompatible.

288
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:44,230
I've fought too hard.
Now you expect me to take all the risks...

289
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:46,670
- ... while you take the profit?
- No!

290
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,230
- I'm not a servant...
- Senor Colombus...

291
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:53,610
...you are in no position
to bargain with me.

292
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,195
I'm not bargaining.

293
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,250
Then you are too ambitious.

294
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,510
And were you never ambitious?

295
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,350
Or, is ambition only a virtue among
nobles, a fault for the rest of us?

296
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:15,350
If you won't accept this proposal,
we can simply find someone who will.

297
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:20,510
If you can do that, Excellency...

298
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,410
...I'll become a monk!

299
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,130
Your Majesty!

300
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:57,070
He'll become a monk!

301
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,210
It would be a pity,
wouldn't it?

302
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,910
Call him back!

303
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,590
She said "yes".

304
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,110
If I ever come back,
I swear...

305
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,390
I'm not asking you
to swear to anything.

306
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,410
I don't want you
to wait for me.

307
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,450
That's something
you can't decide for me.

308
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,290
Forgive me Father, I have sinned.

309
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,950
I am listening, my son.

310
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:24,490
Father...
I have betrayed my family...

311
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,430
...I betrayed my men...

312
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,750
...and I betrayed you.

313
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,910
I lied!

314
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,050
The journey will be longer
than I said.

315
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,130
How long?

316
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,615
I'm not sure.

317
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,370
How could anyone know.
It could be twice the distance.

318
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,235
You must tell them.

319
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,230
- You must tell your men.
- If I tell them, they wouldn't follow me.

320
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:51,510
You know I'm right, father.
You must trust me.

321
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:56,470
You must speak to them.
If you don't, I will!

322
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,330
You are bounded by an oath.

323
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,890
May God forgive you.

324
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,430
I believed in you.

325
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,030
Give me absolution.

326
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,990
Give me absolution, Father!

327
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,490
I absolve you of your sins!

328
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,570
Enter!

329
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,490
Mendez!

330
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,350
Sit down!

331
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,490
Some wine?

332
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,830
What is it, Mendez?
Speak!

333
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:16,710
They wonder how you know our position
since we've no sight of land days ago.

334
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,130
And what do you think, Mendez?

335
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,610
I know you're navigating
by the stars like the Moors do...

336
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,570
...but I don't know how?

337
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,430
Take this quadrant, Mendez.

338
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,910
Find the North Star.

339
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,930
Steady yourself!

340
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:07,090
Keep the plumbline vertical.

341
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,790
And don't move!

342
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:19,290
A mistake of one degree
and we'll be off 600 leagues.

343
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,110
What do you read?

344
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,570
-28.
- That's it!

345
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:29,230
28th parallel!
And we'll follow it until we reach land.

346
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:34,570
How do you know that
we'll find land on the 28th parallel?

347
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,710
I don't!

348
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:52,369
Mark!

349
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,690
- Mark 26, Sir!
- Mark!

350
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,890
Mark 27, Sir!

351
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:07,891
Mark!

352
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,010
Mark 28!

353
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:16,711
Mark!

354
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,510
Mark 29!

355
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:28,530
-629.
-629!

356
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,150
629, Sir?

357
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,950
I heard.

358
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:42,050
Captain, I don't understand.

359
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,690
I think I do.

360
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,210
We should've seen land.

361
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:15,370
We've been at sea nine weeks, Alonzo.
Can't be that far.

362
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,730
Can't be that near.

363
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,850
Also I don't like the smell
of this sea around here.

364
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,530
Smells like a whore!

365
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,710
'Course it does.

366
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:31,330
That's why sailors take to the sea.

367
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,410
And why does that one
take to the sea?

368
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,430
Nobody knows!

369
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,330
Never says a word.

370
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:44,450
Captain Pinzon requests
permission to board.

371
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,670
You misled me.
You lied to me.

372
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,870
We are way past 750 leagues.

373
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,170
- Six days ago, yes.
- You must be mad!

374
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,970
Keep your voice down, Pinzon!

375
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,570
- We're in the verge of a mutiny, Colombus!
- You think I don't know that?

376
00:42:06,605 --> 00:42:08,850
We're lost!

377
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:15,110
- The land is there, I know it.
- No, you don't know anything!

378
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,915
Listen Colombus, these are my ships, right?
So I'm telling you we are turning back.

379
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,870
And then what? Half of the water
has gone, the rest is nearly putrid!

380
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,110
I shouldn't have listened to you.
You bloody...

381
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,250
Listen!
Pinzon, Pinzon!

382
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,690
All we can do...

383
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,310
...is go forward.

384
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,530
The land is there...
The land is close!

385
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:41,110
You tell them that.
You say that to them!

386
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:58,010
God doesn't want us to cross
this ocean. This voyage is cursed.

387
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:02,250
We set sail for greed.
God has abandoned us.

388
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:07,010
The voyage is cursed.
There are signs.

389
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,830
Juanito has the voice of an angel.

390
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:23,950
What comes out of his mouth is blessed,
Alonzo, what comes out of yours is cursed.

391
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,710
Listen to me!

392
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,215
Every man is afraid
who does something for the first time.

393
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:40,310
But those who overcome their fears
will rightly earn their rewards.

394
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:45,110
I don't know if it's God will
that we should cross this ocean.

395
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:51,730
But I am certain it is you
who puts fear into our hearts.

396
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:58,810
We cannot be lost as long as
we keep faith in God and in ourselves.

397
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:05,110
In time...

398
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:10,390
...they will talk about the courage of the
first men who crossed this ocean, and returned.

399
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,990
And then you will be able
to say to them...

400
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:15,510
...I was on the Pinta...

401
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,650
...I was on the Nina...

402
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:21,950
...and the Santa Maria.

403
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,370
This jacket to the first man
who sights land.

404
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,550
And 10,000 maravedis
a year for life!

405
00:44:32,585 --> 00:44:36,610
I wanna man aloft
day and night!

406
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,650
Alonzo...

407
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:54,970
...don't let this wind escape us!

408
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,850
Lucky bastard!

409
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,650
<i>Mendez!</i>

410
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,170
Mendez!

411
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:05,270
Land!

412
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:30,270
<i>25 fathoms!</i>

413
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,770
<i>24 fathoms!</i>

414
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:42,771

00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:47,772

00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:42,681
<i>13!</i>

425
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,850
There!

426
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,730
Land ho!

427
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,570
Drop anchor!

428
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:08,910
Don Christopher!

429
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,810
Excellencia!

430
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,230
By the...

431
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:01,690
...by the Grace of God!

432
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:11,990
In the name of their
Gracious Majesties of Castilla and Aragon!

433
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:31,250
By all the powers vested in me...

434
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,030
...I claim this island
and name it...

435
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,950
...San Salvador!

436
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:26,370
Don Christopher!

437
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:47,470
- Muskets!
- No!

438
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:14,750
October 21st, 1492.

439
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:18,910
I think we have returned to Eden.

440
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:24,290
Surely this is how the world was
in the beginning of time.

441
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:27,450
If the natives are
to be converted to our ways...

442
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:32,410
...then it will be by persuasion
and not by force.

443
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:38,070
I believe no man will ever see
this land again as we do, for the first time.

444
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,610
We come in peace
and with honour.

445
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:44,790
They are not savages,
neither will we be.

446
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:49,170
Treat them as you would
your own wives and children.

447
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,490
Respect their beliefs.

448
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:56,610
Pillage will be punished by the whip.
Rape, by the sword.

449
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:45,310
You!

450
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:48,990
Utapan!

451
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:51,250
Utapan?

452
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:54,670
Colombus!

453
01:01:55,190 --> 01:02:00,110
- Co... Columb...
- Colombus!

454
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,410
Co... lombus!

455
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:28,570
Where did you find this?

456
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:31,690
Cuba!

457
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:28,010
Thanks!
I've got a river of gold to piss.

458
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:54,630
Here!

459
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:02,890
- Is it gold?
- No, no!

460
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:05,030
No good, no.

461
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:47,890
Utapan!

462
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:50,835
<i>Utapan!</i>

463
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:53,290
<i>Alonzo! Alonzo!</i>

464
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:58,530
<i>Help him!</i>

465
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,170
<i>Help him!</i>

466
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:12,630
Do something!

467
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:15,050
<i>Pray for him!</i>

468
01:05:15,951 --> 01:05:18,051
<i>Pray for him!</i>

469
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:39,550
<i>With Alonzo's death, I realise
how vulnerable we are in these islands.</i>

470
01:05:39,585 --> 01:05:42,590
<i>How much we have to learn!</i>

471
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:45,310
<i>On every island...</i>

472
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:50,930
<i>...the natives welcome us
with great generosity and trust.</i>

473
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:56,550
<i>Because of our appearance
we have been mistaken for gods...</i>

474
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:59,270
<i>...and are treated accordingly.</i>

475
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:03,810
Despite the compliance of the Indians
we have not found gold in quantity...

476
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:09,590
...except for the few artefacts
they gave us as a sign of their submission.

477
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:19,190
You will speak first.

478
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:23,430
Tell him, we thank him
for his hospitality.

479
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:26,290
He knows.

480
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:31,550
Tell him, some of my men
are staying here to build a fort.

481
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:35,030
I want them to be well treated.

482
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:36,315
Tell him...

483
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:39,190
...we'll come back.
Many of us.

484
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:43,750
He said, how many?

485
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:49,590
As many as the leaves
on that tree.

486
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:53,150
And many more will follow.

487
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:58,470
Why?

488
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:02,770
To bring the word of God.

489
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:06,630
He said he has a God.

490
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:09,710
And also to bring medicine.

491
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:20,390
- He said, he...
- He has medicine!

492
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:22,590
Tell him...

493
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:25,350
...we admire his people.

494
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:41,370
He knows
you like his women and gold.

495
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:54,110
<i>Pinzon is ill...</i>

496
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:57,770
<i>...eaten up by a fever
that refuses to leave his body.</i>

497
01:09:57,790 --> 01:10:01,030
<i>We must return to Spain.</i>

498
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:05,790
39 men have volunteered
to stay behind to build a fort.

499
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:09,890
I name it, La Navidad!

500
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:31,950
<i>After 7 months,
I haven't seen any sign of civilisation...</i>

501
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:35,755
<i>...that compares
with Marco Polo's descriptions.</i>

502
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:42,250
<i>No cities, no bridges,
no temples roofed with gold.</i>

503
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:45,670
<i>The mainland still escapes me...</i>

504
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:48,470
<i>...but I know it's there.</i>

505
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:54,670
<i>My ships are not filled with
the spices and gold that I was hoping for...</i>

506
01:10:54,705 --> 01:10:58,650
<i>...but this land intoxicates
my senses and my soul.</i>

507
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:03,430
<i>And all I can think of
is to return to this untamed land.</i>

508
01:11:03,465 --> 01:11:05,710
<i>This unexplored Eden.</i>

509
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:09,830
<i>This is a chance
for a new beginning.</i>

510
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:08,290
It won't be easy
to get rid of your prophet now.

511
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:11,910
On the contrary...

512
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:16,010
...it seems to me
the man is preparing his own cross.

513
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:01,890
Let the palate enjoy
the flavour of the tobacco.

514
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:04,150
Try!

515
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:23,350
You say
this is an Indian vice?

516
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:27,710
I don't see the pleasure
that would make this is sin.

517
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:32,850
The Indians
have no such word, Moxica.

518
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:36,550
Have they such thoughts?

519
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:40,390
They come and go
as naked as God created them.

520
01:14:40,425 --> 01:14:44,130
God?
Which God?

521
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:53,830
Nature is their God.

522
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:57,050
It's as if God and Nature
were one.

523
01:14:57,150 --> 01:15:02,150
They see him in a leaf,
in a stone...

524
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:05,210
...in a shell.

525
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:10,410
The islands...

526
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:13,610
...are covered with trees.

527
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,650
Forgive me, Don Cristobal!

528
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:19,930
What about gold?

529
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:23,410
It's not the purest metal
I've ever seen.

530
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:26,010
Is there more?

531
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:33,610
We are more than gratified,
Christobal.

532
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:29,310
Excellent!

533
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:41,990
- You defende yourself well.
- For a commoner?

534
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:45,410
So...

535
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:48,790
...your second expedition, hm?

536
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:51,590
17 ships...

537
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:54,410
...and 1.500 men?

538
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:56,450
Thanks to you.

539
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:59,550
Don Christopher Colombus!
Don Francisco de Bobadilla!

540
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:01,950
He can be extremely valuable to you.

541
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:05,990
This man is
very well acquainted with our laws.

542
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:17,310
I heard that you soon be
appointing Governors for the Islands...

543
01:18:17,311 --> 01:18:21,211
...and I thought
you might consider my application.

544
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:24,930
Forgive me, Don Francisco.

545
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:28,750
Those positions are
already taken.

546
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:31,830
May I ask by whom?

547
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:35,370
By two very competent men.

548
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,410
I trust they're men of quality.

549
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:45,330
Francisco is qualified
for high administration.

550
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:47,450
Well...

551
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:50,650
...we do lack notaries.

552
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:54,630
You should contact
my administration.

553
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:59,890
- Francisco is a judge.
- Good!

554
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:02,290
We also need judges...

555
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:06,030
...except,
there are no crimes of people!

556
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:10,190
I see I was mistaken.

557
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:15,790
Colombus has no need
for my services, Sanchez.

558
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:22,490
You have a special talent
for making enemies.

559
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:25,590
Why do I have
so many already?

560
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:37,430
Don't you think to rise so high
in so short a time is a dangerous occupation?

561
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:54,930
Beatrix!

562
01:19:56,850 --> 01:20:01,930
I can arrange for the Queen to take
Fernando and Diego into her service.

563
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:05,070
It's a great honour,
Beatrix.

564
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:07,430
We couldn't hope for
anything better.

565
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:11,430
Anything better?
Better than to stay with his mother?

566
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:13,015
It's not what I meant.

567
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:16,030
- Then, what do you mean?
- I'll be gone...

568
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:18,450
...for several years.

569
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:21,630
I have enemies at the courts,
powerful enemies!

570
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:25,230
The boys bear my name
and now my titles.

571
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:27,790
This way they'll be untouchable.

572
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:31,690
And you'll be free to see them
whenever you please.

573
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:37,130
You don't realize
what you're asking.

574
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,290
I do!

575
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:44,970
I wish I could have
offered you another life.

576
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,410
I am sorry!

577
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:54,310
Don't say you're sorry,
because you're not!

578
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:56,730
You lead a life
you chose for yourself...

579
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,450
...and I chose you!

580
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:25,790
You might have given us
a choice, for Christ's sake!

581
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:26,991
I'm a map maker!

582
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:30,430
And now you're
Lieutenant-General of the West Indies...

583
01:21:30,431 --> 01:21:31,931
...congratulations, Bartolome!

584
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:34,950
He's just out of seminary
he's hardly used the sword.

585
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:37,550
I've never touched the sword!

586
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:40,130
You have plenty of time to learn.

587
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:43,150
What are you complaining about?

588
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:47,690
You both have a chance to live
the way we can only dream of.

589
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:50,790
I never shared those dreams!

590
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:53,550
Do you refuse to help me?

591
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:56,250
To help your brother?

592
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:00,290
Are you going to desert me?

593
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:08,290
You bastard!
You always had your own way.

594
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:10,770
- I have always been here to support you.
- I know.

595
01:22:10,805 --> 01:22:13,210
- I went to Portugal to help you...
- Yes, I know!

596
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:17,090
- I'm the eldest!
- How could we ever forget?

597
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:19,890
Haven't you said it enough?

598
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:24,930
Come on,
let me show you something.

599
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:28,850
Excellency!

600
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:31,330
It's about my son!

601
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:56,310
See?

602
01:22:56,490 --> 01:23:00,110
Now, you tell me,
who can I trust?

603
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:03,750
We're brothers.
A bloodline.

604
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:06,790
I need you.
Both of you!

605
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:07,670
Admiral!

606
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:11,990
The horses have arrived.
Here is the magnificent pair!

607
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:14,850
- Send them Back!
- What?

608
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:17,630
They look like mules!

609
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:21,310
I hope you have better luck
with personal!

610
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:23,050
Who did we take on today?

611
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:28,290
30 blacksmiths. 28 halberdiers.
20 carpenters.

612
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:30,070
100 farmers.

613
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:31,990
20 miners.

614
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:35,530
And Doctor Chanca,
the Royal surgeon.

615
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:39,330
Then we can count on royal health!

616
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:39,070
Fire!

617
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:42,070
Fire again!

618
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:50,870
Where are they?

619
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:02,450
Drummers, sound the advance!

620
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:52,630
Almirante!

621
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:13,090
Juanito!

622
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:27,390
Is this your New World,
Almirante?

623
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:30,050
These animals wish to learn savagery,
we shall teach them!

624
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:33,330
Three heads for every life taken.
No mercy before God!

625
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:34,290
Vamonos!

626
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:36,350
No Moxica, no!

627
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:39,330
There will be no revenge.

628
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:48,050
These were our cousins...

629
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:50,710
...our friends, our countrymen.

630
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:54,050
But you say no revenge?

631
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:57,630
We will wash this in blood
and now!

632
01:26:58,650 --> 01:27:02,710
If you want to keep your head
on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.

633
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:05,730
I lost friends, too.

634
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:08,770
39 brave men who trusted me.

635
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:12,290
You want war?
Fine.

636
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:16,590
We are 1000.
They outnumber us by 10.

637
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:19,670
Who will you kill?
Which tribe?

638
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:22,510
- We don't need to know.
- Moxica!

639
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:26,790
Try to remember
who you are talking to.

640
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:34,730
We came here to stay,
not to start a crusade.

641
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:37,870
So, we will swallow our anger.

642
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:40,990
And in the name of those
who died...

643
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:44,870
...we will accomplish
what we came for.

644
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:18,650
They're here.

645
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:08,670
There!

646
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:13,430
Guarionex!
Ricardo!

647
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:16,310
Arquebuses!

648
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:18,890
Preparen!

649
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:38,590
Ask him!

650
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:41,570
What happened to my men?

651
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:47,590
Warriors come from the sea.

652
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:50,650
Caribes.
Guarionex says...

653
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:53,010
...all fled to the hills.

654
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,270
When they came back...

655
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:56,850
...all the Spaniards had gone.

656
01:30:56,885 --> 01:30:59,610
God's mercy on them all.

657
01:31:04,730 --> 01:31:07,430
The monkey's lying.

658
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:11,570
Colomb, you talk too much.

659
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:15,290
Here they are.
We should kill them.

660
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:19,230
No!
You'll do it my way.

661
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:25,770
Tell him
we will not harm his people.

662
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:29,350
Even though we have
the power to do it.

663
01:31:30,970 --> 01:31:33,775
I'm prepared to believe him.

664
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:37,490
We will work with his people
and we want peace.

665
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:41,490
Ask if he understands.

666
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:46,310
He understands.

667
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:48,390
Will he help?

668
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:56,610
He says, you know the answer!

669
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:37,550
Moxica...
I need your horses.

670
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:40,790
My horse does no work.

671
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:43,070
We all have to work, Moxica.

672
01:34:43,130 --> 01:34:46,110
Not my horse!

673
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:53,190
Forgive me, Moxica.

674
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:57,730
But it was your horse
I was talking about.

675
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:14,130
Thank you, Moxica.

676
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:32,410
Now!

677
01:35:32,730 --> 01:35:35,730
Heave! Heave!

678
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:27,590
My dear sons...

679
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:33,970
...in unbearable heat, we are building
the first city of the New World.

680
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:37,730
I brought the plans
of a Florentine architect...

681
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:41,110
...Leonardo, da Vinci.

682
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:45,890
God willing,
we will establish his ideal city.

683
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:50,310
We are trying to adapt
to the Indian diet.

684
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:53,870
Meat is only a memory for us.

685
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:59,210
But in less than a week, the mill
will be ready to produce our first flour.

686
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:03,930
Soon, we'll be eating
our own bread.

687
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:07,150
Never again
will I underestimate its taste...

688
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:10,470
...or the simple comfort of home.

689
01:38:12,490 --> 01:38:15,430
You are always in my thoughts.

690
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:19,210
Forever, your Father.

691
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:13,530
You want her?

692
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:19,330
Then you can have her.

693
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:23,230
To the New World,
my friend.

694
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:34,510
To the Governor...

695
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:37,970
...of the mosquitos!

696
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:54,110
She's a good cook.

697
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:02,910
What kind of meat is this?

698
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:06,530
Iguana!

699
01:40:10,850 --> 01:40:12,410
What's wrong with it?
It's an Indian dish.

700
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:14,310
Well, I'm not an Indian.

701
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:17,490
You know Christopher,
I think Giacomo is right.

702
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:19,710
We can't live on corn and pepper.

703
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:23,730
The Indians can't take the heavy
plantation work, we need black slaves.

704
01:40:23,765 --> 01:40:27,090
Besides, everything rots in the
ground before it can be harvested.

705
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:31,090
Have you noticed?
The horses and pigs multiply.

706
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:35,710
I can't keep them from mounting
each other. May be it's the heat.

707
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:40,770
Well, I must confess that the heat
has a similar effect on me.

708
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:47,070
You're both right.

709
01:40:47,210 --> 01:40:49,930
But the fort must be completed
before the rains begin.

710
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:53,210
We must rely on our strengths.

711
01:40:53,370 --> 01:40:55,310
What exactly do you mean?

712
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:58,930
Every able man must work!

713
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:03,970
All of us!
Including the nobility.

714
01:41:07,610 --> 01:41:10,510
They're exempt, Christopher!

715
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:15,510
Well, now they won't be!

716
01:41:58,970 --> 01:42:00,290
<i>Next!</i>

717
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:02,150
<i>Name?</i>

718
01:42:31,970 --> 01:42:34,730
- Name?
- Colpa.

719
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:39,710
What's he saying?

720
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:42,010
He has not found any.

721
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:45,330
Why? Ask him why!

722
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:49,410
Stop him!
Bring him back!

723
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:57,110
He says he hasn't found any.

724
01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:11,410
He's lying.

725
01:43:11,445 --> 01:43:12,610
Tell him...

726
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:17,590
...to put his hand on the table.
Like this.

727
01:43:21,730 --> 01:43:23,630
Tell them...

728
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:28,830
...I know they are hiding
the gold from us.

729
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:35,510
Tell them...

730
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:38,610
...this is how we treat
thieves and liars.

731
01:43:38,650 --> 01:43:41,170
Don Adrian,
you cannot do this thing!

732
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:43,770
I can't?

733
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:49,290
I can!

734
01:44:00,210 --> 01:44:04,810
In one act of brutality
you have created chaos.

735
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:09,530
All the tribes are now
joining forces against us.

736
01:44:09,570 --> 01:44:13,990
All of that because of your
criminal savagery.

737
01:44:14,070 --> 01:44:18,890
Savagery,
is what monkeys understand.

738
01:44:18,970 --> 01:44:23,330
You should have done the same
a long time ago, Don Cristobal.

739
01:44:23,370 --> 01:44:27,390
Your ways,
they don't work!

740
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:32,990
You'll be held in detention,
deprived of your privileges...

741
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:36,950
...until you are sent back to Spain,
where you'll be judged.

742
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:40,030
Have anything to say?

743
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:54,430
For four years now...

744
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:56,350
...we are here.

745
01:44:56,370 --> 01:45:01,630
We stayed here four years...

746
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:04,750
...because we believed
your promises.

747
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:12,170
But we find neither gold,
nor your earthly paradise!

748
01:45:26,810 --> 01:45:30,150
You and your brothers...

749
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:33,790
...you have failed...

750
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:39,310
...Senor, Colombo!

751
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:01,850
- Don Giacomo, you will come at once!
- What's happening?

752
01:46:01,885 --> 01:46:05,690
In the mine!
Get Don Christopher!

753
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:12,290
Cut him down!

754
01:47:15,370 --> 01:47:18,410
Cut the ropes!
Cut the ropes!

755
01:47:23,890 --> 01:47:28,730
Moxica's right!
Your ways don't work!

756
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:31,430
We have to find them.

757
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:33,390
Did you hear me?

758
01:47:33,490 --> 01:47:35,450
You have to find them!

759
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:37,430
You see what they did?

760
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:41,290
You did the same
to your God.

761
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:47,730
You know them?

762
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:37,130
Charge!

763
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:10,250
Stop!

764
01:54:49,890 --> 01:54:51,530
Fire!

765
01:57:12,090 --> 01:57:13,930
Moxica!

766
01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:48,270
You know, what will be said
about this in Spain...

767
01:57:48,290 --> 01:57:50,790
...don't you?

768
01:58:01,610 --> 01:58:04,430
You are nothing!

769
01:58:05,210 --> 01:58:11,890
Your bastards
will never inherit your titles, no!

770
01:58:12,770 --> 01:58:14,490
We...

771
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:19,670
...we are everything!

772
01:58:21,770 --> 01:58:24,770
We are immortal!

773
01:58:51,570 --> 01:58:55,050
Bastard!

774
02:00:35,090 --> 02:00:37,650
Don Christopher...

775
02:00:41,290 --> 02:00:43,870
...I wish to return to Spain.

776
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:49,510
I have no desire to remain
in this Godless place.

777
02:00:49,570 --> 02:00:51,410
They are criminals.

778
02:00:51,490 --> 02:00:52,990
They have a debt
towards the people of Spain.

779
02:00:52,991 --> 02:00:56,491
Moxica paid,
they will have to pay too!

780
02:00:56,510 --> 02:00:59,970
I do not understand you,
Don Christopher.

781
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:03,050
You treat Christians equally
with heathen savages.

782
02:01:03,130 --> 02:01:06,850
And what do you offer
in return?

783
02:01:08,570 --> 02:01:11,870
A New World, Buyl!

784
02:01:12,650 --> 02:01:16,890
No one wants one,
only you!

785
02:01:16,970 --> 02:01:19,410
Not only me!

786
02:01:19,530 --> 02:01:21,055
Look at these people.

787
02:01:21,090 --> 02:01:24,650
They could go back to Spain
to see their families.

788
02:01:24,730 --> 02:01:26,215
But they stay.

789
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:31,550
They want something new.
A new world!

790
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:37,010
I'll be leaving
on the next ship.

791
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:40,710
You may leave if you please,
but...

792
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:45,410
...your departure won't help me
make this place more Godly.

793
02:02:02,810 --> 02:02:07,610
Perhaps hope only exists
in the journey, Giacomo.

794
02:02:08,410 --> 02:02:10,690
At the beginning,
everything's possible.

795
02:02:10,730 --> 02:02:13,810
Every expectation,
every dream.

796
02:02:13,890 --> 02:02:17,710
No one ever expected this
to be easy, Christopher!

797
02:02:17,770 --> 02:02:21,510
This is not
how I imagined it to be.

798
02:02:21,610 --> 02:02:25,210
Marchena was right, Bartolome.

799
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:34,170
Paradise and Hell
both can be earthly.

800
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:38,530
We carry them with us
wherever we go.

801
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:25,390
Utopan!

802
02:04:27,250 --> 02:04:28,910
Speak to me!

803
02:04:29,090 --> 02:04:32,690
You never learned
how to speak my language.

804
02:06:58,850 --> 02:07:03,930
Your Majesty, here are the true
facts concerning the island of Hispaniola.

805
02:07:03,965 --> 02:07:06,070
The activity of your servant
Christopher Columbus...

806
02:07:06,071 --> 02:07:09,971
...Admiral of the ocean sea
and Governer of that island...

807
02:07:10,010 --> 02:07:13,890
...the truth he now presides
over a state of chaos...

808
02:07:13,930 --> 02:07:18,150
...of degradation and madness.

809
02:07:18,650 --> 02:07:20,670
From the beginning
Colombus proved himself...

810
02:07:20,671 --> 02:07:23,871
...completely incapable of
managing the affairs of these islands.

811
02:07:23,890 --> 02:07:28,030
He appointed his brothers
very important positions...

812
02:07:28,050 --> 02:07:31,410
...and so doing, injuring the pride
and dignity of nobles.

813
02:07:31,850 --> 02:07:33,870
He, then promised to build a city.

814
02:07:33,930 --> 02:07:36,810
City of Isabel,
named after Your Majesty.

815
02:07:36,890 --> 02:07:39,750
A group of huts
all in the wrong place...

816
02:07:39,785 --> 02:07:43,430
...swept away
by the rains and mud.

817
02:07:43,570 --> 02:07:47,450
He, then promised gold, evidently
not finding the easy quantities he promised.

818
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:53,250
He has since commanded
each Indian to pay a tax...

819
02:07:53,410 --> 02:07:56,490
...a monthly tribute of gold.

820
02:07:56,510 --> 02:08:04,010
Most being unable to, we find,
have been punished or massacred.

821
02:08:06,050 --> 02:08:09,810
Columbus forced nobility
to hard labour...

822
02:08:09,930 --> 02:08:12,870
...he treated them equally
with Indians.

823
02:08:12,970 --> 02:08:15,770
He reduced them into his slaves.

824
02:08:15,850 --> 02:08:19,910
When the noble man Adrian de Moxica
protested against this treatment...

825
02:08:20,010 --> 02:08:21,650
...he was executed.

826
02:08:21,670 --> 02:08:25,170
- Is this true, Brother Buyl?
- Yes, Your Excellency.

827
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:31,090
These are all true, all of it.
I saw it with my own eyes.

828
02:08:31,150 --> 02:08:32,890
Well...

829
02:08:32,970 --> 02:08:36,050
...he promised a Paradise.

830
02:08:40,090 --> 02:08:42,990
He failed!

831
02:08:43,010 --> 02:08:48,710
He must be replaced,
immediately!

832
02:08:50,170 --> 02:08:55,550
And who would you think of
for such a task?

833
02:08:56,330 --> 02:08:59,190
I am thinking of a man.

834
02:08:59,370 --> 02:09:02,770
A man devoted to Your Majesties.

835
02:09:04,210 --> 02:09:06,850
A man extremely motivated.

836
02:09:45,770 --> 02:09:48,270
Excellency, I'm sorry!

837
02:09:49,970 --> 02:09:54,030
Don Francisco de Bobadilla.

838
02:09:54,650 --> 02:09:58,630
Yes, I remember.

839
02:09:58,690 --> 02:10:02,470
My letters of appointment.

840
02:10:09,410 --> 02:10:12,350
I am the new Viceroy
of the Indies.

841
02:10:12,450 --> 02:10:14,890
Congratulations!

842
02:10:15,690 --> 02:10:18,830
Then I am free to search
for the mainland?

843
02:10:19,170 --> 02:10:24,510
The mainland was discovered
weeks ago, by another Italian.

844
02:10:27,650 --> 02:10:30,890
Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency.

845
02:10:41,730 --> 02:10:43,350
How far?

846
02:10:43,410 --> 02:10:48,730
I'm not a seaman, but I heard
it's no more than a week at sea.

847
02:10:50,450 --> 02:10:54,110
I hope you are not
too disappointed.

848
02:10:56,170 --> 02:10:58,810
How could I be?

849
02:10:59,690 --> 02:11:05,590
The mainland has been found
exactly as I said it would.

850
02:11:09,730 --> 02:11:13,750
I'm afraid this isn't
the worst news.

851
02:11:54,690 --> 02:11:56,450
Diego?

852
02:11:56,850 --> 02:11:58,870
Father!

853
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:05,550
Fernando!
Oh, my God!

854
02:12:07,410 --> 02:12:09,030
A man!

855
02:12:09,050 --> 02:12:11,890
How did this happen?

856
02:12:12,970 --> 02:12:15,630
Diego, Diego!

857
02:12:23,690 --> 02:12:25,150
Don't worry...

858
02:12:25,230 --> 02:12:26,950
...we're going
to get you out of here.

859
02:12:27,050 --> 02:12:29,370
- Santangel's going to see the Queen.
- Good!

860
02:12:29,570 --> 02:12:31,430
Good, good!

861
02:12:33,090 --> 02:12:35,310
I'll go back as soon as
they'll free me.

862
02:12:35,330 --> 02:12:37,950
This time with me.

863
02:12:38,050 --> 02:12:40,890
In your present state
it is madness, Father.

864
02:12:40,925 --> 02:12:44,050
Nobody is forcing you
to come with us.

865
02:12:48,170 --> 02:12:50,030
Diego!

866
02:12:51,610 --> 02:12:53,450
Oh, Diego!

867
02:13:51,970 --> 02:13:54,330
Rise, please.

868
02:14:02,730 --> 02:14:04,410
Now...

869
02:14:04,770 --> 02:14:08,050
...I do look older than you.

870
02:14:14,090 --> 02:14:19,910
I have looked for a reason why
I should allow you to go back.

871
02:14:20,090 --> 02:14:24,070
And though I tried,
I could not find one.

872
02:14:25,290 --> 02:14:27,830
Help me find one.

873
02:14:31,810 --> 02:14:37,430
All my life I have dreamed
of reaching the continent.

874
02:14:37,490 --> 02:14:42,310
I thought my dreams,
grandiose!

875
02:14:44,290 --> 02:14:50,650
But reality was beyond
my expectations, far beyond.

876
02:14:53,770 --> 02:14:55,970
And now...

877
02:14:58,570 --> 02:15:02,330
...I want to explore that land...

878
02:15:09,130 --> 02:15:12,130
...before I die!

879
02:15:25,570 --> 02:15:32,270
I allow you
to undertake another voyage.

880
02:15:32,330 --> 02:15:34,910
Thank you!

881
02:15:35,330 --> 02:15:38,130
But without your brothers!

882
02:15:38,330 --> 02:15:43,610
Nor you to return to Santo Domingo
or any of the other colonies.

883
02:15:44,170 --> 02:15:49,070
The New World
is a disaster.

884
02:15:53,850 --> 02:15:57,870
And the old one, an achievement?

885
02:16:33,590 --> 02:16:38,510
I know, I shouldn't tolerate
his impertinence.

886
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:42,490
Then why?

887
02:16:45,130 --> 02:16:48,030
Because he's not afraid of me.

888
02:16:51,450 --> 02:16:52,910
Sanchez!

889
02:17:02,730 --> 02:17:04,790
You're a dreamer.

890
02:17:11,490 --> 02:17:14,030
Look out there.

891
02:17:16,930 --> 02:17:19,510
What do you see?

892
02:17:25,370 --> 02:17:27,330
I see towers...

893
02:17:27,490 --> 02:17:31,250
...I see palaces,
I see steeples...

894
02:17:31,370 --> 02:17:33,950
...I see civilisation!

895
02:17:34,530 --> 02:17:38,110
And I see spires that reach...

896
02:17:38,170 --> 02:17:40,690
...to the sky!

897
02:17:45,090 --> 02:17:48,470
All of them created
by people like me.

898
02:17:49,090 --> 02:17:51,830
No matter how long you live,
Sanchez...

899
02:17:52,370 --> 02:17:56,630
...there's something
that will never change between us.

900
02:17:57,690 --> 02:17:59,990
I did it...

901
02:18:00,970 --> 02:18:03,730
...you didn't!

902
02:19:14,770 --> 02:19:17,030
You're so beautiful!

903
02:19:25,210 --> 02:19:30,090
I can't believe no other man
has never taken you away from me.

904
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:34,270
They tried,
but I didn't let them.

905
02:19:40,130 --> 02:19:42,710
They took everything.

906
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:45,810
Not everything.

907
02:19:46,690 --> 02:19:49,130
Do you think I care?

908
02:19:49,770 --> 02:19:52,790
I'm a free man again.

909
02:19:53,410 --> 02:19:58,230
Riches don't make a man rich,
they only make him busier.

910
02:20:01,570 --> 02:20:05,710
Oh, God!
How much I've missed you!

911
02:20:07,590 --> 02:20:11,930
By the Grace of God
and Your Beneficient Majesty!

912
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:14,390
A new continent
has now been found...

913
02:20:14,410 --> 02:20:18,430
...and claimed
in the name of the Spanish Crown...

914
02:20:18,470 --> 02:20:22,330
...in the year 1492.

915
02:20:23,330 --> 02:20:28,570
As Your Majesty is well aware,
the University of Salamanca...

916
02:20:28,610 --> 02:20:32,370
...has always defended the theory...

917
02:20:32,450 --> 02:20:37,710
...of the existence
of unknown territories to the west.

918
02:20:38,930 --> 02:20:43,630
The surest route to the new continent
has now been firmly established.

919
02:20:43,810 --> 02:20:49,410
West by south-west for 750 leagues
to Santo Domingo.

920
02:20:49,530 --> 02:20:50,990
From there...

921
02:20:51,010 --> 02:20:55,590
...west-north-west leading
San Juan to the north...

922
02:20:55,770 --> 02:21:00,930
...reaching the island of Hispaniola
on the northen Cape of San Raphael.

923
02:21:01,070 --> 02:21:06,730
Then onto the mainland
at Cape Gracias A Dios.

924
02:21:07,570 --> 02:21:11,170
Spain, by Your Majesty's grace...

925
02:21:11,210 --> 02:21:17,890
...has now confirmed for all humanity,
the existence of a New World.

926
02:21:18,810 --> 02:21:23,050
To the unknown lands!

927
02:21:23,490 --> 02:21:29,450
This continent was first discovered
by a mariner commissioned by Your Majesty.

928
02:21:29,610 --> 02:21:32,190
His name...

929
02:21:33,290 --> 02:21:37,690
...Amerigo Vespucci!

930
02:22:13,330 --> 02:22:14,990
Sanchez!

931
02:22:24,870 --> 02:22:28,670
What a tragedy.
What a waste of a life.

932
02:22:28,810 --> 02:22:30,710
A waste?

933
02:22:30,970 --> 02:22:34,430
Well, if your name or mine
is ever remembered...

934
02:22:35,770 --> 02:22:39,330
...it will only be because of his!

935
02:22:56,690 --> 02:22:59,170
It's Diego,
he's is at court with Santangel.

936
02:22:59,171 --> 02:23:02,771
He says they hope to get your
priveleges restored, maybe the house.

937
02:23:02,970 --> 02:23:05,410
But how is he?

938
02:23:05,610 --> 02:23:09,610
Diego is thinking of starting
a pearl trade in Santo Domingo.

939
02:23:10,210 --> 02:23:13,550
He says he received many letters
for you, mostly from your men.

940
02:23:13,770 --> 02:23:15,850
He sent some of them.

941
02:23:18,050 --> 02:23:21,190
- This one's from Mendez.
- Mendez?

942
02:23:21,290 --> 02:23:23,350
What does he say?

943
02:23:24,610 --> 02:23:28,870
He asks to come and visit you.
He left his address.

944
02:23:30,090 --> 02:23:34,490
He never had one.
Except aboard my ships.

945
02:23:38,730 --> 02:23:42,050
I want you to tell me
everything you remember, Father.

946
02:23:43,210 --> 02:23:45,610
I wouldn't know
where to start, Fernando.

947
02:23:45,690 --> 02:23:49,790
Tell me the first thing
that comes to your mind.

948
02:24:13,730 --> 02:24:17,010
I remember...

949
02:24:36,777 --> 02:24:40,702
In 1502, Columbus sailed with Fernando
on his last voyage to the New World.

950
02:24:40,902 --> 02:24:43,668
They landed in Panama where
the Indians revealed to them...

951
02:24:43,669 --> 02:24:46,690
the existence of a new sea
- the Pacific Ocean.

952
02:24:46,890 --> 02:24:49,725
The biography that Fernando
wrote about his father...

953
02:24:49,727 --> 02:24:52,680
restored the name of Columbus
to its place in history.

954
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:55,594
In 1992, his descendant
Christopher Columbus...

955
02:24:55,595 --> 02:24:58,347
is an Admiral in
the Royal Spanish Navy.

956
02:24:58,547 --> 02:25:01,960
"Life has more imagination
than we carry in our dreams..."

957
02:25:02,305 --> 02:26:02,556
