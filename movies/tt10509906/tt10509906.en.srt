3
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,069
Jack, have you seen my phone?

4
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:55,815
Hello, Grace.

5
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,851
This is Frank Caldwell again.

6
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,819
Just wanted to check in and let you know

7
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,522
I've been doing some more of that research

8
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,557
out here into your family.

9
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,959
I found some real interesting stuff.

10
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,162
I think you're going to be surprised.

11
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,996
Just so you know if I
ain't here when you guys

12
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:11,965
get to my place, just let yourself in,

13
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,534
make yourself at home.

14
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,503
Key's under the flower pot out front.

15
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,606
Anyways, you kids drive
safe, I'll see you real soon.

16
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:19,806
Bye now.

17
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,143
Oh yeah, watch out for snakes.

18
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,184
Bah!

19
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,085
Jack!

20
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,988
You smell good.

21
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,691
What was that, Caldwell again?

22
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,728
Yeah, just confirming again.

23
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,831
Seems eager to meet you.

24
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,068
He's just being polite,
it's a Southern thing.

25
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,439
You really think this guy
can help you find your parents?

26
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,209
I hope so.

27
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,146
He's the first real lead
I've had in 10 years.

28
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,517
Well no matter what
happens, I've always loved

29
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:07,987
a woman of mystery, it's very mysterious.

30
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,990
Okay, I need to finish packing.

31
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,094
It's going to be hell
getting out of the city.

32
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,095
Hey.

33
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:19,099
I just, look, I don't want
you to be disappointed

34
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,867
if it's another dead end.

35
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:29,109
That's why I am happy
you're coming with me.

36
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,447
Yeah, about that.

37
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,749
I was thinking maybe we
could take a little detour.

38
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,085
What kind of detour?

39
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,321
Well, it's not exactly on the way,

40
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:45,292
but waterfront property,
obnoxious rich people,

41
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:46,960
overrated Italian food.

42
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:49,496
Hamptons.

43
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:52,732
You want me to meet your parents?

44
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,934
Yes, I want you to meet my parents.

45
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,637
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

46
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,205
Yes, Jack.

47
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,075
Yes, I mean a little warning
would have been nice.

48
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,742
They're going to love you.

49
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,545
They don't love anyone,
but they will love you

50
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:05,912
because I love you.

51
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,114
No pressure.

52
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,649
Okay, well, maybe I should, you know,

53
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,749
get my hair done, just in case.

54
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:13,153
You are perfect in any haircut.

55
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,623
You could shave your head
right, you'll be perfect.

56
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,891
Don't worry, everything's
going to be fine.

57
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:49,942
Hi.

58
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,079
What you know good, little lady?

59
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,450
New York, huh?

60
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,285
That obvious?

61
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,255
I saw the plates.

62
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,359
Yeah.

63
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,227
You said you could close
this deal so close it.

64
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,928
I'm giving it to Steve.

65
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,231
We both live there.

66
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,334
I'm originally from around these parts.

67
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,571
Lucky guy.

68
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,644
Hey, dude.

69
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:29,349
You don't have a card swipe.

70
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,717
Cash only.

71
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:31,752
Right.

72
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:32,820
Do you have a bathroom?

73
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,221
Shitter's around the back.

74
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,493
Want to give me one of those?

75
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,102
Come on, Grace, just talk to me.

76
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,506
You made me feel like shit, Jack.

77
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,740
The entire weekend.

78
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,376
Look, my parents are old school.

79
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,512
Old money and no one's going to be

80
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,080
good enough for my mother, I warned you.

81
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:01,815
No, it's not your parents.

82
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,251
It's how you made me feel.

83
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,553
You didn't stick up for me once.

84
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,626
Gracie, I'm sorry.

85
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,395
Can we please move on?

86
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:19,533
Sure.

87
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,784
Mr. Caldwell, hello?

88
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,091
He said he'd be here.

89
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,458
Well he said if he wasn't around

90
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,994
to let ourselves in.

91
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:36,030
What are you, trespassing?

92
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:37,864
He told me where the key was, Jack.

93
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,367
This is the South, they
shoot to kill out here.

94
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,468
Yeah, like they don't kill people

95
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,137
in New York or Chicago?

96
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,638
You know what I mean.

97
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:45,639
Relax.

98
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,208
It's the 21st century South.

99
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,378
Hello?

100
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,449
Mr. Caldwell, hello?

101
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,253
It's Grace Covington.

102
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,790
Wonder where he is.

103
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,360
Furnished by Norman Bates.

104
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,498
Well, I'm excited to be here.

105
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,770
I think it's amazing.

106
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:22,609
Seems like nobody's home.

107
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:26,446
Hello?

108
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,283
Frank, are you here?

109
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:41,261
I wonder where he is.

110
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:43,697
Ugh.

111
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,733
Smells like something died in here.

112
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,804
Sure hope there's another bedroom.

113
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,976
Hello?

114
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,011
Frank.

115
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,115
Looks like my mother's handbag.

116
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,450
Come on.

117
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,519
I need you to take this seriously.

118
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,054
This is important to me.

119
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,293
Surprise, more creepy shit.

120
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,568
I'm going to find the whiskey.

121
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,972
This shit is everywhere in here.

122
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:36,083
Come on.

123
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:37,317
Come on.

124
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:42,422
And it's a sober house.

125
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,426
I want to see the back.

126
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:05,779
This place is magic.

127
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:09,083
We could live here.

128
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:12,652
Or not.

129
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,455
You're not from the South,

130
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,390
you wouldn't understand.

131
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,094
You're right, I don't.

132
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:22,529
But I do love you.

133
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,397
Thank you.

134
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,765
Thank you?

135
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,269
Grace, I know this
weekend wasn't the best,

136
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,803
but these things happen.

137
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:32,106
I know.

138
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,141
I'm going to go for a run.

139
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,711
Can you get the bags?

140
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,791
Hello?

141
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:14,661
Hello?

142
00:18:16,297 --> 00:18:17,997
Mr. Caldwell, hello?

143
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,171
We're at the plantation.

144
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:58,705
Ah!

145
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,326
- Jack.
- Shit.

146
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:21,462
What happened?

147
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:23,264
There was a snake up there.

148
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:24,532
Okay, come here.

149
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,765
I got you.

150
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,844
There's like a serious redneck
art installation out there.

151
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,947
Skulls and shit.

152
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:43,683
That's a totem.

153
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,488
Like a totem pole?

154
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:50,857
No, it's supposed to
keep evil spirits away.

155
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,193
Hillbilly voodoo.

156
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,095
It's a Southern thing.

157
00:19:55,229 --> 00:19:56,463
Right.

158
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:57,830
Okay, you have one more
piece, but it's a big one.

159
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,966
Jack, just pull it out.

160
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,403
Okay, count of three.

161
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:05,039
One,

162
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:08,309
two,

163
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:10,511
three.

164
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,782
I'm going to get a first aid kit.

165
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:35,569
That should hold you over,

166
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:37,438
but you need stitches.
Need to get you to an ER.

167
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,838
Jack, we just got here.

168
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,207
We can't leave.

169
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:42,509
Let's just get out of here.

170
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:44,578
This whole thing is weird.

171
00:20:44,712 --> 00:20:47,514
Snake, smell, all of it.

172
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:49,216
I know that it's been a lot.

173
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,117
A lot?

174
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,851
You know what I've been through.

175
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,322
My whole life to feel...

176
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:56,357
Alone?

177
00:20:58,492 --> 00:20:59,892
Yeah.

178
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:00,960
I'm not going to pretend
I know what it's like

179
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:02,529
to grow up in a foster home,

180
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:06,667
but my childhood wasn't easy.

181
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,203
My family can be kind of tough at times.

182
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:11,472
Yeah, but you have one.

183
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:13,374
I don't.

184
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,411
Jack, I am sorry.

185
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:20,748
I don't know what it is about this house

186
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,751
but I have to stay.

187
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:27,787
Hey, I know this is important to you.

188
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,056
I promise we're not going to leave

189
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:30,957
until we get some answers.

190
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:26,473
Grace?

191
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,190
Grace!

192
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,060
The door's stuck.

193
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,641
Grace!

194
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:02,942
Grace?

195
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:08,248
Grace.

196
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:10,417
Grace.

197
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,488
Grace.

198
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:53,494
Grace!

199
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:12,446
What was that?

200
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:15,849
What was what?

201
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:17,985
That sound and the door.

202
00:25:18,752 --> 00:25:20,988
Something's wrong here,
Frank never showed up,

203
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:23,123
we're here alone, everything's weird.

204
00:25:23,257 --> 00:25:26,460
Look, we need to leave right now.

205
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,409
Let me get the bags in the car.

206
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,645
My phone's on the nightstand.

207
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:16,176
I couldn't find your phone.

208
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,611
I told you it's on the nightstand.

209
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:20,080
I looked, mine's not
where it was either.

210
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:25,185
I'm going to put this stuff in the car

211
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,120
and I'll check one more time.

212
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:33,527
Jesus Christ.

213
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:36,964
What is it?

214
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,198
Stay back.

215
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:41,134
Oh my God, Jack.

216
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,169
Jack, get inside.

217
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:43,737
Not fucking funny, guys.

218
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,406
You know what this is?

219
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,408
This is some good old
boys trying to scare us.

220
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:50,110
Yeah, well I'm scared.

221
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:51,678
Shit's been weird
ever since we got here,

222
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:52,512
we're being catfished.

223
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:54,281
No one's catfishing us.

224
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:55,949
I was the one who found this place.

225
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:57,085
I was the one who called him.

226
00:26:57,217 --> 00:26:58,118
Where is he?

227
00:26:58,251 --> 00:26:59,386
Where's your Mr. Caldwell?

228
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:01,254
I don't know!

229
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,925
This is the plan.

230
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,193
I'm going to pull the car
around and we're getting

231
00:27:06,326 --> 00:27:07,628
the fuck out of here.

232
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:10,897
What about our phones?

233
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:12,899
Fuck the phones, I'll
buy you 10 phones tomorrow.

234
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,309
You guys want to fuck with me?

235
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:52,265
Jack, what are we going to do?

236
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:56,470
Looks like some kind of a cult,

237
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:59,239
skinhead Klan gang.

238
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:01,908
The Klan doesn't kill
cats, they kill people.

239
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:04,045
Then What is this?

240
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:05,812
- How am I supposed to know?
- You're from the South.

241
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:06,680
So?

242
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:07,981
So these are your people.

243
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:09,950
Those aren't my people, Jackson.

244
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:11,284
I'm sorry, I'm just...

245
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,420
No, explain it to me.

246
00:29:13,553 --> 00:29:15,123
I've never seen
anything like this before.

247
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,390
They don't teach this shit at Princeton.

248
00:29:21,561 --> 00:29:22,462
It's weird how they're just

249
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:24,431
standing there not moving.

250
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:50,024
It works.

251
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:07,808
Hello?

252
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:08,842
Can you hear me?

253
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,481
Jack.

254
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:22,355
Jack.

255
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:25,792
Jack!

256
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,241
Well done, guys.

257
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:41,708
You don't mess around.

258
00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:44,511
Listen, you had your fun,

259
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:46,080
you scared us good.

260
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:48,815
Now how about you take
your little seance...

261
00:31:21,815 --> 00:31:23,583
Seance up the street.

262
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,152
Jack, stop.

263
00:31:25,286 --> 00:31:26,987
This is private property
and you are trespassing.

264
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:28,256
Stop.

265
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:29,623
And my dad's a litigator and he'll

266
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:31,591
fuck you up in court.

267
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:40,800
And your hats look stupid.

268
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:53,613
- What are we going to do?
- Just wait here.

269
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:36,283
We don't want
you, give us the girl.

270
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:37,684
We'll let you go.

271
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:41,921
Otherwise, you will not
live to see the sunrise.

272
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:52,866
Grace?

273
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:57,238
Were you just on the phone?

274
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:59,539
Yeah, it rang and then...

275
00:33:59,672 --> 00:34:00,740
it's dead.

276
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:02,376
I'm sorry.

277
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,310
Hey, hey, for what?

278
00:34:03,444 --> 00:34:05,112
I brought us here.

279
00:34:05,745 --> 00:34:07,547
No, no, no, no, no.

280
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,483
I was thinking we should
come back for the 4th,

281
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:11,285
bring my parents.

282
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:12,386
Jack.

283
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,092
Maybe it's the cops.

284
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,427
It could be them.

285
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,860
I gotta find out.

286
00:34:54,794 --> 00:34:55,628
Who the fuck are you?

287
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,498
Who the fuck are you?

288
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,765
Gage?

289
00:35:02,836 --> 00:35:04,671
Well, you kids are in
the wrong fucking house.

290
00:35:04,804 --> 00:35:05,805
Man, you have no fucking idea.

291
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:06,773
He might not be one of them.

292
00:35:06,906 --> 00:35:08,109
Fuck yeah he is.

293
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:09,276
I'm only going to
say this one more time:

294
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,844
who the fuck are you?

295
00:35:10,977 --> 00:35:12,313
Okay, an we calm down
and stop with the "fucks"?

296
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,180
Fuck no.

297
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:14,647
Jack.

298
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,317
Where's Gage?

299
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,384
The fuck is Gage?

300
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:19,053
This is his goddamn house.

301
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:22,622
No, this is Frank Caldwell's house.

302
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,758
Nobody calls him that.

303
00:35:26,427 --> 00:35:27,428
Okay.

304
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:29,296
I'm Grace, this is Jack.

305
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,433
Frank, Gage, invited us.

306
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:34,135
Invited you to do what?

307
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:36,970
To find my parents.

308
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:41,008
Who are your parents?

309
00:35:41,142 --> 00:35:43,210
That's the thing, I don't know.

310
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:44,777
Guys, can we pick
this up a little later?

311
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:45,845
We have a real situation.

312
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:47,081
No, no we can't do this later.

313
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:48,748
If you don't tell me who the fuck you are

314
00:35:48,882 --> 00:35:49,949
and what's going on here, I'm gonna

315
00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:51,352
start swinging this thing.

316
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,187
Try me pal, I'm a black belt.

317
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,123
A black belt in what, trespassing?

318
00:35:57,358 --> 00:35:58,125
Okay, listen.

319
00:35:58,259 --> 00:35:59,692
I've been speaking with Frank.

320
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:01,761
He said to let ourselves
in if he wasn't here.

321
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:02,929
And what happened, you got bored

322
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:04,764
and decided to skin that goddamn cat?

323
00:36:04,898 --> 00:36:05,633
They did that.

324
00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:07,168
They did that.

325
00:36:07,301 --> 00:36:08,602
Who's they?

326
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:10,237
Cloak and dagger outside.

327
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:11,804
There's nobody outside,
you high on something, boy?

328
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:13,374
Not fucking high.

329
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:14,908
I tell you what, how
about if I call the sheriff?

330
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:15,942
He'll come over here
and figure all this out.

331
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:17,144
Throw your asses in jail.

332
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:18,646
Already tried that, but by all means,

333
00:36:18,778 --> 00:36:19,879
get the whole damn department out here.

334
00:36:20,014 --> 00:36:22,149
Goddammit, that is what I'm going to do.

335
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:23,816
I'm going to call the sheriff.

336
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,419
Now put that poker down and both of you

337
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:26,520
stand over there by that window

338
00:36:26,654 --> 00:36:28,289
where I can keep an eye on you.

339
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:30,924
Please don't leave us.

340
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:32,792
My phone's in the truck.

341
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:34,461
I'll be right back, darling.

342
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:38,299
Yeah, let him go, honey.

343
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:39,333
Please.

344
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,901
Better him than us.

345
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:46,839
They're both high as a fucking kite.

346
00:36:58,352 --> 00:36:59,687
Sheryl Lee?

347
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:00,588
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,754
Yeah, it's Wayne.

349
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:03,923
Yeah listen, I need to talk to Bill.

350
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:08,728
What?

351
00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:10,431
No, I haven't been drinking.

352
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:13,766
Hello?

353
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:17,371
This goddamn reception out here.

354
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,374
Hello?

355
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:24,378
Who is this?

356
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:36,190
Mister.

357
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:39,426
Mister, come on.

358
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:48,001
Is that you, Brady?

359
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:51,739
All right, listen here.

360
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:53,407
You boys are trespassing
right now goddammit.

361
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,077
And it is within my legal
rights to do something about it.

362
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:59,346
You just stay right there, goddammit.

363
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:07,920
You said you tried to call the sheriff?

364
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,956
Yeah, line went dead.

365
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,161
Don't all you guys have guns?

366
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:17,864
Brother's got a 12 gauge
shotgun up here somewhere.

367
00:38:17,997 --> 00:38:20,601
He practically sleeps
with the goddamn thing.

368
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:22,636
You know who they are, don't you?

369
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,305
Well, you hear stories over the years.

370
00:38:24,438 --> 00:38:26,973
All kinds of crazy shit
about cults and all that,

371
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:28,275
but I never paid it much mind.

372
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:30,544
Well it's time to pay it some mind.

373
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:32,812
What are they, devil worshipers?

374
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:34,048
Serpent.

375
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:38,018
Serpent?

376
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:40,054
Who are you?

377
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,157
I told you, I'm looking for my family.

378
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,328
Your brother's the
one who lured us here.

379
00:38:47,461 --> 00:38:48,295
My brother.

380
00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:50,731
My brother might be a dipstick idiot,

381
00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:51,864
but I'll tell you right now he's not

382
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:53,200
part of some goddamn cult.

383
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:55,269
Now you on the other hand,

384
00:38:55,402 --> 00:38:57,604
you seem to know an awful lot
about what's going on here.

385
00:38:57,738 --> 00:38:58,706
Maybe you're part of it, maybe you

386
00:38:58,838 --> 00:38:59,473
did something with my brother.

387
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:00,541
What?

388
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:01,775
Come on, man, we're trying to

389
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:03,444
get away from the freak show, not join it.

390
00:39:03,577 --> 00:39:05,312
Yeah, well right now we
better find that goddamn gun.

391
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:55,262
Don't.

392
00:41:30,524 --> 00:41:33,293
Son of a bitch!

393
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:57,891
Hey.

394
00:46:04,998 --> 00:46:05,966
You were dreaming.

395
00:46:07,135 --> 00:46:08,035
Sorry.

396
00:46:09,636 --> 00:46:11,605
Sounded like a nightmare.

397
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:14,474
I was running.

398
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:19,846
From what?

399
00:46:20,814 --> 00:46:22,516
I don't know what it was.

400
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:27,988
I was in the woods and it was dark.

401
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:34,795
I had this overwhelming feeling like...

402
00:46:34,928 --> 00:46:36,296
What?

403
00:46:38,032 --> 00:46:41,935
You ever have a dream
that you're running

404
00:46:42,702 --> 00:46:47,041
no matter how hard you
try, you can't get away.

405
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:53,747
We've all had those dreams, Grace.

406
00:46:58,985 --> 00:47:00,353
I was so alone.

407
00:47:01,354 --> 00:47:05,759
You're not alone,
you'll never be alone.

408
00:47:07,627 --> 00:47:09,462
I'll always be with you.

409
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:22,375
Why are we still alive?

410
00:47:23,277 --> 00:47:26,880
Jack, they can come in at any moment.

411
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:29,050
Why are they not killing us?

412
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:30,951
Why are they not coming in?

413
00:47:33,587 --> 00:47:36,423
They could, but they're not.

414
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,867
I need that gun.

415
00:52:27,847 --> 00:52:31,018
What the hell do you want from me?

416
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:34,288
It's at hand.

417
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:39,393
The Equinox is upon us.

418
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:46,033
The Serpent will sleep no longer.

419
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,735
Let us go!

420
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:53,907
The world has
been cruel to you, Grace.

421
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:56,577
How do you know my name?

422
00:52:56,709 --> 00:52:58,546
Don't you want to belong?

423
00:52:58,678 --> 00:53:00,247
Leave us alone!

424
00:53:11,592 --> 00:53:13,927
They were talking to me.

425
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:15,329
They knew my name.

426
00:54:04,545 --> 00:54:05,845
It's empty.

427
00:54:07,114 --> 00:54:08,515
There's shells upstairs.

428
00:54:27,368 --> 00:54:28,269
Oh!

429
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:40,880
Jack!

430
00:55:57,491 --> 00:55:58,925
Look at this.

431
00:56:01,928 --> 00:56:04,931
I mean there must be dozens
of languages in here.

432
00:56:08,802 --> 00:56:11,038
What is this, Latin?

433
00:56:12,272 --> 00:56:15,975
"Et descendat anguis morsu in Terra."

434
00:56:17,745 --> 00:56:19,446
Six years of Catholic school.

435
00:56:20,781 --> 00:56:24,318
"The Serpent will sink
its fangs into the Earth."

436
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:28,288
It says here that pilgrims
fleeing persecution

437
00:56:28,422 --> 00:56:29,956
arrived in the New World.

438
00:56:30,758 --> 00:56:33,494
It was here they discovered
an ancient demon,

439
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:36,397
Uktena, the Serpent.

440
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:40,933
The settlers, seduced by Uktena's power,

441
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:44,838
rejected their Christian
faith and began to

442
00:56:44,971 --> 00:56:47,074
worship the demon as a god.

443
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:53,247
But the Indians rose up,
slaughtering the pilgrims,

444
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,450
trapping the evil spirit on their land.

445
00:56:58,252 --> 00:57:01,054
It is prophesied that
Uktena's disciples will return

446
00:57:01,188 --> 00:57:06,427
to free the demon and
manifest it in human form.

447
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:15,636
Here, the Master carries within them

448
00:57:16,437 --> 00:57:20,641
a perfect child to give the demon a host

449
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:23,777
to burn away man, start anew,

450
00:57:24,678 --> 00:57:27,381
but it must happen when
the portals are open

451
00:57:28,148 --> 00:57:32,486
and the planets align
at the Vernal Equinox.

452
00:57:34,188 --> 00:57:35,322
This will bring on...

453
00:57:37,825 --> 00:57:39,259
The Long Night.

454
00:57:42,529 --> 00:57:43,963
Jack.

455
00:57:44,964 --> 00:57:46,333
What are we going to do?

456
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:49,369
I have no idea.

457
00:58:41,088 --> 00:58:42,656
Go, go, go, go.

458
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:46,753
Grace.

459
00:59:52,626 --> 00:59:53,527
Grace.

460
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:58,198
Grace.

461
01:00:04,204 --> 01:00:05,305
Grace!

462
01:00:08,009 --> 01:00:09,109
Grace!

463
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:16,850
This ends now.

464
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:46,306
Fuck you!

465
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:08,261
What's happening?

466
01:02:09,262 --> 01:02:11,898
I gotta get you out of here.

467
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:26,413
I'm bleeding out.

468
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:28,615
Run ahead.

469
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:29,516
What?

470
01:02:29,649 --> 01:02:30,584
I'm slowing you down, run ahead.

471
01:02:30,717 --> 01:02:31,785
I'm not going without you.

472
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:34,321
We came here because they wanted you.

473
01:02:35,388 --> 01:02:37,357
- I can't.
- I need you to live.

474
01:02:38,391 --> 01:02:39,392
No, no!

475
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:40,260
You can do this.

476
01:02:40,393 --> 01:02:42,763
Go, go, go!

477
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:43,350
Please.

478
01:09:45,186 --> 01:09:46,086
Help.

479
01:09:49,123 --> 01:09:50,024
Please.

480
01:09:56,829 --> 01:09:57,931
Help!

481
01:10:11,744 --> 01:10:12,845
Help.

482
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:20,447
Jack?

483
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:23,350
Oh my God.

484
01:11:24,418 --> 01:11:25,985
Jack, Jack, Jack.

485
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:30,524
I'm here.

486
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:36,530
I got you.

487
01:11:37,431 --> 01:11:38,332
I got you.

488
01:11:57,984 --> 01:11:59,153
Stay back!

489
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:15,835
As it was ordained.

490
01:12:17,904 --> 01:12:19,106
Welcome home.

491
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:21,308
This is not my home.

492
01:12:22,376 --> 01:12:23,410
Grace.

493
01:12:25,612 --> 01:12:28,315
You're the first daughter
of the Millennium Master,

494
01:12:28,449 --> 01:12:32,786
born with one purpose: to free our savior...

495
01:12:32,919 --> 01:12:37,924
the Serpent Uktena,
from 400 years of prison

496
01:12:38,258 --> 01:12:39,892
on this property.

497
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:42,062
I'm not a part of this.

498
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:44,498
The universe has a pattern, Grace.

499
01:12:45,366 --> 01:12:48,302
A natural order that must be maintained.

500
01:12:48,435 --> 01:12:50,337
For 5,000 years, the Serpent has been

501
01:12:50,471 --> 01:12:53,273
the great equalizer, cleansing the evils

502
01:12:53,407 --> 01:12:57,344
of man from the world with his Venom.

503
01:12:59,346 --> 01:13:02,716
You're a death cult
who worships a demon.

504
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,418
Just as a serpent sheds his skin,

505
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:07,187
so must the world be cleansed of sin.

506
01:13:08,489 --> 01:13:11,058
The Serpent poisons the
blood of the wicked,

507
01:13:11,891 --> 01:13:17,331
prideful, the vicious, so that
the next renewal can begin.

508
01:13:22,836 --> 01:13:24,671
You want to destroy the world.

509
01:13:24,805 --> 01:13:25,639
To save it.

510
01:13:25,773 --> 01:13:27,674
I don't believe you.

511
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:28,908
Yes you do.

512
01:13:29,777 --> 01:13:31,445
Look what humanity has wrought,

513
01:13:32,979 --> 01:13:35,649
all the pain and suffering.

514
01:13:37,551 --> 01:13:39,052
Pain binds us.

515
01:13:41,321 --> 01:13:45,292
Pain is a prison from
which no one can be free.

516
01:13:47,927 --> 01:13:51,098
Don't you wish to be
free of your pain, Grace?

517
01:13:52,866 --> 01:13:54,268
Don't you wish the world

518
01:13:56,236 --> 01:13:58,971
to be free of its pain?

519
01:14:01,508 --> 01:14:02,776
Yes.

520
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,011
Yes.

521
01:14:05,846 --> 01:14:08,449
And you are the vessel that will take

522
01:14:08,582 --> 01:14:11,385
the spirit of Uktena into the world

523
01:14:11,518 --> 01:14:13,854
so the next cycle can begin.

524
01:14:13,986 --> 01:14:15,322
No, no.

525
01:14:16,056 --> 01:14:20,060
Grace, you can save the world.

526
01:14:20,194 --> 01:14:21,395
You can save us.

527
01:14:24,398 --> 01:14:28,235
As ordained though, it must begin tonight.

528
01:14:29,969 --> 01:14:31,071
Now.

529
01:14:31,905 --> 01:14:33,640
With the Vernal Equinox.

530
01:14:54,728 --> 01:14:56,430
You are Julia Grace,

531
01:14:59,099 --> 01:15:00,501
Serena Covington,

532
01:15:05,272 --> 01:15:07,307
and I am your mother.

533
01:17:41,328 --> 01:17:43,430
Welcome home, Grace.

534
01:18:07,354 --> 01:18:08,455
Yes.

535
01:18:51,132 --> 01:18:52,899
The Serpent rises.

536
01:19:32,272 --> 01:19:34,341
The Long Night begins.

537
01:19:45,153 --> 01:19:46,820
We release you, Lord Uktena.

538
01:19:48,855 --> 01:19:51,159
We, the guardians of The Long Night,

539
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:52,893
are your humble servants.

540
01:19:56,396 --> 01:19:59,666
Instruct us.

541
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,700
Guide us

542
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:06,573
so that we may be
instruments of your Renewal.

543
01:26:10,404 --> 01:26:12,839
You are
the daughter of the first

544
01:26:12,972 --> 01:26:16,910
Millennium Master, born with one purpose

545
01:26:17,645 --> 01:26:20,281
to free our savior, Uktena,

546
01:26:21,848 --> 01:26:25,685
from 400 years of prison on this property.
