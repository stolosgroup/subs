I'm gonna be a dad.

667
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:09,119
(truck engine revving)

668
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:13,957
Holy shit.

669
00:31:15,092 --> 00:31:18,362
(gentle upbeat music)

670
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:01,905
You an actor?

671
00:32:02,272 --> 00:32:03,440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

672
00:32:03,475 --> 00:32:05,909
I'm an actor, starving actor.

673
00:32:05,943 --> 00:32:07,545
Got an audition
for a play tomorrow

674
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:09,446
and trying to go in character.

675
00:32:10,214 --> 00:32:11,625
Not really sure what
I'm gonna do yet.

676
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:13,250
Yeah, I hear you.

677
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:15,986
Hey, is there a chance
that I could borrow something

678
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,922
and leave you my ID and then
bring it back after I'm done.

679
00:32:20,391 --> 00:32:22,660
(gentle upbeat music)

680
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,663
(telephone ringing)

681
00:32:31,503 --> 00:32:34,271
Hi, how come no one stopped me

682
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,206
when I came around the corner?

683
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,042
Bill Bonnie,
institution security.

684
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:40,478
I'm here for a routine checkup

685
00:32:40,512 --> 00:32:43,981
and I'm wondering if I
could speak to your manager.

686
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:49,654
There's not enough
in budgets these days.

687
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:53,056
So we rely on the local
guards for security.

688
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,026
So, I could a just walk
right in and outta here.

689
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:58,328
Well, we haven't
had any problems yet.

690
00:32:58,362 --> 00:32:59,362
Yet?

691
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:03,735
Okay, let's say somebody
does get back here

692
00:33:03,768 --> 00:33:05,537
and they say, "Open the vault."

693
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:07,672
What do you say?

694
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:09,706
We comply.

695
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:12,744
He says, "Don't
give me a dye pack."

696
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:14,579
We don't give him one.

697
00:33:14,612 --> 00:33:17,314
He says, "Don't press
the silent alarm."

698
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:19,148
We don't press it.

699
00:33:19,684 --> 00:33:22,052
And if you have any
other questions,

700
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,697
you can talk to Jessica
our assistant manager,

701
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:25,155
she'll be happy to help.

702
00:33:25,189 --> 00:33:26,423
Okay.

703
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:27,991
Great, great.

704
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:30,393
Good stuff.

705
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:34,164
- Okay.
- Thanks.

706
00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:36,333
(knocking )

707
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,471
- Hey.
- Hello.

708
00:33:39,504 --> 00:33:42,206
I understand you
guys do the security

709
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:43,383
for all the banks in the area.

710
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:44,441
Right, it's true.

711
00:33:44,476 --> 00:33:46,143
Mind if I give you my resume?

712
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:48,546
No, I'm sorry,
we are not hiring.

713
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,080
- Oh.
- So sorry.

714
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,516
Well, that's too bad.

715
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:52,416
[Man] Yes.

716
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:53,561
How many guys do
you have on per day?

717
00:33:53,585 --> 00:33:55,052
Maybe you could use another.

718
00:33:55,085 --> 00:33:56,554
Ah, I am very sorry.

719
00:33:56,588 --> 00:33:58,088
No, I'm here Monday to Wednesday

720
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,357
and the other guy, he is
here straight to Saturday.

721
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,425
I'm a martial artist.

722
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:04,294
Yeah, specializing in
like hand to hand combat.

723
00:34:04,328 --> 00:34:05,697
Registered to carry side arm.

724
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,598
- No?
- Oh yeah.

725
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:07,599
Oh yeah.

726
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:10,033
[Man] Very impressive.

727
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:11,603
Ah, thank you, thank you.

728
00:34:11,636 --> 00:34:14,104
Unfortunately,
no one is leaving.

729
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,239
[Gilbert] Okay.

730
00:34:15,272 --> 00:34:16,073
I am sorry.

731
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:17,775
No, that's fine.

732
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:18,710
Things change.

733
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:20,110
So why don't you go ahead

734
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:21,663
and just pass it onto
your boss for me.

735
00:34:23,581 --> 00:34:24,516
Thank you.

736
00:34:24,549 --> 00:34:25,583
Merci.

737
00:34:26,216 --> 00:34:30,822
Enchanté, it's me, Michel
down at the Royal East,

738
00:34:30,855 --> 00:34:32,222
just spoke with the boss

739
00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:33,501
and he said that they're
cutting back shifts.

740
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:35,158
They won't need you tomorrow.

741
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:38,362
Motherfucker did say that
he would be making it up

742
00:34:38,395 --> 00:34:39,664
in the Christmas bonus.

743
00:34:39,697 --> 00:34:42,232
So I guess that's good.

744
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:44,636
Okay.

745
00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:46,671
Très bien. Au revoir.

746
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:49,306
(gentle upbeat music)

747
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:52,644
All right, continuing
on special effects makeup.

748
00:34:52,677 --> 00:34:55,445
Okay, so we've covered the eyes,

749
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,482
we've covered the ears.

750
00:34:57,515 --> 00:35:00,350
Now on to the nose.

751
00:35:00,384 --> 00:35:02,587
Polyurethane works great.

752
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,556
But in a pinch,

753
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:08,459
melt Vaseline with candle wax,

754
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:09,694
and you're on your way.

755
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:10,738
(people speaking indistinctly)

756
00:35:10,762 --> 00:35:14,766
[Gilbert] You were
great, thank you so much.

757
00:35:21,906 --> 00:35:24,576
(gentle music)

758
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:06,718
Is that all for you today?

759
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:07,552
All right, that's good.

760
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:09,454
All right, it's nice to see you.

761
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:11,355
See you next time.
Have a good day.

762
00:36:11,388 --> 00:36:12,533
(people speaking indistinctly)

763
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:14,492
Hi, can I help who's next?

764
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:16,360
Hello.
- Hi Jessica, how are you?

765
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:18,228
Great, how can I help you?

766
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:20,632
Well if you could just go ahead

767
00:36:20,665 --> 00:36:22,634
and take a look at
that for me, please.

768
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:28,238
Oh, need your help here.

769
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:29,271
I can't...

770
00:36:30,307 --> 00:36:31,441
Don't?

771
00:36:31,476 --> 00:36:35,212
Oh, it says, don't scream.

772
00:36:35,245 --> 00:36:36,413
Empty your drawers.

773
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:38,148
(laughing)

774
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:40,551
Oh.

775
00:36:40,585 --> 00:36:43,488
Don't bother with the
silent alarm, no dye packs.

776
00:36:43,521 --> 00:36:46,256
Cops will be here in
two to five minutes.

777
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,693
You'll be safe then,
if you're cool now.

778
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:50,895
I can't.

779
00:36:50,928 --> 00:36:52,195
Yeah, yeah, you can.

780
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:53,229
Come on.

781
00:36:53,531 --> 00:36:54,398
You can do it.

782
00:36:54,431 --> 00:36:55,967
You can do it, come on.

783
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,969
(dramatic music)

784
00:36:58,002 --> 00:37:00,672
(people speaking indistinctly)

785
00:37:03,373 --> 00:37:04,373
Okay.

786
00:37:07,779 --> 00:37:09,681
Oh, man's that's a lot of...

787
00:37:09,714 --> 00:37:10,715
Is that okay?

788
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:11,825
[Gilbert] Yeah, you got more?

789
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:12,650
No.

790
00:37:12,684 --> 00:37:13,651
Oh wow.

791
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:16,521
Where do we put it?

792
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:17,622
What?

793
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:19,724
Do you have like a bag?

794
00:37:20,858 --> 00:37:22,392
What?

795
00:37:22,426 --> 00:37:24,696
Oh shit, I don't, I don't.

796
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:27,230
Do you have
something, like a bag?

797
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:28,365
(dramatic music)

798
00:37:28,398 --> 00:37:30,768
(people speaking indistinctly)

799
00:37:30,802 --> 00:37:32,970
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

800
00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:35,540
Yeah, yeah.

801
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:36,507
Awesome.

802
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,241
(people speaking indistinctly)

803
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:47,217
That's good, that's
good, good job.

804
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:49,419
You're doing great.

805
00:37:49,454 --> 00:37:50,320
Okay.

806
00:37:50,353 --> 00:37:51,353
Okay.

807
00:37:52,056 --> 00:37:53,056
Okay.

808
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:55,792
Okay.

809
00:37:56,094 --> 00:37:58,563
Sometimes these things don't...

810
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:00,865
Just hold it.

811
00:38:00,898 --> 00:38:03,835
You hold it, you hold
it and I'll zip it.

812
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:09,272
Oh.

813
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:11,875
You got.

814
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:16,881
Oh God, okay, thank you.

815
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:18,783
How's that?

816
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:21,552
Okay. Good.

817
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:23,385
How'd I do?

818
00:38:24,455 --> 00:38:26,824
Work on your penmanship,
it's really...

819
00:38:27,892 --> 00:38:30,427
Well, you did great.
Thank you.

820
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:31,996
- Thank you.
- All right.

821
00:38:32,797 --> 00:38:34,632
Have a good day.

822
00:38:34,665 --> 00:38:36,634
(door bell ringing)

823
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,970
(car horns honking)

824
00:38:40,505 --> 00:38:41,773
How'd it go?

825
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:43,674
What?

826
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:44,742
The audition.

827
00:38:44,776 --> 00:38:45,877
Oh, oh, oh,

828
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:49,547
good, I think.

829
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,348
I could have been better
prepared probably,

830
00:38:51,381 --> 00:38:52,583
but I don't know.

831
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:54,952
You know I tried this
weird speech impediment.

832
00:38:55,853 --> 00:38:56,854
I'm not sure it worked.

833
00:38:56,888 --> 00:38:58,823
But you know, fingers crossed.

834
00:38:58,856 --> 00:38:59,924
And thank you for these.

835
00:38:59,957 --> 00:39:00,858
Of course.

836
00:39:00,892 --> 00:39:02,760
And I talked a lot about you.

837
00:39:02,794 --> 00:39:03,795
Thank you.

838
00:39:03,828 --> 00:39:04,929
Yeah, you're welcome.

839
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,431
So, can I use your bathroom?

840
00:39:08,466 --> 00:39:11,301
(dramatic music)

841
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:21,579
Oh my God.

842
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:24,649
Oh my, fuck yes.

843
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:28,686
(gentle upbeat music)

844
00:39:43,868 --> 00:39:45,102
Hey, what do you think?

845
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:47,605
Pretty good, right?

846
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:48,840
Hey, you available?

847
00:39:52,944 --> 00:39:55,713
(people speaking indistinctly)

848
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:59,016
(gentle upbeat music)

849
00:40:06,457 --> 00:40:09,426
I forgot that I gotta,
I gotta go poop.

Sock.

853
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:32,683
Yeah baby.

854
00:40:34,218 --> 00:40:35,218
Okay.

855
00:40:57,675 --> 00:40:59,176
Sir, Sir.

856
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,611
Yeah.

857
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:02,713
We don't scan carry
on on domestic flights.

858
00:41:02,747 --> 00:41:04,181
You can move on through.

859
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:06,583
Oh.

860
00:41:06,751 --> 00:41:07,685
Thank you.

861
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:08,719
Thank you.

862
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:10,588

Miss, Air-o-plan?

Wait another Crown,

869
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:40,961
- Right away, Sir.
- Thank you.

870
00:41:40,985 --> 00:41:42,896
Would you like to sign
up for our Air-o-plan card?

871
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,264
It's a credit card
and air miles in one.

872
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:45,156
Air miles?

873
00:41:45,189 --> 00:41:47,058
It's a frequent
flyer program, Sir.

874
00:41:48,793 --> 00:41:50,027
The more you use the card,

875
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:51,238
the more points you
get toward flights

876
00:41:51,262 --> 00:41:52,830
and of course cocktails.

877

No.

My wife's rings,

bastard even took my shotgun.

So, where do we go from here?

897
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:43,681
Oh, they steal here,
they fence over in Vanier,

898
00:42:43,714 --> 00:42:46,183
they sell at another
county or in the States.

899

Recovery's low, okay,
it's extremely low.

900
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:50,079
Okay, it's extremely low.
- It doesn't have to be.

901
00:42:50,388 --> 00:42:53,090
Detective Ray Hoffman,
Vanier B and E.

902
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:54,959
That's quite the
super bush cut, buddy.

903
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:56,193
Dress for the job you want.

904
00:42:56,227 --> 00:42:58,696
Been trying to get a hold
of you for a few weeks.

905
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,197
Give me a sec.

906
00:43:00,231 --> 00:43:01,599
Yeah, sure.

907
00:43:01,632 --> 00:43:02,809
They said you weren't
much of a desk guy.

908
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,335
So I thought I'd
catch you in action.

909
00:43:04,368 --> 00:43:06,046
Sounds like you guys are
having as much luck as we are.

910
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,705
Yeah, well they keep
cutting funding

911
00:43:07,738 --> 00:43:09,116
'cause we're not
delivering the numbers.

912
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,208
Getting more pink slips
now than convictions.

913
00:43:11,242 --> 00:43:12,610
Waiting on mine.

914
00:43:12,643 --> 00:43:13,344
How can I help you?

915
00:43:13,377 --> 00:43:15,346
8,224 robberies nationwide.

916
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:17,681
It's the most in
the entire world.

917
00:43:17,715 --> 00:43:20,284
The Capital alone's seen B and
E's double since last annum.

918
00:43:20,317 --> 00:43:21,752
Despite where our
government says,

919
00:43:21,786 --> 00:43:22,987
we're not winning.

920
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,954
I don't think I've
ever heard anyone

921
00:43:23,988 --> 00:43:25,189
use the word annum out loud.

922
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:28,068
It must be equally frustrating

923
00:43:28,092 --> 00:43:29,293
with our overlapping cases

924
00:43:29,326 --> 00:43:31,362
to not have access to
one another's resources.

925
00:43:31,395 --> 00:43:33,097
Same perps moving in
and out of our cities,

926
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,741
same red tape covering
both our departments.

927
00:43:34,765 --> 00:43:35,733
Understatement.

928
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:37,968
So what are you saying
you want join forces?

929
00:43:38,002 --> 00:43:39,303
We'll create a new one.

930
00:43:39,336 --> 00:43:41,038
Like a task force?

931
00:43:41,072 --> 00:43:42,949
Look, from what I found,
there's three top fences

932
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:44,175
for everything stolen,

933
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,285
with the name that keeps
coming across my desk

934
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:46,110
is Tommy.
- Tommy Kay.

935
00:43:46,143 --> 00:43:47,078
I know, I know.

936
00:43:47,111 --> 00:43:48,045
Down at The Playmate, I know,

937
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:48,746
even this break-in right here

938
00:43:48,779 --> 00:43:50,614
has got all the Tommy hallmarks,

939
00:43:50,648 --> 00:43:53,651
guns and jewelry stolen and all
the electronics left behind.

940
00:43:53,684 --> 00:43:55,286
- Both have higher resale.
- Yeah.

941
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:56,720
By my estimation,

942
00:43:56,754 --> 00:43:58,622
70% of everything stolen
moves through him.

943
00:43:58,656 --> 00:44:00,024
We bring him down it all falls.

944
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:01,068
You you're gonna
need more manpower,

945
00:44:01,092 --> 00:44:04,261
major funding and a
fucking kick ass proposal.

946

947

(birds chirping)

948
00:44:16,006 --> 00:44:18,709
Elwood, I think we just
got our mission from God.

949
00:44:19,844 --> 00:44:21,078
It's Hoffman.

950
00:44:21,112 --> 00:44:22,947
No, Elwood, Blues Brothers.

951
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,348
You know, Belushi, Aykroyd...

952
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:26,383
Okay, we'll work on that.

953
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,752
(Gilbert laughing)
- [Andrea] It's true.

954
00:44:28,786 --> 00:44:31,155
This is a nice
neighborhood, right?

955
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:32,356
What are you up to?

956
00:44:32,389 --> 00:44:33,124
What do you mean,
what am I up to?

957
00:44:33,157 --> 00:44:33,924
Okay.

958
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:35,626
- We're out for a walk.
- Uh huh.

959
00:44:36,427 --> 00:44:37,761
Oh, I like this place.

960
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:41,265
Whose place is this?

961
00:44:41,298 --> 00:44:43,000
Ours?

962
00:44:43,033 --> 00:44:43,834
What?

No.

966

[Gilbert] Yep.

967
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:50,773
Wow.

968
00:44:54,378 --> 00:44:56,680
Yeah, well, come on, we
don't have enough money

969
00:44:56,714 --> 00:44:57,414
to rent this.

970
00:44:57,448 --> 00:44:58,649
Who says we're renting?

this house right here.</i>

979

New baby, new start, amazing
things for an amazing woman.

980
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:21,805
- Really?
- Yep.

981
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,174
What, how?

982
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:26,143
Well I reconnected
with my Pops out West

983
00:45:26,177 --> 00:45:27,745
and he hired me as a...
(door knocking)

984
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:29,213
Come on in.

985
00:45:29,246 --> 00:45:31,248
He hired me as a
security analyst.

986
00:45:31,282 --> 00:45:32,792
So I'll be flying
back and forth a lot,

987
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,818
but I think it's
worth it, right?

988
00:45:34,852 --> 00:45:36,320
What exactly are you doing?

989
00:45:36,353 --> 00:45:38,255
So I'll be going into businesses

990
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:40,157
and assessing their weaknesses.

991
00:45:40,191 --> 00:45:44,228
Oh yeah, right over there
boys, thank you, thank you.

992
00:45:44,261 --> 00:45:46,730
Yeah, so I go into
companies and I help them.

993
00:45:46,764 --> 00:45:48,966
I teach them how to, you
know, improve their security,

994
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:50,502
prevent crime, things like that.

995
00:45:50,535 --> 00:45:51,335
Really?

996
00:45:51,368 --> 00:45:52,336
Yeah.

997
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:54,238
Well when do I get to meet him?

998
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:56,974
Well, you know, he
doesn't really believe

999
00:45:57,007 --> 00:46:00,144
in the whole living together
before marriage thing.

1000
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:01,946
He thinks we're sinners.

1001
00:46:01,979 --> 00:46:03,219
He's kind of a commie that way.

1002
00:46:04,248 --> 00:46:05,983
So when are we
gonna get married?

You're very fast when

1008
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:28,272
I mean, 'cause it's a lot
of work went into that.

1009
00:46:30,908 --> 00:46:31,908
I'm just saying.

00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:35,779

It is, it is, yeah.

1012
00:46:36,548 --> 00:46:38,048
And, and you know, these guys,

1013
00:46:38,082 --> 00:46:39,292
they keep popping up like ants.

1014
00:46:39,316 --> 00:46:42,219
So that gives us the
resources that we need

1015
00:46:42,253 --> 00:46:44,255
so we can tail them
to their fences.

1016
00:46:44,288 --> 00:46:46,023
I mean, we have to
prove the source, right?

1017
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:47,258
I get that.

1018
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:49,302
It's just, there's not enough
in the budget to fund this.

1019
00:46:49,326 --> 00:46:50,928
We'll cut corners, okay.

1020
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:52,196
We have no issue with that.

1021

Even then.

It's fine.

1024
00:46:57,301 --> 00:47:00,304
Maybe if we had a bigger
success rate ahead of time,

1025
00:47:00,337 --> 00:47:02,382
this would be a lot easier
sell to the boys upstairs.

1026
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:04,308
That's what's gonna
give us the bigger rate

1027
00:47:04,341 --> 00:47:06,277
and make you look even

1157
00:52:38,543 --> 00:52:40,277
You see in the States
they got armed guards

00:52:46,216 --> 00:52:47,384

1165
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:53,890
Thanks buddy.

1166
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:01,575

00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:41,839
but diamonds and
watches, that's personal.

1315
00:58:41,872 --> 00:58:43,908
Yeah, which is why
it's more lucrative.

1316
00:58:44,875 --> 00:58:46,911
I don't know.

1317
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:48,746
Jewelry's like taking
from the little guy.

1318
00:58:48,779 --> 00:58:50,214
A bank is an institution.

1319
00:58:50,247 --> 00:58:52,550
You don't take
from the little guy.

1320
00:58:53,517 --> 00:58:55,062
You'll break him, you'll
send him to the poor house.

1321
00:58:55,086 --> 00:58:56,020
What, are you kidding me?

1322
00:58:56,053 --> 00:58:57,688
You ever walk into a God wins?

1323
00:58:57,722 --> 00:58:59,256
These places are corporate.

1324
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,959
They're smaller than
banks, less security.

1325
00:59:01,993 --> 00:59:05,629
You do one job like that
right, you can retire.

1326
00:59:05,663 --> 00:59:06,964
You should think about it.

1327
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,202
It would have to be
a long ways from here.

1328
00:59:11,235 --> 00:59:13,170
You could always
use your air miles.

1329
00:59:13,204 --> 00:59:16,007
And if that fails, well,
you got one of these.

1330
00:59:17,842 --> 00:59:19,677
Oh, well I guess
the size does matter.

1331
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:20,845
(both laughing)

1332
00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:22,880
T.

1333
00:59:22,913 --> 00:59:25,282
(upbeat music)

1334
00:59:28,853 --> 00:59:29,887
Shit.

1335
00:59:30,855 --> 00:59:32,123
Be right there, honey.

1336
00:59:32,156 --> 00:59:33,057
Who's that?

1337
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,158
Ah, that's my daughter.

1338
00:59:34,191 --> 00:59:35,159
You have a daughter.

1339
00:59:35,192 --> 00:59:36,192
You never asked.

1340
00:59:38,929 --> 00:59:40,607
[Tommy] Baby, you know you're
not supposed to be in here.

1341
00:59:40,631 --> 00:59:42,066
What happened, the
school burn down?

1342
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:44,268
Come on, you're 16 years old,
this is no place.

1343
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:45,770
Come here, this is
no place for you.

1344
00:59:45,803 --> 00:59:47,638
I've seen naked women before.

1345
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:49,073
[Tommy] I'm not even gonna ask.

1346
00:59:49,106 --> 00:59:51,142
(upbeat music)

1347
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:54,578
(birds chirping)

1348
00:59:54,612 --> 00:59:58,616
(people speaking indistinctly)

1349
01:00:00,284 --> 01:00:01,886
I can tweak the report,

1350
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,096
lower the numbers,
make it a budget

1351
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,021
they can get on board with.

1352
01:00:04,055 --> 01:00:04,955
No point.

1353
01:00:04,989 --> 01:00:06,557
So that's it, we just quit?

1354
01:00:07,758 --> 01:00:11,762
(people speaking indistinctly)

1355
01:00:13,064 --> 01:00:14,632
We got it?

1356
01:00:14,665 --> 01:00:16,043
Oh, I mean, unless approved
means something else.

1357
01:00:16,067 --> 01:00:17,268
(both laughing)

1358
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:18,836
Look, I know I'm a
bastard, all right.

1359
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:20,347
All right, look, I'm
gonna need 20K cash

1360
01:00:20,371 --> 01:00:21,915
so we can get all the
fence shit we need.

1361
01:00:21,939 --> 01:00:23,607
I want every single
one of our boys

1362
01:00:23,641 --> 01:00:24,975
in unmarked rent-a-wrecks

1363
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:27,978
and a big fucking state of
the art home base.

1364
01:00:28,012 --> 01:00:29,847
(both laughing)

1365
01:00:32,917 --> 01:00:35,886
Well, I guess it beats the
shitbox coffee shops, huh?

1366
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,221
So what are we calling it?

1367
01:00:37,254 --> 01:00:39,990
(gentle upbeat music)

1368
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:51,669
OPD, RCMP, all top
of their class.

1369
01:00:51,702 --> 01:00:53,370
Can I get everyone's
attention please?

1370
01:00:54,271 --> 01:00:55,206
Hi guys, how you doing?

1371
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:56,874
I'm Detective Snydes, B and E,

1372
01:00:56,907 --> 01:01:00,010
I'm not gonna give a big speech
or your game day pep talk.

1373
01:01:00,044 --> 01:01:04,348
But the fact is Project Cafe
is your number one priority.

1374
01:01:04,381 --> 01:01:06,417
Individually, you don't matter.

1375
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:08,185
Your families no longer matter.

1376
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:10,354
But know that if
we catch our man,

1377
01:01:10,387 --> 01:01:12,056
every single one
of you goes home

1378
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:13,257
with credit for the collar.

1379
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:14,391
Understood?

1380
01:01:14,425 --> 01:01:16,060
Any questions?

1381
01:01:16,093 --> 01:01:18,162
Who exactly are we
trying to collar, Sir?

1382
01:01:18,195 --> 01:01:19,396
Tommy Kay.

1383
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:21,332
Moves more goods
than fucking Simpson Sears

1384
01:01:21,365 --> 01:01:22,399
down at The Playmate.

1385
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:25,069
Half the clientele
being on his payroll

1386
01:01:25,102 --> 01:01:27,071
makes that place
fingerprint city.

1387
01:01:27,104 --> 01:01:29,306
I wanna know every person,
perp and prostitute

1388
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,742
that goes in and
outta that place.

1389
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,211
(dramatic music)

1390
01:01:34,245 --> 01:01:35,679
We know Tommy.

1391
01:01:35,713 --> 01:01:37,414
Diamond Dave, his
second in command.

1392
01:01:37,448 --> 01:01:38,249
(door knocking)

1393
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:39,183
(door breaking)

1394
01:01:39,216 --> 01:01:41,986
(dramatic music)

1395
01:01:43,187 --> 01:01:45,890
Billy Bishop, junkie
all around shit heel.

1396
01:01:47,424 --> 01:01:49,293
But the last two
pieces of the puzzle,

1397
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:52,296
what do we have on them?

1398
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:54,031
Working on it.

1399
01:01:54,064 --> 01:01:55,266
Well, work harder.

1400
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:56,901
Get me everything
you can on these two.

1401
01:01:56,934 --> 01:01:58,245
Because ever since
they showed up,

1402
01:01:58,269 --> 01:02:00,080
we're seeing a lot less
fencing going on down there.

1403
01:02:00,104 --> 01:02:01,314
And I wanna know if
they got something to do

1404
01:02:01,338 --> 01:02:02,840
with all these bank
jobs going down.

1405
01:02:02,873 --> 01:02:04,175
'Cause it's no coincidence.

1406
01:02:07,111 --> 01:02:09,880
(dog barking)

1407
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:14,852
Oh shit.

1408
01:02:14,885 --> 01:02:16,854
Yeah, all right, I asked around.

1409
01:02:16,887 --> 01:02:19,957
Security analysts don't make
this kind of cash, Robert.

1410
01:02:21,493 --> 01:02:22,927
Well, the good ones do.

1411
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,062
Yeah, what about
your business card?

1412
01:02:25,095 --> 01:02:26,373
The telephone line
is disconnected

1413
01:02:26,397 --> 01:02:28,332
and the address
doesn't even exist.

1414
01:02:28,365 --> 01:02:30,000
What are you doing?

1415
01:02:32,069 --> 01:02:33,070
[Gilbert] Look.

1416
01:02:33,103 --> 01:02:34,838
Are you selling drugs?

1417
01:02:34,872 --> 01:02:35,773
No.

1418
01:02:35,806 --> 01:02:37,041
Are you killing people?

1419
01:02:37,074 --> 01:02:39,176
No, of course I'm
not killing people.

1420
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,212
Well, I'm running
out of options here.

1421
01:02:45,816 --> 01:02:47,384
Are you even working
with your dad?

1422
01:02:49,887 --> 01:02:52,256
My dad's been in the can
since I was 10-years-old.

1423
01:02:54,091 --> 01:02:55,226
The last time I saw him,

1424
01:02:55,259 --> 01:02:58,062
he was getting dragged off
the front lawn in handcuffs.

1425
01:02:58,095 --> 01:03:00,231
I didn't tell you because
I was embarrassed.

1426
01:03:00,264 --> 01:03:01,332
And what about your mom?

1427
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:03,934
All that stuff about your mom,
was that a lie too?

1428
01:03:03,968 --> 01:03:04,968
No.

1429
01:03:06,571 --> 01:03:10,374
No, no, that's the truth.

1430
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,346
Before my mom left, she would
sit with me and my brother

1431
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:16,780
and she would just read to us.

1432
01:03:16,814 --> 01:03:18,449
She was really big on
that kind of stuff.

1433
01:03:18,483 --> 01:03:19,783
She was super smart.

1434
01:03:20,951 --> 01:03:22,453
Then after my dad
got locked up, she,

1435
01:03:25,089 --> 01:03:26,299
I don't know, she
just checked out

1436
01:03:26,323 --> 01:03:29,860
and she wasn't really
around much anymore.

1437
01:03:31,596 --> 01:03:33,097
She'd always say that,

1438
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:34,908
no matter how much I changed
my clothes or my shirt,

1439
01:03:34,932 --> 01:03:38,202
I would always,
I'd always be him.

1440
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:42,106
Then what the hell is going on?

1441
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:43,407
What are you doing?

1442
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,547
Page one.

1443
01:03:53,117 --> 01:03:54,818
You're inside trading?

1444
01:03:56,521 --> 01:03:57,522
Lower on the page.

1445
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:03,227
Look, after I got
outta jail, I met you

1446
01:04:04,295 --> 01:04:05,305
and I wanted to start over.

1447
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:07,231
I wanted a home,
I wanted a family.

1448
01:04:09,066 --> 01:04:10,066
That's it.

1449
01:04:10,968 --> 01:04:11,968
I'm sorry.

1450
01:04:14,171 --> 01:04:15,171
This is you.

1451
01:04:16,273 --> 01:04:17,308
Yeah.

1452
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:19,143
You're a robber?

1453
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:21,311
Yeah.

1454
01:04:22,547 --> 01:04:23,981
How many have you done?

1455
01:04:25,249 --> 01:04:29,286
I don't know, maybe
30 newspapers worth.

1456
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:32,121
30?

1457
01:04:33,591 --> 01:04:34,591
Maybe more.

1458
01:04:35,493 --> 01:04:37,027
(gentle music)

1459
01:04:37,061 --> 01:04:40,230
Look nobody's been
hurt, except you.

1460
01:04:42,366 --> 01:04:44,469
I'm gonna pack up my shit
and I'll be out by tonight.

1461
01:04:44,502 --> 01:04:45,502
I promise.

1462
01:04:46,437 --> 01:04:49,507
So you're just
robbing the banksters?

1463
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,378
Yeah.

1464
01:04:57,414 --> 01:04:58,414
Show me.

1465
01:04:59,484 --> 01:05:02,186
(gentle upbeat music)

1466
01:05:02,219 --> 01:05:03,954
(birds chirping)

1467
01:05:11,663 --> 01:05:13,230
So what are we looking for?

1468
01:05:14,031 --> 01:05:19,169
Strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, threats.

1469
01:05:19,436 --> 01:05:21,473
See if I can get in and
out of there in a minute 30

1470
01:05:21,506 --> 01:05:23,316
and not get caught in the
first three minutes after,

1471
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,975
I'll always get away.

1472
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:27,344
Oh, there he is.

1473
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:32,383
(Gilbert laughing)

1474
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:34,251
I love this guy.

1475
01:05:34,284 --> 01:05:35,285
Look at him.

1476
01:05:36,286 --> 01:05:37,455
So horny.

1477
01:05:37,489 --> 01:05:38,422
Look at him.

1478
01:05:38,456 --> 01:05:39,657
You've been here before.

1479
01:05:39,691 --> 01:05:40,492
Yeah.

1480
01:05:40,525 --> 01:05:41,992
Yeah, but only on recon.

1481
01:05:44,995 --> 01:05:46,498
So he's the weakness?

1482
01:05:46,531 --> 01:05:48,232
And the opportunity.

1483
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:50,100
Wait, you're going now?

1484
01:05:50,134 --> 01:05:51,135
Yep.

1485
01:05:51,168 --> 01:05:52,670
Wait, you're leaving.
Oh my God.

1486
01:05:52,704 --> 01:05:54,371
- Wish me luck.
- What?

1487
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:58,510
Oh my God.

1488
01:05:59,343 --> 01:06:00,110
Okay.

1489
01:06:00,144 --> 01:06:03,280
(gentle upbeat music)

1490
01:06:12,757 --> 01:06:14,526
(car engine revving)

1491
01:06:29,406 --> 01:06:32,042
Hey man, you're Carl?

1492
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:33,110
I'm Carl.

1493
01:06:33,143 --> 01:06:36,013
No, oh my God.

1494
01:06:36,046 --> 01:06:38,382
Oh, did you drive the Plymouth?

1495
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:39,316
Yeah.

1496
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:41,418
I just saw somebody over there,

1497
01:06:41,452 --> 01:06:42,996
looks like they were trying
to jimmy something in there.

1498
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:43,954
You kidding me?

1499
01:06:43,987 --> 01:06:46,156
Yeah, looked like it
might be a burglary.

1500
01:06:49,326 --> 01:06:51,228
(laughing)

1501
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:54,331
(gentle upbeat music)

1502
01:07:58,195 --> 01:07:59,564
Where are you?

1503
01:07:59,597 --> 01:08:02,800
(gentle upbeat music)

1504
01:08:08,806 --> 01:08:10,475
Wait,

1505
01:08:10,508 --> 01:08:11,809
what the hell?

1506
01:08:11,843 --> 01:08:14,512
(alarm ringing)

1507
01:08:16,113 --> 01:08:16,814
Oh no.

1508
01:08:16,848 --> 01:08:19,517
(alarm ringing)

1509
01:08:22,452 --> 01:08:24,221
(fire engine sirens blaring)

1510
01:08:24,254 --> 01:08:25,690
[Andrea] Oh my God.

1511
01:08:26,457 --> 01:08:29,359
(dramatic music)

1512
01:08:37,869 --> 01:08:39,202
Oh my God.

1513
01:08:50,682 --> 01:08:51,716
Is he talking to me?

1514
01:08:56,521 --> 01:08:57,455
Oh my God.

1515
01:08:57,488 --> 01:08:58,523
Oh my God.

1516
01:09:04,462 --> 01:09:05,597
What?

1517
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:06,731
What?

1518
01:09:06,764 --> 01:09:08,198
Oh my God.

1519
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:09,467
(Gilbert laughing)

1520
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,535
Are you okay?

1521
01:09:10,568 --> 01:09:11,836
Yeah.

1522
01:09:11,869 --> 01:09:13,246
You know, it's always a
bit of an adrenaline rush,

1523
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:14,839
but other than that, it's good.

1524
01:09:14,872 --> 01:09:17,575
There was so much going on,
I didn't know where you were.

1525
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:18,810
That means I did my job.

1526
01:09:18,843 --> 01:09:20,778
Look at that.
Look at that.

1527
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:23,815
This is wild.

1528
01:09:23,848 --> 01:09:25,382
Yeah, I know baby.

1529
01:09:25,415 --> 01:09:28,418
Look, I know, I know it's a
lot, but hopefully,

1530
01:09:28,452 --> 01:09:29,687
you know, we can get through.

1531
01:09:30,588 --> 01:09:34,525
(fire engine sirens blaring)

1532
01:09:43,768 --> 01:09:45,637
What are you thinking?

1533
01:09:47,605 --> 01:09:48,716
You gotta promise me something.

1534
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,608
Actually, a couple of things.

1535
01:09:50,642 --> 01:09:51,642
Okay.

1536
01:09:52,744 --> 01:09:54,545
One, you never get caught.

1537
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:56,614
Of course.

1538
01:09:56,648 --> 01:09:59,416
Two, you just rob banks.

1539
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:01,795
I mean, they've screwed over
everyone I've ever cared about.

1540
01:10:01,819 --> 01:10:03,488
So I can live with that.

1541
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:07,390
Sure.

1542
01:10:08,392 --> 01:10:09,392
What else?

1543
01:10:10,495 --> 01:10:12,497
You do this until we can retire.

1544
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:16,366
And we take the baby, you
get that beach bar of yours

1545
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,505
and we move on a hundred
percent legit, you're done.

1546
01:10:23,908 --> 01:10:24,908
Deal.

1547
01:10:35,352 --> 01:10:39,389
Actually, you gotta
promise me something first?

1548
01:10:40,658 --> 01:10:41,759
Oh yeah, what's that?

1549
01:10:42,794 --> 01:10:45,630
(gentle music)

1550
01:10:57,809 --> 01:10:58,876
Will you marry me?

1551
01:11:00,478 --> 01:11:01,478
Robert.

1552
01:11:03,614 --> 01:11:04,882
Oh my God.

1553
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:06,450
Is that a yes?

1554
01:11:07,852 --> 01:11:08,852
Yes.

1555
01:11:09,554 --> 01:11:11,022
Oh my God.

1556
01:11:11,055 --> 01:11:13,858
(gentle music)

1557
01:11:13,891 --> 01:11:15,660
(birds chirping)

1558
01:11:16,326 --> 01:11:18,863
All right, the last
two guys, we need to ID.

1559
01:11:25,069 --> 01:11:26,369
Still nothing on him, huh?

1560
01:11:26,403 --> 01:11:27,304
Not a thing?

1561
01:11:27,337 --> 01:11:28,606
Not a thing, he's a ghost.

1562
01:11:29,674 --> 01:11:31,609
What about the
other guy, anything?

1563
01:11:31,642 --> 01:11:33,376
Didn't he drive the same car?

1564
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:34,545
Yeah, they all do.

1565
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:35,689
They're like a Chrysler
Fifth Avenue gang.

1566
01:11:35,713 --> 01:11:37,314
Tommy and Dave have one too.

1567
01:11:38,315 --> 01:11:40,952
The other guy drove the
same exact car, same plates.

1568
01:11:40,985 --> 01:11:42,720
Registered to an Andrea Hudson.

1569
01:11:43,888 --> 01:11:45,022
What's the explanation?

1570
01:11:47,424 --> 01:11:48,626
I think I'm gonna find out.

1571
01:11:50,495 --> 01:11:53,731
(gentle upbeat music)

1572
01:11:58,102 --> 01:11:59,637
Someone's had a few.

1573
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:01,873
Oh, hey, why you say that?

1574
01:12:01,906 --> 01:12:03,440
You're still in disguise.

1575
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:06,944
Oh shit.

1576
01:12:08,012 --> 01:12:09,379
Don't get sloppy kid.

1577
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:13,017
Yeah, you know, I hear you.

1578
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:14,986
But to be honest, I've
just been focusing

1579
01:12:15,019 --> 01:12:16,487
on that one last job.

1580
01:12:17,522 --> 01:12:18,723
That's our big one.

1581
01:12:18,756 --> 01:12:21,358
Then I'm gonna be owning
a place just like this,

1582
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:22,727
but ocean side.

1583
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,729
Got it figured out yet?

1584
01:12:24,762 --> 01:12:26,798
Not quite, not
quite, but I have been

1585
01:12:26,831 --> 01:12:29,767
casing out a place out
West the last few months.

1586
01:12:29,801 --> 01:12:31,434
You know, this is the big one.

1587
01:12:32,703 --> 01:12:34,772
I'm calling it
The Big Vancouver.

1588
01:12:34,806 --> 01:12:36,707
Oh, you're naming your jobs now.

1589
01:12:36,741 --> 01:12:38,441
Yeah, Robert would
have trading cards

1590
01:12:38,476 --> 01:12:40,044
with his stats on
it if he could.

1591
01:12:40,077 --> 01:12:41,813
That is actually
a really good idea.

1592
01:12:41,846 --> 01:12:42,914
Yeah.

1593
01:12:42,947 --> 01:12:46,349
Bigger job, you know, you're
gonna need a second man.

1594
01:12:46,383 --> 01:12:47,718
No, I don't need a second man.

1595
01:12:47,752 --> 01:12:49,587
Yeah, what about Bishop?

1596
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,620
Come on.

1597
01:12:51,656 --> 01:12:52,690
That guy, no.
- Yeah.

1598
01:12:52,723 --> 01:12:53,958
Come on, he's a good man.

1599
01:12:53,991 --> 01:12:56,894
Yeah, no, definitely
don't need a second man.

1600
01:12:56,928 --> 01:12:58,696
Come on, I got an
investment to protect.

1601
01:12:58,729 --> 01:12:59,630
You get a second pair of eyes.

1602
01:12:59,664 --> 01:13:01,431
I don't need a second man.

1603
01:13:01,465 --> 01:13:03,134
Robert, I insist.

1604
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:05,636
(gentle upbeat music)

1605
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:06,938
Okay, you know what?

1606
01:13:06,971 --> 01:13:09,406
I can talk about this
some other time, okay.

1607
01:13:10,141 --> 01:13:12,710
Right now I gotta
get back to the wife.

1608
01:13:12,743 --> 01:13:13,744
You got a wife?

1609
01:13:13,778 --> 01:13:17,014
Yeah, well fiance technically.

1610
01:13:17,048 --> 01:13:18,826
Yeah, I've had the ring
the last couple of months,

1611
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:20,985
but I just decided
now was the time.

1612
01:13:21,018 --> 01:13:22,954
Well hell congratulations kid.

1613
01:13:22,987 --> 01:13:23,788
Thank you.

1614
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:26,757
Hey, to Partner's rye

1615
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:27,592
and your fiance.

1616
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:29,460
And my baby to be.

1617
01:13:29,493 --> 01:13:30,695
It's package deal.

1618
01:13:30,728 --> 01:13:31,662
Double fledge.

1619
01:13:31,696 --> 01:13:32,763
(both laughing)

1620
01:13:32,797 --> 01:13:33,831
Well, how about that?

1621
01:13:33,865 --> 01:13:35,142
All right, I'm gonna take a piss

1622
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:37,068
and get outta here
before she has my nuts.

1623
01:13:37,101 --> 01:13:38,669
[Tommy] Okay.

1624
01:13:38,703 --> 01:13:40,805
[Gilbert] Oh and,
got something for you.

1625
01:13:40,838 --> 01:13:42,073
What the hell's that?

1626
01:13:42,106 --> 01:13:43,674
"Karma Chameleon" is track one.

1627
01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:44,709
Huh?

1628
01:13:45,643 --> 01:13:46,777
MTV baby.

1629
01:13:46,811 --> 01:13:48,679
Oh, it's this George Boy guy.

1630
01:13:48,713 --> 01:13:50,047
He's fucking everywhere.

1631
01:13:50,081 --> 01:13:51,716
What the fuck is with that?

1632
01:13:53,885 --> 01:13:56,687
Hey Detective, you finally here
to throw down that warrant?

1633
01:13:56,721 --> 01:13:58,890
Nah, no, just a deuce T bag.

1634
01:13:58,923 --> 01:14:00,591
Well, you must
really like this place.

1635
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:03,494
The only thing I'll ever
like about this place

1636
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:05,730
is the look on your face
when I shut it down.

1637
01:14:05,763 --> 01:14:06,874
And that's just
a matter of time.

1638
01:14:06,898 --> 01:14:08,766
Oh, time's a funny thing.

1639
01:14:08,799 --> 01:14:10,868
Let it run long enough,
warrants expire,

1640
01:14:10,902 --> 01:14:13,804
funding dries up,
people get hurt.

1641
01:14:13,838 --> 01:14:16,707
(upbeat music)

1642
01:14:18,809 --> 01:14:19,820
I'll light a match for you.

1643
01:14:19,844 --> 01:14:20,845
Yeah.

1644
01:14:20,878 --> 01:14:21,878
Choke a loaf.

1645
01:14:23,948 --> 01:14:26,951
(Gilbert whistling)

1646
01:14:38,262 --> 01:14:39,530
Oh hey.

1647
01:14:39,563 --> 01:14:41,032
- Hey.
- Hey.

1648
01:14:50,074 --> 01:14:51,175
Boy George fan, huh?

1649
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:54,178
Yeah, yeah.

1650
01:14:54,211 --> 01:14:55,012
I am.

1651
01:14:55,046 --> 01:14:56,089
You know, I think
he's underrated.

1652
01:14:56,113 --> 01:14:56,881
- Yeah.
- I like him.

1653
01:14:56,914 --> 01:14:58,783
Yeah.
- Oh wow, too much makeup.

1654
01:14:58,816 --> 01:14:59,917
Even for me,

1655
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:01,762
everyone thinks I got
fucking eyeliner on you know.

1656
01:15:01,786 --> 01:15:03,087
(both laughing)

1657
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,488
Yeah.

1658
01:15:04,522 --> 01:15:05,999
It looks like you're
wearing eyeliner.

1659
01:15:06,023 --> 01:15:06,824
You're not?

1660
01:15:06,857 --> 01:15:08,793
- No, no.
- Oh.

1661
01:15:08,826 --> 01:15:09,694
Be who you are, you know.

1662
01:15:09,727 --> 01:15:10,661
Yeah, yep.

1663
01:15:10,695 --> 01:15:11,896
Okay, sure.

1664
01:15:11,929 --> 01:15:12,964
You take care.

1665
01:15:13,831 --> 01:15:14,732
Bye, bye.

1666
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:16,801
Hey, "Changing Every Day"

1667
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:18,235
that's on that album too, right?

1668
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:21,572
I think so.
I think so.

1669
01:15:21,605 --> 01:15:23,405
Yeah, what do you think
he's trying to hide?

1670
01:15:23,908 --> 01:15:25,109
I don't know, man.

1671
01:15:25,142 --> 01:15:27,645
I'm more into the
tune than the lyric.

1672
01:15:27,678 --> 01:15:28,279
You know what I mean?

1673
01:15:28,312 --> 01:15:29,113
Yeah.

1674
01:15:29,146 --> 01:15:30,146
Catchy.

1675
01:15:31,882 --> 01:15:33,617
Okay then we'll see you.

1676
01:15:33,651 --> 01:15:34,651
Yeah.

1677
01:15:37,288 --> 01:15:40,691
Fuck me. Jesus Christ.

1678
01:15:40,725 --> 01:15:43,561
(dramatic music)

1679
01:15:47,965 --> 01:15:49,700
Those two guys drive
the exact same car

1680
01:15:49,734 --> 01:15:51,502
because they're
the exact same guy.

1681
01:15:52,937 --> 01:15:55,539
He's wearing disguise, he's
got fake skin and the wig

1682
01:15:55,573 --> 01:15:56,240
and the whole thing.

1683
01:15:56,273 --> 01:15:56,774
Why?

1684
01:15:56,807 --> 01:15:57,742
I don't know why.

1685
01:15:57,775 --> 01:15:58,852
Well let's run his
plates in and find out.

1686
01:15:58,876 --> 01:16:00,821
Yeah and call every costume
and prosthetics place,

1687
01:16:00,845 --> 01:16:02,046
coast to coast.

1688
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:04,148
(car engine revving)

1689
01:16:05,683 --> 01:16:07,284
(telephone ringing)

1690
01:16:07,318 --> 01:16:09,720
[Woman] John, seriously.

1691
01:16:09,754 --> 01:16:10,855
Sorry, honey.

1692
01:16:10,888 --> 01:16:13,958
(telephone ringing)

1693
01:16:17,161 --> 01:16:18,161
Yeah.

1694
01:16:20,731 --> 01:16:21,999
Better be good.

1695
01:16:22,033 --> 01:16:23,968
District's been keeping
tabs on various people,

1696
01:16:24,001 --> 01:16:24,835
various vehicles over
the last few months.

1697
01:16:24,869 --> 01:16:25,936
I know.

1698
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:28,039
One of our guys was
heading back to the precinct

1699
01:16:28,072 --> 01:16:29,683
past the 7-Eleven, an
old Buick was there,

1700
01:16:29,707 --> 01:16:30,951
but they didn't
think much of it,

1701
01:16:30,975 --> 01:16:32,576
but they thought
they'd seen it before.

1702
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:33,720
Couldn't quite shake
this feeling that maybe.

1703
01:16:33,744 --> 01:16:35,188
Okay if there's a point,
now's the time get to it.

1704
01:16:35,212 --> 01:16:36,656
Right, right, well
it turns out the car

1705
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,849
belongs to somebody that
we brought in for a DUI,

1706
01:16:38,883 --> 01:16:39,993
then a failure to
appear in court.

1707
01:16:40,017 --> 01:16:41,028
Okay, he's screwed, I get it.

1708
01:16:41,052 --> 01:16:41,986
Why am I here?

1709
01:16:42,019 --> 01:16:43,587
He wanted to talk to you.

1710
01:16:44,922 --> 01:16:47,758
(dramatic music)

1711
01:16:56,901 --> 01:16:57,701
Hey.

1712
01:16:57,735 --> 01:16:58,969
Hey,

1713
01:16:59,003 --> 01:17:00,313
our two guys are not
only the same guy

1714
01:17:00,337 --> 01:17:01,872
I saw at The Playmate.

1715
01:17:01,906 --> 01:17:02,906
He's also this guy.

1716
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:04,842
That's Robert?

1717
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,077
Yes, that's Robert.

1718
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,945
Diamond Dave says he's
off on a job right now.

1719
01:17:07,978 --> 01:17:09,814
Something Robert's
calling The Big Vancouver.

1720
01:17:09,847 --> 01:17:11,048
He's naming his jobs now.

1721
01:17:11,082 --> 01:17:12,783
What do we have left
in petty cash quick?

1722
01:17:12,817 --> 01:17:13,984
Oh, come on.

1723
01:17:14,018 --> 01:17:16,063
I've got maybe 50 left in my
account for a plane ticket.

1724
01:17:16,087 --> 01:17:18,222
Come on cough it up.
- All right, all right, here.

1725
01:17:18,255 --> 01:17:21,092
(dramatic music)

1726
01:17:30,201 --> 01:17:31,235
[Gilbert] Are you okay?

1727
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:35,005
I need a bump.

1728
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:36,039
Oh my God.

1729
01:17:37,975 --> 01:17:40,177
The job is a bigger rush, okay.

1730
01:17:41,979 --> 01:17:43,356
Are you sure you're
okay to do this?

1731
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:45,082
You sure it'll work?

1732
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,886
I know what the fuck I'm doing.

1733
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:51,021
You need to keep
your shit together.

1734
01:17:51,055 --> 01:17:52,756
I've cased this
place three times.

1735
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:55,192
And if it's done right, we'll
clear over a million in there.

1736
01:17:55,226 --> 01:17:57,928
Everything before
this was prologue.

1737
01:18:00,064 --> 01:18:01,665
What the fuck is prologue?

1738
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:06,947
So just take a
look at these, ready?

1739
01:18:06,971 --> 01:18:08,706
So this is definitely him?

1740
01:18:08,739 --> 01:18:10,383
Look, like I said on
the phone from your fax,

1741
01:18:10,407 --> 01:18:12,143
definitely him.
- Okay.

1742
01:18:12,176 --> 01:18:13,386
And you said
something about money.

1743
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:14,979
Has he been back this week?

1744
01:18:15,012 --> 01:18:17,148
Well, he came by asking
about hiring actors.

1745
01:18:17,181 --> 01:18:18,382
For what?

1746
01:18:18,415 --> 01:18:20,818
I don't know, said he wanted
to try something different.

1747
01:18:20,851 --> 01:18:21,886
Maybe directing.

1748
01:18:23,053 --> 01:18:24,533
Yeah, I'm gonna
guess it's not that.

1749
01:18:27,858 --> 01:18:28,902
[Woman] Hey, you
can't go in there.

1750
01:18:28,926 --> 01:18:30,070
Call Detective
Hoffman it's fine.

1751
01:18:30,094 --> 01:18:31,162
Seriously it's fine.

1752
01:18:31,195 --> 01:18:33,197
Detective John F
Snydes, my guy's already

1753
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,199
gotten the horn with
your team, please.

1754
01:18:36,033 --> 01:18:37,101
It's all right.

1755
01:18:38,869 --> 01:18:41,071
I believe this man
has come to your city

1756
01:18:41,105 --> 01:18:44,008
to rob a bank within
the next 24 hours.

1757
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:46,944
How fast can you get uniforms
to sit on those locations?

1758
01:18:48,012 --> 01:18:50,114
There's over 670 banks downtown.

1759
01:18:50,147 --> 01:18:52,049
Well, the same place's
get robbed each time

1760
01:18:52,082 --> 01:18:53,751
he flies into any town.

1761
01:18:53,784 --> 01:18:55,219
And I've narrowed
it down to five.

1762
01:18:55,252 --> 01:18:56,887
He's done two in a day.

1763
01:18:56,921 --> 01:18:59,023
Maybe he's gonna up his
personal best, I don't know.

1764
01:19:01,025 --> 01:19:02,793
Can you help or not?

1765
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:05,396
(dramatic music)

1766
01:19:12,036 --> 01:19:14,772
(car engines revving)

1767
01:19:14,805 --> 01:19:17,441
(dramatic music)

1768
01:19:20,077 --> 01:19:22,079
Anybody got eyes on anything?

1769
01:19:22,112 --> 01:19:24,014
No, I got nothing.

1770
01:19:24,048 --> 01:19:25,249
Negative.

1771
01:19:30,854 --> 01:19:32,132
Okay, we're all
looking for something

1772
01:19:32,156 --> 01:19:33,390
big and different, right?

1773
01:19:34,792 --> 01:19:35,792
Big and different.

1774
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,497
(dramatic music)

1775
01:19:55,946 --> 01:19:56,548
Thank you.

1776
01:19:56,581 --> 01:19:57,581
Take care.

1777
01:20:05,122 --> 01:20:06,491
Well, that should do her.

1778
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,802
Hi, what is this?

1779
01:20:18,836 --> 01:20:20,137
Four palms for delivery.

1780
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:21,972
[Man] You can't put those here.

1781
01:20:22,006 --> 01:20:23,207
[Courier] Why not?

1782
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,480
Because we didn't order them.

1783
01:20:24,509 --> 01:20:25,876
[Courier] Somebody ordered 'em.

1784
01:20:25,909 --> 01:20:28,145
We got anybody
posted at the mall?

1785
01:20:30,247 --> 01:20:32,225
[Courier] I just put 'em
where they told me to go.

1786
01:20:32,249 --> 01:20:33,217
[Man] Okay, but.

1787
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:36,287
(dramatic music)

1788
01:20:42,393 --> 01:20:45,162
Let's see, I think I'll
take one of everything.

1789
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:47,930
No.

1790
01:20:49,501 --> 01:20:50,501
No?

1791
01:20:55,306 --> 01:20:56,307
No.

1792
01:20:58,409 --> 01:20:59,910
- Jesus Christ.
- Open up.

1793
01:21:01,145 --> 01:21:02,212
Are you serious?

1794
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:04,348
Anyone else seeing this?

1795
01:21:04,381 --> 01:21:05,559
[Man] Yeah, someone
ordered them, sure.

1796
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:06,383
I did not.

1797
01:21:06,417 --> 01:21:08,185
[Courier] This
is God wins right?

1798
01:21:08,218 --> 01:21:09,963
That's what the sign
says, yes, this is God wins.

1799
01:21:09,987 --> 01:21:12,056
Well then they're
in the right place.

1800
01:21:12,557 --> 01:21:14,637
[Snydes] Do me a favor,
run the plates on that van.

1801
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,195
Hey, handle him.

1802
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:24,001
God dammit.

1803
01:21:24,034 --> 01:21:25,879
Okay, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1804
01:21:25,903 --> 01:21:28,238
[Man] Your demeanor's
incredibly unprofessional.

1805
01:21:29,173 --> 01:21:30,908
Hey you, get on the ground.

1806
01:21:30,941 --> 01:21:32,176
Get the fuck on the ground.

1807
01:21:32,209 --> 01:21:33,645
Get on the ground now.

1808
01:21:33,678 --> 01:21:36,313
Hey, settle down.

1809
01:21:36,347 --> 01:21:37,347
Easy.

1810
01:21:38,148 --> 01:21:40,884
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1811
01:21:43,387 --> 01:21:45,289
Watch the front door.

1812
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:48,125
(dramatic music)

1813
01:22:03,173 --> 01:22:04,074
There you go.

1814
01:22:04,108 --> 01:22:06,910
All of it, all it,
all of it, all of it.

1815
01:22:09,046 --> 01:22:11,882
Robert, I think we got company.

1816
01:22:14,051 --> 01:22:15,386
Get over here.

1817
01:22:17,154 --> 01:22:19,089
You said my name, idiot.

1818
01:22:19,123 --> 01:22:21,659
(dramatic music)

1819
01:22:26,731 --> 01:22:28,600
You did great.

1820
01:22:32,336 --> 01:22:35,372
(bombs exploding)

1821
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:38,175
(dramatic music)

1822
01:22:45,149 --> 01:22:46,359
Fuck, he's not robbing a bank.

1823
01:22:46,383 --> 01:22:47,719
He's hit the
God wins at the mall.

1824
01:22:47,752 --> 01:22:50,588
(dramatic music)

1825
01:22:53,023 --> 01:22:54,291
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

1826
01:23:00,431 --> 01:23:02,634
Slow down, don't run.

1827
01:23:02,667 --> 01:23:04,368
Be cool.

1828
01:23:06,671 --> 01:23:07,671
Hey.

1829
01:23:22,052 --> 01:23:23,052
[Woman] Hey.

1830
01:23:27,424 --> 01:23:29,092
I got two possible suspects,

1831
01:23:29,126 --> 01:23:30,360
moving north through the mall.

1832
01:23:30,394 --> 01:23:31,261
Blue coveralls.

1833
01:23:31,295 --> 01:23:32,564
Don't move!

1834
01:23:32,597 --> 01:23:35,032
(people speaking indistinctly)

1835
01:23:35,065 --> 01:23:36,468
Hands up, turn around.

1836
01:23:36,501 --> 01:23:39,336
(dramatic music)

1837
01:23:41,806 --> 01:23:43,508
[Hoffman] Snydes,
yeah, I think I see 'em

1838
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:45,175
other side of the mall.

1839
01:23:46,076 --> 01:23:47,076
Get outta here..

1840
01:23:48,378 --> 01:23:49,346
I got 'em.

1841
01:23:49,379 --> 01:23:51,114
Yeah, they're heading
to the West entrance.

1842
01:23:51,816 --> 01:23:54,318
[Man] No, no, no, I got
two over here heading East.

1843
01:23:56,688 --> 01:23:59,356
[Man] Shit.
Do we take them all?

1844
01:24:03,795 --> 01:24:06,163
Go after the two that don't run.

1845
01:24:07,765 --> 01:24:10,434
(alarm blaring)

1846
01:24:28,653 --> 01:24:29,654
Go. Let's go.

1847
01:24:33,357 --> 01:24:34,157
Oh shit.

1848
01:24:34,191 --> 01:24:37,027
(dramatic music)

1849
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:41,431
Check that door.

1850
01:24:41,466 --> 01:24:43,635
Fuck, I fucked up,
I said your name.

1851
01:24:43,668 --> 01:24:46,436
Just shut up and
deal with the door.

1852
01:24:59,116 --> 01:25:00,384
Shit.

1853
01:25:00,417 --> 01:25:01,553
What?

1854
01:25:01,586 --> 01:25:03,521
I forgot the gun.

1855
01:25:03,555 --> 01:25:04,555
What?

1856
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:06,356
You did what?

1857
01:25:07,391 --> 01:25:08,602
I must have left
it in the store.

1858
01:25:08,626 --> 01:25:10,762
We were moving so fast,
I panicked.

1859
01:25:10,795 --> 01:25:13,096
What is wrong with you, dude?

1860
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:14,331
Time's up Robert.

1861
01:25:18,469 --> 01:25:19,537
Time's up.

1862
01:25:27,144 --> 01:25:29,179
You shoot me, you
don't recover anything.

1863
01:25:29,814 --> 01:25:31,516
You still need evidence.

1864
01:25:31,549 --> 01:25:34,117
Well, you're kind
of exhibit A buddy.

1865
01:25:34,151 --> 01:25:37,555
No, no, you and I both know

1866
01:25:37,589 --> 01:25:39,524
that you don't have
enough to hold me.

1867
01:25:41,759 --> 01:25:43,427
No, don't do it.

1868
01:25:43,461 --> 01:25:44,872
Hey, let's pick
this up another time.

1869
01:25:44,896 --> 01:25:46,731
Hey, don't, don't.

1870
01:25:46,764 --> 01:25:48,398
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1871
01:25:51,234 --> 01:25:52,503
Hey dumb ass.

1872
01:25:54,371 --> 01:25:55,371
Fuck.

1873
01:26:01,846 --> 01:26:02,846
Shit.

1874
01:26:08,886 --> 01:26:12,189
(telephone ringing)

1875
01:26:12,857 --> 01:26:14,291
Hello.

1876
01:26:14,324 --> 01:26:15,560
Pack your bags, baby.

1877
01:26:16,594 --> 01:26:17,762
For real?

1878
01:26:17,795 --> 01:26:19,162
For real.

1879
01:26:19,196 --> 01:26:20,632
Check the top dresser drawer.

1880
01:26:22,634 --> 01:26:23,668
No.

1881
01:26:25,837 --> 01:26:26,704
All right, all right.

1882
01:26:26,738 --> 01:26:27,739
I gotta go, I'll see you.

1883
01:26:27,772 --> 01:26:28,816
Don't forget to
pack your sandals.

1884
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,774
<i>I gotta go.</i>

1885
01:26:29,807 --> 01:26:31,308
Okay, okay, bye.

1886
01:26:34,612 --> 01:26:36,547
Cops will see we
bought plane tickets.

1887
01:26:36,581 --> 01:26:37,447
They're all over the airport.

1888
01:26:37,482 --> 01:26:38,626
Which is why we're
taking the train.

1889
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:39,550
Take that.

1890
01:26:39,584 --> 01:26:40,752
I'll be in the bar car,

1891
01:26:40,785 --> 01:26:42,285
you make sure you're
somewhere else.

1892
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:43,319
See ya.

(car engine revving)

1895
01:26:58,636 --> 01:27:01,472
Goddess, movers
are on their way,

1896
01:27:01,506 --> 01:27:02,640
we gotta go now.

1897
01:27:05,543 --> 01:27:06,577
Andy.

1898
01:27:18,923 --> 01:27:20,458
We definitely have to go.

1899
01:27:21,993 --> 01:27:23,761
(car brakes screeching)

1900

1903
01:27:30,001 --> 01:27:30,902
I got it.

1904
01:27:30,935 --> 01:27:32,402
Get a chair, get a wheelchair.

1905
01:27:37,675 --> 01:27:38,643
Awesome.

1906
01:27:38,676 --> 01:27:39,676
Okay.

1907
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:41,612
There you go, have a seat.

[Doctor] You're doing great.

1914
01:27:51,556 --> 01:27:53,725
Well how's it looking Doc?

1915
01:27:53,758 --> 01:27:54,892
Oh my God.

1916
01:27:54,926 --> 01:27:56,293
- Get outta here.
- Oh my God.

1917
01:27:56,326 --> 01:27:57,662
Oh my God.
- What are you doing?

1918
01:27:57,695 --> 01:28:00,531
I saw the, I saw the head, oh.

It's so cute.

You're so perfect.

1936

Hi.

Where the hell's everything?

1949
01:29:57,414 --> 01:29:58,415
It's gone.

1950
01:29:58,448 --> 01:29:59,768
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1951
01:30:03,487 --> 01:30:04,487
Fuck.

Are you gonna tell
me what's going on?

1960
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:35,863
Look, they're
watching the airports

and the train stations.

1962

This is the safe play.

01:30:45,496 --> 01:30:49,734
Look, sitting there
holding her in that hospital.

1967
01:30:51,235 --> 01:30:53,104
I don't know, it's like
I spent my entire life

1968
01:30:53,137 --> 01:30:56,741
working towards something
like this idea of an escape,

1969
01:30:56,774 --> 01:30:58,542
this perfect ocean-side life,

1970
01:30:58,576 --> 01:31:03,748
but with all this, you two are
the only escape that I need.

1971
01:31:04,315 --> 01:31:07,885
And like you said,
"Wherever we are is home."

1972
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,655
Right?

1973
01:31:10,688 --> 01:31:11,688
Are we safe?

1974
01:31:14,659 --> 01:31:15,459
Yeah.

1975
01:31:15,493 --> 01:31:16,527
Okay.

1976
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,829
New digs new town, right.

1977
01:31:18,863 --> 01:31:20,498
They don't know
who or where I am.

1978
01:31:20,531 --> 01:31:25,536
So, welcome home.

1979
01:31:31,776 --> 01:31:36,047
(people speaking indistinctly)

1980
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,615
(bike bell ringing)

1981
01:31:37,648 --> 01:31:38,648
Hey.

1982
01:31:43,721 --> 01:31:45,766
[Gilbert Voice over] <i>It's not</i>
<i>often you get a second</i> chance

1983
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:47,591
<i>where the universe
opens up and says,</i>

1984
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:48,759
<i>"Don't fuck this up."</i>

1985
01:31:49,827 --> 01:31:52,830
<i>But I was listening, I was out.</i>

1986
01:31:52,863 --> 01:31:54,565
<i>Besides in bank robbery,</i>

1987
01:31:54,598 --> 01:31:56,734
<i>they don't really have a
bring your kid to work day.</i>

1988
01:31:59,837 --> 01:32:02,840
(birds chirping)

1989
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:10,948
All right, here we go.

1990
01:32:10,982 --> 01:32:12,083
Here we go.

1991
01:32:13,617 --> 01:32:15,486
Goddess, we're home.

1992
01:32:16,821 --> 01:32:17,888
In here.

1993
01:32:17,922 --> 01:32:18,923
Hi.

1994
01:32:18,956 --> 01:32:21,192
Oh, I know that smile.

1995
01:32:21,225 --> 01:32:22,593
You like that smile.

1996
01:32:22,626 --> 01:32:24,228
I do like that
smile, how are you?

1997
01:32:25,162 --> 01:32:26,597
And how are you?

1998
01:32:27,898 --> 01:32:28,976
Listen, we still need to talk

1999
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,143
about that addition
on the office.

2000
01:32:30,167 --> 01:32:31,836
Are we still good?

2001
01:32:31,869 --> 01:32:32,870
Yeah.

2002
01:32:32,903 --> 01:32:33,704
- Yeah?
- Uh huh.

2003
01:32:33,738 --> 01:32:34,538
Okay.

2004
01:32:34,572 --> 01:32:35,172
[Gilbert] Of course.

2005
01:32:35,206 --> 01:32:36,974
(door knocking)

2006
01:32:37,008 --> 01:32:38,552
Oh, grab that, I'm
gonna put her down.

2007
01:32:38,576 --> 01:32:39,610
Yeah, okay, okay.

2008
01:32:39,643 --> 01:32:40,878
Come on, let's go.

2009
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:45,182
Hey, I'm looking for my
friend, Robert White man.

2010
01:32:45,216 --> 01:32:46,617
Oh my God.

2011
01:32:47,918 --> 01:32:49,754
- My good buddy.
- What are you doing here?

2012
01:32:49,787 --> 01:32:50,988
Ah, just passing through.

2013
01:32:51,022 --> 01:32:51,989
Nobody just passes
through Pembroke.

2014
01:32:52,023 --> 01:32:53,190
That's damn right.

2015
01:32:53,224 --> 01:32:55,259
Hey, she's putting
the baby down.

2016
01:32:55,292 --> 01:32:56,336
Grab a seat, I'll
get some beers.

2017
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:57,628
- Sure.
- All right.

2018
01:33:04,101 --> 01:33:04,935
Hey.

2019
01:33:04,969 --> 01:33:05,970
Thanks.

2020
01:33:06,003 --> 01:33:07,003
[Gilbert] You got it.

2021
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:11,575
(Gilbert sighing)

2022
01:33:14,311 --> 01:33:17,014
(Tommy laughing)

2023
01:33:18,649 --> 01:33:21,118
Having a toddler is like
owning a blender with no top.

2024
01:33:22,119 --> 01:33:24,021
Her toys have toys.

2025
01:33:24,055 --> 01:33:25,222
Yeah.

2026
01:33:28,025 --> 01:33:29,593
You know, I always thought

2027
01:33:29,627 --> 01:33:30,904
sweatpants were a
sign of defeat,

2028
01:33:30,928 --> 01:33:32,139
but you actually
make 'em look good.

2029
01:33:32,163 --> 01:33:34,065
They should stick
you in a storefront.

2030
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:39,570
All right, Tommy, what
are you really doing here?

2031
01:33:42,273 --> 01:33:44,942
You're not used to having
any real friends, are you?

2032
01:33:46,944 --> 01:33:48,879
I just came to see
how you were doing.

2033
01:33:48,913 --> 01:33:49,914
Yeah?

2034
01:33:49,947 --> 01:33:50,881
Yeah.

2035
01:33:50,915 --> 01:33:51,915
I'm good.

2036
01:33:52,683 --> 01:33:53,617
I'm real good.

2037
01:33:53,651 --> 01:33:54,852
You sure?

2038
01:33:54,885 --> 01:33:55,885
Yeah.

2039
01:33:56,787 --> 01:33:57,998
'Cause I never
thought I'd see the day

2040
01:33:58,022 --> 01:34:00,891
when Robert White man be
cutting his own grass.

2041
01:34:00,925 --> 01:34:02,102
Yeah, whoever thought that weeds

2042
01:34:02,126 --> 01:34:03,994
would be my biggest
problem, right?

2043
01:34:07,965 --> 01:34:08,966
You don't miss it.

2044
01:34:10,201 --> 01:34:11,201
Nah.

2045
01:34:12,703 --> 01:34:14,271
Nah, it was just
a means to an end.

2046
01:34:18,275 --> 01:34:19,844
You know the older I get,

2047
01:34:19,877 --> 01:34:22,213
I realized all the
stuff I don't need.

2048
01:34:22,246 --> 01:34:23,414
All the stuff that when I go,

2049
01:34:23,447 --> 01:34:25,182
they're just gonna
toss it in the trash.

2050
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:27,227
Yeah, well you'll
definitely have

2051
01:34:27,251 --> 01:34:28,752
the nicest trash on the block.

2052
01:34:28,786 --> 01:34:29,386
[Tommy] Thank you.

2053
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:30,420
Yeah.

2054
01:34:37,328 --> 01:34:39,163
It's funny, I can't
think of a single toy

2055
01:34:39,196 --> 01:34:40,698
I ever had as a kid.

2056
01:34:42,166 --> 01:34:45,703
Probably because I never
had much of anything at all.

2057
01:34:45,736 --> 01:34:46,437
Used to me piss me off,

2058
01:34:46,471 --> 01:34:47,838
seeing all these other kids

2059
01:34:47,872 --> 01:34:49,840
playing with their
toys and shit.

2060
01:34:49,874 --> 01:34:51,208
I had zip, but that was okay.

2061
01:34:51,242 --> 01:34:54,178
'Cause it taught me to
appreciate what I earned.

2062
01:34:54,211 --> 01:34:56,780
See once you know what it's
like to have something,

2063
01:34:56,814 --> 01:34:58,048
well then you gotta have more.

2064
01:34:59,083 --> 01:35:01,852
It doesn't matter whether
you're rich or poor.

2065
01:35:01,886 --> 01:35:03,087
You're always gonna live

2066
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,022
to just a little bit
beyond your means.

2067
01:35:06,223 --> 01:35:07,925
So you gotta know your limits.

2068
01:35:10,895 --> 01:35:15,099
You, me, we got everything,
everything that matters.

2069
01:35:15,132 --> 01:35:17,334
All that other shit is
just ashes and dust,

2070
01:35:17,368 --> 01:35:18,769
like we're gonna be.

2071
01:35:19,471 --> 01:35:20,371
So what are you saying,

2072
01:35:20,404 --> 01:35:21,772
you getting outta the game?

2073
01:35:21,805 --> 01:35:23,807
Nah, nah, nah,
too old to grow up.

2074
01:35:25,743 --> 01:35:31,248
But you, do not tickle
the balls of the lion

2075
01:35:31,282 --> 01:35:32,283
on the way out kid.

2076
01:35:34,084 --> 01:35:36,253
Hate to see you get mauled.

2077
01:35:36,287 --> 01:35:39,056
(gentle music)

2078
01:35:39,089 --> 01:35:40,291
(birds chirping)

2079
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:57,141
(insects chirping)

2080
01:36:11,388 --> 01:36:12,524
Shit.

2081
01:36:12,557 --> 01:36:15,226
(gentle music)

2082
01:36:27,204 --> 01:36:28,204
No.

2083
01:36:34,945 --> 01:36:37,181
I gotta do just one more.

2084
01:36:38,349 --> 01:36:39,450
One last one.

2085
01:36:41,185 --> 01:36:43,454
We'll find another way.

2086
01:36:43,488 --> 01:36:46,223
It's the only thing
I've ever been good at.

2087
01:36:47,925 --> 01:36:49,059
There is no other way.

2088
01:36:49,093 --> 01:36:50,961
There's always another way.

2089
01:36:52,329 --> 01:36:53,430
We had a deal.

2090
01:36:57,868 --> 01:36:58,868
Okay?

2091
01:37:02,072 --> 01:37:03,072
Okay.

2092
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:08,812
You're right, you're right.

2093
01:37:08,846 --> 01:37:10,381
It was a stupid idea.

2094
01:37:12,449 --> 01:37:13,784
You promise?

2095
01:37:17,187 --> 01:37:18,188
I promise.

2096
01:37:20,592 --> 01:37:22,192
I'll make a few
calls in the morning

2097
01:37:22,226 --> 01:37:24,428
and I'll see what I can do.

2098
01:37:27,264 --> 01:37:28,264
Okay.

2099
01:37:29,266 --> 01:37:31,935
(gentle music)

2100
01:37:43,447 --> 01:37:44,448
(baby babbling)

2101
01:37:50,321 --> 01:37:52,222
Don't be like me.

2102
01:37:52,256 --> 01:37:55,025
(gentle music)

2103
01:37:56,461 --> 01:37:57,595
(baby babbling)

2104
01:38:00,532 --> 01:38:01,499
Thank you.

2105
01:38:01,533 --> 01:38:04,201
(gentle music)

2106
01:38:44,609 --> 01:38:47,479
(insects chirping)

2107
01:38:47,512 --> 01:38:50,314
(gentle music)

2108
01:39:04,094 --> 01:39:06,930
(birds chirping)

2109
01:39:15,205 --> 01:39:16,106
Robert.

2110
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,442
(baby crying)

2111
01:39:21,479 --> 01:39:23,648
What are you crying about?

2112
01:39:24,348 --> 01:39:25,382
Come on.

2113
01:39:29,153 --> 01:39:30,153
Robert.

2114
01:39:32,022 --> 01:39:33,591
How are you, today?

2115
01:39:34,659 --> 01:39:35,993
Robert.

2116
01:39:36,026 --> 01:39:37,027
Let's get some food.

2117
01:39:41,533 --> 01:39:44,968
(gentle upbeat music)

2118
01:39:49,707 --> 01:39:52,276
Car's still in the
driveway, White man's gone.

2119
01:39:52,309 --> 01:39:54,378
<i>I think Andrea and the
kid are still inside.</i>

2120
01:39:54,411 --> 01:39:56,413
It's taken us this
long to get this far,

2121
01:39:56,447 --> 01:39:58,583
I am not gonna let him get away.

2122
01:39:58,616 --> 01:40:00,350
[Hoffman] <i>Any ideas?</i>

2123
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:03,353
(gentle upbeat music)

2124
01:40:17,469 --> 01:40:21,171
(telephone ringing)

2125
01:40:21,205 --> 01:40:22,272
Hello.

2126
01:40:22,306 --> 01:40:23,475
Hey, is Rob there please?

2127
01:40:23,508 --> 01:40:24,308
No, he's not.

2128
01:40:24,341 --> 01:40:26,276
Can I take a message?

2129

01:47:59,163 --> 01:48:01,065
Everything's okay, honey.

2295
01:48:01,098 --> 01:48:02,800
[Andrea] What do I do?

2296
01:48:02,833 --> 01:48:04,235
Everything is gonna be okay.

2297
01:48:04,268 --> 01:48:05,169
(gentle music)

2298
01:48:05,202 --> 01:48:07,138
I want you to get off of me.

2299
01:48:07,171 --> 01:48:08,906
(baby crying)
Stop it, I have a child.

2300
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,017
Do you see that I have a child?

2301
01:48:10,041 --> 01:48:11,809
[Policeman] Please stay back.

2302
01:48:11,842 --> 01:48:13,477
Ma'am, I need you to step back.

2303

(baby crying)

2304

It's okay, it's
okay baby, it's okay.

2305
01:48:18,616 --> 01:48:19,650
I'm sorry.

[Tommy] Hey, get rid of the
stale nuts and replace 'em.

2310
01:48:40,972 --> 01:48:45,876
Hey Detective, it's
been too long already.

2311
01:48:45,910 --> 01:48:47,778
It has, it has been too long.

2312
01:48:47,812 --> 01:48:48,889
Yeah, would you
like a stiff one?

2313
01:48:48,913 --> 01:48:49,814
Maybe a drink?

2314
01:48:49,847 --> 01:48:51,015
No, no, no, no, my friend,

2315
01:48:51,048 --> 01:48:53,851
no, no, today, today
I'm serving you.

2316
01:48:53,884 --> 01:48:56,954
(gentle upbeat music)

2317
01:49:00,891 --> 01:49:03,060

(gentle upbeat music)

2319
01:49:23,948 --> 01:49:26,117
You're so serious.

2320
01:49:26,150 --> 01:49:27,151
You new?

2321
01:49:28,085 --> 01:49:29,085
No?

2322
01:49:30,121 --> 01:49:32,957
You been on the
force for a while?

2323
01:49:36,093 --> 01:49:38,763
Hear about the guy
with five dicks?

2324
01:49:38,796 --> 01:49:40,097
His pants fit like a glove.

2325
01:49:41,032 --> 01:49:42,633
(both laughing)

2326
01:49:42,666 --> 01:49:43,868
I knew it.

2327
01:49:43,901 --> 01:49:46,037
I got you, I got you.

2328
01:49:47,271 --> 01:49:50,574
(telephone ringing)

2329
01:49:56,047 --> 01:49:57,281
You know what amazes me?

2330
01:49:57,314 --> 01:49:59,150
- What's that?
- You, you.

2331
01:49:59,183 --> 01:50:00,718
- Really?
- Yes.

2332
01:50:00,751 --> 01:50:01,652
Well, thank you.

2333
01:50:01,685 --> 01:50:03,154
You knew we were watching you

2334
01:50:03,187 --> 01:50:04,755
and you just, you kept going.

2335
01:50:04,789 --> 01:50:07,058
I mean, what you weren't
loved enough as a kid?

2336
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:12,696
Is that, that is
eyeliner isn't it?

2337
01:50:13,697 --> 01:50:15,966
- Well maybe it's Maybelline.
- If it's not, then well...

2338
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,169
beautiful eyelashes.

2339
01:50:18,202 --> 01:50:19,737
What do you say,
you give us Tommy

2340
01:50:19,770 --> 01:50:20,871
and we give you less time?

2341
01:50:20,905 --> 01:50:23,007
Tommy's a businessman.

2342
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:25,009
There's nothing to give, ever.

2343
01:50:26,944 --> 01:50:28,312
And you got nothing on me, so.

2344
01:50:28,345 --> 01:50:29,213
No, no, no.

2345
01:50:29,246 --> 01:50:31,949
Well we ran your
prints with the feds.

2346
01:50:31,982 --> 01:50:33,884
- Oh?
- Yeah.

2347
01:50:33,918 --> 01:50:35,920
Vincent Smears
is a terrible name.

2348
01:50:35,953 --> 01:50:38,355
I mean, I can see why
you went with White man.

2349
01:50:38,389 --> 01:50:40,024
Well.

2350
01:50:40,057 --> 01:50:41,058
You got me.

2351
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:44,261
You guys are good.

2352
01:50:46,997 --> 01:50:50,067
Okay, I'll tell you more,

2353
01:50:50,101 --> 01:50:54,805
if you let me have a face
to face with my wife.

2354
01:50:55,574 --> 01:50:57,741
She's not exactly your
biggest fan right now.

2355
01:50:57,775 --> 01:50:58,919
Especially after
learning your name

2356
01:50:58,943 --> 01:51:00,878
isn't actually White man.

2357
01:51:00,911 --> 01:51:02,680
(door knocking)

2358
01:51:03,914 --> 01:51:05,058
Did somebody order a pizza?

2359
01:51:05,082 --> 01:51:06,183
Oh yeah, right here.

2360
01:51:07,751 --> 01:51:09,286
(bell ringing)

2361
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:10,321
Thank you.

2362
01:51:12,089 --> 01:51:13,089
There we go.

2363
01:51:14,992 --> 01:51:15,993
You want some?

2364
01:51:16,026 --> 01:51:17,070
[Snydes] No, I'm good, I'm good.

2365
01:51:17,094 --> 01:51:18,329
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm good.

2366
01:51:18,362 --> 01:51:19,362
It's all you.

2367
01:51:25,269 --> 01:51:27,037
Run the prints with
the feds again.

2368
01:51:27,071 --> 01:51:28,806
There's something wiry, okay.

2369
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:32,042
Hey, how is he?

2370
01:51:33,711 --> 01:51:35,346
Cocky and arrogant
as hell, yeah.

2371
01:51:35,379 --> 01:51:37,882
But he grows on you, yeah.

2372
01:51:37,915 --> 01:51:39,116
Oh, and get me the wife.

2373
01:51:48,826 --> 01:51:52,730
So if your name
isn't Robert White man,

2374
01:51:52,763 --> 01:51:54,131
is it just asshole or?

2375
01:51:55,065 --> 01:51:58,035
Well, there are a few things
that I may have left out.

2376
01:51:58,068 --> 01:51:59,068
Yeah.

2377
01:52:07,978 --> 01:52:09,747
So what are you just a
bank robber now?

2378
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:11,382
Is there anything
else you left out?

2379
01:52:12,349 --> 01:52:13,349
Hmm.

2380
01:52:18,355 --> 01:52:21,158
When we met, I had
one thing in my life.

2381
01:52:24,795 --> 01:52:26,063
I believed in people.

2382
01:52:29,033 --> 01:52:31,235
And you're not gonna
take that away from me.

2383
01:52:33,471 --> 01:52:34,972
Robert, look at me.

2384
01:52:37,942 --> 01:52:39,143
You gotta tell me,

2385
01:52:42,514 --> 01:52:44,381
was I a part of this big lie?

2386
01:52:46,050 --> 01:52:47,117
Was I a cover?

2387
01:52:47,151 --> 01:52:48,252
No.

2388
01:52:48,886 --> 01:52:50,988
You're the only real
thing in my life.

2389
01:52:51,755 --> 01:52:55,493
I'm more me around you than
I've ever been around anyone.

2390
01:52:58,796 --> 01:53:00,541
You taught me how to live,
you taught me how to love,

2391
01:53:00,565 --> 01:53:03,167
you taught me how to trust.

2392
01:53:06,370 --> 01:53:08,339
And that's the truth,
that's not a lie.

2393
01:53:12,876 --> 01:53:14,396
All right, well
that was pretty good.

2394
01:53:17,114 --> 01:53:19,350
I still think you're
an asshole though.

2395
01:53:19,383 --> 01:53:20,251
Also the truth.

2396
01:53:20,284 --> 01:53:21,284
Yeah.

2397
01:53:25,590 --> 01:53:26,790
I'm sorry.

2398
01:53:30,961 --> 01:53:33,197
And I know that's never gonna
be enough, but I'm sorry.

2399
01:53:33,230 --> 01:53:34,230
I fucked up.

2400
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:37,034
I fucked it up.

2401
01:53:44,441 --> 01:53:45,442
So now what?

2402
01:53:47,945 --> 01:53:49,013
You should run.

2403
01:53:50,214 --> 01:53:51,915
Get as far away
from me as you can,

2404
01:53:51,949 --> 01:53:53,417
I can handle this.

2405
01:53:53,450 --> 01:53:54,852
Clearly you can't.

2406
01:53:57,288 --> 01:53:58,088
And you know what?

2407
01:53:58,122 --> 01:53:59,256
I'm not like you Robert.

2408

(gentle music)

2409
01:54:01,125 --> 01:54:02,393

I'm all right, I'm all right.

2415

Look, I'm sorry if any of
this brought shit down on you.

2416
01:54:31,322 --> 01:54:32,399
Hey, they found you through me.

2417
01:54:32,423 --> 01:54:34,024
I should be apologizing to you.

2418
01:54:35,627 --> 01:54:37,895
What kind of time they talking?

2419
01:54:37,928 --> 01:54:40,498
I'm looking at 20.

2420
01:54:41,666 --> 01:54:44,134
I copped to all
the robberies, they're...

2421
01:54:44,168 --> 01:54:45,903
probably charge me for two.

2422
01:54:46,904 --> 01:54:50,207
Probably be out by '98, '99.

2423
01:54:52,644 --> 01:54:54,220
Yeah, you could
probably do a better deal,

2424
01:54:54,244 --> 01:54:55,446
you turn in the others.
