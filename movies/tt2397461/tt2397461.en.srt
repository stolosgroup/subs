00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:52,661
<i>This is a story
that takes place</i>

4
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:55,881
<i>on an island full of wonder.</i>

5
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,147
<i>The story of two lost souls
searching for one another,</i>

6
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:02,975
<i>although they
don't know that yet.</i>

7
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,499
<i>Because, you see,</i>

8
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:09,243
<i>no matter how alone
or out of place one feels,</i>

9
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:12,072
<i>magic is all around us</i>

10
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:14,770
<i>if you just know
where to look.</i>

11
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:06,996
Easy, girl.

12
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,304
Hey, Mama. Good girl.

13
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,436
Come on. We're gonna
take good care of you.

14
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:14,177
Come on.

15
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,659
Let's go, gang.

16
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,443
We're going
to the pound.

17
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:32,456
Come on, girl, you're okay.

18
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,371
Come on, girl.

19
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,163
Hey, Food Stamp.

20
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:29,078
New girl.

21
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:37,478
The last tenant
put the unit on Airbnb.

22
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,480
We don't play that
'cause we got rules.

23
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:41,612
No subletting,
no water beds and no pets.

24
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:43,571
- Y'all got that?
- Absolutely, Mr. Packard.

25
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:44,789
We won't even drink water
in bed.

26
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:46,051
Hey, 5-C!

27
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:49,011
If your mama
wants her dishwasher repaired,

28
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:50,447
tell her try a little grease.

29
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:51,970
She'll know
what I'm talking about.

30
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:54,234
O-Okay, Mr. Packard.

31
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:58,847
Yes, I know it's important

32
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:00,370
and I wouldn't ask unless...

33
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:01,545
Hey, Mom.

34
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:06,898
Yeah, okay, I understand.

35
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:10,859
Yeah, I'll figure it out.
Okay, yeah. Thanks.

36
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:13,470
Packard wants a bribe
for the dishwasher.

37
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,472
Splendid!
Just grab a stack of hundreds.

38
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:17,082
I think they're over there
by the gold bars

39
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,389
that Aunt Irene left us
in this rent-controlled flat.

40
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,739
How was your day, sweetheart?

41
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:24,394
Somewhere between
abysmal and atrocious.

42
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,788
Those are
two beautiful words,

43
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:28,180
which you probably
wouldn't use

44
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:29,660
if you didn't go
to such a good school.

45
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,358
Great! I'll have
an epic vocabulary to use

46
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:32,794
in my upcoming decades
of therapy.

47
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:37,451
Okay. It is hard
being the new kid at school.

48
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,930
Those other girls
still bothering you?

49
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:41,324
It's mostly
just this one girl, Florence.

50
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,631
- She calls me "Food Stamp."
- Why?

51
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:46,155
Maybe because I'm on
scholarship, or I'm small,

52
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,809
or because we just
moved here from upstate.

53
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:50,551
- I don't know.
- Well, you're different

54
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,335
to those other kids
at school.

55
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:53,858
That's good.

56
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:55,338
You know,
people who are unique,

57
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:56,644
they're the ones
that change the world.

58
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:59,081
Great!
I'll tell Florence that.

59
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:00,822
Just let me call her mother.

60
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:03,041
We can have them over here,
and we can all talk about it.

61
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:04,869
My gosh,
were you ever a child?

62
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:06,088
No.

63
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:07,916
Um, but I was bullied, too.

64
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,701
You know, you just have to
learn to stand up for yourself.

65
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,268
Well, I guess I'm just
not as brave as you.

66
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:14,226
I don't want to stand out.

67
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:15,576
I'm gonna go change

68
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,751
and then I'll collect
some more cans

69
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:18,405
for the charity drive.

70
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:21,277
Oh, did you talk to your boss
about the Chicago thing?

71
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:22,757
Okay, so, apparently,

72
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:24,715
the case has been
moved forward two weeks,

73
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,674
and I'm the only
paralegal who...

74
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,545
Mom!

75
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:30,939
I am so sorry.
I'm just gonna be gone a couple of days.

76
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:32,244
Really?

77
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:33,463
Well, who's gonna
stay with me?

78
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:35,073
I'll get a lovely sitter.
Yeah?

79
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,859
Just not Uncle Casey.

80
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:40,165
Are you kidding?
Uncle Casey?

81
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,864
Who thinks that green M&M's
are vegetables?

82
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:44,126
No, no, that is not an option.

83
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:48,478
Mmm! Wh... Wh...

84
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:49,653
Coming!

85
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,744
Hey there.

86
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,833
Sorry, I was just, uh,
grabbing a little power nap,

87
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,226
Officer Jackson.

88
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,706
What's this
you got going on in here?

89
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,751
Oh, this is
just a temporary thing.

90
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:01,926
I'm in between apartments.

91
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,101
Hmm.

92
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:04,364
Your meter's expired.

93
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,061
Actually, no,
the meter is broken.

94
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:07,758
Actually, no, it's working.

95
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:10,152
It just had this bag
over the top of it.

96
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:12,459
- Oh! Who put that there?
- Hmm.

97
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:15,984
This city.
It is so disheartening.

98
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,725
I'll get rid of that.
Do you want to give me that?

99
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,683
Just to... Okay.

100
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:21,598
No, I want to give you this.

101
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:24,166
Can we do this later?
I am so late. Okay.

102
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,342
Give it to someone else!
Pay it forward.

103
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:29,040
Ooh.

104
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:30,999
I'm okay. I'm so sorry.
I've got to go.

105
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:33,001
So late.

106
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,624
Ah! Burn. Burn.

107
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,378
Hi.

108
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:48,206
Casey Porter here
to see Mr. Harrington

109
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,251
about the illustrator job.

110
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:50,948
Hi. Yeah.

111
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:54,125
That was at 3:30 and it's...
Mm, it's 4:15.

112
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:55,866
Wow. Pretty sure
he said Mountain Time,

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,911
so guess I'm early.

114
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:58,260
No. Sorry.

115
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:00,175
Okay, then,

116
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:01,698
are these complimentary?

117
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:03,439
Sadly, yes.

118
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,746
Lunch.

119
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:20,456
Idiot!

120
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,637
- Hey!
- Hey, Malik.

121
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,987
I'm collecting cans and bottles
for my school's fundraiser.

122
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,120
- Do you have anything?
- It's Malik the Magnificent now.

123
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:34,514
I'm going to magic school.
Hey, do you wanna see a trick?

124
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:35,732
Sure.

125
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,821
Okay, a deck of cards.

126
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,651
Ooh.

127
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:43,218
Fantastic.

128
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:46,177
How about you,
Mrs. Crullerman?

129
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,876
Do you have any cans for me?

130
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,399
You can have this one,
<i>malyshka.</i>

131
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,401
No, no! Moment.

132
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,360
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

133
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:57,145
Here.

134
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,321
Condensed milk?

135
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:03,281
Magic school. Good luck.

136
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:06,023
Hey. You know, when I get really good
at magic, you know what I'm gonna do?

137
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:07,285
Make her disappear?

138
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:08,983
No, I'm gonna cut her in half.

139
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:11,376
Oh. Or that.

140
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,297
- Hey, Mrs. Jarvis.
- Hi, Emily.

141
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:21,691
- Do you have any more cans for me?
- I do.

142
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:24,346
Does Packard know you're collecting
canisters in his edifice?

143
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,522
He'll insist
on a retroactive commission.

144
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:29,481
Not if we file a 501
<i>in loco parentis.</i>

145
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:31,658
Then, she's protected.

146
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,660
You guys must be good lawyers.

147
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:36,184
Because I don't know
what you're talking about.

148
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:37,359
Hey, guys!

149
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,883
Alonso!
Get the cans for Emily!

150
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,102
Hey, you do it! I'm busy.

151
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:42,712
- I'm doing the tofu!
- Eh!

152
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:46,368
Emily, come check it out.
We got regular, seasoned...

153
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,849
What's there to know?
It's the white stuff in the water.

154
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:51,068
Here you go, Emily.

155
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:52,983
<i>Mira, mira...</i>
Two years ago,

156
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:55,943
genius here cuts his hand off
with a meat slicer.

157
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:58,380
Now he's a tofu-eating vegan.

158
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:00,338
It was a sign.

159
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,388
Doggone it.

160
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:07,737
Ah! Get out of here!

161
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:57,613
There you are.

162
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,094
Come on.

163
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:03,880
Now, just because you're lost,

164
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:07,144
it doesn't mean that you're
any less of a treasure.

165
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,885
You understand?

166
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:11,235
Oh, standing up for yourself,
are you?

167
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:13,716
Yes, yes, I know.

168
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,196
You're a dog.

169
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,893
Ah!

170
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,026
Hello.

171
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,377
Now, let's introduce you
to all the others, shall we?

172
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,077
Hope they don't mistake you
for a lobster.

173
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,648
The whole block is bonkers.

174
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:38,393
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

175
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,961
You know I said I was gonna get a sitter.

176
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,136
Yo, yo, yo!

177
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,267
What up, fam?

178
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:44,660
You promised.

179
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:48,359
- How's my favorite sister?
- Hey.

180
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,798
And my favorite little niece?

181
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:54,409
Money is gonna be
in this drawer here.

182
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,107
And emergency numbers

183
00:11:58,108 --> 00:11:59,022
here.

184
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,676
"911"?

185
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,591
Give me some credit.

186
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:06,377
Till the super fixes it,
please don't use the dishwasher.

187
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:08,902
Emily has to be at school
by 7:45.

188
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:11,905
In the morning?
What are they, farmers?

189
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,429
Ooh, Mom won't be back
till Monday.

190
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,474
So, what are we doing?

191
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:19,608
"Get a little crew together?
Hit up the club?"

192
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,001
Isn't that what you
young people say?

193
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,177
We don't say that. Ever.

194
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,222
- "Get lit?"
- Please stop.

195
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,791
All set to go.

196
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:30,793
Now, Casey,
I'm really counting on you.

197
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,577
Are you sure
you can handle this?

198
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,710
You're
bloody well right I can.

199
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:37,582
You see,
if I hadn't moved here when I was two,

200
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,454
I would've grown up
with a British accent also.

201
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,239
Bollocks.
Rubbish. Collywobbles.

202
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,241
Are you finished?

203
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,634
Dumbledore.

204
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,246
- I love you.
- Love you.

205
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,032
Look, Mags, I got this, okay?

206
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,468
Got the keys?

207
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,820
- You've been here two minutes!
- I may have lost those.

208
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:01,563
Um, okay, this is
my only other set.

209
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:04,218
- Okay.
- Do not lose those.

210
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,742
- I love you guys.
- Love you.

211
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,483
Cheerio!

212
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:11,703
Shocking.

213
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:13,140
Ah.

214
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:19,886
So, how's everything going in,

215
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,583
I'm gonna say fourth grade?

216
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,541
Sixth.

217
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:24,934
Joking.

218
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,544
Where's your sense of humor?

219
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:29,678
I lost it. On the subway.

220
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,898
I lost you one time.

221
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,205
Okay, twice
if you count Atlantic City.

222
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,120
But I won you back!

223
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,820
Hey! I'm gonna
make it up to you, okay?

224
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:43,039
We're gonna do something
super cool this weekend.

225
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:45,433
Money is absolutely no object.

226
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:48,131
As long as there's enough
of it in that drawer.

227
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,354
How are there so many
people up at this hour?

228
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,486
Hey, you want to get a coffee?

229
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,619
I'm twelve. I'm not allowed
to drink coffee.

230
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,795
- Red Bull?
- Really?

231
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,841
Whew! Being a kid sucks.

232
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:08,978
Oh, my gosh. Look,
there's an animal rescue tent!

233
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:11,328
Can we go in? Please?

234
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:14,418
My instinct is, "Sure",
so we probably shouldn't?

235
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,770
But how could I say no
to that little face

236
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:21,730
with those cheeks
and the, ah, missing tooth?

237
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,340
I just want to dust you
in sugar...

238
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:24,515
- Okay, okay, enough.
- Okay, okay.

239
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:25,734
Come on!

240
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,964
Wow. So beautiful.

241
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:39,704
- Hi!
- Hi.

242
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,663
Hi.

243
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,144
Well, you're kind of creepy.

244
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:45,885
Ah! Sorry!

245
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:54,110
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

246
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:56,460
Hi.

247
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,812
Oh, my goodness.

248
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,817
Whoa! Uncle Casey,
there's a sloth!

249
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,951
Oh. Hey.
My spirit animal.

250
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:11,911
- Whoa.
- Don't touch that.

251
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,391
Aw.

252
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,615
Why would you put that there?

253
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,183
- Shoo. Go away.
- Look at you!

254
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:26,360
Splendid backpack!

255
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,623
- It matches.
- Cool.

256
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,538
Well, you are obviously
a young lady

257
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,670
- of immaculate taste.
- Thank you.

258
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:35,630
Bridwell's the name,
and welcome to my

259
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:38,459
Tentus Animalus Rescuus.

260
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,462
Is that Latin
for "Animal Rescue Tent"?

261
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:44,073
No, it's just regular words
with "us" on the end.

262
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:45,857
Makes me sound smartus.

263
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:48,686
So, what sort of animals
are you looking for?

264
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,213
A temperamental tortoise?
A stand-up chameleon?

265
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:55,824
Maybe something small,
cheap and stuffed?

266
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,391
I want them all.

267
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:59,959
Ah, yeah, we're not really
looking for a pet.

268
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:02,570
Perfect! Follow me.

269
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:05,747
The thing about animals is
that the best time to find them

270
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,705
is when you're not looking
for them.

271
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,273
Huh, does this tent
seem bigger on the inside?

272
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:13,798
That's ridiculous!
It's smaller on the outside.

273
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,238
Is that a baby giraffe?

274
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,762
Or a long-necked hyena.

275
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,678
I can't be sure
till I tell it a joke.

276
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:26,594
Giraffes have
no sense of humor.

277
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,031
Here we are.

278
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,773
This is it.

279
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,775
- There's no animals in here.
- That's right.

280
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:35,690
You said you weren't
looking for a pet.

281
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:37,083
And we're not.

282
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:38,780
So you won't be interested
in him.

283
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,129
Who?

284
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,102
My goodness.

285
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,800
You're just the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

286
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,584
Look at you.

287
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:02,021
Aw.

288
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,849
I got you.

289
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,895
Oh, he's so cute.

290
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,071
And... And so tiny.

291
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,465
And so red.

292
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:12,988
I love that he's red.

293
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:17,340
How did he get that way?

294
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:20,604
I don't know. I found him in
the park trying to be a pigeon.

295
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:24,608
I think he's lost his family,
so he's a little confused.

296
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:26,175
Poor guy.

297
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,308
- I'll be your family.
- No, you will not.

298
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:29,831
Please, Uncle Casey?

299
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:31,920
He's so tiny,
he wouldn't bother anyone.

300
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,835
Mr. Bridwell, how big
is he gonna get?

301
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:37,186
- Well, that depends, doesn't it?
- On what?

302
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,971
On how much you love him.

303
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:43,888
Okay. Adorable. Put him back.

304
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,934
Please, just look
at this little tiny face.

305
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,676
I'm sorry. I'm new,
responsible Casey now,

306
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,243
and letting you get a little

307
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,723
radioactive micro-dog
is not responsible.

308
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,464
So give him back.

309
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,205
No, I'm not gonna
fall for that again.

310
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:58,773
Give me the dog.

311
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,602
Be careful.

312
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:08,565
Well, thank you very much for giving me
the opportunity to crush my niece's dreams.

313
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:11,351
I always wondered what it
felt like to be the bad guy.

314
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:12,830
My pleasure.

315
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,314
Oh, by the way,

316
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:19,881
do you know what sound

317
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:21,883
porcupines make
when they kiss?

318
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,061
"Ouch!"

319
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,369
Ah! Hyena.

320
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:32,372
Okay, come on.

321
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:35,201
Let's get you to school.
No word of this to anyone.

322
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,342
OMG, did you bring
your garbage to school?

323
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:49,040
No, this is the recycling.

324
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,565
For the fund raiser?
Isn't that today?

325
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,784
Yeah, but nobody
actually does it.

326
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,569
The school just wants the money.

327
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,919
- My mom wrote a check.
- Mine, too.

328
00:18:58,093 --> 00:18:59,442
Classic Food Stamp.

329
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,232
Hey! Don't listen to her.

330
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:08,712
She's just cranky because a
house fell on her wicked sister.

331
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,107
I think it's awesome
you actually did the work.

332
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:14,022
Really makes you stand out
around here.

333
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,198
It was one of the last things
I was hoping to do,

334
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:17,895
but thank you.

335
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,941
- It's Owen, right?
- You know my name?

336
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:23,249
Did I say that out loud?

337
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,164
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

338
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:26,469
I collected cans, too.

339
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,602
Really? Where are they?

340
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:32,345
My dad threw them away.
Said I looked like an Asian Oliver Twist.

341
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,955
Oh, good job, Emily!

342
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:35,696
Come on in, we're starting.

343
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:51,190
Can we get a cleanup
on aisle four?

344
00:19:57,021 --> 00:20:00,111
Don't worry, Emily.
We'll get this cleaned up.

345
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,033
<i>Another company

00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:19,957
Hey, Em!

351
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:22,046
How was your day?

352
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,441
Good talk.

353
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:34,058

355
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,073
Nothing?

356
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:02,435
What?

357
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,462
What the... Hey, it's you!

358
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:31,420
How did you get in there?

359
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:33,770
You were in my bag all day?

360
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:36,599
They're gonna think
I stole you.

361
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:38,122
Who put you in here?

362
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:43,737
Oh, my gosh, you are just the
cutest thing I've ever seen.

363
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:48,307
Maybe you could stay
for a little while, right?

364
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:54,225
Mr. Bridwell didn't tell me
your name.

365
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,576
So maybe you don't have one.

366
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,144
What about something cool
and old-fashioned?

367
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,668
Like...

368
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,800
Floyd!

369
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:05,236
No? Okay.

370
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:07,587
Um, Ebenezer!

371
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:11,460
Sorry. Um, Ishmael.
It's from the Bible.

372
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,854
No.

373
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:16,247
Clifford.

374
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:17,640
You like Clifford?

375
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:20,295
Clifford it is.

376
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:21,514
Perfect for you.

377
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:24,734
Shh! No.
Uncle Casey will hear you.

378
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:31,219
Clifford, where'd you go?
What...

379
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,485
Hey, there's my retainer.

380
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,708
You hungry, boy? Come on.

381
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:43,536
Perfect.

382
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:47,931
Clifford, no!

383
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:50,369
Those are my brand-new
slippers. Clifford!

384
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:52,153
Clifford, no, give it back.

385
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,851
Really?

386
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:57,027
I'm gonna call you Ebenezer
if you act like this.

387
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:59,508
Come on, drop it.
Drop it, Clifford.

388
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:01,118
Good boy.

389
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,782
Clifford?

390
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:15,002
Clifford! Where are you?

391
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,221
Do you like turkey, Em?

392
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:37,416
Hmm.

393
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:42,769
Where'd you go?

394
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:48,035
Oh, no.

395
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:50,559
You.

396
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,822
- You didn't.
- I didn't! I found him in my backpack.

397
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:55,782
I specifically said no to the dog
and you completely ignored me.

398
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:58,480
I swear, he just showed up.

399
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,308
Oh, it just "showed up", huh?

400
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:03,659
- What is that? What are you doing?
- Air quotes.

401
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,880
It's a thing that grown-ups do when
they say something that they don't mean.

402
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:09,360
Please, Uncle Casey,
can't he just stay for one night?

403
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,232
No! Absolutely not.
I promised your mom.

404
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:12,625
No, please.

405
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,891
I'm not gonna fall
for your little girl powers.

406
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:23,636
Oh! Okay, one night.

407
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,725
And then, first thing
in the morning,

408
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,510
he is going back to that weird old
man that we met in the animal tent.

409
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:30,730
Mm, saying that out loud
makes us going in there

410
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,514
seem like such
a poor choice.

411
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:34,864
Why? I don't understand.
Why can't I just keep him?

412
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:36,475
Because you can't have a dog!

413
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,348
One night. That's it.

414
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:41,784
Don't you...

415
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:18,560
I wish we were big and strong,

416
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:21,041
and the world
couldn't hurt us.

417
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:16,575
Oh, my gosh.

418
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:24,495
Clifford?

419
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,238
Wait, wait. I'm going to wake up.
It's all in my head.

420
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:30,806
I'm dreaming.
I'm going to wake up

421
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,983
in three, two...

422
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:36,856
Oh, my gosh, I'm not dreaming.
This is real.

423
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,727
Clifford, it's really you.

424
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:42,383
How did this happen?
How are you so huge?

425
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:44,385
I mean, it's crazy,
but it's great.

426
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,213
I did wish
for you to be big,

427
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:48,084
but I didn't mean
big on the outside.

428
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:49,346
I meant, like,

429
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,000
mentally big.

430
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:53,481
Clifford.

431
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:58,442
What are you doing?

432
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,620
No! My bed!

433
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:05,188
Clifford, no,
that's my mom's pillow!

434
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:06,537
Clifford, drop it.

435
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,888
Come on, be a good boy
and drop it.

436
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:10,063
Give it back!

437
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,115
Ew!

438
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:23,598
Bless you.

439
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:25,948
Oh, no! My computer!

440
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:28,734
Don't wag your tail. Sit, boy, sit.

441
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:32,651
Clifford!

442
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,914
Clifford, just

443
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,611
be quiet, stay here, okay?

444
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:40,006
Shh. I'll be right back, okay?
Just shh, shh, shh.

445
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,666
Casey! Casey! Casey!

446
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,668
- The meter's broken.
- Casey!

447
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:52,932
It's 7:30. Huh!
We're gonna be late for school.

448
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:54,934
- Casey.
- I'm up, I'm up, I'm up!

449
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,500
Um, about the dog...

450
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,502
You know,
I've been thinking about that.

451
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,157
And I don't want to be the no guy.
That's just not who I am.

452
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:04,508
So if you really want to keep that weird
little thing, then it's fine with me.

453
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:08,338
- So I can keep him?
- You just got to tell your mom I knew nothing about it, okay?

454
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:11,298
You snuck it back here, you hid it from me.
I had no idea it was here.

455
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,169
- I don't know if she's gonna believe that.
- She is.

456
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,781
The thing is tiny.
It's completely plausible that I would...

457
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:21,917
Run!

458
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:23,919
Come on.
We got to get out of here!

459
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,356
- There's a monster in the apartment!
- Casey, this is the dog...

460
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,619
Uncles and children first!

461
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:31,579
Stay back! Stay back.

462
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,059
...from the tent.

463
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:36,802
But last night it was...

464
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:39,630
- Yeah, I think something happened to him.
- You think?

465
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,720
He's the same dog
he was last night,

466
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:42,851
he's just a little bit bigger.

467
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:44,070
"A little bit bigger."

468
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:46,202
It is the size
of a hippopotamus.

469
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:48,857
Listen, he's not gonna hurt you, okay?
He's harmless.

470
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:51,512
He's the same dog
he was last night.

471
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:52,731
Stay.

472
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:59,128
Oh, God. It's your mom.

473
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:00,477
What am I gonna say?

474
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:02,828
I don't know.
Uh. Just act natural.

475
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:06,179
Act natural.

476
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:08,834
Shoo. Stay still.

477
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:11,358
What is happening?

478
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,927
Okay.

479
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:16,929
Remember. Natural.

480
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:19,714
Hey, girl.

481
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:22,021
- It's Maggie.
- I know, girl.

482
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:24,023
Why do you keep
calling me "girl"?

483
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:27,026
What? That's just a thing that
I say when I'm super chill.

484
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:31,291
I just wanted to call to make sure
you were on the way to school.

485
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:33,510
- We're walking to the subway now.
- Clifford, no!

486
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:35,599
- Not gonna lose her this time.
- <i>That's not funny.</i>

487
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,254
You're right, that incident is not
something we should joke about.

488
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:40,430
- Clifford, no! Whoa!
- But we are being so safe right now.

489
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:42,563
What is that noise?

490
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:43,956
Nothing.

491
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,522
But we're at our stop.
Uh, bye, girl!

492
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,394
- Get up.
- Okay, bye.

493
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:49,352
Okay. You, sit.

494
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:50,701
No, don't say that!

495
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,707
Somehow I thought
you'd be better in a crisis.

496
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:00,233
We are finding
that Bridwell guy immediately.

497
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:01,538
Why?

498
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,323
So we can get rid of that.

499
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:05,325
But you just said
I could keep him.

500
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:07,153
Yeah, that was
before he 'roided up.

501
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:08,719
Oh, come on.

502
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:10,156
How is there nothing
on this guy?

503
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,984
He doesn't even show up
on Google.

504
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:14,247
"Bridwell's Animal Rescue"...
nothing!

505
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:16,902
You can't give people pets that go
nuclear and then not be on the Internet.

506
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:19,818
That is so irresponsible.
Even by my standards.

507
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:21,645
Oh!

508
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,952
- That means he likes you.
- Oh, great.

509
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:28,565
- Who is it?
- Packard.

510
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:31,830
Oh, no, it's our psycho super. We can't have
pets in the building... we'll get evicted!

511
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:34,049
I'm here
to fix the dishwasher.

512
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:35,268
- Coming in!
- One second!

513
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:37,531
Not on my watch. Hide the dog.

514
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:38,967
Hey, hey.

515
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:43,276
I can handle this.

516
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,191
Oh! Maybe I should do
my English accent.

517
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:47,193
No!

518
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,586
Hello.
You must be Mr. Packard.

519
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:51,806
Who are you?

520
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,938
Uh, Casey.

521
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:54,765
Um, Maggie's sister. Brother.

522
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,680
- Um, this is not a great time.
- It's now or never.

523
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,030
Never?

524
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:03,078
Well, what the heck
is going on in here?

525
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:05,864
Oh, we were just doing
a little <i>feng shui.</i>

526
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:08,388
It's Chinese
for "moving things."

527
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:10,912
The dishwasher's right there.

528
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:13,132
Yeah, but the water cutoff
is in the bedroom closet.

529
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:14,785
- Don't... Don't go in here.
- No.

530
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,048
Why not?

531
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:18,746
- It's private.
- It's haunted.

532
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,792
There's a lot of girl stuff in there
that I wouldn't want you to see.

533
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,316
Yeah.

534
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,927
- I can do it, though.
- Yeah! Thanks, Uncle Casey.

535
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,581
Just get in there and give it
a little...

536
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:30,062
- You know, he's family.
- Yeah.

537
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:32,455
So, the, um...

538
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:35,458
So, the dishwasher!

539
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:38,897
So, it makes, like,
this weird crackling noise when it drains.

540
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:43,292
Shh.

541
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:47,079
No, no, no. Stop!

542
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:56,044
Everything's under control!
Just shutting off the valve.

543
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:58,612
Whoa!

544
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:01,441
Must be these old pipes, huh?

545
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:04,139
What the heck is going on
in there?

546
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:07,099
So you are going
into my room now!

547
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:09,101
Okay.

548
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:13,105
I smell dog.

549
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,584
Dog?

550
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:16,195
No, um...

551
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:19,938
That is just me.
I don't believe in deodorant.

552
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:22,723
Why mask our natural essence?
In fact, we should smell each other.

553
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:24,246
- Bring it in.
- Mmm, no. No!

554
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,639
Okay.

555
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,381
What are you doing?

556
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:54,537
Yeah, I think I found
the problem.

557
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:59,455
I got to order a part.
And I will have to return.

558
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:01,892
Well, thank you very much
for coming.

559
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,156
You are a super super.

560
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:08,638
Ow.

561
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:11,772
- Bye!
- Bye now!

562
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:12,903
Thank you!

563
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:19,998
This is the craziest thing
I have ever seen,

564
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:21,956
and I've been to Burning Man.

565
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:26,613
If we can't find Bridwell,
how are we gonna return him?

566
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,615
Good boy, Clifford.

567
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:31,705
Wait, return him?

568
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,359
We can't abandon him.
We're all he's got.

569
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:35,143
We just need to make him
small again.

570
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:36,884
He needs to see a vet.

571
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:39,278
- A vet?
- Yeah.

572
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:40,844
We don't know
what's going on with him.

573
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,803
What if he's really sick?

574
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:45,371
What if he's still growing?

575
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:47,982
What if he
grows to be a hundred feet tall?

576
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:54,510
Okay. We'll take him to a vet.

577
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:57,992
But after that, we are finding
Bridwell and we are giving him back...

578
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,211
Whoa!

579
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:04,085
...his giant dog.

580
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:07,871
Come on.

581
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:11,962
Nice job with the belts.

582
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,443
Lucky your mom went through the
Madonna phase in the '80s, huh?

583
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:16,010
Madonna?

584
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:18,360
Uh, shouldn't we try
to hide him or something?

585
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:21,668
Nah. It's New York.
No one'll even notice.

586
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:25,933
No, no. I don't care if it's Johnny
Appleseed, don't touch my petunias.

587
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:32,200
- You live here?
- Haven't you ever seen a mobile home before?

588
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:34,202
Not like this one.

589
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:37,292
My girlfriend and I broke up,
and what with my college loans, I...

590
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:39,338
- Mmm-hmm.
- Look, this is a valid,

591
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:41,035
financially responsible
life choice

592
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,646
which your mother does not
need to know about. Okay?

593
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,780
Oh, you're judging me as well.

594
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:48,956
- In.
- Come on, boy.

595
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:53,569
Just down the front here.

596
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:56,442
No, oh! Or stick your big
fat butt right on my bed.

597
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:57,573
No! Clifford.

598
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:02,926
Clifford, don't slobber on his
financially responsible life choice.

599
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:06,626
Emily!

600
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,237
Owen. What are you doing here?

601
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:12,327
I thought you were sick,
so I was gonna bring you your homework.

602
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:13,894
And I also skipped P.E.

603
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:15,765
Which I'm suddenly realizing
makes me look

604
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:17,811
a lot more desperate
than I anticipated.

605
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:20,553
- So you're not sick.
- No, we're going to the vet.

606
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,555
Don't you need an animal
for that?

607
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:30,476
Dogzilla!

608
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,955
- No!
- Is that a dog?

609
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,132
It's okay!

610
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:36,786
Nothing to see here, folks, just a big
red puppy. Nothing to be afraid of.

611
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,049
In.

612
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:42,531
We're trying to keep this quiet until
we can get him small again. So...

613
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:45,360
- Shh.
- This is so cool. You guys got to let me come.

614
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:48,189
This is the kind of education
you can't get in a classroom.

615
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:50,017
I've seen TED talks
about this.

616
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,150
Sorry, pal. I got enough on my
plate keeping one kid alive.

617
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:53,629
There is no way...

618
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:58,591
Okay, I guess
he's coming with.

619
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,378
Don't you dare.

620
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:05,598
Clifford, no. No fetch.

621
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:06,903
No fetch!

622
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:11,604
Clifford!

623
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:14,259
Huh? Oh, no. No, no, no!

624
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:15,477
Bad doggy!

625
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:24,182
- That's a good boy!
- Clifford, no!

626
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:27,054
Bad dog.

627
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:30,100
Oh!

628
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:37,717
How has he
not popped that yet?

629
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:41,634
Ah. There we are.

630
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,332
Clifford, put him down.

631
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:46,116
Drop the ball.

632
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:49,468
- Drop the ball!
- Clifford, drop it.

633
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:52,166
- Unbelievable.
- Good boy.

634
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,647
No, bad boy. Very bad boy.

635
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:56,562
He's cute.
Right over here.

636
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,742
What is he doing?

637
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,787
What is he doing?

638
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:06,441
Uh-oh.

639
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,316
- Awesome.
- Not awesome.

640
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,709
Oh!

641
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:17,670
Oh, I hope I'm not around
for number two.

642
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:19,759
Yesterday's
TV interview

643
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,413
- was brilliant, Mr. Tieran.
- Thank you.

644
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:23,415
I mean, I don't want to have
high expectations,

645
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:25,112
but I'm excited
about what I'm gonna see.

646
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:28,507
Uh, well, unfortunately,
Mr. Tieran, we haven't seen

647
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:30,683
exactly the kind of
genetically induced growth

648
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:32,032
we were hoping for.

649
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:36,645
That's a two-headed goat.

650
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:39,300
We're trying to feed the world and
you're creating more mouths to feed?

651
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:42,434
- I guess you could look at it that way.
- Oh, I am.

652
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:46,525
And it's looking back at me
with four eyes.

653
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,831
That's a little unsettling.

654
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:50,137
What's our goal?

655
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:52,444
- Well, to feed the world.
- Stop talking.

656
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:57,187
Our goal is to grow giant food
through genetic engi...

657
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:04,194
How much money have we spent?

658
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,283
Is it...

659
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:06,588
$400 million.

660
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:09,112
- That is so much money, huh?
- I know!

661
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,942
- Surely you have something to show for it. Right?
- Well...

662
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:14,901
- So far, sir, not...
- I heard a "so far."

663
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:17,251
- Did you hear "so far"?
- I heard "so far".

664
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:21,386
And what that tells me
is we have not failed.

665
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,127
We just have not succeeded
so far!

666
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,347
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen!

667
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,828
Not you.
I was talking to them.

668
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:33,746
So with that $400 million,
what have we produced?

669
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,705
Larger chickens,
cows that poop chocolate, what?

670
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:40,274
- Why don't I just show you?
- Oh! That is what I like to hear, okay?

671
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:43,364
Well, this sheep at least
has one head. That's a bonus.

672
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:46,411
And what do we have here?
Thicker wool that shears itself?

673
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,238
Fur that smells
like Santa Claus? What?

674
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:49,892
Uh, not exactly.

675
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:52,808
- We included her because she's m...
- Why, Albert?

676
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:53,983
- She's m...
- She's what?

677
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:55,594
She's...

678
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:57,422
mean.

679
00:38:58,988 --> 00:38:59,946
She's mean?

680
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,687
She's nasty.

681
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:03,384
Well, now you're just
lying to me.

682
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:06,953
- No.
- You're telling me that this gentle, sweet...

683
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:10,609
Neat, huh? Kinda cool?

684
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:12,045
That's not cool. Stop it!

685
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:15,004
This is my childhood!

686
00:39:15,178 --> 00:39:16,179
Mr. Tieran?

687
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:18,660
Colette. Yes.

688
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:20,662
From the look on your face,

689
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:22,838
I'm assuming you have
more good news.

690
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:24,362
You need to see this.

691
00:39:24,536 --> 00:39:25,798
That can't be real.

692
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:27,495
It's all over
the Internet.

693
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:30,672
There's a ten-foot dog
in upper Manhattan.

694
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:31,760
Oh, my...

695
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:33,675
- I smell your hair.
- Sorry.

696
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:37,287
Whatever made this dog
grow could make our food grow.

697
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:39,202
And then save Lyfegro.

698
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:43,729
Please find him. Yes!

699
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:03,052
Is he all right?

700
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:05,577
Eh, yeah, um, eh, well...

701
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:07,666
He's, uh... um, well...

702
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,319
Whoo!

703
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:11,060
Are you gonna examine him?

704
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:14,542
Yes. I am.
Because I'm a veterinarian!

705
00:40:14,716 --> 00:40:17,327
That's what I do,
I examine... animals.

706
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:19,895
I'm gonna take a look inside your mouth, buddy.

707
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:21,636
Oh, easy.
You want to maybe tell him?

708
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,857
- Oh, yeah. Clifford.
- That's not gonna...

709
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:26,424
Good boy.

710
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:28,251
Oh, maybe have a little
more faith in the kiddies.

711
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,514
Good job there, buddy.

712
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:31,211
All right, let me take
a look there.

713
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:36,346
Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Yeah!

714
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,958
Yes, they're large teeth
on a big red dog.

715
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:43,049
Is that a medical opinion?
It sounded very scientific.

716
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:45,878
All right, yeah, so,
why don't we get you on the scale, bud?

717
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:47,183
But slowly!

718
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:48,881
Oh!

719
00:40:49,055 --> 00:40:51,536
It's just the platinum edition
of the X-9000.

720
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,363
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- No problem.

721
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:54,887
I'm just gonna write...

722
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,064
"heavy."

723
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:01,110
All right.

724
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:06,376
Yeah, why don't you
take his temperature?

725
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:08,988
What? Why? I...

726
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:10,859
- You know him a little better.
- Uh...

727
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:15,124
- Where?
- You know.

728
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:17,649
No, I don't "know"
because I'm not a vet.

729
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:21,435
Well, in the animal
temperature-taking place?

730
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:24,307
- Which is...
- Rhymes with "nut-hole."

731
00:41:31,314 --> 00:41:33,273
- No way.
- You don't wanna... Yeah, we're not gonna do that.

732
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:35,057
Don't even worry
about that, Clifford.

733
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:36,842
- Why don't I just listen to his heart?
- Yes!

734
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:39,192
- That! Yes.
- Let's do that. Let's do that.

735
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:42,587
I'm gonna listen to your heart
now, buddy.

736
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,371
All right,
here we go.

737
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:47,243
Oh.

738
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:50,508
Yeah! Clifford, Clifford,
Clifford, Clifford...

739
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:53,293
Oh, sorry.

740
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:55,338
Well, I mean, I got to say,

741
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,299
besides being big and red,
this dog is healthy as,

742
00:41:59,473 --> 00:42:02,694
- well, healthy as a horse.
- So you don't know what made him grow like this?

743
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:03,782
I'm sorry, I don't.

744
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:05,523
Live near a toxic waste dump?

745
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,176
On top of a burial ground?

746
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,743
- I saw this movie...
- Okay, I think we're done here.

747
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,179
All right.

748
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:12,791
Crazy idea: How about
we leave Clifford here

749
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,270
with this professional

750
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:16,838
until, I don't know,
your mom comes home?

751
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:19,537
And if he hasn't shrunken back to a normal
size, then you can figure it out without me.

752
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:21,190
- Casey!
- That is cold.

753
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,499
Why don't I
finish up the examination?

754
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:26,935
You guys can just go
wait in the other room.

755
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:28,981
- All right. Thank you so much.
- Thanks.

756
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:34,813
All right, let's do
the easy part now

757
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,858
and get you
out of here, Clifford.

758
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:39,644
That's one big handsome fella
you got there.

759
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:40,906
Why, thank you.

760
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:43,082
Sign here.

761
00:42:43,256 --> 00:42:45,780
Very good, very good.

762
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:47,782
Yeah, who wants a treat, huh?
You want a treat?

763
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:49,218
There you go, buddy.

764
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:51,873
Yeah. Good job. Okay.

765
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:53,309
No, no,
you'll get another treat

766
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:54,615
in a little while.

767
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:56,835
Another treat
in a little while.

768
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:58,924
You'll get it in a little...

769
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,407
Thank you.

770
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,800
You know, I've got to say,

771
00:43:05,974 --> 00:43:07,541
I've never seen a dog
that big before.

772
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:09,282
He was tiny last night.

773
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:13,286
Really?

774
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,158
- You didn't happen to get him from Bridwell, did you?
- How'd you know?

775
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:19,771
Sweetheart, I have been working in
this office for more than 20 years.

776
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:22,643
Whenever anyone brings
a unique animal in,

777
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:24,471
it always seems to come
from Bridwell.

778
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:26,778
This one guy
couldn't speak a word

779
00:43:26,952 --> 00:43:29,041
until Bridwell gave him
a parakeet.

780
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:32,522
That bird kept repeating
positive affirmations daily.

781
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:34,176
Now the guy
can't stop talking!

782
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,962
Another woman, she couldn't walk.

783
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:38,441
She couldn't even move!

784
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,313
Bridwell gave her
a spider monkey.

785
00:43:40,487 --> 00:43:41,575
- Every night...
- Lucille, help!

786
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,055
...it massages
her feet,

787
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:45,666
and since then,
she's taken up tap dancing.

788
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,626
- Wow, this guy's like a wizard!
- Do you think he could make Clifford small again?

789
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,932
Are you kidding?
That's nothing for a man like Bridwell.

790
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:52,673
The guy
could perform miracles!

791
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,675
- How do we find him?
- You don't.

792
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:57,112
He's more of the
there-when-you-need-him type of guy.

793
00:43:57,286 --> 00:44:00,028
What do you do,
say his name three times and rub a lamp?

794
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:01,508
So cute.

795
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:03,641
Have you got any information
on your computer?

796
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:05,947
- What kind of dumb question is that?
- Dumb question?

797
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:07,645
He just suggested
rubbing a lamp.

798
00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:09,603
That's it!
I know how to find him.

799
00:44:09,777 --> 00:44:12,650
Bridwell was at our school yesterday.
He set up his tent there.

800
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:15,653
So that must mean he had to fill
out paperwork with his info on it.

801
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:18,394
- So the information is on the school's computer.
- Exactly!

802
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:24,009
We hit the school fast,
get the info on Bridwell, and we bounce.

803
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:25,314
I'll get Clifford
something to eat.

804
00:44:25,488 --> 00:44:26,925
Is it safe to leave
the keys up there?

805
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,491
Who's gonna
want to steal this?

806
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,276
Sometimes you pray
for a miracle

807
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,843
to save your company
from ruin,

808
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:34,584
and then you actually get it!

809
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:36,412
But we don't
have him yet, sir.

810
00:44:36,586 --> 00:44:39,372
Oh, come on, it's hard to hide
a ten-foot red dog, Colette.

811
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:41,287
And what is this?

812
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:43,376
- It's an I.D. chip.
- It's an I.D. chip.

813
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,422
And when this little guy finds its
way into our new large friend...

814
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:52,559
...the dog becomes
Lyfegro's property.

815
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:55,257
And red becomes
my new favorite color.

816
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:57,564
Mr. Tieran.

817
00:44:57,738 --> 00:44:59,479
- What?
- Sir?

818
00:44:59,653 --> 00:45:01,002
- Yeah.
- Take a look at this.

819
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:03,135
This girl appears with the dog

820
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:06,573
- in 67% of the images that we've examined.
- Oh, that's unfortunate.

821
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:11,186
Now, I've traced the crest on her
uniform to an elite private school.

822
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,971
Ugh! That's a litter
of terrible.

823
00:45:13,145 --> 00:45:16,365
- And...
- Oh. All right.

824
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:20,456
"Emily Elizabeth Howard."

825
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,675
Bingo!

826
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:29,030
Hey,
that is a lovely broach!

827
00:45:29,204 --> 00:45:31,424
Could you break a 20?

828
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:34,035
There's kids in the hall selling peanut
brittle, and I got a thing for P britty.

829
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:36,821
- Peanuts? Ugh!
- Yeah.

830
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:39,214
Just down the hall.
Far as you can go!

831
00:45:40,215 --> 00:45:41,651
She does not like peanuts.

832
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,918
Nice job.

833
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:49,747
I'll lift the intel...
stealth mode.

834
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:51,574
They'll never even know
we were here.

835
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,141
That would've sounded
so much cooler

836
00:45:53,315 --> 00:45:55,013
if you weren't holding
a SpongeBob flash drive.

837
00:45:55,187 --> 00:45:56,579
Shh.

838
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,016
Working.

839
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:04,326
Charming.

840
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,504
Hello, good sir!

841
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:10,376
How are you?

842
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:13,422
I'm gonna guess that you're
either the superintendent

843
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:17,470
or you're a part of the New York
Lantern Preservation Society.

844
00:46:17,644 --> 00:46:19,602
- What do you want, smart aleck?
- Okay.

845
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,996
I need some information on one
of your tenants, please.

846
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:25,304
Well, if you think I'm gonna
divulge some confidential infor...

847
00:46:25,478 --> 00:46:26,827
There we are.

848
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:28,873
- What do you need to know?
- Yes.

849
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:31,484
If you could just let me know
if you've seen these beings.

850
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:35,749
I knew I smelled a dog.

851
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,586
And one more, please.

852
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:50,155
Thanks.

853
00:46:53,027 --> 00:46:53,941
Stay! Stay, stay!

854
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:55,682
Dog!

855
00:46:58,293 --> 00:47:00,121
Oh! What the heck?

856
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:03,733
Hey, Food Stamp.

857
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:05,300
Thought you
weren't here today.

858
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:06,780
Hi, Florence.

859
00:47:06,954 --> 00:47:08,826
Oh, you know, if you need
extra food for home,

860
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,176
I'm sure we could organize
a food drive or something.

861
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,830
I'm kind of in a rush.

862
00:47:22,448 --> 00:47:24,754
Do you know
how much this blouse cost?

863
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:26,452
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

864
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:28,889
You're an accident!
You shouldn't even be here.

865
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:32,284
Why do you get to come here for
free when everybody else has to pay?

866
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:35,853
Clifford!

867
00:47:36,766 --> 00:47:38,072
How'd you get in here?

868
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:39,769
That's the dog
all over Instagram!

869
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:41,423
Is that Emily's dog?

870
00:47:41,597 --> 00:47:43,643
Come on, let's go.

871
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:45,950
Clifford, what?

872
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:48,648
What are you doing?
Why are you pushing me?

873
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:50,171
Can we pet him?

874
00:47:50,345 --> 00:47:51,477
Um, sure.

875
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,783
This is my dog, Clifford.

876
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:56,395
- How is he so big?
- He's so cute.

877
00:47:56,569 --> 00:47:58,092
I love him!

878
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,529
Oh, this is perfect.

879
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:02,183
The biggest nobody in school

880
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:04,142
has the biggest freak
in the world.

881
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:07,058
- I guess freaks of a feather...
- He's not a freak!

882
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:09,669
What did you say to me?

883
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:15,544
You're just mad 'cause he stole
all the attention from you.

884
00:48:15,718 --> 00:48:17,155
Whoa!

885
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,074
Well,
that means he likes you.

886
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,120
Burn!

887
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:34,215
Okay, time to go.

888
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:36,217
Yes, definitely time to go.

889
00:48:42,615 --> 00:48:45,183
Okay. We can't risk Packard
seeing Clifford.

890
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:47,750
Owen, you stay in the truck.

891
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,317
Wait a minute. What...

892
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:52,668
Oh, and maybe get Clifford some water.
Thanks.

893
00:48:52,842 --> 00:48:54,627
Okay, we plug
into your laptop,

894
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:57,456
download the info on Bridwell,
and then get out of here.

895
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,154
Oh, my God.

896
00:49:00,328 --> 00:49:02,243
- No.
- We're evicted?

897
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,203
This can't
be happening.

898
00:49:09,685 --> 00:49:11,383
Now I've really done it.

899
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:18,607
This looks very complicated,
Mr. Jarvis!

900
00:49:18,781 --> 00:49:23,134
I'm not even sure if you're on the
right step for what I was reading you.

901
00:49:23,308 --> 00:49:25,919
Did you even read the legal
disclaimer on self-installation?

902
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:28,661
Certainly, Mrs. Jarvis!
In what world would I ever...

903
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,839
Somebody help! Somebody help him, please!

904
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:34,972
Somebody help!

905
00:49:35,146 --> 00:49:36,582
Clifford!
What are you doing?

906
00:49:36,756 --> 00:49:38,758
- Priscilla!
- Jeron, please!

907
00:49:38,932 --> 00:49:41,413
- Somebody grab a ladder!
- Somebody!

908
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:44,024
- Clifford!
- He's slipping!

909
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:46,200
Jeron, please!

910
00:49:46,374 --> 00:49:47,723
Hold on, man!

911
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,378
Help, please!

912
00:49:51,814 --> 00:49:52,902
Jeron!

913
00:49:59,387 --> 00:50:02,521
You just got fetched
by a big red dog!

914
00:50:04,827 --> 00:50:06,699
That was incredible!

915
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:09,484
Thank you.

916
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:11,660
Whose giant dog is this?

917
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:14,359
It's Emily's!
It's Emily's dog.

918
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:17,231
Emily! Your dog
just saved my life!

919
00:50:19,538 --> 00:50:20,669
Clifford?

920
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:23,977
Hey, Emily,
did you see that?

921
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:25,631
It was the greatest
Frisbee catch ever!

922
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:28,025
Clifford, good boy. Good boy.

923
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:29,765
Thank goodness.

924
00:50:29,939 --> 00:50:32,812
This is my dog, Clifford,
and that's my Uncle Casey.

925
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:36,468
Wait, Packard
lets you have this dog?

926
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:40,124
Um, not exactly.
But we're trying to figure it out.

927
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:44,345
Oh, Owen, we couldn't get the computer.
We were completely locked out.

928
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,652
- Really?
- Yeah.

929
00:50:46,826 --> 00:50:48,741
All right, I'll try
to figure something out.

930
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:49,959
Thanks.

931
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,228
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

932
00:50:57,402 --> 00:50:58,751
Can me and Emily
borrow your computer?

933
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:00,100
Of course you may.

934
00:51:00,274 --> 00:51:01,493
Let me take
some action shots

935
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:02,798
- as I'm walking with him.
- Yeah?

936
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:04,713
It's not your fault.

937
00:51:04,887 --> 00:51:07,238
Oh, it is my specialty.

938
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:10,197
Screwing stuff up
for your mom.

939
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:12,852
I bet you didn't know your mom
got a scholarship to Oxford.

940
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:15,115
- She did?
- Yeah.

941
00:51:16,203 --> 00:51:19,380
Wanted to go back to England
for college.

942
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:22,514
And then our mom died,
Dad went to pieces.

943
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:26,344
So she stayed here
to help raise me.

944
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,304
She sacrificed everything.

945
00:51:30,478 --> 00:51:34,569
This is how I repay her:
"Surprise! You're homeless."

946
00:51:36,223 --> 00:51:38,878
That's why no one
ever believes in me, Em.

947
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:43,143
Holy cow!

948
00:51:43,317 --> 00:51:44,884
Guys! I got into the file!

949
00:51:45,058 --> 00:51:47,191
I found a letter that Bridwell
sent to the school.

950
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:50,324
But check this out: One of the days he
said he wasn't available is tomorrow.

951
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:54,154
Because he's gonna be at St. Benedict's
Hospital for a prior appointment.

952
00:51:54,328 --> 00:51:56,243
- So we can find Bridwell tomorrow!
- Exactly.

953
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:57,810
I'll be right back.

954
00:51:57,984 --> 00:51:59,507
<i>We've got eyes on her.</i>

955
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:01,118
- Mrs. Jarvis!
- What? No.

956
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:03,424
Have you not listened
to a word that I've said?

957
00:52:03,598 --> 00:52:06,645
- Emily, we're not playing this game anymore. This is over.
- No.

958
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:09,474
We're calling Animal Control,
a zoo, a carnival, whatever.

959
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:11,389
Oh! Hello!

960
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:12,912
You must be Emily Elizabeth.

961
00:52:13,086 --> 00:52:14,348
Who are you?

962
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:16,307
I'm Zac Tieran, from Lyfegro.

963
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:19,092
It is so nice to meet you.

964
00:52:19,962 --> 00:52:21,355
Here's my card.

965
00:52:21,529 --> 00:52:23,662
You are a lifesaver,
young lady.

966
00:52:23,836 --> 00:52:25,707
I cannot thank you enough
for finding our dog.

967
00:52:25,881 --> 00:52:28,928
- Your dog?
- One of our clumsy janitors left the gate open

968
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:31,278
and this large fella
slipped away from the lab,

969
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:32,714
didn't ya, big guy?

970
00:52:32,888 --> 00:52:34,107
Okay.

971
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:35,587
So,

972
00:52:35,761 --> 00:52:38,590
I'm sure he has been
a huge inconvenience,

973
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:40,592
so if I may,

974
00:52:40,766 --> 00:52:43,116
I would like
to offer you this.

975
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,118
I'm really coming around
to this guy.

976
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:46,467
- Hold on.
- All right.

977
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:48,861
Well, don't hold on. We...

978
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:51,516
- Can I have a minute?
- Sure.

979
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:54,171
- What are you doing?
- Ugh, I hate children.

980
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:01,352
This fixes everything.
Clifford goes home,

981
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:02,701
we bribe our way back
into the apartment,

982
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:04,920
no one knows any of this
ever happened,

983
00:53:05,094 --> 00:53:08,881
and, well, I will take a very
small babysitting fee off the top.

984
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:11,449
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

985
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:12,972
You're lying.

986
00:53:13,146 --> 00:53:15,366
- Excuse me? What?
- Ah, that's a little strong.

987
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,542
You said when Clifford escaped
he was big.

988
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:19,500
I found him when he was small.

989
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:20,719
Oh. That's weird.

990
00:53:20,893 --> 00:53:22,373
Everything okay, Emily?

991
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:25,202
- Hold your roll.
- I was talking to Emily, my friend.

992
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:27,856
- Everything's fine.
- Well, good. I'm Alonso with the Neighborhood Watch.

993
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,729
- We're watching you! But we're not seeing much.
- Oh.

994
00:53:30,903 --> 00:53:33,427
I tried to be nice. Albert!

995
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:34,994
Sorry.

996
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:37,083
Thank you.

997
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:38,171
Clifford, run!

998
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:40,260
- No. No, no, no!
- Emily!

999
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:41,609
Get him! Get him!

1000
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:43,307
We need backup,
now!

1001
00:53:45,396 --> 00:53:47,136
- Clifford! Come here, boy!
- Come on!

1002
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:49,922
- Come, everybody!
- What do I pay you people for?

1003
00:54:00,149 --> 00:54:01,629
In there! Go!

1004
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:04,023
- Oh, no.
- Get into the truck! Go!

1005
00:54:04,197 --> 00:54:05,590
- Okay.
- Hurry, let's go!

1006
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,071
Clifford, come on,
we got to get to the truck!

1007
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,683
- Come on!
- Come on, come on!

1008
00:54:11,857 --> 00:54:13,119
Help me block the door.

1009
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,602
That'll hold them.

1010
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,317
Chips!

1011
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:44,672
- Don't make me hurt you.
- Alonso!

1012
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:52,158
Raul!

1013
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:53,942
Oh, my bad.

1014
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:00,253
There!

1015
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:02,037
What are you doing?

1016
00:55:02,211 --> 00:55:04,213
- I'm getting Clifford out of here.
- You know how to drive?

1017
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:06,041
If Casey can do it,
how hard can it be?

1018
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:07,216
Oh, Lord.

1019
00:55:10,132 --> 00:55:12,439
Try that stick thingamabobber.
My dad uses it sometimes.

1020
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,009
Whoa, whoa!

1021
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:24,582
Whoa!

1022
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:26,105
Okay, not "R".

1023
00:55:26,279 --> 00:55:27,628
This is both unsafe
and illegal!

1024
00:55:27,802 --> 00:55:29,021
That's two firsts for me.

1025
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:33,939
Oh.

1026
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:35,897
- Ow!
- Sorry.

1027
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:48,040
Whew.

1028
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:56,483
- I... I am sure we're fine.
- No, we're not fine.

1029
00:55:56,657 --> 00:55:58,442
We're not fine!
We're not fine!

1030
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:01,096
Her mother is literally
gonna kill me.

1031
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,663
This truck
doesn't have airbags.

1032
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:04,970
Please keep that in mind
while we're crashing.

1033
00:56:05,144 --> 00:56:06,972
Cops! Be cool.

1034
00:56:09,191 --> 00:56:10,889
What are you doing?
Two hands on the wheel!

1035
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:12,107
Two hands! Even I know that!

1036
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:13,718
Two hands!

1037
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:18,592
- They're coming!
- Uh, take a left! Take a left!

1038
00:56:20,638 --> 00:56:21,639
Whoa!

1039
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:25,033
That's my building up ahead!

1040
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:26,644
Garage is open.
Turn left right here!

1041
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:28,950
The garage is right there!
Turn now!

1042
00:56:29,124 --> 00:56:30,212
Whoa!

1043
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:39,700
Okay. Let's never
do that again.

1044
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:43,835
You have
the toxicity reports, right?

1045
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:45,924
Yes, I do.

1046
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:49,493
It's Emily's school.
Just one...

1047
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:50,885
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's fine.

1048
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:52,321
Oh, hi, Mrs. McKinley.

1049
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:54,846
Hi, Maggie. I just wanted
to check on Emily,

1050
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,761
see how she's feeling

1051
00:56:56,935 --> 00:56:59,067
- since she wasn't in school today.
- What?

1052
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:02,984
Oh, for the love of Mike!

1053
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:04,290
Siobhan, he's with us.

1054
00:57:04,464 --> 00:57:06,161
Put the Swiffer down.

1055
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:08,729
Are you insane?
You're driving now?

1056
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:10,339
What are you upset about?

1057
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,341
I still can't get
my butt cheeks to unclench!

1058
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:14,605
Where are we?
Is this a museum?

1059
00:57:14,779 --> 00:57:16,302
It's just a pied-à-terre.

1060
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:17,912
You live here?

1061
00:57:18,086 --> 00:57:20,045
Yeah.

1062
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:21,873
Oh, geez.

1063
00:57:23,788 --> 00:57:26,355
- Your turn.
- What? I don't know what to say!

1064
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:28,227
I'd go with anything
but the truth.

1065
00:57:31,143 --> 00:57:32,449
Hey, girl!

1066
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:34,538
Emily, I just got a call
from the school,

1067
00:57:34,712 --> 00:57:36,322
and they said
that you weren't there today.

1068
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:40,195
What? That's crazy talk, girl!
Of course I was at school.

1069
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:42,371
- Okay.
- You know what? Casey can explain.

1070
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:45,549
You're a better liar than me.

1071
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:51,816
Hey! There must have been
some confusion at the office.

1072
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,295
I heard they had
a peanut scare today.

1073
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,384
<i>But I will straighten
it out Monday.</i>

1074
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,082
No problemo.

1075
00:57:58,213 --> 00:58:00,215
Brutus! No!

1076
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,914
- Is that a dog?
- A dog?

1077
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:06,047
What? No. No. No.

1078
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:07,135
It's the, uh,

1079
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:08,615
dishwasher.

1080
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:11,313
Just try kicking it.

1081
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,751
I think he wants
to smell Clifford's...

1082
00:58:15,056 --> 00:58:16,188
you know.

1083
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:19,104
Okay. Hey, Brutus.

1084
00:58:19,278 --> 00:58:21,236
Look, there. It stopped.

1085
00:58:23,108 --> 00:58:24,152
You know...

1086
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,201
He done?

1087
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:30,985
Good boy.

1088
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:32,987
By the way, have you thought
about finding a new apartment?

1089
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:34,423
It might be time for a change.

1090
00:58:36,948 --> 00:58:38,166
Uh, sorry.

1091
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:40,560
Just checked my phone battery.

1092
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:42,344
It's on, like, 1%
if you lose me.

1093
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:47,741
Whoa! Brutus!

1094
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,352
Well, you don't
see that every day.

1095
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,571
Brutus.

1096
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:56,184
He's okay. He's okay.

1097
00:58:56,358 --> 00:58:58,099
Really?

1098
00:58:58,273 --> 00:59:00,188
Maybe it's time to feed him.

1099
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:03,235
Okay, first of all,
thank you so much for seeing us, Captain.

1100
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:05,063
- Chief.
- Sure, of course.

1101
00:59:05,237 --> 00:59:07,282
- You telling me this dog is yours?
- Absolutely.

1102
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:10,068
We were in the middle of an
experimental trial when it escaped.

1103
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:12,897
This creature
is a medical mutant.

1104
00:59:13,071 --> 00:59:14,986
- Medical mutant?
- That's right.

1105
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,596
And I'm worried
that this mutation

1106
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:19,817
could potentially
jump species.

1107
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:20,905
Jump species?

1108
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:22,471
We need to capture this animal

1109
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,473
and return it to my lab
as soon as possible

1110
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:27,259
or the consequences
could be catastrophic.

1111
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:29,391
Picture this, okay?
You're going outside.

1112
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,089
- Cockroaches that size...
- Ugh!

1113
00:59:31,263 --> 00:59:32,830
...flying around
the air! Okay?

1114
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:35,397
Rats that size walking around
the grocery store with you.

1115
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,660
Flying rats.

1116
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,183
- Flying rats!
- Fl...

1117
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:40,577
- Let me make a call.
- Great, make a call.

1118
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,975
He eats like an animal.

1119
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:50,064
Well, he is an animal.

1120
00:59:50,238 --> 00:59:51,675
I'm talking about him.

1121
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,590
What?

1122
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:58,943
- <i>We take you to breaking news.</i>
- Hey, guys. Look!

1123
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:01,510
<i>I'm Chief Watkins,
New York City Police Department.</i>

1124
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:03,556
<i>We are offering
a $25,000 reward</i>

1125
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:05,732
<i>for any information
leading to the capture</i>

1126
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:07,734
<i>of the big red dog.</i>

1127
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:09,736
- <i>The safety of the citizens...</i>
- And look who's there.

1128
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,608
<i>...of New York
is our primary concern.</i>

1129
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:14,915
<i>We are currently working
in conjunction with Lyfegro.</i>

1130
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:16,351
That is a very slappable face.

1131
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:20,312
<i>Please, if you see something,
say something.</i>

1132
01:00:20,486 --> 01:00:21,792
- Owen! I'm home!
- <i>Any questions?</i>

1133
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:23,271
Dad!

1134
01:00:25,273 --> 01:00:26,274
Hey!

1135
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:28,146
Who are you?

1136
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,670
Um, this is Casey
and that's Emily.

1137
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:32,890
- Emily?
- Yeah.

1138
01:00:33,064 --> 01:00:34,456
- As in the Emily?
- Dad!

1139
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,720
Sorry.

1140
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:38,635
He's never mentioned you.
Ever.

1141
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,725
Not once.

1142
01:00:41,899 --> 01:00:44,510
So, can they spend the night?
They've got a problem.

1143
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:45,903
What's the problem?

1144
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,785
I withdraw the question.

1145
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:00,831
Your dad
owns this place?

1146
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:02,746
Yeah, it's, um,
500 acres.

1147
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,965
A lot of space, tons of animals.

1148
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:07,751
- It's perfect for Clifford.
- And it's thousands of miles away.

1149
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:09,317
Em,
the cops are after us.

1150
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:14,279
Okay, bye.

1151
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:16,194
Okay, so things are falling
into place.

1152
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:18,631
My shipping company has a
freighter docked in Newark.

1153
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:20,154
Leaves for Hong Kong
tomorrow night.

1154
01:01:20,328 --> 01:01:22,243
Owen showed you our place
outside Shanghai.

1155
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:24,289
It's fully staffed.
Clifford would be safe.

1156
01:01:24,463 --> 01:01:26,073
We're not gonna
send Clifford away.

1157
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:27,901
- Emily.
- We're not doing that!

1158
01:01:28,075 --> 01:01:29,294
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

1159
01:01:29,468 --> 01:01:31,165
Would you mind
if I spoke with Emily alone?

1160
01:01:31,339 --> 01:01:33,254
Of course. Come on, Owen,
I'll tuck you in.

1161
01:01:33,428 --> 01:01:35,126
Dad!

1162
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:38,259
I never tuck him in. Ever.

1163
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:40,218
Let's go, big man.

1164
01:01:40,392 --> 01:01:42,002
- Good night.
- Bye, guys.

1165
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:44,439
We're having words
about that debacle.

1166
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:48,139
Debacle?

1167
01:01:48,313 --> 01:01:50,794
- China's not that far away.
- Really?

1168
01:01:50,968 --> 01:01:53,971
Okay, that's a terrible lie.
It is very far away.

1169
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:56,843
But this is definitely
what's best for him.

1170
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:57,931
I don't care.

1171
01:01:58,105 --> 01:01:59,193
Clifford came to me

1172
01:01:59,367 --> 01:02:01,979
when I was alone
and had no friends.

1173
01:02:02,153 --> 01:02:05,199
He's the best part of my life.
I'm not gonna abandon him.

1174
01:02:05,373 --> 01:02:06,810
We don't have a choice.

1175
01:02:06,984 --> 01:02:08,115
We've been evicted.

1176
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:09,595
And now,
according to the news,

1177
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:10,988
we're, like, actual fugitives.

1178
01:02:11,162 --> 01:02:12,816
Bridwell could help us!

1179
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:15,079
You heard Lucille at the vet's office.
He can do it!

1180
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:16,297
We just need to find him.

1181
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:18,082
- Emily...
- Casey,

1182
01:02:18,256 --> 01:02:21,041
what if you found someone
who was so full of love

1183
01:02:21,215 --> 01:02:23,478
they made you feel
like you could do anything?

1184
01:02:23,652 --> 01:02:26,003
How would you feel
if you had to let that go?

1185
01:02:30,616 --> 01:02:32,139
Okay.

1186
01:02:32,313 --> 01:02:34,315
We'll go to the hospital,
look for Bridwell.

1187
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:37,666
But if we can't find him,
or he can't help,

1188
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:40,408
Clifford's got to get
on that boat tomorrow night.

1189
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:45,152
Deal?

1190
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:47,546
Deal.

1191
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,908
Looks like we're on the couch,
T-bone.

1192
01:03:08,088 --> 01:03:10,830
Whoa. This place
is $27 mil on Zillow?

1193
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:13,615
Hey, T-bone,

1194
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,400
does Owen
have an older sister?

1195
01:03:15,574 --> 01:03:16,880
Okay.

1196
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:18,882
Just asking for a friend.
Understood.

1197
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:21,580
Dude. Forget I asked.

1198
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,376
Okay.

1199
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,465
Owen, you stay with Clifford.
We'll go find Bridwell.

1200
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:38,989
Why do you always
leave me behind?

1201
01:03:39,163 --> 01:03:40,512
Because it's the
kind of education

1202
01:03:40,686 --> 01:03:41,818
you can't get
in a classroom.

1203
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:44,429
Act natural.

1204
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:48,563
Clifford,
you sense things.

1205
01:03:48,737 --> 01:03:50,827
You sense any chemistry
between me and Emily?

1206
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:51,915
Because I sense...

1207
01:03:54,482 --> 01:03:56,354
Clifford, gross!

1208
01:03:56,528 --> 01:03:59,009
This is what killed
the dinosaurs!

1209
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:00,445
There are rules!

1210
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:02,839
You can't let one rip
in confined space!

1211
01:04:04,536 --> 01:04:07,844
Okay, Clifford,
that was really uncool.

1212
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:15,286
Clifford! Get in the truck.

1213
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:19,507
Are you looking for someone?

1214
01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:21,640
Yeah.
Um, older guy, silver hair.

1215
01:04:21,814 --> 01:04:24,904
Tall. Kinda speaks in riddles.

1216
01:04:25,078 --> 01:04:28,342
That... That's his tie!
He wears a polka-dot bow tie.

1217
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:30,344
- Oh.
- What?

1218
01:04:30,518 --> 01:04:33,304
The man with that tie?
Your friend?

1219
01:04:35,393 --> 01:04:36,698
He passed away this morning.

1220
01:04:38,222 --> 01:04:39,223
No.

1221
01:04:39,919 --> 01:04:41,007
That's impossible.

1222
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:42,313
I'm sorry.

1223
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,365
He was so kind and magical.

1224
01:04:51,539 --> 01:04:52,758
How could he die?

1225
01:04:54,673 --> 01:04:57,502
If there's a memorial,
I could email or something.

1226
01:04:57,676 --> 01:04:59,852
Yeah, thanks.

1227
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:03,943
Uh, here you go.

1228
01:05:04,117 --> 01:05:05,684
What about Clifford?

1229
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:08,426
I can't believe it.

1230
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,255
Bridwell was our only hope.

1231
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,480
I bet that's for us.

1232
01:05:20,264 --> 01:05:22,005
It'll be fine. Come on.

1233
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,884
I just can't believe
that Bridwell is,

1234
01:05:32,058 --> 01:05:33,538
you know.

1235
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,934
We can go back
to my apartment and hide.

1236
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:40,719
Owen, the New York City
Police force is after us.

1237
01:05:40,893 --> 01:05:42,677
There's no more hiding.

1238
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:45,637
If they find us, they're gonna
hand Clifford over to Tieran.

1239
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:48,422
So what do we do?

1240
01:05:50,903 --> 01:05:52,209
- No.
- Em.

1241
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,688
I'm not gonna give him up!

1242
01:05:53,862 --> 01:05:54,863
We've got to do
what's best for him.

1243
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:56,648
I'm what's best for him.

1244
01:05:57,649 --> 01:05:59,651
Not if you can't
keep him safe.

1245
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:14,622
Call your father.

1246
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,282
All right,
everything's been arranged.

1247
01:06:22,456 --> 01:06:25,764
Colin will stay with Clifford from the tug to
the freighter, then all the way to Shanghai.

1248
01:06:25,938 --> 01:06:27,418
He'll be met at the port
by my staff,

1249
01:06:27,592 --> 01:06:28,985
and they'll bring
him to the house.

1250
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:30,987
Come on, guys,
we got to get going!

1251
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:33,206
Mr. Yu, we can't
thank you enough.

1252
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:34,381
You're welcome.

1253
01:06:36,862 --> 01:06:38,429
Bye, Clifford.

1254
01:06:38,603 --> 01:06:40,518
I hope to see you
again someday.

1255
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:44,174
Okay, go wait in the car.

1256
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:48,482
- I'm sorry it worked out like this, Emily.
- Thank you.

1257
01:06:51,703 --> 01:06:53,052
Hey.

1258
01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:57,839
I know you don't
understand, Clifford.

1259
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,538
It's just...
It's not safe for you here.

1260
01:07:00,712 --> 01:07:03,193
You're just too big.

1261
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:06,892
And if they find you,
they'll do really bad things to you.

1262
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:08,633
I can't let that happen.

1263
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:13,986
There are no other dogs
like you.

1264
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:17,511
And people, they just...

1265
01:07:17,685 --> 01:07:20,079
They don't like things
that are different.

1266
01:07:29,784 --> 01:07:32,831
What's the matter?
What's he doing?

1267
01:07:33,005 --> 01:07:35,268
I think he's trying
to be small.

1268
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:40,969
I'm sorry I let you down, Clifford.

1269
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:44,103
I thought I could save you
and I couldn't.

1270
01:07:51,197 --> 01:07:53,373
We have to be big and strong.

1271
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:55,723
Remember?

1272
01:07:55,897 --> 01:07:57,769
So that the world
can't hurt us.

1273
01:08:01,468 --> 01:08:03,557
You have to go
with these men now.

1274
01:08:05,255 --> 01:08:06,952
It'll be okay.

1275
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,823
Hey, hey.

1276
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,696
Real proud of you.

1277
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,197
Bye, Clifford!

1278
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:38,026
I love you with all my heart!

1279
01:08:39,419 --> 01:08:41,160
Be good for me, okay?

1280
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:02,616
Apparently, the county
was sued in 1994.

1281
01:09:04,314 --> 01:09:06,751
- Maggie! Is that Emily?
- What?

1282
01:09:06,925 --> 01:09:09,362
<i>...leading to the
capture of this Internet sensation.</i>

1283
01:09:09,536 --> 01:09:12,017
- <i>The city-wide search continues in New York City...</i>
- What's the matter?

1284
01:09:12,191 --> 01:09:14,193
- <i>...for the big red dog.</i>
- That's my daughter.

1285
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,586
<i>He was last seen in Harlem.</i>

1286
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:16,761
- You go, yes.
- Yeah.

1287
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:22,810
Didn't get much sleep, huh?

1288
01:09:24,551 --> 01:09:25,900
Breakfast?

1289
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:36,172
I know you don't drink coffee, but feels
like now might be the time to start.

1290
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,177
He's gonna
be happy there.

1291
01:09:41,351 --> 01:09:43,483
You know who's not
gonna be happy?

1292
01:09:43,657 --> 01:09:46,660
My mom. Living in a van.

1293
01:09:46,834 --> 01:09:50,229
Nah, I think she'll
get used to the van life.

1294
01:09:50,403 --> 01:09:52,753
Sleeping on the floor.
Peeing in a bucket.

1295
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:57,193
I woke up to some fun texts
from her this morning.

1296
01:09:57,367 --> 01:09:58,368
Yeah.

1297
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,458
"Please call, right now."

1298
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:04,112
All caps, exclamation,
angry face, angry face,

1299
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,940
gun emoji.

1300
01:10:06,114 --> 01:10:07,899
Do you think she might be mad?

1301
01:10:09,117 --> 01:10:10,423
You want to finish
getting ready?

1302
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:13,252
The maid comes around ten.

1303
01:10:13,426 --> 01:10:16,951
Ah, guy from the hospital sent
the info on Bridwell's memorial.

1304
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,344
I don't want to see it.

1305
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:20,041
Wait a sec.

1306
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,435
That does not look
like Bridwell.

1307
01:10:22,609 --> 01:10:23,915
It's probably just him when
he was younger.

1308
01:10:24,089 --> 01:10:25,133
Meh.

1309
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:28,920
That's not Bridwell.

1310
01:10:29,094 --> 01:10:31,139
Not Bridwell.
Definitely not Bridwell.

1311
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:34,317
The patient in the hospital
must've got the wrong guy.

1312
01:10:34,491 --> 01:10:36,232
So if that's not Bridwell,
that means...

1313
01:10:36,406 --> 01:10:38,190
Bridwell's alive!

1314
01:10:38,364 --> 01:10:40,453
This guy's dead, which is
tragic, but Bridwell's alive.

1315
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:41,672
- Bridwell is alive!
- Yeah!

1316
01:10:41,846 --> 01:10:43,456
Feels weird high-fiving
the dead!

1317
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:45,153
- There's still hope for Clifford!
- Let's focus on that.

1318
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:46,720
- Yes.
- R.I.P. Hamilton Wilder.

1319
01:10:46,894 --> 01:10:49,027
- Long live Bridwell!
- Yes!

1320
01:10:49,201 --> 01:10:50,985
- Guys!
- Owen, Bridwell's alive!

1321
01:10:52,813 --> 01:10:54,685
Online... I researched...

1322
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:57,340
I found... Bridwell...
the park.

1323
01:10:57,514 --> 01:10:59,733
Okay. Again. With sentences.

1324
01:10:59,907 --> 01:11:02,649
Bridwell is alive,
and his tent is in Manhattan Bridge Park

1325
01:11:02,823 --> 01:11:04,695
at the Freedom Festival.

1326
01:11:04,869 --> 01:11:06,087
Emily!

1327
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,176
Emily! Come quick!

1328
01:11:10,831 --> 01:11:13,878
<i>The giant crimson dog was
stopped earlier this morning</i>

1329
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:16,707
- <i>by the authorities on a freighter.</i>
- Can you believe this?

1330
01:11:16,881 --> 01:11:19,884
- What?
- <i>No one is certain how or why he got aboard,</i>

1331
01:11:20,058 --> 01:11:21,625
<i>but it seems an effort
was being made</i>

1332
01:11:21,799 --> 01:11:23,627
<i>to transport him
out of the country.</i>

1333
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:25,193
<i>The enormous dog
is being returned</i>

1334
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,239
<i>to his home at Lyfegro labs,</i>

1335
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:28,762
<i>the biotech firm
that created him.</i>

1336
01:11:28,936 --> 01:11:31,025
No! No, we have
to help Clifford.

1337
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,811
Uncle Casey, we have to save him.
They'll hurt him!

1338
01:11:37,858 --> 01:11:39,730
Yeah. We do.

1339
01:11:41,209 --> 01:11:42,820
I guess we're paying Lyfegro
a visit.

1340
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:44,778
I'm in. I'll go get the van.

1341
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,433
We're in.

1342
01:11:48,608 --> 01:11:51,785
Looks like Harlem wants
its big red dog back.

1343
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:58,966
- Guess who.
- Let me talk to her.

1344
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,187
- Hi, Mom!
- <i>Emily, what on earth is going on?</i>

1345
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:05,146
- Clifford's in trouble.
- I'm in the taxi on the way from JFK.

1346
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,540
- There's no time to explain.
- Everybody, get in!

1347
01:12:07,714 --> 01:12:09,803
- <i>I am an hour away...</i>
- Mom, I can handle this.

1348
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:12,415
- <i>Handle what? You're twelve years old.</i>
- I got this.

1349
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:15,331
- And besides, Uncle Casey's with me.
- <i>And I am so sorry,</i>

1350
01:12:15,505 --> 01:12:17,376
but, my darling, you... Emily?

1351
01:12:19,509 --> 01:12:20,988
I'm grounded for life,
aren't I?

1352
01:12:21,162 --> 01:12:22,599
You and me both.

1353
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:26,385
It's in Brooklyn Yards,
off Vanderbilt.

1354
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:27,778
Okay, I'll meet you
over there.

1355
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:29,170
Hey!

1356
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,737
Get out of my way.

1357
01:12:30,911 --> 01:12:33,523
They should have left
that dog alone.

1358
01:12:33,697 --> 01:12:35,568
Ooh. Now they're in trouble.

1359
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:39,964
All right, let's start
sequencing its DNA.

1360
01:12:40,138 --> 01:12:41,792
Yeah, okay, sir.

1361
01:12:41,966 --> 01:12:43,489
Hello! How are you?

1362
01:12:43,663 --> 01:12:44,925
Who's a good boy?
It's okay.

1363
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:46,797
Good morning.

1364
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:49,321
I got a speech, but what I have
to say comes from the heart,

1365
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:51,410
and I apologize
if I get emotional.

1366
01:12:51,584 --> 01:12:53,630
We here at Lyfegro,
we've got one mission.

1367
01:12:53,804 --> 01:12:55,545
It's to feed the world.

1368
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:57,068
Hey, Mark, I like your tie.

1369
01:12:59,157 --> 01:13:01,072
We have an illustrious
team of scientists...

1370
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:03,291
Okay.

1371
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:05,381
Whoa! You carry bolt cutters?

1372
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:06,730
Never leave the house
without 'em.

1373
01:13:06,904 --> 01:13:08,166
You live in a truck.

1374
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,254
Zip it, Owen.

1375
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:10,516
And to prove that,

1376
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:13,432
I'm sure you saw
that beautiful,

1377
01:13:13,606 --> 01:13:16,348
magnificent creature
walking by, who...

1378
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:18,959
playfully escaped
from our lab two days ago.

1379
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:20,526
And I tell ya,

1380
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,529
we are very, very thankful
for that big red dog.

1381
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,838
Okay. Now we just need
a diversion.

1382
01:13:28,012 --> 01:13:31,450
- We can handle that. Right, Mr. Jarvis?
- Yes, we can, Mrs. Jarvis.

1383
01:13:31,624 --> 01:13:33,496
We'll head around back.

1384
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,323
We'll go make some
trouble at the press conference.

1385
01:13:35,498 --> 01:13:37,369
You have an opportunity

1386
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:41,808
to make a sizeable return
on Lyfegro's investment.

1387
01:13:41,982 --> 01:13:43,636
- Thank you so much.
- Uh, Mr. Tieran.

1388
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:45,769
- Mr. Tieran!
- Yes.

1389
01:13:45,943 --> 01:13:48,815
Will you please address the lawsuit
that's being filed against you?

1390
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:49,947
Lawsuit? I don't...

1391
01:13:54,168 --> 01:13:56,083
It's locked. Don't worry.
I got a solution.

1392
01:13:56,257 --> 01:13:58,869
- We learned how to pick locks in magic class.
- I bet you did.

1393
01:13:59,043 --> 01:14:02,176
We'll be filing a
class-action lawsuit against Mr. Tieran,

1394
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,656
Lyfegro Research Facilities,

1395
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:05,049
- and any and all...
- Guys, we've got bogies.

1396
01:14:05,223 --> 01:14:07,268
Yeah, I don't speak legalese.

1397
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:10,228
We've already named Emily Elizabeth
Howard as head class representative,

1398
01:14:10,402 --> 01:14:13,927
and we've attached an assault and battery
claim, inclusive of ethical violations.

1399
01:14:14,101 --> 01:14:16,843
- Hey, let me go. Get your hands off her!
- This is unfortunate.

1400
01:14:17,017 --> 01:14:19,193
This is way too focused on me.
Look at that!

1401
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:20,586
What is the matter with you?

1402
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,153
You're gonna set off
the fire alarm!

1403
01:14:22,327 --> 01:14:23,241
There's another one. Just...

1404
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:27,637
- Security inside the building, what's going on?
- Go, go, go.

1405
01:14:27,811 --> 01:14:30,727
- Check all the doors!
- Yes, sir! On it. Doing it now.

1406
01:14:39,213 --> 01:14:41,564
What's going on?

1407
01:14:45,568 --> 01:14:47,352
Ah, look. It's a cute sheep.

1408
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:50,355
Look.

1409
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:54,446
Holy sheep.

1410
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:58,102
- I'm out.
- Step aside. I know sheep.

1411
01:14:58,276 --> 01:15:01,540
Come here, <i>mamachka.</i> Come to mama.
Yeah, come here, come here.

1412
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:18,644
You see? Everybody likes
condensed milk.

1413
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:20,254
Go get it.

1414
01:15:20,428 --> 01:15:23,214
Yes, even the can tastes good,
doesn't it?

1415
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:25,216
Sectors three
through five clear.

1416
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,479
It's a false alarm
at the loading dock.

1417
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:28,654
Copy that.

1418
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:30,177
False alarm
at the loading dock.

1419
01:15:30,351 --> 01:15:32,179
<i>Resetting all systems.</i>

1420
01:15:33,485 --> 01:15:35,226
- Whoa!
- Clifford!

1421
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,184
Sorry, my friends,
we're taking the dog.

1422
01:15:37,358 --> 01:15:39,796
I've got 30,000 volts
that says you're not.

1423
01:15:42,799 --> 01:15:44,931
- I've got a plastic hand.
- But I have a real one.

1424
01:15:47,368 --> 01:15:49,719
No!

1425
01:15:49,893 --> 01:15:52,417
- Oh!
- It's heavy because it's condensed, <i>tovarishch.</i>

1426
01:15:52,591 --> 01:15:53,940
Okay, anyone in a lab coat...

1427
01:15:54,114 --> 01:15:55,246
...take a hike.

1428
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:56,856
Okay.

1429
01:15:58,118 --> 01:15:59,076
Huh.

1430
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:00,381
Clifford!

1431
01:16:01,034 --> 01:16:02,340
Are you okay?

1432
01:16:02,514 --> 01:16:03,863
Clifford.

1433
01:16:12,959 --> 01:16:14,265
Clifford?

1434
01:16:15,135 --> 01:16:16,572
Clifford!

1435
01:16:17,181 --> 01:16:18,312
You're okay!

1436
01:16:20,401 --> 01:16:21,794
Clifford, buddy.

1437
01:16:21,968 --> 01:16:23,187
I know, I know.

1438
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:30,629
Aw!

1439
01:16:30,803 --> 01:16:33,893
- Hey, buddy. I'm happy, too.
- I don't want to break this up

1440
01:16:34,067 --> 01:16:36,330
because it is, like,
the most adorable thing

1441
01:16:36,504 --> 01:16:39,856
I've ever seen, but how are we gonna get
him to Bridwell in Manhattan Bridge Park?

1442
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:42,598
Listen, you guys take off without me.
Maybe I can distract security.

1443
01:16:42,772 --> 01:16:44,774
I am a magician, after all.

1444
01:16:44,948 --> 01:16:47,603
- What?
- We got to get him to the truck.

1445
01:16:47,777 --> 01:16:49,953
Uh, no, no, no,
they'll grab him.

1446
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,391
We're not taking the truck.

1447
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,832
- Hey, stop.
- Turn on the camera.

1448
01:17:00,006 --> 01:17:01,442
Come on, jump!

1449
01:17:02,008 --> 01:17:03,749
Whoa!

1450
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:07,100
Oh, come on! Get my car!

1451
01:17:07,274 --> 01:17:08,275
Let's go!

1452
01:17:13,803 --> 01:17:15,718
Head to the park.
I'll meet you there.

1453
01:17:15,892 --> 01:17:17,197
We need backup, now!

1454
01:17:17,371 --> 01:17:18,721
Go, Clifford!
Come on, boy!

1455
01:17:24,683 --> 01:17:26,163
Hey. What are you doing?

1456
01:17:26,337 --> 01:17:27,947
You like magic?

1457
01:17:28,121 --> 01:17:29,688
- Watch me disappear!
- Hey! Get back!

1458
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:31,559
- We're here at Lyfegro...
- Can I borrow this?

1459
01:17:31,734 --> 01:17:34,214
- Hey!
- That dog was stolen by Lyfegro.

1460
01:17:37,435 --> 01:17:39,176
Oh, no! Look out!

1461
01:17:46,531 --> 01:17:48,576
Come on! Go!

1462
01:17:50,535 --> 01:17:51,928
<i>It looks like the big red dog</i>

1463
01:17:52,102 --> 01:17:53,581
<i>has escaped
the Lyfegro facility</i>

1464
01:17:53,756 --> 01:17:56,106
<i>in the strangest chase
I have ever seen.</i>

1465
01:17:57,411 --> 01:18:00,893
Whoa! Easy!
Come on, come on! Yeah!

1466
01:18:03,113 --> 01:18:04,941
I see red.

1467
01:18:05,115 --> 01:18:06,203
Turn!

1468
01:18:06,377 --> 01:18:07,987
No, no, no, no, no!
Come on!

1469
01:18:08,161 --> 01:18:09,772
Go, go!

1470
01:18:09,946 --> 01:18:11,295
He belongs to my niece, Emily.

1471
01:18:11,469 --> 01:18:13,732
She rescued him
when he was just a tiny puppy.

1472
01:18:14,994 --> 01:18:16,387
If her mom is watching,

1473
01:18:16,561 --> 01:18:18,432
I'd like it on record
that I told her not to.

1474
01:18:18,606 --> 01:18:20,608
- Casey?
- <i>But she didn't listen.</i>

1475
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:22,567
<i>Because she knew,
right from the beginning,</i>

1476
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:24,003
that that dog

1477
01:18:24,177 --> 01:18:25,091
was her dog.

1478
01:18:25,265 --> 01:18:27,180
<i>And now, a big corporation</i>

1479
01:18:27,354 --> 01:18:30,357
<i>is trying to steal a puppy
from a little girl.</i>

1480
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:32,229
Are we gonna do
anything about it?

1481
01:18:32,403 --> 01:18:35,972
And finally, to my ninth-grade
math teacher, Mr. Beamus,

1482
01:18:36,146 --> 01:18:38,452
who told me that I would
never amount to anything,

1483
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:39,845
<i>I would like to point out</i>

1484
01:18:40,019 --> 01:18:42,369
<i>that only one of us
is on TV right now.</i>

1485
01:18:42,543 --> 01:18:45,503
<i>So, Mr. Beamus,
you can kiss my...</i>

1486
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:47,679
Oh, snap.

1487
01:18:47,853 --> 01:18:48,985
<i>Sir, where is that dog going?</i>

1488
01:18:49,159 --> 01:18:50,073
<i>Manhattan Bridge Park.</i>

1489
01:18:50,247 --> 01:18:51,509
Can we go faster?

1490
01:18:51,683 --> 01:18:53,250
- Over here.
- I'm gonna need a ride.

1491
01:18:53,424 --> 01:18:55,600
Look!
That dog right there!

1492
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:57,776
At the end of the tunnel,
the park should be really close.

1493
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,909
- Just step on it.
- I'm stepping! I'm stepping!

1494
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:02,389
- Guys! Emily! She's on TV!
- What?

1495
01:19:02,563 --> 01:19:03,913
Careful!
Two hands on the wheel!

1496
01:19:04,087 --> 01:19:05,349
- Everybody calm down!
- Okay, okay, okay!

1497
01:19:08,134 --> 01:19:09,483
Watch out!

1498
01:19:11,311 --> 01:19:13,357
Sarge,
big red dog heading north!

1499
01:19:18,101 --> 01:19:21,017
- Yes!
- <i>We have police security vehicles</i>

1500
01:19:21,191 --> 01:19:22,322
<i>all chasing after</i>

1501
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:25,586
a young girl riding
a giant red dog.

1502
01:19:36,075 --> 01:19:38,991
They're back!
Come on, boy, faster!

1503
01:19:39,165 --> 01:19:40,993
I mean, this is crazy!

1504
01:19:41,167 --> 01:19:43,474
Doesn't she understand
she can't win? Come on.

1505
01:19:52,048 --> 01:19:53,310
Oh, no!

1506
01:19:54,528 --> 01:19:55,834
Whoa!

1507
01:19:58,532 --> 01:19:59,925
Come on, jump!

1508
01:20:00,099 --> 01:20:01,492
Whoa!

1509
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:02,972
Hey, hey!

1510
01:20:04,321 --> 01:20:06,410
- Oh, perfect.
- Wow.

1511
01:20:10,066 --> 01:20:13,330
- Yes! We made it!
- Look at that dog!

1512
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:14,635
Look at the dog.

1513
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:21,860
Mr. Bridwell!

1514
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:23,819
Mr. Bridwell!

1515
01:20:25,255 --> 01:20:26,734
My goodness!

1516
01:20:26,909 --> 01:20:29,563
Someone's been eating
their spinach.

1517
01:20:29,737 --> 01:20:31,827
You are hot! You need a drink.

1518
01:20:32,001 --> 01:20:34,220
Go over there to that big blue
dunk tank over there.

1519
01:20:34,394 --> 01:20:37,441
- Mr. Bridwell!
- Emily!

1520
01:20:39,312 --> 01:20:41,488
We were looking for you,
and we thought you were dead.

1521
01:20:41,662 --> 01:20:43,969
Well, I hope not.
I just booked a safari.

1522
01:20:44,143 --> 01:20:46,232
But at the hospital,
we saw your bow tie.

1523
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:48,495
Oh, I understand.

1524
01:20:48,669 --> 01:20:50,628
Well, I went there to spend
time with an old friend.

1525
01:20:50,802 --> 01:20:52,717
A very sick old friend.

1526
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:55,111
And he'd always
loved that bow tie,

1527
01:20:55,285 --> 01:20:56,939
so I gave it to him

1528
01:20:57,113 --> 01:20:59,767
so that he could stand out
from the crowd up there.

1529
01:21:02,248 --> 01:21:04,903
Mr. Bridwell, you have to make Clifford
small again or they're gonna hurt him.

1530
01:21:05,077 --> 01:21:08,515
Small? But it was your love
that made him so big.

1531
01:21:08,689 --> 01:21:10,169
Nobody can take that away.

1532
01:21:10,343 --> 01:21:11,649
But will he be okay?

1533
01:21:11,823 --> 01:21:13,912
Your love is all he needs.

1534
01:21:14,086 --> 01:21:15,174
Create a perimeter!

1535
01:21:15,348 --> 01:21:17,916
Do not let that dog
leave this park.

1536
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:19,483
Emily
Elizabeth Howard,

1537
01:21:19,657 --> 01:21:20,701
for your own safety,

1538
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,573
please step away
from the animal.

1539
01:21:22,747 --> 01:21:24,531
- He's dangerous.
- He's just a puppy!

1540
01:21:24,705 --> 01:21:27,447
That creature is the property
of Lyfegro

1541
01:21:27,621 --> 01:21:28,971
and is a threat to our city!

1542
01:21:29,145 --> 01:21:31,190
No, he's not!
He never hurt anyone, I swear.

1543
01:21:31,364 --> 01:21:32,539
Lock him in a cage.

1544
01:21:32,713 --> 01:21:34,324
Whoa, you see that?
He's violent!

1545
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:35,891
No, he's just scared.

1546
01:21:36,065 --> 01:21:38,937
You would be, too.
Please, leave him alone.

1547
01:21:41,374 --> 01:21:42,985
Mr. Bridwell,
you've got to do something.

1548
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:45,596
I can't do this on my own.
They're not listening!

1549
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:48,338
Really?
Well, why have they come?

1550
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:52,733
Back off, back off.

1551
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,779
And you thought you didn't
have any friends, huh?

1552
01:21:54,953 --> 01:21:58,261
All right, ladies
and gentlemen, disperse immediately.

1553
01:21:58,435 --> 01:22:01,177
Let's go, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1554
01:22:02,308 --> 01:22:04,745
See what happens
when people break the rules?

1555
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,704
Emily, if you want them
to listen,

1556
01:22:06,878 --> 01:22:07,923
you'd better speak.

1557
01:22:11,448 --> 01:22:12,666
Hmm?

1558
01:22:13,798 --> 01:22:16,583
- Let's go get that dog.
- No, please, stop!

1559
01:22:17,671 --> 01:22:20,413
No, I have something
I have to say.

1560
01:22:28,334 --> 01:22:30,119
There's a lot
of people here.

1561
01:22:30,293 --> 01:22:32,382
You got this.

1562
01:22:32,556 --> 01:22:35,124
My name is Emily Elizabeth,

1563
01:22:35,298 --> 01:22:37,430
and this is my dog, Clifford.

1564
01:22:37,604 --> 01:22:39,911
I know he's bigger
than most dogs,

1565
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:41,957
but he's also the kindest,

1566
01:22:42,131 --> 01:22:44,002
most loving dog
in the whole wide world.

1567
01:22:44,176 --> 01:22:46,135
He's a freak!

1568
01:22:46,309 --> 01:22:49,921
- It's dangerous!
- No, he's not dangerous! He's just different.

1569
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:51,314
That's all.

1570
01:22:52,402 --> 01:22:53,751
I know how he feels,

1571
01:22:53,925 --> 01:22:56,536
because I know
what it's like to not fit in.

1572
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:59,148
Just because you're different,

1573
01:22:59,322 --> 01:23:02,020
it doesn't mean that it's okay
to be teased or bullied.

1574
01:23:02,194 --> 01:23:05,502
And I'm gonna guess that many
of you know how much that hurts.

1575
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:07,286
Emily Elizabeth!

1576
01:23:08,548 --> 01:23:09,636
Someone once told me

1577
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:11,203
it's the people
who are unique,

1578
01:23:11,377 --> 01:23:13,945
they're the ones
who change the world.

1579
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:17,122
If Clifford was just a regular
dog, we wouldn't all be here.

1580
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:19,516
We've got to stand up for him!

1581
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:22,040
- Emily's right!
- Yeah, that's right!

1582
01:23:22,214 --> 01:23:23,433
That dog saved my life!

1583
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:25,565
He doesn't hurt anyone.

1584
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:27,785
He just...
He loves.

1585
01:23:27,959 --> 01:23:29,656
Yeah!

1586
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:33,617
And if we can
love each other like this,

1587
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:37,229
none of us would have to feel
small and all alone again.

1588
01:23:37,403 --> 01:23:39,753
Right, Clifford?

1589
01:23:39,927 --> 01:23:41,364
It's not right
to take him away

1590
01:23:41,538 --> 01:23:43,061
just because he's big and red.

1591
01:23:43,235 --> 01:23:46,021
So, please.
Please let me keep my dog.

1592
01:23:47,935 --> 01:23:49,633
Who's with me?

1593
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:01,384
Oh! Oh!

1594
01:24:01,558 --> 01:24:02,950
Bravo!

1595
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:06,563
Bravo! Bravo!

1596
01:24:07,564 --> 01:24:10,610
That was so inspiring, Emily.

1597
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:12,743
I've got chills.

1598
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:14,223
Oh, my goodness.

1599
01:24:14,397 --> 01:24:16,268
Man, I hate to ruin
this beautiful moment,

1600
01:24:16,442 --> 01:24:17,878
but I've got to reclaim
my property.

1601
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,533
Because we all know this dog
you call Clifford

1602
01:24:20,707 --> 01:24:22,579
- belongs to...
- Lyfegro.

1603
01:24:22,753 --> 01:24:24,537
No, he doesn't.

1604
01:24:24,711 --> 01:24:27,105
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
Please do not take my word for it.

1605
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:30,630
You see, he was microchipped
at birth.

1606
01:24:30,804 --> 01:24:32,545
Yeah.

1607
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:37,289
Officer, could you
please do the honors?

1608
01:24:37,463 --> 01:24:39,683
- Go home!
- He converted her property!

1609
01:24:39,857 --> 01:24:41,989
- It's in his left neck.
- That's right, left neck.

1610
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:43,687
Oh, my gosh, this is glorious.

1611
01:24:44,601 --> 01:24:46,168
Excuse me, young lady.

1612
01:24:48,257 --> 01:24:49,475
Isn't this fun?

1613
01:24:58,005 --> 01:24:59,964
- This dog belongs to...
- Yeah.

1614
01:25:06,275 --> 01:25:07,885
...Emily Elizabeth Howard.

1615
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:13,151
What? That's impossible.

1616
01:25:16,154 --> 01:25:18,287
- Good for you, Emily!
- That's bonkers!

1617
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:21,768
This is a mistake. Nah-ah. It's a mistake!
It's got to be a mistake.

1618
01:25:21,942 --> 01:25:24,902
We need to have a talk about
the bill the city will be sending you.

1619
01:25:25,076 --> 01:25:26,730
Please escort this gentleman
to my vehicle.

1620
01:25:26,904 --> 01:25:28,123
Get your hands off me.

1621
01:25:28,297 --> 01:25:29,385
Come on.
Colette, where's my attorney?

1622
01:25:30,212 --> 01:25:32,170
- I quit.
- What? Colette!

1623
01:25:32,344 --> 01:25:33,476
I'll never leave you, sir.

1624
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:34,738
I don't care about you.
Colette!

1625
01:25:34,912 --> 01:25:35,826
- Ouch.
- Colette, come back here.

1626
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,221
Isn't technology amazing?

1627
01:25:39,395 --> 01:25:41,048
People say
it's quite like magic.

1628
01:25:41,223 --> 01:25:43,268
So, if you'll excuse me,

1629
01:25:43,442 --> 01:25:45,140
I have some other people
I need to help.

1630
01:25:45,314 --> 01:25:47,403
After all, you're not
the only person in the world

1631
01:25:47,577 --> 01:25:50,188
who isn't looking for a pet.

1632
01:25:55,802 --> 01:25:57,326
Officers!

1633
01:25:58,196 --> 01:26:00,807
Stand down!

1634
01:26:00,981 --> 01:26:02,548
Make way!

1635
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:04,550
- Come here, Clifford!
- Way to go!

1636
01:26:05,899 --> 01:26:07,423
Come, come.

1637
01:26:07,597 --> 01:26:09,033
- Hey, girl.
- Mom!

1638
01:26:12,384 --> 01:26:14,343
My bold and brave little girl.

1639
01:26:14,517 --> 01:26:15,822
Just like you taught me.

1640
01:26:15,996 --> 01:26:17,955
Oh, by the way, Mom...
we got a dog.

1641
01:26:18,129 --> 01:26:20,044
Yeah, I noticed.

1642
01:26:20,218 --> 01:26:22,438
As for you,
I have no words to...

1643
01:26:22,612 --> 01:26:23,613
"I love you. I forgive you.

1644
01:26:23,787 --> 01:26:25,005
You are
the responsible brother

1645
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,833
that I always dreamed
of having."

1646
01:26:27,007 --> 01:26:28,661
Okay, we'll go with that
for now.

1647
01:26:30,054 --> 01:26:32,709
Well, you did it, Em.

1648
01:26:32,883 --> 01:26:35,015
You saved him,
just like you said you would.

1649
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,888
Well, I couldn't have done it without
my mature and super-dependable uncle.

1650
01:26:38,062 --> 01:26:39,933
You have another uncle?

1651
01:26:40,107 --> 01:26:42,632
You know how you said
no one believes in you?

1652
01:26:42,806 --> 01:26:43,981
I believe in you.

1653
01:26:44,155 --> 01:26:46,201
You just need to believe
in yourself.

1654
01:26:48,594 --> 01:26:51,467
- How do you know so much stuff for a fourth grader?
- Sixth.

1655
01:26:51,641 --> 01:26:53,164
I was doing air quotes
behind your back.

1656
01:26:54,034 --> 01:26:55,210
Okay.

1657
01:26:57,516 --> 01:26:59,344
We love you, too, Clifford.

1658
01:26:59,518 --> 01:27:00,606
Guys!

1659
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,086
Let's take a picture
of Clifford.

1660
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,392
A group photo.

1661
01:27:03,566 --> 01:27:05,350
Everybody scooch in.
Get in, get in.

1662
01:27:05,524 --> 01:27:08,440
Uh, Casey, you know what?
Casey, just get on the dog.

1663
01:27:08,614 --> 01:27:11,095
- No. No!
- Yeah, yeah, that'd be neat.

1664
01:27:11,269 --> 01:27:14,011
- Get on the dog, it's fun!
- I'm not getting on the dog.

1665
01:27:14,185 --> 01:27:16,056
If you don't get on the dog,
I'll tell Mom about...

1666
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,362
Okay, let's get on the dog.

1667
01:27:19,146 --> 01:27:21,236
- There he goes.
- Yeah, get up there.

1668
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:22,367
Come on, Casey.

1669
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:23,542
Get up there.

1670
01:27:26,023 --> 01:27:27,633
There you go.

1671
01:27:27,807 --> 01:27:30,245
All right.
That's perfect. Perfect.

1672
01:27:30,419 --> 01:27:31,594
Oh, no.

1673
01:27:33,204 --> 01:27:36,076
- Clifford. No fetch.
- Oh, no.

1674
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,035
- No fetch!
- No.

1675
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:42,082
Clifford!

1676
01:27:56,662 --> 01:27:58,229
<i>And so the pure,</i>

1677
01:27:58,403 --> 01:28:01,754
<i>simple love
between a girl and her dog</i>

1678
01:28:01,928 --> 01:28:04,104
<i>changed everything.</i>

1679
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:06,890
<i>Emily and her mother
were welcomed home,</i>

1680
01:28:07,064 --> 01:28:12,635
<i>and Packard even acquired
a uniquely helpful assistant.</i>

1681
01:28:12,809 --> 01:28:14,811
<i>Other people matured.</i>

1682
01:28:14,985 --> 01:28:18,423
<i>And by "other people",
I mean Uncle Casey,</i>

1683
01:28:18,597 --> 01:28:20,947
<i>who finally
moved out of his van</i>

1684
01:28:21,121 --> 01:28:23,254
<i>and got a proper job.</i>

1685
01:28:23,428 --> 01:28:28,085
<i>And so, a story that began
with two lost souls</i>

1686
01:28:28,259 --> 01:28:32,307
<i>ends with one big family:</i>

1687
01:28:37,137 --> 01:28:40,619
<i>A little girl,
a giant red dog,</i>

1688
01:28:40,793 --> 01:28:45,711
<i>and a city that came together
because of them.</i>
