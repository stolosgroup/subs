Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
Find out @ saveanilluminati.com

2
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,160
-Congressman.
-General.

3
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,720
Herzlich Willkommen in Berlin.

4
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,480
Who is that guy?

5
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,720
lt's Breimer. He's a congressman.

6
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,680
-You're here for the peace conference?
-here to write about it.

7
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,320
-You ever hear of The New Republic?
-No.

8
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,080
The uniform is the Army's idea of a joke.

9
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,040
You see any action?

10
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,480
l was in London when Franz Bettmann
aimed one of his Roman candles...

11
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,120
...about a hundred feet away from me.
Broke all my martini glasses.

12
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,520
Who is Franz Bettmann?

13
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,920
Bettmann, Von Braun.

14
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,920
The Kraut brain trust,the guys who built the V-2s.

15
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,080
l actually wrote a column about it.

16
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,080
l wish l could write.

17
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,880
l have some great stories l could tell.

18
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,120
No sense beating up on the Germans.
The Russians are the enemy now.

19
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,560
They're godless people. 
Go down to the railyard and see for yourself.

20
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,120
Anything's not nailed down, they're taking it, sending it to Moscow.

21
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,440
Well, why not? They took most of the bullets.

22
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,560
We've been teaching the lvans to play
ball. Some of those fellas can really hit.

23
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,960
l bet you can't wait
to go home, huh, soldier?

24
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,080
oh Yes, sir. You know the Germans.
They make excellent Danish pastry...

25
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,600
...but they can't bake apple pie like my mom.

26
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,080
Nothing wrong with the Germans.

27
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,720
Plenty of good German folk back in Schenectady.

28
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,920
Oh, excuse me. 
Let me help you with that, sir.

29
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,800
l got it, Tully.

30
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
-Being helpful is all. 
-You know who's driving me tomorrow?

31
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,840
Got my trip ticket. l'm your driver
for the duration of your stay in Berlin.

32
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,760
And l got you...

33
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,360
...a little housewarming present.

34
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,120
Thanks, Tully.

35
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,800
-See you in the morning. Say, 0800?
-0800.

36
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,280
I wouldn't myself have sized him up that way, you know? 
Just meeting the guy...

37
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,160
...you wouldn't think of him as a patsy.
That's what I loved about Berlin:

38
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,280
Even a guy who wasn't a patsy back
home turned into one. It was inevitable.

39
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,360
The city spread its legs.

40
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,640
All that ''eat, drink and be merry'' bullshit, ''seize the day. ''

41
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,760
It sure didn't make anyone smarter.

42
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,080
And the best part of it was no one got hurt.

43
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,760
There was too much money around for anybody to fall...

44
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,640
...without a nice soft cushion.

45
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,800
Occupation marks printed just for us.Funny money.

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,800
It didn't feel like losing it when they lost it.

47
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,640
The Russians, they had to spend it before they went home.

48
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,120
Which was all anyone talked about: Going home.

49
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,080
Everyone, even the Russians. 
God, who would ever want to?

50
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,040
Say what you want about the war.

51
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,080
I would never wish
for all those millions of people to die...

52
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,120
...but the war was the best thing that ever happened to me.

53
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,400
When you have money, then, for the first time in your life...

54
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,680
...you understand it,what money does for you.

55
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,040
Where before all you understood was not having it.

56
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,320
Money allows you
to be who you truly are.

57
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,280
So you like your job?

58
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,080
What?

59
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,640
Your job.

60
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,840
Sure.

61
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,080
Yeah?

62
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,880
What are you doing with that cigarette?

63
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,720
Waste not, want not.

64
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,880
lt is a job, right?

65
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,880
How do you like your job?

66
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,880
How do you like working in the motor pool?

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,520
What the hell does that mean?

68
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,480
-Nothing.
-That doesn't even follow.

69
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,280
Perhaps my English.

70
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,920
Like you should be fucking Dwight
Eisenhower, Countess Roundheels?

71
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,320
-l was making conversation.
-No, you weren't.

72
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,000
That's what l was doing. Don't tell me my business.

73
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,720
Two thousand yards of silk in the Russian zone.

74
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,520
l get in and out anywhere.The British zone, the French.

75
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,000
l got the vehicle. The motor pool's the best job in the fucking Army!

76
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,080
l'm sorry.

77
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,040
l thought you were going to help me get out of Germany.

78
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,000
lt's gonna get harder,not easier. Watch.

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,920
They put your name on a list,and then that's it.

80
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,040
l forget sometimes what a boy you are.

81
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,360
Such a boy.

82
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,160
-A sweet little boy.
-No, cut it out.

83
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,160
Does that bother you?

84
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,120
Why should it?

85
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,440
My husband was a boy too.

86
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,600
A little boy who saw numbers in his head.

87
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,320
l'm your fellow, okay?

88
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,080
l'll get you out of here.

89
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,120
You watch.

90
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,480
My girl, she's not just a pretty face, no, sir.

91
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,720
She won first prize last year with her rhubarb pie, 
and second with her gourds.

92
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,160
-That's terrific, Tully.
-Oh, she's pretty terrific, sir.

93
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,680
Any luck, l'll be home for the harvest dance.

94
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,480
Well, at this rate we'll still be driving to Potsdam.

95
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,840
Somebody got up on the wrong side of the bed.

96
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,080
-Some son of a bitch stole my wallet.
-No kidding.

97
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,840
lt must have been in that crowd at the airport.

98
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,840
l can loan you money if you need it.

99
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,080
Thanks, Tully.

100
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,320
Don't want you to miss all the great things Berlin has to offer.

101
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,840
l used to live here before the war.

102
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,280
-Really? 
-Ran the AP bureau.

103
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,600
They're not really gonna put the country on trial, are they?

104
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,480
Do you think they shouldn't?

105
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,760
Doesn't seem American to lock a person up...

106
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,800
...for something they didn't have anything to do with.

107
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,160
Somebody you know, Tully?

108
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,160
l'm just saying.

109
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,920
Well, there's a piece that would sell:
''Fallen Women of the Third Reich.''

110
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,360
That's pretty raw, sir.

111
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,120
Millions of people didn't disappear
because the elves came out at night.

112
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,960
Your Fraulein knew exactly
what Hitler was doing. They all knew.

113
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,120
-Did she lift a finger?
-You don't know a thing about her.

114
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,680
And you do?

115
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,000
Just because you're a German doesn't make you a Nazi.

116
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,040
You heard Breimer.lt's on to the Russians.

117
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,120
The next war.

118
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,160
They'll leave your girlfriend alone unless 
there's some special reason not to.

119
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,600
lt's gonna cost me
to get her out of Germany...

120
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,120
...l can tell you that right now.

121
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,480
l wish l could help you out, kid.

122
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,920
You want an hour with her?

123
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,680
Beautiful day, huh?

124
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,880
Are you looking for an argument?

125
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,680
l'm sorry l broke your tooth.
lt was an honest disagreement.

126
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,080
What do you need?

127
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,240
Papers.To get someone out of Germany.

128
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,840
-A Nazi?
-Not a Nazi. A friend of mine.

129
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,360
With what l've been through, you'd 
ask me to help a Nazi escape Germany?

130
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Hey, cry me a river.

131
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,320
Fuck, everyone in this town's got a hard-luck story.

132
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,480
You gonna help me or not?

133
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,480
l'll see what l can do.

134
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,200
Great. Just don't Jew me on the price.

135
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
Lena?

136
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,000
-Where's Emil Brandt?|-Who?

137
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,560
-Emil Brandt.
-Who the fuck is Emil Brandt?

138
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,000
-Where's Emil Brandt?
-Fuck you!

139
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,280
Fuck!

140
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,040
Who's Emil Brandt?

141
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,280
-Emil?
-Who is he?

142
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,480
They were looking for him in your place, Lena. Where is he?

143
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,480
-He's dead.
-Don't lie to me!

144
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,480
He died.

145
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,160
He died in the war.

146
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,120
Like you fucking know! Who is he?

147
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,640
He was my husband.

148
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,040
Lena?

149
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,800
-Emil Brandt. That's your husband?
-Yes.

150
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,800
l'm Lena Brandt.

151
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,440
-A last name. What a cozy feeling.|-Tully--

152
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,560
He must have done something
if they're hopped up to find him.

153
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,760
l'm gonna find out sooner or later!

154
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,720
He was a mathematician.

155
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,320
He saw numbers in his head?
lt's bullshit! They broke my fucking arm!

156
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,960
He was a nobody.

157
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
-Somebody's secretary.
-Whose secretary?

158
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,200
What does it matter who?

159
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,800
My husband brought him his coffee
and took steno.

160
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,720
When's the last time you saw him?

161
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,680
Three-- Three years ago.

162
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,560
l'm with you now, Tully.

163
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,480
How am l supposed to help you, Lena,
if you won't help me?

164
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,040
l would never hurt you, Tully.

165
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,920
Never.

166
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,720
You can get anything
on the black market.

167
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,960
l talked to someone.
A little lop-cock, no legs...

168
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,800
...but he can run down anything.

169
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,120
He can get you on a train out.
That's what you want, right?

170
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,800
They told me he was dead.

171
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,280
One more dead, or not dead.

172
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,120
Who would know?

173
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,960
Poor, fucking stupid Lena.

174
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,320
You don't know fucking nothing,do you?

175
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,000
Hey, Sikorsky.

176
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,720
What happened to your arm?

177
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,640
Scotch from Scotland. Forty cases.

178
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,120
Good?

179
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,040
They flew it in for Churchill.

180
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,120
Can't afford it.

181
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,640
Hey, who's your comrade?
Don't worry, l'll give you a price.

182
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,680
l got something else for you.

183
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,960
Really? What's that?

184
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,400
Emil Brandt.

185
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,480
Remind me who that is.

186
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,240
You should know.
You've been looking for him.

187
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,760
Have l?

188
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,080
Names, names, so many names.

189
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,080
Maybe l should just turn him over 
to the Americans.

190
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,400
Why don't you?

191
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,000
Because when everyone else|pulls up their tents...

192
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,320
...you lvans will be the only game in Berlin, and the fact is...

193
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,280
-...l like it here.
-That's it?

194
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,960
A favor?

195
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,760
Two hundred thousand marks.

196
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,320
lt's not like l'm asking for real money.
Have the printing press work overtime.

197
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Plus papers, so l can get my girlfriend
on a train out of here.

198
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,320
The trouble is, Tully...

199
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,480
...l have seen Emil Brandt's
death certificate with my own eyes.

200
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,760
l thought you weren't looking for him.

201
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,000
Now, let me do you a favor.

202
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,160
You remind me of my son, a little bit
of a buffoon, but good-natured.

203
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,160
Get out. Now. Before you get hurt.

204
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,160
Suit yourself.

205
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,000
l just gotta figure out how to get my girlfriend on that train.

206
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,560
What's your girlfriend's name?

207
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,360
Mrs. Emil Brandt.

208
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,280
lmagine her surprise when he turned up like that.

209
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,800
And mine too.

210
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,000
Hey, Tully.

211
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,120
l'll take your offer.

212
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,600
Two hundred thousand marks.

213
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,480
A lot to arrange, getting him out of the American zone. You follow?

214
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,800
Come back in two hours.l'll advance you half.

215
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,160
And bring Mrs. Brandt.

216
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,160
l'm not going with you to the Russian zone.

217
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,960
Lena, half up front,1 00,000 marks.

218
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Have you checked
the exchange rate lately?

219
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,760
What happens when they find out
you don't have Emil?

220
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What happens is, we're in London
with 1 0,000 fucking dollars.

221
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,400
You're out, l'm out.
lt's a perfect plan.

222
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,520
l won't go to the Russian zone.l won't.

223
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,960
He just wants to see you. What's the big deal? 
He wants to know l have him.

224
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,040
-But you don't have him.
-You're out selling love you don't have.

225
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,920
Hey, fish.

226
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,760
l had to hitch a ride from the conference. What happened?

227
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,080
Blow.

228
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,800
l hate to pull rank on you,but you are my fucking driver.

229
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,160
l'm off the clock, sir.

230
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,000
Lena?

231
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,920
l'm off the clock too.

232
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,920
l'll pick you up in the morning.
l'm in the middle of something.

233
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,560
-We know each other.
-l'm in the middle of something.

234
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,360
-What happened to you?
-l need a minute to think, Tully.

235
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,160
You can think on the way.

236
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,160
-Hey, don't push her around like that.
-Fuck you!

237
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,280
Move!

238
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,240
Get in.

239
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,600
Hey!

240
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,160
-Tully, stop.
-Shut up!

241
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,480
Stupid fuck!

242
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,040
They gave me a choice:London or Berlin.

243
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,080
For me there was no choice.

244
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,800
The minute it came over the wire
that the war in Europe was finally over...

245
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,440
...all I thought of was Lena.

246
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,720
I didn't expect to run into her.|Not that way.

247
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,080
Not my first week in town.

248
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,040
But that was just like Lena.

249
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,120
She always kept me off balance.

250
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,680
Tully wouldn't be a problem,or not anything I couldn't figure out.

251
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,720
I just had to find her again.

252
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,480
I knew the bartender would help.

253
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,120
Tell a bartender you're looking for
a friend, and you have two friends:

254
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,880
Him, and the girl he steers you to.

255
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,120
-What the hell is she doing with him?
-Who?

256
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,840
-Lena.|-Tully?

257
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,520
He's not a bad sort.|Just a bit of a cunt.

258
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,360
Yesterday he tried to pimp her to me.

259
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,640
Well, she and her friend Hannelore
come around and cheer up the Gls.

260
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,040
We're all trying to get by.

261
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,040
This whole goddamn country,she winds up fucking my fucking driver.

262
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,320
Oh, you knew her?

263
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,360
l hired her as a stringer.

264
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,920
Her husband was never home.There were no kids.

265
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,160
She got tired of rattling around the house all day.

266
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,560
She was good at it too.

267
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,560
She could get people to do things,
and they didn't know how she did it.

268
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,920
-You were screwing your secretary.
-Stringer.

269
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,320
Sorry.

270
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,160
What the hell does it mean
she's with him, anyway?

271
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,960
She seems to have made
quite an impression on you.

272
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,000
l just didn't expect
l'd find her like this.

273
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,880
l didn't expect l'd find her.

274
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,040
When you say to yourself,
''That's the worst thing l've ever heard'' ...

275
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,160
...stick around.
That's Berlin. Now it is.

276
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,760
There's always something worse.

277
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,600
-Geismer. G-E-l-S-M-E-R. Geismer.
-Yes, yes, l understand.

278
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,000
l'm sorry, The New Republic
is not credentialed for today's schedule.

279
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,040
-We can't have you without a press card.
-l told you my wallet was stolen.

280
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,880
l have a line of people behind you.

281
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,040
You should speak to General Sikorsky.
He's in charge of security.

282
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,520
Where's Charlie Ross?

283
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,080
l played poker with him in St. Louis.
lf l could just talk to Charlie Ross.

284
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,240
Oh, fuck a duck.

285
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,800
General, over here, please.

286
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,480
Welcome.

287
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,640
Wonderful, wonderful.

288
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,520
Congratulations.

289
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
General.

290
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,280
General, l'm with the office
of the military governor.

291
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,880
l'll be escorting the captain
back to the American zone.

292
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,400
Were you with Corporal Tully
last night?

293
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,640
l was in a club up till dawn|drinking with the bartender...

294
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,600
...if your girl Friday
had bothered to check.

295
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,880
Checkpoint recorded Jacob Geismer
crossing into the Russian zone...

296
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,120
...just after midnight.

297
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,120
-Fucking Tully.|-What's that?

298
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,160
My wallet was stolen at the airport.

299
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,080
-Did you report it?
-lt's not exactly a war crime.

300
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,880
Where did you get those bruises?

301
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,760
l got in a fight with Tully.

302
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,360
-Over...?
-He rode the brake.

303
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,600
Wasn't over a girl, was it?

304
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,120
He was supposed to pick me up.
He didn't show. l got pissy about it.

305
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,280
The Russians want this to go away.

306
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,960
An American serviceman turns up dead|in Potsdam...

307
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,360
...on the eve of the peace conference?

308
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,880
lt's pretty damn embarrassing.

309
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,800
Good news for you, frankly.

310
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,880
We want it to go away too.

311
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,200
Well, maybe l should talk directly
to the MG.

312
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,080
He won't wanna bother with this.

313
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,200
He doesn't wanna know
what Tully was doing in Potsdam?

314
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,960
We're doing a hell of a job in Berlin.

315
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,120
ls there a black market? Sure there is.

316
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,920
Are some of our boys involved in it?
Yes, they are.

317
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,440
-lf the Russians killed Tully--
-Then he deserved whatever he got.

318
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,320
And his poor family
doesn't need to know anything more...

319
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,800
...than that he crashed his jeep
trying to avoid a bunny rabbit.

320
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,800
We're not gonna start World War lll
over some dumb Gl...

321
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,520
...who got his dick stuck
in a pitchpot.

322
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,640
You stay out of the Russian sector
for the rest of your time here.

323
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,120
Now, we can't protect you over there.

324
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,280
Thanks.

325
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,480
And if you find that girl...

326
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,440
...we'd like to talk to her.

327
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,800
Kids. Two months ago,they were shooting at us.

328
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,040
lf it isn't Jake Geismer.
Who did you insult this time?

329
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,280
-You got a second? l'll tell you.
-Yeah, why don't we catch up?

330
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,240
-How's 1 946?
-You mean you're not interested?

331
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,040
l know you, Jake. We're a long way
from South Street.

332
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,120
That's funny. l haven't met a DA yet
that could resist a murder.

333
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,040
Nothing better for a prosecutor
than a criminal with a sense of history.

334
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Everything got written down.
Who they killed and what it cost.

335
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,120
Meticulous record keepers.

336
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,160
--forces from the west are poised
to strike the final blows upon Japan.

337
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,080
This military power is sustained
and inspired by the determination...

338
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,280
...of all the Allied nations
to prosecute the war against Japan...

339
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,600
-...until she ceases to exist.
-lt looks like you're putting...

340
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,080
-...the whole country on trial.
-These are just the active cases.

341
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,880
The rest are kept under
lock and key at Kransberg.

342
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,920
They want me to decide
who the ardent Nazis were.

343
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,960
Truth is, it was the whole country.
Nobody's hands are clean.

344
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,920
Twenty-hour days
just to get my arms around it.

345
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,640
So, what's the murder
you wanted to tell me about?

346
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,360
What, Gunther?
He used to be a cop here in Berlin.

347
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,320
Don't worry, he doesn't
speak a word of English.

348
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,120
My driver, a kid named Tully,
turned up dead in Potsdam.

349
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,240
Potsdam? Potsdam's closed
for the conference.

350
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,120
Whoever wanted him dead
had access to the delegations.

351
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,920
-That's somebody high up.
-Why haven't l heard about it?

352
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,040
Muller didn't want you to.
He ordered me to leave it alone.

353
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,640
Nobody around here's
acting like the war is over.

354
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,320
Not the Russians. Not the MG.

355
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,960
-What's your angle?
-Why should l have an angle?

356
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,560
lt just doesn't sound like you.

357
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,360
You came home, all you talked about
was what a great lay your secretary was.

358
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,880
-Stringer.
-Stringer. Sorry.

359
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,440
A bullet through the chest, in the river.
lt's like it never happened.

360
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,040
lsn't that what we fought a war about?
Even a louse like Tully?

361
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,680
Okay.

362
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,680
Okay.

363
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,800
What?

364
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,000
The Russians will have to do
a police report. Can you get me a copy?

365
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,000
This guy drove one of the gas vans.

366
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,840
They would load the Jews in back,
run the exhaust inside.

367
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,120
By the time they got where they were
going, they were dead. Very efficient.

368
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,720
Driving to work he killed more people
than Al Capone in all his years.

369
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,040
But if you asked him,
he isn't a murderer, he's a truck driver.

370
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,360
And he still thinks that.

371
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,480
Thanks, Bernie. l owe you one.

372
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,560
Thank you, Danny.

373
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,160
l can't be out after curfew.
Would you walk with me?

374
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,400
You live here with someone?

375
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,440
Big man.

376
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,040
You want two girls?

377
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
You know a girl named Lena?

378
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Who told you about Lena?

379
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,760
l'm not trying to get something
for nothing.

380
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,880
Aren't you going to offer me
a cigarette?

381
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,000
l didn't see her at the club.

382
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,880
Skinny Lena.

383
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,920
A big Yank in the saddle,
you'd break her in two.

384
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,640
Can l look in your bedroom?

385
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,680
Come. Fuck me, Dutch.

386
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,040
The princess,
who knows where she is?

387
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Lena was raped by the Russians.

388
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,920
You'll get yourself a good dose.

389
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,720
l apologize if l hurt your feelings.

390
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,000
She's not so special.

391
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,560
They raped everyone:
cripples, children.

392
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,720
How did you find this place?

393
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,760
Five hundred just to talk.

394
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,360
That's what l call a real pervert.

395
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,600
Take a couple hours off, would you?

396
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,840
l have nothing to be ashamed of.

397
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,800
-l didn't say you did.
-The war, it's convenient.

398
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,200
We can all blame everything
on the war.

399
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,840
lsn't that why you left?

400
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,320
The war?

401
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,000
l found that blue dress l bought you.

402
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,800
All the old things. All the old times.

403
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
This is my life now.

404
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
Tully at least understood that.

405
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,520
What was Tully doing
in Potsdam last night?

406
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,320
-l don't know.
-You weren't with him?

407
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,680
Potsdam is in the Russian zone.
l don't go to the Russian zone.

408
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,840
Lena, if l can find you, so can they.

409
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,800
As if l'm the only one|who needed help.

410
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,360
-Look at you.
-What is it you're not telling me?

411
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,040
lt couldn't be that l loved him?

412
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,040
You don't need
to be afraid of him anymore.

413
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,120
You don't need
to protect him anymore.

414
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,480
l think if you hadn't left, Jacob...

415
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,520
...nothing would be any different.

416
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,520
Nothing.

417
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,720
lf.

418
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,600
lf you want to stay, it's 500 marks.

419
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,160
Make up your mind.

420
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,320
l'm going to sleep.

421
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,520
Did you get the report?

422
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,120
l had to get it from a friend of mine.
Even Muller hasn't seen that yet.

423
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,120
-lnteresting reading?
-They found 50,000 marks on him.

424
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,960
So figuring they stole half, 1 00?

425
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,600
They found a slug lodged
in his backpack, .32 caliber.

426
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,320
Our guns are .45.

427
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,000
Thanks.

428
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,760
Now, listen,
l'm the first to recognize...

429
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,960
...there were excesses
in the Nazi leadership.

430
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,760
But if we besmirch an entire people
because of a few bad apples...

431
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,560
...we're no better than Hitler.

432
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,440
Then it's not about war crimes at all.

433
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,400
lt's about revenge.

434
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,960
Revenge. Right. Got it.

435
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,280
Exactly. Revenge.

436
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,160
l found that in the dirt
where Tully's body washed up.

437
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,160
The little dash that you'll sometimes find
near the serial number? lt's not there.

438
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,120
-That's meaningful?
-lt means Tully had something to sell.

439
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Something that our side
badly wanted...

440
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,760
...and you very badly
didn't want us to have.

441
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You solved it
the way Russians know how to:

442
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,120
You put a bullet in him. ln Potsdam.
Where he thought he'd be safe.

443
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,320
All that from a mark of punctuation.

444
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,800
No dash means that it's American.

445
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,120
You could check it against the money
you stole from him...

446
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,400
...if you felt like it.

447
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,000
l was expecting Tully that night.

448
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,040
Here. Not in Potsdam.

449
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,160
He never showed up.

450
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,040
lnstead of the usual Scotch
and cameras, he was selling...

451
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,480
...for the price of 200,000 marks,a man...

452
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,160
...named Emil Brandt.

453
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,040
What's so interesting
about Emil Brandt?

454
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,240
The Americans were looking for him.

455
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,920
That made me curious.

456
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,280
We pack up entire factories
and ship them back to Moscow.

457
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,640
Now the peace conference...

458
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,040
...Poland, Romania,half of Europe, a windfall.

459
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,200
Something for the sacrifice and suffering.

460
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,680
Now ask yourself:

461
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,920
What do the Americans get?

462
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,320
Sounds to me like we're getting a good fleecing.

463
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,880
You may not be as safe
on the American side as you think.

464
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,160
Hannelore, Lena.

465
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,720
Even radar couldn't find you here.

466
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,320
Of course, you won't be earning...

467
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,080
...but Jacob here volunteered
to carry you girls on the cuff...

468
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,120
...till things have settled down.

469
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,920
l'll check in on you when l can.

470
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,480
As long as it's on the cuff
and not on my back.

471
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,960
He gives me the creeps.

472
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,160
Fixing your mouth,
with where it's going, sweetheart?

473
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,720
Let's give them a minute.

474
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,960
l don't want you to go out anymore.

475
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,800
lt's a good thing l wasn't there,
don't you think?

476
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,400
-l went for a loaf of bread.
-l can bring you anything you need.

477
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,640
Stare at the same four walls.

478
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,520
l'd go mad.

479
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,560
You wanna tell me why Emil would be
worth 1 00,000 marks to someone?

480
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,160
There'd be no reason.

481
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,360
That's how much money
they found on Tully's body.

482
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,400
That doesn't make any sense.

483
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,720
Might have been nice to know,
Mrs. Brandt...

484
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,400
...that Tully was auctioning off
your husband.

485
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,440
We never talked
about Emil, remember?

486
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,960
One of our rules.

487
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,040
An affair has more rules
than marriage.

488
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,680
The Americans are looking for him,
and the Russians. Why?

489
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,040
-l don't know.|-Where is he, Lena? Where's Emil?

490
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,600
Emil's dead. He died six months ago
in the bombing.

491
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,240
Tully found out the Americans
were looking for Emil...

492
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,960
...so he offered him to the Russians.
One of his schemes. Stupid.

493
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,760
A way to get money to get me
out of Germany. Sell them a dead man.

494
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,200
Now he's dead too. Maybe you next,
if you don't watch yourself.

495
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,600
This isn't gonna go away
because Tully's dead.

496
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,840
-That's all l know.
-Emil was with the SS?

497
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,720
Two years ago they all got uniforms.

498
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,400
-Who knows why?
-Stop lying to me.

499
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,960
l'm a Nazi myself, did you know that?
lt's true.

500
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,440
-You're not a Nazi.
-No, not a Nazi. None of us.

501
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,880
Just something to join,
like a sport club.

502
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,040
How could you fuck someone
for all those years and not know them?

503
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,440
-Stop it.
-Did you ever fuck a Nazi?

504
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,120
-Cut it out.
-How about a Jew?

505
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,520
-Why won't you let me help you?
-A Nazi and a Jew both, better yet.

506
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,200
-You did nothing wrong!
-l survived.

507
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,920
What happened
to the rest of your family?

508
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,320
They got sent to the camps.

509
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,760
Everyone. My mother, uncles, cousins.

510
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,200
Everyone dead.

511
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,480
As the wife of an SS man...

512
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,280
...l was exempt.

513
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,600
''A Jewess is not a Jew,''
that's the way they used to put it.

514
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,760
lt's not something
l have ever told anyone.

515
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,320
And at the end...

516
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,680
...no one was exempt.

517
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,160
Hannelore told me
that you were raped by a Russian?

518
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,800
Hannelore can't tell a joke.

519
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,560
-l didn't realize it was funny.
-Hannelore's funny.

520
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,560
-She always leaves something out.
-Why?

521
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,160
What did she leave out?

522
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,360
And then l met Tully.

523
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,560
God in heaven, l never thought
l'd eat real ham again.

524
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,880
Aren't you gonna have any?

525
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,600
-None for me.|-No?

526
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,640
ls that a Jewish name, Jacob?

527
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,440
The way you're eating that ham
could turn anyone kosher.

528
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,120
lt's easy now to say Hitler
was wrong about the Jews.

529
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,880
Let me tell you something.
Nobody said he was wrong at the time.

530
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,320
You're up early.

531
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,680
l went down to the PX first thing
and stocked up.

532
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,080
Do you want some coffee?

533
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,720
Real coffee.

534
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,120
No wonder you won the war,eating like this.

535
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,600
The little girl in the photograph,
is that Dora?

536
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,960
The notebook said ''Dora.''

537
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,960
What do you think you'll find in here?

538
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,600
lt's all l have left of him.

539
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:02,000
Very dramatic, the princess.

540
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,240
Don't believe her.

541
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,200
She didn't give two shits for him,
alive or dead.

542
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,360
Dragging around that shrine
of crap and papers.

543
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,920
Meanwhile, fucking with you
the whole time before the war.

544
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,160
She'd make you a good wife, Lena.

545
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,080
She knows all the tricks.

546
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,200
At ease.

547
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,800
Jake, come on into my office.

548
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:46,360
lt takes two MPs to invite a friend over?
No wonder you don't get many dates.

549
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,240
You haven't been home
the last couple of nights. How come?

550
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,960
-Keeping tabs on me, Bernie?
-Those are classified.

551
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,200
l can keep a secret.

552
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,760
What the hell happened between you
and Sikorsky?

553
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,160
Who's asking, you or Muller?

554
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,960
Don't be stupid.
Muller thought l should arrest you.

555
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,560
Like you just did?

556
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,240
What happened to your ear?

557
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,760
Sikorsky says it's safer for me
on the Russian side than on ours.

558
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
-l'm starting to think he's right.
-What else did Sikorsky say?

559
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,000
Come on, l show up in Berlin,
and the driver assigned to me...

560
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,400
...is running around with my old
girlfriend? That's a coincidence.

561
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,880
l knew it was a mistake
to try to help you.

562
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,120
You put me in a car with Tully
because you want Emil Brandt.

563
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,080
-Why?
-My apologies, Jake.

564
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,160
But l'm spending my days
trying to find Adolf Eichmann...

565
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,080
...not filling out trip tickets.

566
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,560
Why don't you get some sleep?
You look like shit.

567
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,200
Thanks for coming in.

568
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,400
We're speaking to you from the end
of a long, smooth runway of an airfield--

569
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,600
-Hi.
-Can l help you, sir?

570
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,600
l need a trip ticket.

571
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,920
That's form 48.

572
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,000
Thank you. Now, if l wanted
to request a specific driver--?

573
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,800
-The same form. Just fill in the name.
-lt's a fella l used a few days ago.

574
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,760
Could you pull that trip ticket?

575
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,040
-What's your name, sir?
-Geismer.

576
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,400
G-E-l-S....

577
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,080
-Thank you.
-You're welcome, sir.

578
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,480
Emil Brandt.

579
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,000
Champagne from the cellar
of Admiral Donitz.

580
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,040
Care for some?

581
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,280
-l wouldn't want it to go to waste.
-Size of the bubbles.

582
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,280
Smaller the better,
that's the key to champagne.

583
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,880
This time last year l was in Anzio,
up to my balls in mud.

584
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,160
Six months ago l was freezing
my ass off in the Ardennes.

585
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,560
The good old days.

586
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,640
When you could tell who the bad guy
was by who was shooting at you.

587
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,080
Something on your mind?

588
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,280
You're hiding someone
in a safe house in Kreuzberg.

589
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,080
Who is it?

590
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,080
Lieutenant Schaeffer should be
more careful about who follows him.

591
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,200
l wouldn't blame Schaeffer.
His name was on the trip ticket.

592
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,040
lt could be
l'm just a very attentive host.

593
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:10,040
Either that, or you thought
l could lead you to Emil Brandt.

594
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,840
What do you think this peace conference
is really about, who gets Poland?

595
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,560
The future. That's why everyone's
come to Potsdam.

596
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,680
What do the next hundred years look like?

597
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,520
All those V-2 rockets that hit London during the war.

598
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,480
Well, you were there.

599
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,320
lf it lasted another year,
that would have been New York...

600
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,080
-...Chicago.
-What's this got to do...

601
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,720
...with the peace conference?

602
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,000
l thought you might have
recognized him.

603
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,520
Our friend in the safe house...

604
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,040
...is Franz Bettmann.

605
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,080
The Russians get Poland...

606
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,960
-...and we get the brains.
-ln a perfect world...

607
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,880
...doesn't a man like Franz Bettmann
wind up building rockets for our side?

608
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,040
But it's not a perfect world.

609
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,360
lt doesn't surprise you
that there are those...

610
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,440
...who don't wish
America well, does it?

611
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,920
And Emil Brandt?

612
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,560
Brandt was Bettmann's secretary.

613
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,520
Like a son to him. Bettmann
wants to bring him along to America.

614
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,520
Awfully sentimental. Hundred thousand
marks for somebody's secretary?

615
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,200
All of them.
As many as we can track down.

616
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,240
Split-level with a Ford in the garage.

617
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,800
Kids in the back yard
playing in the sprinklers.

618
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,000
Strange if you wanted
anything different.

619
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,200
Wives too.

620
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,120
l wouldn't put too much stock
in that SS stuff.

621
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,120
When l was at West Point,
we put a uniform on a mule.

622
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,320
Look at these sleeves
and all this ruching.

623
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,360
Nobody wears
anything like this anymore.

624
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:23,840
l thought we weren't gonna reminisce.
Your rules. Not that we'd have time.

625
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,960
-Why? What's going on?
-Why didn't you tell me Emil...

626
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:30,080
-...was with the rocket program?
-l didn't think it mattered.

627
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,880
He worked directly under Bettmann
and it didn't matter?

628
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,960
-Who told you about Bettmann?
-Muller.

629
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,120
They graduated
from the same polytechnic.

630
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,120
That's why Bettmann hired him.

631
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,800
Why did you talk to Muller?

632
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,760
He has Bettmann in a safe house,
on his way to America to make rockets.

633
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,600
That's why they're looking for Emil.

634
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,360
They're all going, including the wives.
Why didn't you tell me, Lena?

635
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,200
-You know what Bettmann did.
-Everybody knows who he is.

636
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,720
He was famous before the war.
Now, you can either tell me or Bernie.

637
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,160
-He'll be here in two minutes.
-No.

638
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,360
What was Tully selling that was worth
so much money? Some rocket secret?

639
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,000
-No.
-Lena.

640
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,600
-How the rockets were built.
-ls that what's in here?

641
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,120
How they were built?

642
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,080
Lena, please.

643
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,160
A factory inside a mountain.

644
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,160
Tunnels where the American bombs
couldn't reach.

645
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,000
What were once sulfur mines.

646
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,160
Someone had to take them out.

647
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,640
Slave labor. Prisoners, detainees.

648
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,000
That was how they built the rockets.

649
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,040
Emil was asked to calculate
how much to feed them...

650
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,800
...to keep them alive just three months
until the tunnels were completed.

651
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,600
lt's here, in his notebooks.

652
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,960
Eight hundred calories a day.

653
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,840
After that, let them die
and bring in new workers.

654
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,160
The correct answer, it turned out.

655
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,040
lt was more efficient.

656
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:03,440
They called it Dora. Camp Dora.

657
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,960
Thirty thousand died in that camp.

658
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,640
Bettmann ran it.

659
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,080
Every detail.

660
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,800
He hanged people from a crane
right outside his office window.

661
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,000
Take the back stairs. Find Danny
and tell him we have to move again.

662
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,840
And, Lena?

663
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,960
Make sure he knows
where l can find you.

664
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,120
She's playing you, Jake.

665
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,080
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

666
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,880
Muller paid Tully
1 00,000 marks for Emil Brandt...

667
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:03,160
...because he worked for the rocket
program. One big happy family.

668
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,280
They're all coming over|to our side now.

669
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,040
Muller's hiding Franz Bettmann
in a safe house.

670
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,080
Of course he is. The Russians
want them worse than we do.

671
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,680
-They're kidnapping them.
-Not from the Russians...

672
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,520
...you dumb fucking cheesehead,
he's hiding him from you.

673
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,080
They built the rockets
in concentration camps.

674
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,080
Slave labor. Bettmann ran it.

675
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,000
l don't wanna call
your girlfriend a liar.

676
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,160
Let's just say l've met 1 2 people
who swear on their mother...

677
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,160
...they can deliver me Adolf Hitler
if l'll cut them a deal.

678
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:38,000
Her husband was Bettmann's secretary.
l've seen the notebooks.

679
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,600
Be honest with yourself
for a change, Jake.

680
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,080
Has anything good happened
since you came back?

681
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,080
Can l help you?

682
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,000
A watch, perhaps?

683
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,080
-No, thanks.
-How about a cigarette case?

684
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,720
What happened to you?

685
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,440
An experiment
to see if you can transplant...

686
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,040
...a bone from one man into another.

687
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,600
lt turns out you can't.

688
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,840
-Always something worse.
-You can get such stories anywhere.

689
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,480
l have plenty of those.
The Russians trade them for Lugers.

690
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,040
-No, thanks.
-How about a camera?

691
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,000
Rolleiflex.

692
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:57,080
The old ones used to turn the image
upside-down in the viewfinder.

693
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,040
Little mirror sets it right.

694
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,960
To set things right,
a thing to wish for.

695
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,840
The woman who was just in here,
what did she want?

696
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,160
Nothing. She bought nothing.

697
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:13,560
l know her. Lena Brandt.
l know she was here for a reason.

698
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,320
Why?

699
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,000
Papers.

700
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,160
She wanted papers
to get out of Germany.

701
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,680
A Persilschein, like the soap.
That's what they call it.

702
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,000
-To wash the sins away.
-Papers for who?

703
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,160
For herself.

704
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,480
What did she do
that she has to wash away?

705
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,720
Better to ask why l would help her.

706
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,640
Me, with what l survived.

707
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,000
l wanna know.

708
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,120
At the Little White House in Potsdam...

709
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:07,040
...Generalissimo Stalin of Russia is one
of the first to welcome the president.

710
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:11,080
As the meeting is recorded
by Signal Corps and newsreel cameras.

711
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,840
Next to join the group
is Prime Minister Churchill...

712
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,560
...who meets an old conference friend.

713
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,000
The Big Three meetings are held in
Kaiser Wilhelm's former palace.

714
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,160
And President Truman is selected
as chairman of the conference.

715
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:34,040
Here, the fate of Germany and the end
of Japanese aggression will be settled.

716
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,600
Under the flag
that flew over the White House...

717
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,840
...when we declared war on the Axis,
the president states our aims.

718
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,240
We are here today
to raise the flag of victory...

719
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:50,880
...over the capital
of our greatest adversary.

720
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,760
Let's not forget
that we are fighting for peace...

721
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,720
...and for the welfare of mankind.

722
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:05,920
There's not one piece of territory,or one thing...

723
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,880
...of a monetary nature
that we want out of this war.

724
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:14,480
We want peace and prosperity
for the world as a whole.

725
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,880
If we can put this
tremendous machine of ours...

726
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:22,400
...which has made this victory possible,to work for peace...

727
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:26,760
...we can look forward to the greatest
age in the history of mankind.

728
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:09,120
They have a file on her.
l thought Bernie's golem broke into...

729
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,520
...her place looking for Emil,
but it was Lena they were looking for.

730
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:16,120
That's why she had to get out.
Something she did during the war.

731
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,000
Tully wasn't killed in Potsdam,he was killed at Muller's.

732
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:22,400
The body floated with the current.
lt didn't have to be someone...

733
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,080
...with access to the conference.
The Russian gun? Get it at a pawnshop.

734
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,880
-lt could have been anyone.
-Always something worse.

735
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,520
-Did she ask you?
-What?

736
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:34,000
-To get her out of Berlin.
-She asked Tully.

737
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,160
You want my advice?
You'll forget all this.

738
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,960
You'll only get hurt here.
Or hurt someone.

739
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,360
-Where is she, Danny?
-Jake.

740
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,040
-Where is she, Danny?
-Jake.

741
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,040
-Where are you going?
-l have someone to meet.

742
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,960
-Who?
-Stop following me.

743
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,800
-What about the curfew?
-Life is inconvenient sometimes.

744
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,480
-lt's not safe.
-And always, it seems not safe.

745
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,960
-Who?
-Someone who can get me out of Berlin.

746
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,160
-l'll go with you.
-No.

747
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,400
Tully tried to get you out,
now he's dead.

748
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,560
-Someone is waiting.
-Why is it so important for you to leave?

749
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,400
-Please.
-What are you running away from?

750
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,080
You should never have come back
to Berlin.

751
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,080
Why didn't Jake follow me?

752
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,480
Why didn't he try?

753
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,120
He was scared.

754
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,080
Scared I'd really do it.

755
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,120
That I'd shoot him...

756
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,600
...just like Tully.

757
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,680
All these men...

758
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,080
...they want you to cry in their arms.

759
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,960
I had no more tears.

760
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,840
I knew what I had become.

761
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,960
I had to kill Tully.

762
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,120
He was getting
too close to the truth.

763
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,320
Which was that the only way
out of Berlin for me...

764
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,280
...was to do one thing good.

765
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,840
One thing noble.

766
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,720
Otherwise,
Berlin would just follow me.

767
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:46,000
A wife should help her husband.

768
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,280
Isn't that noble?

769
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,720
Isn't that good?

770
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,280
Emil.

771
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:57,240
l'll be candid. l'd think l'm the last
person you'd wanna contact.

772
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,120
Sometimes people surprise you.

773
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,160
Then your husband is alive?

774
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,320
We're going to have to decide
to trust each other, Mrs. Brandt.

775
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,920
To ask to meet me here
in the Russian sector is not a good start.

776
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,160
l'm frightened.

777
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,680
That's not so difficult to understand.

778
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:24,240
When our Gls liberated Camp Dora,
they found bodies stacked up in a room.

779
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,840
Stopped counting at a thousand.

780
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,760
That was the first thing they found.

781
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,200
There's nothing.
Nothing to link Bettmann to any of it.

782
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,440
Not one sheet of paper,
not one witness.

783
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:42,760
Your husband sat in
on every single meeting and took notes.

784
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,800
lf he were alive...

785
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:49,000
...it would be extremely significant.

786
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,360
Yes. He's alive.

787
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,440
He's a good German.

788
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,000
He wants to tell the truth
about Camp Dora.

789
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,800
What is it you want, Mrs. Brandt?

790
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,640
l want to get out of Berlin.

791
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,040
Without my husband.

792
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,720
Does he know that?

793
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,480
No.

794
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,160
lf l let you go,
l'm part of the same hypocrisy as Muller.

795
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,120
But you'll do it.

796
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,800
Bring him in. Bring your husband in.

797
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
We'll talk about it.

798
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,080
Why'd you leave the money on him?

799
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,720
Tully. Did you panic?

800
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,320
l don't know
what you're talking about.

801
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,120
You sure you wouldn't be better off
staying put?

802
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,240
l'm nervous
someone followed me here.

803
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,040
l'm close, Danny,
really close to getting out.

804
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,320
That's when people get careless.

805
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,160
Because you can trust Jake,
if that's who you're worried about.

806
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,960
Have you got somewhere
you can put me?

807
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,360
l've got a Kino
l bought in the French sector.

808
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,440
You know how they are about cinema.

809
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:07,160
Matinee only until the curfew's lifted,
but it still turns a dollar.

810
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,480
After that,
l'm fresh out of places to park you.

811
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,920
l'm going to need some money
when l get to London.

812
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,360
You got a john for me? A rich one?

813
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:25,160
l've got a bloke in the club
who'll give you a thousand marks.

814
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,480
Thinking about it?

815
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:32,160
When l met you,
you'd have a go for a can of tuna.

816
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,520
Hello?

817
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,320
Don't let me interrupt you.

818
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,320
A thousand marks.

819
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,720
That's the deal, isn't it?

820
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,040
You want it straight
or something special?

821
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,080
What's special?

822
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,840
Whatever you want.

823
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,280
-How did Tully like it?
-Rough.

824
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,480
You going to take off your clothes?

825
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,080
You do it.

826
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:07,840
Forget it.

827
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,400
You keep the money.

828
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,280
No. l want to.

829
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:21,120
l would have gotten you out.

830
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,560
l still would.

831
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:30,720
You can never really get out of Berlin.

832
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,720
l followed you.

833
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,080
lt's a good thing too.

834
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,960
Go down to the Zoo Station.

835
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:20,560
Find Danny and wait there until l get
enough money to get both of you out.

836
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,240
Pal, l'm the one sticking my neck out.

837
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,360
We're supposed to meet
Hauptmann Teitel.

838
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:31,560
Do l have to draw a picture? Someone
got to him. Even Bernie they got to.

839
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,520
Stand over there like you're waiting.
You answer the door.

840
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,760
Mrs. Brandt.

841
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,040
And this must be the famous--

842
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,000
Go!

843
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,320
Help him.

844
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,840
Go.

845
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,480
How's your shoulder?

846
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,120
The nurses are very kind.

847
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:21,000
We were told that, if we found you,your husband would follow.

848
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,400
That he was devoted to you.

849
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:26,120
Now l understand why.

850
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:28,360
You're a lovely woman.

851
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,680
Remind me of the gals back home.

852
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,480
Schenectady.

853
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,760
You'd like it there.

854
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,160
Lots of good German folk.

855
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,720
The Sauerfleisch
would make you forget Berlin.

856
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:51,400
Forgetting would be better
than the Sauerfleisch.

857
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,200
Well, forgetting's a two-way street.

858
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:59,040
There are things you wanna forget
and things we wanna forget.

859
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,040
Where are your husband's documents,Mrs. Brandt?

860
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,560
We can't seem to find them.

861
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:10,520
Oh, they're not with my other things?

862
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:12,920
You know they're not.

863
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:17,000
l don't know,l can't remember anything.

864
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:23,080
The medicine they've given me,it's making me feel all dizzy.

865
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:32,040
Most important thing right now...

866
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,400
...is for you to get well.

867
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,200
Mrs. Brandt.

868
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Why, Mr. Geismer.

869
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:57,000
lt's after visiting hours, but l guess
some people just can't follow the rules.

870
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,160
Leave her alone. l mean it.

871
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:02,240
l came here to make sure
she makes the right decision.

872
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,040
You really wanna push me?

873
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:05,840
l wouldn't.

874
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,760
You don't have those documents,do you, Jake?

875
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:17,600
You've seen what months of bombing
can do to a city.

876
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:21,040
lmagine one bomb
could do the same thing.

877
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,800
One bomb.

878
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,800
Stick it on the end of a rocket,
press a button here, goes off over there.

879
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,120
Anywhere, halfway around the world.

880
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,160
That's the future.

881
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,280
The future of mankind's in our hands.

882
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:36,960
lt's our destiny.
Hell, don't you read the papers?

883
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:10,000
-How'd you get in here?
-Who got to you? Was it Muller?

884
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:12,920
-Do l need to call an MP?
-Not just yet.

885
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,480
What's ''Overcast''?

886
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,960
-Who told you about Overcast?
-ls it a code name?

887
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,120
What's it got to do with Lena?

888
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,680
Come on, Bernie, trot out one of your
atrocity stories to get me off your back.

889
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:28,320
l had nothing to do with what happened
to Emil Brandt.

890
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,880
You're the only one that knew
about me and Lena.

891
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,360
So what? They got to me.

892
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,560
Least l got something for it.

893
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:40,320
l get to hang a half dozen Nazis
they wanted to just send to jail.

894
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,920
Not like your girlfriend, though.

895
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:47,000
She got everything she wanted,
didn't she?

896
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,640
She's good at that.

897
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:53,200
Well, you can tell your boy Gunther
that he left one big, swinging loose end.

898
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,320
Lena doesn't have Emil's documents.

899
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,400
l do.

900
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:01,200
-Don't do it, Jake.
-l'll call you later for your quote.

901
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:04,120
You never saw Lena's file, did you?

902
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Yeah. You get me those documents...

903
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:11,160
...or l'll put her in jail
for the rest of her life.

904
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:13,920
l have everything l need
and then some.

905
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,920
Don't think l won't do it.

906
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,440
lf l give you those documents,
then she leaves with me.

907
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:30,040
-Breimer's already taken care of that.
-Not with Bettmann. With me.

908
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:33,200
Anyplace she wants to go.
Anyplace l wanna take her.

909
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:40,320
You've been wrong every step
of the way, Jake. Why stop now?

910
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,840
What's in her file, Bernie?

911
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,680
Why don't you ask her?

912
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:22,040
-You have your papers?
-They won't stop me. l'm with you.

913
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:25,480
-Where are they?
-They're in my purse.

914
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,760
There's something wrong.

915
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,360
Jake?

916
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:35,320
Why was it so important
to get Emil out of Berlin?

917
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,840
And why does Bernie
have a file on you?

918
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:43,040
He had a file on everyone. l told you,
l was the wife of an SS man.

919
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:46,120
Hitler put the rocket program
under the SS two years ago.

920
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:49,840
That's what you told me. That as the
wife of an SS man, you were exempt.

921
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,400
That's true. l told you the truth.

922
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:55,800
How many Jews
were still in Germany in 1 943?

923
01:39:56,040 --> 01:40:00,040
By the time Emil could help you,
you should have been deported or dead.

924
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:08,360
There were not so many.
You are right.

925
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:12,760
So when they caught me,
l turned that to my advantage.

926
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:16,720
l used the skills you taught me.
When l worked for you, for the newspaper.

927
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:19,720
Watch, observe.

928
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:21,840
The stupid risks they would take--

929
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:26,240
Lunch at Aschinger's. 
--just to remind themselves they were still human.

930
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:32,040
l found 12.

931
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:38,600
l turned 12 people 
over to the Gestapo.
