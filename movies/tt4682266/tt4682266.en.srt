00:00:36,577 --> 00:00:40,515
<i>There's an old Native
American proverb that says...</i>

4
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:43,484
<i>inside every person,
there are two bears...</i>

5
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:45,919
<i>forever locked in combat
for your soul.</i>

6
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:49,022
<i>One bear is all things good.</i>

7
00:00:49,056 --> 00:00:52,527
<i>Compassion, love, trust.</i>

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,530
<i>The other is all things evil.</i>

9
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,299
<i>Fear, shame,</i>

10
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,468
<i>and self-destruction.</i>

11
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:06,474
- What's happening?
- We have to run...

12
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:08,276
as fast as we can!

13
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:09,976
Wait!

14
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:18,653
Don't let go of my hand!

15
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,406
What's happening?

16
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:41,242
Here! Hide here!

17
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:44,412
I have to go help them.

18
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:46,214
- No! No, Dad, please!
- Dani!

19
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:47,981
Please don't leave me alone!

20
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:50,218
Dani,
I have to go back.

21
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,252
Stay here.

22
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:56,257
Hey!

23
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,294
Run! No! Get away!

24
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:01,596
Run!

25
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:04,365
No!

26
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:29,183
Hello?

27
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:42,597
Hello? Let me out of here!

28
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,764
<i>Relax, Dani.</i>

29
00:03:43,798 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>I'm on my way to you.</i>

30
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:54,709
Where am I?
Where is my family?

31
00:03:54,742 --> 00:03:58,346
I know you're scared,
but you're safe now.

32
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,449
If I could come in,
I'll explain.

33
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:02,750
Would that be
all right?

34
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:14,127
Doors. Infirmary.

35
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:25,105
Hi, Dani.

36
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:26,707
I'm Dr. Reyes.

37
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:29,176
If you take a seat,
I'll free your hand.

38
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,825
Dani, what I'm about
to tell you...

39
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:47,328
is going to be
very difficult.

40
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:52,433
An F5 tornado touched down
on your reservation.

41
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:55,369
No.

42
00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:58,239
You're the sole survivor
of a terrible tragedy.

43
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,241
No, no.

44
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,747
It was growling!
Something was chasing us!

45
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:08,316
What?

46
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:13,554
Sometimes trauma makes us
remember things...

47
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:14,755
that aren't real.

48
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,461
Here.

49
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:23,129
I think this may be yours.

50
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,267
I'm really sorry.

51
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,451
Why didn't I just die
with them?

52
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:46,152
Why me?

53
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:48,789
Survivor's guilt is a
common reaction to trauma.

54
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,591
We look for reasons.

55
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,795
Most of the time,
we find none.

56
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,330
But the reason
you survived...

57
00:05:57,798 --> 00:06:00,368
is because you're
a very uncommon girl.

58
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:05,439
Your reservation was wiped
off the face of the earth.

59
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:07,808
But you made it out
with barely a scratch.

60
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:12,780
Do you know
what mutants are?

61
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:17,418
Mutation most often
occurs in puberty.

62
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:21,355
You might spend the first
13 years of your life...

63
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:22,556
relatively normal.

64
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,726
Then, just like that...

65
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,763
you come of age and
discover your true nature.

66
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,767
What's my true nature?

67
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,502
We'll have to figure
that out together.

68
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:40,274
Then how do you know
I'm a mutant?

69
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:41,442
The man I work for

70
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:43,444
has a way of recognizing
new mutants...

71
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:45,846
the moment their condition
reveals itself.

72
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,482
That's how
we discovered you

73
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:49,717
and your
fellow patients.

74
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:54,522
You're not alone, Dani.

75
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,397
This is a facility for
young mutants like yourself.

76
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:04,965
Teens who need
some extra care...

77
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:08,636
before they can go on to
live healthy adult lives.

78
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:14,608
There's some warm clothes.
Toiletries.

79
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:22,283
How long do I have
to stay here?

80
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,385
Until I decide
you're not a danger.

81
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:26,554
Danger to who?

82
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,823
Yourself.

83
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:35,529
You have been through a lot.

84
00:07:37,531 --> 00:07:38,799
Get some rest, okay?

85
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,036
We'll talk more
in the morning.

86
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,270
Dr. Reyes.

87
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:48,242
There's really
no one left?

88
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:53,547
But you're
in a safe place now.

89
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:55,850
Nothing can hurt you
in here, Dani.

90
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:58,452
Good night.

91
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,035
Yesterday, I asked you
to think about...

92
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:17,605
the first time
your mutation manifested.

93
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:22,943
Would anyone like to share?

94
00:08:22,977 --> 00:08:24,411
Sam?

95
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,714
Illyana?

96
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:30,584
Roberto?

97
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:33,988
Rahne?

98
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:38,893
Look, we can't help each other
unless we talk to each other.

99
00:08:38,926 --> 00:08:41,495
I've said this
a hundred times.

100
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:46,467
This program can't help you
if you refuse to participate.

101
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,870
So, Rahne,
why don't you start?

102
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:52,873
I...

103
00:08:57,978 --> 00:08:59,647
Please join us, Dani.

104
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,652
This is our new patient,
Danielle Moonstar.

105
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,456
Oh, it's serious.

106
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:14,361
Let's do our best
to make her feel at home.

107
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:16,897
Go ahead, Rahne.

108
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:20,835
Right.

109
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,537
I was 13.

110
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,475
I remember running
through the woods.

111
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:32,980
<i>How did you feel?</i>

112
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,615
Free.

113
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,653
Like, the most free
I'd felt my whole life.

114
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:44,391
But guilty, too.

115
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,127
Why guilty?

116
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,099
Because I knew it was bad.

117
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:56,570
I went to Reverend Craig...

118
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:58,539
to see if he could
pray it out of me.

119
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:04,678
He asked me to show him,
so I changed.

120
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:06,780
And what did
Reverend Craig do?

121
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,052
Beat me
about half to death.

122
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:14,555
Said I was a witch...

123
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,992
that I was going to hell.

124
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:28,702
Would anyone else like
to share their first time?

125
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,438
New girl.

126
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:33,707
How fucked up are you?

127
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:35,943
- Illyana.
- Drugs, I bet.

128
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:38,445
Or a nympho, maybe.
Hopefully.

129
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,513
Keep behaving...

130
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:40,547
exactly like you are
right now...

131
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:42,917
and we can all just spend
the day in solitary.

132
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:48,055
I want all of you
to think very carefully...

133
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:50,124
about how you'd like to use
your time here.

134
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:53,694
And how long
you want that time to be.

135
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:57,765
Illyana,
since you're already up...

136
00:10:57,798 --> 00:10:59,533
why don't you show
Dani around?

137
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:01,068
And why do I have to?

138
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,571
Because I'm asking you.

139
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:08,909
How long
have you been here?

140
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:12,680
Are there
any other doctors?

141
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:15,516
- Why aren't you...
- Shh.

142
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,619
What's that,
Lockheed?

143
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,723
Oh, I know.

144
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:25,526
I hate her, too.

145
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:36,837
Dr. Reyes!

146
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:42,576
Main building. Dorms.

147
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,545
Chapel, if you believe
in that shit.

148
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,580
And garden.

149
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:48,582
You don't know how
to grow weed, do you?

150
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:49,650
No.

151
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:52,886
What kind of
Indian are you?

152
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,055
Cheyenne.

153
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,725
I wasn't actually asking.

154
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:05,132
You're my lookout.

155
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,841
Where are we?

156
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:15,576
Who knows?

157
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,077
Dr. Reyes always says...

158
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,513
the closest town
is 20 miles away.

159
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:22,683
But she could be lying...

160
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:24,852
to keep us
from trying to escape.

161
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,887
There's no fence.

162
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:28,555
Nope.

163
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:30,291
No fence.

164
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:34,195
Nothing between you
and freedom.

165
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:44,138
Run, new girl, run!

166
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:51,078
Faster!

167
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:31,952
Aw. This isn't a hospital,
Pocahontas.

168
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:35,722
It's a cage.

169
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:37,624
And now you're trapped
in it forever.

170
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:44,232
Man, I really
should have warned you.

171
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,337
- I have to go to help them.
- No! No, Dad, please!

172
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,871
- <i>Dani!</i>
- <i>Please don't leave me alone!</i>

173
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,806
<i>Survivor's guilt is
a common reaction to trauma.</i>

174
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,741
Stay here!

175
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:29,676
<i>You're the sole survivor.</i>

176
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,942
What are you doing
out here?

177
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:37,110
Sorry.

178
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,180
I didn't mean
to scare you.

179
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:47,488
Wow, this is
really high up.

180
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:49,490
A fall from here
would mess you up.

181
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:52,092
It would kill me.

182
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,161
Instantly.

183
00:15:54,195 --> 00:15:56,364
I wouldn't feel a thing.

184
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:59,400
I want to get
out of here, too...

185
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:02,169
but not like this.

186
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:07,774
My home is gone.
My dad's dead.

187
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:12,513
Where I'm from, we believe
suicides go straight to hell.

188
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:18,286
Always kinda scared me
out of giving it a go.

189
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:22,190
I don't wanna be here.
I wanna be with my family.

190
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:26,827
If they're gone
and you're here...

191
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,895
maybe it's
for a reason.

192
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:32,099
Maybe it's not time
to be with them just yet.

193
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:33,934
But I'm all alone.

194
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,006
There's two people
up here.

195
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,278
You calling me a nobody?

196
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:47,014
Please.

197
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,982
It's going to get better.

198
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,520
I promise.

199
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,148
Let's live a little longer,
Dani Moonstar.

200
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:26,387
Dani, where were you?

201
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:29,390
- Uh...
- I was just...

202
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,158
showing her
the chapel.

203
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:32,959
No one is ever to be
unaccounted for, Rahne.

204
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:34,027
You know that.

205
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:35,463
I'm sorry,
Dr. Reyes.

206
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:37,432
Okay.

207
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:42,303
Did I just
get you in trouble?

208
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:44,238
It's okay.
She likes me.

209
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,174
I'm one of the good ones.
Me and Sam.

210
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,220
Holy shit,
I thought he just exploded.

211
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:00,621
No.

212
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:02,557
That's his thing.
He can blast off.

213
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,193
Zero to 100
like a cannonball.

214
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:09,297
Not so good at landing,
though.

215
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,366
Is this,
like, practice?

216
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:14,602
I don't know.

217
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,136
Sometimes it seems
like he's out here...

218
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:17,338
just trying
to hurt himself.

219
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,643
He grew up
in a small town in Kentucky.

220
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:24,479
Did really well in school...

221
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:26,947
but had to drop out to work
in the mines with his dad.

222
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,082
Help the family and all.

223
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:30,251
Poor guy.

224
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:32,587
Right? Poor guy.

225
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,055
And then there's Roberto.

226
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:37,492
His family's, like,
the richest family in Brazil.

227
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:41,928
Thanks, doggy.

228
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:44,699
Probably living the sweet
life before he got here.

229
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:46,967
Something must have
gone really wrong.

230
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:49,102
What's his power?

231
00:18:49,136 --> 00:18:52,273
He won't tell,
but he's got something.

232
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:54,275
Parents sent him here
to be cured.

233
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:56,310
Is there a cure
for being an asshole?

234
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,179
Maybe he's just
the crazy one.

235
00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:00,681
No.
That spot's taken.

236
00:19:06,254 --> 00:19:07,954
Well, I really
enjoyed spending...

237
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:10,425
the day with you, Dani,
but I should go.

238
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,959
We're not supposed to be
in each other's rooms and...

239
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:15,296
Why is she always
watching us?

240
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,132
For our own good.

241
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,669
She means well.
She's trying to help us.

242
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,372
If you follow the treatment,
you'll get out of here, Dani.

243
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,041
Probably before
the rest of us cuckoos.

244
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:31,679
Well, night.

245
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:34,282
Rahne?

246
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:39,620
Thank you for helping me.

247
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:42,323
What do I know?

248
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:44,325
Maybe we both
should have jumped.

249
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:17,090
Dish duty is really
trimming down the wardrobe.

250
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:19,092
Every time
your shirt gets dirty...

251
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,127
you just throw it away?

252
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:25,366
Here. It's all yours.

253
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,101
Cool.

254
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:31,205
Was it scary?

255
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:33,307
Working in the mines?

256
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:36,777
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

257
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,153
<i>No!</i>

258
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:54,462
Oh, Jesus.

259
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:55,730
I got it.

260
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:59,433
You couldn't pay me
a million dollars...

261
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,736
to go in one of
those things.

262
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,170
I couldn't pay you a
million dollars anyway.

263
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:06,274
When we get out of here,
I'll spot ya.

264
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,408
My folks are good for it.

265
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:09,544
Night, Kentucky.

266
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:10,811
Night, man.

267
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,392
Hello?

268
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,429
Somebody!

269
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:02,155
Dad?

270
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:05,259
Samuel.

271
00:23:06,961 --> 00:23:08,796
What did you do?

272
00:23:49,737 --> 00:23:50,938
Oops.

273
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:06,954
There aren't any cameras
in here, are there?

274
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,557
Only safe place
in the building.

275
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,992
But there could
still be mics, so... Shh.

276
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:32,379
Wow, that's, um...
That's some serious body art.

277
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:36,283
Tattoo wasn't
painful enough?

278
00:24:36,884 --> 00:24:38,753
It wasn't my idea.

279
00:24:40,921 --> 00:24:42,723
What's it stand for?

280
00:24:49,964 --> 00:24:52,266
I'm sorry. I don't want
to talk about it.

281
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:20,027
<i>Control.</i>

282
00:25:27,802 --> 00:25:30,304
Control.

283
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,047
Control.

284
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:49,657
Control.

285
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:57,097
Control.

286
00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:02,970
And...

287
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,609
control.

288
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:10,644
- <i>Darling.</i>
- <i>I can't do this.</i>

289
00:26:10,678 --> 00:26:13,414
I have one arm.
It takes two.

290
00:26:17,017 --> 00:26:18,652
<i>We can do this.</i>

291
00:26:22,423 --> 00:26:24,024
Hey, Standing Rock.

292
00:26:24,892 --> 00:26:26,760
You want a buffalo wing?

293
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:30,564
You people love buffalo,
don't you?

294
00:26:30,598 --> 00:26:31,632
Jeez, Illya,
will you just...

295
00:26:31,665 --> 00:26:32,900
- leave her alone?
- No.

296
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:34,969
It's okay.

297
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:40,174
"Standing Rock."
That's a good one.

298
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,409
More original
than "Pocahontas."

299
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:46,046
That was huge
in fifth grade.

300
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,849
You don't scare me.

301
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:51,151
My dad told me
about bitches like you.

302
00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:52,386
Oh.

303
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:56,156
Well, here.

304
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:57,691
Why don't you show us
on the puppet...

305
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:58,826
where Daddy touched you?

306
00:27:00,228 --> 00:27:02,129
- Lockheed!
- Hey, guys, come on!

307
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,765
You keep my father's name
out of your mouth, bitch!

308
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,002
You don't know
anything about me.

309
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:09,503
Do you know anything?

310
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:11,705
Sixteen years old and
doesn't even know her power.

311
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:13,507
Seems like that mutant period
should've kicked in by now.

312
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,642
- Leave her alone.
- Yo. Hold up.

313
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,477
I'm helping her.
This is therapy!

314
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,680
- Get your hands off me.
- Or you'll what?

315
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:22,217
Let's find out.
What are you gonna do, huh?

316
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,752
Fuck! Bitch!

317
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:30,591
Illyana, don't!

318
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,560
You know the rules.

319
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:35,663
No powers in here.

320
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:36,830
And definitely no fighting.

321
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:42,703
Sorry, Doctor.

322
00:27:42,736 --> 00:27:44,672
I thought maybe Dani
was invincible.

323
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,942
Just wanted to see
if I was right.

324
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:50,044
Solitary. Both of you.

325
00:27:50,077 --> 00:27:51,478
But it wasn't
Dani's...

326
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:54,615
Everyone else,
lights out in 10.

327
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,920
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Mmm.

328
00:28:00,788 --> 00:28:02,523
I'll see you
in hell.

329
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,494
Come on.

330
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,638
What's that, Lockheed?

331
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:20,208
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

332
00:28:23,944 --> 00:28:26,480
We'll go to our
special place, okay?

333
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:32,486
The Smiling Men can't get us
in our special place.

334
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,184
Dani?

335
00:30:12,152 --> 00:30:13,987
What's happening to me?

336
00:30:30,771 --> 00:30:32,739
You're clearly
manifesting something...

337
00:30:32,773 --> 00:30:35,843
but we need to do more tests
to find out what it is.

338
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,979
It's okay.
I'm a doctor.

339
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:41,815
Actually, I come from
a family of doctors.

340
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:43,351
My mother was a vet.

341
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:47,388
A lot of pets came in
with rattlesnake bites.

342
00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:52,260
Did you know baby rattlesnakes
are more dangerous...

343
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:55,028
than adult ones?

344
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,864
They haven't learned
how to control...

345
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,166
how much venom
they secrete.

346
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,203
Even the mutants
we call heroes today...

347
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:04,771
when they first
got their powers...

348
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:06,640
chances are
they hurt someone.

349
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:10,311
That's why new mutants
are dangerous.

350
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:14,081
- And they need to be...
- Locked up?

351
00:31:15,949 --> 00:31:18,286
Sequestered...

352
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,689
from average humans,
for their safety and ours.

353
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:25,826
Put pressure.

354
00:31:51,386 --> 00:31:54,355
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

355
00:31:56,191 --> 00:31:58,259
It's been a week
since my last confession.

356
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:01,895
My superior runs
a facility for gifted mutants.

357
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:04,765
You could move there after
this, if you wanted to.

358
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,067
Rahne said I could even
get out of here faster...

359
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,936
if I follow your program.

360
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,138
I've noticed
you and Rahne...

361
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:13,374
have taken a liking
to each other.

362
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:16,109
That's good.
She's a good influence.

363
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,812
And she's right.

364
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:22,816
It's important we find out
exactly what your power is...

365
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:24,818
so we can help you
control it.

366
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:30,191
I masturbated twice.

367
00:32:31,058 --> 00:32:33,428
I lied to Dr. Reyes.

368
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:35,296
And I was up
in the vents again.

369
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:41,802
Hello?

370
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,809
I'm gonna say one Our Father
and two Hail Marys, okay?

371
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:54,382
Hello?

372
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:07,528
Who's there?

373
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:09,297
<i>Witch!</i>

374
00:33:11,332 --> 00:33:12,467
<i>You witch!</i>

375
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,034
<i>I'll flay the flesh</i>

376
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:16,371
<i>from your bones!</i>

377
00:33:16,404 --> 00:33:18,105
Demons can't
come in churches.

378
00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:19,806
Demons can't come in churches.

379
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,442
Demons can't come in churches.

380
00:33:30,418 --> 00:33:32,253
- Hey.
- Hey.

381
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:33,887
Where have you been?

382
00:33:35,423 --> 00:33:37,090
Are you okay?

383
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:39,159
Yeah.

384
00:33:39,193 --> 00:33:40,961
Just needed some time
to myself.

385
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:42,029
Come on.

386
00:33:43,197 --> 00:33:45,300
Where are you guys going?

387
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,067
Reyes is asleep,
so we're going up to the...

388
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,969
To the "never mind,
you're not invited."

389
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:50,538
Come on, Illy.

390
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,172
Come on,
we'll show you.

391
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:55,410
Whatever.

392
00:34:05,386 --> 00:34:07,854
So, you guys hang out
in an attic?

393
00:34:07,888 --> 00:34:09,290
Yeah.

394
00:34:09,324 --> 00:34:11,459
It's one of the only places
Reyes can't watch us.

395
00:34:11,492 --> 00:34:12,493
It's full of cool shit...

396
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:15,229
from back before this was even
a place for mutants.

397
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:17,465
Let's play
a little game.

398
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:32,145
Dare.

399
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,448
You can't say dare.

400
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:36,317
Fine. Jesus.

401
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:38,952
Truth.

402
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:43,957
How many girls
have you been with?

403
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,892
Like I can even remember.

404
00:34:47,195 --> 00:34:48,262
Rahne?

405
00:34:50,097 --> 00:34:51,098
He's lying.

406
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:55,470
It's a lie detector.
We know.

407
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,105
Fine. Three.

408
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,973
That's not bad.

409
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:04,612
No, look.

410
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:06,514
- I told you.
- What?

411
00:35:06,547 --> 00:35:07,948
Why not?

412
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,418
I get too hot.

413
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,021
Yeah, you think it's funny?
Your turn, asshole.

414
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:25,031
What's the coal for?

415
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:27,535
My dad gave it to me.

416
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:30,170
Right before...

417
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,007
he passed.

418
00:35:35,075 --> 00:35:36,377
I'm sorry.

419
00:35:37,712 --> 00:35:39,045
Don't be.

420
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:43,016
I belong here, so...

421
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:45,720
I'm not sure
any of us belong here.

422
00:35:45,753 --> 00:35:47,355
I think I do.

423
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:50,090
Why?

424
00:35:50,123 --> 00:35:52,226
New girl,
he already had his question.

425
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,561
It's your turn.

426
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:56,963
Aren't you gonna
hook me up?

427
00:35:56,997 --> 00:35:59,600
I don't need a polygraph
to tell if you're lying.

428
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:04,539
What's your power?

429
00:36:06,574 --> 00:36:08,242
I don't know.

430
00:36:08,276 --> 00:36:10,745
I thought you were
going to say that.

431
00:36:10,778 --> 00:36:12,979
How about
another question?

432
00:36:13,013 --> 00:36:15,015
What's with the stupid bear?

433
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:18,186
Same as Sam.

434
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,322
My dad made it for me.

435
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:24,725
Why?

436
00:36:26,294 --> 00:36:28,429
When I was little,
I was...

437
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,501
I was really afraid
of the dark.

438
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:35,570
Like, so afraid,
it was impossible...

439
00:36:35,603 --> 00:36:37,338
to get me to go to bed.

440
00:36:37,371 --> 00:36:41,742
So my dad, he told me
a legend of a bear.

441
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:45,680
A Demon Bear...

442
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:50,384
that lives inside of us
and feeds off of our fear.

443
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,186
That'll help a kid sleep.

444
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,721
Shut up, Berto.

445
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:56,990
So, when you're born...

446
00:36:57,658 --> 00:37:01,496
the bear is tiny and weak.

447
00:37:03,397 --> 00:37:05,131
And the older you get...

448
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:10,003
the more afraid
we become...

449
00:37:11,672 --> 00:37:14,442
the bigger and the stronger
the bear gets.

450
00:37:17,512 --> 00:37:19,079
My dad, he...

451
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:23,484
he made this for me so that
I would always remember...

452
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:26,119
how small it was
when I was born.

453
00:37:28,256 --> 00:37:30,725
So that I would remember
to never be afraid.

454
00:37:34,595 --> 00:37:35,596
Enough.

455
00:37:36,497 --> 00:37:37,532
Let's do this.

456
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:47,608
Well, come on.

457
00:37:50,545 --> 00:37:52,380
Truth.

458
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:54,348
Why are you here?

459
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:57,685
Because I killed 18 men.

460
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,256
One by one.

461
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,793
With my sword.

462
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,628
<i>And Lockheed.</i>

463
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:09,196
<i>You're lying.</i>

464
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,464
<i>No, she's not.</i>

465
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:12,233
<i>You don't believe me?</i>

466
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:17,338
<i>I'm the most powerful
mutant here.</i>

467
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:19,707
Today, I'd like to talk
about obedience.

468
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:23,143
If you want any hope
of moving on...

469
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,879
to my
superior's facility...

470
00:38:24,912 --> 00:38:28,114
it's crucial that I know
you can be trusted.

471
00:38:30,785 --> 00:38:31,852
Yes?

472
00:38:31,886 --> 00:38:35,289
What if we don't wanna move on
to your boss's facility?

473
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:37,191
You know, what if
I just wanna go home?

474
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:40,628
Sam, you remember
what happened.

475
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:43,698
You think they stopped
looking for you?

476
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:47,568
If you weren't here,
you'd be in prison or worse.

477
00:38:47,602 --> 00:38:49,537
I was...
It was an accident.

478
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,372
You think anyone outside
this room would believe that?

479
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:53,608
I would.
Sam is a good guy.

480
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:55,876
Even if I'm not...

481
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,511
do I really have to spend...

482
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,180
my whole life in here
for one mistake?

483
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:00,348
Once you're better...

484
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:01,716
When am I better?

485
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:03,517
What's gotten
into you, Sam?

486
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:05,386
Look,
something's not right.

487
00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:07,855
I'm seeing things,
terrible nightmares.

488
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:09,690
Uh...

489
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,726
When will I ever get better?

490
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:14,462
You're better
when I say so.

491
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:15,863
No, forget it.
It's bullshit.

492
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,398
You're not listening
to me.

493
00:39:46,827 --> 00:39:48,829
What did you do to her?

494
00:39:48,863 --> 00:39:51,465
I may have
spiked her tea.

495
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,249
Hold those bag of bones
together, man!

496
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:09,316
Whoa!

497
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:21,262
Whoo!

498
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:23,798
Indubitably,
it's indisputable...

499
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:27,668
that you are the absolute
worst mutants I've ever seen.

500
00:40:27,702 --> 00:40:31,906
Ergo, my superior will be
very, very disappointed in me.

501
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:34,809
I surmise I may even
receive a spanking...

502
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:36,444
for being so, so bad.

503
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:38,446
Oh. Oh, my superior!

504
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:42,483
Yeah, who is this superior
she's always talking about?

505
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,318
Isn't it obvious?

506
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,854
You know who
the X-Men are, right?

507
00:40:46,887 --> 00:40:50,324
Yeah. It's just,
why would we wanna be X-Men?

508
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:52,760
Right. I ain't wearing no suit
and fighting people. I'm rich.

509
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:54,595
What, they pay you
to be X-Men now?

510
00:40:54,628 --> 00:40:56,497
I wouldn't mind
being an X-Man.

511
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,965
And why would
they need a dog?

512
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,338
Children.

513
00:41:06,474 --> 00:41:07,675
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

514
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:09,944
Where?

515
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:11,378
It's a surprise.

516
00:41:18,085 --> 00:41:19,720
What are those two
up to?

517
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:21,989
Cheers.

518
00:41:23,657 --> 00:41:25,960
Rahne, wait.

519
00:41:25,993 --> 00:41:27,728
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

520
00:41:27,762 --> 00:41:29,830
Yeah. I can see
in the dark.

521
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:32,266
Just follow me.

522
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,904
<i>You know
how much trouble...</i>

523
00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:37,972
<i>we're gonna get in
for this?</i>

524
00:41:40,975 --> 00:41:43,811
What's she gonna do?
Kick us out?

525
00:41:45,479 --> 00:41:47,381
I don't wanna
be here anyway.

526
00:41:47,782 --> 00:41:49,016
Yeah.

527
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:50,918
But as long as Dr. Phil
has her magic bubble...

528
00:41:50,951 --> 00:41:52,586
over the grounds...

529
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,021
you don't have a choice.

530
00:41:54,822 --> 00:41:56,056
Yeah.

531
00:41:56,957 --> 00:41:59,293
I never did
have a choice.

532
00:42:00,528 --> 00:42:01,962
What do you mean?

533
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:09,737
You know, I had to go and
work in the mines with my dad.

534
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:15,075
I was still new
to the job.

535
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:17,344
And this one day,
I just...

536
00:42:19,914 --> 00:42:22,616
I just got
claustrophobic.

537
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,452
Like I couldn't breathe.
It was...

538
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:27,988
And he blasted.

539
00:42:29,824 --> 00:42:30,891
Yeah.

540
00:42:35,896 --> 00:42:37,631
I killed my dad.

541
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:41,836
Most of his crew.

542
00:42:44,538 --> 00:42:47,575
I just... I just couldn't
forgive myself.

543
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:49,543
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't...

544
00:42:49,577 --> 00:42:50,744
Just kept thinking...

545
00:42:52,513 --> 00:42:55,049
I would do anything
to change that.

546
00:43:01,155 --> 00:43:02,857
What about you?

547
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,458
What did you do?

548
00:43:07,494 --> 00:43:08,662
Nothing.

549
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:30,417
Wait, so you could get out
of the building...

550
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:31,619
this whole time?

551
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:33,153
I can get anywhere
in the hospital...

552
00:43:33,188 --> 00:43:34,555
through the vents.

553
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:36,790
This is the only
way out, though.

554
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:39,426
I'm always paranoid
Reyes is gonna find it.

555
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,428
Yeah, she's gonna
find out a lot tomorrow.

556
00:43:41,462 --> 00:43:43,430
Trust me. This is worth it.

557
00:43:48,102 --> 00:43:49,603
Come on,
lay down.

558
00:44:04,785 --> 00:44:06,487
Oh, my God.

559
00:44:11,825 --> 00:44:13,560
Isn't that beautiful?

560
00:44:14,595 --> 00:44:15,829
Yeah.

561
00:44:16,563 --> 00:44:17,731
It is.

562
00:44:18,732 --> 00:44:20,567
It's our beautiful cage.

563
00:44:22,102 --> 00:44:24,505
That's what my father
called it.

564
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,443
You had a dome
over your reservation?

565
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,948
No.

566
00:44:36,617 --> 00:44:39,720
He meant our bodies.

567
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:43,857
Like...

568
00:44:44,925 --> 00:44:47,228
how we're trapped in them.

569
00:44:48,162 --> 00:44:50,965
And at death,
our souls are free.

570
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:55,203
Free to be
with the ones you love.

571
00:44:57,638 --> 00:44:59,707
Sounds pretty nice, honestly.

572
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:40,781
Sorry, I thought
I heard you...

573
00:45:43,684 --> 00:45:45,019
Want company?

574
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:47,322
Fine.

575
00:45:47,355 --> 00:45:50,591
But you have to turn off
the lights.

576
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:52,993
Sure.

577
00:45:56,697 --> 00:45:58,098
Ooh, scary.

578
00:45:58,132 --> 00:45:59,633
Are you scared?

579
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:00,768
No.

580
00:46:01,735 --> 00:46:03,271
I think you are.

581
00:46:04,305 --> 00:46:05,672
Virgin.

582
00:46:07,342 --> 00:46:08,909
You have to catch me.

583
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:11,011
Hey, wait.

584
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,786
Doesn't feel
like it's real.

585
00:46:21,722 --> 00:46:24,691
Sometimes it doesn't feel
like you're real.

586
00:46:26,394 --> 00:46:28,162
What do you mean?

587
00:46:34,034 --> 00:46:35,769
It's just that...

588
00:46:37,372 --> 00:46:39,640
you're just so nice to me.

589
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:43,710
Too nice.

590
00:46:43,744 --> 00:46:46,181
Sometimes I feel like
I made you up.

591
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,755
You didn't make me up.

592
00:46:54,788 --> 00:46:56,757
I promise you, I'm real.

593
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:19,847
Your eyes.

594
00:47:20,914 --> 00:47:22,317
Oh.

595
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,884
I'm sorry.

596
00:47:23,917 --> 00:47:25,119
Don't.

597
00:47:26,687 --> 00:47:28,189
They're beautiful.

598
00:47:32,693 --> 00:47:36,297
I've never
done this before.

599
00:47:36,864 --> 00:47:38,799
With a girl?

600
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:40,801
With anyone.

601
00:48:00,188 --> 00:48:01,722
What's wrong?

602
00:48:06,427 --> 00:48:10,265
I can't. I just need
a second to cool down.

603
00:48:11,131 --> 00:48:12,866
Isn't this what you want?

604
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:15,403
Yeah. It's...

605
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,373
I can't get too hot.

606
00:48:19,507 --> 00:48:21,708
If I get too hot, I...

607
00:48:24,144 --> 00:48:25,879
You can tell me.

608
00:48:27,382 --> 00:48:29,317
I was with my girlfriend.

609
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:35,323
I tried to hold her...

610
00:48:37,824 --> 00:48:40,395
but I burned her with my...

611
00:48:40,428 --> 00:48:43,063
- I killed her with my hands.
- Hey.

612
00:48:43,096 --> 00:48:44,731
- I burned her.
- Hey.

613
00:48:45,165 --> 00:48:46,700
Look at me.

614
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:50,704
You can't burn me.

615
00:48:52,373 --> 00:48:54,209
You won't hurt me.

616
00:48:56,511 --> 00:48:57,811
But...

617
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,715
you do need to
catch me again.

618
00:49:12,493 --> 00:49:13,760
<i>Illy?</i>

619
00:49:22,337 --> 00:49:23,504
Illy?

620
00:49:45,092 --> 00:49:46,860
Mariella! No!

621
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:58,939
What is it?

622
00:49:59,474 --> 00:50:00,508
It's Berto.

623
00:50:10,184 --> 00:50:12,387
Control room, unlock.

624
00:50:20,093 --> 00:50:22,062
- What's going on?
- Go back to your room.

625
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:53,227
Damn. What happened here?

626
00:50:57,298 --> 00:50:58,366
What?

627
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:00,501
What's the code, huh?

628
00:51:00,535 --> 00:51:02,236
Give me my phone back.

629
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,937
I am in charge here.

630
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,606
You're not in charge of shit.

631
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,543
Did you not see what happened?
Huh? Illyana tried to kill me.

632
00:51:08,576 --> 00:51:10,077
It wasn't me.

633
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,346
Roberto, Illyana was
in her room.

634
00:51:11,379 --> 00:51:12,213
Bullshit!

635
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:14,915
There was nobody
in the pool but you.

636
00:51:14,948 --> 00:51:17,251
Did you see
what I saw? Huh?

637
00:51:17,285 --> 00:51:18,386
We're trapped in here
with demons...

638
00:51:18,419 --> 00:51:19,454
and you want us
to stay trapped!

639
00:51:19,487 --> 00:51:20,887
- Give it back.
- What's the code?

640
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:22,557
- Hey! Berto, chill.
- Chill nothing.

641
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,057
I'm calling the cops
and getting out of here.

642
00:51:24,091 --> 00:51:25,926
- You're not going anywhere.
- Yeah? Says who?

643
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:26,993
Says your doctor.

644
00:51:27,027 --> 00:51:28,895
Bullshit.

645
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,399
You're not a doctor.

646
00:51:33,668 --> 00:51:36,169
I've known men like you.

647
00:51:36,204 --> 00:51:38,506
Men who like to keep children
trapped in cages.

648
00:51:39,172 --> 00:51:41,242
I've known them...

649
00:51:41,275 --> 00:51:43,009
and I've killed them.

650
00:51:44,044 --> 00:51:46,180
She wasn't in the pool.

651
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:50,618
But I know
what you did to me.

652
00:51:50,651 --> 00:51:53,920
You're gonna help the others
clean this mess.

653
00:51:53,954 --> 00:51:56,089
In your dreams.

654
00:51:59,694 --> 00:52:01,362
Let me out of here!

655
00:52:01,396 --> 00:52:03,331
Damn it!
I am not dying in here!

656
00:52:03,364 --> 00:52:04,532
Do you understand me?

657
00:52:04,565 --> 00:52:06,099
Let me out!

658
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:07,502
Initiate lockdown.

659
00:52:14,275 --> 00:52:16,977
Today, Dani, we're
going to go a little deeper.

660
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:18,212
Clench your fist.

661
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,182
This will relax you.

662
00:52:35,329 --> 00:52:37,998
I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

663
00:52:39,065 --> 00:52:41,402
I want you
to respond truthfully.

664
00:52:41,436 --> 00:52:43,304
What's the last thing
you remember...

665
00:52:43,337 --> 00:52:45,239
before coming here?

666
00:52:50,478 --> 00:52:52,313
My dad woke me up.

667
00:52:52,346 --> 00:52:54,147
He said we had to run.

668
00:52:55,316 --> 00:52:56,651
And everything was shaking.

669
00:52:56,684 --> 00:52:58,352
What were you
running from?

670
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:01,389
He said it was a tornado.

671
00:53:01,422 --> 00:53:04,124
We both know
it wasn't a tornado, Dani.

672
00:53:04,157 --> 00:53:06,059
What were you
running from?

673
00:53:08,696 --> 00:53:10,498
It was snowing.

674
00:53:10,531 --> 00:53:11,666
In the summertime?

675
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,368
It brings the snow.

676
00:53:16,471 --> 00:53:17,672
What does?

677
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,110
The Demon Bear.

678
00:53:29,217 --> 00:53:30,384
Where are you?

679
00:53:30,418 --> 00:53:32,186
I'm right here, Dani.

680
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:36,757
What is this place?

681
00:53:40,361 --> 00:53:41,429
What are you doing?

682
00:53:41,462 --> 00:53:42,463
Dani?

683
00:53:45,131 --> 00:53:47,033
No! No! No!

684
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:26,474
Hello?

685
00:54:27,475 --> 00:54:30,278
Dani?
Who's there?

686
00:54:37,685 --> 00:54:39,220
You're not real.

687
00:54:40,254 --> 00:54:42,088
I killed you.

688
00:54:42,122 --> 00:54:46,427
And like Christ, I rise again.

689
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,195
Stay away from me!

690
00:54:50,231 --> 00:54:52,233
Lockheed, what's going on?

691
00:54:55,636 --> 00:54:57,371
It's her.

692
00:54:58,472 --> 00:55:00,474
Focus, Dani!

693
00:55:00,508 --> 00:55:01,709
Can you control it?

694
00:55:03,411 --> 00:55:05,413
Nobody can.

695
00:55:21,429 --> 00:55:22,463
No!

696
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,221
Stay back!

697
00:55:55,229 --> 00:55:56,330
Rahne!

698
00:56:00,635 --> 00:56:01,936
Oh, my God.

699
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:04,372
Is that real?
That's real.

700
00:56:04,405 --> 00:56:05,539
See, I told you.
This shit's real.

701
00:56:05,573 --> 00:56:07,173
What happened to her?

702
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:08,743
You happened.

703
00:56:10,478 --> 00:56:11,579
It's Dani.

704
00:56:13,514 --> 00:56:15,316
It's all Dani.

705
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:16,484
I didn't do anything.

706
00:56:16,517 --> 00:56:18,252
You brought
this evil here!

707
00:56:20,254 --> 00:56:22,757
I now know your power,
new girl.

708
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,429
Let me show you mine.

709
00:56:28,462 --> 00:56:29,597
Illyana, no powers!

710
00:56:41,742 --> 00:56:42,977
Don't!

711
00:56:51,452 --> 00:56:53,521
She's in our heads.

712
00:56:53,554 --> 00:56:55,389
She'll kill us all.

713
00:57:34,962 --> 00:57:38,499
Something's happening
to me, and I can't control it.

714
00:57:45,473 --> 00:57:47,308
That place you took me...

715
00:57:50,377 --> 00:57:51,579
Was it hell?

716
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:59,420
Limbo. It's a place
we made up.

717
00:57:59,987 --> 00:58:01,288
"We"?

718
00:58:02,056 --> 00:58:03,591
Me and Lockheed.

719
00:58:10,064 --> 00:58:11,966
I brought someone
for you.

720
00:58:30,518 --> 00:58:33,454
At first, it was just
our special place.

721
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:36,891
We went there
in our minds...

722
00:58:36,924 --> 00:58:39,493
whenever something bad
was about to happen.

723
00:58:43,664 --> 00:58:45,666
But we went there
so much...

724
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:49,937
stayed there so long...

725
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,074
it became real.

726
00:58:54,108 --> 00:58:55,142
I saw a memory.

727
00:58:59,013 --> 00:59:00,848
It wasn't mine.

728
00:59:05,653 --> 00:59:07,688
Who were they?

729
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:09,824
I never knew
their names.

730
00:59:09,857 --> 00:59:11,725
They were all the same.

731
00:59:15,663 --> 00:59:17,665
They made us cry.

732
00:59:23,804 --> 00:59:25,973
And it made them smile.

733
01:00:19,493 --> 01:00:20,694
How's the pain?

734
01:00:20,728 --> 01:00:22,429
Drugs are helping.

735
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,532
Was it really him?

736
01:00:25,566 --> 01:00:26,967
Preacher?

737
01:00:27,001 --> 01:00:29,670
If he wasn't real,
he could've fooled me.

738
01:00:34,209 --> 01:00:35,776
Why won't you come in?

739
01:00:38,746 --> 01:00:40,614
I'm not afraid of you.

740
01:00:44,785 --> 01:00:46,620
I'm afraid
of what I saw.

741
01:00:46,654 --> 01:00:47,922
Of him.

742
01:00:51,992 --> 01:00:54,195
But what if he only came
because of me?

743
01:00:57,498 --> 01:01:00,801
Even if you are the one
making these things happen...

744
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:05,072
you had no choice.

745
01:01:05,105 --> 01:01:06,941
It's not your fault.

746
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:12,947
I saw something when
Dr. Reyes was testing me.

747
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,516
I saw kids like us.

748
01:01:15,549 --> 01:01:18,719
Mutants, being forced
to do things.

749
01:01:21,189 --> 01:01:22,723
Horrible things.

750
01:01:27,962 --> 01:01:31,165
I don't
think this is a hospital.

751
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:33,834
The place that I saw,
I think that's where we go...

752
01:01:33,867 --> 01:01:35,703
when we leave.

753
01:01:37,071 --> 01:01:39,207
If we leave.

754
01:01:41,075 --> 01:01:42,676
I'm ready for you, Dani.

755
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:46,680
- Wait.
- I have to go.

756
01:01:47,614 --> 01:01:48,716
What if you're right?

757
01:01:48,749 --> 01:01:51,018
Are you just gonna let her
pump you full of drugs again?

758
01:01:51,051 --> 01:01:54,088
Last time,
I saw things, secrets.

759
01:01:55,756 --> 01:01:57,725
Maybe I will again.

760
01:01:57,758 --> 01:01:59,994
Maybe those secrets will help
us find a way out of here.

761
01:02:00,027 --> 01:02:01,528
How?

762
01:02:01,562 --> 01:02:03,063
I don't know yet.

763
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,101
But let's live a bit longer,
Rahne Sinclair.

764
01:02:24,018 --> 01:02:25,853
Dani wanted me
to stay with her.

765
01:02:25,886 --> 01:02:27,222
I need you to
wait outside, Rahne.

766
01:02:27,255 --> 01:02:28,256
I know, but...

767
01:02:28,289 --> 01:02:29,857
You can
come back for recovery.

768
01:02:38,866 --> 01:02:40,901
Doors. Hallway H.

769
01:03:07,661 --> 01:03:09,230
Hey.
What's up with you?

770
01:03:10,298 --> 01:03:11,732
Nothing.

771
01:03:13,901 --> 01:03:15,069
It's just...

772
01:03:16,136 --> 01:03:18,072
Well, Reyes was...

773
01:03:19,907 --> 01:03:21,675
Reyes was what?

774
01:03:24,812 --> 01:03:25,846
You guys hear that?

775
01:03:30,084 --> 01:03:31,652
Is that music?

776
01:03:37,825 --> 01:03:39,360
I know that song.

777
01:03:41,929 --> 01:03:42,930
Wait.

778
01:03:45,266 --> 01:03:47,668
What are we testing
this time?

779
01:03:48,436 --> 01:03:50,871
This is more a test of me.

780
01:03:54,108 --> 01:03:57,177
I told you
my mother was a vet, right?

781
01:03:57,212 --> 01:03:59,214
One day
our family dog went feral...

782
01:04:01,148 --> 01:04:03,050
mauled the neighbor's boy.

783
01:04:03,684 --> 01:04:04,952
Lift your head.

784
01:04:06,187 --> 01:04:07,188
Down.

785
01:04:10,757 --> 01:04:12,092
It was rabies.

786
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:16,964
It's coming
from my room.

787
01:04:21,469 --> 01:04:22,970
I'm going
to get Dr. Reyes.

788
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:26,874
Illyana, don't!

789
01:04:33,448 --> 01:04:36,384
What the hell
is this place?

790
01:04:37,985 --> 01:04:39,019
No.

791
01:04:40,255 --> 01:04:41,755
No, I buried this.

792
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:54,402
Stay away from her,
you pig!

793
01:04:57,938 --> 01:05:00,707
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

794
01:05:00,741 --> 01:05:02,109
Look. Look at me.

795
01:05:02,142 --> 01:05:04,077
Listen to me.
He cannot hurt you.

796
01:05:04,111 --> 01:05:05,846
No! Don't!

797
01:05:07,014 --> 01:05:09,783
Look, see? He's not real.
All right?

798
01:05:12,953 --> 01:05:14,021
Go! Run!

799
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,225
Run!

800
01:05:17,258 --> 01:05:19,427
My mother
tried everything.

801
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,296
It was too far along.

802
01:05:22,996 --> 01:05:24,798
I can't tell you
how hard it is...

803
01:05:24,831 --> 01:05:27,000
for a doctor
to face that, Dani.

804
01:05:30,804 --> 01:05:32,139
That powerlessness.

805
01:05:37,412 --> 01:05:40,047
You can do your best
to save a patient...

806
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,218
but sometimes
the most humane thing to do...

807
01:05:43,251 --> 01:05:45,085
is put it to sleep.

808
01:05:46,887 --> 01:05:48,289
Help!

809
01:05:48,956 --> 01:05:50,724
Help!

810
01:05:51,792 --> 01:05:53,328
Help!

811
01:05:57,164 --> 01:05:58,832
Help me!

812
01:06:03,571 --> 01:06:05,772
Help me!

813
01:06:10,411 --> 01:06:12,012
All right. It's okay.

814
01:06:13,548 --> 01:06:14,881
Oh, Jesus!

815
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:17,918
Get away! Stop!

816
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:21,788
Get off me! Let me go!

817
01:06:21,822 --> 01:06:23,224
No! Stop!

818
01:06:24,891 --> 01:06:27,127
Stop! Stop! Stop!

819
01:06:58,626 --> 01:07:00,295
You're
the most powerful mutant...

820
01:07:00,328 --> 01:07:01,928
we've ever had.

821
01:07:01,962 --> 01:07:05,533
But my superiors believe your
powers cannot be controlled.

822
01:07:07,468 --> 01:07:09,270
It's almost over, Dani.

823
01:07:36,264 --> 01:07:37,265
Dani?

824
01:07:42,503 --> 01:07:43,504
Dani?

825
01:07:45,473 --> 01:07:46,907
Dani, wake up.

826
01:07:56,417 --> 01:07:57,951
Hey, Dr. Reyes!

827
01:07:57,984 --> 01:07:59,554
Thank God.
You gotta help us!

828
01:08:00,488 --> 01:08:02,122
Hey!

829
01:08:02,155 --> 01:08:03,391
Dr. Reyes!

830
01:08:13,967 --> 01:08:16,069
I love you, Lockheed.
We're gonna die.

831
01:08:17,271 --> 01:08:18,972
Come on, Illyana.
You gotta do something.

832
01:08:19,005 --> 01:08:20,641
- I can't.
- Use your powers.

833
01:08:20,675 --> 01:08:22,142
I can't!

834
01:08:22,175 --> 01:08:24,479
Illyana, do something!

835
01:08:27,715 --> 01:08:29,650
Oh, seriously?

836
01:08:48,369 --> 01:08:50,571
Hey, Berto! Berto!

837
01:08:53,741 --> 01:08:55,710
Bitch put force fields
over all the exits.

838
01:08:55,743 --> 01:08:57,645
Is she trying
to kill us?

839
01:08:57,678 --> 01:08:59,146
Don't know. Did she make
those smiley things?

840
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,947
No. They're Illyana's.

841
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:02,082
Of course they are.

842
01:09:02,115 --> 01:09:03,384
Have you seen the girls?

843
01:09:03,418 --> 01:09:04,452
No.

844
01:09:04,485 --> 01:09:06,287
All right. Upstairs.

845
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,171
Where the hell
did you go?

846
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:28,609
Our special place.

847
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:32,480
That was so hot.

848
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:49,397
What the hell's going on?
Where's Dr. Reyes?

849
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:50,765
She tried
to kill Dani.

850
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:52,032
What?

851
01:09:52,065 --> 01:09:54,268
That test?
It wasn't a test.

852
01:09:54,302 --> 01:09:56,270
She tried to kill her.

853
01:09:56,304 --> 01:09:57,605
My file.

854
01:09:59,105 --> 01:10:01,776
"Patient reviles authority.

855

Essex Corporation.

862
01:10:26,767 --> 01:10:28,703
That must have been
the place I saw.

863
01:10:28,736 --> 01:10:31,305
She wasn't
prepping us to be X-Men.

864
01:10:31,339 --> 01:10:32,773
She was prepping us
to be killers.

865
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:35,643
We don't have much time.

866
01:10:35,676 --> 01:10:37,445
Reyes wants me dead.
And it won't be long...

867
01:10:37,478 --> 01:10:39,447
before she comes back
to finish the job.

868
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,617
How? This place is designed
to keep us inside.

869
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:45,051
All our powers, it won't work.
It's hopeless.

870
01:10:45,085 --> 01:10:47,321
No. It isn't.

871
01:10:47,355 --> 01:10:49,724
We got each other
out of our cages.

872
01:10:51,459 --> 01:10:52,693
We can get out of this.

873
01:10:52,727 --> 01:10:54,428
That's all
well and good.

874
01:10:54,462 --> 01:10:55,730
But she's still got
force fields...

875
01:10:55,763 --> 01:10:57,163
around the building.

876
01:10:57,832 --> 01:11:01,235
The windows, everything.

877
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:04,104
How you gonna
get past that?

878
01:11:05,339 --> 01:11:07,308
By taking out the source.

879
01:11:10,143 --> 01:11:12,145
Then let's kill the bitch.

880
01:11:20,555 --> 01:11:21,556
<i>Tonight...</i>

881
01:11:21,589 --> 01:11:24,759
<i>I'd like to talk
about responsibility.</i>

882
01:11:25,993 --> 01:11:29,664
<i>You have a responsibility
to your treatment.</i>

883
01:11:29,697 --> 01:11:32,400
<i>I want all of you to go
to your rooms right now.</i>

884
01:11:32,433 --> 01:11:36,804
<i>If you disobey,
or if you try to leave this facility...</i>

885
01:11:36,837 --> 01:11:39,473
<i>I have a responsibility
to stop you.</i>

886
01:11:40,441 --> 01:11:42,443
<i>No matter what it takes.</i>

887
01:11:45,913 --> 01:11:48,249
How do you know
she's still in here?

888
01:11:48,749 --> 01:11:50,618
I'm a good smeller.

889
01:11:50,651 --> 01:11:52,653
<i>You're a good killer.</i>

890
01:11:52,687 --> 01:11:54,221
What's going on?

891
01:11:55,356 --> 01:11:57,358
What's Essex Corp?

892
01:12:05,766 --> 01:12:10,605
It's a scientific organization
founded by my superiors.

893
01:12:10,638 --> 01:12:13,808
Founded to do what?
Screw with our heads?

894
01:12:13,841 --> 01:12:14,842
To save you!

895
01:12:17,778 --> 01:12:19,313
If it wasn't for me...

896
01:12:19,347 --> 01:12:21,682
you all would've been dead
a long time ago!

897
01:12:23,317 --> 01:12:24,719
It's okay. Hey.

898
01:12:25,886 --> 01:12:27,254
Calm down.

899
01:12:27,288 --> 01:12:28,289
Like I said...

900
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:31,258
I want all of you
to calm down.

901
01:12:32,393 --> 01:12:35,796
All right?
Promise to do that.

902
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:37,531
And I'll let you go.

903
01:12:38,299 --> 01:12:39,634
Except Dani.

904
01:12:40,701 --> 01:12:42,837
Dani needs to be put down.

905
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:45,439
- No!
- Let us out! Let us out!

906
01:12:45,473 --> 01:12:46,507
It's okay.

907
01:12:47,408 --> 01:12:48,542
It's for her own good.

908
01:12:50,478 --> 01:12:52,178
And yours.

909
01:12:53,848 --> 01:12:56,417
I'm sure you've figured out
her power by now.

910
01:12:56,817 --> 01:12:58,486
So special.

911
01:13:01,956 --> 01:13:04,425
She takes
your greatest fear...

912
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:06,494
your darkest secret...

913
01:13:07,561 --> 01:13:09,497
and makes you
live through it.

914
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:10,798
No!

915
01:13:10,831 --> 01:13:13,367
Over and over.

916
01:13:14,835 --> 01:13:17,972
Over and over.

917
01:13:18,005 --> 01:13:19,240
Until it kills you.

918
01:13:22,576 --> 01:13:24,245
That's it.

919
01:13:24,278 --> 01:13:25,846
That's it. Breathe.

920
01:13:31,686 --> 01:13:32,887
That's it.

921
01:13:38,392 --> 01:13:41,362
You're about to see
your father again.

922
01:13:41,395 --> 01:13:43,330
In the spirit world.

923
01:14:05,519 --> 01:14:06,787
What are you doing, Dani?

924
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:28,943
Dani.

925
01:14:28,976 --> 01:14:30,745
Guys, she won't wake up.

926
01:14:30,778 --> 01:14:31,979
Help me.

927
01:14:32,012 --> 01:14:33,514
- Hey! Wake up!
- Dani!

928
01:14:34,849 --> 01:14:37,485
<i>Dani! Guys! Dani.</i>

929
01:14:40,554 --> 01:14:41,689
<i>It's coming back!</i>

930
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:51,699
It's hunting us.

931
01:14:51,732 --> 01:14:53,834
No. It's hunting Dani.

932
01:14:54,435 --> 01:14:55,736
Why Dani?

933
01:14:56,737 --> 01:14:59,073
Because that's what
she fears.

934
01:14:59,106 --> 01:15:01,509
Come on. Help me.

935
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:04,078
All right.
One, two, three.

936
01:15:13,954 --> 01:15:16,090
Take Dani
to a safe place...

937
01:15:16,123 --> 01:15:17,725
and I'll take care
of this bear.

938
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,701
What are you going to do?

939
01:15:27,735 --> 01:15:29,670
I'm going to
play with it.

940
01:15:30,871 --> 01:15:32,573
Get her out of here.

941
01:15:42,516 --> 01:15:44,885
Are you crazy?
That thing'll kill you!

942
01:15:44,919 --> 01:15:46,654
He's right.
It's magic.

943
01:15:49,857 --> 01:15:51,625
So am I.

944
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:52,660
No! Illy!

945
01:15:59,767 --> 01:16:01,569
Hey, Yogi!

946
01:16:03,904 --> 01:16:07,041
Lions and tigers
and bears. Oh, my.

947
01:16:08,175 --> 01:16:10,544
Right, Lockheed?

948
01:16:26,961 --> 01:16:27,995
Holy shit!

949
01:16:28,028 --> 01:16:29,563
I'm gonna
marry that girl.

950
01:16:30,731 --> 01:16:32,132
You okay, Lockheed?

951
01:16:38,505 --> 01:16:40,708
Come on!
Let's go. Let's go.

952
01:16:40,741 --> 01:16:43,010
Berto, you have to run
with her.

953
01:16:43,043 --> 01:16:44,411
I can't. I'm not ready.

954
01:16:44,445 --> 01:16:45,980
You won't hurt her.
You can do this.

955
01:16:48,682 --> 01:16:49,750
Come on! This way.

956
01:17:03,097 --> 01:17:05,799
You guys go.
I'm going back for Illy.

957
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:06,967
Sam!

958
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,138
Gotta get better someday.

959
01:17:12,139 --> 01:17:13,507
Give her to me.

960
01:17:14,074 --> 01:17:15,175
Hide.

961
01:17:17,144 --> 01:17:19,947
Demons can't come in churches.
Demons can't come in churches.

962
01:17:24,652 --> 01:17:28,455
Dani, I really need you
to wake up.

963
01:17:28,489 --> 01:17:30,225
Come back,
you coward!

964
01:17:30,258 --> 01:17:31,792
<i>Hail Mary,
full of grace...</i>

965
01:17:31,825 --> 01:17:33,661
<i>blessed art thou
amongst women.</i>

966
01:17:33,694 --> 01:17:35,863
Pray for us sinners now
and in the hour of our death.

967
01:17:35,896 --> 01:17:37,831
Amen.

968
01:17:45,873 --> 01:17:47,608
Aah! No!

969
01:18:16,804 --> 01:18:17,905
Ahh!

970
01:18:32,619 --> 01:18:33,821
Demon Bear!

971
01:18:36,056 --> 01:18:38,226
Nowhere to run now.

972
01:18:40,995 --> 01:18:42,563
I know you're in there.

973
01:18:43,931 --> 01:18:46,967
Please. You're not alone.
I'm here.

974
01:18:47,001 --> 01:18:48,535
We're all here...

975
01:18:48,569 --> 01:18:50,571
<i>fighting for you.</i>

976
01:18:50,604 --> 01:18:52,072
Rahne, where are you?

977
01:18:54,641 --> 01:18:55,809
Rahne!

978
01:18:57,077 --> 01:19:00,014
Dani, I know
you can hear me in there.

979
01:19:02,049 --> 01:19:03,550
What are you doing?

980
01:19:03,584 --> 01:19:05,152
I'm hiding, the same thing
you're doing.

981
01:19:15,996 --> 01:19:17,031
Watch out!

982
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,208
Lockheed!

983
01:19:33,814 --> 01:19:34,915
Berto!

984
01:19:34,948 --> 01:19:36,284
Nut up!

985
01:20:04,111 --> 01:20:05,112
Rahne!

986
01:20:11,919 --> 01:20:13,254
<i>You have to wake up...</i>

987
01:20:13,288 --> 01:20:15,856
or we're all going to die.

988
01:20:20,994 --> 01:20:22,029
Berto!

989
01:20:25,266 --> 01:20:27,134
No! Berto!

990
01:20:29,703 --> 01:20:31,638
Only you can stop this.

991
01:20:36,311 --> 01:20:37,811
I can't.

992
01:20:59,933 --> 01:21:00,934
Dani!

993
01:21:10,177 --> 01:21:11,279
Dad!

994
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,748
I'm so sorry.

995
01:21:17,485 --> 01:21:19,786
It wasn't your fault.

996
01:21:21,155 --> 01:21:23,458
But now you need
to wake up.

997
01:21:23,491 --> 01:21:26,394
But the bear,
it's too big.

998
01:21:28,028 --> 01:21:29,796
You're bigger.

999
01:21:40,908 --> 01:21:42,443
<i>Dani!</i>

1000
01:21:44,778 --> 01:21:46,980
No! Dani! Help!

1001
01:21:49,883 --> 01:21:51,051
<i>Dani!</i>

1002
01:21:54,755 --> 01:21:55,756
No!

1003
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,326
Dani!

1004
01:21:59,026 --> 01:22:00,727
Stop.

1005
01:22:13,341 --> 01:22:15,042
No.

1006
01:22:23,116 --> 01:22:24,151
No.

1007
01:22:26,354 --> 01:22:28,289
I'm in charge now.

1008
01:22:30,157 --> 01:22:31,526
Control.

1009
01:22:41,336 --> 01:22:42,403
Good.

1010
01:23:18,005 --> 01:23:20,241
Everything is gonna be okay.

1011
01:23:24,379 --> 01:23:26,980
You don't have to worry
about anything anymore.

1012
01:23:31,051 --> 01:23:33,820
But it's time
to go to sleep now.

1013
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:18,259
Thank you.

1014
01:25:18,292 --> 01:25:19,627
Thanks, all of you.

1015
01:25:21,229 --> 01:25:22,630
For saving me.

1016
01:25:23,664 --> 01:25:24,665
Are you kidding?

1017
01:25:27,502 --> 01:25:29,002
You saved us.

1018
01:25:47,053 --> 01:25:50,991
Hey, guys. The dome's gone.

1019
01:25:51,459 --> 01:25:53,494
So we're free?

1020
01:25:53,528 --> 01:25:54,995
Reyes always said
the nearest town...

1021
01:25:55,028 --> 01:25:56,464
is 20 miles away.

1022
01:25:57,532 --> 01:25:59,200
She could be lying.

1023
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,672
Shall we find out?

1024
01:26:16,217 --> 01:26:17,618
<i>My father
used to tell me that...</i>

1025
01:26:17,652 --> 01:26:20,354
<i>inside every person,
there are two bears.</i>

1026
01:26:22,423 --> 01:26:24,492
<i>One bear is all things good.</i>

1027
01:26:24,525 --> 01:26:28,396
<i>Compassion, love, trust.</i>

1028
01:26:28,429 --> 01:26:30,997
<i>The other is all things evil.</i>

1029
01:26:31,031 --> 01:26:35,001
<i>Fear, shame,
and self-destruction.</i>

1030
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:38,439
<i>I asked him, "Which one wins?"</i>

1031
01:26:39,774 --> 01:26:43,311
<i>He answered,
"The one you feed."</i>
