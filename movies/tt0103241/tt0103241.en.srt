2
00:01:22,717 --> 00:01:24,756
I feel good. I feel great.

3
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:26,713
I feel wonderful.

4
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:29,931
I feel good.
I feel great. I feel wonderful.

5
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:33,182
I feel good. I feel great.

6
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:35,351
I feel wonderful.

7
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:37,439
I feel good. I feel great.

8
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:39,357
I feel wonderful.

9
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,833
Good morning, Gil.

10
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:59,081
I said, good morning, Gil.

11
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:03,631
I got to go to work. See you.

12
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:27,530
Wish me luck, Gil.

13
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:54,103
(sirens, shouting and traffic noise)

14
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,708
Doctor, it's your wife on the phone.

15
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:18,877
Thank you, Claire.

16
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,417
Fay? Are we sitting down?

17
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:27,762
My publisher thinks
it's going to happen.

18
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:32,223
Yeah, he thinks <i>Good Morning, America</i>
is coming up to Lake Winnipesaukee

19
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:34,810
to interview me.

20
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,431
It's a tremendous shot in the arm
for my book.

21
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,400
No, it's very unusual.

22
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:42,771
I think they did visit
Dr. Ruth's house once, but...

23
00:03:42,907 --> 00:03:44,947
(buzzer)

24
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:46,487
Hold on a second, honey.

25
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:51,032
- Yes?
- Dr. Carswell Fensterwald on the phone.

26
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,037
Thank you. Fay, I have to go, there's
another colleague on the phone.

27
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,337
Boy, they sure do come out of the
woodwork when you're famous.

28
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:01,958
Goodbye, dear.

29
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:03,885
- Carswell!
- Leo!

30
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:06,052
Long time, no see, huh?

31
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:08,470
You got a big book out.

32
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:10,309
Things are really clicking, huh?

33
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:13,888
- That's the way I planned it.
<i>Listen, Leo.</i>

34
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:18,816
I'm quitting my practice for a while.
I'm leaving town.

35
00:04:18,945 --> 00:04:22,314
And I have one patient
I'd like to refer to you.

36
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:25,281
Exactly what kind of a case is it,
Carswell?

37
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,952
He's not psychotic, is he?

38
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,914
No, no, nothing like that. No. Listen.

39
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,667
His name is Bob Wiley.
He pays early. He comes on time.

40
00:04:34,795 --> 00:04:37,832
And uh... He just needs
someone brilliant, Leo.

41
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:40,752
<i>I know that you don't like flattery,</i>

42
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:44,468
<i>but if there's anyone I know
who could win the Nobel Prize, it's you.</i>

43
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,930
Well, I suppose I could find an hour
for him some time after Labor Day.

44
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:54,600
OK, I'll work him in for an interview.

45
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,899
<i>How come you're quitting the business?</i>

46
00:04:57,027 --> 00:04:59,067
We're a dying breed, Leo. Good luck.

47
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:04,899
Free!

48
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:10,243
Claire, if a Bob Wiley calls,
schedule him for a short interview

49
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:11,999
after I get back from my vacation.

50
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:15,709
<i>He's already called, Dr. Marvin. Twice.
He's your next appointment.</i>

51
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,709
That's persistence.

52
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:24,719
I feel good. I feel great.
I feel wonderful.

53
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:27,553
- Son of a bitch! Dirty bastard!
- ..feel wonderful.

54
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:31,303
I feel good. I feel great.
I feel wonderful.

55
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:32,886
I feel good!

56
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:49,036
Can I help you, sir?

57
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:52,535
Yes. Dr. Marvin? Dr. Leo Marvin?

58
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:54,709
Second elevator. 44th floor.

59
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:57,329
Thank you. Elevator?

60
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:35,836
(panting and gasping)

61
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:55,940
Bob... Wi...

62
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,564
Bob Wiley?

63
00:06:57,696 --> 00:06:59,570
Yes.

64
00:06:59,698 --> 00:07:03,743
Erm... Why don't you sit down?
It'll be a few minutes.

65
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:19,215
Dr. Marvin, Bob Wiley.

66
00:07:21,138 --> 00:07:23,344
Thank you.

67
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:25,597
- Thank you for working me in.
- Hello.

68
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:29,017
Should I call you Dr. Marvin or Leo?

69
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,309
Whichever you like.

70
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,480
- Call me Bob.
- Bob.

71
00:07:34,318 --> 00:07:35,943
- Is that your family?
- Yes.

72
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,110
Let me guess. I'm very good at this.

73
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:40,946
Uh... That's Harriet.

74
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:43,866
And then Ronnie, Gretchen...

75
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:46,955
..and Rita.

76
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,290
Ah, wait a second. Uh... Cecilia,

77
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,128
Dorothy.

78
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:57,082
And this is Kenneth, and...

79
00:07:58,302 --> 00:07:59,298
Bambi.

80
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:04,094
This is my son, Sigmund, and my wife,
Fay, and my daughter, Anna.

81
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:05,636
That's my sister, Lily.

82
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:07,808
Lily? I was close.

83
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:13,146
- It's a beautiful family.
- Thank you. Have a seat.

84
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:31,499
Why don't I start?

85
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:36,213
The simplest way to put it...

86
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:39,301
I have problems.

87
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:47,723
I worry about diseases,
so I have trouble touching things.

88
00:08:47,855 --> 00:08:51,473
In public places,
it's almost impossible.

89
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:55,894
I have a real big problem moving.

90
00:08:57,073 --> 00:08:59,112
Talk about moving.

91
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:04,111
As long as I'm in my apartment, I'm OK.

92
00:09:05,206 --> 00:09:10,201
But when I want to go out,
I get... weird.

93
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:13,162
Talk about weird.

94
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:15,125
Talk about weird?

95
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:18,544
Well, I get... dizzy spells.

96
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,551
Nausea. Cold sweats.

97
00:09:24,936 --> 00:09:25,967
Hot sweats.

98
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:29,520
Fever blisters. Difficulty breathing.
Difficulty swallowing.

99
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:33,226
Blurred vision. lnvoluntary trembling.

100
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:35,274
Dead hands.

101
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:39,154
Numb lips, fingernail sensitivity.

102
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:42,700
Pelvic discomfort.

103
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:47,372
So the real question is,
what is the crisis, Bob?

104
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:51,416
What is it that you are truly afraid of?

105
00:09:51,964 --> 00:09:54,004
What if my heart stops beating?

106
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:59,592
What if I'm looking for a bathroom,
I can't find it, and...

107
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:02,719
my bladder explodes?

108
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:07,387
Have you ever heard of
Tourette's Syndrome?

109
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:11,567
Involuntarily shouting profanity.

110
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:13,401
It's exceptionally rare.

111
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,818
Shit-eating son of a bitch!

112
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,404
Bastard! Douche bag! Twat!

113
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,907
Numb-nut! Dickhead!

114
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,033
Bitch!

115
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,203
Why exactly are you doing this?

116
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,874
If I fake it, then I don't have it.

117
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,961
You know, it's the same
with the cardiac arrest.

118
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,102
Are you married?

119
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,268
I'm divorced.

120
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,310
Would you like to talk about that?

121
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:55,354
There are two types of people
in this world.

122
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,028
Those who like Neil Diamond
and those who don't.

123
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:00,869
My ex-wife loves him.

124
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:05,864
I see. So, what you are saying is that,

125
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:11,244
even though you are an almost paralysed
multiphobic personality,

126
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:13,588
that is in a constant state of panic,

127
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:18,380
your wife did not leave you. You left
her because she liked Neil Diamond.

128
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:22,848
No. You're saying that maybe...

129
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:27,017
maybe I didn't leave her
because she likes Neil Diamond,

130
00:11:27,148 --> 00:11:29,853
but maybe... maybe she left me?

131
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,646
Yes.

132
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:36,230
Ow. Ow! Ow! Ow!

133
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:38,107
Ow!

134
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,080
Dr. Marvin,

135
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:47,919
you can help me.

136
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:50,833
For the first time in my life,
I feel like there's hope.

137
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:56,508
I feel like I can be somebody.

138
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:01,933
Bob, there's an old saying.

139
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:08,473
The best psychiatrist in the world
is the one right inside of you.

140
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:10,269
Yeah.

141
00:12:10,402 --> 00:12:12,442
- I can help you, yes.
- Thank you.

142
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:19,028
Bob, there is a ground-breaking
new book,

143
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:21,201
that has just come out. Ah!

144
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:27,325
Now, not everything in this book,
of course, applies to you,

145
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:30,416
but I'm sure that you can see,
when you see the title,

146
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,965
exactly how it could help.

147
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:36,920
<i>Baby Steps?</i>

148
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:42,395
It means setting small, reasonable
goals for yourself. One day at a time.

149
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,307
One tiny step at a time.

150
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,769
Baby steps!

151
00:12:49,694 --> 00:12:52,481
For instance,
when you leave this office,

152
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:57,658
don't think about everything you have
to do to get out of the building.

153
00:12:57,786 --> 00:13:01,036
Just thing of what you must do
to get out of this room.

154
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:07,203
And when you get to the hall, deal with
that hall, and so forth. You see?

155
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:09,995
Baby steps.

156
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:12,880
- Baby steps.
- Oh, boy!

157
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,095
Baby steps. Baby steps!

158
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,681
Baby steps through the office.

159
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:23,642
Baby steps out the door.

160
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,525
It works.

161
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:31,313
It works.

162
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:38,203
All I have to do
is take one little step at a time,

163
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:40,994
and I can do anything.

164
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,286
Baby step around the office.
Baby step around the office!

165
00:13:46,295 --> 00:13:49,213
That should give you a lot to digest
while I'm on vacation.

166
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:52,583
Va...? Vacation?

167
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:55,801
Oh, certainly. My secretary told you.

168
00:13:56,765 --> 00:14:00,264
As of this afternoon, I'm taking my
family on vacation until Labor Day.

169
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:05,729
That's a month.

170
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:08,598
What if I need you?
What if I need to talk?

171
00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:11,274
My associate, Dr. Harmon,
would be happy to talk.

172
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:13,445
And, Bob, I'll be back.

173
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:15,736
Just read <i>Baby Steps.</i>

174
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:19,238
Baby steps... out of the office.

175
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:21,164
Very good.

176
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,747
Baby steps to the hall.

177
00:14:23,877 --> 00:14:25,455
Very good, Bob. Keep going.

178
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:29,166
That's it. Bye.

179
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:32,300
- I'll see you in a month.
- Baby steps to the elevator.

180
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:34,586
Baby steps to the elevator.

181
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:40,842
July 31 st.
Bob Wiley, introductory interview.

182
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:46,604
Multiphobic personality, characterised
by acute separation anxiety,

183
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:49,439
and extreme need for family connections.

184
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,193
Bill the usual rate for the interview
and $29.95 for the book.

185
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:57,574
(knock on door)

186
00:14:58,455 --> 00:14:59,570
It's your publisher.

187
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:03,123
<i>Good Morning, America</i> is definitely
coming to Lake Winnipesaukee!

188
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:04,794
Yes!

189
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,333
Thank you.

190
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:09,504
Baby steps to the elevator.

191
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,385
Baby step onto the elevator.

192
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,935
Baby steps into the elevator.

193
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,103
I'm in the elevator.

194
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:30,192
Bob: A-a-a-a-a-a-r-g-h!

195
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:31,728
<i>♪♪  The Brady Bunch theme  ♪♪</i>

197
00:15:35,786 --> 00:15:39,238

198
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,413
(theme music continues)

199
00:15:43,294 --> 00:15:45,536
Mid-Manhattan exchange.

200
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:49,041
Yes, this is Bob Wiley.
I'm a patient of Dr. Marvin's.

201
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,548
I have to speak with him right away.
It's urgent.

202
00:15:51,678 --> 00:15:53,718
I'm sorry, Mr. Wiley, but...

203
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:55,804
It's Bob. And you are...?

204
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:57,972
- Betty.
- Betty. Hi.

205
00:15:58,102 --> 00:16:02,147
Bob, Dr. Marvin's out of town
and Dr. Harmon's taking his calls.

206
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:07,358
I know that, Betty. It's just that
there's been some confusion.

207
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:11,022
I was supposed to call Dr. Marvin,
but I've lost his phone number.

208
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,570
Bob, I can't give out that number.

209
00:16:15,287 --> 00:16:19,035
I know that, Betty. But you could
call him on the other line,

210
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,749
and tell him that I'm on hold
on the other line, couldn't you, please?

211
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:24,918
Thanks, Betty. Please.

212
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:29,667
Siggy, put that
in front of that other chair.

213
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:31,842
(phone rings)

214
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:42,188
Phone, Daddy.

215
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:44,355
Thank you, Anna.

216
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:47,024
Thank you, sweetheart.

217
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:49,527
- Yes?
- Dr. Marvin?

218
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:51,530
This is Betty at your exchange.

219
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:54,576
I'm sorry to disturb you
but I have a Bob Wiley on the line,

220
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:56,862
who says you'll want to talk to him.

221
00:16:56,997 --> 00:17:00,283
Betty, you know better than that.
Dr. Harmon is covering for me.

222
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:04,202
I told him that, but he said he lost
your number and that it was urgent.

223
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:07,338
All right, put him through.

224
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,009
Go ahead, Bob.

225
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:11,591
This is Dr. Marvin.
What's the problem, Bob?

226
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:13,963
Dr. Marvin, how's the weather up there?

227
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:16,846
What?

228
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:19,682
How's your brood? You all
getting a chance to relax?

229
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:25,020
Bob, I thought I made it clear to you
that I'm on vacation.

230
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:29,402
I know, but I'm just worse
than usual this time. Really bad.

231
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:33,067
Bob, if this is really an emergency,
go to the Emergency Room.

232
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,907
And if it isn't, call Dr. Harmon.
I'm sure he can help you.

233
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,040
Well, I'd just feel so much better
if I knew where you were.

234
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,210
It's Martha's Vineyard, right?

235
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:43,827
- Bob!
- Well, can't we just talk?

236
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:46,799
Yes, we can.
In my office, after Labor Day.

237
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:48,633
After you're back from Fire lsland, huh?

238
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,255
Goodbye, Bob.

239
00:17:50,387 --> 00:17:52,759
What, you want to keep Maine
all to yourself?

240
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,929
Goodbye, Bob.

241
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,558
Is this a fake hang-up?

242
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:02,145
It's a fake hang-up.

243
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:04,935
(phone rings)

244
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:07,109
I'll get the phone, I'll get the phone.

245
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,617
- Hello.
- Doctor, it's Betty again.

246
00:18:16,748 --> 00:18:19,121
I have an urgent call from your sister.

247
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:21,291
My sister? Put her through.

248
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:23,835
Betty: Go ahead.

249
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:30,092
It's not you. It's me.

250
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:34,555
Lily? What's wrong?

251
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:37,634
Dr. Marvin, please don't be angry.
This is Bob.

252
00:18:38,313 --> 00:18:39,688
I know I shouldn't be calling.

253
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,602
Bob, the doctor-patient relationship
is based on trust.

254
00:18:42,734 --> 00:18:45,439
When you call me and pretend
to be my sister, I can't trust you.

255
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:48,240
Go to the Emergency Room.
Do not call me here again.

256
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,946
Oh, no, no, no! That was not smart.

257
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:57,916
That was not smart!

258
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:02,793
(banging on door)

259
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:05,291
Who is it?

260
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:09,257
Detective Roberts from Homicide. I have
some questions about a Bob Wiley.

261
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:13,930
What? That was the Bob
who kept calling Dr. Marvin.

262
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:18,643
That <i>was</i> that Bob who kept calling.

263
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:24,192
Unfortunately, Bob committed suicide
about 15 minutes ago.

264
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,778
Oh, my God!

265
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,566
That's terrible.

266
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,484
Very sad. It should never have
happened. He was a very sweet guy.

267
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,740
But he did leave a note, however.
He mentioned the name Betty.

268
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,701
- She's Betty.
- I'm Betty.

269
00:19:38,502 --> 00:19:40,541
Oh, so you're Betty.

270
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:44,756
Bob called here,
trying to reach his psychiatrist.

271
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,835
Oh, well, where is he? I'll have
to ask him some questions, too.

272
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:52,719
Dr. Marvin's on vacation
in New Hampshire.

273
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,594
New Hampshire?

274
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,767
I can get him on the phone for you.

275
00:19:57,772 --> 00:19:59,812
Good. No, don't.

276
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:04,233
If I really need to, I can get somebody
from NHPD to drop by in on him.

277
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:09,569
But, what if I wanted
to write him a letter?

278
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:12,027
Would you have
a mailing address of some kind?

279
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:14,202
Oh, sure.

280
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:17,950
- That's PO Box 14,
- Yes.

281
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:20,125
Lake Winnipesaukee.

282
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:23,794
Which is spelled...?

283
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,964
W-i-n-n-i-

284
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:29,468
(all speak at once)

285
00:20:30,974 --> 00:20:33,013
- Two N's
- That's two E's.

286
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:36,888
Two N's, two E's.
Thank you very much, ladies.

287
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:39,347
I'm crazy about you,
especially you, Betty.

288
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:46,152
(phone rings)

289
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:52,242
It better not be who I think it is.

290
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:57,289
Hello.

291
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:00,876
What?

292
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,209
All right. Thank you for calling, Betty.

293
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:11,805
That was the service.

294
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:14,677
That patient, the one who called before,

295
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:17,561
he committed suicide.

296
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,730
Oh, Leo, how horrible.

297
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:23,894
Oh, well, best not let it
spoil our vacation.

298
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,240
Baby steps, get on a bus.

299
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:31,909
Baby steps, get on a bus.

300
00:21:41,215 --> 00:21:43,254
Baby steps, board the...

301
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:47,050
This is the last bus to Winnipesaukee,
Bob.

302
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:48,425
Yes, I know, Wing. Thank you.

303
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:51,592
Baby steps, board the bus.
Baby steps, board the bus.

304
00:21:53,853 --> 00:21:55,645
Do you think you can do it today, Bob?

305
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,812
We have a baby schedule to keep.

306
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,990
Baby steps, board the bus.

307
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,825
Baby step down the aisle.
Baby step down the aisle.

308
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,835
Baby step. And sit in the seat.

309
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:24,383
Hello. I'm Bob. Would you knock me out,
please? Just hit me in the face.

310
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,057
Do we have enough to feed
the entire crew?

311
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:39,978
Honey, we have enough
to feed the entire network.

312
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,649
Great! Another vacation
that's not a vacation.

313
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,814
Why do I have to dress up
for this stupid show?

314
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,655
What do you mean? You've already
tried on everything you own.

315
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:52,452
- I have not!
- All right, all right, gosh!

316
00:22:55,335 --> 00:22:57,577
It's probably gonna be
a short interview anyway.

317
00:22:57,712 --> 00:23:00,120
Just me and the family and my book.

318
00:23:06,722 --> 00:23:08,928
Easy, fella. We're almost there.

319
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:12,641
(violent retching)

320
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:19,268
False alarm.

321
00:23:35,794 --> 00:23:37,834
(cheering)

322
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:51,427
Dr. Marvin!

323
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,601
Dr. Leo Marvin!

324
00:23:54,397 --> 00:23:56,437
Doctor... Marvin!

325
00:23:57,776 --> 00:23:59,650
Dr. Leo Marvin.

326
00:23:59,778 --> 00:24:01,107
- Thank you.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

327
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:05,188
- Thanks again.
- Doctor...Leo...Marvin!

328
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:07,365
Honey, is someone calling you?

329
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:09,534
- Doctor!
- Right over there.

330
00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:11,991
Dr. Leo Marvin!

331
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,204
Oh, my God!

332
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:15,374
Doctor...

333
00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:17,496
Leo...

334
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,667
- Leo, do you know that man?
- Get in the car. Come on, hurry.

335
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,211
Hurry, hurry.

336
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:24,171
Dr. Marvin!

337
00:24:24,304 --> 00:24:26,842
Oh, I really appreciate this.

338
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:28,468
Everyone in the car.

339
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:32,267
Dr. Marvin!

340
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:35,474
Is this a bad time?

341
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,275
Oh, the fam!

342
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,162
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

343
00:24:58,215 --> 00:25:00,172
What are you doing here?

344
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:02,589
I thought you were dead.

345
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,848
Oh, no, they told you. Well, I fibbed
a little bit, but don't be mad.

346
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:10,094
Bob, your behaviour
is completely inappropriate.

347
00:25:10,978 --> 00:25:13,185
- You're angry.
- No, no, I don't get angry.

348
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:16,096
- Well, you're upset.
- I don't get upset.

349
00:25:16,234 --> 00:25:20,943
- Well, then, let's have a little talk.
- I do not see patients on vacation.

350
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:23,440
Ever!
How many ways can I make that clear?

351
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:27,158
Now, what I'd like you to do is to get
on this bus and go back to New York.

352
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:29,743
I can't. I'm totally paralysed.
I'm all locked up.

353
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:32,828
- You got yourself here.
- Barely!

354
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,917
Well, getting back will be therapeutic.

355
00:25:35,046 --> 00:25:38,000
- Can't we just have a little talk?
- You are testing my patience.

356
00:25:38,132 --> 00:25:40,670
Come on, I've come so far.
I'm baby stepping.

357
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:43,719
I'm doing the work. I'm baby stepping.
I'm not a slacker.

358
00:25:43,847 --> 00:25:48,058
Check it out, I'm in really bad shape.
Come on, please, please!

359
00:25:48,185 --> 00:25:50,177
- Bob! Bob!
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!

360
00:25:50,312 --> 00:25:53,266
I need! I need! I need! I need! Gimme!

361
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:55,391
OK, OK, all right, all right, all right!

362
00:25:57,778 --> 00:26:01,646
All right. It's two o'clock. Go to the
bus station and buy a ticket home.

363
00:26:01,782 --> 00:26:04,024
And then wait for me
in that coffee shop.

364
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,110
- You'll meet me?
- I'll call you. In two hours.

365
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,831
Oh, my God, you're the greatest.

366
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:16,297
You have to promise me that
you will buy your ticket and go home.

367
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:18,581
Absolutely.
I'm going to do it right now.

368
00:26:18,717 --> 00:26:21,504
All right.
I'll call you at four o'clock.

369
00:26:24,264 --> 00:26:25,972
You couldn't possibly make it 3:30?

370
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,049
Bob!

371
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:30,933
Four! Four, OK. Exactly four o'clock.
It's better.

372
00:26:32,231 --> 00:26:34,271
Thank you, Dr. M!

373
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,440
Baby step to four o'clock.

374
00:26:38,071 --> 00:26:40,110
Baby step to four o'clock.

375
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:43,823
Baby step to four o'clock.

376
00:26:45,078 --> 00:26:47,118
Baby step to four o'clock.

377
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,710
Baby step to four o'clock.

378
00:26:55,923 --> 00:26:57,963
Oh, my gosh. I need a bowl.

379
00:26:58,843 --> 00:27:01,797
- What?
- He's been locked in for eight hours.

380
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:04,052
He's about to scream. He's furious.

381
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:06,847
Sorry, Gil.

382
00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:09,598
Sorry, Gil.
A little negligence on my part.

383
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,188
There you go. Hang tight, fella.

384
00:27:12,023 --> 00:27:14,016
Geronimo!

385
00:27:14,151 --> 00:27:15,479
It was a long ride, wasn't it?

386
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,069
You needed a stretch.

387
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:20,612
Hey, no, no, no!
I'm expecting a phone call.

388
00:27:21,075 --> 00:27:24,989
Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thanks,
everybody, I really appreciate it.

389
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:30,700
Also, if I lose consciousness
or black out,

390
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:32,875
or something explodes,

391
00:27:33,004 --> 00:27:34,961
would you tell Dr. Marvin
that I was here?

392
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:36,714
Dr. Leo Marvin?

393
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:38,501
Do you know him?

394
00:27:38,635 --> 00:27:42,170
Yeah. He bought our dream house.

395
00:27:42,305 --> 00:27:44,631
We worked a lifetime
to save for a down-payment.

396
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:49,013
And he swooped down with his bagful of
money and grabbed it out from under us.

397
00:27:49,813 --> 00:27:52,933
- Son of a bitch!
- She never says that.

398
00:27:53,901 --> 00:27:55,775
Stay as far away from him as possible.

399
00:27:56,988 --> 00:28:01,448
Well, that'll be easy. He won't see me.
That's why I'm waiting for the call.

400
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:03,615
He won't see you?

401
00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:08,289
Well, we'll show you where he lives.

402
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:10,824
- You will?
- The son of a bitch!

403
00:28:11,795 --> 00:28:13,503
She never says that.

404
00:28:14,256 --> 00:28:16,498
I have the whole house to fix,
all the art to hang.

405
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:19,385
I have no idea what I'm going to wear
on the TV show.

406
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:22,347
But I have stopped everything
in order to teach you how to dive,

407
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:24,430
as it is as important for me
to see you dive

408
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:26,847
as it is for me to appear on
<i>Good Morning, America.</i>

409
00:28:26,978 --> 00:28:29,385
- Oh, man, this is pressure!
- Take off your robe.

410
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:36,232
Why are you always wearing black? What
is it with you and this death fixation?

411
00:28:36,363 --> 00:28:38,818
Maybe I'm in mourning
for my lost childhood.

412
00:28:40,242 --> 00:28:42,365
All right, come on, turn around.

413
00:28:42,494 --> 00:28:45,281
Toes at the edge, that's it.
Remember what we learned last year.

414
00:28:45,414 --> 00:28:46,445
One, two, three, spring!

415
00:28:46,582 --> 00:28:49,536
Now, bend at the knees, bend at
the waist, hands out, stiff as a board.

416
00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:51,875
One, two, three, spring!

417
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:54,959
One.

418
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:56,585
Two.

419
00:28:56,717 --> 00:28:58,757
Three.

420
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:02,136
Spring.

421
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:06,225
Spring.

422
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:08,392
Summer, fall, time to go, Dad.

423
00:29:08,522 --> 00:29:11,013
I don't understand. Why won't you dive?

424
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,308
With all the horror that's going on
in the world,

425
00:29:13,443 --> 00:29:15,483
what difference does it make?

426
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:23,402
Hi, Lily. I'm just calling to remind
you about Leo's surprise party.

427
00:29:23,537 --> 00:29:25,577
Thursday night, seven o'clock, OK?

428
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:31,034
It'll be after his interview, so he
should be relax... Oh, wait a minute.

429
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:38,674
Oh, of course I'm thrilled, Lily.

430
00:29:38,804 --> 00:29:41,840
The last person they interviewed
on vacation was Dr. Ruth.

431
00:29:43,517 --> 00:29:47,218
Here he comes. Thursday night,
seven o'clock, don't forget. Bye-bye.

432
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:57,820
- He didn't dive?
- No.

433
00:29:57,949 --> 00:30:02,113
Come on, sweetheart, he's just
a little afraid of it. Have patience.

434
00:30:02,245 --> 00:30:05,994
It's not like I'm making him
jump out of an airplane or anything.

435
00:30:06,124 --> 00:30:08,331
When I was growing up,
I thought diving was fun.

436
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,453
I thought you were born grown-up, Daddy.

437
00:30:16,177 --> 00:30:18,881
Yes, I'd like the number
to the Guttmans' coffee...

438
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,185
- What are you doing here?
- Don't be mad. The Guttmans brought me.

439
00:30:29,315 --> 00:30:30,774
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. G.

440
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,400
You're welcome, Bobby. Hello, Dr. Marvin.

441
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:38,610
- The house looks good.
- Burn in hell, Dr. Marvin!

442
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:46,074
Bob, we agreed that I would call you.

443
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:49,412
Your coming here
is unbelievably inappropriate.

444
00:30:49,545 --> 00:30:51,585
Dad, can I...

445
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:54,205
- Oh, sorry.
- Hi. You're Anna, aren't you?

446
00:30:54,342 --> 00:30:56,382
I saw your picture. I'm Bob.

447
00:30:57,262 --> 00:30:59,301
Hi, Bob. Nice to meet you, Bob.

448
00:30:59,431 --> 00:31:00,676
Hi, I'm Bob.

449
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:02,554
I'm Fay.

450
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:06,184
Oh, Mrs. M, you are even prettier
than your picture.

451
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:11,062
- And younger.
- Why, thank you.

452
00:31:11,193 --> 00:31:14,609
Fay, Anna, would you please excuse us?

453
00:31:14,738 --> 00:31:16,945
I think Bob and I
have something to talk about.

454
00:31:17,074 --> 00:31:19,862
Really? You think so, too?

455
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:21,951
Let's take a walk.

456
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,119
Bob, could I take your fish?

457
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,288
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

458
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,419
He's already eaten.
Don't let him tell you otherwise.

459
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:35,046
This is a great place.
No wonder the Guttmans wanted it.

460
00:31:35,385 --> 00:31:37,425
Whoa!

461
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,838
I'm sorry about barging in here
like this.

462
00:31:39,974 --> 00:31:41,598
That's all right. I understand.

463
00:31:42,643 --> 00:31:45,395
Your problems don't go away
just because I do.

464
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:49,389
Bob, I'd like you
to take a long look around you.

465
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:53,976
What does everything you see here
have in common?

466
00:32:02,873 --> 00:32:04,664
Vacation, Bob.

467
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,334
Vacation.

468
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,414
Now, I can't, Bob, at this time,

469
00:32:09,546 --> 00:32:13,046
give you the therapeutic attention
you need to solve all your problems,

470
00:32:13,175 --> 00:32:15,548
and you know why.

471
00:32:15,678 --> 00:32:20,174
- You're on vacation.
- Exactly. But what I can do is this.

472
00:32:21,434 --> 00:32:24,519
Don't give me pills.
I already have pills.

473
00:32:24,646 --> 00:32:26,685
This is not pills.

474
00:32:29,526 --> 00:32:31,269
Read it.

475
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:34,735
It says, "Take a vacation...

476
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,573
..from my problems."

477
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:40,944
I'm giving you permission
to take a vacation, Bob.

478
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,663
Not a vacation from your work, and
not a vacation from your daily life,

479
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,832
- but a vacation...
- From my problems.

480
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:49,254
Exactly!

481
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,954
Now, I want you to get on that bus
and go back to New York.

482
00:32:52,092 --> 00:32:55,627
But, every single time a problem arises,

483
00:32:55,762 --> 00:32:59,012
I want you to take that prescription
out and follow it to the letter.

484
00:32:59,141 --> 00:33:00,932
Doctor's orders.

485
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:04,144
I'll see you in New York, in my office,
in one month.

486
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:09,267
This is incredible. This is astounding.

487
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:13,194
For the first time since Esalen,
I feel free.

488
00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:15,778
You've given me a great gift, doctor.

489
00:33:15,908 --> 00:33:20,072
The gift of life. You're a great man.

490
00:33:25,794 --> 00:33:28,000
I knew coming up here
was the right thing to do.

491
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,169
It feels right because you're here.

492
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:32,923
And it feels right
because you're leaving.

493
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:38,516
- Have a great vacation.
- You too, Bob.

494
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:43,058
A vacation from my problems.

495
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,187
You bet I will.

496
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,442
There you go. Baby steps.

497
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,287
(Marvin whistles)

498
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,082
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, perfectly fine.

499
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,755
He seemed pleasant enough.

500
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,921
Mm-hmm. When he's controlled.

501
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,669
I got so excited,
I forgot to bring you with me.

502
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,514
Gil.

503
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,681
Oh, the fish!

504
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,191
That's a very nice likeness of you.
Of everyone, actually.

505
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:32,235
Bye, Bob.

506
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:33,907
Bye-bye, Bob.

507
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:36,405
Bye-bye. So long.

508
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:39,869
- You've got to be Sigmund.
- Yes, this is Sigmund and this is Bob.

509
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,278
- Bob was just leaving.
- Hi.

510
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:43,455
Oh, this is Gil, my fish, Sigmund.

511
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:48,420
- Did you get him out of the lake?
- No. City fish.

512
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:51,882
- Cool.
- But he's lovin' it up here.

513
00:34:53,595 --> 00:34:56,549
Your father
is the most incredible psychiatrist.

514
00:34:56,682 --> 00:34:58,141
I hope you appreciate him.

515
00:34:58,267 --> 00:35:00,306
Have a great vacation, family.

516
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:02,645
Me, too.

517
00:35:04,398 --> 00:35:05,513
Goodbye, Bob.

518
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,689
- Bye, Bob.
- Goodbye.

519
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:09,858
Bye.

520
00:35:09,987 --> 00:35:12,395
- Well, he's different.
- Uh huh.

521
00:35:12,532 --> 00:35:13,611
Neat fish.

522
00:35:13,741 --> 00:35:16,030
I think I do look younger
than that picture.

523
00:35:28,257 --> 00:35:30,296
Or,

524
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,937
this.

525
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:52,274
I told you, I like the rifle.
I think it's a symbol of virility.

526
00:35:52,407 --> 00:35:55,907
Now can I eat breakfast? I'm supposed
to go sailing on George Stark's boat.

527
00:35:56,036 --> 00:35:58,076
Wait, wait, wait.

528
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,411
Fay, I need your opinion. Rifle or bust?

529
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:04,914
I think both looks are wonderful,
sweetie.

530
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,170
Oh, Fay!

531
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:13,593
You know I can't live with that kind
of answer. I need feedback.

532
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:15,761
(bell clanging)

533
00:36:23,357 --> 00:36:25,396
Good morning, Dr. Marvin.

534
00:36:25,526 --> 00:36:28,313
No, these aren't for you.
They're for Fay.

535
00:36:29,155 --> 00:36:32,987
For yesterday. For your hospitality
to Gil and me. I didn't say thank you.

536
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:37,284
I thought about what you said.
Take a vacation from my problems.

537
00:36:37,413 --> 00:36:39,121
And I did.

538
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:40,624
But you're back.

539
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,909
- No, I'm not.
- You're not?

540
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:45,749
No, I'm not. I'm on vacation.

541
00:36:47,174 --> 00:36:50,128
This isn't an appointment.
I'm dropping by.

542
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,305
This is my first time up at the lake.
This is my first time anywhere.

543
00:36:56,308 --> 00:36:58,348
I haven't figured out
how to get food yet.

544
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:01,728
I'm staying at the Guttmans. When l
told them what you said, they insisted.

545
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:02,721
No, no, no.

546
00:37:02,857 --> 00:37:06,807
I know we can't work, but let's
get the friendship thing going.

547
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:08,688
See you later.

548
00:37:08,822 --> 00:37:10,861
Sure seems like he's staying,
doesn't it?

549
00:37:10,991 --> 00:37:13,030
Hey, paper boy. This was on your porch.

550
00:37:15,412 --> 00:37:16,408
Thank you.

551
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:29,209
Family conference! Family conference!

552
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:34,425
Now, I don't want any of you
letting Bob into this house.

553
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:36,716
- Why?
- Why?

554
00:37:36,851 --> 00:37:39,177
Aren't you over-reacting
just a little bit?

555
00:37:39,354 --> 00:37:42,308
I'm glad we're all in agreement.
Family conference is over.

556
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:50,020
A vacation from my problems.

557
00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:53,443
Nobody here. Nothing to fear.

558
00:37:54,578 --> 00:37:57,663
There's nobody here.
I'm completely alone.

559
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,455
I'm all by myself.

560
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,669
There's nobody here! Whoa!

561
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:26,816
- Hi, Bob. Where are you going?
- Hi.

562
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:29,104
I'm just going to town.
Buy some Kleenex.

563
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,990
- Well, you want a ride?
- I'd love one.

564
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:43,333
- Do a lot of people use this car?
- Just us.

565
00:38:57,353 --> 00:39:00,140
So what's it like, being the daughter
of a brilliant analyst,

566
00:39:00,273 --> 00:39:04,057
who's sleeping in the next bedroom at
night when you need him? Is it great?

567
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:09,323
No, it's not great.

568
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:14,284
I have problems, the same
as anyone else. The same as you.

569
00:39:15,247 --> 00:39:18,332
You're afraid your bladder will
explode? What other ones are the same?

570
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:20,202
Like what? Like what?

571
00:39:20,336 --> 00:39:25,081
Like analysing everything to death,
to see if what I'm feeling is normal.

572
00:39:25,216 --> 00:39:27,209
Yes, I have that. Yeah.

573
00:39:27,343 --> 00:39:31,044
Do you freeze up and turn into wood
when you're around a good-looking guy,

574
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:33,138
and you don't even know
if he likes you or not?

575
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:35,555
Well, not a guy, but yes, I free...

576
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:39,185
You know what? I treat people
as if they were telephones.

577
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:41,354
If I meet somebody
I don't think likes me, I say,

578
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:44,021
"Bob, this one's just temporarily
out of order."

579
00:39:44,903 --> 00:39:47,940
"Don't break the connection.
Just hang up and try again."

580
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:51,113
- And does it work?
- It seems to be.

581
00:39:51,243 --> 00:39:54,577
I'm on vacation at Lake Winnipesaukee,
aren't I?

582
00:39:55,957 --> 00:39:59,492
Do you want to come sailing with me
on my friend George's boat?

583
00:39:59,627 --> 00:40:01,501
N-o-o-o-o-o!

584
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:05,212
- That's OK, you don't have to.
- No, I'd love to.

585
00:40:05,342 --> 00:40:07,381
That sounds great.

586
00:40:07,511 --> 00:40:10,084
I... Well, I've never been on a boat,

587
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:12,511
and I don't think I can handle it.

588
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:15,311
It just makes my lips numb
to think about it.

589
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:18,639
But if your friend is a good sailor
and the craft is seaworthy,

590
00:40:18,773 --> 00:40:21,643
yes, I will go sailing.
Yeah, let's go sailing.

591
00:40:21,776 --> 00:40:23,603
I have no other plans.

592
00:40:25,905 --> 00:40:27,364
I'm sailing!

593
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:30,281
I'm sailing!

594
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:33,492
I'm sailing!

595
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:37,622
I'm sailing!

596
00:40:38,794 --> 00:40:40,833
I'm sailing!

597
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:43,002
I'm sail-i-i-i-i-i-n-g!

598
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,591
This is child abuse.
If you drop me, I'll prosecute.

599
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:54,884
I'm not going to let go
until you're ready, OK? Trust me.

600
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,059
Put your hands out like I showed you.

601
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:04,233
I'm not ready. You hear me? I'm not
ready. Don't drop me. I'm not ready.

602
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:06,979
Dr. Marvin! I'm sailing!

603
00:41:07,115 --> 00:41:09,322
Whoa!

604
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:11,777
- How about that, doc?
- Oh, Siggy!

605
00:41:11,912 --> 00:41:13,537
Oh! Oh!

606
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:14,743
Murderer!

607
00:41:17,084 --> 00:41:18,164
Hitler!

608
00:41:18,294 --> 00:41:20,334
Anna: Hi, Dad!

609
00:41:21,297 --> 00:41:22,756
I sail!

610
00:41:33,393 --> 00:41:35,635
Anna! Anna, come here, please.

611
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,894
Dad!

612
00:41:38,023 --> 00:41:40,063
Anna, I'd like to speak to you, please.

613
00:41:40,192 --> 00:41:42,648
Bob: Dr. Marvin, Dr. Marvin, guess what?

614
00:41:42,778 --> 00:41:44,901
I sail. I'm a sailor. I sail!

615
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:48,492
- I'd like to talk to my daughter.
- lsn't this a breakthrough?

616
00:41:48,618 --> 00:41:52,201
I mean, that I'm a sailor? I sail!

617
00:41:53,456 --> 00:41:55,496
- I sail now.
- Keep sailing, Bob.

618
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:59,586
Out on a boat, on the lake,
way far away from the dock?

619
00:41:59,713 --> 00:42:02,963
Into the wind,
with the sky and everything?

620
00:42:03,091 --> 00:42:04,669
Bob: Ahoy!

621
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:07,637
I thought I told you
to stay away from Bob Wiley.

622
00:42:07,763 --> 00:42:10,171
Daddy, I was with my friends.
Where are we going?

623
00:42:10,307 --> 00:42:12,347
- Home.
- Well, what about the car?

624
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:16,011
Leave it! It's been a long time since
I've had a talk with my daughter.

625
00:42:17,148 --> 00:42:20,434
- Oh, Daddy, not here!
- Anna! Anna!

626
00:42:20,777 --> 00:42:22,816
Anna! Anna!

627
00:42:25,115 --> 00:42:29,409
Anna, I know you won't listen to your
father, but you always listen to me.

628
00:42:29,536 --> 00:42:32,074
So I'm asking you not to see Bob Wiley.

629
00:42:32,206 --> 00:42:34,531
- Daddy, I am just...
- I can't hear you.

630
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,706
Where are you, Anna?

631
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:42,873
- I am just having fun with my friends.
- And Bob Wiley.

632
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:44,123
Yes, and Bob Wiley.

633
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,087
Bob Wiley is your father's patient.

634
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,260
Bob Wiley is a very sensitive person.

635
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:49,504
Your father's sensitive.

636
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:52,558
- Bob listens to people.
- Your father listens to people!

637
00:42:52,686 --> 00:42:54,974
Except when he's up here
in Lake Winnipesaukee.

638
00:42:56,523 --> 00:42:59,773
He is fun! Oh!

639
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:04,197
Your father's... kind of fun.

640
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:10,071
I'm Fay Marvin, Dr. Marvin's wife.

641
00:43:10,204 --> 00:43:13,324
And I'm very happy
to be on your programme.

642
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:15,746
And these are our children,
Anna and Siggy.

643
00:43:15,877 --> 00:43:17,916
(approaching footsteps)

644
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:36,019
- I'm a failure.
- What?

645
00:43:36,148 --> 00:43:39,980
I'm going on national TV tomorrow
as an expert in human behaviour,

646
00:43:40,111 --> 00:43:43,729
and in the last hour, both of my
children have told me they hate me.

647
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,317
Leo, come on,
you know that they don't mean it.

648
00:43:49,454 --> 00:43:51,494
Anna accused me of being insensitive.

649
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,539
No, no.

650
00:43:58,422 --> 00:44:00,296
What she actually said was,

651
00:44:00,424 --> 00:44:04,469
I was insensitive and I didn't listen,
and I wasn't any fun.

652
00:44:07,056 --> 00:44:09,381
And that Bob Wiley was.

653
00:44:09,642 --> 00:44:12,264
Give me some time

654
00:44:12,395 --> 00:44:15,598
to blow the man down

655
00:44:26,535 --> 00:44:28,611
Notice anything different about me?

656
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:31,662
- No.
- Do you sail?

657
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:32,739
No.

658
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:37,087
Well, I just picked it up.
Wonder what I'm going to pick up next?

659
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:41,874
- Try diving.
- All right. Diving.

660
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,049
I know a great teacher.

661
00:44:46,222 --> 00:44:50,172
I mean, my dad, he just dropped me
in the water, without warning me first.

662
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:54,640
I mean, I nearly drowned.
My whole life flashed before my eyes.

663
00:44:54,773 --> 00:44:58,142
- You're lucky you're only 12.
- It was still grim.

664
00:44:58,277 --> 00:45:01,444
I mean, what is it with him and diving?
What's the big deal?

665
00:45:01,614 --> 00:45:05,197
Well, he prob... Whoa!

666
00:45:08,496 --> 00:45:10,738
He probably just wants you to beat it,
that's all.

667
00:45:10,873 --> 00:45:14,207
He probably just wants you to dive
because you're afraid of diving.

668
00:45:14,335 --> 00:45:17,586
Did I tell you,
I sailed on my first try?

669
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,790
I just let the boat do the work,
that was my secret.

670
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:29,100
But with diving, what is the thing?
What's the trick?

671
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,560
I don't know, it's supposed to be easy.

672
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,681
Well, can you give me a handle on it?

673
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,356
Thanks.

674
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,563
Careful. Oh, careful!

675
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:44,738
- Just go to the edge.
- Careful.

676
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:49,245
Go to the edge. Come on, toes up,
toes up. To the edge. Don't worry.

677
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:51,911
Right here.
Let's call this the edge right here.

678
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:54,082
OK, step up to the edge.

679
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:57,495
Well then, walk up to our edge.

680
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,873
OK. Got you.

681
00:46:00,009 --> 00:46:02,714
Now bend your knees, bend your knees.
Very good.

682
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:07,179
Now bend your knees
and be stiff as a board.

683
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,599
I am stiff as a board.

684
00:46:10,728 --> 00:46:14,145
- Now lean forward. Lean.
- Just a second. Don't rush it.

685
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:16,101
This is my first dive.

686
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:20,484
Lean. Lean.

687
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:23,568
I can't see what you're doing.
Why don't you get in front?

688
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,194
All right, careful.
Hold it, hold it, wait, wait.

689
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:33,074
Hold my shirt and I'll show you
what we're supposed to do.

690
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:34,242
I got it.

691
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:38,790
- Bend my knees.
- Bend your knees.

692
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:42,709
- Lean forward with my arms out.
- Stiff as a board.

693
00:46:42,846 --> 00:46:44,885
Honey? Come here and look.

694
00:46:47,517 --> 00:46:48,632
Come here.

695
00:46:54,733 --> 00:46:57,022
I don't want to have to see this.
No, please!

696
00:46:57,445 --> 00:46:58,559
- One...
- No!

697
00:46:58,696 --> 00:47:00,736
- Two...
- Don't do it, please!

698
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:02,564
Three...

699
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:10,198
Yes!

700
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:11,282
Yeah.

701
00:47:11,418 --> 00:47:13,457
Bravo, Siggy!

702
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:17,712
Very nice, Bob. Thank you. Thank you.

703
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,009
I'll take it from here.

704
00:47:20,135 --> 00:47:22,009
You dove. That's wonderful.

705
00:47:22,137 --> 00:47:25,720
Did you see me dive, Dad?
Did you see me dive? I dove!

706
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,341
- Thank you. Excellent.
- Watch this. I can do it again.

707
00:47:28,477 --> 00:47:31,099
- I'll take it from here.
- Did you see? I'm gonna do it again.

708
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:33,270
Thank you. That was very nice.

709
00:47:35,902 --> 00:47:37,942
Leo! Look what you're doing!

710
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:40,111
Bob! Bob!

711
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:49,080
What are you staring at?
I had every right to buy this house.

712
00:47:57,717 --> 00:47:59,756
Am I gonna die?

713
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,600
Am I gonna die?

714
00:48:17,571 --> 00:48:19,611
Fay!

715
00:48:25,037 --> 00:48:29,581
Look, everybody, I am not wrong often,
but when I am, I admit it. I mean it.

716
00:48:30,877 --> 00:48:33,878
- I'd like you all to accept my apology.
- Well, what about Bob?

717
00:48:34,005 --> 00:48:35,630
Marvin: What <i>about</i> Bob?

718
00:48:35,757 --> 00:48:39,091
Yeah, Dad. Don't you think
you should apologise to Bob?

719
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:41,508
I will not apologise to Bob.

720
00:48:41,638 --> 00:48:42,717
Why not?

721
00:48:44,308 --> 00:48:47,344
All right. I'll apologise to Bob.

722
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:56,850
And now I'd like him to go.

723
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:01,523
Leo, why are you so hostile
to the poor man?

724
00:49:01,659 --> 00:49:03,948
Because he's a patient.

725
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,285
Fay! Don't you get it? He's a patient.

726
00:49:07,707 --> 00:49:09,250
A patient!

727
00:49:09,376 --> 00:49:11,416
Could we have Bob over for dinner?

728
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:13,253
- Dinner?
- Yeah.

729
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,088
I don't want Bob for dinner, Fay.

730
00:49:15,215 --> 00:49:18,750
- Leo, it's for the kids.
- I don't want Bob for dinner.

731
00:49:18,886 --> 00:49:21,424
Fay! I want to think about
my interview tomorrow.

732
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,051
I'm sorry, Leo. Right is right.

733
00:49:33,693 --> 00:49:35,733
Bob: Oh! Mm! Mmmm!

734
00:49:37,906 --> 00:49:41,358
Mm! Mmmmmmm!

735
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,750
Mmm! Mmm!

736
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:15,946
Mm. Fay, this is so scrumptious.
Is this hand shucked?

737
00:50:16,322 --> 00:50:18,813
Mm-hm. Would you like
some more chicken, Bob?

738
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:35,125
- Leo, do you want the breast?
- No, no, no, that's fine. Eat up.

739
00:50:41,765 --> 00:50:44,387
- Mmm. Great biscuits, huh, Bob?
- Mmm, yeah.

740
00:50:44,518 --> 00:50:48,101
Great biscuits, great corn,
great potatoes.

741
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:50,472
Do you want some more salad, Bob?

742
00:50:51,526 --> 00:50:53,684
Yeah, I think I do.

743
00:50:56,322 --> 00:50:58,362
Pile it high and deep, will you, please?

744
00:51:01,787 --> 00:51:04,075
Could you get that tomato off there,
please?

745
00:51:04,748 --> 00:51:06,788
- Sure.
- Thank you.

746
00:51:12,506 --> 00:51:15,080
Mmm! Mmmmmmm!

747
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:24,089
Fay, this is delicious!

748
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:27,054
Mmm! Mmmmmm!

749
00:51:27,188 --> 00:51:29,228
Will you stop that, please?

750
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,568
Leo, I see salt and pepper.
Is there a salt substitute?

751
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:46,330
I'll get it.

752
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,375
And don't call me Leo.

753
00:51:52,507 --> 00:51:55,342
But you said in your office
that I could call you Leo.

754
00:51:55,468 --> 00:52:00,131
That was in my office. In my home,
I'd like you to call me Dr. Marvin.

755
00:52:05,604 --> 00:52:08,641
He's just a little nervous
about his interview tomorrow.

756
00:52:09,149 --> 00:52:12,566
Oh, yeah.
I heard about your upcoming debut.

757
00:52:12,695 --> 00:52:15,815
Congratulations, Le... Dr. Marvin.

758
00:52:18,576 --> 00:52:22,277
Your book is going to do a lot of good
for a lot of people.

759
00:52:22,414 --> 00:52:24,406
I'm walking proof of that.

760
00:52:30,172 --> 00:52:32,793
- Is this butter or margarine?
- Butter.

761
00:52:32,925 --> 00:52:34,205
(strangled choking)

762
00:52:34,343 --> 00:52:35,718
Dad?

763
00:52:39,932 --> 00:52:41,759
- Dad, are you OK?
- Dad?

764
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:42,841
Honey?

765
00:52:45,146 --> 00:52:46,937
Don't panic. I know what to do.

766
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:52,441
Don't worry. I got him.

767
00:52:53,947 --> 00:52:55,987
- OK?
- No, do it again.

768
00:52:57,075 --> 00:52:59,863
- Oh, my God, he's just...
- His eyes are popping out of his head.

769
00:52:59,995 --> 00:53:02,035
I'm doing the right thing.

770
00:53:03,332 --> 00:53:05,371
- He's turning blue!
- He's still choking!

771
00:53:05,501 --> 00:53:07,540
There's one other thing.

772
00:53:12,341 --> 00:53:14,168
Leo, honey, I love you. Breathe!

773
00:53:14,302 --> 00:53:17,422
- Harder. Maybe with your knee more.
- Hit him harder. Jump higher.

774
00:53:19,391 --> 00:53:20,885
- Spit it out.
- He's still blue.

775
00:53:24,229 --> 00:53:26,269
Do it again. Breathe!

776
00:53:28,233 --> 00:53:29,727
- Leo, are you OK?
- Get him off me.

777
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,900
Get him off me!

778
00:53:35,157 --> 00:53:37,197
Bob, you saved him!

779
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:40,659
That was incredible.

780
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:43,658
I just never gave up hope.

781
00:53:46,586 --> 00:53:48,377
(thunder)

782
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:50,544
Argh!

783
00:53:52,425 --> 00:53:55,842
(Bob, Fay & Siggy)
With a happy refrain

784
00:53:55,971 --> 00:54:01,511
Just singin', just singin' in the rain

785
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:06,269
We're singin' in the rain

786
00:54:06,399 --> 00:54:09,565
Just singin' in the rain

787
00:54:09,694 --> 00:54:12,814
What a glorious feeling

788
00:54:12,947 --> 00:54:15,865
I'm happy again!

789
00:54:15,992 --> 00:54:19,077
I'll walk through the kitchen

790
00:54:19,204 --> 00:54:21,446
With a bowl full of chicken

791
00:54:21,581 --> 00:54:23,621
And I'll put it in Fay and Leo...

792
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:28,957
I mean, Dr. Marvin's refrigerator
for the night

793
00:54:29,089 --> 00:54:34,048
I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain

794
00:54:34,178 --> 00:54:37,843
I don't like being a party-poop,
but tomorrow's very important,

795
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,013
and I think we'd better call it a night.

796
00:54:44,272 --> 00:54:48,187
I don't want to be rude, but maybe
it's time for Bob to sing his way home.

797
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,896
Honey, he can't walk home in this.

798
00:54:50,028 --> 00:54:52,068
Did I say that? I'll drive him.

799
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:55,907
Oh, Dad, the car's still at the marina.

800
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,491
- What?
- You said to leave it, remember?

801
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:02,537
Well...

802
00:55:03,417 --> 00:55:05,825
the rain's got to let up soon.
He can go home then.

803
00:55:05,962 --> 00:55:08,168
Well, what if it starts up again?

804
00:55:08,297 --> 00:55:09,840
He can borrow my slicker.

805
00:55:09,966 --> 00:55:12,587
(thunder)

806
00:55:29,779 --> 00:55:32,982
- Leo! Leo!
- Ssh! I think it's letting up.

807
00:55:36,327 --> 00:55:39,198
Leo, honey,
it's one o'clock in the morning.

808
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,865
We can't just make that poor fella
just sit here all night.

809
00:55:43,001 --> 00:55:44,709
Let's just let him stay over.

810
00:55:44,836 --> 00:55:49,166
Fay! <i>Good Morning, America</i>
will be here at seven o'clock.

811
00:55:49,299 --> 00:55:51,837
You don't want them to find
a severely disturbed patient

812
00:55:51,969 --> 00:55:53,878
sleeping on one of my couches.

813
00:55:54,012 --> 00:55:55,804
There's an extra bed in Siggy's room.

814
00:55:55,931 --> 00:55:56,962
Fay!

815
00:55:57,099 --> 00:56:00,219
Leo, you were very upset
over Anna and Siggy.

816
00:56:01,145 --> 00:56:06,732
Here's your chance to show 'em what
kind of guy Leo Marvin really is.

817
00:56:10,572 --> 00:56:12,611
Come on, sweetie, come on.

818
00:56:16,703 --> 00:56:19,953
Bob, we'd love for you
to spend the night.

819
00:56:20,082 --> 00:56:22,121
That's a great idea.

820
00:56:23,085 --> 00:56:24,460
Do you have a Dacron pillow?

821
00:56:24,587 --> 00:56:28,252
Sure, sure. Anna, would you get
a pillow and some sheets for Bob?

822
00:56:28,382 --> 00:56:29,580
Sure.

823
00:56:29,717 --> 00:56:32,801
Siggy, would you get one of
your father's robes for Bob?

824
00:56:32,929 --> 00:56:34,257
Yeah.

825
00:56:36,391 --> 00:56:40,258
- Are you sure I'm not imposing?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, not at all.

826
00:56:42,898 --> 00:56:44,392
OK.

827
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:57,069
Do you care which bed?

828
00:56:57,204 --> 00:56:59,612
Well, I'd prefer facing southeast.

829
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,707
This one.

830
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,996
- Did you find a toothbrush?
- Yes.

831
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,875
Fay, do you know
where my new toothbrush is?

832
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:15,381
- It should be in the bathroom.
- I know it should be in the bathroom,

833
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,844
but it's not!

834
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:20,811
Leo, honey, just because you're
going on television tomorrow,

835
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,394
well, it doesn't give you any right
to be so snippy.

836
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:27,026
It is not that
that is making me snippy. It's him!

837
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:30,522
Him who? Bob?

838
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:33,361
Yes! Bob! Who else am I talking about?

839
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:36,408
Ssh! Quiet, he'll hear you.

840
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:38,910
So what if he hears me?
It's my house, isn't it?

841
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,038
Don't you get it? He faked suicide, huh?

842
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:45,044
Well, isn't that a cry for help?

843
00:57:45,172 --> 00:57:46,915
What is the matter with all of you?

844
00:57:47,049 --> 00:57:50,548
Don't you understand? This man is crazy!

845
00:57:50,678 --> 00:57:56,017
I mean, for all we know,
the guy could be a mass murderer.

846
00:58:00,855 --> 00:58:02,647
Oh, come on, Leo.

847
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:04,517
He's a sweet guy.

848
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:09,278
He's perfectly harmless.
Maybe a little neurotic, but not crazy.

849
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:12,609
Don't you realise
that everything he's done

850
00:58:12,743 --> 00:58:14,949
violates
the doctor-patient relationship?

851
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:18,779
And now he's in there with our son!

852
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:23,083
Bob?

853
00:58:23,713 --> 00:58:25,752
Yeah?

854
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:29,258
Are you afraid of death?

855
00:58:34,182 --> 00:58:35,178
Yeah.

856
00:58:35,308 --> 00:58:37,348
Me, too.

857
00:58:38,937 --> 00:58:40,977
And there's no way out of it.

858
00:58:41,857 --> 00:58:43,517
You're going to die.

859
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,690
I'm going to die.

860
00:58:45,819 --> 00:58:49,105
It's going to happen.

861
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,902
And what difference does it make
if it's tomorrow or in 80 years?

862
00:58:55,538 --> 00:58:57,281
Much sooner, in your case.

863
00:58:58,458 --> 00:59:00,497
Do you know how fast time goes?

864
00:59:02,003 --> 00:59:05,622
- I was six, like, yesterday.
- Me, too.

865
00:59:05,757 --> 00:59:07,797
I'm going to die.

866
00:59:09,052 --> 00:59:11,092
You are going to die.

867
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:16,390
What else is there to be afraid of?

868
00:59:17,603 --> 00:59:20,177
Well, not diving any more, huh?

869
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:24,355
But...

870
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:29,529
- Tourette's Syndrome.
- What's Tourette's Syndrome?

871
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:35,570
What's Tourette's Syndrome?

872
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:40,581
Oh, I'm very proud of Baby Steps,
and very encouraged by its success.

873
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:44,412
I think the greatest challenge to me,
aside from writing it,

874
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:47,335
was in finding ways...
- Shit for brains!

875
00:59:47,468 --> 00:59:49,342
Siggy: Butthead!

876
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:51,379
Bob: Dingleberry-butt!

877
00:59:51,514 --> 00:59:53,174
Snotface!

878
00:59:53,307 --> 00:59:55,134
Vulture-vomit!

879
00:59:55,268 --> 00:59:56,431
Turkey-tits!

880
00:59:57,729 --> 00:59:59,768
Siggy: Belch-breath!

881
01:00:00,523 --> 01:00:02,849
Open this door! Sigmund!

882
01:00:03,443 --> 01:00:05,352
Sigmund, open this door immediately.

883
01:00:06,363 --> 01:00:08,403
I'm sorry, Dad.

884
01:00:08,532 --> 01:00:10,572
Sorry.

885
01:00:11,076 --> 01:00:14,659
- Sorry.
- What is going on around here?

886
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:19,911
Tourette's, Dad. Tourette's.

887
01:00:21,129 --> 01:00:23,168
I'm sorry, Dad. Leo.

888
01:00:24,257 --> 01:00:25,087
Dr. Marvin.

889
01:00:25,216 --> 01:00:27,707
I don't want to hear another peep
out of this room.

890
01:00:29,137 --> 01:00:32,257
- People are trying to sleep here.
- Honey, it's just kids being kids.

891
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:35,261
Well, tomorrow
is the most important day of my career.

892
01:00:35,394 --> 01:00:37,433
We're sorry. We'll stop.

893
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:41,314
We just got carried away.
It will never happen again.

894
01:00:42,192 --> 01:00:44,351
I want you out of here by 6:30.

895
01:00:44,487 --> 01:00:47,772
The camera crew is coming at 7:00.
I want you out by 6:30.

896
01:00:49,659 --> 01:00:52,280
Sure.
Would you like something for sleep?

897
01:00:52,412 --> 01:00:55,745
- What?
- I have Valium if you need it.

898
01:00:55,874 --> 01:00:57,913
No, I don't need any Valium.

899
01:00:58,043 --> 01:01:02,420
- Halcion? Seconal?
- I want some peace and quiet.

900
01:01:04,049 --> 01:01:06,421
Well, I'll be quiet.

901
01:01:06,552 --> 01:01:08,094
I'll be peace.

902
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,299
(snorting)

903
01:01:18,064 --> 01:01:20,103
Come on, Bob. Come on, here we go.

904
01:01:21,818 --> 01:01:25,519
Now, we've just got to get your father
through <i>Good Morning, America.</i>

905
01:01:27,282 --> 01:01:30,733
Bob gave me a great thing
to be afraid of instead of death.

906
01:01:32,371 --> 01:01:34,410
That's nice, sweetie.

907
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:39,082
That's very nice, Bob.

908
01:01:40,671 --> 01:01:42,747
- Night, fellas.
- Uh, Mrs. M?

909
01:01:42,882 --> 01:01:45,752
Could you leave the door open
just a crack?

910
01:01:45,885 --> 01:01:47,925
Okey-dokey.

911
01:02:19,128 --> 01:02:22,165
It's six o'clock, Bob. Time to wake up.
Come on, let's go.

912
01:02:22,298 --> 01:02:24,540
Come on, Bob. Get up.

913
01:02:24,676 --> 01:02:27,167
Bob! Come on, Bob!

914
01:02:27,304 --> 01:02:29,343
Bob, rise and shine. Come on.

915
01:02:30,307 --> 01:02:32,383
Bob! Come on, Bob, get up!

916
01:02:32,518 --> 01:02:34,557
Bob! Bob! Get up.

917
01:02:41,068 --> 01:02:43,738
Come on. Come on,
it's six o'clock, rise and shine.

918
01:02:43,863 --> 01:02:45,571
Anna, go get the car, right now.

919
01:02:45,698 --> 01:02:47,738
Come on. Come on, Bob.

920
01:02:48,743 --> 01:02:51,234
Bob! Bob!

921
01:02:51,371 --> 01:02:52,949
Bob!

922
01:02:53,081 --> 01:02:55,121
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

923
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:58,701
Bob! Bob!

924
01:02:58,837 --> 01:03:00,213
Doh!

925
01:03:00,339 --> 01:03:02,378
(alarm clock rings quietly)

926
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:08,763
Hi.

927
01:03:17,065 --> 01:03:18,559
Honey, relax.

928
01:03:21,736 --> 01:03:24,025
Baby stepping down the stairs.

929
01:03:24,156 --> 01:03:28,236
Baby stepping down the stairs.
Is this a beautiful morning or what?

930
01:03:28,368 --> 01:03:30,776
- Get out.
- I had the most incredible dream.

931
01:03:30,913 --> 01:03:32,952
Leave!

932
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:35,749
Goodbye, Mrs. M. See you later.

933
01:03:35,876 --> 01:03:37,952
Bye-bye, Bob.
- Bye, Anna.

934
01:03:38,087 --> 01:03:39,166
- Bye, Bob.

935
01:03:40,756 --> 01:03:42,465
Goodbye, rat-dick suck-nut!

936
01:03:42,592 --> 01:03:44,668
Siggy: Goodbye, dog-piss barf-brain!

937
01:03:44,802 --> 01:03:47,091
Later, testicle-head bosom-beaver.

938
01:03:47,222 --> 01:03:49,261
<i>Good Morning, America</i> is here.

939
01:03:53,145 --> 01:03:55,184
(crew member) Everybody, let's go.

940
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:04,020
Hi. I'm Marie Grady, lifestyle reporter
with <i>Good Morning, America.</i>

941
01:04:04,156 --> 01:04:06,445
I'm a big fan.
I watch your stuff all the time.

942
01:04:06,575 --> 01:04:08,284
I hope we're not too early.

943
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,071
I'm Howie Katrell, the director.

944
01:04:10,204 --> 01:04:12,244
This is our producer, Lennie Burns.

945
01:04:12,373 --> 01:04:13,453
Nice to meet you.

946
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:16,619
- Well, may we come in?
- Yeah. Oh, sure, yeah. Absolutely.

947
01:04:20,173 --> 01:04:23,957
This is... This is our home.

948
01:04:26,054 --> 01:04:28,094
I was thinking of something by the fire?

949
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:30,380
It's a fireplace shot.

950
01:04:30,517 --> 01:04:33,187
- This is even nicer than the pictures.
- Thank you.

951
01:04:33,312 --> 01:04:36,099
Is this your family?

952
01:04:36,232 --> 01:04:38,272
Yes. Yes, it is.

953
01:04:40,945 --> 01:04:42,938
Oh, excuse me! I'm sorry.

954
01:04:43,072 --> 01:04:46,157
- This is my wife, Fay.
- Hi.

955
01:04:48,537 --> 01:04:49,616
Oh, sorry.

956
01:04:50,789 --> 01:04:55,784
- And this is my daughter, Anna.
- Hi.

957
01:04:55,919 --> 01:04:57,959
And my son... erm...

958
01:04:59,673 --> 01:05:01,666
- Siggy.
- Siggy!

959
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:04,552
- Oh, hi. I'm Marie.
- Hello, Marie. I'm Bob.

960
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:06,339
Oh, yes, this was Bob.

961
01:05:06,472 --> 01:05:08,512
He's a patient. He lives down the road.

962
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:11,678
Dr. Marvin, what a great idea!
A Baby Stepper in action!

963
01:05:11,811 --> 01:05:13,685
Dr. Marvin's gonna have
a patient with him.

964
01:05:13,813 --> 01:05:16,102
Fine. Lennie,
let's not shoot this fireplace.

965
01:05:16,233 --> 01:05:19,566
- Let's set up over here and shoot...
- Whoa! Wait a minute, wait a minute!

966
01:05:19,695 --> 01:05:22,898
No problem, Dr. Marvin.
We can still use the fireplace.

967
01:05:23,031 --> 01:05:25,071
You on one side and Bob on the other.

968
01:05:28,496 --> 01:05:30,951
I don't think it's a good idea
to have a patient on with me.

969
01:05:31,082 --> 01:05:32,161
- It is.
- It is?

970
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:34,201
Yes, it's a great idea!

971
01:05:34,335 --> 01:05:37,502
What better way
to show the effectiveness of your book?

972
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:39,124
I think it's a fireplace shot.

973
01:05:39,257 --> 01:05:42,044
May I speak to you outside
for just one second?

974
01:05:42,177 --> 01:05:44,051
Thank you so much.

975
01:05:44,179 --> 01:05:46,848
I've worked very hard to get
where I am. Do you understand me?

976
01:05:46,973 --> 01:05:50,224
- The schooling alone. I understand.
- I do not want you on the show with me.

977
01:05:50,352 --> 01:05:52,309
- Do you understand?
- I think I do.

978
01:05:52,438 --> 01:05:54,146
Now make up some excuse.

979
01:05:54,273 --> 01:05:56,645
Dr. Marvin, Bob,
can we have you in here for a minute?

980
01:05:56,775 --> 01:05:59,445
- I can't. Dr. Marvin doesn't want me...
- Nah-hah!

981
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:02,192
- Get in there. They're waiting for us.
- OK. OK.

982
01:06:02,323 --> 01:06:04,565
Right this way.

983
01:06:05,451 --> 01:06:07,491
<i>♪♪  Good Morning, America theme  ♪♪</i>

984
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:11,991
Director: In. 3... 2... 1 ...

985
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:15,371
We're back, and we're going now
to lifestyle reporter Marie Grady,

986
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,413
in Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire.

987
01:06:17,547 --> 01:06:20,714
Marie, what is so special
about Lake Winnipesaukee?

988
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:25,172
Well, Joan, among other things, it's
the summer home of Dr. Leo Marvin,

989
01:06:25,306 --> 01:06:28,639
author of the newest sensation
in therapy, <i>Baby Steps.</i>

990
01:06:28,768 --> 01:06:32,053
And with Dr. Marvin is Bob Wiley,
who is a patient,

991
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:35,522
and obviously a big fan
of <i>Baby Steps</i> therapy.

992
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:37,690
Good morning, Dr. Marvin, Bob.

993
01:06:38,111 --> 01:06:40,151
(both) Good morning.

994
01:06:41,323 --> 01:06:44,573
Now clearly, to come on national
television live, with a patient,

995
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:47,192
shows confidence in your meth...
(sneezes)

996
01:06:47,329 --> 01:06:48,788
..thods

997
01:06:48,914 --> 01:06:50,954
Urgh!

998
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:56,671
(whispers)

999
01:06:59,008 --> 01:07:01,048
False alarm. Sorry.

1000
01:07:01,427 --> 01:07:02,376
OK?

1001
01:07:04,806 --> 01:07:06,929
Good. Now, Dr. Marvin,

1002
01:07:07,684 --> 01:07:11,634
exactly how does <i>Baby Steps</i>
work on someone like Bob?

1003
01:07:11,771 --> 01:07:14,689
Well, Joan, I'm very proud of <i>Baby Steps</i>

1004
01:07:14,816 --> 01:07:16,774
and enormously gratified by its success.

1005
01:07:16,902 --> 01:07:19,654
I think the greatest challenge,
aside from the writing,

1006
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:24,323
is finding ways to make it accessible
to laymen as well as to my colleagues.

1007
01:07:24,452 --> 01:07:26,491
(gasps)

1008
01:07:28,122 --> 01:07:31,622
Bob, tell us your impressions of
<i>Baby Steps.</i>

1009
01:07:32,335 --> 01:07:34,328
Mashed potatoes and gravy, Marie!

1010
01:07:34,462 --> 01:07:36,538
I couldn't be happier about <i>Baby Steps.</i>

1011
01:07:37,048 --> 01:07:39,088
I was a total disaster.

1012
01:07:39,217 --> 01:07:41,424
And now, because of this man,

1013
01:07:41,553 --> 01:07:45,218
this morning I'm on TV in front of
millions and millions of people.

1014
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:47,507
I don't even think Dr. Marvin knows
what's going on.

1015
01:07:47,643 --> 01:07:50,430
He can't believe what's going on.
I'm very excited.

1016
01:07:51,814 --> 01:07:54,020
It sounds like
a very intriguing process.

1017
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:56,273
How long have you been a patient
of Dr. Marvin's?

1018
01:07:56,402 --> 01:08:00,696
- Well... Three or four days.
- Three or four days?

1019
01:08:00,823 --> 01:08:05,320
The book is not really meant to work
that quickly.

1020
01:08:05,453 --> 01:08:07,327
It only worked that quickly with Boob.

1021
01:08:07,455 --> 01:08:09,994
- Bob.
- You can call me Boob.

1022
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:12,118
I don't want to call you Boob.

1023
01:08:12,252 --> 01:08:15,502
- Even as an accident, it's OK.
- No, I don't want to call him Boob.

1024
01:08:15,631 --> 01:08:18,300
The book isn't meant to work
that quickly.

1025
01:08:18,425 --> 01:08:23,052
But it did work that way.
That's the miracle of <i>Baby Steps.</i>

1026
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:26,098
It's not just this book.

1027
01:08:26,225 --> 01:08:30,389
It's this man. It's the compassion.
It's the dignity.

1028
01:08:30,522 --> 01:08:32,348
It's the wisdom. It's the...

1029
01:08:32,482 --> 01:08:37,440
It's the horse sense of the guy
that gets you.

1030
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:39,398
And it has turned me... l...

1031
01:08:39,531 --> 01:08:43,778
He actually had me stay here last night
in his jammies.

1032
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,660
Using his toothbrush.

1033
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,784
In his house.

1034
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:54,702
And I spent the day swimming
and sailing with his family.

1035
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,045
Fay and Anna and Siggy,

1036
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,835
come here.

1037
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,926
Oh, Fay, l... Can they?

1038
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,462
Here's the fam! The Marvins.

1039
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:08,474
This is Fay and Anna and Siggy,
whom I went diving with yesterday.

1040
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:11,011
And Dr. Marvin accidentally pushed me in.

1041
01:09:11,148 --> 01:09:12,607
You have a very nice family.

1042
01:09:12,733 --> 01:09:14,773
Thank you.

1043
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:16,941
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

1044
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:26,701
Marie, you're wise. What do I say to
someone who has turned my life around?

1045
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:30,615
Who has given up so much of their time
and their vacation to make me better?

1046
01:09:30,752 --> 01:09:33,872
What I'd like to do is put the
greatness of this man in perspective.

1047
01:09:34,005 --> 01:09:36,128
I think there's only really three names.

1048
01:09:36,258 --> 01:09:38,749
Dr. Albert Schweitzer,

1049
01:09:38,886 --> 01:09:41,044
Mother Theresa of Calcutta, probably,

1050
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:44,596
and Leo Marvin.

1051
01:09:44,725 --> 01:09:48,937
The book is <i>Baby Steps.</i>
The author is Dr. Leo Marvin.

1052
01:09:49,063 --> 01:09:51,388
And we've been talking with Bob Wiley.

1053
01:09:51,524 --> 01:09:54,276
Pretty impressive stuff, Bob. Dr. Marvin.

1054
01:09:54,402 --> 01:09:55,565
Back to you, Joan.

1055
01:09:55,695 --> 01:09:57,735
Way to go, Bobby!

1056
01:10:01,952 --> 01:10:04,822
- That was wonderful, Bob.
- Thank you very much, Marie.

1057
01:10:04,955 --> 01:10:06,864
Can we come back in a few months?

1058
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:10,249
Aah, as long as it's OK with my doctor.

1059
01:10:10,377 --> 01:10:15,336
What? Oh, absolutely.
That's a very good idea.

1060
01:10:16,217 --> 01:10:19,134
- Come on, Dad. We're taking a picture.
- Come on, Dr. Marvin.

1061
01:10:19,262 --> 01:10:21,301
No, no.

1062
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:24,254
You go ahead.

1063
01:10:24,392 --> 01:10:26,136
How long are you planning on staying?

1064
01:10:26,269 --> 01:10:29,104
Just till Labor Day and then
we all go back to New York City.

1065
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:32,813
(Photographer) Big smiles, everybody.

1066
01:10:32,943 --> 01:10:35,695
Cheese!

1067
01:10:36,488 --> 01:10:39,940
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye, Marie.

1068
01:10:40,075 --> 01:10:42,115
Bye-bye, it was nice having you.

1069
01:10:42,244 --> 01:10:44,284
Bye, Howie. Bye, Marie.

1070
01:10:44,413 --> 01:10:46,702
Come again.

1071
01:10:46,832 --> 01:10:48,541
Oh, they're so nice.

1072
01:10:48,668 --> 01:10:50,957
- You were great, Bob.
- You really were.

1073
01:10:51,087 --> 01:10:54,005
You were incredible. I mean,
Dad choked, you saved him.

1074
01:10:56,801 --> 01:10:58,960
It was such a big day
for the whole family.

1075
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:02,506
Here's the one who made it happen.

1076
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:04,349
Dr. Leo Marvin.

1077
01:11:05,936 --> 01:11:08,059
Dr. Leo Marvin.

1078
01:11:08,188 --> 01:11:11,640
- Get out!
- No, we won't get out.

1079
01:11:11,776 --> 01:11:13,186
We won't. You deserve it.

1080
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:15,691
I mean, get <i>out</i> !

1081
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:19,773
Get out!

1082
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:21,107
Is it something I said?

1083
01:11:21,244 --> 01:11:22,703
You've ruined my life!

1084
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:25,830
You've ruined my career.
You've ruined my book.

1085
01:11:25,957 --> 01:11:28,911
You've turned a perfectly peaceful
house into an insane asylum.

1086
01:11:29,044 --> 01:11:30,206
Get out!

1087
01:11:30,337 --> 01:11:32,626
- Daddy!
- My God, Leo, what's gotten into you?

1088
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:35,543
It was a disaster, Fay!

1089
01:11:35,676 --> 01:11:38,428
No, it wasn't.
You were wonderful, sweetie.

1090
01:11:38,554 --> 01:11:40,096
You were fine, Dad.

1091
01:11:40,222 --> 01:11:42,180
Why did you need to kick
Bob out of the house?

1092
01:11:42,933 --> 01:11:48,011
You think he's gone? He's not gone!
That's the point. He's never gone.

1093
01:11:48,147 --> 01:11:49,974
Is this some radical new therapy?

1094
01:11:50,108 --> 01:11:52,147
You see!

1095
01:11:54,404 --> 01:11:56,313
We can't be expected to understand him.

1096
01:11:56,448 --> 01:12:00,576
He's so far above us, we're like ropes
on the Goodyear blimp.

1097
01:12:04,707 --> 01:12:06,580
Are you all right?

1098
01:12:08,919 --> 01:12:13,582
I want to apologise to you for that
terrible outburst. I'm truly sorry.

1099
01:12:13,716 --> 01:12:16,753
Call it a case of show business nerves.

1100
01:12:16,886 --> 01:12:19,638
We can all certainly understand that.

1101
01:12:19,764 --> 01:12:22,302
A lot of people freeze on TV, Dad.

1102
01:12:22,434 --> 01:12:24,094
Thank you.

1103
01:12:24,227 --> 01:12:28,605
Bob, how would you feel about
you and me having a little talk?

1104
01:12:28,732 --> 01:12:29,977
Just me and you?

1105
01:12:30,108 --> 01:12:33,691
Mm-hm. I think I'd like to spend
a little time with you.

1106
01:12:33,821 --> 01:12:36,394
Pay you back
for all the time you've spent with me.

1107
01:12:37,408 --> 01:12:39,864
What do you say?
Feel like going for a little ride?

1108
01:12:39,994 --> 01:12:42,034
Do I?

1109
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:46,493
This is so sweet.

1110
01:12:46,626 --> 01:12:48,784
- Really great of you, Dad.
- Really nice.

1111
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:51,328
Look how happy he is.

1112
01:13:06,897 --> 01:13:09,389
Try to be home by seven.

1113
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:22,405
Where are we going?

1114
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:24,081
Intensive psychotherapy.

1115
01:13:24,207 --> 01:13:25,832
Wa-hoo!

1116
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:29,909
OK, some free associations
from my infancy.

1117
01:13:30,464 --> 01:13:32,255
A beach ball.

1118
01:13:32,383 --> 01:13:34,091
A dog.

1119
01:13:34,218 --> 01:13:35,463
A frog.

1120
01:13:35,594 --> 01:13:37,468
A log.

1121
01:13:37,597 --> 01:13:39,755
A poodle. A noodle.

1122
01:13:40,391 --> 01:13:41,720
A doodle.

1123
01:13:48,066 --> 01:13:50,106
Dr. Marvin to see Dr. Tomsky.

1124
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:52,226
Dr. Leo Marvin.

1125
01:13:52,362 --> 01:13:54,900
Main building, Doctor.
They're expecting you.

1126
01:13:55,824 --> 01:13:58,446
- Hey, you're Bob Wiley, aren't you?
- Yeah.

1127
01:13:58,577 --> 01:14:01,448
I saw you on TV. You were great.

1128
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:02,825
Ha!

1129
01:14:17,389 --> 01:14:21,256
Hello, Leo. Long time, no see. Sorry
I missed your show this morning.

1130
01:14:21,393 --> 01:14:23,884
Well, is this the friend
you called about?

1131
01:14:24,021 --> 01:14:26,476
Bob Wiley, I'd like you to meet
your new pal, Dr. Tomsky.

1132
01:14:26,607 --> 01:14:30,142
- Hello, Bob.
- New pal? What's wrong with my old pal?

1133
01:14:30,277 --> 01:14:32,484
Would you show Mr. Wiley
to his room, please?

1134
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:37,824
Oh, no, wait a second, Doctor. Doctor,
you're coming with, aren't you?

1135
01:14:37,952 --> 01:14:40,739
Fellas, I have convulsions.
My bladder is really funny.

1136
01:14:40,872 --> 01:14:42,911
Fellas...!

1137
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,744
I really appreciate you helping me out.

1138
01:14:45,877 --> 01:14:49,329
I can only hold him for 24 hours, Leo,
without staff corroboration.

1139
01:14:49,464 --> 01:14:52,916
I'm not worried about that in the least.

1140
01:14:53,844 --> 01:14:56,252
I'm sure your entire staff
will corroborate.

1141
01:14:57,306 --> 01:14:58,931
Thank you very much, Katherine.

1142
01:14:59,058 --> 01:15:01,097
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

1143
01:15:14,157 --> 01:15:17,822
You see, Bob, I will not be defeated.

1144
01:15:18,704 --> 01:15:22,073
I will negotiate and I will compromise,
but defeat?

1145
01:15:26,712 --> 01:15:30,710
Cigarette, Bob? Oh, sorry, I didn't
realise you were in a straitjacket.

1146
01:15:58,037 --> 01:16:01,572
Honey, Katherine Tomsky's on the phone.

1147
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:06,080
Hello? What?

1148
01:16:07,005 --> 01:16:09,044
No. No!

1149
01:16:10,842 --> 01:16:14,342
- Son of a bitch! That son of a bitch!
- Where's Bob?

1150
01:16:15,055 --> 01:16:17,094
Honey, where's Bob?

1151
01:16:20,394 --> 01:16:23,514
What about Bob? What about Bob?

1152
01:16:24,732 --> 01:16:26,808
What about Bob?

1153
01:16:26,942 --> 01:16:31,355
"ls it male or female?" He says, "It's
a female. What, do you think I'm weird?"

1154
01:16:35,493 --> 01:16:37,616
But, uh, it reminds me
of my favourite poem.

1155
01:16:37,746 --> 01:16:41,031
Which is, erm...
Roses are red, violets are blue,

1156
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:43,871
I'm a schizophrenic, and so am l.

1157
01:16:59,227 --> 01:17:01,184
Bob: The psychiatrist has a patient.

1158
01:17:01,312 --> 01:17:04,397
He draws a circle and says, "What do
you think of when you see this?" "Sex."

1159
01:17:04,524 --> 01:17:05,983
(laughter)

1160
01:17:06,109 --> 01:17:08,398
That's not the joke yet. Wait a second.

1161
01:17:08,528 --> 01:17:11,019
He draws a tree and says,
"What do you think of that?" "Sex."

1162
01:17:11,156 --> 01:17:14,276
Then he draws a picture of a car,
a house. Sex, sex, sex.

1163
01:17:14,409 --> 01:17:16,485
The doctor says,
"You're obsessed with sex."

1164
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:19,870
And the patient says, "You're the one
drawing all the dirty pictures."

1165
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:23,949
I'm giving you back your admittance
form, to save you any embarrassment.

1166
01:17:24,086 --> 01:17:28,713
Embarrassment?
Katherine, you have been duped.

1167
01:17:28,841 --> 01:17:30,881
By a textbook narcissist.

1168
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,670
A brilliant sociopath.

1169
01:17:32,804 --> 01:17:37,181
Brilliant enough to dupe
my entire staff? I doubt that.

1170
01:17:37,309 --> 01:17:40,594
It's perfectly natural
for a patient to bond with his analyst.

1171
01:17:40,729 --> 01:17:41,725
Oh, it's not that...

1172
01:17:41,855 --> 01:17:45,639
If you want to be rid of him, just tell
him you won't treat him any more.

1173
01:17:45,776 --> 01:17:47,484
Katherine, that's easy for you to say.

1174
01:17:47,611 --> 01:17:49,520
The man is human Krazy glue.

1175
01:17:49,655 --> 01:17:52,063
You should never have let him
sleep in your pyjamas.

1176
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:54,572
I can't believe that I'm hearing this.

1177
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:57,491
- Relax, Leo.
- I'm relaxed!

1178
01:17:57,622 --> 01:18:00,374
- Take a vacation.
- I'm on vacation!

1179
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,248
Maybe you should check in here
for a few days, get a handle on things.

1180
01:18:06,131 --> 01:18:08,170
(explosive laughter)

1181
01:18:12,346 --> 01:18:14,504
It was an interesting morning. Fruitful.

1182
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,843
But it lacked the intensity
that you and I generate together.

1183
01:18:17,977 --> 01:18:20,016
The sparks that we get one-on-one?

1184
01:18:20,813 --> 01:18:23,897
We just got to figure out a way
to work around your schedule.

1185
01:18:24,025 --> 01:18:26,064
Could we work afternoons?

1186
01:18:26,194 --> 01:18:28,685
Two to four? Three to five?

1187
01:18:28,821 --> 01:18:31,277
Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
Saturday and Sunday?

1188
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:32,783
Aaaargh!

1189
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,539
Are you saying
you'd rather work mornings?

1190
01:18:43,962 --> 01:18:46,002
Get out of the car!

1191
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:53,639
It's a combustible relationship,
isn't it?

1192
01:18:53,764 --> 01:18:56,220
Is it just you and me,
or is it you and everybody?

1193
01:19:03,483 --> 01:19:05,523
What is this? lsolation therapy?

1194
01:19:07,487 --> 01:19:09,527
(approaching siren)

1195
01:19:16,455 --> 01:19:20,074
<i>Number 2 at the corner of Church
and Mainland. Just a fender bender.</i>

1196
01:19:20,209 --> 01:19:22,249
<i>No report of injury.</i>

1197
01:19:22,378 --> 01:19:24,252
Ahoy!

1198
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:27,631
Excuse me, officer.
Can you make sure he's home by seven?

1199
01:19:32,722 --> 01:19:34,762
Hey, didn't I see that guy on TV?

1200
01:20:01,253 --> 01:20:05,714
You're certainly very shrewd, Bob.
Really, very shrewd. You stayed free.

1201
01:20:06,508 --> 01:20:09,545
And I wrecked my car.
But it's over, Bob!

1202
01:20:16,435 --> 01:20:18,262
Goddamn!

1203
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:20,887
Son of a bitchin' Bob!

1204
01:20:26,696 --> 01:20:28,736
I'm home!

1205
01:20:32,035 --> 01:20:34,075
Fay?

1206
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:38,788
We're out here, sweetie.

1207
01:20:48,302 --> 01:20:50,342
Surprise!

1208
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:53,923
Happy birthday to you

1209
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:57,309
Happy birthday to you

1210
01:20:57,437 --> 01:21:01,055
Happy birthday, Leo Marvin

1211
01:21:01,191 --> 01:21:05,319
Happy birthday to you!

1212
01:21:05,446 --> 01:21:07,734
(cheering)

1213
01:21:13,996 --> 01:21:16,036
For he's a jolly good fellow

1214
01:21:16,332 --> 01:21:19,417
For he's a jolly good fellow

1215
01:21:19,794 --> 01:21:21,834
Which nobody can deny

1216
01:21:22,464 --> 01:21:24,503
Which nobody can deny

1217
01:21:24,924 --> 01:21:26,964
Which nobody can deny

1218
01:21:27,427 --> 01:21:29,467
For he's a jolly good fellow...

1219
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:41,599
Dad, what happened?

1220
01:21:41,734 --> 01:21:42,979
Dad?

1221
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:45,898
Honey, you're a mess. Are you all right?

1222
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:47,275
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1223
01:21:47,407 --> 01:21:50,277
I just had a little car trouble.

1224
01:21:50,785 --> 01:21:52,493
Oh, on your birthday.

1225
01:21:54,873 --> 01:21:56,367
Happy birthday, Leo.

1226
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:58,451
(all) Happy birthday, Leo.

1227
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:04,295
Sweetie,
we have a great big surprise for you.

1228
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:08,132
Your sister Lily's here from Chicago.

1229
01:22:10,222 --> 01:22:12,630
Happy birthday, Leo.

1230
01:22:12,767 --> 01:22:14,391
Lily!

1231
01:22:14,519 --> 01:22:18,137
We're all here for you, Dr. M.
This is your night.

1232
01:22:19,524 --> 01:22:21,980
Don't touch my sister!

1233
01:22:40,338 --> 01:22:42,377
I've never seen him like this, Phil.

1234
01:22:42,507 --> 01:22:44,499
He's been under a lot of stress, Fay.

1235
01:22:44,634 --> 01:22:48,383
His book, his interview,
which frankly didn't go so well.

1236
01:22:48,513 --> 01:22:50,422
And his birthday.

1237
01:22:50,557 --> 01:22:54,140
Exactly.
That's a lot to bite off all at once.

1238
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:57,603
Sedative's probably taking effect.
He should be sleeping now.

1239
01:23:06,407 --> 01:23:09,278
Phil, do you think Leo was surprised?

1240
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:10,988
Oh, I think so.

1241
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,825
- How is he?
- I'm leaving a prescription for Prozac.

1242
01:23:14,749 --> 01:23:17,536
Excuse me, Phil,
but with these particular symptoms,

1243
01:23:17,669 --> 01:23:19,662
is Prozac the right choice?

1244
01:23:19,796 --> 01:23:21,872
You think Prozac is a mistake?

1245
01:23:22,007 --> 01:23:23,667
With this kind of manic episode,

1246
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,671
I would think Librium might be
a more effective management tool.

1247
01:23:26,803 --> 01:23:29,377
You could be right.
I'll rewrite the prescription.

1248
01:23:31,308 --> 01:23:34,013
Bob, why do you think
Leo went after you like that?

1249
01:23:34,145 --> 01:23:37,596
I don't know. He's been tense today.
But don't worry.

1250
01:23:37,732 --> 01:23:41,777
No matter how long it takes, I'm going
to stay on and help. I'll be the daddy.

1251
01:23:41,903 --> 01:23:45,319
You are such a good friend.
Leo's lucky to have you.

1252
01:23:51,413 --> 01:23:54,082
Lily, honey, I didn't thank you,
sweetie. Thanks.

1253
01:23:54,207 --> 01:23:58,040
Oh, no problem. lt'll be all right. Bye.

1254
01:23:58,879 --> 01:24:01,335
- It's been a real pleasure.
- Keep me posted.

1255
01:24:01,465 --> 01:24:02,876
OK.

1256
01:24:03,008 --> 01:24:06,212
- Bye, Aunt Lily.
- Good night, Lil.

1257
01:24:06,888 --> 01:24:09,639
- Bye, Lily.
- Bye, Bob.

1258
01:24:22,988 --> 01:24:24,613
This is so hard, Bob.

1259
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:27,029
But, now, listen.

1260
01:24:27,159 --> 01:24:30,991
We're not defending
Leo's recent behaviour in any way,

1261
01:24:31,122 --> 01:24:33,198
so please don't take this personally.

1262
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:35,495
No.

1263
01:24:36,669 --> 01:24:41,166
But we've been thinking
that however irrational the reasons,

1264
01:24:41,299 --> 01:24:43,458
Leo's just so upset with you right now
that...

1265
01:24:44,386 --> 01:24:49,760
we just think it would be best if
you're not here when he wakes up.

1266
01:24:52,936 --> 01:24:55,059
Please, it's not the way I want it.

1267
01:24:55,189 --> 01:24:57,894
- Me, either.
- Or me.

1268
01:25:02,947 --> 01:25:04,406
You want me to go.

1269
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:06,110
I'm sorry.

1270
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:15,581
Really?

1271
01:25:20,549 --> 01:25:21,498
Goodbye.

1272
01:25:21,633 --> 01:25:23,543
Green-puking piss-ant.

1273
01:25:23,677 --> 01:25:26,881
Later, barf-breath douche-mouth.

1274
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:30,516
- Goodbye, Bob.
- Goodbye, Anna.

1275
01:25:30,643 --> 01:25:33,597
- Take care of yourself.
- OK. And you take care of Leo.

1276
01:25:33,729 --> 01:25:36,137
Just temporarily disconnected,
that's all.

1277
01:25:40,361 --> 01:25:42,401
You know, I've got to tell you.

1278
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:45,567
I've had the greatest vacation
with y'all.

1279
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,322
Y'all!

1280
01:25:48,453 --> 01:25:50,493
I <i>am</i> country now!

1281
01:26:12,437 --> 01:26:14,477
No, too messy.

1282
01:26:16,566 --> 01:26:18,606
No, no, not painful enough.

1283
01:26:29,664 --> 01:26:31,703
Yes!

1284
01:26:38,631 --> 01:26:41,668
- He's not at the dock.
- He's not downstairs.

1285
01:26:41,802 --> 01:26:44,719
- Let's get in the car. Come on.
- Maybe he went for a walk.

1286
01:26:44,846 --> 01:26:48,381
That's how mass murderers start.
No-one sees it coming, then snap!

1287
01:26:57,777 --> 01:26:59,816
(timid whistling)

1288
01:27:09,581 --> 01:27:11,621
(owl cry and rustling)

1289
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,913
Hello?

1290
01:27:17,047 --> 01:27:18,458
(howling)

1291
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:20,299
Oh, gosh!

1292
01:27:20,426 --> 01:27:22,465
Dr. Marvin!

1293
01:27:23,888 --> 01:27:25,002
Doctor!

1294
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:27,179
Dr. Leo Marvin!

1295
01:27:28,726 --> 01:27:30,386
Dr. Marvin!

1296
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,228
Dr. Le...

1297
01:27:32,355 --> 01:27:35,309
- Dr. Marvin!
- Hello, Bob.

1298
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,651
What are you doing with a rifle?

1299
01:27:37,777 --> 01:27:40,233
Fay: Leo!
- Get back. Get back.

1300
01:27:40,364 --> 01:27:42,771
- What are you doing with that?
- Quick, quick!

1301
01:27:42,908 --> 01:27:44,532
Daddy! Daddy!

1302
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,699
Stand there.

1303
01:27:46,829 --> 01:27:48,868
Anna and Siggy: Dad! Dad!

1304
01:27:49,456 --> 01:27:52,956
- Daddy, where are you?
- Leo!

1305
01:27:53,085 --> 01:27:56,003
- There goes the fam.
- Ssh! Be very quiet.

1306
01:27:56,130 --> 01:27:58,170
And do exactly as I say.

1307
01:27:58,758 --> 01:27:59,754
Turn around.

1308
01:27:59,884 --> 01:28:01,924
- Now move.
- What are we up to?

1309
01:28:02,887 --> 01:28:05,295
Death therapy, Bob.
It's a guaranteed cure.

1310
01:28:05,432 --> 01:28:07,424
Wow! Should I put my hands up?

1311
01:28:07,559 --> 01:28:09,386
Yes, that's good. Do that.

1312
01:28:09,519 --> 01:28:10,718
Which way?

1313
01:28:10,854 --> 01:28:12,894
To the left. To the left, yes!

1314
01:28:14,483 --> 01:28:17,935
It's so right that you and I have
come together, isn't it, Dr. Marvin?

1315
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:20,941
- I know it was meant to be.
- You think so, Bob?

1316
01:28:21,073 --> 01:28:23,362
Yes. Because it's time.

1317
01:28:23,492 --> 01:28:24,821
And I'm ready.

1318
01:28:24,952 --> 01:28:27,526
With Dr. Carswell Fensterwald,
I wasn't ready.

1319
01:28:27,664 --> 01:28:31,247
With Dr. Rosengay and Pancheski,
it wasn't time.

1320
01:28:31,376 --> 01:28:35,670
I certainly wasn't ready for
Mallerstein or Miller or Hill.

1321
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:39,664
But with you, finally, I'm ready.

1322
01:28:39,801 --> 01:28:42,886
The only significant difference between
those other guys and me, Bob,

1323
01:28:43,013 --> 01:28:44,721
is that I'm going to kill you.

1324
01:28:44,848 --> 01:28:46,888
But if you shoot me,

1325
01:28:47,017 --> 01:28:49,057
then our therapy will be over.

1326
01:28:50,396 --> 01:28:53,433
I'm not gonna shoot you, Bob.
I don't think I could shoot anybody.

1327
01:28:53,566 --> 01:28:55,606
I am going to blow you up.

1328
01:28:57,487 --> 01:28:59,693
This is called black powder, Bob.

1329
01:28:59,823 --> 01:29:02,824
One teaspoon of this stuff
can blow up a tree stump.

1330
01:29:02,951 --> 01:29:04,279
There we go.

1331
01:29:04,411 --> 01:29:06,035
And how much is this?

1332
01:29:06,163 --> 01:29:08,202
Twenty pounds' worth.

1333
01:29:10,959 --> 01:29:14,044
You understand, don't you?
There's no other solution.

1334
01:29:14,171 --> 01:29:15,334
You won't go away.

1335
01:29:15,464 --> 01:29:17,504
- I will.
- No, you won't.

1336
01:29:17,633 --> 01:29:19,211
You're just saying you will.

1337
01:29:19,343 --> 01:29:22,428
But then, after I don't kill you,
you'll show up again.

1338
01:29:22,555 --> 01:29:24,761
You'll do something else
to make everyone in my life

1339
01:29:24,891 --> 01:29:26,682
think you're wonderful
and I'm a schmuck.

1340
01:29:26,809 --> 01:29:28,138
But I'm not a schmuck, Bob.

1341
01:29:28,269 --> 01:29:31,224
I'm not going to let you breeze into
town and take my family away,

1342
01:29:31,356 --> 01:29:33,645
just because you're crazy enough
to be fun.

1343
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:39,524
(Marvin hums)

1344
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:42,947
(Marvin laughs maniacally)

1345
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:48,490
You'll take care of Gil for me?

1346
01:29:48,624 --> 01:29:51,460
Yeah, don't worry.
I'll feed him till he's big and fat.

1347
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:54,460
And then I'll eat him, Bob!

1348
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:57,545
You sure are convincing, Dr. M.

1349
01:30:03,557 --> 01:30:05,596
This is tricky.

1350
01:30:10,314 --> 01:30:13,149
What? Oh, that's terrible news, Fay.

1351
01:30:13,818 --> 01:30:15,857
Well, he did try to commit suicide
once before.

1352
01:30:15,987 --> 01:30:18,822
Maybe we should have seen it coming.
More fish, anyone?

1353
01:30:20,283 --> 01:30:21,860
I'm all tied up.

1354
01:30:22,952 --> 01:30:24,992
You're tied up.

1355
01:30:27,999 --> 01:30:30,870
Yeah, that's it.
You're saying I'm all tied up inside.

1356
01:30:32,796 --> 01:30:36,248
OK... I'm all tied up inside.

1357
01:30:36,383 --> 01:30:39,966
And these phoney bombs mean that...

1358
01:30:41,931 --> 01:30:46,889
if I don't... untie myself... inside,

1359
01:30:47,019 --> 01:30:49,059
the emotional knots...

1360
01:30:50,106 --> 01:30:52,146
I'm going to explode!

1361
01:30:55,111 --> 01:30:58,148
Yeah! Oh, it's so... simple.

1362
01:31:01,034 --> 01:31:03,074
Yet so brilliant.

1363
01:31:05,831 --> 01:31:08,868
OK, Dr. M. I get it.

1364
01:31:11,962 --> 01:31:14,002
Baby step,

1365
01:31:15,842 --> 01:31:17,881
untie your knots.

1366
01:31:25,852 --> 01:31:27,892
Free!

1367
01:31:28,522 --> 01:31:30,561
Free!

1368
01:31:32,609 --> 01:31:34,649
Free!

1369
01:31:37,823 --> 01:31:40,528
Dr. M! You did it!

1370
01:31:41,118 --> 01:31:44,534
Fr-e-e-e-e-e-e-e! Hoo hoo hoo!

1371
01:31:48,084 --> 01:31:50,409
Dr. Marvin, Dr. Marvin! You did it!

1372
01:31:50,545 --> 01:31:52,585
You did it! Leo!

1373
01:31:52,714 --> 01:31:54,623
Oh, Leo-lee, I'm free!

1374
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:08,596
On Tuesday, we'll eat Gil.

1375
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:11,187
On Wednesday, we'll eat Bob.

1376
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:13,357
No, no, no, that's going too far.

1377
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:14,731
(car approaching)

1378
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:17,276
- Dad!
- Daddy!

1379
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:19,364
Dad!

1380
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:20,868
Dad, are you all right?

1381
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:23,532
- Where were you?
- We've been worried sick about you.

1382
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:26,201
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1383
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:30,992
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Really, thank you for asking.

1384
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:33,253
I'm fine now. Bob's gone.

1385
01:32:33,382 --> 01:32:34,662
We know, sweetie.

1386
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,840
You do? How?

1387
01:32:36,969 --> 01:32:38,511
I didn't hear it go off.

1388
01:32:38,638 --> 01:32:41,389
For he's a jolly good fellow

1389
01:32:41,724 --> 01:32:45,888
For he's a jolly good fellow
- It's Bob!

1390
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,555
For he's a jolly good fellow

1391
01:32:49,691 --> 01:32:51,897
- Bob! Just leave, please.
- No, no, no!

1392
01:32:52,027 --> 01:32:55,610
For Leo Marvin's a genius

1393
01:32:56,156 --> 01:33:00,024
Your death therapy cured me,
you genius!

1394
01:33:00,619 --> 01:33:02,695
What are you doing here?

1395
01:33:02,830 --> 01:33:04,538
You cured me, Doc-o!

1396
01:33:04,665 --> 01:33:08,745
Bob! The bags I put around your neck,
Bob. Where are they?

1397
01:33:08,878 --> 01:33:10,041
In the house.

1398
01:33:11,214 --> 01:33:12,079
Why?

1399
01:33:27,147 --> 01:33:28,939
Sweetie? Our house?

1400
01:33:29,775 --> 01:33:30,771
Oops.

1401
01:33:35,406 --> 01:33:39,534
Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!

1402
01:33:54,384 --> 01:33:57,670
Tomsky: It's been episodic
for the last couple of days.

1403
01:33:57,805 --> 01:33:59,928
Lily: Is he on any drugs or sedatives?

1404
01:34:00,057 --> 01:34:03,473
- Tomsky: He's on some medication.
- Lily: Do you think he can hear us?

1405
01:34:03,602 --> 01:34:05,227
Fay: Can we talk to him?

1406
01:34:05,354 --> 01:34:07,596
I don't know if it'll help, but try.

1407
01:34:07,732 --> 01:34:09,475
Come on, sweetie.

1408
01:34:12,111 --> 01:34:14,021
Leo! Sweetie!

1409
01:34:14,155 --> 01:34:16,362
Leo!

1410
01:34:16,491 --> 01:34:18,448
Can you hear me?

1411
01:34:18,577 --> 01:34:20,486
Daddy, it's me, Anna.

1412
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:23,456
Leo, it's me, Lily. Your sister.

1413
01:34:23,582 --> 01:34:27,627
Fay: We don't care about the house.
Come back to us.

1414
01:34:27,753 --> 01:34:29,662
The worst is over.

1415
01:34:29,797 --> 01:34:32,833
Yeah, Dad. How much worse can it get?

1416
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:39,307
Do you, Bob Wiley, take Lily Marvin

1417
01:34:39,432 --> 01:34:41,306
to be your lawful wedded wife,

1418
01:34:41,434 --> 01:34:44,519
to love, honour and cherish
till death do you part?

1419
01:34:44,646 --> 01:34:45,642
I do.

1420
01:34:45,772 --> 01:34:48,892
Do you, Lily Marvin, take Bob Wiley

1421
01:34:49,026 --> 01:34:50,484
to be your lawful wedded husband,

1422
01:34:50,611 --> 01:34:53,232
to love, honour and cherish
till death do you part?

1423
01:34:53,363 --> 01:34:55,155
I do.

1424
01:34:55,282 --> 01:34:57,952
If anyone here knows any reason

1425
01:34:58,077 --> 01:35:02,122
why these two should not be
joined together in holy matrimony,

1426
01:35:02,248 --> 01:35:05,332
speak now, or forever hold your peace.

1427
01:35:10,590 --> 01:35:12,630
(gurgles)

1428
01:35:16,930 --> 01:35:20,264
Then by the power invested in me
by the State of New York,

1429
01:35:20,392 --> 01:35:22,764
I pronounce you man and wife.

1430
01:35:22,895 --> 01:35:24,934
No-o-o-o-o-o!

1431
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:28,268
- Dad's back!
- Daddy!

1432
01:35:28,401 --> 01:35:30,025
Fay: Leo!

1433
01:35:30,152 --> 01:35:31,066
Leo!

1434
01:35:31,195 --> 01:35:34,232
Leo! Oh, my darling Leo!

1434
01:35:35,305 --> 01:36:35,646
