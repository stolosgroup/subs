OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,702
Please, please,
you must come quick.

3
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,327
There's a woman lying dead
out on the moors.

4
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,346
It's alright, miss.
No need for you to take another look.

5
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,435
Ruber.
Alice. Mrs.

6
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,647
I'd say she's been dead
for no more than two hours.

7
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,267
Say four o'clock at the outside
for time of death.

8
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,578
Hercules Parrot, sir.

9
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,996
Poirot, mademoiselle.

10
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,084
Pucker your lips as though
about to bestow a kiss! Poi-rot.

11
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,627
Morning, Poirot.
I hope you have good news.

12
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,093
This case has been hanging fire
for four months.

13
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,883
No, I'm afraid
it's one of those rare cases

14
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,507
where an insurance company must, er...

15
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,686
...laugh and lump it.

16
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,724
Very well.

17
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,027
The usual 100 guineas, I take it?

18
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,199
By the way, Poirot...
Take a look at this.

19
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,403
It is the property
of Sir Horace Blatt.

20
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,407
He is seeking to insure it
with us for £50,000.

21
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:49,749
Well, on the face of it,
it seems to be worth every penny of...

22
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,719
...£38 pounds, seven
shillings and sixpence.

23
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,468
You are of course quite right.
It is paste.

24
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,844
The question is why should
a millionaire industrialist

25
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,562
perpetrate such an obvious fraud?

26
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,149
Precisely. He must have known
the stone would be examined.

27
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,520
So you see,
there is something of a mystery.

28
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:16,401
Rest assured, with Hercule Poirot,
mysteries never last for long.

29
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,747
Exactly. We were wondering if you would
undertake to investigate the matter.

30
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,708
You know that you can count on
my discretion.

31
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:30,502
Very well, I will see Sir Horace...
this afternoon.

32
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:35,128
Hardly this afternoon, I think.
He's on his yacht, the Jolly Roger,

33
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,597
in the south of France.
Would a further £200 meet the case?

34
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,301
Guineas.

35
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:47,272
It will make my forthcoming holidays
even more attractive.

36
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,755
So that's your game, is it?

37
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:17,800
You come out here and as near as dammit
accuse me, Horace Blatt, of fraud?

38
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,798
Do you seriously think
that I'd cheat the insurance company

39
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,434
over one bloody jewel?
I am worth millions, Poirot.

40
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,101
Nevertheless, I'm afraid
it's quite worthless, monsieur.

41
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,391
God, I could wring her bloody neck!

42
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,026
If you would care to confide in me,
I should be most honoured.

43
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,025
Alright, I'll tell you this much.

44
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,780
A couple of months back,
I met a certain lady in New York.

45
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,118
She told me she was
so madly in love with me

46
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,709
that she'd leave the show she was in...
She was an actress, you know.

47
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,955
...and come back to England with me
on the Queen Mary and marry me.

48
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,707
So I bought her this stone
from Tiffany's.

49
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,757
Halfway across the Atlantic, she changed
her mind and ran off with another man.

50
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,722
I wouldn't have minded,
only she took the jewel with her.

51
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,307
That wasn't a fair do.

52
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,849
You see, I had given her it
in contemplation of marriage.

53
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,188
And, frankly,
$100,000 is a bit much to pay

54
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,603
for three days' fumbling
on the high seas.

55
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,399
Oh, monsieur, who can put a price on
les affaires de coeur?

56
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,691
I bloody can.

57
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,280
And this was too high.

58
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,864
So, three weeks ago,
I went after her and demanded it back.

59
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:27,034
Of course she tried to put me off, but
after a week or so she gave it to me

60
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,658
and I sent it along to be insured and...

61
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,122
She'd had the bloody thing copied,
hadn't she?

62
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,497
It would appear to be
the only explanation, monsieur.

63
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,751
Well, she's not gonna make
a chump out of me.

64
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,755
I happen to know that in three days'
time she'll be down at Daphne's place

65
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,005
for a little holiday.

66
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,096
I'll give her a little holiday!

67
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,935
Daphne's place?

68
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,310
Yes, you know, Daphne Castle.

69
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:57,061
She was a mistress of
the King of Tyrania for years,

70
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,234
then when he upped and married
the present queen

71
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,404
he gave Daphne
an old summer palace to keep her quiet.

72
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,825
She's turned it into one of those
exclusive la-di-da hotels

73
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,949
where the nobs and nancies
come to squawk at each other.

74
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,246
I can't stand it meself,
but she's good sort.

75
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:16,213
Anyway, you'd better come with me.
We can sail tonight.

76
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,956
Alas, monsieur.

77
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:22,006
<i>Ever since I was a small boy,
I have suffered from le mal de mer.</i>

78
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,346
It needed all my courage
to make this small trip.

79
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,722
I will take the train
and join you there.

80
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,024
<i>Mes compliments a Monsieur Jerome.</i>

81
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,195
<i>Waiter?</i>

82
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,993
Could I have another brandy
and the bill, please?

83
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,453
Patrick!
You haven't got time for another!

84
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,123
- The steamer leaves at 11:00!
- Of course I have!

85
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,837
You have the baggage sent down.

86
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,127
Why do I always have
to do everything?

87
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,632
Monsieur Poirot, your reservation
on the night train has been confirmed.

88
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,101
The tickets will be
at the desk.

89
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,764
Thank you.
Er...

90
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:36,584
I must go. I've got to catch
that damn boat

91
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,566
What on earth's wrong, Rex?
You look fearfully glum.

92
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,161
You're supposed to be enjoying yourself.
God knows you're paying enough for it!

93
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,905
Don't I know it?

94
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,206
As a matter of fact, Daphne,
I was wondering if you would care

95
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,751
to trade my bill for a super
piece in New Yorker?

96
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:26,009
You know the sort of thing.
"Farewell courtesan, hello inn-keeper."

97
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:30,343
Darling, I'd love to help. But it's not
publicity I need, it's the cash.

98
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,431
Oh, good God, darling,
don't we all?

99
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,517
How are the Gardeners
this morning?

100
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,855
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale,
their infinite vulgarity.

101
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,816
Good morning, Gardeners.
Everything tickety-boo?

102
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,230
Good morning.

103
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,355
Sure, Daphne.
But I could wish that my shower worked

104
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,779
as snappily as the one that
I've got back home in New York City .

105
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,778
Oh, you can't expect American plumbing
in the Adriatic.

106
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,122
I guess not.
Well, at least we've got a shower.

107
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:00,119
A cousin of Odell's was at
some place in Yugoslavia last year

108
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:04,373
and had to wash in a kind of shack
in a field. Isn't that so, Odell?

109
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,876
It wasn't my cousin, Myra,
it was my aunt.

110
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,003
It was your cousin,
Thelma Snatchball.

111
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,722
OK, if you insist.
But there were two shacks.

112
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,807
One for the guests
and one for the staff.

113
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,097
It was very... stylish.

114
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,890
Boat's coming in, Daphne.
Prepare to repel boarders.

115
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,725
That'll be Arlena.

116
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,607
Do you mean Arlena Stuart?

117
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,777
No, Arlena Marshall. She remarried
a couple of months ago.

118
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:33,948
Oh, good God, darling, I didn't know
she was coming. Oh, how marvellous!

119
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,617
I am her greatest fan.
It will just make my vacation.

120
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:40,584
Did any of you happen to see that
last show of hers,Hail and Farewell?

121
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,627
<i>♪ Hail and farewell, I'll never tell
You've cast a spell over me...</i>

122
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,092
We produced it.
Remember, dear?

123
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:54,215
Oh, good God, darlings,
I plumb forgot.

124
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,060
Isn't that the one that
she walked out on after just three weeks

125
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,894
and your biggest hit in years?

126
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,351
You know damn well it was.

127
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,942
And just what was that?
A sudden breakdown in health?

128
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,029
More like a sudden attack of
gold digging.

129
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:13,400
Which rather turned it into
"Sail and Farewell", eh?

130
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,202
Funny man.

131
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,542
Well, if that's Arlena, she must be
being dressed by Woolworths these days.

132
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:31,669
Oh, that's the Redferns. Patrick
and Christine, I seem to remember.

133
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,637
Excuse me, I must put my hostess hat on.

134
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,099
Anyway, darlings,
it must have cost you a pretty bundle

135
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,014
closing a hit show like that.

136
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,932
Would either of you
care to comment?

137
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,976
Why don't you go
and play with yourself?

138
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,019
Excessively.

139
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,112
Is coarseness a substitute
for wit, I ask myself.

140
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,780
Hello! I'm Daphne Castle.
Welcome to the island.

141
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,117
How do you do?

142
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,829
Looks lovely. I'm sure
we'll have a nice time here.

143
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,996
Oh. And a naughty one,
too, I hope.

144
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,620
- Would you care to sign in?
- Naughty?

145
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,083
What are the holidays for,

146
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,208
if you can't do a spot of flirting
and get a bit pissy boots?

147
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,836
Quite right. Do you fancy a walk
around the island before lunch, dear?

148
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,511
Patrick! You know perfectly well
that I've got a splitting headache

149
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,508
and I've got all the
unpacking to do.

150
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,307
Andrea will show to your room,
if you like.

151
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,937
Thank you.

152
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,182
After two days
on that suffocating steamer

153
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,811
I would have really thought that
you'd have more consideration for me.

154
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,733
Anyway, I'm no good at...

155
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:12,444
Thank you for those three hours
of pure and unadulterated hell.

156
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,360
This may come as a nasty surprise
to you,

157
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:21,237
but shock absorbers have been standard
on motorized vehicles for 30 years.

158
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,498
Stop playing boules with my Vuitton!

159
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,716
Linda, you gormless oaf, do something!

160
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,129
Like what?

161
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,878
Like stop them, cretin.

162
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,630
Kenneth! This is a nightmare.

163
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,053
Take it easy, Arlena.
We'll soon be there.

164
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,051
Soon can't be soon
enough for me.

165
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,770
Of all the dreadful
journeys...

166
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,440
Isn't that the absurd little man
we saw in the station at Tirana?

167
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,983
Pinched the only decent taxi
from under your nose.

168
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,527
Yes,
I do believe it is.

169
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,446
Good morning.

170
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,165
Since we are all obviously going
to Daphne's island,

171
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,750
I'd better introduce myself.

172
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,378
I'm Kenneth Marshall
and this is my wife, Arlena.

173
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,374
- Hercule Poirot. Enchantée, madame.
- Charmed.

174
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,671
This is my stepdaughter, Linda.

175
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,763
Do stop standing there like a coughdrop
and say good morning to Monsieur Poirot.

176
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,381
- Morning.
- Bonjour.

177
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,680
Was your journey as frightful as ours,
Monsieur Poirot?

178
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:30,522
Alas, I fear the sea
more than the land, madame.

179
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,524
Oh, Mr Marshall,
I implore you not to spoil them.

180
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,896
- We have to pay double on the way home.
- It's only a 20-minute boat trip.

181
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,441
You'll find it all worthwhile
once we get to the island, I assure you.

182
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,284
You mean you've been there before?

183
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,029
Yes, I was there for a few days
three years ago.

184
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,657
After the death of my first wife.

185
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,595
God's teeth!

186
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,887
Don't worry, darling.
It's only the noonday gun.

187
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,601
The noonday gun?

188
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,812
Yes, it's fired every day
at 12 o'clock

189
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:15,229
to commemorate the glorious victory of
Kosovo-Metohija in 1193.

190
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:19,855
I am reliably informed that
a mere handful of Tyranian cavalry

191
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,359
routed over 50,000
barbarous Bosnian fanatics.

192
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,158
The only military success
in their entire history.

193
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,077
One success too many.

194
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,388
Arlena!
Arlena, darling, I love you!

195
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,211
That tub was even more uncomfortable
than that damned taxi.

196
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,963
What if the bitch
refuses to do the show?

197
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,056
We'll lose all our backers,
that's what.

198
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,551
After all, we sell the
show on her name.

199
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,688
To think our futures are riding
on that snake-eyed hussy!

200
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,444
Welcome to the island, everybody!

201
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,412
Kenneth, oh,
it's marvellous to see you!

202
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,072
Absolutely marvellous.

203
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,621
It must be at least two years
since you were last on the island.

204
00:17:55,783 --> 00:18:00,289
It's three, actually. Wonderful to be
here. You never met Linda, did you?

205
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,790
No! No, I didn't.

206
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,176
Hello! Hello, Linda.
Welcome to the island.

207
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,672
And I don't think
you know Arlena.

208
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,471
Oh! Oh, yes.
Yes, I do.

209
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,015
Arlena and I are old
sparring partners.

210
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,352
Hello, Daphne.

211
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:25,526
- Oh, it's been years.
- Well, a little time, yes.

212
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,364
Years.

213
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,411
Arlena and I were in
the chorus of a show together,

214
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,495
not that I could ever compete.

215
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,243
Even in those days, she could always
throw her legs up in the air

216
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,752
higher than any of us...

217
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,496
...and wider.

218
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,628
Kenneth, this is such a surprise.

219
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,010
When you told me of an island
run by a quaint little landlady

220
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,630
I had no idea it was Daphne Castle.

221
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:54,976
Yes, quite. Daphne,
I wonder if we could go to our rooms.

222
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,477
It's been a long journey.

223
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,598
Oh. Certainly.

224
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,025
Andreas!

225
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,331
If you're short-staffed,
Kenneth can easily carry the bags.

226
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,371
They'll be brought up in a minute.

227
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,666
There'll be cocktails tonight
at eight o'clock.

228
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:27,668
Do have a good, long, peaceful rest,
Arlena.

229
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:41,891
You must be Sir Horace Blatt's friend.
Perhaps... Perhaps you'll sign in.

230
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,950
Oh, so you're the famous
Hercule Poirot, eh?

231
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,666
- You are too amiable, madame.
- Perhaps.

232
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:04,287
I hope you haven't come to practise
your sleuthing games on my guests.

233
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,256
They've all got far too many
skeletons in their cupboards

234
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,000
to join in with enthusiasm.

235
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,049
It's not my intention to derange
you or your guests, madame.

236
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,264
Pendant les vacances
my desires are simply a good valet,

237
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,806
<i>a...tisane de menthe poivrée</i>

238
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,270
at eight o'clock in the morning
precisely,

239
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:26,769
and of course some wax,
some beeswax for my shoes. That's all.

240
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,865
Actually, Gilbert had nothing
to do with the success this season.

241
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,656
Oh, my God, I really don't know
what we are going to do about them.

242
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,497
I really do think that
the Millers have gone too far.

243
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,957
Gilly is my oldest friend,
Rex.

244
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,417
Oh, God,
I didn't know that!

245
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:47,334
- Gilly is Myra's oldest friend.
- I just told him, Odell.

246
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:51,005
Did you hear what Gilbert said
about the Queen?

247
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,172
<i>No.</i>

248
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:56,298
<i>- Well, you see...</i>

249
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,731
Enjoying it?

250
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:10,274
I couldn't have one. This was
delicious, if I could... Thank you.

251
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,065
How about a cocktail,
Monsieur Poirot?

252
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,034
White Lady, a Sidecar,
Mainbrace or Between the Sheets?

253
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:21,372
No, if I could have a créme de Cassie
or a sirop de banana.

254
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:25,710
- Do you have banana syrup?
- Certainly.

255
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,544
<i>Oh, my!</i>

256
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,756
I'm the last to arrive!

257
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,001
Have a sausage, dear.

258
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:38,256
You must be famished, having to wait
all that time in your room.

259
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,011
Have you... Have you met the Redferns?
Christine and Patrick.

260
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:47,523
- Arlena, darling...
- Arlena, my favourite leading lady!

261
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,065
Why, if it isn't Odell and Myra!

262
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,358
What on earth are you two doing here?

263
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,775
It's wonderful to see you, Arlena.
We have a fabulous show for you.

264
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,901
Oh, it's a real humdinger, honey!

265
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:04,123
Odell insisted that we both come over
here together to see you personally.

266
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,290
Well, it's very sweet of you.
But I'm sort of retired, you know.

267
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,914
This is my new audience.
Have you met my husband?

268
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,040
How do you do?

269
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,795
How do you do? You'll change your mind.
You won't be able to resist this!

270
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,799
Keeler's mad to do it. But we're
holding her off until you have a look.

271
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,096
And Kern,
he's done some of the best music...

272
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:26,266
Arlena, darling, it's simply
sensational to see you again!

273
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:29,015
- Hello, Rex.
- How do you do? I'm Kenneth Marshall...

274
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,562
Excuse me.
I must talk to you, Arlena darling.

275
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,153
Not now, Rexy-poo.

276
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,688
Thank you.

277
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:36,939
Cheers.

278
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,951
Good morning, Linda.
How is your lovely mother?

279
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,571
She's not lovely
and she's not my mother.

280
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,118
Darling, didn't anyone ever tell you

281
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,836
that peevishness is unbecoming
in young ladies?

282
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:37,254
No. But they told me not to
talk to very strange men.

283
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,174
Morning, Gardeners!

284
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,969
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning, Arlena.

285
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,723
I think it's gonna be a hot day.

286
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,770
Good morning Mrs Redfern.

287
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,072
Well, well, she's in wonderful shape.

288
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:04,410
Yeah. How much was it we paid
Kleinfield, Klausewitz and Stummerhoppen

289
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,154
to contest
that phoney doctor's certificate?

290
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,747
$20,000.

291
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,035
Arlena, darling,
you look quite divine in that outfit.

292
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,208
Say no more. It's yours. Next question?

293
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,423
There is something
frightfully important

294
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,333
- I have to talk to you about.
- So talk.

295
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,505
It's a bit private.

296
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,421
You heard the little man, Linda.
Scram!

297
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,263
Well, what is it?

298
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,807
Arlena, I was wondering

299
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,898
if you've had a chance to read
the proofs of the biography yet?

300
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,483
Indeed I have, Rex.
I simply couldn't put it down.

301
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,273
I knew you'd love it.

302
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:43,657
What a busy bee you've been researching
exactly where I was born... and when.

303
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,447
Well, there aren't too many stars

304
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,195
were born in Tooting Bec
at the turn of the century.

305
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,540
And the sweet way you wrote about
how I landed my first leading role

306
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,786
<i>in Flames of Eternity.
However did you find out?</i>

307
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,911
I bribed his wife.

308
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,251
<i>- Naughty Rex!</i>

309
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:02,752
Ah, the days of my youth. But I've
shoved all that behind me now, Rex.

310
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,971
Which is exactly what you're going to do
with your lousy book.

311
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,012
But, Arlena darling, you promised.
When we were in New York.

312
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:12,137
I've spent the advance.
I simply must have that release.

313
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,262
Forget it.

314
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,732
You're not going to barbecue me
to keep yourself in sailor suits.

315
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:21,816
But, Arlena, angel,
you must.

316
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,487
I said forget it, I'm not going to
sign that release. And that's final.

317
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,533
You're going to regret this,
Arlene.

318
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,407
That's a promise.

319
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:38,921
Good morning, Mrs Marshall.
Good morning, Mr Brewster.

320
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,518
Hello.

321
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,636
Oh, hello.

322
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:58,312
Oh, Linda, what are doing here?
Acting as chaperone, gooseberry or spy?

323
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,652
I just wanted a chat.
I don't seem to be having much fun.

324
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,654
If it's fun you're looking for,
go play with the jellyfish.

325
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:12,496
Oh, my God!
She runs like a dromedary with dropsy.

326
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,457
<i>Bonjour, madame.</i>

327
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,837
Bitch!

328
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,592
No, no, put me down!

329
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,351
Put me down! No, no, no, no!

330
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,976
I shall cry! I shall, I shall cry!

331
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:48,859
You do not care for the aquatic sports
or the sunbathing, madame.

332
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:53,362
I wish I could. But I don't go brown.
I sort of resemble a cassata.

333
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,582
Pink skin, white blisters,
and green in the face.

334
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,201
Unlike your husband, I observe.

335
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,920
No, he manages those things rather well.

336
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,881
Sometimes I think he must think
I'm an awful goose.

337
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,968
But why, madame?
I do not indulge in those sports myself

338
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:12,761
and yet I assure you,
I am very far from being... a goose.

339
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,179
Ah, there you are, Monsieur Poirot.

340
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,650
I've just had a telephone call
from your friend, Sir Horace.

341
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,948
He says he's having trouble with his...
piffle valve?

342
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,323
Ha! Such a valve still
has to be invented, madame.

343
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,451
Well, I dare say you're right,
I wasn't paying attention.

344
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,829
Anyway, the result is,
he'll be 24 hours late.

345
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,797
Good morning, Kenneth.

346
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,929
Are you going for a swim?

347
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,720
The water is so hot,
the lobsters are coming out red.

348
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,388
Good morning.

349
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,353
Come along, Daddy, you promised
to come for a walk with me.

350
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:58,404
Patrick... aren't you getting
a little tired of rowing?

351
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,464
That was last night.
And this morning he starts all over...

352
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,712
Andre... Andre... I don't care.

353
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,757
I don't care if Monsieur Poirot
wants cement on his sausages

354
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,392
or boot-blacking on his butter,
just give it to him!

355
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:24,935
That finicky little Belgian fart
will find it all on his bill anyhow.

356
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,399
- With a vengeance!
- Very well, madame.

357
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:37,034
I'm so sorry. Are we late? Patrick
insisted he row me around the island.

358
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,120
It's bigger than I thought.
Poor darling, he's exhausted.

359
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,784
Not in the least surprised.

360
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,166
I'm sorry we didn't take you with us,
my dear.

361
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,708
The sun would have been
much too strong for you. You know that.

362
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:55,211
Arlena, here you are,
it's the script that I promised you.

363
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,509
No, I thought I told you last night.
I've given up the theatre.

364
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,425
These two are all
I'm concerned with now.

365
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:06,313
<i>- What's it called anyway?
- ft"s Not Right And It's Not Fair.</i>

366
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,148
Sounds like a black man's left leg.

367
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:37,317
- It's alright, Mr Poirot.
- Pardon, madame. Je m'excuse.

368
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,529
Please stay.

369
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,620
<i>I'm just being silly.</i>

370
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,787
I wish I had more self-control,
didn't show what I feel.

371
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,212
Well, that is sometimes
not easy for the ladies.

372
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,841
Do you know what I am most sick of
in this place?

373
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,551
- What, madame?
- Pity.

374
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,336
I can't bear to be pitied.

375
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,762
Everyone round here
seems to feel so sorry for me.

376
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,643
I can tell it
by the way they look at me.

377
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,388
"Poor little thing," they're saying.

378
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:15,359
"What she has to put up with, with
that poor fool of a husband of hers."

379
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:19,730
"What a pity she's not strong enough
to compete for what she wants."

380
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:23,450
Will you allow me to tell you something,
madame?

381
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,571
The Arlena Stuarts of
this world do not count.

382
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:29,244
Their domination is of
the moment.

383
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:35,417
Really, to count, a woman
must have either goodness or brains.

384
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:39,758
You can't actually believe that men care
for either of those things, can you?

385
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,673
Oh, yes, I do, madame.

386
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,049
Your husband loves you.

387
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,969
I know that.

388
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:52,726
Come, let us take a little promenade.
Hmm?

389
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,035
How I wish I could do that,
just lie in the sun.

390
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,878
<i>Mais pourquoi, madame?</i>

391
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,750
Look at them lying in rows,
like corpses in the morgue!

392
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,798
They are not men and women.
Nothing personal about them.

393
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,390
They're just bodies, butcher's meat,
steaks grilling in the sun.

394
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:34,722
I'm sorry, Mr Poirot,
I suffer from vertigo.

395
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,940
I can't bear to look down
from a height.

396
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:41,312
I'm better now.
In fact I am determined to enjoy myself.

397
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:47,364
It's so blissful here, so tranquil,
so far from all violence and trouble.

398
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,284
Yes, you are right, madame.

399
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,749
The sky is blue, the sun is shining,

400
00:33:54,866 --> 00:34:01,420
and yet you forget that everywhere
there is evil under the sun.

401
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,200
You're going to be late for dinner,
you know.

402
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,198
Yes, I know.

403
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,701
Just having a bit of a think.

404
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,248
About Arlena?

405
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,378
I suppose it's no use
saying it's your own fault.

406
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,590
- Not much...
- No, it never is.

407
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,931
How about, "You've made your bed,
now you must lie on it"?

408
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,345
- Worse.
- Thought it might be.

409
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,888
- Poor Kenneth. You do pick 'em.
- Oh, I can cope.

410
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,477
- Do you think Linda can?
- What do you mean?

411
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,900
She's always on at that poor child,
bitching the hell out of her.

412
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,318
Yes. Yes, a pity about that.

413
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,951
Linda's like... like her mother,
you see, she takes things hard.

414
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,787
- Why don't you do something about it?
- Like what?

415
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,158
Like fixing up a divorce, for instance.
People do it all the time.

416
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,036
With most of my friends
it's a full-time occupation.

417
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,335
Arlena's alright.
She just adores to flirt, that's all.

418
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,175
There's nothing in it.
It's all on the spur of the moment.

419
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:31,305
Spur of the moment?
You really are blind.

420
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:35,934
Who the hell do you think booked Patrick
Redfern in here in the first place?

421
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,557
You don't mean...?

422
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,473
I'm afraid so.

423
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,314
Even so. With me, a deal is a deal.

424
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:51,157
I don't approve of quick marriage
and easy divorce.

425
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,990
Arlena is my wife.
That's all there is to it.

426
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,780
Till death do you part?

427
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,704
Exactly.

428
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,208
I see.

429
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,180
Well?

430
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,813
I could just kill that cow!

431
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,735
Well, what the hell do we do now, Odell?

432
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,570
Just leave it to me.

433
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,408
- I'll think of something.
- Hm! My hero.

434
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:41,909
I swear, if you were a man,
I would divorce you.

435
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,421
Hello, darling! You'd better get
a move on. Where have you been?

436
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,794
I've just been having a word
with Daphne.

437
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,172
You get on like a house on fire
with her, don't you?

438
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,843
She's a nice lady.

439
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:02,263
Yes, I suppose she is.
As hotel proprietors go.

440
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,694
And you get on rather well with Redfern,
don't you?

441
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,064
He's a nice fellow.

442
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:16,068
Yes, I suppose he is, as gigolos go.

443
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,160
What's that supposed to mean?

444
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,781
You liked him well enough
when you met him in London.

445
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,699
I never set eyes on the man before.

446
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:26,374
Really?
I could have sworn you were there.

447
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,792
It must have been
your regimental dinner.

448
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,665
Well, anyway, what does it matter?

449
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,669
He just happens to be a guest here
who took me for a boat ride.

450
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,387
He just happens to be a guest here,
Arlena,

451
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,724
because you just happened
to book him in.

452
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,559
The bitch Daphne!

453
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,818
Christine,
I refuse to talk about it!

454
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,733
That's rich!
You don't want to talk about it?

455
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,448
Look here,
I can't even speak to a woman

456
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,944
without you jumping to the conclusion
that I'm having an affair!

457
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:02,322
Aren't you? You leave me
here alone and go off with her.

458
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,245
I'm the laughing stock of the hotel.

459
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,709
Of course you're not!
How ridiculous!

460
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,246
Arlena and I are just good friends,
that's all!

461
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,340
I don't believe you!
Please, let's just go away.

462
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:15,381
<i>I absolutely refuse.
Here we are and here we stay!</i>

463
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,051
- If you don't like it you can...
- Yes, what can I do?

464
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:29,141
Well, I'm looking forward to having
a nice little chat with you, Patrick.

465
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,688
Oh, Myra, that is so beautiful.

466
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,029
- How's your drink?
- Incredible.

467
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,325
<i>- How are you?</i>

468
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,118
Too much sun?

469
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,523
<i>- Good!</i>

470
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,941
That's enough, Linda.
It's adult time. Off to bed.

471
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,065
Come on, darling. Let her stay.
She is on holiday after all.

472
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,032
Scram, Cinderella.

473
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:30,373

That was terrific!

493
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,089
Isn't she wonderful?

494
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,504
Wonderful!
Wonderful!

495
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,905
Mademoiselle!

496
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,675
Abracadabra!

497
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,482
I know how you did that.

498
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,145
The egg's in your top pocket.

499
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,401
I'm not five years old,
you know.

500
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,704
- Been for a bathe, darling?
- What's it look like?

501
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,954
Darling, there is no
need to be snappy

502
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,957
just because you went to bed
bright and early last night.

503
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,685
I always keep mine
behind my ear.

504
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,267
What?

505
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,659
Oh, there you are!
I was looking for you.

506
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,575
I'm going sketching at Gull Cove.
Would you like to come?

507
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,034
Yes, I'd love to.

508
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,374
I'll see you down in the hall
in ten minutes.

509
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,744
Ah, hello, Mr Poirot.

510
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:31,534
Monsieur Poirot,
just the man!

511
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,530
Would you be very kind
and help me push this out?

512
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:37,373
You require assistance,
madame?

513
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,495
It's like trying to launch
the Mauritania.

514
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,496
Without the Champagne!

515
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,463
Thank you so much.
Oh...

516
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:55,808
And, Monsieur Poirot, please
don't tell anyone where I've gone.

517
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:59,304
- Everyone will keep following me about.
- Everyone, madame?

518
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,520
Perhaps some people more than others,
but I just want to be alone.

519
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,028
- Voilá.
- Enjoy your swim.

520
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:58,454
<i>There she goes.
Not a care in the world!</i>

521
00:44:58,571 --> 00:44:59,788
I'll make her care.

522
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,541
Oh, what do you know about care?
If it'd been up to you,

523
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,502
the good Samaritan would've passed by
on the other side.

524
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,543
I have an idea,
but I need to work it out.

525
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,542
Well, don't forget about my cousin,
Hatty Heimenheimer.

526
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,260
It took her so long
to "work out an idea",

527
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:17,132
they finally had to stash her away
in the booby hatch!

528
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,428
Odell?

529
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,268
Odell?

530
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:42,248
- Hey, hey, hey. Where's the fire?
- Sorry.

531
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:46,086
- Have you had your breakfast?
- Had a piece of toast.

532
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,546
Linda, you really are naughty.

533
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:52,463
Andreas goes to all the trouble of
preparing decent English breakfasts

534
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:57,430
instead of those weedy
continental things and you eat toast.

535
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,469
I'm sorry, I just wasn't hungry.

536
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,176
What's the matter?

537
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,559
Is it Arlena?

538
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:11,778
- She's so beastly.
- You don't want to worry about her.

539
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:15,190
Things have a habit
of working out.

540
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,567
- I promise you.
- Yes, if you make them.

541
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,662
Would you like to come for a
stroll to the lighthouse?

542
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,624
This must be my lucky day.
I've never been in such demand.

543
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,162
I'd like to, but I can't.

544
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,707
I've got a date
to go sketching with Christine.

545
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,752
That's alright.
I'm glad to see you're making friends.

546
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,379
- Good morning, Kenneth.
- Ah, good morning.

547
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,629
Morning, darling.

548
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,428
There's a letter for you.
The boatman brought it over.

549
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,142
Ah, thank you.

550
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,645
Seeing your daughter
has just turned me down,

551
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,516
would you like to come for a walk with
me, before my staff meeting at 11:30?

552
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,441
I'd love to, but I'm afraid I can't.
This must be answered straight away.

553
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,610
This isn't my lucky day, Linda.

554
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:01,027
You can't get away from me at 12:30.
We're playing tennis. Remember?

555
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,870
I remember.

556
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:05,456
By the way, Linda,
have you seen your mother?

557
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:08,702
- No, thank God.
- Linda, I won't tell you again...

558
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,797
Clean it, clean it.
Don't just lean on the thing.

559
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:18,928
Here we all are.

560
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,767
Well... Well, what a...
colourful outfit!

561
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:27,603
Oh! Oh,
I'm so glad you like it.

562
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,439
Linda and I
are going off sketching, Mr Marshall.

563
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:34,436
Don't worry, I'll take good care of her.
See you on the tennis courts at 12:30.

564
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,483
- Bye, Daddy.
- Have a nice time.

565
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:42,072
Morning, Poirot.
Been swimming?

566
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,161
- You saw me?
- No.

567
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,246
Yes, I have been swimming!

568
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:49,789
There's nothing like the shock of
cold water and rhythmic movement

569
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,911
to stimulate the
little grey cells.

570
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:56,003
Yes, of course. I don't suppose
you've seen my wife about, have you?

571
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,717
- Madame Marshall?
- Hmm.

572
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,634
- What, she rose so early?
- She's not in our rooms.

573
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:07,018
Oh, by the way, I was looking for
that fellow Redfern earlier.

574
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,761
I don't suppose you've seen him?

575
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,854
Is someone taking my name in vain?

576
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,559
A very good morning to you, gentlemen.

577
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,538
What kind of paintings do you do,
Mrs Redfern?

578
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,753
- Call me Christine.
- Thank you.

579
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,573
Hi, Patrick! Going for a spin?

580
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,038
How about taking me along?

581
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,326
Er... well...

582
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,222
What time is it, dear?

583
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,764
Five to 12.

584
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,312
Lord, I must fly.

585
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,232
I'm playing tennis at 12:30.

586
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,168
That's a fine boat!

587
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:08,293
I think it belongs to
Sir Horace Blatt.

588
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:12,923
Odell and I were on it once, I think.

589
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:25,318
Look. I wonder who that is.

590
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:29,151
You know exactly who it is,
you naughty boy!

591
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,319
Would you be a sport
and take the boat back?

592
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,317
I'll come back with Arlena,
I'll walk.

593
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:36,446
Are you kidding?
I don't know how to work this thing.

594
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,823
Look, it's simple,
this lever puts you in gear

595
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,582
and all you have to
do is steer.

596
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,953
Well, just this once.
But don't get me involved.

597
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:45,751
You're a sport.

598
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:01,641
Boo!

599
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,264
Hey, come on,
wake up!

600
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,492
Oh, my God!

601
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,116
What's the matter?

602
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,336
She's dead!

603
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,624
She's been murdered!

604
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,082
- Strangled!
- Strangled?

605
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:35,596
- It's just not possible.
- We'd better get some help!

606
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:41,185
- I'll go. You'll stay with the body.
- Are you kidding? I can't do that!

607
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:45,181
You're right. The murderer
may still be about somewhere.

608
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:48,855
- Can you make it back to the hotel?
- In a flash. This thing's no problem.

609
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,603
You'd better hurry!

610
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:10,460
Madame Marshall
has been strangled.

611
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:16,338
There are contusion marks on the head
and the neck. This much is evident.

612
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,256
We must now send for the police

613
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:22,976
and acquire a doctor
in order to establish the time of death.

614
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,188
Have you ever met a Tyranian doctor,
Monsieur Poirot?

615
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:30,401
The limit of their skill is determining
the fitness of an ox to pull a cart.

616
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,316
That may be so, madame, but

617
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:38,159
Dear Monsieur Poirot,
a word in your ear.

618
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:42,951
The whole world knows that you are a man
of enormous discretion and gallantry,

619
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:46,458
a man not only privy to the secrets of
kings and prime ministers,

620
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:50,330
but also a man who would never willingly
stand by and see a lady in trouble

621
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:51,873
without rushing to her aid.

622
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:55,217
I appeal to you now, as just such
a frail woman, in need of help.

623
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,928
In fact I throw myself
on your mercy.

624
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,924
Couldn't we make this
a private investigation?

625
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:04,018
You know how peculiar people can be
about a spot of murder.

626
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:08,348
The scandal of a
famous stage star...

627
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:11,021
...being murdered here
would ruin my hotel.

628
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,019
I'm very sorry, madame,

629
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:19,822
but there is no way to avoid
this becoming an official matter.

630
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:23,412
In due course of time,
of course I quite agree,

631
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,782
when it can be released
in the proper manner.

632
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:29,794
But consider, just think what everyone
will say if they were to discover

633
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:35,633
that you were here ahead of the police
and failed to solve the crime.

634
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:41,589
I mean, Monsieur Poirot,
both our reputations are at stake.

635
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,603
I bet it pongs something rotten
in there.

636
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,644
Only of the breath
of the sea.

637
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,564
Oh, how poetic you are,
Monsieur Poirot.

638
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:58,610
You have the true soul of France.

639
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,482
The true soul of Belgium, madame.

640
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,611
Yes, of course.
How mortifyingly stupid of me!

641
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:07,330
- Oh, do please forgive me.
- In due course of time.

642
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,288
<i>What do you say, monsieur?</i>

643
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:15,381
Will you bring your colossal brain power
to the aid of a lady in distress?

644
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,545
Will you clear up this hideous mess
for me

645
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:22,388
with all the brilliance and discretion
for which you are world famous?

646
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:26,384
One moment, madame. I must carry out
a little investigation of my own

647
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,602
before answering your question.

648
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:30,554
Monsieur Redfern.

649
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:34,274
At what time did you
and Madame Gardener find the body?

650
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,143
It was 12 o'clock exactly.

651
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:39,522
That bloody gun went off as we
were coming round these rocks there.

652
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,024
I sent Mrs Gardener back
for help immediately.

653
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,402
I touched nothing except
to check she was dead.

654
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,995
Oh, yes, you acted quite correctly.

655
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,662
Well, since I was the last person
to see Madame Marshall alive,

656
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:56,505
when I pushed her off in her pedalo at
about 10:20, it means the time of death

657
00:56:56,663 --> 00:57:01,169
can be established as being
between 10:30 and 12 noon.

658
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:05,047
How absolutely brilliant!

659
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,850
A doctor after all could only give us
an approximate time

660
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:13,814
and how she was killed, which I know.
I don't need the help of a doctor.

661
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,942
<i>Messieurs!</i>

662
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,794
It's a terrible tragedy, Poirot.
It's terrible.

663
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:49,971
She may have been a bit flighty, Arlena,
but no one would've wished this on her.

664
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,220
Just between ourselves,

665
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:55,188
you may have guessed,
but she was the lady in question.

666
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:59,856
- That was not too difficult to guess.
- I suppose it bloody wasn't.

667
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:04,944
Well, I'd best chalk it all up
to experience and be on me way.

668
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:08,740
There's no point in intruding
in the grief of the new husband

669
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,112
and all that sort of thing.

670
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:13,286
You had no chance
to speak to Madame Arlena?

671
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,077
Of course not.
I've only just arrived, haven't I?

672
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,624
Yes, of course.

673
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:22,420
There's only one thing
that puzzles me in that case.

674
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:26,011
You remember the false diamond
I left in your possession?

675
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,129
Yes.

676
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:31,634
How did I happen to find it once again
on the beach near the dead woman?

677
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:41,060
Oh, dammit, Poirot.
I'd make a right murderer, wouldn't I?

678
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,232
Leaving clues all over the place, eh?

679
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:48,234
- Alright, I confess
- You confess?

680
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,861
I mean I confess I had a word with her.

681
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:55,332
I was coming in on the boat and I saw
Arlena on one of them pedal things

682
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:57,497
going into a beach along there.

683
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,503
Anyway, I stopped the boat
and I rowed meself over.

684
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:06,092
It's better than confronting her
in front of her husband, you know.

685
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:10,840
We had a bit of a barney, what with her
pretending to be all surprised and that.

686
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,592
Anyroad, she promised to sort
it out by tonight.

687
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:16,937
She did not tell you
where the real jewel was?

688
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,397
No, dammit, she didn't.

689
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,058
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get changed.

690
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:24,858
I'm getting a little chilly,
what with the shock and everything.

691
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,982
I was very fond of Arlena,
as you well know.

692
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,359
Yes, you may well have
been, monsieur.

693
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:33,909
And yet there are cases of men
that have killed those women

694
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:38,876
who made it impossible for them to
return to the wives they really loved.

695
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,336
Well, I assure you,
that is not the case here.

696
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,623
I could have taken off
at any time I wanted.

697
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,966
Anyway you know I had
nothing to do with it.

698
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:50,259
You yourself saw me from the terrace
go off in the boat with Mrs Gardener.

699
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,971
<i>Oui, c'est exacte.</i>

700
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:56,344
It would seem
that I am your alibi, monsieur.

701
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:58,345
Please go and get changed.

702
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:06,649
So, that young man's been
sniffing round Arlena, has he?

703
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,647
Can't say I blame him.

704
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:11,946
I'm sorry, Sir Horace,
but it's my duty to put it to you

705
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:14,286
that you were furious
with Madame Arlena,

706
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,825
that you were determined
to get your jewel back,

707
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,082
you came up here in
order to demand it.

708
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,701
She laughed in your face.

709
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:24,000
You lost your temper,
you strangled her...

710
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,795
That is poppycock!
That is bloody poppycock!

711
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:31,796
If it is poppycock, then it's most
regrettable that you said in front of me

712
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,346
that you would willingly
"wring her neck".

713
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,686
Oh, that were...
That was just a bit of chat, that's all.

714
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:47,194
Look. All I did was tell her that
she couldn't make a monkey out of me

715
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,108
and I threw that bit
of glass at her.

716
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:52,821
Look, if I had killed her, my crew
would have seen me, wouldn't they?

717
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,693
They were all on deck,
watching.

718
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,537
Not averse to clocking
a decent bit of crumpet, my lads.

719
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:59,539
It's the only thing that wakes them up.

720
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:02,042
So, if you don't believe me,
ask them.

721
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:08,799
Trés bien. All the same, I must ask you
not to leave the island for the moment.

722
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,588
If you insist.

723
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:16,307
But if I were you, Poirot,
I would cherchez le hubby.

724
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:21,804
You'll find they're favourite when
dealing with the Arlenas of this world.

725
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,815
It's a little difficult to accept
your condolences, Poirot,

726
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,692
when in the same breath
you accuse me of murdering my wife

727
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,285
because she was unfaithful.

728
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,154
I can understand that, of course.

729
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,074
But I hope you realise that
I'm rather easier to get on with

730
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,998
than the Tyranian
police would be.

731
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,540
And therefore I will ask you

732
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:50,003
where you were between
11:00 and 12:00 this morning.

733
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,750
Very simple.
I was in here typing.

734
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:54,170
I changed for tennis
a few minutes after 12:00.

735
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,262
How very curious.

736
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:03,012
Because, you know, when I passed by your
door at what must have been about 11:15,

737
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,060
- I heard no sound.
- I can't help that.

738
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:09,606
One does occasionally pause to think,
you know.

739
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:13,321
Here.
This is what I typed.

740
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:16,282
As you can see,
it would have taken at least an hour.

741
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,323
With respect,
you could've typed that yesterday.

742
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,913
There's no proof
that you typed it this morning.

743
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:24,203
Excuse me, Monsieur Poirot,

744
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:28,124
I just couldn't help overhearing.
I have the proof you need.

745
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,088
- You do, madame?
- Yes.

746
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:33,459
Every week it's my custom
to collect all my staff together,

747
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,468
give them a collective
boot up the bum.

748
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,509
It does no end of good,
particularly the Eyeties.

749
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,509
Keeps them up to snuff,
as my old papa used to say.

750
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:44,136
Anyway, that meeting was this morning
at 11:30,

751
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:47,856
and just before it I came up here to
have a wash and I poked my nose in here

752
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:51,694
and I saw Kenneth hard at it,
so I... I just didn't disturb him.

753
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:57,198
But, madame,
you cannot see the desk from the door.

754
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:03,614
I saw him in the mirror.

755
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,075
In the mir...

756
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,290
Oh, in the mirror!

757
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,921
My goodness, you do type fast, Ken.

758
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,173
You must be the Horowitz of
the Remington.

759
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:26,603
Tell me, madame,
how many fingers am I holding up?

760
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,733
Three.

761
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,109
Yes. And now how many?

762
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,738
Well, that...
that's not fair, you're hiding.

763
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:48,037
You cannot see in the mirror
someone seated at the desk.

764
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:52,379
It is not me that is hiding,
it is you who are lying.

765
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:58,002
Now, Monsieur Marshall, are you,
by any chance, lying also?

766
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:02,173
It should be fairly obvious, Poirot,
that that letter, all eight pages of it,

767
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,933
is in reply to this one
from my stockbroker,

768
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:08,429
which arrived by this morning's post
at about 10:30.

769
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:11,018
It should, therefore, be equally obvious

770
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,642
that I must have typed it
when I said I did.

771
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,607
Yes, it would appear so.

772
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:20,608
Now to revert to you again, madame.
I would like to ask you a question

773
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:23,531
about your promenade
to the lighthouse this morning.

774
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,619
You went alone, I believe?

775
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,330
Yes, I did.

776
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:32,419
And you must have passed the bay
on which Arlena was murdered?

777
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:36,832
Yes. Yes, I did.
I also saw Arlena sunning herself.

778
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:41,507
Oh, but then you must have
taken the same path home.

779
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:44,097
<i>There is no logical alternative.</i>

780
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,137
<i>And I am suggesting to you,</i>

781
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,476
<i>you could have gone down to the beach,</i>

782
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,561
<i>murdered Arlena Marshall</i>

783
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:55,605
<i>and still been in time
for your staff meeting at 11:30.</i>

784
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:59,320
What utter balderdash! You can't
possibly think I'd want to kill Arlena

785
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,657
just because the silly cow
succeeded on the boards and I didn't.

786
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,489
No, that I do not think.

787
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:08,113
But there is a certain tenderness
between you and Monsieur Marshall.

788
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:12,038
Otherwise why take that absurd risk
of trying to protect him just now?

789
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,669
What if there is?
What does it matter?

790
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:18,541
It matters because
Madame Arlena was in the way.

791
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:21,214
Monsieur Poirot, you have
the French obsession...

792
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,304
<i>I'm sorry, Belgian obsession,
with crime passionnel.</i>

793
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:27,095
But you're barking up the wrong tree.

794
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,933
You see, I know, I know who did it.

795
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,644
Oh! You do, madame?

796
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,729
Of course.
It was Sir Horace Blatt.

797
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:37,351
When I came back here
from my walk at about 11:15,

798
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,148
I saw him down on the beach.

799
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,780
He was jumping up and down
and screaming blue murder at Arlena.

800
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,820
I've never seen a fellow in such a fury.

801
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:48,328
Why did not you tell me this before,
madame?

802
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:51,790
He is an old chum, isn't he? I didn't
know then you were going to start

803
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,409
hurling accusations at me and Kenneth.

804
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:57,959
But he is the chap you want. Why
don't you run along and question him?

805
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,795
Yes. I already have done, madame.

806
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:04,340
And he is exonerated by his crew.

807
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,135
All the same,
his story does confirm yours.

808
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:10,225
Without knowing it, you have
corroborated your own alibi.

809
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,184
Bravo, madame.

810
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,940
I'm sorry, Kenneth.
I nearly put you in it.

811
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:18,683
I was only trying to help.

812
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,937
I know. I forgive you.

813
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,993
I don't want
to hear any more, Patrick.

814
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,829
If you hadn't been poodlefaking
with that awful woman,

815
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,324
you wouldn't have been there
in the first place.

816
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:36,952
Oh, madame.

817
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:40,330
May I have a quick word with you?
About how you spent this morning.

818
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:45,085
Why me?
I've got nothing to do with all this.

819
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:48,805
You had no reason to love
Arlena Marshall, madame.

820
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,139
Perhaps not.

821
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,134
But I was with Linda all morning.

822
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,932
I went to her room early to ask her

823
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:58,182
to come to Gull Cove to do
some sketching, she wasn't there.

824
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:01,526
I mean, she came along a few moments
later. She'd been swimming.

825
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,858
And then we set off
and we were there all morning.

826
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,607
If you don't believe me, ask Linda.
She'll tell you...

827
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:10,781
- Calmez vous, madame.
- Mr Poirot, I'm alright now

828
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:15,373
I want you to think about this
very, very carefully.

829
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:19,245
At what time precisely did you
leave the cove this morning?

830
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,630
I was there until 12 o'clock
and I went off for my tennis game.

831
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:25,751
- You had a watch?
- No. No, I didn't.

832
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,469
Then how did you know it was
precisely 12 o'clock?

833
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:33,592
Because, well, when I climbed to the top
of the cliff and was waving to Linda,

834
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,185
<i>who'd gone for a swim,
that awful gun went off.</i>

835
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:39,727
<i>The one they fire at noon eve/y day.</i>

836
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:42,145
<i>What did you do then, madame?</i>

837
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:44,770
<i>Well, I was late, you
see, for my tennis</i>

838
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,487
<i>which was fixed for 12:30,</i>

839
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:49,115
<i>so I simply tore back to the hotel
as fast as I could</i>

840
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,030
<i>and changed into my tennis things.</i>

841
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,369
<i>And I went to the court
where I met the others.</i>

842
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,865
<i>Mr Marshall, Mrs Castle
and Mr Gardener.</i>

843
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,704
<i>I played with Mr Gardener:</i>

844
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,953
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Not at all, my dear.

845
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,705
I was sketching at Gull Cove.
Lost track of the time.

846
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:06,879
Don't worry. It's only a matter of
four minutes exactly.

847
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,718
I'm afraid you have to play with me.

848
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,132
<i>We'd barely started</i>

849
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:13,473
when the news about
Arlena came.

850
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,809
Of course,
it's a dreadful thing, Mr Poirot,

851
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,053
but I can't pretend
that I'm not...

852
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,396
A little relieved.

853
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,857
Well, I can understand that.

854
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:26,478
Is there anything else you want to ask?

855
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,697
Not for the time being.

856
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:36,529
Come in.

857
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,166
- Hello.
- Hello.

858
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:47,086
Excuse me, mademoiselle,
for intruding into your grief.

859
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:51,962
Grief? That's a good one.
Why should I be sorry for Arlena?

860
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,718
You hated her so much?

861
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,388
I'm glad she's dead
if that's what you mean.

862
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:00,850
She was horrid to me
and beastly to my daddy.

863
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,934
Would you mind if I ask you
a few questions about this morning?

864
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:09,529
Why should I?
I was with Christine Redfern.

865
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:13,367
She wanted to go to Gull Cove
to draw some stupid cliffs.

866
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:14,484
And did she?

867
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:18,580
Oh, yes. She sat under her big hat
while I sunbathed.

868
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,165
She gets all blistered
if she sits out in the sun.

869
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,955
- Yes.
- It's bad luck really.

870
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:27,372
Here it is. She gave it to me.
It's not bad really.

871
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:33,379
No, she has talent, that one.
These are undeniably, er... cliffs.

872
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,676
When did she leave you?

873
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:38,300
- Five to 12.
- How can you be so sure?

874
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:41,052
Because she asked me.

875
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,054
What time is it, dear?

876
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:46,808
Five to 12.

877
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:50,858
Lord, I must fly!
I'm playing tennis at 12:30.

878
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:54,107
<i>She got into a fearful panic
about being late for tennis</i>

879
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:55,905
<i>and rushed off back to the hotel.</i>

880
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,653
- Would you like this?
- Thanks. It's super.

881
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:01,914
I'll see you later after my swim.

882
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,706
<i>I remember I was halfway down the beach
when Christine called after me.</i>

883
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:07,545
Don't forget your bathing cap!

884
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:09,335
<i>I'd forgotten my bathing cap,</i>

885
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:12,250
<i>so I had to come back and put it on.
What a bore!</i>

886
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:18,761
Did you see anyone else
while you were swimming?

887
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:23,929
No, no one. Apart that is from Christine
waving from the top of the cliff.

888
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:33,564
Look! Why don't you stop asking me all
these silly questions about Christine?

889
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:36,908
She couldn't have murdered Arlena.
Neither could I.

890
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:40,198
That slimy Rex Brewster's
the one you should be talking to.

891
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,165
He hated Arlena. He's the one
who really wanted her dead.

892
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:46,831
How can you say that?
He admired her so much.

893
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,498
Don't be daft!

894
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:52,590
He'd written this filthy book about her
which she wouldn't allow him to publish.

895
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,711
Excuse me, mademoiselle,
but how do you know all this?

896
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,839
I heard them having a row about it
on the beach yesterday.

897
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,341
They thought I'd gone away,
but I hadn't.

898
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:05,596
Maybe he won't be able to publish it
if he's hanged for murder first.

899
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,312
If I can't see you faces shining
in every knife, fork and spoon,

900
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:11,980
I'll have your guts for garters!

901
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:15,864
Madame! Have you any idea
where I can find Monsieur Brewster?

902
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:19,075
Rex? I thought I saw him
go out into the garden.

903
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,944
Oh, but...

904
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:24,322
He's not the one you want.
You should cherchez la femme.

905
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:25,448
Really, madame?

906
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:29,040
Absolutely, I have been having
a little think, and I worked it all out.

907
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,380
If Horace Blatt is in the clear
and Kenneth Marshall is in the clear

908
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:34,340
and I'm... I'm in the clear,

909
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:38,883
and Patrick Redfern is in the clear and
Myra Gardener because she was with him.

910
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:42,428
Then it's all down to
little Miss Cringe, isn't it?

911
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:43,674
Miss Cringe?

912
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,976
Yes. The jealous wife,
Christine Redfern.

913
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:50,723
Don't believe all that
about her being too weedy.

914
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,476
Women fight like tigers
when losing their husbands.

915
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:55,729
Not that I've had much experience
in that.

916
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:59,866
But what is your theory?
I mean, how did Madame Christine do it?

917
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:03,244
I don't know. Probably battered
Arlena with a bit of driftwood,

918
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:06,831
then finished her off with a little
pressure on the... carotid artery?

919
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:09,201
The artery there,
yes, yes.

920
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:12,044
Everyone knows that.
It's in all the crime novels.

921
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:16,211
In fact, only the other day a child of
11 did something like that, in Hungary.

922
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:20,178
Or was it Crete? I don't know...
Anyway, she used a pair of nutcrackers.

923
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:23,719
I know. Perhaps I'd better go
and see if any are missing...

924
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,641
Madame, unfortunately, there are
no nutcracker marks on the throat.

925
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:32,015
And Madame Christine
could not possibly have done it.

926
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:38,522
Her alibi had been confirmed by
Mademoiselle Linda, and vice versa.

927
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:42,113
How very irritating!

928
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:48,161
<i>"Under the high... lazy...</i>

929
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:54,667
...noonday Adriatic sun...

930
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:59,133
...the body lay on its back,
arms outstretched,

931
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:05,132
parodying in death a position
she so often occupied in life."

932
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:08,351
Oh.
That is marvellous, that's...

933
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:11,346
Oh.

934
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:14,895
So, you've come, Monsieur Poirot,
to question me about poor Arlena.

935
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:19,021
I am shattered.
I am absolutely shattered.

936
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:23,946
She was so wonderfully funny,
so very generous...

937
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,034
Not generous enough
to give you a release

938
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:29,031
so that you could publish
that manuscript, eh?

939
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:30,156
Who told you that?

940
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,534
Never mind, but it is the truth,
n'est-ce pas?

941
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,080
You cannot libel the dead.

942
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:39,958
Now you are free to publish
your saucy tales and reap the reward.

943
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:44,178
Well, I would admit, from that
point of view, I have benefitted.

944
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:48,971
Oh, but I assure you, monsieur,
that the loss of so radiant a performer

945
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:53,312
infinitely exceeds
any possible gain to myself.

946
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,477
You must believe that.

947
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:59,603
The time of death has been narrowed
to between 11:30 and 12:00.

948
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:01,229
Where were you at this time?

949
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,113
I was on a pedalo.

950
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,243
A pedalo?

951
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:10,029
Whereabouts?

952
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:14,913
How should I know?
I wasn't carrying a chart at the time.

953
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:17,503
Oh, que c'est amusant.
How amusing that is!

954
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:21,750
Chart or no chart, it was perfectly
possible for you to have watched

955
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:27,264
<i>Sir Horace Blattk boat leave and then
to have pedaloed into Ladder Bay,</i>

956
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:31,226
<i>there to find the unsuspecting
Arlena asleep,</i>

957
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,433
<i>and then you strangled her.</i>

958
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:38,103
<i>Monsieur Poirot, are you aware
that it would take nearly two hours</i>

959
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:41,649
<i>to paddle around the island
from Ladder Bay to Gull Bay?</i>

960
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:43,279
<i>At 12 o'clock precisely,</i>

961
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:47,321
<i>as that boring old gun went off
I pedalled into Gull Bay.</i>

962
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:49,409
<i>Linda was there, swimming.</i>

963
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:53,998
<i>In fact I nearly hit her, she was
splashing around like a deaf seal.</i>

964
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:56,334
<i>You say
that you saw Mlle Linda</i>

965
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,703
<i>swimming in Gull Bay at 12 o'clock?</i>

966
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,331
<i>Certainly, I asked her
to help me pedal back,</i>

967
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:03,799
but the little charmer refused.

968
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:06,044
What do you want?

969
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:10,302
What did you say?

970
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:14,303
I said, Good god, darling.
Help me pedal this damned thing back.

971
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,679
My legs are killing me.

972
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:17,476
Pedal it back yourself.

973
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:25,397
So you see, darling,
I simply could not have killed Arlena.

974
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,823
Monsieur, if you are so anxious
to find a murderer,

975
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,412
why don't you find out
who tried to murder me?

976
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:38,664
Murder you? What do you mean?

977
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:43,881
Well, after I'd been left by that lazy
little cow Linda to rupture myself,

978
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:44,965
I pedalled off.

979
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,837
<i>About ten minutes later,
a bottle came whizzing over the cliff</i>

980
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,885
<i>and smacked down in the water
fight next to me.</i>

981
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:54,225
<i>The damned thing missed my head
by inches.</i>

982
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,218
<i>I looked up,
there's nobody around.</i>

983
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:04,519
I must congratulate you on that highly
interesting and imaginative story.

984
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:09,695
I refer of course to your visit, your
fictional visit, to Gull Bay at noon.

985
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:13,160
What do you mean "fictional"?
Linda!

986
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:16,451
Mademoiselle Linda denies
having seen anyone there at the time.

987
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:17,789
What?

988
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:20,410
Oh, that lousy little hoyden!

989
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:24,755
I... know she loathes me because I
adored Arlena, but this is ridiculous.

990
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:26,670
You just wait till I catch her...

991
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:28,213
You! Linda!

992
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:32,922
Linda. You... You just wait!
Stay right...

993
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:36,051
Linda! You tell Monsieur Poirot

994
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:39,475
that I was with you this morning
when you were swimming in Gull Cove.

995
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:41,389
Why should I?
You weren't.

996
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:45,059
You lying little brat!

997
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,528
You just tell him that you saw me
on the pedalo.

998
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:50,990
You tell him that you refused to
help me pedal back! You tell him!

999
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,035
- You tell him!
- Take your hands off my daughter!

1000
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:58,031
Then you tell her to tell him the truth!

1001
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,578
Well, Linda, did you see Mr Brewster

1002
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:03,168
when you were bathing in Gull Cove
this morning?

1003
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:12,633
- Oh, alright then, yes, I did.
- Linda, you mustn't tell lies.

1004
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:15,097
You can get people into serious trouble.

1005
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:18,058
Serious trouble? Hell, darling!
You can get them hanged!

1006
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:21,016
That was rather the idea,
was it not, mademoiselle?

1007
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,231
I'm sorry.

1008
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:32,065
Kindly accept my apologies, monsieur.

1009
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:35,068
Incidentally, I accept your alibi.

1010
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,742
That's real white of you,
Mr P!

1011
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:50,841
No, Monsieur Poirot,
I am not as lucky as my dear wife.

1012
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:54,633
I have absolutely no alibi.

1013
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:58,174
I was sitting over there
on a stone bench reading my book

1014
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:02,520
and between the hours of
11:00 and 12:15 I didn't move.

1015
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,638
Now, I'm well aware, Monsieur Poirot,

1016
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:07,812
that in your world,
when a murder takes place

1017
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:11,528
everyone automatically
comes up with a watertight alibi.

1018
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:18,244
However, I belong to that great world
of millions of innocent men and women

1019
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,785
who, curiously enough,
don't have the foresight

1020
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,200
to provide themselves with an alibi

1021
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:28,876
when a murder is taking place
of which they know absolutely nothing.

1022
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:34,093
Consequently, as I
was guilelessly reading my book,

1023
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:39,091
there was no gardener to come trotting
by respectfully touching his forelock

1024
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:42,890
and registering the time
on his grandfather's turnip watch.

1025
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:47,436
In short, Monsieur Poirot,
I don't have the ghost of an alibi.

1026
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:51,606
Of course, I could have scampered over
the top of that peak,

1027
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,571
like a mountain goat, and...

1028
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:59,068
swarmed down the famous steps
we've all heard about,

1029
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:00,820
and then crept up
on Arlena

1030
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:04,916
and strangled her
with these powerful hands of mine.

1031
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:08,127
But, unfortunately for you,
I did no such thing.

1032
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:12,124
You see, I have a big fat motive
but no alibi.

1033
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:17,590
Next question?

1034
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:20,802
Next question is what did you do

1035
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:24,678
when you had finished
being unobserved in the garden?

1036
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:30,104
I went up to my room, again unobserved,
to change for tennis.

1037
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:34,195
I was rather thirsty and so I rang
the bell. Naturally, no one answered.

1038
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:37,155
<i>Where the goddamn staff
had disappeared to was a mystery,</i>

1039
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,901
<i>and worthy even of your talents,
Monsieur Poirot.</i>

1040
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,571
<i>I turned on the tap,
but there was no water, not a drop.</i>

1041
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:48,668
<i>Someone was running a bath
down the hall fit to float Noah's Ark.</i>

1042
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,037
<i>"Damned odd time for a bath,"
I'd have said.</i>

1043
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:53,163
<i>Anyway, I changed</i>

1044
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:56,839
<i>and appeared suitably attired
in my Fred Peny outfit</i>

1045
01:19:56,959 --> 01:20:02,932
<i>on the tennis court at precisely 12:30
to join Daphne and Marshall.</i>

1046
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:06,681
<i>Mrs Redfern came a few minutes later.</i>

1047
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:10,022
And that, Monsieur Poirot...

1048
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,312
concludes the case for the defence.

1049
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:18,314
You make pleasantries, monsieur,
but no alibi is still...

1050
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:21,950
...no alibi.

1051
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:35,373
If you're looking for that,
I've got it in here.

1052
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:39,552
I've been using it to
sort everything out for you.

1053
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,887
I was wrong about
cherchez la femme.

1054
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:44,427
But it's quite obviously
cherchez le fruit.

1055
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:47,518
Rexy is the only one unaccounted for.
Look, I'll show you.

1056
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:51,434
At 11:30 Arlena Marshall was left here
alive by Horace Blatt,

1057
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:55,981
who then sailed on down here. At the
same time, Myra and Patrick were here,

1058
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,524
Linda and Christine were here,
Kenneth was here

1059
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:00,363
and I was in my staff meeting.

1060
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:04,402
It has just got to be
our genial columnist.

1061
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,620
And, what's more, I know how he did it.

1062
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:07,905
Oh, you do, madame?

1063
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:12,001
Absolutely! Recently I was reading a
magazine story about a woman in Malaya

1064
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:16,463
who was drowned by a huge moray eel
which darted out of a hole,

1065
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:21,006
dragged her to the floor of the ocean,
its teeth buried in her throat.

1066
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,174
Now that's what gave me
the clue I needed.

1067
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:28,017
Rex... Rex Brewster could've been
lurking in the water off Ladder Bay,

1068
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:31,512
and when Arlena appeared on her pedalo,
he could have leapt up,

1069
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:33,105
pulled her off it...

1070
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:38,604
Very interesting, madame. The only snag
is that Madame Marshall was not drowned.

1071
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,901
Far less was she gnawed to death...

1072
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:45,447
And perhaps even more damaging
to your theory is the fact

1073
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:49,913
that it has been established that
Monsieur Brewster was here in Gull Cove

1074
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,499
with Mademoiselle Linda at 12 o'clock.

1075
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:55,912
He could not possible have pedalled
all the way from Gull Cove

1076
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:59,666
to Ladder Bay in half an hour.

1077
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:01,667
That's very inconvenient of him.

1078
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,174
I mean, if he didn't do it, who did?

1079
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:08,048
I just don't see who could have.
Everyone has an alibi.

1080
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:09,717
Oh, no, they do not, madame.

1081
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:13,517
Monsieur Gardener does not have an
alibi, seems rather proud of the fact.

1082
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:16,891
Oh, but he does, dear, most definitely.

1083
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:19,109
What are you telling me, madame?

1084
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:21,979
At half past 11
I was having my staff meeting,

1085
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:26,405
giving the hired help
a pleasing stream of the old rancid,

1086
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:28,619
and in particular
pointing out to Andreas

1087
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:32,615
<i>that there was absolutely no point
in making your curry de poulet vindaloo</i>

1088
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:35,709
<i>so hot that it raised welts
on the surface of your tongue,</i>

1089
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:39,251
<i>when I looked out of the window
and there was Odell reading a book.</i>

1090
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:43,217
He stayed there throughout
the entire meeting. I'm positive of it.

1091
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,883
What's the matter?
Have I said something?

1092
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:48,756
You've said a great deal, madame.

1093
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:53,727
<i>Oh, I...
I see what you mean.</i>

1094
01:22:53,844 --> 01:22:56,393
You...
You mean nobody did it.

1095
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:01,603
And yet we still have a body, madame.

1096
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:57,348
- Ah, Rigoletto
- Correct. Ah, Verdi.Quelle élégance!

1097
01:24:57,467 --> 01:25:01,017
It's funny to think, if Giuseppe Verdi
had been an Englishman,

1098
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:05,109
his name would have
been Joe Green.

1099
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:07,398
Yes, I suppose it would,
yes.

1100
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:09,146
It used to make the boys laugh

1101
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:12,400
when I was trying to din some Latin
into them when I was a teacher.

1102
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,777
Little boys laugh easily
if it keeps them away,

1103
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:18,117
even for a moment,
from their study of Latin.

1104
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:25,417
Messieurs-Dames, please forgive me
for interrupting the cocktail hour,

1105
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:28,882
but there are two questions
which I must put to you.

1106
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:34,176
First of all, did anybody here throw
a bottle into the sea this morning?

1107
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:37,300
No?

1108
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:41,850
Secondly, did any of you take a bath
at 12:15 today?

1109
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,473
An odd time for ablutions.

1110
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:48,227
How remarkable!

1111
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:51,738
A bath which nobody admits having taken

1112
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:54,608
and a bottle which flies by itself.

1113
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:58,662
Joe Green...

1114
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:01,619
It's rather more amusing
than at first I thought.

1115
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:40,176
- Morning, Sir Horace!
- Hello, enjoy your swim?

1116
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:44,222
Yes. Sorry I'm puffed, the water was
freezing and I'm running to get warm.

1117
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:47,767
..crying his eyes out?
Tell him to pull himself together.

1118
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:49,811
Hello, Daph!

1119
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:53,526
That reminds me of a lady policeman.
She's all out of breath.

1120
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:56,362
She's telling her friends
how she caught a burglar.

1121
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:00,530
"I chased him past the grocer's,
and the butcher's, and the baker's."

1122
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:04,120
And then she said,
"I finally caught him by the cobbler's"

1123
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:09,035
Sorry, I don't find that
remotely funny, Sir Horace.

1124
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:11,875
Oh, I stand corrected, Daph.

1125
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:13,838
I'll tell you what I don't find funny,

1126
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:16,424
hanging around
waiting for the great detective!

1127
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:18,335
Oh, good morning, Monsieur Poirot!

1128
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:22,590
Listen here, Poirot. Not only
have you not find Allena's killer,

1129
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:25,885
but you haven't found my diamond.
So I'm off.

1130
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:29,604
The Gardeners and the Redferns
want to go, too.

1131
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:33,316
I can't say I blame them.
The place is like a morgue.

1132
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:34,935
Oh, I am so sorry.

1133
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:38,405
Madame, there is nothing like
a good night's rest

1134
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,866
to clear the little grey cells.

1135
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,699
Kindly ask all our friends
to forgather in the lounge

1136
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,118
<i>after they have finished
their petit déjeuner.</i>

1137
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:50,994
- When all will be revealed,
- What?

1138
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:53,211
- You mean you know?
- Oh, yes.

1139
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:55,755
Give us a few clues!

1140
01:28:55,872 --> 01:29:00,173
Alright, I wish you to consider
very carefully, a bathing cap, a bath,

1141
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:04,886
a bottle, a wrist watch, the diamond,
the noonday gun, the breath of the sea

1142
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,633
and the height of the cliff.

1143
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:10,311
From that you should be able to
solve it yourselves.

1144
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:16,060
We meet again in one hour. Now I am
going to have my oeuf a la coque.

1145
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:23,533
There goes the most insufferable man
in the world.

1146
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:27,245
<i>"OEuf a la coque." That's about
his mark, it's what he talks mostly.</i>

1147
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:53,430
<i>Mesdames, mademoiselle, messieurs...</i>

1148
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:57,352
The reason I asked you to meet me here
this morning... please, monsieur...

1149
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,896
...is that I, Hercule Poirot,

1150
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:05,197
have discovered the identity of
the murderer of Madame Marshall.

1151
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:07,490
This need surprise no one.

1152
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:10,997
Are you all comfortable?

1153
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:15,831
Even the murderer?

1154
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:20,833
This has been a most unusual crime,

1155
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:25,212
in that apparently nobody had
the opportunity of committing it.

1156
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:29,342
Madame Marshall was killed
between 11:30 and 12 noon yesterday

1157
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:32,094
and yet every single one of you
had a perfect alibi,

1158
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:35,893
including you, Monsieur Gardener,
without knowing it.

1159
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:39,393
I'm very sorry
if I have disappointed you.

1160
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:44,444
We had undeniably a body,
which meant that somebody was lying.

1161
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:46,945
Who?

1162
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:50,658
After exercising
considerable reflection,

1163
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:54,625
I came to the conclusion
that it was you...

1164
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,126
...Madame Redfern.

1165
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:04,759
Me?

1166
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:06,924
But I didn't lie to you,
I swear it.

1167
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:08,262
Oh, yes, you did,
madame.

1168
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:11,259
When I asked you at what time
you left Gull Cove yesterday,

1169
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:13,260
you said it was 12 o'clock.

1170
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:15,058
You knew this, you said,

1171
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:18,648
<i>because you heard
that awful gun go off</i>

1172
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:21,735
<i>when you were standing
on top of the cliffs waving at Linda</i>

1173
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:24,149
<i>who was swimming in the water below.</i>

1174
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:30,702
But Monsieur Brewster was in the bay
at the same time.

1175
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:33,698
It is very curious
that you did not mention him.

1176
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:36,826
And it's even more curious
that when I confronted M Brewster

1177
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:40,420
with the fact that his story about
entering the bay on his pedalo

1178
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:44,417
at the very moment that the midday gun
went off was denied by Linda

1179
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:46,794
he lost his temper.
He attacked the poor girl.

1180
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:51,389
It would've been so much easier to have
called his second witness. You, madame.

1181
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:54,259
He must have seen you
standing on top of the cliff

1182
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:57,058
and yet he made no mention of it.
Why not?

1183
01:31:57,178 --> 01:32:00,102
The answer is obvious,
you were not there.

1184
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:07,406
But I was there.
And I did wave and Linda waved back.

1185
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:10,241
- Tell him, Linda!
- It's true. She did wave, honestly.

1186
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:14,454
Yes, she probably waved
but there was no noonday gun, was there?

1187
01:32:14,571 --> 01:32:16,073
I don't remember it.
No.

1188
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:19,997
No, there was no noonday gun for a
very good reason. It was not 12 o'clock.

1189
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:23,338
But she asked me the time, I looked
at my watch and it was five to 12!

1190
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:26,083
The watch,
now that is very important.

1191
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:28,505
Let us go back to yesterday morning,
shall we?

1192
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:32,301
<i>I was having breakfast
on the terrace, an egg,</i>

1193
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:35,551
<i>and in the course of performing
some act of léger de main for you,</i>

1194
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:39,430
<i>Mademoiselle, I happened to notice
that you were not wearing a watch.</i>

1195
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:42,307
<i>Not particularly surprising
as you had been swimming,</i>

1196
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:46,562
<i>a fact that could be noted by anyone
looking out of a hotel window.</i>

1197
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:51,074
<i>You, Madame Redfern, actually told me
you went to her room early</i>

1198
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:55,788
<i>to ask her to come with you
to Gull Cove to do some sketching.</i>

1199
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:58,578
<i>But that she was not there.</i>

1200
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:00,325
<i>What a perfect opportunity</i>

1201
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:04,671
<i>to put Mademoiselle Linda's watch
forward... 20 minutes?</i>

1202
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:07,666
<i>A few moments later, as you told me,</i>

1203
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:13,093
<i>Linda appeared in the corridor,
as you knew she would.</i>

1204
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:15,682
<i>And you invited her to accompany you.</i>

1205
01:33:15,799 --> 01:33:18,018
- Would you like to come?
- Yes, I'd love to.

1206
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:20,307
Alright, see you
in the hall in ten minutes.

1207
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:23,101
Hello, Mr Poirot.

1208
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:31,315
Your plan to make Linda
your false alibi was now in motion.

1209
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,989
This is pure supposition, Poirot.
I've never heard such twaddle.

1210
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:38,956
Twaddle or not, it is the only
explanation which fits all the facts.

1211
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:40,790
Now if you will be a little patient,

1212
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:45,250
I will explain to you
exactly what happened next at Gull Cove.

1213
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,920
<i>Madame Redfern, unseen by Linda,
consulted her own watch,</i>

1214
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,919
<i>which she was wearing
but kept concealed</i>

1215
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,842
<i>under the sleeve of that
strange voluminous outfit</i>

1216
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:57,091
<i>she chose to protect
her from the sun.</i>

1217
01:33:57,215 --> 01:34:01,095
<i>It is of course 25 to 12.</i>

1218
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:06,100
<i>She then asked Linda the time,
who naturally said it was five to 12.</i>

1219
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:11,276
<i>Linda then starts to go down
to the sea. While her back is fumed,</i>

1220
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:14,991
<i>Madame Redfern returns Linda's watch
to the correct time,</i>

1221
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:21,081
<i>then calls Linda back, telling her
she has forgotten her bathing cap.</i>

1222
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:25,327
<i>Why should she bother to do that,
you may ask?</i>

1223
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:27,453
<i>The answer is simple.</i>

1224
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:31,300
<i>Remember, at 12 o'clock
the noonday gun is due to go off.</i>

1225
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:36,013
<i>And she can take no chance of
Linda hearing and noting it.</i>

1226
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:38,803
<i>A girl splashing about in the sea</i>

1227
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:44,225
<i>and wearing a bathing cap
would hear nothing.</i>

1228
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,144
<i>So let us exactly see what happened</i>

1229
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:51,065
<i>as Madame Redfern hurried up
from the cove to the top of the cliff.</i>

1230
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:56,113
<i>It is 11:40.
She pauses to wave.</i>

1231
01:34:56,232 --> 01:34:58,200
<i>Linda waves back.</i>

1232
01:34:58,318 --> 01:35:00,616
<i>But there is no Mr Brewster:</i>

1233
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:02,785
<i>No noonday gun.</i>

1234
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:06,251
<i>Madame Redfern now tums</i>

1235
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:09,871
<i>and runs across the path which
separates Gull Cove from Ladder Bay.</i>

1236
01:35:09,996 --> 01:35:13,967
<i>That takes her six or seven minutes,
no more.</i>

1237
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:16,882
<i>She arrives at Ladder Bay
at about a quarter to 12</i>

1238
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:19,222
<i>and sees Madame Arlena
sitting impatiently,</i>

1239
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,637
<i>awaiting the arrival
of Patrick Redfern,</i>

1240
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:25,558
<i>with whom, I am convinced,
she had a rendezvous.</i>

1241
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:27,521
Oh, Christ!

1242
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:31,564
Suddenly, to her great chagrin
she sees you, madame,

1243
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:33,857
<i>about to come down the ladder</i>

1244
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:37,152
But I couldn't have!
I suffer from vertigo.

1245
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:38,399
You know that.

1246
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:42,324
I only know that because you took
good care to stage an incident

1247
01:35:42,445 --> 01:35:44,698
showing me that you
suffer from vertigo.

1248
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:47,541
The day before yesterday,
on the terrace.

1249
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:51,587
<i>As we were having a stroll
and I was drawing your attention</i>

1250
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:55,550
<i>to the sunbathing figures on the beach
below us, you suddenly fell against me</i>

1251
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:58,841
<i>and stepped back,
saying you suffered from vertigo.</i>

1252
01:35:58,962 --> 01:36:01,681
But she does have it, Poirot.
She's always had it.

1253
01:36:01,839 --> 01:36:03,466
That is not the case,
monsieur.

1254
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,389
Your wife only
pretended to have it

1255
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:09,686
in order to prove that she
could not have climbed down the ladder.

1256
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:11,900
<i>But, yesterday afternoon,</i>

1257
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:15,145
<i>I myself stood on the cliff
ovelooking Gull Cove</i>

1258
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:19,282
<i>and I discovered something
rather interesting.</i>

1259
01:36:19,399 --> 01:36:25,372
<i>In order to have seen Linda
in the water below and to wave to her,</i>

1260
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:29,789
<i>you would have had to stand
right on the very edge.</i>

1261
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:33,046
<i>Although I do not suffer
from vertigo,</i>

1262
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:37,212
<i>I myself was quite dizzy.</i>

1263
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:43,389
For you, madame, had you suffered from
vertigo, it would have been impossible.

1264
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:49,896
Let us now resume the story from the
point at which you descended the ladder.

1265
01:36:50,013 --> 01:36:52,892
Madame Arlena decided to
avoid a confrontation

1266
01:36:53,016 --> 01:36:54,689
and was about to leave the beach

1267
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:59,155
when she noticed a small grotto
at the base of a cliff.

1268
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:02,993
You may well ask
how I knew she had been in there.

1269
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:07,080
<i>Yesterday afternoon, not only
did I discover the false diamond</i>

1270
01:37:07,196 --> 01:37:09,039
<i>that Horace Blatt had returned to her,</i>

1271
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:12,286
<i>but my excellent wine fastens nose</i>

1272
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:16,165
<i>had detected, not as you put it,
Madame Castle, a pong,</i>

1273
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:19,714
<i>but Souffle de Mer,
"the breath of the sea",</i>

1274
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:25,637
<i>which, as you know, Monsieur Marshall,
was her favourite perfume.</i>

1275
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:29,560
But I am digressing.

1276
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:33,557
You ran down on to the beach,
but Madame Arlena had disappeared.

1277
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:37,853
Arlena! Where are you?

1278
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:44,117
I know you're here.
I want to talk to you!

1279
01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:46,494
Be with you in a minute.

1280
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:49,781
Well, what is it?

1281
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:05,050
Look here, Poirot.
Haven't we heard enough of this blarney?

1282
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:08,550
Arlena was not murdered with a blunt
instrument, she was strangled.

1283
01:38:08,674 --> 01:38:11,678
And if you would care to bend
those beady Belgian eyes of yours

1284
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:16,309
on Christine's hands, you'll see they
are too small to have strangled anyone.

1285
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:21,188
Yes, I quite agree. In fact that was
a major stumbling block to my theory.

1286
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:24,657
Redfern's right,
this knocks your theory out of court.

1287
01:38:24,774 --> 01:38:28,824
Odell, please,
you weren't even there, and I was.

1288
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:31,744
Remember,
I saw her lying there strangled.

1289
01:38:31,864 --> 01:38:33,741
Christine couldn't have done it.

1290
01:38:33,866 --> 01:38:37,166
I am absolutely of your opinion, madame.
In fact, she did not do it.

1291
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:42,543
The murder was committed
by her husband, Patrick Redfern.

1292
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:47,385
Now you really are
talking out of the top of your hat!

1293
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:52,306
Oh, for God's sakes. Patrick couldn't
have done it, any more than his wife.

1294
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:56,648
Don't forget I was with him
the whole time between 11:30 and 12:00

1295
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:59,563
when we came into the bay
and saw her lying there.

1296
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:02,278
That is the whole point, madame.

1297
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:06,320
<i>One moderately well-made young woman
is very much like another:</i>

1298
01:39:06,482 --> 01:39:09,201
<i>Two brown arms,
two brown legs</i>

1299
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:12,413
<i>and a little piece of bathing suit
in between.</i>

1300
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:17,001
<i>What exactly did you see from your
place in the boat, Madame Gardener?</i>

1301
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:19,246
<i>The ardent young lover,
M Redfern,</i>

1302
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:22,715
<i>bending over the body
with suntanned limbs</i>

1303
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:29,716
<i>wearing Arlena's white bathing costume
and a red Chinese hat.</i>

1304
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:32,092
<i>As I pointed out
a couple of days ago,</i>

1305
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:35,060
<i>all bodies lying on the beach
are alike.</i>

1306
01:39:35,178 --> 01:39:37,180
<i>"They are not men and women, " I said.</i>

1307
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:39,933
<i>"There is nothing personal about them,"
I said.</i>

1308
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:45,359
<i>"They are like rows of butcher's
meat grilling in the sun," I said.</i>

1309
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:48,825
<i>No wonder you were fooled
into imagining that you had seen</i>

1310
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:50,784
<i>the corpse of Madame Marshall,</i>

1311
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:53,075
<i>when what you had actually seen</i>

1312
01:39:53,196 --> 01:39:57,417
<i>was the live body of
Madame Christine Redfern.</i>

1313
01:39:57,575 --> 01:40:00,454
<i>That is why the murderer
had to conceal the face,</i>

1314
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:04,545
<i>because it was not the murder victim
lying there, but somebody else.</i>

1315
01:40:04,665 --> 01:40:09,922
<i>And who else would help
Monsieur Redfern, but his own wife?</i>

1316
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:14,342
<i>And now the performance
for the benefit of the witness is over.</i>

1317
01:40:14,467 --> 01:40:18,688
<i>Madame Gardener departs
from the bay by boat to fetch help.</i>

1318
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:22,274
<i>And what do you think happened,
Madame Gardener,</i>

1319
01:40:22,391 --> 01:40:27,318
<i>as soon as you had disappeared?</i>

1320
01:40:29,398 --> 01:40:32,026
<i>Why, the corpse leaps to her feet</i>

1321
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:36,327
<i>and runs into the grotto to remove
Madame Arlena's bathing costume,</i>

1322
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:39,121
<i>which she had stripped off
the unconscious woman</i>

1323
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:42,253
and worn to play her part as a corpse.

1324
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:46,416
I've got a point, Poirot,
which will scupper all your whole case.

1325
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:51,634
Christine is as pale as
pasteurised milk. Now the question is,

1326
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:56,051
how could I have possibly mistaken
her arms and legs for Arlena's?

1327
01:40:56,175 --> 01:40:58,018
This covers nothing at all, madame.

1328
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:00,763
In answer to your question,
I would ask you to consider

1329
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:05,519
the bizarre nature
of Madame Redfern's beach apparel.

1330
01:41:05,643 --> 01:41:08,863
<i>When I saw Madame Redfern
in the lobby yesterday morning,</i>

1331
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,574
she was wearing
a totally exaggerated garment

1332
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:15,161
<i>which completely covered her
from wrist to neck.</i>

1333
01:41:15,278 --> 01:41:19,624
No mere fear of the sun could have
occasioned such a choice of dress.

1334
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:23,790
She had to wear such an all-concealing
outfit because underneath...

1335
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:26,289
...she was brown as a nut

1336
01:41:26,414 --> 01:41:30,089
In the grotto, after having
climbed into the unconscious

1337
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:32,553
<i>Madame Arlena's swimming costume,</i>

1338
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:36,470
<i>all she had to do was
to stain her hands and neck,</i>

1339
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:39,385
<i>something she could not have done
earlier. Why?</i>

1340
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:42,354
<i>Because Linda would have noticed.</i>

1341
01:41:42,471 --> 01:41:48,399
<i>She puts on the earrings
and then she mas out of the grotto</i>

1342
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:54,526
<i>and onto the beach,
settles herself on Arlena's towel</i>

1343
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:59,247
<i>and puts her great big Chinese hat
over her face</i>

1344
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:03,584
<i>and lies still to await the arrival of
her husband and yourself.</i>

1345
01:42:03,743 --> 01:42:07,213
<i>Dead... on cue,
as it were.</i>

1346
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:13,257
<i>And this, I must admit,
he stage-managed superbly,</i>

1347
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:15,254
timing his appearance at Ladder Bay

1348
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:19,976
<i>exactly to coincide
with the sound of the noonday gun.</i>

1349
01:42:26,432 --> 01:42:28,025
The rest was easy.

1350
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:31,362
She now changed back
into her original costume.

1351
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:33,902
It was about five past 12.

1352
01:42:34,065 --> 01:42:38,821
<i>Madame Redfern bids her husband a
hunted farewell. The clock is ticking.</i>

1353
01:42:38,944 --> 01:42:41,663
<i>She runs back across the island
to rejoin the path</i>

1354
01:42:41,781 --> 01:42:44,409
<i>leading from Gull Bay
to the hotel.</i>

1355
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:47,537
<i>She has one more
task to perform.</i>

1356
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:51,383
<i>She must get rid of the
incriminating bottle of suntan stain.</i>

1357
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:54,673
<i>The bottle that no one
would admit throwing.</i>

1358
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:58,260
<i>So she hams it over the cliff I</i>

1359
01:42:58,381 --> 01:43:02,978
<i>But has the bad luck to have the event
witnessed by Monsieur Brewster,</i>

1360
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:05,313
<i>whom it almost hit.</i>

1361
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:09,059
<i>She reaches the hotel,
arriving there about 12: 15.</i>

1362
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:11,277
<i>I myself timed the journey.</i>

1363
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:17,026
<i>But then I was not running like
a young gazelle, for obvious reasons.</i>

1364
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:20,744
<i>Madame Redfern now takes the bath,
heard by Monsieur Gardner,</i>

1365
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:27,210
<i>the bath no one would admit to taking,
in order to wash off the suntan.</i>

1366
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:30,705
<i>She changes into tennis clothes
and appears on the court</i>

1367
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:34,175
<i>a few minutes late it is true,
but unruffled and smiling,</i>

1368
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:35,884
<i>a picture of innocence.</i>

1369
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:41,637
Yes, Monsieur and Madame Redfern,

1370
01:43:41,799 --> 01:43:46,771
I blame myself for not having seen
through your little charades earlier.

1371
01:43:46,887 --> 01:43:50,983
But then, unfortunately,
not even Hercule Poirot is perfect.

1372
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,693
From the moment you arrived,

1373
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:56,860
you started playing out a series
of carefully rehearsed scenes,

1374
01:43:56,981 --> 01:44:00,201
<i>in such a manner
that all might hear or see.</i>

1375
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:03,070
Together, there were
scenes of hysterical jealousy

1376
01:44:03,195 --> 01:44:04,822
<i>played close to open windows.</i>

1377
01:44:04,947 --> 01:44:06,620
You don't want to talk!

1378
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:09,540
Look here!
Can't I even speak to a pretty woman

1379
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:13,756
without you jumping to the conclusion
that I'm having an affair with her?

1380
01:44:13,873 --> 01:44:15,295
But you are, aren't you?

1381
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:18,169
<i>A part, you, madame,
took every opportunity</i>

1382
01:44:18,335 --> 01:44:19,427
<i>to give the impression</i>

1383
01:44:19,545 --> 01:44:22,640
<i>that you are a physically frail woman
who's no good at sports</i>

1384
01:44:22,757 --> 01:44:25,510
<i>and who had to hide her skin away
from the sun</i>

1385
01:44:25,676 --> 01:44:28,930
<i>because it blistered
and made her look like, what was it?</i>

1386
01:44:29,054 --> 01:44:31,307
An Italian ice cream?

1387
01:44:31,432 --> 01:44:37,735
<i>And who was altogether to be pitied as
a poor little helpless abandoned wife.</i>

1388
01:44:37,855 --> 01:44:39,277
<i>Whilst you, monsieur,</i>

1389
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:42,823
<i>took elaborately indiscreet pains
to advertise your romance,</i>

1390
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:48,200
<i>instead of trying to conceal it
as any prudent lover would.</i>

1391
01:44:48,324 --> 01:44:52,795
I think you will all agree
that it was a most audacious plan,

1392
01:44:52,912 --> 01:44:55,085
brilliantly executed.

1393
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:56,958
Oh, yes, brilliantly.

1394
01:44:57,082 --> 01:45:01,883
But the one thing you have failed to
supply, Monsieur Poirot, is motive.

1395
01:45:02,004 --> 01:45:04,473
Why on earth should
I kill Arlena?

1396
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:06,763
I absolutely adored her.

1397
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:13,482
Adultery may be reprehensible,
but it certainly is not criminal.

1398
01:45:15,226 --> 01:45:18,901
No, monsieur, you did not adore her,
you adored her money.

1399
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:25,154
And, more especially, the magnificent
diamond offered her by Sir Horace Blatt.

1400
01:45:25,277 --> 01:45:30,158
Those who teach Latin to small
boys are not exactly overpaid.

1401
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:34,204
You're not at all the romantic figure
you like to present.

1402
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:38,424
You are a hardened adventurer
and a vicious swindler,

1403
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:41,511
who had absolutely no moral compunction

1404
01:45:41,627 --> 01:45:45,302
in borrowing the diamond
from Madame Arlena

1405
01:45:45,422 --> 01:45:49,723
and of substituting a paste copy.

1406
01:45:49,844 --> 01:45:52,848
Oh, pray, do continue, Monsieur Poirot.

1407
01:45:52,972 --> 01:45:58,069
Oh, yes, monsieur, politeness
is very much part of the act.

1408
01:45:58,185 --> 01:46:01,064
You knew that
your deception would be discovered.

1409
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:02,189
Too bloody right.

1410
01:46:02,314 --> 01:46:06,535
And you had to eliminate the
only witness capable of exposing you.

1411
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:11,499
And what better opportunity than on
holiday, in a small exclusive island,

1412
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:15,620
where you could plan
and execute her murder?

1413
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:20,299
<i>Picture to yourself the scene,
mes amis.</i>

1414
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:22,004
<i>The half-lit grotto.</i>

1415
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:25,471
<i>Madame Arlena slowly
returning to consciousness</i>

1416
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:31,762
<i>and the so solicitous Monsieur Patrick
preparing le moment juste to strike.</i>

1417
01:46:31,927 --> 01:46:34,271
Oh, Patrick.

1418
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:39,606
<i>Suddenly, his hands
are around her throat.</i>

1419
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:41,729
<i>She struggles,</i>

1420
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:45,779
<i>and it is the end of poor, foolish,</i>

1421
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:51,498
<i>beautiful,
gullible Arlena Marshall.</i>

1422
01:46:56,243 --> 01:47:01,374
And that, mesdames,
mademoiselle, messieurs

1423
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:05,128
is the story of the murder of
Arlena Marshall.

1424
01:47:05,294 --> 01:47:07,422
The only thing they had not foreseen

1425
01:47:07,546 --> 01:47:12,598
was the presence on this island
of Hercule Poirot.

1426
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,776
The well-known romancer
and teller of tales.

1427
01:47:20,935 --> 01:47:26,533
Excellent plot line. imaginatively
conceived. Good, clear narrative style.

1428
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:28,743
I'll give you nine out of ten, Poirot.

1429
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:34,707
I'm deducting one mark
for total absence of proof.

1430
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:37,580
Is that true?

1431
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:41,581
We've sat here and listened to all that
and you can't prove a word of it?

1432
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:48,137
Unfortunately, Monsieur Redfern
is absolutely right.

1433
01:47:48,253 --> 01:47:50,381
I haven't a shred of evidence.

1434
01:47:50,506 --> 01:47:53,134
Although that is
unquestionably what happened.

1435
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,143
I don't think we need to sit here

1436
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:59,352
and be insulted by
this fanciful little mountebank.

1437
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:02,109
Come along, darling.
Shall we go and pack?

1438
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:07,107
Just give us five minutes, Mr Poirot,

1439
01:48:07,231 --> 01:48:10,360
and I'm sure we'll be able to work out
how you did it.

1440
01:48:16,407 --> 01:48:20,128
After all, where were you
at the time of the murder?

1441
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:29,796
You've let that pair get off scot-free
and I haven't even got my diamond back!

1442
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,218
You've made a right cock-up, Poirot.

1443
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:28,563
Oh, how very kind of you to see us off!

1444
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:30,940
Well, goodbye, my dear friends.

1445
01:49:31,065 --> 01:49:34,569
I don't think there'll be any necessity
to leave a forwarding address.

1446
01:49:34,693 --> 01:49:38,743
Just a moment, Mr Redfern.
Haven't you forgotten something?

1447
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:43,077
Why pay, Patrick?
They've done nothing but insult us.

1448
01:49:43,202 --> 01:49:45,250
Oh, we must pay it, darling.

1449
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:49,000
After all, we wouldn't want anybody to
think we were cheats now, would we?

1450
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:53,508
- I know you'll take a cheque.
- Certainly.

1451
01:49:53,629 --> 01:49:59,762
Of course, I also know that you're
thinking the cheque may well bounce,

1452
01:49:59,885 --> 01:50:05,437
but I'm afraid
that's as good as it gets.

1453
01:50:08,393 --> 01:50:13,820
Here you are, dear. I've put
a little extra on for the inconvenience.

1454
01:50:13,941 --> 01:50:15,693
Thank you so much.

1455
01:50:18,195 --> 01:50:20,914
Would you mind me saying something,
Miss Castle?

1456
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:25,286
Your ensemble does absolutely
nothing for you. Goodbye.

1457
01:50:27,329 --> 01:50:30,173
<i>Un instant, s'il vous plait,
Monsieur Ruben</i>

1458
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:34,345
- Monsieur Felix Ruber?
- Who did you say?

1459
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:36,384
- Ruber?
- Who the hell is Ruber?

1460
01:50:36,505 --> 01:50:40,009
Felix Ruber is the widower of
Alice Ruber,

1461
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:43,520
<i>whose strangled body had been
discovered on the Yorkshire moors</i>

1462
01:50:43,637 --> 01:50:44,638
<i>some months ago.</i>

1463
01:50:44,763 --> 01:50:50,111
<i>I was called in by the Trojan Insurance
Company to examine the police report.</i>

1464
01:50:50,227 --> 01:50:52,650
<i>In the event of Mrs Ruber's death,</i>

1465
01:50:52,771 --> 01:50:56,025
<i>her husband was a beneficiary of
a large sum of money.</i>

1466
01:50:56,150 --> 01:51:00,405
<i>The police were satisfied that it was
the work of a madman or a tramp</i>

1467
01:51:00,529 --> 01:51:03,203
<i>and so was I, since the
only possible suspect,</i>

1468
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:06,452
<i>the husband, had a cast-iron alibi,</i>

1469
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:10,172
<i>which had been established
by a woman-hiker</i>

1470
01:51:10,289 --> 01:51:13,418
<i>who had found the body
earlier in the day.</i>

1471
01:51:13,584 --> 01:51:16,007
<i>But last night I asked myself.</i>

1472
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:17,675
<i>A strangulation,</i>

1473
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:21,175
<i>an innocent witness, a change of time.</i>

1474
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:24,850
<i>Could the similarity in the pattern of
the events here on the island</i>

1475
01:51:25,012 --> 01:51:28,983
<i>and those on the moors
be a mere coincidence?</i>

1476
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:31,064
<i>No, mes amis,
the lonely hiker</i>

1477
01:51:31,226 --> 01:51:34,355
<i>was none other than
Madame Christine Redfern.</i>

1478
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:36,322
<i>While Monsieur Ruber
was on a train,</i>

1479
01:51:36,481 --> 01:51:43,330
<i>undoubtedly attracting attention to his
presence before potential witnesses.</i>

1480
01:51:43,447 --> 01:51:45,916
<i>The bigamous Monsieur
Ruber was now free</i>

1481
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:50,379
<i>to return to his surviving
wife, Madame Redfern.</i>

1482
01:51:54,041 --> 01:51:59,218
You were clever enough to avoid putting
your signature in the hotel register,

1483
01:51:59,338 --> 01:52:03,343
but, you know, the signature on
this cheque is really quite good enough.

1484
01:52:03,467 --> 01:52:08,348
Different names, of course.
Here on the claim form

1485
01:52:08,472 --> 01:52:12,818
for Alice Ruber's insurance policy,
it appears as Felix Ruber,

1486
01:52:12,976 --> 01:52:16,196
and here on the hotel cheque
it appears as Patrick Redfern.

1487
01:52:16,313 --> 01:52:22,946
Different names, but, monsieur,
undeniably the same handwriting.

1488
01:52:24,112 --> 01:52:26,331
My God.

1489
01:52:26,448 --> 01:52:29,918
You were wrong to tell me that
little joke about Giuseppe Verdi

1490
01:52:30,035 --> 01:52:32,504
being called Joe Green in English,

1491
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:36,501
or that you had once you taught Latin
to small boys.

1492
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:39,253
It was at that moment that I realised

1493
01:52:39,378 --> 01:52:44,726
that in that language
"Felix Ruber" is "Red Fern".

1494
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:49,730
You see, it is folly
to try and trick Hercule Poirot,

1495
01:52:49,846 --> 01:52:51,814
even in a dead language.

1496
01:52:51,932 --> 01:52:56,062
Do you think anyone's going to believe
the evidence of a couple of signatures?

1497
01:52:56,186 --> 01:52:57,984
And your bloody silly
word games?

1498
01:52:58,105 --> 01:53:02,702
Monsieur, if my modest assumptions
are too fanciful for you,

1499
01:53:02,818 --> 01:53:07,619
then perhaps a photograph
of a hiker and the mourning husband,

1500
01:53:07,739 --> 01:53:11,460
which must have appeared in local papers
and which I of course have sent for,

1501
01:53:11,576 --> 01:53:13,670
will be enough proof to hang you, sir.

1502
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:18,042
You will be arrested for
the murder of Alice Ruber

1503
01:53:18,166 --> 01:53:20,043
and of Arlena Marshall.

1504
01:53:23,171 --> 01:53:27,517
But before that, there is a small favour
I would like to ask of you.

1505
01:53:32,723 --> 01:53:34,817
Would you smoke
the pipe

1506
01:53:34,933 --> 01:53:38,358
which has been conspicuous
by being unlit since you arrived here?

1507
01:53:40,314 --> 01:53:42,316
No?

1508
01:53:46,194 --> 01:53:47,992
<i>Dommage.</i>

1509
01:53:57,414 --> 01:53:59,166
As I thought.

1510
01:54:03,628 --> 01:54:07,724
Sir Horace, please be careful
to whom you give it next time.

1511
01:54:09,009 --> 01:54:11,387
My God, you're a wonder,
Poirot.

1512
01:54:13,805 --> 01:54:15,148
Yes?

1513
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:19,190
<i>Poor Monsieur Poirot.</i>

1514
01:54:19,311 --> 01:54:21,405
Brave Monsieur Poirot.

1515
01:54:21,521 --> 01:54:26,152
I've just had a telephone call from His
Majesty and he is very pleased with...

1516
01:54:26,276 --> 01:54:27,402
The King of Tyrania?

1517
01:54:27,569 --> 01:54:31,619
He's very pleased with the matter being
cleared up so quickly and so discreetly.

1518
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:36,037
He's so pleased that he's awarding you
the Order of St Gudrun the Inquisitive.

1519
01:54:36,161 --> 01:54:38,914
- St Gudrun the Inquisitive?
- First Class.

1520
01:54:40,123 --> 01:54:41,966
How many classes are there?

1520
01:54:42,305 --> 01:55:42,873
