two days turned into
four weeks,

133
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:45,126
and Jeanine wouldn't let me
leave, and so I was like,

134
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,828
"Oh, you want me to help
you tidy some rooms in exchange

for staying at your sweet-ass

- Mansion.

00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,978
and snow, of course,
because snowshoeing.

152
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,213
Wow.

153
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,816
Yeah, you're going to
fit right in at Beaverfield.

154
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:44,318
Everyone here is a little
questionable.

155
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,120
You know, the weather,
the people, everything.

156
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,093
Fancy.

157
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:54,795
[Cecily] Devon's a tech dude,
and Joaquim runs the yoga sesh.

158
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:58,199
They're all like an ex-city,
nature-loving, millionaire power couple.

159
00:09:58,232 --> 00:09:59,700
You know the type.

160
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:04,872
Hi, boys, this is Finny,
the new ranger.

161
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:09,578
You just put the mail on
the marble table, thank you.

162
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,279
We're friends.

163
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:13,347
[woman] Yo, Cecily.

164
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,550
Yo, Gwen.

165
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:18,752
I know you got my starter
and my fuel injector.

166
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,955
- I don't, no, not yet.
- That's weird.

167
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,189
Sorry.

168
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:23,958
I ordered them like the fourth
of the last month

169
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,360
and by my algebra, it's been
like three whole weeks.

170
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,828
I'll keep an eye open for it.

171
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,065
Marcus. Marcus!

172
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,602
Wait, you are going to
want to see this.

173
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,202
- Damn.
- Fuck, Marcus.

174
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:37,338
- Shit. [chuckles]
- What time is it?

175
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:40,174
- Sorry, babe. Huh?
- "Sorry, huh" is not a time, Marcus.

176
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,143
- Are you high?
- Baby, no.

177
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,111
Drinking and driving
is for dummies, honey.

178
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:47,181
Don't talk to me... There's strangers,
who is that? Hey, what's your name?

179
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,618
- I'm Ranger Finn Wheeler.
- [both] What?

180
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,620
He's a new ranger in town.

181
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,654
- [mumbling] Oh, that's ranger thing...
- What he say?

182
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:56,257
- That's that. Y'all both police?
- I'm Cecily.

183
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,294
We've talked many times.
Welcome to Beaverfield. It's a freak show.

184
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,263
Suck my dick. [babbling]

185
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,297
She had too much soda.

186
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,967
- Colorful couple.
- Yeah, quite a show.

187
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,903
- Eh?
- [Finn] Oh, my goodness, gracious.

188
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,640
- Proud of it.
- Yeah, they're in it for a big check from the pipeline.

189
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,542
[Marcus] It's not funny.
We're just renting here.

190
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:16,043
- How do you know all this stuff?
- [Gwen] A big bag full of cigarettes.

191
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:19,013
You're not actually insinuating
that you read people's mail?

192
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,814
- No, I'm kidding.
- It's a felon.

193
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,951
You're the new ranger, hello.

194
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:27,188
- And who's this?
- Stephen King's very own Trish.

195
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:30,157
- What? What did you say?
- I said, "Beaverfield's queen Trish."

196
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:32,326
Oh, uh-huh.
Hello. Trisha Anderton.

197
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,795
- Proud owner of Anderton Maple Flowers.
- Hey, nice to meet...

198
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:40,602
It's been in the family 90 years and
everybody knows but crafting is my passion.

199
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:42,504
- Boo!
- Oh!

200
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:44,872
- [laughs]
- It's you. [laughs]

201
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:48,943
- It's a little pale me.
- Has anybody made you a snowfall angel before?

202
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,345
You put it on your Christmas tree,
do you have a Christmas tree?

203
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,782
- Well, not currently.
- Or do you celebrate Kwanzaa, put it on your Kwanzaa tree?

204
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,418
- No, such thing.
- I am going to open my own craft store

205
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,320
as soon as that pipeline
comes through.

206
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:00,321
Just mark them words.

207
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:04,225
Hello, hello, hello.

208
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:05,960
[both] One, two, three.

209
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:09,363
He doesn't get any attention ever
since little Chachi came into my life.

210
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,466
- Do you? [kisses] Look at this.
- Ooh!

211
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:15,302
There she is,
it's Cecily the mailman.

212
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:17,871
- No, thank you. Stop, stop.
- Ranger Finn Wheeler. Hey, how are you doing?

213
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,574
Hello, Ranger.

214
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:22,009
- Cool, never the left.
- Never the left. My kind of guy.

215
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,511
- It's not what he meant.
- [barks]

216
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:24,945
- [Finn] How are you?
- [Trisha] Come on.

217
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:26,615
Oh, I got something for you,
Ranger.

218
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:29,350
It's from our own private
reserve right there.

219
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,185
You guys, so many gifts.

220
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,821
The best syrup in Vermont.
Oh, my God, are you kidding my behind?

221
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,222
What happened?

222
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:38,425
Jiminy Christmas,
hippies knocked down our sign again.

223
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,027
Oh. It's Antifa.

224
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,097
I mean look at that. Great job,
Picasso, you put an X through it.

225
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,666
You're not going to stop
the pipeline.

226
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:46,500
Do you have this problem
in your last town?

227
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:49,270
- No.
- Brooklyn hipsters.

228
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:50,938
Yeah, you just give 'em
a big old knock

229
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,439
on the old craniums, right?

230
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:56,110
Oh, oh, arrest her, Ranger,
she's the one, lock her up.

231
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,513
Lock her up, yeah, lock her up,
lock her up.

232
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:00,214
Say goodbye, Chachi.

233
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:04,485
There's a new sheriff in town,
you're not really a sheriff.

234
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,687
No, you're not.

235
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,921
They seem cool, huh?

236
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,857
He boned Gwen in their
sugaring room.

237
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,492
- No.
- Yes.

238
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:14,428
That aggressive mechanic lady?

239
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,864
That's the one.

240
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:19,668
Whew. That's... That's a dish.

241
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,172
Now this thing,
what exactly is this?

242
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:30,044
Oh, this? This is Parker's
phallic fire totem.

243
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,913
He's stuck 'cause he needs a
majority town vote to build it.

244
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:37,619
Half want the pipeline cash and half
want to save the trees or whatever.

245
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:40,220
Anywho, I think the only holdouts
are Jeanine and the boys.

246
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,222
- Do you need a hand with that?
- Yes, please.

247
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:48,962
So you got a big family,
small family, no family?

248
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,799
[both chuckle]

249
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,834
No, it's just me and my sis,
how about you?

250
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:57,237
That's so lucky. No, there's seven of us.
I'm the youngest.

251
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:59,239
My sister and I were born
the same year.

252
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:05,379
Irish twins, same grade even, so it was like,
"You want a toy? Take it from somebody else."

253
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,915
This here, right?
You coming with?

254
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,350
Actually if you wouldn't mind,

255
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,318
you want to just
bring him that package

256
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:13,487
'cause Flint likes to
know who's around here,

257
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,889
so you could introduce
yourself.

258
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,826
Neighborly fellow,
my kind of guy.

259
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,794
- Thanks for the tip.
- [phone rings]

260
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:22,764
Hey, oh, just one last...

261
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:25,633
- Hello Charlotte, hello?
- You might want to read this.

262
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,702
Hello? Hello?

263
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:31,205
[stammers] Charlotte, hello?
I can't...

264
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:33,140
You're good.

265
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:36,944
Love, hello, can you hear me?

266
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:39,079
- Hell... Ah, crap.
- [phone beeps]

267
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,486
[recording] <i>Hi, this is
Charlotte, leave a message, bye.</i>

268
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,523
Hi, Charlotte, it's me,
it's Finn.

269
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:51,992
Glad I'm finally getting through,
it's so hard to leave a voicemail. It's...

270
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:55,929
I'll call you back.

271
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:00,869
Mr. Flint.

272
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,509
Mr. Flint.

273
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:15,249
[music]

274
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,262
[knocks]

275
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:03,163
Oh! Oh-ho! Ha! Oh, man.

276
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:05,667
Oh!

277
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:10,538
You have 30 seconds to get
the fuck off my property.

278
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,439
I'm Ranger Wheeler.

279
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,943
You're way the hell out of
your jurisdiction, Ranger.

280
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:19,379
- You see, I received a complaint from Dr. Ellis.
- Regarding?

281
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:24,051
Regarding concerns of possible
commercial trapping.

282
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:30,525
You can tell Dr. Stalin I make my
living legally on my own fucking land.

283
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:32,025
It's called freedom.

284
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,428
Uh, you know, as long as you're
not doing it on US forest.

285
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:38,499
I don't recognize your job,
your stupid uniform,

286
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,067
or the government
you work for.

287
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,504
You're down to 10 seconds,
nine...

288
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:45,172
- Oh, okay, yeah. Well...
- Seven.

289
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,509
Are you gonna keep counting?
I have a package for you right there.

290
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:51,044
Five, four, three.

291
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:53,882
He's armed!
He's heavily armed.

292
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:58,151
- Thanks for handling my package.
- Do you know this? Oh!

293
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:02,690
He's not my kind of guy at all,
which is the neighborly kind.

294
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:05,593
- Are you hungry?
- Huh? Maybe. I think.

295
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:08,596
Yes, this requires
active measures, come here.

296
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,532
I tried to warn you,
but I think you were on your phone.

297
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:11,533
[Finn] I was on my phone.

298
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:14,502
[electricity powering up]

299
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,241
I bring in their packages
in the winter

300
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:26,614
so I have full access
to the kitch kingdom.

301
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:28,583
- [chuckles]
- Right? It's pretty great.

302
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:29,784
It's awesome.

303
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:31,218
Do you want to put on
a song?

304
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,654
Oh, yeah, sure, on the jukebox?

305
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:35,990
Yeah, and I'll see if there's
something I can heat up.

306
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:37,559
- Okay.
- Okay.

307
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,898
It's a lot of '90s.

308
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:45,733
[Cecily] Huh?

309
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:48,536
It's a lot of '90...
I'm just going to put something on.

So, what brings you
to Beaverfield?

00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:27,008
Hard ball right from the top.

318
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:31,079
- I had an incident at work.
- Did you touch someone?

319
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,146
- No.
- 'Cause time's up, you too.

320
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,650
Yes, but I didn't touch anyone.

321
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:38,151
- Do you want to show me on the soap bottle angel?
- It's not about touching.

322
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:40,054
I'm sorry, yes, go ahead.

323
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:45,192
Some guys I know
convinced me to fish Grout Pond

324
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:49,329
without a permit and then
they posted it to social media.

325
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,431
- I mean, can you believe it?
- Dummies.

326
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,534
So a transfer was a way for me
to keep my job.

327
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:55,069
- And Charlotte thought
- Charlotte?

328
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,237
[stammers] Yes, Charlotte
my girlfriend.

329
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,643
She thinks that this situation
could be good for our relationship.

330
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:07,115
- How is that?
- Well, you know, she thinks that I am too "available."

331
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,250
Right, because women like men who
aren't, ahem, there.

332
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,620
But, you know, I figure I won't
need a whole year

333
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:14,956
and maybe, you know,
assuming nobody better comes along...

- You will get back together or?

337
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,567
Well, technically,
we're not broken up.

338
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:28,936
- Ah, but you're not living together?
- No.

339
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,338
- You're not seeing each other?
- Not currently.

340
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,641
- You're not talking.
- There's texting.

341
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:36,309
And you're keeping
your options open?

342
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:39,614
Because Charlotte thinks that...
Oh, my God.

343
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,282
- I'm broken up, aren't I?
- I think so.

344
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,686
Want to do something
violent?

- [Finn] Ah!
- [Cecily] Wow.

346
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,723
I think it's like an English
axe, just weighted differently?

347
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:51,491
- They use a metric system.
- Yeah, I think that's what it is.

348
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,164
Oh! [kisses]

349
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,765
God, that was beautiful.

350
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:00,802
- I'm being hustled.
- You are, I'm a shark and this is a long con.

351
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:03,838
- Clearly. All right.
- Welcome to your worst nightmare.

352
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,807
All right.

353
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,942
- I'm Ranger Wheeler
- Hold on.

354
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:11,179
Before you do anything, just recognize
that you're holding a real murder weapon.

355
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,581
- Yes. Acknowledged.
- And it requires some training.

356
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,183
Yes.

357
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:19,554
So just try to flip it one time and
then land it on the second flip.

358
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:22,156
Just like a flip and then it
lands on the second flip.

359
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,758
- Yeah, okay.
- Does that make sense?

360

- Yeah. Yeah.
- You got this?

Okay. You got this.

How did you get into
rangering?

- Rangering?
- Yeah.

367
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:45,278
Yeah, that's what we call it,
but you're going to freak, but I read that.

- N-No.

- Yeah, absolutely.

- You poet.
- Yeah, I was 15.

- It changed my life. Yeah?
- Yeah, it changed mine, too.

You've been to Sequoia?

- Been to Sequoia, I've been to Kings Canyon.
- Mm-hmm.

Been to Yellowstone?

I've been to Yellowstone.

Yeah. You ever been to

No, but I would really
love to go. Yeah.

You know, I feel, um,

August so, you know,

416
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:22,964

I didn't need your help.

Hi.

Uh, it's a little too early
to tell, Mrs. Sherman,

don't know what's going on.

Hi, everyone.
I'm Dr. Ellis, Jane.

to get the backup generators going,

00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:04,065
Oh, my goodness. What now?

453
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:05,332
- Jeanine.
- Yes.

454
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:07,234
You got to let us in.
Our cedars broke.

455
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:10,971
Hey, yo, just so you know that
the streets is all storm-fucked.

456
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:13,207
Storm-fucked.

457
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,276
- What did she just say?
- [Jeanine] I think he said...

458
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:17,278
- Storm-fucked.
- Yeah.

459
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:19,847
I'll be right back.

460
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:26,921
[ominous music]

461
00:26:34,095 --> 00:26:35,129
Oh.

462
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:12,500
Heavens to Betsy.

463
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:41,295
Heavens to Betsy.

464
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:04,818
What is this?

465
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:15,196
Holy sh...!

466
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:25,706
[Jeanine] Ranger, you look like
you just seen a corpse.

467
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:28,510
You're right.

468
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:31,779
Uh... The roads are effed.

469
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:34,715
- Yes, we just said that.
- Yes. No shit, dummy. We said it.

470
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:37,818
And something's wrong
with the generator.

471
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:39,887
Which generator?

472
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,656
- All of them.
- Wait, what?

473
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,327
- What does that mean?
- It looks like somebody went at them with like a knife?

474
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,396
- What the hell do you mean a knife?
- [overlapping voices]

475
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,366
[stammers] Is that what killed
my Chachi?

476
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,368
Might we put
the horror leash away?

477
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,805
What kind of animal is smart enough to go
around town, slashing all the generators,

478
00:28:57,838 --> 00:28:59,708
but stupid enough to eat
your stupid Chachi?

479
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,874
Okay, you're over the line,
wolf city!

480
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,510
Why don't you use
your inside voice?

481
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:05,312
I'll use whatever voice I want.
Maybe I'll use my outside voice.

482
00:29:05,346 --> 00:29:07,348
Okay, well,
if the power grid is out,

483
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:09,984
it's going to take at least a
week for the power to get back up.

484
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:14,922
- A week?
- Uh, also, there's a dead body under your porch.

485
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:17,224
[sobbing]

486
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:25,165
[stammers] I didn't want to
leave him on the...

487
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:28,168
So I left him on the table.

488
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:31,138
[screaming]

489
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:38,379
[Marcus] Aw, shit.
That's your husband, ain't it?

490
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:40,281
[Gwen] Didn't get to Belize
after all, huh, Dave?

491
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,786
- Ooh.
- This is definitely a canine.

492
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,488
- How do you know?
- Probably a wolf.

493
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:50,958
What are you, like, a wolf detective
now, Marcus? I don't think so.

494
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:53,193
He's right.
The leg muscles have been severed.

495
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,429
[Parker] It's a canine.
It's to immobilize their prey.

496
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,766
Accurate assessment
for a gas man.

497
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:02,336
Well, I used to do a little brown bear
hunting in Siberia. It's a beautiful animal.

498
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,805
[Marcus] Yo, lady,
you a wolf detective, though?

499
00:30:04,838 --> 00:30:06,675
[Joaquim] Really good, Marcus.
Close, no.

500
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:09,076
- She studies animals...
- No, thanks.

501
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,878
[Sam] Tea toddler,
see for yourself.

502
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:12,846
Well, I'd, I'd take some
if you'd be so kind.

503
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,582
- [Trisha] grunts]
- [Parker] I would be.

504
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:18,520
What happened to Dave?
It's just so awful.

505
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:24,258
Anyway, um, lady doctor, do you think
what got Dave also got my Chachi?

506
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:27,161
If you'll excuse me,
I need to go compare these fur samples.

507
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:28,630
[Trisha sobs] Peter.

508
00:30:28,663 --> 00:30:30,331
He don't stink 'cause
he froze up.

509
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:32,634
- Maybe we should just take it inside.
- [all] Yes.

510
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:36,538
- It's so disgusting.
- [Trisha] Now one body, there's two bodies.

511
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:41,676
[Parker] You know, nothing's gonna
get down that mountain but a snowplow.

512
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,645
[Cecily] Does Beaverfield have
a snowplow?

513
00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:45,946
- [Gwen] Fuck yeah, we do.
- [Cecily] Good.

514
00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:49,149
[Gwen] I just need that starter
and fuel injector I ordered.

515
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:53,487
- [Cecily] Oh.
- [Jeanine] Oh, there's a wild animal out there

516
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:57,324
and I don't wanna say it
out loud,

517
00:30:57,358 --> 00:31:01,696
but who knows who or when
it's going to kill next?

518
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:04,599
Who she's going to kill next?

519
00:31:04,632 --> 00:31:07,535
- I do not find that funny.
- Hey, hey, hey.

520
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:09,604
- [Trisha] It's a little funny.
- I have an idea.

521
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:12,206
This Flint guy,
he's an expert hunter, right?

522
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,742
- Oh, yeah.
- You could say that.

523
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:17,378
- Well, maybe we pay him a visit...
- And kill the damn thing?

524
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:21,549
Actually, I was going to say,
maybe h-h-he could trap it?

525
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,917
[overlapping voices]

526
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:27,154
You can't go by yourself,
man. That psycho, he's nuts.

527
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:29,758
- You could come with me.
- No, I'm good.

528
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:30,759
Anyone else?

529
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:32,192
We're trying to have
a baby.

530
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:33,427
[Jeanine] And my husband
is dead.

531
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,696
[Trisha] And Chachi also.

532
00:31:35,597 --> 00:31:36,631
Cecily?

533
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:41,135
They can probably only
eat one of us at a time.

534
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,239
Uh...

535
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:46,841
You know,
if we had some snowshoes,

536
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,075
we'd be killing this walk right
about now.

537
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:49,343
We get it, you love snowshoes.

538
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,948
Yeah.
Thanks for coming with me.

539
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:58,218
It's really...
really cool of you.

540
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:01,488
Cool? Is it cool of me,
like "a friend way cool of me,"

541
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:03,792
or is it cool of me in like "a
girl you almost make out with,

542
00:32:03,825 --> 00:32:08,495
but then don't because your
ex-girlfriend calls" cool of me way?

543
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,566
- Look, last night...
- No, Finn, it's fine. You're not over your ex.

544
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,000
Let's not make
a thing out of it.

545
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:15,102
Well, no, you're wrong.
You know?

546
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:19,607
Last night was very,
very big for me.

547
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:22,409
In like a sad way 'cause
you're with the wrong girl?

548
00:32:22,443 --> 00:32:25,946
[stammers] No, because I was
with the right girl.

549
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:29,183
One who's smart
and beautiful.

550
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:30,284
True.

551
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:31,653
And interesting.

552
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:32,754
I'm listening.

553
00:32:32,787 --> 00:32:35,523
Look, I blew it, okay?

554
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:37,892
There's no denying that,

555
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:41,962
and it's not because
I love Charlotte still.

556
00:32:41,995 --> 00:32:47,034
[stammers] It's because
I don't know why.

557
00:32:50,471 --> 00:32:55,075
Finn, you're a really likable
guy, and that's great.

558
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:56,578
A lot of people like you.

559
00:32:56,611 --> 00:33:01,114
Not to sound too heteronormative,
but maybe Charlotte's right.

560
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:03,383
Maybe you should man up,
you know?

561
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,352
Grow a beard,
hair on your chest,

562
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:08,021
chug a beer,
yell at someone smaller than you.

563
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:09,691
I don't know,
yell things like, "Respect me."

564
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:12,794
I don't know what men do.
I try not to hang out with them too much.

565
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:16,196
[Sam] <i>You do realize that we are
prepared to double the offer?</i>

566
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,432
[Devon] I don't care if you
triple the offer.

567
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:19,968
We moved up here for scenery,

568
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,504
not your construction scheme.
No.

569
00:33:22,537 --> 00:33:26,206
[Joaquim] And scenery requires having
a forest, which you don't F up.

570
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,810
[Pete] Well, you're really
effing up our people's dreams.

571
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:31,111
[Devon] Yeah, well, too bad,
Pete.

572
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:33,848
[Marcus] Shit, I guess Trish
don't get her craft store, huh?

573
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:37,150
[Gwen] Craft store?
What about our freaking money?

574
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:39,219
- [Marcus] I don't know.
- [Gwen] Go ask. Ask.

575
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:44,091
Yo, P-Parker, so Gwen and I,
we want money.

576
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:48,362
[Parker] Oh, sorry, Marcus, if the vote
ain't unanimous, no one gets nothing,

577
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:51,331
unless you can convince
your neighbors otherwise.

578
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:54,368
[Devon] Are you deaf?
We are not going to sell.

579
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:56,270
- Sorry, neighbors.
- [Gwen] You suck. You both suck.

580
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:57,906
- [Devon] I suck?
- [Pete] You don't belong here!

581
00:33:57,939 --> 00:34:00,107
[all arguing]

582
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,676
[Pete] You're liberal
snowflakes.

583
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:03,277
[Marcus] Y'all city slickers
suck.

584
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,749
- [knock on door]
- Yeah.

585
00:34:07,782 --> 00:34:11,218
You got everything you, um,
need, Doctor?

586
00:34:11,251 --> 00:34:15,422
Dr. Ellis, do I call you Doctor
or Dr. Jane or...?

587
00:34:15,455 --> 00:34:17,424
Jeanine,
I have everything I need.

588
00:34:17,457 --> 00:34:19,359
Thank you so much for
letting me set up shop in here.

589
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:20,962
Okay.

590
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:24,398
- You got enough power?
- Yep. I work in the woods.

591
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:28,135
- I've got some batteries.
- Okay, okay. Oh.

592
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:31,204
- Jeanine?
- Okay.

593
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,610
I'm going to find out what
killed your dead husband.

594
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:38,713
I have excellent samples,
and I'm going to get answers for you.

595
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:41,114
Uh, okay.

596
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:43,017
[tense music]

597
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:49,824
[door closes]

598
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:54,662
[whirring]

599
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:03,871
- Do you want me to knock or...?
- No, I got it.

600
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:09,811
- Are you scared?
- No.

601
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:11,946
- 'Cause I can hear your tummy.
- I'm not.

602
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,314
- Are you?
- No, I'm punk.

603
00:35:16,017 --> 00:35:18,218
- You're in a punk band?
- I was, actually, in high school, yes.

604
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:21,089
We were called Megalodons 'cause
our lead singer's name was Meg.

605
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:22,857
- That's so cool!
- I know. I played...

606
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:29,631
Either of you care
to illuminate

607
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,132
what the hell happened
to my generator?

608
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:38,372
[Finn] Uh, so...

609
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:40,675
In conclusion,

610
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:45,445
what we're asking is that
you track this thing down and...

611
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,514
Kill it?

612
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:50,952
[laughs]

613
00:35:54,522 --> 00:35:56,958
- No.
- Okay.

614
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:59,159
Thank you for your time.
You've made yourself perfectly clear.

615
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:01,395
We're just going to
get out of your beard.

616
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:05,667
Mr. Flint, I understand that
you're proud of being tucked away

617
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:12,006
in the outskirts of this town, but,
you know, you're still a part of this town.

618
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,208
This thing is killing people
in the place where you live,

619
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:17,912
and the people of this town,
everybody's going,

620
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:24,585
"How the... How the heck are we
going to get rid of this monster?"

621
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:29,791
You know what? Everybody, every single
one of them, they all voted for you.

622
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,959
- It was really led by you.
- Cecily.

623
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:33,226
Don't touch that, please.

624
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:39,366
- Mr. Flint, Emerson.
- Emerson Flint.

625
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:43,071
People are afraid, and, you know,
no matter what their differences are,

626
00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:46,641
people deserve to feel safe.

627
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:48,142
I guess what we're asking

628
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:50,678
is that you...

629
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:57,585
you be a good neighbor,
you know, like Mr. Rogers.

630
00:36:57,618 --> 00:36:59,587
- Hey, I love him.
- Yeah.

631
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,824
- Mr. Rogers, huh?
- Yeah.

632
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:06,928
Who's that?

633
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:09,764
[both] Hmm?

634
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:17,071
It was all Jeanine's story, you
know, Dave running off and whatnot.

635
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:21,341
Welcome to Beaverfield.
Population, bunch of liars.

636
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:23,778
What are you suggesting,
Mrs. Anderton?

637
00:37:23,811 --> 00:37:26,379
Pete,
you and Dave were tight.

638
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:29,083
Did he ever say anything
about going to Bailey's?

639
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:30,785
Nope, but you know
what's weird?

640
00:37:30,818 --> 00:37:32,754
Jeanine's against
your pipeline, Mr. Parker,

641
00:37:32,787 --> 00:37:34,856
but Dave was really excited
about it.

642
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:37,125
- [Trisha] Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

643
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:39,292
Wait, y'all aren't saying
that...

644
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:42,262
We just don't know
for sure now, do we?

645
00:37:42,295 --> 00:37:44,665
Shit. You know what
I can't get out of my head?

646
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,433
- [Trisha] Language.
- Tell me.

647
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:50,605
Come on. All of the generators are just
conveniently mangled by some animal?

648
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:52,439
- Fuck off.
- [Trisha] Language.

649
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:57,078
Somebody did this,
a legitimately maladjusted somebody.

650
00:37:57,111 --> 00:38:00,280
Mm, I don't know.
Dr. Ellis did say it was an animal.

651
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:02,116
- I mean, there was all those hairs.
- Mm.

652
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:06,988
Well, we definitely have some unknown
knowns and some known unknowns.

653
00:38:09,223 --> 00:38:12,392
[scoffs] What's known is that
animals don't sabotage generators,

654
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:16,831
but guess what is covered
in hair and totally can?

655
00:38:16,864 --> 00:38:20,168
A werewolf! [gasps]

656
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:22,904
No. No. Again, I wasn't...
I wasn't going to say that.

657
00:38:22,937 --> 00:38:29,043
I was going to say...
Emerson Flint.

658
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:32,780
[Finn] "It's a Beautiful Day in
the Neighborhood," "Pink Friday."

659
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:34,982
Then he plays with puppets.
You know.

660
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:36,984
- Is it the land of make believe?
- I don't think so.

661
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:42,824
[Finn] Mr. Flint, I'm convinced this
thing is going to kill again, and...

662
00:38:42,857 --> 00:38:43,891
Finn.

663
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:50,164
[Cecily] Chachi.

664
00:38:50,198 --> 00:38:52,800
- Oh, my God.
- [Flint] I know, I know.

665
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:55,468
I'm not your man. Get out.

666
00:38:55,503 --> 00:38:57,271
Understood. Uh...

667
00:38:57,305 --> 00:39:00,440
You know, we're probably just going to
head back to the inn, save some lives.

668
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:01,843
- Make a soup.
- Mm-hmm.

669
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:03,410
[Finn] I'd die for one of
Jeanine's sandwiches.

670
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:05,746
- [Cecily] I don't want to die.
- I don't want to die either.

671
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,182
- That would be be terrible. [babbling]
- Good night.

672
00:39:08,216 --> 00:39:11,085
- [Cecily] Oh, gosh.
- We have to just push.

673
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:13,654
- Is it jammed?
- You want to leave?

674
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:18,559
- Uh...
- It's fine. [babbling]

675
00:39:18,593 --> 00:39:20,595
It's not opening.
I'm going in both directions.

676
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:22,597
You go ahead, please.
No, spare me.

677
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,265
[Finn] Oh, please don't.
Oh, please!

678
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:28,368
- Please don't bother the lock.
- Spare me there.

679
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:29,804
Think I couldn't do that myself?

680
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:31,272
I could have gotten that
myself.

681
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:32,840
But I appreciate it.

682
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:35,475
- He's definitely the murderer.
- Keep your voice down, be normal.

683
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:46,721
- Hurry! I need warmth.
- What happened?

684
00:39:46,754 --> 00:39:49,357
- [Trisha] What did he say?
- Emerson killed Chachi.

685
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,958
[all] What?

686
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:53,561
[stammers] Hold on a minute.
We don't know that for sure, Cecily.

687
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:57,031
Does that mean he killed Dave?
Does that mean he killed my husband?

688
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:58,933
He had Chachi's collar.

689
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:01,369
- [wailing]
- She does this a lot.

690
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:04,338
No! That's my child.

691
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:10,077
That bastard did! [shouting]

692
00:40:10,111 --> 00:40:13,381
- Okay, okay! Shh! It's all right. It's all right.
- Peter!

693
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:16,317
She's just happy to have some
closure, and now we finally got it.

694
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,586
- It's Emerson.
- [bells jingle]

695
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:21,689
- Chachi just got his wings. Dave, too.
- [Cecily] Sorry, Trish.

696
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:24,125
Hey, Jeanine, what do you say we
open up a nice bottle of wine, huh?

697
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:25,458
- No!
- [Pete] Okay.

698
00:40:25,492 --> 00:40:27,061
[Jeanine] Oh! Uh... Uh, okay.

699
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:29,730
- Well, maybe not that one, Pete.
- You want some, Gwen.

700
00:40:29,764 --> 00:40:31,999
You're not one to turn away
a spicy rat.

701
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:34,501
- [Gwen] Why you fucking touch my ass?!
- [Pete] Whoa, okay.

702
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:36,671
[Gwen] Keep your hands to yourself,
or I'll cut them the fuck off.

703
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:37,972
[Pete] Must be
that time of the day.

704
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:39,206
[Marcus] Don't touch my wife's
ass.

705
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,374
[Jeanine] Can I make anybody
a sandwich?

706
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:41,409
- [Marcus] I'll take one.
- [Gwen] No, you won't.

707
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,677
[Trisha] Me, I want one.

708
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,522
[cries]

709
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:05,366
- [screams]
- Oh, my God,

710
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:08,903
that was an absolutely
horrible sound you made.

711
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:11,372
Dr. Ellis, are you okay?

712
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:14,742
Did you find the answers now?
That was fast.

713
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:17,345
[Ellis] <i>I compared the DNA
samples.</i>

714
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,816
The hairs from both
Dave's body

715
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:24,785
and Chachi's little outfit
are a match.

716
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:26,921
Everything about this predator
is unorthodox.

717
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,158
It's not human.

718
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:35,329
It's canine, but there are
no matches in the database.

719
00:41:35,363 --> 00:41:37,698
<i>I'm going to keep
running tests, but for now,</i>

720
00:41:37,732 --> 00:41:40,500
<i>what I can tell you is I
don't know what this thing is.</i>

721
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:50,845
Examining the body, it appears it
feeds like a dog or a wolf, meaning...

722
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:53,581
[Jeanine] Meaning that?
I want to know.

723
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:56,317
Meaning Dave was
probably eaten alive.

724
00:41:59,854 --> 00:42:01,956
That's fucking rad.

725
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,259
- [overlapping voices]
- Okay.

726
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:08,796
Everyone, hey. Everyone, hey,
can I have your attention, please?

727
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:12,767
- Find our way home.
- Between the power outages and the storm,

728
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,171
the whole Emerson thing,
I think we can all agree

729
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:20,174
that it's unsafe outside
and there's safety in numbers.

730
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,475
- So maybe we...
- We should stay here tonight.

731
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,611
[overlapping voices]

732
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:25,479
I'm with you, yeah.
I don't wanna go out and get ate.

733
00:42:25,514 --> 00:42:26,881
- [both] Same.
- Jeanine, you got room.

734
00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:28,416
You can put us all up,
can't you?

735
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:30,885
- No. It's just that... Well, I have...
- [overlapping voices]

736
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:32,920
Thank you so much,
Jeanine.

737
00:42:32,953 --> 00:42:34,755
But some people
would have to double up.

738
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:38,492
Well, I mean, I think
that'd be fine, right, Cecily?

739
00:42:38,527 --> 00:42:41,962
- Okay. Slow down.
- Uh, out of curiosity, who is packing?

740
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:43,164
I am, yes, sir, America.

741
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:45,966
Shit.
Well, we're packing, dawg.

742
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,469
[Jeanine] I have Dave's hunting
rifle if that would be helpful.

743
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:52,373
Oh, gosh.
I almost forgot. Um...

744
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:56,377
I got... It's teensy.
[stammers] It's a purse gun.

745
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,012
- Excuse you.
- Okay.

746
00:42:58,045 --> 00:43:03,217
You know, I think we should keep a
gun in every room, just to be safe.

747
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:07,054
Hold up! This dude Emerson wants to
come down off his mountain-maniac ass

748
00:43:07,088 --> 00:43:09,524
and eat our asses
and fuck our skulls, guess what?

749
00:43:09,558 --> 00:43:13,194
It's not going to happen tonight
because pam, pam, I'm up in this tit.

750
00:43:13,227 --> 00:43:15,896
Yeah. Where my gun goes,
I goes.

751
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:20,167
Same, and I am sleeping
with my wife

752
00:43:20,201 --> 00:43:25,906
unless someone prefers that my
gun stays in someone else's room.

753
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,110
Cecily, do you want
protection or...?

754
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:30,644
- I'm good.
- Thank you.

755
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:35,249
Uh, one more time,
raise your hand if you have a gun.

756
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:37,852
It's tiny.
It's a purse gun.

757
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:39,653
And if you don't have a gun,
no gun?

758
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:41,856
Marcus got my gun.

759
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:46,260
Welp, we're having a good,
old-fashioned sleepover.

760
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:50,664
- With guns, though.
- With guns, yes.

761
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:58,105
Dr. Ellis, we just thought we'd clue
you in on the game plan for tonight.

762
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:06,147
Professor?

763
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:10,519
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

764
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:15,789
I just need more time to work.

765
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:23,164
Okay.

766
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:26,934
All right, everyone,
let's lock up.

767
00:44:57,364 --> 00:45:00,067
[snores]

768
00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:32,766
[bed rattling]

769
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,104
[screams]

770
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:39,674
- Pete!
- [screaming continues]

771
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,976
[snarling]

772
00:45:43,612 --> 00:45:47,181
- Get off of me! [screams]
- [gunshots]

773
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:51,118
What the fuck is going...?
[screams]

774
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:53,087
[screams]

775
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,826
- [Trisha] Peter! Peter!
- We need more lights.

776
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:01,428
- [Trisha] Oh, my God!
- Can someone please look for my hand?

777
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:02,997
Hell, yeah.
I got you, bro.

778
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,166
- [Pete screams]
- You shot my husband.

779
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,402
- His hand has been bitten off!
- [Trisha] Oh, my God!

780
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,672
For God's sakes,
this is an animal attack.

781
00:46:10,705 --> 00:46:13,742
Uh, no, I think he was shot,
too.

782
00:46:17,044 --> 00:46:19,880
Oh, wow,
would you look at that?

783
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:22,416
- [Trisha] Okay, Peter.
- He's just in shock.

784
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,318
I stopped the bleeding.
He should be okay.

785
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:27,722
[Marcus] We would have heard him
come in.

786
00:46:27,756 --> 00:46:29,323
How many times
did you fire your piece?

787
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:30,924
How many times
do you ask stupid questions?

788
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,893
Guys, it was obviously
an accident.

789
00:46:32,926 --> 00:46:36,631
[Cecily] Accident or not,
we're obviously not safe. We need help.

790
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:40,669
- [Pete groaning]
- [Jeanine] Is he here?

791
00:46:47,742 --> 00:46:50,044
[Jeanine] He didn't just
disappear.

792
00:47:00,755 --> 00:47:01,790
[Jeanine] Dr. Ellis?

793
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:07,061
Dr. Ellis, are you okay?

794
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:11,533
Gwen, what was it?
Did you see it?

795
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:15,537
Didn't get a good look.
He was fast.

796
00:47:46,701 --> 00:47:49,336
[Pete groaning]

797
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:50,839
[Trisha] We need to get him
to a hospital.

798
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:53,273
[Jeanine] We can't go anywhere
until the storm blows over.

799
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:55,710
- Marcus, don't touch that, please.
- I didn't. I wasn't.

800
00:47:55,744 --> 00:47:58,112
I feel like I'm in one of those
dinner theater murder things

801
00:47:58,145 --> 00:48:00,914
and I'm having a horrible time,
and I can't go home.

802
00:48:02,584 --> 00:48:05,052
- I don't get it.
- [Devon] All right, babe, it's a nightmare.

803
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:06,554
What could have gotten
in here?

804
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:09,990
And how did it get in here?

805
00:48:11,826 --> 00:48:13,060
How did it get out?

806
00:48:14,662 --> 00:48:15,697
Who says it got out?

807
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,100
[Ellis] Okay.

808
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:33,947
It's not possible.

809
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:52,332
It's not possible. It's not possible.
It's not possible.

810
00:48:58,405 --> 00:49:02,042
[Jeanine's voice] <i>Did you find
the answers now? That was fast.</i>

811
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:05,412
- [Pete's voice] <i>No! No!</i>
- [Ellis's voice ] <i>It's not human.</i>

812
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:07,782
<i>It's canine, but there were
no matches in the database.</i>

813
00:49:07,816 --> 00:49:09,116
[Jeanine's voice]
<i>Does that mean he killed Dave?</i>

814
00:49:09,149 --> 00:49:12,019
<i>Does that mean
he killed my husband?</i>

815
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:15,489
[Ellis's voice] <i>I have excellent
samples, keeping the root alive.</i>

816
00:49:15,523 --> 00:49:17,759
[voice echoing]

817
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:19,993
<i>I'm going to get answers
for you.</i>

818
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:23,197
<i>[voices echoing]</i>

819
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:30,705
Dr. Ellis?

820
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,742
I told you,
she's probably tanked.

821
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:38,412
[Finn and Cecily gasp, scream]

822
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:42,483
[Ellis] Touch this door again,
I'll shoot, again.

823
00:49:42,517 --> 00:49:43,551
[Finn] Dr. Ellis?

824
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:46,888
Please.

825
00:49:46,921 --> 00:49:49,924
- Look, we need answers.
- [Ellis] It didn't disappear.

826
00:49:50,758 --> 00:49:51,960
[Gwen] What did she say?

827
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:53,393
[shushing]

828
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:57,866
- What?
- [Ellis] It's not Emerson Flint.

829
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:00,100
It's one of you.

830
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:02,302
[Joaquim] What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

831
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:06,808
Okay, well, we don't understand.
Can you just please come out?

832
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:09,009
I'm afraid I can't do that,
Ranger Wheeler.

833
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:11,078
You could be one of them.

834
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:12,881
- What is she...?
- [Joaquim] Shh, shh, shh.

835
00:50:12,914 --> 00:50:13,948
One of what?

836
00:50:16,718 --> 00:50:17,752
[glass breaking]

837
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:20,855
A lycanthrope.

838
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:25,693
- A what?
- A werewolf.

839
00:50:25,727 --> 00:50:28,796
What? What is this, dumbass island?
She's drunk.

840
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:31,599
- She's a dumbass island, baby, you're fucking....
- Shh!

841
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:36,203
- [Parker] This room got a back door?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

842
00:50:36,236 --> 00:50:39,507
[Finn] Listen, hey, Dr. Ellis?
I know you're freaked out.

843
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:41,876
- [chuckles]
- Now I'm freaked out.

844
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:44,679
- I think we're all freaked out, yeah?
- [Gwen] Yeah. We're freaked out.

845
00:50:44,712 --> 00:50:46,179
[Finn] But tell you what,
if you come out,

846
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:49,817
- we can all discuss this together as a group.
- Hey.

847
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:52,486
- [gunshot]
- [screaming]

848
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,154
- [Ellis] Parker, no. Stay back.
- [Parker] Doc?

849
00:50:54,187 --> 00:50:56,958
- [Parker] Put the gun down. No!
- [gunshots]

850
00:50:58,058 --> 00:50:59,159
[body thuds]

851
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,531
Dr. Ellis, are you okay?

852
00:51:07,735 --> 00:51:10,137
[music]

853
00:51:15,977 --> 00:51:17,812
- She killed herself.
- [Joaquim] Oh, my God.

854
00:51:17,845 --> 00:51:20,347
[Cecily] What? Wait. Oh, what?
She killed herself?

855
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:23,718
She was less afraid of death
than whatever happened to Dave.

856
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:25,753
[music]

857
00:51:39,499 --> 00:51:42,369
All right. We searched again,
doors, windows, everything's locked.

858
00:51:42,402 --> 00:51:45,238
Nobody in here but us,
for better or worse, y'all.

859
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:47,107
And remember,
nobody's calling the cops.

860
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,410
Everyone shut your stupid
whore mouths and listen to this,

861
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:54,114
"Complete set of humanoid DNA
overlaps with a complete set

862
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:57,317
of canine DNA." Blah, blah,
blah, boring, boring, boring.

863
00:51:57,351 --> 00:52:00,655
Oh, "Not sure if this is another
species or evolution."

864
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:07,061
[Cecily] Well, it's not one
of those things.

865
00:52:07,095 --> 00:52:12,199
Hey, though, real? My dead dad did tell
me an old folklore about the settlers

866
00:52:12,232 --> 00:52:14,535
that used to run the werewolves
out of the woods.

867
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:17,471
Okay. Why are we even talking
about werewolves?

868
00:52:17,505 --> 00:52:20,575
- Why not? Every culture's got a werewolf story.
- Werewolves?

869
00:52:20,608 --> 00:52:24,045
That's true. The Vikings had the
<i>ulfhednar,</i> the Turkey has Kurd Adan.

870
00:52:24,078 --> 00:52:27,515
Okay. Big daddy Sam Parker
dropping that werewolf knowledge.

871
00:52:27,548 --> 00:52:30,283
When I was a kid,
my daddy used to kick my ass.

872
00:52:33,087 --> 00:52:34,656
[all] Okay.

873
00:52:34,689 --> 00:52:36,256
He also used to tell me
about the Wendigo.

874
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:38,726
He said he was coming to get me if
I was acting like a little shit.

875
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,598
- What's a Wendigo?
- It's a man-beast, stalks the woods,

876
00:52:43,631 --> 00:52:48,368
hungers for human flesh,
but is never full.

877
00:52:48,402 --> 00:52:51,338
That's funny. That sounds like
a euphemism for white men.

878
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:53,173
- [chuckles]
- [Devon] You're funny, honey.

879
00:52:53,206 --> 00:52:56,611
Thanks, baby. You know,
growing up in Argentina,

880
00:52:56,644 --> 00:52:59,914
it wasn't uncommon for the
seventh-born child to be killed

881
00:52:59,947 --> 00:53:01,949
because that one's
a werewolf.

882
00:53:01,983 --> 00:53:06,054
But you don't do that anymore,
right, because that's crazy?

883
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:09,123
I think I know what this is.

884
00:53:09,157 --> 00:53:13,528
Somebody's trying to scare us,
so cut the werewolf crap.

885
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:17,131
One of you in this house is
a bully and a murderer.

886
00:53:17,165 --> 00:53:22,937
Somebody is trying to take money from
honest, God-fearing, hardworking people.

887
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:27,775
One of you would rather terrorize us than
let Mr. Parker build his harmless pipeline.

888
00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:30,812
- Oh, Jesus.
- One of you killed my dog.

889
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:35,183
One of you ate
my husband's hand, and for what?

890
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:37,217
To save some chipmunks?

891
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:41,388
- Trish, they tried to frack up here, and they log.
- Oh, Janine, shove it.

892
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:43,791
- It's no different than fracking.
- You need to listen to her.

893
00:53:43,825 --> 00:53:45,292
You don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

894
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:46,861
You can't just buy people,
Mr. Parker.

895
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:49,630
Okay, we can't say that, okay, baby?
We have money, honey. Okay?

896
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:51,933
Who are we to tell these
people they can't take a check?

897
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:56,704
That's exactly right. Somebody's
terrorizing us to steal our damn money.

898
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:59,941
Hey, we're talking low-impact
construction here, people.

899
00:53:59,974 --> 00:54:04,277
I don't let people fuck with my money.
That's what I don't do.

900
00:54:04,311 --> 00:54:05,345
Y'all suck!

901
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:10,585
Are we really in a Mexican
standoff, right now?

902
00:54:10,618 --> 00:54:13,487
Baby, don't say Mexican,
just standoff.

903
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:15,923
[Marcus] Who's the bully?

904
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:19,761
Okay. Hey, everyone.
Everyone, please.

905
00:54:19,794 --> 00:54:22,496
- We've got a suicide on our hands.
- You got little hands, bitch.

906
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,866
- And my husband is dead.
- I don't have little hands.

907
00:54:24,899 --> 00:54:26,934
- Stop saying hands.
- Pete's missing a hand.

908
00:54:26,968 --> 00:54:29,469
- I'm missing a hand?
- And my husband is dead.

909
00:54:29,504 --> 00:54:34,374
- And also Chachi.
- Hey, look, I know tensions are high, clearly,

910
00:54:34,407 --> 00:54:38,980
but can we all agree to lock our guns
away until we can figure this out?

911
00:54:39,013 --> 00:54:40,581
Even you, Ranger?

912
00:54:43,851 --> 00:54:46,486
Yeah. Yes. Even me.

913
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:48,689
Even though that defies all
protocol, sure, you know,

914
00:54:48,723 --> 00:54:53,493
when... when werewolves are
within the house.

915
00:54:53,528 --> 00:54:56,864
You got a point.
I mean, Dr. Ellis is right.

916
00:54:56,898 --> 00:54:58,933
Any one of us could be
a suspect.

917
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,936
[music]

918
00:55:06,373 --> 00:55:10,410
I say we put our heads together
and smoke the fucker out.

919
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,614
You're smart.
You're so smart.

920
00:55:13,648 --> 00:55:15,516
[music]

921
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:43,311
Shit, y'all. Hey,
Trish has the most motive here, I think.

922
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:46,379
Cuz... Yeah. You hated Pete ever
since my girl Gwen fucked him.

923
00:55:46,413 --> 00:55:48,182
[Pete] I'm missing a hand.

924
00:55:48,216 --> 00:55:52,452
First of all, that was four years ago.
Also, it never happened.

925
00:55:52,485 --> 00:55:54,387
This conversation is foul.

926
00:55:54,421 --> 00:55:58,192
- Why would I even bite off Pete's hand? That's...
- Payback.

927
00:55:58,226 --> 00:56:00,862
- Well, what...?
- And you, you said you were going to cut off his head.

928
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:03,030
- You actually said it.
- [Gwen] Why don't you just admit it?

929
00:56:03,064 --> 00:56:05,833
- [Trisha] What? You're a creep.
- Your husband's a creep.

930
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:07,335
- You're the creep.
- Fine.

931
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:09,436
[Pete laughs]

932
00:56:13,174 --> 00:56:16,010
[Pete cackles]

933
00:56:17,712 --> 00:56:19,981
[Pete coughs, continues
cackling]

934
00:56:21,649 --> 00:56:24,085
No, I'm not a creep.

935
00:56:26,554 --> 00:56:28,122
I'm a werewolf.

936
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:34,362
[laughs]

937
00:56:36,564 --> 00:56:38,332
Maybe you're a werewolf.

938
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:41,035
You're a werewolf,
you're a werewolf,

939
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:43,871
you're a werewolf,
maybe we're all werewolves!

940
00:56:45,506 --> 00:56:50,011
Maybe I ate my own hand!
[gnaws] Ow!

941
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:52,513
You didn't eat your
own hand, hon.

942
00:56:52,546 --> 00:56:54,615
Uh, okay.

943
00:56:54,649 --> 00:56:57,885
Yeah, look, maybe we're just
a little on edge.

944
00:56:57,919 --> 00:57:00,021
Frankly, I'm a bit on edge
about Mrs. Sherwood.

945
00:57:00,054 --> 00:57:03,456
- [Gwen] Yes.
- [moans] Oh, my goodness. It's Sherman.

946
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:06,327
[Parker] Yeah. Well,
Mr. Sher <i>man</i> was in favor of the pipeline

947
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,696
coming through this stinky
old inn now, wasn't he?

948
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,231
- [Trisha] That's right.
- It's not stinky.

949
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:14,402
Your husband wanted to sell,
and your story about him is suspect.

950
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,637
[Trisha] That's right.
That's right. That's right.

951
00:57:16,671 --> 00:57:18,372
Don't go easy on her,
Mr. Parker,

952
00:57:18,406 --> 00:57:22,643
because, you know, you forget that
we found her dang husband's body

953
00:57:22,677 --> 00:57:24,477
- underneath her own dang house.
- Right.

954
00:57:24,512 --> 00:57:27,515
- If I could just say one thing...
- You know, I'm sitting here and quite honestly,

955
00:57:27,548 --> 00:57:30,651
- I'm just gobsmacked.
- Oh, you're gobsmacked?

956
00:57:30,685 --> 00:57:34,622
By of the accusations that
are flying around this room!

957
00:57:34,655 --> 00:57:37,758
You know, I didn't kill
my damn husband.

958
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:40,561
I'm not a damn "lycantrope,"
whatever.

959
00:57:40,594 --> 00:57:44,398
- Lycanthrope.
- Well, whatever, I am not one of those.

960
00:57:44,432 --> 00:57:48,035
I'm not a cockamamie wolf.

961
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:51,806
I didn't kill my husband.
[cries]

962
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:56,043
Dave said he left me because...

963
00:57:56,077 --> 00:58:02,482
[sobs] I let myself go.

964
00:58:02,516 --> 00:58:04,885
That's crazy.
You look so, so good.

965
00:58:04,919 --> 00:58:07,288
- You have clothes.
- I'm so sorry.

966
00:58:11,993 --> 00:58:15,495
- It's a bit of a reach.
- Is that why you ate him?

967
00:58:15,529 --> 00:58:17,431
[Parker laughs]

968
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:23,070
- Uh, if I could just say one...
- What about you, Mr. Parker? Aren't we suspicious of him?

969
00:58:23,104 --> 00:58:26,707
And how do we know
you didn't kill Dr. Ellis?

970
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:29,577
Why am I the only one
bringing that up?

971
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:32,546
Am I the only one that finds
that suspicious?

972
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,949
The gun was in her hand,
hon.

973
00:58:34,982 --> 00:58:39,320
You gave her your flask.
She didn't want your damn booze.

974
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:42,023
This man,
he is a newcomer.

975
00:58:42,056 --> 00:58:44,558
He wants our land.

976
00:58:44,592 --> 00:58:47,294
He's trying to buy us out
with all his money.

977
00:58:47,328 --> 00:58:49,163
- What's wrong with that?
- [overlapping voices]

978
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:52,533
- Let me just say one thing...
- What about Ranger Wheeler here, and Cecily?

979
00:58:52,566 --> 00:58:54,402
- I mean, they're newcomers.
- Oh, whatever.

980
00:58:54,435 --> 00:58:57,238
We're innocent AF,
and you know it!

981
00:58:57,271 --> 00:59:01,475
We blindly walked into this
weird-ass horror show of a town.

982
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,145
[Jeanine] Yes, sticking your
nose in these people's business

983
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:06,614
with your money
and your fancy booze.

984
00:59:06,647 --> 00:59:10,985
- All right, I'll say it again, lady!
- You are a dangerous man.

985
00:59:11,018 --> 00:59:13,854
[arguing continues]

986
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:24,231
- [glass breaking]
- That was Royal Crown Derby.

987
00:59:24,265 --> 00:59:30,438
Look, I know it's easy to get caught
up in the fear of a fear situation,

988
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:34,575
but can we all just take
a breath and remember

989
00:59:34,608 --> 00:59:36,610
what we wanted out of this
community when we moved here?

990
00:59:38,712 --> 00:59:42,583
- Yeah, like... Like you, Trish.
- What?

991
00:59:42,616 --> 00:59:45,719
- I mean, we know that you're devastated by Chachi.
- Yeah, I am.

992
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:49,558
- It really sucks.
- But you made us all those...

993
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,625
- Soap bottle angels.
- Yeah, those.

994
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:53,794
I mean, I don't know
about anybody else,

995
00:59:53,828 --> 00:59:55,296
but that made
me feel amazing.

996
00:59:55,329 --> 00:59:57,898
- I still keep mine on the mantel.
- Yeah, to my dismay.

997
00:59:57,932 --> 01:00:02,636
And Devon, look, I know you feel that
everything bad came in with Parker,

998
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:06,640
but, you know, some of your
neighbors aren't tech millionaires.

999
01:00:06,674 --> 01:00:08,609
You know, a little extra money
would mean a lot of them.

1000
01:00:08,642 --> 01:00:10,144
Well, we're not actually
millionaires.

1001
01:00:10,177 --> 01:00:12,113
- Well...
- Are we?

1002
01:00:12,146 --> 01:00:14,882
- Maybe. Yeah, we're rich.
- Oh.

1003
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:20,387
And Janine, you've been so generous
in spite of all your grief.

1004
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:26,760
I know it's easy to point the
finger and fear each other.

1005
01:00:27,962 --> 01:00:30,664
At its heart,
this is a community,

1006
01:00:30,698 --> 01:00:33,868
you know, one that agrees
about more than it doesn't.

1007
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:36,837
You know, hard work.

1008
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:39,840
Be a good neighbor.

1009
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:42,776
Warm place to meet,
have a sandwich.

1010
01:00:45,146 --> 01:00:47,281
Love.

1011
01:00:47,314 --> 01:00:51,620
All I'm asking is that
we remember our common...

1012
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:55,956
our common humanity.

1013
01:00:55,990 --> 01:01:01,162
And we just hold off on being enemies
till we've all had a little sleep.

1014
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:10,971
[Gwen] Fuck that noise.

1015
01:01:11,005 --> 01:01:13,307
I saw what happened to Pete
and I saw what happened to Dave

1016
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,910
and I'm not gonna stick around and
let that happen to me and Marcus.

1017
01:01:15,943 --> 01:01:18,345
- Let's go, Marcus.
- Hell yeah.

1018
01:01:18,379 --> 01:01:20,848
[Marcus] It's safer out there
than it is in this hellhole.

1019
01:01:24,018 --> 01:01:25,587
- Fuck your house.
- [cuckoo clock chimes]

1020
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,322
So I hope y'all dildos
get eaten by a wolf.

1021
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:33,127
- [door closes]
- Okay. Well, this is where I also go my own way.

1022
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,095
I had just about enough
of this town, huh?

1023
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:40,701
[door closes]

1024
01:01:40,734 --> 01:01:45,739
Once again, fear and intolerance
has reared its ugly head.

1025
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:48,042
We are going to wait this out
at home

1026
01:01:48,075 --> 01:01:50,010
or at least until the cops
get here.

1027
01:01:50,044 --> 01:01:52,614
Say goodbye to your
stupid craft store, Trish.

1028
01:01:52,647 --> 01:01:57,552
Oh, okay. Petey boy, let's get you
home, hon. Come on, come on.

[both grunting]

01:01:59,153 --> 01:02:02,056

They'll get theirs.

1031
01:02:03,757 --> 01:02:05,426
[both laugh]

1032
01:02:05,459 --> 01:02:08,495
[Trisha] They'll get what's
coming.

1033
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,431
- They'll get what they deserve.
- [Pete] Ow!

Hey.

1036
01:02:24,512 --> 01:02:26,180
How are you going to
protect yourself?

1037
01:02:26,213 --> 01:02:29,116
Oh, uh, got my trusty
bear spray.

1038
01:02:29,149 --> 01:02:31,785
- Okay, good.
- Yeah. All right.

01:03:50,964 --> 01:03:53,867
Oh! [pants]

1045
01:03:53,901 --> 01:03:55,369
There's something
in Parker's room.

1046
01:03:56,638 --> 01:03:59,406
[all screaming]

1047
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,710
I'm sorry! Oh, God. What now?

1048
01:04:01,743 --> 01:04:04,178
[stammers]

1049
01:04:04,211 --> 01:04:07,181
Janine, just, uh,
go to your room, lock your door.

1050
01:04:07,214 --> 01:04:08,849
Don't come up for anybody, okay?

1051
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:12,687
Okay.

1052
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:18,760
- I thought he left.
- Me, too.

1053
01:04:33,907 --> 01:04:35,777
Looks like Parker left
that window open.

1054
01:04:47,756 --> 01:04:49,657
[music]

1055
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:04,706
Hey, Finn.

1056
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,574
Yeah?

1057
01:05:11,513 --> 01:05:15,482
Did you say you were
at Grout Pond and Townshend?

1058
01:05:16,684 --> 01:05:17,719
[Finn] Yeah.

1059
01:05:24,692 --> 01:05:25,727
Why?

1060
01:05:34,803 --> 01:05:37,705
[Joaquim] Are you seriously giving
me the silent treatment right now?

1061
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:40,809
[Devon] You seriously wanna go back to that
chicken shit madhouse with those people?

1062
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:42,677
[Joaquim] Oh well, I'm sorry,
babe, but sue me, okay?

1063
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,478
You know what they say,
safety in numbers.

1064
01:05:44,512 --> 01:05:45,847
Yeah, more like not safety
in numbers.

1065
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,782
- [twig snaps]
- [Joaquim gasps]

1066
01:05:47,816 --> 01:05:50,184
- What was that?
- It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.

1067
01:05:50,217 --> 01:05:52,520
- Watch your step.
- [Joaquim gasps]

1068
01:05:52,554 --> 01:05:55,189
- Who's there? Who's there?
- [Devon] Who is that?

1069
01:05:55,222 --> 01:05:57,224
- Let's go. [screams]
- [growling]

1070
01:05:59,326 --> 01:06:00,728
Hey, Cec.

1071
01:06:02,996 --> 01:06:04,198
What's that smell like?

1072
01:06:21,381 --> 01:06:22,416
Diesel.

1073
01:06:24,117 --> 01:06:25,653
- The generators.
- The generators.

1074
01:06:25,687 --> 01:06:28,088
[Joaquim screams]
This isn't funny!

1075
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:32,359
- Hey, stop fucking with us.
- I'll fuck you up so hard.

1076
01:06:33,828 --> 01:06:35,763
- [Joaquim] Baby, let's go. Let's go.
- Shh.

1077
01:06:38,232 --> 01:06:39,801
- [Joaquim gasps]
- [both scream]

1078
01:06:44,204 --> 01:06:45,573
[Finn] Wait a minute.

1079
01:06:48,475 --> 01:06:49,944
What the heck is this about?

1080
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:55,884
- Oh, my God. [chuckles]
- What?

1081
01:06:55,917 --> 01:07:00,454
[Cecily] <i>Townshend,
Grout Pond, Beaverfield.</i>

1082
01:07:00,487 --> 01:07:03,290
- Joaquim!
- Parker's tracking the attacks.

1083
01:07:04,124 --> 01:07:06,059
Oh, shit. [grunts]

1084
01:07:08,428 --> 01:07:10,097
I'm going to go check
the barricade.

1085
01:07:10,899 --> 01:07:13,467
[clattering]

1086
01:07:15,737 --> 01:07:16,871
What was that?

1087
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:22,142
[groans] You?

1088
01:07:24,712 --> 01:07:26,146
I know, hon.

1089
01:07:26,179 --> 01:07:28,950
Trish. What the fuck?

1090
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,421
Maple tap.

1091
01:07:34,454 --> 01:07:37,559
It's where the sweet stuff
comes out.

1092
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:39,493
What?

1093
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:44,866
I want my craft store.

1094
01:07:46,668 --> 01:07:47,635
[gasps]

1095
01:07:47,669 --> 01:07:49,737
[Parker grunts]

1096
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:52,006
[cuckoo clock chimes]

1097
01:08:01,148 --> 01:08:03,751
[music]

1098
01:08:30,578 --> 01:08:32,013
[creaks]

1099
01:08:34,616 --> 01:08:35,650
[Parker] Hey!

1100
01:08:48,062 --> 01:08:50,064
[Parker] You're probably
a bit confused.

1101
01:08:51,866 --> 01:08:56,004
And why is this gas guy wearing
a bunch of fancy hunting gear?

1102
01:08:57,204 --> 01:09:00,942
I always hunted as a hobby,

1103
01:09:00,975 --> 01:09:07,615
but when Ellis said one of you could
be a lycanthrope, a werewolf...

1104
01:09:07,649 --> 01:09:12,053
Well, news of this predator around the
state suddenly made a whole lot of sense.

1105
01:09:15,455 --> 01:09:19,060
- Are you okay? Yeah.
- Yeah. Are you?

1106
01:09:19,093 --> 01:09:20,394
- [hisses] Hi.
- [Cecily screams]

1107
01:09:20,427 --> 01:09:22,797
Why is that Parker dressed
like a scary cowboy?

1108
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:25,066
- [Cecily] I think I just pissed my pants.
- Sorry.

1109
01:09:25,099 --> 01:09:27,802
We were being chased, and then we got
separated from each other, but then...

1110
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:30,905
Wait, are you guys...
Why are you guys hiding?

1111
01:09:30,938 --> 01:09:32,707
Parker thinks
he's hunting werewolves.

1112
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,241
He sabotaged the generator.

1113
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:37,879
- Where's Devon?
- I don't know.

1114
01:09:37,912 --> 01:09:40,414
We were... We were together,
and then we got separated,

1115
01:09:40,447 --> 01:09:43,417
and then I got lost,
and then something's out there.

1116
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:44,886
Something's out there,
I think.

1117
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:48,589
- I think he got him.
- Where was this?

1118
01:09:48,623 --> 01:09:50,625
It was by Trish's house.

1119
01:10:01,602 --> 01:10:04,138
If I know Devon, he probably
came here for safety,

1120
01:10:04,172 --> 01:10:07,508
so he's probably in here,
right?

1121
01:10:07,542 --> 01:10:09,077
- Devon?
- [Cecily] Ssh! What are you doing?

1122
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:11,679
Oh, yeah, you're right, you're right.
I'm sorry, I won't do that.

1123
01:10:11,713 --> 01:10:13,881
- Devon, baby!
- Ssh!

1124
01:10:13,915 --> 01:10:16,383
- [Finn] Joaquim, stop!
- Devon! Baby, is that you?

1125
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,618
- [Finn] Hey, wait.
- Baby.

1126
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,822
Boy, you just had
to be strong.

1127
01:10:21,789 --> 01:10:22,824
Now you're dead.

1128
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:25,258
But...

1129
01:10:25,292 --> 01:10:26,326
Marcus?

1130
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:31,733
Marcus, what the hell
are you doing?

1131
01:10:31,766 --> 01:10:33,935
What are you doing?
What am I doing?

1132
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:36,403
That's easy, Ranger,
what am I doing?

1133
01:10:36,436 --> 01:10:40,141
I taped... I taped knives to my
hands, and then underneath,

1134
01:10:40,174 --> 01:10:43,144
it's just my hand,
but it's deadly with the knives on it.

1135
01:10:43,177 --> 01:10:44,812
And I'm going to steal
everybody's shit

1136
01:10:44,846 --> 01:10:46,981
and then I'm going to make it
look like a werewolf did it.

1137
01:10:47,014 --> 01:10:49,117
Well, if you end up being the werewolf,
that's a big fucking disappointment.

1138
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:52,987
- Right?
- Okay, Marcus, I see you have some knives.

1139
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:54,689
- Back off!
- [Cecily screams]

1140
01:10:54,722 --> 01:10:57,592
- That's my work shirt.
- Stay back! Stay back!

1141
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:59,894
Maybe I'm the werewolf,
maybe you became the werewolf.

1142
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:03,164
Weren't you a werewolf part-time,
motherfucker? Weren't you a werewolf?

1143
01:11:03,197 --> 01:11:05,099
I'm the full-time werewolf,
bitch.

1144
01:11:05,133 --> 01:11:09,302
- Is there even a werewolf?
- I don't know, I don't have to answer your questions, bitch.

1145
01:11:09,336 --> 01:11:12,272
- [pot breaking]
- [Cecily screams]

1146
01:11:12,305 --> 01:11:16,043
[cackles] You little
bitches can't catch a cold.

1147
01:11:16,077 --> 01:11:18,846
I said, don't see you,
don't want to be you, now, little punk.

1148
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,782
You guys probably are
so dead right now

1149
01:11:20,815 --> 01:11:26,788
'cause I'm your only friend, really, if you
think about it. Don't get eaten. [howls]

1150
01:11:26,821 --> 01:11:30,490
- Marcus, let's go, brainless!
- [gunshot]

1151
01:11:31,358 --> 01:11:33,694
Got you, homewrecker.

1152
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:39,867
- Yeah, this town's bat shit.
- Let's go inside, out the back, let's go out the back, please.

1153
01:11:39,901 --> 01:11:42,170
[Joaquim] She still has
her tiny BB gun! Fucking bitch.

1154
01:11:42,203 --> 01:11:44,071
That's very rude.
My house, you're trespassing.

1155
01:11:44,105 --> 01:11:48,109
Trespassers will be shot on
command, they will be shot on sight.

1156
01:11:49,544 --> 01:11:52,146
No. Oh, I know another way in.

1157
01:11:56,349 --> 01:11:57,852
- [hisses]
- [gasps]

1158
01:11:57,885 --> 01:11:59,754
- [Trisha] Nobody move.
- What is she, Michael Myers?

1159
01:11:59,787 --> 01:12:02,389
What? Wipe your feet.

1160
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:04,659
See, clean. Wiped.

1161
01:12:04,692 --> 01:12:07,195
- Super, they're so clean, right?
- [mumbling]

1162
01:12:07,228 --> 01:12:09,997
Listen, back up!
Just keep moving back.

1163
01:12:10,031 --> 01:12:12,700
- Come on. Watch where you're going.
- [Cecily] Hey.

1164
01:12:12,733 --> 01:12:15,102
Happy family, line up,
line up.

1165
01:12:15,136 --> 01:12:19,674
You people do not
belong here.

1166
01:12:19,707 --> 01:12:22,076
You don't belong in this town,

1167
01:12:22,109 --> 01:12:24,612
in this house,
and you sure as Shinola

1168
01:12:24,645 --> 01:12:29,482
don't get to tell me
what to do with my property.

1169
01:12:29,517 --> 01:12:32,452
Trish, did you do
something to my husband?

1170
01:12:32,485 --> 01:12:36,891
- Did you kill Devon?
- Oh, I don't care what you do in your own home.

1171
01:12:36,924 --> 01:12:43,231
Your little husband should have
kept his nose in his own beeswax,

1172
01:12:43,264 --> 01:12:49,670
and you all should've let
Mr. Parker build his pipe... Peter!

1173
01:12:49,704 --> 01:12:50,938
Peter!

1174
01:12:53,473 --> 01:12:56,043
What did you do?
Peter, no.

1175
01:12:56,077 --> 01:12:58,445
- You killed Peter.
- You killed my husband.

1176
01:13:01,082 --> 01:13:03,483
[gasps] Is she okay?

1177
01:13:03,517 --> 01:13:05,319
She's okay.

1178
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:06,386
Trish?

1179
01:13:08,789 --> 01:13:09,757
[gasps]

1180
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:12,760
Let's leave, please.

1181
01:13:12,793 --> 01:13:14,962
Okay, Ranger, put on your ranger
hat, what are we doing?

1182
01:13:14,996 --> 01:13:16,898
All right. Well,
we're going to take Marcus' truck

1183
01:13:16,931 --> 01:13:21,269
as far as we can, uh, you know, maybe fi...
Ugh! Sorry, Marcus.

1184
01:13:21,302 --> 01:13:24,372
- Sorry, Marcus.
- And find some snowshoes, and get the heck off this mountain.

1185
01:13:24,404 --> 01:13:26,908
- [Cecily] Dude loves snowshoes.
- [Finn] Well, it's the oldest,

1186
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:29,476
most effective means of traversing
ice and snow... Oh, God!

1187
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:32,713
- Is that...?
- [Cecily] Parker.

1188
01:13:32,747 --> 01:13:35,283
Why is he you hunting?
Why are you hunting us?

1189
01:13:35,316 --> 01:13:37,218
Ssh! I don't know. You know?

1190
01:13:37,251 --> 01:13:39,987
Cec was the youngest of seven,
you guys are blocking his pipeline,

1191
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:43,925
and I'm the pain in the ass
sent to give him a hard time.

1192
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:46,027
So he could be hunting
any of us.

1193
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:50,164
[Finn] But it's not any of us, 'cause none of
us has seen any actual evidence of a werewolf.

1194
01:13:50,197 --> 01:13:52,133
- [Cecily] Finn.
- No, yeah, good point.

1195
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:55,102
Ellis was taking all those hair samples with
that machine thing. I mean, science, am I right?

1196
01:13:55,136 --> 01:13:57,805
It's just,
something doesn't add up.

1197
01:13:57,838 --> 01:13:59,173
[Cecily gasps]

1198
01:14:04,045 --> 01:14:08,282
Joaquim,
what are you doing, man?

1199
01:14:08,316 --> 01:14:10,017
She's a seventh born.

1200
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:13,421
I mean you said it your goddamn
self, Ranger, didn't you? Okay?

1201
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:15,323
We're not crazy. Okay.
We're not crazy. [laughs]

1202
01:14:15,356 --> 01:14:17,091
- Kinda...!
- No, we're not, okay?!

1203
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:19,492
You're the fucking werewolf!
Okay? She's the werewolf, okay?

1204
01:14:19,527 --> 01:14:22,830
- So we have to... [pants]
- Please put the gun down, okay?

1205
01:14:22,863 --> 01:14:25,433
I can't, okay?! I can't!

1206
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:29,704
- Because I live in Argentina, the seventh born is a werewolf!
- It's just superstition!

1207
01:14:29,737 --> 01:14:34,075
Shut the fuck up, girl, [cries] I love
you so much, I have to kill your ass.

1208
01:14:34,108 --> 01:14:39,613
I know it's been a long,
long day.

1209
01:14:39,647 --> 01:14:41,415
I know, right? [cries]

1210
01:14:41,449 --> 01:14:43,918
Maybe just put the gun down
because... [screams]

1211
01:14:43,951 --> 01:14:45,152
[Cecily screams]

1212
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:56,464
Ow.

1213
01:14:58,332 --> 01:15:01,435
[Cecily] Finn, what do we do?!
What do we do now?!

1214
01:15:01,469 --> 01:15:03,070
[Finn] Okay. [grunts]

1215
01:15:03,104 --> 01:15:05,039
- Start the truck.
- [Cecily whimpers]

1216
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:07,675
[whimpers]

1217
01:15:11,412 --> 01:15:13,848
- Finn, it won't start!
- Try again!

1218
01:15:13,881 --> 01:15:15,616
I'm fucking trying!

1219
01:15:17,018 --> 01:15:19,153
[engine sputters]

1220
01:15:20,354 --> 01:15:22,123
- [screams]
- Let's go, darling.

1221
01:15:22,156 --> 01:15:25,426
- [Cecily screams]
- Fight me, come on.

1222
01:15:27,728 --> 01:15:32,500
[Parker] Family of four,
mauled to death in Townshend.

1223
01:15:32,533 --> 01:15:35,202
Couple of college kids
mangled in Grout Pond,

1224
01:15:35,236 --> 01:15:38,873
all around the same time
that you were there.

1225
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:42,143
Then you came to Beaverfield.

1226
01:15:43,944 --> 01:15:48,416
Yeah, you put yourself in
charge, you discovered Dave,

1227
01:15:48,449 --> 01:15:52,053
now that's a... [laughs] that's a bit
obvious, don't you think there, Ranger?

1228
01:15:53,654 --> 01:15:55,890
[Cecily crying]
Finn, what's he talking about?

1229
01:15:56,891 --> 01:15:58,092
[grunts]

1230
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,662
[Finn] Come on, Cec.

1231
01:16:01,695 --> 01:16:06,367
- He sabotaged the generator.
- No, that was you, Ranger.

1232
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,637
See, I found a diesel-drenched
knife in your room.

1233
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:13,441
I... We found that in your room,
it's not possible.

1234
01:16:13,474 --> 01:16:14,842
I don't know what to believe.

1235
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:17,144
You pitted this community
against itself

1236
01:16:17,178 --> 01:16:20,848
with your promises,
your money.

1237
01:16:20,881 --> 01:16:22,450
You brought out the worst
of these people.

1238
01:16:23,717 --> 01:16:25,554
There's no animal
on a killing spree.

1239
01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:28,322
There's no monster.

1240
01:16:29,356 --> 01:16:30,891
The only monster here is you.

1241
01:16:31,659 --> 01:16:32,927
Maybe you're right.

1242
01:16:34,095 --> 01:16:36,263
Well, better safe than sorry.

1243
01:16:36,297 --> 01:16:38,499
- [screams] No!
- [grunts]

1244
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:40,401
[yells, grunts]

1245
01:16:42,369 --> 01:16:44,939
- Finn! Finn, look out.
- Cecily, are you okay?

1246
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:46,674
[both grunt]

1247
01:16:51,045 --> 01:16:53,047
[Cecily] Finn!

1248
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,282
- Eat some silver!
- [Cecily screams]

1249
01:16:55,316 --> 01:16:56,851
[screams]

1250
01:16:56,884 --> 01:17:01,155
[Cecily] Yes! Yes! Finn!
Get up!

1251
01:17:02,723 --> 01:17:04,425
- Finn!
- [grunts]

1252
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:07,061
[Joaquim] Excuse me, Mr. Parker.

1253
01:17:10,397 --> 01:17:12,166
Your pipeline is trash.

1254
01:17:15,069 --> 01:17:17,304
- Fuck.
- [gunshot]

1255
01:17:40,261 --> 01:17:42,730
That was really fucked up.

1256
01:17:42,763 --> 01:17:45,900
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

1257
01:17:52,673 --> 01:17:55,176
Hmm. Power is back.

1258
01:17:55,209 --> 01:17:59,146
Ooh, that's not good.

1259
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:03,717
Oh, my God, Finn. Okay, come on, we got
to get you inside, let's go, let's go.

1260
01:18:03,751 --> 01:18:07,121
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh.

1261
01:18:07,154 --> 01:18:10,791
[grunts] Oh, this is much worse
than I thought.

1262
01:18:10,824 --> 01:18:12,426
Yeah, it's pretty bad.
You know what?

1263
01:18:12,459 --> 01:18:14,361
- I'm gonna go get the first aid kit, okay?
- Okay, I'm dying, I think.

1264
01:18:14,395 --> 01:18:16,665
No, you're not going to die.
You're not going to die.

1265
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:18,533
Hey, can you promise me
that you're not going to die?

1266
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:21,570
'Cause it would probably traumatize
me for the rest of my life.

1267
01:18:21,603 --> 01:18:26,508
And also, 'cause I, um...
I really like you,

1268
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:31,845
and I, um... I'm very grateful
that you saved my life,

1269
01:18:33,582 --> 01:18:36,150
so you're not
going to die, okay? Okay?

1270
01:18:36,183 --> 01:18:39,654
- Okay, Say, "okay." Say, okay. Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1271
01:18:43,357 --> 01:18:46,060
Okay, I'm going to see
if the phones are back up.

1272
01:18:51,332 --> 01:18:56,170
[faint whistle trills]

1273
01:19:13,053 --> 01:19:14,723
[whistle continues]

1274
01:19:22,863 --> 01:19:25,966
[Parker's voice] <i>You know, nothing's going
to get down that mountain but a snowplow.</i>

1275
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,270
[Gwen's voice] <i>Just need that
starter fuel injector I ordered.</i>

1276
01:19:33,642 --> 01:19:35,543
[music]

1277
01:20:04,071 --> 01:20:05,640
[whistle ringtone trills]

1278
01:20:56,323 --> 01:20:57,759
It's you, isn't it?

1279
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:11,004
[bones crack]

1280
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:13,808
- Were you even in a punk band?
- Yeah.

1281
01:21:13,842 --> 01:21:16,210
We just didn't actually
break up, though.

1282
01:21:17,545 --> 01:21:21,649
- You ate them.
- I ate them. Yes.

1283
01:21:21,683 --> 01:21:24,819
Oh, come on, Finn, didn't I seem
a little too good to be true?

1284
01:21:25,486 --> 01:21:27,121
No.

1285
01:21:27,154 --> 01:21:29,524
[stammers] You seemed great.

1286
01:21:29,557 --> 01:21:34,562
Oh, no, Finn, help me. What do we do now?
The car won't start.

1287
01:21:34,596 --> 01:21:39,133
Finn, Sam Parker has me by the hair.
That's great?

1288
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:41,101
Don't yell at me.

1289
01:21:41,135 --> 01:21:44,071
That's not yelling.
That's taking a tone.

1290
01:21:44,672 --> 01:21:46,473
This is yelling.

1291
01:21:46,508 --> 01:21:52,246
[howls]

1292
01:21:57,886 --> 01:22:00,855
- You're really a...
- Werewolf.

1293
01:22:01,488 --> 01:22:03,157
Yeah.

1294
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:05,760
Werewolves are real.

1295
01:22:05,794 --> 01:22:09,564
Women who raid <i>Walden</i>
while drinking kombucha,

1296
01:22:09,597 --> 01:22:13,835
and getting turned on by your
Yellowstone stories, they're a fantasy.

1297
01:22:17,004 --> 01:22:18,372
[whistle ringtone trills]

1298
01:22:18,405 --> 01:22:21,074
- [Dave's voice] <i>Hello?</i>
- You killed Dave.

1299
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:23,745
- [screams]
- I needed an outfit.

1300
01:22:23,778 --> 01:22:26,714
There can only be
one postal worker.

1301
01:22:26,748 --> 01:22:28,883
It was really
a districting thing.

1302
01:22:28,917 --> 01:22:30,484
You ate Trish's dog.

1303
01:22:31,151 --> 01:22:33,153
My baby.

1304
01:22:33,187 --> 01:22:36,089
- And you ate Pete, his hand.
- [screams]

1305
01:22:36,123 --> 01:22:38,425
[Pete screams] <i>I was attacked!</i>

1306
01:22:38,459 --> 01:22:43,130
Some men do this thing
when they want to guide you,

1307
01:22:43,163 --> 01:22:47,635
where they put their hand
on your lower back.

1308
01:22:50,772 --> 01:22:52,005
I hate that.

1309
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:55,577
- Cecily, the mailman.
- No, thank you.

1310
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:59,881
- Should've bitten off both hands.
- Why couldn't you just hunt?

1311
01:22:59,914 --> 01:23:02,349
Which is a brilliant idea,
you think I didn't try that?

1312
01:23:02,382 --> 01:23:04,251
[men screaming]

1313
01:23:04,284 --> 01:23:07,589
I did. It was exhausting,
but Beaverfield is perfect.

1314
01:23:07,622 --> 01:23:09,958
There's lots of festering
resentments,

1315
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:12,426
made all the spicier
way by this pipeline drama.

1316
01:23:12,459 --> 01:23:15,730
I don't let people fuck
with my money.

1317
01:23:15,763 --> 01:23:19,333
All I had to do was plant
a tiny little doggy's collar...

1318
01:23:19,366 --> 01:23:21,435
[Cecily's voice] <i>Emerson killed
Chachi.</i>

1319
01:23:21,468 --> 01:23:23,504
...spread a couple of rumors.

1320
01:23:23,538 --> 01:23:26,240
[Parker's voice] I found a
diesel-drenched knife in your room.

1321
01:23:29,243 --> 01:23:32,981
Everyone else just took care
of themselves with their fear,

1322
01:23:33,013 --> 01:23:38,620
and greed, and their own
petty nature.

1323
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,656
I mean, I'm going to eat them
later,

1324
01:23:41,689 --> 01:23:44,993
and I knew there'd be that
snowstorm but that road blockage,

1325
01:23:45,025 --> 01:23:46,995
mm, baby, just... [smacks lips]

1326
01:23:49,263 --> 01:23:53,001
Hmm. You almost blew up my shit,
though, you know that, right?

1327
01:23:53,033 --> 01:23:59,373
I kept trying to turn you into one of
them, but you're pathological.

1328
01:23:59,406 --> 01:24:03,210
And what is my pathology
exactly?

1329
01:24:03,243 --> 01:24:07,982
You're too fucking nice
with your kumbaya speeches

1330
01:24:08,016 --> 01:24:11,351
and your small town, "Gee,
golly goodness." Blow me.

1331
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:17,692
This town is full of two-faced
assholes and you know it.

1332
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,995
You're a monster.

1333
01:24:21,029 --> 01:24:24,364
Girl's got to eat,
and I got dinner on ice until spring.

1334
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:30,972
- [laughs]
- What?

1335
01:24:31,005 --> 01:24:32,272
You mock me for being nice.

1336
01:24:32,306 --> 01:24:39,146
This whole time, you've been
mocking me for being nice,

1337
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:41,214
but... but you know what?

1338
01:24:41,248 --> 01:24:45,753
I got to tell you, I'm a nice
person, all right? I'm considerate.

1339
01:24:45,787 --> 01:24:50,090
I'm compassionate. I care. People want me to
