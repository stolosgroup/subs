1
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,620
What the hell
are you doing to me?

2
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,130
What are you doing?

3
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,710
Goddamn it! Where am I?

4
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,300
A boat! A fishing boat.
You were in the water.

5
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,640
We pulled you out.

6
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,010
What water?

7
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,600
You were shot. See?
There are the bullets.

8
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,520
Look, there is a number
for a bank.
Why was it in your hip?

9
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,980
My hip?

10
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,650
Why was it in your hip?
My hip.

11
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,440
Yeah, in your hip
under the skin.

12
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,860
Oh, God.

13
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,150
What are you gonna
do with me?

14
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,990
You need to rest.
Wait.

15
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,780
Please. Lie down.

16
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,910
I'm a friend.
I'm your friend.

17
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,040
My name is Giancarlo.

18
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,080
Who are you?

19
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,920
What's your name?

20
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,210
What's your name?

21
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,050
I don't know.

22
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,760
Oh, God.
Lie down.

23
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,960
It's been confirmed, sir.
Mission failed.

24
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,620
If you want to eat,
you'd better
get in there.

25
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,000
You know,
based on
these charts,

26
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,460
I think I may have been
closer to the coast.

27
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,290
What is this?
You tie these knots?

28
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,300
So, it starts to
come back?

29
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,880
No, it doesn't
start to come back.

30
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,260
The knot's like
everything else. I just found
the rope and I did it.

31
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,640
Same way I can read.

32
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,760
I can write.
I can add, subtract.
I can make coffee.

33
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,810
I can shuffle cards,
set up a chessboard.

34
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,140
Yes, it will come back.

35
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,520
No, it's not coming back,
goddamn it!
That's the point!

36
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,690
I'm down here
looking through this,
all this shit!

37
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,690
For two weeks I'm down here.

38
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,900
It's not working.
I don't even know
what to look for.

39
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,830
You need to rest.
It will come back.

40
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,500
What if it
doesn't come back?

41
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,250
We get in there tomorrow,
I don't even have a name.

42
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,790
It's not much,
but it should get you
to Switzerland.

43
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,710
Thank you.

44
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,650
All right.

45
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,240
No, I don't...

46
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,740
I don't have any papers.
I lost my...

47
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,530
<i>These people
have threatened my family.
My babies.</i>

48
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,070
<i>So l'm telling you,
when the evidence is clear,</i>

49
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,870
<i>l will have a nice story
for you to read about.</i>

50
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,120
<i>And all my friends out there,
you will read
about yourselves.</i>

51
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,870
<i>'Cause if you want to
play this game</i>

52
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,130
<i>after l have been reasonable,
l will show you.</i>

53
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,300
That's Nykwana Wombosi
speaking in Paris
the day before yesterday.

54
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,170
He was an irritation
before he took power,
he was a problem

55
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,850
when he was in power,
and he's been a disaster
for us in exile.

56
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,470
He's writing a book
about the Agency's
history in Africa.

57
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,060
He's going to name names.

58
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,310
It's basically a shakedown.
He's demanding
the Agency's help.

59
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,110
He wants us to put him
back in power
in six months, or else.

60
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,740
This interview, and
I'll make the tape available
to whoever wants it,

61
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,450
he goes on to claim
that he's just survived
an assassination attempt.

62
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,990
He says it's us.
He says he's got proof.

63
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,870
The Director wants to know
if there's any shred of truth

64
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,660
in this accusation.

65
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,750
I've already assured him
there's nobody that reckless
on my senior staff.

66
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,050
I was recalling
a conversation we had
some time ago.

67
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,890
Talking about
Treadstone.

68
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,770
I seem to remember
Wombosi's name
might have come up.

69
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,900
I'm not sure
what we're talking about.

70
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,690
Someone tried
to take him out.

71
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,690
Tried and failed.

72
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,360
Was this Treadstone?

73
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,820
You're asking me
a direct question?

74
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,450
Yes.

75
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,120
I thought you were
never gonna do that.

76
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,700
What happened?

77
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,340
Well, we lost
the communication
with our man.

78
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,130
This was almost
two weeks ago.

79
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,670
We've been working
around the clock.
The whole unit.

80
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,880
We've been
sleeping down there.

81
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,140
We're doing
everything we can.

82
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,260
And you don't
let me know this?

83
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,140
You never wanted
to before.

84
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,180
You never made
a mistake before.

85
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,050
Yes, I'm here about
a numbered account.

86
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,180
If you just enter
your account number here,

87
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,020
I'll direct you to
an appropriate officer.

88
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,350
My name is Jason Bourne.

89
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,900
I live in Paris.

90
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,560
<i>Yes, in Paris.</i>

91
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,520
<i>Do you have the number
for a Jason Bourne?</i>

92
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,270
<i>Yes, sir.
Would you like me to
connect you?</i>

93
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,730
Yes, please.

94
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,620
<i>This is 46 99 03 84.</i>

95
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,950
<i>Leave a message at the beep.</i>

96
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,350
I'm an American.

97
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,520
Okay.

98
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,400
Hold it.

99
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,320
Wait. You have
no jurisdiction here.

100
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,190
Hold it there.
Okay?

101
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,200
No.

102
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,830
Excuse me. No.
This is not my
current address, okay?

103
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,870
This was my address
until two days ago,

104
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,790
when I started
standing in line.

105
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,080
Now I lose
my apartment, okay?

106
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,000
That means
no address, no phone,
no money, no time.

107
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,550
And I still have no visa!
Miss Kreutz, please.

108
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,710
I'll have to ask you
to keep your voice down.

109
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,050
Excuse me. I mean,
but where's the guy
that I talked to last week?

110
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,600
Every week it's a new person.
How am I supposed to...

111
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,310
I don't know who
you saw last week.

112
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,310
Well, let me help you.
I'm sure I have it.
Wait. Hang on.

113
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,480
Could I have your
attention for a moment?

114
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,650
I have it right here.
Just look at it.

115
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,980
You staged an effort
to circumvent the immigration
laws of the United States.

116
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,110
This is
a student visa now.

117
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,360
It's not about
a green card anymore.
It's completely different.

118
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,570
It's not a menu,
Miss Kreutz.
You don't...

119
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,410
I brought
all this proof.

120
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,790
<i>Potential suspect...</i>

121
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,160
<i>Help in assault incident.</i>

122
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,920
You! Red bag!
The red bag!

123
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,880
Stop right there!
Put your hands up!

124
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,550
I'm on it.

125
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,260
<i>Move it! Now! Now! Move!</i>

126
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,100
<i>Alpha Unit, take
the back stairs and
work your way up. Bravo...</i>

127
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,900
<i>Move in! Move in!</i>

128
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,950
Okay, clear!

129
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,080
<i>The suspect is...</i>

130
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,410
<i>Bravo Unit.
Moving up staircase.
Proceeding to second floor.</i>

131
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,290
<i>Alpha Unit, you're clear.</i>

132
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,300
<i>Move! Move!</i>

133
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,520
<i>Alpha, Bravo Units,
target may have a radio.</i>

134
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,640
<i>Go to Code 77. Over.</i>

135
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,690
<i>Code 77, copy.</i>

136
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,520
The floor! Down!

137
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,320
Clear!

138
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,700
Go. Move up. Move up.

139
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,470
He's in Zurich now?
Right now?

140
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,140
Yes.
It just came in.

141
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,350
But they're sure?
They're sure it's him?

142
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,640
Yes. He went
to the bank.

143
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,520
Our source at the bank,
that's who called.

144
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,650
Come on.

145
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,020
But he's got to assume
we're watching
the bank, right?

146
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,190
I don't know. Come on.

147
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,610
I mean,
he cleaned out the box.

148
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,700
He left a gun.
What does that mean?

149
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,530
I said I don't know!

150
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,910
I liked it better
when I thought
he was dead.

151
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,260
What are you looking at?

152
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,050
I heard you inside.

153
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,140
What?

154
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,510
The consulate.
I heard you talking.

155
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,930
I thought maybe
we could
help each other.

156
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,390
How's that?

157
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,940
You need money.
I need a ride
out of here.

158
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,980
I'm not running
a car service.
Thank you.

159
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,610
I'll give you $10,000
to drive me to Paris.

160
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,120
What is this, a joke?
Some kind of scam?

161
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,000
No, it's no scam.

162
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,380
And I'll give you
another $10,000
when we get there.

163
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,000
Jesus.

164
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,550
Is that for you?

165
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,970
Look. You drive, I pay.
It's that simple.

166
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,690
I got enough
trouble, okay?

167
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,190
Okay.

168
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,270
Can I have
my money back?

169
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,000
All right, go.
Keep going.

170
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,580
Go.

171
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,340
There! Wait!

172
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,670
No, it's got to be
near the end.

173
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,800
Come on, folks!
We caught a break here!
Let's go!

174
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,010
Okay, I'm up.

175
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,140
We're getting grids.
Airline, train,
hotels, hospitals.

176
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,550
Who's getting
the address? The street?

177
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Gemensheidt.

178
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,890
Here we go. I got it.
I think I got it.

179
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,310
Is it him?

180
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,890
Unreal.

181
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,650
This is 38 minutes ago.

182
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,320
Zurich police are looking
for an American
carrying a red bank bag.

183
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,240
He just tore up the embassy
and he put two cops
in the hospital last night.

184
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,990
Get everybody up.
Do it now.
I want them all activated.

185
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,910
Wait. All of them?
At the same time?

186
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,620
You heard me.
I want Bourne in a body bag
by sundown.

187
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:55,540
All right, let's get
a map up here! Come on, folks!
Let's work it!

188
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,800
The grids
are getting updated.

189
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,920
<i>...which was
fine with me
because l was ready.</i>

190
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,590
<i>After six months in Amsterdam,
you're not sure</i>

191
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,800
<i>if you've been there
20 minutes or years,
if you know what l mean.</i>

192
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,350
So I went. And I took
all the money I had.
And I went in with friends,

193
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:34,980
and we took over this
cool surf shop outside
Biarritz, right by the water.

194
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,600
It was amazing.

195
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:41,150
It was just amazing
for about three months,
until it turned out that this

196
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,740
jerk who had fronted us
the lease was actually
shining everyone on and...

197
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,700
And what?

198
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,460
What do you mean "what"?
Listen to me.

199
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,130
I've been speed-talking
for about 60 kilometers now.

200
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,460
I talk when I'm nervous.
I mean, I talk like this
when I'm nervous.

201
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,710
I'm gonna shut up now.

202
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,220
No, don't do that.

203
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,220
I haven't talked to
anybody in a while.

204
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,890
Yeah, but we're not
talking. I'm talking.

205
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,810
You've said,
like, 10 words
since we left Zurich.

206
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,520
Well, listening to you,
it's relaxing.

207
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,400
I haven't
slept in a while and...

208
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,110
And I've had
this headache.

209
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,530
It's like a constant thing
inside my head

210
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:33,080
and it's just starting
to move to the background,

211
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,700
so keep going.

212
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,120
Really, if you want,
please keep talking.

213
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,290
Okay.

214
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,920
What kind of music
do you like?

215
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,970
What do you like?
Come on.

216
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,220
You know what?
Never mind.

217
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,760
No, it's fine.
Tell me.

218
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,560
What do you want to
listen to?

219
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,730
I don't know.

220
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,110
Come on, it's not that hard.
What do you like? Tell me.

221
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,650
I don't know.

222
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,620
Who pays $20,000
for a ride to Paris?

223
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,050
Fuck it.

224
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,550
I can't remember
anything that happened
before two weeks ago.

225
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,510
Lucky you.
No, I'm serious.

226
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,770
I don't know who I am.
I don't know
where I'm going.

227
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,480
None of it.

228
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,350
What? Like amnesia?

229
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,650
Yes.

230
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,320
Amnesia.
Yes.

231
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,620
Right.

232
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,870
And that's the best angle
of the courtyard?

233
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,290
That's the only angle.

234
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,750
What do they have
of the streets?
Or, you know, the area?

235
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,090
They must have
something.

236
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,380
Hang on.

237
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,010
What is he doing?

238
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,060
Is it a game?
Is he warning us?
Is it a threat?

239
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,850
Sir? Look at this.

240
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,770
What's that?

241
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,730
It's an angle of the street,
a sort of alley.

242
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,400
Just enhance it.

243
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,490
Now, who the hell is that?

244
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,910
Marie Helena Kreutz.

245
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,710
She's 26,
born outside Hanover.
Her father was a welder.

246
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,290
He died in '87.

247
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,080
We still don't
have the mother.

248
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,130
The grandmother,
she's still in Hanover.

249
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,710
It looks like she's
the anchor for this little
domestic disaster.

250
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,420
And there's a stepbrother.

251
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,510
It's tough.
The girl's a gypsy.

252
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:01,100
I mean, she pops up
on the grid here and there,
but it's chaotic at best.

253
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,640
She paid some electric bills
in Spain, '95.

254
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,770
Had a phone in her name
for three months
in Belgium, '96.

255
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,440
No taxes, no credit.

256
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,360
I don't like her.
I want to go deep.

257
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,990
Get a phone log for Granny
and the half-brother.

258
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,240
Anybody we can cross-file.

259
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,450
I want to know every place
she's slept in
the past six years.

260
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,250
Have Paris get these out
in the field.

261
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,110
<i>l'm not making this up.</i>

262
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,110
These are real.

263
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,200
Okay.

264
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,000
Who has
a safety deposit box
full of

265
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,670
money and six passports
and a gun?

266
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,130
Who has
a bank account number
in their hip?

267
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,640
I come in here, and the
first thing I'm doing is
I'm catching the sightlines

268
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,020
and looking for
an exit.

269
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,310
I see the exit sign, too.
I'm not worried.

270
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,060
I mean, you were shot.

271
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,820
People do all kinds of
weird and amazing stuff
when they are scared.

272
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,660
I can tell you
the license plate numbers
of all six cars outside.

273
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,620
I can tell you
that our waitress
is left-handed

274
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,000
and the guy sitting at
the counter weighs 215 pounds
and can handle himself.

275
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,840
I know the best place to look
for a gun is the cab
of the gray truck outside.

276
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,340
And at this altitude, I can
run flat out for a half-mile
before my hands start shaking.

277
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,430
Now why would I know that?

278
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,270
How can I know that
and not know who I am?

279
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,060
Hey.

280
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,900
I slept.

281
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,490
I can't believe it.

282
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,740
Yeah, well,
you were tired.

283
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,160
I haven't slept.

284
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,410
Oh, here. For $20,000,
I like to
throw in breakfast.

285
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,370
Did you stop for gas?

286
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,250
You were
pretty out of it.

287
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:24,760
So, do you think
there's, like,
a family waiting for you?

288
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,010
I don't know.

289
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,560
I've thought about it.

290
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,690
Is that it?

291
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,360
104.

292
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,320
Yeah, that's the address.
No, no, keep going.
Keep going.

293
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,030
Okay. Where?

294
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,990
Just take a left.
Pull in over here.

295
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,160
Okay.

296
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,640
So, this is it, right?

297
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,300
Yeah, I guess.

298
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,850
God, I don't recognize
any of this.

299
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,810
Okay. I should go.

300
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,320
Jason?

301
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,700
Oh, God.
The money. Right.

302
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,530
Yeah.

303
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,280
Here.

304
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,160
Thank you. Okay.

305
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,960
Thanks for the ride.

306
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,830
Anytime.

307
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,260
Well, you could come up.
I mean, or you can wait here.

308
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,430
I can go check it out.
But you could wait.

309
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,840
Oh, no, no.

310
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,470
You could wait.

311
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,980
With you, you would
probably just forget about me
if I stayed here.

312
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,850
How could
I forget about you?

313
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,570
You're the only person I know.

314
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,780
Yeah. That's true.

315
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,880
I guess you're not home.

316
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,420
Hello?

317
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,070
Are you sure
this is all yours?

318
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,230
I guess.

319
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,880
This is my kitchen.

320
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,490
Any clues?

321
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,490
I think I'm in
the shipping business.

322
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,740
So it's all coming back?

323
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,130
Do you mind
if I use the bathroom?

324
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,290
Sure.

325
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,300
Okay.

326
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,990
Yeah. Hello? Hello?

327
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,330
<i>Yes, sir, Hotel Regina, Paris.
How may l direct your call?</i>

328
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,620
Yeah, you're in Paris?

329
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,790
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

330
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:06,250
I'm looking for
a guest there.

331
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,130
A Jason Bourne.

332
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,380
<i>One moment, please.</i>

333
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,800
Thank you.

334
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,550
<i>l'm afraid l have
no one by that name
registered, sir.</i>

335
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,310
Okay. Thank you.

336
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,310
Wait! No, no.
Are you there? Hello?

337
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,390
<i>Sir?</i>

338
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,400
Can you check
another name for me,
please?

339
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,690
Here, bear with me
one second.

340
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,860
John Michael Kane.
Kane with a "K."

341
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,280
<i>One moment, sir.</i>

342
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,700
Thank you.

343
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,250
<i>You call about
Monsieur Kane?
John Michael Kane?</i>

344
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,050
Yeah, that's right.

345
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,010
<i>You are a friend of his?</i>

346
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,180
Yeah.

347
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,100
<i>l have some
very bad news
for you, sir.</i>

348
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,640
<i>l'm sorry
to tell you this,</i>

349
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,640
<i>but Monsieur Kane
has passed away
almost two weeks ago.</i>

350
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,770
<i>There was an accident.
On the motorway.</i>

351
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,360
<i>Apparently,
he was killed instantly.</i>

352
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,440
<i>Really, l'm terribly sorry
to be the one
to tell you this.</i>

353
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,820
<i>When they came for his things,
it was made known
for us, you see?</i>

354
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,410
Who came?

355
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,910
<i>His brother.</i>

356
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:28,290
Did his brother leave a number
or a way
to get in touch with him?

357
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,790
<i>l think not.</i>

358
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,630
<i>No, l'm sorry.</i>

359
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,990
Jason?
There's no hot water.

360
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,200
It's freezing.

361
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,820
I'll go try the water
in the kitchen.

362
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:07,120
Why don't you just
stay in the bathroom?
I'll see if I can get it hot.

363
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,000
Yeah, it's really cold
in here, too.

364
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,180
The water is still cold.

365
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,060
Yeah, it's cold
in the kitchen, too.
I got it running, though.

366
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,610
So...

367
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:44,660
What?

368
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,870
Nothing.

369
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,330
Are you okay?

370
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,670
Mmm-hmm.

371
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,880
Yeah.

372
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,560
What is it?

373
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,520
Something wrong?

374
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,760
Jason!

375
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,080
Open that. Open that.
Tell me what's inside.

376
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,580
Who are you?

377
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,670
Who are you?

378
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,880
Who are you?

379
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:06,880
Oh, my God.

380
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,760
God.

381
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,970
Answer me!
Who are you?

382
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,680
He's got my picture!

383
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:15,850
All right.
Just hang on.

384
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,230
This is Zurich.
It's yesterday!

385
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,310
No, no, don't...

386
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,940
I don't know.
Where did you get this?

387
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,270
Hang on.
Stay there.

388
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,610
How did you
get my picture?

389
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:24,730
Where did you
get this from?

390
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,650
How did you get my...
My God!

391
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,570
I'll do this!
You stay there.
Stay there!

392
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,260
Where are your shoes?
Get your shoes.

393
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,180
Sure. Yeah, sure.

394
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,970
He went out the window.
Why would someone do that?

395
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,640
We can't stay here.
It's not safe.

396
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,390
I can get us out of here,
but we got to go.
We got to go right now.

397
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,780
Okay, look,
you can wait.

398
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,320
You can wait for the cops.
It's okay.

399
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,820
You just wait for them
to get here.
But I can't. I got to go.

400
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,910
Marie?

401
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,250
Marie?

402
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,510
Quiet. Be quiet.

403
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,980
Don't look.

404
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,030
<i>Code in.</i>

405
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,490
Alpha 37509.

406
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:01,960
Yeah.

407
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,090
Hang on.

408
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,340
Bourne. He went to Paris.
He went to the apartment.

409
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,050
We got him? Tell me.

410
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,970
<i>He killed our man.</i>

411
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:16,760
<i>What? In the apartment?
Yeah.</i>

412
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,140
<i>Well, you got to
clean that up.</i>

413
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,560
No, I can't clean it up.

414
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,640
<i>There's a body in the street.
So?</i>

415
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,560
There's police.
This is Paris.

416
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:27,690
<i>Put up the scanners.
Get as much radio
information as you can.</i>

417
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:27,730
<i>Put up the scanners.
Get as much radio
information as you can.</i>

418
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,650
Okay, you stay here.

419
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,120
I'm gonna go find a place
for this money.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

420
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,450
Hey, I told you
to stay in the car.

421
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,170
Jesus Christ.
I told you to
stay in the car.

422
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:15,340
I needed a drink.
I didn't think you would
come back anyway.

423
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,260
Look, you got to
go to the cops.

424
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,720
Right now.
You got to go before
this gets any worse.

425
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,600
By myself?
It's gonna be okay.

426
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,600
You're gonna take
my passport, okay?
You show this to them.

427
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,850
You have that picture,
you have the $20,000.

428
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,850
You tell them everything
that happened.
They'll believe you.

429
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,520
They have to believe you.

430
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,700
Marie, you can't
just sit here.
It's not safe here.

431
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,870
Safe? This is from
inside the embassy.

432
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,450
Who can do this?
This is from yesterday.

433
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:43,700
I don't know.

434
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,490
How can they know
we're together?

435
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,750
I'm trying to do
the right thing for you.

436
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,670
That's all I'm trying to do.
Right?

437
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,330
How will you make this right
by sending me there alone?

438
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,920
You think I want you
to go to the cops?
That's good?

439
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,880
You want to go, fine.
If you go, I run!

440
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,050
You go tell them
what happened!

441
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,760
I don't know
what happened!

442
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,180
I don't know
who this guy was
or about that picture!

443
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,140
I don't know who I am!

444
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,020
Look, I'm...

445
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,610
You act like
I'm trying to burn you.

446
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,230
I'm trying
to do the right thing.

447
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,440
Nobody does the right thing.

448
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,500
Look, I can't run with you.
I can't.

449
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,080
We run, I got to
live like this. I got to...

450
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,040
I don't even know
who I'm hiding from.

451
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,090
These people
know who I am.

452
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,590
Yeah, I got to stay here.
I got to figure this out.

453
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,340
So figure it out.

454
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,570
You take care
of this car?

455
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,070
What do you mean?

456
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,950
The tires felt
a little splashy
on the way over here.

457
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,330
It pulls a little
to the right.

458
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,560
Last chance, Marie.

459
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,270
So...

460
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,980
What?
We got a bump coming up.

461
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,480
Turn your head away.
Turn your head away.

462
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,650
We can never come back
to this car.

463
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,900
You understand?

464
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:53,860
Okay, we're gonna
clean it out,

465
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:56,160
and I'll wipe it down,
and we walk away.

466
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,830
That's it.
Okay.

467
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:01,790
Okay. And I'll find a place
for us to rest.
And I got to think.

468
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:04,040
Do you have a hat or
a scarf or something?

469
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,080
For my hair?

470
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:06,540
Yeah. Just until
we can change it.

471
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,710
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

472
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,920
Okay.

473
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,290
It's not him.

474
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:14,900
<i>What do you have?</i>

475
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,280
<i>Wombosi went to the morgue.</i>

476
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,360
<i>He saw the body.
He didn't buy it.</i>

477
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,410
Where is he now?

478
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:25,290
<i>l told you,
l'm not staffed for this.</i>

479
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:27,580
<i>Where is he now?
Right now!
Where's Wombosi?</i>

480
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,960
<i>They were
leaving the morgue.</i>

481
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,580
They just left.

482
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,430
Sir, what do you
want to do?

483
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,880
I need to
get the bottle.

484
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,010
Hey.

485
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,490
You already
cleaned the room?

486
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,530
I wiped the whole place down
for fingerprints.

487
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,500
Can I walk around
or is it gonna leave
any footprints?

488
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,470
You can walk around.
It's no problem.

489
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,510
But we'll just keep track
of everything we touch.

490
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,890
I think it's better
if we leave a room,

491
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:53,390
that we're not gonna
leave a trail.

492
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:54,890
Why? Where are we going?

493
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:57,810
I need to go to
the hotel where
John Michael Kane stayed.

494
01:02:57,890 --> 01:02:59,390
The Hotel Regina.

495
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:04,020
If I was him,
then they're gonna
have some records.

496
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,280
We need that hotel bill.

497
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,490
Okay.

498
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:10,570
It gets slightly
complicated, though.

499
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,070
Because you're dead.

500
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:16,120
Right.

501
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,040
Sir, please.

502
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:24,210
If they want war,
then we'll
give them war.

503
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,710
If they want to kill me,
they better kill me
the first time.

504
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,180
They better kill me dead.
They better kill me
when I'm in my sleep.

505
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,600
Nykwana, listen to me.
We need these people.

506
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,310
It's hard enough
getting people
that we know to help us.

507
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:37,930
We need to be careful.

508
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,100
We?

509
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:40,770
No, you.

510
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,400
You need to bring me back
that bastard kid's head,

511
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,070
put it in the front
of this house,

512
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,230
and show them the war
we're fighting.

513
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,650
But that is precisely...

514
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,410
Nykwana!

515
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,220
We'll give the watch
a reference check
before we go.

516
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:13,130
Okay.

517
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,890
What's the
pay phone number?

518
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,520
616-2468.

519
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,770
Exits?

520
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,270
There's three.

521
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,610
Service at the back,
side goes to the street
past the shops,

522
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,690
front is the best.

523
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:33,860
If I think I'm being followed,
I walk out with the bag
over my right shoulder.

524
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,410
And if there's no taxi?

525
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:39,120
I keep on walking,
don't look back
until you make contact.

526
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:43,290
What?

527
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:49,460
We need this, right?

528
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,470
Okay.

529
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:06,560
<i>l need distances.</i>

530
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:09,400
<i>You walk in, you pick a spot.
Some midpoint in the lobby.</i>

531
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,150
<i>l want you to count your steps
to that spot,
and then remember that number.</i>

532
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,740
<i>Because after l call you,
l can get you moving.</i>

533
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,320
<i>You understand?</i>

534
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,240
<i>l also need a head count.</i>

535
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:22,290
<i>How many people
from when you walk in
until you get to the desk.</i>

536
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:25,210
<i>How many hotel employees
are there?
And obviously security.</i>

537
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:27,500
<i>And it might not be that easy
to see who they are.</i>

538
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:31,090
<i>So l'll call you,
you give me the layout,
and we'll take it from there.</i>

539
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,840
<i>Regina.</i>

540
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:59,320
What happened?
I...

541
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:00,990
Did something
go wrong? What...

542
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,410
I've got the records.

543
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:06,460
He, this guy
at the front desk
was smiling at me.

544
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,540
So I thought, you know,
all this trouble,

545
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,790
maybe it's easier to
just ask for them.

546
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,340
You have the bill?

547
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:13,840
He made me a photocopy.

548
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,880
You just asked for it?

549
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:21,550
I said I was
Mr. Kane's
personal assistant.

550
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,350
Oh.

551
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:28,560
Okay.
That's good thinking.

552
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,860
Sir, can I...
No.

553
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:47,290
Wombosi was assassinated
in his house
in the middle of Paris.

554
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,000
Yeah, we just heard.

555
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:53,750
It's him. It's Bourne.
We're almost positive.

556
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,340
He had an assignment.
He failed.

557
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:59,380
He obviously felt compelled
to finish the task.

558
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:00,510
Jesus.

559
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:02,600
We think he'll come back
in now.

560
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,510
I mean, it's routine.

561
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,430
It's like
behavioral software.

562
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:10,310
He's following a protocol.

563
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:14,690
Now that he's completed
the mission, we think
he'll come back in.

564
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,940
They always do.

565
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:18,860
When?

566
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,490
How long
till he checks in?

567
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,530
Twenty-four hours.
Twenty-four hours?

568
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,290
Yeah, it's usually
something like that.

569
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,500
Then what?

570
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:33,000
I told you
we'd clean this up.

571
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:34,750
It will be clean.

572
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:42,430
Yeah, I understand
you're a dive shop,
but where are you located?

573
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:45,350
Marseilles?

574
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,080
What specifically does
your company supply?

575
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:15,290
<i>l am sorry.
What did you say
your name was, monsieur?</i>

576
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,440
What?

577
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,230
Paris police
found the vehicle.

578
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,290
<i>You've reached the office
of Simon Rawlins</i>

579
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:55,880
<i>at Alliance Security,
Maritime Division.</i>

580
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:59,920
<i>Paris office hours are
from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.</i>

581
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,220
I got a lead in Paris.

582
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:05,260
The rest were Marseilles,
and two out in Southampton.

583
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:06,340
In Paris?
It's what?

584
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:07,970
Alliance Security.
Simon Rawlins.

585
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,220
I got a machine.

586
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,040
Mr. Kane?

587
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,380
Mr. Kane!

588
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,840
How are you?

589
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,380
I'm good. I'm good.
How are you?

590
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,760
Mr. Kane. Come right in.
Please have a seat.

591
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,180
Thank you.

592
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,270
So, this is the
Palmer Johnson tri-deck.

593
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:59,940
I'm assuming you're still
in the market.
It's still the same vessel?

594
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:01,610
Yes.

595
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:01,770
Yes.

596
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,880
So I'm Kane.

597
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:28,890
They...
I just had a meeting as Kane.

598
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:30,720
They said...
No. I'm definitely Kane.

599
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,510
I just had a meeting as Kane
and he knew me as Kane.

600
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,430
So I'm definitely Bourne.
I'm also just
definitely Kane.

601
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,810
It's all just boats.

602
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,230
I got blueprints and cameras
and security systems.

603
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,440
I just found
John Michael Kane's body.

604
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:45,320
In a morgue here
in Paris.

605
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:49,990
But if you are
John Michael Kane,
whose body do they have?

606
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,540
What was the name again?

607
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,630
Kane.

608
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:01,830
Kane.

609
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,250
John Michael Kane.

610
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,000
John Michael Kane.

611
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,800
Kane. It's number 121.

612
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:15,680
I want to see the body.

613
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:19,020
Our boss could come back.
We are not
supposed to do that.

614
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:21,060
Come on.

615
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:39,290
Is this it?
I mean, where is he?

616
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,370
I don't know.

617
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:51,720
Who are you?
What's going on here?

618
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,140
Where's the body
that goes in here?

619
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,640
I said someone
came last night.

620
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,310
I know. Where'd
they take the body?

621
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:58,600
Look, this is not
a carnival, okay?

622
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,480
People call,
they make an appointment,
follow the rules.

623
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,730
Everyone signs in and out.
This is a serious place.
Serious work.

624
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,400
It's not just to come in
whenever you like!

625
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,940
You're right.
We didn't sign in.

626
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,280
Get the hell
out of here.

627
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,740
Fine, fine.
No, I'm just gonna
go sign in.

628
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,110
Okay, go.

629
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,410
Is this it?

630
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:18,790
Slow down.
You can't just
take the book.

631
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:19,950
This is it?

632
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,670
It's okay.
There's a pencil in here.
That's fine.

633
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:25,670
Honey, why don't you go
wait outside? Here it is.

634
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:27,250
We can't have...
Okay.

635
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:32,720
Jason, what just happened
in there?
What are you looking for?

636
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,430
Nykwana Wombosi.

637
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,640
Wombosi went
to the morgue
to visit Kane.

638
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,560
See?

639
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,640
So?

640
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:43,270
So look,
he's in the Alliance
Security brochure.

641
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:44,600
Same guy.

642
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:46,270
This guy knows.

643
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:23,310
My French sucks. I can't...
It says something
about a boat or...

644
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:29,270
I don't understand.
What does it say?
You read it. Tell me. What?

645
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:35,450
It says that 3 weeks
before he was killed,
Mr. Wombosi told police

646
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:39,280
that a man came
onto his yacht, five miles
off the coast of Marseilles

647
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:41,240
and tried to kill him.

648
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,670
It says that he chased the man
off the boat and shot him
twice in the back.

649
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,420
It says I'm an assassin.

650
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,050
What's going on?

651
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:42,640
What the hell
are you doing?

652
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,100
Go. Go.
What are...

653
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,520
We're blown. Come on.

654
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,350
Blown?
What is "blown"?

655
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:57,650
Keep walking.
Keep walking.

656
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:00,820
What do you think
they're doing back there?
They're on to the hotel.

657
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:02,240
No. You don't
know that.

658
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:03,740
Trust me.
Just keep walking.

659
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:28,230
Are you crazy?
What are you doing now?

660
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,060
Jason!

661
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:33,190
This is blown.

662
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:42,700
Marie?
Get away.

663
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:43,950
Marie, stop right there.

664
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:45,030
Get away from me.

665
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,870
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?

666
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:48,250
Marie.
Is that what's next?

667
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:50,460
Listen, stay calm.
Stay calm.

668
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:52,920
Whatever we do,
we have to do it together.

669
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,340
We have to be...
We?

670
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:56,090
The only thing
we had in common

671
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:57,880
was that neither of us
knew who you were.

672
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,840
We've passed that now.
Listen to me!

673
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:03,340
The police will find us.
The people who took
that picture in the embassy

674
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:06,350
who killed Wombosi,
they're gonna come here
and kill us.

675
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:07,930
The people who you work for.

676
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,980
I will take you
wherever you need to go.

677
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,110
I'll take you there.
I'll leave you there.

678
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:16,440
You can do whatever you want.
You never have to
see me again.

679
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:19,440
But not here.
If we stay here,
we die.

680
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:30,660
Boy, great police work!
Really brilliant!

681
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,500
Why don't they just hang out
a banner that says,
"Don't come back!"

682
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,510
Jesus Christ!
What is the French word
for "stakeout"?

683
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:49,520
Okay, this was 16 minutes ago.

684
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:52,520
This is our starting point.

685
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,100
They can't fly.
Trains are risky.
Nicky?

686
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:56,150
<i>Here.</i>

687
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:59,730
I need to know everything
Paris's finest
is doing on this.

688
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:00,940
<i>l'm on it.</i>

689
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,990
<i>You said 24 hours,
and he's not back.</i>

690
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:09,370
No. But we got a good idea
where he is.

691
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:12,620
<i>You've got a black ops agent
who's off the reservation.</i>

692
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:14,370
<i>He's trashed
an American consulate.</i>

693
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,830
<i>He's on the run
somewhere in Europe.</i>

694
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,840
You don't know why.
I got to stand before
an oversight committee.

695
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:20,960
What will I tell them
about Treadstone?

696
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:23,300
You're worried about
a budget meeting?

697
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:26,510
We don't take care of this,
we don't make it
to the men's room.

698
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,640
Now, is that clear enough
for you?

699
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:31,770
We will burn for this.

700
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,480
We will both of us burn.

701
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:39,820
All right, I want two teams.
Daryl, Ray, stay on the grids.

702
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,320
Brian, Harris, Steve,

703
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:44,320
I want to work on this girl.

704
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,240
Where about this
residency pattern?

705
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,410
We started it.

706
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:48,700
Get it out.

707
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,960
<i>We cross-referenced
numbers from the grandmother,
stepbrother.</i>

708
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,710
When we found convergence,
we took the numbers,

709
01:17:57,790 --> 01:17:58,710
back-checked them,

710
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:02,340
ran a search merge
with other data we had,
which wasn't much.

711
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:03,840
Pins. These pins.

712
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,180
These are all the places
we think she's lived
in the last six years.

713
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:10,680
<i>One, two, three, four, five.</i>

714
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:12,560
<i>That's our pool.</i>

715
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,360
No answer.

716
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:21,940
How many times
you let it ring?

717
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,490
Look, if you don't
want to go, I'll hitch.

718
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:26,110
I said I'd take you.

719
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,910
Those are the targets.

720
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:34,950
Beg, borrow, hack,
tap, bypass!
I don't care what you do!

721
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:40,130
I want to know everything
you can tell me about what's
going on at those locations.

722
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:00,310
How do you know
he still owns this?

723
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:05,150
Eamon always had money.
He would never sell this.

724
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,180
Marie?

725
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:37,390
What?

726
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:40,640
We got to go.

727
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,520
What?

728
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:44,230
We got to go.

729
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:49,030
I thought it would...

730
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,790
Oh, shit, that's Eamon.
I'll talk to him.

731
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:57,870
We're leaving.

732
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:03,830
Eamon. Surprise.

733
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:07,460
It's me, Marie.
Wow, God,

734
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:10,470
there's a really
good reason for this.

735
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:12,130
There bloody well
better be.

736
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,300
Daddy!

737
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:14,850
Hang on. Hang on.

738
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:19,560
I had no idea
you would be here.

739
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:23,190
Well, why would I be here?
It's only my
bloody house, right?

740
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,110
Yeah.

741
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:27,900
Did she get you
into this?

742
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:31,490
It was just gonna
be for a day.

743
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:34,160
Daddy, Alain has to go pee!

744
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:38,080
All right, all right,
come on. Here.
Get out of the car.

745
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:41,000
Okay, in you go.

746
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,620
Come on, Alain.

747
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:45,330
I'm sorry. I...

748
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:48,090
I thought it would be okay.
But I guess I was wrong.

749
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:50,010
Let's find Mommy.
Mommy?

750
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:51,590
Mommy is away for two days,
thank God.

751
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,310
You've got yourself
all tied up here.

752
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:00,430
Okay.

753
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:06,270
What's he do
for a living?

754
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:09,530
He used to be
in shipping.

755
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,990
Is he good for you?

756
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,660
Are you happy?

757
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,330
You know me.
I try too hard.

758
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:24,080
Here you go.

759
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,130
Sleep well.

760
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:27,670
Good night.

761
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,510
I'll sleep on the floor.

762
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,640
This was when?
11:45 a.m.

763
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:42,890
Which is definitely within
the driving range of Paris.

764
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:46,690
The call came from
a highway rest stop,
southbound side.

765
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,230
Yeah.
What's this yellow pin?

766
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,610
She spent
a couple of months
there in 1997.

767
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:52,480
Closest town is Riom.

768
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,950
We took her family's
phone records and collated
the international calls.

769
01:21:58,030 --> 01:21:59,910
They were in Paris
at 2:00 a.m.

770
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:02,830
They can't fly.
The train's too dangerous.

771
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:05,620
He knows better
than to go anywhere
we might track him.

772
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,500
So this is our best guess.

773
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,270
What are you
doing here?

774
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,310
The kids.
I was worried.
I couldn't sleep.

775
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,610
You're gonna wake them up.
We got to go.

776
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:14,780
I don't want to know
who I am anymore.

777
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:17,400
I don't care.
I don't want to know.

778
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,160
Come on.
We'll talk about...

779
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,080
Everything I found out
I want to forget.

780
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:25,490
It's okay.

781
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,790
I don't care who I am
or what I did.

782
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:30,620
It's okay.

783
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:32,080
We have this money.

784
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:34,420
We can hide.

785
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,130
Can we do that?
Is there any chance
you can do that?

786
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:49,310
I don't know.

787
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:56,110
Come on.

788
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:08,910
Here, boy!
Here, boy!

789
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:10,620
Morning.

790
01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:12,960
Christ.
You were up early.

791
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:15,290
Bless you
for making coffee.

792
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:25,720
One night.
You weren't kidding.

793
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,220
For a change.

794
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:30,770
He's not there either.

795
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,690
And you looked
by the car?

796
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:34,350
He's not anywhere.

797
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,230
All right,
let me get dressed.

798
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,400
Who?

799
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:39,820
Bloody dog's
gone missing.

800
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,530
Does that happen a lot?

801
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:44,070
What? That mutt?
Miss his breakfast?
Not a chance.

802
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,990
It's always
something, right?

803
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:50,120
Get in the basement.

804
01:24:50,330 --> 01:24:51,410
What?

805
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Get everyone
in the basement now.

806
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,420
What the hell
are you talking about?

807
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:58,960
You're in danger.
Your family's in danger.
I don't have time to explain.

808
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:00,960
Wait a minute. What the...
Eamon.

809
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:02,420
You should go.

810
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:03,630
What the hell
have you done?

811
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:05,180
It's not her.
It's me.

812
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:08,680
You need to get out of sight
and in the basement
as quick as you can.

813
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,430
Daddy.

814
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,940
I'm sorry.

815
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:18,360
Let's go.

816
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,880
The phone is dead.
Yeah.

817
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:42,920
Jason, who's out there?
Who is it?

818
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,860
What are you doing?

819
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:03,940
Oh, no.

820
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:11,240
We should never
have come here.
I... These children...

821
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,740
That's not gonna happen.

822
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:43,060
Where is it?
Where's the weapon?

823
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:50,150
Who else is out here?
Who else?
How many you got with you?

824
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,820
I'm not gonna ask you again.

825
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,570
I work alone. Like you.

826
01:28:57,330 --> 01:28:59,120
We always work alone.

827
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,870
What do you mean?
Who are you? Rome?

828
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,290
Paris?

829
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:07,290
Treadstone, both of us.

830
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,170
Treadstone?
Which one?

831
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:10,840
Paris. I live in Paris.

832
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,590
You get the headaches?

833
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:14,590
Yeah.

834
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,680
I get such bad headaches.

835
01:29:16,930 --> 01:29:19,350
You know at night
when you're driving a car?

836
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:21,060
Maybe it's to do
with the headlights.

837
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:22,890
What is Treadstone?

838
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,020
Treadstone said pills.

839
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:29,730
They said go to Paris.

840
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:32,320
Is Treadstone in Paris?

841
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,740
Look at this.

842
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,120
Look at what
they make you give.

843
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:06,810
All right, all right.

844
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,900
All right, Claudia,
get in the front
and put your belt on.

845
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:12,190
All right,
we're just gonna put you
in the back.

846
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:14,360
All right, get in
the front, Claudia.

847
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:21,660
I'm not waiting, Marie.

848
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:23,750
One minute, Eamon.
I'm not waiting!

849
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:25,500
Please!

850
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:27,920
Take it.

851
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,420
I took out $30,000.
The rest is yours.

852
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:33,340
That's it?
That's all I got.

853
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,760
No, that's not what I meant.

854
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:42,350
This is not gonna stop, Marie.
You got to get out now.
Away from me.

855
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:46,310
You got to get out.
You got to start running.

856
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,350
You get low,
you stay low.

857
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,310
No more friends.
Nothing familiar.

858
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:56,780
There's enough in there
for you to make a life.
Any life.

859
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:58,240
I'm out of here, Marie!

860
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,360
Hey!

861
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:04,290
Get in the car.
You got to go.

862
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,750
What are you gonna do?

863
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:13,840
I'll end it.

864
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:15,550
Go ahead.

865
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:18,680
Please.

866
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:38,710
Code in, please.

867
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,050
Code in.

868
01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:46,680
<i>Code in.</i>

869
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:52,310
<i>Who is this?</i>

870
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:59,820
Who the hell are you?

871
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:05,320
<i>The man you sent is dead.</i>

872
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:07,780
<i>So whoever this is,
you better start talking.</i>

873
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:10,790
<i>Hello, Jason.</i>

874
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:13,920
<i>So, what are we into now?</i>

875
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:23,050
It only goes two ways.
Either you come in
and let us make this right,

876
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,340
or we'll have to keep going
until we're satisfied.

877
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:27,180
You mean
until you kill me.

878
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:31,730
I can't fix this
if I don't know
what the problem is.

879
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:34,350
Tell me what we're into,
and I'll do the best I can.

880
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,860
Why don't you talk to
Marie, Jason?

881
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:48,580
Let's ask Marie
what she wants to do.

882
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:50,620
<i>Actually, l don't think
she gives a shit.</i>

883
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,450
She's dead.

884
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,800
I'm sorry to hear that.
How did that happen?

885
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,470
<i>She was slowing me down.</i>

886
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,470
Jason, all we've been
doing right from...

887
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:09,640
<i>Enough.</i>

888
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:10,720
Enough.

889
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:14,390
5:30 p.m. Paris.

890
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,190
Today. Pont Neuf.

891
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,980
Come alone,
you walk to the middle
of that bridge.

892
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:21,070
<i>You take off your jacket.
Face east.</i>

893
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:23,070
<i>l'll redial this number.
Jason, wait!</i>

894
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:38,080
First flight out. Tell Nicky
I'll call from the car.
Tell her to find Picot. Go.

895
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:41,920
So...

896
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:44,340
What are we gonna do?

897
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:46,680
I told you I'd clean this up.
That's what I'm doing.

898
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:48,430
Can you really bring him in?

899
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,430
I think we're past that,
don't you?

900
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:53,600
Do you have a better idea?

901
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:56,390
You've given me nothing
but a trail of
collateral damage

902
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,850
from Zurich to Paris.
I couldn't do much worse.

903
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:01,690
Why don't you go upstairs
and book a conference room?

904
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:04,110
Maybe you can talk him
to death.

905
01:36:21,310 --> 01:36:24,190
<i>The bus,
the tour bus,
second level.</i>

906
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,440
<i>Negative on the target.</i>

907
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:32,610
<i>Position one?
Negative.</i>

908
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:34,870
<i>Position two?
Negative.</i>

909
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:52,760
<i>Position three,
motorcycle.</i>

910
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:54,640
<i>Negative.</i>

911
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:55,890
<i>Negative.</i>

912
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:21,290
Jason?

913
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:25,120
I told you to come alone.
I guess that
was too complicated.

914
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:27,000
So try this. I'm gone.

915
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:32,260
Fuck.

916
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:41,100
<i>Get Nicky on the phone.</i>

917
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:58,200
<i>Yeah?</i>

918
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,660
<i>How long does it take
to wipe the room
down and move it?</i>

919
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:02,660
<i>Get rid of everything?
Yeah.</i>

920
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:04,500
<i>Two to three hours.</i>

921
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:06,120
<i>All right,
well, get started.</i>

922
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:14,470
Listen, no breaks.

923
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:17,390
Two men outside,
one in the lobby.
And keep your eyes open.

924
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:22,060
<i>Keep the truck?
Yeah, keep the truck.</i>

925
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:25,520
I'm gonna close
this unit down. We'll move
the gear in the truck.

926
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,750
They were covering Spain,
Malta, Morocco.

927
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:48,330
Yes, all local police
radio traffic.

928
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:52,000
No, for northern Europe
we need
an authorized directive. Yeah.

929
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:56,260
Okay, they're on it.
We'll have a satellite
download in 30 minutes.

930
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:07,750
Where's your field box?

931
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:13,670
Where's your field box?

932
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,380
It's right there.

933
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:18,130
The whole system's
gone haywire.

934
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:21,300
That's this window
right here.

935
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,550
Dining room window?

936
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:26,600
I don't get it.

937
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:30,940
Dead.
The phones are dead.

938
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:33,900
It's Bourne,
isn't it?

939
01:40:35,110 --> 01:40:36,440
Just quiet.

940
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:25,780
You move, you die.

941
01:41:26,490 --> 01:41:27,580
Bourne.

942
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:28,910
Gun down.

943
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:36,170
In there.

944
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:39,800
Okay, so what
do you want...

945
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,260
Treadstone.

946
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:44,260
You better take
a look around.
There's not much left.

947
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:45,430
Are you Treadstone?

948
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:46,890
Am I Treadstone? Me?

949
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:48,970
What the hell are
you talking about?

950
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:50,520
He's lost it.

951
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:52,600
You better start
filling in the blanks here!

952
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:54,980
'Cause I thought
we were on the same side.

953
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:56,270
Whose side is that?

954
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:00,190
You don't know what
you're doing, do you?
You don't have a goddamn clue!

955
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:01,820
Who am I?

956
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:04,150
You're U.S.
government property!

957
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:07,410
You're a malfunctioning
$30 million weapon!

958
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:09,530
You're a total
goddamn catastrophe!

959
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:12,620
And, by God, if it kills me,
you will tell me
how this happened.

960
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:13,830
Why are you trying
to kill me?

961
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:15,670
What happened
in Marseilles?

962
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:18,630
You sent me
to kill Wombosi.

963
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:21,960
Kill Wombosi?
Yeah, we can do that
any time we want.

964
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:24,420
I can send Nicky to do that,
for Christ's sake.

965
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:27,300
Mr. Wombosi
was supposed to be dead
three weeks ago.

966
01:42:27,390 --> 01:42:31,510
He was supposed to have died
in a way where the
only possible explanation was

967
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,680
that he'd been murdered
by a member of
his own entourage.

968
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:36,560
I don't send you to kill.

969
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:38,270
I send you to be invisible.

970
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:40,610
I send you because
you don't exist.

971
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:42,940
I want to know
what happened
in Marseilles.

972
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:45,860
I don't remember
what happened in Marseilles.

973
01:42:45,950 --> 01:42:48,660
Bullshit! This is
unacceptable, soldier.

974
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:50,410
You hear me? You failed!

975
01:42:50,490 --> 01:42:52,120
Unacceptable?
You failed!

976
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,490
You failed and
you're gonna tell me why!

977
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:56,040
I can't tell you!
I don't remember!

978
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:59,170
You brought Kane to life.
You put together
a meeting with Wombosi.

979
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:01,670
You found the
security company.
You broke into the office!

980
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:05,920
For Christ's sake,
you picked the yacht
as the goddamn strike point!

981
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:15,020
<i>You picked the boat.</i>

982
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,940
<i>You picked the day.
You tracked the crew.</i>

983
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:19,520
<i>The food, the fuel!</i>

984
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:22,400
<i>You told us where.
You told us when.</i>

985
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:25,480
<i>You hid out on that boat
five days.</i>

986
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:27,820
<i>You were in, Jason.
You were in!</i>

987
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,360
<i>lt was over!</i>

988
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:32,180
No, you do remember.

989
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:36,560
Don't you?

990
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:44,810
I don't want to
do this anymore.

991
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:48,570
I don't think
that's a decision
you can make.

992
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:56,410
Jason Bourne is dead.
Do you hear me?

993
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:58,410
He drowned two weeks ago.

994
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:01,500
You're gonna go tell them
that Bourne is dead.
Understand?

995
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:03,080
Where are you gonna go?

996
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:06,130
I swear,
if I even feel somebody
behind me,

997
01:45:06,210 --> 01:45:08,000
there is no measure
to how fast

998
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:11,130
and how hard
I will bring this fight
to your doorstep.

999
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:13,090
I'm on my own side now.

1000
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:48,810
It's done.

1001
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:51,020
Shut it down.

1002
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:32,390
<i>The Treadstone project
has actually
already been terminated.</i>

1003
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:35,650
<i>lt was designed primarily
as a sort of
advanced game program.</i>

1004
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:38,440
<i>We'd hoped it might build
into a good training platform.</i>

1005
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:42,070
<i>But quite honestly,
for a strictly
theoretical exercise,</i>

1006
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:44,450
<i>the cost-benefit ratio
was just too high.</i>

1007
01:49:44,530 --> 01:49:46,620
<i>lt's all but decommissioned
at this point.</i>

1008
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:48,280
All right,
what's next?

1009
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:50,660
<i>Okay, this is</i>

1010
01:49:52,290 --> 01:49:53,500
<i>Blackbriar.</i>

1011
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:56,750
<i>Blackbriar is a joint DOD
communications program</i>

1012
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:58,790
<i>that we really feel
has good traction to it.</i>

1013
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,880
<i>lt's got legs.
lt'll run and run.</i>

1014
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:05,340
<i>lt combines elements
of proactive and
reactive fields of security...</i>

1015
01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:50,550
This your store?

1016
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:51,760
Yeah.

1017
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:57,270
It's nice. It's a little hard
to find, but...

1018
01:51:01,730 --> 01:51:03,530
Think I could
rent a scooter?

1019
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:09,070
You have ID?

1020
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:11,990
Not really.
