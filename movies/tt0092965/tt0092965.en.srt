AMAH: Jamie!

5
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,200
Jamie, off the grass!

6
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,620
Off the grass!

7
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,020
Nice plane finish!

8
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,220
- Which side will win the war?
- Ours, of course.

9
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,020
- Oh, that war.
- Well, China isn't our war.

10
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,770
We're awfully lucky.

11
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,950
- Living here, having everything.
- Naughty!

12
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,900
The harder I work, the luckier we get.

13
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,960
I only meant lucky.

14
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,400
Luckier than him.

15
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,870
We're luckier than most.
He's luckier than some.

16
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,170
Out of the way.
Chip across the water.

17
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,970
The Japanese will win. They've got
better planes and braver pilots.

18
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,590
I may join the Japanese Air Force.

19
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,170
For heaven's sake!

20
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,970
Father, look! Zero Sen!
It's my plane! Zero Sen!

21
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,050
Amah, I'll have...

22
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,820
the butter biscuits.

23
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,110
Mrs. Graham, she...

24
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,830
not want you eat before bed.

25
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,990
You have to do what I say.

26
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,690
MAN:... backed by
<i>reinforcements into Malaya...{\i}</i>

27
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,190
<i>certain to influence Japan against{\i}
further military action.{\i}.</i>

28
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,000
<i>As Far East tensions grow, {\i}
British nationals evacuate...{\i}</i>

29
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,070
<i>for Australia and lndia.{\i}.</i>

30
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,960
<i>A steamer left Shanghai yesterday{\i}
with 450 British on board...{\i}</i>

31
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,250
<i>to Hong Kong.{\i}.</i>

32
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,880
<i>A third of occupied China's{\i}

34
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,930

36

37
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,570

38
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,040
Hello...

39
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,820
Ace.

40
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,040
- I was dreaming about God.
- What did he say?

41
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,270
Nothing. He was playing tennis.

42
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,070
Perhaps that's where God is
all the time.

43
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,850
It's why you can't see him.

44
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,850
I don't know about God.

45
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,860
- Good night, Jamie.
- Perhaps he's our dream...

46
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,380
and we're his.

47
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,660
Go to sleep. It's the Lockwoods'
party tomorrow.

48
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,270
Can I take my glider?

49
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,860
Dream of flying.

50
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,450
Mother...

51
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,650
if God is above us, does it mean
up, like flying?

52
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,900
Good night.

53
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,290
- Mistress, very beautiful.
- Thank you, Amah. Off we go.

54
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,590
Behave yourself.

55
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,510
Thank you, Yang.

56
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,600
Squeeze up.

57
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,350
Mind the plane. Prop it against
the seat. Right, Yang.

58
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,710
Settle down, Sinbad!

59
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,980
Take the Wang Pu Road.
Let's avoid the crowds.

60
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,450
- See you back on board.
MAN 1: See you, Charlie.

61
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,700
Green apples! Green apples!

62
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,090
No mama. No papa.
No whiskey soda.

63
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,780
Slow down. Checkpoint coming up.

64
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,660
<i>God rest ye merry gentlemen{\i}.</i>

65
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,120
Hello, darling.
Lovely to see you.

66
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,540
- Big kisses.
- There he is.

67
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,000
- Leave Shanghai while you can.
- They leave us alone.

68
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,100
Lockwood's invited a Chink.

69
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,800
Sorry, but don't mind him.

70
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,930
- English humor?
- Scottish whiskey.

71
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,680
Are our days numbered?

72
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,020
All our days are numbered.
Ours higher than yours.

73
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,310
You've been in Shanghai 100 years.
It's only an incident.

74
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,020
The Japanese, four years. Nothing.

75
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,570
Long enough to spoil your harvest
and steal what's left of it.

76
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,830
A million Chinese peasants are
trying to enter Shanghai.

77
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,410
The Japanese get hungry too.

78
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,540
We have the guns, the planes
and 500 million fighting back.

79
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,340
- We'll be here after every war.
- Here's to that.

80
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,550
I hope we'll be here too.

81
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,630
Always delighted to return
hospitality.

82
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,430
- Very good. Utterly convincing.
- Thank you.

83
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,580
Zero?

84
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,490
Nakajima. Two machine guns.

85
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,410
I rely on you for keeping up-to-date
on the war.

86
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,040
Especially military aviation.

87
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,840
- I hear you resigned from the Scouts.
- I'm now an atheist.

88
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,240
- Where are you going?
- To see something!

89
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,440
Oh.

90
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,900
Your boy tells me he's an atheist.

91
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,990
Always thought he was.

92
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,290
- Chow time.
- Thank you.

93
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,820
JIM: Enemy aircraft sighted!

94
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,810
He's on my tail! On my tail!

95
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,860
Jamie!

96
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,570
Jamie!

97
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,110
Stand still, John.

98
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,200
Jamie.

99
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,630
Don't run.

100
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,930
FATHER: Come, you're
missing the party.

101
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,640
- I left my plane.
- Never mind.

102
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,730
- Don't look back.
- Thanks.

103
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,730
They're waiting for something
to happen.

104
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,020
- They didn't look angry.
- It's not anger. It's patience.

105
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,610
- Is it time to close ranks?
- Get Mary and the boy out.

106
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,270
Somewhere safe. Singapore?

107
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,030
We're moving into the hotel.

108
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,160
MOTHER: Why?
- To see how things are going.

109
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,240
I don't want you two alone
in the house.

110
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,410
Jamie?

111
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,680
I didn't mean it. It was a joke.

112
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,450
Keep away from the window.

113
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,260
Get dressed. Do what Mother
tells you. We're leaving.

114
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,850
I am dressed.

115
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,340
JIM: Am I going to school?
MOTHER: There's no school today.

116
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,250
We'll see if Yang can take us home.

117
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,180
Never mind the suitcase. Come on!

118
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,920
- Taxi! Over here! Taxi!
WOMAN 1: Excuse me!

119
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,880
Good heavens, this is ridiculous!

120
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,170
- Keep holding my hand!
MOTHER: Stop shoving me!

121
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,250
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Yang!

122
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,790
Quickly!

123
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,690
Yang, get us to the waterfront.

124
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,410
Jamie, for God's sake, sit down!

125
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,970
Jamie, get out of the car. Quickly!

126
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,690
- What will we do?
- Get out.

127
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,190
Perhaps there'll be a boat.
Sorry. Max was right.

128
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,570
Don't push me!

129
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,780
Mary!

130
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,700
Hold on to him!

131
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,430
John!

132
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,740
John!

133
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,920
- FATHER: Hold on.
- John!

134
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,720
Stay together! Hang on to Jamie!

135
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,150
Jamie, don't let go!

136
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,270
JIM: My plane!

137
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,250
Jamie!

138
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,670
Mum?

139
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,510
Mum! Mummy!

140
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,970
Jamie!

141
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:00,770
Mummy! Mum! No!

142
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,350
Jamie! Jamie!

143
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:08,150
Go home. I'll find you there! Go home!

144
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,670
Mummy!

145
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,530
Mother!

146
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,090
Mama?

147
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,360
Father!

148
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,880
Mother!

149
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,710
What do you think you're doing?

150
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,190
Where's my mother and father?

151
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,860
Come on, man! Come on, kid!

152
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,290
Come on!

153
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,210
Wait! Wait!

154
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,970
Come on!

155
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,010
Come on, cycle harder!

156
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,460
Wait!

157
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,710
Please!

158
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,060
Excuse me, everyone.

159
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,740
I surrender.

160
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,650
"I surrender.
I surrender. I surrender."

161
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:22,480
No mama! No papa! No whiskey soda!

162
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,430
American boy?

163
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,640
- American boy?
- English.

164
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,860
English?

165
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,580
I'm waiting for my chauffeur.

166
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,450
English boy.

167
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,120
English boy, you come now.

168
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,760
Thank you.

169
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,220
You come now.

170
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,380
- You come now.
- No! No!

171
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,970
Hey!

172
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,400
English boy!

173
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,010
Hey! Hey, English boy!

174
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,970
I surrender! I surrender. Please!

175
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,370
Please, sir!

176
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,010
I surrender!

177
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,970
Excuse me, sir.
My name is James Graham. I'm British.

178
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,790
I'd like to surrender, please!

179
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,370
Please!

180
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,220
Please, I'm British.

181
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,880
I'd like to surrender.
Please, sir.

182
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,180
Please!

183
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,800
English boy!

184
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,820
I surrender!

185
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,620
Please!

186
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:54,150
Help me!

187
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,810
Help me! I'm British!

188
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,100
Help me!

189
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,830
Help me! BOY: Stop running.

190
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,580
JIM: Please! No! Please!

191
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,630
Help me! Help me!

192
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,910
Hello.

193
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,210
Kid. Kid, you okay?

194
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,450
Kid, you all right?

195
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,650
I think so.

196
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,470
Where do you live?

197
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,600
13 Amherst Avenue.

198
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,190
I'm waiting for my parents.
They've been delayed.

199
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,710
Delayed?
Some kind of crazy British kid.

200
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,200
What's your name?

201
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,560
James Graham.
I'm writing a book on contract bridge.

202
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:40,240
Are you with the American fleet?

203
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,770
American fleet? It looks like
you almost lost your shirt.

204
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,750
Maybe I can help you find
your parents.

205
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,090
I know just the man.

206
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:56,340
Do you know General Winter?

207
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,430
My father knows important people.
Do you know my father?

208
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:03,730
He owns a textile mill
on Szechwan Road.

209
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,940
Mr. Lockwood? He's with
the British Association.

210
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,650
Perhaps you don't know anyone.

211
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:13,990
How about Louis Charles and Michael
of the Avenue Foch gang?

212
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,740
Know about psychic bidding?
It's in my book.

213
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,200
Let's say you need three diamonds.

214
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,200
You just think three diamonds.

215
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,750
Then your partner,
when he gets four aces...

216
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,790
he shouts and you put down the...

217
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:30,750
You put down your aces and then...

218
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,870
I can't remember it now.

219
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,260
Probably my parents are on a ship
to Hong Kong.

220
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,260
Then they'll send for me.

221
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,350
My father will give you a reward.

222
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:45,480
He gave a taxi driver $5
for bringing me home from Hankow.

223
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,140
Ever been to England?

224
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:50,000
FRANK: Kid, you're starting to get
on my nerves.

225
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,750
Look what I found under my truck.
I'm sorry already.

226
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,300
Come on in, boy.

227
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,920
He's either hungry or crazy.

228
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:19,780
You need to lie down?

229
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:22,970
My father has a cotton mill at...

230
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,640
Pootung.

231
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,480
- He'll be ingratiated to you.
BASIE: Ingratiated is a fine word.

232
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,310
He once gave a taxi...

233
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,090
BASIE: Ln a minute.
Your tongue's running away.

234
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,710
That's a well-kept set of teeth.

235
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,750
Someone has paid a lot of bills
for that sweet mouth.

236
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:51,040
Frank, you'd be surprised how
people neglect their kids' teeth.

237
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,090
Basie, I got you three.

238
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,300
I wasn't able to sell
any goddamn portholes.

239
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,510
Those Hankow merchants...

240
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:01,850
they're charging $10
for a bag of rice.

241
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,540
Cathedral School too.

242
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,240
Cathedral?

243
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,270
Is he a kind of priest?

244
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:15,390
The Cathedral School.

245
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,460
It's a school for taipans.

246
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,870
You must know some
important people, son.

247
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,840
What do they call you?

248
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,030
I once met Madame Sun Yat-Sen.

249
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,800
She didn't call me anything.
I was 3.

250
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,630
Madame Sun?

251
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,160
I was presented.

252
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,260
- Presented.
- You two keep getting presented.

253
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,730
We'll be up to our asses in junk,
eating rats when the Japs walk in.

254
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,140
The Japs are not looking for us.

255
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,730
Nantao Creek is full of cholera.
They've got more sense.

256
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:59,280
FRANK: It's a changed world.
Even if I sell this stuff...

257
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,530
there wouldn't be enough to get
a sampan upriver.

258
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:07,330
We'd have to strip the Queen Mary!
So we don't have any rice for you.

259
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:11,510
Let's leave the boy alone.

260
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,360
All these new words and now this.
Fancy candy?

261
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,190
- What did you say your name was?
- Jamie.

262
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,650
I'm building a man-flying kite...

263
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,530
and writing a book
on contract bridge.

264
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,260
Jim. A new name for a new life.

265
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:55,210
BASIE: Jim's parents got
taken with the other Brits...

266
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:58,110
and now Jim's looking for them.

267
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:41,220
Don't worry about Frank, he always
eats after me. Don't you, Frank?

268
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:44,420
I always eat after you, Basie.

269
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,220
Because I think for us both.

270
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,340
Jim, chew your food.

271
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:53,920
Chew every mouthful six times
to get the benefit.

272
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:14,280
Frank, we might do all right
in one of those camps.

273
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:19,080
Doesn't look like we'll
leave Shanghai soon.

274
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:29,680
You're a tired boy, Jim.

275
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,670
Where am I gonna sleep?

276
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,200
Shanghai Jim.

277
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,320
Find any gold teeth?

278
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:51,290
Buying and selling, Frank. You know.

279
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:53,880
Life.

280
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,780
Okay, sit. Sit.

281
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:24,680
Make a muscle.

282
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,880
JIM: Why can't he sell me?
FRANK: Nobody wants you.

283
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,170
You're worth nothing.
Skin and bone.

284
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:49,320
Pretty soon, you'll be sick
all the time.

285
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:24,330
Basie...

286
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,000
First, I could show you
some rich pickings.

287
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,620
Hundreds of houses left empty.

288
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,950
Is that right?

289
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,900
I'll show you the houses
I lived in before Frank found me.

290
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,530
They were luxuriant!

291
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,270
Luxuriant?

292
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,860
You had good sense being born there.
It was good living.

293
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,910
There certainly was good living!

294
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,330
There was opulence!

295
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,860
Opulence.

296
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,660
All right.

297
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:11,680
We'll go look at these houses.

298
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,520
Let's go, Frank.

299
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,950
Opulence.

300
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:53,730
That one has whiskey, gin
and a white piano.

301
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,470
That one has whiskey, gin...

302
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:01,400
- Whiskey and a radiogram.
- What about the boarded one?

303
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,680
It has a mirrored dance floor,
radiogram, fountain...

304
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:09,730
- ...and crystal chandeliers.
- Crystal chandeliers?

305
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,520
- I think they were crystal.
- You're tired.

306
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,750
What about cash?

307
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:18,070
BASIE: What about money?
JIM: I did see money.

308
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:22,300
Piles of notes on the table.
I'm taking you there.

309
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:23,700
Turn right here.

310
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,770
I knew she'd come back.

311
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,820
Take it easy.

312
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:04,040
Mother!

313
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,100
- Damn it, they're Japs.
- I see. Back out.

314
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,930
I can't back out! There's no reverse!

315
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:30,900
- Just go forward.
- Come on!

316
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,870
Jesus Christ, Frank.

317
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:57,500
I want these back when they're done.

318
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,840
Basie...

319
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,490
Basie.

320
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,620
Engine number two on fire.
On fire, come in.

321
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,920
Come in, Red Dog Leader.
Red Dog Leader, come in.

322
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,170
Adjusting propeller? Red Dog Leader.

323
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:41,670
Engine two on fire.
On fire, on fire, on fire...

324
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:46,470
<i>Good King Wenceslas looked out{\i}
On the feast of Stephen{\i}.</i>

325
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:51,350
<i>When the snow lay round about{\i}
Deep and crisp and even{\i}.</i>

326
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:55,730
It's just a little fever.
Don't worry. We've all had it.

327
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,850
Do you feel better now?

328
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:00,910
It's perfectly all right.
I can wash it.

329
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,060
Excuse me.

330
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,840
There's been a mistake.

331
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:18,780
It may have been my fault.
I'm terribly sorry.

332
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:41,130
MAN: Attention, prisoners!
<i>For camp transport, assemble outside.{\i}.</i>

333
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:45,380
<i>Outside. Make one line.{\i}
Number one prisoner group to gate.{\i}.</i>

334
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,380
<i>Prisoners, number one truck.{\i}.</i>

335
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:14,030
Have you forgotten the cutlery?

336
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,050
No, I haven't.

337
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,010
Basie.

338
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,520
Basie.

339
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,840
No.

340
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:35,230
You can't drink water from here.
People are dying of dysentery.

341
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,290
But we can drink boiled water.

342
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:40,770
Boiled water?

343
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,260
Many thanks, Basie.

344
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,310
You're welcome, Jim.

345
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,610
You've got nice manners.
I appreciate that.

346
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,720
Now it's chow time. Get in line.

347
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,990
Keep the ball in play,
first in line.

348
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:58,450
I think your father would agree.

349
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:00,540
Actually, he would agree.

350
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,880
After the war, you two
should play tennis.

351
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:10,970
I want you to get Mrs. Partridge's
potato while you're there.

352
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:14,050
I think she died, Basie.

353
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:18,090
She died, but didn't hand
in her dinner pail.

354
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:22,000
Okay, go. Go on. Hurry.

355
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:30,040
And, Ace, don't forget to bow
to the sergeant.

356
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,070
We gotta get out of here.

357
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:43,790
MAN 1: The camps are full. It's our
bad luck to be taken here.

358
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,660
MAN 2: The Japs haven't enough camps
for us all.

359
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:07,390
This is disgusting. Get some water.

360
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,210
Come on, children.

361
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,750
She's with God now.

362
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,200
What are you doing, Basie?

363
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,710
Looks like your size, Jim.

364
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,370
I don't want her shoes.

365
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,330
I don't want them.

366
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,600
- I don't want them.
- Somebody will.

367
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,730
Basie, leave her!

368
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:30,980
Fine! I don't want her shoes!

369
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:33,820
Stop it. Leave her. Leave her!

370
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:37,310
Stop it. I don't want her shoes!

371
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,940
Pipe down.

372
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,500
It's the lorry. The lorry!

373
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,920
The lorry!

374
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,800
Come on!

375
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:53,290
- JIM: Come on.
- No!

376
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:58,070
Come on! Don't you see?
This place is to see who dies!

377
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:03,890
Healthy ones go. Sick stay.

378
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:06,850
Tell him who we are, then...

379
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:11,380
We don't say anything.
Just look him in the eye.

380
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,640
- SOLDIER: Name?
- George Flynn.

381
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,880
SOLDIER: Name? MAN 1: Summers.

382
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,030
Excuse me.

383
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:42,970
- I'm a doctor. Let me through.
WOMAN: That's not fair!

384
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,030
I'm a British citizen!

385
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,240
You can't do this!

386
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:06,430
No! I'm with them!

387
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,860
- Please!
- Please!

388
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:28,510
Paul. Your name Paul?

389
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:33,320
Get your sister to smile,
I'll show you a magic trick.

390
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:38,910
Don't leave me!
Take me with you, Basie!

391
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:41,940
Listen!

392
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:46,750
Listen, Basie! Take me with you!
I can't stay here!

393
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:51,750
I'll work for you. I'll do anything!
Take me with you!

394
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:54,160
Basie! Basie!

395
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,610
- Soochow.
- Soochow!

396
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:19,650
I've been there lots of times.
Straight in that direction!

397
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,750
Head straight in that direction.

398
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:27,950
My parents were members of the country
club. Straight that way.

399
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:34,290
I've lived here my whole life!
I know my way everywhere.

400
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:35,520
I can speak...

401
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:41,090
Soochow!

402
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,740
Here we go!

403
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:49,230
Soochow!

404
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:15,170
Nice pair of golf shoes.

405
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,870
A friend left them to me.

406
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:20,830
You wouldn't want
a watch, would you?

407
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,580
No. Sorry.

408
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,840
Now do you know where we are?
We're here, okay?

409
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:33,510
We have to turn left here.
We have to turn left, okay?

410
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:38,100
You do what I say or we'll never get
to Soochow.

411
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,610
And then you'll be shot.

412
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,340
I look after him for his daddy.

413
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:49,800
- You're American, are you?
- Definitely.

414
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:54,610
I worked underground
for the Kuomintang.

415
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:57,030
As a conjurer?

416
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:18,770
MAN: That must be the camp.
We'll live right by the airfield.

417
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:22,770
- I don't see a camp.
MAN: Over there. See?

418
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:25,770
Those huts at a distance.

419
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,900
What do I do with this?

420
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,140
They want us to carry stones!

421
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:08,380
Please, on the truck is
a sick old man. Please...

422
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:11,490
On the truck, there's an old man.

423
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:15,330
No, no, no. WOMAN: Please!

424
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,200
Papa! Papa!

425
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,840
I'm all right.

426
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:18,530
- Use your wedge!
- That boy, running wild!

427
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:21,320
Spends most of his time
at the 19th hole.

428
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:25,500
You'll be blackballed by
the country club, Jim.

429
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,850
Hello, Jim.

430
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:52,900
That's a splendid cabbage. Thanks.

431
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,420
Now number seven for the sketch.

432
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:20,090
"Fare thee well: 'tis partly my
own fault which death or absence..."

433
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,500
"Stay, gentle Helena, hear my excuse."

434
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:11,850
That's not fair!
Give us our marbles back.

435
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,350
Give us our marbles back!
At least one more chance.

436
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:20,470
Mrs. Phillips!

437
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:22,570
Mrs. Gilmour!

438
01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:28,740
Dr. Rawlins, I've got my homework.

439
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:34,630
Can you do this?

440
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:43,380
Now don't speed up.
Keep the rhythm.

441
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,040
She's gone, Dr. Rawlins.

442
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:20,040
She just looked at me. She looked
at me! I've done it!

443
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,630
I can bring her back to life!

444
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:26,380
Watch her eyes. I can do it again!

445
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:29,870
She thought she was dying in England.

446
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:32,450
Stop it, Jim!

447
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:42,530
You pumped some blood into her brain,
just for a moment.

448
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:53,950
Give the mosquito net to Mr. Radik.
Just give it to him.

449
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:58,350
You give the mosquito net
to whoever's dying next?

450
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:39,290
Future passive. "I shall be loved."

451
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:43,000
Amabor. It's like
losing the war, dying.

452
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,540
"They were being loved."

453
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:48,130
Amabantur. Can I have his shoes
when he's dead?

454
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:49,880
You pragmatist.

455
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:53,340
- "You will have been loved."
<i>- Amatus eris.{\i}.</i>

456
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,180
We have to beat them.

457
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:57,800
- Who?
- The Japanese.

458
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:01,140
It's how we'll win, refusing to die.

459
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:05,150
- What happens when war ends?
- Do you want it to end?

460
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:08,940
If we stay in the camps,
the Japanese will look after us.

461
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:13,740
We're an embarrassment to them.
They can't feed us much longer.

462
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:16,240
They'll fight the Americans.

463
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,830
RAWLINS: You admire the Japanese?
JIM: They're brave.

464
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:21,910
- That's important?
- If you want to win a war.

465
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:24,420
We don't want them to win.

466
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:27,260
I know.

467
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:30,330
Remember, we're British.

468
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:31,820
Yes.

469
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:34,120
I've never been there.

470
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:37,100
Put that down.

471
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:40,790
Tomorrow, gerunds.
What about English?

472
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:45,520
Think of it as the antidote.

473
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,020
<i>We are never sure of sorrow{\i}
Joy was never sure{\i}.</i>

474
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,940
<i>Today will die, tomorrow{\i}
Time stoops to no man's lure{\i}.</i>

475
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,820
<i>With love grown...{\i}.</i>

476
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:56,280
Learn it as a poem.
It's not just a string of words.

477
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:00,760
- Would you look at Mr. Radik?
- Yes, of course.

478
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:03,660
Those from the hospital garden?

479
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,960
I have to give Basie something...

480
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,750
Good thing you're friends.
He's a survivor.

481
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:11,900
Because he only drinks boiled water.

482
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:16,220
You'll wear yourself out looking
ater everyone.

483
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:20,560
Keeps himself busy, doesn't he?

484
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,220
Young Jim.

485
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:29,860
- The caterers are arriving.
- I'll be there!

486
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:32,460
Won't taste the same without you.

487
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:43,480
Wait for me!

488
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:07,980
MAN: What about mines?
- Get out.

489
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:12,780
MAN: Maybe the Japs put down mines.
- Hey, boss. Boss!

490
01:17:14,190 --> 01:17:17,730
- Boss, it's the kid.
BASIE: Come in.

491
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:26,240
- Would you like a Hershey bar?
- Please!

492
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:29,150
So would I. Have you got one?

493
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:38,090
Stop breathing so much.
There ain't enough air.

494
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:41,010
There isn't enough air for you
in China.

495
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:44,800
- Here are your clothes.
- Better than the Shanghai laundry.

496
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:47,180
- Did you get a cork?
- I got one.

497
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:48,760
Good boy.

498
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:53,100
- That's fine.
- I've never seen that one. What year?

499
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:56,320
- '45.
- '45? How'd you get that?

500
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:01,120
I subscribe. It has Packard,
Studebaker, Jell-O. Things from home.

501
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,620
- Can you get me a sewing needle?
- I'll try.

502
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:07,790
- What's that?
- It's a trap.

503
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:09,870
Get out of here.

504
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:14,040
It's all right. You're almost one of
us. You see that Mustang?

505
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:18,840
- It's the Cadillac of the sky.
- That's right. B-29s too.

506
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:20,590
B-29s?

507
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:23,760
The Super fortress.
A hemisphere defense weapon.

508
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,970
Where from?

509
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:28,810
Okinawa. Philippines. Tokyo's in
bombing range now.

510
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:31,850
- Tokyo?
- Time to think of going home soon.

511
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:34,060
We'll have to leave the camp?

512
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:36,650
One side feeds you,
the other tries to kill you.

513
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:38,900
It's turned around. It's all timing.

514
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:43,700
- Tell me when it's time? Promise?
- Promise.

515
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:45,870
It'd be simpler to live here.

516
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:49,450
You've the British dorm to go to
when they're sick of you.

517
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:51,370
They are sick of me.

518
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:55,580
The British dorm's so lethargic.
Will you let me?

519
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:59,750
This'll be the place on Thanksgiving.
I'll have pheasant.

520
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,960
Pheasant?

521
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:03,050
Just made the traps.
Works like a noose.

522
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:07,390
Stick out your arm. Neat.

523
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:09,560
I've seen no pheasants, have you?

524
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,020
- Outside the wire.
- Which wire?

525
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,520
- Our wire.
- That close?

526
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,400
At the edge of the airfield,
across the canal.

527
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,280
An American initiative.
Whoever delivers gets the gravy.

528
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:25,070
How's your friend, Dr. Schweitzer?

529
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:28,240
I brought Amy Matthews
back to life for a minute.

530
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:33,040
That's worth a Reader's Digest.
Increase your word power.

531
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:38,130
- I got a new one today: Pragmatist.
- Good word.

532
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,210
If I set the traps, could I live here?

533
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,340
- It's a consideration.
- Take me with you?

534
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:50,140
Frankly, it's a tossup now between
you and Dainty.

535
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:51,470
Take me!

536
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:54,930
Give me a good reason I should.

537
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,690
I'm your friend.

538
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:05,990
FRANK: Chow truck's here.
- Mr. Maxton keeps my place.

539
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:28,460
They cut the bloody rations!

540
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:33,940
- Don't worry. I'll get yours.
- You're just like your father.

541
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:43,590
They cut our rations in half!

542
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:47,440
I'll get ours. You sit down.

543
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:55,090
You cut the bloody rations!
You cut them!

544
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:28,070
Mr. Maxton.

545
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:31,650
I've got yours, Mr. Maxton.

546
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:39,120
I've got some! I've got some!

547
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:41,220
Hello, everybody.

548
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:15,280
GIRL: Sit there.
WOMAN: Eat, please.

549
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:21,960
The rations have been cut.
They're like animals.

550
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:26,500
82, 83, 84...

551
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,030
Sorry.

552
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:32,290
87 weevils today, Mr. Victor.

553
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:38,410
Above average, but the trend is down.

554
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,950
MRS. VICTOR: Must you, Jim?
- Sorry.

555
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:56,750
Some of us will die just before we're
saved, so use everything.

556
01:22:56,950 --> 01:23:01,630
- You'll miss this camp after the war.
- Will I?

557
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:05,460
I'll locate my parents when the people
in the camps come out.

558
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:10,260
- I'll tell my dad you looked after me.
- Think I'll get the reward?

559
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:15,540
- What reward?
- You told everyone.

560
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:18,060
I was much younger then.

561
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:21,610
Why'd the Japanese close the school?

562
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:25,250
To punish the grownups.

563
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:31,040
I wonder how you'll take to school
in England.

564
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:33,820
It might be strange.

565
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:37,570
The best teacher's
the university of life.

566
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,950
For heaven's...

567
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:43,750
Could we finish our meal? We know
your views on the university of life.

568
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:50,380
- We should eat the weevils.
- I know. Dr. Rawlins told you.

569
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:54,920
- He said we need the protein.
- Yes, he's right.

570
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:57,780
We should all eat the weevils.

571
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:01,240
Do you believe in vitamins?

572
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:04,840
Strange child.

573
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:13,360
Perhaps it's time you moved
into the men's dormitory.

574
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,870
You're not 12 anymore.

575
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:03,780
The Americans are over Nantao again.

576
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:41,350
They're bombing the Shanghai docks!

577
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,230
Coney Island pilots.

578
01:26:58,230 --> 01:27:00,860
- What was that?
- A 29 going down.

579
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:03,240
- A 200-pounder.
- That was close.

580
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:06,780
- Too close for Nagata.
- He won't like that.

581
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:23,220
What's happening, doctor?

582
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:27,790
Reprisals, and damned silly it is too.

583
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:35,270
- Keep the patients from the windows.
- Yes, doctor.

584
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:23,310
Hey!

585
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:27,400
Get away! This is British food!
Leave it alone!

586
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,810
It's our food. Get away!

587
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:33,870
Guards!

588
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:50,950
Mines. That was a mine. I told you.

589
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:54,310
Somebody lobbed a grenade.

590
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:17,910
Say, Basie, I bet he hits a mine.

591
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:22,080
I bet you there are no mines.
You can walk right through.

592
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,410
You got a bet.

593
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:05,660
So far, so good.

594
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,720
He's seen something.

595
01:33:46,850 --> 01:33:48,770
Jim's a black cat.

596
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:37,150
That's a dead boy, Basie.
I'll give you odds.

597
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:39,270
My harmonica...

598
01:34:39,650 --> 01:34:43,840
and my next meal
against your wristwatch.

599
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,580
You're on, my friend.

600
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,760
I double my bet.
My next two meals.

601
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:11,270
- You'll lose a lot of weight.
- What else you betting?

602
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:13,580
- My Life.
- Who's on the cover?

603
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:25,560
MAN 1: Two cigarettes on Jim!
MAN 2: Sunglasses on Nagata!

604
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:37,600
Keep going, sarge!

605
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:31,400
FRANK: The lucky kid.
MAN: Cleaned me out.

606
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:12,390
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Nina.

607
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:15,060
- Would you like a Hershey bar?
- Yes.

608
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:18,210
So would I, kid. You got one?

609
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:44,780
Don't let me down, kid.
You're an American now.

610
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:57,130
How you doing, Frank?

611
01:39:55,220 --> 01:40:00,020
The river's east. You can go
up the bank or up the middle...

612
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:04,100
or go north of east,
but you gotta go across canals.

613
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:06,980
Don't know if it's buildings or what.

614
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:09,340
Where'd you get a map?

615
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:14,320
A cork and needle?

616
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:18,240
- A compass that actually works.
- Put it down.

617
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:21,120
- Is it time?
- No, I'll tell you when.

618
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:24,000
- You won't forget?
- Fat chance.

619
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,540
- I almost feel human.
- Without me, you'd have no compass.

620
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:31,920
No, without you
I wouldn't have the needle.

621
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,460
The best way is across the river.

622
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:36,010
Nagata!

623
01:40:36,010 --> 01:40:38,370
Jim, the curtain.

624
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:40,510
Jim, come here.

625
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:45,420
You're in charge of my stuff.

626
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:33,460
You see this mosquito net?

627
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:37,520
See?

628
01:43:37,690 --> 01:43:39,850
What's it tell you?

629
01:43:45,450 --> 01:43:48,300
Rawlins is on the take.

630
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:54,130
- You're so clever, Basie.
- Yeah.

631
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:58,240
Only cost me two batteries.

632
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:01,350
How are you feeling?

633
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:03,260
I've had worse.

634
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:06,160
I was beaten by a stoker once.

635
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:08,560
Were you a stoker?

636
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:13,400
Ship's steward.
Shanghai-Frisco line.

637
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,970
Why did he beat you?

638
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:25,030
Shanghai-Frisco will be
the trip now. Huh, Jim?

639
01:44:25,990 --> 01:44:29,320
Basie, where do you live?

640
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:30,800
Here.

641
01:44:30,830 --> 01:44:33,660
No, I mean after the war.

642
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:35,780
Somewhere else.

643
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:45,510
Until you find a place,
you could live at Amherst Avenue.

644
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:53,430
I'd like you to come
and meet my parents.

645
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:58,620
We could fill up the pool...

646
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:02,250
and we'll eat three times a day.

647
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:08,110
You're not feeling
sorry for me, are you?

648
01:45:08,110 --> 01:45:12,620
- No one feels sorry for you, Basie.
- That's right.

649
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:17,420
- And you always eat first.
- You said it, kid.

650
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:21,960
I've been thinking about
going upriver.

651
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:23,930
I know.

652
01:45:25,090 --> 01:45:26,920
Listen...

653
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:31,720
The plan is,
we're going to get a sampan.

654
01:45:31,890 --> 01:45:36,690
Take it up the Yangtze estuary.
Rendezvous with some Hakka friends.

655
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:39,980
Are they proper pirates, you mean?

656
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:44,650
Let's just call them gentlemen
of fortune, shall we?

657
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:49,530
Did you ever see...

658
01:45:49,530 --> 01:45:54,160
- ...the Hell Drivers in Shanghai?
- Yes. On the newsreels.

659
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:57,000
I saw them crash
through a burning wall.

660
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,250
That's what I'm going to call
our little outfit.

661
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:03,340
With 250 calibers...

662
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:07,050
we are going to be
the lords of the Yangtze.

663
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:10,090
Actually, that may be a better name.

664
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:14,760
It's at the beginning and end of war
that we have to watch out.

665
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:18,480
In between, it's like a country club.

666
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:23,280
But you gotta know how to stay
balanced and make the right friends.

667
01:46:23,730 --> 01:46:27,900
Because this war
is definitely winding down.

668
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:29,690
And after that?

669
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:31,860
After that...

670
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:36,660
I retire in luxury,
start a barber college...

671
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,300
What are you doing here?

672
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:01,640
I told you to look out for my stuff.

673
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:08,950
They were bigger than me.

674
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:36,170
DAINTY: Look who's here.
MAN 1: So you were under the net?

675
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:38,780
Cleaned up your room.

676
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:47,770
Stay with me, darling!

677
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:05,550
RAWLINS: Everybody inside, quick!
MAN: Away from the buildings!

678
01:53:07,930 --> 01:53:10,260
Oh, God. Please, no!

679
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:12,570
My husband's in there!

680
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:17,830
Go! P-51, Cadillac of the sky!

681
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:28,550
P-51, Cadillac of the sky!

682
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:37,390
Jim?

683
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:43,150
Jim, get off the roof!

684
01:54:43,150 --> 01:54:45,070
Jim!

685
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:49,970
Horsepower!

686
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:08,680
Get down, Jim. Go on, get down!

687
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:13,210
P-51! Aren't they beautiful?

688
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:16,010
- Get down!
- I touched them!

689
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:20,770
I felt their heat! I can taste them.
Oil and cordite.

690
01:55:20,770 --> 01:55:23,100
Come back to the hospital.

691
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:26,520
Remember how we helped
to build the runway?

692
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:31,320
If we'd died like the others,
our bones would be in the runway.

693
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:36,540
- In a way, it's our runway.
- No, it's their runway, Jim.

694
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:38,820
Try not to think so much.

695
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:42,200
Try not to think so much!

696
01:55:51,340 --> 01:55:55,130
I can't remember
what my parents look like.

697
01:55:59,770 --> 01:56:04,050
I used to play bridge
with my mother in her bedroom.

698
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:09,700
She used to comb her hair.
I'd watch her.

699
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:13,750
She had dark hair.

700
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:14,360
What's happening?

701
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:20,510
The guards are leaving!
They're taking us upcountry.

702
01:59:20,510 --> 01:59:23,470
MAN 1: They're moving us to Nantao!
There's food there.

703
01:59:23,470 --> 01:59:28,270
MAN 2: One suitcase!
We leave in one hour! One suitcase!

704
01:59:28,350 --> 01:59:29,870
One suitcase!

705
01:59:30,230 --> 01:59:33,130
Our rations are at Nantao.

706
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:42,670
He's gone.

707
01:59:43,950 --> 01:59:45,820
Him and Dainty.

708
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:50,970
He's gone?

709
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:54,320
He's escaped?

710
01:59:56,290 --> 01:59:59,150
He can't have. He promised me!

711
02:00:05,090 --> 02:00:07,360
He knew it was time.

712
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:12,470
- Where am I gonna go?
- We'll all have to leave now.

713
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:18,440
He knew it was time.

714
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:38,410
Boy.

715
02:00:41,090 --> 02:00:43,550
Difficult boy.

716
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:04,680
Just look...

717
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:09,300
later here for escort!

718
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:05,340
Jim, where's my husband?
Where's Mr. Victor?

719
02:07:15,940 --> 02:07:18,110
We are civilians. Listen to me.

720
02:07:18,110 --> 02:07:22,910
I am a British doctor.
They are my responsibility!

721
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:38,460
We must have rest and food.

722
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:41,660
We're going upcountry, Jim.

723
02:07:42,970 --> 02:07:45,030
Will there be food there?

724
02:07:46,260 --> 02:07:48,720
There's none here.

725
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:57,320
Mrs. Victor, we're going upcountry.

726
02:07:57,690 --> 02:08:02,490
Mrs. Victor.

727
02:08:03,490 --> 02:08:05,600
Come on, Jim.

728
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:10,870
No.

729
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:15,250
Don't go. It's better here.

730
02:08:19,170 --> 02:08:20,710
Jim!

731
02:08:20,710 --> 02:08:23,220
You'll die here.

732
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:27,040
Don't worry, Mr. Maxton.

733
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:38,080
Pretend you're dead, Mrs. Victor.

734
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:24,070
Mrs. Victor.

735
02:10:31,010 --> 02:10:35,220
MAN: Surrender reached the
<i>Japanese in a broadcast by Hirohito.{\i}.</i>

736
02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:39,810
<i>He said Japan will endure the{\i}
unendurable and suffer greatly.{\i}.</i>

737
02:10:39,810 --> 02:10:44,610
<i>The war minister and others{\i}
committed suicide outside the palace.{\i}.</i>

738
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:49,030
<i>Japan is devastated, {\i}
destroyed in spirit...{\i}</i>

739
02:10:49,030 --> 02:10:52,070
<i>as Hiroshima and Nagasaki{\i}
have been destroyed.{\i}.</i>

740
02:10:52,070 --> 02:10:54,830
<i>More than 100,000 people{\i}
were killed...{\i}</i>

741
02:10:54,830 --> 02:10:59,160
<i>in two single-bomb explosions, {\i}
which ended the Pacific War.{\i}.</i>

742
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:02,330
<i>The Russian declaration of war...{\i}</i>

743
02:11:02,330 --> 02:11:05,500
<i>has sent a million{\i}
soldiers into Manchuria.{\i}.</i>

744
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:10,300
<i>Tokyo was hit with a dawn-to-dusk{\i}
raid by 1500 B-29 bombers.{\i}.</i>

745
02:11:10,550 --> 02:11:14,340
<i>But Japan's war was lost.{\i}
Her goal to create...{\i}</i>

746
02:11:14,350 --> 02:11:17,560
<i>a new empire incinerated{\i}
in a flash...{\i}</i>

747
02:11:17,560 --> 02:11:19,930
<i>hotter than the sun.{\i}.</i>

748
02:11:19,930 --> 02:11:23,600
<i>Everyone stands in awe of{\i}
the new super-weapon.{\i}.</i>

749
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:28,400
<i>Only a few scientists knew the power{\i}

750
02:11:28,530 --> 02:11:31,320

751
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:34,660
<i>and a white light: The atom bomb.{\i}.</i>

752
02:11:34,660 --> 02:11:36,740
<i>Each of the two bombs...{\i}</i>

753
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:40,410
<i>had the power of{\i}
20,000 tons of explosives.{\i}.</i>

754
02:11:40,410 --> 02:11:43,710
<i>Nagasaki is{\i}
Japan's gateway to China...{\i}</i>

755
02:11:43,710 --> 02:11:47,350
<i>just 500 miles from Shanghai.{\i}</i>

756
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:52,800
I saw that! I saw it! I saw it!

757
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:56,530
The white light.

758
02:11:58,010 --> 02:12:02,290
I thought it was Mrs. Victor's
soul going to heaven.

759
02:15:34,110 --> 02:15:35,990
Jim!

760
02:16:03,090 --> 02:16:06,000
Bastard!

761
02:16:20,150 --> 02:16:21,770
Jim!

762
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:31,080
He gave me a mango.

763
02:16:31,620 --> 02:16:34,620
I'll give you
a whole fruit salad!

764
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:38,330
There's Frigidaires
falling from the sky!

765
02:16:38,340 --> 02:16:41,460
- He was my friend!
- He was a Jap!

766
02:16:41,460 --> 02:16:43,580
The war's over!

767
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:49,870
You walked here from Nantao Stadium?

768
02:16:53,890 --> 02:16:57,940
What did you see? Rich pickings?

769
02:16:57,940 --> 02:17:00,730
Crystal chandeliers, cocktail bars...

770
02:17:00,730 --> 02:17:03,090
white pianos?

771
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:12,360
I learned a new word today.

772
02:17:14,370 --> 02:17:16,440
Atom bomb.

773
02:17:18,380 --> 02:17:22,110
It was like a white light
in the sky.

774
02:17:24,090 --> 02:17:27,680
Like God taking a photograph.

775
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:31,670
I saw it.

776
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:49,700
I can bring everyone back.

777
02:17:54,330 --> 02:17:55,950
Everyone.

778
02:17:58,670 --> 02:18:01,370
I can bring everyone back.

779
02:18:02,710 --> 02:18:04,290
Everyone.

780
02:18:05,670 --> 02:18:08,380
I can bring everyone back.

781
02:18:10,390 --> 02:18:11,760
Everyone.

782
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:18,540
I can bring everyone back.

783
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:21,290
Everyone.

784
02:18:23,770 --> 02:18:26,680
I can bring everyone back.

785
02:18:28,820 --> 02:18:30,790
Everyone.

786
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:35,400
I can bring everyone back.

787
02:18:35,410 --> 02:18:36,950
Everyone.

788
02:18:36,950 --> 02:18:41,280
I can bring everyone back.

789
02:18:43,630 --> 02:18:46,730
- Everyone. Everyone.
- Jim!

790
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:53,140
- Didn't I teach you anything?
- Yes!

791
02:18:53,260 --> 02:18:54,790
Yeah.

792
02:18:55,430 --> 02:19:00,110
You taught me people will do
anything for a potato.

793
02:19:01,770 --> 02:19:03,860
Three years with him?

794
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:07,440
Come on. I'll take you
back to your dad.

795
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:12,240
We'll fill the pool
and eat three meals a day.

796
02:19:49,150 --> 02:19:52,400
Kid, you want a Hershey's bar?

797
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:55,350
Yes, please, Basie.

798
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:58,560
I surrender.

799
02:22:40,240 --> 02:22:42,400
Come along. Off you go.

800
02:22:44,410 --> 02:22:47,410
Gather in, children.

801
02:23:11,270 --> 02:23:12,650
Mum?

802
02:23:29,830 --> 02:23:32,390
Ju... Julie!

803
02:24:06,070 --> 02:24:07,800
Jamie?

804
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:15,010
Jamie.

805
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:19,120
