3
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:31,765
Hey!

4
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,139
We live in a twilight world.

5
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:22,143
We live in a twilight world.

6
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,179
And there are
no friends at dusk.

7
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,981
You've been made. This siege is
a blind for them to vanish you.

8
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:33,787
But I established contact.

9
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:35,557
Bring you in or kill you.

10
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:37,892
I have two minutes. Make up your mind.

11
00:03:42,696 --> 00:03:44,065
Where's the package?

12
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:45,266
Coat check.

13
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:10,791
Stay.

14
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:38,719
No friends
at dusk, huh?

15
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:39,753
You'll do.

16
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,322
Get him to the rally point.

17
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:16,224
Swap clothes. The Ukrainians
are expecting a passenger.

18
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,059
I've never seen encapsulation
like this.

19
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:20,461
We don't know how old it is,
but it's the real deal.

20
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,496
Did you have an out?

21
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:23,364
Service tunnel to the sewer.

22
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:26,767
Take this. Take him. Take his exit.
I don't trust ours anymore.

23
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,203
Can you defuse that?

24
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,604
It's centrally synchronized.
Are there more?

25
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:31,172
Covering their tracks.

26
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,739
- Taking out the audience?
- They're just the cheap seats.

27
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:33,608
That's not our mission.

28
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:34,943
Mine now.

29
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:01,336
Walk away.

30
00:06:05,106 --> 00:06:07,308
You don't have to
kill these people.

31
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:21,055
That wasn't one of us.

32
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:22,823
I'll take the help.

33
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:25,927
Go, go, go.

34
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,824
A man can be trained

35
00:06:57,892 --> 00:06:59,860
to hold out
for about 18 hours,

36
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:03,064
so your colleagues
will be clear by 7:00.

37
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:10,938
He didn't last 18 minutes.

38
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:12,907
He didn't have anything
to hide.

39
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,410
You were smuggling a nobody.

40
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:20,181
It's risky.

41
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:25,720
Or were you counting on this?

42
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:27,221
Death.

43
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:29,223
CIA issue.

44
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:39,534
Spare yourself,
once they clear.

45
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:55,917
Almost 7:00.

46
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:57,352
Uh-oh.

47
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,192
It's running fast.

48
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:10,398
We have to put it back
one hour.

49
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:31,386
Get it out!

50
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,912
Welcome to the afterlife.

51
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:00,281
You've been in a
medically-induced coma

52
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:04,051
while we got you out of Ukraine
and rebuilt your mouth.

53
00:09:04,118 --> 00:09:08,356
The suicide pills
are fake.

54
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,558
Why?

55
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,260
A test.

56
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:13,461
A test?

57
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:18,633
They pulled my teeth out.

58
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,437
Did my team get clear?

59
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,705
No.

60
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,707
Private Russians, we think.

61
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,644
Somebody talked.

62
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:32,213
Not you.

63
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,416
You chose to die instead of
giving up your colleagues.

64
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:48,196
We all believe we'd run
into the burning building.

65
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:52,567
But until we feel that heat,
we can never know.

66
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,001
You do.

67
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:01,542
I resign.

68
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:05,246
You don't work for us.
You're dead.

69
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,216
Your duty transcends
national interests.

70
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:10,284
This is about survival.

71
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:13,688
Whose?

72
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,625
Everyone's.

73
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:23,331
There's a cold war,
cold as ice.

74
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:27,068
To even know its true nature
is to lose.

75
00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:28,769
This is knowledge divided.

76
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,406
All I have for you is a gesture

77
00:10:32,473 --> 00:10:34,877
in combination with a word.

78
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:36,244
"Tenet."

79
00:10:37,913 --> 00:10:40,681
Use it carefully.

80
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:44,051
It'll open the right doors,
but some of the wrong ones, too.

81
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:46,254
That's all they've told you?

82
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:49,023
That test you passed?

83
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:51,759
Not everybody does.

84
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:09,497
With a high-vis vest and a clipboard,
you can get almost anywhere.

85
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:11,265
Almost.

86
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,367
An obscure tenet.

87
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,477
No small talk.

88
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:25,680
Nothing that might reveal
who we are or what we do.

89
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:28,516
I thought I was here
to find out what we do.

90
00:13:28,582 --> 00:13:31,252
You're not here for "what,"
you're here for "how."

91
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:34,488
"What" is your department
and not my business.

92
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:36,791
Well, to do what I do...

93
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,760
I need some idea
of the threat we face.

94
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,800
As I understand it,
we're trying to prevent World War III.

95
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,601
Nuclear holocaust?

96
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,270
No.

97
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,339
Something worse.

98
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:02,817
Aim it and pull the trigger.

99
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,954
It's empty.

100
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:07,022
Aim it.

101
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:14,261
Check the magazine.

102
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,734
How?

103
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:29,410
One of these bullets is like us,
traveling forwards through time.

104
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:32,214
The other one's
going backwards.

105
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,648
Can you tell which is which?

106
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,385
How about now?

107
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:41,189
It's inverted.
Its entropy runs backwards.

108
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,126
So, to our eyes,
its movement is reversed.

109
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:47,595
We think it's a type of inverse
radiation triggered by nuclear fission.

110
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:48,662
You didn't make it?

111
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:50,165
No, we don't know how yet.

112
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:51,565
So, where'd it come from?

113
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:54,002
Someone's manufacturing them
in the future.

114
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:56,071
They're streaming back at us.

115
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:57,471
Try it.

116
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:06,480
You have to have dropped it.

117
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:20,361
How can it move
before I touch it?

118
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:22,797
From your point of view,
you caught it.

119
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:25,267
But from the bullet's point of
view, you dropped it.

120
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:27,002
But cause comes before effect.

121
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:30,272
No, that's just the way
we see time.

122
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:32,207
Well, what about free will?

123
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:34,642
That bullet wouldn't have moved
if you hadn't put your hand there.

124
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,812
Either way we run the tape,
you made it happen.

125
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:40,815
Don't try to understand it.

126
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,417
Feel it.

127
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:54,930
Instinct.

128
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,832
Got it.

129
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,705
Why does it feel so strange?

130
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,043
You're not shooting the bullet,

131
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:09,610
you're catching it.

132
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:12,780
Whoa.

133
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:17,285
I've seen this type
of ammunition before.

134
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,352
In the field?

135
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:19,620
I was almost hit.

136
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,023
Then you were
exceedingly lucky.

137
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,160
An inverted bullet passing through
your body would be devastating.

138
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:26,594
Not pretty.

139
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:29,763
These look like today's.

140
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,599
They may have been made today
and inverted years from now.

141
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:33,634
Where did you get them?

142
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,704
Came with the wall. I was assigned it,
like all the material I'm studying here.

143
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,472
Do you have an analysis
on the metals?

144
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,407
Sure. Why?

145
00:16:40,474 --> 00:16:43,011
The mixture of alloys can tell me
where they might have been made.

146
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:44,578
Look...

147
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,581
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.

148
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:52,620
The bullet may not seem like
much, but it's a simple machine.

149
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:55,756
Lead bullet, brass casing,
gunpowder.

150
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,093
If they can invert that,

151
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,860
I see no reason they couldn't
invert pretty much anything.

152
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:03,031
Even a nuclear weapon
can only affect our future.

153
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:06,935
An inverted weapon might be
able to affect our past as well.

154
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:15,076
Now that we know what to look for, we're
finding more and more inverted material.

155
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:17,979
Remnants of complex objects.

156
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:22,816
What do you think we're seeing?

157
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:27,188
The detritus of a coming war.

158
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:48,209
- <i>Yep?</i>
- We live in a twilight world.

159
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,611
<i>No friends at dusk.
I was told you left the building.</i>

160
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:52,247
Even the dead need allies.

161
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:53,915
<i>Specifically?</i>

162
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:57,152
I need an assist in Mumbai.
I need to get to Sanjay Singh.

163
00:17:57,218 --> 00:17:58,752
<i>Singh?</i>

164
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,521
<i>He never leaves his house.
And his house is...</i>

165
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:01,655
- <i>his house.</i>
- Yes, it is.

166
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:03,325
I'm looking right at it.

167
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,160
<i>I'll see who's on deck.</i>

168
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:07,228
<i>Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.</i>

169
00:18:19,506 --> 00:18:20,808
It seems you need
an introduction

170
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:24,145
to a prominent Mumbai local
on short notice.

171
00:18:25,347 --> 00:18:26,580
I'm Neil.

172
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,682
I need an audience
with Sanjay Singh.

173
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,120
That's not possible.

174
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:35,123
Ten minutes tops.

175
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,624
Time isn't the problem.

176
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:39,995
It's getting out alive
that's the problem.

177
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:46,234
Would you take a child hostage?
A woman?

178
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:47,601
If I had to.

179
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,603
I'm not looking to make much
noise here.

180
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,671
Yes?

181
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:53,774
Vodka tonic. And a Diet Coke.

182
00:18:56,077 --> 00:18:57,145
What?

183
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,280
You never drink on the job.

184
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,848
You're well-informed.

185
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:04,618
Well, pays to be
in our profession.

186
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,022
Well, I prefer soda water.

187
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,691
No, you don't.

188
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:13,560
How's your parachuting?

189
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:15,397
I broke an ankle
during basic training.

190
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:18,732
Singh's house isn't tall enough
to parachute off of.

191
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,135
It's bungee-jumpable.

192
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,470
I don't think "bungee-jumpable"
is a word.

193
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,773
It may not be a word, but it may
be our only way out of that place.

194
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,943
Or into it, for that matter.

195
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,919
I know you're tired.
I'm also very tired.

196
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:15,450
Stay back.

197
00:21:15,517 --> 00:21:18,620
I was almost taken out by a very
unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.

198
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:21,655
I want to know who supplied it.

199
00:21:21,722 --> 00:21:23,491
My name is Sanjay.

200
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:25,659
And you are?

201
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:27,595
No chitchat?

202
00:21:27,694 --> 00:21:29,230
There's no one
at the other end.

203
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:30,899
No one who's gonna
help you, anyway.

204
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:34,701
Don't let it get cold.

205
00:21:36,571 --> 00:21:38,373
Why should I know
who supplied it?

206
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:41,643
Combination of metals
is unique to India.

207
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,776
If it's from India,
it's from you.

208
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,646
- Fine assumption.
- Deduction.

209
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:46,314
Deduction, then.

210
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:47,916
Look, my friend...

211
00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:50,952
guns are never conducive
to a productive negotiation.

212
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,621
I'm not the man they send
to negotiate.

213
00:21:54,956 --> 00:21:56,823
Or the man they send
to make deals.

214
00:21:56,891 --> 00:22:00,028
But I am the man
people talk to.

215
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,231
I can't.

216
00:22:03,298 --> 00:22:04,432
I can't tell you.

217
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:06,034
You're an arms dealer, friend.

218
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,735
This may be the easiest trigger
I've ever had to pull.

219
00:22:08,802 --> 00:22:10,638
To say anything
about a client

220
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,707
would violate the tenets
he lives by.

221
00:22:13,774 --> 00:22:16,945
If tenets are important to you,
then you can tell me.

222
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:18,980
Everything.

223
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,150
Not while you have a gun
to my husband's head.

224
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:25,786
Sanjay, make a drink
for our guest, please.

225
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:27,455
<i>Cheers.</i>

226
00:22:27,522 --> 00:22:29,591
- Priya.
- Hmm.

227
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:31,559
This is your operation?

228
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:34,963
A masculine front in
a man's world has its uses.

229
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,398
The dealer you're looking for
is Andrei Sator.

230
00:22:37,465 --> 00:22:38,633
The Russian oligarch.

231
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,668
- You know him?
- Not personally.

232
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,670
Made his billions in gas.

233
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,441
Moved to London. Said to be on
the outs with Moscow.

234
00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:48,276
Very good.

235
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:51,312
Except the gas he made his billions
from was actually plutonium.

236
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:55,216
None of which explains how or why
you sold him inverted munitions.

237
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:57,818
When I sold him the rounds,
they were perfectly ordinary.

238
00:22:57,885 --> 00:23:00,255
So how did he
get them inverted?

239
00:23:00,321 --> 00:23:03,157
We believe he's functioning
as some sort of a broker.

240
00:23:03,224 --> 00:23:05,426
Between our time
and the future.

241
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:08,596
He can communicate
with the future?

242
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:10,131
We all do, don't we?

243
00:23:10,198 --> 00:23:12,033
E-mails, credit cards, texts.

244
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,070
Anything that goes into the record
speaks directly to the future.

245
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:20,108
The question is,
can the future speak back?

246
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:22,477
And I'm supposed to find out?

247
00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:26,748
To get anywhere near Sator would
take a fresh-faced protagonist.

248
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:29,484
And you are fresh as a daisy.

249
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,718
Get close.

250
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,054
Find out what he's receiving
and how.

251
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,089
Is it safe to involve
British Intelligence?

252
00:23:35,156 --> 00:23:37,791
I have a contact
who's out of Sator's reach.

253
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:46,067
You must've had a plan for
getting out.

254
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,835
Not one I love.

255
00:24:11,793 --> 00:24:13,661
May I help you, sir?

256
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:15,163
I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.

257
00:24:15,229 --> 00:24:17,932
I presume you mean
Sir Michael Crosby's lunch.

258
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,133
Presume away.

259
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,968
If you'll follow me.

260
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,909
Started without you.
Hope you don't mind.

261
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:29,911
I'll catch up.

262
00:24:30,712 --> 00:24:31,845
Same for me, please.

263
00:24:31,913 --> 00:24:33,014
I'll send the waiter.

264
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:35,483
No, just pass on the order.

265
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,386
I gather you have an interest
in a certain Russian national.

266
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:41,389
Anglo-Russian.
So I have to watch my step.

267
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:44,225
Indeed. He's tapped into
the intelligence services.

268
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:47,562
I've warned them
he's feeding them rubbish...

269
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:48,896
but they don't seem to care.

270
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:50,598
Tell me about him.

271
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:54,135
I assume you're familiar with
the Soviet-era secret cities.

272
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:58,106
Closed cities, not shown on maps.
Built around sensitive industries.

273
00:24:58,172 --> 00:25:01,709
Most of them have been opened
up and renamed as regular towns.

274
00:25:01,776 --> 00:25:03,578
Not the one Sator grew up in.

275
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:05,179
Stalsk-12.

276
00:25:05,246 --> 00:25:08,049
In the '70s,
it had a population of about 200,000.

277
00:25:08,116 --> 00:25:09,450
Thought to be abandoned.

278
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:11,219
Abandoned?

279
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:14,689
Some kind of accident. After which
it was used for underground tests.

280
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:17,492
Two weeks ago, same day as the
Kiev opera siege,

281
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,862
we spotted a detonation
in northern Siberia,

282
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:23,264
just where Stalsk-12 was.

283
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:26,768
Sator emerged from
this blank spot on the map

284
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,669
with ambition...

285
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,906
and enough money to buy his way
into the British establishment.

286
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:33,441
Through his wife?

287
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:36,077
Katherine Barton. Oldest niece
of Sir Frederick Barton.

288
00:25:36,144 --> 00:25:38,546
She works at Shipley's.
Met Sator at an auction.

289
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:39,580
A happy marriage?

290
00:25:39,647 --> 00:25:41,749
Practically estranged.

291
00:25:41,816 --> 00:25:42,917
Well, how do I get to Sator?

292
00:25:42,984 --> 00:25:44,552
Well, through her, of course.

293
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:47,188
You may have an inflated idea
of my powers of seduction.

294
00:25:47,722 --> 00:25:48,923
Hardly.

295
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:51,993
We have an ace in the hole.

296
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:57,098
You're carrying a Goya
in a Harrods bag.

297
00:25:57,165 --> 00:25:59,801
It's a fake by a Spaniard
named Arepo.

298
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:03,137
One of two we've confiscated
from an embezzler in Bern.

299
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:04,839
What happened to the other one?

300
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:07,708
It turned up at Shipley's.
Authenticated by Katherine Barton.

301
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,110
Put on auction.

302
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:10,845
And who do you think bought it?

303
00:26:10,913 --> 00:26:11,914
Her husband?

304
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:13,214
Mmm-hmm.

305
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:16,250
Does she know it's a forgery?

306
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:17,552
Oh, it's hard to say.

307
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:21,789
Rumor has it that
she and Arepo were close.

308
00:26:21,856 --> 00:26:23,157
Uh-huh.

309
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:25,993
Look, no offense,

310
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,997
but in this world, when someone
is claiming to be a billionaire...

311
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:33,434
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.

312
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:35,203
I'm assuming I'm on a budget.

313
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:38,005
Save the world,
then we'll balance the books.

314
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:40,441
Can I recommend a tailor?

315
00:26:40,508 --> 00:26:41,809
I'll manage.

316
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:44,011
You British don't have a
monopoly on snobbery, you know.

317
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:45,346
Well, not a monopoly.

318
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:47,582
More of a controlling interest.

319
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:50,618
Could you box that up for me?

320
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:51,786
Certainly not.

321
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,056
Goodbye, Sir Michael.

322
00:27:27,655 --> 00:27:29,123
How can I help, sir?

323
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,463
Sorry, I wasn't notified
of any appointments, Mr...

324
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,531
Goya.

325
00:27:37,732 --> 00:27:39,200
Mr. Goya.

326
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:41,502
No. I'm told you're
the person to see about Goya.

327
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:45,506
That's extraordinary.

328
00:27:50,678 --> 00:27:52,179
What's it worth?

329
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,116
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

330
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:59,320
Lots of work to do
before any kind of valuation.

331
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:04,358
Provenance, microscopic
examination, X-rays.

332
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:06,694
But what does
your heart tell you?

333
00:28:10,698 --> 00:28:12,633
Sir, where did you say
you acquired this drawing?

334
00:28:13,768 --> 00:28:14,835
Tomas Arepo.

335
00:28:18,205 --> 00:28:21,709
I bought my Goya for cents on a
dollar from an irate Swiss banker.

336
00:28:21,776 --> 00:28:24,679
Traced it back to Arepo,
then realized I scored a bargain

337
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,582
when he told me who paid top dollar
for another one of his pictures.

338
00:28:27,648 --> 00:28:30,052
- Your husband.
- Where's your bargain?

339
00:28:30,117 --> 00:28:31,252
Your drawing's an obvious fake.

340
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,055
My drawing's a very good fake.

341
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,522
You know that
better than anyone.

342
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:36,524
The information's the bargain.

343
00:28:37,993 --> 00:28:40,028
The information that I helped
defraud my own husband?

344
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:43,364
He and I are in related businesses,
but he's a very hard man to meet.

345
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:44,933
If you and I were
to make an arrangement...

346
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,300
Arrangement?

347
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:47,903
You mean blackmail.

348
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,270
Don't be afraid of the word.

349
00:28:49,337 --> 00:28:51,405
My husband isn't.

350
00:28:51,472 --> 00:28:53,274
I'm sorry to tell you
he got there first.

351
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:55,309
He knows? And he's never done
anything about it?

352
00:28:55,376 --> 00:28:56,510
Why would he?

353
00:28:56,577 --> 00:28:58,179
He paid $9 million for it.

354
00:28:58,245 --> 00:29:00,748
Barely cover the cost of the
holiday he just forced us on.

355
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:02,383
Where'd you go, Mars?

356
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:07,188
Vietnam, on our yacht.
His yacht.

357
00:29:07,254 --> 00:29:10,625
You've got the suit.
The shoes, the watch.

358
00:29:10,691 --> 00:29:13,427
Think you're a little
out of your depth.

359
00:29:13,494 --> 00:29:16,697
People who've amassed fortunes,
like your husband's,

360
00:29:16,764 --> 00:29:20,635
generally aren't okay with
being cheated out of any of it.

361
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,509
The drawing is his hold
over me.

362
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:37,652
He threatened me with police.
Prison. The works.

363
00:29:39,787 --> 00:29:41,555
He controls me.

364
00:29:41,622 --> 00:29:44,291
My contact with my son.
Everything.

365
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:47,929
Leaving would never have been
easy but now it's impossible.

366
00:29:49,196 --> 00:29:51,365
You can't fight.

367
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,902
Just beg.

368
00:29:55,904 --> 00:29:58,040
In Vietnam,
I tried to love him again.

369
00:29:58,106 --> 00:30:01,509
Thought if there was love there,
he might give me my son back.

370
00:30:01,575 --> 00:30:05,746
We sat on that bloody boat
watching the sunsets,

371
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:08,249
<i>imitating some earlier time
in our lives.</i>

372
00:30:08,315 --> 00:30:11,285
He seemed happy,
so I asked him.

373
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:13,387
<i>And he made me an offer.</i>

374
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:16,323
He'd let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

375
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:23,165
I expressed myself.
I took Max ashore.

376
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,967
He called us, contrite.

377
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,601
And when we got back,

378
00:30:27,668 --> 00:30:29,004
<i>I glimpsed some other woman
diving off the boat,</i>

379
00:30:29,071 --> 00:30:30,604
and he'd vanished.

380
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:35,409
I never felt such envy.

381
00:30:35,476 --> 00:30:36,978
You don't seem
the jealous type.

382
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:38,646
Of her freedom.

383
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,020
You know how I dream
of just diving off that boat?

384
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:46,520
But you share a son.

385
00:30:47,189 --> 00:30:49,623
That's my life now.

386
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,726
Did you know the drawing
was a fake?

387
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:52,793
No.

388
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,329
Tomas and I became close,
maybe too close.

389
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,731
I failed.

390
00:30:56,797 --> 00:30:59,266
Andrei can't conceive of
failure, only betrayal.

391
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:00,936
But I didn't betray my husband.

392
00:31:01,002 --> 00:31:03,604
Retrospect, maybe I missed
my chance.

393
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:05,473
And he let Arepo walk free.

394
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:07,575
If you'd actually met Arepo
as you claimed,

395
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:10,311
you'd understand
he no longer walks anywhere.

396
00:31:10,377 --> 00:31:11,545
We spoke on the phone.

397
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:13,781
He can't do that either.

398
00:31:13,848 --> 00:31:15,951
- Where's the drawing?
- Why?

399
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:17,485
Get me an introduction.

400
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:19,187
I'll take the drawing
out of the equation.

401
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:22,623
No picture, no prosecution,
no more hold over you.

402
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,926
I might just be
your second chance.

403
00:31:24,993 --> 00:31:26,861
No, I don't need redemption.

404
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,395
At betrayal.

405
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:35,469
Friends of your husband's?

406
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,872
You knew this was
going to happen?

407
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:40,175
Don't worry,
they won't kill you.

408
00:31:40,242 --> 00:31:43,511
Andrei dislikes tangling with local
law enforcement on that level.

409
00:31:43,577 --> 00:31:45,947
You must've really not liked
the look of me.

410
00:31:46,014 --> 00:31:47,949
The look of you's fine.

411
00:31:48,016 --> 00:31:51,253
It's best to get to the nasty part
before I care one way or the other.

412
00:31:51,318 --> 00:31:52,888
There's a number
in your left coat pocket.

413
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,388
Don't call from home.

414
00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:57,658
You won't be taking my call.

415
00:31:59,426 --> 00:32:02,130
I might surprise you.

416
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:34,662
I ordered my hot sauce
an hour ago.

417
00:32:37,364 --> 00:32:38,766
Can we get going?

418
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:54,149
Please?

419
00:32:54,216 --> 00:32:55,616
He wants you to see.

420
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,912
And he gets what he wants.

421
00:33:30,352 --> 00:33:32,553
Not always, apparently.

422
00:33:38,592 --> 00:33:40,228
<i>Anna says we're going
to Pompeii</i>

423
00:33:40,295 --> 00:33:41,462
and see lava.

424
00:33:41,528 --> 00:33:43,631
We will.
We'll go together.

425
00:33:43,697 --> 00:33:45,599
I'll be there, too!

426
00:34:05,287 --> 00:34:06,854
Told you I'd surprise you.

427
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:09,523
He's a cute kid.

428
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,791
He's everything.

429
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:14,728
Where's the drawing?

430
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:16,932
Oslo. At the airport.

431
00:34:16,998 --> 00:34:18,400
The airport?

432
00:34:18,465 --> 00:34:20,734
Do you know what a Freeport is?

433
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:23,338
<i>A storage facility
for art that was acquired...</i>

434
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:25,506
<i>But not yet taxed.</i>

435
00:34:25,572 --> 00:34:27,708
<i>We started a network.</i>

436
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:31,379
<i>Rotas, this construction company,
built them. I brought in the clients.</i>

437
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,547
<i>The facilities are tax havens.</i>

438
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:36,084
<i>The clients can view their
investments without importing them,</i>

439
00:34:36,151 --> 00:34:38,420
so they avoid paying tax.

440
00:34:38,485 --> 00:34:40,854
It's sorta like
a transit lounge for art?

441
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:42,489
<i>Art, antiquities.</i>

442
00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:44,491
- <i>Anything of value, really.</i>
- <i>Anything?</i>

443
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:46,127
Anything legal.

444
00:34:46,194 --> 00:34:48,363
But it's not unlike
the Swiss banking system.

445
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:51,166
Opaque.

446
00:34:51,232 --> 00:34:54,868
As I'm sure you are aware,
most Freeports are just warehouses.

447
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:57,538
But here we ensure that
you can actually enjoy...

448
00:34:57,604 --> 00:35:00,241
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport.
I'm guessing it's there.

449
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:02,377
And this way to the vaults!

450
00:35:02,444 --> 00:35:04,112
- Guessing?
- Guessing?

451
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:06,547
We make trips there
four, five times a year.

452
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:09,084
- To view art?
- And whatever it is he does.

453
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,585
Turns out art's
of no importance to Andrei.

454
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,487
But the Freeports are.

455
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,992
The structure of the vaults
is based on the Pentagon.

456
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:19,894
Each vault a separate structure
within the others.

457
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:22,730
Damage to one structure
won't compromise the others.

458
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:38,645
Some of our clients opt for
biometric access, straight in...

459
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:41,483
off the tarmac.

460
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:42,816
From the terminal?

461
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,619
From their private planes.

462
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,755
Of course.

463
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:50,524
Our logistics department
ships to and from

464
00:35:50,591 --> 00:35:51,725
any other Freeport in the world

465
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:53,827
without customs inspection.

466
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:55,729
<i>What are you hoping
to find in there?</i>

467
00:35:55,796 --> 00:35:56,898
You really wanna know?

468
00:35:56,965 --> 00:35:58,832
I'm not sure.

469
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,269
Bring some lead-lined gloves.

470
00:36:01,336 --> 00:36:02,736
Jesus.

471
00:36:02,803 --> 00:36:04,205
It's nuclear.

472
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:06,141
When you're on the tour,

473
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,742
<i>pay attention
to the fire precautions.</i>

474
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,146
Documents are
vulnerable to...

475
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,746
Fire? Absolutely!

476
00:36:12,813 --> 00:36:14,848
No, I was going to say water
damage from the sprinkler systems.

477
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:17,018
We don't use sprinklers.

478
00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:19,853
The facility is flooded
with halide gas,

479
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:22,090
displacing all the air
within seconds.

480
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:24,426
Can you show me?

481
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:26,560
If I did, we'd suffocate.

482
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:28,930
What about the staff?

483
00:36:28,997 --> 00:36:30,631
Halide only fills the vaults,

484
00:36:30,697 --> 00:36:32,534
they just have to get
into either corridor,

485
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,601
and there is
a 10-second warning.

486
00:36:34,668 --> 00:36:36,603
At least you give them
10 seconds.

487
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:41,476
Well, sir, our clients
use us because we have no priorities

488
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:43,211
above their property.

489
00:36:43,278 --> 00:36:44,145
Blimey.

490
00:36:44,212 --> 00:36:45,480
All doors are fireproof.

491
00:36:45,547 --> 00:36:48,615
Hydraulic closers, simple key
and electronic triggers.

492
00:36:48,682 --> 00:36:50,518
Surprisingly easy
once there's a lockdown.

493
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,053
Why a lockdown?

494
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,822
Power switches to fail-safes,
sealing the outer doors,

495
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:57,758
but inner doors
revert to factory settings.

496
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,827
And pickable locks.

497
00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:01,262
- Hmm.
- It's child's play, really.

498
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:02,430
Child's play?

499
00:37:02,497 --> 00:37:03,998
They're inside
airport security.

500
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:06,633
They have to worry about climate
control, not armed raids.

501
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,703
So, how do we get enough
firepower through the perimeter

502
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,638
to trigger
the lockdown procedure?

503
00:37:13,074 --> 00:37:14,775
Back wall of the Freeport.

504
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:16,144
You've got something?

505
00:37:16,878 --> 00:37:19,247
Not gonna like it.

506
00:37:19,314 --> 00:37:21,049
You wanna crash a plane?

507
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:23,585
Well, not from the air.
Don't be so dramatic.

508
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,154
I want to run a jet
off the taxiway

509
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:28,856
and breach the rear wall
and start a fire.

510
00:37:30,592 --> 00:37:32,793
Well, how big a plane?

511
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,931
Well, that part
is a little dramatic.

512
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:39,733
This is Mahir.

513
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,902
His team'll work the plane.

514
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,337
There can't be passengers.

515
00:37:42,403 --> 00:37:43,905
Norsk Freight.

516
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,241
They use the hangar on
the west side of the Freeport.

517
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:48,709
You want to crash a transport plane?
What about the crew?

518
00:37:48,775 --> 00:37:50,478
We pop the slides,
chuck 'em off.

519
00:37:50,545 --> 00:37:51,812
On the move?

520
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,680
What's the problem?
They'll be fine.

521
00:37:54,549 --> 00:37:56,151
Well, it seems bold.

522
00:37:56,217 --> 00:37:59,020
Bold I'm fine with. I thought
you were gonna say nuts.

523
00:37:59,087 --> 00:38:00,355
And if you
get caught?

524
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:01,389
We won't.

525
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:03,224
And if you do?

526
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,426
Everyone assumes terrorism,
but no one's died,

527
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:08,695
so swift extradition
then lost in the system.

528
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:10,398
It'll barely make the news.

529
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:12,967
Oh, depends on the size
of your explosion.

530
00:38:13,034 --> 00:38:15,470
Well, actually, the gold bars
might get some play.

531
00:38:15,537 --> 00:38:16,938
Gold bars?

532
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:18,907
Norsk Freight ships Treasury
gold once a month.

533
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:22,343
Blow the back.
Drop it out on the runway.

534
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:26,114
No one will be looking at the building.
I guarantee you.

535
00:38:28,782 --> 00:38:31,286
The space in the
center of the pentagon is too big.

536
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,054
There's something there.

537
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:36,157
Can't figure it out,
it's just not marked.

538
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:38,759
That's 45 seconds.

539
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:39,894
Ample.

540
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:41,329
Won't you be running?

541
00:38:42,997 --> 00:38:44,399
All right, it's your turn.

542
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:45,766
Start packing.

543
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:04,851
Gentlemen, if you
would, through the detector, please.

544
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,191
Sir?

545
00:39:10,258 --> 00:39:11,626
Oh.

546
00:39:11,693 --> 00:39:12,826
And, sir.

547
00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:23,804
I can offer you, perhaps,
a coffee, water?

548
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,540
No,
I'll take an espresso.

549
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:27,408
- Sir?
- No, thank you.

550
00:39:27,475 --> 00:39:29,110
Excellent.

551
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:39,820
Is everybody
on this plane vegetarian?

552
00:39:39,887 --> 00:39:42,090
Because all I got here
is vegetarian.

553
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:46,294
So that looks like meat,

554
00:39:46,361 --> 00:39:48,963
but I think that looks vegetarian.
I think they both look vegetarian.

555
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,366
I don't really know.
It's confusing, ya know?

556
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:53,101
Okay.

557
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:01,842
This way, gentlemen.

558
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:19,994
Gentlemen,
your assigned compartment.

559
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:32,907
Carry on. Not the radio.

560
00:40:39,547 --> 00:40:40,915
Let's go.

561
00:40:56,798 --> 00:40:58,566
Uh...

562
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:12,246
Yoga.

563
00:41:17,118 --> 00:41:19,220
Let's go! Now!

564
00:41:49,684 --> 00:41:50,651
Go, go, go!

565
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,456
Right. Um...

566
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,305
You said 10 seconds, right?

567
00:44:05,386 --> 00:44:07,221
There's
someone in here with us.

568
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,205
- Need a hand?
- Actually, yes.

569
00:44:52,266 --> 00:44:53,467
Don't touch them!

570
00:44:54,201 --> 00:44:55,636
The hell happened here?

571
00:45:01,142 --> 00:45:03,144
It hasn't happened yet.

572
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:23,952
Don't kill him!

573
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:26,620
We need to know
if we've been compromised.

574
00:47:28,756 --> 00:47:30,825
Why are you here?

575
00:47:30,892 --> 00:47:32,994
Who are you?

576
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:34,963
How'd you know we'd be here?

577
00:47:50,377 --> 00:47:52,279
We need to go.

578
00:47:57,219 --> 00:47:59,653
What happened to the other guy?

579
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,990
Took care of him.

580
00:48:16,504 --> 00:48:18,206
Well,
I've seen too much.

581
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:20,909
I'm still alive, which must
mean you've decided to trust me.

582
00:48:20,976 --> 00:48:22,610
Or maybe I lost my edge.

583
00:48:22,676 --> 00:48:24,678
Edge is still intact.

584
00:48:26,413 --> 00:48:28,315
There's a cold war.

585
00:48:28,716 --> 00:48:29,918
Nuclear?

586
00:48:29,985 --> 00:48:31,219
Temporal.

587
00:48:32,486 --> 00:48:33,687
Time travel?

588
00:48:33,754 --> 00:48:34,956
No.

589
00:48:35,023 --> 00:48:37,959
Technology that can invert
an object's entropy.

590
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,861
You mean reverse chronology.

591
00:48:40,929 --> 00:48:43,198
Like Feynman and Wheeler's notion
that a positron is an electron

592
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:44,498
moving backwards in time?

593
00:48:44,565 --> 00:48:46,268
Sure, that's exactly
what I meant.

594
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:47,936
I have a master's in physics.

595
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:49,336
Well, try and keep up.

596
00:48:49,403 --> 00:48:51,039
The implications of this are...

597
00:48:51,106 --> 00:48:52,140
Beyond secret.

598
00:48:52,207 --> 00:48:53,841
Then why'd you bring me in?

599
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:56,310
I thought we'd find a drawing
and a couple boxes of bullets.

600
00:48:56,377 --> 00:48:57,946
Not as surprised as I was.

601
00:48:58,013 --> 00:49:01,849
I'm going back to Mumbai
to get some answers.

602
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:05,452
I'll set you up as a go-between.
But remember, to you...

603
00:49:06,387 --> 00:49:08,789
it's all about plutonium.

604
00:49:08,856 --> 00:49:10,391
And when we're done,
they'll kill you.

605
00:49:10,457 --> 00:49:13,327
Won't you have to
do that anyway?

606
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:15,163
I'd rather it be my decision.

607
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:16,097
So would I.

608
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:18,066
I think.

609
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,979
Your work?

610
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,349
What did you find
in the vaults?

611
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:38,220
Two antagonists. One inverted.

612
00:49:38,286 --> 00:49:42,324
We took out the regular one,
but the inverted one got away.

613
00:49:42,389 --> 00:49:43,925
Both emerged
at the same moment?

614
00:49:43,992 --> 00:49:45,492
Yeah.

615
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:46,861
They were the same person.

616
00:49:48,129 --> 00:49:50,265
Sator's built a turnstile
in that vault.

617
00:49:50,332 --> 00:49:51,599
Turnstile?

618
00:49:51,665 --> 00:49:54,035
A machine for inverting.

619
00:49:54,102 --> 00:49:57,072
You've told me that technology
hasn't been invented yet.

620
00:49:57,138 --> 00:49:58,306
It hasn't.

621
00:49:58,372 --> 00:49:59,673
He's been given it
by the future.

622
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,142
For what?

623
00:50:01,209 --> 00:50:03,744
You have the best chance of
finding out.

624
00:50:05,313 --> 00:50:06,680
- <i>Have you met him?</i>
- <i>I was close.</i>

625
00:50:06,747 --> 00:50:09,117
What if you have
something he needs?

626
00:50:09,184 --> 00:50:10,551
Such as?

627
00:50:10,618 --> 00:50:12,786
Plutonium-241.

628
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:16,157
Sator tried to lift the only
loose 241 from under a CIA team

629
00:50:16,224 --> 00:50:18,792
at the opera siege in Kiev.

630
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:20,228
He got the team.

631
00:50:20,295 --> 00:50:21,395
Not the 241.

632
00:50:21,462 --> 00:50:22,429
Who did?

633
00:50:22,496 --> 00:50:24,698
Ukrainian Security Services.

634
00:50:24,765 --> 00:50:27,035
It's moving to Tallinn
in a week.

635
00:50:27,102 --> 00:50:30,171
Helping an arms dealer steal
weapons-grade plutonium

636
00:50:30,238 --> 00:50:32,706
is unacceptable, Priya.

637
00:50:32,773 --> 00:50:34,276
I'm just gonna take him out.

638
00:50:34,342 --> 00:50:36,410
No, no, no.
Sator has to stay alive.

639
00:50:36,477 --> 00:50:39,446
He has to stay alive until
we know his part in things.

640
00:50:39,513 --> 00:50:40,916
Leverage the situation,

641
00:50:40,982 --> 00:50:43,251
without losing control
of the 241.

642
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:44,886
It's too dangerous.

643
00:50:44,953 --> 00:50:47,122
A terrorist's bomb,
even one that can kill billions,

644
00:50:47,188 --> 00:50:50,158
is nothing compared with what will
happen if we don't stop Sator.

645
00:50:50,225 --> 00:50:51,759
From doing what?

646
00:50:51,825 --> 00:50:55,729
We are being attacked
by the future.

647
00:50:56,898 --> 00:50:59,968
And Sator's helping.
You have to find out how.

648
00:51:15,783 --> 00:51:18,086
I saw the news from Oslo.
Do you have the drawing?

649
00:51:18,153 --> 00:51:20,155
You don't have to worry
about it anymore.

650
00:51:20,221 --> 00:51:22,123
You destroyed it?

651
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,292
I didn't think
you'd want it back.

652
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:25,393
Does he know?

653
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:27,062
Not yet. So sit tight.

654
00:51:27,128 --> 00:51:28,897
Sit tight?

655
00:51:28,964 --> 00:51:31,032
Every day my son spends with that
monster, he thinks a little less of me.

656
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:32,200
It won't be long.

657
00:51:32,267 --> 00:51:34,903
In the meantime, introduce me.

658
00:51:35,403 --> 00:51:37,172
As what?

659
00:51:37,238 --> 00:51:39,307
I'm a former first secretary from
the American Embassy in Riyadh.

660
00:51:39,374 --> 00:51:41,142
We met at a party last June.

661
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:42,810
We were at a party in Riyadh,
but I don't think it was in June.

662
00:51:42,876 --> 00:51:45,213
It was June 29th. 7:00 or 7:30.

663
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,083
Salmon was on the printed menu.
Swapped for sea bass on the night.

664
00:51:48,149 --> 00:51:49,985
Sator left early.
That's when we met.

665
00:51:50,051 --> 00:51:51,652
I came into Shipley's
in London.

666
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:53,388
You ran into me here

667
00:51:53,455 --> 00:51:54,990
and wanna show me your yacht.

668
00:51:55,056 --> 00:51:57,425
He'll think we're
having an affair.

669
00:51:57,491 --> 00:51:58,559
Then he'll wanna meet me.

670
00:51:58,625 --> 00:51:59,660
Or have you killed.

671
00:51:59,727 --> 00:52:02,197
Let me worry about that.

672
00:52:02,263 --> 00:52:03,864
Did I look worried?

673
00:52:05,433 --> 00:52:06,700
Sleeps 70 with crew.

674
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:09,437
Two helicopters.
Missile defenses.

675
00:52:09,503 --> 00:52:10,972
Afraid of pirates?

676
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:13,574
Andrei lives playing
one government off the other.

677
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,410
The day they turn,
that's his refuge.

678
00:52:15,477 --> 00:52:16,777
May I join you?

679
00:52:16,844 --> 00:52:19,347
Not sure Volkov's taking
passengers just now.

680
00:52:19,414 --> 00:52:21,149
Then we'll take mine.

681
00:52:55,116 --> 00:52:56,117
Max!

682
00:52:57,684 --> 00:52:59,888
Who's the American?

683
00:53:01,189 --> 00:53:02,556
He's a friend.

684
00:53:02,623 --> 00:53:05,460
The man from Shipley's.

685
00:53:05,527 --> 00:53:07,929
Who you tried to have
beaten up.

686
00:53:08,829 --> 00:53:11,332
I ask again, who is he?

687
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:16,570
We met in Riyadh last June
at the American Embassy.

688
00:53:16,637 --> 00:53:19,040
Good with fists for a diplomat.

689
00:53:19,107 --> 00:53:21,176
Paranoia's your department,
Andrei.

690
00:53:21,242 --> 00:53:24,611
He seems nice.
I invited him to the dinner.

691
00:53:24,678 --> 00:53:25,880
Max?

692
00:53:25,947 --> 00:53:29,250
He's visiting Pompeii
and Herculaneum.

693
00:53:29,317 --> 00:53:30,851
You just sent him off?

694
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:33,555
I promised him I'd go with him.

695
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,823
I explained you were busy.

696
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:39,726
With your friend.

697
00:54:00,647 --> 00:54:02,616
Hey, easy, fella.

698
00:54:02,683 --> 00:54:05,053
Where I'm from,
you buy me dinner first.

699
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:18,066
- Mr. Sator.
- Don't bother.

700
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,970
Just tell me if you've
slept with my wife yet.

701
00:54:22,437 --> 00:54:24,172
Uh... No.

702
00:54:25,173 --> 00:54:26,174
Not yet.

703
00:54:27,475 --> 00:54:29,277
How would you like to die?

704
00:54:30,044 --> 00:54:30,912
Old.

705
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:33,714
You chose the wrong profession.

706
00:54:35,216 --> 00:54:37,152
There's a walled garden
up the road.

707
00:54:37,218 --> 00:54:39,686
We are going to take you there,
cut your throat.

708
00:54:39,753 --> 00:54:42,957
Not across. In the middle,
like a hole.

709
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:45,792
Then we take your balls
and we stuff them in the cut,

710
00:54:45,859 --> 00:54:47,428
block the windpipe.

711
00:54:48,096 --> 00:54:49,364
Complex.

712
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:51,765
It's very gratifying
to watch a man you don't like

713
00:54:51,832 --> 00:54:55,937
try to pull his own balls out
of his throat before he chokes.

714
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:57,639
Is this how you treat
all your guests?

715
00:54:57,704 --> 00:54:59,274
We're finished.

716
00:55:03,311 --> 00:55:04,312
Do you like opera?

717
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:12,353
Well?

718
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,787
Not here.

719
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:17,959
You sail?

720
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:19,561
I've messed around on boats.

721
00:55:19,627 --> 00:55:22,430
Be on the dock at 8:00 ready to
do more than mess around.

722
00:55:23,064 --> 00:55:24,065
8:00 a.m.

723
00:55:38,379 --> 00:55:40,847
<i>Max has missed
too much school this year.</i>

724
00:55:40,915 --> 00:55:42,550
I'm taking him back to England.

725
00:55:42,617 --> 00:55:43,885
The school won't be okay with
him missing so much of the term.

726
00:55:43,952 --> 00:55:46,820
- Yes, they will.
- Can I finish?

727
00:55:46,888 --> 00:55:48,690
You have all the trappings
of a king.

728
00:55:48,755 --> 00:55:51,326
We both know you're a grubby
little man playing power games

729
00:55:51,392 --> 00:55:53,428
with a wife who
doesn't love you anymore.

730
00:55:54,629 --> 00:55:56,164
You seem...

731
00:55:57,265 --> 00:55:59,100
spirited today.

732
00:56:00,635 --> 00:56:03,137
- Do I?
- Yes, you do.

733
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:11,512
Were you worried
it had been destroyed?

734
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:15,917
Rest assured, instinct told me
to remove it from the vault.

735
00:56:15,984 --> 00:56:18,519
I've always had instincts
about the future.

736
00:56:20,121 --> 00:56:23,358
That's how I built this life
you no longer value.

737
00:56:38,506 --> 00:56:40,241
Sailing or diving?

738
00:56:57,392 --> 00:56:58,893
Rising!

739
00:57:23,217 --> 00:57:25,852
What do you know about opera?

740
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,023
In 2008, a remote
Russian missile station

741
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:31,825
was overwhelmed
and held for a week.

742
00:57:31,893 --> 00:57:33,561
When the station was retaken,

743
00:57:33,628 --> 00:57:37,565
241 on one warhead was three
quarters of a kilo lighter.

744
00:57:41,636 --> 00:57:43,504
The missing 241

745
00:57:43,571 --> 00:57:46,774
surfaced at the opera house
siege in Kiev on the 14th.

746
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,842
Coming about!

747
00:58:06,694 --> 00:58:09,063
What do you propose?

748
00:58:09,831 --> 00:58:10,832
Partnership.

749
00:58:10,898 --> 00:58:12,767
I wouldn't partner with you.

750
00:58:12,834 --> 00:58:17,105
You can take care of yourself.
You have no record.

751
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:19,307
Someone in the arms trade,
with training,

752
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:21,109
who knows how to
cover his tracks.

753
00:58:21,175 --> 00:58:22,510
Not that shocking.

754
00:58:22,577 --> 00:58:24,846
For an intelligence agent.

755
00:58:24,912 --> 00:58:26,948
Right!

756
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,085
Burn in hell, Andrei.

757
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:40,128
You can't jibe
a boat like this!

758
00:58:40,194 --> 00:58:41,596
You can if you have to.

759
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:11,359
- Kat...
- Why didn't you let him drown?

760
00:59:11,426 --> 00:59:12,927
I need him.

761
00:59:12,994 --> 00:59:14,095
What, to sell guns?

762
00:59:14,162 --> 00:59:15,430
I'm not who you think I am.

763
00:59:15,496 --> 00:59:16,631
Well, that I know.

764
00:59:16,697 --> 00:59:19,233
He showed me the drawing.

765
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,669
I'm sorry.
I had to get close to him.

766
00:59:21,736 --> 00:59:23,838
I don't know what you think
your husband does...

767
00:59:23,906 --> 00:59:26,574
Oh, we both know
he's an arms dealer.

768
00:59:26,641 --> 00:59:28,042
He's so much more.

769
00:59:28,109 --> 00:59:29,944
What, then?

770
00:59:30,011 --> 00:59:33,147
Andrei Sator holds all of our
lives in his hands, not just yours.

771
00:59:41,088 --> 00:59:42,790
Mr. Sator wants to see you.

772
00:59:42,857 --> 00:59:43,724
Okay.

773
00:59:44,492 --> 00:59:46,327
Now.

774
00:59:46,394 --> 00:59:48,596
Uh, he wants to see me
without pants?

775
00:59:54,669 --> 00:59:56,304
- Trust me.
- Save it.

776
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,639
I'm not falling for it twice.

777
01:00:00,842 --> 01:00:02,310
You have a better option?

778
01:00:05,112 --> 01:00:07,081
Whatever it takes
to get what you want.

779
01:00:07,148 --> 01:00:09,750
Not a second's thought
for me or my son.

780
01:00:14,255 --> 01:00:16,557
What do you think
he's gonna do to me now?

781
01:00:28,035 --> 01:00:29,570
Try not to use it.

782
01:00:31,572 --> 01:00:33,441
On anyone.

783
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:40,081
Enough.

784
01:00:43,484 --> 01:00:46,521
See? Pulse of a man
half my age.

785
01:00:49,724 --> 01:00:51,425
Drink with me.

786
01:00:53,261 --> 01:00:55,696
It seems I now owe you my life.

787
01:00:55,763 --> 01:00:56,831
It's nothing.

788
01:00:56,899 --> 01:00:58,934
My life is not nothing.

789
01:00:59,001 --> 01:01:01,636
And I don't like to be in debt.

790
01:01:01,702 --> 01:01:03,404
Then pay me.

791
01:01:03,471 --> 01:01:05,706
No retribution
against your wife.

792
01:01:09,011 --> 01:01:11,412
You think she released
my harness?

793
01:01:14,782 --> 01:01:17,084
It was my own mistake.

794
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:19,153
Then help me steal the 241.

795
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,489
I need resources.
It's weapons-grade plutonium.

796
01:01:21,556 --> 01:01:23,624
That means special handling,
containment facilities...

797
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:25,226
I know what it means.

798
01:01:27,295 --> 01:01:30,498
You lecture me about radiation?

799
01:01:31,299 --> 01:01:33,134
Andrei Sator,

800
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,072
digging plutonium from the
rubble of my city as a teenager.

801
01:01:38,139 --> 01:01:39,206
Where?

802
01:01:41,842 --> 01:01:43,778
<i>Stalsk-12.</i>

803
01:01:45,179 --> 01:01:46,380
<i>My home.</i>

804
01:01:49,116 --> 01:01:53,654
One part of a warhead exploded at
ground level, scattering the others.

805
01:01:55,289 --> 01:01:58,092
They needed people
to find the plutonium.

806
01:02:00,028 --> 01:02:01,997
It became my first contract.

807
01:02:02,064 --> 01:02:05,366
<i>Nobody else even bid.
They thought it was a death sentence.</i>

808
01:02:08,202 --> 01:02:09,403
But...

809
01:02:10,906 --> 01:02:13,874
<i>one man's probability
of death...</i>

810
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:20,147
...is another man's possibility
for a life.

811
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:25,720
<i>I staked my claim
in the new Russia.</i>

812
01:02:25,786 --> 01:02:30,591
Even now, my company is the only
one to operate in the ruins.

813
01:02:30,658 --> 01:02:33,728
The 241 is being transported
through northern Europe,

814
01:02:33,794 --> 01:02:39,233
on its way to the long-term
nuclear storage depot in Trieste.

815
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,669
I'm told you have resources
in Tallinn.

816
01:02:46,374 --> 01:02:48,776
Stay with us tonight.

817
01:02:48,843 --> 01:02:50,544
I insist.

818
01:03:17,906 --> 01:03:19,074
What do you want?

819
01:03:19,141 --> 01:03:21,342
We're going to talk
about today.

820
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:23,177
No, we're not.

821
01:03:23,244 --> 01:03:24,445
No?

822
01:03:26,247 --> 01:03:27,648
We'll see.

823
01:03:27,715 --> 01:03:29,350
Don't think for a second
you can treat me

824
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:31,485
like you treat
your other women.

825
01:03:33,354 --> 01:03:35,489
And, uh...

826
01:03:36,357 --> 01:03:39,260
how do you imagine...

827
01:03:39,326 --> 01:03:40,761
I treat these other women, huh?

828
01:03:40,828 --> 01:03:43,464
You think I force them
into conversation?

829
01:03:43,531 --> 01:03:45,100
You wanna be quiet, fine.

830
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:46,867
You can bite down on that.

831
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:53,507
Even a soul as blank and brittle
as yours needs a response.

832
01:03:54,742 --> 01:03:57,045
Is fear and pain
enough, Andrei?

833
01:03:57,112 --> 01:03:58,345
That's all I have to offer you.

834
01:03:58,412 --> 01:04:00,082
Well, that will
have to do, then.

835
01:04:00,148 --> 01:04:02,918
Why didn't you just let me go?

836
01:04:02,984 --> 01:04:04,986
Because...

837
01:04:06,988 --> 01:04:11,692
if I can't have you...

838
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:16,797
no one else can.

839
01:04:16,864 --> 01:04:19,734
And if you touch me,
I scream so loud he hears.

840
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,702
You think I let him interfere?

841
01:04:21,769 --> 01:04:24,638
If he tried,
you'd have to kill him.

842
01:04:24,705 --> 01:04:25,740
End of deal.

843
01:04:27,308 --> 01:04:29,710
So you leave me alone.

844
01:04:31,245 --> 01:04:33,247
Not now!

845
01:06:52,853 --> 01:06:57,125
Ninety-eight.
Not bad for such exertion.

846
01:07:07,768 --> 01:07:09,905
He was at the window.

847
01:07:11,538 --> 01:07:12,908
I was curious.

848
01:07:14,009 --> 01:07:17,178
My property
shouldn't concern you.

849
01:07:17,245 --> 01:07:18,779
Who are you?

850
01:07:18,846 --> 01:07:20,848
How do you come by your
information about the opera?

851
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:25,320
You wouldn't do business with someone
who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.

852
01:07:25,387 --> 01:07:28,856
Hell, the CIA provides two thirds
of the market for fissile material.

853
01:07:28,924 --> 01:07:32,493
They're usually buying,
not selling.

854
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,297
But we do live
in a twilight world.

855
01:07:35,363 --> 01:07:36,898
Is that Whitman? Pretty.

856
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:38,934
Next warning's a bullet
in the brain.

857
01:07:41,336 --> 01:07:43,604
No balls in my throat?

858
01:07:43,671 --> 01:07:46,274
There will be no time
for such things...

859
01:07:46,341 --> 01:07:47,841
in Tallinn.

860
01:07:47,909 --> 01:07:51,880
You make your way there.
I want Volkov on your team.

861
01:07:51,947 --> 01:07:53,148
No.

862
01:07:55,984 --> 01:07:59,653
I spring the material.
You pay me off.

863
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,455
Your wife does the exchange.

864
01:08:01,522 --> 01:08:02,790
I never involve her
in my business.

865
01:08:02,856 --> 01:08:05,093
Yeah, that's why I trust her.

866
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,895
Put him ashore.

867
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:08,363
How do I
contact you?

868
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:09,596
You don't.

869
01:08:09,663 --> 01:08:11,166
How do you advance me
the funds?

870
01:08:14,868 --> 01:08:18,073
Handle the plutonium
better than that.

871
01:08:28,016 --> 01:08:29,516
<i>What did you find on the gold?</i>

872
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:31,419
<i>No franks,
no mold marks. Nothing.</i>

873
01:08:31,485 --> 01:08:33,821
- How?
- Dead drops.

874
01:08:33,888 --> 01:08:36,958
He buries his time capsule,
transmits the location,

875
01:08:37,025 --> 01:08:40,594
then digs it up to collect the
inverted materials they sent.

876
01:08:40,661 --> 01:08:43,597
Seemingly instantaneous.
Where's he bury it?

877
01:08:43,664 --> 01:08:46,700
Some place that won't be
discovered for centuries.

878
01:08:46,767 --> 01:08:48,836
What did the soil samples show?

879
01:08:48,903 --> 01:08:51,239
Northern Europe, Asia.

880
01:08:51,306 --> 01:08:52,773
<i>Radioactive.</i>

881
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,676
Everything salvaged from Oslo's
been shipped here.

882
01:08:56,378 --> 01:08:57,745
Why am I here?

883
01:08:57,811 --> 01:09:01,216
I don't trust anyone else
to assess the pieces.

884
01:09:01,282 --> 01:09:03,952
<i>Via convoy through
downtown, what's the thinking?</i>

885
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:06,888
Crowded. Unpredictable
traffic patterns.

886
01:09:06,955 --> 01:09:09,290
It's almost impossible
to plan an ambush.

887
01:09:09,357 --> 01:09:11,558
They have a point.

888
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:13,128
Is the convoy monitored
from the air?

889
01:09:13,194 --> 01:09:16,864
Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn,
in come the cavalry.

890
01:09:16,931 --> 01:09:18,233
<i>We need big guns.</i>

891
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:20,502
Guns that make the point
without being fired.

892
01:09:20,601 --> 01:09:24,139
We need a fast car that doesn't
look fast. Four heavy vehicles.

893
01:09:24,205 --> 01:09:25,773
All different.

894
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:28,809
Bus, coach, 18-wheeler.
One of them has to be a fire truck.

895
01:09:28,876 --> 01:09:32,180
Most of all, we have to set this
up with nothing in the record.

896
01:09:32,247 --> 01:09:34,215
Nothing electronic,
nothing paper.

897
01:09:34,282 --> 01:09:38,652
I don't want Sator ambushing us
once we spring the material.

898
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,755
His ignorance is our only
protection.

899
01:10:18,893 --> 01:10:20,295
You see, Kat?

900
01:10:21,262 --> 01:10:23,664
Some of my favorites.

901
01:10:24,899 --> 01:10:29,636
Singed but, uh, salvageable,
wouldn't you say?

902
01:10:29,703 --> 01:10:32,373
- That's not my area of expertise.
- Ah, that's right.

903
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:36,810
You would never have anything
to do with such things.

904
01:10:36,877 --> 01:10:39,514
But this is where
our worlds collide.

905
01:10:39,581 --> 01:10:41,116
What is this, Andrei?

906
01:10:41,182 --> 01:10:44,385
You know perfectly well
what it is, Kat.

907
01:10:47,222 --> 01:10:49,023
The filthy business

908
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:52,393
that put those clothes on your
back and our boy in his school,

909
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,996
that you thought you could
negotiate your way around.

910
01:11:04,771 --> 01:11:06,074
Time to go.

911
01:11:06,141 --> 01:11:07,674
I'm not going anywhere
with him.

912
01:11:07,741 --> 01:11:08,876
Look at me!

913
01:11:10,411 --> 01:11:12,614
And understand,

914
01:11:12,679 --> 01:11:15,183
you don't negotiate
with a tiger.

915
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:19,320
You admire a tiger
until he turns on you

916
01:11:19,387 --> 01:11:23,757
and you feel its true
fucking nature!

917
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:25,759
Don't.

918
01:11:26,594 --> 01:11:28,829
You stay right there.

919
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,602
Green. Two minutes.

920
01:11:58,226 --> 01:11:59,527
You are not going to kill me.

921
01:11:59,594 --> 01:12:01,462
I already tried.

922
01:12:01,529 --> 01:12:02,897
You pushed me off a boat.

923
01:12:02,964 --> 01:12:04,966
You are not going to shoot me
in cold blood.

924
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:07,335
My blood's not cold, Andrei.

925
01:12:07,402 --> 01:12:10,871
No, but you're not
angry enough.

926
01:12:12,307 --> 01:12:16,010
Because anger scars over
into despair.

927
01:12:17,878 --> 01:12:20,248
I look in your eyes...

928
01:12:21,649 --> 01:12:23,351
I see despair.

929
01:12:27,155 --> 01:12:30,458
Vengeful bitch! Living off me!

930
01:12:30,525 --> 01:12:32,193
Thinking that you're better!

931
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:33,328
Enough!

932
01:12:57,751 --> 01:13:00,421
Tell me everything
as it happens.

933
01:13:02,724 --> 01:13:04,791
Seal me this side.

934
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:24,379
Yellow, 60 seconds.

935
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:26,080
60. Check.

936
01:13:40,695 --> 01:13:43,464
Blue, 45 seconds.

937
01:13:43,531 --> 01:13:45,233
Blue, 45, check.

938
01:14:01,683 --> 01:14:04,185
Okay, Red.
Coming to you.

939
01:14:19,233 --> 01:14:22,136
Watch everything.
Give me all the details.

940
01:15:07,181 --> 01:15:08,616
All right, everyone set?

941
01:15:14,489 --> 01:15:16,491
And five...

942
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:18,926
four...

943
01:15:19,694 --> 01:15:20,661
three...

944
01:15:21,763 --> 01:15:22,964
two...

945
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:26,100
<i>one.</i>

946
01:15:48,656 --> 01:15:49,690
Go, Yellow!

947
01:15:53,461 --> 01:15:54,829
We got a problem!

948
01:15:54,897 --> 01:15:57,698
Backup, we need backup! Shit!

949
01:18:04,091 --> 01:18:06,093
Check the
radio chatter.

950
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:25,279
I've seen samples of
encapsulation in every weapons class.

951
01:18:25,346 --> 01:18:26,949
This is not one of them.

952
01:18:27,015 --> 01:18:28,683
That's what he's after.

953
01:18:32,286 --> 01:18:33,487
Can't understand this.

954
01:18:33,554 --> 01:18:35,156
You said you spoke Estonian.

955
01:18:35,222 --> 01:18:36,824
It's not Estonian.

956
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:38,159
It's backwards.

957
01:18:43,297 --> 01:18:44,699
The hell is that?

958
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:01,415
Go, go, go!

959
01:19:47,828 --> 01:19:49,830
Don't give it to him.

960
01:19:49,898 --> 01:19:51,099
This isn't plutonium.

961
01:19:51,165 --> 01:19:52,533
It's worse than that,
God damn it!

962
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:12,386
Sorry.

963
01:20:28,335 --> 01:20:29,503
He's getting away.

964
01:20:31,305 --> 01:20:32,473
He left her
in the car!

965
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,976
Go after her, go! Go, go, go!

966
01:20:48,355 --> 01:20:49,724
Pull up alongside!

967
01:21:05,339 --> 01:21:07,808
Come on, come on. Closer!

968
01:21:11,512 --> 01:21:13,314
Keep it steady, keep it steady!

969
01:21:15,217 --> 01:21:16,885
Hurry up!

970
01:21:18,285 --> 01:21:19,620
Please!

971
01:21:55,656 --> 01:21:58,526
All right, sit tight.
I'm calling the cavalry.

972
01:21:59,293 --> 01:22:00,728
What cavalry?

973
01:23:04,825 --> 01:23:07,095
If you are not telling
the truth, she dies.

974
01:23:09,663 --> 01:23:11,132
I don't know what you're
talkin' about.

975
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,534
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

976
01:23:15,603 --> 01:23:17,239
- Who told you that?
- Just tell me now,

977
01:23:17,305 --> 01:23:18,572
is it really in the BMW?

978
01:23:19,975 --> 01:23:20,942
I don't know.

979
01:23:21,009 --> 01:23:22,376
Tell me or
I'll shoot her again!

980
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:25,347
Leave her alone!

981
01:23:25,412 --> 01:23:26,780
Kill him!

982
01:23:26,847 --> 01:23:28,716
I don't have time
to negotiate.

983
01:23:34,421 --> 01:23:35,556
- Listen to me!
- Three.

984
01:23:35,623 --> 01:23:36,624
I can help you.

985
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:38,126
- Help me!
- Two.

986
01:23:38,193 --> 01:23:39,227
Please!

987
01:23:39,294 --> 01:23:40,527
- Don't!
- One.

988
01:23:44,698 --> 01:23:46,334
Next one's a bullet
to the head.

989
01:23:48,036 --> 01:23:49,503
- No!
- One.

990
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:51,273
Two. Three.

991
01:23:51,339 --> 01:23:52,673
Okay! Okay.

992
01:23:53,341 --> 01:23:55,542
The car. The BMW.

993
01:23:55,609 --> 01:23:56,945
I left it in the BMW.

994
01:23:57,012 --> 01:23:58,179
We're going to check
this is real.

995
01:24:00,781 --> 01:24:02,850
It's in the glove box!

996
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:04,920
Where did you leave it?

997
01:24:05,753 --> 01:24:07,721
Car or fire truck, which one?

998
01:24:07,788 --> 01:24:10,491
Which vehicle did you leave it in?
I need to know before I go out there.

999
01:24:10,557 --> 01:24:11,659
I already told you.

1000
01:24:12,726 --> 01:24:14,195
I believe you.

1001
01:24:14,262 --> 01:24:16,463
You wanted her here,
I hope you'll be happy...

1002
01:24:28,977 --> 01:24:30,444
Clear!

1003
01:24:30,511 --> 01:24:32,213
Wheeler, go check
the other side.

1004
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:33,547
You two.

1005
01:24:33,614 --> 01:24:34,883
Where did he go?

1006
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:35,951
The past.

1007
01:24:58,907 --> 01:25:00,275
It's in
the glove box!

1008
01:25:00,342 --> 01:25:03,278
We're going to check
this is real.

1009
01:25:05,914 --> 01:25:08,416
- Three, two, one.
- Okay, okay...

1010
01:25:08,482 --> 01:25:10,285
Next one's a bullet to the head.

1011
01:25:11,652 --> 01:25:13,922
- No! No!
- One.

1012
01:25:13,989 --> 01:25:15,924
- Listen to me.
- Two.

1013
01:25:15,991 --> 01:25:17,092
Three.

1014
01:25:17,158 --> 01:25:18,759
I can help you.

1015
01:25:18,826 --> 01:25:20,861
I don't have time to negotiate.

1016
01:25:20,929 --> 01:25:22,263
Tell me
or I'll shoot her again.

1017
01:25:23,932 --> 01:25:25,200
- Leave her alone!
- Tell me now,

1018
01:25:25,266 --> 01:25:26,500
is it really in the BMW?

1019
01:25:26,567 --> 01:25:28,036
I don't know.

1020
01:25:28,103 --> 01:25:30,537
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

1021
01:25:30,604 --> 01:25:32,173
Who told you that?

1022
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,242
If you're not telling
the truth, she dies.

1023
01:25:34,309 --> 01:25:36,510
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1024
01:25:48,622 --> 01:25:50,058
- Medic!
- Check in.

1025
01:25:51,426 --> 01:25:53,128
She's been shot?

1026
01:25:53,194 --> 01:25:55,063
Bring her back,
this side.

1027
01:25:56,498 --> 01:25:58,199
Was she shot with
an inverted round?

1028
01:26:03,604 --> 01:26:05,773
This is Ives. He's one of us.

1029
01:26:07,242 --> 01:26:09,210
"Us"! Who are these guys?

1030
01:26:09,277 --> 01:26:11,413
Priya's. Ours.

1031
01:26:11,479 --> 01:26:13,148
How did Sator know
about the ambush?

1032
01:26:13,214 --> 01:26:14,848
It's posterity.

1033
01:26:14,916 --> 01:26:16,918
An ambush in the middle of the
street can't stay out of the records.

1034
01:26:16,985 --> 01:26:20,221
Bullshit! He knew every move
we made! Every one of 'em.

1035
01:26:20,288 --> 01:26:21,523
Somebody talked. Who was it?

1036
01:26:21,588 --> 01:26:23,590
- Was it you?
- No. No.

1037
01:26:23,657 --> 01:26:25,726
At every stage,
you've known too much.

1038
01:26:25,793 --> 01:26:28,762
I'm going to ask you again.

1039
01:26:29,497 --> 01:26:31,698
Did you talk?

1040
01:26:33,234 --> 01:26:34,735
Nobody talked.

1041
01:26:34,802 --> 01:26:37,238
They're running
a temporal pincer movement.

1042
01:26:37,972 --> 01:26:39,174
A what?

1043
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:43,445
The pincer movement.
But not in space, in time.

1044
01:26:43,511 --> 01:26:45,547
Half his team moves forward
through the event.

1045
01:26:45,612 --> 01:26:48,849
He monitors them, and then attacks
at the end moving backwards,

1046
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:50,485
knowing everything.

1047
01:26:50,552 --> 01:26:52,586
Except for where
I stashed the plutonium.

1048
01:26:52,653 --> 01:26:54,255
Which isn't really plutonium,
is it?

1049
01:26:54,322 --> 01:26:55,823
I told you
it was what he was after.

1050
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:58,592
And you just told him
where it was.

1051
01:26:59,327 --> 01:27:01,595
I lied.

1052
01:27:01,662 --> 01:27:04,466
Jesus.
You lied about it?

1053
01:27:04,532 --> 01:27:08,970
He couldn't verify inside the room.
He'd have shot her anyway.

1054
01:27:09,037 --> 01:27:11,506
Lying is standard
operating procedure.

1055
01:27:11,573 --> 01:27:12,773
It's spread too far.

1056
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:13,841
Meaning what?

1057
01:27:13,908 --> 01:27:15,176
She's gonna die.

1058
01:27:15,243 --> 01:27:16,945
Standard
operating procedure.

1059
01:27:17,011 --> 01:27:18,846
Can't you help her?
Can we do something?

1060
01:27:18,913 --> 01:27:21,849
Can't we stabilize the inverse
radiation by inverting the patient?

1061
01:27:21,916 --> 01:27:23,051
Takes days.

1062
01:27:23,118 --> 01:27:24,818
Let's go.

1063
01:27:24,886 --> 01:27:27,222
We took control of this machine
minutes ago. Before that, it's Sator's.

1064
01:27:27,288 --> 01:27:29,591
How long is she gonna live
on this side?

1065
01:27:29,656 --> 01:27:31,326
Three hours, tops.

1066
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:32,860
I'm taking her through.

1067
01:27:32,927 --> 01:27:35,063
I'm not gonna let her die.
I'll take my chances.

1068
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:37,764
There's no way of
bringing you back.

1069
01:27:37,831 --> 01:27:39,167
We find another machine.

1070
01:27:39,234 --> 01:27:40,767
A week ago? Where?

1071
01:27:42,669 --> 01:27:44,139
Oslo.

1072
01:27:44,205 --> 01:27:46,773
That facility's inside
an airport security perimeter.

1073
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,610
It's impregnable.

1074
01:27:48,675 --> 01:27:50,744
Mmm... It wasn't last week.

1075
01:27:50,811 --> 01:27:52,347
We're going in.

1076
01:27:52,413 --> 01:27:53,680
You might as well help us.

1077
01:27:54,848 --> 01:27:56,050
This is a proving window.

1078
01:27:56,117 --> 01:27:57,485
As you approach the turnstile,

1079
01:27:57,552 --> 01:27:59,387
if you don't see yourself
in the proving window,

1080
01:27:59,454 --> 01:28:00,555
do not enter the machine.

1081
01:28:00,622 --> 01:28:02,023
Why not?

1082
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:03,424
If you don't see yourself
reverse-exit a machine,

1083
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:04,559
then you ain't getting out.

1084
01:28:04,626 --> 01:28:07,195
- Is that gonna work?
- Yeah.

1085
01:28:07,262 --> 01:28:08,997
See for yourself.

1086
01:28:09,063 --> 01:28:11,132
There's your answer. Let's go.

1087
01:28:35,756 --> 01:28:37,125
She's stabilizing
slowly.

1088
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:38,792
I'll clean and close,
but the rest is time.

1089
01:28:38,859 --> 01:28:40,161
How long does she need?

1090
01:28:40,228 --> 01:28:43,797
Four, five days.
A week to be sure.

1091
01:28:43,864 --> 01:28:45,466
Hey, Neil. Find a way
to get us to Oslo.

1092
01:28:45,533 --> 01:28:46,733
I'm going back out there.

1093
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:50,505
To do what?

1094
01:28:50,572 --> 01:28:52,407
To stop Sator from getting away
with whatever it is I just gave him.

1095
01:28:52,473 --> 01:28:54,775
You didn't. You lied
about where it was.

1096
01:28:54,841 --> 01:28:56,544
Wait.

1097
01:28:56,611 --> 01:28:57,912
You're going out there for her.

1098
01:28:57,979 --> 01:28:59,647
He threatened to kill her
in the past.

1099
01:28:59,713 --> 01:29:01,549
If he does,
what happens to her here?

1100
01:29:02,816 --> 01:29:04,718
That's unknowable.

1101
01:29:04,785 --> 01:29:06,988
If you're there to make a change,
you're not here to observe its effect.

1102
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:08,556
What do you believe?

1103
01:29:08,623 --> 01:29:10,791
What's happened's happened.

1104
01:29:10,857 --> 01:29:13,561
We need to save her,
here and now.

1105
01:29:13,628 --> 01:29:17,332
If you go back out there, you might
hand him exactly what he's after.

1106
01:29:17,398 --> 01:29:19,667
Don't let them
take her back through there.

1107
01:29:19,733 --> 01:29:20,602
Okay?

1108
01:29:20,668 --> 01:29:22,337
We can't stay here.

1109
01:29:23,271 --> 01:29:24,939
We don't have a lot of time.

1110
01:29:25,006 --> 01:29:28,076
So why don't you find us
a nice, cozy shipping container

1111
01:29:28,142 --> 01:29:30,478
that's just come off a ship
from Oslo?

1112
01:29:30,545 --> 01:29:32,013
This is cowboy shit.

1113
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,548
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into

1114
01:29:33,615 --> 01:29:34,949
if you go through that door.

1115
01:29:35,016 --> 01:29:36,783
Well, I'm going,
so any tips would be welcome.

1116
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:38,653
Wheeler, brief him.

1117
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,521
You'll need your own air.

1118
01:29:40,588 --> 01:29:43,625
Regular air won't pass through
the membranes of inverted lungs.

1119
01:29:43,691 --> 01:29:45,126
Number one rule:

1120
01:29:45,193 --> 01:29:47,395
don't come into contact
with your forward self.

1121
01:29:47,462 --> 01:29:50,331
It's the whole point of these
barriers and protective suits.

1122
01:29:50,398 --> 01:29:51,599
We don't have time.

1123
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:54,168
Well, if your particles
come into contact...

1124
01:29:54,235 --> 01:29:55,236
What?

1125
01:29:55,303 --> 01:29:56,337
Annihilation.

1126
01:29:56,404 --> 01:29:58,006
That would be bad, right?

1127
01:29:58,072 --> 01:30:02,076
When you exit the air lock,
take a moment to orient yourself.

1128
01:30:02,143 --> 01:30:04,445
Things will feel strange.

1129
01:30:04,512 --> 01:30:06,547
When you run,
the wind will be at your back.

1130
01:30:06,614 --> 01:30:09,917
You encounter fire,
ice will form on your clothes

1131
01:30:09,984 --> 01:30:11,785
as the transfer of heat
is reversed.

1132
01:30:11,852 --> 01:30:16,624
Gravity will feel normal but appear
reversed for the world around you.

1133
01:30:16,691 --> 01:30:19,494
You may experience distortions
in your vision and hearing.

1134
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,861
This is normal.

1135
01:30:20,928 --> 01:30:22,497
- Can I drive a car?
- Cowboy shit.

1136
01:30:22,563 --> 01:30:24,198
I can't vouch
for the handling.

1137
01:30:24,265 --> 01:30:26,668
Friction and wind resistance
are reversed.

1138
01:30:26,734 --> 01:30:28,869
You are inverted.
The world is not.

1139
01:30:28,936 --> 01:30:30,705
Was the transponder
on the case?

1140
01:30:30,772 --> 01:30:32,373
We've tossed that case.

1141
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:35,076
I'm moving backwards.
It's the ball I have to follow.

1142
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:37,078
Give me the reader.

1143
01:30:40,948 --> 01:30:42,350
Okay.

1144
01:30:43,184 --> 01:30:44,818
You ready?

1145
01:33:36,324 --> 01:33:39,293
<i>The material's not in the case.</i>

1146
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,497
<i>Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.</i>

1147
01:33:43,164 --> 01:33:44,799
<i>He was lying.</i>

1148
01:33:44,866 --> 01:33:46,701
<i>It wasn't in the BMW.</i>

1149
01:33:46,767 --> 01:33:47,768
<i>So, where is it?</i>

1150
01:34:33,982 --> 01:34:35,984
I saw the handoff.

1151
01:34:36,050 --> 01:34:39,086
You made me shoot her
for nothing.

1152
01:34:39,153 --> 01:34:43,257
You did get my pulse above 130,
no one's done that before.

1153
01:34:43,324 --> 01:34:44,960
Not even my wife.

1154
01:35:14,422 --> 01:35:17,291
You left Ives and his
team a hell of a cleanup.

1155
01:35:18,326 --> 01:35:21,162
Heat transfer was reversed.

1156
01:35:21,228 --> 01:35:23,065
You might be
the first case of hypothermia

1157
01:35:23,130 --> 01:35:25,266
from a gasoline explosion
in history.

1158
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:28,269
At this point,
nothing surprises.

1159
01:35:29,804 --> 01:35:30,973
We're headed back to Oslo?

1160
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:33,174
In a Rotas shipping container.

1161
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,109
He's got the material, Neil.

1162
01:35:35,176 --> 01:35:37,211
I handed it to him on a plate.

1163
01:35:37,278 --> 01:35:38,813
I warned you...

1164
01:35:38,879 --> 01:35:40,048
What's happened's happened.

1165
01:35:40,114 --> 01:35:42,050
I get it now.

1166
01:35:42,116 --> 01:35:44,819
But it's hard to take things on trust
from people speaking half-truths.

1167
01:35:45,853 --> 01:35:47,121
That's not fair.

1168
01:35:47,188 --> 01:35:49,457
You were a part of this
before we met.

1169
01:35:49,523 --> 01:35:50,825
Were you working for Priya?

1170
01:35:50,892 --> 01:35:51,826
No.

1171
01:35:51,893 --> 01:35:53,628
Who recruited you, Neil?

1172
01:35:53,694 --> 01:35:56,697
It can't possibly do you any
good to know that right now.

1173
01:35:56,764 --> 01:36:01,702
When this is over, if we're still
standing, and you still care,

1174
01:36:01,769 --> 01:36:04,672
then you can hear
my life story, okay?

1175
01:36:06,942 --> 01:36:08,542
I'm sorry I involved you.

1176
01:36:08,609 --> 01:36:10,444
You need to tell me
what's going on.

1177
01:36:10,511 --> 01:36:13,347
Apparently Neil here knows
more about it than I do.

1178
01:36:13,414 --> 01:36:15,083
Good luck, pal.

1179
01:36:15,149 --> 01:36:17,485
By telling Kat anything,
we're compromising her in Priya's eyes.

1180
01:36:17,551 --> 01:36:20,187
In Priya's eyes,
she's already compromised.

1181
01:36:20,254 --> 01:36:22,623
She has the right to know
why she might die.

1182
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:23,658
Am I gonna die?

1183
01:36:23,724 --> 01:36:25,559
Not if we have something
to say about it.

1184
01:36:25,626 --> 01:36:26,794
And we do.

1185
01:36:26,861 --> 01:36:29,097
Who are you?

1186
01:36:29,163 --> 01:36:33,167
Let's start with the simple stuff.
Every law of physics...

1187
01:36:38,974 --> 01:36:41,043
<i>The material's not in the case.</i>

1188
01:36:41,109 --> 01:36:44,645
<i>Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.</i>

1189
01:36:53,721 --> 01:36:54,755
You injured?

1190
01:37:00,394 --> 01:37:02,596
What's the algorithm, Neil?

1191
01:37:04,365 --> 01:37:07,635
241 is one section of it.
One out of nine.

1192
01:37:08,836 --> 01:37:11,173
It's a formula
rendered into physical form

1193
01:37:11,238 --> 01:37:13,774
so it can't be copied
or communicated.

1194
01:37:13,841 --> 01:37:15,810
It's a black box
with one function.

1195
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:18,646
Which is?

1196
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:21,782
Inversion. But not objects
or peoples.

1197
01:37:21,849 --> 01:37:22,984
The world around us.

1198
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:24,485
I don't understand.

1199
01:37:24,552 --> 01:37:27,155
As they invert the entropy
of more and more objects,

1200
01:37:27,221 --> 01:37:30,992
the two directions of time
are becoming more intertwined.

1201
01:37:31,059 --> 01:37:34,662
But because the environment
essentially flows in our direction...

1202
01:37:34,729 --> 01:37:35,696
we dominate.

1203
01:37:35,763 --> 01:37:37,398
They're always
swimming upstream.

1204
01:37:37,465 --> 01:37:38,934
It's what saved your life.

1205
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,802
Inverted explosion was pushing
against the environment.

1206
01:37:41,869 --> 01:37:43,370
Pissing in the wind.

1207
01:37:43,437 --> 01:37:45,706
And the algorithm can
change the direction of that wind.

1208
01:37:45,773 --> 01:37:48,476
It can invert the entropy
of the world.

1209
01:37:49,144 --> 01:37:50,611
And if that happens?

1210
01:37:50,678 --> 01:37:51,712
Oh...

1211
01:37:52,279 --> 01:37:53,714
End of play.

1212
01:37:53,781 --> 01:37:55,917
"End of play." Can you be
a little more precise?

1213
01:37:55,984 --> 01:37:59,820
Everyone and everything that's ever
lived, destroyed. Instantly.

1214
01:37:59,888 --> 01:38:00,956
Precise enough?

1215
01:38:01,022 --> 01:38:02,723
Including my son.

1216
01:38:05,659 --> 01:38:08,930
The more you sleep,
the faster you'll heal.

1217
01:38:24,779 --> 01:38:26,014
On a truck.

1218
01:38:28,282 --> 01:38:29,717
Shouldn't be long now.

1219
01:38:30,785 --> 01:38:33,054
I've been thinking.

1220
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:34,990
We're their ancestors.

1221
01:38:35,056 --> 01:38:37,893
If they destroy us,
won't that destroy them?

1222
01:38:37,959 --> 01:38:40,294
This brings us
to the grandfather paradox.

1223
01:38:40,361 --> 01:38:41,695
The what?

1224
01:38:42,429 --> 01:38:43,831
If you went back in time

1225
01:38:43,899 --> 01:38:45,499
and killed
your own grandfather,

1226
01:38:45,566 --> 01:38:47,501
how could you have been born
to commit the act?

1227
01:38:47,568 --> 01:38:48,769
What's the answer?

1228
01:38:48,836 --> 01:38:50,906
There's no answer.
It's a paradox.

1229
01:38:50,972 --> 01:38:52,107
But in the future,

1230
01:38:52,174 --> 01:38:53,774
those in power clearly believe
that you can

1231
01:38:53,841 --> 01:38:55,342
kick grandpa down the stairs,

1232
01:38:55,409 --> 01:38:57,179
gouge his eyes out,

1233
01:38:57,245 --> 01:38:58,445
slit his throat,

1234
01:38:58,512 --> 01:39:00,215
without consequence.

1235
01:39:00,282 --> 01:39:02,050
Could they be right?

1236
01:39:02,117 --> 01:39:03,751
Doesn't matter.

1237
01:39:03,818 --> 01:39:05,486
They believe it.

1238
01:39:05,553 --> 01:39:07,755
So they're willing
to destroy us.

1239
01:39:09,423 --> 01:39:11,159
Can I go back to sleep now?

1240
01:39:11,226 --> 01:39:12,693
No. I thought of
something else.

1241
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:13,661
Great.

1242
01:39:13,727 --> 01:39:15,696
This reversing
the flow of time.

1243
01:39:15,763 --> 01:39:18,566
Doesn't us being here now
mean it never happens?

1244
01:39:18,632 --> 01:39:20,902
That we stop them?

1245
01:39:20,969 --> 01:39:23,305
Optimistically, I'd say
that's right.

1246
01:39:23,404 --> 01:39:24,973
Pessimistically?

1247
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,474
In a parallel worlds theory,
we can't know the relationship

1248
01:39:27,541 --> 01:39:30,611
between consciousness
and multiple realities.

1249
01:39:30,678 --> 01:39:32,147
Does your head hurt yet?

1250
01:39:32,214 --> 01:39:33,547
Yes.

1251
01:39:37,285 --> 01:39:38,819
Try to sleep.

1252
01:39:53,667 --> 01:39:55,036
Shit.

1253
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:58,539
They didn't take us inside.

1254
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:01,442
What do we do?

1255
01:40:04,545 --> 01:40:05,846
We use the breach.

1256
01:40:05,914 --> 01:40:07,983
The chaos right after impact.
Get ready.

1257
01:40:10,952 --> 01:40:12,553
She healed enough?

1258
01:40:13,288 --> 01:40:15,123
I don't know.

1259
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:16,557
I've never done this before.

1260
01:40:16,624 --> 01:40:19,294
The fire crew's there.

1261
01:40:19,361 --> 01:40:20,794
You take Kat
through the breach,

1262
01:40:20,861 --> 01:40:22,663
I take care of Sator's men
and secure the vault.

1263
01:40:22,730 --> 01:40:24,332
Then you bring her in.

1264
01:40:25,967 --> 01:40:27,035
How's your arm?

1265
01:40:27,102 --> 01:40:28,736
Not good.

1266
01:40:33,174 --> 01:40:35,043
We move as soon as
we hear the engines.

1267
01:40:39,546 --> 01:40:40,714
- Hold on, hold on.
- What?

1268
01:40:40,781 --> 01:40:42,650
You're bleeding.

1269
01:40:42,716 --> 01:40:44,085
All right, let me take
a look at it.

1270
01:40:50,691 --> 01:40:51,893
Ready?

1271
01:41:24,692 --> 01:41:26,227
Wait here. I'm going in.

1272
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:25,080
Come on!

1273
01:43:25,146 --> 01:43:26,181
Go, go, go!

1274
01:43:56,444 --> 01:43:57,312
Go!

1275
01:45:39,547 --> 01:45:41,416
You knew it was me
coming out of that vault.

1276
01:45:41,482 --> 01:45:42,749
Why didn't you say?

1277
01:45:42,816 --> 01:45:44,385
That's a lot of explaining

1278
01:45:44,452 --> 01:45:45,852
when someone's about to put
a bullet in their own brain.

1279
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,188
But afterwards?

1280
01:45:47,255 --> 01:45:50,525
Thing's the same,
I knew you'd be okay.

1281
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,126
What's happened's happened.

1282
01:45:52,193 --> 01:45:55,430
If I told you and you acted
differently, who knows?

1283
01:45:57,031 --> 01:45:59,601
The policy is to suppress.

1284
01:45:59,667 --> 01:46:01,502
Whose policy?

1285
01:46:01,569 --> 01:46:02,904
Ours, my friend.

1286
01:46:06,241 --> 01:46:09,344
We're the people saving the
world from what might've been.

1287
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:20,288
Kat?

1288
01:46:21,256 --> 01:46:23,191
I'm here.

1289
01:46:23,258 --> 01:46:24,892
It'll be quite a scar.

1290
01:46:24,959 --> 01:46:26,327
You'll be okay.

1291
01:46:28,696 --> 01:46:29,964
Did it.

1292
01:46:30,031 --> 01:46:31,933
You did what?

1293
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,901
Andrei has the algorithm.

1294
01:46:34,835 --> 01:46:36,837
You don't know where he is.

1295
01:46:38,772 --> 01:46:40,141
Or when.

1296
01:46:41,242 --> 01:46:43,544
- Get Priya here to Oslo.
- Why?

1297
01:46:43,611 --> 01:46:46,614
If I don't do something, in two
days, she tells me about the 241.

1298
01:46:46,681 --> 01:46:48,283
Nothing can change that.

1299
01:46:48,349 --> 01:46:49,350
We'll see.

1300
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:51,452
Just get her here.

1301
01:46:53,955 --> 01:46:55,089
Hello, Priya.

1302
01:46:55,990 --> 01:46:57,458
What's going on?

1303
01:46:57,525 --> 01:46:59,060
Where's Neil?

1304
01:46:59,127 --> 01:47:02,664
Nursing Katherine Barton,
who almost died because of you.

1305
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:03,731
What did I do?

1306
01:47:03,797 --> 01:47:05,333
It's what you're going to do.

1307
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:07,568
In two days, you're gonna have
me dangle plutonium-241

1308
01:47:07,635 --> 01:47:10,104
in front of the world's
most dangerous arms dealer.

1309
01:47:10,171 --> 01:47:11,906
Now, I wanna know why.

1310
01:47:11,973 --> 01:47:14,108
You let Sator get hold of 241?

1311
01:47:14,175 --> 01:47:16,177
No, I let him get ahold
of the algorithm.

1312
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:20,014
So, tell me about it, Priya.

1313
01:47:20,081 --> 01:47:22,517
It's... It's unique.

1314
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:24,452
The scientist who built it
took her own life

1315
01:47:24,519 --> 01:47:26,154
so she couldn't be forced
to make another.

1316
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:27,422
A scientist in the future?

1317
01:47:27,488 --> 01:47:28,489
Generations from now.

1318
01:47:28,556 --> 01:47:30,325
Why does she have to
kill herself?

1319
01:47:30,391 --> 01:47:33,328
You're familiar
with the Manhattan Project?

1320
01:47:33,394 --> 01:47:35,496
As they approached
the first atomic test,

1321
01:47:35,563 --> 01:47:37,065
Oppenheimer became concerned

1322
01:47:37,131 --> 01:47:39,866
that the detonation
might produce a chain reaction,

1323
01:47:39,934 --> 01:47:41,169
engulfing the world.

1324
01:47:41,235 --> 01:47:42,770
They went ahead anyway
and got lucky.

1325
01:47:42,836 --> 01:47:47,442
Think of our scientist as
her generation's Oppenheimer.

1326
01:47:47,508 --> 01:47:50,044
She devises a method
for inverting the world,

1327
01:47:50,111 --> 01:47:52,846
but becomes convinced
that by destroying us,

1328
01:47:52,914 --> 01:47:54,549
they're destroying themselves.

1329
01:47:54,615 --> 01:47:56,484
The grandfather paradox.

1330
01:47:56,551 --> 01:47:58,453
But, unlike Oppenheimer,

1331
01:47:58,519 --> 01:47:59,654
she rebels,

1332
01:47:59,721 --> 01:48:01,956
splitting the algorithm
into nine sections

1333
01:48:02,023 --> 01:48:04,559
and hiding them the best place
she can think of.

1334
01:48:05,226 --> 01:48:06,294
The past.

1335
01:48:06,361 --> 01:48:07,261
Here, now.

1336
01:48:07,328 --> 01:48:09,764
There are nine nuclear powers.

1337
01:48:09,831 --> 01:48:11,799
Nine bombs.

1338
01:48:11,865 --> 01:48:14,836
Nine sets of the most closely guarded
materials in the history of the world.

1339
01:48:14,902 --> 01:48:16,938
The best hiding place possible.

1340
01:48:17,004 --> 01:48:19,807
Nuclear containment facilities.

1341
01:48:19,873 --> 01:48:21,275
Sator's lifelong mission,

1342
01:48:21,342 --> 01:48:23,978
financed and guided
by the future, has been to

1343
01:48:24,045 --> 01:48:26,481
find and reassemble
the algorithm.

1344
01:48:26,547 --> 01:48:27,782
Why do they choose him?

1345
01:48:27,849 --> 01:48:29,784
Because he was at the right
place at the right time.

1346
01:48:29,851 --> 01:48:31,853
The collapse of
the Soviet Union.

1347
01:48:31,919 --> 01:48:35,256
The most insecure moment in the
history of nuclear weapons.

1348
01:48:35,323 --> 01:48:37,725
How many sections does he have?

1349
01:48:37,792 --> 01:48:39,527
After the 241, all nine.

1350
01:48:39,594 --> 01:48:41,396
Jesus Christ.

1351
01:48:41,462 --> 01:48:44,632
And that's why you're going to
do things differently this time.

1352
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,001
To change things?

1353
01:48:47,068 --> 01:48:48,336
So Katherine won't get hurt?

1354
01:48:48,403 --> 01:48:50,905
So Sator won't get
the algorithm.

1355
01:48:52,774 --> 01:48:55,143
If that universe can exist...

1356
01:48:55,209 --> 01:48:56,477
we don't live in it.

1357
01:48:56,544 --> 01:48:58,479
Well, let's try.

1358
01:48:58,546 --> 01:49:00,381
You're going to warn me.

1359
01:49:00,448 --> 01:49:02,049
No, I'm not.

1360
01:49:02,116 --> 01:49:03,684
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1361
01:49:03,751 --> 01:49:04,986
Come on.

1362
01:49:05,052 --> 01:49:07,188
If you had known
what the algorithm was,

1363
01:49:07,255 --> 01:49:09,557
would you have let it fall
into Sator's hands?

1364
01:49:10,691 --> 01:49:12,660
You want Sator to get
the last section.

1365
01:49:12,727 --> 01:49:15,396
That is the only way he'll
bring together the other eight.

1366
01:49:15,463 --> 01:49:17,698
I was supposed to steal it...

1367
01:49:17,765 --> 01:49:18,901
then lose it?

1368
01:49:18,966 --> 01:49:20,835
Mission accomplished.

1369
01:49:20,903 --> 01:49:22,437
You used me.

1370
01:49:23,271 --> 01:49:25,440
As you used Katherine.

1371
01:49:25,506 --> 01:49:27,742
Standard operating procedure.

1372
01:49:28,911 --> 01:49:30,311
You've done your part.

1373
01:49:30,878 --> 01:49:32,146
My part?

1374
01:49:32,213 --> 01:49:34,782
I'm the protagonist
of this operation.

1375
01:49:34,849 --> 01:49:36,017
You...

1376
01:49:36,083 --> 01:49:37,886
are a protagonist.

1377
01:49:37,952 --> 01:49:40,923
Did you think you were the only
one capable of saving the world?

1378
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:46,961
No.

1379
01:49:48,062 --> 01:49:49,664
But I am.

1380
01:49:49,730 --> 01:49:51,032
Because I haven't told you

1381
01:49:51,098 --> 01:49:52,901
where he's assembling the
algorithm or when.

1382
01:49:52,967 --> 01:49:54,101
You're about to.

1383
01:49:54,168 --> 01:49:55,770
No, I'm not.

1384
01:49:55,837 --> 01:49:57,104
So, deal us in.

1385
01:49:58,105 --> 01:49:59,474
"Us"?

1386
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:01,108
Why would you want to
involve her again?

1387
01:50:01,175 --> 01:50:02,677
Because she can get
close to him.

1388
01:50:02,743 --> 01:50:04,045
Does he still trust her?

1389
01:50:04,111 --> 01:50:05,513
He thinks she's dead.

1390
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:06,881
But he used to.

1391
01:50:06,949 --> 01:50:09,150
You have started looking at
the world in a new way.

1392
01:50:09,217 --> 01:50:10,585
And now, it's your turn.

1393
01:50:10,651 --> 01:50:12,320
Assuming she
makes it out alive,

1394
01:50:12,386 --> 01:50:14,622
whether or not you feel
she knows too much.

1395
01:50:14,689 --> 01:50:15,790
I can't.

1396
01:50:15,857 --> 01:50:17,191
If you don't have
the authority,

1397
01:50:17,258 --> 01:50:19,627
then talk to whoever's
in charge of loose ends.

1398
01:50:19,694 --> 01:50:21,362
I need your word

1399
01:50:21,429 --> 01:50:24,398
that she and her son
will be safe, Priya.

1400
01:50:24,465 --> 01:50:26,434
What good is someone's word
in our line of business?

1401
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:33,407
They'll be safe.

1402
01:50:35,309 --> 01:50:37,445
There's a rally point
offshore at Trondheim.

1403
01:50:37,512 --> 01:50:39,146
<i>Get yourselves up there.</i>

1404
01:50:39,213 --> 01:50:41,115
<i>Ives has a team
ready to invert.</i>

1405
01:50:41,182 --> 01:50:42,650
<i>You have
a turnstile?</i>

1406
01:50:42,717 --> 01:50:45,253
The exact technology
that we're trying to suppress.

1407
01:50:45,319 --> 01:50:48,022
Fighting fire with fire's
a treacherous business.

1408
01:50:48,089 --> 01:50:50,191
But there are some people,
in the future,

1409
01:50:50,258 --> 01:50:53,761
who want to continue the
algorithm's journey into the past.

1410
01:50:54,829 --> 01:50:56,364
You see...

1411
01:50:56,430 --> 01:50:59,333
<i>Tenet wasn't founded
in the past.</i>

1412
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:02,603
<i>It will be founded
in the future.</i>

1413
01:51:28,931 --> 01:51:30,865
Can't get over the birds.

1414
01:51:30,933 --> 01:51:32,733
How're you feeling?

1415
01:51:38,006 --> 01:51:39,640
Tell me you're gonna kill him.

1416
01:51:40,441 --> 01:51:41,375
I can't.

1417
01:51:41,442 --> 01:51:42,610
Why not?

1418
01:51:42,677 --> 01:51:44,378
Bet you've probably
killed a lot of people.

1419
01:51:44,445 --> 01:51:46,547
Not with a dead man's switch.

1420
01:51:46,614 --> 01:51:48,884
The fitness tracker he wears.

1421
01:51:48,951 --> 01:51:50,151
He's obsessive
about his health.

1422
01:51:50,217 --> 01:51:51,419
It'll be linked
to a switch,

1423
01:51:51,485 --> 01:51:53,588
probably a simple e-mail burst

1424
01:51:53,654 --> 01:51:55,423
that reveals the location
of the dead drop,

1425
01:51:55,489 --> 01:51:57,425
set to fire if his heart stops.

1426
01:51:57,491 --> 01:51:59,895
His death activates
the algorithm.

1427
01:51:59,962 --> 01:52:01,762
He dies, the world ends.

1428
01:52:01,829 --> 01:52:03,497
No one dares kill him.

1429
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:07,735
No, you've missed the point.

1430
01:52:10,005 --> 01:52:11,539
He's intending to end his life.

1431
01:52:13,909 --> 01:52:14,775
Why?

1432
01:52:16,611 --> 01:52:18,145
He's dying.

1433
01:52:18,981 --> 01:52:21,215
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

1434
01:52:22,516 --> 01:52:24,518
And he's taking the world
with him.

1435
01:52:24,585 --> 01:52:26,821
If he can't have her,
no one can.

1436
01:52:26,888 --> 01:52:31,093
He gets to choose the time and
place for the end of the world.

1437
01:52:31,158 --> 01:52:33,694
What moment?
What does he choose?

1438
01:52:35,529 --> 01:52:38,499
You told me about a holiday
where you let him feel loved.

1439
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:40,134
Vietnam.

1440
01:52:40,201 --> 01:52:42,169
You said he vanished. What day?

1441
01:52:42,236 --> 01:52:44,605
I went ashore with Max and he flew
off, but I don't know what day it was.

1442
01:52:44,672 --> 01:52:47,009
It was the 14th. Ten days ago.

1443
01:52:47,075 --> 01:52:48,376
He was in Ukraine.

1444
01:52:48,442 --> 01:52:50,112
At the Kiev opera siege.

1445
01:52:50,177 --> 01:52:53,648
How do you know about that?

1446
01:52:53,714 --> 01:52:55,951
The point is, he wasn't on his
yacht, so that's his window.

1447
01:52:56,018 --> 01:52:58,619
To go back to that golden
moment and have it be his last.

1448
01:52:58,686 --> 01:53:00,321
Everyone's last.

1449
01:53:00,388 --> 01:53:02,156
We have to lift the algorithm
from the dead drop

1450
01:53:02,223 --> 01:53:03,524
without Sator knowing.

1451
01:53:03,591 --> 01:53:05,826
If he believes it's there,
he kills himself.

1452
01:53:05,894 --> 01:53:07,328
And not the rest of us.

1453
01:53:07,395 --> 01:53:08,529
Where's the dead drop?

1454
01:53:08,596 --> 01:53:10,297
Knowledge divided, my friend.

1455
01:53:10,364 --> 01:53:11,432
You're not gonna tell me?

1456
01:53:11,499 --> 01:53:12,901
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1457
01:53:12,968 --> 01:53:14,903
But I need you back
on that yacht, Kat.

1458
01:53:14,970 --> 01:53:16,804
Why?

1459
01:53:16,871 --> 01:53:19,240
You have to stop him killing
himself until we know the algorithm

1460
01:53:19,306 --> 01:53:21,242
is out of the dead drop.

1461
01:53:21,308 --> 01:53:23,377
But if I'm caught there,
my son sees.

1462
01:53:23,444 --> 01:53:25,179
I don't want those moments
to be full of anguish

1463
01:53:25,246 --> 01:53:27,448
if they're gonna be his last.

1464
01:53:28,116 --> 01:53:29,383
They're not.

1465
01:53:54,308 --> 01:53:55,543
It's time.

1466
01:53:55,609 --> 01:53:56,978
We're working our way
back to the 14th,

1467
01:53:57,045 --> 01:53:58,713
but without knowing
where the dead drop is,

1468
01:53:58,779 --> 01:54:01,348
there's only so much
I can do to prepare.

1469
01:54:02,416 --> 01:54:05,519
You know what a hypocenter is?

1470
01:54:05,586 --> 01:54:07,923
It's ground zero for
an underground nuclear test.

1471
01:54:07,989 --> 01:54:13,095
Sir Michael Crosby told me about a
detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th.

1472
01:54:13,161 --> 01:54:15,496
The dead drop is at the bottom
of the hypocenter.

1473
01:54:15,563 --> 01:54:18,566
That explosion
seals up the algorithm.

1474
01:54:18,632 --> 01:54:20,334
Well, then we better
pull it out of that hole

1475
01:54:20,401 --> 01:54:22,603
before the bomb goes off, eh?

1476
01:54:24,739 --> 01:54:26,507
<i>Line it up.</i>

1477
01:54:26,574 --> 01:54:27,775
<i>Move forward.</i>

1478
01:54:29,877 --> 01:54:30,878
<i>Next.</i>

1479
01:54:35,117 --> 01:54:36,317
<i>Line it up.</i>

1480
01:54:37,953 --> 01:54:39,286
Where's Neil?

1481
01:54:42,224 --> 01:54:43,457
He must've
gone through already.

1482
01:54:43,524 --> 01:54:45,292
I didn't get to say goodbye.

1483
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:46,995
This is goodbye, isn't it?

1484
01:54:47,062 --> 01:54:48,696
I'd like to say...

1485
01:54:48,763 --> 01:54:50,598
that you don't have to
do this, Kat...

1486
01:54:50,664 --> 01:54:53,768
Worst thing Andrei ever did to
me was that offer he made me.

1487
01:54:53,834 --> 01:54:57,038
Let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

1488
01:54:58,305 --> 01:55:00,307
I shouted and...

1489
01:55:00,374 --> 01:55:02,476
<i>swore.</i>

1490
01:55:02,543 --> 01:55:04,946
But he'd seen it on my face,
just for an instant.

1491
01:55:08,282 --> 01:55:10,484
I considered it.

1492
01:55:10,551 --> 01:55:12,787
I don't know if I hate him more
for what he's done,

1493
01:55:12,853 --> 01:55:14,923
or because he knows that
about me.

1494
01:55:15,322 --> 01:55:16,524
Oh.

1495
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:19,727
A chance to help save my child.

1496
01:55:19,794 --> 01:55:21,997
You can't know
what that means to a mother.

1497
01:55:22,063 --> 01:55:23,364
No.

1498
01:55:23,430 --> 01:55:25,299
You've killed people
you've hated before.

1499
01:55:25,366 --> 01:55:26,801
It's not usually personal.

1500
01:55:26,867 --> 01:55:28,869
Well, he's dying anyway.
Maybe it doesn't even count.

1501
01:55:28,937 --> 01:55:30,738
It always counts, Kat.

1502
01:55:30,805 --> 01:55:34,276
You're not there to kill him,
you're the backstop.

1503
01:55:34,341 --> 01:55:37,212
If we don't lift that algorithm
and he kills himself,

1504
01:55:37,279 --> 01:55:38,980
he takes us all with him.

1505
01:55:41,549 --> 01:55:43,818
You just keep up
your end, okay?

1506
01:55:47,755 --> 01:55:49,291
Today's the 14th.

1507
01:55:49,356 --> 01:55:50,959
Offshore of Siberia.

1508
01:55:51,026 --> 01:55:52,359
Time for us to go.

1509
01:55:52,426 --> 01:55:53,727
You keep going back
another day,

1510
01:55:53,794 --> 01:55:55,629
give you some time
to get back into Vietnam.

1511
01:55:55,696 --> 01:55:56,797
And who gets me on the yacht?

1512
01:55:56,864 --> 01:55:58,666
I've got somebody good
lined up.

1513
01:55:58,732 --> 01:56:01,702
When it's over, when you're
raising your boy, carry this.

1514
01:56:01,769 --> 01:56:04,105
There may be a time and place
you feel threatened.

1515
01:56:04,172 --> 01:56:07,408
Hit "talk," state your
location, hang up.

1516
01:56:07,474 --> 01:56:09,443
Who gets the message?

1517
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:11,412
Posterity.

1518
01:56:50,551 --> 01:56:52,153
Stalsk-12.

1519
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:55,323
Hidden from the world is a city
where anything can happen.

1520
01:56:55,389 --> 01:56:59,793
And today, ladies and gents,
for ten minutes, it most assuredly does.

1521
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:03,597
You've been divided into two teams
for a temporal pincer movement.

1522
01:57:03,664 --> 01:57:05,200
We're Red Team, moving forward.

1523
01:57:05,267 --> 01:57:07,701
In order to distinguish
the teams, you'll wear these.

1524
01:57:07,768 --> 01:57:09,237
Our friends over there,

1525
01:57:09,304 --> 01:57:11,605
Blue Team, led by Commander
Wheeler, are inverted.

1526
01:57:11,672 --> 01:57:13,807
Why don't they let us see them?

1527
01:57:13,874 --> 01:57:15,277
Maybe we won't like
what happened.

1528
01:57:15,343 --> 01:57:18,346
One hour from now,
they had this briefing.

1529
01:57:20,115 --> 01:57:23,584
Then, were dropped on the ridge
above the hypocenter,

1530
01:57:23,651 --> 01:57:25,887
as close in time
to the detonation as possible.

1531
01:57:25,954 --> 01:57:29,891
Their objectives were clearance
and clarification.

1532
01:57:29,958 --> 01:57:33,962
Now, this briefing has the
benefit of their experience.

1533
01:57:50,711 --> 01:57:52,646
Both teams have
countdown watches.

1534
01:57:52,713 --> 01:57:55,283
Ours counts down from ten,
from landing

1535
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:57,185
to zero to the explosion.

1536
01:57:57,252 --> 01:57:58,920
- <i>Blue Team is reversed.</i>
- Everybody, look to your left.

1537
01:57:58,987 --> 01:58:03,024
If you are not at the LZ
at zero, you are not leaving.

1538
01:58:04,092 --> 01:58:05,360
Do you understand?

1539
01:58:05,427 --> 01:58:09,030
We drop in, clear LZs
for Blue Team evacuation.

1540
01:58:09,097 --> 01:58:10,831
We make our way
into the city proper.

1541
01:58:10,899 --> 01:58:13,534
These buildings are abandoned,
but we learned

1542
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:15,236
there is a turnstile.

1543
01:58:15,303 --> 01:58:17,305
Expect a bitemporal response.

1544
01:58:17,372 --> 01:58:18,772
They'll have inverse ordnance?

1545
01:58:18,839 --> 01:58:21,109
Inverse, conventional,

1546
01:58:21,176 --> 01:58:24,478
forward antagonists, inverted
antagonists, they have it all.

1547
01:58:24,545 --> 01:58:26,047
On the other side of the city,

1548
01:58:26,114 --> 01:58:28,383
the ground rises to the ridge
above the hypocenter.

1549
01:58:28,450 --> 01:58:31,886
A splinter unit will take this
tunnel from the city

1550
01:58:31,953 --> 01:58:33,888
to the floor of the hypocenter.

1551
01:58:33,955 --> 01:58:36,657
Blue Team located
an entrance here.

1552
01:58:36,724 --> 01:58:38,826
The bomb is in this rock,

1553
01:58:38,893 --> 01:58:42,030
high above,
to trigger a collapse,

1554
01:58:42,097 --> 01:58:42,998
sealing the cavern.

1555
01:58:43,064 --> 01:58:44,698
How do we defuse the bomb
up there?

1556
01:58:44,765 --> 01:58:47,235
We don't. The explosion
takes place as planned.

1557
01:58:47,302 --> 01:58:51,239
Now, our job is to fail
to defuse that bomb

1558
01:58:51,306 --> 01:58:55,043
while the splinter unit
achieves its task undetected.

1559
01:58:55,110 --> 01:58:55,910
Which is?

1560
01:58:55,977 --> 01:58:58,179
Need-to-know, and you don't.

1561
01:58:58,246 --> 01:59:00,015
Any other stupid questions?

1562
01:59:00,081 --> 01:59:02,716
Good. Well, let's go.
Let's get ready.

1563
01:59:05,453 --> 01:59:06,854
I wanted to be
on the first wave.

1564
01:59:06,921 --> 01:59:08,323
There is no first wave.

1565
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:11,192
Red Team and Blue Team
operate simultaneously.

1566
01:59:11,259 --> 01:59:12,994
Look,

1567
01:59:13,061 --> 01:59:15,196
don't get on the chopper if you
can't stop thinking in linear terms.

1568
01:59:15,263 --> 01:59:18,599
Now, you wanna be on the team that
lifts the contents of the capsule?

1569
01:59:18,665 --> 01:59:20,701
Absolutely.

1570
01:59:20,768 --> 01:59:22,836
Yeah, that's us.

1571
01:59:22,904 --> 01:59:24,372
We're splinter unit.

1572
01:59:24,439 --> 01:59:26,207
Just us?

1573
01:59:26,274 --> 01:59:29,911
No one who knows the contents of
that capsule can leave the field.

1574
01:59:29,978 --> 01:59:32,746
I thought we'd
manage ourselves.

1575
01:59:42,257 --> 01:59:44,392
It's 40 feet from the
private deck to the water.

1576
01:59:44,459 --> 01:59:46,027
Can you jump it?

1577
01:59:46,094 --> 01:59:47,362
I can dive it.

1578
01:59:47,429 --> 01:59:50,131
Until you see my signal,
you don't let him die.

1579
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:27,402
Thirty seconds!

1580
02:01:08,476 --> 02:01:09,676
Go! Go! Go!

1581
02:01:21,156 --> 02:01:23,258
We're coming in
on a shockwave.

1582
02:01:23,324 --> 02:01:24,658
Hang on, people.

1583
02:01:33,601 --> 02:01:35,036
On your feet!

1584
02:01:48,616 --> 02:01:50,118
There!

1585
02:02:03,097 --> 02:02:04,798
Ma'am.
We thought you'd gone ashore.

1586
02:02:04,865 --> 02:02:06,501
Well, I snuck back
to surprise Andrei.

1587
02:02:06,568 --> 02:02:07,502
Oh, the boss left.

1588
02:02:08,970 --> 02:02:11,339
Well, have Mr. Sator
find me here.

1589
02:02:11,406 --> 02:02:12,739
And don't tell the others.

1590
02:02:12,806 --> 02:02:14,175
I'll get the mess.

1591
02:03:21,676 --> 02:03:22,776
Mines!

1592
02:03:22,843 --> 02:03:24,012
Mines!

1593
02:03:38,092 --> 02:03:39,427
They told me
you'd gone ashore.

1594
02:03:41,795 --> 02:03:42,964
They told me you'd flown off.

1595
02:03:43,031 --> 02:03:45,199
I came back to see you and Max.

1596
02:03:45,266 --> 02:03:48,469
Max is on shore with Anna.

1597
02:03:48,536 --> 02:03:50,271
We need time, just you and me,
after what happened.

1598
02:03:50,338 --> 02:03:53,341
I was joking.
It was a stupid joke.

1599
02:03:53,408 --> 02:03:55,209
You think I'm
a terrible mother.

1600
02:03:55,276 --> 02:03:58,845
We both know my opinion of you
is higher than yours of me.

1601
02:04:06,387 --> 02:04:09,057
I want things
to be better, Andrei.

1602
02:04:24,572 --> 02:04:25,907
Take cover!

1603
02:04:30,011 --> 02:04:31,913
Get me a goddamn AT4!

1604
02:04:31,979 --> 02:04:33,781
Take him out, now!

1605
02:04:33,847 --> 02:04:35,249
Provide some cover!

1606
02:04:35,316 --> 02:04:37,452
Move, move, move! Let's go!

1607
02:04:37,518 --> 02:04:38,953
Move, move, move!

1608
02:05:49,056 --> 02:05:50,124
Wheeler!

1609
02:05:51,692 --> 02:05:52,760
Get outta there!

1610
02:05:52,827 --> 02:05:54,162
Come on!

1611
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:00,568
Ives!

1612
02:06:02,770 --> 02:06:04,472
Splinter unit. Here.

1613
02:06:06,107 --> 02:06:08,109
You know, it's going to be
a beautiful sunset.

1614
02:06:08,176 --> 02:06:12,947
I'll get Max brought back.
We should share the moment with him.

1615
02:06:13,014 --> 02:06:15,918
I'll make you a drink.

1616
02:06:15,983 --> 02:06:18,186
Bring my son back to the boat.

1617
02:06:24,392 --> 02:06:25,660
We're runnin' out of time,
let's go!

1618
02:06:25,726 --> 02:06:28,129
If they see us,
it's all for nothing.

1619
02:06:31,766 --> 02:06:32,935
We need a distraction.

1620
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,635
Don't worry about that.

1621
02:06:38,172 --> 02:06:39,707
On my mark!

1622
02:06:42,577 --> 02:06:45,046
RPG, hit the base!

1623
02:06:45,112 --> 02:06:46,314
That building
on my mark!

1624
02:06:48,449 --> 02:06:50,151
Three! Two!

1625
02:06:50,218 --> 02:06:52,220
One! Fire!

1626
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:54,455
Fire!

1627
02:07:09,237 --> 02:07:10,705
Move! Move!

1628
02:07:26,287 --> 02:07:28,489
We're committed now. Come on.

1629
02:07:34,729 --> 02:07:36,264
What's that?

1630
02:07:36,330 --> 02:07:39,100
I borrowed it
from the CIA.

1631
02:07:40,167 --> 02:07:41,269
What is it?

1632
02:07:41,335 --> 02:07:43,804
The way the world ends.

1633
02:07:43,871 --> 02:07:46,707
Not with a bang, but a whimper.

1634
02:07:46,774 --> 02:07:48,409
I don't understand.

1635
02:07:48,476 --> 02:07:50,611
When I take this,
it's all over.

1636
02:07:51,345 --> 02:07:53,447
Then don't take it yet.

1637
02:07:56,484 --> 02:07:58,185
Why not?

1638
02:07:59,453 --> 02:08:01,890
Because we have
the sunset coming.

1639
02:08:01,957 --> 02:08:04,392
And a little vodka left.

1640
02:08:04,458 --> 02:08:06,494
And Max will be here soon.

1641
02:08:06,561 --> 02:08:10,765
They said they thought it was
you, not Anna, ashore with Max.

1642
02:08:13,434 --> 02:08:17,171
So long as you can tell
the difference.

1643
02:08:19,106 --> 02:08:21,809
A moment's business, my love.

1644
02:08:33,989 --> 02:08:35,289
<i>Mahir, do you copy?</i>

1645
02:08:35,356 --> 02:08:38,659
<i>Not clear. I repeat, not clear!</i>

1646
02:08:38,726 --> 02:08:39,860
Copy that.

1647
02:08:39,928 --> 02:08:43,230
I repeat, not clear!

1648
02:09:09,657 --> 02:09:10,725
Neil!

1649
02:09:11,559 --> 02:09:12,627
Neil!

1650
02:09:25,539 --> 02:09:26,641
Go!

1651
02:09:35,383 --> 02:09:38,319
We don't have anything
big enough to blow this.

1652
02:09:44,358 --> 02:09:46,293
Try him.
See if he's got a grenade.

1653
02:09:50,899 --> 02:09:51,967
Anything?

1654
02:09:52,034 --> 02:09:53,467
Nah, nothing.

1655
02:09:53,534 --> 02:09:55,904
Here, you try having
a look. Can you pick it?

1656
02:09:55,971 --> 02:09:57,204
<i>I hope not.</i>

1657
02:09:57,271 --> 02:09:59,074
<i>I paid a lot for that lock.</i>

1658
02:09:59,141 --> 02:10:02,144
<i>How do you like where my
journey began and yours ends?</i>

1659
02:10:02,209 --> 02:10:03,678
Little radioactive
for my taste.

1660
02:10:03,744 --> 02:10:07,782
My fate was always bound up
with radiation.

1661
02:10:07,848 --> 02:10:10,618
We'd work where
no one else would.

1662
02:10:10,685 --> 02:10:13,320
I made a bargain
with the devil.

1663
02:10:13,387 --> 02:10:15,123
Money for time.

1664
02:10:15,189 --> 02:10:17,092
We sold our futures.

1665
02:10:17,159 --> 02:10:20,327
And now you're about to make the
same mistake for the entire world.

1666
02:10:20,394 --> 02:10:23,698
<i>It wasn't a mistake.
I made the bargain I could.</i>

1667
02:10:23,764 --> 02:10:25,100
<i>What was yours?</i>

1668
02:10:25,167 --> 02:10:28,003
<i>You fight for a cause
you barely understand...</i>

1669
02:10:28,070 --> 02:10:31,739
<i>with people you trust so little,
you've told them nothing.</i>

1670
02:10:31,806 --> 02:10:34,142
<i>When I die,
the world dies with me.</i>

1671
02:10:34,241 --> 02:10:36,144
And your knowledge
dies with you,

1672
02:10:36,210 --> 02:10:39,880
<i>buried in a tomb like an
anonymous Egyptian builder</i>

1673
02:10:39,948 --> 02:10:42,550
<i>sealed in a pyramid
to keep his secret.</i>

1674
02:10:42,616 --> 02:10:45,352
Your faith is blind.
You're a fanatic.

1675
02:11:05,539 --> 02:11:08,342
<i>What's more fanatical
than trying to destroy the world?</i>

1676
02:11:08,409 --> 02:11:11,146
I'm not,
I'm creating a new one.

1677
02:11:11,213 --> 02:11:15,683
Somewhere, sometime, a man in a
crystalline tower throws a switch

1678
02:11:15,750 --> 02:11:19,487
and Armageddon
is both triggered and avoided.

1679
02:11:19,553 --> 02:11:23,125
Now time itself
switches direction.

1680
02:11:23,191 --> 02:11:25,326
<i>The same sunshine we basked in</i>

1681
02:11:25,392 --> 02:11:29,530
<i>will warm the faces of our
descendants generations to come.</i>

1682
02:11:29,597 --> 02:11:31,599
How could they wanna kill us?

1683
02:11:31,665 --> 02:11:34,869
Because their oceans rose
and their rivers ran dry.

1684
02:11:34,936 --> 02:11:39,241
<i>Don't you see?
They have no choice but to turn back.</i>

1685
02:11:39,306 --> 02:11:41,475
We're responsible.

1686
02:11:54,722 --> 02:11:57,525
Knowing this,
do you still want me to stop?

1687
02:11:58,759 --> 02:12:00,095
Yes.

1688
02:12:00,162 --> 02:12:02,463
Each generation
looks out for its own survival.

1689
02:12:02,530 --> 02:12:04,465
That's exactly
what they're doing.

1690
02:12:04,532 --> 02:12:06,734
<i>But not you. You're a traitor.</i>

1691
02:12:06,801 --> 02:12:08,335
Bringing death to all,
because you have no life

1692
02:12:08,402 --> 02:12:10,005
of your own left.

1693
02:12:10,071 --> 02:12:11,907
<i>When I'm done, life continues.</i>

1694
02:12:11,973 --> 02:12:13,641
<i>Not your son's.</i>

1695
02:12:13,707 --> 02:12:17,344
My greatest sin was to bring a son
into a world I knew was ending.

1696
02:12:17,411 --> 02:12:19,446
<i>You think God will forgive me?</i>

1697
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:26,420
Wait!

1698
02:12:27,222 --> 02:12:28,422
Wait!

1699
02:12:29,257 --> 02:12:30,758
God...

1700
02:12:42,003 --> 02:12:43,637
Cover me!

1701
02:12:51,345 --> 02:12:53,414
Go! Go! Go!

1702
02:12:54,882 --> 02:12:57,585
You don't believe
in God, or a future,

1703
02:12:57,651 --> 02:12:59,753
or anything outside
of your own experience.

1704
02:12:59,820 --> 02:13:02,924
<i>The rest is belief.</i>

1705
02:13:02,991 --> 02:13:05,392
And I don't have it.

1706
02:13:05,459 --> 02:13:07,461
Without it, you're not human.

1707
02:13:07,528 --> 02:13:09,064
You're just a madman.

1708
02:13:09,763 --> 02:13:11,832
Or a god.

1709
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:12,833
<i>Of sorts.</i>

1710
02:13:12,901 --> 02:13:13,935
Like I said.

1711
02:13:17,138 --> 02:13:19,174
Don't. Jesus.

1712
02:13:19,241 --> 02:13:20,674
Our time is up.

1713
02:13:27,215 --> 02:13:29,650
I'll give your love to my wife.

1714
02:13:29,717 --> 02:13:32,187
You're forgetting.
I haven't met her yet.

1715
02:13:32,254 --> 02:13:33,288
<i>That's right.</i>

1716
02:13:33,355 --> 02:13:34,923
After you meet her, she dies.

1717
02:13:34,990 --> 02:13:37,758
<i>I'll just give her
my love instead.</i>

1718
02:13:38,994 --> 02:13:39,895
Don't do...

1719
02:13:41,363 --> 02:13:42,898
Volkov...

1720
02:13:56,111 --> 02:13:58,146
Enough business,
my love.

1721
02:14:25,106 --> 02:14:28,009
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

1722
02:14:29,978 --> 02:14:32,846
But it sounds
terribly important.

1723
02:14:34,748 --> 02:14:36,217
Where are you going?

1724
02:14:36,284 --> 02:14:37,484
Aren't you hot?

1725
02:14:54,269 --> 02:14:55,636
What are you doing now?

1726
02:14:55,703 --> 02:14:57,571
I spilled sunscreen.

1727
02:14:57,638 --> 02:14:59,707
- So what?
- Slippery!

1728
02:15:02,776 --> 02:15:04,511
Just come here.

1729
02:15:07,514 --> 02:15:08,950
Turn over.

1730
02:15:09,017 --> 02:15:10,517
You'll like it.

1731
02:15:44,752 --> 02:15:47,088
I can't do this.

1732
02:15:47,155 --> 02:15:49,457
- I can't let you think you've won.
- Don't spoil this moment, Kat.

1733
02:15:49,523 --> 02:15:52,559
I'm not letting you go to your grave
thinking we're coming with you.

1734
02:15:55,030 --> 02:15:56,597
You're dying alone, Andrei.

1735
02:15:56,663 --> 02:15:57,932
Come on, come on,
come on!

1736
02:15:57,999 --> 02:16:00,701
Tunnel's sealed,
gate's closed.

1737
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:02,870
Mahir, do you copy?

1738
02:16:02,937 --> 02:16:03,771
Yeah.

1739
02:16:03,837 --> 02:16:05,806
<i>Hold. I repeat, hold!</i>

1740
02:16:11,079 --> 02:16:12,113
Look in my eyes.

1741
02:16:13,547 --> 02:16:15,116
Which do you see?

1742
02:16:16,217 --> 02:16:19,154
Despair or anger?

1743
02:16:20,422 --> 02:16:22,589
I'm not the woman
who could find love for you

1744
02:16:22,656 --> 02:16:24,825
even though you scarred her
on the inside.

1745
02:16:26,261 --> 02:16:30,331
I'm the vengeful bitch
you scarred on the outside.

1746
02:16:33,501 --> 02:16:34,701
No!

1747
02:16:53,654 --> 02:16:55,756
Shit.

1748
02:16:55,823 --> 02:16:57,959
<i>Ives, she's killed him.
Ives, do you copy? She's killed him.</i>

1749
02:16:58,026 --> 02:17:01,096
She jumped the gun.
She killed him.

1750
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:22,016
Come on, come on!
Do you think they made it?

1751
02:17:26,421 --> 02:17:27,754
Ah, screw it.

1752
02:18:38,126 --> 02:18:40,827
<i>Kat!
You jumped the gun!</i>

1753
02:18:40,895 --> 02:18:42,696
I couldn't do it.

1754
02:18:42,763 --> 02:18:44,865
I couldn't let him die
thinking he'd won.

1755
02:18:44,933 --> 02:18:47,734
I knew you'd find a way.

1756
02:18:47,801 --> 02:18:49,736
Wait, you found a way,
we're okay, right?

1757
02:18:49,803 --> 02:18:51,906
<i>Yeah, found a way. Be safe.</i>

1758
02:19:13,695 --> 02:19:15,330
Thought you were inverted.

1759
02:19:15,396 --> 02:19:17,165
Changed gears halfway.

1760
02:19:18,366 --> 02:19:20,201
Looked like you
needed help here.

1761
02:19:20,268 --> 02:19:22,769
Here?
We needed help down there.

1762
02:19:23,804 --> 02:19:25,940
How'd you get that lock open?

1763
02:19:26,007 --> 02:19:28,276
Wasn't me.
Didn't your team need you?

1764
02:19:29,177 --> 02:19:31,112
I'll get 'em on the next pass.

1765
02:19:31,745 --> 02:19:33,181
All right, Ives?

1766
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:35,149
Once I've caught my breath.

1767
02:19:49,130 --> 02:19:51,832
No one who's seen this
leaves the field.

1768
02:20:00,541 --> 02:20:02,143
All right.

1769
02:20:05,546 --> 02:20:07,048
We hide it.

1770
02:20:07,749 --> 02:20:09,884
We end our lives.

1771
02:20:09,951 --> 02:20:12,320
That's the only way to be sure.

1772
02:20:13,921 --> 02:20:16,090
As to when...

1773
02:20:16,157 --> 02:20:18,859
maybe that's every man's
decision to make for himself.

1774
02:20:19,761 --> 02:20:21,062
You're not gonna kill us?

1775
02:20:21,129 --> 02:20:23,698
If I ever find you, I will.

1776
02:20:23,765 --> 02:20:25,333
But you won't look too hard?

1777
02:20:26,367 --> 02:20:27,502
Yes, I will.

1778
02:20:31,139 --> 02:20:33,374
You're not going back to London
to check on Kat, are you?

1779
02:20:33,441 --> 02:20:34,175
No.

1780
02:20:34,242 --> 02:20:36,077
It's far too dangerous.

1781
02:20:36,744 --> 02:20:38,413
Even from afar?

1782
02:20:39,614 --> 02:20:41,149
Even from afar.

1783
02:20:43,384 --> 02:20:44,519
Ives!

1784
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:46,921
Wait.

1785
02:20:52,994 --> 02:20:54,595
Are you really going back in?

1786
02:20:57,098 --> 02:21:00,401
I'm the only one who could've got
that door open in time, right, Ives?

1787
02:21:00,468 --> 02:21:03,237
Well, I don't know any
locksmiths as good as you.

1788
02:21:04,605 --> 02:21:06,407
See?

1789
02:21:06,474 --> 02:21:08,576
It's me in there, again.

1790
02:21:08,643 --> 02:21:11,979
Weaving another past
in the fabric of this mission.

1791
02:21:20,455 --> 02:21:21,322
Neil, wait!

1792
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:27,795
Just saved the world.

1793
02:21:27,861 --> 02:21:30,164
Can't leave anything to chance.

1794
02:21:30,231 --> 02:21:33,101
But can we change things
if we do it differently?

1795
02:21:33,167 --> 02:21:35,403
"What's happened's happened."

1796
02:21:35,470 --> 02:21:39,140
Which is an expression of faith
in the mechanics of the world.

1797
02:21:39,207 --> 02:21:41,042
It's not an excuse
to do nothing.

1798
02:21:41,509 --> 02:21:42,443
Fate?

1799
02:21:42,510 --> 02:21:44,078
Call it what you want.

1800
02:21:44,145 --> 02:21:45,346
What do you call it?

1801
02:21:46,247 --> 02:21:47,348
Reality.

1802
02:21:49,884 --> 02:21:51,319
Now let me go.

1803
02:21:56,691 --> 02:21:59,594
Hey, you never did tell me
who recruited you, Neil.

1804
02:21:59,660 --> 02:22:01,429
Haven't you guessed by now?

1805
02:22:02,430 --> 02:22:03,931
You did.

1806
02:22:03,998 --> 02:22:06,701
Only not when you thought.

1807
02:22:06,768 --> 02:22:09,103
You have a future in the past.

1808
02:22:09,170 --> 02:22:12,340
Years ago for me.
Years from now for you.

1809
02:22:13,174 --> 02:22:14,909
You've known me for years?

1810
02:22:16,411 --> 02:22:20,281
For me, I think this is the end
of a beautiful friendship.

1811
02:22:20,348 --> 02:22:22,885
But for me,
it's just the beginning.

1812
02:22:22,950 --> 02:22:25,153
We get up to some stuff.

1813
02:22:25,219 --> 02:22:28,423
You're gonna love it.
You'll see.

1814
02:22:28,489 --> 02:22:31,092
This whole operation's
a temporal pincer.

1815
02:22:31,559 --> 02:22:32,960
Whose?

1816
02:22:34,328 --> 02:22:35,898
Yours!

1817
02:22:35,963 --> 02:22:37,465
You're only halfway there.

1818
02:22:37,532 --> 02:22:39,567
I'll see you
at the beginning, friend.

1819
02:22:48,009 --> 02:22:51,412
<i>We're the people saving the
world from what might have been.</i>

1820
02:22:51,479 --> 02:22:53,414
<i>World will never know
what could've happened.</i>

1821
02:22:55,283 --> 02:22:58,319
<i>And even if they did,
they wouldn't care.</i>

1822
02:23:02,156 --> 02:23:04,959
<i>'Cause no one cares about
the bomb that didn't go off.</i>

1823
02:23:05,726 --> 02:23:07,562
<i>Only the one that did.</i>

1824
02:23:10,064 --> 02:23:11,199
Do it before the boy comes out.

1825
02:23:13,936 --> 02:23:17,238
That's your idea of mercy?
You gave me your word.

1826
02:23:17,305 --> 02:23:20,875
And I told you then
what it would be worth.

1827
02:23:20,943 --> 02:23:23,044
Here, today.

1828
02:23:24,145 --> 02:23:27,381
How did you know?

1829
02:23:27,448 --> 02:23:30,852
<i>Cannon Place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...</i>

1830
02:23:30,919 --> 02:23:32,220
Posterity.

1831
02:23:32,286 --> 02:23:35,891
Cannon Place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...

1832
02:23:35,958 --> 02:23:39,727
I told you you'd have to start
looking differently at the world.

1833
02:23:39,794 --> 02:23:42,864
- I have to tie up the loose ends.
- That was never your job.

1834
02:23:42,931 --> 02:23:44,065
Then whose was it?

1835
02:23:44,131 --> 02:23:46,033
Mine.

1836
02:23:46,100 --> 02:23:49,570
I realized I wasn't working for you.
We've both been working for me.

1837
02:23:49,637 --> 02:23:51,506
I'm the protagonist.

1838
02:23:53,741 --> 02:23:57,078
Then you'd better tie up
those loose ends.

1839
02:23:59,847 --> 02:24:01,382
Mission accomplished.

1840
02:24:03,251 --> 02:24:05,486
<i>It's the bomb that
didn't go off.</i>

1841
02:24:05,553 --> 02:24:08,322
<i>The danger no one knew
was real.</i>

1842
02:24:13,361 --> 02:24:16,631
<i>That's the bomb with the real
power to change the world.</i>

1843
02:24:27,186 --> 02:24:32,186
