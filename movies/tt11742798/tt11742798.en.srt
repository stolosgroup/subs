<i>It's 75 degrees in sunny San Diego</i>,

3
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:23,208
<i>and the number one song of the day

It's an impromptu dance party
with my best friend since first grade!

15
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,875
Because it's your birthday!

16
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,208
Ah, ah.

17
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,541
Go, go. Work, work. Drop it low. Oh.

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,625
I love this song, but I'm very hungry.

19
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,458
Okay, I need your help.

20
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:24,166
Question. What do you think?
Quarter-life chic? Or quarter-life crisis?

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,041
Huh. Well, right now,
you're matching the lamp, so...

22
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,208
- Would a hat help?
- No.

23
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,208
Rude!

24
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,291
- Here.
- Thank you.

25
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,541
Okay, for my Cassie-palooza kickoff night,
we are gonna start off at the club

26
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,500
where I've spent all afternoon
decorating the VIP area.

27
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:42,125
- Hey, I have this crazy idea.
- I'm listening.

28
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,125
Instead of going out for your birthday,
what if we just stay home,

29
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:49,125
and we put on our stretchy pants,
and we puzzle like we used to,

30
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,625
and we order more noodles?

31
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,748
No, no. We're not staying in.
It's my birthday week.

32
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,750
I have to ring in 25 with style!

33
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,500
You've rung in the past four years
with style. One night in won't kill you.

34
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,666
Besides, we haven't puzzled in weeks.
I mean, look at Mona.

35
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,458
She is missing her smile,
and it's kind of depressing.

36
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,416
I'm not bailing on my kickoff party.
It is tradition. My friends expect this.

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,541
Well, your best friend
has a huge week ahead of her.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,375
I was just added
as one of the junior research assistants

39
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,375
on a team studying marsupial fossil teeth.

40
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,791
I don't fully understand what that means,
but congratulations!

41
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,375
I'm one of three assistants,
so it's really not a big...

42
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,708
No, no! It is a big deal.
You should celebrate.

43
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:28,833
- Because guess what?
- Tonight is... a celebration!

44
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,500
Okay. I'm gonna go change. Again.

45
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,750
So should you.
Tonight'll be fun, I promise.

46
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,083
We leave in an hour-ish.

47
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,083
Love you, my bestie since we were six!

48
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:37,958
Okay.

49
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,250
Whoo! Did I tell you how cute you look
by the way?

50
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,541
Uh, yeah, I think you did,
like, 19 times. Got it.

51
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,083
Good. I meant it every single time.
You look adorable.

52
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,791
- I love this dress on you.
- Thank you. So, who's coming tonight?

53
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,083
Okay. So Kayla's coming. Maddie's coming.

54
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,416
Moving in?

55
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,291
Oh, hi.

56
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,791
Of course you're moving in.
I don't know why I just said that.

57
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,708
Hi, we're your neighbors.

58
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,666
I'm Cassie, and my quiet
but highly intelligent roommate is...

59
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,333
Lisa. Lisa.

60
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,583
Um, I'm around dinosaur bones all day,

61
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,291
so I'm not really
used to talking to people that much.

62
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,750
- Right.
- Works in the Museum of Natural History.

63
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:17,250
Oh wow! Yeah,
I compose music for video games all day,

64
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,250
so not a lot of human interaction
for me either.

65
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,500
Oh.

66
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,333
Sorry, I'm Max, by the way.

67
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,625
Ordinarily, I'd shake your hand,
but I'd almost certainly drop this,

68
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,041
um, and I desperately need these dishes.

69
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,583
- Oh! Here. Let me open the door for you.
- Brilliant. Cool.

70
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,583
Cool.

71
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,541
Okay, we've gotta go,
but, um, welcome to the neighborhood, Max.

72
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,416
- Yeah, thanks. See ya.
- Yeah. Yeah.

73
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
- Oh, don't give me that look.
- What look? I wasn't giving a look.

74
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,083
- You wanna play matchmaker?
- I didn't say that.

75
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,416
Since you mentioned it,
I did notice a spark.

76
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,875
- There was a spark?
- Mm!

77
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,458
No, there was no spark.

78
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,916
I'm... I'm really focused on work right now,
and I can't have any distractions.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,750
Not even in the form of our new neighbor
and his cute accent?

80
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,875
I'm not like you.

81
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,666
- Okay.
- No, no!

82
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,250
I just mean you can juggle a social life.
That's not me.

83
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,583
Yeah, well, I'm a party planner.
It's built into the job.

84
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,208
Well, I'm on a path here.

85
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,750
Nail this junior research position,
get promoted to field researcher,

86
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,958
and then work alongside
my paleontologist hero.

87
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,125
Hey, I wanna introduce you
to my friend Fun.

88
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,125
I don't know if you two have ever met.

89
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,416
Let me get through
all of this stuff first, okay?

90
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,708
Ugh.

91
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,375
Downward Dad is out of control.
He posts a different pose every day.

92
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,166
- I liked his flying crow.
- Okay, do not encourage him.

93
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,416
What? Wait. It's not just me. Do you see
how many people like his yoga studio?

94
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Oh, I know. I've heard from everyone
how amazing his classes are.

95
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,916
We should take one.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, I'm good.

97
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,541
I got enough secondhand yoga from him
growing up that I am centered for life.

98
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,083
I think it's sweet
that he's on social media.

99
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,846
It's like he's trying to connect with you.

100
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, I love him,
but he's my dad, not my buddy.

101
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,875
I'm fine with our lives being separate.

102
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:07,583
Okay. Well, if you just left one comment,
it would probably make his day.

103
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:12,833
Fine. I'll throw him a like,
but no comment.

104
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:13,916
- You happy?
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,250
So this is, like,
our 19th Cassie-palooza kickoff.

106
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,813
It's gonna be the best ever!

107
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,041
Hey, Bob.

108
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,458
Good evening, Cassie.

109
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,625
- Thank you.
- Ladies, welcome.

110
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,958
She's my favorite person.
I love her so much.

111
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,083
Cassie's here!

112
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,791
- Wow. This is actually really pretty.
- Hi!

113
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,083
- Happy birthday, Cassie!
- Whoo!

114
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,541
Happy birthday!
It's so good to see you.

115
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,875
It's not my birthday, Jeremy.
Not my birthday.

116
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,041
You are the best!

117
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,458
Yes!

118
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,125
Cheers!

119
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,750
Cassie! Drink, drink, drink!

120
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,331
It's our song.

121
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,750
- It's Koop!
- Yeah.

122
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,166
- We have to dance!
- Okay.

123
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,250
Come on! Come on!

- Oh yeah!

145
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,333
- So much fun! You!
- You kept drinking shots.

146
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,875
Because you kept handing them to me!

147
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,333
You're crazy! You're...
I can't keep up with you.

148
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,541
Okay, you guys,
next stop is Roddy's house.

149
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:44,166
I rented a waterslide
that goes from the roof into his pool!

150
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,625
Let's go!

151
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,208
What's wrong?

152
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,500
Ugh.

153
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,416
You're bailing, aren't you?

154
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,583
I bet you no one would notice
if we snuck back home right now.

155
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,875
I would notice!

156
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,916
You know
that these people are terrible, right?

157
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,208
They're just trying to have a good time,
which is exactly what you should be doing!

158
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,583
- Come on.
- I like having a good time too.

159
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,583
Only I wanna do it

160
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,017
with people who'd actually care
if something happened to me,

161
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:18,666
or who would like me even if I didn't rent
a very dangerous waterslide.

162
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,916
Don't tell me you're jealous.

163
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,750
I am not jealous
of people who look filtered 24/7.

164
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,666
I don't know!
Kinda sounds like you're jealous to me!

165
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,041
- Come on, Cassie, let's go!
- Okay, one second!

166
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,541
You know,
you're different when you're with them.

167
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,458
I'm what?

168
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,833
It's like you think you aren't
worth anything if you aren't seen.

169
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:44,833
Well, at least I'm out making friends,
and I'm not hiding at my desk.

170
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,583
Because I think
that there is more to life than partying

171
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,833
or knowing
all the names of bartenders in town.

172
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,375
Here we go! My life isn't as important
because it's social.

173
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,338
Just because
I'm not one of your science friends

174
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,625
doesn't mean I don't work hard.

175
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,458
- I didn't say that!
- But you meant it!

176
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,458
I see how you only pretend
to be interested

177
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,333
when I tell you about some event I planned

178
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,041
or your offhanded comments
about how I'm never home.

179
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,291
Like you don't pretend
to understand my life?

180
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,416
Tell me what I do.

181
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,166
You work at the museum.

182
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,916
But what do I do there?

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,720
I don't know.
I don't understand that stuff.

184
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,458
And I don't understand your stuff.

185
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,500
Classic.

186
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,375
We never hang out anymore.

187
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,375
Just the two of us.

188
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,875
We're busy. We'll just have to get better
at making time for each other.

189
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,750
I don't know, Cassie. I don't think
being friends should feel like work.

190
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,875
I don't think it does, Lisa.

191
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,083
But I can tell from your face that you do.

192
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,625
It's fine.

193
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,208
I don't wanna stay best friends
out of habit anyway.

194
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,083
I'm a habit?

195
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,000
Th... That's it?

196
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,267
You're just gonna say something like that
and walk away?

197
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,291
Maybe it's time we both admit
that we've outgrown each other.

198
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,166
Who's ready to go to Roddy's?

199
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,083
Let's do it.
Sorry about that, guys.

200
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,791
Aw.

201
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,750
Mona's missing her smile.

202
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,375
Hmm.

203
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,708
Here's one.

204
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,500
Put this here.

205
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,416
That'll fix it.

206
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,458
Oh no.

207
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,083
No, no, no, no.

208
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,625
No. No, no, no.

209
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,958
So stupid.

210
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,750
So stupid.

211
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,750
Ow!

212
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,625
Ugh.

213
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,541
Ow!

214
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,625
Ugh.

215
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,250
Uh, hi.

216
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,250
Excuse me?

217
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,291
Did that go viral?

218
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,500
Oh, you're awake!

219
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,250
Welcome. Welcome.

220
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,875
No, no, don't worry.
No, it's research. It's not gone viral.

221
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,958
I'm Val.

222
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,333
I'll be your handler
through this transition.

223
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,791
Well, it's nice to finally meet you,
Miss Cassandra Adeline Garcia.

224
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:54,416
Now, according to my notes,
you go by Cassie. You're 25...

225
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,041
- In a few days.
- Huh?

226
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,291
Parents, Howie and Sofia, divorced.

227
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,958
Born May 31st, died May 25th.

228
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,041
Died?

229
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,500
Oh, I'm sorry. Died May 26th.

230
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,333
Who... who are you?

231
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:12,041
I'm Val. Otherwise known
as your temporary guardian angel.

232
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,458
You don't look like a guardian angel.
Shouldn't you have a halo?

233
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,750
- Oh, special occasions only.
- Okay, what about wings?

234
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,583
Oh, no, we phased those out years ago.

235
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,791
Okay.
This... this can't really be happening.

236
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,416
I was... I was just with my friends.

237
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,666
Oh! I know!

238
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,750
I... I had...
I had champagne with gold flakes in it,

239
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,166
and sometimes it makes you hallucinate.
I'm hallucinating.

240
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,000
No. This isn't a hallucination.

241
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,458
Oh, this... this part's always hard.

242
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,791
How can I put this?

243
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,958
Yeah, um, you died.

244
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,250
- Stop saying that!
- I mean, you saw it yourself, so...

245
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,958
- I died in the bathroom?
- Yeah.

246
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,708
Oh! Oh, this keeps getting worse!

247
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:58,833
Look, it's going to be okay.

248
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,000
And the good news is that
the worst is over now that you're d...

249
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,041
No longer living.

250
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,875
You don't have to deal
with all of those human annoyances,

251
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,875
you know, like heartbreak or PMS.

252
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,291
Just think of the afterlife
as one long spa day.

253
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,625
And if you're one of the lucky ones,
it could last for an eternity.

254
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,416
So, I went up?

255
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,708
- Well...
- Is this down? I went down?

256
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,125
You're in the middle.

257
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,750
We call this the In-Between.

258
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,208
So like general admission?

259
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,250
Sure. This is your personal waiting room.

260
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,000
It's your safe space.

261
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,916
It's designed specifically to your taste

262
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,125
to make your transition
more... comfortable.

263
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,833
So everyone who dies is in the In-Between?

264
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:52,041
Oh no. No, no, no.
Maybe I should give you a pamphlet.

265
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,458
No, no!
I don't need a pamphlet. Just tell me.

266
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,541
It can't be crazier
than anything that's happening.

267
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:01,375
Well, the In-Between
is for those who have unfinished business

268
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,458
back on Earth,

269
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,875
like yourself.

270
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,458
What unfinished business?

271
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,458
Well, you get a second chance
to make things right

272
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,041
with a select list of people,

273
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,375
you know, and if you succeed,
you get sent to the Above.

274
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,416
And if you don't, well, you know, it's...

275
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:21,000
it's just, it's... Yeah, it's, you know...

276
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,333
- It's... Yeah.
- It...

277
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,458
Yeah.

278
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:27,541
But I thought it was for murderers
and people who don't like Beyoncé.

279
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,083
- I'm a proud member of the Beyhive.
- Yeah.

280
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,166
No, no, it's a tiered system. Yeah.

281
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,333
You want the Above. Trust me.

282
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,125
You ready to meet your list?

283
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,458
Now? No. I'm not ready! Oh!

284
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,125
Oh!

285
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,375
That was like riding a roller coaster
backwards and blindfolded.

286
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,083
You get used to it.

287
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,250
Wait, we're at my dad's house.

288
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,583
Hey, Dad!

289
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,250
Hey.

290
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,333
Hey!

291
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,583
Why isn't he responding?

292
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,583
He can't see or hear you.

293
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,791
No one can.

294
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,708
What? No, that can't be right.

295
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,541
Well, we can't risk
scaring people on Earth.

296
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,958
They're so fragile.

297
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,208
Hello? Dad?

298
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,583
It's me! It's Cassie,
your favorite and only child.

299
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,916
He never let me eat junk food.

300
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,083
What is goin' on?

301
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,208
And why is this house such a mess?

302
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,541
This... this is not like him.

303
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,750
He's Downward Dad.
He's all about healthy living,

304
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,583
and he even makes his own kombucha.

305
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,208
How long have I been gone?

306
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:11,833
Val, how long?

307
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,958
- A year.
- A year?

308
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,833
It feels like a day.

309
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,708
Well, time works differently up there.

310
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,500
Maybe I should've taken a pamphlet.

311
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,583
Hmm.

312
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,791
The last time he was like this
was when my mom left.

313
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,500
After you passed,

314
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,541
he gave up.

315
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,750
When was the last time you saw him?

316
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,750
I... I don't know. I...

317
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,833
I kept meaning to visit,
but there were all these events.

318
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,625
I liked one of his posts. Does that count?

319
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,291
Mmm.

320
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,375
Yeah.

321
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,958
Is that why he's on my list?

322
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,625
He's in mourning.

323
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,791
He needs a reason to feel hopeful again.

324
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,541
Tell me what I should do.

325
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,541
You should see the rest of your list.

326
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,916
Lisa? Really, Val? No. Pass. Hard pass.

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,875
There is no hard pass.

328
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,875
There isn't even a regular pass.

329
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,458
What about if I kill it with my dad?
Not kill kill. You know what I mean.

330
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,125
Can we pretend Lisa isn't on the list?

331
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,666
Why are you so afraid
of seeing your best friend again?

332
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,291
- My former BFF, and I'm not.
- Mm.

333
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,166
There's too much history between us.

334
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,375
Besides, I don't know if I want to.
Some friendships just end, you know?

335
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,791
Shouldn't I have a say
in who's on my list?

336
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,625
This is my afterlife we're talking about.

337
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,916
She's been hiding
in her work ever since you left.

338
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,958
Last one out. It's the same every day.

339
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,708
How about we skip Lisa
and move to the next name?

340
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,375
- I'll take it. No complaints. Pinky swear.
- No. I don't do that.

341
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,083
But I will show you
who's next on your list.

342
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,506
Please be Koop.
Please be Koop. Please be Koop.

343
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,791
How are you doing that?

344
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,666
Oh, you can do it too.
It's all part of your basic angel package.

345
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,458
You just focus on where you want to go,
give a little snap or a nod.

346
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,375
One angel I know likes to wink.

347
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,666
Just make it your own.
And then you're there.

348
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,125
So, I can go anywhere?

349
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,291
Oh, no, not anywhere.

350
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:17,083
Your teleporting is limited
to places that you're needed only.

351
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,333
No detours.

352
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,708
- Got it.
- Right.

353
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,708
Now, back to the list.

354
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:26,708
- Ugh. I don't know if I'm ready for more.
- Morgan, slow down!

355
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,184
Wait for Mommy!

356
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,083
- Hi, you're so fast.
- Oh.

357
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,958
- That's...
- Your mother.

358
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,541
I haven't called her that
since the day she moved out.

359
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,666
She's Sofia to me.

360
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,125
Is that my half sister?

361
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,458
I've never met her.

362
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:55,375
So, you do have
some unfinished business, then.

363
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,083
Can we go now, please?

364
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,750
It's only three names.

365
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,125
Not easy ones.

366
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,125
Oh, you can do this, Cassie.

367
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,166
- I believe in you.
- That makes one of us.

368
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,083
You have the five Earth days leading up
to your birthday to complete this list.

369
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,625
Wait, five days?

370
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:26,875
Oh.

371
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,875
Sure. Why not? Hey, you know what?
Why don't we make it two days?

372
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,208
Or better yet,
we can just cram it all into one!

373
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,750
Well, just think of it as Cassie-palooza,
the afterlife edition.

374
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,208
It's...

375
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,125
It's... it's like Cassie...

376
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,208
No. No, you're right. Yeah.

377
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,291
Okay, right.

378
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,416
Right, so a name will disappear

379
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,083
each time
it's deemed that you have closure.

380
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,125
How am I supposed to do this
if I can't communicate?

381
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,875
Well, you'll find a way.

382
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,208
Can I text? Tweet? TikTok?

383
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,583
No, no, and definitely negatory.

384
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,166
Do I at least get cool superpowers,
like mind control or something?

385
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,416
It's guardian-angel level only.

386
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,791
This is about you learning
to really connect

387
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,333
with the people closest to you.

388
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,750
Yeah, and what if I can't?

389
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,750
Well, I'll be here if you need me.

390
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,000
Except between noon and 4:00.

391
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:23,166
I'm kidding. It's a joke.

392
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,291
Look, I'm always going to be here for you.

393
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:32,125
Now,
is there anything else before go time?

394
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,250
Well,

395
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,291
actually, I, um...

396
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:43,750
I was wondering...

397
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,833
Yeah, yeah. I know what you're thinking.

398
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,208
And, uh, yes,

399
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,250
you do get a wardrobe change.

400
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,916
Yeah, yeah. You just close your eyes
and envision what you want to wear.

401
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But just so you know, you only get
one wardrobe change a day,

402
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,375
so make it count.

403
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,166
It's so sparkly.

404
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,833
I think this might be
my favorite part about being here.

405
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Oh.

406
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,250
I guess it really is time.

407
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:54,541
Somebody call Marie Kondo
because joy is <i>not </i>sparking here.

408
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,250
Lisa first.

409
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,541
Great.

410
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,083
Guess I'm ripping the Band-Aid off.

411
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,625
Okay.

412
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:23,708
What would Val do?

413
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,125
Um...

414
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:41,375
I did it.

415
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,375
What the gamer geek?

416
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:04,875
Who are you,
and what did you do to my room?

417
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,250
Hey.

418
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,208
Oh.

419
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,125
Oh, the cute neighbor still lives here.
Are you two in love yet?

420
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,500
- Hey, you.
- Hey. Morning.

421
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,458
- Are you just getting home now?
- Yeah.

422
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:32,916
I'm, uh, in the process
of scoring this game

423
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,125
about, uh, post-apocalyptic,
motorcycle-riding zombie Vikings.

424
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,458
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

425
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:40,791
It sounds lame now I'm saying it out loud,
but it's pretty dope

426
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:45,083
if post-apocalyptic, motorcycle-riding
zombie Vikings are your thing.

427
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,458
You're heading to work early.
Oh, no watch.

428
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,041
Yeah, yeah, I, um...

429
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,791
I like getting to work
before everybody else, you know?

430
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,250
The calm is... is, um...

431
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,375
Calming.

432
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,375
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

433
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:58,875
- You get it.
- Yeah, I do.

434
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:00,250
Yeah.

435
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:06,583
Cool, well, hopefully one day,
when our schedules can align,

436
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,958
um, we can properly hang out? Me and you?

437
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:10,625
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

438
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,666
- Yeah, okay. Okay. Yes, yes.
- Yeah.

439
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,041
- Yeah, I would... I would like that.
- Brilliant.

440
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,083
- Okay, well, um, I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.

441
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,416
- Cool. Well, have a good day.
- Thank you. You too.

442
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,125
- Good seeing you. Bye.
- Bye.

443
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:24,583
It's been a year,
and you still haven't gone out with him?

444
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,458
It is a good thing I'm back.

445
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:31,958
So the way we ended things...
Talk about bad timing!

446
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,458
Are you still mad at me?

447
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:39,500
I know I should still be mad at you,
but it doesn't feel right anymore.

448
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,875
When did this place open?

449
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,958
Ugh! I hate being so out of touch!

450
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,541
Morning, Emme. How are you?

451
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,083
Hi. I've got your order waiting.

452
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,916
Oh my... Emme, you spoil me.

453
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,708
Who is Emme? I know all your friends,
and I don't know her.

454
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:58,750
- Okay.
- Ta-da!

455
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:02,000
Oh. Ooh. What is that smell?

456
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:06,291
I'm working on a new brownie recipe.
They're just out of the oven. Wanna try?

457
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,041
I will always be your guinea pig.

458
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:17,958
So, um, how has everything been?
Are you feeling a little bit more settled?

459
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,125
Things are good.

460
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:22,500
Haven't seen much of the town yet.
I should probably get out more.

461
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:25,083
Baked goods
aren't the best conversationalists.

462
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,041
Well, neither are bones.

463
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,875
I am thinking of throwing
a one-year anniversary party for the shop.

464
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,750
That would be so cool.

465
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:34,833
Careful. It's hot.

466
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:36,958
- Oh!
- Okay.

467
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,791
I miss brownies. Why couldn't
I have had death by chocolate?

468
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,791
Wow. Wow.
I mean, this is... this is incredible.

469
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:46,208
Oh, it's made with love. And agave.

470
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,041
I need to go to work, but thank you.
I'll see you later, okay?

471
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,208
- Ciao for now.
- Bye!

472
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,291
Bye.

473
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:02,041
So, how's your list coming along?

474
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,083
The quiet type, huh?

475
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,291
So...

476
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:27,041
this is your life now.

477
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:34,791
Okay.

478
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,791
You beat me to work. Again.

479
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,708
Oh, jumpy.

480
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,125
Are you on something?

481
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,625
Next time,
bring enough for the whole class!

482
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:51,458
Yeah.

483
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,976
- What do you want, Raj?
- Did you hear?

484
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,833
Uh, hear what?

485
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:57,416
Dr. Redding's leading a dig
at Hell's Creek this summer,

486
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,166
and she's looking
for a junior field researcher to join.

487
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,583
Wait, Dr. Marion Redding?
Are you messing with me?

488
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:05,250
Not only that, the GOAT herself
is coming into the office

489
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:08,083
to hold interviews.
I'm about to go sign up over at the...

490
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:10,791
break room.

491
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,375
A sign-up sheet.

492
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,000
How retro. But I dig it.

493
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:23,166
What are you waiting for?
Just write your name.

494
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:25,666
L-I...

495
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,916
Pretty competitive, huh?

496
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,083
And she's only picking one person.

497
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,833
I think we all know who that'll be.

498
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,166
R-A-J.

499
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,750
B-R-I-T-T-O.

500
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,375
Ooh.

501
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,458
Only four spots left.

502
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,916
Don't listen. He's trying to psych you out
in the lamest way possible.

503
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,708
I'm gonna sign up later.

504
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:49,916
I have a lot of work to do,

505
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,750
so I can't really think
about this kind of thing right now.

506
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:54,375
Sure.

507
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:56,708
You're giving up?

508
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,541
In the bag, Britto.

509
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:02,916
What's so important?

510
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,166
I left a farmer in his barn-themed
waiting room for you. Are you okay?

511
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,666
It... it's Lisa. She's so stubborn.

512
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,583
You know,
I don't think this is gonna work.

513
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:14,791
She doesn't seem to miss me.
There's no trace of me anywhere.

514
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:18,750
Oh, and get this. I've been replaced
by this roommate who is full-on dark web.

515
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:23,083
- Why aren't you saying anything?
- You're saying enough for the both of us.

516
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:27,208
Look, I know going back is hard,

517
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:29,041
but you aren't forgotten.

518
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,708
Oh, I don't know about that.

519
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:36,041
Well, maybe if we cut out
all the "I"s and "me"s and look harder,

520
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:38,666
you'll find
that she actually does need you.

521
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:41,708
Whoa!

522
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:54,916
Why are you sleeping?

523
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,583
There is a whole world out there,
and you are missing it.

524
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,875
Lisa. Lisa, wake up.

525
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,291
I need to talk to you.

526
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:08,958
Lisa, wake up!

527
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,583
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

528
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:15,666
Wake up! Wake up!

529
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,333
Come on, Val. This isn't fair.

530
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:22,375
How am I supposed to do this
if my best friend can't see or hear me?

531
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,166
I need a little help here, please!

532
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:47,041
Piper, turn down your game.

533
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,083
Trying to sleep.

534
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:08,208
Why won't you let me sleep?

535
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:25,875
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

536
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:27,791
Oh, but it worked!

537
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,791
You can't be... you can't be here. No.

538
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,333
Oh, you can see me?

539
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:33,791
This is a dream. Maybe a nightmare.

540
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,708
Work... work... work has been stressful.

541
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:37,500
You can hear me too?

542
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,500
This isn't supposed to be happening.

543
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:44,375
This is awesome,
and crazy, but mostly awesome.

544
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,708
You aren't here. Nope. You died.

545
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,916
Yeah, that sucked.

546
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:51,375
I don't believe in whatever you are.

547
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,833
I'm nothing scary!
I'm like a junior guardian angel.

548
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,000
Well, not officially.
I don't know if that's a thing,

549
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,833
but that's how I make sense of it.
Titles aren't important right now.

550
00:33:58,916 --> 00:33:59,916
Oh.

551
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,125
I'll be back.

552
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,916
Not... not in an ominous way! In a good way.

553
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,875
It's really nice
to be able to talk to you again.

554
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:16,041
Please be gone. Please be...

555
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,666
Sorry for interrupting, but you'll never
believe what happened. Lisa...

556
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,333
Can see and hear you. Yep. Yep.
Everyone knows. You're trending.

557
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,583
I've heard rumors of this,
but I've never experienced it.

558
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:43,916
Making contact used to be fairly common,

559
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,875
but now, with all the distractions,
it's practically non-existent.

560
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:48,958
Well, it happened.

561
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:52,333
You never forget the first time
your friend looks at you in sheer terror.

562
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,708
Everyone's staring at me
like I'm a unicorn.

563
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:10,083
This is the Angels' Den.

564
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,041
It's the central command
of the In-Between.

565
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:14,583
Unicorns are in a different area.

566
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,541
A book? Really?

567
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,583
Yes. Don't you just love books?

568
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,250
Okay.

569
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,500
Mm. Here.

570
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,458
Yep, yep, yep. There we are.

571
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,333
Okay. It's quite rare.

572
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:42,500
"Said In-Betweener can only affect
the physical world

573
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,416
once visible to subject."

574
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,458
"It mainly happens in cases

575
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:49,666
where the people involved
were extraordinarily connected."

576
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,625
"Some call it soul mates
or kindred spirits."

577
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,375
So,

578
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:00,500
it might be a fluke in the system,

579
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,500
or it's just you and Lisa.

580
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,416
- We should test it.
- Okay.

581
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:13,958
Go on, then. Start talking to someone.
Let's see what happens.

582
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,916
Okay. Hey! What's up?

583
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:19,250
Go on.

584
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,083
Hey, guys. How's it goin'?

585
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:29,708
Hello?

586
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:38,625
Hey, ladies!
Ooh! I like your shoes.

587
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:41,500
No? Nothing?

588
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,125
Okay. No one's responding.

589
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:50,083
I'm usually the center of the party,
not on the sidelines. This feels odd.

590
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,291
You seem strangely cheerful for someone
trying to solve a fluke in the system.

591
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,416
There's just so much energy.

592
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,875
Isn't it beautiful?

593
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:04,250
You know the saying
"angel on your shoulder"?

594
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:05,833
That's who I want to be.

595
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,583
A guardian angel who's there
through all of these stages of life.

596
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,125
Not just at the end.

597
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:13,791
So why don't you?

598
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,125
It's not my decision to make.

599
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:21,875
Oh.

600
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:26,500
Is this dog barking at me?

601
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:28,833
Oh, he can see you!

602
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,375
Yeah. Animals are more open
to the spiritual world.

603
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,750
Some kids are too.

604
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:36,750
No, poppet, we're working.
Go back to your owner.

605
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:39,625
Go on.

606
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,625
So we can talk to animals?

607
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:47,875
Not we. I can.
Yeah, it's above your power grade.

608
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,500
- Oh.
- Sorry.

609
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:53,500
Right, so nothing from strangers.

610
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:56,083
- Nope.
- That's good, actually. Less cleanup.

611
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,333
We should try someone close to you.

612
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,750
Not much to report
since I talked to you last.

613
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,208
Is he trying to talk to me?

614
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:18,708
I stopped seeing
that woman I told you about, Maria.

615
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,958
She's nice. I'm just not ready yet.

616
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:25,958
He's been doing this since you left.
Brings him comfort.

617
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:27,750
This whole room does.

618
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,791
The yoga studio's doing fine.

619
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:36,916
I'm still more focused on running it
than teaching.

620
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:42,541
There's been requests for me to teach
my sunrise class again. I probably should.

621
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:46,750
I just feel so guilty going on like normal
when you can't.

622
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,666
I miss you, kiddo.

623
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,583
All I ever wanted was to protect you,
and I couldn't even do that.

624
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,458
Oh, Dad, but you did.

625
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:02,458
Remember that song I used to sing to you
when you were little?

626
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,208
I don't remember.

627
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:07,958
Try. Maybe I will.

628
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,916
That was a long time ago.

629
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:40,625
I'm sorry for not visiting much.

630
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:44,791
For making fun of your Downward Dad posts.

631
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,708
I'm gonna let you know I'm okay.

632
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
Somehow.

633
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,166
We can try your mum.

634
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,500
I'm not ready for her yet.

635
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm going back to Lisa. I wanna fix this.

636
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:14,208
It'll be day two, so make it count.

637
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:24,458
I'm clearly just having a stroke.

638
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,458
Wait, Lisa, wait!

639
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,625
- You felt that too?
- This isn't happening.

640
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,791
Let me explain, okay? Or at least try.

641
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:37,500
Uh, there's this list. And for me
to get to the big party in the sky...

642
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:38,666
Go away.

643
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,458
A door? Really?

644
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,083
Oh, come on!

645
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:49,458
Let's analyze some fossils. Whoo!

646
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:53,541
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.

647
00:40:56,708 --> 00:41:00,333
Okay. If you don't wanna talk right now,
then we don't have to. Fine.

648
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But I'm not going anywhere until we do.

649
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,625
No, no. I'm just working too hard.

650
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:15,666
Because I'm working hard,
it could cause the visions.

651
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,000
Okay. I'm sick! So sick. I'm sick.

652
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:22,375
- Otherwise, it doesn't make sense.
- Maybe not, but it's happening.

653
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:25,416
Don't be shy. Come and try.

654
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,583
Why wait till it's too late?

655
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:32,166
Uh-oh. You look like you could do with
a caramel mocha pretzel bite.

656
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:33,833
Okay.

657
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:36,291
Or two.

658
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:38,666
Let's get you inside.

659
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:43,250
This place has so much potential,
but what is with all the doilies?

660
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:44,916
Would you like a calming tea or...

661
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,958
No. I... I don't need calming.

662
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:50,500
I need an exorcist.

663
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:53,125
Well, I can't help you with that.

664
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:55,083
Okay. So, um,

665
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:58,111
this is the one-year anniversary
of my best friend's death.

666
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:01,892
- I think it's making me a little crazy.
- Your flatmate, the one you told me about?

667
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:03,625
- You told her about me?
- Yeah, Cassie.

668
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:06,708
This is gonna sound really weird, but, um,

669
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,583
she talks to me, and...

670
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:11,458
...I can see her.

671
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,541
That doesn't sound weird at all.
She was your best mate. She's part of you.

672
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:19,434
Thank you for letting me lay this on you.

673
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:22,666
I just... I really, really needed
to talk to someone.

674
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,583
Is she here now?

675
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:26,458
- Boo!
- Uh-huh.

676
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,791
- Yeah. Yeah. She, uh...
- Oh.

677
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:31,166
...she thinks your store needs a makeover.

678
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,125
Oh! Well, I'm open to anything
that will encourage people to hang out.

679
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:36,750
See? She agrees with me.
I'm starting to like this Emme.

680
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:39,583
Look, everyone deals with grief
in their own way.

681
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:43,541
- It's a compliment when they come back.
- This doesn't feel like a compliment.

682
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:49,501
- Would your friend like an eclair?
- Don't... don't encourage her, please.

683
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,833
Thank you for understanding, Emme.
Thank you. I just...

684
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:56,875
I think that I need to go and be by myself
for a while. I'm just gonna do that.

685
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:59,625
Who turns down a free eclair?
I can't eat, and I'd still take it.

686
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:02,791
Could you please
just give me a little bit of space?

687
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:05,666
Okay.

688
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:37,791
How was your walk?

689
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,750
Okay, that's it. I'm Googling therapists.

690
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,153
I didn't mean to scare you. Okay?

691
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:45,708
I am also trying
to make sense of everything.

692
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,791
Look, is this happening
because of that fight we had?

693
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:51,958
If I had known that was the last time
we would see each other, I...

694
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,000
I would have done things differently too.

695
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:57,041
Is that why you're here?
Be... because of what I said?

696
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:58,125
According to...

697
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,291
- Do you mean God?
- Val.

698
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:02,875
A woman? I knew it.

699
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:05,875
Val's my handler.
She's like my temp guardian angel.

700
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:08,125
In order for me to move up,
fingers crossed,

701
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:11,791
I'm supposed to help you,
my dad, and my mom for some reason.

702
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,291
Well, I don't need help.

703
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:15,916
Look, I didn't make the list.

704
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:19,455
I wanna show you something.

705
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:31,916
I found it under your bed.

706
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,541
Your dad took the rest of your stuff.

707
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:37,208
Um...
You wouldn't recognize your room.

708
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,041
- Oh, I saw.
- Huh.

709
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,458
Something told me I should keep it.

710
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,083
- I thought you'd forgotten about me.
- What?

711
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,625
We've been in each other's lives
for as long as I can remember.

712
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:55,250
How... how could you think that?

713
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:57,583
Being dead
brings up a lot of insecurities.

714
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:02,208
Are those from your mom?

715
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:03,833
Yep.

716
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:08,583
Postcards from all the amazing places
she visited after she left us.

717
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:15,833
Hey, uh,

718
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:17,958
would you...

719
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:22,625
...maybe wanna puzzle?

720
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:24,333
You still have it.

721
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,500
Some of the pieces
might be missing.

722
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:31,375
I found it on the floor that morning.

723
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:35,166
Can't leave Mona without her smile
this time.

724
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:40,083
Look, I don't know what's happening,
and I probably need to schedule an MRI,

725
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:43,291
but it is really, really nice
to have you back.

726
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:44,916
It's really nice to be back.

727
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,000
Hi, Piper.

728
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:57,375
Are you okay?

729
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,125
No.

730
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,750
- What do you think she does in there?
- Money laundering, hacking.

731
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:08,250
Basic roommate stuff.

732
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:16,833
- This almost feels like old times.
- Almost.

733
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,976
- You know what'd make it better?
- Your boyfriend Koop's music?

734
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,250
I can't help who I love!

735
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,458
You forget
that I introduced you to his greatness.

736
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:25,461
He's my soul mate.
Do you know he has a new song?

737
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,100
- More like a whole album.
- Are you serious? I've missed so much.

738
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:30,708
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Google, play "Drive" by Koop.

752
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:07,333
- There you are.
- I don't need food anymore.

753
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:08,666
Yeah.

754
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:09,750
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

755
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:11,916
I can't imagine
a world without cold noodles.

756
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:15,083
I think I had more dinners at your house
than at my own.

757
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,958
Especially during my dad's
cooking learning curve. Remember that?

758
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:20,666
- You know my parents love you.
- I love them.

759
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:25,500
Look, I know that you thought
your dad was overprotective.

760
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:27,000
Smothering.

761
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:29,041
But he did the best he could, Cassie.

762
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,125
Yeah.

763
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:33,125
Yeah, I'm starting to realize that.

764
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:35,625
Is that next door?

765
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:38,416
Doesn't that get annoying?

766
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:40,166
I don't find it annoying.

767
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:46,166
No, no, no! He's just super talented
and cute and smart.

768
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,833
Oh, you still have a crush!

769
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:51,333
What'll you do about this year-long crush?

770
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:52,666
Absolutely nothing.

771
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,000
We're fine the way we are. I...

772
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,958
- I don't wanna mess things up.
- What's to mess up?

773
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,267
If you don't go after what you want,
how will you get it?

774
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,291
Like that job interview.

775
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:03,333
You know you want it,
but you didn't even sign up.

776
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:05,750
- How do you know about that?
- I am everywhere. Duh.

777
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:09,125
For someone who studies bones,
you need to get some in your back.

778
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:14,416
- How long have you waited to say that?
- When did you declare your major again?

779
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,791
Since you were digging dirt
in your backyard,

780
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:20,291
you knew what you wanted,
and I have always admired that.

781
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:24,583
Really? 'Cause you used to tease me
pretty hard about being so work-focused.

782
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:28,333
Okay. Well, that was alive me,
and she was so very wrong.

783
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:33,708
That's it.

784
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:35,583
This is why I'm here.

785
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:38,250
I'm going to get you together
with Dreamy Max!

786
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:41,291
I am sure that there are
more substantial reasons why you're here.

787
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,208
No! Shush. Okay, this is my warm-up.

788
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:45,958
Okay, if we can hear his music,
then he can hear ours.

789
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:49,375
And since you aren't going to go to him,
it's time for him to come to you.

790
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:50,916
Hey, Google, replay Koop.

791
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:56,416
Replay Koop.

792
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,541
Um, I'm not sure she speaks angel.

793
00:48:58,625 --> 00:48:59,791
A little help, please?

794
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:02,083
Hey, Google, replay Koop.

795
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:07,809
Tell her to go louder. We want it to sound
like you're having the best time ever.

796
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:10,875
Curiosity will hit, and he won't be able
to stay away. It's science.

797
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:15,166
Hey, Google, highest volume, please.

00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,333

Huh. He's shyer than I thought.

807
00:49:37,416 --> 00:49:39,896
- What are you doing?
- Going old school. Knocking on his door.

808
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:41,333
- What? No!
- Yeah. I'm doing it!

809
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:43,166
Cassie! So embarrassing!

810
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,291
Oh.

811
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:48,333
Hi. Hey. Um, I heard you playing music,
and I was gonna knock,

812
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:51,791
but then I didn't wanna disturb,
so I didn't yet.

813
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:55,583
- Are you having a party in here?
- Who, me? No.

814
00:49:56,875 --> 00:49:58,000
I'm just rockin' out.

815
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
Oh.

816
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:02,708
Hey, is it too loud?
'Cause I can turn it down.

817
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:04,958
Hey, hey, Google, turn it off.

818
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:08,208
No, you didn't have to do that
on my account. It's a great song though.

819
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:11,041
- Oh, I can turn it back on.
- No, not if you don't want to.

820
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:15,458
Sorry. Look, you know how we were saying
that we wanted to hang out?

821
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:18,500
Well, uh, Koop's actually
shooting a music video tomorrow.

822
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,125
- What?
- My friend's directing it.

823
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:22,333
He wanted to know
if I wanted to visit the set.

824
00:50:22,416 --> 00:50:25,291
- So, uh, I thought maybe...
- He's chickening out. Invite him in.

825
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:26,958
- Stop it.
- Stop what?

826
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:28,875
I didn't say anything.
Did you say something?

827
00:50:30,416 --> 00:50:31,416
Ask him in.

828
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,375
Do you wanna come in?
I think I have some wine.

829
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:36,833
Sure. Yeah. No, I'd... I'd love that.

830
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,291
Okay, okay. Cool shoes.

831
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:51,791
Mmm. You smell clean. A good start.

832
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:56,041
Yeah, this is pretty much
exactly like walking into my place.

833
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:58,875
Except a lot bigger and a lot less stuff.

834
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:02,083
A little obvious, Max.
My friend is a genius. You can do better.

835
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:03,916
Shut up. You're a puzzler?

836
00:51:04,958 --> 00:51:06,083
I'm a puzzler.

837
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:09,791
Yeah. I can lose myself for days
doing one of those.

838
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,708
- I just started up again.
- No way.

839
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:14,500
My best friend Cassie and I,
we used to puzzle all the time.

840
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,333
Oh, here.
I found it in the back of the fridge,

841
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:19,083
so I'm not sure if it's good.

842
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:20,458
Vintage. Nice.

843
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,583
Only the best for you, neighbor.

844
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,083
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

845
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:26,916
Have you ever been arrested?
How is your credit?

846
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,291
Oh, are you okay?

847
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:30,375
I'm fine.

848
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:35,083
Wow.

849
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:38,750
It's disgusting.

850
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:40,458
Bottoms up.

851
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,166
Well, now we're in it together, right?

852
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:49,833
Aw, he's adorable.

853
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:53,875
So it must've, um, been hard,
you losing your friend like that.

854
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:56,583
- How long's it been? A year?
- This week, yeah.

855
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:57,666
Wow.

856
00:51:58,125 --> 00:51:59,708
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

857
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:04,000
Though sometimes I just feel like
she's actually hovering right over me.

858
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,958
I'm in the way. Hint taken.
I'll be in your room if you need me.

859
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,833
How are those dinosaurs of yours?
They still extinct?

860
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:11,416
Yeah. That happened.

861
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:16,166
Um, yeah, I... I mostly work with fossils.

862
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:20,125
I just find something so comforting
in... in holding history in your hands.

863
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:21,583
Yeah, I get that.

864
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:24,666
The tangible
is easier to believe in, right?

865
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,500
Exactly. Yeah, I've always thought that.

866
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:29,791
- On a scale of one to ten...
- Mm-hmm.

867
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,916
...how big of a <i>Jurassic Park </i>fan are you?

868
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,083
- No, like a 20.
- Twenty!

869
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:35,916
She watched it all the time!

870
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,500
All the time.

871
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:41,791
I... I, um, I watched it a lot.

872
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,750
And <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

873
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:47,041
I blame my geekiness
on those movies actually.

874
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,375
I like your geekiness.

875
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,208
Late. It's getting late.

876
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:55,708
Um... I...

877
00:52:58,125 --> 00:52:59,750
I have to work tomorrow.

878
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,875
Yeah, no. Yeah, of course.

879
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:04,916
Um, well, look,

880
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:07,625
thanks for having me.

881
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,166
And for the questionable wine.

882
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,517
That was great.

883
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:13,916
And I'll see you soon. Yeah?

884
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

885
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,458
- Cool.
- Cool.

886
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:17,625
- Okay.
- Okay.

887
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:18,833
- Bye.
- Bye.

888
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:24,166
That was a good-ish start. Now you
have to learn how to stick the landing.

889
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,583
I think I really like him.

890
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:27,500
Well, then it's good you kicked him out.

891
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,791
Okay. I need to go to bed.

892
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,666
And don't watch me sleep tonight.

893
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,666
It's creepy.

894
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:35,791
Aye, aye, Captain.

895
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:37,958
Proud of you!

896
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:45,750
God, I'm so stupid.

897
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,541
What was I even thinking?

898
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:51,041
Why did I kick him out?

899
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:53,083
Smart.

900
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54,250
I totally blew it.

901
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:56,083
So stupid.

902
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:12,125
"Thanks for the wine"? Who says that?
Like she's my waiter for the evening.

903
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:15,541
For God's sake, why can't I just
ask her out like a normal human being?

904
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:17,458
I had the chance, and I blew it.

905
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:19,291
Oh, what was I thinking?

906
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:24,208
- It was like I was leaving a wake.
- They really are made for each other.

907
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:26,875
Oh. "I like your geekiness"?
I mean, who says that?

908
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:30,458
"Hi. I'm Max, your weird neighbor,
and you'll never speak to me again."

909
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:32,875
Cool. Nice one, dude.
Brilliant. Brilliant. What a corker.

910
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,416
Okay.

911
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:51,791
Um...

912
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:53,916
Hmm.

913
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:57,125
Oh, so cute.

914
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:24,458
I'm late!

915
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:37,708
Right.

916
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:59,458
What? Seriously?
I don't have time for this, Cassie!

917
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:02,833
Right.

918
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:11,666
Piper, don't forget the rent check!

I'm late for work, and I...

00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:30,458
It's okay.
I'm on my way, um, to get some coffee.

last night,

929
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:42,291
but would you wanna go
to that Koop music video thing with me?

930
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,750
I thought it'd be cool
to see what goes on behind...

931
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:46,416
Yeah. Yes.

932
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:51,583
Cool. Well, I can pick you up at 4:00,
if that works?

933
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:52,708
4:00?

934
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:57,250
I'm not exactly a leave-work-early
kinda gal, but, yeah, why not?

935
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:58,541
Yeah. Yeah, 4:00 is great.

936
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:00,333
Don't be late.

937
00:58:00,416 --> 00:58:01,625
What about your coffee?

938
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:05,500
Right. Yeah, no. Sorry.

939
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:10,833
I... I forgot I'm actually in the throes
of a pretty vicious eBay bidding war

940
00:58:10,916 --> 00:58:13,541
over the original VHS
of David Bowie's the<i> Labyrinth</i>,

941
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:15,500
and I really should get back to that.

942
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:18,708
No rest for the wicked and all that.
But I will see you later. Yeah?

943
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:21,250
- Okay. Yeah, I'll see you later too.
- Bye.

944
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:22,333
Bye.

945
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:26,541
Thanks, fairy godmother.

946
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,583
- Am I doing it wrong?
- Yes.

947
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,208
- Do I got it now?
- Yes.

948
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:06,833
Oh. All right. Time to start
Project Get Dad Out of his Funk.

949
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:10,166
What to do first?

950
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:38,208
Come on, Dad.
You know you're tempted to try this out.

951
00:59:54,083 --> 00:59:56,250
That's it? Not even a downward dog?

952
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:58,833
Your yoga-avoiding daughter
is trying to connect here.

953
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:09,208
I can take a hint, universe.

954
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:12,333
Or Cassie.

955
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:50,916
- Ooh, that looks good.
- Oh, she always...

956
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:53,250
Wear a bell or something.

957
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,708
Are you trying to shut me out?

958
01:00:57,791 --> 01:01:00,583
I don't want people to think
that I'm talking to myself.

959
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,333
Oh. Look around.

960
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:04,625
Everybody looks
like they're talking to themselves.

961
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,791
It's talking to each other
we have trouble with.

962
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:09,708
- Oh, that's surprisingly deep.
- I have my moments.

963
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,250
It's been one of those days.

964
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:15,166
Well, luckily, your best friend is here,
even if she is wearing EarPods.

965
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:16,875
I'm trying to help my dad.

966
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:19,875
You should see his house. It's a mess.
And he stopped doing yoga.

967
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:21,541
- Wait, seriously?
- Yeah.

968
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:24,458
That is so unlike him.

969
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:28,041
Although you know what?
He hasn't posted in a while.

970
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:32,416
Yeah. We can't communicate like you and I,
so I'm trying to get creative.

971
01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:33,791
Yeah.

972
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:36,416
I, uh, I also saw Sofia.

973
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:38,791
She was with her daughter.

974
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:40,250
My half sister, Morgan.

975
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:42,500
They were playing at the park.

976
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:43,958
She came to your service.

977
01:01:45,375 --> 01:01:47,291
I wanna be happy for her. I do.

978
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:50,750
But seeing her so carefree,
you know, it hurts,

979
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,583
and I get angry, and it's just...

980
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:54,833
It's not a very angelic reaction, huh?

981
01:01:54,916 --> 01:01:57,125
I mean, I wouldn't know, but, uh,

982
01:01:58,208 --> 01:02:00,041
it does sound like a pretty human one.

983
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:02,791
I don't know how I'll make things right
before my time is up.

984
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:06,166
A little buzz here. Let's see what it is.

985
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:09,750
Wait! Downward Dad is back!

986
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:12,833
Whatever you're doing, it's working!

987
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:16,958
So...

988
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:18,041
So?

989
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:21,083
- Are you ready for your big date?
- Date? What date?

990
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:25,375
Are you kidding me? I'm freaking out!
Why do you think I'm stress eating?

991
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:26,875
Oh, you're so lucky I came back.

992
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:27,958
I know.

993
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:33,166
It's okay, right?

994
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:37,916
This is what you wear when you're sick,
and you go to CVS for more cough medicine.

995
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,208
Okay. Hey, now,

996
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:42,125
we don't all have your never-ending supply
of brand-new clothes.

997
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:43,333
Um...

998
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:44,625
Ah! Ooh!

999
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:46,500
Love this one.

1000
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:48,916
Yes. With red lipstick.

1001
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,750
- Okay, don't push it.
- Pink lip?

1002
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:52,666
Fine.

1003
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:53,875
Uh, wait!

1004
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:57,125
- The pink lip.
- The pink lip.

1005
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:02,083
Let's see.

1006
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:06,583
Yeah. Yeah, I like it. I li...
I don't know. Is it... is it me?

1007
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:09,166
- You look perfect.
- Really?

1008
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:12,916
That cutie composer
won't know what hit him. Come here.

1009
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,041
He's here! He's here!

1010
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,500
- Ah! Wait, wait, wait!
- Okay, come on. Let's go!

1011
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:21,208
Wait! One last thing. Hold on.

1012
01:03:21,291 --> 01:03:25,041
- Turn.
- Stop spraying me! Stop it! He's here.

1013
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:34,583
You look...

1014
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,666
Wow.

1015
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,875
You look wow yourself.

1016
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:46,041
- After you.
- Thank you.

1017
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:47,125
You're welcome.

1018
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:50,666
Thanks.

1019
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:53,833
Mmm. And he has manners.

1020
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,333
What are you doing here?

1021
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,541
Like I'd miss a chance
to see Koop live and in person.

1022
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:00,958
- Don't worry. You won't know I'm here.
- Cassie!

1023
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:04,291
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08:13,291 --> 01:08:14,916
Sorry for crashing.

1094
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,541
I was, uh,
non-living vicariously through you.

1095
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:19,708
It's okay. Just... just do me a favor

1096
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:22,791
and maybe don't come
on any of our other dates.

1097
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:24,000
No chaperone.

1098
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:25,458
Got it.

1099
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,416
- I'm glad it went well.
- Oh, it really did.

1100
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,333
We spent the entire night just talking.

1101
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:34,625
He's so interesting.

1102
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:36,833
He knows all of these obscure bands.

1103
01:08:37,416 --> 01:08:41,083
Plus, um, he even got me this blanket
before I said I was cold.

1104
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:45,000
Oh, and he smells really, really good.

1105
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:48,250
Like pine and pizza.

1106
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,416
- You're falling for him.
- Yeah, I am.

1107
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:56,666
Hey.

1108
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,125
Why are you crying?

1109
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:01,583
These aren't sad tears.

1110
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:05,166
- Yeah, but they're still tears.
- This is your time. It's not about me.

1111
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:09,166
It's just...

1112
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:11,625
I don't know.

1113
01:09:11,708 --> 01:09:14,875
I guess it's starting to hit me that
I'm never gonna have a first kiss again,

1114
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:19,500
or go on an amazing date,
or go on a bad date.

1115
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:22,416
But worst of all,

1116
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:26,916
I'm not gonna be here
to watch all your career successes.

1117
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,375
I won't be here
to watch you walk down the aisle

1118
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,458
and become a mother.

1119
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,041
And, oh,
you're gonna be an amazing mom, Lis.

1120
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,125
Thanks.

1121
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:40,166
Your kids
are always gonna know they're loved.

1122
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,250
Plus, they're gonna...

1123
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:44,916
...dominate the science fair.

1124
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,083
- Oh, they will, won't they?
- Yeah.

1125
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:51,125
Sorry, maybe these are sad tears.

1126
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:53,083
This isn't fair.

1127
01:09:54,041 --> 01:09:55,666
No one should have to die young.

1128
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,625
I have to believe there's a reason for it.

1129
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:02,750
Even if I don't know what it is yet.

1130
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:05,541
- This is all my fault.
- No!

1131
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:07,750
If I'd just stayed there
with you that night,

1132
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:09,791
then none of this would've even happened.

1133
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:13,083
No. This was gonna happen
no matter what you did. It was my time.

1134
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:15,916
When... when you were a kid,
and your parents would fight,

1135
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,541
I was the one
who would distract you with a puzzle.

1136
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:22,416
Yeah, and you had extra PJs for me
whenever I didn't wanna go home.

1137
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,375
- You've always been there for me.
- But that night, I wasn't.

1138
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:28,333
I mean,
I heard you coming to my door, and I...

1139
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,333
I have been mad at myself ever since.

1140
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:34,583
Hey.

1141
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:35,666
Don't be.

1142
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,800
In a weird way,
what happened is a good thing.

1143
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:39,666
Now... now you get to live your own life

1144
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,958
and don't have to worry
about taking care of me anymore.

1145
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,500
You don't mean that.

1146
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:45,583
I can't lie. I'm almost an angel.

1147
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:53,875
Well,

1148
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:57,000
I'd like to be there for you
one last time.

1149
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:03,000
I don't know
why I'm supposed to care about her.

1150
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,125
She left me, you know?

1151
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,750
But she's on my list, so...

1152
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,166
Well, hey, if you don't care,
then why keep her postcards?

1153
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:17,750
How can I help you with your mom?

1154
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,791
I can't believe she lives here.

1155
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,458
This is exactly what she ran away from.

1156
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:49,166
- Hi.
- Hi. I was so glad you called.

1157
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:50,750
Come in.

1158
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:51,833
Thanks.

1159
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:58,750
I, um, thought
we could catch up on the patio.

1160
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:05,750
I made lemonade.
Would you like some? I have tea.

1161
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:08,416
I have one of those Jarritos.
You used to love those.

1162
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,375
Oh.

1163
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,833
Um, I think water is fine. Thanks.

1164
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:17,333
- How are you, Lisa?
- Good.

1165
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,250
- Still working at the museum?
- Yeah.

1166
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,833
Yeah, it's been busy,
but it's been really good.

1167
01:12:24,916 --> 01:12:26,916
- Good.
- How are you?

1168
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:29,708
Busy. Busy with Morgan.

1169
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:32,583
- This is Morgan.
- Oh, let me see.

1170
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:36,833
- Oh, she's so cute!
- She's like Cassie in a lot of ways.

1171
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:40,500
Yeah, look,
she's got that same mischievous grin.

1172
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:43,791
They would've liked each other.
I always wanted to introduce them,

1173
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:46,708
but I wanted Cassie and I
to be okay first.

1174
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:48,166
I'd like to get started.

1175
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:49,791
So,

1176
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:54,125
I found these
in Cassie's box of keepsakes.

1177
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:56,083
Oh my gosh.

1178
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:58,791
She kept them?

1179
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:02,208
It was my only way to know you.
Tell her that, please.

1180
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:05,500
Yeah. I think
they made her feel closer to you.

1181
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:10,083
I used to read her <i>Mary Poppins</i>.

1182
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:12,375
She always wanted to see London.
Did she ever go?

1183
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:16,041
No, I didn't go anywhere.
I was hoping you would come back to me.

1184
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:18,041
No, she didn't.

1185
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:20,708
Too bad. She would have loved it.

1186
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:24,958
Mmm. Her first crush, actually, was
this guy who moved here from England.

1187
01:13:25,041 --> 01:13:26,041
- Ian.
- Ian.

1188
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:30,041
It's one of the many things we have...
had in common.

1189
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,958
I missed so much of her life.

1190
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:36,541
It must have been confusing for her,
dealing with boys and dating.

1191
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:40,958
Yeah, but my mom was there for both of us
to answer some of the tough questions, so...

1192
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:42,416
Ask her why she left.

1193
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:48,208
I'm sure that this is, like,
really hard to talk about, but, um...

1194
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:52,541
Cassie always wanted to know why you left.

1195
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:55,875
There's not one reason.

1196
01:13:56,541 --> 01:13:57,875
What did I do to make you leave?

1197
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,916
Was it something Cassie did?

1198
01:14:01,791 --> 01:14:03,333
No, never.

1199
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:06,583
Cassie, she was an angel.

1200
01:14:08,375 --> 01:14:09,541
It was all me.

1201
01:14:10,416 --> 01:14:11,416
I...

1202
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:13,041
I was young.

1203
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:16,333
And I thought I knew more
than anyone around me.

1204
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:17,291
Sounds like Cassie.

1205
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:19,833
I, uh, had this romantic idea

1206
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:22,458
of what I thought
being a wife and mother was like.

1207
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,541
Mm.

1208
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:25,458
But in reality,

1209
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,958
I wasn't ready
to be responsible for anyone.

1210
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:34,375
Looking back at it,
I see how patient and loving Howie was,

1211
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,500
but at the time,

1212
01:14:37,791 --> 01:14:39,750
I found that suffocating.

1213
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:41,208
I said the same thing.

1214
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:44,416
For a while, Howie used to send me

1215
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:47,666
pictures and letters,

1216
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,000
telling me about her.

1217
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:50,583
I never knew that.

1218
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,458
But I was too ashamed to respond,
so he stopped.

1219
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:59,541
I convinced myself that postcards
were an adequate placeholder,

1220
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:03,833
and one day I'd be able to explain it all,
and we'd actually laugh about it.

1221
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:09,458
Sounds so ridiculous
when I say it out loud.

1222
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:12,333
I... I let her down.

1223
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:16,166
The last time I saw her
was college graduation,

1224
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:17,625
and we were like strangers.

1225
01:15:17,708 --> 01:15:18,708
I remember.

1226
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:21,916
Now it's too late to make it right.

1227
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:26,125
And I'll never forgive myself for that.

1228
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:29,333
Okay, I've heard enough.
I need to go.

1229
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:30,750
If Cassie was here right now,

1230
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:33,500
what would you say to her?

1231
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:35,625
What are you doing? I didn't ask that.

1232
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:41,708
That I regret not taking her to London.

1233
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:46,375
I should have been there

1234
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:48,958
to help her with her homework,

1235
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:52,916
hold her when she had a nightmare.

1236
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:57,916
I made a lot of selfish decisions.

1237
01:15:59,666 --> 01:16:01,500
But one thing that never changed...

1238
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:07,583
One thing that never changed
was my love for her.

1239
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:10,000
If Cassie were here...

1240
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:14,875
I would tell her that the day she was born

1241
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:18,625
was one of the brightest moments
of my life.

1242
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,208
And running away,

1243
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:26,958
it was my worst.

1244
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:33,750
I just hope she knows how sorry I am.

1245
01:16:35,541 --> 01:16:36,541
She does.

1246
01:16:37,416 --> 01:16:38,416
She knows.

1247
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,083
Are you okay?

1248
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:20,833
Hey.

1249
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:22,583
Hey.

1250
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:29,427
How are we supposed to we finish this
if we don't have all the pieces?

1251
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:33,333
God, this is so frustrating.
Why did you even choose this puzzle?

1252
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:35,750
Uh, you sure
you wanna talk about the puzzle?

1253
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:39,208
Do you know how hard it was

1254
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:41,250
not being able
to say everything I wanted to her?

1255
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:42,958
I really don't.

1256
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,875
I have years of questions.

1257
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:51,333
Yet standing next to her, I found
that I just wanted to yell or run away.

1258
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,500
Like mother, like daughter.

1259
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:56,500
Yeah, but you didn't,
and that's a really good thing.

1260
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:58,291
Would you have translated if I did?

1261
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,791
It upset me
that you took the conversation over.

1262
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:03,750
No, no. I didn't take anything over.

1263
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:06,291
I could tell
that she needed to talk to you,

1264
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:08,291
and you needed to hear
what she had to say.

1265
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:09,500
That was for me to decide!

1266
01:18:10,416 --> 01:18:12,583
- I'm on your side, Cassie.
- Ugh.

1267
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:16,208
I could tell she needed to talk.
You needed to hear what she had to say!

1268
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,291
You don't get it!

1269
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:18,708
How could you?

1270
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:21,958
You have a perfect life, a perfect future.
I have none of those.

1271
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:27,416
Okay, okay. You're mad at your mom.
That's totally understandable, but...

1272
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:30,041
You know what? It's...

1273
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:32,388
It's not okay
for you to take it out on me.

1274
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,625
Sorry. Does my messy non-life
make you uncomfortable?

1275
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:35,916
Here we go again. Classic.

1276
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,416
I died before I ever got a chance to live!

1277
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,875
Well, I'm hurt too!
Did you think about that, huh?

1278
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:43,250
God, after our fight,

1279
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:46,541
after you left, I had to carry around
the guilt of our fight.

1280
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:49,625
I had to pick up the pieces,
put my life back together without you.

1281
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:52,625
Well, you did a great job.
Look around! There's nothing left of me!

1282
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:55,125
I've been reduced to a box of knickknacks!

1283
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,083
After everything that's happened,
I can't believe we're back to arguing.

1284
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:02,083
Yeah.

1285
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:04,041
Well, I'm dead,

1286
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:07,291
so you don't have to worry
about arguing with me ever again.

1287
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,750
You cannot bring that anger in here.

1288
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:24,416
Look, I... I met with my mom.
I got Lisa a boyfriend.

1289
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,875
I've been talking to my dad
even though he can't hear me.

1290
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:29,291
Isn't that enough? Do I have to go back?

1291
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:31,041
Well, not if you don't want to.

1292
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:32,125
Thank you.

1293
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:36,708
Well, then, why don't I just walk you
over to the elevator?

1294
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:39,375
When you get there, hit "B" for Below.

1295
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:41,833
- Very funny. I get it.
- No, you don't.

1296
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:45,833
Why would you risk throwing away
everything you've worked toward?

1297
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:47,125
And over an argument?

1298
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:49,541
You were doing so well.

1299
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:52,791
- You think I'm doing well?
- Yes, I do. Don't you?

1300
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,250
I don't know. Maybe.

1301
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:59,750
I hoped I wouldn't have to tell you this,
but here we are.

1302
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:03,833
If you really want this to end now,
I can make that happen.

1303
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:07,875
But just know,
if you leave the list unfinished,

1304
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:10,666
then all the good you've been doing
will be undone.

1305
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:12,458
Poof.

1306
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:15,625
Everything?

1307
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:17,625
Lisa?

1308
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:18,916
My dad?

1309
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,250
Everything.

1310
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:26,916
Oh, that's... that's terrible.

1311
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,791
I can't... I can't do that to them.

1312
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:38,250
So, you've made your decision?

1313
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,458
Dad, I really need to talk...

1314
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:55,875
- What is she doing here?
- More tea?

1315
01:20:55,958 --> 01:20:56,958
Please.

1316
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:01,083
I still can't believe
you left your accounting practice

1317
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:02,500
to open a yoga studio.

1318
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:05,666
You always joked about it,
but I never thought you'd actually do it.

1319
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:08,625
I also joked about
becoming a drummer in an '80s cover band.

1320
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:12,083
- I remember that one.
- This was a better lifestyle choice.

1321
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:14,041
It suits you.

1322
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,666
You might not have said that
a few days ago.

1323
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,833
This past year has been a challenge.

1324
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,833
You know, Lisa visited me today.

1325
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:23,583
I know this may sound nutty.

1326
01:21:23,666 --> 01:21:25,083
During that visit, it...

1327
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:29,291
it was almost as though
Cassie were standing right beside me.

1328
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:30,750
I know what you mean.

1329
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,625
She was a lot like you though.

1330
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:36,041
Fearless, independent.

1331
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:39,958
She'd dive headfirst
into... any situation.

1332
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:42,166
But more than anything,

1333
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:45,875
she was this force of energy
who lit up every room she entered.

1334
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:51,375
After Lisa left, I, um...

1335
01:21:52,916 --> 01:21:55,291
I had this overwhelming urge to see you.

1336
01:21:56,041 --> 01:22:00,916
I just need you to know
how deeply sorry I am for walking out.

1337
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:05,166
It wasn't how I saw life going,
that's for sure.

1338
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:09,166
Your leaving forced me to become
a better man, a better parent,

1339
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:11,666
even when she didn't want me to,

1340
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:16,458
and I hope that in some way I was able
to minimize whatever scars she had.

1341
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,166
Yeah, I know you did.

1342
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:24,750
Look, I've kept you long enough.

1343
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:26,666
Thanks for this.

1344
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,125
You know, I don't know
if it's the palo santo in the air

1345
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:32,958
or this dandelion tea talking,

1346
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:35,583
but I feel as though Cassie,
wherever she is...

1347
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:36,875
Brought us back together.

1348
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:53,958
Mom, wait!

1349
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:09,083
I forgive you.

1350
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:50,041
So proud of you.

1351
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:51,166
That felt good.

1352
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:54,250
I can tell. I mean, you seem lighter.

1353
01:23:56,666 --> 01:23:57,750
Hey, so, um...

1354
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:01,333
I need a favor.
It's for a good cause, I swear!

1355
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:02,458
No swearing.

1356
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:03,750
I didn't actually swear!

1357
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:08,166
There's this bakery, and the owner
seems like a really thoughtful person.

1358
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:12,583
I know she's not on my list, but I think
I can help her and help my dad.

1359
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:14,541
We're not running
a matchmaking service here.

1360
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:17,458
I know, but they could both use
a kind person in their life.

1361
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:19,333
This could also be a thank-you to Emme

1362
01:24:19,416 --> 01:24:21,916
for being such a good friend to Lisa
since I've been gone.

1363
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:29,625
I've never had anyone
want to <i>add </i>to their list before.

1364
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:33,958
I've also never had
anyone like you before.

1365
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,375
I'll allow it.

1366
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:38,833
- Thank you!
- Oh!

1367
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:41,291
You're the best! Thank you! Thank you!

1368
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:43,625
Yeah, but you're
still on the same timeline.

1369
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:45,833
Tomorrow is your last day, Cassie.

1370
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:47,791
I got this.

1371
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:52,083
Perfect.

1372
01:24:57,041 --> 01:25:00,750
I can't leave it like this.
It's a bakery, not Grandma's basement.

1373
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:47,083
Are you behind this too, Cassie?

1374
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:52,208
I like your faith in me, Dad.

1375
01:26:02,541 --> 01:26:05,916
<i>...and has traveled the world
searching for the perfect dessert...</i>

1376
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:10,083
Morgan, <i>mijita</i>, are you dressed?

1377
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,833
We're leaving in five minutes.

1378
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:15,013
We don't wanna be late again.

1379
01:26:30,708 --> 01:26:32,083
Would you like some tea?

1380
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:35,458
You can see me?

1381
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:37,875
I saw you at the park too.

1382
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:44,083
Aren't you scared?

1383
01:26:45,208 --> 01:26:46,958
You're my guardian angel.

1384
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,666
Ask your mom to read this to you.

1385
01:26:57,625 --> 01:26:58,750
I will.

1386
01:26:58,833 --> 01:27:00,625
This is our secret, okay?

1387
01:27:13,541 --> 01:27:14,791
Dr. Redding.

1388
01:27:42,375 --> 01:27:43,875
I wish Cassie was here.

1389
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:46,750
I'm right here.

1390
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,333
Hey.

1391
01:27:49,416 --> 01:27:50,416
Hey.

1392
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,958
I do have a piece of you.

1393
01:27:58,041 --> 01:28:00,125
- It's from our very first puzzle.
- Yeah.

1394
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:03,000
It's, uh, it's kinda like my lucky charm.

1395
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,541
I thought you were done with me.

1396
01:28:08,666 --> 01:28:10,916
There are no grudges in the afterlife.

1397
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:13,458
Are there any here?

1398
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:18,000
No. No, no. I do not wanna lose
any more time with you.

1399
01:28:18,083 --> 01:28:20,416
- Neither do I.
- No, no, no!

1400
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:23,458
- I don't think I can explain an air hug.
- Good point.

1401
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:24,541
Yeah.

1402
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:27,583
Okay, so what's the problem?
Why are you hesitating?

1403
01:28:27,666 --> 01:28:28,875
This is yours to lose.

1404
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:30,041
Yeah, exactly.

1405
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:32,513
Cassie, what if I don't get it? What then?

1406
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:35,208
You'll survive, and you'll go on
to something even better.

1407
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:37,000
No. No.

1408
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:40,166
Look at me. Do you want this?

1409
01:28:42,666 --> 01:28:45,166
- Yeah.
- Are you the best person for this job?

1410
01:28:46,875 --> 01:28:47,958
Yeah.

1411
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:49,841
I'm not buying that yeah.
You gotta try again.

1412
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:51,791
Are you the best person for this?

1413
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:54,083
Yeah! I am the best person for this!

1414
01:28:54,166 --> 01:28:56,916
Yes! There's my strong friend!
Life is too short to be fearful.

1415
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,791
Yeah, Cassie,
I eat, I sleep, I drink this job.

1416
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:03,666
If I got this job, I'd crush it so hard,
they'd name a freaking fossil after me.

1417
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,833
- I would...
- Use that energy and go sign up!

1418
01:29:05,916 --> 01:29:09,166
Right! Sign up first. Dominate second.

1419
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:11,291
Yes.

1420
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:13,250
Oh, I've created a monster.

1421
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,250
I love it.

1422
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,291
Phew. Bam, bam. Good luck.

1423
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:33,916
Hi.

1424
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,416
I've heard nice things about you, Lisa.

1425
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,333
- Thanks.
- I'm glad you decided to interview.

1426
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:41,791
And last too.

1427
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:43,625
That's a bold move.

1428
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:47,375
Shows the competition
you're not worried about who came before.

1429
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:49,416
Oh, um, I didn't plan that...

1430
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,750
Modesty's a myth
that was sold to women a long time ago.

1431
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,666
Be proud of your work.

1432
01:29:55,875 --> 01:29:57,375
Why paleontology?

1433
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:01,000
I love digging in dirt,

1434
01:30:01,083 --> 01:30:05,458
and I hated when people told me
that it wasn't a proper career for a lady.

1435
01:30:05,541 --> 01:30:10,750
But, uh, mostly, I found it comforting
studying what is real.

1436
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:15,125
With fossils, it's like this tangible
connection to the past, you know?

1437
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:17,583
But, uh, now I've...

1438
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:20,416
I've started learning from what I...

1439
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:22,625
I can't see.

1440
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:26,625
- Bye.
- Bye.

1441
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:27,833
- Bye.
- See you.

1442
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:34,250
Cassie?

1443
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:38,541
I got it! I got it!

1444
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:41,583
- I got the job! I got it!
- You got it!

1445
01:30:41,666 --> 01:30:44,750
Thank you so much for the push.
I couldn't have done it without you.

1446
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:47,708
- It was all you.
- No, I can't even believe I did it.

1447
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:50,875
- Um, I can!
- This is, like, the best day of my life.

1448
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:53,291
- So proud of you!
- Thank you.

1449
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:57,541
So, are you gonna come to Emme's tonight?
I'm bringing Max.

1450
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:58,916
I wouldn't miss it.

1451
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:19,458
You made it!

1452
01:31:20,916 --> 01:31:22,750
Thank you so much for coming.

1453
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:28,083
Excuse me. Hello.

1454
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:30,125
I think I'm in the right place?

1455
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:33,291
If you're here for the party,
then yes, you are. I'm Emme.

1456
01:31:33,791 --> 01:31:35,833
Would you like a homemade fortune cookie?

1457
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:37,500
Don't mind if I do.

1458
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:44,083
- "You don't need to look any further."
- Oh.

1459
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:46,000
I guess this is the right place.

1460
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:48,833
How did you hear about my little soiree?

1461
01:31:48,916 --> 01:31:51,333
Honestly,
my home was filled with your fliers.

1462
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:55,958
No explanation. I have my suspicions,
but no one would believe them.

1463
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:57,791
Well, since we're being honest,

1464
01:31:57,875 --> 01:32:00,166
my shop didn't look like this
when I closed up last night.

1465
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,916
I woke up this morning, and voilà.

1466
01:32:04,208 --> 01:32:06,041
I've got my suspicions too.

1467
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:09,958
Someone's either looking out for us,
or we need to get our locks changed.

1468
01:32:12,208 --> 01:32:13,541
Can I get you a green tea?

1469
01:32:13,625 --> 01:32:15,625
- I've got sencha, matcha...
- Matcha?

1470
01:32:15,708 --> 01:32:16,791
Of course.

1471
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:20,208
- What did you say your name was again?
- Howard.

1472
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:23,291
- Some people call me Howie.
- Howard.

1473
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:25,500
It means "strong heart."

1474
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:28,166
Well, that went better than expected.

1475
01:32:29,958 --> 01:32:31,708
Wow.

1476
01:32:32,625 --> 01:32:36,250
It is fascinating the many ways
that people can make a living, isn't it?

1477
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:37,791
- Look at that.
- Come on.

1478
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:42,208
Okay.

1479
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,750
I'd really love to do
gluten and dairy-free.

1480
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:47,541
That's a new development.

1481
01:32:48,416 --> 01:32:49,708
Come on. I'll introduce you.

1482
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:51,541
Hey, look.

1483
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:54,458
- Hi, Mr. Garcia.
- Lisa!

1484
01:32:54,541 --> 01:32:55,791
- Hi.
- Oh!

1485
01:32:56,708 --> 01:32:58,828
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same.

1486
01:32:58,875 --> 01:33:01,250
- Welcome to the party.
- Hi, Emme! Hi!

1487
01:33:01,333 --> 01:33:05,750
She's one of my regulars. And I suspect
is some of the reason I had this makeover.

1488
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:07,375
If only I knew how you got in here.

1489
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:09,375
Well, I'll never tell.

1490
01:33:09,958 --> 01:33:12,083
So this is Max. He's, um,

1491
01:33:13,916 --> 01:33:14,916
my...

1492
01:33:15,625 --> 01:33:17,000
Boyfriend. Hi.

1493
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:20,666
- Uh, wait, sorry. Is that cool?
- One hundred percent.

1494
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:22,541
And how do you two know each other?

1495
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:24,833
Lisa and my daughter were best friends.

1496
01:33:24,916 --> 01:33:27,125
- What? Are you Cassie's dad?
- Yeah.

1497
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:28,958
I've heard a lot about her.

1498
01:33:34,166 --> 01:33:36,708
Um, I just have to make a call.
I'll be right back.

1499
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:37,958
- All right.
- Okay.

1500
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:42,333
Someone has been busy.
Are you still playing Cupid?

1501
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:45,041
Can I help it if their paths crossed?

1502
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:46,708
You still can't talk to him, huh?

1503
01:33:46,791 --> 01:33:47,791
No.

1504
01:33:48,166 --> 01:33:52,250
It's my last day. But he seems happier,
and that's what's important.

1505
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:53,416
Huh.

1506
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:55,166
What's with the "huh"?

1507
01:33:56,208 --> 01:33:58,041
You can go anywhere I can go, right?

1508
01:33:58,125 --> 01:33:59,791
I mean, if I'm needed. Why?

1509
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:03,375
After this party,
I need you to find me. No questions asked.

1510
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:06,833
- What are you up to?
- You're not the only one with surprises.

1511
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:10,541
You have to find me after
and not before, okay?

1512
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,250
- Okay.
- Okay.

1513
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:21,666
Hey, everyone.

1514
01:34:22,166 --> 01:34:24,583
I wanna thank you so very much for coming.

1515
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:29,000
We're obviously here
because of our beloved Cassie,

1516
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:33,166
um, who left us a year ago this week,
but, um,

1517
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:36,375
I really don't want this to be about loss

1518
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:40,125
because this is also the week
that she came into our lives.

1519
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,458
One thing we know about our Cassie
is that her joyous life was a party.

1520
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:51,375
Especially the week of her birthday,
or as she called it...

1521
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:53,708
- Cassie-palooza.
- Cassie-palooza.

1522
01:34:54,791 --> 01:34:58,333
So, these wish lanterns
that you're holding

1523
01:34:58,416 --> 01:35:00,833
will carry whatever you wanna say to her.

1524
01:35:00,916 --> 01:35:03,708
And as they float across the water,

1525
01:35:03,791 --> 01:35:07,791
your thoughts will be sent to her.

1526
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:11,458
Okay, Morgan,
why don't you go first? Okay?

1527
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:17,333
Hey.

1528
01:35:17,375 --> 01:35:21,750
Hey. This entire time, I thought
I was the one helping all of you, but...

1529
01:35:23,666 --> 01:35:25,250
all this has me realizing that...

1530
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:29,000
you were the ones helping me.

1531
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:33,291
I'm not... I'm not ready to lose you again.

1532
01:35:33,375 --> 01:35:36,708
We got a second chance.
Not everyone can say that.

1533
01:35:37,916 --> 01:35:40,541
I want you to know
you're more than just my best friend

1534
01:35:40,625 --> 01:35:42,208
and my puzzle partner, okay?

1535
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:44,000
You're my family.

1536
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:47,291
And you're mine.

1537
01:35:48,125 --> 01:35:51,500
I couldn't imagine going through this life
or any other without you.

1538
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:59,083

Wait, that's it.

1541
01:36:04,958 --> 01:36:07,541
That's the song
he would always sing to me as a kid.

1545

01:36:29,041 --> 01:36:31,791

1553
01:37:16,541 --> 01:37:18,583
I'm not afraid to go anymore, Dad.

1554
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:28,208
I love you, pumpkin.

1555
01:37:30,916 --> 01:37:32,291
I love you too, Dad.

1556
01:37:45,541 --> 01:37:46,583
I gotta go.

1557
01:38:03,166 --> 01:38:04,166
Bye.

1558
01:38:04,583 --> 01:38:05,583
Bye.

1559
01:38:14,458 --> 01:38:16,041
You're cutting it a bit close.

1560
01:38:16,125 --> 01:38:18,208
I always like
to be the last one to leave a party.

1561
01:38:18,291 --> 01:38:20,875
Wait, please.
I have to find one last thing.

1562
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:23,916
We have to be back before time runs out.
You don't want to tempt fate.

1563
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,166
- It's important. It's for Lisa.
- Cassie!

1564
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:32,750
There it is!

1565
01:38:39,125 --> 01:38:42,750
I found it!
The final piece. The list is complete.

1566
01:38:49,375 --> 01:38:51,666
- What's that look?
- Your time is up.

1567
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,166
Happy birthday, Cassie.

1568
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:24,458
- What did they decide?
- Well, you missed your deadline.

1569
01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:26,458
There's no getting around that.

1570
01:39:26,541 --> 01:39:29,583
We also broke the rules
by going off the list.

1571
01:39:30,166 --> 01:39:34,166
However,
you did those things in good faith.

1572
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:38,375
The fact you'd risk your afterlife
to help someone not on your list

1573
01:39:38,458 --> 01:39:40,958
and take full responsibility
to protect me,

1574
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:42,458
well, I mean, it's just...

1575
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:43,791
it's beyond selfless.

1576
01:39:43,875 --> 01:39:45,291
So you're not in trouble?

1577
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Even better.

1578
01:39:48,458 --> 01:39:49,833
Thanks to your testimony,

1579
01:39:51,083 --> 01:39:52,291
I've been promoted.

1580
01:39:52,375 --> 01:39:55,416
You have? Val, that's amazing!

1581
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:57,250
I know!

1582
01:39:57,333 --> 01:39:58,333
Yeah.

1583
01:40:02,083 --> 01:40:03,833
I'm afraid to ask, but...

1584
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:06,791
what about me?

1585
01:40:09,416 --> 01:40:11,291
It's time to find out.

1586
01:40:30,375 --> 01:40:32,125
And for my last job...

1587
01:40:35,458 --> 01:40:37,625
I'm gonna miss you, Val.

1588
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:41,416
The world is a better place
with you watching over it.

1589
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:48,625
I was your favorite, wasn't I?

1590
01:40:48,708 --> 01:40:49,791
Cassie,

1591
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:52,625
you know I don't pick favorites.

1592
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:13,000
- We did it!
- No, you did it.

1593
01:41:17,958 --> 01:41:20,000
The Above is waiting.

1594
01:41:24,541 --> 01:41:25,666
Thank you.

1595
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Going up?

1596
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,791
Okay, I have to address
the elephant in the elevator.

1597
01:42:14,375 --> 01:42:16,083
- Muzak, really?
- You're Kooper Keene!

1598
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:22,250
I think it's meant as a compliment
since we're both in here together.

1599
01:42:23,666 --> 01:42:24,875
We're here together?

1600
01:42:25,375 --> 01:42:29,208
Like, how can this be real?
Is this real? Are you real?

1601
01:42:29,291 --> 01:42:30,791
Yes, I am.

1602
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:33,041
It's nice to meet you, Cassie.

1603
01:42:33,666 --> 01:42:35,708
You know my name?

1604
01:42:35,791 --> 01:42:36,916
How? Why?

1605
01:42:37,541 --> 01:42:38,708
Funny story.

1606
01:42:38,791 --> 01:42:40,833
I was volunteering
in a disaster relief area

1607
01:42:40,916 --> 01:42:43,041
when disaster struck again.

1608
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:46,250
I was able to save a few people,
but I didn't make it.

1609
01:42:46,333 --> 01:42:48,375
I am so sorry.

1610
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:49,958
There's worse ways to go.

1611
01:42:50,041 --> 01:42:51,916
Yeah, there sure are.

1612
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,541
Val was in the angel committee
that sent me straight up.

1613
01:42:55,291 --> 01:42:58,375
She said that we were supposed to meet.

1614
01:43:02,125 --> 01:43:04,416
This is gonna sound really weird,

1615
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:08,958
um, but I feel like I've always known you.

1616
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:12,916
So do I.

1617
01:43:32,416 --> 01:43:33,416
What now?

1618
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:35,666
I don't know.

1619
01:43:36,375 --> 01:43:37,791
I've never been dead before.

1620
01:43:39,958 --> 01:43:41,000
Shall we do this?

1621
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,166
Let's do this.

1622
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:47,125
Thank you.
