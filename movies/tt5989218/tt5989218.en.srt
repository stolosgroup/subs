Cue "Love Sick," Bob Dylan,

4
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,938
track one, "Time Out of Mind."

5

♪ I'm walking... ♪

6
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:07,280
Yeah, that's good.

8
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:12,786
That's real good.

9
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:16,357
We open tight on a man.

10
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:19,325
Oh, hold up, hold up, hold up,
hold up, let me rephrase.

11
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:22,762
We open on our hero.

12
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:26,266
We push in on his face.

13
00:01:26,268 --> 00:01:28,869
Motherfucker,
I said push in on that shit.

14
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:32,607
Mid-20s, handsome, gay...

15
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,607
gay in that cool
cat kind of way.

16
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,410
Gay like
"Billy on the Street" gay.

17
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:40,280
Gay like, "It's who I am,
it's not all I am, baby."

18
00:01:40,282 --> 00:01:44,251
Yeah, that's one
cool cat we got over here.

19
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:47,754
But right now,
this cat's anything but cool.

20
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:49,390
This cat's in crisis.

21
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:52,259
I feel ashamed, I guess.

22
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:55,262
I know this doesn't
make me look very good,

23
00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:59,066
but it's, uh,
breaking me, and, um...

24
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,235
Let it go, brother,

25
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:01,869
let it go like a proud asshole.

26
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,771
Let it go, let it go.

27
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:05,372
I just...

28
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:08,074
He and I have been
together for so long.

29
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:11,311
I know it sounds cliché,
but I guess...

30
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:13,714
I like knowing he's
on my team, you know?

31
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,849
I know, my brother.
I hear you, my brother.

32
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,952
Let it go.

33
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:19,620
Well, this new guy
has come along.

34
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:20,754
Hmm, proceed.

35
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:22,823
He's new, he's exciting,

36
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:26,026
and he's so much younger.

37
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:28,130
Aw, ain't no shame, brother.

38
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:32,066
I know I can't stick
with someone out of loyalty.

39
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,935
And you know this.

40
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:35,835
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

41
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:38,104
I'm gonna put Sterling Shepard
in my flex wide receiver spot

42
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:39,941
and drop Larry Fitzgerald

43
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:42,609
and maybe I'll pick up
Miami D off waivers, too.

44
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:44,110
Say what now?

45
00:02:44,112 --> 00:02:46,180
Henry.

46
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:49,449
You know we've talked about how
obsessing over fantasy football

47
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:52,853
can't simply replace
obsessing over food.

48
00:02:52,855 --> 00:02:54,254
Okay, my bad.

49
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:57,924
That motherfucker
is not our hero.

50
00:02:57,926 --> 00:03:00,694
Look at that pretty
therapist over there.

51
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:04,998
Calming his anorexic fantasy
football-loving ass down.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,967
Push in on her for a sec.

53
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,436
Okay.

54
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,871
I said push in, man! Come on!

55
00:03:11,873 --> 00:03:14,074
Oh, yeah.

56
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:16,075
Now I'm seeing it.

57
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:18,746
That's a hero right there.

58
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:22,549
Amazing smile,
the silky smooth hair.

59
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:25,053
Let me look at you, girl.

60
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:28,156
Whoo! That's what
I'm talking 'bout.

61
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:30,891
Now we in bidness,
ladies and gentlemen.

62
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:34,861
We got ourselves a hero.

63
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:37,198
♪ And I wonder... ♪

64
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,501
Now, like any great hero,
our hero wasn't perfect.

65
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:42,436
She smoked, first of all,

66
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:44,972
which they normally don't
let you show in movies anymore,

67
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,206
even though we all
still smoke sometimes.

68
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,309
You know you smoke sometimes.

69
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:51,378
You and the wife
have a date night,

70
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,580
you each have two martinis,
you guys are feeling wild

71
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:56,084
so you buy a pack of
smokes on the way home

72
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:58,352
and you each smoke one
in the 7-Eleven parking lot.

73
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:00,420
Then she makes you
throw out the pack,

74
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:03,524
but instead of throwing it
out, you hide it in a plant,

75
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:05,827
and some nights,
you sneak out and have one.

76
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,728
But she smells
that shit on you

77
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,063
like she's
a nicotine detective.

78
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:12,099
She smells that shit on you

79
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:15,235
like she's Mariska Hargitay
on "Law & Order: SVU,"

80
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:16,970
- Hey.

81
00:04:16,972 --> 00:04:18,071

Probably a little banged up,
but she's gonna be fine.

00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:50,583
- Uh-oh.
- Hello, buddy.

163
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:52,619
Hey, little buddy. What?

164
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:54,354
- You feeling left out?
- See, Fuckface gets it.

165
00:07:54,356 --> 00:07:55,823
Come here, Fuckface.

166
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,890
Will loved his
wife Abby with an intensity

167
00:07:57,892 --> 00:07:59,660
usually reserved for stalkers.

168
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:03,030
She was everything a man
could ask for in a wife.

169
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,064
She was nurturing
and she was beautiful,

170
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:07,333
and she ate any kind of
sushi the chef served to her,

171
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:09,169
even the uni.

172
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:11,205
Yes, Will was sure of it:

173
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,907
Abby Dempsey was
absolutely perfect.

174
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:16,075
At least back then she was.

175
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:17,945
Listen to this for 30 seconds,

176
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:20,614
and then try and tell me
Bob Dylan's not a poet.

177
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,782
Okay. Let's listen
to Hoobastank now.

178
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:24,919
See? No, no, no, no, no,
no, no. Just 30 seconds...

179
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,121
- To Mars?
- Thir...

180
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:29,523
- Okay, let's pop that in.
- Just 30 seconds.

181
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:30,724
Baby, we've been
listening to him gargle

182
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:31,792
Shh.

183
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:33,426
- ...for, like, a month.
- Because... I know,

184
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:35,396
- because I'm in a phase.
- I can't hear this, like,

185
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,031
- Chewbacca noise anymore.
- I'm in a phase...

186
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:41,133
I just want you to just
lean into it with me, okay?

187
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:42,603
Will you please?

188
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,470
♪ Is just making me sad... ♪

189
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:46,139
This is an important album.

190
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:48,575
I mean, this is
the comeback album.

191
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:50,845
They thought he was done.
Everybody just wrote him off.

192
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:53,046
They said you don't come
back from the crazy he had,

193
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:54,447
and then boom.

194
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:56,550
'97, "Time Out of Mind."

195
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:59,353
He won three Grammys,
including Album of the Year.

196
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:02,254
He beat Radiohead
and Paul McCartney.

197
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:05,057
It was this intense,
unexpected genius.

198
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:07,460
Just hard and dark and...

199
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:11,599
and... I mean, he said,
"I'm Bob Dylan, you're not.

200
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:13,734
Eat a dick."

201
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:15,301
He told everybody
to eat a dick?

202
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:17,271
Metaphorically, he told
everyone to eat a dick.

203
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:20,807
So, listen... like, okay.

204
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,042
Okay, okay.

205
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:24,577
Shh, just listen to this.

206
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,713
Listen to this.
The man's a genius.

207
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:29,282
He's pulling from
the poetry of Keats.

208
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:30,783
He's getting...

209
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:33,019
Shh. Stop it. Stop.

210
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,288
Shh, shh. Stop.

211
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,489
Stop.

212
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:39,726
This is important to me.

213
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:41,230
Okay?

214
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:44,400

I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

257

That's good to know.

258

All right.

259
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,287
I'll see you around.

260
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:22,489
Abby, I'm waiting
for the right moment

261
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,956
'cause when I ask you out,

262
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,994
there's not gonna be
any turning back for me.

263
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:31,331
I'm not gonna date anybody
else for the rest of my life,

264
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,033
I'm not gonna love anybody

for the rest of my life.

267
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:43,442
I'm waiting for

268
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:46,080
'cause when I ask you out,

269
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:50,149
it's gonna be the most
important moment of my life.

270
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:53,354
And I just want to make
sure that I get it right.

271
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:13,172
So, how you doing today, Will?

272
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:15,441
Will.

273
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:17,744
Sorry. Did you say something?

274
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:20,281
Yes, I said,
"How are you doing?"

275
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:22,282
Uh... you know.

276
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:24,051
Same.

277
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,489
Okay.

278
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:30,856
I tried masturbating
the other day.

279
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:33,893
I tried thinking of Abby, but
I couldn't really get it done,

280
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:37,129
so then I, um...

281
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:40,533
I tried thinking of you...

282
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:43,802
but, you know,
you jerk off to your therapist,

283
00:13:43,804 --> 00:13:45,873
you should be
institutionalized.

284
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,008
You were institutionalized.

285
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,847
Touché.

286
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:03,456
She left six months ago today.

287
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,624
That's right.

288
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:07,694
And you've been in a facility

289
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,396
for almost half that time,

290
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:12,802
and now I, I can't
help but wonder...

291
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:18,241
Will, are you listening to me?

292
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:21,074
Okay.

293
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,942
So, I'm just wondering
how you're doing

294
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:25,744
being back in the world again.

295
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:28,617
Uh, you know. Same.

296
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:34,488
I did the writing exercise
you asked me to do.

297
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,757
Really? I'm surprised.

298
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,058
You've been so resistant
to writing down your feelings.

299
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,795
Oh, no, I didn't do that.
I wrote a movie instead.

300
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,398
I did, like, uh, like, well,
like, five pages of a movie.

301
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,167
It was very bad.

302
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:50,503
Abby and I always talked about
writing a screenplay together.

303
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:52,004
Like a...

304
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:54,173
husband and wife
Tarantino, you know?

305
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:57,377
...I'm "Super Fly T.N.T."

306
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,144
You wouldn't have liked it.

307
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:01,181
My screenplay.

308
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:03,816
You were in it, kind of.

309
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:07,924
Abby wasn't, which, you know,
I know was the whole point.

310
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:14,293
I met this guy,
when I was institutionalized.

311
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:17,297
This really sweet guy.

312
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,599
Horrible life.

313
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:22,835
All he could talk about without
crying was fantasy football,

314
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:25,274
so he talked about it a lot.

315
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,008
I liked that guy.

316
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,344
Great face.

317
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,180
A movie star face, you know.

318
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,514
Oh, poor motherfucker
was the only guy there

319
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:37,149
that seemed worse
off than I was.

320
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:39,152
We'd have dinner
every night together.

321
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:41,120
And then one night
he didn't show up,

322
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:43,556
which sucked for him
'cause it was pizza night.

323
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:45,558
Turned out he'd...

324
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:51,100
How'd that make you feel?

325
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,903
Happy for him.

326
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,672
Or at least relieved.

327
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:02,341
I mean, you know,
he was pretty miserable.

328
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:04,411
And I'm no doctor,

329
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:06,779
but I don't think he's
ever gonna feel any better.

330
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:09,849
Okay, well, that brings me
back to my initial question.

331
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:11,320
How are you feeling?

332
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,523
Uh, you know. Same.

333
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:18,325
You keep saying that.

334
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,259
I keep meaning it.

335
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:24,299
Have you spoken to her,
Will, since you've been out?

336
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,835
Abby, please,
can you come back to me?

337
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:30,269
- I'm sorry.
- This sucks, man.

338
00:16:30,271 --> 00:16:32,638
- This fucking sucks.
- I got to go. I'm sorry.

339
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,639
- I got to go.
- Please.

340
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,411
No.

341
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,648
Have you been to your
parents', like we discussed?

342
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,850
I don't want to.

343
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:46,753
Will, part of the reason
that you were discharged

344
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,321
and put into my...

345
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:50,793
I don't want to!

346
00:16:54,896 --> 00:16:57,163
Sorry. That was weird.

347
00:16:57,165 --> 00:17:01,634
Yesterday, you said that
you'd been feeling aimless.

348
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:05,438
Well, I usually have
pretty good aim, so...

Seriously.

Let's get married.

367
00:17:57,191 --> 00:17:59,458
We've been dating
less than a year.

368
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,093
Yeah, I know.

369
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:02,762
And I feel like I've shown
incredible restraint

370
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:04,263
waiting this long.

371
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:05,831
Say yes.

372
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,167
- You want to say yes.
- No, I don't.

373
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:10,003
You want to say
yes so bad it hurts.

374
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,340
- You're cocky.
- I'm right.

375
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,042
Say yes.

376
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:16,376
Say yes.

377
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:18,978
Or I swear to God,
if you don't say yes,

378
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,348
I will shoot this nimrod
on general principle.

379
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,117
Stop it.

380
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,185
Please say,
"Yes, I'll marry you,"

381
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,386
or I'll fucking shoot myself...

382
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,421
- Stop! Will!
- Say, "Yes, I'll marry you."

383
00:18:28,423 --> 00:18:30,490
Stop!

384
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:32,394
Sorry. That was weird.

385
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,965
I love you.

386
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:42,836
You're the love of my life,
I'm sure of it.

387
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:47,107
But sometimes it scares
me how much you feel.

388
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:48,774
You know?

389
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:50,542
It's not something
I ever thought I would...

390
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:52,515
be scared of, but...

391
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,224
I may not be equipped
to be loved this much.

392
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,594
I'll find another way.

393
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:10,362
- No...
- I'll find another way.

394
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:12,032
Hey. I will.

395
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,599
I will love you

396
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:17,303
however you're best
equipped to handle it, Abby.

397
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:18,871
I will love you...

398
00:19:18,873 --> 00:19:22,143
on odd days of the week...

399
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,878
Baby, I will spend
the rest of my life

400
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,118
making your life better,
not worse.

401
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:35,955
I want to dance.

402
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:38,957
I want to win.

403
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:41,962
I want that trophy.

404
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:43,730
Ah, what a gyp.

405
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:44,898
Come on.

406

Okay.

418
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:36,582
I mean, I want kids, too,
but not yet.

419
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:38,120
Okay.

420
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:42,188
Dog first. Small dog.

421
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,625
Yeah.

422
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:49,795
My parents died young;
it makes me sad sometimes.

423
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:52,064
I know.

424
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:54,900
It'd probably make me
a terrible mother.

425
00:20:54,902 --> 00:20:57,538
I disagree, but... okay.

426
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:00,773
Mainly, my big
thing is the dog.

427
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:03,243
Small dog.

428
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:06,015
I am totally on board
with the dog idea.

429
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:11,019
Okay, I'll marry you.

430
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:18,657
- Okay.
- Okay.

431
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:20,327
You want to meet my parents?

432
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:24,198
Sure.

433
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:30,306
Cool.

434
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:39,081
Thanks.

435
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:43,582
- How are you?!
- Oh, my God, Abby!

436
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:44,984
Look at you!

437
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:46,017
- Oh...
- Oh, you look beautiful!

438
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:47,087
- How are you both?
- Great.

439
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:48,355
- Everybody's good?
- Yeah.

440
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:49,421
- Hey, buddy boy.
- Hey, Pop.

441
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:51,057
- Look at you!
- How are you, man?

442
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,192
- Good.
- Oh, my...

443
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:53,259
- You're positively...
- Revolting.

444
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:55,261
- No! Stop. No.
- Yeah. And gassy.

445
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:57,263
- You popped.
- She is, Mom. She's really gassy.

446
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:59,299
- That means it's gonna be a boy.
- Really?

447
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:00,867
Yeah. I practically
needed a hazmat suit

448
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:01,801
when your mother was
pregnant with you.

449
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:03,002
Stop that!

450
00:22:03,004 --> 00:22:04,103
- It's true.
- Farts mean it's a boy!

451
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,137
That almost makes
them worth it.

452
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:06,472
Anything happening down there?

453
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:08,742
Linda, I'm afraid to
ask, but did you make that...

454
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,944
Meat loaf is coming
out of the oven right now.

455
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:12,744
- Oh, yeah!
- I have never craved anything

456
00:22:12,746 --> 00:22:14,813
like this in my life. Lead me
to that meat loaf and...

457
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:16,249
I hate fucking meat loaf.

458
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,283
...and backhanded
compliment me all day long.

459
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:20,552
I'm just grateful she didn't
burn down the fucking kitchen.

460
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:22,388
What'd you do to get the foot

461
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,889
- unstuck from the...
- You just push.

462
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:25,425
I'm not a big fan of, like,

463
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,859
when the face goes like this...

464
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:27,959
Dog dishes.

465
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:29,395
...against the
outside of the belly.

466
00:22:29,397 --> 00:22:31,130
- It's like an alien.
- How do you know it's the face?

467
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:32,831
- Looks like an alien.
- You actually see the face?

468
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,567
- I'm pretty sure it's a face.
- No, I don't... that's creepy.

469
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:35,901
Is it possible
that it's clawing out?

470
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:37,670
This is... Mom.

471
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:40,106
You're aware that the baby's
not gonna actually live with

472
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,340
- you guys, right?
- I got a little carried away.

473
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:43,209
- This one's very cute.
- Sue me.

474
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:44,543
- Isn't that cute?
- Yes.

475
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:46,346
You better eat some of this
before she gets it all.

476
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:47,480
- Okay.
- Baby clothes, baby jumpers.

477
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:48,982
Tell me something,
what the hell's

478
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:52,284
a baby jumper for, anyway?

479
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:54,153
Why does a baby need to jump?

480
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:55,353
All I know is I spend all day

481
00:22:55,355 --> 00:22:57,791
breaking down
the goddamn Amazon boxes.

482
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,091
Oh, shush, you.

483
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:00,793
Here, honey, a little
bit more. Come on.

484
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:02,329
He's good. He's good.

485
00:23:02,331 --> 00:23:04,597
- Ay. Ay-yi-yi.
- There's two, there's two of me.

486
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,533
- Oh.
- Oh, piggy-wiggy.

487
00:23:07,535 --> 00:23:09,869
I can't believe
I'm gonna be a grandma!

488
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:11,370
I still can't believe it.

489
00:23:11,372 --> 00:23:12,938
- All right, settle down.
- Still can't believe it.

490
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,072
- Abby?
- Mm-hmm?

491
00:23:14,074 --> 00:23:15,440
Don't take this the wrong way.

492
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:16,943
- Oh, here it comes.
- Yep.

493
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:18,610
But, selfishly speaking,

494
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:20,746
I'm just so glad
your parents are dead.

495
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:24,082
- And... boom.
- Oh, stop it.

496
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:25,819
Abby knows what I mean.

497
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,320
Really, yeah?
She does? You do?

498
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,987
She's gonna explain.

499
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:32,391
What I mean is...
all I ever wanted

500
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:34,593
was for Will to marry a
woman with dead parents,

501
00:23:34,595 --> 00:23:36,262
so I wouldn't have to
share the grandchildren,

502
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:37,330
and, and he did.

503
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,332
I mean, my prayer came true.

504
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:42,034
Jesus Christ, Mom!

505
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:44,070
It's okay!
She knows what I mean.

506
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,874
- Hey, Abby, by the way...
- Mm.

507
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:49,908
...did you get a look at
that book I sent you yet?

508
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:50,976
No.

509
00:23:50,978 --> 00:23:52,111
It's really good.
It's about preschool

510
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:53,480
- and anxiety separation.
- Oh, good.

511
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:56,215
That feels like a first
priority thing.

512
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,417
'Cause when you...

513
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:01,120
Sorry, I will, I will admit.
I admit, I'm sorry.

514
00:24:01,122 --> 00:24:02,888
Just talk about
her dead parents again, Mom.

515
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:06,024
Thank you.

516
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:07,760
- It's about separation anxiety.
- Yeah.

517
00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:09,661
So when you drop 'em off at
preschool for the first day...

518
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:12,197
...and they, they go
nuts and they go limp.

519
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:14,166
- Yeah.
- Live your own life!

520
00:24:14,168 --> 00:24:15,767
- Mind your own fucking...
- Shush. Shush.

521
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:18,236
When you drop
the kid off at preschool,

522
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:20,039
if they get hysterical
and inconsolable...

523
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,707
Both Abby's parents

524
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:24,610
died in a car accident
when she was a little girl.

525
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:28,447
Abby was in the car.
She was seven.

526
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:31,417
Okay.

527
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:33,852
"Okay" seems kind of
like a strange response

528
00:24:33,854 --> 00:24:36,288
to that new information.

529
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,925
Well, I was caught
a little off guard.

530
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:41,060
You don't talk
about Abby a lot.

531
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,995
You don't ask about her a lot.

532
00:24:43,997 --> 00:24:46,866
Will, I ask about
her constantly.

533
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:49,735
Tomato, potato.

534
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:51,471
Tomato, to-mah-to.

535
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:54,506
Let's just call
the whole thing off.

536
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:57,843
Well, the sessions
are mandated, so...

537
00:24:57,845 --> 00:25:00,647
No. Uh, the...

538
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:02,215
- ...the song, the...
- What? I... I'm not following.

539
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:03,849
Oh, my God,

540
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:06,185
this is some kind of
rhythm we have, huh, Doc?

541
00:25:06,187 --> 00:25:08,790
Maybe this is why
I can't jerk off to you.

542
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:12,891
Sorry, that was
very inappropriate.

543
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:14,359
I was institutionalized.

544
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:16,763
Why don't you just
tell me about Abby.

545
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,064
What, what was she like?
I'd like to hear about her.

546
00:25:19,066 --> 00:25:20,934
You want me to tell
you about Abby?

547
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,436
Well, then you've come
to the right place, Doc,

548
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:27,040
because I am the foremost
expert on all things Abby.

549
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:28,944
Or... I was.

550
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:31,410
No, I still am.

551
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:32,946
I mean, it's not like somebody
else has learned more about

552
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:33,980
her in the last six months.

553
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:35,080
Or I guess somebody could have.

554
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:37,550
I mean... I've been locked away

555
00:25:37,552 --> 00:25:40,219
and Lord knows what she's
been up to, wherever she is.

556
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:42,288
- Will?
- Right.

557
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,322
You want to know about Abby.

558
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:44,523
Let me tell you about Abby.

559
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:46,292
You got it.
Last one. Last one.

560
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:51,296
Abby Lesher was
born June 30, 1985.

561
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:54,266
Legend has it that,
when she was born,

562
00:25:54,268 --> 00:25:57,336
she didn't make a single peep.

563
00:25:57,338 --> 00:26:00,473
For five minutes, little
Abby just laid there

564
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,541
taking in the world around her,

565
00:26:02,543 --> 00:26:05,311
- not so much as a single cry.
- Hi.

566
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,513
In the years to come, her
parents would always say,

567
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:09,682
"There wasn't anything
wrong with little Abby."

568
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:13,552
She just didn't have
anything to say yet."

569
00:26:13,554 --> 00:26:16,088
Now keep in mind, I'm
getting all this secondhand.

570
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,659
I've never met any of the
people here, except for Abby.

571
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:23,663
Her parents died pretty soon.

572
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,565
Long before I come
into the picture.

573
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,568
- No, I know.
- And it's not like

574
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,135
I know the doctor
or the nurses here.

575
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:31,370
- Why would I?
- Right.

576
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:33,205
Please continue, Will.

577
00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:34,642
Okay.

578
00:26:36,044 --> 00:26:40,480
By all accounts, Abby's
childhood was a happy one.

579
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:42,048
Family, I've gathered you
here today 'cause I, I need

580
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,118
to talk about something very
serious, so no laughing.

581
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,985
Uh, as you may have noticed,

582
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:49,855
I... have developed a bit
of a drinking problem.

583
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,657
Her parents,
Jack and Elizabeth,

584
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:55,427
were kindhearted and openhearted

585
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:56,862
and all the other
kinds of "hearted."

586
00:26:56,864 --> 00:26:58,598
They were literally both
elementary school teachers.

587
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,968
That's actually how
they, how they met.

588
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:12,012
Mind if I sit?

589
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,048
If Abby's mother knew

590
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,483
that she would meet her future
husband at exactly that moment,

591
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:19,752
you think she would have
taken such a big old bite

592
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:22,021
of that peanut butter
and jelly sandwich?

593
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:23,925
Um...

594
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,561
- Would you like some water?
- Mm.

595
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:32,865
Wow. You fit half the
sandwich in your mouth.

596
00:27:35,602 --> 00:27:38,103
So strange to think about.

597
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:40,807
How a completely random moment
involving peanut butter,

598
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:44,510
a moment that happened
way before I was born,

599
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,579
would shape my entire life.

600
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:50,485
Are you glad it happened?

601
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,256
Ah, well, Dr. Morris,
that is the big question.

602
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,358
Isn't it? Because if
it hadn't happened,

603
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,693
Abby's parents would
never have met.

604
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:03,128
They'd never have married,
they'd never have

605
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,430
honeymooned in Aruba
where they conceived Abby.

606
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:07,233
They'd never have seen her

607
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:08,734
come into the world
without a peep.

608
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:11,204
They'd never have watched
her blonde hair turn brown

609
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:12,605
as she got older.

610
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,940
They'd never have watched her
become obsessed with dancing

611
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:16,007
and then soccer

612
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:19,244
and then horses and,
of course, Christmas.

613
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:20,679
Always Christmas.

614
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:23,948
The lights, the gifts,
and above all, the Rockettes.

615
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,385
So obsessed with the
Rockettes was Abby

616
00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:28,655
that every year,
every single year,

617
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:30,523
her parents would have
to drive her into town

618
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:31,991
to watch the Rockettes perform.

619
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:35,429
Every single year,
except that one year...

620
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,132
Abby's parents died instantly.

621
00:28:41,134 --> 00:28:43,735
Abby was trapped
in the backseat of the car

622
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:47,372
with them for over an hour
before they got her out.

623
00:28:47,374 --> 00:28:48,709
Her father...

624
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:53,715
...her father was decapitated
by the steering column.

625
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,783
I know, right?

626
00:28:57,785 --> 00:28:59,819
That's the detail that
always gets everybody.

627
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,821
I mean, the story in and of
itself is tragic of course,

628
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,657
but when you give
someone that image,

629
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,292
that singular image of
a seven year old girl

630
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:09,161
trapped in the
backseat of a car

631
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:10,629
with her decapitated father,

632
00:29:10,631 --> 00:29:14,602
well, then it really
just lands, doesn't it?

633
00:29:16,772 --> 00:29:20,438
Anyhoo, you wanted to
know about Abby, so...

634
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,442
I'll continue,
but be forewarned,

635
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:24,077
her next decade isn't so great.

636
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:29,815
Abby's parents didn't
plan on dying together,

637
00:29:29,817 --> 00:29:32,185
so there was no will and
there was no plan for Abby.

638
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,320
And seeing as all her
grandparents were deceased,

639
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:37,659
Abby's Uncle Joe got custody.

640
00:29:41,728 --> 00:29:43,730
Now, Uncle Joe
wasn't a nice man.

641
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:45,531
And when I say he
wasn't a nice man,

642
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,300
I don't mean like
he didn't hug her.

643
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:49,702
I mean, he bought her a
puppy and then he killed it

644
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,036
when it chewed up his couch.

645
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:52,771
I mean, he sporadically
molested her

646
00:29:52,773 --> 00:29:54,473
for the better
part of six years,

647
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:56,641
until, at 15 years old,

648
00:29:56,643 --> 00:29:58,676
Abby borrowed a gun from
some wannabe gangbanger

649
00:29:58,678 --> 00:30:00,946
from her high school, she
pointed it at Uncle Joe's head

650
00:30:00,948 --> 00:30:03,649
and said in no
uncertain terms...

651
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:05,850
I'll fucking kill you if
you ever touch me again.

652
00:30:05,852 --> 00:30:07,453
And then she shot
him in the knee,

653
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:08,553
so he knew she wasn't playing.

654
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:12,590
Fuck! Ow!

655
00:30:15,362 --> 00:30:17,362
It's like a movie, right?

656
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:20,765
I always pictured a young
Natalie Portman playing her.

657
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,935
I don't know who that is.

658
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:25,338
You don't know who
Natalie Portman is?

659
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,506
- No.
- Doc, you got to get out more.

660
00:30:27,508 --> 00:30:29,140
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

661
00:30:29,142 --> 00:30:30,208
I'll tell you what.

662
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,644
One of these nights,
we'll do, like, a marathon

663
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:33,245
of early Portman.

664
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:35,514
Beautiful Girls,
The Professional.

665
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:37,050
You'll see what
I'm talking about.

666
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:38,850
- Okay?
- Okay.

667
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:41,420
Right.

668
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,955
Okay, well, uh...

669
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:45,925
well, things got
better from there.

670
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,760
Obviously, damage
had been done.

671
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,829
Decapitated father, molesting
uncle, you don't just, like,

672
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:51,996
bounce back from
that shit, but...

673
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:57,102
Abby was smart, determined,
a dreamer, a reader.

674
00:30:57,104 --> 00:31:00,807
She hunkered down, she
got herself into college,

675
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,774
started seeing a
therapist on campus

676
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:05,645
who truly changed her life.

677
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,182
She even made a
very close friend.

678
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:21,260
You're gonna get me kicked out.

679
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:23,227
Could you please stop?

680
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:25,598
I'm so sorry.

681
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,867
Oh, my God, Doc,
look. Oh, my God.

682
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:30,002
Look.

683
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:31,637
Oh.

684
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,139
Look at me. This is what
I looked like in college.

685
00:31:34,141 --> 00:31:37,076
I have 491 more pages.

686
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:40,079
Oh, my God, look
how young I look.

687
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:42,380
No, no, I think you look
very much the same.

688
00:31:42,382 --> 00:31:44,850
Oh, well, I think I look like
a completely different person.

689
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:47,552
Yeah, tomato, to-mah-to.

690
00:31:47,554 --> 00:31:50,822
Doc, look at us.

691
00:31:50,824 --> 00:31:52,757
Maybe we have a
chance after all.

692
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,827
Yeah.

693
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,997
Anyway, Abby really came
into her own in college.

694
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:01,032
My aim.

695
00:32:01,034 --> 00:32:03,569
She engaged in
the outside world,

696
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:05,705
she became extremely popular,

697
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:07,907
she even fell in love.

698
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:11,209
Not to toot my own
horn, but toot, toot!

699
00:32:11,211 --> 00:32:13,779
She graduated top of her class
with an English lit degree.

700
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:15,880
Yeah, she wrote
her thesis on...

701
00:32:15,882 --> 00:32:17,616
The Unreliable Narrator!

702
00:32:17,618 --> 00:32:19,451
The Unreliable Narrator.

703
00:32:19,453 --> 00:32:20,820
- What's that?
- My thesis.

704
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:22,254
Hey, guys, what's up?

705
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:25,190
Unreliable narrators are
considered a device, right?

706
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:26,658
Don't answer.
They are. They are.

707
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,494
And they don't get a
lot of literary analysis

708
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:30,094
because it's a
gimmick, it's a trick.

709
00:32:30,096 --> 00:32:32,630
I mean, "Canterbury Tales"
gets a, gets a shout-out

710
00:32:32,632 --> 00:32:34,265
because, you know, it's good,

711
00:32:34,267 --> 00:32:37,802
but then typically, it's used
for popcorn crime novels

712
00:32:37,804 --> 00:32:39,906
and thriller movies, like
Agatha Christie, Usual Suspects,

713
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:40,973
- so on and so forth.
- Right.

714
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:43,675
But I'm gonna argue
that every narrator,

715
00:32:43,677 --> 00:32:46,779
by its very definition,
is unreliable.

716
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:48,447
Because when you tell a story,

717
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:49,814
there's always an
essential distance

718
00:32:49,816 --> 00:32:51,716
between the story
itself and the telling

719
00:32:51,718 --> 00:32:53,218
of said story, right?

720
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,822
So, therefore, every story
that has ever been told

721
00:32:57,824 --> 00:32:59,992
has an unreliable narrator.

722
00:32:59,994 --> 00:33:02,028
The only truly reliable
narrator would be

723
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,263
someone hypothetically
telling a story that unfolds

724
00:33:04,265 --> 00:33:06,064
before our very eyes, which
is obviously impossible.

725
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:08,567
So, what does that tell us?

726
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,236
That the only truly
reliable narrator

727
00:33:11,238 --> 00:33:14,339
is life itself.

728
00:33:14,341 --> 00:33:19,077
But life itself is also a
completely unreliable narrator

729
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:21,379
because it is
constantly misdirecting

730
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:23,382
and misleading us and
taking us on this journey

731
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:25,551
where it is literally
impossible to predict

732
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:27,386
where it's gonna go next.

733
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:29,988
And that is my thesis!

734
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,492
Life as the ultimate
unreliable narrator.

735
00:33:33,494 --> 00:33:36,795
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

736
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:38,363
It'll make more sense when
I write it. I love you.

737
00:33:38,365 --> 00:33:40,632
Bye, guys.

738
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:42,134
I love you.

739
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:44,703
- You're up.
- I love her, Chuck.

740
00:33:44,705 --> 00:33:46,004
Yeah. Come on.

741
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:48,440
- Holy shit.
- Your turn.

742
00:33:48,442 --> 00:33:51,145
I love you, Abby!

743
00:33:53,814 --> 00:33:55,648
Hey, before, when I
invited you over to watch

744
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,916
Natalie Portman movies,

745
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:58,684
you know I was just
being funny, right?

746
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:00,552
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

747
00:34:00,554 --> 00:34:02,788
'Cause I'm still married, so...

748
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,456
At least I think I am.

749
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,457
I mean, I haven't signed
any papers or anything yet,

750
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:08,961
so I don't really know
how the whole thing works.

751
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:12,296
Will, it's fine. Okay?

752
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:15,033
Take a deep breath.

753
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:19,073
And you can tell me
about your marriage now.

754
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:27,546
You want me to tell
you about my marriage?

755
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:29,381
Yeah.

756
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:30,883
So, you haven't, you haven't
really been listening

757
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:32,785
to me, then, because...

758
00:34:32,787 --> 00:34:34,452
it doesn't matter what
I tell you, don't you...

759
00:34:34,454 --> 00:34:36,055
I don't... Why
can't you lean into this

760
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,390
- just one fucking time?
- You see that, right?

761
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:39,124
Doesn't matter what I say,
'cause I could tell you

762
00:34:39,126 --> 00:34:40,626
every detail about our marriage.

763
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:42,093
I could tell you every detail

764
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:44,495
about the day that
she left me, but...

765
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:47,365
why, why would my memory
even be remotely accurate?

766
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:49,135
- I'm going through a phase!
- Yeah, but why do I

767
00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:50,669
- have to listen...
- And I'm asking you, just...

768
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,037
Maybe...
maybe I'd actually

769
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,006
been smothering her for years.

770
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,008
- No. Stop.
- Smothering her with my love

771
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,843
and my dreams and a baby
that she wasn't ready for.

772
00:34:58,845 --> 00:35:00,312
Crushed him.

773
00:35:00,314 --> 00:35:03,215
Maybe I was just
another guy that was in her life

774
00:35:03,217 --> 00:35:04,850
that seemed like I
was gonna save it,

775
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,955
but really I was just
there to ruin it.

776
00:35:09,122 --> 00:35:11,423
Maybe she was really
unhappy and this dream girl

777
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:13,425
that I created in my
mind's eye was just like

778
00:35:13,427 --> 00:35:17,932
a narrative trick, to get us
through a life, you know?

779
00:35:29,075 --> 00:35:31,008
I mean, this is really some

780
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,611
deep philosophical shit
we're talking about here.

781
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:37,084
Yes, it is. It is.

782
00:35:40,186 --> 00:35:41,221
Will...

783
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:47,725
we've been seeing each
other for a while now.

784
00:35:47,727 --> 00:35:51,796
And today, you're talking about
Abby a lot for the first time.

785
00:35:51,798 --> 00:35:54,466
And it's good.

786
00:35:54,468 --> 00:35:56,001
It's really good.

787
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:59,474
So, tell me about that day.

788
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,908
You had a nice
morning with Abby...

789
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,943
- No, no.
- ...talking about Bob Dylan.

790
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:07,079
I didn't. I didn't.
That's not what I fucking said.

791
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,981
I just said that it may not
have been a nice morning.

792
00:36:08,983 --> 00:36:10,115
- Okay.
- I said that it could've been

793
00:36:10,117 --> 00:36:11,383
a smothering, horrible morning.

794
00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:14,019
Okay. It could've been a
smothering, horrible morning.

795
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:17,088
You talked about Bob Dylan,

796
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,091
then you went over to your
parents' house for lunch,

797
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,896
and then what happened?

798
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:27,099
Then she just left me.
Then she just left me.

799
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,901
Will, she didn't
just leave you.

800
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:30,839
She just left. Yes, she did.

801
00:36:33,073 --> 00:36:37,345
Have you seen Abby since
you've been released, Will?

802
00:36:39,046 --> 00:36:41,113
Come
back to me, Abby.

803
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,314
Please come back to me.
I'll, I'll do anything.

804
00:36:43,316 --> 00:36:44,550
- Will?
- Just give me another chance.

805
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:46,017
Will?

806
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:49,887
I'm talking to my fucking wife!

807
00:36:49,889 --> 00:36:52,993
But your wife wasn't
there, was she?

808
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:04,336
I don't know. What am I
doing? What are you doing?

809
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:05,640
Will...

810
00:37:06,907 --> 00:37:08,974
...you're not well yet.

811
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,776
Okay? You're mixing meds.

812
00:37:11,778 --> 00:37:14,248
You're, you're not yourself.

813
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:20,622
Tell me about that day.

814
00:37:30,162 --> 00:37:32,564
We talked about Bob Dylan.

815
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:34,534
Okay.

816
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,370
We laughed.

817
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:40,575
Okay.

818
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,111
Go ahead.

819
00:37:47,113 --> 00:37:49,682
We almost crushed the dog.

820
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,653
Okay.

821
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,921
We went to my parents' house.

822
00:37:56,923 --> 00:37:59,126
Right.

823
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:03,896
We ate meat loaf.

824
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:05,798
Oh, my God, my mom's crazy.

825
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,865
- She's totally fucking nuts.
- She is.

826
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,999
We're never
gonna do that again.

827
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:09,267
Oh, gosh.

828
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:11,602
- How you feeling, my love?
- I ate too much.

829
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:15,207
- You think?
- Just a little bit.

830
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,276
You freakin' ate
the gross national

831
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:19,178
meat loaf product
of a small nation.

832
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,180
I think we might have a meat
loaf instead of a human baby.

833
00:38:22,182 --> 00:38:23,280
You're giving
birth to meat loaf?

834
00:38:23,282 --> 00:38:25,050
Yeah, we're having meat loaf.

835
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,220
- Cab?
- No.

836
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,354
- Walk it off?
- Yes, please.

837
00:38:29,356 --> 00:38:30,321
All right, let's walk it off.

838
00:38:30,323 --> 00:38:32,356
My heart's on fire.

839
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:34,825
Not in a good way.

840
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,276
The baby's a girl, Will.

841
00:38:50,278 --> 00:38:51,475
What?

842
00:38:51,477 --> 00:38:53,477
I know we weren't
gonna find out,

843
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:57,284
but then the nurse slipped up,
and now I feel shitty knowing.

844
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,289
In about three weeks,
you're gonna have a daughter.

845
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,560
Say something.

846
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:11,896
What?

847
00:39:11,898 --> 00:39:14,001
I know what you
want to name her.

848
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,970
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

849
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:20,604
Yeah, I think so.

850
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:22,608
I know you don't like
his music, but...

851
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,008
I love it.

852
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,878
Big fan.

853
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,245
I think it's cute.
I think it's...

854
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:34,653
I was smothering her.
I was smothering her.

855
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:36,290
That's why she left me.

856
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:42,026
Will, listen, you
suffered a trauma.

857
00:39:42,028 --> 00:39:43,128
It was horrific.

858
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,162
- Can you fucking help me?!
- Horrific.

859
00:39:45,164 --> 00:39:47,265
Help me, please!

860
00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:50,234
You thought
about killing yourself.

861
00:39:50,236 --> 00:39:54,273
You... you were in
treatment for months

862
00:39:54,275 --> 00:39:56,541
to keep you safe.

863
00:39:56,543 --> 00:39:59,111
And now you're,
you're constructing a story

864
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:02,250
that somehow makes it bearable.

865
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:07,720
Will... you have a baby.

866
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:09,653
All right?

867
00:40:09,655 --> 00:40:11,258
Your baby lived.

868
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:17,629
For whatever reason,
miraculously, she's alive.

869
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:22,103
Now, Will, wouldn't Abby want
you to be there for that child?

870
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:26,671
Now, why haven't you
gone to your parents'?

871
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:28,407
Will, look at me.

872
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:31,378
Why haven't you seen that baby?

873
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:35,213
I think it would help you.

874
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:37,283
- Okay.
- That's why you're out,

875
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:39,852
and that's why you're
seeing me, to get you there.

876
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,720
I, I think you're ready.

877
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:43,424
Okay.

878
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:47,524
I'm gonna go.

879
00:40:47,526 --> 00:40:49,461
No, hang on, Will.
Will, hang on.

880
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:51,396
No, I don't want you
to leave yet. Let's...

881
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:53,432
That's not the right story. No.

882
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:55,399
I'm not really the
hero of the story.

883
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:57,301
This is, trauma
is vicious, Will.

884
00:40:57,303 --> 00:40:59,637
I'm sorry. You're very nice.

885
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,506
You're very nice.

886
00:41:01,508 --> 00:41:03,408
I don't want to
be here anymore.

887
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,042
Look, just sit
down. We can...

888
00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:06,477
Let me talk you
through this.

889
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:07,178
Bye.

Dylan Dempsey's childhood

895
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,566
was marked by death
and tragedy would be

896
00:42:01,568 --> 00:42:03,468
the grossest
of understatements,

897
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,738
and also a little bit douchey.

898
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,407
She was literally born
of death and tragedy.

899
00:42:09,977 --> 00:42:11,776
Six months into
her little life,

900
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:13,945
her father started
locking in the pattern.

901
00:42:15,381 --> 00:42:17,284
And that was just the start.

902
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:24,492
Dylan lost her grandma

Come in.

910
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:16,374
How you feeling, kiddo?

911
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:19,343
I feel like my whole
life is gonna be

912
00:43:19,345 --> 00:43:22,814
marked by death and tragedy.

913
00:43:22,816 --> 00:43:24,850
She did not
say this, of course,

914
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,818
but if she could verbalize
what she was feeling

915
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,922
at eight years old,
she would've.

916
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,359
I crave a happy life, Grandpa.

917
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:37,695
I have a almost
desperate craving

918
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:40,198
for stability and happiness,

919
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,166
the way fat people
crave chocolate

920
00:43:42,168 --> 00:43:44,436
or lost hikers crave rescue.

921
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:48,372
I want to live a big,
great, fantastical life,

922
00:43:48,374 --> 00:43:50,209
but I'm concerned that

923
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,443
the tragedy
that seems to follow me,

924
00:43:52,445 --> 00:43:54,379
the tragedy that birthed me

925
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,847
will prevent that
from ever happening.

926
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:59,017
And I don't know
if I can withstand

927
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:00,888
another body blow like this.

928
00:44:02,021 --> 00:44:04,455
But what she really said was...

929
00:44:04,457 --> 00:44:07,225
How you feeling, kiddo?

930
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,095
Are you gonna die, Grandpa?

931
00:44:10,097 --> 00:44:13,633
Yes. I am.

932
00:44:15,802 --> 00:44:19,137
Probably sooner than
you'd like, kiddo...

933
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:21,071
if I'm being honest.

934
00:44:21,073 --> 00:44:24,075
I'm gonna fight like hell
to stick around for you

935
00:44:24,077 --> 00:44:28,280
as long as possible,
to prevent one more death

936
00:44:28,282 --> 00:44:31,515
from coming anywhere
near your doorstep.

937
00:44:31,517 --> 00:44:33,417
I'm gonna get on
the fucking treadmill,

938
00:44:33,419 --> 00:44:36,588
cut back on the red meat.

939
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,457
I'm gonna do my best.

940
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:40,490
Get you through
your teenage years

941
00:44:40,492 --> 00:44:44,562
without losing
one more goddamn thing.

942
00:44:44,564 --> 00:44:47,532
Gonna do it for
your mother and father.

943
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:50,102
I'm gonna do it
for your grandmother.

944
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,441
Most of all, I'm gonna do
it for you, granddaughter.

945
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:57,843
I'm gonna squeeze
out ten more years

946
00:44:57,845 --> 00:45:02,213
from this decrepit old body,
for you, my girl.

947
00:45:02,215 --> 00:45:04,883
My angel.

948
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:07,251
Again, Irwin
expressed this all with...

949
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:10,357
No. No more dying
around here, kiddo.

950
00:45:14,595 --> 00:45:18,399
- Okay?
- Okay.

951
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:31,575
The Dylan Dempsey
transformation years.

952
00:45:31,577 --> 00:45:33,510
The years brought puberty.

953
00:45:33,512 --> 00:45:36,013
Puberty brought sexuality.

954
00:45:36,015 --> 00:45:41,186
Sexuality brought anger
and fear and confusion.

955
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:42,954
And when the smoke cleared,

956
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:45,557
where that sweet
little girl once stood,

957
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:47,158
there remained only a woman

958
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,896
who scared the absolute
shit out of everyone.

959

♪ You took a part of me
that I really miss ♪

00:45:55,936 --> 00:46:01,573

it can go on like this ♪

00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:04,675

miles from you. ♪

965
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:18,523
Hey.

966
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,024
Hey. I'm going out.

967
00:46:21,026 --> 00:46:22,459
With who?

968
00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:25,262
Just with some friends.

969
00:46:25,264 --> 00:46:27,664
Cigarettes.

970
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:29,767
Grandma used to say
it's a nasty habit

971
00:46:29,769 --> 00:46:33,338
of people lighting little
fires under their noses.

972
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,640
Cool.

973
00:46:35,642 --> 00:46:39,778
You aren't even gonna try
and hide them from me?

974
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,379
Aren't we both
better than that?

975
00:46:42,381 --> 00:46:44,481
I don't know.

976
00:46:44,483 --> 00:46:46,751
You hear Vermont's
made them illegal?

977
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:49,023
Remind me never
to go to Vermont.

978
00:46:54,093 --> 00:46:56,327
- Can I have one?
- No.

979
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:59,231
Just one?

980
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,168
No, these things will kill you.

981
00:47:07,106 --> 00:47:09,908
Was hoping we could
talk about college.

982
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,410
We talked about it last night.

983
00:47:13,412 --> 00:47:15,247
- Didn't get very far.
- Yes, we did.

984
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,582
We just didn't get
where you wanted it to go.

985
00:47:18,584 --> 00:47:20,986
I'm 21, Irwin.
Give up on the dream.

986
00:47:20,988 --> 00:47:23,421
I've almost saved enough
to get out of your hair.

987
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,557
I promise.

988
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:27,557
Promise you'll
be home by 11:00?

989
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:29,494
I'd rather not lie to you.

990
00:47:29,496 --> 00:47:32,233
- Please lie to me.
- I'll be home by 11:00.

991
00:47:34,066 --> 00:47:36,070
Dylan.

992
00:47:39,706 --> 00:47:42,709
Happy 21st, kiddo.

993
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,588
Some sugar.

994
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:58,958
Mwah.

995
00:48:03,162 --> 00:48:05,131
Peace!

996
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,715
Hey.
Hey, everyone.

997
00:48:56,717 --> 00:48:59,015
We're PB&J.

998
00:48:59,017 --> 00:49:01,419

Um...

1002
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:10,729
My mom died
21 years ago today, and...

Take it off!

1004
00:49:17,738 --> 00:49:19,870
They tell me she used
to listen to Bob Dylan.

00:49:19,872 --> 00:49:22,106

Hey!

00:51:15,255 --> 00:51:16,789
What the fuck?

1026
00:51:21,128 --> 00:51:22,794
Hey!

1027
00:51:22,796 --> 00:51:25,899
Hey, you owe me
a new phone, bitch.

1028
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:29,533
Yeah. You're right, I'm sorry.

1029
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:32,169
That, uh...
I shouldn't have done that.

1030
00:51:32,171 --> 00:51:34,372
Uh, it's just been
a really weird day for me.

1031
00:51:34,374 --> 00:51:36,541
Um...

1032
00:51:36,543 --> 00:51:39,276
Let me see what I have on me.
Can you hold that a second?

1033
00:51:39,278 --> 00:51:40,778
I'm so, so sorry.

1034
00:51:45,385 --> 00:51:47,521
You think that's funny?
You fucking filming me?!

00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:51,756
Dylan!

1036
00:51:51,758 --> 00:51:53,390
I'm fine. I'm fine!

1037
00:51:53,392 --> 00:51:54,725
I'm fine.

1038
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:52,749
The baby's a girl, Will.

1039
00:52:52,751 --> 00:52:54,885
What?

1040
00:52:54,887 --> 00:52:57,120
I know we weren't
gonna find out,

1041
00:52:57,122 --> 00:53:01,191
but then the nurse slipped up,
and now I feel shitty knowing.

1042
00:53:01,193 --> 00:53:05,162
In about three weeks,
you're gonna have a daughter.

1043
00:53:05,164 --> 00:53:07,231
Actually, Daddy's gonna
blow his brains out

1044
00:53:07,233 --> 00:53:09,566
before he even meets me, so...

1045
00:53:09,568 --> 00:53:11,202
Say something.

1046
00:53:11,204 --> 00:53:13,070
I know what you
want to name her.

1047
00:53:13,072 --> 00:53:14,771
I know you don't
like his music...

1048
00:53:14,773 --> 00:53:16,341
Might want to look
to your right, lady.

1049
00:53:16,343 --> 00:53:17,341
I love it.

1050
00:53:17,343 --> 00:53:19,376
- Big fan.
- Mom.

1051
00:53:19,378 --> 00:53:21,879
- I think it's pretty cute.
- I think it's gonna be...

1052
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:24,017
Mom, Mom, look out!

1053
00:53:43,669 --> 00:53:46,606
Are you okay?

1054
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:51,277
Does it matter?

1055
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:54,845
If Rodrigo Gonzalez

1056
00:53:54,847 --> 00:53:56,981
had really been
there that night,

1057
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,816
he might have told
the stoned young woman

1058
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,151
sitting in front of him that
it mattered quite a bit to him

1059
00:54:01,153 --> 00:54:04,291
that Dylan Dempsey was okay.

1060
00:55:03,082 --> 00:55:05,082
Bueno. Bueno. Hombre.

1061
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,218
- No, sir.
- No, right.

1062
00:57:10,043 --> 00:57:11,311
No, señor.

1063
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:11,084
Ay, ay ay.

1064
01:06:26,932 --> 01:06:28,899
At exactly this moment,

1065
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,934
a mere 4,000 miles away,

1066
01:06:30,936 --> 01:06:33,070
Abby Dempsey,
then Abby Lesher,

1067
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:36,539
had just finished the first
draft of her college thesis.

1068
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,209
"But life
itself proves to be

1069
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:40,410
"the most unreliable
of narrators,

1070
01:06:40,412 --> 01:06:41,778
"forever taking us
on a journey

1071
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:42,812
"where it is impossible
to predict

1072
01:06:42,814 --> 01:06:45,249
what might happen next.
Life its..."

1073
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,117
Okay. This next part gets a
little flowery...

1074
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,151
Read, woman.

1075
01:06:48,153 --> 01:06:49,787
I know, but I feel
like it's getting away

1076
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:51,254
- from literary crit...
- Read!

1077
01:06:51,256 --> 01:06:52,856
Life itself tricks us.

1078
01:06:52,858 --> 01:06:54,524
It misleads us.

1079
01:06:54,526 --> 01:06:58,260
It paints one man a hero
when he may well be a villain.

1080
01:06:58,262 --> 01:07:00,097
Hero or villain?

1081
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,533
Villain or hero?

1082
01:07:03,535 --> 01:07:04,434
Or maybe neither.

1083
01:07:04,436 --> 01:07:05,635
Maybe life is playing the role

1084
01:07:05,637 --> 01:07:08,271
of unreliable trickster
yet again.

1085
01:07:08,273 --> 01:07:09,372
Maybe those it paints

1086
01:07:09,374 --> 01:07:11,474
as the heroes and
villains of our stories

1087
01:07:11,476 --> 01:07:14,644
are actually just day players
in a much bigger movie.

1088
01:07:14,646 --> 01:07:16,178
Maybe they're simply extras,

1089
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,983
filling the frames
so the real heroes

1090
01:07:18,985 --> 01:07:21,421
can have bodies
crossing in the background.

1091
01:07:23,356 --> 01:07:26,021
And then it sort of says
that over and over again...

1092
01:07:26,023 --> 01:07:28,559
You...

1093
01:07:28,561 --> 01:07:30,794
...are so much smarter than me.

1094
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:34,463
I really am, aren't I?

1095
01:07:36,869 --> 01:07:39,704
Abby's thesis
was a total disaster.

1096
01:07:39,706 --> 01:07:42,439
Her favorite and
most trusted professor argued,

1097
01:07:42,441 --> 01:07:44,307
as she feared he might,

1098
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:46,276
that she had strayed
from literary criticism

1099
01:07:46,278 --> 01:07:48,345
and had veered into
an unwieldy cross

1100
01:07:48,347 --> 01:07:52,916
of creative writing and
17th-century French philosophy.

1101
01:07:52,918 --> 01:07:55,452
Then Abby's favorite
and most trusted professor

1102
01:07:55,454 --> 01:07:57,254
tried to fuck her.

1103
01:07:57,256 --> 01:08:00,691
Which, one might argue,
proved Abby's thesis after all.

1104
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:11,233
A continent away,

1105
01:08:11,235 --> 01:08:14,439
Javier González was
worried about none of this.

1106
01:08:16,775 --> 01:08:19,342
Javier González
didn't philosophize

1107
01:08:19,344 --> 01:08:23,312
and he never wondered
what life had in store for him.

1108
01:08:23,314 --> 01:08:26,350
Javier González knew
where he was going.

1109
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,519
He'd known all along.

1110
01:08:36,728 --> 01:08:38,294
Oh.

1111
01:08:44,436 --> 01:08:46,903
Isabel Diaz
had been taught from birth

1112
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:49,004
to expect a very average life.

1113
01:08:49,006 --> 01:08:51,041
She was one of six sisters

1114
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:53,409
and was openly considered
to be the fourth prettiest.

1115
01:09:05,624 --> 01:09:07,160
Bravo.

1116
01:09:17,768 --> 01:09:19,070
Ooh.

1117
01:10:12,924 --> 01:10:14,193
No, no.

1118
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,773
Una...

1119
01:10:29,775 --> 01:10:31,173
Dos...

1120
01:10:31,175 --> 01:10:33,877
- Y...
- Y tres!

1121
01:12:01,332 --> 01:12:02,601
America.

1122
01:12:08,005 --> 01:12:09,806
Isabel could
no longer remember

1123
01:12:09,808 --> 01:12:12,876
when Mr. Saccione first started
coming over to visit Rodrigo.

1124
01:12:14,513 --> 01:12:17,881
She only knew that the visits
had become more consistent,

1125
01:12:17,883 --> 01:12:19,548
usually in the
middle of the day,

1126
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:21,987
always when Javier
was in the fields.

1127
01:12:37,268 --> 01:12:38,536
- Si, si.
- No, no, no.

1128
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:09,795
No!

1129
01:14:32,451 --> 01:14:34,550
Javier González
was a simple man,

1130
01:14:34,552 --> 01:14:36,485
but not a stupid one.

1131
01:14:36,487 --> 01:14:38,989
And that day,
he began doing something

1132
01:14:38,991 --> 01:14:43,459
he'd never done before:
planning a family vacation.

1133
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:45,560
To a place that
he had just learned

1134
01:14:45,562 --> 01:14:49,501
his son desperately wanted
to visit with someone else.

1135
01:15:31,543 --> 01:15:33,944
- Hello.
- Hola.

1136
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,145
- Hola.
- Hola.

1137
01:15:35,147 --> 01:15:36,913
Hola. Hola.

1138
01:15:36,915 --> 01:15:38,551
Hey, little guy. Look.

1139
01:15:40,418 --> 01:15:42,918
Where'd it go? Look.

1140
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,419
- Whoa.
- There it is.

1141
01:15:44,421 --> 01:15:45,758
Where are you from?

1142
01:16:08,414 --> 01:16:10,849
A pregnant woman
eviscerated by a bus.

1143
01:16:13,284 --> 01:16:15,985
A grown man
weeping desperately.

1144
01:16:15,987 --> 01:16:17,889
Bystanders screaming.

1145
01:16:19,823 --> 01:16:22,358
It was only about
20 seconds of footage,

1146
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,427
but it would replay on a loop

1147
01:16:24,429 --> 01:16:27,900
in little Rodrigo González's
brain for years to come.

1148
01:16:32,137 --> 01:16:33,906
Mamá!

1149
01:17:26,124 --> 01:17:27,293
Rigo!

1150
01:17:40,304 --> 01:17:41,404
Mamá!

1151
01:17:53,918 --> 01:17:55,487
- No!
- Rigo.

1152
01:19:51,402 --> 01:19:52,036
Hm-mm.

1153
01:20:32,509 --> 01:20:34,976
Months passed.

1154
01:20:34,978 --> 01:20:37,846
Mr. Saccione's visits
were no longer restricted.

1155
01:20:37,848 --> 01:20:39,715
His gifts no longer withheld.

1156
01:20:39,717 --> 01:20:42,319
Wow.

1157
01:20:42,321 --> 01:20:43,752
Ooh. Hola, Oli.

1158
01:20:43,754 --> 01:20:47,355
And now,
in English.

1159
01:20:47,357 --> 01:20:49,025
My name is...

1160
01:20:49,027 --> 01:20:51,127
Rodrigo...

1161
01:20:51,129 --> 01:20:51,796
González.

1162
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:56,932
But I like to be called Rod.

1163
01:20:56,934 --> 01:20:59,635
- Or Rigo.
- Yeah.

1164
01:20:59,637 --> 01:21:00,903
Oh.

1165
01:21:00,905 --> 01:21:02,739
I am from Spain.

1166
01:21:02,741 --> 01:21:04,273
Keep going.

1167
01:21:04,275 --> 01:21:06,641
I was sad

1168
01:21:06,643 --> 01:21:09,378
for a long time.

1169
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:12,448
But my uncle got me a bird,

1170
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:15,187
which helps.

1171
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:12,991
Hola.

1172
01:27:07,237 --> 01:27:09,038
If we've
learned anything by now,

1173
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,474
it's not to get attached
to new heroes.

1174
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:13,208
They tend to disappoint.

1175
01:27:14,778 --> 01:27:17,079
But damn if little
Rodrigo González

1176
01:27:17,081 --> 01:27:20,016
didn't look like
the real deal.

1177
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:33,457
Rodrigo...

1178
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:18,236
Ay, ay, ay!

1179
01:29:44,394 --> 01:29:45,729
Rigo.

1180
01:31:12,415 --> 01:31:15,050
Rodrigo entered
college a visiting freshman,

1181
01:31:15,052 --> 01:31:18,087
and as he'd been doing for
most of the previous decade,

1182
01:31:18,089 --> 01:31:19,890
he thrived.

1183
01:31:21,424 --> 01:31:24,627
He lettered in two sports.

1184
01:31:24,629 --> 01:31:25,961
...proportional to the ratio...

1185
01:31:25,963 --> 01:31:29,166
His marks were
at the very top of his class.

1186
01:31:31,035 --> 01:31:33,235
He even embarked
on a relationship

1187
01:31:33,237 --> 01:31:35,738
with a 20-something
from Long Island

1188
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:37,308
named Shari Dickstein.

1189
01:31:43,613 --> 01:31:47,416
She made him laugh...
usually not intentionally.

1190
01:31:47,418 --> 01:31:50,019
Oh, my God. You've never
been to Whole Foods?

1191
01:31:50,021 --> 01:31:51,653
- No. But what is that?
- Okay, I'll take you there.

1192
01:31:51,655 --> 01:31:53,788
It's like a dream.
It's like a...

1193
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:56,425
She wasn't his great
love, but she was company.

1194
01:31:56,427 --> 01:31:58,961
And great love wasn't
his priority at the moment.

1195
01:31:58,963 --> 01:32:01,462
...clean eating, vegan dream.

1196
01:32:01,464 --> 01:32:03,097
What's-what's vegan?

1197
01:32:03,099 --> 01:32:04,467
Oh, my God, you're adorable.

1198
01:32:04,469 --> 01:32:06,437
I love that
you don't know things.

1199
01:32:07,972 --> 01:32:09,805
He saved every dollar,

1200
01:32:09,807 --> 01:32:11,507
coveted every vacation.

1201
01:32:11,509 --> 01:32:14,510
Rodrigo González
had an internal compass,

1202
01:32:14,512 --> 01:32:16,347
and it always pointed
in the same direction.

1203
01:32:19,717 --> 01:32:22,353
- En Nueva York?
- Si.

1204
01:32:29,927 --> 01:32:30,891
- Shari?
- Shari.

1205
01:32:30,893 --> 01:32:31,927
Shari Distin.

1206
01:32:31,929 --> 01:32:32,931
Shari Dickstein.

1207
01:32:42,839 --> 01:32:44,472
- No.
- Si. Si, si, si.

1208
01:32:44,474 --> 01:32:46,609
Like so many of
the biggest years of our lives,

1209
01:32:46,611 --> 01:32:47,876
it flew by.

1210
01:32:47,878 --> 01:32:50,878
But in truth,
that year was just a setup,

1211
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:55,851
a preamble to the biggest day
of Rodrigo González's life.

1212
01:33:11,067 --> 01:33:14,136
Where are you going?

1213
01:33:14,138 --> 01:33:17,373
I'm just going for a quick run.

1214
01:33:17,375 --> 01:33:19,940
- Miarma.
- Huh?

1215
01:33:19,942 --> 01:33:24,279
When we first started dating,
you used to call me "Miarma."

1216
01:33:24,281 --> 01:33:26,181
You would've said,

1217
01:33:26,183 --> 01:33:29,051
"Just going for
a quick run, Miarma."

1218
01:33:29,053 --> 01:33:32,756
It always made me feel like
Kelly Ripa.

1219
01:33:35,293 --> 01:33:36,858
Shari...

1220
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:38,696
I'm pregnant.

1221
01:33:39,664 --> 01:33:43,298
I know. Obvi,
lots to talk about.

1222
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,833
Hey, will you
take me for brunch?

1223
01:33:45,835 --> 01:33:48,270
There's this place
I really want to try.

1224
01:33:48,272 --> 01:33:49,770
It's Vietnamese,
which I'm assuming

1225
01:33:49,772 --> 01:33:52,041
is kind of like
dim sum or something.

1226
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,877
We can talk at brunch,
at the Vietnamese place.

1227
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:56,546
I really want to try it.

1228
01:33:58,950 --> 01:34:01,382
So, I just started feeling
shitty a few weeks ago.

1229
01:34:01,384 --> 01:34:03,452
I thought I was just getting
a really bad period.

1230
01:34:03,454 --> 01:34:04,919
Ever since I got off the pill,

1231
01:34:04,921 --> 01:34:07,523
I have been having
bananas periods, you know?

1232
01:34:07,525 --> 01:34:10,258
But it wasn't stopping,
so I went to my gyno,

1233
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:12,560
and he was like,
"Are you sexually active?"

1234
01:34:12,562 --> 01:34:13,962
So I told him about you,

1235
01:34:13,964 --> 01:34:16,664
and then he did the
test thing and blammo!

1236
01:34:16,666 --> 01:34:18,867
I hadn't even thought
to try an at-home test.

1237
01:34:18,869 --> 01:34:20,302
For whatever reason,

1238
01:34:20,304 --> 01:34:22,570
my brain did not go there
whatso-fucking-ever.

1239
01:34:22,572 --> 01:34:25,039
Anyways, I know that we haven't
been together very long,

1240
01:34:25,041 --> 01:34:27,842
and clearly this is as
"what the fuck" as things get.

1241
01:34:27,844 --> 01:34:30,278
I mean, I don't know what your
deal is with religious stuff,

1242
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:35,950
but I'm thinking that I should
probably just get an abortion.

1243
01:34:35,952 --> 01:34:38,787
Are you, like, are you, like,
super against that? Abortion?

1244
01:34:38,789 --> 01:34:41,088
I know abortion's a really
big deal for Christians.

1245
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:44,426
There should, like, be,
like, a pill or something

1246
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:46,528
for something like this,
like, unplanned pregnancy.

1247
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:47,928
'Cause if you're
Christian, I'm...

1248
01:34:49,799 --> 01:34:51,632
Anyhow, we don't have to
decide any of this right now,

1249
01:34:51,634 --> 01:34:53,235
but I would like
to make the call early,

1250
01:34:53,237 --> 01:34:54,535
just before
the thing has, like,

1251
01:34:54,537 --> 01:34:55,971
a head and stuff, you know?

1252
01:34:55,973 --> 01:34:57,642
Oh, hey, there we are!

1253
01:35:05,215 --> 01:35:09,583
So, the way I see it,
we have, like, three options.

1254
01:35:09,585 --> 01:35:11,453
Option one: we have it.

1255
01:35:11,455 --> 01:35:12,954
I mean, a mixed-race baby

1256
01:35:12,956 --> 01:35:15,090
with our skin complexions
would be amazeballs.

1257
01:35:15,092 --> 01:35:17,426
My family have batshit money,

1258
01:35:17,428 --> 01:35:20,694
so we could get
nannies and stuff.

1259
01:35:20,696 --> 01:35:22,898
I don't know,
it's probably a bad idea.

1260
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:25,633
Option two: abort.
But again, I would like to make

1261
01:35:25,635 --> 01:35:27,569
that call sooner
rather than later.

1262
01:35:27,571 --> 01:35:31,340
Or option three:
we can just both agree

1263
01:35:31,342 --> 01:35:34,775
that this is all
an insane April Fools' joke!

1264
01:35:34,777 --> 01:35:35,780
Ah!

1265
01:35:37,147 --> 01:35:39,079
What?

1266
01:35:39,081 --> 01:35:41,382
April Fools', bitch!

1267
01:35:41,384 --> 01:35:43,450
Wh-What is that?

1268
01:35:43,452 --> 01:35:45,220
Seriously?
You don't know April Fools'?

1269
01:35:45,222 --> 01:35:47,521
No, I don't.

1270
01:35:47,523 --> 01:35:50,958
Well, I didn't know that.

1271
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,260
So there is no baby?

1272
01:35:52,262 --> 01:35:54,229
Dude! Ew, no.

1273
01:35:54,231 --> 01:35:56,931
Of course not.

1274
01:35:56,933 --> 01:35:58,667
Oh, come on.

1275
01:35:58,669 --> 01:36:01,503
You have to admit, that was,
that was pretty funny.

1276
01:36:03,874 --> 01:36:05,576
Shari...

1277
01:36:08,378 --> 01:36:10,014
Oh, fuck.

1278
01:36:12,549 --> 01:36:14,283
You're gonna break up
with me, aren't you?

1279
01:36:14,285 --> 01:36:16,351
He was.

1280
01:36:16,353 --> 01:36:17,852
Yes, I am.
I'm-I'm sorry...

1281
01:36:17,854 --> 01:36:19,553
Obviously,
nothing thus far

1282
01:36:19,555 --> 01:36:20,922
had indicated
that this would be

1283
01:36:20,924 --> 01:36:23,458
the most important day
of Rodrigo's life.

1284
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:25,159
No.

1285
01:36:25,161 --> 01:36:28,462
Sometimes the most important
days of our lives begin,

1286
01:36:28,464 --> 01:36:30,398
and we're not even
there to see it.

1287
01:37:07,304 --> 01:37:07,839
Isabel.

1288
01:37:40,137 --> 01:37:41,104
No.

1289
01:38:01,592 --> 01:38:03,561
Hola, Bella.

1290
01:38:12,236 --> 01:38:14,802
Mr. Saccione
was a letter writer.

1291
01:38:14,804 --> 01:38:16,904
He always had been.

1292
01:38:16,906 --> 01:38:19,608
He believed in the power
of the written word,

1293
01:38:19,610 --> 01:38:21,409
the force of
actually sitting down

1294
01:38:21,411 --> 01:38:23,080
and writing
to someone by hand.

1295
01:38:49,106 --> 01:38:51,405
And with that,
Mr. Saccione's letters

1296
01:38:51,407 --> 01:38:54,775
found a new recipient.

1297
01:38:54,777 --> 01:38:57,346
A man whose only request
was that he be kept up to date

1298
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:58,783
on those he had abandoned
but still cherished.

1299
01:39:38,488 --> 01:39:40,124
Hola, Bella.

1300
01:40:02,278 --> 01:40:04,014
Hola.

1301
01:40:05,014 --> 01:40:07,115
Hola.

1302
01:41:52,789 --> 01:41:56,091
When critics reviewed
Abby Dempsey's favorite album,

1303
01:41:56,093 --> 01:41:59,895
Bob Dylan's 1997 release,
"Time Out of Mind,"

1304
01:41:59,897 --> 01:42:01,762
the song
"Make You Feel My Love"

1305
01:42:01,764 --> 01:42:03,664
was a source
of much criticism.

1306
01:42:08,671 --> 01:42:10,504
Every track on the album

1307
01:42:10,506 --> 01:42:14,010
brimmed with unrelenting
melancholy and sadness.

1308
01:42:15,946 --> 01:42:19,114
But there,
smack in the middle of it all,

1309
01:42:19,116 --> 01:42:22,382
sat an unabashedly
populist hit song,

1310
01:42:22,384 --> 01:42:24,151
a love song...

1311
01:42:24,153 --> 01:42:26,521
a song that in years
to come would be covered

1312
01:42:26,523 --> 01:42:29,992
by Garth Brooks, of all people.

1313
01:42:29,994 --> 01:42:32,526
Critics argued that putting
an on-the-nose love song

1314
01:42:32,528 --> 01:42:35,529
in the middle of an album
about despair and tragedy

1315
01:42:35,531 --> 01:42:38,365
was Dylan's only misstep.

1316
01:42:38,367 --> 01:42:41,569
Others argued
that it was his point.

1317
01:42:41,571 --> 01:42:43,437
Are you okay?

1318
01:42:54,518 --> 01:42:57,454
Hola.

1319
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:06,927
My father,
Rodrigo González,

1320
01:43:06,929 --> 01:43:10,765
officially met my mother,
Dylan Dempsey, that day...

1321
01:43:10,767 --> 01:43:13,133
the most important
day of his life.

1322
01:43:13,135 --> 01:43:14,970
Hi.

1323
01:43:14,972 --> 01:43:18,440
They would not
spend a single night apart

1324
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:21,409
for the next 42 years.

1325
01:43:21,411 --> 01:43:24,078
They would go on
to have four children,

1326
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:28,082
seven grandchildren.

1327
01:43:28,084 --> 01:43:31,752
A love story for the ages.

1328
01:43:31,754 --> 01:43:34,021
My grandmother, Abby Dempsey,

1329
01:43:34,023 --> 01:43:36,623
argued in her
failed college thesis

1330
01:43:36,625 --> 01:43:42,530
that life itself is our
most unreliable narrator.

1331
01:43:42,532 --> 01:43:47,034
She argued that no one knows
where their story is going,

1332
01:43:47,036 --> 01:43:50,307
nor who the heroes
in it are going to be.

1333
01:43:52,509 --> 01:43:56,310
And while it's true that life
has often made it difficult

1334
01:43:56,312 --> 01:43:58,812
to pinpoint the heroes
of my family's story,

1335
01:43:58,814 --> 01:44:04,088
my parents have always made
it incredibly easy for me.

1336
01:44:05,821 --> 01:44:08,190
They found the one
populist love song

1337
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:12,026
in our family's often
very melancholy album.

1338
01:44:12,028 --> 01:44:14,127
Unlike my grandmother Abby,

1339
01:44:14,129 --> 01:44:17,399
my grandmother Isabel
was neither a writer

1340
01:44:17,401 --> 01:44:19,301
nor a philosopher.

1341
01:44:19,303 --> 01:44:21,935
But sometimes I wonder
if she didn't understand

1342
01:44:21,937 --> 01:44:23,837
exactly what Bob Dylan
was going for.

1343
01:44:26,876 --> 01:44:29,976
Spanish does not often
translate perfectly,

1344
01:44:29,978 --> 01:44:31,745
but what Isabel said
to my father

1345
01:44:31,747 --> 01:44:35,882
the day she sent him away,
it required no translation.

1346
01:44:35,884 --> 01:44:37,921
Mamá...

1347
01:44:40,889 --> 01:44:43,192
Enough.

1348
01:44:45,594 --> 01:44:47,428
Listen to me.

1349
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:53,434
Rigo, you have had many
ups and downs in your life.

1350
01:44:53,436 --> 01:44:56,072
Too many.

1351
01:44:57,941 --> 01:45:00,941
And you will have more.

1352
01:45:00,943 --> 01:45:03,310
This is life.

1353
01:45:03,312 --> 01:45:06,980
And this is what it does.

1354
01:45:06,982 --> 01:45:10,217
Life brings you to your knees.

1355
01:45:13,156 --> 01:45:18,062
It brings you lower
than you think you can go.

1356
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:24,798
But if you stand back up...

1357
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:29,436
and move forward...

1358
01:45:29,438 --> 01:45:35,075
if you go just
a little farther...

1359
01:45:35,077 --> 01:45:38,615
you will always find love.

1360
01:45:44,853 --> 01:45:48,391
I found love in you.

1361
01:45:50,626 --> 01:45:54,462
And my life, my story,

1362
01:45:54,464 --> 01:45:58,632
it will continue
after I'm gone.

1363
01:45:58,634 --> 01:46:01,637
Because you are my story.

1364
01:46:05,375 --> 01:46:09,209
You are your father's story.

1365
01:46:09,211 --> 01:46:12,814
Your uncle's.

1366
01:46:16,152 --> 01:46:22,090
Rigo, my body fails me.

1367
01:46:22,092 --> 01:46:25,062
But you are me.

1368
01:46:29,965 --> 01:46:31,833
So you go now.

1369
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:39,907
Give me a beautiful life.

1370
01:46:39,909 --> 01:46:43,043
The most beautiful life ever.

1371
01:46:43,045 --> 01:46:45,249
Yeah?

1372
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:51,321
And if life brings
us to our knees...

1373
01:46:54,758 --> 01:46:57,760
you stand us back up.

1374
01:47:01,464 --> 01:47:04,865
You get up.

1375
01:47:04,867 --> 01:47:07,571
And go farther.

1376
01:47:11,775 --> 01:47:15,176
And find us the love.

1377
01:47:15,178 --> 01:47:17,648
Will you do that?

1378
01:47:34,531 --> 01:47:38,099
I'm not sure whose
story I have been telling.

1379
01:47:38,101 --> 01:47:40,868
I'm not sure if it is mine,

1380
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:43,439
or if it's some character's
I have yet to meet.

1381
01:47:45,741 --> 01:47:47,943
I'm not sure of anything.

1382
01:47:47,945 --> 01:47:52,079
All I know is that,
at any moment,

1383
01:47:52,081 --> 01:47:55,283
life will surprise me.

1384
01:47:55,285 --> 01:47:59,887
It will bring me to my knees.

1385
01:47:59,889 --> 01:48:01,823
And when it does,

1386
01:48:01,825 --> 01:48:03,126
I will remind myself...

1387
01:48:04,826 --> 01:48:06,694
I will remind myself

1388
01:48:06,696 --> 01:48:09,800
that I am my father.

1389
01:48:12,434 --> 01:48:16,003
And I am my father's father.

1390
01:48:16,005 --> 01:48:18,840
I am my mother.

1391
01:48:18,842 --> 01:48:21,109
And I am my mother's mother.

1392
01:48:24,915 --> 01:48:26,379
And while it may be easy

1393
01:48:26,381 --> 01:48:30,051
to wallow in the tragedies
that shape our lives,

1394
01:48:30,053 --> 01:48:32,886
and while it's natural
to focus on those

1395
01:48:32,888 --> 01:48:38,258
unspeakable moments
that bring us to our knees,

1396
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:39,860
we must remind ourselves

1397
01:48:39,862 --> 01:48:42,329
that if we get up,

1398
01:48:42,331 --> 01:48:45,568
if we take the story
a little bit farther...

1399
01:48:56,411 --> 01:49:00,047
If we go far enough,

1400
01:49:00,049 --> 01:49:01,752
there's love.

1401
01:49:05,955 --> 01:49:07,221
Hey.

1402
01:49:09,625 --> 01:49:11,693
Hey.

1403
01:49:11,695 --> 01:49:14,495
Goddamn.
