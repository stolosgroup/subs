00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:33,912
Oh, come on, now. Where's the money
if the place was sold?

305
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,164
Not sold. Lost!

306
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:37,624
- Lost.
- Come here.

307
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:41,336
- Stanley. Ow!
- Will you open your eyes to this stuff?

308
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:44,339
- What, she got this out of teacher's pay?
- Oh, hush.

309
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:48,343
Look at these fine feathers and furs
that she comes to preen herself in here?

310
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:51,471
What is this article?
That's a solid-gold dress, I believe.

311
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:55,016
- Oh, honest.
- This one here. What is that, a fox piece?

312
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:57,769
- Stanley!
- A genuine fur fox a half a mile long.

313
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,146
Where are your fox pieces?

314
00:19:00,314 --> 00:19:03,733
This is bushy snow-white ones, no less.
Where are your white fox furs?

315
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:07,695
Those are inexpensive summer furs
that Blanche has had a long time.

316
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:10,782
I have an acquaintance who deals
in this sort of merchandise.

317
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,369
- He's coming to make an appraisal.
- Don't be such an idiot, Stanley.

318
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:18,623
Listen, I'm gonna bet you there's
a thousand dollars invested in this stuff.

319
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,709
Well, now, what is that?
That's the treasure chest of a pirate?

320
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:25,130
- Oh, Stanley. Would you...?
- That's pearls, Stella. Ropes of them.

321
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:28,007
What is this sister of yours,
a deep-sea diver?

322
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:31,219
Bracelets, solid gold. Where are
your pearls and gold bracelets?

323
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:32,762
Be still, Stanley.

324
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,014
And here. Diamonds.
A crown for an empress.

325
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:38,768
A rhinestone tiara
she wore to a costume ball.

326
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:41,563
- What is rhinestone?
- Next door to glass.

327
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,022
STANLEY:
Yeah.

328
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,276
I have an acquaintance who works in
a jewelry store and he's coming...

329
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:48,194
...to make an appraisal of that stuff.

330
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:53,533
- Here's your plantation fella, right here.
- You know I... Stupid and horrid.

331
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:56,870
You stay away from these things
before she comes out of the bathroom.

332
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:59,873
The Kowalskis and the DuBois
got a different notion on this.

333
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,751
Indeed they have, thank heavens.
I'm going outside.

334
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,171
Go ahead.

335
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:11,676
You come on out with me
while Blanche is getting dressed.

336
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,470
Now, since when
are you giving me orders?

337
00:20:14,638 --> 00:20:17,765
Are you gonna stay here
and insult her?

338
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:20,268
You bet your life I'm gonna stay here.

339
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,952
Hello, Stanley.

340
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:44,083
Here I am, all freshly bathed and scented
and feeling like a brand-new human being.

341
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:45,668
Oh, that's good.

342
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:51,090
Will you excuse me
while I put on my pretty new dress?

343
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:52,926
Go ahead.

344
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:54,469
[BLANCHE CLEARS THROAT]

345
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,645
Oh.

346
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,072
Thank you.

347
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,964
I understand there's to be
a little card party here tonight...

348
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:34,384
...to which we ladies
are cordially not invited.

349
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:35,843
STANLEY:
That's right.

350
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:38,721
Where...? Where is Stella?

351
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:42,016
STANLEY:
She's out there on the porch.

352
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,192
I'm going to ask a favor of you
in a moment.

353
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,029
Well, now, what's that gonna be,
I wonder.

354
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:57,448
Some buttons in back.

355
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:00,201
You may enter.

356
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:05,206
How do I look?

357
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:06,958
You look okay.

358
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,460
Well, thanks. Now the button.

359
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:16,926
Well, I can't do no more with them.

360
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:19,095
You men with your big, clumsy fingers.

361
00:22:19,263 --> 00:22:22,265
- May I have a drag on your cig?
- Yeah, have one for yourself.

362
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:24,309
Why, thank you. It...

363
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,103
It looks like my trunk has exploded.

364
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:29,772
Me and Stella was helping you unpack.

365
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:33,109
You certainly did a fast
and thorough job of it.

366
00:22:33,277 --> 00:22:36,654
Well, certainly looks like you raided
some stylish shops in Paris, Blanche.

367
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,573
Clothes are my passion.

368
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:41,075
How much does it cost
for a string of furs like that?

369
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:43,411
Why, these were a tribute
from an admirer of mine.

370
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:45,371
He must have had a lot of admiration.

371
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,374
In my youth I excited some admiration,
but look at me now.

372
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:52,420
Would you think it possible that I
was once considered to be attractive?

373
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:55,131
Your looks are okay.

374
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:58,301
- I was fishing for a compliment.
- I don't go for that stuff.

375
00:22:58,552 --> 00:23:00,678
- What stuff?
- Compliments to women about looks.

376
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:04,724
I never met a dame didn't know she was
good-looking or not without being told.

377
00:23:04,892 --> 00:23:08,019
And some of them give themselves
credit for more than they've got.

378
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:11,272
I once went out with a dame
who told me, "I'm the glamorous type."

379
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,609
She says, "I am the glamorous type."
I says, "So what?"

380
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:17,570
- And what did she say then?
- She didn't say nothing.

381
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:20,656
- That shut her up like a clam.
- Did it end the romance?

382
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:23,743
Well, it ended the conversation,
that was all.

383
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:26,954
There's some men that are took in
by this Hollywood glamour stuff...

384
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:30,625
...and there's some men that aren't.
- You belong in the second category.

385
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:33,294
- That's right.
- I can't imagine any witch of a woman...

386
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:35,463
...casting a spell over you.
- That's right.

387
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,965
You're simple,
straightforward and honest.

388
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:41,135
A little bit on the primitive side,
I should think.

389
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:44,639
- To interest you a woman would have to...
- To lay her cards on the table.

390
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:47,475
Well, I never did care
for wishy-washy people.

391
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,478
That was why when you walked
in last night, I said to myself:

392
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,855
"My sister has married a man."
Of course.

393
00:23:53,023 --> 00:23:55,733
- That was all I could tell...
- How about cutting the rebop!

394
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,110
STELLA:
Stanley!

395
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:01,322
Come on outside with me
and let Blanche finish dressing.

396
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,408
- I'm finished dressing.
- Then come on out.

397
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,660
- Your sister and I are having a talk.
- Honey...

398
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:08,788
...run to the drugstore and get me
a lemon Coke with chipped ice.

399
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:11,749
Will you do that for me,
sweetie, please? Please.

400
00:24:13,377 --> 00:24:15,002
All right.

401
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:22,093
Poor thing was out there listening to us.

402
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:25,847
And I have an idea she doesn't
understand you as well as I do.

403
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:30,977
All right now, Mr. Kowalski, let us
proceed without any more digression.

404
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:34,939
I'm ready to answer all questions.
I have nothing to hide.

405
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,691
What is it?

406
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,780
In the state of Louisiana we got here
what's known as the Napoleonic Code.

407
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:47,160
Which says, what belongs to the wife
belongs to the husband and vice versa.

408
00:24:47,327 --> 00:24:49,662
My, but you have
an impressive judicial air.

409
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,708
If I didn't know that you was my wife's
sister, I would get ideas about you.

410
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:59,714
- Such as what?
- Don't play so dumb. You know what.

411
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:03,718
All right. Cards on the table.

412
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:09,515
I know I fib a good deal. After all,
a woman's charm is 50 percent illusion.

413
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,269
But when a thing is important
I tell the truth.

414
00:25:13,437 --> 00:25:14,937
And this is the truth:

415
00:25:15,105 --> 00:25:20,401
I never cheated my sister, or you, or
anyone else on earth as long as I lived.

416
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:24,906
- Where are the papers, in your trunk?
- Everything I own is in that trunk.

417
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:31,537
What are you thinking of? What's in the
back of that little boy's mind of yours?

418
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:33,748
Let me do that.
It'll be faster and simple.

419
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:38,669
- I keep my papers mostly in this tin box.
- What are those underneath?

420
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:42,715
Those are love letters...

421
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:45,134
...yellowing with antiquity...

422
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:48,513
...all from one boy. Give those back.
- I'm just gonna have a look.

423
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,766
- The touch of your hands insults them.
- Now, don't pull that stuff.

424
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:55,686
Now that you've touched them,
I'll burn them.

425
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:58,105
What are they?

426
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:02,527
Poems the dead boy wrote.

427
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:06,614
I hurt him the way that you would
like to hurt me. But you can't.

428
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:11,869
I'm not young and vulnerable anymore,
but my young husband was, and I...

429
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,914
Never mind about that.

430
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,625
Just give them back to me.

431
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,797
Thank you.

432
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:26,300
What'd you mean by saying
you have to burn them up?

433
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:28,511
I'm sorry.

434
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:31,806
I must have lost my head for a moment.

435
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:36,227
Everyone has something they won't
let others touch because of their...

436
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:38,729
Their intimate nature.

437
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,321
Ambler and Ambler.

438
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:49,323
Crabtree.

439
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:52,660
- More Ambler and Ambler.
- What's Ambler and Ambler?

440
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,453
A firm that made loans on the place.

441
00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:57,415
- It was lost on a mortgage.
- That must have been what happened.

442
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,334
I don't want if, ands or buts.
What's the rest of the papers?

443
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:04,005
There are thousands of papers
stretching back over hundreds of years...

444
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:05,464
...affecting Belle Reve...

445
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:08,426
...as piece by piece,
our improvident grandfathers...

446
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,012
...exchanged the land
for their epic debauches...

447
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:12,638
...to put it mildly.

448
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:15,850
Until finally, all that was left...
And Stella can verify that.

449
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:17,351
- Was the house itself.

450
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,105
And about 20 acres of ground,
including a graveyard...

451
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:25,234
...to which now all but Stella
and I have retreated.

452
00:27:25,402 --> 00:27:28,738
Here they are, all of them.

01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:51,413
That's good.

1075

We're going to be very bohemian.

- No, no, I don't understand French.

1079
01:06:06,012 --> 01:06:10,432
Oh. Well, why don't you sit down.
Take off your coat. Loosen your collar.

1080
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,852
- No, I better leave it on.
- No. I want you to be comfortable.

1081
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:17,314
No, I'm ashamed of the way I perspire.
My shirt is sticking to me.

1082
01:06:17,482 --> 01:06:22,277
Perspiration is healthy. If people didn't
perspire, they would die in five minutes.

1083

Oh, this is a nice coat.
What...?

1084

- What material is it?
- They call this stuff alpaca.

- Oh, lightweight alpaca.
- Yes.

1087

I don't like to wear a watch coat even in
the summer because I sweat through it.

A man with a heavy build is careful of
what he wears so he don't look clumsy.

in the belly, but now my belly is hard.

It's so hard now a man can punch me
in the belly and it don't hurt me.

1104
01:07:31,431 --> 01:07:36,852
- I'd say in the vicinity of 180 pounds.
- No, guess again.

1105
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,478
- Not so much?
- No, more.

1106
01:07:38,646 --> 01:07:41,398
- Well?
- I weigh 207 pounds.

1107
01:07:41,566 --> 01:07:43,900
I'm 6'1 " and one-half inches tall
in my bare feet...

...without shoes on,
and that's what I weigh stripped.

Oh, my goodness, it's awe-inspiring.

1110
01:07:51,784 --> 01:07:54,619
Well, my weight's not a very
interesting subject to talk about.

- Why, you're light as a feather.
- You may release me now.

1116

- Huh?
- I said unhand me, sir.

1117
01:08:14,098 --> 01:08:17,851
Mitch, Mitch, we're in public.
You must behave like a gentleman.

1118
01:08:18,019 --> 01:08:20,270
Just give me a slap
whenever I step out of bounds.

1119
01:08:20,438 --> 01:08:25,233
It won't be necessary. You're a natural
gentleman. One of the few left.

1120
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:29,154
I don't want you to think that I'm
severe or old-maid schoolteacherish...

1121

...or anything. It's just, well, I...

1122
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:35,827
I guess I have old-fashioned ideals.

Where's Stanley and Stella tonight?

1124
01:08:52,053 --> 01:08:55,222
I think they were planning
to take in a midnight preview.

1125
01:08:55,389 --> 01:08:57,808
We all ought to go out together
some night.

1126
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:01,478
That wouldn't be a good plan.

Why not?

1128

You are an old friend of Stanley's?

1129

- Sure.

1131

Has he talked to you about me?

1132
01:09:15,701 --> 01:09:17,410
- No, not much.
- The way you say that...

1133
01:09:17,578 --> 01:09:19,746
...I suspect that he has.
- He hasn't said much.

1134
01:09:19,914 --> 01:09:23,834
Well, what he has said, what would
you say his attitude toward me was?

1135
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:25,710
- What makes you ask that?
- Well...

1136
01:09:25,878 --> 01:09:27,921
Don't you get along with him?

1137
01:09:28,381 --> 01:09:29,965
What do you think?

1138
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:32,175
I think he don't understand you.

1139
01:09:32,718 --> 01:09:37,556
That's putting it mildly. Surely he must
have told you how much he hates me.

1140
01:09:42,061 --> 01:09:43,770
I don't think he hates you.

1141
01:09:43,938 --> 01:09:47,232
He hates me,
or why would he insult me?

1142
01:09:47,525 --> 01:09:48,775
Of course...

1143

Oh, no.

To think of it makes me...

1147

- Blanche.
- Yes, honey?

1148

- Blanche, can I ask you a question?
- Yes, what?

What do you want to know that for?

1151
01:10:15,386 --> 01:10:19,681
I talked to my mother about you
and she said, "How old is Blanche?"

1152
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,186
- You talked to your mother about me?
- Yes.

1153

Why?

1154
01:10:26,272 --> 01:10:29,608
Because I told her how nice
you were, and I liked you.

Were you sincere about that?

You know I was.

Why did your mother
want to know my age?

1158
01:10:41,662 --> 01:10:46,041
- My mother is sick, and...
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear it. Badly?

She won't live long...

...maybe just a few months,
and she worries because I'm not settled.

1161

She wants to see me
settled down before she...

1162

You love her very much, don't you?

1163
01:11:04,143 --> 01:11:07,562
You'll be lonely when she passes on,
won't you?

1164
01:11:11,651 --> 01:11:14,027
I know what that means.

1165

To be Ionely?

1166
01:11:19,533 --> 01:11:21,826
I loved someone once.

1167
01:11:21,994 --> 01:11:24,871
And the person I loved, I lost.

...much too completely.

1175
01:11:47,853 --> 01:11:51,314
It was like you suddenly turned
a blinding light...

1176
01:11:51,482 --> 01:11:55,277
...on something that had
always been half in shadow.

1177
01:11:55,653 --> 01:11:58,738
That's how it struck the world for me.

There was something about the boy.

1181

A nervousness, a tenderness...

1182
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:11,293
...an uncertainty.

1183
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,628
And I didn't understand.

1184
01:12:14,088 --> 01:12:18,258
I didn't understand why this boy,
who wrote poetry...

...didn't seem able to do anything else.

...we drove out to a place
called Moon Lake Casino.

We danced the Varsouviana.

Suddenly, in the middle of the dance,
the boy I married broke away from me...

BLANCHE [SINGING]:
Without your love

It's a honky-tonk parade

1267
01:17:28,485 --> 01:17:31,362
So she moved to a hotel
called the Flamingo...

1268
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:33,865
...which is a second-class hotel...

1269
01:17:34,033 --> 01:17:35,867
...and has the advantages...

1270
01:17:36,035 --> 01:17:40,038
...of not interfering with the private
and social life of the personalities there.

Now, the Flamingo is used to
all kinds of goings on.

1272
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:47,879
But the management of the Flamingo
was impressed by Dame Blanche.

1273
01:17:48,047 --> 01:17:50,590
In fact, they were so impressed
that they requested her...

...to turn in her room key
for permanently.

1275

Baby, listen. I checked on every story.

1280
01:18:15,866 --> 01:18:19,535
The trouble was she couldn't
put on her act anymore in Auriol...

1281
01:18:19,703 --> 01:18:21,037
...because they wised up.

And after two, three days they quit,
then she goes on to another one.

The same old line, the same old act
and the same old hooey.

1284
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:29,587
And as time went by,
she became the town character...

1285

but downright loco and nuts...

Baby, now...

1289
01:18:41,517 --> 01:18:45,144
She didn't resign temporarily because
of her nerves. She was kicked out...

...before the spring term ended.

1291
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,153
And, now, I hate to tell you the reason
that step was taken.

01:18:54,321 --> 01:18:56,781
A 17-year-old kid
she got mixed up with.

1293
01:18:56,949 --> 01:18:58,616
The boy's dad learned about it...

1294
01:18:58,784 --> 01:19:01,411
...and he got in touch
with the high school superintendent.

1295
01:19:01,578 --> 01:19:04,288
And it was practically a town ordinance
passed against her.

1681
01:43:00,432 --> 01:43:02,267
What, you got a wire?

1682
01:43:02,852 --> 01:43:06,062
I received a telegram
from an old admirer of mine.

1683
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:10,775
- Anything good?
- I think so. An invitation.

1684
01:43:11,443 --> 01:43:13,069
What to?

1685
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:18,199
A cruise of the Caribbean on a yacht.

1686
01:43:19,076 --> 01:43:20,952
Well, what do you know?

1687
01:43:21,453 --> 01:43:25,123
I was never so surprised in my life.
It came like a bolt from the blue.

1688
01:43:25,875 --> 01:43:27,917
Who'd you say it was from?

1689
01:43:29,753 --> 01:43:31,421
An old beau of mine.

1690
01:43:32,965 --> 01:43:35,425
Oh, the one that give you
the white fox fur pieces.

1691
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:37,468
Shep Huntleigh.

1692
01:43:37,636 --> 01:43:39,971
I wore his ATO pin
my last year in college.

1693
01:43:40,139 --> 01:43:42,724
I hadn't seen him for a while,
then just now this wire...

1694
01:43:42,892 --> 01:43:45,935
...inviting me on a cruise of the
Caribbean. The problem is clothes.

1695
01:43:46,103 --> 01:43:49,397
I tore into my trunk to see what I had
that was suitable for the tropics.

1696
01:43:49,565 --> 01:43:52,192
And you come up
with a gorgeous diamond tiara.

1697
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:54,611
This old relic? It's only rhinestones.

1698
01:43:55,446 --> 01:43:57,614
Oh, I thought it was
Tiffany's diamonds.

1699
01:43:57,781 --> 01:44:00,867
Well, anyhow,
I shall be entertained in style.

1700
01:44:01,035 --> 01:44:04,245
Well, it just goes to show you,
Blanche, you never know what's coming.

1701
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:06,748
When I thought my luck
was beginning to fail me.

1702
01:44:06,916 --> 01:44:09,834
Into the picture
pops this Miami millionaire.

1703
01:44:10,169 --> 01:44:12,587
This man is not from Miami.
This man is from Dallas.

1704
01:44:12,755 --> 01:44:15,340
Just so he's from somewhere.

1705
01:44:15,674 --> 01:44:18,509
Close the curtains
before you undress any further.

1706
01:44:18,677 --> 01:44:21,346
No, this is all
I'm gonna undress right now.

1707
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:25,350
Hey, Blanche,
you seen the bottle opener?

1708
01:44:26,977 --> 01:44:31,064
I used to have a cousin who could open
a bottle of beer with his teeth.

1709
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:35,652
And that was all he could do.
He was just a human bottle-opener.

1710
01:44:36,654 --> 01:44:40,949
Then one time at a wedding party,
he broke his front teeth right off.

1711
01:44:41,575 --> 01:44:44,494
And then after that,
he was so ashamed of himself...

1712
01:44:44,662 --> 01:44:48,081
...that he used to sneak out of the house
when company came.

1713
01:44:48,832 --> 01:44:50,959
Rain from heaven.

1714
01:44:59,134 --> 01:45:02,679
What do you say, Blanche? You want to
bury the hatchet and make a loving cup?

1715
01:45:03,389 --> 01:45:04,847
No. No, thank you.

1716
01:45:06,058 --> 01:45:08,643
- Why don't you get with it?
- What are you doing in here?

1717
01:45:08,811 --> 01:45:11,562
Hey, wait a second.
I want to show you something.

1718
01:45:11,981 --> 01:45:14,565
Here's something I always break out
on special occasions:

1719
01:45:14,733 --> 01:45:16,567
Silk pajamas I wore
on my wedding night.

1720
01:45:16,735 --> 01:45:19,195
When they call on that phone
and say, "You got a son"...

1721
01:45:19,363 --> 01:45:22,282
...I'm gonna rip them off
and wave them like a flag!

1722
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:24,534
I guess we're both entitled
to put on a dog.

1723
01:45:24,702 --> 01:45:27,996
You're having an oil millionaire
and I'm having the baby.

1724
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:33,042
When I think of how divine it'll be to
have such a thing as privacy once more...

1725
01:45:33,210 --> 01:45:34,877
...I could weep with joy.

1726
01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:38,089
This millionaire isn't gonna interfere
with your privacy none?

1727
01:45:38,716 --> 01:45:41,009
It won't be the sort of thing
you have in mind.

1728
01:45:41,176 --> 01:45:43,094
This man is a gentleman.
He respects me.

1729
01:45:43,345 --> 01:45:44,887
What he wants is my companionship.

1730
01:45:45,055 --> 01:45:47,473
Having great wealth
sometimes makes people lonely.

1731
01:45:47,641 --> 01:45:50,226
A cultivated woman,
a woman of breeding and intelligence...

1732
01:45:50,394 --> 01:45:53,813
...can enrich a man's life immeasurably.
I have those things to offer.

1733
01:45:53,981 --> 01:45:56,316
And time doesn't take them away.

1734
01:45:56,483 --> 01:46:01,362
Physical beauty is passing,
a transitory possession.

1735
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:06,492
But beauty of the mind, richness
of the spirit, tenderness of the heart...

1736
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:12,915
I have all those things... . Aren't taken
away, but grow, increase with the years.

1737
01:46:13,208 --> 01:46:14,542
Oh.

1738
01:46:16,545 --> 01:46:20,048
Strange that I should be called
a destitute woman...

1739
01:46:20,215 --> 01:46:24,260
...when I have all these treasures
locked in my heart.

1740
01:46:25,262 --> 01:46:28,931
I think of myself as a very,
very rich woman.

1741
01:46:29,099 --> 01:46:32,977
But I have been foolish,
casting my pearls before...

1742
01:46:33,145 --> 01:46:34,270
Swine, huh?

1743
01:46:34,938 --> 01:46:37,440
Yes. Swine.

1744
01:46:37,691 --> 01:46:41,110
And I'm thinking not only of you but
of Mr. Mitchell. He came here tonight.

1745
01:46:41,278 --> 01:46:44,906
He dared to come in his work clothes to
repeat slander, vicious stories from you.

1746
01:46:45,074 --> 01:46:46,908
I gave him his walking papers.

1747
01:46:47,868 --> 01:46:52,413
But then he returned. He returned with
a box of roses to beg my forgiveness.

1748
01:46:52,581 --> 01:46:54,832
He implored my forgiveness.

1749
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:58,669
But some things are not forgivable.

1750
01:47:00,422 --> 01:47:04,384
Deliberate cruelty is not forgivable!

1751
01:47:04,551 --> 01:47:07,303
It is one unforgivable thing,
in my opinion...

1752
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:09,806
...and the one thing
of which I have never...

1753
01:47:09,973 --> 01:47:11,557
...never been guilty.

1754
01:47:11,725 --> 01:47:14,977
So I said to him, "Thank you.

1755
01:47:15,145 --> 01:47:18,523
It was foolish of me to think that
we could adapt ourselves to each other.

1756
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:22,151
Our ways of life are too different,
our backgrounds are incompatible.

1757
01:47:22,444 --> 01:47:28,199
So farewell, my friend,
and let there be no hard feelings."

1758
01:47:45,676 --> 01:47:49,178
Was this before or after
you got the telegram?

1759
01:47:49,805 --> 01:47:52,890
Telegram? What telegram?

1760
01:47:53,684 --> 01:47:56,936
- Heh. As a matter of fact, my wire...
- As a matter of fact...

1761
01:47:57,104 --> 01:47:59,522
...there wasn't no wire at all.

1762
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:05,445
And there isn't no millionaire.

1763
01:48:06,905 --> 01:48:11,200
And Mitch didn't come in here with
roses, because I know where he is.

1764
01:48:11,368 --> 01:48:16,289
And there isn't a thing but imagination
and lies and deceit and tricks.

1765
01:48:16,457 --> 01:48:18,166
And look at yourself.

1766
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:21,377
Take a look at yourself here,
in a worn-out Mardi Gras outfit.

1767

from the start...

01:48:30,637 --> 01:48:33,556

over this boy's eyes.
