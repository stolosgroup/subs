00:00:44,334 --> 00:00:47,917
"Planet Vegeta"

3
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:56,751
"41 years ago"

4
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:23,042
Damn it!

5
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,001
They're crazy!

6
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:34,250
...How rude!
...They mock us with a visit like this!

7
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:37,167
Great King Cold has arrived.

8
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,376
So it would seem.

9
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:20,167
It's been too long, King Vegeta.

10
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:24,042
Great King Cold, welcome.

11
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:29,376
Allow me to introduce my son, Frieza.

12
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:37,376
I-It is a pleasure to meet
you, Frieza-<i>Sama.</i>

13
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:40,501
The pleasure is mine.

14
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,501
Getting right to it,

15
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:48,292
I have decided to retire.

16
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,084
As of now, Frieza will be
taking over my forces.

17
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:57,126
Put another way, the Cold force
will now be the Frieza force.

18
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:58,667
U-Um...

19
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:00,959
Nothing will change.

20
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:05,584
The Saiyans need only work according
to the Frieza force's orders.

21
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:07,792
If there is any slight difference,

22
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:12,834
it would be that Frieza is even
more cold-hearted than I am.

23
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:17,709
Greetings.

24
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:23,626
I have special expectations
of all of you Saiyans.

25
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:32,292
To commemorate my installment today,
I brought you some new combat items.

26
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:35,251
These are newly developed
devices called Scouters.

27
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,542
They are made more compact
than the surveillance Scout Scopes

28
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,751
that you have been using up to now,

29
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,626
and you can also simultaneously
use them as communicators.

30
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:49,667
It displays your subject's position,
battle power, and range,

31
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:52,459
just as your Scopes have done up to now.

32
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,042
Oh...?

33
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:59,542
It appears that a number of Saiyans
are targeting us with weapons.

34
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:03,459
That Saiyan hiding in there
has a battle power of...

35
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:05,876
...2,000.

36
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:08,501
That is quite outstanding.

37
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,209
That is the gist of it.

38
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,292
Handy, are they not?

39
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:28,834
For now,
I will present you with 500 units.

40
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:33,376
If that is not enough,
please let me know. Goodbye, now.

41
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:47,626
Ho! Look how big he is getting.

42
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:50,126
My son, my pride and joy,

43
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:54,209
your latent battle
power is a natural gift.

44
00:04:54,417 --> 00:05:01,917
It is you who will become the king of
the universe, not that monster Frieza.

45
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:08,126
I look forward to seeing you grow.

46
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:16,792
Who is this?!

47
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:19,792
What is he doing in a special capsule?

48
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:21,626
M-Majesty!

49
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:26,126
This child is Broly.
He is the son of Colonel Paragus.

50
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,334
Tell me why! This nursery room is here

51
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:33,667
for exceptional babies
who will become Saiyan elites!

52
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:39,459
Y-Yes, Majesty. You see... Broly's
latent abilities are especially high.

53
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:43,751
Are you telling me he has a rating
that rivals my brilliant son?!

54
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,584
Y-Yes, Majesty.

55
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:50,792
When we gauged him, his level
far exceeded the prince's.

56
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:57,501
That isn't possible. The prince's own
rating was record-setting!

57
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:59,084
Give me that!

58
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:11,292
I am terribly sorry, Majesty!
It appears to have malfunctioned.

59
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:12,792
I will get a new gauge.

60
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:14,834
Coming right now.

61
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,667
After further measurement,
his rating is less than half of before.

62
00:06:20,876 --> 00:06:23,876
He did have some anomalous
readings in the past,

63
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,167
but they must have been
due to gauge malfunctions.

64
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:29,334
But even purging the anomalous data,

65
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:32,709
Broly's latent abilities
are still substantial.

66
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,959
Once he receives training, he will grow
to become an outstanding warrior

67
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,209
and be a powerful asset for our forces.

68
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:44,292
He could even be the
legendary Super Saiyan...

69
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,084
...Paragus-<i>Sama!</i>
...Please wait!

70
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:50,834
...Hey! Get away from me!
...Please wait!

71
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:55,584
Please forgive my discourteousness.

72
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,959
I-I understand that you plan
to launch my son Broly

73
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:03,001
to an outlying world by pod?

74
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,709
That's right.

75
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:08,251
Th-That is a job for
a lower-class warrior.

76
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,876
If he develops enough
to subjugate that world,

77
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:15,667
he could become an
even stronger warrior.

78
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:18,584
Dominating worlds and
selling them for a high price...

79
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:22,251
That is what the warrior
Saiyan race does.

80
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:25,667
His destination, the Planetoid Vampa,

81
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:29,834
is an inhospitable world
without even any people on it.

82
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:33,376
I do not see how it
could sell for very much.

83
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:39,292
Your son's latent abilities
are abnormally elevated.

84
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,376
He could even be called a mutant.

85
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:46,917
Someday, he will be unable
to maintain his mental state,

86
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:53,667
and will be a danger not just to my
Vegeta forces, but the whole universe.

87
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:57,084
Be grateful that I am sending
him to another world,

88
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:58,708
and not just ending his life outright!

89
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:01,501
H-How could you...?

90
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:09,334
Y-You are jealous of Broly's latent
abilities which surpass the prince's,

91
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,376
and are just trying to get rid of him!

92
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:14,167
Say one more word,

93
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:16,751
and you'll end up dead.

94
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:21,209
Besides, it's already too late.

95
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,542
The pod has just been launched.

96
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:24,792
Wha...?

97
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:32,751
Move!

98
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,709
Wh-What are you doing?

99
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:40,417
Just a moment! You don't
have permission to launch!

100
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:44,459
...They're not authorized!
...That's dangerous!

101
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,458
...Return here at once!
Repeat, return here at once!

102
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,333
...Please return at once! Return here
at once! Repeat, return here at once!

103
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:51,542
I can't do that. I have to save my son!

104
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:55,334
King Vegeta boasted of how his prince,

105
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:58,709
who was born at the same time,
had prodigious latent abilities.

106
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:05,584
He didn't like the fact that my son
Broly's abilities exceed them.

107
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:09,959
The pod's destination
is some outlying planet.

108
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:15,084
A Planetoid called Vampa,
orbiting around Star 94.

109
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:19,751
Why? There aren't any
inhabited planets in that area.

110
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,959
The king's goal is not
to claim the planet;

111
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,584
He means to get rid of my son Broly.

112
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,709
Oh-Oh, my...

113
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:37,459
Don't worry, Beets. Once I rescue Broly,
we'll go live on some other world.

114
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:41,542
You'll drop us off there
and head back to Planet Vegeta.

115
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,834
You aren't coming back, sir?

116
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:48,292
Of course not.
If I did, I'd just be executed.

117
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:51,751
I will raise Broly to
be a mighty warrior,

118
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,542
and someday, take revenge
against King Vegeta!

119
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:35,459
So that's Planetoid Vampa.

120
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:40,084
My calculations say that the pod
arrived here two days ago.

121
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:44,042
Please be alive, Broly.
I'm coming to save you right now.

122
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,626
He should be over there somewhere!

123
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:54,001
It seemed calmer over where there
was still light. Let's land there!

124
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,667
No, we're going in hard, here!

125
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:04,084
We have to go look for him,
now! Come with me!

126
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:06,209
M-Me, too, sir?

127
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,876
Yes. I can't have you taking off
on me while I'm searching.

128
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:13,376
I wouldn't do that. Please trust me.

129
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:17,667
Ha! Is there such a thing
as a trustworthy Saiyan?

130
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:22,334
I understand that there's a new model
of those Scout Scopes.

131
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:25,792
Frieza, our new leader,
supposedly brought some with him.

132
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,292
I know.

133
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:30,959
This Frieza guy is said to be
incredibly impressive.

134
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,959
Makes no difference to me now.

135
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:39,334
Wh-What could that be?

136
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:59,209
Wh-What are those things?!

137
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:03,209
You can't be serious!
I'm not even a combatant!

138
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:11,001
It looks like the night and
the storms come as a set.

139
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:13,667
Now it's hot, though.

140
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:17,084
Could that world be a satellite?
It's perfectly full.

141
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:20,251
Don't look at it too long.
You'll become a Great Ape.

142
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:25,459
Huh? Oh, right. I've never actually
turned Great Ape before.

143
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,042
Great Apes lose all sense of themselves.

144
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:32,667
The only time to become one is if you're
cornered with no other way out.

145
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:35,709
Wh-What is this?

146
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:41,292
The ground is soft.
This doesn't seem like grass.

147
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:46,542
Those things...

148
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:50,209
It looks like they're drinking
something out of the ground.

149
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:54,876
What is that?!

150
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:10,667
That wasn't grassland;
It's a giant beast.

151
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:13,667
Those monsters live by
sucking the beasts' blood.

152
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,251
The beasts then live
off of those monsters.

153
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,292
Th-This world sure is gross...

154
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:25,501
The pod! The pod is over there!

155
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:33,167
He's not here. Where did he go?

156
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:35,584
Could he have been eaten, maybe?

157
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,417
Over there.

158
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,459
A-Are you sure this is it?

159
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,209
Broly!

160
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:18,626
You attacked a monster
and ate its leg? That's my boy!

161
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,542
That's Broly?

162
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:27,126
Battle power 920?!
That's stronger than I am, you know!

163
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,959
Even if he is a gifted child
with a high battle power,

164
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:33,292
he couldn't have defeated
that monster at 920.

165
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:40,292
Look here. His suit is a bit
stretched and baggy.

166
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:44,626
He must have looked at that
full moon and turned Great Ape.

167
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:47,042
Let's hurry and leave this world.

168
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:49,709
It got pretty roughed up, huh?

169
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:53,001
Oh-Oh, no...!

170
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:53,959
What is it?

171
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:57,042
The main floater is cracked!

172
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:59,417
You mean you can't fix it?

173
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:03,126
Absolutely not. Without a new floater...

174
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:06,084
What? You mean we're stuck here?!

175
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:10,001
We can't even radio for help like this.

176
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,709
There's enough food
and water for ten days.

177
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:16,084
Do you think anyone will
find us in just ten days?!

178
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:21,126
We really shouldn't have
crash landed after all.

179
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:25,209
This will save one
person's worth of food.

180
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:33,209
"Five years later"

181
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,876
Bardock-<i>san</i>... Bardock-<i>san!</i>

182
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:40,251
What?

183
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,751
We're almost to Planet Vegeta.

184
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,542
It's been a long time, huh?

185
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:45,751
Yeah.

186
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:48,126
What do you suppose this is about...

187
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:51,876
Ordering the Saiyans to hurry
and assemble at Planet Vegeta?

188
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,251
Apparently,
that Frieza bastard ordered it.

189
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,417
Take off your Scouter. They'll hear you.

190
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:58,126
Ah, that's right!

191
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,042
Look at that.

192
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:07,001
All the others are
coming back home, too.

193
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:08,709
Look over there.

194
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,584
That's Frieza's ship.

195
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:15,876
There's still some time left,
but it's already standing by?

196
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:20,292
You don't think it's strange?

197
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:21,792
If he just wants to speak to us,

198
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:25,709
he doesn't need to bring us back to
the planet; He could just use the radio.

199
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:27,584
If he wants to give us new weapons,

200
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:30,126
there's no point in hurrying
to gather us together.

201
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:35,709
There really is something
fishy going on here.

202
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:38,834
Huh? What do you mean, fishy?

203
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,876
Conquering planets and selling them

204
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,709
has always been the livelihood
of the warrior Saiyan race.

205
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:52,292
Then Frieza's father, Cold,
subjugated us by force

206
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:54,459
and placed us under his rule.

207
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:57,417
That was a long time ago, right?

208
00:16:57,626 --> 00:17:00,209
Do you think we're
getting along well now?

209
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:04,001
Well, there aren't any Saiyans
that like Frieza.

210
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:10,376
And Frieza likely feels
the same way about Saiyans.

211
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:11,126
Huh?

212
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:14,376
Right now,
the Frieza force has grown larger.

213
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:18,876
They could probably get by
even without us annoying Saiyans around.

214
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:28,001
Y-You're not saying he's planning
to exterminate us, are you?

215
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:30,709
I'm just saying, maybe.

216
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,501
Oh-Oh, come on, Bardock-<i>san.</i>

217
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:41,292
Yo, Bardock! Made it back alive, huh?

218
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:42,542
Hey,

219
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,334
do you know the reason
for this summons order?

220
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:50,042
Beats me. Maybe they found a fairly
big-league world to go after.

221
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:53,542
Something that will take
all of us to conquer.

222
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:56,584
That's it! That's what this is.

223
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,501
Come to think of it, the people
that report directly to Frieza

224
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:03,167
were going around asking
about the Super Saiyan.

225
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:09,042
The Super Saiyan? Like in the legend?

226
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:10,542
That's why!

227
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:14,542
The Super Saiyan...

228
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,292
...and Super Saiyan God...

229
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:20,959
We've looked into them,
but they appear to just be legends.

230
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,542
That is about what I was thinking.

231
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:30,334
I cannot afford the least bit of
anxiety, so I had to make sure.

232
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,209
So then, are you canceling the attack?

233
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,751
You must be joking.

234
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:40,459
Not after they have
all assembled together.

235
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:47,126
This is the perfect opportunity to be
rid of them, planet and all, is it not?

236
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,501
Welcome home, Bardock-<i>san!</i>

237
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:51,709
Yeah.

238
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,209
Yo, I'm home, Gine.

239
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,417
Huh? Bardock!

240
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,709
Things sure are buzzing in town.

241
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:03,959
Yeah, since everyone has come home.

242
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,251
Where's Raditz?

243
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:06,876
He's a combatant now.

244
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:09,791
He's teamed with Prince Vegeta,
and they're off on some other world.

245
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,167
They haven't come back yet, though.

246
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:14,834
Prince Vegeta, huh?

247
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:18,417
There's a piece of
work to be stuck with.

248
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:19,751
What about Kakarot?

249
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,959
Still in the child-rearing capsule?

250
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:22,834
Yeah.

251
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:26,376
It's just about time to let him out,
though. Want to see him?

252
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,084
He's small.

253
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:34,584
He seems to be the slow-starter type.

254
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,876
He looks just like you,
though, doesn't he?

255
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:39,667
Especially your distinctive hairstyle.

256
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:47,084
After dark, I'm going to go steal a pod.

257
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:49,959
We're going to send
him to another world.

258
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,501
Huh? You're kidding, right?

259
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:54,376
No, I'm serious.

260
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:57,709
Why would you go and do
something like that now?

261
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:00,042
He hasn't even learned to talk yet!

262
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:05,417
With Kakarot's latent abilities,
he's destined to be sent away anyhow.

263
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:09,209
So, we're going to see to it that
it's at least a better planet.

264
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,292
But it's still too soon.

265
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:15,584
There may not be any time left.

266
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,001
Time?

267
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:23,001
Frieza is afraid of the legendary
Super Saiyan appearing.

268
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:30,084
Super Saiyan? But that's...
only a fable, isn't it?

269
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:34,542
Yeah. But he can't help
but be bothered by it.

270
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:37,626
And he's up to no good.

271
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:43,292
I get the feeling that
death is on its way.

272
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,542
On second thought, let's not do this.

273
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,292
Don't worry.

274
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,709
If I turn out to be wrong,
I'll go rescue him right away.

275
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:02,167
In that case, why don't the three of us
run away some place?

276
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:06,584
We can't. We'd be found out
on their Scouters in no time.

277
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,459
But...

278
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,917
...why would you go to such lengths?

279
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:16,001
It's not like a Saiyan man
to worry about his children.

280
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,909
Maybe it's because I'm always
in the middle of a battle,

281
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:23,834
and I'd like to save
something instead for once.

282
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:28,542
Especially someone deemed to be
a lower-class warrior...

283
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:30,376
My son.

284
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:38,751
I've programmed in a distant
planet named earth.

285
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:43,334
It's a world inhabited by people with
lower technology and combat levels.

286
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:46,167
I think even you'll be
able to survive there.

287
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:48,876
Moreover, it's not of much worth,

288
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:52,584
so the chances that it will be
targeted by Frieza are also low.

289
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:54,417
If Bardock is overthinking the matter,

290
00:21:54,626 --> 00:21:56,626
we'll come and get you right away, okay?

291
00:21:56,834 --> 00:22:00,167
Listen, you survive, no matter what!

292
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:04,167
We'll see you later!

293
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:08,751
Bye.

294
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:19,709
Kakarot!!

295
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:42,917
Without the Saiyans,
our fighting force will be cut in half.

296
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:45,751
Even at that,
we will still be able to get by.

297
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:49,292
They have no choice but to
pretend to be submissive,

298
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,876
but they may bare their
fangs at any time.

299
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:53,126
Oh?

300
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:57,751
They are, after all, a warrior race.

301
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:02,959
One must sweep the dust away
before it can be stirred up.

302
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:13,792
I feel much better now.

303
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:25,251
What was that?!

304
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:26,626
What's wrong?

305
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:28,751
A message from the Frieza force.

306
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:32,709
A meteor collided with Planet Vegeta...

307
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:36,126
I-It was obliterated...!

308
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,084
Wh-What?!

309
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:41,251
Then most of the Saiyans were wiped out?

310
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:44,792
Why didn't they detect
the meteor approaching?

311
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:51,709
We're lucky, aren't we... ignoring
Frieza's order to gather like that?

312
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:55,209
Tch, I never got to be King Vegeta.

313
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:58,376
Vegeta, you have a brother, don't you?

314
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:01,501
Come to think of it, what became of him?

315
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,751
Not that I'm interested.

316
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,757
Raditz, you had a younger
brother, too, right?

317
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:10,667
Hmph, he was determined
to be a lower-class warrior,

318
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:13,667
so he was in a home
child-rearing capsule.

319
00:25:13,876 --> 00:25:15,209
Disgraceful.

320
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:22,126
Hmm? My mother contacted me
saying he was sent off in a pod.

321
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:24,501
It doesn't matter to me, though.

322
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:06,834
"Present Day"

323
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:24,126
Mmm, delicious!

324
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:29,209
Ah, the food! The air!
This cottage really is beyond terrific!

325
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:31,709
Right, Bulma-<i>san?</i>

326
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,501
Nice, isn't it?

327
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,126
We had it built many years ago.

328
00:26:53,334 --> 00:26:57,834
Out here on this unoccupied island,
1,600 kilometers south of Metro West,

329
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,751
they can cut loose a
little and still be fine.

330
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:06,292
They're likely to destroy Metro West
before long otherwise.

331
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:18,709
Keep it down!!

332
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:22,542
Stop fighting so loud!

333
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:31,542
By the way, Goku-<i>san</i>...

334
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:35,209
Why do you seek even greater strength?

335
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:39,251
Is it because you are after
the position of Destroyer?

336
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:43,042
What was that? I can't let that slide.

337
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:44,417
No, it ain't.

338
00:27:44,626 --> 00:27:47,251
I don't wanna be anything like that.

339
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,751
<i>"That"</i> was over the line.

340
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,292
When I saw how ridiculously strong
the guys in other universes were

341
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:56,501
in that all-universe tournament earlier,

342
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,626
it got me fired...

343
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:01,334
...up!

344
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:05,667
You mean your sights are
already set on other universes?

345
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:08,042
You're as big a buffoon as ever.

346
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:12,876
Then Vegeta-<i>san,</i> why do you seek
even greater strength?

347
00:28:13,084 --> 00:28:14,417
Frieza!

348
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:18,334
This dumb-ass right here
decided to bring that devil

349
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:20,459
of all people back to life, that's why!

350
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:26,792
Hey, if it wasn't for Frieza, our
7th Universe might not still be here.

351
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:28,584
Oh, is that right?

352
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:31,334
Yeah. He helped save us.

353
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:35,459
Idiot! He was only thinking
of himself in doing so.

354
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:41,584
You saw Frieza when he came
to earth before, remember?

355
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:44,792
He accomplished that much
in that short amount of time.

356
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:50,917
You're saying he might get even
more powerful and come to defeat us?

357
00:28:51,126 --> 00:28:52,459
No doubt about it.

358
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:57,001
I don't know. Even though we
brought him back to life?

359
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:01,834
You idiot! Do you think
he feels obligated to us?!

360
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:05,209
How many times are you
gonna call me an idiot?

361
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:10,876
As often as I want to, idiot!!

362
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,251
Hmm? It's Trunks.

363
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:18,459
What is it?

364
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:23,667
It looks like a burglar
broke into your lab.

365
00:29:23,876 --> 00:29:26,167
Huh? What was stolen?

366
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:28,334
I'll check the security video.

367
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:29,876
Let's see...

368
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:33,959
The Dragon Balls that you collected

369
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:36,459
and the Dragon Radar.

370
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,792
They took what?!

371
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:43,626
Like I told you,
you need better security.

372
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,917
You know what, Mama?

373
00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:48,292
The burglars that show up...

374
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:52,292
They were wearing clothes like Papa's.

375
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,584
Huh?!

376
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:02,251
Thank you, Trunks.

377
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:05,209
The culprits are Frieza's men.

378
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:07,709
He deliberately used some men
with lower battle powers

379
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:10,251
so we wouldn't notice them.

380
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:14,626
Frieza sure is relentless in
going after the Dragon Balls.

381
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:18,792
I wonder what sort of wish
he could have at this point.

382
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:22,001
He ain't able to wish for anything
beyond Shenron's power,

383
00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:25,459
so wishing to be made the strongest
in the universe is out.

384
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:29,459
That should be obvious;
His wish is to never die.

385
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:30,459
Yeah, but,

386
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:33,959
not dying is pointless
if you still lose.

387
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:38,626
Even so, there's a chance that
someday, he'll surpass us!

388
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:40,334
There is?

389
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:45,459
I had six of the Dragon Balls.

390
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:49,001
They're sure to go where
the last one is to find it.

391
00:30:49,209 --> 00:30:50,291
Where is it?

392
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:51,709
The ice continent.

393
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,834
I don't like the cold, so I was
putting off going to get it.

394
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:56,917
The ice continent?

395
00:30:58,042 --> 00:30:59,709
Would you like to come, too?

396
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:02,376
Hmph, I'm taking a nap.

397
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:06,042
Oh, my, does that not sound like fun?

398
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:07,751
Anything good to eat there?

399
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,876
I wouldn't count on it.

400
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:11,959
Then count me out.

401
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:14,709
Terrific! Then here,

402
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,751
look after Bulla.

403
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,626
Thank you!

404
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:22,626
Hey! Why, you...!

405
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:29,209
The ice continent is cold.

406
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:33,626
We'll have to buy some
cold-weather gear on the way.

407
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:37,167
Why were you collecting
the Dragon Balls?

408
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:40,251
Never you mind.

409
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:42,001
Tell me!

410
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:48,417
I was going to make myself younger.
About five years' worth.

411
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:51,834
You were gonna use the Dragon Balls
for something that unimportant?!

412
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:56,084
You hush!
You Saiyans wouldn't understand!

413
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,376
Hmph.

414
00:31:57,584 --> 00:32:01,626
Why only five years? Why not any longer?

415
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:04,584
It would seem unnatural to become
young again all at once, right?!

416
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,084
I'm sure people would say...

417
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:12,626
"Oh? Bulma-<i>san,</i> you suddenly
look young again, don't you?

418
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:17,501
I wonder, have you had some work done?"

419
00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:19,292
...and so forth.

420
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:23,584
Hold on. You've <i>already</i> been using
the Dragon Balls from time to time, huh?

421
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:51,126
Frieza-<i>Sama,</i>

422
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:54,042
along with the Dragon Radar,

423
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:58,626
Vegeta's wife was already in possession
of six of the Dragon Balls,

424
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,542
so our search team obtained them,

425
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:04,501
and they are now heading to the site
of the last one to locate it.

426
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:07,292
That is marvelous news.

427
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:11,709
So, shall we start up the ship
and head for earth?

428
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:16,251
No, we can do that once they
find all seven Dragon Balls.

429
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:19,167
It would be dangerous to rush there
and arrive too early.

430
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:25,042
Even without Scouters, they can tell
if a high battle power is approaching.

431
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:29,042
Understood.

432
00:33:29,251 --> 00:33:32,376
You have written down
how to make the wish, yes?

433
00:33:32,584 --> 00:33:34,959
Yes, to the letter.

434
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:37,084
By the way...

435
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:38,751
What is it, Kikono?

436
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:45,292
N-Nothing... just... once
the Dragon Balls are gathered,

437
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:51,084
I was wondering, Frieza-<i>Sama,</i>
what sort of wish would you be making?

438
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:54,751
Would it be to have an immortal body,
as you have mentioned before?

439
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,584
No, it would not.

440
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:58,834
Huh?

441
00:34:00,126 --> 00:34:02,709
I realized something
when I was in earth's hell

442
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,209
and rendered unable to move...

443
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,376
That not being able
to either die or move

444
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:09,709
was nothing but misery.

445
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:13,876
Then... perhaps,

446
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:19,209
to not ever take any damage...
or something?

447
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:23,667
That would make the game no fun to play.

448
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:27,834
Hmm... What could it be...?

449
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,042
You will never guess.

450
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:35,876
You wish to increase your
height, correct?

451
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:40,876
Huh?! B-Berryblue-san!
How could you say that?!

452
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:43,709
There are so many soldiers
who have called Frieza-<i>Sama</i>

453
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:48,709
a "pipsqueak" behind his back
who have been eliminated, after all.

454
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:51,709
Well deduced, Berryblue-<i>san</i>.

455
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:54,084
You are correct.

456
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,501
Huh?!

457
00:34:56,459 --> 00:34:58,501
That was the right answer?!

458
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:01,501
Can you promise not to tell anyone?

459
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:04,126
Oh-Of course!

460
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:07,542
I would like...

461
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:11,792
...to grow by about... five centimeters.

462
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:13,626
Huh?!

463
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:15,542
Th-Then,

464
00:35:15,751 --> 00:35:19,209
if you adopted your
second transformation,

465
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,834
would that not be sufficiently tall?

466
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:28,751
Oh, no! I wish to be taller
in my regular and final forms.

467
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:33,251
Then, why only a mere five centimeters?

468
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:38,501
It would seem unnatural to become
tall all at once, right?!

469
00:35:40,376 --> 00:35:44,417
I want it to look like
I am still growing.

470
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:49,334
I-I see...

471
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:59,251
There's nobody around here.

472
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:04,376
There just aren't that many folks
with a battle power of at least 1,000.

473
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:05,876
What choice do we have?

474
00:36:06,084 --> 00:36:09,209
Our orders were to go find as
many combatants as we could

475
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,209
to rebuild the force.

476
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:13,666
There already were a bunch
of combatants, weren't there?

477
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:16,167
Rumor has it that they were
fighting too timidly,

478
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:19,334
so Frieza-<i>Sama</i> killed them all.

479
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:21,458
Tch.

480
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:24,584
Cheelai, why did you
join the Frieza force?

481
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:28,959
It got out that I stole
a Galactic Patrol spaceship.

482
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:32,876
They can't touch me if I'm
in the Frieza force, right?

483
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:33,751
You're scum.

484
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,042
Yeah, well...

485
00:36:36,251 --> 00:36:38,876
Lemo-<i>san,</i> you've been in the Frieza
force the whole time, right?

486
00:36:39,084 --> 00:36:41,209
Have you ever met Frieza-<i>Sama?</i>

487
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:45,751
I'm not a combatant; I've only ever
seen him on the station.

488
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,584
I hear he's teeny.

489
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:53,459
Don't ever say anything like that again.
Not if you want to live.

490
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:55,042
All right.

491
00:36:55,251 --> 00:36:58,376
He's killed some people before
just for having bad breath.

492
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:01,501
Still, if he's putting women
and old men to work,

493
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:04,459
the Frieza force might have
just about had it, huh?

494
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:08,167
What's that?

495
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:09,584
A distress signal!

496
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:13,501
What's more, it's an awfully
old type of Frieza force signal.

497
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,166
It's coming from that world over there.

498
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:18,626
If we rescue them,
we may get a special bonus.

499
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:21,917
All right, let's get down there!

500
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:30,209
There's no one here.

501
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:31,501
There, you see?

502
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:33,751
I'll try using my Scouter.

503
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:39,376
Are you the Frieza force?

504
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:51,667
Is that a tail?
That means, y-you're a Saiyan!

505
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:53,334
"Saiyan"?

506
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:59,334
Yeah. I'm Paragus.
I'm a Frieza force Saiyan.

507
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:01,042
So that distress signal...

508
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:04,959
Yeah, that was me.
My spaceship broke down.

509
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:13,084
I've waited an unbelievably long time,
and now, I'm saved!

510
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:17,167
Battle power 4,200. Great.

511
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:18,709
Are you alone?

512
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:20,334
No, there's one other...

513
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:30,167
Broly!!

514
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:47,376
This is my son, Broly.

515
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:51,251
N-No way!

516
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:52,126
What?

517
00:38:52,334 --> 00:38:56,792
H-His battle power is...
B-beyond measure!

518
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,834
Hmm? Ridiculous. That's not possible...

519
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:06,459
Hop in! Frieza-<i>Sama</i> will be delighted!

520
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:16,001
Let's see... What was your name again?

521
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:17,584
Broly.

522
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:20,959
You want one of these, Broly?

523
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:24,709
They're good. Here.

524
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:30,167
You have to unwrap it first!

525
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:35,959
Eat it, Broly.

526
00:39:41,751 --> 00:39:44,876
Ha-ha! Well? It's good, right?

527
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:48,709
What, not even a thank you?

528
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:51,751
Tell her thanks, Broly.

529
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:54,501
Thank you... very much.

530
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:58,584
That's formal. Just "thank you" is fine.

531
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:02,334
Th-Thank you.

532
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:03,626
Sure!

533
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:09,709
I have brought them, Frieza-<i>Sama.</i>

534
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:11,792
Ho...

535
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:16,542
Are you really a Saiyan?

536
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,042
You do not appear to have a tail.

537
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:23,251
No, sir.

538
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:27,792
The effects of transforming into
a Great Ape, which is a Saiyan trait,

539
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:30,292
caused him to lose all sense of himself.

540
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:32,876
Which is why I cut off his tail.

541
00:40:33,084 --> 00:40:36,709
Has he lost his sense of himself since?

542
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:39,042
Yes, sir, on rare occasions.

543
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:42,709
So you are saying that it does
sometimes still happen?

544
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:47,001
P-Please do not worry.
When that happens...

545
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:52,084
...using this remote control, electricity
runs through the device around Broly's neck.

546
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:55,917
It is not a strong current,
but it allows me to control him.

547
00:40:56,126 --> 00:40:57,959
I see.

548
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:01,917
What is your name?

549
00:41:05,334 --> 00:41:07,292
It is Broly, sir.

550
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:14,001
I see you still have a tremendous level
of yet-untapped battle power.

551
00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:19,584
I am certain that he can be of
great use to you, Frieza-<i>Sama</i>.

552
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:22,709
This is indeed an unexpected bounty.

553
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:27,959
Berryblue-<i>san,</i> please offer a reward
to the two who found him.

554
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:32,292
Th-This much?!

555
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:34,667
...Thank you very much!
...Thank you very much!

556
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:38,625
I understand that you were unable
to escape from that barren planet

557
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:41,209
for quite a long time.

558
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:42,459
Yes, sir.

559
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:49,334
Are you aware that your home world
of Planet Vegeta is no longer there?

560
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:56,209
Yes, sir. I heard so on the way here.
But none of that matters now.

561
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:57,751
It's just...

562
00:41:57,959 --> 00:42:00,334
Vengeance, yes?

563
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:08,917
Paragus-<i>san,</i> did you know that
King Vegeta's son, Vegeta IV,

564
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,709
is still alive?

565
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:13,126
Wh-What?!

566
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:15,251
Prince Vegeta?!

567
00:42:15,459 --> 00:42:19,334
Why... that miserable Vegeta...!

568
00:42:20,126 --> 00:42:23,959
Allow me to lend you some assistance
with your vengeance.

569
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:28,876
Berryblue-<i>san,</i> once these two
have had a shower,

570
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:32,001
please arrange for some
battle uniforms for them.

571
00:42:33,126 --> 00:42:34,542
Yes, sir.

572
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:42,834
I had not meant to fight this
time, but now...

573
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:46,792
This is starting to get interesting.

574
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:55,417
Yo!

575
00:42:55,626 --> 00:42:57,667
You're looking freshly
scrubbed, aren't you?

576
00:42:57,876 --> 00:42:59,376
Come eat with us.

577
00:42:59,584 --> 00:43:02,376
Broly, where's your battle uniform?

578
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:05,709
It's... hard to move in it.

579
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,001
It's not once you put it on.

580
00:43:08,209 --> 00:43:11,001
Do whatever you like, though.

581
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:14,459
But get rid of that
fur around your waist.

582
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:16,917
It's dirty, and it stinks.

583
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:18,959
No!

584
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:26,084
Oh-Oh, so it's something
important to you.

585
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:31,542
This... is my...

586
00:43:31,751 --> 00:43:33,917
Broly, we're here to eat,

587
00:43:34,126 --> 00:43:35,917
not to talk.

588
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:41,667
You can at least let him
talk that much, can't you?

589
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:44,334
I'd appreciate it if you didn't butt in.

590
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:45,626
Huh?!

591
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:46,917
Now, now...

592
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:48,126
Hey,

593
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:50,459
are you new?

594
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:55,709
It can't be any fun hanging out
with this sour bunch.

595
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:59,626
I'm the only combatant aboard
this ship for this operation

596
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:01,917
who's any good.

597
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:04,042
Come on over with me.

598
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:08,167
Let go of me! I told you no, didn't I?!

599
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:10,834
How about if I buy you a drink?

600
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:12,751
Shut up, old man!

601
00:44:16,084 --> 00:44:17,292
Stop, Broly!

602
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:20,667
What do you want?
You got a problem with me?

603
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:23,958
I do.

604
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:26,542
What did you say?!

605
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,876
Wha...?! Damn it! Damn it!

606
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:31,917
Broly!

607
00:44:57,917 --> 00:44:59,501
Are you okay?!

608
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:01,917
You!

609
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:05,167
You went too far!
How could you do that to him?!

610
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:08,626
If I hadn't stopped him,
he might have killed him.

611
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:12,042
Just how did you raise him?

612
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:16,334
Hmph, while we are in your debt,
we don't seem to see eye to eye.

613
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:19,001
From now on, please do not
come near my son.

614
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:22,417
Tch.

615
00:45:24,292 --> 00:45:25,542
Paragus-<i>san,</i>

616
00:45:25,751 --> 00:45:27,959
Frieza-<i>Sama</i> is calling for you.

617
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:31,709
Frieza-<i>Sama?</i> Yes, we will
come right away. Broly!

618
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:34,667
No, just you, Paragus-<i>san.</i>

619
00:45:34,876 --> 00:45:37,167
Huh? Oh, I see.

620
00:45:37,376 --> 00:45:40,376
Broly, I'll be right back. Wait here.

621
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:45,584
My dead creep of a father
might be better than this guy.

622
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:47,667
Huh?

623
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:53,876
Oh, you swiped that?

624
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,792
This is what I think of this thing!

625
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:04,584
Broly, thank you for earlier.

626
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:14,001
Oh, you want some water?
Let me have that.

627
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:18,626
Here.

628
00:46:24,584 --> 00:46:26,626
What is this?

629
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:29,001
Huh? It's ordinary water.

630
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:32,167
Haven't you ever had water before?

631
00:46:42,292 --> 00:46:44,042
That was good.

632
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:49,084
This is Ba's ear.

633
00:46:50,001 --> 00:46:52,417
Oh, you mean the fur?

634
00:46:52,626 --> 00:46:56,334
Me and Ba got along well.

635
00:46:56,542 --> 00:47:01,209
Ba is a big, big, beast,
bigger than this ship.

636
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:05,376
"Ba" is the sound Ba made,
so that's what I called Ba.

637
00:47:05,584 --> 00:47:07,126
Ba was scary,

638
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:13,626
but day after day, while doing
training by dodging Ba's attacks,

639
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:16,126
we became friends.

640
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,709
We became good friends.

641
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:28,501
So Ba was the first
friend you ever made.

642
00:47:28,709 --> 00:47:36,292
But Dad was angry. Being friends
with Ba isn't training. So then...

643
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:43,292
Dad shot Ba's ear with a gun,
making Ba angry.

644
00:47:43,501 --> 00:47:47,376
Ba never became friends with me again.

645
00:47:48,334 --> 00:47:53,126
That's why I decided
to stay with Ba's ear.

646
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:58,542
You sure talked a lot, Broly.

647
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:03,209
This is the first time I've ever heard
such a pure story around here.

648
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:06,751
You seriously are innocent.

649
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:11,042
I'll bet you don't even like to
fight, do you?

650
00:48:12,459 --> 00:48:15,334
You just had an incredible gift
for rough-and-tumble fighting,

651
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:18,959
so your old man forced you
to train, didn't he?

652
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:21,167
That father of yours!

653
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:25,459
He only thinks of you as
a powerful weapon, doesn't he?

654
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:27,917
One used for vengeance
and getting ahead.

655
00:48:28,126 --> 00:48:32,251
Probably. Your old man is the worst.

656
00:48:32,459 --> 00:48:35,501
You don't have to do everything
that guy tells you.

657
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:42,126
It's not right for you to say
bad things about Dad.

658
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:50,334
It should be around here somewhere...

659
00:48:52,459 --> 00:48:54,709
You dumb-ass! Hurry and pull me up!

660
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:56,251
Sorry!

661
00:49:03,626 --> 00:49:05,542
Found it! I found it!

662
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:10,542
The planet called earth
to which we are about to go

663
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:13,876
will have Vegeta and one other Saiyan.

664
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:17,251
I would like to see Broly-<i>san</i>'S power.

665
00:49:17,459 --> 00:49:21,042
The innate strength that Broly
possesses is super-prodigious.

666
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:23,876
We will achieve our
long-sought vengeance!

667
00:49:24,084 --> 00:49:28,459
Incidentally, you are free to do
with Vegeta whatever you wish...

668
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:35,751
But please allow me to finish off
the other Saiyan named Son Goku.

669
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:41,376
Killing Son Goku has long been
a dream of mine, you see!

670
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:44,376
As you wish.

671
00:49:44,584 --> 00:49:48,459
Frieza-<i>Sama,</i> we have collected
all seven Dragon Balls!

672
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:51,167
Oh, that is outstanding!

673
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,917
Down there! Frieza's men!

674
00:50:05,126 --> 00:50:08,042
Tch, they've already found the last one?

675
00:50:09,834 --> 00:50:12,167
That aircraft looks like
trouble, doesn't it?

676
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:15,459
Could those be the Saiyans that
Kikono-<i>Sama</i> warned us about?

677
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:20,709
Whoo! Now this is cold!

678
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,757
Whis-<i>san,</i> I'm surprised
it doesn't bother you.

679
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:26,334
The vacuum of space is even colder.

680
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:30,209
Y-Yikes!

681
00:50:30,417 --> 00:50:33,751
The Scouter's readings just spiked!
It's the Saiyans!

682
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:35,376
We're getting out of here!

683
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:46,751
Hey, you!

684
00:50:46,959 --> 00:50:49,459
Come on out and give
back the Dragon Balls!

685
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:52,209
Wh-What do we do?

686
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:56,126
Wh-What do we do?
If we don't give them back,

687
00:50:56,334 --> 00:50:58,542
he'll kill us.

688
00:50:59,626 --> 00:51:03,292
If we <i>do</i> give them back,
Frieza-<i>Sama</i> will kill us!

689
00:51:24,792 --> 00:51:25,875
Well, well,

690
00:51:25,876 --> 00:51:27,792
here comes Frieza's entrance.

691
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,667
Hmm? What's that?

692
00:51:30,876 --> 00:51:34,126
It ain't just Frieza.
There's some other...

693
00:51:34,334 --> 00:51:36,376
...out-of-this-world guy in there.

694
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:08,417
Those are Saiyans, aren't they?

695
00:52:14,209 --> 00:52:17,292
Vegeta! There's no doubt about it.

696
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:22,167
He looks just like the king.

697
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:28,376
What are you doing here, Frieza?

698
00:52:28,584 --> 00:52:30,501
I am sure you already know.

699
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:34,334
Having a wish granted
by the Dragon Balls.

700
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:40,834
What are those ball-like things?

701
00:52:41,042 --> 00:52:42,042
Beats me.

702
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:44,042
Go ask someone.

703
00:52:44,584 --> 00:52:48,167
Hey! Go get the Dragon Balls back!

704
00:52:48,376 --> 00:52:50,584
It appears that we
have a larger problem.

705
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:51,376
Huh?

706
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:55,876
I suppose you might call it
the nature of their warrior race.

707
00:52:56,084 --> 00:52:58,334
Frieza, who are those two?

708
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:01,376
These are the newest enlistees
to the Frieza force,

709
00:53:01,584 --> 00:53:05,084
Broly-<i>san</i> and his father...

710
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:06,417
...Paragus!

711
00:53:06,626 --> 00:53:12,501
There you have it. As you appear to have
noticed, they, like you, are Saiyans.

712
00:53:12,709 --> 00:53:14,501
I don't know them.

713
00:53:14,709 --> 00:53:18,334
I understand that when you were
quite little, your father, King Vegeta,

714
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:23,417
did a terrible disservice to
Paragus-<i>san</i> and Broly-<i>san,</i> here,

715
00:53:23,626 --> 00:53:29,209
and up until now, they were trapped
on an unfamiliar, inimical world.

716
00:53:35,376 --> 00:53:36,876
Frieza!

717
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:40,959
What's "inimical"?

718
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:46,667
It means "beyond severe."

719
00:53:47,501 --> 00:53:48,501
Thanks.

720
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,126
You idiot!

721
00:53:51,334 --> 00:53:55,501
I swear that you, at least,
will pay for that, Vegeta!

722
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:59,417
We are here to take revenge!

723
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:03,626
Don't be ridiculous!
How is that any of my affair?

724
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:05,626
He ain't got nothing to do with that!

725
00:54:05,834 --> 00:54:07,542
We're all Saiyans here.

726
00:54:07,751 --> 00:54:09,459
Let's just get along.

727
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,417
Frieza-<i>Sama?</i>

728
00:54:19,334 --> 00:54:22,751
He appears unable to wait. Very well.

729
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:26,376
Please show me what he has.

730
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:28,751
Understood, sir.

731
00:54:28,959 --> 00:54:30,834
All right! Broly!

732
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:32,334
Do it!

733
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:57,417
You're not bad, huh?
I'm finally starting to warm up!

734
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:12,542
He's fast!

735
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:16,542
He must have studied
how to use his power.

736
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:25,042
It looks like Vegeta is
fairly well-trained, too.

737
00:55:25,251 --> 00:55:29,542
They have been through their
own share of battles, after all.

738
00:55:29,751 --> 00:55:33,167
Moreover, your son seems
yet unaccustomed to this.

739
00:55:33,376 --> 00:55:36,917
Broly-san has never fought
another person, correct?

740
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:39,209
Only simulated fights with me.

741
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:44,167
Fighting against someone of your
battle power is all but meaningless.

742
00:55:45,126 --> 00:55:46,876
Not to worry.

743
00:55:47,084 --> 00:55:49,334
He is steadily becoming
more familiar with it.

744
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:03,751
Good, Broly!

745
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:16,584
You're a real pest!

746
00:56:26,084 --> 00:56:27,292
Hmph.

747
00:56:45,792 --> 00:56:48,459
Wh-What is that?!

748
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:53,792
Oh, is Broly-<i>san</i> not able
to turn Super Saiyan?

749
00:56:54,001 --> 00:56:58,251
S-Super Saiyan? You don't mean...

750
00:56:58,459 --> 00:56:59,834
...like the legend?

751
00:57:31,917 --> 00:57:34,126
What's with this guy?

752
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:42,376
He's quick to develop!

753
00:58:02,001 --> 00:58:06,459
He's awesome! He's starting to
hold his own in his base form!

754
00:58:59,126 --> 00:59:03,042
I-I never imagined that Vegeta
had improved so much.

755
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:05,792
Oh, has he reached his limit already?

756
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:08,584
Y-Yes, sir.

757
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,709
Oh, very well.

758
00:59:10,917 --> 00:59:13,751
Perhaps we should call it a day.

759
00:59:13,959 --> 00:59:15,167
Yes, sir.

760
00:59:21,334 --> 00:59:22,709
What is this?

761
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:29,792
N-No! Broly! That's enough for now!

762
00:59:30,001 --> 00:59:33,126
Stop! Come back!

763
00:59:41,417 --> 00:59:43,334
I-It's gone!

764
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:46,959
My remote control is gone! Oh, no!

765
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:51,876
Broly!! I told you to stop!

766
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:59,792
Didn't you hear what I said?!

767
01:00:02,501 --> 01:00:04,084
This is ridiculous.

768
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:07,959
S-Stop, Vegeta!!

769
01:01:03,792 --> 01:01:05,251
No way...

770
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:06,084
Wha...?

771
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:08,251
Have you ever seen
a Saiyan like this before?

772
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:11,626
Hey, did you bring any
Senzu beans, Kakarot?!

773
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,209
No, I didn't!

774
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:17,001
This is no time to be playing around.

775
01:01:42,501 --> 01:01:45,917
Eep! If that had hit the ground...!

776
01:01:55,501 --> 01:01:56,792
Vegeta!

777
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:04,751
What is that?

778
01:02:04,959 --> 01:02:06,792
Th-That...?

779
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:10,042
He seems to have become able to
transform and take on the power

780
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:12,959
that Saiyans have when
becoming Great Apes,

781
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:17,167
without a Great Ape's lumbering moves,
by remaining in his humanoid form.

782
01:02:18,626 --> 01:02:20,251
Is there some issue with it?

783
01:02:20,459 --> 01:02:22,751
Th-The thing is...

784
01:02:24,959 --> 01:02:29,501
He cannot even control it himself.

785
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:43,126
Hey, you!

786
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:50,001
I think it's about time you fought me.

787
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:47,917
Hey, calm down!

788
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:09,042
We all live in peace here on the earth!

789
01:06:14,751 --> 01:06:19,626
Well, a lot...
has happened, but still...

790
01:06:24,417 --> 01:06:27,084
Whatever the case, you ain't a bad guy.

791
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:29,167
I can tell.

792
01:06:30,959 --> 01:06:35,792
Stop doing this. You don't have to
listen to what those bad guys say.

793
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:19,167
Frieza-<i>Sama,</i> is it okay
if we back off a little?!

794
01:07:19,376 --> 01:07:21,959
That would seem to be for the best.

795
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:30,251
We will take charge of the Dragon Balls!

796
01:07:32,042 --> 01:07:38,209
We are now free to watch your
son's exploits without reservation.

797
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:07,626
That guy is that phenomenal?

798
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,584
Still, this...

799
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:11,417
...isn't right.

800
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:12,709
Yeah.

801
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:20,084
It's because of his old man.

802
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:21,459
Yeah.

803
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:26,542
This is the result of him
taking that sweet Broly

804
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:30,584
and raising him to be the kind of
warrior that he wants him to be.

805
01:08:30,792 --> 01:08:33,417
And now he's snapped.

806
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:37,876
I really feel sorry for the guy.

807
01:08:42,126 --> 01:08:44,459
Oh, if this keeps up...

808
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:48,542
...my Broly... will be killed...!

809
01:08:48,751 --> 01:08:52,292
Oh... it's all over...!

810
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:13,959
Well, well, it appears the great
Frieza-<i>Sama</i> may not get a chance.

811
01:10:23,126 --> 01:10:24,126
Son!

812
01:10:26,292 --> 01:10:27,917
What's happened?

813
01:10:28,126 --> 01:10:30,876
That isn't just Frieza's <i>Ki.</i>

814
01:10:31,084 --> 01:10:34,084
Yeah, you're right...

815
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:36,626
Sounds like you have your hands full.

816
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:41,167
You got that right.

817
01:10:41,376 --> 01:10:43,417
It's a tremendous <i>Ki.</i>

818
01:10:43,626 --> 01:10:47,417
Even if I went there,
I'd just be in the way.

819
01:10:47,626 --> 01:10:51,001
Just stand by there for me.

820
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:58,751
I-If things get out of hand, I'll use
Instantaneous Movement to head there.

821
01:11:06,584 --> 01:11:11,167
If you're saying something like that,
this must be some foe, all right.

822
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:15,292
Later.

823
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:14,334
P-Perhaps... what King Vegeta said...

824
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:16,751
...was true...

825
01:13:30,667 --> 01:13:34,459
Are you sure that he really has
nothing more this time?

826
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:36,084
Y-Yes, sir...

827
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:38,584
I see.

828
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,417
Shall we put that to the test?

829
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:53,917
Ahem.

830
01:13:54,126 --> 01:13:57,626
Broly-<i>san!</i> Look at this!

831
01:13:58,334 --> 01:14:00,001
Broly-<i>san!</i>

832
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:04,751
Your father has been killed!

833
01:14:57,042 --> 01:15:00,459
Yes! I succeeded!

834
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:48,501
Very nice.

835
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:51,626
That was the expression
I was waiting for.

836
01:15:53,417 --> 01:15:55,334
What are you dawdling around for?!

837
01:15:55,542 --> 01:15:56,584
Idiot!

838
01:16:00,042 --> 01:16:02,501
This is no time to insist on fighting
one-on-one, right?

839
01:16:02,709 --> 01:16:05,751
I hate to admit it,
but it looks like you're right.

840
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:22,001
Let's go, Vegeta!

841
01:16:23,876 --> 01:16:25,376
Damn it all!

842
01:16:25,584 --> 01:16:26,917
Gyallic Ho!

843
01:16:27,126 --> 01:16:28,542
Kamehame...

844
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:30,751
Hal!

845
01:16:42,334 --> 01:16:46,459
J-Just a moment! I am Frieza!

846
01:16:51,376 --> 01:16:53,334
Vegeta! Now! Over here!

847
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,001
Wh-What?!

848
01:16:58,584 --> 01:17:01,667
Hey, what in the world is going on?!

849
01:17:03,709 --> 01:17:05,001
Let go of me!

850
01:17:05,209 --> 01:17:07,417
Hurry! I'll explain later.

851
01:17:07,626 --> 01:17:09,667
Piccolo. Got any Senzu?

852
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:11,667
No, I don't.

853
01:17:14,792 --> 01:17:16,376
Hey, Vegeta,

854
01:17:16,584 --> 01:17:18,501
do you know the technique called Fusion?

855
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:23,917
Fusion? Yeah, now that you mention it,
Trunks said something about it.

856
01:17:24,126 --> 01:17:27,376
Hmm? That technique where you do
absurd moves and merge together?!

857
01:17:27,584 --> 01:17:30,417
Yeah, we're gonna do "Fu-sion"!

858
01:17:30,626 --> 01:17:31,876
Don't be ridiculous!

859
01:17:32,084 --> 01:17:34,792
As if I'd ever merge myself... with you!

860
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:37,209
It's just for 30 minutes!

861
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:40,251
We've joined together before with
the Potara earrings, didn't we?

862
01:17:40,459 --> 01:17:45,042
We ain't got Potaras here,
so Fusion is the only way to beat him!

863
01:17:45,251 --> 01:17:47,834
Even if we have no choice
but to merge together...

864
01:17:48,042 --> 01:17:51,542
...are you telling me to do these,
these, and these moves?!

865
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:56,209
It's the only way to win!
The earth could be done for!

866
01:17:56,417 --> 01:17:59,126
Hmph, then that's just fate.

867
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:04,251
You're okay with letting
your beloved Bulma die?

868
01:18:05,542 --> 01:18:09,751
Don't try to embarrass me into it! Tch!

869
01:18:09,959 --> 01:18:13,334
A-All right.
Hurry up and teach it to me!

870
01:18:30,834 --> 01:18:33,042
You dare to push me...

871
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:36,126
...to these lengths, do you?

872
01:18:36,334 --> 01:18:43,334
Then I will teach you a lesson
in the force of Golden Frieza!

873
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:46,209
Fu... sion!

874
01:18:46,417 --> 01:18:47,792
Ha!!

875
01:18:48,001 --> 01:18:50,709
What an embarrassing pose...!

876
01:18:50,917 --> 01:18:55,834
This is Fusion. We ain't got any time.
Come on, let's practice!

877
01:18:56,042 --> 01:18:58,209
What's wrong, Vegeta?

878
01:18:58,417 --> 01:19:01,209
I'd rather be dead...

879
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:05,584
Fu... sion!

880
01:19:05,792 --> 01:19:06,959
Ha!!

881
01:19:21,209 --> 01:19:24,376
Heh-heh, nobody's stronger than me now!

882
01:19:24,584 --> 01:19:26,542
No good! Your fingers didn't match up!

883
01:19:26,751 --> 01:19:29,501
Try it again in 30 minutes!

884
01:19:37,626 --> 01:19:39,292
Fu...

885
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:40,501
...sion!

886
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:41,876
Ha!!

887
01:19:46,876 --> 01:19:48,542
Absolutely wrong!

888
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:50,834
Your two angles were slightly off!

889
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:53,084
Another 30 minutes!

890
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:59,334
Fu...

891
01:19:59,542 --> 01:20:00,584
...sion!

892
01:20:00,792 --> 01:20:02,001
Ha!!

893
01:20:21,209 --> 01:20:25,792
Good! Now, get out there
and defeat him... uh...

894
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:27,709
...wh-what do I call you?

895
01:20:27,917 --> 01:20:28,584
Huh?

896
01:20:28,792 --> 01:20:31,751
Using Potaras,
it was "Vegetto," wasn't it?

897
01:20:31,959 --> 01:20:33,376
Okay then, um...

898
01:20:33,584 --> 01:20:35,542
Forget it! Hurry and go!

899
01:20:35,751 --> 01:20:40,126
I can't do that. Having a name
would sound cooler, to be sure.

900
01:20:40,334 --> 01:20:44,459
This time it'll be... um...

901
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:46,334
...Gogeta!

902
01:20:57,084 --> 01:20:58,292
Wonderful!

903
01:20:58,501 --> 01:21:01,459
What wonderful battle power!

904
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:05,417
Wh-Who are you?

905
01:21:05,626 --> 01:21:08,376
Hmph, I am Gogeta!

906
01:21:08,584 --> 01:21:11,626
Goku and Vegeta have merged together!

907
01:21:11,834 --> 01:21:12,917
Merged?

908
01:21:13,126 --> 01:21:16,959
You've been dead for a long time,
so you wouldn't know.

909
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:19,626
Their two strengths are not
just added together;

910
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:22,167
They're significantly greater.

911
01:21:22,376 --> 01:21:24,834
Th-That is not fair!

912
01:21:25,042 --> 01:21:28,501
You're a fine one to be saying that.

913
01:21:31,459 --> 01:21:32,459
Hoi!

914
01:21:33,751 --> 01:21:35,584
Over here!

915
01:21:38,334 --> 01:21:39,334
Oh, my.

916
01:21:39,501 --> 01:21:42,292
Whis-<i>san,</i> let me take it from here!

917
01:21:43,292 --> 01:21:46,751
You two can merge together, I see.

918
01:21:46,959 --> 01:21:49,751
Ah, it's that Fusion thing!

919
01:21:54,126 --> 01:21:55,126
Come on!

920
01:22:19,584 --> 01:22:22,584
Heh-heh-heh, now it's my turn!

921
01:23:33,209 --> 01:23:35,042
Ha!!

922
01:24:37,126 --> 01:24:40,459
Broly is going to be
finished at this rate!

923
01:24:40,667 --> 01:24:45,209
He's been turned into nothing but a
fighting machine, thanks to his father.

924
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:48,209
He isn't fighting because
he wants to fight!

925
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:52,584
Broly is actually a
pure, kindhearted Saiyan!

926
01:24:52,792 --> 01:24:54,959
We can't let him die!

927
01:26:09,709 --> 01:26:13,959
I shall grant thee any one wish.

928
01:26:14,167 --> 01:26:16,334
So, now what do we do?

929
01:26:16,542 --> 01:26:19,376
Hurry up and tell me!

930
01:26:19,584 --> 01:26:20,876
Forget it, I'm shooting.

931
01:26:21,084 --> 01:26:24,042
A-All right! I'll tell you!

932
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:28,251
"Just say the wish as-is."

933
01:26:28,459 --> 01:26:31,959
Oh, is that all?

934
01:26:34,001 --> 01:26:35,959
My wish is...

935
01:28:07,959 --> 01:28:10,209
Magnificent!

936
01:28:10,417 --> 01:28:14,751
This might bring this to a close.

937
01:28:19,334 --> 01:28:21,334
Ka...

938
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:23,709
...me...

939
01:28:23,917 --> 01:28:25,959
...ha...

940
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:29,167
...me...

941
01:28:31,042 --> 01:28:35,292
Ha!!

942
01:28:42,667 --> 01:28:43,876
Send Broly...

943
01:28:44,084 --> 01:28:48,417
...back to the planet
where he was before!!

944
01:29:09,834 --> 01:29:12,709
Your wish has been granted.

945
01:29:14,126 --> 01:29:16,001
Farewell!

946
01:29:33,126 --> 01:29:34,876
Get in, Cheelai!

947
01:29:47,959 --> 01:29:49,376
Whoa, there!

948
01:30:01,626 --> 01:30:03,792
I will be back, understand?

949
01:30:15,584 --> 01:30:19,042
Hmph, it looks like it
turned out all right.

950
01:30:25,126 --> 01:30:28,459
Sorry to get you mixed up in all that.

951
01:30:28,667 --> 01:30:32,542
Don't worry about it. That was the most
thrilling and enjoyable time I've had

952
01:30:32,751 --> 01:30:35,042
since I joined the Frieza force.

953
01:30:36,709 --> 01:30:39,001
Think they'll come after us?

954
01:30:39,209 --> 01:30:40,917
Who knows?

955
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:44,834
So, Cheelai,
where are you planning on going?

956
01:30:45,042 --> 01:30:46,626
To Broly's world.

957
01:30:46,834 --> 01:30:48,209
Vampa, huh?

958
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:51,292
What world should I let you off
on, Lemo?

959
01:30:51,501 --> 01:30:56,917
Nah, I'll tag along with you. The
risk is the same no matter where I go.

960
01:30:57,126 --> 01:31:01,542
Being near the mighty Broly
will put me at ease.

961
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:09,625
In that case, we'll have to stop along
the way to buy some food and stuff.

962
01:31:09,626 --> 01:31:14,416
"Three days later"

963
01:31:14,417 --> 01:31:14,917
Sure enough, it appears that
those two are together with Broly.

964
01:31:15,126 --> 01:31:18,209
Let us leave them alone for a while.

965
01:31:18,417 --> 01:31:21,876
We will allow them to bring
Broly's mind under control,

966
01:31:22,084 --> 01:31:25,001
and once he can release
that immense power

967
01:31:25,209 --> 01:31:26,834
without losing his sense of self,

968
01:31:27,042 --> 01:31:30,626
that is when he will become
the mightiest combatant.

969
01:31:30,834 --> 01:31:33,959
Do you think that will work?

970
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:37,251
I certainly hope that it does.

971
01:31:38,417 --> 01:31:42,584
No matter how hard I try
to raise my battle power,

972
01:31:42,792 --> 01:31:45,959
my foes are still both
Son Goku and Vegeta.

973
01:31:47,709 --> 01:31:52,626
I would like to have one other, as well.

974
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:57,876
"Planetoid Vampa"

975
01:32:11,501 --> 01:32:15,917
You're kidding, right?
<i>This</i> is what you've been eating?

976
01:32:16,126 --> 01:32:21,334
W-Well, it's bitter, but it's better
than starving to death... I guess.

977
01:32:24,334 --> 01:32:26,876
Bleh! C-Count me out.

978
01:32:27,084 --> 01:32:28,667
Don't ask for too much.

979
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:32,709
We won't last even 50 days
on just the food we bought.

980
01:32:35,042 --> 01:32:36,084
Somebody's here.

981
01:32:36,292 --> 01:32:37,459
Huh?

982
01:32:37,667 --> 01:32:39,917
Hey, can I come in?

983
01:32:43,542 --> 01:32:46,292
Huh? Who are you guys?

984
01:32:46,501 --> 01:32:49,292
Y-You! You're the Saiyan from earth!

985
01:32:49,876 --> 01:32:54,209
Oh, right! You're the ones from the
Frieza force who used the Dragon Balls!

986
01:32:54,417 --> 01:32:57,292
What are you doing here?

987
01:32:58,834 --> 01:33:00,667
You guys are Broly's friends?

988
01:33:00,876 --> 01:33:03,001
I asked you what you were doing here!

989
01:33:03,209 --> 01:33:05,084
Now, don't lose your temper.

990
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:07,834
I ain't here to fight, okay?

991
01:33:08,042 --> 01:33:09,251
Then, why are you here?

992
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:14,292
I heard your world was awful,
so I brought you some stuff.

993
01:33:14,501 --> 01:33:19,001
Who asked you to? Go away.
You can't trick us.

994
01:33:22,376 --> 01:33:26,251
I asked someone named Bulma,
and got this for you.

995
01:33:27,709 --> 01:33:29,834
Could you stand back?

996
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:39,876
There's food and water and a bunch
of other stuff inside the house.

997
01:33:43,334 --> 01:33:45,626
Also, these are called Senzu beans.

998
01:33:45,834 --> 01:33:46,959
I'm giving you two of them.

999
01:33:47,167 --> 01:33:50,292
Eat one whenever you think,
"Yikes, I'm gonna die!"

1000
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:53,667
They don't work against illnesses,
but they completely heal injuries,

1001
01:33:53,876 --> 01:33:56,376
and restore your strength to full, too.

1002
01:33:56,584 --> 01:33:58,334
What are you plotting?

1003
01:33:58,542 --> 01:34:02,542
It ain't like that. I just want
you to live healthy.

1004
01:34:02,751 --> 01:34:03,751
...Huh?
...Huh?

1005
01:34:03,917 --> 01:34:06,751
I was so sure of my own strength,

1006
01:34:06,959 --> 01:34:10,792
but then the much
stronger Broly showed up.

1007
01:34:11,001 --> 01:34:13,042
And what's more, he's a Saiyan,
too, just like me.

1008
01:34:13,251 --> 01:34:15,792
He's probably even stronger
than Beerus-<i>Sama</i>.

1009
01:34:16,001 --> 01:34:18,792
Beerus-<i>Sama</i> is this god, you see.

1010
01:34:19,001 --> 01:34:20,084
Goodness.

1011
01:34:20,292 --> 01:34:24,459
Anyways, it would be a shame
to let someone so incredible...

1012
01:34:24,667 --> 01:34:26,584
...up and die, right?

1013
01:34:32,376 --> 01:34:36,292
Well, whatever.
Just take care of yourselves.

1014
01:34:36,501 --> 01:34:37,209
Bye.

1015
01:34:37,417 --> 01:34:39,751
Huh? There's no ship.

1016
01:34:39,959 --> 01:34:42,084
How did you get here?

1017
01:34:42,292 --> 01:34:46,334
I can do Instantaneous Movement.
I just searched for Broly's <i>Ki</i>.

1018
01:34:46,542 --> 01:34:50,126
I really don't get
anything you're telling us.

1019
01:34:50,334 --> 01:34:51,751
Is it okay if I come again?

1020
01:34:51,959 --> 01:34:55,667
Just so you know,
you're our enemy, understand?

1021
01:34:55,876 --> 01:34:58,042
We may be out of the Frieza force,

1022
01:34:58,251 --> 01:35:01,251
but we're not becoming friends with you.

1023
01:35:01,459 --> 01:35:03,834
Doesn't matter to me either way.

1024
01:35:04,042 --> 01:35:04,834
Huh?

1025
01:35:05,042 --> 01:35:09,001
I just want you to let me
come fight Broly once in a while.

1026
01:35:09,209 --> 01:35:10,376
...Huh?
...Huh?

1027
01:35:10,584 --> 01:35:14,251
There's some stuff I'd
like to teach him, too.

1028
01:35:15,167 --> 01:35:18,209
You sure do seem to be pretty crazy.

1029
01:35:18,417 --> 01:35:19,417
How come?

1030
01:35:19,626 --> 01:35:24,459
Well, anyway, I should offer
my gratitude. Thank you.

1031
01:35:24,667 --> 01:35:27,501
Yeah. Bye now. I'll be back again.

1032
01:35:27,709 --> 01:35:30,417
We may not be here when you do.

1033
01:35:30,626 --> 01:35:35,084
That's okay. As long as you ain't
too far away, I can find you.

1034
01:35:37,292 --> 01:35:40,167
What's your name?

1035
01:35:42,917 --> 01:35:47,292
Son Goku. Also...

1036
01:35:47,501 --> 01:35:49,209
...Kakarot.

1036
01:35:50,305 --> 01:36:50,722
