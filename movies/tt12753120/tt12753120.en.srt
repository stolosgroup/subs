3
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:40,779
I started working
in the North Sea at 18.

4
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:43,173
That was back in... 1971.

5
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:45,480
A long time ago.

6
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:50,833
The oil business paid well.

7
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,489
So I started working
two weeks on, four weeks off.

8
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:03,063
We had no idea what
we were getting involved in.

9
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,977
Zero training.

10
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,111
Just follow the Americans.

11
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,071
If they said go left,
we went left.

12
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,292
I remember
it was dangerous back then.

13
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:20,993
But it was a risk
we were willing to take.

14
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:27,783
Or, more precisely,
we didn't think much about it.

15
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,701
Everyone made money.

16
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,921
The entire country made money.

17
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,186
But...

18
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:41,579
it's like driving a car.

19
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,496
Drive too fast for too long
and it will never end well.

20
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:51,241
"A risk
of undesirable incidents",

21
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:54,288
we call it in the oil business.

22
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:22,968
THE BURNING SEA

23
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:03,357
Good morning.

24
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,055
- Hi.
- Hi.

25
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:08,840
Good morning, Odin.

26
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:10,538
- Good morning.
- Sleep well?

27
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,453
- Mm-hmm.
- Coffee in the thermos.

28
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:15,195
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

29
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:19,808
- Done!
- Are you done?

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,766
Yeah. Where is it?

31
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,420
I don't know.
Go look for it.

32
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,684
I'm in no mood
for a treasure hunt.

33
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:29,034
Check in the basement.

34
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,167
- Okay?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:32,516
Where is what?

36
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:34,605
A radio-controlled car.

37
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:41,395
What?

38
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,443
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

39
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:50,752
- Eggs?
- Sure.

40
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,387
There's no way you can do it

41
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:20,129
- in less than 30 seconds.
- If I fail,

42
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:24,046
you get to control the music
in the car for a month.

43
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:25,917
Deal.

44
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,702
No, shit.
A week. A week!

45
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:29,269
- Two weeks.
- One!

46
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:31,619
I can't handle
that much Kvelertak.

47
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,361
- Fine, two weeks.
- Yes!

48
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:39,148
EELUME OFFSHORE ROBOTICS
TEST POOL FOR UNDERWATER ROBOTS

49
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:43,283
- Ready?
- Yes.

50
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:46,764
Three, two, one... go!

51
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:56,208
Five seconds.

52
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,263
Ten.

53
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:14,836
Check!

54
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,580
- Twenty.
- Halfway.

55
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,764
- Shit!
- Twenty-eight...

56
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:33,724
- Dammit!
- ...twenty-nine, 30.

57
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:47,608
What do you think about
a manual reset at 1000 meters?

58
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,263
- Raise it up.
- You give up?

59
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,570
I'm not giving up.
I'll do it next time.

60
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:58,923
Bye!

61
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:01,361
- Bye.
- See you later.

62
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:10,587
- Who's coming to the cookout?
- Oil people.

63
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:12,807
Nice people.

64
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,287
- Okay.
- It'll be fun.

65
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,899
What's in this bag?

66
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,770
- Why is it so heavy?
- It isn't heavy.

67
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:22,512
It weighs at least 15 kilos.

68
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,297
You have gamer arms.
No muscles.

69
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,299
Why don't you just move in?

70
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,084
I'm not moving in with him.

71
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:31,303
You've been dating him
for a year.

72
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,783
Nine months.

73
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:38,093
Many people move in
after nine months.

74
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,965
- Well, I don't.
- You're going to move in

75
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:43,185
and buy a station wagon,

76
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:46,014
and I'll be stuck alone
at the office.

77
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:48,538
- Never gonna happen.
- You'll need room

78
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:51,193
for skis and bags.

79
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:55,284
I have my life,
he has his. Works like a charm.

80
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:02,944
- Hey there!
- Hi, Oddvar.

81
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,294
- On a diet?
- Yes.

82
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,433
Don't leave me standing alone.

83
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,744
- Want me to take that?
- Here.

84
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:26,315
Hi, Arthur. Hi, hi.

85
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,102
- Ski jumping is my hobby.
- Watchingski jumping, Ronny.

86
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:33,148
Sure, but still...

87
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,892
Hi, Odin, does your auntie
get a hug? Please?

88
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:40,764
Come on, give Aunt Vibeke a hug.

89
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:43,854
- Hi.
- Hi.

90
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,858
Check this out.

91
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,078
I'm fetching more beer.

92
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:00,828
- Hi.
- Hi.

93
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:10,794
Of course.

94
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:13,144
Who sent you two for beer?

95
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:15,756
Carry on.
I'll take care of it.

96
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:17,932
There.

97
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:19,586
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

98
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:26,549
Come on, we're guarding you!

99
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:28,856
No!

100
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:32,990
Pass it! Move!

101
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:42,565
Good night, Odin!

102
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:43,827
Bedtime.

103
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:48,789
Go, Arthur!

104
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:21,343
If it isn't the skinny-dipper!

105
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:25,477
- Oh, no...
- You look like hell.

106
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:30,526
- I feel horrible. Don't you?
- Not really.

107
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:33,616
Stian made me breakfast.
Eggs and bacon and...

108
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:37,402
Want this?

109
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:40,231
Oh, thank you!

110
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:42,364
This bag isn't so bad
after all, huh?

111
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:49,545
Got a Coke and a Whopper Cheese
in there too?

112
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:51,547
Hello.

113
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,203
No, we're at work.

114
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:01,165
What?

115
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:07,694
Yes, but...

116
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,304
We'll be right there.

117
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,702
That was Saga.
There's been an accident.

118
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:18,574
They want us
at the heliport now.

119
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:21,185
What kind of accident?

120
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,379
Grab the other bag.

121
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:46,384
SOLA AIR STATION
MAIN BASE FOR RESCUE HELICOPTERS

122
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,790
- Is that everything?
- Yes.

123
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:04,489
- Hi.
- Hi.

124
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,406
- My name is William Lie.
- Sofia Hartman.

125
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:12,062
Sofia Hartman. Yes.
I'm the emergency manager. Hi.

126
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:13,498
- Hi.
- William Lie.

127
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,370
- Arthur.
- Arthur. Hi.

128
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,851
What's happened?

129
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,983
Before anything,
I need you to sign this.

130
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:25,119
- Nondisclosure.
- A confidentiality agreement.

131
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:30,559
And time is of the essence.

132
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:37,131
Thank you.

133
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:39,481
You didn't answer me.

134
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:43,441
- What is our mission?
- The ship is waiting.

135
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,313
I'll contact you
once you arrive.

136
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,576
We have a representative
on board.

137
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:20,130
M/S NORMAND MAXIMUS
SUBSEA SUPPLY SHIP

138
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:34,362
ORMEN LANGE FIELD
PHASE 2 - UNDER DEVELOPMENT

139
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:22,453
SAGA CONTROL ROOM

140
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:25,195
REMOTE CONTROL AND MONITORING
OF OIL INSTALLATIONS

141
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:30,505
Have they arrived?

142
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,637
Yes. They are in position
and ready.

143
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:35,031
Do we have a connection?

144
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,773
- Coming up on the screens now.
- Yeah. Yeah.

145
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,820
Jasin, can you give us audio?

146
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:51,743
- Hi. We're set on deck.
- Hi.

147
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,876
- Hi.
- They're in position.

148
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,970
Sofia, this is Berit.

149
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:03,277
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.

150
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:05,670
I have William Lie here.

151
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:11,676
Listen up.
A platform has gone down.

152
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:17,465
Most likely due to a local
subsidence of the sea floor.

153
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:20,424
Wasn't Ekofisk only
a few inches a year?

154
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:24,472
But this time the subsidence

155
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,778
occurred right under
a platform leg.

156
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:30,695
Did you get the schematics
we sent?

157
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,048
- Affirmative.
- Good.

158
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,441
Can you use them to navigate?

159
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:39,226
Depends what we're looking for.

160
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:42,664
We're looking
for missing persons.

161
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,495
Since it went down so fast,

162
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:49,018
we expect air pockets.

163
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,368
We need to find out
if anyone is alive.

164
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:57,809
- So, we're looking for people?
- Correct.

165
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:02,162
We want your robot
to make its way inside

166
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:03,990
and search for survivors.

167
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:10,910
- We'll try.
- Thank you.

168
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:25,663
Operating room to crane.
Prepare for release.

169
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:27,317
Copy that.

170
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:36,892
Online.

171
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,115
- Ready?
- Yes.

172
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:45,422
Release in three, two, one...

173
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,192
- Can you start recording?
- Already on.

174
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:31,903
Heading 45.

175
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,069
Trying to find a way in here.

176
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:12,770
We're at four and 45 degrees.
And 120.

177
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:14,424
I'm following those pipes.

178
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:23,999
- Do you see an opening?
- Yeah.

179
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,741
There should be a shaft
to starboard.

180
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:45,368
Seventy-five meters.

181
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,125
I see a door.

182
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:07,999
Can you open it?

183
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:09,827
Let's try.

184
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:13,875
We can try.

185
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:03,968
- Jasin, can you ID him?
- On it.

186
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,537
Transmitting now.

187
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,757
Continuing inside.

188
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,851
- Now what?
- Steady...

189
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:06,640
Two seconds.

190
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,521
We have another body.

191
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,020
Hear that?

192
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,109
- Do you?
- I hear it.

193
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:02,826
He's alive. Report that we have
a person alive in an air pocket.

194
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,220
Operations to Control.

195
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:09,268
Do you see what we see?
A person in an air pocket.

196
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:24,326
Berit.

197
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,850
Jasin, contact the standby boat.

198
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:30,811
- What do they want us to do?
- Control to Operations.

199
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,421
Hello?

200
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:35,685
Help. Help!

201
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:37,252
Hello?

202
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:38,732
I'm alive!

203
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:43,171
Get me out of here! Help!

204
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:45,869
- What's that?
- What should we do?

205
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:48,045
We have sonar interference.

206
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,005
What is that?

207
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,838
What's that sound?

208
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,978
Is that a leak?

209
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,240
Berit?

210
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:12,983
We've shut off all the valves.
It isn't from us.

211
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:17,161
Help!

212
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:18,641
What is this?

213
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:24,517
Turn off the audio!

214
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,520
Get me out of here...

215
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,405
- The rig is leaking gas!
- Huh?

216
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,625
- Get Eelie out of there!
- Sofia?

217
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,891
What do I do with him?!

218
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:15,176
The rig is leaking gas!
We have to get out of here!

219
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:22,052
Hurry, we have to...

220
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:47,513
Eight deaths
have been confirmed so far.

221
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:50,907
Our thoughts
go to the next of kin.

222
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,736
The rescue operation
will continue.

223
00:23:53,997 --> 00:24:00,264
And we promise to come back
later with more information.

224
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:04,573
That was Oil and Energy
Minister Steinar Skagemo...

225
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:06,880
Where are you?

226
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,969
In some hallway
on the sixth floor.

227
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,188
Hi.

228
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:19,849
Hi.

229
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,985
- Hi.
- Oh, my God!

230
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,814
- Are you okay?
- Mm?

231
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:38,477
Christ. What happened?

232
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:41,175
- Look at you.
- I'm okay.

233
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:50,489
Let's...

234
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:54,797
- Oh, my...
- Hey.

235
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,850
What happened?

236
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,552
- Hmm?
- It was just so horrible.

237
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:18,778
- So...
- Hmm.

238
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,437
Can I stay with you
for a few days?

239
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,571
Of course.

240
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,792
I don't want to be alone.

241
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:34,794
You can stay with me
as long as you want.

242
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:41,148
Huh?

243
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:47,589
Let's go home. Okay?

244
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,787
- We ran a simulation.
- Uh-huh.

245
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:19,621
The rig went down
in two minutes and 47 seconds.

246
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,761
There's no way that
could have been a subsidence.

247
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:31,459
Christ!

248
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,367
No one else
could take my shift.

249
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:54,629
It's okay.

250
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:02,202
I have the mini version
of you here.

251
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,552
Yeah, that you do.

252
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:14,301
- Know what?
- Mm?

253
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,608
- I love you.
- I love you too.

254
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:23,832
- Okay.
- Okay.

255
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:26,313
Odin?

256
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:29,403
I'm leaving.
Want to say bye?

257
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:37,498
- Can Daddy get a hug?
- Yeah.

258
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,239
Bye.

259
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:45,071
- Bye.
- Have a nice trip.

260
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:46,202
Thanks.

261
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,118
Want to go in and fix that car?

262
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:50,337
- Yeah.
- Yes!

263
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:53,862
This will be fun!

264
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:57,300
See that little screw? Here?

265
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,694
Try tightening it.

266
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:11,488
- Hi, Arthur.
- Hi.

267
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:14,840
- You need to get out here.
- Okay. What's up?

268
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:21,542
GULLFAKS A
220 KM FROM THE COAST

269
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:41,214
- Hi there.
- Hi.

270
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:44,521
- Reading glasses?
- Shut up.

271
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,264
How is Sofia doing?

272
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:50,223
- Is she okay?
- She'll be fine.

273
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:53,226
There was talk
of a gas explosion?

274
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:55,489
Yeah. A leak from a well.

275
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:58,057
One well?

276
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,234
That's what they say, so...

277
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:05,107
I don't know.
But she'll be fine.

278
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:08,284
- She's tough.
- Good.

279
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:11,244
- How's the mood here?
- There's some talk.

280
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:15,770
People are a little shaky,
but everything's fine.

281
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:17,946
Of course.

282
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:20,296
Good.

283
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:23,212
I'd better make my rounds.

284
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:24,648
Okay.

285
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,741
What is it with you?

286
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:35,050
- What is it?
- Nothing.

287
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:36,443
Stop it.

288
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,053
Looking forward to my rounds.

289
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:41,056
Hey! What is it?

290
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:44,843
Huh?

291
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,281
Sofia and I have been talking.

292
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:52,633
She's moving in
with me and Odin.

293
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:55,505
- Seriously? That's great.
- Yeah.

294
00:30:56,202 --> 00:30:57,681
- Yeah.
- You deserve it.

295
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,249
A new start.

296
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:03,862
Yes, it is a new start.

297
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:14,655
I have a recording
from after the explosion.

298
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:19,486
This is from the camera
in front. What we saw.

299
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:22,271
But... if I switch
to the rear camera...

300
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:30,062
Huh? Rewind.

301
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:38,722
No way that's a leak
from a well.

302
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:43,292
Christ, it just keeps going!

303
00:31:57,828 --> 00:31:59,178
- We'll wait here.
- Yeah.

304
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,803
Excuse me. Lie?

305
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:18,501
It's okay.

306
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,376
- Hi.
- Hi.

307
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,335
I haven't had a break
in 12 hours.

308
00:32:26,553 --> 00:32:28,642
- Can we talk while I eat?
- Yeah.

309
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:41,002
That isn't a leak from a well.

310
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,051
Migrating gas isn't uncommon
in the North Sea.

311
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,749
But the entire area exploded.

312
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:52,318
That much gas
at the same time?

313
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,363
Something has to be
seriously wrong.

314
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,889
And there's no way
that can be subsidence.

315
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,073
Maybe we should leave that
to the specialists.

316
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:12,077
May I borrow that?

317
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:15,558
Sure.

318
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:19,823
Thank you.

319
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:25,742
Are you leaving?

320
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,659
There are thousands
of workers out there.

321
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,400
They have a right
to know what's going on!

322
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,538
You have to say something.

323
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:42,977
Remember that you signed
a nondisclosure agreement.

324
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:55,598
What did they say?

325
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,689
I'm not sure.

326
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,605
- Did you show them the clip?
- I showed it to William Lie.

327
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:06,566
- And what did he say?
- He didn't say much.

328
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,264
He took the hard drive and left.

329
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:12,746
Okay? That's good.

330
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:16,271
They'll look at it
and figure out what to do.

331
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:20,145
Hmm.

332
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:42,950
- How is the pressure?
- Up and down, but good now.

333
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,735
There was some
differential sticking,

334
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:49,565
and we may have a dogleg,
but it seems to be okay.

335
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:08,410
SAGA STAVANGER HEADQUARTERS
FOR OFFSHORE OPERATIONS

336
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:10,673
Hi, Gunn.

337
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:24,470
Oil and Energy Minister
Skagemo is here.

338
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:26,950
Steinar Skagemo.

339
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:34,828
Thank you for coming
at such short notice.

340
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:38,571
We have had
a dramatic development

341
00:35:38,745 --> 00:35:40,442
over the last 48 hours.

342
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:41,791
William.

343
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:47,406
The number of fractures
and slides have increased.

344
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:51,932
The platform that went down
has been inspected.

345
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:55,936
And today we received
video footage of a fracture

346
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,157
larger than anything
we have previously seen.

347
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:03,030
Much larger.

348
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:05,032
If you look here.

349
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,428
If this is the center
of the fracture,

350
00:36:09,732 --> 00:36:12,692
where expansion is the largest,

351
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:16,174
we're talking about a rift
several kilometers long.

352
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:19,089
Possibly tens of kilometers.

353
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:23,006
Which means?
Where did this rift come from?

354
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:25,792
Oddvar?

355
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:33,843
Here are the platforms
in the North Sea.

356
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:37,107
Here is Storegga.

357
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,110
Eight-thousand years ago,

358
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:41,895
the Storegga Slide
occurred here.

359
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:45,203
Five-thousand cubic kilometers
of mud, stone

360
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,769
and sand dislodged.

361
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:51,339
The slides
we have registered now

362
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:53,385
are in a direct line
with Storegga.

363
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:55,822
And?

364
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,304
At first we thought
it was a local subsidence.

365
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:04,961
But not anymore.
If you look at this video...

366
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:22,718
What are we looking at?

367
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,895
Part of a larger slide.

368
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:29,247
If you look closely,
the seabed disappears.

369
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:34,643
The Storegga Slide.

370
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,343
It has started moving again.

371
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:41,084
How big?

372
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:43,435
Exactly how big
is difficult to say.

373
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,699
But it could be bigger

374
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:49,571
than anything registered
in modern times.

375
00:37:53,923 --> 00:37:55,708
In an area full of platforms?

376
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:58,058
And people. Yes.

377
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:02,584
- Why is this happening now?
- We don't know.

378
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:04,804
There may be many factors.

379
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:07,676
It could be climate change,
there could be other causes.

380
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:12,899
It may even be
that we set it off ourselves.

381
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,423
What do you mean?

382
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:18,426
We've drilled thousands
of wells out there.

383
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,647
We've drained massive oil
and gas reserves

384
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:23,170
under the ocean floor.

385
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:26,565
Turned it into Swiss cheese.

386
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:30,133
Let's get back
to this situation.

387
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,832
Good idea.
What do you suggest?

388
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:37,793
Shut down all operations
in the area.

389
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:42,363
Secure and close down all wells.
Until we know more.

390
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,209
If we don't shut down the wells,

391
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:04,646
what might happen?

392
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:07,040
Look here, Skagemo.

393
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:11,958
This is the casing.
A type of holster.

394
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:17,355
It is anchored to the seabed.
The drill goes in there.

395
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:20,662
If the rig collapses

396
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:24,013
and pulls the drill
out like this...

397
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,364
the oil will flow freely.

398
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:32,195
How large of a spill
might we be talking?

399
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:37,157
- Remember Deepwater Horizon?
- Yes.

400
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:40,334
That spill was the size
of Denmark.

401
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:42,728
From one well.
Here we have 350.

402
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:10,103
We are faced
with an enormous task.

403
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:13,193
No one's experienced
this before.

404
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:14,847
No one has rehearsed for this.

405
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:18,067
The Joint Rescue
Coordination Center

406
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:19,808
will handle the evacuation.

407
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,507
Our task is to secure
and close down

408
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:24,030
half the North Sea.

409
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:30,166
In order to succeed...

410
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,649
to close down every well,

411
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,913
and to secure
every installation,

412
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:39,828
we all have to do our utmost.

413
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:44,616
We're short on time,
but we cannot panic.

414
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:46,748
Security is priority
number one.

415
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:51,318
Every platform on the red list

416
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:53,929
is to be secured and shut down.

417
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:59,108
I know as much as you do.
Many people are evacuating.

418
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:02,460
Renate, can you check that?

419
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:08,204
I know as much as you do.

420
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:10,903
We'll just take it
nice and easy.

421
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:15,516
Who owns that belt?
Put it in one of the boxes.

422
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:22,567
Which ones are left?

423
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:26,179
Status on Statfjord A?

424
00:41:27,136 --> 00:41:28,877
Shutting down Statfjord A now.

425
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:31,576
Excellent.

426
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:37,233
Okay.

427
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,846
Good. And Oseberg?

428
00:41:41,194 --> 00:41:44,197
Oseberg A and D are secured.

429
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:46,286
B is almost ready.

430
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:51,160
All crews are being shuttled
to Normand Vision.

431
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:53,119
Get ready, Group A.

432
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:54,903
- Kjell Are Heiland.
- Yes.

433
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:56,252
- Terje Hamar.
- Here.

434
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:57,906
- Henning Sirnes.
- Yes.

435
00:41:58,124 --> 00:41:59,865
- And Eva Fjoørtoft.
- Yes.

436
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:02,737
Good. Follow Renate up on deck.
Off you go.

437
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:04,957
- Follow me.
- Excellent.

438
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:07,220
Find out who it is,
and send it to me.

439
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:33,246
Is the valve on Troll A fixed?

440
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,423
Troll A? It's green.
Troll is closed.

441
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:40,775
Continue down the list.

442
00:42:41,297 --> 00:42:43,343
The entire
Statfjord field is green.

443
00:42:43,996 --> 00:42:45,040
Keep it up.

444
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:13,939
And now for some breaking news.

445
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:17,812
Unconfirmed sources say
a large-scale evacuation

446
00:43:17,899 --> 00:43:20,685
of oil platforms is underway.

447
00:43:20,772 --> 00:43:24,950
The oil industry has yet
to confirm this publicly.

448
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:28,736
Let's go live to the Joint
Rescue Coordination Center

449
00:43:28,823 --> 00:43:31,130
where there is hectic activity.

450
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:33,175
All emergency services,

451
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:38,441
including ambulance, police
and fire, are at the ready.

452
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:42,402
So far,
we can ascertain that...

453
00:43:43,142 --> 00:43:46,188
STIAN: DON'T WORRY!
WE'RE BEING EVACUATED.

454
00:43:46,449 --> 00:43:50,018
...cooperation among the
agencies has been satisfactory.

455
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,326
Of course, this operation

456
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,373
is on an unprecedented scale,
but so far...

457
00:43:58,374 --> 00:44:01,029
I'm getting an error message
from a well on Gullfaks A.

458
00:44:02,248 --> 00:44:04,424
Maybe it's a little slow?

459
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,818
Something's wrong
with the connection.

460
00:44:08,515 --> 00:44:10,256
Call the platform chief.

461
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:12,911
- It's Helseth, right?
- Yep.

462
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:16,654
Okay, our turn. Group F.
We get to turn the lights out.

463
00:44:17,524 --> 00:44:20,309
Ready?

464
00:44:21,397 --> 00:44:22,398
Ronny Helseth.

465
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,664
Seriously? We're in the middle
of an evacuation.

466
00:44:33,148 --> 00:44:34,584
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

467
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:38,980
They can't contact Well 4.

468
00:44:39,198 --> 00:44:40,852
They can't close it from HQ.

469
00:44:43,811 --> 00:44:47,597
We can't leave until
all the wells are secured.

470
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:50,252
That's why they want me to go
down and close it manually.

471
00:44:50,775 --> 00:44:52,124
Mm.

472
00:44:53,168 --> 00:44:54,561
You have to keep an eye
on things here.

473
00:44:57,477 --> 00:44:58,565
I'll go down.

474
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:02,134
I'll go down the D shaft
and fix it.

475
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:05,050
Okay. But hurry.

476
00:45:06,486 --> 00:45:08,053
- Hold the bus for me.
- Yeah, yeah.

477
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:55,100
The evacuation
began around 4:30 pm.

478
00:45:55,404 --> 00:45:57,537
Around 150 individuals.

479
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:59,931
It went without a hitch...

480
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,152
The subscriber
cannot be reached.

481
00:46:06,459 --> 00:46:09,375
- Status on Gjoøa?
- Working on the last wells now.

482
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:11,943
Okay. How about
that valve on Gullfaks?

483
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,294
It takes time to get down there.

484
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:29,395
- Stian, the bus has arrived.
- Roger that.

485
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:30,962
Almost down.

486
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:34,835
D SHAFT, GULLFAKS A
138 METERS UNDER THE SEA

487
00:47:24,232 --> 00:47:25,625
What the hell?

488
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,932
Shit!

489
00:47:28,976 --> 00:47:30,064
We lost contact.

490
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,459
- With who?
- The entire platform.

491
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:43,382
Not just that one.

492
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:46,689
Not just that one!

493
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:48,561
Are... are yours also down?

494
00:47:55,568 --> 00:47:58,919
- Stian, it's time. Let's go.
- Roger that.

495
00:47:59,224 --> 00:48:00,660
Closing the valve now.

496
00:49:04,854 --> 00:49:06,813
Come on, get in! Get in!

497
00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:25,266
Stian, get up here!

498
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:26,876
Come on!

499
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:29,749
Come on! Get in!

500
00:49:46,505 --> 00:49:47,897
Come on, come on!

501
00:50:29,722 --> 00:50:31,245
You have
reached Berit Djuphagen.

502
00:50:31,506 --> 00:50:34,901
Please leave a message.

503
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,905
Berit, it's Sofia Hartman.
I've been trying to call you.

504
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:41,386
Um, I'm on my way to you now.

505
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:43,344
I'll let you know
when I'm there.

506
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:53,311
We're here
to see Berit Djuphagen.

507
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:55,182
- You have an appointment?
- Yes.

508
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,971
We can talk in here.

509
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,286
- Odin, go sit over there.
- Yeah.

510
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,945
I can't reach Stian.

511
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:21,426
- He isn't answering.
- Sofia...

512
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,348
we couldn't close all the wells
on Gullfaks A remotely, so...

513
00:51:31,697 --> 00:51:33,699
Stian was sent down
to do it manually.

514
00:51:36,267 --> 00:51:37,485
I just talked to Ronny.

515
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:42,316
And...
they didn't have time to...

516
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:45,667
Stian was never evacuated.

517
00:51:47,278 --> 00:51:50,455
He texted me.
He said he was being evacuated.

518
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,762
Over 30 platforms
just collapsed.

519
00:51:54,894 --> 00:51:57,984
Gullfaks was one of the first
to be hit. A leg was ripped off.

520
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:01,030
And Stian was down there.

521
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,691
Find out which lifeboats
are still out there.

522
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:13,565
Stian Birkeland
is still on Gullfaks A.

523
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:16,220
You have to send someone
out to get him.

524
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:22,051
That is Gullfaks A.
Status red.

525
00:52:22,313 --> 00:52:24,793
It has lost one of its legs.

526
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:28,406
It can collapse and sink
at any moment. I'm sorry.

527
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:30,103
You sent him down there.

528
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:33,193
It's your responsibility
to get him out.

529
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,154
I'm afraid
I must ask you to leave.

530
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:39,765
No.

531
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:42,550
No!

532
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,946
I'm not going anywhere
until you rescue him!

533
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:50,602
I can't send a rescue team
out there now.

534
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:54,519
- We have to prioritize.
- There's a little boy out there

535
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:56,129
who's going to lose his father!

536
00:52:58,262 --> 00:52:59,567
Call security.

537
00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:01,439
Aren't you going
to do anything?

538
00:53:02,962 --> 00:53:06,531
No? Then you go tell
that little boy

539
00:53:06,618 --> 00:53:09,011
that no one intends to do
anything to save his father.

540
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,146
I'm not doing it.

541
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:16,628
Sofia.

542
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:26,464
No.

543
00:53:28,727 --> 00:53:30,163
Where is that link I asked for?

544
00:53:44,395 --> 00:53:46,223
Has something happened to Dad?

545
00:53:52,925 --> 00:53:54,709
Yes.

546
00:53:57,799 --> 00:53:58,887
Sort of.

547
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:17,906
Can you wait here?

548
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:19,995
Yeah.

549
00:54:20,213 --> 00:54:21,432
I'll be right back.

550
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:25,871
You have cameras everywhere
on the platforms.

551
00:54:28,395 --> 00:54:31,093
- Yes, in most rooms.
- Show me those images.

552
00:54:31,877 --> 00:54:33,226
- Sofia...
- I need to see them.

553
00:54:34,445 --> 00:54:35,446
Now!

554
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,640
We don't have cameras
in all the mechanical rooms.

555
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,729
Let me fast-forward.

556
00:55:18,445 --> 00:55:19,577
No!

557
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:21,535
Sofia...

558
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:32,372
But he wrote
that he was being evacuated.

559
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:41,773
Berit?

560
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,167
Look at this.

561
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:49,302
Huh?

562
00:55:50,085 --> 00:55:53,611
A hatch into a service chute
has been opened.

563
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:56,091
What does that mean?

564
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:02,707
Most likely it was ripped open
when the platform was hit.

565
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:08,452
Could Stian have opened it?

566
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:11,672
It's highly unlikely that he...

567
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:16,721
Watch Odin for me.

568
00:56:19,114 --> 00:56:20,072
Sofia?

569
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:25,425
Hi, Vibeke, it's Sofia.

570
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:27,166
I need your help.

571
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:57,196
- I only need the mini.
- Okay.

572
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,071
Where do you think he is?

573
00:57:03,245 --> 00:57:06,074
There are pipes
between the legs.

574
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:08,250
Seriously, Sofia...

575
00:57:08,947 --> 00:57:10,427
is this even legal?

576
00:57:13,255 --> 00:57:15,432
- You both have suits?
- I'm going alone.

577
00:57:15,475 --> 00:57:17,825
Okay. Officially,
we're on a different mission.

578
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:20,219
Sofia?

579
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:23,135
What choice do I have?

580
00:57:23,265 --> 00:57:25,006
Well, you sure
aren't going alone.

581
00:58:11,313 --> 00:58:13,751
Over there is Gullfaks A.

582
00:58:15,056 --> 00:58:17,711
The deck is gone,
so we'll have to lower you down.

583
00:58:20,148 --> 00:58:22,020
I'll go first,
then the equipment,

584
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:24,326
then I'll help you down.

585
00:58:25,153 --> 00:58:28,505
Arthur, it'll be okay.
Just don't look down.

586
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,942
Get ready,
and get out quick

587
00:58:31,029 --> 00:58:32,813
- when I give the signal.
- Yeah!

588
00:58:33,248 --> 00:58:35,512
We have to get
out of here fast.

589
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:38,166
Just find Stian, okay?

590
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:39,994
Find my brother.

591
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:42,736
Arthur, don't worry.

592
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:03,251
- Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm okay.

593
01:00:24,403 --> 01:00:25,491
Okay?

594
01:00:32,454 --> 01:00:33,542
Here.

595
01:00:38,156 --> 01:00:39,244
Okay.

596
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:45,990
- We must be here.
- Yeah.

597
01:00:46,425 --> 01:00:47,992
- Don't you think?
- Yes.

598
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:51,517
Let's start there.

599
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:53,214
Okay. Hang on.

600
01:00:55,129 --> 01:00:56,435
- Come on!
- Okay.

601
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:11,406
And Sofia went out there?

602
01:01:13,452 --> 01:01:15,672
They refused to send anyone.

603
01:01:18,196 --> 01:01:20,024
They didn't want to risk
any more lives.

604
01:01:22,026 --> 01:01:23,462
So, she just went.

605
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:26,683
Hmm.

606
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:48,139
- Hi, Odin.
- Hi.

607
01:01:49,314 --> 01:01:51,490
- How's it going?
- Fine.

608
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:55,494
Can I get a hug?

609
01:02:07,158 --> 01:02:08,289
We have to go down there.

610
01:03:11,439 --> 01:03:12,571
We have to drop it.

611
01:03:13,746 --> 01:03:15,748
- Can it withstand that?
- It has to.

612
01:03:21,058 --> 01:03:22,276
Ready?

613
01:03:25,497 --> 01:03:26,846
Three, two...

614
01:03:28,761 --> 01:03:30,067
one.

615
01:04:00,967 --> 01:04:01,881
We're on.

616
01:04:03,056 --> 01:04:04,971
- It seems to be working.
- Okay.

617
01:05:02,681 --> 01:05:03,900
Turn on the thermal camera.

618
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:42,416
I'm going in
between these pipes.

619
01:06:34,294 --> 01:06:35,382
He's alive!

620
01:06:57,274 --> 01:06:58,275
Oddvar.

621
01:07:03,715 --> 01:07:04,846
It can't be!

622
01:07:05,499 --> 01:07:08,894
They're from ten minutes ago.
How can they be wrong?

623
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:13,594
JET FALCON DA-20
MARITIME SURVEILLANCE

624
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:40,404
The slide has ripped
open the oil pipelines.

625
01:07:41,187 --> 01:07:43,929
The black you see here is oil.

626
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:49,021
And the wind isn't on our side.
The oil slick...

627
01:07:49,848 --> 01:07:51,197
is moving toward the coast.

628
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:55,941
How big is it?

629
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,772
Approximately 100,000
square kilometers.

630
01:08:01,947 --> 01:08:04,167
And growing.

631
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:09,346
Gunn, what is
the worst-case scenario?

632
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:14,525
Norway's entire western coast

633
01:08:14,873 --> 01:08:17,049
will be devastated.

634
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:21,227
Molde, AÅlesund, Bergen,
Haugesund, Stavanger.

635
01:08:21,488 --> 01:08:24,970
Every fjord,
every nook and cranny.

636
01:08:27,451 --> 01:08:29,409
Birds. Fish.

637
01:08:31,019 --> 01:08:32,499
All fauna. Nature.

638
01:08:33,587 --> 01:08:37,461
All aquaculture ruined.
The fishing industry. Tourism.

639
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:40,812
It will take...

640
01:08:41,639 --> 01:08:44,685
decades to repair the damage,
maybe a century.

641
01:08:46,948 --> 01:08:48,950
And then...

642
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,781
it will continue down this way,
expanding toward Denmark,

643
01:08:53,955 --> 01:08:57,307
Germany, the Netherlands,
Britain...

644
01:09:02,747 --> 01:09:04,618
What can we do

645
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,577
to limit the damage?

646
01:09:08,013 --> 01:09:11,843
We have contacted NOFO,
the Coastal Administration,

647
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:16,978
local authorities.
They are all on high alert,

648
01:09:17,283 --> 01:09:21,505
but no one is prepared
for anything on this scale.

649
01:09:27,424 --> 01:09:28,903
How long do we have?

650
01:09:30,078 --> 01:09:34,474
It won't make landfall
until sometime tomorrow night,

651
01:09:34,692 --> 01:09:35,867
but when it does...

652
01:09:38,739 --> 01:09:40,045
There is another option.

653
01:09:42,961 --> 01:09:44,397
But we'd have to act now.

654
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:49,054
It's never been done
on this large a scale.

655
01:09:49,881 --> 01:09:52,362
But right now
the slick is concentrated.

656
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,888
And the oil
is still thick enough.

657
01:10:02,023 --> 01:10:03,634
Thick enough for what?

658
01:10:06,463 --> 01:10:08,204
Setting it on fire.

659
01:10:17,822 --> 01:10:20,955
This slick is too big
for an in-situ burning.

660
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,783
The consequences...

661
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:26,396
The consequences will be less
than what you just outlined.

662
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:36,493
I can't make
this decision alone.

663
01:10:43,935 --> 01:10:45,066
Here.

664
01:11:24,454 --> 01:11:25,759
It should be here.

665
01:11:26,412 --> 01:11:28,893
- Which one?
- E601B, there.

666
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:40,078
Stian?

667
01:11:41,601 --> 01:11:42,820
Stian?

668
01:11:57,878 --> 01:11:59,053
Stian?

669
01:11:59,967 --> 01:12:01,142
Stian?

670
01:12:16,636 --> 01:12:17,855
Stian?

671
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:21,685
Sofia?

672
01:12:21,902 --> 01:12:22,990
Sofia!

673
01:12:24,296 --> 01:12:26,167
Hi. Hi.

674
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,866
- Hi.
- Hi.

675
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:31,999
You're alive!

676
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:37,788
- Can you get up here?
- No.

677
01:12:41,487 --> 01:12:44,360
- I need a wrench! Fast!
- Okay.

678
01:12:46,013 --> 01:12:47,841
- Are you hurt?
- Yes.

679
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,322
- We have to get you out.
- Okay.

680
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:09,297
- Find anything?
- Yes!

681
01:13:13,911 --> 01:13:15,434
Sofia, we have
to get out of here!

682
01:13:45,377 --> 01:13:48,162
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

683
01:14:22,283 --> 01:14:23,720
I have spoken
to the prime minister

684
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:25,635
and the cabinet.

685
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:30,596
Let's do it.

686
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:33,686
Set it on fire.

687
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,887
You can set up here.

688
01:15:02,933 --> 01:15:04,717
William,
we'll get an image now.

689
01:15:05,196 --> 01:15:06,153
Good.

690
01:15:58,597 --> 01:16:00,338
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

691
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:02,340
- Let me call Vibeke.
- Yeah.

692
01:16:06,997 --> 01:16:08,085
Sofia?

693
01:16:32,631 --> 01:16:33,632
Ronny?

694
01:16:34,938 --> 01:16:36,766
They're setting fire
to the oil slick.

695
01:16:39,812 --> 01:16:41,858
- Is Gullfaks...
- Right in the middle.

696
01:16:43,816 --> 01:16:44,817
Wait here.

697
01:16:47,298 --> 01:16:48,647
- What floor?
- Fourth.

698
01:17:17,023 --> 01:17:18,155
Stop!

699
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:21,332
Stop that! Stop!

700
01:17:30,863 --> 01:17:34,824
Stop! Sofia Hartman
went out to Gullfaks A! She...

701
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:44,398
What was that?

702
01:17:58,456 --> 01:17:59,544
There are people out there.

703
01:18:09,206 --> 01:18:10,250
Shit.

704
01:18:12,165 --> 01:18:14,646
- She isn't answering.
- Try Saga.

705
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:25,744
William?

706
01:18:26,353 --> 01:18:28,268
William, a Stian Birkeland
is on the line.

707
01:18:40,106 --> 01:18:41,499
This is William Lie.

708
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:45,459
Stian Birkeland here.
We're on Gullfaks A.

709
01:18:45,633 --> 01:18:47,070
You have to send someone
to get us.

710
01:18:49,463 --> 01:18:51,422
Birkeland, listen carefully.

711
01:18:59,822 --> 01:19:00,779
What is it?

712
01:19:01,649 --> 01:19:03,739
Stian?
What are they saying?

713
01:19:04,652 --> 01:19:05,697
What is it?

714
01:19:07,655 --> 01:19:08,569
Stian?

715
01:19:10,223 --> 01:19:11,616
They bombed the oil slick.

716
01:19:13,357 --> 01:19:14,575
They set fire to it.

717
01:19:19,842 --> 01:19:21,452
The flames will reach us
in five minutes.

718
01:19:24,672 --> 01:19:26,152
No one is coming to get us.

719
01:19:34,334 --> 01:19:35,466
Is his son here?

720
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:41,907
Stian?

721
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:49,828
Sofia, what do we do?

722
01:19:57,401 --> 01:19:58,402
Stian?

723
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:03,668
Okay.

724
01:20:12,329 --> 01:20:13,373
Lifeboats.

725
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:15,811
Are there lifeboats here?

726
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,465
- Lifeboats!
- Down there.

727
01:20:21,904 --> 01:20:24,820
Okay. We have to get down there.
Come! Arthur!

728
01:20:43,926 --> 01:20:45,231
I'll wait here.

729
01:20:46,537 --> 01:20:47,494
No.

730
01:20:48,408 --> 01:20:51,150
I think it's time
to... leave now.

731
01:20:51,455 --> 01:20:53,239
Sofia told me to wait here.

732
01:20:57,591 --> 01:20:58,723
Then we will.

733
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:28,579
Sofia?

734
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:31,190
- We have to fill it with water.
- Huh?

735
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:34,367
Sofia, what are we doing?

736
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:38,981
We'll fill it with water
and dive under the flames.

737
01:21:45,378 --> 01:21:46,510
- Okay?
- Yes.

738
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,207
- Okay.
- You wait here.

739
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,915
Sofia, take this.

740
01:22:00,002 --> 01:22:01,394
- What? Okay.
- Take that.

741
01:22:06,182 --> 01:22:07,139
Arthur!

742
01:22:07,835 --> 01:22:08,924
Take this.

743
01:22:10,403 --> 01:22:11,665
- Stick it in the boat.
- Yeah.

744
01:22:11,839 --> 01:22:12,928
I'll get another.

745
01:22:24,287 --> 01:22:25,766
Once they fill with water,

746
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:27,899
- open both valves.
- Okay.

747
01:22:30,293 --> 01:22:33,035
"Once they fill with water,
open both valves."

748
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:11,725
How much should I fill?

749
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:15,991
Sofia!

750
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:24,564
- How much?
- I don't know.

751
01:23:27,654 --> 01:23:30,135
Arthur, pull it up. Pull it up!

752
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,789
- This?
- Yes. Up.

753
01:23:40,841 --> 01:23:42,756
A little more. A little more.

754
01:23:51,635 --> 01:23:53,332
Okay, that's enough! Enough!

755
01:24:00,252 --> 01:24:01,384
Wait, wait!

756
01:24:01,906 --> 01:24:03,212
- Come on!
- It's stuck!

757
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:04,778
It's stuck!

758
01:24:05,257 --> 01:24:07,129
- Come on!
- Hang on.

759
01:24:10,871 --> 01:24:13,091
Ow!

760
01:24:16,877 --> 01:24:17,878
Sofia?

761
01:24:19,532 --> 01:24:22,231
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Get in!

762
01:24:33,372 --> 01:24:34,504
Buckle up.

763
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:39,552
- What now?
- Turn that red screw.

764
01:24:40,814 --> 01:24:42,164
- This one? Okay.
- Yes.

765
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:44,079
And then pull the release.

766
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,084
- Okay. Ready?
- Yes.

767
01:24:57,788 --> 01:24:59,616
- Nothing's happening.
- Pull it again!

768
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:01,879
Come on!

769
01:25:02,575 --> 01:25:03,750
Shit.

770
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:07,580
Did you pull the lever
all the way up?

771
01:25:07,754 --> 01:25:08,799
Yes.

772
01:25:19,897 --> 01:25:21,159
One of them is down.

773
01:25:24,031 --> 01:25:25,946
- It has to be up.
- Okay.

774
01:25:26,164 --> 01:25:28,166
No, no, no, no!
Stop, stop, stop!

775
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:30,516
It'll launch when you pull it!
You won't make it back.

776
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:51,494
- No!
- No, Arthur!

777
01:25:51,885 --> 01:25:54,584
No, Arthur, don't!
Arthur, stop!

778
01:25:57,543 --> 01:25:59,154
- No, come back!
- Arthur!

779
01:26:03,549 --> 01:26:05,595
- No, sit down!
- Whoa!

780
01:26:07,814 --> 01:26:09,816
Sit down!

781
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:44,460
Stian!

782
01:26:45,809 --> 01:26:46,766
Stian.

783
01:26:48,507 --> 01:26:49,813
Stian...

784
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:56,994
Stian, Stian.

785
01:27:21,323 --> 01:27:22,672
Stian, where's the pump?

786
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:24,848
Stian!

787
01:27:35,075 --> 01:27:37,382
No!

788
01:29:00,509 --> 01:29:04,513
No!

789
01:29:04,774 --> 01:29:06,297
No!

790
01:31:26,219 --> 01:31:27,351
Stian.

791
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:33,662
Pump.

792
01:31:35,838 --> 01:31:39,102
- You have to pump.
- I tried. It doesn't work.

793
01:31:40,799 --> 01:31:42,061
I'm sorry.

794
01:31:42,714 --> 01:31:45,935
Try opening... the valve.

795
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:49,721
Black handle.

796
01:31:52,332 --> 01:31:53,682
Black handle.

797
01:32:55,221 --> 01:32:56,440
Yes!

798
01:32:56,919 --> 01:32:59,312
Stian! Stian!

799
01:33:24,381 --> 01:33:25,861
It's working!

800
01:34:16,389 --> 01:34:17,303
Hello?

801
01:34:18,391 --> 01:34:19,784
This is Ronny.

802
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:23,658
Hi, Ronny. It's Stian.

803
01:34:24,441 --> 01:34:26,748
Oh!

804
01:34:27,923 --> 01:34:30,708
I can't believe it!
Where are you?

805
01:34:31,753 --> 01:34:33,015
We're in a lifeboat.

806
01:34:33,755 --> 01:34:36,148
- By the platform.
- We're coming.

807
01:34:37,497 --> 01:34:39,369
- We're on our way.
- Ronny?

808
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:42,894
Is Odin there?

809
01:34:43,329 --> 01:34:45,767
Yes, hang on.
It's for you.

810
01:34:47,072 --> 01:34:47,943
Hello?

811
01:34:48,944 --> 01:34:50,075
Hi, Odin.

812
01:34:51,076 --> 01:34:52,034
It's Dad.

813
01:34:52,382 --> 01:34:53,339
Dad!

814
01:34:54,471 --> 01:34:55,951
How are you?

815
01:34:57,082 --> 01:34:58,823
I'm fine. Are you okay?

816
01:34:59,519 --> 01:35:00,782
Yes.

817
01:35:02,261 --> 01:35:03,567
We're coming home.

818
01:35:06,918 --> 01:35:07,919
Sofia too.

819
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:09,807
Dad!

820
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:40,550
It took almost a year
for the smoke to clear.

821
01:37:47,209 --> 01:37:49,385
Ten thousand billion kroner
