00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:40,785
Last Day of School
May 28, 1976 - 1:05 P.M.

3
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,614
I'm headed this way.

4
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,682
Later. - So what did we decide?
- About what?

5
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,384
About tonight?

6
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:54,017
I'll probably get hung up
with the guys.

7
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,567
Why don't we just meet at the party?
- Okay.

8
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,476
Wouldn't want you waitin' around
for me all night. - Alright. - Cool.

9
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,190
See ya later.
- Bye.

10
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,000
Slater-san!

11
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:25,736
How's it goin'?
- Fixin' to be a lot better.

12
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:30,563
What time is your party, man?
- 9:30, man.

13
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:35,159
I'll be there, man.

14
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,172
See ya later, alligator.

15
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:41,370
Wait! I gotta cruise by this afternoon
on a little business,

16
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,431
if you know what I'm talkin' about.
- That. - It's what I'm talking about.

17
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:50,571
I'm fuckin' wasted.

18
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:58,451
Walkin' down the hall by myself,
smokin' a "J" with 50 elves.

19
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:02,208
Later.
- Woodward, Bernstein.

20
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:07,700
That makes you Deep Throat!
Is this a smoked or liquid lunch?

21
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:09,750
Smoked, right?

22
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:13,546
Are we gonna play poker tonight?
- Count me out.

23
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:16,913
I'll probably be going
to Pickford's party.

24
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:21,889
We should do that. We can play
poker anytime. - Go to a party?

25
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:24,250
Mike! Cynthia...?
- Don't worry about it.

26
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:28,824
I don't feel comfortable at those
things. - Pick us up at 8.

27
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:32,380
I guess we're going to the party.

28
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:37,779
I gotta tell you
about this dream. - Oh yeah?

29
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:42,978
But you gotta promise
not to tell anyone. Say "I promise."

30
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:46,843
I promise
not to tell anyone. - Thank you.

31
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:52,071
Okay, there I am.
And I'm gettin' it on

32
00:04:52,654 --> 00:04:56,363
with this perfect
female body, but...

33
00:04:58,285 --> 00:05:00,401
What?
- I can't say.

34
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:06,325
You can't build me up and not deliver!
"Perfect female body." Not bad.

35
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:09,918
But the head of Abraham Lincoln.

36
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:14,173
I mean, the hat and the beard...

37
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:17,949
Oh well, best not think too deeply.
- Best not.

38
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:22,713
I gotta get some stuff from Mr.
Birchfield. See ya in a few minutes.

39
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:27,566
"Gilligan's transistor radio."
That was a good one!

40
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:34,600
What about that one where that sexy
surfer catches that huge wave!

41
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,071
You remember that?
- Oh yeah.

42
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:40,089
The mosquitoes!
- Pink, let's go!

43
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,019
Come on!

44
00:05:42,497 --> 00:05:48,015
I can't go until Miss Wilk gets here.
So get Benny. - Alright.

45
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,296
What?
- Coach gave me something for you.

46
00:05:56,846 --> 00:06:01,317
They're really doin' this?
- He wants 'em all back today.

47
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:06,212
Everybody's signing it?
- Just to get him off our backs.

48
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:10,489
You sign it.
Never think about it again!

49
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:13,628
You're gonna make
a big deal outta this, aren't you?

50
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:20,695
You're gettin' air from here.
It's no good. You see this?

51
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:23,657
It's gotta be tight

52
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:26,395
to get a good hit.

53
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:41,354
I ain't believin' that about Bonham's
1-hour drum solo. - 2 minutes.

54
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,773
You couldn't handle that on acid.

55
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:56,399
We're gonna go to the bathroom.
Could you let Miss Wilks know?

56
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:59,857
This is totally amazing!

57
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:05,762
"I voluntarily agree to not indulge
in any alcohol, drugs or engage

58
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:10,569
in any other illegal activity that may
jeopardize the years of hard work

59
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:15,131
we have committed to a championship
season in '76." - Bullshit!

60
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:20,348
You guys are signing? - Apparently.
- What next? Urine tests?

61
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:24,966
I didn't know drugs are such a problem
they had resort to neo-McCarthyism!

62
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:30,271
They're afraid we'll have a good time!
- The "age-suppressing-youth thing".

63
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,210
"Neo-McCarthyism!" I like that!
- That's good, Tony.

64
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:39,997
You were in class trying to list
all the "Gilligan's Island" episodes!

65
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:44,445
What're you talking about, girl?
- You weren't thinking about it, huh?

66
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:49,276
"Gilligan's Island?" - It's what 's
called a male pornographic fantasy.

67
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:51,948
Oh my!
- Think about it!

68
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:55,820
You're alone on a deserted island
with two readily available women:

69
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:58,694
One a seductive sex-goddess type,

70
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:02,213
the other a healthy girl-next-door
type with a nice butt.

71
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:05,405
So guys have it all...
the Madonna and the whore.

72
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:09,008
Women get nothing.
We get a geek,

73
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:13,080
an overweight, middle-aged guy,
some nerdy scientific type.

74
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,197
The professor is sexy.
- Pink!

75
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:22,500
Come on, man! - We're off
to raise some hell. Look at that!

76
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,643
Hey, you guys!

77
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:31,820
Wait up! Benny, I have a favor
to ask you. - What do you need?

78
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:35,937
Take it easy on my brother
this summer. - Mitch Kramer?

79
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:37,624
Yeah, Mitch Kramer.

80
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:40,847
I'm gonna give him a beating!

81
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:46,543
Don't get him more than the others.
He's kinda little. - You got our word.

82
00:08:47,187 --> 00:08:50,418
Little brother'll be okay.
- Thanks. See you guys!

83
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:55,256
These guys, I don't know...

84
00:08:56,572 --> 00:09:01,441
Just a little bullshit, right?
- Major bullshit. He's a dead man!

85
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:03,227
Shotgun!

86
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:11,106
Check it out. I been waitin' 3 years
for this. Those junior high kids

87
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:15,591
are dead meat.
We're gonna beat 'em!

88
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:29,013
Okay, you freshman fucks,
listen up!

89
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:31,953
It's your lucky day.

90
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:34,952
Usually you spend your freshman summer
getting your asses busted

91
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,036
and running for your lives.
But this year, we feel sorry for you.

92
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:41,334
So we're gonna take it easy on you

93
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:43,863
and save us all a lot of time.

94
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:48,489
So if you meet here
after school today,

95
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:53,399
you'll only get one lick from each
of us. But you run like cowards,

96
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:58,202
it's open season all summer.

97
00:09:58,719 --> 00:09:59,834
Oh yeah, Mitch Kramer!

98
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:02,001
Mitchy!

99
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:09,689
We're lookin' for you, pal.
Your ass'll be purple...

100
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:12,699
Have a nice afternoon.

101
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:19,468
You better get outta town. Spend
the summer with your grandparents.

102
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:24,863
You are gonna show up
to our game tonight?

103
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:30,304
I'm pitching. I kinda have to. - How
should we inscribe your tombstone?

104
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:35,051
How 'bout "Bent over"?
- Right, piss-ant!

105
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:39,306
Why aren't they after anybody else?
- They are, man. Believe me.

106
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:41,604
I know, man.

107
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:45,195
Come on, Mel, hop on.
- Let's go!

108
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:56,388
Shit!

109
00:10:58,864 --> 00:11:00,183
Hey, Coach.

110
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:03,607
So tell me,

111
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,594
any of you girls gonna be ready to
play football this fall? - Don't know.

112
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:14,521
I've been doing so good in English,
I figured I'd be a writer.

113
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:20,918
You wouldn't know how to write your
name if it wasn't on your locker.

114
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:25,627
Don't go soft on me this summer,
sitting around the pool all day,

115
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:28,140
chasing the muff around.

116
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:33,487
Hell, man! My grandmother's
quicker than you pansies!

117
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:35,944
'Course she's 6'3", 250

118
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:40,035
and runs a 4.540.
- What's the matter, Floyd?

119
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:45,211
Quarterbacks don't have to do what
coaches say? You give him that pledge?

120
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,995
The pledge, did you give it to him?
- Yeah, it's right here.

121
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:54,490
If you could get that to us by the end
of the day. You guys see that he does.

122
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,201
Alright, Coach.
- See ya!

123
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,328
Randy Floyd!

124
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:06,078
You need an attitude adjustment.
Get your priorities straight!

125
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,115
And watch out
with that other crowd.

126
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,795
Don't think I haven't noticed. Hey!

127
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,627
I want that paper

128
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,818
on my desk before you leave here
today, you hear me?

129
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,284
"Attitude adjustment!"

130
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:32,783
"Priorities!" - Runs with that
bad crowd. Watch yourself.

131
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:39,692
Well, I got Coach's and everybody's
attitude-adjusted priorities here.

132
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,850
Yeah, that's good.
- Yeah.

133
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:49,725
You hear O'Bannion flunked?
- What a dumb shit!

134
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,504
You all ready to bust some ass?

135
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:01,578
What's up, Don, Benny, Melvin? Good
to see ya. - See ya in half an hour.

136
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,945
We gotta take your truck. I'm low
on gas. - My truck?

137
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,848
What're you doing?
Picking up trash?

138
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:16,939
I was waiting for one of them idiot
coaches to piss me off.

139
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:22,141
You take the thing too personally.
You gotta... shake it off.

140
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:25,560
Ever thought why we play football?

141
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:30,058
How many times you gotten laid
because you're a football player?

142
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,427
I don't know.

143
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:35,775
A few, probably.
- A few?

144
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:40,712
I bet we could do just as well
if we were in a band or something.

145
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:46,947
I gotta put in a final appearance...
- Who you got going in there?

146
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:50,400
Vicky.

147
00:13:50,874 --> 00:13:53,547
Come on, let's go get naked now!

148
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:56,858
Come on!
- Mr. Dawson?

149
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:02,129
Take it somewhere else. Mr. Floyd,
are you gracing us with your presence?

150
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,983
Might as well.

151
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:06,670
Ginny?

152
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:12,215
You and I could get together. It'll
be illegal. I'll keep things quiet.

153
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:22,616
At the party there's gonna be a girl
with knockers this big. - Bullshit!

154
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,032
Promise. Two handfuls.
- No way! - Hey!

155
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:33,009
Pentico's got his brother's car.
Let's go, man. Cool.

156
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:36,463
Go talk to him.
- I'm not going alone.

157
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,063
Mr. Payne? Sir?

158
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:48,548
Every second you let us out early
would increase our chance of survival.

159
00:14:50,727 --> 00:14:53,560
Like our sergeant told us
before one trip into the jungle:

160
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:55,762
"Men,

161
00:14:56,566 --> 00:15:00,845
50 of you are leaving on a mission.
25 ain't comin' back."

162
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,288
The '68 Democratic Convention

163
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:12,257
was probably the most bitchin' time
in my life.

164
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:19,311
One more thing: This summer, with all
the bicentennial 4th of July brouhaha,

165
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:24,683
you're actually celebrating a bunch of
slave-owning, aristocratic white males

166
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:28,137
who didn't want to pay their taxes.

167
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,307
Jump in! Come on!

168
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:14,766
Hurry up, Hirschfelder, or we're
gonna leave your ass. - Let's go!

169
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:17,128
Oh shit!

170
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:20,123
Ducks on the pond!
- How're you doin', boys?

171
00:17:27,764 --> 00:17:31,643
Wake up, bitch!
Open! Open!

172
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:40,386
Hey, open!

173
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:49,354
What do you think?
- Alright. Let's go.

174
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:51,822
Hey, you! Come here.

175
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,405
You.

176
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:57,893
Who are you?

177
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:01,849
Nobody. I mean,
I wasn't in the truck.

178
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:04,575
Are you a freshman?
- Yeah.

179
00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:08,564
Are you in or are you out?
- In. - Let's go.

180
00:18:54,144 --> 00:18:58,422
We really pissed 'em off. Just drop me
off at my house. You still with me?

181
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:01,056
My house!

182
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:04,962
They're slowing down.
You get out and get 'em!

183
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,839
Good luck, man. Be there tonight!

184
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:20,497
Nice try, freshman.

185
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:24,562
For being brave little kids, I'm only
gonna give you 5 licks.

186
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:27,743
Grab a pole and let's get going.

187
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,852
I don't think so, creep!

188
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:32,338
Mom!

189
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,492
Carl, get in the house.

190
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:36,569
Get in the house!

191
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:41,025
And you...
Get the hell off my property.

192
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:45,652
Sorry, ma'am. I was just escorting
your fine son home from school.

193
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,720
There's some ruffians
about and I...

194
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:52,872
Oh, Mitch and Carl,
we'll be seeing each other again.

195
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:04,819
I fuckin' saw that, you sack of shit!
You two are dead! Fuckin' dead!

196
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,080
Excuse me. Thank you.

197
00:20:11,348 --> 00:20:14,624
Alright, you little freshman bitches!

198
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,629
Air raid!

199
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:20,819
That was pathetic!

200
00:20:22,944 --> 00:20:26,732
Let's try it again. That means
get up, you lazy bitches! Get up!

201
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,349
Air raid!

202
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:36,155
That was horrible, you slut girls,
you freshman sluts! Get up!

203
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,785
Up!

204
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:41,060
Up! Up! ...Air raid!

205
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:47,640
The entire community seems to be
supporting this, or turn their heads.

206
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:51,537
They have permission to use the
parking lot. No parents seem to mind.

207
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:54,692
They're selling concessions.
- I know.

208
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,635
We seniors, we tried. We gave you
a chance, but since you prick teasers

209
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:02,993
can't follow instructions,

210
00:21:03,486 --> 00:21:07,957
we're gonna have to try something
else, won't we? Seniors?

211
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:12,142
You love us. Smile!
You love us!

212
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:25,227
Suffer, sisters!

213
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:37,816
Eat it! Open wide!

214
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:46,545
Love it, girls!

215
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,881
Welcome to high school,
honey!

216
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:06,941
Propose to Mr. Dawson.

217
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:10,585
Will you marry me?

218
00:22:11,055 --> 00:22:13,205
Don't know. What's in it for me?

219
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:16,762
Anything you want.
- Anything? - Anything.

220
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:18,949
Go like this.

221
00:22:20,314 --> 00:22:22,305
Do you spit or swallow?

222
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:25,547
Whatever you like.

223
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:30,180
Whatever I like? I'd definitely marry
you. - That's so degrading.

224
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:34,412
You're an asshole.
- Yes, I am.

225
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,707
That's terrible, man. Horrible.

226
00:22:40,835 --> 00:22:46,468
I feel for you. I did it when I was
a freshman, and you'll do it.

227
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:51,685
Now fry like bacon,
you little freshmen piggies!

228
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:57,789
Hi.
- Propose to Tony.

229
00:22:58,353 --> 00:22:59,672
Oh, God.

230
00:23:00,773 --> 00:23:02,445
On your knees!

231
00:23:08,781 --> 00:23:09,930
Will you marry me?

232
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:13,205
What am I supposed to say?
- I don't know.

233
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:16,941
What will you do for me?
- Anything you want.

234
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:21,976
Imagine the possibilities.
Seriously, you can stand up.

235
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:26,326
What's your name? - Sabrina.
- I'm Tony, Anthony actually.

236
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,111
Sorry.

237
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:29,870
This is Mike.

238
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:34,384
We're just discussing the utter
stupidity of these initiation rituals,

239
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:38,523
wondering why someone like you
would subject yourself to it.

240
00:23:39,104 --> 00:23:43,780
What're we having? Social hour?
I'm a bitch. Back to the pit.

241
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,699
It's almost over.

242
00:23:48,196 --> 00:23:52,314
Am I mistaken, or was there a little
thing going on with that vixen, stud?

243
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:56,663
You know how it is... - Bet she's
cute once you clean the shit off her.

244
00:23:57,288 --> 00:24:01,168
Okay, it's hot out here,
and I'm sick of looking at you.

245
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:05,222
So let's get outta here.
What you lookin' at?

246
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:10,428
Wipe that face off your head, bitch!
Get in the truck.

247
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:16,522
Maybe if you ever left
the poker table. - What about you?

248
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:20,173
The point is, that's why
we're going out tonight.

249
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,803
You might experience something more
tangible than an Abe Lincoln dream.

250
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:32,029
A hairline fracture! What did you do?
- Benny was wearin' their asses out!

251
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:36,197
Just givin' 'em a little beatin'
they'll never forget.

252
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:38,430
"Here's to you, Ma!"

253
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,831
That's your fuckin' mother!

254
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:46,647
Say man, fuck the coaches. Do it
for us. - You pick this thing up?

255
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:50,806
Yeah. - What're you doin'?
- He ain't doin' shit.

256
00:24:52,304 --> 00:24:56,820
Any more details of my life you can
let me in on, Ben? - Lots!

257
00:24:58,435 --> 00:25:00,187
O'Bannion, what're you doin'?

258
00:25:02,105 --> 00:25:06,940
You didn't hear, did you?
I got a shotgun pulled on my ass.

259
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:09,878
Seniors are the best!

260
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:41,980
Hey, Mrs. Pickford.
- You here to see Kevin?

261
00:25:42,522 --> 00:25:46,356
No, actually, we came to see you.
- Bet you're glad school's out.

262
00:25:46,944 --> 00:25:50,903
Got our report cards today. - How did
you do? - Straight A's. - Both of you?

263
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:56,325
Just kiddin'. - Big trip?
- For the weekend. - Takin' Kev?

264
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:59,991
No, he's staying here.
- Oh, he is?

265
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,691
Go on in. He's up there somewhere.

266
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,963
Let's get together sometime.
- Yeah, that'd be fun.

267
00:26:14,555 --> 00:26:18,434
What do you do for fun?
- Just hang out with the girls.

268
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:23,489
Drive around. That kind of stuff.
There's a big party tonight.

269
00:26:26,443 --> 00:26:29,082
Do you wanna come?
- Yeah? Cool.

270
00:26:29,612 --> 00:26:34,367
You think it'd be all right? - Fine.
- Great. Pick you up at 8:30.

271
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,143
See you then.
- Okay, bye.

272
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:52,989
Sample of the goods.

273
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:56,279
15 bucks.

274
00:26:59,643 --> 00:27:04,717
Can you spot me ten?
I'll pay you like Tuesday.

275
00:27:10,488 --> 00:27:12,319
Thank you.

276
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:16,922
Who is it?
- Kevin, you need to come out.

277
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:19,850
It reeks in here.

278
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:26,720
Kevin, there's someone out here
who needs to talk to you.

279
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:29,935
What about?
- Get the door, man! Here.

280
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,018
Slater, lose it!
- Kevin, open the door.

281
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:38,759
Dad, Mom.

282
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:43,139
What's up?
- Did you order kegs of beer? - No.

283
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,324
There's a fella on a beer truck
that says you did.

284
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:49,190
Oh, really? Just a sec.

285
00:27:58,662 --> 00:28:00,539
That guy said I ordered a keg of beer?
- Yeah.

286
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,272
He said it's for the Pickford
residence. - This address? - Yeah.

287
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:10,791
Funny. Why don't I see what's
going on? - Think you better.

288
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:14,095
Be right back.

289
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:16,665
Know anything about a party here?

290
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:20,290
No, sir.

291
00:28:28,526 --> 00:28:32,485
Hey, man.
Aren't you a bit early?

292
00:28:34,574 --> 00:28:36,883
Yeah, about an hour and a half.

293
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:41,926
I got a little action happenin'...
- So you got the wrong house.

294
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:51,441
Yeah, inconvenience for you...
Wrong Mr. Pickford altogether!

295
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,610
These things happen.
Don't worry about it... Ben.

296
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:03,919
Were you going to have a party here?
- Don't know what that was about.

297
00:29:04,521 --> 00:29:07,672
Start unpacking.
We're not goin' anywhere.

298
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:11,259
Fucker!

299
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,923
Strike two!

300
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:22,985
Time!

301
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,916
Kramer, get this kid out,
or we're gonna beat your ass!

302
00:31:28,461 --> 00:31:32,136
Let's go!
- Beat you like a runnin' mule!

303
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:36,867
Hey, man, forget about those guys.
Just get this last guy out.

304
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:41,065
Easy for your ass to say!
- There's nothin' you can do.

305
00:31:41,641 --> 00:31:43,393
How'd they know I was gonna be here?

306
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:48,922
Quit stallin'! - Hope you got more
than a jock strap under there!

307
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:54,196
Because you're not gonna be able
to sit, don't let it affect you.

308
00:31:54,822 --> 00:32:00,613
Leave through the gate in right field.
That'll draw them out of here.

309
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,754
They're gonna get you anyway.

310
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:06,932
Yeah, get outta here.

311
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,088
What're you lookin' at?
Keep your head in the game!

312
00:32:28,773 --> 00:32:29,967
Strike three!

313
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:50,932
Good game...

314
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:04,791
Good game!
- Way to go.

315
00:33:08,981 --> 00:33:10,494
Come on.

316
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,389
Mitch!

317
00:33:13,152 --> 00:33:16,906
What happened to your buds?
- Let's get this guy!

318
00:33:25,498 --> 00:33:28,137
How's your dad doing?
- He's doing great.

319
00:33:29,752 --> 00:33:35,145
This arm ready to throw 2,000 yards
next fall? - We'll see.

320
00:33:35,966 --> 00:33:40,836
We're dependin' on you boys. Let me
tell you what. You're lookin' good.

321
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,759
13 starters comin' back,
22 lettermen.

322
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:48,385
Yeah.

323
00:33:48,855 --> 00:33:52,848
You folks take care.
- Good to see you, Randy.

324
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:12,828
Oh God, you know that hurts!
- What's goin' on here?

325
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,790
Pink, you missed it!
- Where are you headed to now?

326
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:20,479
The Emporium. Gonna join us?
- Yeah, see you up there.

327
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,987
You sign my paddle later.

328
00:35:24,495 --> 00:35:29,445
Gotta get seconds with him.
- You next, Pink. - Sure.

329
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:31,882
You already got him.

330
00:35:32,378 --> 00:35:36,974
Fuck it. I'm gonna find your skinny
partner Carl and his mom.

331
00:35:37,592 --> 00:35:42,586
I took it easy on you. You're not
smilin' now, you sack of shit.

332
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:50,018
Benny, Don!
- Bummer about Pickford's party.

333
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:55,614
His old man found out.
Total rip-off.

334
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:06,733
We got a few sixers. You with us?
- Yeah, gotta go home and change.

335
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:12,572
Catch up with you. - See you later.
Kid, take care of that butt. Hold up!

336
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,768
You need a ride?

337
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,250
Yeah.

338
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,619
I think they left me.

339
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,660
Here you go.

340
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,427
There's always one senior
who has to be the bad ass.

341
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:54,808
O'Bannion's gonna be the first senior
to take that honor 2 years in a row.

342
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,228
The guy's a dick, right?

343
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,763
Yeah, he's kind of a joke.

344
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:07,510
He's not a bad guy
to have on your side.

345
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,271
Did you get it bad when you were
a freshman? - Shit, man!

346
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:20,021
They waited for my ass after baseball.
It was vicious.

347
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,705
It's best to get a lot at once,

348
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:28,673
'cause after 10 licks, your ass is so
numb, it's best to get it over with.

349
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,267
I had some pretty cool seniors.

350
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:38,630
They'd take you out, bust the hell
outta you and get you drunk.

351
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,692
Thanks, man.
- Take care.

352
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:55,879
Since the party's not goin' on,

353
00:37:56,693 --> 00:38:02,086
me and the other guys'll end up
ridin' around. Want us to pick you up?

354
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:06,028
Think that's a good idea?
- Yeah, sure, man.

355
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:10,537
The guys who haven't got you yet
will give you a few days to rest.

356
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:15,437
It'd be pretty cool to show up and
let 'em know it doesn't bother you.

357
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:20,567
Yeah, okay. Cool. - See ya later?
- Sure. Thanks for the ride.

358
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:22,624
Hey, man.

359
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:27,169
Put some ice on it. Won't be anything
a few beers can't take care of.

360
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,609
What did she say? I'm just interested.
What did she call me?

361
00:39:17,193 --> 00:39:21,266
You hang out with her. You know it.
They talk about us. Just tell us.

362
00:39:21,864 --> 00:39:27,541
Nothing. - Nothing? I know
you're lying, you bitch!

363
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:32,834
You're not gonna get mad. - I'm not.
- I don't care what she thinks.

364
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:37,213
She called you a bitch and you a slut.
- She called me a slut?

365
00:39:37,798 --> 00:39:40,915
That bitch!
- Everybody calls you a slut!

366
00:39:41,468 --> 00:39:45,507
That bitch! I'm gonna kick her ass.
What a bitch!

367
00:39:46,098 --> 00:39:48,658
You said you weren't gonna get mad.
- I'm not mad.

368
00:39:56,441 --> 00:39:59,956
Look, I got a confession to make.
- What do you mean?

369
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:06,126
Well, y'know I've been talking about
going to law school, to help people?

370
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:12,781
I was standing at the post office
and everybody's looking pathetic.

371
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:18,579
People got drool sorta... This guy's
bending over. You could see the crack.

372
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:23,652
And I realized
that I don't want to do it.

373
00:40:24,262 --> 00:40:29,052
Sounds good but I don't like the
people I was talking about helping.

374
00:40:29,684 --> 00:40:34,314
I don't like people, period. You guys
are okay, but I'm a misanthrope.

375
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:38,375
You're not goin' to law school?
What do you wanna do?

376
00:40:40,194 --> 00:40:41,673
I wanna dance!

377
00:40:47,785 --> 00:40:49,936
Alright, let's rock and roll.

378
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,346
Hop in, man.

379
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:56,807
Whose car?

380
00:40:57,296 --> 00:41:00,413
You know Wooderson?
- How's it goin'?

381
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,983
Pretty good. How's it goin' with you?

382
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:07,348
Say man, you got a joint?

383
00:41:09,391 --> 00:41:11,347
No, not on me.

384
00:41:13,353 --> 00:41:16,026
It'd be a lot cooler if you did.

385
00:41:26,743 --> 00:41:31,134
You drivin' into Houston to get
those Aerosmith tickets? - Damn right!

386
00:41:31,748 --> 00:41:34,421
Evenin', ladies.
- Nice...

387
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:38,395
Need me to pick up a couple?
- Yeah, two. - Cool.

388
00:41:40,882 --> 00:41:46,559
You sure I'm okay in here? - If anyone
starts messin' with you, play it cool.

389
00:42:21,132 --> 00:42:22,485
One to go.

390
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:23,960
Prickford!

391
00:42:24,552 --> 00:42:27,589
"Would-a-been" happenin'!
- Bummer about your party.

392
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:31,654
What can I say?
Delivery guy bricked.

393
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:34,456
He said: "Keep your eye on the ball."

394
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:39,770
How's it goin'? - What's goin' on?
- Nothin'... nothin' at all.

395
00:42:40,444 --> 00:42:43,242
You know Mitch?
- I just heard about you.

396
00:42:43,905 --> 00:42:46,658
What'd you hear?
- Don't know. Are you okay?

397
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:54,287
Guess I'll see you guys later.
- Okay.

398
00:43:06,052 --> 00:43:09,727
What grade's she in?
- Sophomore.

399
00:43:12,142 --> 00:43:13,894
We gotta hurry though.

400
00:43:14,604 --> 00:43:18,802
Check this out, man. - Donny,
I got a big surprise for you.

401
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,313
Come on, let me make this shot!
Hold onto this! Tight!

402
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:35,952
Gene! Nice tongue! Who painted 'em?
- Mostly Michelle.

403
00:43:38,544 --> 00:43:40,580
I got an idea.
- What?

404
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:44,615
A beer bust later! - Pickford's
got a dube about to burn.

405
00:43:45,176 --> 00:43:47,644
You with us?
- Think about it.

406
00:43:49,472 --> 00:43:50,747
You cool, man?

407
00:43:52,935 --> 00:43:54,288
Like how?

408
00:44:02,194 --> 00:44:06,267
He was just askin' if you get high.
- Like smoke pot?

409
00:44:07,908 --> 00:44:09,705
I never have before, but...

410
00:44:19,378 --> 00:44:21,334
Where you goin'?

411
00:44:28,721 --> 00:44:30,439
Hi... No.

412
00:44:30,932 --> 00:44:32,684
Crank it up!

413
00:44:59,669 --> 00:45:01,341
It's the chicks. Shavonne's still

414
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:04,637
mad at me. Watch me get something
going. Hey, what's goin' on?

415
00:45:05,176 --> 00:45:07,849
What're you up to?
- A little weed...

416
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:12,308
Maybe a beer bust later on.
- Really? Cool!

417
00:45:12,892 --> 00:45:15,531
See you around.
- Check you later.

418
00:45:17,938 --> 00:45:22,693
Slate, why're you such a dork?
- What? - "Check you later!"

419
00:45:23,486 --> 00:45:26,159
Get off my case, man!

420
00:45:26,864 --> 00:45:30,413
Chicks don't wanna hear that shit.
- They don't wanna hear anything!

421
00:45:30,993 --> 00:45:35,748
The girls in our classes are all
prudes. Worthless little bitches.

422
00:45:36,373 --> 00:45:39,366
The girls ahead of us were wild.
Our class is worthless.

423
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,799
Maybe you've never got past
the sniffin'-butt stage.

424
00:45:44,382 --> 00:45:47,340
It's quality, not quantity.

425
00:45:47,886 --> 00:45:53,279
Wait till I get to college.
- All I'm gonna do is bang, bang...

426
00:46:19,293 --> 00:46:23,332
Hirschfelder, let's go.
- Let's get outta here.

427
00:46:25,466 --> 00:46:27,138
Come on, man!

428
00:46:28,094 --> 00:46:29,368
It's time to leave!

429
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:31,646
I'll be right back.

430
00:46:41,441 --> 00:46:46,117
You leave, you can't come back.
- Aw, gee. You hear that?

431
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:50,332
If we leave, we can't come back.
- Oh no!

432
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:52,661
What should we do?

433
00:46:55,122 --> 00:47:00,196
What the hell? I was gettin' there.
I had my hand up her shirt.

434
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,379
You were gettin' there?
Hear that? He was getting there!

435
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:10,304
You wouldn't know what to do,
so don't worry about it.

436
00:47:10,888 --> 00:47:14,437
Just 'cause you're striking out!
- That was our last junior high party.

437
00:47:15,017 --> 00:47:19,613
We're in the big time now, where
all the girls will be puttin' out.

438
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:24,223
Your days of pullin' tongue all night
are over. - Yeah, right!

439
00:47:41,961 --> 00:47:46,830
You didn't know she stuffs her bra?
- Those were socks!

440
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:49,458
They looked real to me.

441
00:47:53,098 --> 00:47:55,214
Shit!
- Scatter!

442
00:48:16,038 --> 00:48:19,917
Where you runnin' to?
We ain't gonna hurt ya... much.

443
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:25,002
Hold onto that fence
and just squeal like a pig.

444
00:48:26,924 --> 00:48:29,597
You ready to switch hit?
- Oh yeah. - I'm first.

445
00:48:39,563 --> 00:48:40,757
Bastards!

446
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:49,470
Hey, you guys.

447
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:53,069
Take it easy on the kid.

448
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:56,523
Ladies...

449
00:49:01,752 --> 00:49:03,185
Who is that kid?

450
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:08,581
Some kid we saw that shouldn't
have been at the rec center.

451
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,034
Can we have some of those beers?

452
00:49:11,511 --> 00:49:14,867
One of these?
- Yeah. - Why?

453
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:18,027
Just gimme a beer.
- Get outta here!

454
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,169
Catch!

455
00:49:21,022 --> 00:49:23,490
Tubbs, catch! Get outta here.

456
00:49:24,025 --> 00:49:26,937
What're you wastin' a beer on him for?
- What?

457
00:49:28,404 --> 00:49:32,079
Son of a bitch. - Give 'em a beer.
- This fuckin' sucks!

458
00:49:32,658 --> 00:49:36,287
Last fuckin' day of school.
No fuckin' party... nothin'!

459
00:49:38,206 --> 00:49:40,242
Another fuckin' beer!
- Shut up!

460
00:49:48,216 --> 00:49:52,335
Which one of your friends the beer
this time? - Hey, fuck her. I did.

461
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,079
Bite me!

462
00:49:54,556 --> 00:49:59,186
You wish, asshole!
- Fuck you! - Why're guys such pigs?

463
00:50:00,604 --> 00:50:02,481
What?
- Let's get outta here.

464
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:04,573
We're outta here.

465
00:50:05,275 --> 00:50:07,835
Let me tell ya
what Melba Toast is packin'.

466
00:50:08,362 --> 00:50:13,720
411 positrack out back,
750 double pumper, Edelbroc intakes,

467
00:50:14,368 --> 00:50:19,237
11 to 1 pop-up pistons, Turbo-jet 390
horsepower... some fuckin' muscle!

468
00:50:19,873 --> 00:50:25,152
Man, you got this out of a comic book,
I saw the ad next to the sea monkeys.

469
00:50:25,796 --> 00:50:30,996
See that? That's white lightning!
See the shoes on that thing?

470
00:50:36,558 --> 00:50:37,832
Wow, such an expert.

471
00:50:38,393 --> 00:50:39,621
This is sad.

472
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,537
Let's do something else.
- Like what?

473
00:50:43,064 --> 00:50:47,580
I'm bored.
- Let's split. - Where you wanna go?

474
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:53,314
Pink, hear anything about a beer bust?
- Talk to this man.

475
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,305
Patience, darling. Patience.

476
00:50:58,621 --> 00:51:02,534
What're you doing here?
- I was just about to ask you.

477
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,845
Heard you got busted.
- Yeah.

478
00:51:05,337 --> 00:51:08,329
Hirschfelder, too.
- Really? - Yeah.

479
00:51:08,883 --> 00:51:11,033
Like how bad?
- Bad.

480
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:16,610
Was it O'Bannion?
- Yeah. God, I hate that jerk!

481
00:51:17,224 --> 00:51:18,577
I know.

482
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:23,890
What've you guys been doin'?

483
00:51:24,398 --> 00:51:27,276
Don't know.
Drivin' around mostly.

484
00:51:27,943 --> 00:51:29,820
I didn't know Jodi was your sister.

485
00:51:31,447 --> 00:51:35,122
I hear my name over here? You talkin'
about me? Hey, kiddo.

486
00:51:36,368 --> 00:51:38,518
Heard they got you
pretty bad.

487
00:51:39,038 --> 00:51:42,190
I asked them
to take it easy on you.

488
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:45,140
God, no wonder!

489
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,328
Where'd they find Hirsch?
- Walkin' outta the rec center...

490
00:52:13,824 --> 00:52:18,137
Face it. You couldn't get away.
- Try and outrun those guys!

491
00:52:18,746 --> 00:52:22,864
I'm gonna laugh my ass off
when it's your turn!

492
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:26,610
Last year, they caught
10 freshmen at once.

493
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:31,801
O'Bannion backed over some pizzas
and made 'em eat it. - It's bullshit!

494
00:52:32,427 --> 00:52:37,421
Idiot flunks so he can be a dick
2 years in a row. Is that legal?

495
00:52:38,057 --> 00:52:39,570
Damn you, Carl!

496
00:52:46,023 --> 00:52:50,972
Okay, let me out. Slater,
you fuckin' hippie! Gimme drugs!

497
00:52:51,612 --> 00:52:53,683
Get some from your mother!

498
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:57,794
We just banged your mother!
- Fuck you!

499
00:52:58,704 --> 00:53:03,095
Those guys! What's goin' on?
Haven't seen you in so long.

500
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:07,304
What's happenin'?
- Long time, no see.

501
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:10,686
What've you been up to?
- Same old shit.

502
00:53:11,216 --> 00:53:15,767
Workin' for the city. - Workin' man?
- Thinkin' about goin' back to school.

503
00:53:16,472 --> 00:53:18,861
Back to J.C.?
- Yeah, man.

504
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:21,997
That's where the girls are.

505
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:27,639
I'd just as soon keep workin'.
Keep a little change in my pocket.

506
00:53:28,276 --> 00:53:32,030
Rather than listenin' to some dipshit
who doesn't know what he's sayin'.

507
00:53:32,614 --> 00:53:34,684
I know what you're talkin' about.

508
00:53:36,326 --> 00:53:38,999
So you're a freshman?
- Yeah.

509
00:53:39,537 --> 00:53:42,768
How's this year's crop
of freshman chicks lookin'?

510
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:48,726
You're gonna end up in jail sometime
really soon. - No, man.

511
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,388
That's what I love
about these high school girls:

512
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:58,617
I get older, they stay
the same age. - Yes, they do.

513
00:53:59,224 --> 00:54:00,577
Yes, they do.

514
00:54:01,059 --> 00:54:02,697
Wanna go for a spin?

515
00:54:03,394 --> 00:54:04,464
Shotgun!

516
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,045
Woods.
- I'm here, man.

517
00:54:09,693 --> 00:54:13,083
You gonna come along?
- Yeah, why not?

518
00:54:14,532 --> 00:54:16,204
You boys have fun.

519
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:22,616
I'm gonna give you shotgun,
but only 'cause I'm goin' inside.

520
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:25,565
Keep that in mind.

521
00:54:30,464 --> 00:54:33,422
Whose bowling ball is this?
- It's yours.

522
00:54:33,968 --> 00:54:37,358
What's happenin'? Play a little
foosball? - Yeah. - Alright.

523
00:55:04,958 --> 00:55:06,357
Pull over.

524
00:55:06,835 --> 00:55:09,190
Pull over to the trash can.

525
00:55:32,737 --> 00:55:34,136
Pull over there.

526
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:05,821
Bowling ball.
Throw the bowling ball.

527
00:56:06,855 --> 00:56:07,970
Think I should?

528
00:56:08,649 --> 00:56:10,321
Throw it!

529
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:13,536
You're playin' with the big boys now.

530
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:17,700
Faggot sissy-pussy freshman,
throw it! - Heave it!

531
00:56:25,124 --> 00:56:28,800
Fuck 'em!
- That bowling ball said "Oof!"

532
00:56:29,379 --> 00:56:31,210
To that windshield!

533
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:35,396
You're nuts, Junior!

534
00:56:38,221 --> 00:56:40,815
We're outta beer.
We gotta make a grab-'n'-go stop.

535
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:44,898
I don't have any money. - Who's got
money? - I gave... - Where's yours?

536
00:56:45,478 --> 00:56:48,072
Doesn't matter. Head out that way.

537
00:56:53,153 --> 00:56:56,782
You gonna hoist it? - Yeah.
I need the freshman as a lookout.

538
00:56:57,365 --> 00:57:01,643
I don't wanna get in trouble. Do you,
Pink? - I don't know about this, Don.

539
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:09,351
Be careful, Junior!

540
00:57:10,421 --> 00:57:13,458
Sunflower seeds.
- Zigzags.

541
00:57:14,008 --> 00:57:16,363
I'm not sure about this.

542
00:57:16,886 --> 00:57:20,276
I'm gonna pay for it.
I'm just messin' around with 'em.

543
00:57:20,848 --> 00:57:21,837
Good.

544
00:57:38,657 --> 00:57:40,375
Run! Go!

545
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:49,548
Don't try anything, or
I'll shoot the shit outta you!

546
00:57:50,545 --> 00:57:53,423
Give the beer back, man.
- I paid for the beer.

547
00:57:54,841 --> 00:57:56,991
You busted my mailbox.

548
00:57:58,428 --> 00:58:00,100
Look me in the eye, punk!

549
00:58:00,597 --> 00:58:04,476
Don't know what you're talking about,
but... - You busted it!

550
00:58:09,189 --> 00:58:11,908
Tamperin' with mailboxes
is a felony offense.

551
00:58:13,276 --> 00:58:18,590
I done called the police.
You oughta get outta the car.

552
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:20,766
Just go, man!

553
00:58:21,285 --> 00:58:22,354
Nice and slow...

554
00:58:39,095 --> 00:58:41,165
Fairly uneventful, huh?

555
00:58:43,307 --> 00:58:47,778
Which one of you had the theory
about how President Ford's football

556
00:58:48,396 --> 00:58:51,706
injury is affecting the economy?
- Ford's on the Warren Commission.

557
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:57,191
He's outta there this fall.
We need alcohol. - That's a thought.

558
00:59:24,725 --> 00:59:29,082
Run out to the Centennial and
pick me up a sixer of this stuff.

559
00:59:29,689 --> 00:59:31,645
Think you can do that?

560
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:36,249
Thanks.
- Good luck!

561
00:59:37,489 --> 00:59:40,799
If we're gonna drive around,
we should just do somethin'.

562
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:46,236
You're right, man. I'm gonna get
drunk, maybe get laid

563
00:59:46,873 --> 00:59:50,707
or get in a fight.
- We should be up for anything!

564
00:59:51,294 --> 00:59:54,650
We are, but what?
Don't you ever feel

565
00:59:55,215 --> 00:59:58,890
like everything we do
is just to service the future?

566
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:02,302
It's like it's all preparation.

567
01:00:02,847 --> 01:00:04,246
But what for?

568
01:00:04,724 --> 01:00:06,841
Death.
- Life of the party!

569
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:10,186
It's true.
- But y'know, that's valid.

570
01:00:10,731 --> 01:00:14,849
If we're all gonna die, shouldn't we
be enjoying ourselves now?

571
01:00:15,444 --> 01:00:22,122
I'd like to quit thinking the present
is some minor preamble. - Exactly.

572
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:27,264
Everybody in this car needs
some good old visceral experience.

573
01:00:28,332 --> 01:00:31,369
Remember, eat a green thing every day.

574
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:36,515
And lots of calcium. It's important
for young mothers to have calcium.

575
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,170
Here you are.
- See you tomorrow.

576
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:44,156
How are you this evening?
- Pretty good. How's it goin'?

577
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,919
A lot better when I get off.

578
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,191
Yeah, I hear that.

579
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:59,111
You're 18, right? - Oh, yeah.
Just graduated. - Congratulations.

580
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,862
Off to college in the fall?

581
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:06,599
I'm still not sure.
I'm workin' now. For the city.

582
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:11,202
Thinkin' of holdin' on to the job
for a while. It's money in my pocket.

583
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,148
I hear that. Here's some more.

584
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,390
Have a nice night.
- Thanks.

585
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:19,961
Take it easy.

586
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,261
There you guys are!

587
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,123
What's in the bag?

588
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:33,039
Sixer. You owe me one, man!

589
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:38,356
They busted Hirschfelder, too.
- I heard. - You over at the Emporium?

590
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:42,347
Is that bastard O'Bannion there?

591
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:45,301
Yes. I hate that jerk.

592
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:51,156
You guys wanna get him back?
- Yeah.

593
01:02:00,135 --> 01:02:03,605
They really sold it to you?
- Of course. - Cool!

594
01:02:09,186 --> 01:02:11,017
There ya go, buddy.

595
01:02:11,897 --> 01:02:13,535
Paycheck.
- Oh yeah.

596
01:02:14,024 --> 01:02:15,616
Nice shooting.
- Thanks.

597
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,197
What we got here?

598
01:02:20,697 --> 01:02:25,009
I got your change.
- Don't worry. A beer for my partner.

599
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:27,371
Want a beer?
- Yeah. - Alright.

600
01:02:27,871 --> 01:02:32,423
Guys, party at the moon tower.
You and Benny pick up the first keg.

601
01:02:33,044 --> 01:02:37,754
I'm going to collect for the rest.
Spread the word. At the moon tower!

602
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:40,886
Good game, man. You too.

603
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:46,540
Y'all an embarrassment to the sport.
You should be proud I let you play.

604
01:02:47,183 --> 01:02:52,621
You are the worst pool player. Keep
watching. You might learn something.

605
01:02:53,606 --> 01:02:58,396
You got so many balls on the table
I have to get 'em outta the way!

606
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,309
Corner pocket.

607
01:03:02,031 --> 01:03:04,067
God, you are terrible!

608
01:03:04,576 --> 01:03:09,890
Homo, I hope you're ready to taste
the bitter humiliation of defeat.

609
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:17,219
They're busting Carl Burnett out back.
- What did you say?

610
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,115
He's gettin' busted.

611
01:03:20,676 --> 01:03:23,429
Benny, they got Burnett out back.
- Carl Burnett?

612
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:28,761
Come on! - Let me finish this game.
You hold him for me!

613
01:03:31,562 --> 01:03:36,795
Hey, man. That Julie chick
loves you. Oh yeah. You want her?

614
01:03:37,443 --> 01:03:42,279
Play it cool. Can't let her know you
like her. She'll dump you like that.

615
01:03:42,908 --> 01:03:47,140
If she asks you to ride with her,
say, "Nah, got my own ride,

616
01:03:47,746 --> 01:03:51,580
but maybe I'll see you later."
Sounds stupid but it works.

617
01:03:53,794 --> 01:03:58,345
We got another one. You wouldn't mind
if I went first, would ya?

618
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:03,720
Alright? It's a personal thing between
me and this piece of shit.

619
01:04:04,638 --> 01:04:07,994
So... we meet again, huh?

620
01:04:08,558 --> 01:04:12,551
This motherfucker's mom pulled
a shotgun on me this afternoon.

621
01:04:13,146 --> 01:04:14,374
Fuckin' bitch.

622
01:04:14,856 --> 01:04:19,055
Haven't had any licks yet?
- No.

623
01:04:20,196 --> 01:04:25,589
Another cherry, boys.
Get the fuck against the wall!

624
01:04:26,244 --> 01:04:30,283
You have to be the dumbest
freshman cocksucker out tonight!

625
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:35,636
You knew I was gonna find you!
I dedicate this first lick

626
01:04:36,254 --> 01:04:37,812
to your mother.

627
01:04:38,381 --> 01:04:39,655
Fucker!

628
01:04:43,886 --> 01:04:44,875
Not yet.

629
01:04:46,097 --> 01:04:47,610
It's gettin' warmer.

630
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:49,088
What the fuck?

631
01:04:53,688 --> 01:04:56,362
Remember me, you pig?

632
01:05:10,497 --> 01:05:12,010
Hurry, man!

633
01:05:12,499 --> 01:05:16,572
It was beautiful! You should've seen
the look on that fuck's face!

634
01:05:22,134 --> 01:05:26,969
You let that little fuck get away!
What's the matter with you? Pitiful!

635
01:05:28,682 --> 01:05:31,993
Fuck!
Freshman shitheads!

636
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:34,439
What the fuck are you lookin' at?

637
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:37,021
Kick your fuckin' ass right now!

638
01:05:38,818 --> 01:05:39,933
Pussy!

639
01:05:46,117 --> 01:05:48,790
What're you smilin' at?
Freshman faggot!

640
01:05:51,122 --> 01:05:52,350
Fuck you.

641
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,725
Fuck all of you!

642
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:00,146
Goddamn it!

643
01:06:23,781 --> 01:06:28,491
I swore I'd never go to a Top Notch.
And I am sorting through jalapeno

644
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:32,112
burgers and soggy fries. Take 'em.

645
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:35,819
Oh Christ!

646
01:06:37,169 --> 01:06:38,602
How ya doin'?

647
01:06:40,506 --> 01:06:41,495
Pretty good.

648
01:06:42,258 --> 01:06:46,457
Cool. Heard about the party
being busted? - Oh yeah.

649
01:06:47,055 --> 01:06:52,527
Not to worry. There's a new fiesta
in the making. At the moon tower.

650
01:06:53,186 --> 01:06:56,940
Full kegs, everybody's gonna be there.
You oughta go.

651
01:06:57,858 --> 01:07:00,531
Okay.
- We'll be there.

652
01:07:01,111 --> 01:07:02,510
So ya need a ride?

653
01:07:03,238 --> 01:07:05,354
I got my own car. Thanks.

654
01:07:05,866 --> 01:07:10,986
Ditch the two geeks and get in
with us, but that's all right.

655
01:07:12,122 --> 01:07:13,157
I'll see you there.

656
01:07:16,418 --> 01:07:19,934
I love those redheads, man.
- I know you.

657
01:07:20,715 --> 01:07:23,149
We had geography together.

658
01:07:26,971 --> 01:07:30,520
Oh God!
- What a dick. - That was so creepy!

659
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:35,616
Why're you smilin'?
- I thought he was cute. - Cute?

660
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:41,384
When he graduated we were 3.
Cynthia, what're you thinking?

661
01:07:43,196 --> 01:07:44,914
I don't know.

662
01:07:46,824 --> 01:07:49,861
We gonna still go?
- Huh? - Yeah.

663
01:08:16,063 --> 01:08:21,456
You better have your wood screws. I'm
gonna blow your doors off! - Fuck you!

664
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:38,943
Someone's tokin' some reefer.

665
01:09:43,195 --> 01:09:47,347
Hey, man, slow down. What's up?
- How's it going? - What'd you say?

666
01:09:48,116 --> 01:09:49,151
When?

667
01:09:50,076 --> 01:09:52,670
Just now, when you walked past.

668
01:09:53,246 --> 01:09:54,361
About what?

669
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:57,925
You said,
"Someone's tokin' some reefer."

670
01:09:59,085 --> 01:10:01,883
It was just an observation.

671
01:10:02,422 --> 01:10:06,700
Oh, an observation? And who the hell
are you? Isaac fuckin' Newton?

672
01:10:07,302 --> 01:10:09,941
I'm the one smokin' marijuana, fucker!

673
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:13,782
You got a problem with that?
- No. - Why'd you say that?

674
01:10:14,518 --> 01:10:17,191
Don't let your mouth write a check
your butt can't cash.

675
01:10:17,729 --> 01:10:21,803
So I'm blazin' with my friends, I'm a
fuckin' pothead. What's it to you?

676
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:26,110
Outta observations? Observe while
I punch your teeth down your throat!

677
01:10:26,697 --> 01:10:30,975
Come on, dude. Relax.
- I'll be watchin' you, Newton!

678
01:10:32,036 --> 01:10:36,029
I only came here to do 2 things:
Kick ass and drink some beer.

679
01:10:36,707 --> 01:10:38,823
Looks like we're almost outta beer.

680
01:10:39,418 --> 01:10:41,488
You okay, man?

681
01:10:48,386 --> 01:10:50,183
Why's it called the moon tower?

682
01:10:51,055 --> 01:10:55,333
They put it up when they were
buildin' the power plant.

683
01:10:55,936 --> 01:11:00,407
Actually, it's a good idea. You got
a full moon out here every day.

684
01:11:01,608 --> 01:11:05,567
But nothing's ever been repaired.
This whole place could fall down.

685
01:11:06,155 --> 01:11:08,874
So you better
watch your step, Junior.

686
01:11:10,284 --> 01:11:14,436
This place used to be off-limits,
'cause some drunk freshman fell off.

687
01:11:15,038 --> 01:11:18,394
He went right down the middle,
smackin' his head on every beam.

688
01:11:18,959 --> 01:11:24,113
Doesn't hurt after the first couple.
Autopsy said he had 1 beer. You?

689
01:11:25,215 --> 01:11:28,685
Four.
- You're dead. You're so dead.

690
01:11:30,637 --> 01:11:34,153
Look at the bloodstains.
- Shut up.

691
01:11:36,394 --> 01:11:40,990
I'm gonna get that guy. - What guy?
- That asshole on the way in. Clint.

692
01:11:41,691 --> 01:11:46,481
That super dominant male greaser.
- I wouldn't suggest that, Mike.

693
01:11:47,113 --> 01:11:51,789
I got it all planned. Most fights
never get past a punch or two.

694
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:56,005
An instinct not to upset the herd.
I gotta get in one good punch,

695
01:11:56,581 --> 01:12:00,893
play defense and wait.
- What? - What're you talking about?

696
01:12:01,503 --> 01:12:06,099
At first, I was relieved to get out,
but now there's this humiliation

697
01:12:06,716 --> 01:12:10,630
that's gonna be with me forever.
I'm not gonna let this

698
01:12:11,222 --> 01:12:15,454
contribute to me being an ineffectual
nothing the rest of my life.

699
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:22,138
Look at this fuckin' town!
It's dead!

700
01:12:25,903 --> 01:12:29,578
Lmagine how many people
out there now are fuckin'!

701
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:34,946
Just going at it.

702
01:12:41,335 --> 01:12:45,045
Remember me?
- Sure. Sabrina, right? - Right.

703
01:12:45,632 --> 01:12:49,181
How ya doin'?
- Let's go. - What brings you here?

704
01:12:49,761 --> 01:12:51,797
Just hanging out.

705
01:12:54,432 --> 01:12:56,787
You havin' fun?
- Yeah.

706
01:12:58,812 --> 01:13:02,043
Does your offer still stand?

707
01:13:04,067 --> 01:13:07,946
What am I supposed to say?
Anything you want.

708
01:13:16,872 --> 01:13:20,912
Why'd we even come here?
I always feel out of place.

709
01:13:21,502 --> 01:13:24,221
You're tellin' me!
I'm being stalked by a Nazi.

710
01:13:24,881 --> 01:13:26,553
That reefer I smell on you?

711
01:13:27,049 --> 01:13:31,679
Coach is right. You're runnin' with
that bad crowd. Attitude adjustment!

712
01:13:32,305 --> 01:13:35,695
Am I the only athlete at this party,
you two drunks?

713
01:13:36,267 --> 01:13:41,261
Coach is right. Those guys don't care
if we win or lose.

714
01:13:42,398 --> 01:13:44,514
Check this out. Watch this.

715
01:13:45,735 --> 01:13:46,850
Watch me...

716
01:13:48,362 --> 01:13:51,160
Oh no, it's the cops! Look!

717
01:13:52,742 --> 01:13:53,777
It was so easy!

718
01:13:54,368 --> 01:13:57,566
Oh, shit. He needs another drink.

719
01:14:38,748 --> 01:14:40,466
Hey, Mitch!

720
01:14:42,043 --> 01:14:44,034
How's it goin'?
- Wonderin' if you were around.

721
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:54,181
Just wanted to talk.
Are you quittin' football?

722
01:14:56,182 --> 01:15:00,380
Or you don't wanna sign the pledge?
That's what it is.

723
01:15:02,021 --> 01:15:03,852
I don't know.

724
01:15:04,607 --> 01:15:07,485
Maybe I'm not into it anymore.

725
01:15:08,946 --> 01:15:11,255
"You're not into any of it"?

726
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:17,079
The biggest mistake of your life.
No one quits senior year.

727
01:15:17,663 --> 01:15:22,657
Especially if you're starting
quarterback. We got a shot at state.

728
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:26,608
We'll kick some butt this year.

729
01:15:27,298 --> 01:15:30,449
It's what we've been working for
all our lives.

730
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:33,240
Me and you wanna be champions!

731
01:15:34,138 --> 01:15:35,127
All I'm sayin' is

732
01:15:36,182 --> 01:15:42,371
if I do play next year, it's gonna be
on my terms, not theirs.

733
01:15:43,355 --> 01:15:49,795
Remember, Pink. It ain't just about
you. It's about us: Me, Donny, Mel.

734
01:15:50,489 --> 01:15:54,243
You'll be fuckin' us over!
Or maybe you're just scared.

735
01:15:56,203 --> 01:15:58,319
Have a nice night.

736
01:16:29,445 --> 01:16:32,403
Watch them fly...

737
01:16:36,869 --> 01:16:38,860
...away.

738
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:44,972
You know what that song's about?

739
01:16:45,503 --> 01:16:47,095
It's about aliens.

740
01:16:48,714 --> 01:16:54,425
We're the aliens. We're the savages.
- That song's about that?

741
01:16:55,096 --> 01:16:57,452
Yeah, that song's about that.
- About aliens?

742
01:16:57,975 --> 01:17:03,607
Yeah! This country was founded by
people who were into aliens.

743
01:17:04,273 --> 01:17:09,347
George Washington was in a cult
that was into aliens. You didn't know?

744
01:17:09,987 --> 01:17:13,457
No...
- They were way into that stuff!

745
01:17:14,032 --> 01:17:17,388
The every-other-decade theory:
The 50s were boring,

746
01:17:17,953 --> 01:17:22,868
the 60s rocked,
and the 70s obviously sucked.

747
01:17:24,251 --> 01:17:26,640
Maybe the 80s will be radical.

748
01:17:27,171 --> 01:17:30,607
We'll be in our 20s,
and it can't get any worse.

749
01:17:48,902 --> 01:17:53,896
Wait a minute! Who put the keg
in the woods? - I don't know.

750
01:17:54,532 --> 01:17:57,888
This is where they told me
it would be. - Oh yeah?

751
01:17:58,495 --> 01:18:01,009
I don't think we need beer anyway.

752
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:07,072
George toked weed. - Absolutely!
Are you kiddin' me?

753
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:12,829
He grew fields of that stuff.
- Up in Mount Vernon.

754
01:18:13,469 --> 01:18:15,346
All over the country.

755
01:18:15,846 --> 01:18:20,362
He had people growin' it all over.
The whole country was getting high.

756
01:18:20,976 --> 01:18:24,412
'Cause he knew
he was onto something.

757
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:30,134
He knew it'd be a good cash crop for
the southern states. So he grew it.

758
01:18:30,778 --> 01:18:36,330
Behind every good man, there's a
woman. That was Martha Washington.

759
01:18:36,992 --> 01:18:41,907
She'd have a big bowl
waiting for him when he'd come in.

760
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:45,055
She was a hip, a hip lady, man.

761
01:19:01,184 --> 01:19:03,903
Wait.
- What? - What're you doin'?

762
01:19:05,856 --> 01:19:08,324
Don't you have a girlfriend?

763
01:19:09,985 --> 01:19:12,818
What girlfriend?
- What's her name?

764
01:19:13,363 --> 01:19:15,081
Simone?

765
01:19:21,372 --> 01:19:25,081
She was real cool, too.
She'd harvest the crops.

766
01:19:25,668 --> 01:19:31,300
She'd put it in bushels and sell it
to make ends meet.

767
01:19:31,966 --> 01:19:36,801
Ever look at a dollar bill?
There's some spooky stuff going on.

768
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:38,988
It's green, too!

769
01:19:39,765 --> 01:19:41,562
Later.
- See you.

770
01:19:42,059 --> 01:19:46,530
What was that? - What were you doin'?
- What you wish you were doin'.

771
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:49,059
Look at your boy.
- Look at your boy.

772
01:19:49,567 --> 01:19:50,556
Kramer!

773
01:19:52,153 --> 01:19:55,589
Yeah, you, freshman!
Right here, buddy!

774
01:19:56,657 --> 01:19:59,331
He waves at us.
- What is this wave shit?

775
01:20:00,078 --> 01:20:01,067
Over here.

776
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:02,979
Now!

777
01:20:03,707 --> 01:20:04,696
Come on.

778
01:20:05,542 --> 01:20:08,978
Shit, I should go.
- I guess you should.

779
01:20:09,546 --> 01:20:11,855
I'll be back.

780
01:20:13,258 --> 01:20:17,934
He's like Casanova. Amazing!
- Look at that shit-eatin' grin.

781
01:20:18,555 --> 01:20:24,073
Not bad for a freshman, but watch out
for them older girls. - Hey,

782
01:20:26,563 --> 01:20:32,115
we wanna know something: Gonna
fuck that, or are you a wimp?

783
01:20:32,778 --> 01:20:35,452
How do you know
I haven't already?

784
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:39,585
Get outta here.
It's past your bedtime! Run along!

785
01:20:41,913 --> 01:20:45,144
Go get a ride with her.
Say we left.

786
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,983
It will work.

787
01:20:48,545 --> 01:20:50,775
Kramer, show it to her!

788
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:02,862
Air raid, freshman.

789
01:21:03,685 --> 01:21:04,674
What?

790
01:21:05,186 --> 01:21:06,858
Air raid, freshman.

791
01:21:07,355 --> 01:21:11,588
Darla... - This is between
me and her. She better be

792
01:21:12,194 --> 01:21:13,707
on the ground in 5 seconds!

793
01:21:16,031 --> 01:21:19,148
She doesn't have to air raid,
'cause she's with me, okay.

794
01:21:21,662 --> 01:21:22,936
Air raid, or it's your ass!

795
01:21:23,414 --> 01:21:25,166
Don't do it, Sabrina.

796
01:21:25,749 --> 01:21:27,068
Oh, that's it.

797
01:21:28,043 --> 01:21:29,442
Miss Hot Stuff.

798
01:21:32,214 --> 01:21:36,253
I'm going to make the next year
of your life a living hell.

799
01:21:43,392 --> 01:21:45,668
Lick me, all of you!

800
01:21:48,648 --> 01:21:49,842
Good for you.

801
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:56,684
Don't air raid for that bitch.
It's like that Clint fucker.

802
01:21:57,324 --> 01:21:59,235
Hey, motherfucker!
- Alright, okay, Mike.

803
01:21:59,743 --> 01:22:01,620
Dominant male monkey motherfucker!

804
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:09,890
Tara. - I never met a "Tara" before.
You're my first.

805
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:17,279
He did it. I can't believe it!

806
01:22:18,261 --> 01:22:21,094
I fuckin' knew I should've
kicked your ass. Come on!

807
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:31,177
You guys, that's Mike.
- It's Clint. - That crazy bastard.

808
01:22:42,411 --> 01:22:44,686
You like this, motherfucker?

809
01:22:56,134 --> 01:22:58,933
You're fuckin' dead, faschist!

810
01:23:02,808 --> 01:23:04,161
You're dead!

811
01:23:34,632 --> 01:23:36,463
Hey, little brother.

812
01:23:37,844 --> 01:23:40,483
That a beer?
- Yes, it is.

813
01:23:41,014 --> 01:23:45,212
You had more than one?
- A few. Nobody's counting.

814
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:47,880
Hey, how ya doin'?

815
01:23:49,105 --> 01:23:52,780
I should get used to you being
at the same social functions as me.

816
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:56,635
And hanging out
with people I know.

817
01:23:57,197 --> 01:24:01,713
What time are you supposed to be home?
- I don't know. Couple of hours ago.

818
01:24:03,203 --> 01:24:06,513
Bullshit!
That's major bullshit.

819
01:24:07,081 --> 01:24:11,439
Mom barely let me outta the house
when I was your age.

820
01:24:12,046 --> 01:24:16,801
Don't think she's not gonna be
waiting up. I've been through it.

821
01:24:17,426 --> 01:24:22,705
And she's tough. - Just don't ask her
to take it easy on me, please.

822
01:24:24,058 --> 01:24:27,607
What's that supposed to mean?
Take it easy on him?

823
01:24:28,187 --> 01:24:31,338
Let's go smoke that joint.
- He's in for a surprise.

824
01:24:50,961 --> 01:24:51,950
Alright!

825
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,835
Thanks a lot, man.
- No worries. Take care.

826
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:01,183
I'll pick you up tomorrow at 4.
- Okay.

827
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:07,800
Aerosmith, 3 weeks, front-row seats.
- Alright. I won't forget.

828
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:14,728
Who's buying breakfast?
- Not me. - I will, I guess.

829
01:25:15,318 --> 01:25:19,357
You comin' along? - Sure.
- Night, John Boy, Ali.

830
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:25,899
"Would-a-been!"
- Pink, what's happenin'?

831
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:30,991
Cynthia, man. I like it, man.
- Red's a good color for you.

832
01:25:31,586 --> 01:25:32,701
My favorite color.

833
01:25:33,171 --> 01:25:37,164
Have you seen Jodi around?
- She left your ass. - Really?

834
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:40,397
Ya win some, ya lose some.

835
01:25:44,015 --> 01:25:48,247
Slater, you look good.
- What's goin' on? - What's goin' on?

836
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:51,970
Nothing.
- What time is it?

837
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:58,383
Let's go smoke a joint on the
50-yard line, to honor Coach Conrad!

838
01:25:59,615 --> 01:26:01,287
We're there.
- Great idea.

839
01:26:02,284 --> 01:26:05,913
Man with the plan!
- Wanna come with me? - Okay.

840
01:26:08,665 --> 01:26:12,544
Joint subcommittee meeting
on the 50-yard line in 15.

841
01:26:13,128 --> 01:26:17,679
Don, y'all ride with me. Let's hit it!
- This is cashed, man!

842
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:23,374
Cashed! Ride with us, but in the back,
'cause I gotta shotgun you.

843
01:26:25,974 --> 01:26:28,442
Watch the leather.

844
01:26:34,567 --> 01:26:40,881
Don't you quit. You wanna hit him?
- Jesus, you're wearin' Rebel gray.

845
01:26:41,574 --> 01:26:46,090
Now break down!
Break down!

846
01:26:46,704 --> 01:26:51,778
You don't deserve to wear
that Rebel gray!

847
01:26:52,418 --> 01:26:56,411
You won't hit him?
"Only the strong survive!"

848
01:26:57,006 --> 01:26:59,884
That's it! Only the strong survive!

849
01:27:00,927 --> 01:27:03,725
Where's your pitch?
Hit your goddamn pitch!

850
01:27:13,107 --> 01:27:15,746
My grandmother can hit harder!

851
01:27:16,277 --> 01:27:18,108
What the fuck, man?

852
01:27:18,612 --> 01:27:23,447
She's a 8'4", 652-pound hairy-ass
gorilla and runs a 40 in 10.2.

853
01:27:24,326 --> 01:27:28,205
She's gotten bigger. She was
only 6'2", 195 in my day.

854
01:27:28,789 --> 01:27:32,418
Still drivin' that Mack truck, though.
- Pink, you got my papers?

855
01:27:33,002 --> 01:27:34,594
In my glove compartment.

856
01:27:35,087 --> 01:27:39,558
I got 'em. Hit me on the slant.
Gimme the keys to an inside.

857
01:27:40,676 --> 01:27:44,988
Marijuana on one.
- Reefer on two.

858
01:27:58,862 --> 01:28:03,890
Looks pretty good, huh? - Yeah.
- Could be a little more symmetrical.

859
01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:09,187
Does that hurt? Sorry.
- It's a bruise.

860
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:12,892
I don't know.
Let me ask you something.

861
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:18,094
I got some pretty good ones in there.
You wouldn't say I got my ass kicked.

862
01:28:18,715 --> 01:28:23,631
After a couple of years people won't
remember if you won or lost.

863
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:28,541
You're right, 'cause I read about
a Jackson Pollock

864
01:28:29,143 --> 01:28:33,421
or Ernest Hemingway. You never read
who won or lost a brawl.

865
01:28:34,023 --> 01:28:38,016
Thanks for the ride
and breakfast. - No problem.

866
01:28:38,611 --> 01:28:43,810
Nice to pile on some pancakes
and syrup after a night of beer.

867
01:28:58,548 --> 01:28:59,618
Good night.

868
01:29:18,694 --> 01:29:22,050
Hope you're not grounded
or anything. - Thanks.

869
01:29:24,616 --> 01:29:30,373
"...not to indulge in drugs, alcohol
sex, or any other illegal activity."

870
01:29:32,374 --> 01:29:35,014
Slater, babe.
Found that in your glove compartment.

871
01:29:35,962 --> 01:29:38,874
You're the third person
who's given me this.

872
01:29:40,049 --> 01:29:42,119
What you gonna do?

873
01:29:42,635 --> 01:29:45,433
I don't know.
Probably end up signin'.

874
01:29:45,972 --> 01:29:48,770
It's the same bullshit
they tried to pull in my day.

875
01:29:49,309 --> 01:29:53,666
If it ain't that, it's some other
choice they're gonna make for you.

876
01:29:54,272 --> 01:29:58,788
Do what Randall "Pink" Floyd
wants to do. Let me tell ya this:

877
01:29:59,402 --> 01:30:03,111
The older you get, the more rules they
are gonna try to get you to follow.

878
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:07,088
You just gotta keep livin', man.
L-I-V-I-N!

879
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:13,284
If you sign that, you should throw
a little grass in the middle.

880
01:30:13,876 --> 01:30:18,552
Roll it up, sign the joint, man.
Tell 'em! - That's what I'll do.

881
01:30:19,173 --> 01:30:24,725
Assholes. - A bunch of assholes, but
we've had good times here, Pink.

882
01:30:25,387 --> 01:30:29,585
Yeah, I can't believe this.
You act like you're so oppressed.

883
01:30:30,184 --> 01:30:34,416
You guys are kings of the school!
You get away with whatever you want.

884
01:30:35,022 --> 01:30:39,174
If I ever start referring to these as
the best years of my life,

885
01:30:40,569 --> 01:30:42,321
remind me to kill myself.

886
01:30:42,822 --> 01:30:46,371
All I'm sayin' is
I just wanna look back and say:

887
01:30:46,951 --> 01:30:50,831
I did it the best I could
while stuck in this place,

888
01:30:51,414 --> 01:30:54,690
had as much fun as I could
while stuck in this place,

889
01:30:55,252 --> 01:30:58,244
played as hard as I could
while stuck in this place,

890
01:30:58,797 --> 01:31:03,154
dogged as many chicks as I could
while stuck in this place.

891
01:31:04,302 --> 01:31:07,533
Right, Mr. Premature Ejaculation!

892
01:31:15,897 --> 01:31:17,091
That the cops?
- What...?

893
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:21,210
All of you! Get over here!

894
01:31:21,736 --> 01:31:26,447
Now! - Ditch that pot! Is it illegal
to be on the football field?

895
01:31:31,247 --> 01:31:35,240
Come on, Slater. - What'd we do?
- Got any Visine?

896
01:31:36,544 --> 01:31:38,819
I can't believe this.

897
01:31:39,589 --> 01:31:43,343
If it ain't Richard Wrath!
How ya doin', Dick?

898
01:31:43,926 --> 01:31:47,521
Well, well,
a couple of football players!

899
01:31:49,765 --> 01:31:53,201
Wonder what Coach is gonna think.
Line up.

900
01:31:56,564 --> 01:32:00,956
Wooderson? - Slavey? - Reliving
old glories on the football field?

901
01:32:02,988 --> 01:32:07,823
Get through! You shouldn't be mad that
I got All-District and you didn't.

902
01:32:42,237 --> 01:32:44,307
Get your
scrawny butts over here!

903
01:32:48,409 --> 01:32:49,478
Mornin', Coach!

904
01:32:51,496 --> 01:32:55,171
Why am I gettin' wake-up calls
from the cops?

905
01:32:55,750 --> 01:33:00,187
They just left.
- False alarm. - Come here, Randy.

906
01:33:03,383 --> 01:33:05,260
You been out with those losers?

907
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:09,833
Hey, Coach Conrad, remember me?
Second-period gym class?

908
01:33:11,809 --> 01:33:15,722
That's the kind of people I mean.
Trouble means nothing to that bunch.

909
01:33:16,313 --> 01:33:17,905
You're the one with something to lose.

910
01:33:19,233 --> 01:33:23,465
You don't even know them.
How can you talk that way?

911
01:33:24,071 --> 01:33:28,781
I'm willing to wipe the slate clean
and forget. I want you to get

912
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:32,402
your priorities straightened out,
quit hangin' out with hoodlums,

913
01:33:32,955 --> 01:33:36,311
and sign your commitment to your team.
Have you done that yet?

914
01:33:37,418 --> 01:33:41,775
I'm still thinkin'. - No one's paying
you to think about it. Just do it!

915
01:33:43,716 --> 01:33:45,786
You know, Coach?

916
01:33:46,635 --> 01:33:51,630
I gotta get goin'. Me and my loser
friends gotta get Aerosmith tickets.

917
01:33:52,267 --> 01:33:53,780
Top priority of the summer.

918
01:33:58,023 --> 01:34:01,459
Oh, Coach, I forgot.

919
01:34:04,529 --> 01:34:08,886
I might play ball,
but I will never sign that!

920
01:34:20,378 --> 01:34:21,493
Let's rock and roll!

921
01:34:22,339 --> 01:34:24,979
Alright, man. Livin'.

922
01:34:25,885 --> 01:34:31,994
I'm gettin' my third wind.
You gonna come? - Shotgun!

923
01:34:34,477 --> 01:34:37,355
You guys not goin'?
- Can I use your keys?

924
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:41,109
Time to boogie on outta here.
- Hey.

925
01:34:41,651 --> 01:34:43,528
So that's that?

926
01:34:50,493 --> 01:34:52,370
I never get shotgun!

927
01:35:08,887 --> 01:35:10,240
Hi, Mom.

928
01:35:10,722 --> 01:35:16,240
This is your one
"get-outta-jail-free" card.

929
01:35:16,895 --> 01:35:19,932
Hope you enjoyed it.
- No.

930
01:35:20,482 --> 01:35:25,397
Your sister told me everything, so
I've decide to make this deal.

931
01:35:26,029 --> 01:35:29,305
I'm gonna be open-minded this time.

932
01:35:29,867 --> 01:35:34,782
Next time you come in at sunrise,
we've got problems.

933
01:35:42,881 --> 01:35:46,510
And who is this older girl
who gave you a ride?

934
01:35:47,218 --> 01:35:48,776
She's just like...

935
01:35:49,846 --> 01:35:51,199
Have you been drinking?

936
01:35:52,223 --> 01:35:53,258
No!

937
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,089
Are you drunk?

938
01:35:56,305 --> 01:36:56,847
