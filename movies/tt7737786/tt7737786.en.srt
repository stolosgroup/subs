3
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,445
Hey, boss. What are you
still doing here, man?

4
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:54,323
- I thought you were taking off early.
- Yeah, well, I'm trying to.

5
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,451
Why hasn't
the concrete pour started yet?

6
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:00,412
The first truck blew a hose in the alley.
They're fixing it now.

7
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,374
It's always something,
huh?

8
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,543
Why don't you just
take off, man? We got this.

9
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,795
No, no. I know you do,
but I gotta sign the invoice.

10
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,464
Just sign it now.
I'll hold on to it until we're finished.

11
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,469
All right.

12
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:16,971
Thanks, Bobby.

13
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,639
But you still call me
when it's done, okay?

14
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,849
- You got it, boss.
- All right.

15
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,026
...stack of papers here
with headlines, but I can promise you,

16
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,071
the only thing people wanna
talk about today is this Clarke,

17
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,740
this interstellar comet.

18
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,493
You know, they are saying this'll be
the closest comet flyby in history,

19
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,538
which means we're gonna be able to see
this thing even in bright daylight.

20
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,790
- It's amazing.
- Yeah.

21
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,917
They only
discovered this thing a few weeks ago.

22
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,336
NASA's saying it appeared out of
nowhere from a different solar system.

23
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,421
This is just...

24
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,062
- You scared me. I didn't hear you.
- Sorry.

25
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,485
- What time is it? I thought we said 7:00.
- Uh... Um...

26
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,278
I finished work early.

27
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,698
- I can hang downstairs if you want.
- That's okay.

28
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:42,992
I'm done.

29
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:45,869
How many miles?

30
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,749
- Five.
- Five. Good.

31
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,422
Is the party still on
for tomorrow?

32
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,840
Are you kidding?

33
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,300
Nathan's invited
half the block already.

34
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,305
How's he doing?

35
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,474
He's okay.

36
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,571
How long is this gonna be awkward for?

37
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,407
I don't know, John. It's not like
I'm trying to make it that way.

38
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,701
'Cause if you're just
doing this for Nathan,

39
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,661
- I'm not. I'm not.
- I... I don't...

40
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,664
I'm not.

41
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:32,332
All right.

42
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,877
I'm just... just checking.

43
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,920
It's just gonna take
some time...

44
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,965
and some effort
from the both of us.

45
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,388
We can do this, Ali.

46
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,105
All right,
I'm gonna go shower.

47
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,483
I'll call Deb, and I'll
tell him to come home.

48
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,401
- Will you make sure he washes his hands?
- Yeah.

49
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:00,486
Thanks.

50
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,541
Hey.

51
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,835
- Dad!
- Hey.

52
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,755
- I'm glad you're home.
- Me too.

53
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,554
Are you still liking
this drafting table, kiddo?

54
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,556
Yeah, I can draw
really good on it.

55
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,226
Yeah, I see that. Wow.

56
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,269
I like this one.
Come here.

57
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,689
God, you're really
a great artist, bud.

58
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:38,857
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

59
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,860
- So, how's school?
- Good.

60
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,780
Yeah? Your teachers
talking about this thing?

61
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:49,076
Yeah. Mr. Williams said Clarke is
like a big snowball, but made of gas.

62
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,619
Wow.

63
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,330
Asteroids are made of farts.
Okay. I got it.

64
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,584
No. Clarke is a comet,
silly, not an asteroid.

65
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,795
Oh, a comet. I didn't know
there was a difference.

66
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,297
Comets move faster,
like, way, way faster.

67
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,883
Did you know that Clarke was
from a different solar system?

68
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,802
Which is why they don't
know much about it.

69
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,221
Ah. Well,
now I know two things.

70
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,597
What?

71
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,767
That you and comets
are made of farts.

72
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,060
- No, you are.
- No, you are!

73
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,395
No, you are!

74
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,480
No, you are! Come here.

75
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,820
How's this thing
working out?

76
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,115
- Is it better than the shots?
- Way better.

77
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,199
Yeah?

78
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:30,993
Good.

79
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,664
What's the matter, buddy?

80
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,587
Is Mom gonna
make you leave again?

81
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,554
Your mom and I, we got
some things to work out.

82
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,932
But no matter what...

83
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,393
Look at me, son.

84
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,730
I'm always gonna be
your father, all right?

85
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,440
I'm never gonna leave you.

86
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,984
I love you, kiddo.

87
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,114
Scientists continue
to study Clarke,

88
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:12,034
the interstellar comet
discovered only weeks ago.

89
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,244
Unlike most comets
or even asteroids,

90
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,830
which move much slower
and are easier to track,

91
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,124
this particular comet
is not a singular body,

92
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,460
but made up of hundreds
of pieces of rock and ice

93
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,795
that have broken up
over millions of years.

94
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,340
In fact, Clarke's
fragment trail is so long,

95
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,635
the end stretches beyond what
astronomers can actually see.

96
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,136
In other news,
Wall Street's...

97
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,263
Nathan, come on.
Homework.

98
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,724
The Dow Jones closed
down over 2.5% today.

99
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,142
Can you help me?

100
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,436
- All right, what do we got?
- Fractions.

101
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,897
- I thought you were good at math.
- I don't like fractions.

102
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,399
They're hard.

103
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,361
Well, it's okay for it to be hard,
because fractions and math are important.

104
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:51,198
You think your dad can build
skyscrapers without being good at math?

105
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,493
- You wanna build skyscrapers like me?
- Yeah.

106
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,828
Come on.
I'll give you a hand.

107
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:02,334
All right. So, which figures
are divided into equal parts?

108
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,814
Guest room it is.

109
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,173
- Cool binos, bud.
- I don't see Clarke.

110
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,800
Maybe he's still sleeping.

111
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,719
Dad.

112
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,724
...developments overnight.

113
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,268
Some of Clarke's larger fragments are
now expected to enter our atmosphere.

114
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,980
According to scientists, when the
largest fragments get closer to the sun,

115
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,525
they heat up and they expel jets of
gas, changing their trajectory.

116
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,945
Yes, but they're also saying not to worry,
that these things won't hit the ground.

117
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,364
They're gonna burn up as they
pass through our atmosphere.

118
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,159
But I bet you,
it's gonna make one heck of a show.

119
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,494
Hey, John!
Welcome back, amigo!

120
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,163
- Hey, Ed. How you doing?
- Good.

121
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,166
- How are things?
- Good.

122
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,298
- Still coming over later?
- You know I'd never miss a free meal.

123
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,008
Oh, I know that.

124
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,676
See you in a bit.

125
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,347
Hey. We're gonna need
some more beer and wine.

126
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,849
Can you go to the store for me?
People are gonna be here in an hour.

127
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,894
- Now? I'm just about to start the grill.
- Well, I need to get ready.

128
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,479
People are gonna be here soon.

129
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,193
Okay. Okay.

130
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,986
You need anything else while
I'm there? Just so I know.

131
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,071
No.

132
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,114
All right.

133
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,784
Actually,
get some more hot-dog buns.

134
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,787
And, um, some mustard.
We only have the spicy kind.

135
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,580
Thanks.

136
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,304
All right, kiddo.

137
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:20,889
Can I get a toy?

138
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,100
If you listen and hurry.

139
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,102
Whoa.

140
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,650
Where are they going?

141
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,278
I don't know.

142
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,158
Look! There's Clarke!

143
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,453
Whoa.

144
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,790
Looks pretty cool, huh?

145
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,337
All right,
let's hurry up.

146
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,763
Hey, Nathan, come on.

147
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,855
All right.
Some Bud Light...

148
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,608
Can we get juice boxes,
too?

149
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,403
All right.

150
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,487
Okay.

151
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,698
Juices.

152
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,367
- Which one do you want?
- Oh!

153
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,286
I like those ones.

154
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,413
Okay.
So then, those ones.

155
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,835
That's loud, Dad.
What is it?

156
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,671
Must be an AMBER Alert.

157
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,090
"Presidential Alert"?

158
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,233
Hello?

159
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,944
This is a
Presidential Alert. It is not a test.

160
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,323
John Allan Garrity,

161
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,159
you have been selected for
emergency shelter relocation

162
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,537
with Allison Rose Garrity,

163
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,165
Nathan Beckett Garrity.

164
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,627
You are allowed one personal bag.
There are no exceptions.

165
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,796
Please have
Allison Rose Garrity...

166
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,011
...Nathan Beckett Garrity

167
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,721
standing by
for more information.

168
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,097
This is not a test.

169
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,854
All right. Nathan, come on.
We gotta go.

170
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,774
- But you said I can get a toy.
- We'll get one next time. Come on.

171
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,153
That's right.
It's a rewarding experience.

172
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,150
- There they are.
- About time, man.

173
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,194
Sit over here.

174
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,988
Hi. Hi.

175
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,531
Hey.

176
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,283
John.
Good to see you again, man.

177
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,118
You too, Kenny.
Hey, Deb.

178
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,538
Hey, buddy.

179
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,582
...as it heads
toward the Atlantic...

180
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,084
You're just in time.
One of the first chunks is about to hit.

181
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,253
- Clarke is gonna hit?
- Only part of it.

182
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,796
Don't worry,
it's going into the ocean.

183
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,464
Dad, come
and sit with me!

184
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,758
Yeah, I just gotta go
talk to your mom for a second.

185
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,427
Hey.

186
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,637
- Where's the beer and wine?
- In the car.

187
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,015
Listen, I just got one of those
Presidential Alerts. Did you get one?

188
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,309
No. It's probably just a test.
Can you get the stuff?

189
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,061
No, Ali.
I don't think it's a test.

190
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,647
They said our family's
been selected for shelter.

191
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:01,192
I think something weird
is going on with this comet.

192
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,362
But the news said the fragment thing
is falling somewhere near Bermuda.

193
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,865
Then why is half
of our military on the move

194
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,159
with a ton of planes
in the sky?

195
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,369
Hey, John, here it comes.
You guys, get in here.

196
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:15,957
Now, splashdown off the coast of Bermuda
is expected in just a few seconds.

197
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,668
A number of scientists say
the dispersive wave distance,

198
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,420
it's unlikely
to cause a tsunami...

199
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,006
Did you take a unit
for the popcorn? Do it.

200
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,427
...but it will give us the largest
impact since the Tunguska event of 1908.

201
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,304
That's when a meteor
slammed into...

202
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,848
- Look! There's Clarke!
- Looks pretty cool, huh?

203
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,850
Spectacular first images here.

204
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,436
- Would you look at that?
- These are coming to us live.

205
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,149
This is the fragment actually
entering the lower atmosphere.

206
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,234
- Five, four...
- Five, four...

207
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,236
- ...three, two...
- ...three, two...

208
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,863
- ...one.
- ...one.

209
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,031
And impact.

210
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,953
Wait,
where's the explosion?

211
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,456
It's a chunk of rock.
Rocks don't explode.

212
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,124
Tell that
to the dinosaurs.

213
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,502
We are still waiting
for the first images

214
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,338
of the actual splashdown that's
expected in the Atlantic Ocean.

215
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,800
- What was that?
- The earlier footage showed...

216
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,824
Nathan! Come here.

217
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,033
Everybody okay?

218
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,119
- What was that?
- You guys okay?

219
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,995
I think it was
a shock wave or...

220
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,039
We now are getting word
that the fragment,

221
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:41,418
it has hit the state
of Florida, central Florida,

222
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:45,714
with the impact's epicenter
reported just outside Tampa

223
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,757
stretching to Orlando.

224
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,801
And that fragment,

225
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:54,013
which scientists are estimating
was the size of a football stadium,

226
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:58,601
has apparently sent a shock
wave felt as far as 1,500 miles.

227
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,648
Uh, I have to warn you, there are no
words for what you are about to see.

228
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,776
These are disturbing,
disturbing images.

229
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,989
They are coming to us from a
local news helicopter in Tampa

230
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,367
as well as an
overhead weather satellite.

231
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,662
- Whoa.
- What?

232
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,039
Mike. Mike, turn back!
Mike, turn...

233
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,588
Oh, my God.

234
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,757
Wait, are some more pieces
gonna hit?

235
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,259
Bear with us here. We don't have much
more information than these images.

236
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:37,307
Unfortunately, we have lost contact
with our affiliate in that area.

237
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,059
What is it, John?

238
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,395
It's a Presidential Alert.

239
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,814
The estimates of the trajectory
were obviously way off and we are...

240
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,859
Why did your phone get it
and not ours?

241
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,284
This alert is for

242
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,329
John Allan Garrity.

243
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:03,500
You have been selected for
emergency shelter relocation...

244
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,211
Dad, your name is on TV.

245
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:10,173
...with Allison Rose Garrity,
Nathan Beckett Garrity.

246
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,760
No one else is allowed with you.
There are no exceptions.

247
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,179
Bring one personal bag

248
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,599
to Robins Air Force Base,
Warner Robins, Georgia,

249
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:23,311
at 9:45 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time.

250
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,855
Your QR code for identification
has been texted to you.

251
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,068
Please confirm you are
receiving it by pressing one.

252
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,278
Maybe we got the same
message on the TV at home.

253
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,531
But why did
only John's phone get it?

254
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,826
Present the QR code
at Robins Air Force Base

255
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,912
for flight clearance
by 21:45 hours.

256
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,123
Another one's gonna hit us.
I know it.

257
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,708
Let's go. Let's go, Ellie.

258
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,126
I wanna stay with Nathan.

259
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,629
- Move, Ellie. Go.
- Mommy.

260
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,506
Let's go take a walk.
Let's just take a walk.

261
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,593
Unfortunately,
we don't have any more information

262
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,763
than these images that you are seeing.
We have lost contact with...

263
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:02,809
They said one bag each, but I don't even
know what I'm packing for. Hot, cold?

264
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,853
I don't know.
Hot, cold. Both, I guess.

265
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:08,147
- Where's his insulin supplies?
- Cabinet, top-left corner.

266
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,899
Remember to get the cartridges
from the fridge.

267
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,985
- Is this gonna be enough for a month?
- A month?

268
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,737
A month, a year.
We gotta be prepared, Ali!

269
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,199
Oh, sweetie. Hey. Hey, look at me.
Everything's fine.

270
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,785
We're rushing 'cause we don't
wanna miss that plane. Okay?

271
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,371
We're all gonna take this trip,
but we're all gonna be together.

272
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,873
All right, kiddo?

273
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,082
What about Grandpa?

274
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,961
Hey. We're gonna call him
from the road, all right?

275
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:34,173
...aftermath of the Tampa
impact. Tampa is a city of...

276
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,300
Oh, my God.

277
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,594
...just under 400,000 people.

278
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,847
That's everything from upstairs. Hey,
you almost ready? We've got a long drive.

279
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,141
Give me the bag
for the insulin.

280
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,059
- The bag, the bag, the bag.
- Yeah, okay.

281
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,439
- Where's Nathan?
- I thought he was with you.

282
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,941
The degree of devastation
is indescribable.

283
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,067
Nathan!

284
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,779
Nathan!

285
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,115
Nathan.
Come on. Let's go.

286
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,700
Look, the sky is on fire.

287
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,956
All right, let's go, kiddo.
Come on.

288
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,378
Okay, we're good?

289
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,047
Yeah.

290
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,267
We can see it from here?

291
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,065
John, John, John!

292
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,358
Oh, God.

293
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,068
None of them got called.

294
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,237
Two days.
They got it all wrong.

295
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,114
There's a shit-ton
of fragments on that thing.

296
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,283
They're saying that one of
them is a planet killer.

297
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,953
Now they've grounded all
non-military flights. What do we do?

298
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,414
I don't know, Ed.

299
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,291
Come on.

300
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,251
I don't even know if this
shelter relocation thing is real.

301
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,045
That's bullshit!
And you know it!

302
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,051
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry. It's just...

303
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,346
Just please give us a call if you
find out anything when you get there.

304
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,057
Like where we can go
to be safe.

305
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,184
You know I will, Ed.

306
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,314
Good luck. Good luck.

307
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,400
Wait.

308
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,610
Wait!

309
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,612
Wait!

310
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,114
Stop!

311
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,407
Oh, God.

312
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,491
Stop!

313
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,742
Wait!

314
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,494
- Wait!
- John, stop.

315
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,704
Wait!

316
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,123
You can take Ellie! Please!

317
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,416
Please!

318
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,667
We can't take her, Deb.

319
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,711
You can take Ellie!
Please!

320
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,296
- Maybe we should.
- No, Ali, we can't take her.

321
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,798
- Ellie!
- Deb, I'm sorry.

322
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,049
We can't take her.

323
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,386
I am begging you!

324
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,930
Deb, for Christ's sake,
get out of the way!

325
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:47,765
- John.
- Ali.

326
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:50,226
No!

327
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,561
We can't take...

328
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,813
- No! Coward!
- Deb, I'm sorry!

329
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,314
- No!
- John.

330
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,358
- Allison. Allison.
- Ellie!

331
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,277
- Please, open the door!
- Ellie!

332
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,695
I'm sorry, Deb!

333
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,947
No!

334
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,866
What if it were Nathan?
What if it were...

335
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,492
Nathan!

336
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:07,994
Ellie!

337
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,412
No!

338
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,496
I'm sorry, Kenny.

339
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,958
No.

340
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,376
No!

341
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,545
Wait!
John, we gotta go back!

342
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,921
Ali, we can't take her.

343
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,465
- But why?
- What?

344
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,425
So we take her
to the air base,

345
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,053
and then leave her standing there
alone when they turn her away?

346
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,107
He's gonna call. He's gonna call us.
It's gonna be fine.

347
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,901
It's gonna be fine.

348
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,417
While more
impacts are expected around the globe

349
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,753
as the Earth spins on its axis...

350
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,881
Stupid call won't go through.
I hope my dad's okay.

351
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,966
...bombarded
with millions of calls,

352
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,844
leaving already desperate people
with indefinite hold times.

353
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,891
All over the country, people
are buying out grocery stores,

354
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,476
stocking up on supplies.

355
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,812
That didn't take long.

356
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:20,483
There are unsubstantiated reports of some
citizens receiving Presidential Alerts

357
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:24,570
with instructions to report to
military bases around the country,

358
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:28,491
having been selected for transport
to classified emergency shelters.

359
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,993
- Does that say where they're taking us?
- No.

360
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:34,372
All it says is the shelter locations
are classified. There's no information.

361
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,290
I don't get why
we were selected.

362
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:38,376
There have still been
no official statements

363
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,253
from the White House
or Homeland Security.

364
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,921
What is going on?

365
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,923
Many speculate they've been
withholding information

366
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,800
to avoid causing mass hysteria

367
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,387
so that they may relocate those
selected for shelter first

368
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,181
before the inevitable collapse
of our nation.

369
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:01,691
Oh, no.

370
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,775
Great.

371
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,655
Look at the highway.

372
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:12,743
My God.

373
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,420
Careful.
Wait, what are you doing?

374
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:23,629
Going another way.

375
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,512
Be careful.

376
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,684
- Damn it, John!
- Sorry, Ali.

377
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,322
Okay.

378
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:56,996
Okay.

379
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,291
All right.

380
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,585
I think we're good.

381
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:17,058
Clarke's fragments,
now estimated to be in the thousands,

382
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,977
continue to impact different
regions around the globe

383
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,188
with little to no warning
at all.

384
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,900
While many of them are smaller in
size, causing minimal damage,

385
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:29,946
some fragments are large enough
to take out entire cities,

386
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,990
like Bogotá, Colombia,
just minutes ago.

387
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,326
- But what has space agencies concerned...
- Finally.

388
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:39,622
...as they try to gather more data
is one fragment now identified

389
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,792
large enough to cause
an extinction-level event.

390
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,963
This particular fragment is estimated
to impact Earth within 48 hours.

391
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,339
Jesus.

392
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,636
Local law-enforcement agencies and
first responders are overwhelmed...

393
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,138
Do you think all these
people were selected?

394
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,932
Dunno.

395
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,685
What if there's not
enough room for everybody?

396
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,561
Let's just get in there
first.

397
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,866
- Jump. Okay.
- All right, guys, we gotta go.

398
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,328
But you hate planes.

399
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,539
All right, kiddo.
I know.

400
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,792
But sometimes you just gotta suck it up.
Push through, right?

401
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,461
Even when
you're super scared.

402
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,090
Can you do that with me,
bud?

403
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,092
Yeah?

404
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,552
All right, we gotta go.

405
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,681
All right? Let's go.

406
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,396
Only selectees
will gain entrance.

407
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,481
Get your QR codes ready!

408
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,234
If you were not
selected, do not approach the gate.

409
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,447
Stay back!

410
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,992
Only selectees
will gain entrance.

411
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,369
If you were not selected,
do not approach the gate.

412
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,079
Are they letting people in?

413
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,081
It's okay, kiddo.

414
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,548
If you were not selected,
do not approach the gate.

415
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,091
We were selected!

416
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:18,179
We were sele...

417
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,476
Oh, shit!

418
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,979
Did another one hit?

419
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,238
Hey, we were selected!

420
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,282
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

421
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,242
Coming through.
Excuse me.

422
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,995
Let's go!

423
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,711
- Keep going.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

424
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,380
- We were selected.
- Selectees only.

425
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,215
Hey. We were selected!

426
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,758
I need your ID
and bar code.

427
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,346
There.

428
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,181
Hangar 33 for in-processing.
Go now.

429
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,642
All right.
Take my arm. Let's go.

430
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:05,726
Sorry.

431
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,822
Group Charlie 4,
go to transport 56.

432
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,957
- Keep moving!
- Let's go, guys.

433
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,251
Have your IDs
and your bar codes ready.

434
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,712
Your wristband is your personal
identification. Do not remove it.

435
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,549
- Thank you.
- You will not be able to board without it.

436
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,676
Come on. Let's go.
Keep the line moving.

437
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,344
That's yours.

438
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:42,012
- All right. This arm here.
- Can you help him?

439
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,558
- There you go.
- Thank you.

440
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:46,725
Okay.

441
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,646
Um... guys?

442
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,817
Put the discarded
items by the wall!

443
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,362
Take your personal belongings
and put them into this one bag.

444
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:01,574
If it doesn't fit, it doesn't go.
No exceptions.

445
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:08,622
Take your personal belongings
and put them into this one bag.

446
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:12,042
If it doesn't fit, it doesn't go.
No exceptions.

447
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:15,254
Put the discarded items
by the wall.

448
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,299
Take your personal belongings
and put them into this one bag.

449
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,759
If it doesn't fit, it doesn't go.
No exceptions.

450
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,137
Sorry, one bag?
We have three bags.

451
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,389
One per family.
Keep moving.

452
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:27,808
- Keep moving.
- Okay. All right.

453
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:30,519
- Sorry, guys.
- One bag per family. Let's go.

454
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,314
...personal belongings
and put them into this one bag.

455
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,066
If it doesn't fit, it doesn't go.
No exceptions.

456
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,654
All right. Let's just
pack as much as we can in.

457
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:44,158
Okay. Um... Grab some
pants, shirts for everybody.

458
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,076
Yeah, yeah.

459
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,870
I'll put Nathan's stuff in the
backpack to keep it separate.

460
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:48,954
Okay.

461
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,250
I got your blanket, okay?
We'll put it in here.

462
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,252
- Put his pants in there.
- Make room for...

463
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:56,837
That's a shirt for me.

464
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:58,464
- John?
- Yeah.

465
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,925
Where is his medicine?
I put it in here. It's gone.

466
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,843
What do you mean,
it's gone?

467
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,554
- It's gone. It's not in there.
- It's in there. You put it...

468
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:08,516
Nathan, did you go
in your backpack?

469
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,518
I wanted my blanket.

470
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:11,602
Oh, God.

471
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,356
He must've dropped it
in the car. Shit!

472
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:17,858
What now? What do we do?

473
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,319
Hang on.

474
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,822
Please, please, please.

475
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,533
Hey, excuse me.
Excuse me.

476
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,826
How long
till our plane leaves?

477
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,828
Fifteen minutes.
Twenty, tops.

478
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:32,039
Okay. Okay.

479
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,917
- I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go get it.
- Wait, what?

480
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,961
What, are we just gonna
leave his insulin?

481
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,380
- I have the wristband.
- John.

482
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,132
Look,
I'll meet you on the plane.

483
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:43,884
Just text me
which one you're on.

484
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,011
- Keep moving.
- It's okay.

485
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:48,514
He'll be right back.
Okay?

486
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,099
We're gonna put this
in here.

487
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:56,313
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

488
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,315
No, I need to grab
something from the car.

489
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,192
I have my wristband.
Can I get back in?

490
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,402
Yeah, go ahead. Go.

491
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,486
Okay.

492
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:07,700
All right.

493
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:11,870
Uh...

494
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,793
You know what?
Come here. Come here.

495
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,337
Hey! Excuse me.

496
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:22,423
Look, I know my husband
just talked to you.

497
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,883
He's going back to the car
to get my son's meds.

498
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,469
- Can you make sure he gets on our plane...
- Meds?

499
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,848
Yeah.
It's just his insulin.

500
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:32,516
Sergeant Ruiz?

501
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,934
What's the problem?

502
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,227
What's up?

503
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,895
It's okay.
I just explained to him.

504
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,356
It's just for his insulin pump.
It's not a big deal.

505
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,027
You know what? Forget it.
It's fine. We don't need it.

506
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,987
That's not the issue,
ma'am.

507
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,197
Don't worry about it. We'll use the shots.
It's not a big deal.

508
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,782
- Line one, we need an escort.
- What?

509
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,785
Look, we have the bracelets.
We were selected.

510
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,871
Follow me,
please, ma'am.

511
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,664
No, no, no. Why?

512
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,333
Ma'am, I'm not asking.

513
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,294
Let's go.

514
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,924
It's okay.

515
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:24,610
- Come on. Hurry up!
- Over here!

516
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,237
No, Captain,
I don't remember giving the order on that.

517
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,657
No, tell me something,
how is there a problem with that manifest?

518
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,784
I signed for it myself.

519
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:35,245
Then I will come down there and check it.
I'll be down there in five.

520
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:39,291
- The kid's diabetic.
- Don't touch him.

521
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,669
I'm sorry.
You should've been informed.

522
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,129
Anyone with a chronic condition
can't be on the plane.

523
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,006
It's just diabetes.

524
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,425
His condition should've
been flagged at screening.

525
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:51,303
If I hadn't said anything to the
guard, he'd have no idea he had a pump.

526
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,222
There's nothing I can do
about that, ma'am.

527
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,058
You can pretend
that you didn't see it.

528
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,269
- Ma'am, I didn't write the rule. Sorry.
- Then ignore it!

529
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,648
What if this
was your family?

530
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,445
My family wasn't selected,
ma'am.

531
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,409
99% of armed forces
weren't.

532
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,453
We are all volunteers here
just doing our jobs.

533
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:18,247
I'm sorry.

534
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:21,709
I am.

535
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,462
But please...

536
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:28,841
His father, my husband,
is on one of those planes right now.

537
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,551
What am I
supposed to do?

538
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:39,810
Hey!

539
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,376
This is Breen.

540
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,920
Yeah, I'm looking
for a passenger.

541
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,757
Ma'am, what's his name?

542
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,341
John Allan Garrity.

543
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,885
John Allan Garrity.

544
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,095
Chalk 33?

545
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,474
Yeah, his son was flagged.

546
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,184
Thank you.
They're looking for him.

547
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,644
Thank you. Thank you.

548
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,031
Allison!

549
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,074
Nathan!

550
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,368
Allison!

551
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:50,464
Do not run. Move in an orderly
fashion to your designated aircraft.

552
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,509
Have you seen a kid? He's age seven.
He's wearing a gray hoodie.

553
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,261
And his mom is dark-haired.
She's about 5'7".

554
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,639
I've seen a lot of kids, sir.
Please keep moving.

555
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,849
I need to know
if they made it on first.

556
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,393
- Do they have bracelets?
- We all have them, yeah.

557
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:05,229
Then they're on
one of these planes.

558
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,481
Are you sure they're all
going to the same place?

559
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,899
Yes. Now go.

560
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:12,444
Everyone keep moving
in an orderly fashion!

561
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:13,654
Allison!

562
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,281
Do not run!

563
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,576
Okay.
Thank you, Lieutenant.

564
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,122
Ma'am, they're boarding.
There's nothing more I can do for you.

565
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,917
No, no, no. Come on. You can go on
one of those planes and look for him.

566
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,379
There are dozens of planes with
over 2,000 passengers crammed in.

567
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,965
- I can't hold them up for this.
- Are there phones? Can I call?

568
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,050
I don't know
if there's any phones.

569
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,761
- Where are these planes going?
- Shelter destinations are classified.

570
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:40,681
Look, ma'am, this is an emergency
operation with a lot of moving parts.

571
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,475
I am just in transport.
I wish I had more answers for you.

572
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,143
Please.
What am I supposed to do?

573
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,604
- I'm very sorry.
- Stop, stop. No, no, no!

574
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:50,816
Ma'am, I need you to step this
way, please.

575
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,824
Allison!

576
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,158
Nathan!

577
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,412
Allison!

578
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,622
Nathan!

579
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,625
Nathan!

580
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,711
Allison!

581
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,005
Everybody sit down!
Let's go, let's go!

582
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,923
Everyone sit.

583
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,676
Everyone find a seat. Sir, find a seat.
We're ready to roll.

584
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,095
I'm trying to find my wife and kid.
They're on this plane.

585
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,681
I need you to sit down.
We gotta get wheels up.

586
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:26,685
Everybody find a seat. Sit down, sir!
Find a seat. Let's go!

587
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,443
Shit.

588
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:48,415
Come on.

589
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:06,975
Hey. Hey.
Hey, how'd you get on?

590
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,146
What do you mean?
I was selected.

591
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,773
Yeah, I know.
With those.

592
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,901
No, it's my son's.

593
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,611
He's diabetic.

594
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,197
Yeah, so is my sister's kid,
and they turned him away.

595
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,823
They said no illnesses.

596
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,534
Do you know somebody
who can help us?

597
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,875
Hey! No, wait, wait, wait!

598
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,919
No, open that door!

599
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,213
- Open that door! No!
- Whoa, whoa!

600
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:38,298
What are you doing, sir?
Get back in your seat.

601
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:40,258
- Get back in your seat!
- You gotta let me out.

602
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:43,261
I've gotta get to my kid,
please. I beg you.

603
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,555
You get off this plane,
we are leaving without you.

604
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,350
That's okay.
Just let me off the plane!

605
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,894
Thank you.

606
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:51,979
Thank you.

607
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:54,523
Sorry.

608
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,865
Perimeter breach!
Perimeter breach!

609
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,743
- Ma'am, step this way! Somebody help her!
- Perimeter breach!

610
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:08,620
Move, move, move!

611
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:09,788
Security breach!

612
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,498
It's okay.
Come on. Let's go.

613
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,712
Perimeter breach.
Perimeter breach. Runway three-three.

614
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,922
All security forces
to runway three-three.

615
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:25,887
- Go, go! Runway 33!
- Maintain the perimeter!

616
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,597
Backup to runway 33!

617
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:28,932
Follow me!

618
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:37,232
- Let me on that plane!
- Let us on!

619
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,526
- Please take us!
- Let us on!

620
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:42,612
- Drop your weapons!
- Drop your weapons!

621
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:44,322
Drop it!

622
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,035
Stay there! Get on the ground!

623
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,954
Drop your weapons now!

624
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,547
Hey! Everybody get out!
There's fuel leaking. It's not safe!

625
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,631
Go!

626
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,342
Get on the ground!

627
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:09,598
Go, go, go!

628
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,417
Is that Dad's plane?

629
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,046
No, honey.
See, there's other planes.

630
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,381
He's not on that one, okay?

631
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,220
We'll find him. Come on.
Come on. Hold my hand.

632
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,148
- Get out!
- Hurry! Don't stop!

633
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,858
Let's go! Move back!

634
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:05,070
- Hey, sir, don't stop!
- Hey, hey, hey.

635
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,782
Stop and listen! I need to find my wife
and kid. Did they come through here?

636
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,450
Sir, I remember you.

637
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,369
They declined your son.
Your family's not out there.

638
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,497
Keep moving back.

639
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,998
Move back!

640
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,000
Go, go, go.

641
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,504
Oh, shit.

642
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,050
Careful.

643
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:29,136
Stand over here,
away from the glass.

644
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,513
Come on! Over here!

645
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,807
Are you okay?

646
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,684
Let me see.
Look at me.

647
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,270
Are you low?

648
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,064
Empty.

649
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:43,066
Hold on,
let me find your meds.

650
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,610
Your dad must have them.

651
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,737
Okay. Look at me.

652
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,157
All right,
we've gotta find a pharmacy.

653
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,533
Here.

654
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,660
Here, take that.

655
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,955
If we don't find Daddy,
we'll go to Grandpa's house, okay?

656
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,874
I'm just gonna
send him a message.

657
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,926
Stay back!

658
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:25,817
Oh, shit.

659
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:57,641
Allison!

660
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,275
Okay, there it is.

661
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,281
All right. You've gotta
stay really close to me, okay?

662
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,638
Get what we need and get out
of here as quick as possible.

663
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:22,642
Sorry.

664
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,110
Here. Okay.

665
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,987
Come on.
Kneel down with me.

666
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,655
Okay.

667
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:40,076
Give me your finger.

668
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,370
You're such a brave guy,
you know that?

669
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,790
Oh, Jesus.
You're at 300.

670
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,835
Let's get you fixed up.

671
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,260
Okay. Uh...

672
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:09,814
Okay.

673
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:19,699
Come on!
Everybody out! Come on!

674
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,910
Get out!

675
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,912
Get out of here!

676
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,247
- Move! Get out! Get out!
- Get the hell out!

677
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,168
- Everybody out now! Let's go!
- Get moving!

678
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,462
- Move!
- Move, bitch! Get out!

679
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:35,799
Move!

680
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,509
We're just gonna go
as fast as we can, okay?

681
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,302
Just stay low.
Stay next to me.

682
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:41,554
Come on, now.
Come on, come on, come on.

683
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,435
Let's go! Come on!

684
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:50,063
Just grab it all!

685
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,147
Come on, keep moving!

686
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,361
No, no, no!

687
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,695
Oh, my God!

688
00:44:58,405 --> 00:44:59,739
No, don't look.

689
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:01,282
Don't look.

690
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,451
Oh, my God.

691
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,662
Here, stay with me. Stay
with me, right next to me.

692
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,502
Please! Please.

693
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,087
- Please.
- Move!

694
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,631
My son's
only seven years old!

695
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,715
Move it, move!

696
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,471
Go.

697
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,348
Come on!

698
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,980
Hey!

699
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,441
Hey, hey!
Are you going up north?

700
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:36,734
Please, we need a ride.
Please.

701
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:38,570
- Are you going up north?
- Get in the car.

702
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,029
No, no, no!

703
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:42,740
No, we just need to get
up near Lexington.

704
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,409
Get in the car.

705
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:45,952
I'll take you as far as
Knoxville, but that's it.

706
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,079
Thank you!
Get in, get in, get in!

707
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:50,290
- Come on. Get on in, son.
- Okay.

708
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,886
- My God. Could you hear gunfire?
- Yes.

709
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,971
I just started running.

710
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,098
I turn around, and there was an old
woman who'd been in a wheelchair.

711
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:09,684
- They just killed her.
- Oh, Jesus.

712
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,728
I watched them. I thought
they were gonna shoot me.

713
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,813
- I'm sorry, hon.
- All right, there you go.

714
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:15,482
- You're okay. Okay?
- Okay.

715
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:17,775
- Are you okay back there?
- Yes.

716
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:19,611
Thank you so much.

717
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:22,739
It's like there's no chain of command.
Nobody in charge.

718
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,741
Everybody's running around
with their heads cut off.

719
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:26,159
Shit.

720
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,785
We'll get to Knoxville,
get on a flight.

721
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,746
Yeah, if we can get there
before they take off.

722
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,248
And if they let us through.

723
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:34,667
I mean, that stupid lottery.

724
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,629
You know the government
knew about all this,

725
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:40,298
and all they did
was pick the rich fat cats.

726
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:41,591
Damn.

727
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,178
Hey, is your son,
uh, is he hungry?

728
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,388
- We got a sandwich here.
- Oh.

729
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,933
You know what? It would be really good
for him to eat something. Thank you.

730
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,644
We got a turkey sandwich, sweetheart.
Does that sound nice?

731
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,229
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

732
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,564
What do we say?

733
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,316
What do you say,
sweetheart?

734
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,442
Thank you.

735
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:01,569
Well, you are welcome, pal.

736
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:04,447
Are you two out here
all by yourselves?

737
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:07,116
Uh, no.
My husband, um...

738
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,661
We got separated.

739
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,371
He's on a plane.

740
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,748
A plane?

741
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,961
Ralph, they're wearing those
bracelets that we saw on the news.

742
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,337
Y'all got picked?

743
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,339
Why aren't you
on that plane with him?

744
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,551
My son, he has a medical condition,
so they wouldn't let us on.

745
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:27,220
Oh, what a shame.

746
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,975
That's a damn shame.

747
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:04,924
♪ That saved
A wretch like me ♪

748
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:34,912
Hey! Hey!

749
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:36,581
No, wait! Wait!

750
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:40,043
Shit.

751
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,505
Work,
you stupid piece of shit.

752
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:11,783
Finally.

753
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,290
- John?
- Hey, Ali?

754
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:20,541
Can you hear me?

755
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,710
Oh, thank God.
Ali, are you okay?

756
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:25,338
John. Did you get my text?

757
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:26,798
Hey, Ali,
I can't hear you.

758
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,508
- Hello?
- Where are you guys?

759
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,802
- Are you at your dad's?
- John, if you can hear me...

760
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,137
- I can't hear you.
- ...please meet us at my dad's.

761
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:34,764
- That's where we're headed.
- Ali...

762
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:45,024
- Is that Dad?
- Yeah, that's him.

763
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:47,527
- Where is he?
- I don't know. The phone's not working.

764
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,654
- I wanna see him.
- I know.

765
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:53,032
We're gonna meet him at Grandpa's.
It's okay. He's gonna meet us there.

766
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:16,931
Kiss my ass, Clarke!

767
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:23,730
Come on, guys. Everybody in.
We gotta get moving.

768
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:26,357
Hey. Hey!

769
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:27,442
Excuse me.

770
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:30,611
- Where are you headed?
- North.

771
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,113
- How far?
- Canada.

772
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,115
Can you take me
to Lexington, Kentucky?

773
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,242
It's on the way there.

774
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,702
Okay,
but you gotta get in now.

775
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,412
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

776
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:23,623
So, what do you do?

777
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:25,708
What?

778
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:27,168
What do I do?

779
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:33,257
They're selecting people
based on their professions.

780
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:36,052
Like my mom, she was selected
because she's a doctor.

781
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:43,184
I'm a structural engineer.
I build buildings.

782
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,062
We definitely need those.

783
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,481
Hey, I'm John.

784
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,066
Colin.

785
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:51,150
Good to meet you.

786
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:53,277
You as well.
You as well.

787
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:56,489
So, if your mum got accepted,
why are you not with your family?

788
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:01,202
I haven't spoken to my
family in seven years.

789
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,289
I found out about all this
through my sister.

790
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:08,751
Yeah. Me and my mom,
we had our issues.

791
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:12,004
So much for holding
grudges, right?

792
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:15,883
What about you?

793
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,137
I don't like flying.
Thought I'd walk.

794
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:26,310
I lost my wife and son
at the military base,

795
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:28,396
and I'm trying
to meet up with them now.

796
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:36,988
All right, look.

797
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:39,240
So my boy Manny
that's driving,

798
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,492
he knows some pilots
in Canada.

799
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:43,870
That's where
we're all headed.

800
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,080
They're giving some people
rides to the shelters.

801
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:50,960
But the shelters are classified.
How do they even know where they're going?

802
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,462
They've been tracking the
military flights to Greenland.

803
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:54,672
Greenland?

804
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:57,633
You should come with us.

805
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:59,218
Nah, thanks,

806
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:02,346
but I gotta find my wife
and family in Kentucky.

807
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,307
So find 'em and meet
up with us after.

808
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,309
We're taking off
from Osgoode.

809
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,311
It's a small city
right across the border.

810
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:13,232
How do you know
you're even gonna get in?

811
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:16,611
Only one way
to find out, right?

812
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:03,824
You know, it's gonna be tough
getting that far north,

813
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:05,701
all the way up to Lexington.

814
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:10,539
I mean,
it's crazy out here.

815
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,502
Are you sure you don't wanna
just come with us?

816
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:18,464
You know, get on a plane?

817
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:24,178
I already tried that. It didn't work,
so I just need to get to my dad's.

818
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,846
Oh, okay.

819
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:33,688
Ralph, what is it?

820
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:39,485
I just... I can't...

821
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:41,737
I can't believe all them
soldiers at the airport,

822
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:43,990
that they would
turn that boy away.

823
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:45,825
I mean,
with a face like that?

824
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,996
She already told
you that's what happened.

825
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,998
Yeah, well, maybe...

826
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:54,625
maybe if he had some
different family with him...

827
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:02,091
What are you doing?

828
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:04,010
Wait. What are you doing?
Why are you stopping?

829
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:05,219
Ralph!

830
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:11,892
Look, your husband, he abandoned you.
But you don't gotta worry.

831
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,936
I'm gonna get your son
to safety, I promise you.

832
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,479
I'm gonna get him
on that plane.

833
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:17,189
- Ralph. Wait.
- No. You don't have to...

834
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:18,733
Where are you going?
Oh, my God!

835
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,443
Get out of the car, quick!

836
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:21,861
- Ralph.
- No!

837
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,239
No! No! No!

838
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,574
- Unlock it, Judy.
- No.

839
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,117
- Judy, unlock the door.
- No.

840
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,952
- Don't unlock the door!
- God damn it, Judy!

841
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:32,580
- Unlock the goddamn door!
- Don't do it! Don't unlock...

842
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,166
- No, no!
- Come here. I don't wanna hurt you.

843
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:36,584
No! I'm not coming!

844
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,627
Get out of the car.
Come here! Get out!

845
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:40,796
Come here. I don't wanna hurt you.

846
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,256
Ralph!

847
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,549
- Get out of the car. Come here!
- Mom!

848
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:44,925
Get out of the car!

849
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,635
No!

850
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:48,512
- Kid, stop it! No!
- Don't take him! No!

851
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:50,181
- Stop!
- Don't take him!

852
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,932
- Mom!
- Stop it!

853
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:54,351
- I don't wanna hurt you, okay?
- God, I'm so sorry!

854
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,479
- No! No! Mom!
- I don't wanna hurt you, okay?

855
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,397
I'm gonna take care
of your son, I promise.

856
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:00,191
- Lock the door, Judy.
- Don't take him!

857
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:03,277
No, what are you doing? Open the door!

858
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,822
Nathan, open the door!
Open the door!

859
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,824
No!

860
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:10,493
No!

861
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,288
No!

862
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,504
Stop!

863
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:24,006
Stop! Stop!

864
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,592
Stop, stop, stop!

865
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,555
Stop!

866
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:34,850
Stop!

867
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:40,147
What do I...

868
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,319
Nathan!

869
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:11,887
Hey.

870
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:16,517
Hey.

871
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:18,477
Where are you from?

872
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,233
I'm from Atlanta.

873
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:25,693
Nope.

874
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:29,613
Not what I'm asking.

875
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,076
Where were you born?

876
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:38,372
What does it matter?

877
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,583
What matters is
you don't deserve that band.

878
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:46,547
All right, listen.

879
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:47,965
You're gonna give it
to me.

880
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,219
It wouldn't do you
any good.

881
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:53,804
It's got my name on it.

882
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,473
It wouldn't work for you.

883
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:58,434
You're gonna give me
your license too.

884
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:06,317
I don't want any trouble.

885
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:09,445
Just...

886
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,906
Come on. All right, listen.

887
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:16,869
Give me the goddamn band.

888
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,496
I'm not giving you
the band.

889
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:22,666
Come on, fellas.

890
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,668
Guys, he just said
that it's not gonna work.

891
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:25,836
Stay out of it!

892
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,488
What the hell?

893
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,789
Oh, my God,
they're fighting!

894
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:11,423
- Pull over!
- I'm trying.

895
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:20,349
Watch out!

896
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,998
Just give us the band!

897
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:16,043
Need ride?

898
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:18,962
- Where are you going?
- Aeropuerto.

899
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,131
Aeropuerto in Knoxville?

900
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:23,675
- Sí, Knoxville. Okay?
- Sí.

901
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:24,843
Gracias.

902
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,229
This bracelet is broken.
It's not gonna go on.

903
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:38,023
Well, find something.
Find a rubber band or something.

904
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:41,276
Just figure it out.

905
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,282
Don't you worry.
It's gonna be okay.

906
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,872
You're gonna see your mom
again, okay?

907
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:00,170
What did you do?

908
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:01,296
What did I do?

909
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:04,883
I gave us a chance.
I gave that boy a chance.

910
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:07,344
Oh, shit. Okay.

911
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,348
Okay, okay, okay.

912
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:13,058
Okay. Hold on.
Let me get this thing.

913
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,317
Just rubber-band it,
huh?

914
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:29,408
Now you listen to me.

915
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:33,245
You wanna see your mama again,
you do exactly as I tell you.

916
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:35,831
When them soldiers ask you who we
are, we are your parents.

917
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,457
You understand me?

918
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:38,875
Do you understand me?

919
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,963
Just do what he says
and it's all gonna be okay.

920
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:46,133
All right. Come on.

921
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,051
Let's do this.

922
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,019
Selectees only!
Bar codes or wristbands!

923
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:00,314
When we get up there,
show your bracelet.

924
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:02,941
And you show 'em yours,
and you don't say a word. You hear me?

925
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:05,110
- You hear me? Don't say a word.
- Just be easy, Ralph.

926
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,406
Back up. Back up.

927
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,033
Let's go. Let's go.

928
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:20,959
Coming through.
We got bracelets.

929
01:05:21,043 --> 01:05:22,961
We got bracelets here.
Coming through.

930
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,297
We got a bracelet here.

931
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,382
We've got bracelets here.
Coming through.

932
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:30,385
We got bracelets here.
Coming through.

933
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:33,513
We've got a bracelet here.
We've got bracelets here.

934
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:35,098
Coming through.

935
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:36,933
You can't come through.
Selectees only.

936
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:38,560
Selectees only. Hold on.

937
01:05:38,644 --> 01:05:40,354
Selectees only, please.

938
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:42,648
Show him your bracelet.

939
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:43,982
Sir, what about his?

940
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:45,776
- It's right here.
- Okay. Let me see.

941
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:47,569
That's my son.
That's my wife.

942
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:49,488
Show him your bracelets,
your wristbands.

943
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:52,407
- Okay. Go through. Go through.
- Come on, Judy. Let's go.

944
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:54,660
Hey! Wait, wait.
What about yours?

945
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:55,869
I need all three.

946
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,537
Look, that's my son,
my wife.

947
01:05:57,621 --> 01:06:00,040
Sir, somebody stole mine earlier.

948
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,375
I'm telling you, sir.

949
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,001
Somebody stole
my bracelet earlier.

950
01:06:03,085 --> 01:06:05,128
This is my boy, and this is my wife.

951
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:06,838
Please. Please.

952
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:08,590
Okay. Let me go
talk to my commander.

953
01:06:08,674 --> 01:06:10,717
They're not my parents.

954
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:14,930
- No. This is my son, I'm telling you.
- They took me from my mom.

955
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:16,723
No, he's just scared.
This is my son.

956
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,350
- He's nervous right now...
- No, I'm not.

957
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:19,768
I'm your mama.

958
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,978
He's just scared right now.
He's scared.

959
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:24,439
- Give me your wristband.
- No, no, he... This is my...

960
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:26,441
This is the bracelet
for the family.

961
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:28,110
Sir...

962
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,236
MPs!

963
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,779
No, no, no. Listen.

964
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:32,406
- He isn't yours.
- They're not my parents!

965
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,074
- Security!
- No, no, no! Please.

966
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,451
Let's get him on a plane!
Let's get him on a plane!

967
01:06:36,535 --> 01:06:38,286
- No! That's my son!
- Wait!

968
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,539
He's only seven.
He needs to get on a plane!

969
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:43,083
- Check his bracelet.
- I got you. It's gonna be all right.

970
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,460
Okay, we're gonna figure this out.
It's okay.

971
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,880
Let me see your wristband, bud.

972
01:06:48,964 --> 01:06:50,340
Says you've been rejected.

973
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,510
You don't look too good,
big guy.

974
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:56,555
Are you sick? It's gonna be all
right, all right? Don't cry.

975
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:59,349
Come on.
Let's go figure this out.

976
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,372
What's going on?

977
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:25,959
No sé. Aeropuerto
still a long distance.

978
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:30,046
- No, no, no.
- I have to go.

979
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:06,333
Excuse me! Coming through!
Coming through!

980
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,585
Excuse me! Coming through!

981
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:09,669
Excuse me!

982
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:14,466
My son... A man and a woman,
they took him.

983
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:17,093
They said something about
coming here for a flight.

984
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:19,095
Ma'am, I can't hear you.

985
01:08:19,179 --> 01:08:22,432
They took my wristband.
You probably scanned it. Nathan Garrity.

986
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:24,267
We've had hundreds of kids
through here.

987
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:27,395
Look, maybe try the FEMA camp
across the street.

988
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,751
Move! Move!

989
01:08:49,835 --> 01:08:51,711
You need to fill out
this consent form.

990
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:54,339
The soldier at the checkpoint
said you might have my son here.

991
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:56,216
- You need to wait in line.
- Listen to me!

992
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,759
You need to wait in line!

993
01:08:57,843 --> 01:08:59,928
- I need to find my son.
- We're doing our best.

994
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,848
He's seven years old! He was taken from me!
Somebody just listen to me!

995
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:04,683
Ma'am. Please.
Come here. Talk to me.

996
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:06,685
- What's going on?
- I'm trying to find my son.

997
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:09,104
He's seven years old. He's diabetic.
He was taken from me.

998
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:11,106
Somebody said
he could be over here.

999
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,525
I'll help you find your son,
but you need to calm down. Follow me.

1000
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,823
Let's check
the pediatric tent.

1001
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:24,786
- Where? Where?
- Right here.

1002
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:25,871
- This one?
- Yes.

1003
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,625
- You see him?
- Uh...

1004
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:32,836
- No, he's not in there.
- Let's try around here.

1005
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,761
You see him?

1006
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:42,888
No, he's not in here.

1007
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:48,310
- How about here?
- No, he's not here either.

1008
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:50,145
It's okay. It's okay.
We'll find him.

1009
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:51,771
Check this one here.

1010
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,000
Nathan! Nathan.

1011
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:15,003
- Mom!
- Oh, honey! Oh, my God.

1012
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:16,087
Look at me.

1013
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:17,923
Oh, baby.

1014
01:10:18,924 --> 01:10:21,635
I'm so sorry!

1015
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:24,554
Oh, my God!

1016
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:27,515
I'm so sorry.

1017
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,559
I'm so sorry.

1018
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:34,439
I'll never let that happen again.
I'm so sorry.

1019
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:38,610
I'm fine, Mom.

1020
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:40,487
He's a remarkable young man.

1021
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:43,949
- You're Allison.
- Yeah.

1022
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:47,202
He's type one diabetic.
I've gotta check his levels.

1023
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:48,620
He told us.

1024
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:50,497
We checked his levels twice.

1025
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,540
Gave him some insulin,
new pump.

1026
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:54,542
If I can get you
to sign this release form,

1027
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:56,878
I can move you guys
into a family tent.

1028
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:02,801
No, um... we're going
to my father's.

1029
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:06,638
I lost my... I lost my husband.
We're gonna find him.

1030
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:08,264
I'm so sorry.

1031
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:09,724
Where does your father live?

1032
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:13,520
In Lexington.
Near Lexington.

1033
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:17,857
Okay. Maybe I can get you on a
military bus heading in that direction.

1034
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:20,694
And I also put together a
week's supply of glucose tabs,

1035
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:23,279
and insulin,
and test strips, so...

1036
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:26,825
I wish I could give you
more, but it's all we have.

1037
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:30,620
Thank you.

1038
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:16,541
Hello?

1039
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,044
Hello?

1040
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,922
...see on camera at this moment,
but the city is mostly burning...

1041
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:07,342
Governments continue to struggle
to contain the social chao...

1042
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:10,428
...again, this livestream
video that's gone viral.

1043
01:13:10,512 --> 01:13:13,515
We have to warn you,
these images are disturbing.

1044
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:16,101
All of
downtown is on fire, man.

1045
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:17,852
Check it out.
There's another one.

1046
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:22,690
Wait. Is that coming
towards us? Wait. Holy...

1047
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:23,942
Yo, run!

1048
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:28,279
Yet another shocking image...

1049
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:30,657
- Sometimes they come down...
- Wow.

1050
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,576
They come out of
nowhere, you know? There's no warning.

1051
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,703
- We're just trying to keep up.
- Yeah.

1052
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:37,413
And, uh...

1053
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:40,416
having in the back of our head
that tomorrow we're...

1054
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,503
It's all gonna be for nothing.

1055
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:21,476
Now it comes.

1056
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:50,213
What a load of shit.

1057
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:57,804
Looks like I'm gonna have to
dip into my savings for this next round.

1058
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:05,103
You're alone.
Where's Allison?

1059
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,438
- Where is she?
- I was hoping she'd be here.

1060
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:09,816
Why are my friends stuck here
babysitting me

1061
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:12,902
while my daughter and grandson
are out there alone,

1062
01:16:12,986 --> 01:16:15,154
and I'm here
with no way to find them?

1063
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:18,408
We lost each other at the airfield,
and she left me a note to meet her here.

1064
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,451
Fuck.

1065
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,456
Maybe we should go.

1066
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:28,167
She told me you were
moving back in.

1067
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:30,795
Let me guess,
you had another fight?

1068
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:34,257
We both want the same thing,
okay, for them to get here safely.

1069
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,801
So why don't we try
to work together?

1070
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,052
Okay.

1071
01:16:38,136 --> 01:16:40,555
Okay.
Did you try the landline?

1072
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:44,100
Go ahead. I tried
about an hour ago again.

1073
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,935
Keeps going
straight to voice mail.

1074
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:48,438
Or you get that
stupid government message.

1075
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:53,651
God, you would think
technology would work in emergencies.

1076
01:16:58,573 --> 01:16:59,574
Hey.

1077
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:02,952
What happened to you?

1078
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:04,829
- Nothing.
- Come on.

1079
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,791
It's been a long day.

1080
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:12,795
Just want 'em back.
I just...

1081
01:17:59,759 --> 01:18:02,428
Okay, there's a pay phone there.
Let's try that.

1082
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,561
Yes.

1083
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:19,529
Hello? Where? Stay there.
Stay right there.

1084
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:22,031
- Where are they?
- Down the road. Let's go.

1085
01:18:40,675 --> 01:18:41,676
Hey.

1086
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:53,729
I'm sorry, honey.
I tried. I tried.

1087
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:56,524
I know. It's okay.

1088
01:18:57,525 --> 01:18:58,526
Kiddo.

1089
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:00,236
- How you doing?
- Good.

1090
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:02,071
Yeah? Here.

1091
01:19:02,155 --> 01:19:05,366
Come here.
How you doing? Okay?

1092
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:07,493
Thanks for looking after
your mom, bud.

1093
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:14,917
Hi, Dad.

1094
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:17,003
Hey, sunflower.

1095
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:25,887
Oh.

1096
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,977
Come on, honey.
Let's get you guys home.

1097
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:35,021
Okay.

1098
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,192
Come on.

1099
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:45,698
All right, welcome. You hungry?
What do you wanna eat?

1100
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,825
- Pancakes.
- Pancakes. Syrup?

1101
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:48,993
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1102
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:50,745
- No.
- No.

1103
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:52,538
- No. I forgot.
- We don't have enough insulin as it is.

1104
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:53,915
Aw!

1105
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:56,250
- I have his medication here.
- You do?

1106
01:19:56,334 --> 01:19:59,670
Yeah. It was out of the fridge for a
long time, but it should still be good.

1107
01:19:59,754 --> 01:20:00,755
Thank you.

1108
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,593
You remember where this goes?

1109
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:08,387
- What do you want? Some water?
- Some water, yeah.

1110
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:10,806
Way to go. All right!

1111
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,059
- This good?
- Yep! Perfect.

1112
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:16,229
- "Perfectomundo."
- We should check the news.

1113
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:18,439
What do you think?

1114
01:20:18,523 --> 01:20:22,068
At approximately 8:47 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time tomorrow,

1115
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:24,904
the largest fragment from
Clarke is expected to land

1116
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,448
somewhere between
North Africa and Europe.

1117
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:30,701
Space agencies tracking
this fragment are predicting

1118
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:35,206
an extinction-level event
to extend around the globe,

1119
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:38,251
giving the limited number of
people chosen by their skill sets

1120
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:40,419
the greatest chance
of survival.

1121
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:44,173
Here again is the classified
footage discovered earlier today

1122
01:20:44,257 --> 01:20:49,053
showing the sophistication of five bunkers
near Thule Air Force Base in Greenland.

1123
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:50,805
They are in Greenland.

1124
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,890
Built during the Cold War
in case of nuclear fallout...

1125
01:20:52,974 --> 01:20:55,142
- He was right.
- Who was right?

1126
01:20:55,226 --> 01:20:57,311
...the bunkers are self-sufficient
with underground water tanks...

1127
01:20:57,395 --> 01:20:59,564
Just this
really good guy.

1128
01:20:59,647 --> 01:21:02,692
...hydroponic seed farms,
medical supplies and oxygen generators.

1129
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:05,403
- A lot of good that'll do us now.
- The footage is older than me.

1130
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,196
Who knows
what shape it's in?

1131
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,781
At least here
we'll be together.

1132
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:11,325
What are you doing, John?

1133
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:14,287
There's another way
for us to get there.

1134
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,706
- Where?
- To Greenland.

1135
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:18,916
There are pilots going
from up in Canada.

1136
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,751
They're taking people.
They're not military.

1137
01:21:20,835 --> 01:21:23,504
Look, it's just over
12 hours to Osgoode.

1138
01:21:23,588 --> 01:21:25,339
But we can do it in nine.

1139
01:21:25,423 --> 01:21:27,717
And then it's another six to
eight hours for the flight.

1140
01:21:28,426 --> 01:21:30,553
We can make this.

1141
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:32,638
My bracelet. What if they don't let us in?
They've already flagged Nathan.

1142
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:34,473
Honey, it's our only chance.

1143
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:37,351
Now listen. We can either stay
here or we can give it a shot.

1144
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:40,771
But if we give it a shot,
I swear I will get us into those bunkers.

1145
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:44,025
But if we're gonna go,

1146
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:45,651
we gotta go now.

1147
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:48,988
- Okay.
- Okay.

1148
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:50,948
- Okay. Let's do it.
- All right.

1149
01:21:51,032 --> 01:21:52,992
Nathan, let's get ready.
We left some clothes in the guest room.

1150
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:54,619
What about the pancakes?

1151
01:21:54,702 --> 01:21:57,163
I'll make 'em. Don't worry.
They're on their way.

1152
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:07,882
Okay, Nathan.

1153
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:09,592
Go ahead,
take your clothes off.

1154
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:11,510
There you go.
All right, step in.

1155
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:13,596
Shampoo's over there.
Grab that.

1156
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,973
Okay. Go ahead.
Wash yourself.

1157
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:19,018
Good job.

1158
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:21,187
Okay. Hurry up.

1159
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,569
Hey.

1160
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:39,455
You need
to pack some clothes, Dale.

1161
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:41,832
We barely have enough time
as it is.

1162
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:44,543
Ah, somebody's gotta stay
and watch Beck.

1163
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:47,088
Mary'd kill me
if I left him.

1164
01:22:47,922 --> 01:22:50,549
Man, she spent hours
in here.

1165
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:55,388
Now I can't separate the smell
from my memory of her anymore.

1166
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:56,889
God.

1167
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,599
Hay and horse shit.

1168
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:02,019
Dale,

1169
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:05,022
this isn't some storm
you can ride out.

1170
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:08,275
Look...

1171
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:12,530
I don't fold
when things get rough.

1172
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:18,661
I know you guys' marriage
was on the rocks.

1173
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:20,913
Every marriage
goes through shit.

1174
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,666
Every marriage
goes through shit.

1175
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:28,337
That don't mean you get to
jump into another woman's bed.

1176
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:32,758
You're right. I did.

1177
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:37,763
And I'm gonna have to live with
that for the rest of my life.

1178
01:23:38,848 --> 01:23:41,267
I'm not expecting
your forgiveness, Dale.

1179
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:45,396
But if I get one thing right,

1180
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:48,816
I'm gonna get my son
and my wife into that bunker.

1181
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:04,540
Please come with us.

1182
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:06,876
No.

1183
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:09,128
Why are you being
so stubborn? Just come.

1184
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,838
You know
you'll die here, Dale.

1185
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:12,882
Of course I will.

1186
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:16,844
Today, tomorrow, 10 years from now,
don't make no difference to me.

1187
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:20,014
My Mary went to heaven
in this place.

1188
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:24,602
And when the good Lord's ready
for me to join her,

1189
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:28,105
I'm gonna be right here
in this place too...

1190
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,150
bags packed.

1191
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:47,208
Nathan!

1192
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:53,297
Nathan!

1193
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:58,093
Nathan!

1194
01:24:58,177 --> 01:25:00,179
Hey. Kiddo, are you hurt?

1195
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,515
How close do you think that hit?

1196
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,141
Anything hit you?
That was close.

1197
01:25:04,225 --> 01:25:06,435
All right,
we gotta get out of here now.

1198
01:25:06,519 --> 01:25:08,771
Take my truck.
It's got a full tank of gas.

1199
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,612
Hold on, hold on.
Let me get your booster.

1200
01:25:17,488 --> 01:25:19,114
Up you go.

1201
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,786
Take care of them.

1202
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:25,621
I will.

1203
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:27,832
I know you will, son.

1204
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:33,128
Bye.

1205
01:25:43,097 --> 01:25:45,349
When will I ever see you
again, Grandpa?

1206
01:25:47,268 --> 01:25:48,394
Grandpa...

1207
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,396
Yeah, pretty soon.

1208
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:54,108
All this blows over, I'll come
up, visit you and the polar bears.

1209
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:56,652
Polar bears?

1210
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:59,822
Well, yeah. You're going
to the North Pole, right?

1211
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:02,700
Say hi to Santa for me.

1212
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:05,703
Tell him
I'm still mad about the coal.

1213
01:26:19,717 --> 01:26:22,845
I-I love you, sunflower.

1214
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:25,973
I love you too, Dad.

1215
01:26:36,317 --> 01:26:37,985
Mom would have been proud.

1216
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:40,362
Of what?

1217
01:26:41,322 --> 01:26:42,990
You finished the house.

1218
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:49,914
Bye.

1219
01:27:13,771 --> 01:27:15,147
Bye, Grandpa.

1220
01:28:03,696 --> 01:28:05,739
My friend Teddy says

1221
01:28:05,823 --> 01:28:08,701
your life flashes in front
of your eyes when you die.

1222
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:16,125
I think it would be better if
it did that while you lived.

1223
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:19,378
That way, you could see all
the good memories and be happy.

1224
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,549
I like that idea a lot.

1225
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:24,633
Me too.

1226
01:28:25,426 --> 01:28:27,428
How'd you get to be so smart?

1227
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:43,527
World leaders
scramble to create makeshift shelters

1228
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:46,697
as Clarke's largest fragment,
already deemed a planet killer,

1229
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:49,908
is on target to hit
less than 15 hours from now.

1230
01:28:49,992 --> 01:28:51,785
Other elected officials are...

1231
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:54,288
The number
of missing is up to a million

1232
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:55,998
after the Tokyo impact
earlier today.

1233
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:57,958
Jesus.

1234
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:01,545
Finally.

1235
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:03,589
At least they're going down
with the band still playing.

1236
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:05,382
That's true.

1237
01:29:12,598 --> 01:29:14,099
What?

1238
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:17,186
Do you remember
the first time you met my mom?

1239
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:18,687
Oh.

1240
01:29:18,771 --> 01:29:20,230
She was wearing a kilt!

1241
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:22,441
Kilt.
How could I forget?

1242
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:24,234
She wanted you
to feel at home.

1243
01:29:24,318 --> 01:29:26,070
She did make me feel at home,
that's for sure.

1244
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:28,655
Remember she had me try
to do the Highland fling?

1245
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:31,075
Like I know how to do the Highland fling.

1246
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:36,121
Ah, she was a good woman,
your mum.

1247
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:47,508
I heard you talking
to my dad in the barn.

1248
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:51,178
John.

1249
01:29:54,264 --> 01:29:57,226
I'm just as much to blame
about us.

1250
01:29:57,935 --> 01:30:00,145
No. No, Ali.

1251
01:30:00,813 --> 01:30:01,814
No.

1252
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,483
No matter how bad it got...

1253
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:07,111
I crossed a line,

1254
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:10,197
and you didn't.

1255
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,618
Listen.

1256
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:18,330
I'm right
where I wanna be...

1257
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:22,960
with you...

1258
01:30:23,961 --> 01:30:25,629
and Nathan.

1259
01:30:29,842 --> 01:30:30,843
Okay.

1260
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:44,189
Ah, great.

1261
01:30:44,273 --> 01:30:47,860
This is... This is the
only highway north within 50 miles.

1262
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:04,960
Please remain calm
and stay in your vehicle.

1263
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:08,213
Please remain calm
and stay in your vehicle.

1264
01:31:08,297 --> 01:31:11,508
We're working as fast as
possible to clear the highway.

1265
01:31:15,012 --> 01:31:18,307
- Is the road blocked?
- Yeah. It's a crash.

1266
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:21,268
What is it?
What's going on?

1267
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:25,314
A train derailed across the highway.

1268
01:31:26,565 --> 01:31:28,609
This is an emergency alert.

1269
01:31:28,692 --> 01:31:31,737
Small molten debris expected
to fall in upstate New York...

1270
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:34,031
- Isn't that where we are?
- Yeah.

1271
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:35,490
Seek shelter immediately.

1272
01:31:36,283 --> 01:31:37,743
Do not stand in the open.

1273
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:42,497
Seek shelter immediately.

1274
01:31:42,581 --> 01:31:44,708
We're getting out of here.

1275
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,001
Oh, my God! John, go!

1276
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:47,336
Come on.

1277
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:48,962
Small molten debris...

1278
01:31:49,046 --> 01:31:50,839
Get down on the floor!

1279
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:16,323
They're hitting everywhere!

1280
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:18,492
Get in the back!
Cover Nathan!

1281
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:20,244
I'll try to find shelter!

1282
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:22,162
Get down!
Get down, come on!

1283
01:32:54,528 --> 01:32:55,612
Stay down!

1284
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:05,914
There's a bridge. Hang on.

1285
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:10,252
We've gotta go quick!

1286
01:33:12,796 --> 01:33:14,715
Come on. Quick, quick, quick.

1287
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,133
All right? Let's go.

1288
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:18,135
Quick, quick, quick!
Come on!

1289
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:27,144
All right. Come on.
All right. Go up under the beams.

1290
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:28,812
Okay. Come on.
Come on.

1291
01:33:30,397 --> 01:33:31,606
Come here.

1292
01:33:33,025 --> 01:33:34,860
Come on!
Where are you going?

1293
01:33:38,322 --> 01:33:40,324
Hey! Hey!

1294
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:44,911
John!

1295
01:33:50,459 --> 01:33:51,793
It's okay. It's okay.

1296
01:33:51,877 --> 01:33:54,421
Hey. Come on, man! Wake up!

1297
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:56,673
Come on!

1298
01:33:56,757 --> 01:33:58,550
Okay. Let's get you
outta here.

1299
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:00,218
Come on.

1300
01:34:09,186 --> 01:34:10,437
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1301
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:33,668
Let's go.

1302
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:35,712
This is Rochester, New York.

1303
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:39,674
Everything south
of our location is on fire.

1304
01:34:39,758 --> 01:34:41,176
Anyone out there?

1305
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:43,136
Anyone make it?

1306
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:46,264
If anyone is listening...

1307
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:50,143
"The third angel
sounded his trumpet,

1308
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:54,356
and a great star, blazing like
a torch, fell from the sky.

1309
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:56,817
And they called it Wormwood."

1310
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,944
My thoughts and prayers
are with all of you.

1311
01:35:53,832 --> 01:35:56,042
We're
cutting live to Yuri Leonov,

1312
01:35:56,126 --> 01:35:59,171
who is about to give
NASA's formal statement.

1313
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:03,717
Good evening.

1314
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:08,972
At approximately 8:47 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time,

1315
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:12,184
uh, Clarke's largest fragment
will land near western Europe...

1316
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:13,935
Do we even have enough time?

1317
01:36:14,019 --> 01:36:16,313
...triggering
a series of events.

1318
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:19,357
I don't know. We got just over six hours.
Yeah, we can still make it.

1319
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:21,735
The nine-mile-wide fragment,

1320
01:36:21,818 --> 01:36:24,988
larger than the asteroid
that killed the dinosaurs,

1321
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:28,533
will destroy most of Europe
upon impact,

1322
01:36:28,617 --> 01:36:33,330
causing seismic events that will
generate 1,000-foot-high tsunamis

1323
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:39,127
and 900-degree surface winds traveling
faster than the speed of sound.

1324
01:36:39,211 --> 01:36:43,340
Within hours,
all of the continents will be on fire,

1325
01:36:43,423 --> 01:36:48,094
as the impact's molten debris rains
down from the upper atmosphere.

1326
01:36:48,178 --> 01:36:51,056
Like the previous,
uh, extinction event,

1327
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:56,561
this will kill more than 75% of
all plant and animal life on Earth.

1328
01:36:56,645 --> 01:36:58,146
Turn that thing off.

1329
01:36:59,064 --> 01:37:01,149
Where the hell is
this airport?

1330
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:10,450
What is that?
Is that it right there?

1331
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:15,330
They're taking off!

1332
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:17,165
No, there has to be more.
Let's go.

1333
01:37:17,249 --> 01:37:18,500
Hang on, Nathan!

1334
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:32,180
- There! There.
- Shit.

1335
01:37:37,686 --> 01:37:40,146
- We're catching this plane.
- Are you going on the runway?

1336
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:50,198
Hang on! Hang on!

1337
01:37:53,285 --> 01:37:55,161
- He's turning around! John!
- It's okay.

1338
01:37:55,245 --> 01:37:57,247
- He's coming right at us!
- I know what I'm doing.

1339
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,543
Stop. Stop.

1340
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:05,088
Come on, now.
Come on, now.

1341
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:09,634
Told you.

1342
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:18,602
He looks pissed.

1343
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:20,562
Wouldn't you be?

1344
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:29,738
Hey.

1345
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:31,740
What the hell
are you doing, man?

1346
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:35,535
Listen, my... my wife and my kid,
we're trying to get to Greenland.

1347
01:38:35,619 --> 01:38:37,454
You're going there.
We were selected.

1348
01:38:37,537 --> 01:38:39,956
We're already at capacity.
There'll be more planes tomorrow.

1349
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:42,000
Or there won't be
a tomorrow! Come on!

1350
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:44,711
I put everyone in danger
if I take you!

1351
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:48,340
Then take
my wife and son.

1352
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:50,008
I can't risk it.

1353
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:51,926
Then we're not moving,
all right?

1354
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:54,929
We're staying there,
and you're not going anywhere!

1355
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:02,145
Okay, I can take the kid,
maybe your wife.

1356
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:05,273
No! We all go!
You're gonna take all of us!

1357
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:09,319
How much do you weigh?

1358
01:39:10,195 --> 01:39:11,529
Uh, 180, 185.

1359
01:39:11,613 --> 01:39:12,822
Come on!

1360
01:39:12,906 --> 01:39:15,659
205, maybe 210.

1361
01:39:15,742 --> 01:39:18,953
I'll be driving to Greenland
at this point.

1362
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:21,915
But get in. No luggage!
And move the goddamn truck!

1363
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:23,833
- I will.
- Thank you!

1364
01:39:23,917 --> 01:39:25,627
Go, guys. I'll go.

1365
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:30,131
Okay,
try to find an empty seat.

1366
01:39:30,215 --> 01:39:31,508
Sorry.

1367
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:33,593
Sorry, everybody. I am.

1368
01:39:33,677 --> 01:39:37,597
Here. We can put the kids on our laps.
Make some room for you guys.

1369
01:39:37,681 --> 01:39:39,808
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

1370
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:42,644
Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much.

1371
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:44,104
Hang on. Okay.

1372
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,610
You should re-dress that.
Looks bad.

1373
01:39:50,694 --> 01:39:55,031
There's some burn butter in there. Gauze.
Peroxide. A few painkillers too.

1374
01:39:56,116 --> 01:39:57,117
Appreciate it.

1375
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:25,371
What do you see?

1376
01:41:26,539 --> 01:41:28,208
Dad!

1377
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:30,460
Whoa, buddy. He's still
a little bit hurt.

1378
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:32,754
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1379
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:34,672
I love you too, kiddo.

1380
01:41:35,799 --> 01:41:36,966
How are you feeling?

1381
01:41:38,426 --> 01:41:39,594
Terrible.

1382
01:41:41,888 --> 01:41:43,598
But we made it.

1383
01:41:57,695 --> 01:41:58,696
Hey, there it is.

1384
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:00,657
I see it! I see land!

1385
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:02,158
Look. See it?

1386
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:06,287
Yes.

1387
01:42:36,776 --> 01:42:38,319
Look at the ice.

1388
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:40,989
What do you call that?

1389
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:43,867
- Glacier! That's the glaciers.
- Yeah! Good.

1390
01:42:59,716 --> 01:43:01,009
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1391
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:03,052
It's okay.
It was just a bump. Okay?

1392
01:43:07,432 --> 01:43:09,350
Nathan, come here.
Get up here with me.

1393
01:43:09,434 --> 01:43:11,728
It's gonna be okay.

1394
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:22,280
Oh, my...

1395
01:43:24,032 --> 01:43:25,033
Oh, my God!

1396
01:43:39,005 --> 01:43:41,215
Oil pressure light's on.

1397
01:43:41,299 --> 01:43:42,717
We're losing power.

1398
01:43:46,429 --> 01:43:49,182
Dual engine failure.
Let's try for a relight.

1399
01:43:49,265 --> 01:43:51,935
- Power level's flight idle.
- Confirmed.

1400
01:43:52,018 --> 01:43:54,562
- Prop levers, feather.
- Confirmed.

1401
01:43:54,646 --> 01:43:56,689
Going for airspeed.

1402
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:03,279
Generators off.

1403
01:44:03,363 --> 01:44:05,740
- All aircraft.
- Confirmed.

1404
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:07,825
Clarke's biggest fragment is
close to entering the atmosphere.

1405
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:11,537
- Condition lever on.
- All airspace closed. Land immediately.

1406
01:44:16,876 --> 01:44:19,629
Try it again.
Right engine starter, engage.

1407
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:22,256
- Engaged.
- Yes!

1408
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:29,555
Shit. I still don't have enough lift.

1409
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:31,641
Left engine starter, engage.

1410
01:44:32,392 --> 01:44:34,268
I got nothin'.

1411
01:44:34,352 --> 01:44:37,313
We're going in hard.
Cut the engine. Fuel valve off.

1412
01:45:07,719 --> 01:45:09,262
I don't wanna fly anymore!

1413
01:45:09,345 --> 01:45:11,264
No, it's okay, baby.
We're on the ground now.

1414
01:45:11,347 --> 01:45:12,765
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

1415
01:45:12,849 --> 01:45:14,976
You guys go. Take him.
I'll go see the pilot.

1416
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:16,477
- Okay.
- Sorry.

1417
01:45:21,107 --> 01:45:22,108
Come on. Jump.

1418
01:45:24,444 --> 01:45:27,905
All airspace
is closed. Land immediately.

1419
01:45:27,989 --> 01:45:31,868
Clarke's biggest fragment is pinpointed
to hit western Europe within minutes.

1420
01:45:31,951 --> 01:45:34,495
Wherever you are,
seek shelter.

1421
01:45:34,579 --> 01:45:37,331
This is a recorded message.
Good luck, everyone.

1422
01:45:37,415 --> 01:45:39,417
Okay, hang on.
Let's get you outta here.

1423
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:43,963
All airspace is closed. Land immediately.

1424
01:45:44,047 --> 01:45:46,132
Go.

1425
01:45:47,592 --> 01:45:48,593
Go.

1426
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:52,972
Look.

1427
01:45:55,016 --> 01:45:56,851
All airspace is closed.

1428
01:45:56,934 --> 01:45:59,103
Okay, good.
We're at the airport.

1429
01:45:59,187 --> 01:46:02,523
Clarke's biggest fragment is pinpointed
to hit western Europe within minutes.

1430
01:46:02,607 --> 01:46:04,859
Wherever you are,
seek shelter.

1431
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:06,903
This is a recorded message.

1432
01:46:06,986 --> 01:46:08,196
Good luck, everyone.

1433
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:12,700
Where are the pilots?

1434
01:46:14,368 --> 01:46:15,953
Look. It's snowing.

1435
01:46:16,037 --> 01:46:17,914
That's not snow.
That's ash.

1436
01:46:19,082 --> 01:46:20,917
All right.
Listen up, everybody.

1437
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,170
I saw a military plane land
just over here.

1438
01:46:24,253 --> 01:46:25,922
It's at least a mile away.

1439
01:46:26,005 --> 01:46:28,633
We gotta go.
Come on. Let's go.

1440
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:45,942
There! There they are!

1441
01:46:46,025 --> 01:46:48,820
- Help us!
- Hey! Hey!

1442
01:46:50,655 --> 01:46:52,490
- Look, look! They see us!
- Come on.

1443
01:47:01,833 --> 01:47:03,835
Let's go!

1444
01:47:03,918 --> 01:47:06,212
The big one's gonna hit any second.

1445
01:47:12,218 --> 01:47:13,302
Hold on!

1446
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:42,456
Come on, come on.
I got you.

1447
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:44,500
- Take him.
- Come on, little guy. I got you.

1448
01:47:45,668 --> 01:47:46,836
Oh, my God!

1449
01:47:54,135 --> 01:47:56,304
Okay. Guys, let's go.
Go, go. Go on.

1450
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:58,264
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1451
01:47:59,599 --> 01:48:02,226
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

1452
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:04,687
- Keep moving!
- Blast doors closing.

1453
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:09,400
Blast doors closing.

1454
01:48:11,527 --> 01:48:13,779
Blast doors closing.

1455
01:48:13,863 --> 01:48:15,531
Let's go, let's go!

1456
01:48:15,615 --> 01:48:17,867
- Go, go, go!
- Blast doors closing.

1457
01:48:20,036 --> 01:48:22,163
Blast doors closing.

1458
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:26,375
- Blast doors closing.
- Inside! Let's go!

1459
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,670
Yes, sir.

1460
01:48:29,754 --> 01:48:32,465
The impact shock wave will
reach us in one minute 20.

1461
01:48:32,548 --> 01:48:33,674
Go! Let's go! Let's go!

1462
01:48:38,346 --> 01:48:40,181
Let's go! Let's go!

1463
01:48:43,476 --> 01:48:44,936
Go, go, go!

1464
01:48:45,019 --> 01:48:46,437
Move, move, move!

1465
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,773
Keep moving! Keep moving!

1466
01:48:56,489 --> 01:48:59,242
- Brace for impact!
- Brace for impact!

1467
01:48:59,325 --> 01:49:02,286
Brace for impact!

1468
01:49:03,371 --> 01:49:04,956
Where are the flashes?

1469
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:06,290
What flashes?

1470
01:49:06,374 --> 01:49:08,167
Before we die. The flashes.

1471
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:13,589
Listen to me, son.

1472
01:49:13,673 --> 01:49:15,549
It's okay.

1473
01:49:15,633 --> 01:49:18,636
Your mom and I love you from
the bottom of our hearts, okay?

1474
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,638
We're right here
with you.

1475
01:49:20,721 --> 01:49:24,141
So it doesn't matter what happens, okay?
Because we're together.

1476
01:49:24,225 --> 01:49:26,936
- Okay, you hear me? You hear me?
- Yes.

1477
01:49:27,019 --> 01:49:29,146
And we're always
gonna be together.

1478
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:32,191
So there's no need to be afraid.

1479
01:49:32,275 --> 01:49:34,026
We're right here, okay?

1480
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:36,362
Thirty seconds.

1481
01:49:36,445 --> 01:49:37,613
Down. Get down.

1482
01:49:46,956 --> 01:49:48,124
I love you.

1483
01:49:49,292 --> 01:49:50,793
You're my life.

1484
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:55,673
Fifteen.

1485
01:49:58,843 --> 01:50:02,471
Ten, nine, eight,

1486
01:50:02,555 --> 01:50:06,767
seven, six, five, four...

1487
01:51:22,093 --> 01:51:24,512
CQ. CQ.
This is Greenland station.

1488
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:26,222
Is anyone receiving?

1489
01:51:32,019 --> 01:51:36,816
CQ. CQ. CQ. This is Greenland station.

1490
01:51:36,899 --> 01:51:38,442

1491
01:51:41,529 --> 01:51:45,491
CQ. CQ. CQ.
This is Greenland station.

1492
01:51:45,574 --> 01:51:46,951
Is anyone receiving?

1493
01:51:51,205 --> 01:51:52,873
Greenland station?

1494
01:51:52,957 --> 01:51:54,834
This is Helsinki one-nine.

1495
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:56,919
The signal is weak,
but we read you.

1496
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:13,436
We copy, Helsinki.

1497
01:52:13,519 --> 01:52:15,312
It's sure good
to hear your voice.

1498
01:52:21,277 --> 01:52:25,030
CQ. CQ. CQ.
This is Sydney station.

1499
01:52:25,114 --> 01:52:26,866
We can hear you as well.

1500
01:52:26,949 --> 01:52:29,952
The ash is finally
clearing up here.

1501
01:52:30,035 --> 01:52:31,829
We can almost see the sun.

1502
01:52:31,912 --> 01:52:35,207
We read you, Sydney station.

1503
01:52:35,291 --> 01:52:38,002
The ash is mostly gone
here too.

1504
01:52:38,085 --> 01:52:40,171
And still no signs
of radiation.

1505
01:52:41,881 --> 01:52:44,467
We've just opened
one of the blast doors.

1506
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:47,303
It's been a long nine months
underground.

1507
01:52:50,264 --> 01:52:52,224
It's all gone.

1508
01:52:53,726 --> 01:52:54,852
All gone.

1509
01:53:14,246 --> 01:53:15,372
That a bird?

1510
01:53:15,456 --> 01:53:16,749
I don't know.

1511
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:18,918
Look!

1512
01:53:19,001 --> 01:53:20,628
There!

1513
01:53:37,853 --> 01:53:39,230
All clear.

1514
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:47,404
Greenland
station, this is Fairbanks station.

1515
01:53:47,488 --> 01:53:49,698
How's the weather out there?

1516
01:53:49,782 --> 01:53:52,535
CQ. CQ. This is New Delhi, India.
We are here.

1517
01:53:52,618 --> 01:53:55,663
Five-by-nine,
five-by-nine, São Paulo. Over.

1518
01:53:55,746 --> 01:53:59,083
Five-by-nine.
This is Moscow station. Zdravstvuyte.

1519
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:01,752
This is Buenos Aires.
It's good to be alive!

1520
01:54:01,835 --> 01:54:04,630
This is Beirut.
Hello, this is Beirut. Can you hear us?

1521
01:54:04,713 --> 01:54:07,758
Greenland station,
this is Kathmandu, Nepal.

1522
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:10,135
We are receiving you.
