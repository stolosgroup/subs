will you please
tell the table proctors

00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:29,426
that no student will be allowed
to leave this room

156
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:31,463
until every plate is clean.

Wasn`t that fun?

Don`t you wish
you had that on tape?

do you know how bad
that makes me feel?

You should think
about me sometimes.

Come on. You take my bedroom.

now that you are

Well, it must be
the post office, then.

Half the people
that work down there

I`ll send you
another check tomorrow.

I`ll drop by for it.
Tomorrow night, say?

You can bring your house guest,

From behind,
you can really see it.

I`ve been to see a lawyer,

would be very simple.

I could even keep the school.

any to begin with, I guess.

Still, if it`s
all the same with you,

605
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:43,445
I`d rather not hang
for fried chicken.

Why did you kill him?

607

You could have left him.

608
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:49,578
You could have left here.

609
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:52,948
I was underestimated.

610
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:05,000
Stop looking at it.

611

00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:12,873
Finally.

614
00:47:14,145 --> 00:47:18,411
We`re going to have to get
the net from the shed.

down there.

No.

That`s enough.
Go inside and change.

633
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:25,073
Take that up to
Dr. Baran`s office.

will you drain the pool?

641
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:44,433
I`ve got orders not to.

642
00:48:44,501 --> 00:48:46,833
But my keys are in there.

643
00:48:46,904 --> 00:48:48,201
Please?

644
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:51,634
Right away, please.

645
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:56,606
Here`s the penis

646
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,444
and the scrotum
that holds the testicles,

647
00:48:59,516 --> 00:49:02,041
or testes, inside.

648
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,053
Now, when you`re around 1 4--

649
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:05,884
maybe sooner, maybe later--

650
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:09,983
the testes start making
a chemical substance called a hormone.

651
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,961
It`s this hormone
that causes the changes.

652
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:16,898
It starts hair growing
here under your arms

653
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:19,265
and on your face.

654
00:49:19,336 --> 00:49:22,203
Mr. Gannon, what is it?

655
00:49:22,273 --> 00:49:23,706
Something blocking the drain!

656
00:49:23,774 --> 00:49:26,402
Since you want
it done right away,

657
00:49:26,477 --> 00:49:28,445
I can`t help the noise.

658
00:49:33,484 --> 00:49:35,748
You all know what sperm is?

659

01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:06,745
Come, sit down.

844
01:00:09,953 --> 01:00:11,215
Coffee, please.

845
01:00:13,623 --> 01:00:15,887
I saw you
at the sheriff`s station.

846
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:18,553
I got your name
off the view request.

847
01:00:18,628 --> 01:00:20,289
Shirley Vogel.

848
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:23,527
You`re the police?

849
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,227
Cagney And Lacey.

850
01:00:25,302 --> 01:00:26,894
That kind of thing.

851
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,403
You know, they met with me once?

852
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:29,403
Research stuff.

853
01:00:29,472 --> 01:00:30,404
Nice girls.

854
01:00:30,473 --> 01:00:33,408
I say ''girls.''
That O.K. with you?

855
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:34,966
Anyway...

856
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:36,478
flash forward 1 0 years,

857
01:00:36,546 --> 01:00:37,979
I`m on medical leave.

858
01:00:38,048 --> 01:00:39,481
The big ''C.''

859
01:00:39,549 --> 01:00:40,538
Air.

860
01:00:40,617 --> 01:00:42,608
I`m sorry.

861
01:00:42,686 --> 01:00:43,618
Ah, whatever.

862
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:45,245
I knew it was coming.

863
01:00:45,322 --> 01:00:48,382
My family--
never two boobs in a coffin.

864
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:51,621
I`m sorry, but I don`t
know why you`re here.

865
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:53,424
Remember your husband?

866
01:00:55,865 --> 01:00:57,423
Uh...

867
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,991
could I get some coffee, please?

868
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,038
You mean--

869
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:03,834
I`m sure he`ll turn up.

870
01:01:03,907 --> 01:01:05,841
Yeah. Wrapped around
a pier apparently.

871
01:01:05,909 --> 01:01:07,809
You drove all the way from...

872
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:10,311
That`s very kind of you, but...

873
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,314
Who the hell am I, right?

874
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:13,815
I don`t blame you.

875
01:01:13,883 --> 01:01:16,647
I know a guy
in the department in Hazelton.

876
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,655
I could call him,
he`ll visit, get the details.

877
01:01:19,723 --> 01:01:21,884
I don`t want
to make it official.

878
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:24,392
Suppose it`s just intentional.

879
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:25,894
[Waitress]
Here`s your coffee.

880
01:01:25,962 --> 01:01:28,226
Yeah. I know what you mean.

881
01:01:28,298 --> 01:01:29,560
Men.

882
01:01:31,968 --> 01:01:34,232
How do they sleep at night?

883
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:37,898
They have sex.

884
01:01:37,974 --> 01:01:39,908
That`s how they sleep at night.

885
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:43,172
He might be home already.

886
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,212
This place.

887
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:46,213
Jesus.

888
01:01:46,282 --> 01:01:47,943
It`s no Sizzler, is it?

889
01:01:48,018 --> 01:01:50,714
He`ll be furious
if I`ve gone to the police.

890
01:01:50,787 --> 01:01:53,722
That`s what I`m trying to tell you.
Keep it private.

891
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:55,951
Once the boys
get their hooks into you...

892
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:57,960
I couldn`t afford you.

893
01:01:58,028 --> 01:01:59,393
We run a school.

894
01:01:59,462 --> 01:02:00,554
A school?

895
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:02,564
Then you can forget the police.

896
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:05,100
You can`t afford
that kind of publicity.

897
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:07,102
Look, 2, 3 days,

898
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:10,037
I chase him down
to some girlfriend`s house,

899
01:02:10,106 --> 01:02:12,597
and I scare the shit out of him.

900
01:02:12,675 --> 01:02:14,404
That wouldn`t be easy.

901
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:16,577
Look, I--

902
01:02:16,646 --> 01:02:18,341
I don`t want money.

903
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:21,040
I mean, look at me.

904
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:22,880
I`m chasing all over
Pennsylvania

905
01:02:22,952 --> 01:02:24,385
for lunch dates

906
01:02:24,454 --> 01:02:27,389
with guys I couldn`t stand
1 0 years ago.

907
01:02:27,457 --> 01:02:29,550
Give me something to do.

908
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:34,395
You ever smoke?

909
01:02:34,464 --> 01:02:35,829
No.

910
01:02:35,899 --> 01:02:37,161
Yeah.

911
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:38,530
Well...

912
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:40,228
look at this security system.

913
01:02:40,303 --> 01:02:41,736
You know, what is this,

914
01:02:41,805 --> 01:02:43,932
a piece of the true cross?

915
01:02:45,141 --> 01:02:46,608
Aren`t you hungry?

916
01:02:46,676 --> 01:02:48,075
Oh.

917
01:02:48,144 --> 01:02:50,442
I thought I should eat.

918
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:52,913
You know what your problem is?

919
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:55,583
You`re feeling guilty.

920
01:02:55,652 --> 01:02:57,415
No.

921
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:59,318
I`m not.

922
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:01,357
It`s not your fault.

923
01:03:01,424 --> 01:03:03,085
It`s men.

924
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:05,093
Testosterone.

925
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:07,356
They should put it in bombs.

926
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:09,830
You want that?

927
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:04,349
Mrs. Baran would like me
to help...

928
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:05,785
informally.

929
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,557
Well, Ms. Vogel--
or is it detective?

930
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:13,151
Detective.

931
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:14,662
Well, frankly, Detective,

932
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:16,995
I don`t think
we need to overreact.

933
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:19,159
We`ve seen this before.

934
01:04:19,235 --> 01:04:20,668
We have?

935
01:04:22,872 --> 01:04:24,203
We, we, we.

936
01:04:24,274 --> 01:04:26,139
What is she,
the school nurse?

937
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:29,144
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

938
01:04:29,212 --> 01:04:31,407
Last Saturday.

939
01:04:32,482 --> 01:04:35,417
He was asleep
when we left at 7:00.

940
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:38,079
Nicole and I
drove out to her duplex.

941
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:39,416
Oh, look!

942
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:41,753
This must be nice--
when it`s full.

943
01:04:41,824 --> 01:04:44,418
Isn`t it dangerous
keeping it empty like this?

944
01:04:44,494 --> 01:04:47,054
Yeah. Well, we lost
some keys in there.

945
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,325
We should get back
to our students.

946
01:04:49,399 --> 01:04:51,264
They`re on work crew this week.

947
01:04:51,334 --> 01:04:52,767
Yeah. So I noticed.

948
01:04:52,835 --> 01:04:55,770
Must save money,
having the kids keep up the place.

949
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:57,271
These older buildings.

950
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,900
None of his friends
know where he is?

951
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:02,570
We haven`t asked them.
It`s kind of awkward.

952
01:05:02,645 --> 01:05:04,010
''Hey, my husband`s disappeared,

953
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,945
have you seen him?`` You know.

954
01:05:06,015 --> 01:05:07,505
Her husband.

955
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:09,518
It wouldn`t be awkward for me.

956
01:05:09,586 --> 01:05:11,019
If it`s O.K., Mrs. Baran,

957
01:05:11,087 --> 01:05:13,078
I`ll look at his address book.

958
01:05:13,156 --> 01:05:14,589
You know, Detective,

959
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:17,148
I don`t think we need
to make a mountain

960
01:05:17,227 --> 01:05:18,660
out of a molehill.

961
01:05:18,728 --> 01:05:21,196
Exactly. Imagine
this place crawling with police.

962
01:05:21,264 --> 01:05:24,199
Wouldn`t be something
you`d write home about, would it?

963
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:25,199
We`ll tiptoe.

964
01:05:25,268 --> 01:05:27,133
May I see your husband`s things?

965
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:28,465
Of course.

966
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:33,475
So nice meeting you,
Ms. Horner.

967
01:05:44,187 --> 01:05:45,814
Oh, this is lucky.

968
01:05:45,888 --> 01:05:48,083
A phone bill.

969
01:05:48,157 --> 01:05:49,749
Yeah. It came this morning.

970
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:52,621
May I?

971
01:05:58,801 --> 01:06:00,666
Ah. This must be Ms. Horner.

972
01:06:00,737 --> 01:06:01,669
Pittsburgh.

973
01:06:01,738 --> 01:06:03,137
Earlier this month.

974
01:06:03,206 --> 01:06:05,140
I--I call her there sometimes

975
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:07,676
when she goes there on weekends.

976
01:06:07,744 --> 01:06:09,336
53 minutes.

977
01:06:09,412 --> 01:06:11,004
72 minutes.

978
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,104
Girl talk.

979
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:13,341
Yeah.

980
01:06:14,851 --> 01:06:16,842
This goes through Monday.

981
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:19,888
He didn`t call you there
over the weekend?

982
01:06:19,956 --> 01:06:21,651
No.

983
01:06:21,724 --> 01:06:24,318
What kind of car
does your husband drive?

984
01:06:24,394 --> 01:06:27,329
We have one car--
the Cherokee.

985
01:06:27,397 --> 01:06:29,331
How did you break the taillight?

986
01:06:29,399 --> 01:06:31,833
I don`t know.
It happened a while ago.

987
01:06:32,602 --> 01:06:35,196
What was he wearing
when he disappeared?

988
01:06:35,271 --> 01:06:36,704
Um...

989
01:06:36,773 --> 01:06:38,331
his blue suit.

990
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:40,774
Could I see his closet?

991
01:06:40,843 --> 01:06:42,310
Yes.

992
01:06:46,616 --> 01:06:48,208
It`s missing.

993
01:06:48,284 --> 01:06:50,047
His blue suit...

994
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:52,883
and his belt
with the silver buckle.

995
01:06:52,955 --> 01:06:55,219
You just have to look
and you know.

996
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:56,588
Good for you.

997
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:58,092
Place for everything,

998
01:06:58,161 --> 01:07:00,095
and everything in its place.

999
01:07:01,164 --> 01:07:02,756
I hope we`re not too late.

1000
01:07:02,832 --> 01:07:05,494
There`s video cameras out there.

1001
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:07,001
Is that the news?

1002
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:10,005
Oh, no. It`s just
some PR for the school.

1003
01:07:10,073 --> 01:07:12,268
Is that all, Detective?
I`m really tired.

1004
01:07:12,342 --> 01:07:13,331
Of course.

1005
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:14,842
The address book?

1006
01:07:14,911 --> 01:07:16,845
It`s in his office.

1007
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:18,642
I`ll find it.

1008
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:22,676
Oh, um...

1009
01:07:22,752 --> 01:07:24,185
it`s just one more thing.

1010
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:26,847

01:15:04,246 --> 01:15:05,679
Like that topped my list--

1175
01:15:05,748 --> 01:15:07,181
God, please send me something

1176
01:15:07,249 --> 01:15:10,184
that`ll wear black nylon socks
to bed every night.

1177
01:15:10,252 --> 01:15:11,685
My idea of heaven

1178
01:15:11,754 --> 01:15:14,348
is a place where
they screw you barefoot.

1179
01:15:14,423 --> 01:15:16,687
I should pass
a hat for you.

1180
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:18,192
Don`t feel sorry for me.

1181
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:19,693
I got him to leave.

1182
01:15:19,762 --> 01:15:21,696
Every cloud has a silver lining.

1183
01:15:21,764 --> 01:15:23,698
He was too dull to kill.

1184
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:25,199
What about her?

1185
01:15:25,267 --> 01:15:27,201
She ever want to kill
her husband?

1186
01:15:27,269 --> 01:15:28,702
Why would she do that?

1187
01:15:28,771 --> 01:15:31,365
Maybe she found out
you were sleeping with him.

1188
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,771
Oh, that`s so clever.

1189
01:15:32,842 --> 01:15:35,777
What`d you do, ask
a faculty member or any student?

1190
01:15:35,845 --> 01:15:38,609
I know. You read it
in the brochure, right?

1191
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:39,943
So she knew?

1192
01:15:40,015 --> 01:15:41,448
Of course she knew.

1193
01:15:41,517 --> 01:15:42,449
Ask her.

1194
01:15:42,518 --> 01:15:44,281
Come on,
she`s not a murderer.

1195
01:15:44,353 --> 01:15:46,617
She`s an ex-nun
for Christ`s sake.

1196
01:15:46,689 --> 01:15:48,122
Yeah. Remember them?

1197
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:51,125
They disappeared overnight
like dial phones.

1198
01:15:51,193 --> 01:15:53,889
What about you?
What if he wouldn`t leave her?

1199
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:56,898
Honey, if I couldn`t get
a man to leave her,

1200
01:15:56,966 --> 01:15:59,059
I wouldn`t kill him.
I`d kill myself.

1201
01:15:59,134 --> 01:16:00,999
Well, he has left her...

1202
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:02,002
apparently.

1203
01:16:02,071 --> 01:16:03,504
One way or another.

1204
01:16:05,241 --> 01:16:06,503
Well...

1205

anything else...

Yeah, there is.
Just one more thing.

1207
01:16:11,914 --> 01:16:13,609
Guy did it barefoot.

1208

''Did,'' Ms. Horner?

1209
01:16:17,686 --> 01:16:19,847
Don`t you mean ''does''?

1210
01:16:29,598 --> 01:16:30,895
Mrs. Baran?

1211
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:34,201
It`s dinner time, Erik.

1212
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:36,864
You should go inside
with the others.

1213
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:38,964
Are you O.K.?

1214
01:16:40,442 --> 01:16:42,307
You know the rules, Erik.

1215
01:16:42,378 --> 01:16:45,313
Your table won`t be able
to eat before you`re there.

1216
01:16:45,381 --> 01:16:47,315
It`s so much nicer here

1217
01:16:47,383 --> 01:16:48,941
since he left.

1218
01:16:49,018 --> 01:16:51,646
I hope he never comes back.

1219
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:01,662
Where did you find those?

1220
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:03,163
I found them yesterday.

1221
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:05,166
Give them to me.

1222
01:17:06,568 --> 01:17:09,162
They`re good, though.
They`re just a little rusty.

Give them to me!

1224

Doesn`t mean anything.

1225
01:17:23,752 --> 01:17:25,185
The pool was empty,

1226
01:17:25,254 --> 01:17:27,848
and maybe he saw them
at the bottom.

1227
01:17:28,924 --> 01:17:30,653
I didn`t. Did you?

1228

If they were so plain
to see...

1229
01:17:34,096 --> 01:17:36,030
Don`t you see what it means?

1230
01:17:36,098 --> 01:17:38,032
Yeah. It means
we overlooked them.

1231
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,863
It means Guy`s watching us.

1232
01:17:39,935 --> 01:17:41,527
He`s alive.

1233
01:17:41,603 --> 01:17:42,729
He`s dead,

1234
01:17:42,805 --> 01:17:44,705
and I`m not sorry.

1235
01:17:46,108 --> 01:17:47,541
And neither are you,

1236
01:17:47,609 --> 01:17:49,702
if you`re really honest
with yourself.

1237
01:17:49,778 --> 01:17:51,871
Killing him
is a good thing--

1238
01:17:51,947 --> 01:17:53,972
like planting a tree.

1239
01:17:55,117 --> 01:17:56,709
Maybe there is a God.

So when the pool was empty,

1243
01:18:06,996 --> 01:18:09,931
I thought, maybe there is a God.

1244
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:12,490
And He knows what we did,

1245
01:18:12,568 --> 01:18:14,559
and He`s coming for us.

1246

It`s not God, honey.

1247

That`s a lady detective
with one breast.
