What can I get you, bro?

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,800
Two packs of Marlboros, 
some Sno Balls and a jumbo coke.

00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,000
- Oh, thank you!
- You look Lovely today.

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,000
Hey Johnny, how are you?

7
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,800
- Hey Grabelski!
The boss is looking for you.

8
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,800
Aw, don't worry about him.

9
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,300
Grabelski!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,200
- I'm going to! If I could just, I'm going to ..
- What's up boss?

<i>Hello,</i> Heather!

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
All right, Grabelski, what's going on here?

13
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,800
What?

14
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,700
You got another priority package for Timberline Inc.
And once again, there is a special request for you!

15
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,400
You know, you've been going over there alot lately,
you got a little something going on over there?

16
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,300
Uh, maybe...

17
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,800
- Grabelski, you're living in a dream world!
- So?

18
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,200
So! Dream on your own time
"10AM guaranteed" means 10AM, guaranteed!

19
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll get to you after work.

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
This place gives me the "willy's"...

21
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's make this fast. 
Give them the package and get the " tip."

22
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Hello...

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Anybody home?

24
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,200
Hey, Mr. Bragdon?

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's me, Max.

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,600
And it's 10 o'clock sharp. Just like you said

27
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,000
Just give me that 50 dollar tip...

28
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,300
...and I'll be on my way!

29
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Sir...?

30
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Hey boss...

31
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
...where are you?

32
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,700
Hey...

33
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,300
...you in here?

34
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,700
Mmm! Boy, something smells good.

35
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Hello...

36
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Hey Mr. B...

37
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
What's cooking? Ha! ha

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
Oh God! Fire!

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Mr. Bragdon!

40
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Are you in there?

41
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
Are you in there?

42
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
- FBI, you're under arrest!
- There's a fire in there!

43
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,000
Put your hands up, Grabelski!

44
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,200
But, there's a fire in there!

45
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,900
FBI, you are under arrest!

46
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,900
You idiot!

47
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Hey, I'm telling you, there is a fire in there!

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,300
- Yea ...and you started it!
- I did not!

49
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,100
Alright, don't, don't, don't do anything stupid.

50
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,300
Try and stop me!

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,800
Hey! We're going to get you! Your mine!

52
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
The FBI is going to get you , boy!

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
Freedom Express!

54
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,200
- Marty, it's me, Max.
- Grabelski, what the hell is going on with you?
There's a guy on TV says you killed somebody!

55
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,200
I know, but it's not true! I didn't do it!
I was set up!

56
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,600
A set-up? What are you talking about?

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,200
I got to know, if there is another package for Timberline Inc! 
For Reinhardt Bragdon!

58
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,200
What the hell does 
Reinhardt Bragdon got to do with anything?

59
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Because, that's the guy I killed!

60
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Oh, so you did kill somebody!

61
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,200
No! I told you, I was framed! 
<i>-Marty, the package!</i>

62
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,400
All right, all right.

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,900
We believe the murderer 
is a man, named Max Grabelski.

64
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:29,200
The motive is robbery. A million dollars of old money, 
which was scheduled to be taken out of circulation has been recovered.

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,300
Mr. Bragdon, who's job it was to destroy this old currency, 
uncovered the crime and he was murdered for it.

66
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,000
Marty! Marty!

67
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,200
His body was burned beyond recognition and 
we had to identify him using only his teeth.

68
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,500
- It was gross, I'm telling you. 
It was really, really gross!

69
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,800
Marty!

70
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,200
Marty!

71
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,700
Your in luck. I found it.

72
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,200
It says, it is supposed to be 
delivered on Monday.

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,500
That's three days. Same address?

74
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,200
No, it says this package is going to 
some place called ...Devil's Peak?

75
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,600
That's up in the mountains.

76
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Mountains?

77
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,500
Who the hell goes to the mountains?

78
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,500
Come on guys! Keep climbing.
We're almost there!

79
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,400
I'm slipping, Gordy! 
I'm scared!

80
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,700
Don't worry, Fishman. I got you.

81
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,700
This reminds me of the time 
I scaled Kilimanjaro!

82
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,200
We're going to make it!
We're going to make it!

83
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,000
Hey, can I play, too?

84
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,500
Kid, go home!

85
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
We're not playing, we're practicing.

86
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,500
You guys are silly.

87
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,000
Hey, Troop 12, 
your scout leader's here!

88
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,500
Hi mom...

89
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Hi guys...

90
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,500
Hey, go on inside. We have a new project.
We're going to get our cooking badges.

91
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,300
Pudding!

92
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,000
Gordy, you're suppose to get your cooking badge, 
by roasting a porcupine with a magnifying glass!

93
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
This is Home Ec!

94
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,100
Hey, check it out! 
Lynn Straders in her underwear!

95
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Let me see!

96
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,300
Oh, sorry! She just ducked 
behind the Kligman's house

97
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,800
Barnhill, you're such a liar!

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,200
You're such a shrimp!

99
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,200
Take that back!

100
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,000
Make me shrimp!

101
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,300
- Liar!

102
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,700
Oh, that hurt alot!

103
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,900
It says here that mini-marshmallows in 
chocolate pudding, creates a visual feast.

104
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Aah! He's crazy!

105
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,800
For our fire badge, we had 
a weenie roast in your backyard!

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,500
Give her a break, Ralph, ok?

107
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,800
We've been giving her 
a break for six months!

108
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,300
Hey, hey. What's 
going on in here?

109
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,000
Come on. Settle down guys.

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
I have a surprise for you.

111
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
- Another surprise!
- Don't worry. It'll get better.

112
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,700
It can't get worse.

113
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Guys...

114
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,000
I'd like you to meet Kelsey Jordan. 
She's the newest member of the troop.

115
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
What troop?

116
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,500
Our troop, dear.

117
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,000
Ranger Scouts are for guys.

118
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,700
Yeah. Guys in aprons!

119
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,700
<i>- Ranger Scouts.</i>
Yes. Um ..can I rent a Scout Leader?

120
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,800
<i>Step away from the vehicle!</i> 
<i>You are too close to the vehicle!</i>

121
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Got your keys?

122
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,500
Yes.

123
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
Good!

124
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,100
I hate to do this, but...

125
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Hey, mister!

126
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,800
I got to make a dookie.

127
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,700
I got to make a dookie!

128
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,100
My mom says that the guy who is taking us, 
has hiked all over the world!

129
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,000
He won't be half as good as the guide 
me and my dad had in the Serengeti.

130
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Barnhill, if your dad is so freakin cool, 
then why isn't he our scout leader?

131
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Oh Yeah! 
Spies have a lot of time for scouts 

132
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Pills, pills! Stay in the front seat.

133
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,000
Air bag, son. 
Air bag.

134
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
Hey, where's Dana?

135
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
His dad wouldn't sign his permission slip, 
says he isn't big enough to go.

136
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,300
Parents!

137
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,997
- Nice dolls!

138
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,500
- Did you bring a pretty pink umbrella 
in case it starts to rain?

139
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,700
No, I figured we could all just crouch under 
a pair of your underwear and wait it out!

140
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
- Oh rejected! Ha! ha!

141
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
Ok. Everybody buckle up!

142
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,600
Bye!...

143
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,700
Wait !!!

144
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Please wait!

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Dana, what are you doing here, honey? 
I thought your dad said you couldn't come.

146
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,800
He changed his mind. 
Here, my permission slip.

147
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,600
Well, good for you.

148
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Good job, Dana! 
We're going on a real overnight now!

149
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,800
This guy, Patterson? 
Did he really kill a mountain lion?

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's what they said...

151
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
He climbed K2 with a broken ankle?...

152
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Yep, he saved ten people from an avalanche.

153
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,300
I can't wait to meet this guy!

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,400
Where the heck am I?

155
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,000
Handi-capped ...huh?

156
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
Hey there...

157
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,900
Need a little information.

158
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,000
They're talking about the guy 
who killed that banker.

159
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,500
Police have released photos...

160
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,300
Excuse me!

161
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm looking for a place called Devils Peak.

162
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,400
Devils Peak?

163
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,300
Mmm... the turn-off is a couple miles north.

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But, that's a tough climb. What kind 
of a car you driving?

165
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,300
The one parked in the handi-capped zone!

166
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,500
"I am an inconsiderate person"

167
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,900
Hey, Sergeant Doofus, did you paste 
that note to my window?

168
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,500
That's right, cupcake! 
A little lesson in common decency.

169
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,200
What?

170
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:34,000
Sure, it'll be a little trouble getting it off, just like the trouble you would have caused some handi-capped person had they needed to pull in here and relieve themselves!

171
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,000
Hey, hey! I just heard on the TV, that 
Mad Max is heading this way.

172
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,300
He's driving a stolen Volvo.

173
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,500
A blue Volvo station ...wagon.

174
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,000
coming this...

175
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,000
All right! Freeze!

176
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,000
Take it easy!

177
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,700
Now, you are going to pretend to me.

178
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,800
Give yourself up, boy?

179
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,800
Give me that glue!

180
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,300
You still got a chance to 
be a fine young scout!

181
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Where is that glue!?

182
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,800
Top pocket!

183
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,400
Put your palms up!

184
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,700
- OK. Grab a hold of the wheel!
- Are you nuts?

185
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,200
I said, grab the wheel!

186
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,000
Come on! I have a gun for chrissakes!

187
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
You're going to pay for this, mister.

188
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Now, put your chin there.

189
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,800
- You do know this stuff is permanent!
- Do it!

190
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,800
Hey, I can't drive like this!

191
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,700
Just keep driving south. 
Don't stop driving until you get to Mיxico!

192
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,800
I'll be right behind you the whole time!

193
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
Don't try any funny stuff or 
I'll blow your butt off. Got it?

194
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Got it: Keep driving, no funny stuff, blow butt off.

195
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,300
Right.

196
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,500
Looks like this guy is a no-show...

197
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,800
Maybe he's picking up 
some special gear or something.

198
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,200
Get out of the way!

199
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,900
What is this a parade?

200
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,100
Would you move your wrinkled asses? 
I'm in a hurry here!

201
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,400
Yea, I am going to run you over...

202
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,300
Gotcha!

203
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,500
I swear to God, I don't know how it happened! 
It's all a big mistake!

204
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,800
You got to believe me! I'm sorry!

205
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,900
I'm so sorry!

206
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,900
Don't be so hard on your self?

207
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,300
So you're a little late...

208
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,500
I'm sure the kids are still raring to go.

209
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
Wait a minute. 
Here we go, guys!

210
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,200
I found him!

211
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,300
You guys, we're going on an overnight!

212
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,700
Yeah !!!

213
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,200
They're all yours.

214
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,500
Mine?

215
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,300
One at a time, please.
One at a time.

216
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,000
Whoa, check out the hiking shoes! 
What kind are those?

217
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,500
They're, uh ...Italian!

218
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,900
Must be those new hydro moons I've heard about.

219
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,300
Ok, settle down guys. I'm sure that Scout Leader Erickson will 
answer the rest of your questions right around the campfire.

220
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Scout Leader?

221
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,200
Can you tell us about the time you soloed the big E!

222
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,500
Yeah, tell us!

223
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,500
The time I what?

224
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,500
- Climbed Mount Everest.
- Tell us. Please...

225
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,500
Everest? Uh...

226
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,000
Well...

227
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,200
It was a bitch!

228
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,500
Oh, let me tell you. 
Them Alps ...they can get pretty..

229
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
...steep!

230
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,200
I would imagine they could.

231
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,000
I thought Mount Everest was in the Himalayas.

232
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,000
- Huh?
- Yea, she's right!

233
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,300
Yeah. Oh, yeah! Yes....But uh ...

234
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
I had to cross the Alps to get there.

235
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,300
The man's a God.

236
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,100
Wow. That's quite a hike!

237
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Oh ho! ha! ha!

238
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Let's get our stuff together.

239
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,700
It's time for our sleepover in the woods.

240
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Sleepover in the woods?

241
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm Aggie Patterson. Hi.

242
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:27,600
I just wanted to say, that I think it's wonderful thing, that a man of your achievement has taken the time for the youth of America.

243
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,500
Wh ...ha ...whew?

244
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,800
(exhales!)

245
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,800
Oh. And Mr. Erickson. 
I like to keep the kids ...gum free.

246
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Thank you.

247
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,500
Well, sir.
Off you go!

248
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Hey, sir? Can we make smores?

249
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
- Cause I brought graham crackers...
- What the hell am I doing here?

250
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,900
- Can you teach me how to whittle?

251
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Bye...

252
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Hey...

253
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,500
How come you didn't bring a pack, sir?

254
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
What do you mean...

255
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
In fact. I brought two.

256
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Who's got a light?

257
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
I do.

258
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,000
You're not going to leave that 
on the floor, are you?

259
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,000
Your right.

260
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,500
Got to cover my tracks!

261
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,000
What's he doing?

262
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,700
Alright, bunk 12...

263
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
I want you to walk.

264
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,800
I want you to walk away from here and 
walk to where ever it was you were going.

265
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And I will disappear. Into the jungle. And from a safe distance, 
I will evaluate your walking skills

266
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,200
- Oh?
- Alright.

267
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,500
Alright, walk. Walk away.

268
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Bye, bye!

269
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,900
Looking good!

270
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,700
Ok. 
I'm out of here.

271
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,500
Guys, stand up straight. 
Remember, he's watching.

272
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,000
Help! Help me!

273
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Help! Help!

274
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,000
- Mr. Erickson!

275
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,200
Would it be all right, 
if we called you "Spider"?

276
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,200
Why the hell would you 
want to call me that?

277
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,800
Because, it's your nickname?

278
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,000
Well fine then. Call me "Spider."

279
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,200
Spider. Spider... Spider!

280
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
WHAT!

281
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,700
How come your nickname is Spider?

282
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Because, I once killed a kid, who called 
me Spider one time too many!

283
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,000
How could they call you Spider one time too many, 
if your nickname wasn't already Spider?

284
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Spider! Spider! Spider!

285
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Grabelski, put your hands up 
and step out of the vehicle!

286
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
I can't!

287
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,200
I repeat: Put your hands up 
and step out of the vehicle!

288
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,300
And I repeat: I can't!
You've got the wrong guy!

289
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,000
You don't come out, peacefully, we 
are going to take you out by force!

290
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
No, no! Wait! 
Wait!

291
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,200
I'm glued ..!

292
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,000
AHH !!!

293
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:07,000
This is it? We finally go on an overnight 
and we end up at Gran Central Station?

294
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,000
It's better then my back yard.

295
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
Not by much.

296
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,000
Let's show Spider, we know 
what we are doing.

297
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,600
Where is Spider, anyway?

298
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,500
Ahh! Help me!

299
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,500
They're eating me alive!

300
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,200
Here. Try my bug repellent.

301
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,500
Oh, Good!

302
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Thank you.
That's good.

303
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,700
That's a little Tangy. [Throwing up...]

304
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,200
The manual says, 
"Always find level ground to pitch your tent on."

305
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
Let's do that.

306
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,000
Too bad we can't go to Coyote Flats.
That's only two miles.

307
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,500
And Red Rock Bluff is only 4 miles, but I guess 
that's kind of far for a little Miss Ranger Scout.

308
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,500
Oh yea, I could get all the way to Devils Peak and back 
before you could get your compass out!

309
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Oh right, seriously.

310
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Devils Peak?

311
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,000
How do you know about Devils Peak?

312
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Um ....its there ..

313
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,500
right behind your head.

314
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,000
"Devils Peak"

315
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,200
I don't know , sir. 
Looks like a pretty tough climb.

316
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,000
It says class six. That means 
only the most experienced climbers

317
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,000
How tough could it be? It's this far!

318
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,700
What are you guys? 
A bunch of Tenderfoots?

319
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Not yet ,sir. We need six more badges.

320
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Badges?

321
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,400
Well let me tell you how you are 
going to get those badges!

322
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
By matching your wits against that mountain!

323
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
By taking everything that bad boy has to offer 
and getting good old Max to where he needs to go.

324
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,400
Who's Max?

325
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,100
Max?

326
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Who's Max?

327
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,500
Max ...is all of us! Because we are 
going to push ourselves to the max!

328
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
YEA!

329
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,500
- Are you with me?
- YEA!

330
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,800
To Devils Peak?

331
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,800
- To Devils Peak!
- All right! Let's go!

332
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,300
Officer, Officer...

333
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,200
What's happening with the children?

334
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,200
Ma'am, I don't know. 
You just have to wait for the Feds.

335
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,200
What Feds? What's going on?

336
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
- I don't know.
- Somebody must know?

337
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,200
What the hell gave you the right 
to take away my little Dana?

338
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Mr. Jareki, he had a permission slip, 
like everybody else!

339
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,200
Come on lady, you can't tell the difference 
between my signature and a little ten year old's?

340
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Dana!

341
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,000
Dana!

342
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,600
Who's Agatha Patterson?

343
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,900
I am.

344
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,700
Excuse me sweetheart, is this 
the man you think took the kids?

345
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes, it is.

346
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,200
We've got a fugitive 
on the loose here, people.

347
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,200
He is armed, he is dangerous. 
And he's got himself some hostages.

348
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,600
What are you talking about! 
Help Aggie! Aggie? Help!

349
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
- What are you doing!
- Oh Dear me! Somebody get her some water!

350
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,200
This Scout is ready. Now let's get going?

351
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,200
Ready for what? 
We're going after this guy alone.

352
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,800
Trust me G-man. You don't take me, you 
won't get within 2000 vertical feet of this guy

353
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,500
Listen pal, I know this Grabelski. And I'm just as good in the woods 
as he is. And I don't have six little hostages slowing me down.

354
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,800
Without me ...you got no chance.

355
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,800
Ok. You come along.

356
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,600
Just remember one thing:

357
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,700
I call the shots. You ..
just do the tracking.

358
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,800
Are we there yet?

359
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,000
Spider, are you alright?

360
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,000
Fishman, give me a match.

361
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,700
One second. I'm working on 
my bird-watching badge.

362
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I see a scrub jay and a nuthatch
and a SWAT team!

363
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,400
What?

364
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,600
Police ...lots of them!

365
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,000
- Oh boy! Oh boy!

366
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,000
I've got to hide!

367
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,800
We have got to hide!

368
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,100
You mean wilderness survival?

369
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Right!

370
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,100
Come on! Come on! We've got to 
make up ground while we still got the light.

371
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
- See anything?
- Not yet, sir.

372
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Spider, shouldn't we be on a regular trail?

373
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,400
Kid, ...questions like that 
could get us killed.

374
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,200
- A little cooler than my mom, huh?
- Oh, yeah!

375
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,100
What?

376
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,700
What?

377
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,200
What? What? What? What?

378
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,800
Spider, look!

379
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,400
That's the big deal?

380
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,200
It's Winnie the Pooh!

381
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
Hey, Boo Boo.

382
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,600
What's the matter? You lost?

383
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,000
No collar, must be a stray.

384
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,100
Spider, I don't think that's a good idea.

385
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,000
Oh relax. He's a pussycat.

386
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,000
Uh, Spider, maybe you shouldn't.

387
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,500
Come on. Give me your paw.

388
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,300
He's sucking my thumb!

389
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,300
That's not the one I saw.

390
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,400
What?

391
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,500
That' not the one I saw!!!

392
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,700
Nice kitty!

393
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,200
My God, he's dead!

394
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,800
No, no he's not dead! It says in the manual. When you 
are attacked by a bear, you are suppose to play dead.

395
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,100
Whoa, he's a monster!

396
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Ohh ... that's not good!

397
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,000
Spider!

398
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,200
I must say, that was an awesome demonstration 
of how to handle a bear attack!

399
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,300
Spider?

400
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,300
What's he doing?

401
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,400
- Spider?
- Wake him up!

402
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,000
Auntie EM?

403
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,500
What happened?

404
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You were attacked by a giant grizzly bear!

405
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,200
Oh, but you played dead like a genius!

406
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,700
Yea, it was incredible!

407
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Of course I did!

408
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,300
And I do not want to have to show 
you guys that one again, ok?

409
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,500
Alright, now let's move out! Come on.

410
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,300
Move. Get out of here. 
March on. March away!

411
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
March...

412
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,400
I'm alive !!!

413
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,200
Little tougher than the StairMaster, 
eh, G-man? Heh.

414
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,500
Hey. Listen, iron balls.
You take your time!

415
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I know guys like this Grabelski, 
when the pressure's on, they crack.

416
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Scouts chanting to the tune of " Sound Off."
We sing and sing  'cause that's our thing.

417
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,500
You know this song will never end. 
Cause when it's done we start again.

418
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,700
1, 2, 3, 4.

419
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,500
We're Troop 12, the scouts' top crew.
We're honest, kind, and real fun, too.

420
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,200
We yell hurrah, we yell hooray.
We run and dance and sing and play.

421
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
We do good deeds, we help our friends...

422
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,700
Alright! 
Knock it off!

423
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,500
What is that? 
"We run and dance and sing and play"?

424
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,500
My mom kind of wrote the words.

425
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,200
Well, they suck! OK.

426
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,300
What?!

427
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,300
I got to pee, I got to pee!

428
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
So who's stopping you?

429
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,700
30 years of scouting tells me, 
we've made up a good chunk of ground.

430
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Hey! Ah, ha ha!

431
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,500
Oh, that's the ticket! 
A little spritz of cool clean mountain rain!

432
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,000
Shake your lizard.
Let it drain!

433
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,800
Move your hips 
and spell your name!

434
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,200
Send it straight 
and send it hard.,

435
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,200
Now a sword fight. 
Go! En garde!

436
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
I got some bad news for you, Palmer.

437
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,000
That ain't rain.

438
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,000
Eat your veggies.
Eat your starches,

439
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Lean back, boys!
Golden arches!

440
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,400
Whew. Alright.

441
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,200
Now, flip 'em and zip 'em 
and let's get moving.

442
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,500
- Hey. You. Don't move!

443
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,700
Spider, we just pissed on some guy's head!

444
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,000
- You!

445
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,700
Oh, fu...dge!

446
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,500
Run!

447
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,400
Running badge time!

448
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Come on!

449
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,200
Let's get vertical!

450
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,500
Wait. You expect me to climb 
up there with just my hands?

451
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,800
That's right doughboy! 
That's how it's done.

452
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,300
Hey, how about when you get up there, 
you throw me down a ladder?

453
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,300
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

454
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,000
[Palmer]
I think I pulled something.

455
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,000
Come on G-man! 
They're getting away.

456
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Come on! Come on!

457
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,100
Put your left hand on the rock, 
higher above your head.

458
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,500
Well, what are you waiting for? 
Get going!

459
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,800
Spider, are you sure that bridge is safe?

460
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,400
Why, what's the matter, you scared?

461
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,000
Let me tell you something, honey:

462
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,200
There's nothing wrong with being afraid.

463
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,300
Spider, I'm afraid, too!

464
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,500
Shut up, you gutless worm,
I'm talking to her!

465
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,000
Put your right foot up there!

466
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,700
Put the right .. No, the left!
Your feet are crossed! His feet are crossed.

467
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,300
Come on, we can't just stand here, 
we gotta move!

468
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
I'll go first.

469
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,700
You will?

470
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Let's go!

471
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,900
All of you, move it. 
Come on!

472
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,100
Hey guys...

473
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,100
It's easy!

474
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,800
Jeez, Gordy! 
Quit goofing around!

475
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
Gordy, you ok?

476
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,300
- We gotta move faster, man, come on!
- No!

477
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,000
Safety first. We got to go slow.

478
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,000
Safety?

479
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,300
Safety first.

480
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,100
I'll be right back!

481
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,500
Keep going!

482
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,800
Come on man! They're getting away!

483
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,800
- Help me up.
- How much do you weigh?

484
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,000
This guy weighs a damn ton!

485
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Oh, no!

486
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Run!

487
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,300
Run!

488
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,700
Go!

489
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Run!

490
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,500
Run! Run! 
Go, go, go!

491
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,000
Go, go, go!

492
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Move it, come on!

493
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,000
Faster, you little...!

494
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,500
Move it, come on, keep going!

495
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,000
Go!

496
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,700
Run!

497
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,500
Spider? Sir?

498
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Fishman?

499
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,300
We got them!

500
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,800
Fishman, get over here!

501
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,500
I can't! I'm having a little vertigo!

502
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,800
I'm stuck!

503
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,000
I don't believe it!

504
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,700
Spider! Are you nuts? 

505
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,300
Maybe, I am.

506
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Now, get over here!

507
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,500
Stay with me, G-man!
Stay with me!

508
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Alright, here we go!

509
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,000
Goodbye, Grabelski!

510
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,200
Hello, one million!

511
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,300
Don't you dare! 
There's a scout on that bridge!

512
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,900
Come on!

513
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,400
Get over here !!!

514
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,300
You may find this hard to believe, 
but I am a little bit of a coward!

515
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:57,000
You are not a coward! You are
Milton Fishman, the superstud!

516
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,600
What?

517
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,000
Say that. Say .. 
"I'm Milton Fishman, the superstud!"

518
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,500
It will give you courage.

519
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,500
"I'm Milton Fishman, superstud"
I'm Milton Fishman, superstud!

520
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500
It's not working.

521
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
eww oof...!

522
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,200
Alright!
That's it, Fishman.

523
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Last thread.

524
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,100
It's been nice knowing you.

525
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,300
I'm Milton Fishman, superstud !!!

526
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,200
That's it!

527
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,200
Come on!

528
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,600
Come on!

529
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,600
Yeah!

530
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,300
Spider, I did it! I really did it!

531
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,600
I'm proud of you!

532
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Now, Get the hell out of here!

533
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,700
Well, tracker man!
What do we do now?

534
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,000
We got no choice.

535
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,000
Got to go around.

536
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,400
All right! Everybody stay calm.

537
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,700
We have no good news as of yet.

538
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,400
- Will you please be quiet 
and let him speak?

539
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,500
And no news... No.

540
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
"No news ... is no news!

541
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,400
unless it's good news.

542
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,800
but we have no news, so...

543
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,500
Good!

544
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,800
Spider...

545
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,100
I'm getting hungry!

546
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,400
Could we stop for a rest!

547
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,800
Wouldn't it be best if we 
camped here for the night?

548
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,000
Alright, I guess 
we bought ourselves some time.

549
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,000
Bought ourselves time for what?

550
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,200
Well, guys, we got to start a fire.

551
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,500
Better start looking for pinecones.

552
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
Pinecones?

553
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:44,500
It says in the manual, whenever your camp is surrounded 
by green wood, always use pinecones to start your fire.

554
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,400
If the manual told you to stick your weiner 
in a light socket, would you do it?

555
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,500
Check this thing out! It's huge!

556
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,700
Mine's huger!

557
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,800
Hey, guy's, there's lots 
of them up here!

558
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,500
Look at this baby! 
Big as a football!

559
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,000
Hit me, hit me!

560
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,700
Go, go!

561
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,700
Alright!

562
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,900
4, 44! ... 4, 44!

563
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
To me, Spider!

564
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,500
Red dog! Red dog! 
Hut! Hut! Hut!...

565
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,000
Deep!

566
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,800
Way back! Way back...

567
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,500
Nobody is open!

568
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,200
He's going to have to run it!

569
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,800
I don't think that's a pinecone...

570
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,200
Oh, Mother...

571
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,800
Ayyy !!!

572
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,800
You haven't had one of those seizures 
for about 20 minutes, that's a good sign!

573
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,400
How does that feel?

574
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,500
Ahh, that's good! 
That's good. Ahh!

575
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,500
He didn't know the difference 
between a beehive and a pinecone?

576
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,800
What are you thinking?

577
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,500
I don't know yet...

578
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Davy Crockett, did you catch anything yet?

579
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,400
That's right. Make jokes.
That's what's wrong with this country,

580
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
everybody wants it now.

581
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,000
Nobody, is willing to hunt down, 
what they really need.

582
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,600
That's what I try to teach my kids.

583
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,400
To hunt down the goodness in life.

584
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,500
You might say, "I'm the thin tacky line 
between morality and depravity."

585
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,200
And friend,

586
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,000
there's no telling what kind of depravity, 
Grabelski, is up to right now.

587
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,000
Here we go. Here we go.

588
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,700
Hey...

589
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,500
I got the tent up!

590
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,400
What are you working on?

591
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,200
It's a crystal diode receiver.

592
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,200
You know what that is, right?

593
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
Yes, of course I do.

594
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
Oh, yes...

595
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,800
That is a beauty.

596
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,200
That's the toolbox.

597
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,900
Well...

598
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
Guys!

599
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,300
Look what I got!

600
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,800
Whoa! What is this!

601
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,000
Bet you never seen anything 
like that before huh, Barnhill?

602
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,000
Probably don't know anything 
about the birds and the bees! Butthead.

603
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,600
Oh, and you do?

604
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,500
Yeah, that's right, I do.

605
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,800
Oh, yeah?

606
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,300
Well, than explain it to us?

607
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,000
Well, I...

608
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I know it's about making babies...

609
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,500
And that it takes a man and a woman...

610
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,700
to make it work right...

611
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,200
and that they both 
have to go in a room...

612
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
and they both take their shirts off...

613
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,000
No, no, no! The man doesn't 
have to take his shirt off! 

614
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,500
Just the woman!

615
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,700
Oh...

616
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Hey!

617
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,700
What have you kids got there?

618
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Give me that!

619
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,500
You guys shouldn't be looking at this!

620
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
Spider?

621
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,700
Could you tell us about 
the birds and the bees?

622
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,500
I don't think I'm really 
the right person to...uh

623
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,300
It says in the manual that, the Scout Leader 
is suppose to tell us about that kind of stuff!

624
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,300
Really?

625
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,700
Yea, really!

626
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,700
Yep.

627
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,500
Well, if it says in the manual...

628
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,800
All right...

629
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,800
Hey, let me borrow your dollies, honey.

630
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,200
Ok.

631
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:47,800
Once upon a time, there was a man dolly 
and there was a lady dolly.

632
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,200
And they fell in Love.

633
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,500
Tonight, on EyeWitness America,

634
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Scout's Honor - the hostage crisis. Day one.

635
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,500
Oh my ...my. 
Our son's a hostage.

636
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,500
Let me tell you something: 
Whatever he is going through right now, 
I'm holding you personally responsible!

637
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,500
Work it, baby! Work it!
Oh, that's good! Oh!

638
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,500
That's it, oh, right there.
Oh, that's good! Hee. Hee. Ha. Ha.

639
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,300
OH! OH! OH! That's it.
Whoa! Oh, Yea!

640
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,000
Oh, that's how Daddy likes it! 
Hee. Hee. Hee. Hee.

641
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,000
Everybody start your engines. 
Aaaa oooh ga!

642
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Then, the man has a cigarette, watches 
a little Leno ...and goes to sleep.

643
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,800
Any questions?

644
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,700
Hey, guys! Come on. I got one:

645
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,000
OK, what if a blizzard came in and 
everybody else died...

646
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:04,500
Now, you can either starve to death or 
you could eat the frozen bodies and live?

647
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,700
- I'd eat the bodies!
- But you'd eat anything!

648
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I'd eat the bodies, 
I'd probably eat the bodies...

649
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,500
Not your body, but I might 
take a chomp on you...

650
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,200
Hey Spider. You do one.

651
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,700
Me?

652
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,700
Let me see...

653
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,500
Alright.

654
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,100
What would you do 
if you were a delivery guy...

655
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,200
Ok...

656
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
your down to your last package and you pull up 
to the house and it's a huge mansion...

657
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,000
I mean the biggest house you ever saw!

658
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
You ring the bell, the door opens,

659
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,300
and there's this sharp looking guy in a suit.

660
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,000
And he pulls you inside and he says:

661
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Today, is your lucky day!

662
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I got a deal I want to make with you.

663
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,200
I've got six packages coming to me, 
over the next three weeks.

664
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,500
If you can deliver them at 10 o'clock sharp, 
when it is dark,

665
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,000
I will give you 50 dollars a package.

666
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,300
- Sounds weird...
- No, sounds pretty cool!

667
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,800
So you say to the guy: 
What's in the package?

668
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,700
He says: I can't tell.

669
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,600
Because, both of our lives 
might be in danger.

670
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
This is a good one!

671
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,000
Now, part of you knows, there's 
something fishy going on here ...

672
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,800
but the other part of you is thinking, this 
secret package stuff, might be kind of exciting...

673
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,900
Kind of like a spy, or something!

674
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:41,500
I mean, ...being a delivery guy, 
that can get kinda boring!

675
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,000
Anyway, the guy takes a real 50 dollar bill 
and he slaps in your hand.

676
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,500
And he says to you: Are you in?

677
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,800
Now, what do you do?

678
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,500
Do you take the deal?

679
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It sounds like a set-up.

680
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,200
And illegal.

681
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,000
And the guy sounds like a total criminal.

682
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,000
- Do you know him at all?
- No.

683
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,200
- Does any one go with you? Are there any witnesses?
- No...

684
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,000
- Is there any way of protecting yourself, so you're 
not blindly walking into a trap?
- No...

685
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,800
Only a sucker would fall for that...

686
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,700
or a stupid!

687
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,600
Or a moron!

688
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,500
Or an idiot.

689
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,000
Or a sleazeball.

690
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,400
Spider, do another one... 
that one was way too easy.

691
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,400
I'm going to hit the hay...

692
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,300
Ok, I'll do one.

693
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,700
Yes!

694
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,700
Can you really hear anything?

695
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,700
The thoughts and prayers 
of the entire country...

696
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,100
Ah, religious program.

697
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,000
... remain with Scout Troop 12.

698
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,000
Hey, that ...that's us!

699
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,000
Why are they talking 
about us on the radio?

700
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,200
...who are being held hostage 
by a psychotic murderer!

701
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,300
Spider?

702
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,400
His name's not Spider,
it's "Mad Max Grabelski"!

703
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,400
- It's him.
- Oh, no!

704
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,800
Guys, quiet!

705
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,000
Oh God, we are trapped with a killer!

706
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,300
A psycho killer!

707
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,900
I don't think they 
even cover that in here!

708
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,500
Come on, we're Scouts, Remember?
Let's act like it!

709
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
We're all going to die!

710
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,500
Let me at him! I'll bust him up!
I'll handle him myself!

711
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,100
Are you crazy? You midget? We're dead. 
There're never going to find us up here!

712
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,800
We'll take care of that.

713
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Hurry up, Fish!

714
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,200
"H" is two longs and one short.

715
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,300
No, no. Stop. Stop. Wait! 
Two shorts and one long.

716
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,000
Oh, Great, what are we supposed to do?
Cross that letter out?

717
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,700
God bless those little scouts!

718
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,500
What? What do you see? 
What do you see?

719
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,100
Smoke signals, right by the book.

720
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,800
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, almost.

721
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,500
Well, what do they say?

722
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,200
"Belp", "Belp."

723
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Ok, here we go.

724
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,100
Some allergy medicine,

725
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
some cough syrup,

726
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,800
and some sleeping pills.

727
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,800
Are you sure it's 
going to knock him out?

728
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,200
One sip, and he's Sleeping Beauty.

729
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Ok guys, we got a lot 
of ground to cover today.

730
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,900
Oh, God, this had better work.

731
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,600
Spider?

732
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,300
Come on, Fishman, you can do it.

733
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,100
- Make sure he drinks the whole thing.
- Don't be scared.

734
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,600
Spider!

735
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,100
Hi, hello there?

736
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:33,900
Want a drink?

737
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,800
No.

738
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,200
But you're thirsty now. I can see it!

739
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,100
Fishman! I don't want a drink!

740
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,900
What do think, Gordy?
Doesn't Spider look a little ...parched? 

741
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Yeah.

742
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,200
Give me the canteen.

743
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,300
That is good!

744
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,400
Woo! Thank you!

745
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I feel good!

746
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,600
Sleeping beauty, huh?

747
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,200
Come on guys, keep up!

748
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,300
Everybody now! 
We come proud, the Cub Scout Troop!

749
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,000
Ow! Ow!

750
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,500
I ...I sprained my ankle!

751
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Come on, Ralph!

752
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,800
Come on, shake it off.

753
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,200
Use the other one.

754
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,400
I think I sprained mine, too, Mr. Grabelski.

755
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,700
What did you call me?

756
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:11,500
I called you ...Polinski. I had a Dr. Polinski once. 
I don't know why you suddenly reminded me of him.

757
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:17,900
He treated me for cryptorchidism ... 
...Undescended left testicle.

758
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Funny! I can feel it going 
back up there right now.

759
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,800
No.

760
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,400
You called me, Grabelski.

761
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,800
How did you know my name?

762
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Oh, God...

763
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,100
How did you know my name?

764
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,500
I want some answers !!!

765
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Please don't kill us, Mad Max!

766
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,800
- We caught, Mad Max!
He's over here!

767
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Well, what do you know! I'll take six 
Ranger Scouts over one Federal man, anyday!

768
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
They captured, Grabelski!

769
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,500
I didn't do any thing!

770
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,900
We're not feeling sorry for you, you're a murderer!

771
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,500
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm innocent.

772
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,800
Well done, youths!
Ha. Ha!

773
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,000
I'm Agent Palmer, FBI.

774
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,600
I thought there were two of you?

775
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,900
No, uh, ..only me.

776
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:30,200
All right. All right. All right. You're all heroes ... 
everyone of you. Very, very, very wonderful.

777
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,200
Ok, over here.

778
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:46,000
You just wait here for the rescue team. 
I will take care of the bad guy.

779
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,600
Come on, Mad Max!
Move it! Let's go!

780
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,100
Take care, kids.

781
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,800
Get up!

782
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,200
I can prove I didn't do it!

783
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,000
Just let me get to Devils Peak!

784
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,900
- There's another package of money!
- Save it for some one who cares!

785
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,600
A helicopter!
We're saved!

786
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,300
- Where's he going?
- Something's not right...

787
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,700
Uh! What is it with you 
and the pushing?

788
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,400
I want to speak to your superior!

789
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,200
Is that him?

790
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,400
Mr. Bragdon?

791
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,500
Mr. Bragdon, you're alive!

792
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,100
Hey, he's alive!

793
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,500
Hello Maxwell.

794
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:11,200
Look, it's over. This guy's an FBI agent. 
You got to give yourself up.

795
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,400
So what! 
So the plan blew up in your face?

796
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,300
The important thing is, you have your health.

797
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And... your teeth...

798
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,900
Wait a minute! I thought they 
found your teeth in the fire!

799
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:33,500
Yes, it was a bit inconvenient having them all pulled,
but at $1 million dollars a tooth, I think it was well worth it!

800
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,000
What?

801
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,300
Kill him.

802
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,700
Kill him? I can't kill him!

803
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,300
He's just doing his job!

804
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,500
No, no, Maxwell. Not him, ... you.

805
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,200
Me?

806
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,200
Wa ..wait a minute.

807
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,100
You guys are in this together.

808
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,500
He's in on this? 
And you're with him?

809
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:06,000
And when you are done with him, 
make sure you kill the kids.

810
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,100
The kids? Hey!

811
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Come on. Move it.

812
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,600
Max was telling the truth!
We got to rescue him!

813
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,800
Yea, but, how are we going 
to beat those guys?

814
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,500
I got an idea.

815
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,700
Everybody, close your eyes.

816
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,200
Oh boy!

817
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,300
Why?

818
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,500
Why did you pick me?

819
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,900
Because, you're a pathetic loser Max. 
Nobody gives a damn about you.

820
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
You're wrong! 
We give a damn! Fire!

821
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,700
Kelsey, your training bra 
is working great!

822
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:47,900
That's the way to go, kids!

823
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,700
This is almost like 
getting to second base.

824
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,000
FIRE!

825
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,800
Keep them coming!

826
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,800
Oh no...

827
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,100
You little brats!

828
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,900
Oh, my God!

829
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,000
Not me! I'll take them both on!

830
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,300
Kiddies! Don't run away!
I just want to talk to you!

831
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Come back here!

832
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,500
- Where's Dana?
- I don't know! He's gone!

833
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,200
Come on!

834
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,600
- What are we going to do?
- We got to jump!

835
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,000
Come on, they're trapped!

836
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,800
Come back here, kiddies!
Come back here you little brats!

837
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,900
This better get us swimming badges!

838
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,300
Come on, Fishman. 
You got to jump!

839
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Superstud! Superstud!
I'm Superstud!

840
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,100
What is with these kids?
Quick, the chopper!

841
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,500
- I can't swim!
- I got you!

842
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,300
- Those kids are nuts!
- Forget about the kids! Let's find Grabelski!

843
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,500
Damn!

844
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:05,000
- Max!
- Gordy!

845
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Come here!

846
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:10,500
Max!

847
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,100
I got you!
I got you!

848
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,600
Grab on to me, Fishman!

849
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
You know, Kelsey? 
I think you're a hell of a scout!

850
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,300
- Where's Dana?
- I don't know!

851
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,200
Oh, my God, we've lost Dana! 
Where is he?

852
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,500
I see him, I see him!
We passed him!

853
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,300
All right, all right, all right. 
I'm turning around.

854
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,100
Kids, I got you.

855
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,700
Waterfall !!!

856
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,100
Waterfall! Hold on! Get to the side!
Swim to the side

857
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,000
Max. Grab onto something!

858
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,000
Dana?

859
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,300
Hi, Max!

860
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,500
Where have you been?
We've been worried sick about you!

861
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,700
Shut up and hold on!

862
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Pull! Pull!

863
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:43,400
Don't let go! 

864
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Hang on! Pull! 

865
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:52,500
Hold on, Dana, come on kids!

866
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Get out!

867
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
- Yeah!
- Come on, get out.

868
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,800
Way to go, shorty!

869
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,300
I might be short, 
but I'm real strong!

870
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,600
What is that?

871
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:44,000
- Throw your packs in the river!
- What are you doing?
- They'll think we're dead!

872
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,000
Throw them in! Throw them!

873
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,800
Do it! Throw them in!

874
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,000
You can't! 
My climbing stuff is in there!

875
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Give it! Ugh!!

876
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,900
Go! Go!!

877
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,200
Get in the bushes! Hide!

878
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,400
Let's go! Let's hide! Come on!

879
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,000
It shouldn't be this hard to kill 
six little scouts and one moron?

880
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:19,200
Relax, what we couldn't do 
Mother Nature did for us.

881
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:48,000
Hey, it worked! Yeah!

882
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,300
Now what?

883
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,700
I'm sick. 
I'm definitely getting sick.

884
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,200
Guys! Come on! 
I found a cave!

885
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,700
Yeah! You guys, let's go!

886
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,200
Yeah!

887
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,300
I'm coming!

888
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:13,800
Mrs. Patterson, hi, you know I have to apologize to you.
I've been dumping my anxiety on you.

889
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,600
And I feel terrible. I have a terrible temper I know, but 
Dana is my first. And I get very emotional, you know, and ..

890
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:25,700
I remember when he came out at the hospital 
he was so small, he was like a little duckling.

891
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,500
- Mr. Jarecki...
- Huh?

892
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,000
I think you need to call your wife.
She's probably very worried.

893
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,200
Oh, yeah. Whew.

894
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,000
My wife, call my wife. 
You got 20 cents I could borrow, please?

895
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,200
- I don't have...
- Take what you need.

896
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Thank you. Thank you.
You're good.

897
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,000
Devil's Peak?

898
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,200
You know, if we go after Bragdon before daybreak, 
we'd be able to catch him by surprise.

899
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,200
Yeah, that would work!

900
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,700
Go right down and rip his head off!

901
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,600
- Yea, we could beat him up...
- We could dissect him!

902
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, 
whoa, whoa, whoa.

903
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,200
That's too dangerous!

904
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,000
But we have to make sure 
the whole world knows you're innocent.

905
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,500
I mean, you're our scout leader!

906
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,400
You are still going to be 
our scout leader, right?

907
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,400
Yeah,

908
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,500
of course I am.

909
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,600
If you get the electric chair, you should put 
a light bulb in your mouth, like Uncle Fester.

910
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,000
That's a good idea.

911
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,500
Hey Max!

912
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,400
You're up early.

913
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:06,800
Is something wrong?

914
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:12,700
No, nothing's wrong. Everything's right. 
Should be up on Devils Peak in about three hours.

915
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,000
Intercept the package, turn it in, and 
be done with this whole thing.

916
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,000
Yeah, I'll go wake the guys.

917
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,700
Sure you want to do this?

918
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,000
What are you kidding? 
We didn't come this far to quit now!

919
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,300
Go scout ahead.

920
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Two hours.

921
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,500
Oh boy! 
We're never going to make it.

922
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,700
Devil's Peak, Devil's Peak.

923
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,100
Ok, Devil's Peak. I knew it. 
Reinhardt Bragdon! Here we go.

924
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Mr. McMurrey, 
I found something!

925
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,300
Well, if it isn't Scout Mother Patterson!

926
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,300
Sorry, but this is a private briefing.

927
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,300
Max Grabelski is heading to Devil's Peak.

928
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,900
Devil's Peak. Why would 
he want to go to Devil's Peak?

929
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,800
There's a cabin up there 
and it belongs to Reinhardt Bragdon!

930
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,000
How do you know that?

931
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,800
I'm a real estate broker. That house has 
been on the listings for six months.

932
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:46,000
A real estate broker! Ok. Ok.
Well, thank you very much for the tip. I'm sorry ...but

933
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,500
Look, I just told you 
where those kids are.

934
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,800
Now, you get your skinny butt 
up there and you rescue them!

935
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,000
Or do I have to do it alone?

936
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Oh, God.

937
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,900
Come on guys, just 
like what we practiced!

938
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,500
I'm telling you, just let me break 
out my Kilimanjaro gear!

939
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,700
- Barnhill, you're so full of it!
- You're such a B.S.er!

940
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:17,000
- Did you just rip one?
- I did not!

941
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,800
Yes, you did. You stink!

942
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,200
Will you guys knock it off?

943
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,200
I can't climb behind this guy anymore!

944
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,200
- Why are you blaming me?
- Don't make me climb down there!

945
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,100
Damn it!

946
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,700
May I be of some assistance?

947
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,100
Oh, no...

948
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,200
How are we going to get over there?

949
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,400
There's no more ledge, we can't get across.

950
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,500
You're going to need to use these.

951
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:30,700
Here we go!

952
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,100
Hold this.

953
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,900
That's your climbing rope,

954
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,300
this is your hammer,

955
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,800
and these,

956
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,300
are the pitons.

957
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,200
Hammer a piton into 
the crack in the rock.

958
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,700
Barnhill, would you knock it off! 
You have no idea what you're talking about!

959
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,000
Then all you got to do is just pass the rope through 
and then belay yourself off.

960
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,200
"Belay myself off "?

961
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,700
Belay myself off ?!

962
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,100
Hey Maxie, hit that thing till it rings!

963
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,500
He's going to get killed...

964
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,000
Barnhill, I know this is 
a bad time to be asking, ..

965
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:19,700
but you really did 
climb Kilimanjaro, right?

966
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,000
I'm telling you. I did!

967
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,600
That's good, that's good.

968
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:29,100
Ok, because, if you didn't, tell me now  

969
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
and I promise, 
I won't get mad or anything.

970
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I swear!

971
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,400
See? Nothing to it!

972
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,400
Piece of cake!

973
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,400
- What is the matter with you?

974
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,200
- I demand that you do something!
- You demand?

975
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:40,400
When there is something to do, 
we will do something!

976
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:46,100
But, Mrs. Patterson told you, they're in 
some cabin somewhere out there?

977
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,400
Right, Aggie? Aggie...?

978
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,600
Keep going guys. 
You're going to make it!

979
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,300
Whatever you do, just don't look down!

980
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,100
Too late!

981
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,600
We're going to make it!

982
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,900
Max, give me your hand!

983
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,400
I don't believe it!

984
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,800
Well, Max, we tried, anyway!

985
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,000
Not everything!

986
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:47,100
According to your body mass, you should 
be able to hold out for another ... 3 1/2 minutes.

987
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,800
Oh, good. 
Then take your time!

988
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Ay! My fingers!

989
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,500
Guys...

990
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,100
Guys?

991
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,700
Oh, very funny!

992
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,800
Where's the truck, already?

993
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,800
Relax, the truck will be here at 10:00.
It's guaranteed!

994
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:24,100
Look, killing Grabelski is one thing, 
I wasn't counting on killing those kids!

995
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,800
We got a big bundle here. 
Why don't we just take this and move out?

996
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,400
That truck is delivering 
the last $10 million dollars.

997
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,600
We're not going anywhere.

998
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,700
I can't believe we just did it, guys.

999
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,900
We made it!

1000
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:43,900
We made it! Yes!

1001
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,900
Devil's Peak.
We made it.

1002
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,500
Hey, there's the truck. 
Hide! Hide!

1003
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,700
Right on time!

1004
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,100
10AM, guaranteed!

1005
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,300
Sign this.

1006
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,400
What do you see, Fishman.

1007
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,300
I see the FBI guy,

1008
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,300
I see the other guy 
loading money into suitcases

1009
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,000
and I see Gordy's mom, tied to a chair.

1010
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,300
What?

1011
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,000
Max, what are we going to do?

1012
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,500
I'm thinking...
Sir?

1013
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,000
I'm thinking!

1014
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,400
This will work.

1015
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,700
- We're going with you!
- Yeah! We're going too!

1016
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,300
No! I said no!

1017
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,000
It's my mom!

1018
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,200
Listen! I got us into this mess...
and I'm going to get us ...

1019
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,000
I'm going to get us out of this mess!

1020
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Oh, boy!

1021
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,500
Listen!

1022
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,300
What?

1023
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,400
Is something wrong?

1024
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,400
No...

1025
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,900
Well, then, start loading 
the money in the chopper.

1026
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:22,400
Guys, please! Just sit tight and 
stay here where it's safe!

1027
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:24,900
Aah! Oh, my God!

1028
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,500
This is too touching for words.

1029
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,800
Don't worry, Grabelski.
You're going to be the first one to get it.

1030
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,900
No! Don't! 
Listen.

1031
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,200
I just want 
to tell you one thing!

1032
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:38,700
What?

1033
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,300
Uh...

1034
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
...you are a disgrace to the FBI!

1035
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,000
Oh, that hurts!

1036
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,800
Now, I just want to tell you one thing:

1037
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,100
What?

1038
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,600
You're a dead man!

1039
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,300
Hey, cupcake!

1040
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,400
Oh, no!

1041
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,200
Sergeant Doofus!

1042
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,300
You and I got to have a little talk, mister.

1043
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,700
I can't talk now. 
I got to go help Gordy's mom!

1044
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,500
Stay here and watch him!

1045
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,200
Hold him down!

1046
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,400
What do we do with him, sir?

1047
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,600
I got an idea.

1048
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,400
Palmer?

1049
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Palmer!

1050
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,800
Oh, marvelous!

1051
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,100
Mrs. Patterson!
Hey listen,

1052
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I'm not really a scout leader.
My name is Max, and I'm here to save you.

1053
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,000
Now, be very quiet.

1054
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:07,500
- You lying, irresponsible..!!
- Ok, we'll get to know each other later.

1055
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,400
All right, now, what kind of knots 
did these kids say these were?

1056
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,600
[ muffled ]
(Oh, my God, he's an idiot!)

1057
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,000
A little lesson in common decency.

1058
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,000
- Oh! Oh!
- Ok, what do we do now?

1059
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,000
What did you do 
with the handcuffs?

1060
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:29,100
So, it's not a figure eight, it's not 
a butterfly and it's not a fisherman's.

1061
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,100
- It's a clove hitch.
- Ah, thank you.

1062
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:33,700
Ahh!

1063
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,200
I learned it in the scouts.

1064
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,900
Let me show you the 
wonderful view off the porch.

1065
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,200
Please, you don't want 
to do this, Mr. Bragdon.

1066
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,300
Oh, but of course I do, Maxwell!

1067
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,500
I'm sorry.

1068
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,400
It was a pleasure doing 
business with you, Maxwell.

1069
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:01,000
Noooo !!!

1070
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:25,000
- No! Gordy!
- Noo !!!

1071
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,200
That was one of my kids, 
you crazy sicko!

1072
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
- Mom!
- Gordy?

1073
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,100
Help!

1074
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,100
Gordy! Where are you?

1075
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:43,800
Down here!

1076
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,700
- Help!
- Hold on, honey!

1077
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,700
- Gordy?
- Max!

1078
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,600
Oh boy!

1079
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,700
- Max!
- Hey kid!

1080
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,300
How's it "hanging"!

1081
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,200
Wait up. Hurry!

1082
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:12,800
Where's Gordy?

1083
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,600
Don't worry, Gordy. 
I'm coming down!

1084
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:18,000
No! You don't know 
what you're doing!

1085
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,300
Of course I do!

1086
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,700
I'm the Lizard, remember?

1087
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,600
You mean the Spider?

1088
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:27,200
Right.

1089
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,700
- Gordy!
- Where is he?

1090
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,600
Down there. Max?

1091
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,700
I'm just a delivery guy!

1092
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Ok, reach!

1093
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:48,900
Come on, reach!

1094
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,200
- I can't!
- Reach and I'll grab you!

1095
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,100
Cracking...

1096
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:01,100
- I'm scared!
- Believe me, I'm scared too.

1097
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,600
Now, you're going 
to have to let go!

1098
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:07,100
Come on, now. 
Come on. Let go. 

1099
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,600
I got you!

1100
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,100
I got you, kid! 
I got you!

1101
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,600
You've got to stop 
goofing around like this.

1102
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,500
Don't let go!

1103
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,100
- Here they come!
- Gordy!

1104
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,700
There, I got you!

1105
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,500
We made it!

1106
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,100
Thank you, thank you Max.

1107
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:32,200
Hey, it was nothing!

1108
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,400
Just a little mountain!

1109
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:47,500
For achievement in mountain climbing, survival, rescue skills 
and citizenship above and beyond the call of duty,

1110
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:53,700
you kids went right pass Tenderfoot badges 
and on to something much greater.

1111
01:23:54,200 --> 01:24:01,200
Therefore, I am very proud to present to each 
one of you, the Ranger's highest badge ..

1112
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:05,400
First Class Eagle!
You earned it!

1113
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,200
Good job, guys!

1114
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,200
Now...

1115
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,800
As for you, Mr. Grabelski.

1116
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:32,000
When you took these kids on an overnight, 
you broke every rule in the book!

1117
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,700
But, when they got into trouble,

1118
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:46,700
you demonstrated the kind of courage, values and honor, which 
are the cornerstones of the Ranger Scouts.

1119
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:53,200
It gives me great pleasure to present Max Grabelski...

1120
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,800
...with the badge of Ranger Scout Leader!

1121
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,300
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

1122
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,100
Thank you!

1123
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Hey! Guys! Look at this, 
I'm a real live scout leader!

1124
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,600
Thank you, thank you!

1125
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Now, for your next assignment...

1126
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:25,300
Next assignment?

1127
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:29,500
You and the kids are going to hit Yosemite 
and you're going to hit it hard!

1128
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,500
Hear that, guys? I get to 
take you on another overnight!

1129
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,500
No, Mr. Grabelski, not just your kids...

1130
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:39,100
Huh?

1131
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,800
All the kids!

1132
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:57,500
No! Just!

1133
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:02,000
AHH !!!

1134
01:26:03,305 --> 01:27:03,268
