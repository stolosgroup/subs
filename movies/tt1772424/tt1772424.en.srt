00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,953
The story I tell here

3
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:39,122
is for all who want to hear.

4
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,458
A tale of those who fast,
a tale of those who pray.

5
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,379
A tale of a lonely town,
mines scattered all around.

6
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,881
Caught up in a war,

7
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,134
split to its very core.

8
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,678
Two clans with broken hearts

9
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,847
under a burning sun.

10
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:58,224
Their hands stained with blood

11
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,935
in the name of a cross or a crescent.

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,480
From this lonely place,
which has chosen peace,

13
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,484
whose history is spun
of barbed wire and guns.

14
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:13,072
It's a long tale of women dressed in black.

15
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,743
No glittering stars, no dazzling flowers.

16
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,495
Their ash-blackened eyes.

17
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,666
Women driven by destiny

18
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,252
to demonstrate their bravery.

19
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:09,248
Where Do We Go Now?

20
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,543
Aren't we high enough, Roukoz?

21
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,088
Come on! We're pooped!

22
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,547
Nassim!

23
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,591
Roukoz!

24
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,218
That'll never work.

25
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,220
He said 200 yards!

26
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,056
This is ridiculous. Say something!

27
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,809
Don't worry, Mayor, don't worry.

28
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,061
Be careful, there are mines.

29
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,647
Roukoz.

30
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,066
There's a signal down at Amale's.

31
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,902
Do you want to watch TV or what?

32
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,779
The signal's weak at Amale's.

33
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,239
Are you qualified?

34
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,742
That's the question.
It's a government project, my friend.

35
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,833
Screw this, Roukoz! Screw this!

36
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,252
I told you!

37
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,504
Calm down, son. Take it easy!

38
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,256
Should've stayed home.

39
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,967
Damn this shitty village!

40
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,284
That's it.

41
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,121
Poor Brigitte!

42
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,791
Nassim, come help your brother.

43
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,501
How are you, lssam?

44
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,835
Fine, Mom.

45
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,170
Is that Brigitte?

46
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,588
Yes, it's her.

47
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,925
- The one that never knew love.
- She stepped on that mine?

48
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,719
She's the sixth. The sixth!

49
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,012
It's not fair.

50
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,597
You said it.

51
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,183
A terrible loss. Be strong!

52
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,392
It's Brigitte.

53
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,561
Just look at this fleece.

54
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,231
Have you ever seen the like?

55
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,899
Come and have a coffee.

56
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,526
Maybe on the way back.

57
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,402
To give her a send-off!

58
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,864
We'll drink
to your children's marriage, I hope.

59
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,329
Be gentle with her.

60
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,210
Seeing her like that...

61
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,880
- Holy Mary!
- Calm down, Madame Yvonne.

62
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,091
Doesn't Afaf's TV work?

63
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,467
No.

64
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,512
- And nobody has another set?
- No.

65
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,139
There's no sound.

66
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,975
Don't worry, we'll sort that out.

67
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,811
This whole thing is ridiculous!

68
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,146
Good heavens!

69
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,398
Holy Mary!

70
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,903
Oum Khalil isn't well.

71
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,489
Where will everyone sit if she dies?

72
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,324
They're all we have.

73
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,659
Listen, my son.

74
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,120
I'll trust you with them.

75
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,622
They're brand new. You're responsible.

76
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,827
Behave yourselves.

77
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,121
Hammoudi, stop it.

78
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,497
Madame Amale.

79
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,719
They're lovely and cool.

80
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,475
Aren't you sick of that old cap?

81
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,312
I used to hate it on your father as well.

82
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,584
Amale.

83
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,336
Come and sit here.

84
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,504
Leave her be.

85
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,339
I'm fine here.

86
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,133
You'd love it if she came over.

87
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,391
Bon appétit!

88
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,727
That's all I can say.

89
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,021
Here come the heroes!

90
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,236
Don't ever get rid of that hat!

91
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,658
Give it back to him.

92
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,007
Welcome, everyone,

93
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,969
on this historic day

94
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,763
for our village.

95
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:44,768
Thank you to our priest and imam
for coming along,

96
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,981
symbolizing our unity and coexistence.

97
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,234
We'd like to apologize

98
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,321
for the long and difficult walk.

99
00:10:55,739 --> 00:11:01,493
But, as you know, this was
the only place with decent reception.

100
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,663
My dear villagers,

101
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,167
I'm pleased, or rather, I'm delighted

102
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,669
to be here with you

103
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,881
under this starry sky

104
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,967
on this glorious day,

105
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:21,138
when, as a united flock, we are about

106
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,933
to move through the great door
leading from the 20th century

107
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,519
to the 21st.

108
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,523
And talking about flocks,

109
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,567
thanks go to Abou Ali.

110
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,198
And we say to him,

111
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,909
Brigitte didn't die in vain.

112
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,037
She sacrificed herself for us.

113
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,081
Sacrificed her body.

114
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,585
Any one of us here
could have met the same fate.

115
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,462
Been spit-roasted?

116
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,716
Remember, only the goat on the right

117
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,094
is halal.

118
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,096
God bless you, Abou Ali.

119
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,475
And in the same way,
we've overcome the conflict

120
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,228
that's divided us,

121
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,647
spilling blood among brothers,

122
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,359
we will soon, I hope,
be able to repair our bridge,

123
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,780
so we may come and go like everyone else.

124
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,118
We'd especially like to thank

125
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,246
Madame Yvonne, my wife,

126
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:36,004
who so generously provided this television.

127
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:48,976
Good evening.

128
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,521
We're seeing extreme heat
and very high temperatures

129
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,897
right across the region.

130
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,358
It hasn't been this hot for years.

131
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,736
The mercury has tipped 105 degrees.

132
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,866
So be careful and stay out of the sun.

133
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,286
Protect yourself
and watch out for heatstroke.

134
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,122
Nassim,

135
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,708
I said flesh-colored.

136
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,712
Madame Yvonne,
I asked for support hose. That's it.

137
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,548
That pantyhose isn't yours.

138
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,384
It's Amale's. It's not your size.

139
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,594
Let me see.

140
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,388
It's pretty nice.

141
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,307
I'll keep it.

142
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,101
Rita, is my order ready?

143
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,978
It's chaos at my place.

144
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,606
- They're starving.
- Yes, it's ready.

145
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:40,319
Why are you barging in like that?
Get in line like the rest of us.

146
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,653
Yes, get in line.

147
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,281
- It's okay.
- It's not! Wait your turn!

148
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:50,746
Calm down.

149
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,164
Keep your trap shut!

150
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,918
Here's your hose and your meds.

151
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,296
Take one each to calm you both down.

152
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,173
What about my lamps?

153
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,675
I sold them for 25,000.

154
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,843
Only 25,000?

155
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,763
They were antiques! The older, the better!

156
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,390
The buyer had a squint.

157
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,100
They were antiques!

158
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,186
I inherited them from Phoenicians!

159
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:18,023
Nassim, I asked for number 24, not 17!

160
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,067
You ladies are too much!

161
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:24,196
You're lucky to have someone
who risks running your errands!

162
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:29,201
Who will see your hair
under your veil anyway?

163
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,578
What's up with you today?

164
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,705
What about you? Shut up!

165
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,298
What's going on here?

166
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,425
Did you get the newspapers?

167
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,219
I asked for three.

168
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,473
I've only got a crappy little scooter.
Be grateful.

169
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,975
What about the decorating?

170
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:57,646
There's no hurry.
The longer it goes on, the better it is.

171
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,357
You get to see more of Madame Amale.

172
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,483
Shut up!

173
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,820
Leaving so soon?

174
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,447
- Stay a while!
- No, I'm busy.

175
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,074
How's the decorating?

176
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,786
Give it a rest!

177
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,796
Hi, Rabih.

178
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,131
Hello, Amale.

179
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,764
How are you, my beauty?

180
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,935
You are no more mine
than I am yours

181
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,523
I see you perched up there

182
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,152
If only I could come up
and bring you down

183
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,531
How are you, my prince?

184
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,619
You are no more mine
than I am yours

185
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,873
Hush, my heart, hush

186
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,960
Don't be in such a rush

187
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:07,466
Calm your emotion
Beating so hard that way

188
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,719
This love you will betray

189
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:15,223
Let's keep it hard to find

190
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,561
Out of sight, out of mind

191
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,290
Little bird, tell me, pray

192
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,586
What the crystal ball will say

193
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:49,091
Is it me he thinks of still?

194
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,427
And don't forget to send the bill

195
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:57,099
Little bird
Give me a tape to measure

196
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,269
How long it will last, this treasure?

197
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:06,400
Will our love bloom and grow?

198
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,778
Tell me, let me know

199
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,861
Pinball at this hour!
What did I do to deserve this?

200
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,195
What's up?

201
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,030
Hi, Amale. How's my brother?

202
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,241
Sorry, but they drive me nuts!

203
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,703
The trash bag has been sitting there
for three days!

204
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,330
- I didn't see.
- You didn't see?

205
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,207
Why the hell not?

206
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,294
Come on. Bring my slipper. Go on, Assaad.

207
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:12,007
You can laugh. You'll shut up
when I send your mom down here.

208
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,691
Don't sell the jam
for less than 10,000 pounds.

209
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,360
I killed myself making it.

210
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,698
Take this.
Buy yourself two shirts and some pants

211
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,702
for Sara's first communion.
And get rid of that tatty jacket.

212
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,706
May God bless you and keep you safe.

213
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,205
Rabih, when will all this work be finished?

214
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,583
When Amale smiles at him.

215
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,252
Hush! What's she supposed to do?

216
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,796
Put on a veil and be done with it!

217
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,591
You want our lot to kill her?

218
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,635
Why doesn't he get baptized?

219
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,265
- We'd gain a Christian.
- That's true!

220
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,268
You think you're better than us?

221
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,937
It's different for us. We're baptized.

222
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,689
- Sorry!
- It's true.

223
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,774
Look at Sassine.

224
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,736
He doesn't know if he's
Christian or Muslim.

225
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,820
He's not bothered.

226
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,531
Exactly. He hasn't a care in the world.

227
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,533
A minor altercation in Wardeh

228
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:47,662
degenerated into a sectarian clash
between Christians and Muslims,

229
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:52,417
during which
handguns were drawn by both sides.

230
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,794
Four people were wounded

231
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,173
and there was significant
material damage...

232
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,899
- Be careful.
- Higher. Grab it!

233
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,590
What's this?

234
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:46,721
Change the channel.
There are children watching.

235
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,557
- But it's a great film.
- Absolutely not.

236
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,184
Leave it.

237
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,603
Change the channel.
There are children watching.

238
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,356
Sassine, change it.

239
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,068
There are children here.
They shouldn't see this.

240
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,910
Leave the news on.

241
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,328
We don't want it.

242
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:11,955
Go back.

243
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,332
We're not here for the news.

244
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,627
Yes, we are. Turn it up.

245
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:25,552
An emergency cabinet meeting
was held to discuss

246
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:29,014
the situation in the country,
both in political terms

247
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,726
and regarding ongoing security issues.

248
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:36,146
Elsewhere, concerning recent events

249
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,940
in the Wardeh region,
an anonymous source confirmed...

250
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,776
Hammoudi, stop picking your nose!

251
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,236
I wasn't!

252
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,155
And what's with that red sweater?

253
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,115
...Between Christians and Muslims...

254
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,827
Your chickens keep going in my garden!

255
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,704
We can't hear the TV!

256
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,789
Shut your big mouth!

257
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,167
What about you and your big mouth?

258
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,086
Calm down!

259
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,714
Religious leaders condemned...

260
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,300
You've got a cheek giving me lessons!

261
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,553
Mrs. Uptight!

262
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,138
You're the smelly one!

263
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,310
Mrs. Tight Ass!

264
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,732
You're the chicken!

265
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,359
Fatmeh! What's she done to you?

266
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,326
Shots can still be heard...

267
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,831
Amale, what's this dumb idea?

268
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,666
The wolves will get us!

269
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,960
Shut up and keep moving!

270
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,505
Are you sure you know the way?

271
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,840
Hurry up, the wolves are coming.

272
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,425
I know the way.

273
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,551
Be quick!

274
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:51,262
Scared of the Big Bad Wolf?

275
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,515
Worried about your big fat ass?

276
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,350
I'm freezing mine off here.

277
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:56,851
I like my ass.

278
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,771
Which one is it?

279
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,273
I'm no expert in TV sabotage!

280
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,609
Let's just smash the screen.

281
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,277
Yvonne would throw a fit.

282
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,407
Heavens above, I'm going to pee my panties.

283
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,119
- Do we play dead?
- Stop it!

284
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,121
We're trying to concentrate!

285
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,666
The wolves will eat us for dessert
if you don't hurry!

286
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,459
Give me that!

287
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,565
Is the scooter okay?

288
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,401
- We had a flat.
- Yeah, right!

289
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,820
And I just sit here worrying?

290
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,738
You come home at dawn?
And you, his cousin!

291
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,032
I trusted you.

292
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,826
Shut up! Get inside.

293
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,720
A flat?

294
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,931
These don't look flat to me!

295
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,518
I don't know what those ruffians get up to.

296
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,355
"Small altercation in Wardeh
sparks sectarian riot."

297
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,941
So it's true what the TV said.

298
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,277
Has anyone taken a paper yet?

299
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:30,778
No.

300
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,614
It's a disaster.

301
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,118
Here's what we do.

302
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,834
They can read my ass now!

303
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,381
Hey, Saydeh, is your ass a broadsheet?

304
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,301
It's a dictionary.
Want to look something up?

305
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,514
I swear to you, on my mother's...

306
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,851
I'm the one who left the window open.
It doesn't even close.

307
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,855
The wind blew the cross over and it broke.

308
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,440
Why all the fuss?

309
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,027
You'd need a tornado
to blow over that cross, Father.

310
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,029
I've said it 100 times.

311
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:59,492
The church is falling apart.
lts foundations are crumbling,

312
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,078
and has anyone lifted a finger?

313
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,038
You, Youssef.

314
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,874
How many times have I asked you?

315
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,961
First, it's a hernia,
then it's your bladder.

316
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,922
Now the cross is broken,

317
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,800
and you're all worked up,
playing the tough guys.

318
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,970
You say the others broke it,

319
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,889
that they're causing
trouble in the village.

320
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:27,729
Don't let events that take place
elsewhere influence you.

321
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,023
It's all just rumor.

322
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,109
All is fine with the world.

323
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,777
Everything's okay.

324
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,341
What's going on?

325
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,615
May Almighty God forgive us!

326
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,077
Those sons of bitches!

327
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,122
The only sacred place we had left!

328
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,124
You looking for trouble?

329
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:31,918
You insult us?

330
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,087
- You mean us?
- Son of a bitch!

331
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,755
- Abou Ahmad!
- The house of God!

332
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,965
- You talking to me?
- The house of God!

333
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,181
Don't do that, Abou Ahmad!

334
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,477
The house of God, you bastards!

335
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:05,368
May God forgive us!

336
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,092
Come on, go home.

337
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,129
You must ignore what goes on elsewhere.

338
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,340
Elsewhere is elsewhere.

339
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:47,512
For years, we've lived peacefully
with our Christian brothers.

340
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,097
And the animals in the mosque?

341
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,225
Who said they did it?

342
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,559
Who was it then?

343
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,478
I don't know any more than you.

344
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,105
The mosque stays open. A goat came in.

345
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,566
She wanted to admire the carpets.

346
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,139
Mother of God!

347
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,976
Sweet Jesus!

348
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,270
What happened to you?

349
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,647
The font is full of blood!

350
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,440
It's full of blood!

351
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:46,445
You little punk! Come here!

352
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,327
Get out of here or I'll break your legs!

353
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,621
A curse on your father!

354
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,291
- They're kids!
- I'll break your legs!

355
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,585
Boutros, calm down!

356
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,173
Stop! He's a child!

357
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,139
I'll kill you!

358
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:14,890
You savages!

359
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,225
Look!

360
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,978
Leave him alone!

361
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:30,865
And you call yourself men?

362
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,701
You call yourself a man?

363
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,078
You'd pick on a child?

364
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,497
Shame on you!

365
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,711
Come here, darling.

366
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,882
I told you not to play
in front of the church.

367
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,052
Fatmeh, answer me.

368
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,387
I beg of you.

369
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,682
Don't tell Abou Ahmad.

370
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,518
Don't worry. I'm not crazy.

371
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,646
Go sort out your son.

372
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,439
Leave me alone.

373
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,446
Not a word to your father.

374
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:12,865
You're a good boy.

375
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:20,956
Well?

376
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,875
It's definitely blood.

377
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,003
Is it a sign?

378
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,173
God is speaking to us.

379
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,426
Yes. He's trying to tell us you're dumb.

380
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,303
It's chicken blood, stupid.

381
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,139
It's a chicken feather.

382
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,946
All that work for nothing.

383
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,115
Nobody touched it.

384
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:56,951
All the more for us.

385
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,787
Eat. It'll do you good.

386
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,455
Chew!

387
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,625
You need to eat.

388
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,629
It'll take a miracle to calm them down.

389
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,706
Yvonne. Can you hear us?

390
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,585
Talk to us.

391
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,965
Blessed be thy name.

392
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,593
She's talking to the Virgin!

393
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,136
Have mercy, Mary!

394
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,474
What's going on?

395
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,686
Peace be with her.

396
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,859
- Has she lost it?
- She's talking to the Virgin.

397
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,360
Wake up.

398
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,654
What did the Virgin say to you?

399
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,239
She's angry.

400
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,866
She's weeping blood.

401
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:27,708
She says the cross of blood
that marked our foreheads...

402
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,837
She said the cross of blood

403
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,840
that marked our foreheads...

404
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,384
Was a sign of God's anger.

405
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,805
Anger! The wrath of God is upon you!

406
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,140
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

407
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,810
Hitting kids? Have you no shame?

408
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,061
Apologize.

409
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,649
- The Virgin is angry.
- It's not our fault!

410
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,984
Speak to the Virgin!

411
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,654
She's calling you. What does she say now?

412
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,406
She sees men killing each other.

413
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,242
The village in strife.

414
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,578
Men crouching in attics,
fetching their guns.

415
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,210
And on their bellies searching under beds.

416
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,589
What else?

417
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,049
Youssef!

418
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,344
She sees the saint, God bless him.

419
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,138
Youssef Daoud!

420
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,601
What about him?

421
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,687
An asshole.

422
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,774
The Virgin said that?

423
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,277
Shut up or we'll be in the shit.

424
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,028
You'll ruin everything.

425
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,282
He called his neighbor,
Abu Hassan, an asshole,

426
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:45,077
and threw blackberries
at Oum Hassan's washing.

427
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,121
Not for the first time.

428
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,290
Stop it, Yvonne.

429
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,625
And Abou Ahmad!

430
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,628
What about him?

431
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,256
He threw his trash in Georges' garden.

432
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,550
It's true, I saw you!

433
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:00,759
Let's go.

434
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,970
Stop her before I slap her!

435
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,471
Drop it!

436
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,515
She's totally nuts.

437
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,229
Go ahead, faint.

438
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,065
That's it. Faint. Close your eyes.

439
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,235
Quick! Water and sugar!

440
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,321
Yvonne's passed out!

441
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:22,990
I'll fetch her some sugar.

442
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,243
What a sham. She's making fools of us.

443
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,370
Make way. You okay, Yvonne?

444
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,164
Your wife's a saint, Mayor.

445
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,291
My wife, a saint?

446
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:33,959
My wife's a miracle!

447
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,503
Yvonne, speak to me.

448
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,798
Sorry to interrupt, Holy Mother.

449
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,342
Come on, get up.

450
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,636
You'll see the Virgin tomorrow.

451
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,513
That's enough miracles today. Get up.

452
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,123
Stop gluing her.
She'll end up looking like Quasimodo.

453
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,917
Give her to me.

454
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,877
Show me.

455
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,051
She's beautiful, no matter what.

456
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:32,267
If only you could help
us, tell us what to do.

457
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,232
That's all we need!

458
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,090
Cat got your tongue?

459
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,260
Don't be cheap. They have to be beautiful.

460
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,262
Impossible! No way!

461
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:13,267
What's wrong, Madame impossible?
Worried about your old man?

462
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:17,730
It should cost you double
for someone to look twice at him.

463
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,481
Come on, cough up.

464
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,066
Enough talking!

465
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,777
And you, Lady Mayoress, show us the cash.

466
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:27,031
Shame on you and this wicked plan!

467
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,868
I'd never agree to this in a million years!

468
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,371
The mayor's not touched you
since the Stone Age,

469
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:37,416
and only uses it now as a garden hose!

470
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,127
Come on, cough up!

471
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,297
What foul language! Shame on you!

472
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,799
I don't agree with this. Here!

473
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:49,470
Come on, toss it all in.
It might wake him up.

474
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:52,431
Give Abou Ahmad a taste of something else.

475
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,725
Worried? Stick a padlock on it!

476
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,437
I could kill you!

477
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,355
Amale, pay up.

478
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,317
Worried about Rabih? I know my brother.

479
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,652
It's only for a couple of days.

480
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,051
That's Svetlana.

481
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:15,264
That one, Tatiana.

482
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,641
And that one's Anna.

483
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,770
And who is the other one? Katia?

484
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,230
Let's have a look.

485
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:30,946
Yes, that's Katia.

486
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:35,075
You see that?
We said sexy outfits, not naked!

487
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,287
Who the hell's that?

488
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,498
Who's she? Did we pick her?

489
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,584
Have a look, Saydeh.

490
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,423
She's a bonus. He gave us a free one.

491
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,259
What's the point?

492
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,469
You're hotter than she is!

493
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,346
Shut up.

494
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,224
- What if she's a Satanist?
- That's okay.

495
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:01,435
It'll take the devil to calm them down!

496
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,862
The idiot! I said breakdown, not blow up!

497
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,651
I get it now, with those legs.

498
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,737
Whereas ours are only good for housework.

499
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,074
You could fit three of them
in a pair of my pants.

500
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:02,120
But when you were young, dear,
your hips moved mountains!

501
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,164
I weighed 16 pounds at birth.

502
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,458
Impressive.

503
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,506
Some milk of magnesia?

504
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:16,176
Drink it yourself and
fetch them some juice!

505
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:22,015
The bus broke down outside the village.

506
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,726
We're doing a tour around here.

507
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,561
Putting on shows all over.

508
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,563
You know the Bolshoi?

509
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,857
- Of course!
- You bet we do!

510
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,569
I swear, these girls
are more famous than the Bolshoi!

511
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,030
Allow me, Mayor.

512
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:40,993
Stand back.
Peel yourself off the window, kiddo.

513
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:44,079
See that cute little lady over there?

514
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,039
A real monkey!

515
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:51,586
She stands there almost motionless,
then, in one go, she jumps

516
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,297
and she flies!

517
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,799
She spins, she twirls,

518
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:59,594
and when she's bored,
she lands, straight as an arrow.

519
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,597
I swear, Reverend.

520
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,392
See that one over there?

521
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:10,314
When she does the splits,
you wouldn't believe it!

522
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,150
She does it up against the wall.

523
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,485
You know what happens to the wall?

524
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,738
It cracks!

525
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:22,993
I've seen some things in my time,
but never anything like this!

526
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,162
Have you known many women?

527
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,415
None like these.

528
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,001
Fate is a great provider.

529
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:34,129
They usually only perform for VIPs...

530
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:35,589
No offense intended.

531
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,592
All the celebrities dream of seeing them!

532
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,427
Let me through!

533
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,179
Step aside.

534
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:44,181
- Welcome.
- Hello.

535
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,390
Out of the way.

536
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:50,520
So that makes you lose your heads?

537
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:53,231
They look like they've been in a famine.

538
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,359
Look at that anorexic one.

539
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,070
And the other, flat as a board.

540
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:02,032
Our smallest pair of boobs
could feed half of Ukraine!

541
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:07,579
Listen up.

542
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:12,334
You'll have to just put up with it
for a bit and welcome these girls.

543
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,631
The poor things have nowhere to go.

544
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,801
We have to take them in.
God will reward us.

545
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:24,805
Once the bus is fixed, that'll be that.
Right, Saydeh?

546
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,348
You're very kind.

547
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:27,974
You are welcome.

548
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,810
Hammoudi, darling, come here.

549
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:34,147
I need you. And Assaad. Come here, Assaad.

550
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:39,361
I know you're a good boy,
and you, too, Assaad.

551
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:44,324
For my sake, just for two days,
can they sleep in your room?

552
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,701
No problem. They're welcome.

553
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,247
Great. Now help them with their suitcase.

554
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,791
Turn the hot water on so they can shower.

555
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,043
Where's the suitcase?

556
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:59,631
Enough with the moaning! Damned kids!

557
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:01,675
Why do we only get one?

558
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,845
One is fine. Where would I put two?

559
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:08,390
It's not fair. Hammoudi and Assaad got two.

560
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:11,184
There's no space, we've only one room.

561
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:12,727
Where'll she sleep?

562
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,689
On my head. In my heart.
She's the apple of my eye!

563
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:20,402
I can't look after her,
I've no time for that limping thing!

564
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,028
You're too busy?

565
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,531
Too many appointments with the Virgin?

566
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,575
Don't you mention Her!

567
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,119
Let Her cut out your tongue!

568
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:32,581
And let Her rid me of you,
blessed be Her name,

569
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,040
so I get some peace.

570
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,126
Don't utter Her name again!

571
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,462
Come here, sweetie.

572
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,754
Give me that.

573
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:43,467
He brings home a cripple
and dares talk about the Virgin!

574
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,636
Welcome. It's an honor.

575
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,895
You're there!

576
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,897
Hey neighbor! How's it going?

577
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:01,026
Pretty crappy! She's put me on the floor.

578
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,360
In the kitchen as well.

579
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,738
You can keep your dresses in the fridge!

580
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:07,240
We've got five-star service here.

581
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,911
Two butlers and cigarettes!

582
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,582
Young man!

583
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,084
- Get up!
- Oh, my God!

584
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,004
Are we at war?

585
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,172
Not yet.

586
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:25,383
Get dressed. Prayer is better than sleep.

587
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,525
You don't eat bread at all?

588
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,485
Not even a bit?

589
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,903
Look at those kids!

590
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,488
Look, look!

591
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,615
Bravo!

592
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,492
God bless you.

593
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,494
What a show! Such energy!

594
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,797
No salt at all? With a fork?

595
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:06,341
Nothing!

596
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,635
No biscuits or cakes?

597
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,470
They don't eat anything!

598
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,765
- Aren't they hungry?
- I don't know.

599
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,184
But bread fills you up.

600
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,145
You'd be famous in Ukraine.

601
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,981
Well done, darling.

602
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,609
You're not like this
when I ask for a glass of water!

603
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:27,696
Now, you're twitching like a fish!

604
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,324
You moan when we don't work,
now you moan when we do!

605
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,994
I'm worried about your back, silly.

606
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:40,292
Shut up and be happy.
They're occupied! They're spellbound!

607
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,179
In a line, boys. Hammoudi, get in line!

608
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,681
Yes, sir!

609
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:03,231
I'd like a hair thickener.

610
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,524
Okay.

611
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,402
I want some slimming cream.

612
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,582
Look, girls.

613
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,042
A cemetery!

614
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,377
Christians and Muslims.

615
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:28,048
There's more dead than alive here.
They're so young.

616
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,643
There's only photos of men.

617
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,103
This looks like Yvonne's son.

618
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,730
Really?

619
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:49,194
Did you see the photo at her place?

620
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,616
Now I see why she's crazy.

621
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:57,243
He's so cute!

622
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,454
What a lovely face!

623
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:04,709
What a waste.

624
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,004
Their poor mothers.

625
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,811
Even dead, they're divided.

626
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,140
What's up with you lot?

627
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,308
Going on a pilgrimage?

628
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,437
- Yeah, to your mom's!
- What?

629
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,771
What's wrong?

630
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,898
Our shoes were stolen at the mosque.

631
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,067
- What's that?
- To your mom's, okay?

632
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,653
- You talking to me?
- Yeah, I am.

633
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,947
- To me, asshole?
- Yeah!

634
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,824
Leave my mom out of it!

635
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,827
- Back off!
- You take it back!

636
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:22,829
Back off!

637
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,080
Take it back!

638
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:54,527
Stop it!

639
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,070
That's enough!

640
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,909
Stop it!

641
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,710
That's enough!

642
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,219
Have you learned nothing?

643
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,262
Nothing at all?

644
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,725
Hasn't your mom suffered enough?

645
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,647
She's still grieving for your brother.

646
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,066
Her tears aren't even dry!

647
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,735
Have a little dignity, for heaven's sake!

648
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,239
It's enough to make us lose our faith!

649
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:43,076
You think we're just here to mourn you?

650
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,913
To wear black forever?

651
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:49,582
Have a little pity!

652
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,585
You're just animals!

653
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,506
You'll make us sick of God
and this shitty village!

654
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,592
Is that what being a man means?

655
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:01,803
And you!

656
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,931
What's he done to you?

657
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,268
What's your problem?

658
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,770
Hit me. I'm one of them!

659
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,274
I'm one of them, I said. Hit me!

660
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,109
Go on, go for it!

661
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:19,279
Get out of here!

662
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:22,282
Go home. Go die in your own homes.

663
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,658
Get out of here!

664
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,370
You, too. I don't want your help!

665
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,082
We're on our own now.

666
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,379
Get out!

667
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:40,049
Get out of my sight, all of you!

668
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,718
Come here, you.

669
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,511
Ten hours out in the sun!

670
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,931
Haven't you ever seen the sun before?

671
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,683
Who'll look at you now?

672
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,644
Who's going to want you now?

673
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:34,145
You're roasted!

674
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,688
How stupid.

675
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,066
We went to all that effort.

676
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,238
What are they up to?

677
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,742
The poor things got sunburn.

678
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,078
They're going to die.

679
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,164
If only your binoculars had ears!

680
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:58,920
Easy, honey. Hold still.
They're going to die.

681
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,381
Do you think Rita is still awake?

682
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,517
You'll need a big rock to wake her!

683
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,060
I know her.

684
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,937
She's a heavy sleeper.

685
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:19,899
My God!

686
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:23,403
What's wrong with you?
You almost killed me!

687
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,279
Bring your tape recorder.

688
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:41,796
They've got 2,500 nukes. I think she knows!

689
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,548
I'd rather check.

690
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:48,970
Hi, Rabih.

691
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:50,722
Hello, Amale.

692
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:53,850
What's up? Something wrong?

693
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,479
- Are you alone?
- Of course, I am.

694
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,772
Don't worry.

695
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,775
This poor girl is allergic to Amale's cat.

696
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,444
She's all red.

697
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,529
Hello.

698
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,572
How can I help?

699
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,782
Where else could I go at 3:00 a.m.?

700
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,951
My house is overflowing already,

701
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:15,455
but you have a spare room.
She can stay with you.

702
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,041
You want me to look after her?

703
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:22,462
She's not disabled!
She's the one who'll look after you.

704
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,130
Go on, darling. Go in.

705
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,965
I'll fix up her room.

706
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,384
Hurry, before the dew settles.

707
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:29,969
She doesn't eat much.

708
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,306
Katyusha? Like the missiles?

709
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,475
What if she blows up?

710
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,603
God forbid! Why would she blow up?

711
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,146
How old is she?

712
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,445
She looks younger.

713
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,989
Is she married?

714
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,657
Ask her.

715
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,998
She says she's too young.

716
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,167
I had two kids weaned by then.

717
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,423
What did she say?

718
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:12,178
She hasn't found her Prince Charming yet.

719
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,264
And real men like you are rare.

720
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,726
- He's a real catch.
- She said that?

721
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,603
She's such a nice girl.

722
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,523
But say I hit Christian girls.

723
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:26,526
If she's trouble, I'll throw her stuff out.

724
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,027
Why do you say that?

725
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:30,113
Shame on you.

726
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:39,413
What did she say?

727
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,209
She says she's sorry.

728
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,003
She's very embarrassed.

729
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,257
She won't be any trouble.

730
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:54,095
She'll stay with you, for better or worse.

731
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,808
It's lovely how polite she is.

732
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:02,687
If that's so, ask what
she likes for breakfast.

733
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:05,982
Who cares! Let her starve!

734
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,317
Milk and boiled eggs will be fine.

735
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:10,236
No, ask her.

736
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,083
She says all she needs is love and water.

737
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,711
She offers to make your breakfast.

738
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:28,796
Such breeding!

739
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:32,258
If she makes it
with those pretty hands, I accept.

740
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:42,727
But you know what?
She seems a bit snobby and proud.

741
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,604
She thinks I'm beneath her.

742
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,814
She'd be better off with a Christian.

743
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:48,649
You're right.

744
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:51,319
And she thinks you're selfish.

745
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:55,281
That you need a haircut.
You're like a plucked chicken!

746
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,618
What? She said that?
Really? The cheek of it!

747
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,954
Don't listen, darling.
My brother is perfect.

748
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:05,458
You can only trust foreigners now.

749
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:06,667
Same for us!

750
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:07,960
Goodnight!

751
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,631
What's eating her?

752
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:23,100
If there had been words between us

753
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:25,228
We would have spoken

754
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:31,901
If there had been tears between us

755
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,570
We would have wept

756
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:40,576
If there had been a path to take us

757
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:43,287
Together, we'd have walked it

758
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:49,168
If there had been a route to take us

759
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,671
Together, we'd have found it

760
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:57,718
If there had been a dream between us

761
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:00,346
We would have fallen asleep

762
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,851
If there had been peace between us

763
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,604
We would have forgotten

764
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,525
If there had been a path to take us

765
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:15,987
Together, we'd have walked it

766
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:21,492
If there had been a route to take us

767
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:25,621
Together, we'd have found it

768
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:33,963
Is there a single refrain
repeated between us?

769
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:42,221
Are there too many people
coming between us?

770
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:47,351
Is there a moon, is there a tree?

771
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:50,354
Or even a broken bridge to see?

772
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:55,151
Is there a plain, is there a mountain?

773
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:58,237
Or even a forgotten valley?

774
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:04,493
Or perhaps there is a new path

775
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:08,039
That we can't yet see?

776
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,378
Here. Welcome.

777
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,933
Friends, we are under threat.

778
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:54,979
Come on. Don't exaggerate.

779
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:58,482
We need to fetch our weapons.
We no longer have a choice.

780
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,953
How could you go without telling me?

781
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,707
Don't you know what's going on?

782
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:19,170
I swear, you're going to make me ill.

783
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:21,005
Are you drunk?

784
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:27,595
Nassim? Nassim, darling?

785
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:28,929
Darling?

786
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:30,973
Why isn't he answering?

787
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:32,183
Nassim?

788
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,351
Nassim, my love?

789
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,522
What's wrong?

790
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,692
What is it, darling?

791
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:46,864
Answer me!

792
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:51,243
What happened to you, my child?

793
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:54,872
Nassim!

794
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:58,375
Roukoz, what happened?

795
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,503
Tell me, what's going on?

796
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,547
Why won't he answer?

797
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,260
Speak to me, little one!

798
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,888
Roukoz, tell me!

799
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,057
Why the silence? Speak to me!

800
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,187
It was me! It's all my fault!

801
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,940
We took a wrong turn on the way home.

802
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:24,235
There were people shooting each other.

803
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:26,862
Christians and Muslims. He was hit.

804
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,405
I didn't know what to do.

805
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,698
They killed him!

806
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,202
I beg you, Sainted Virgin!

807
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:36,163
I'm going to tell lssam.

808
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:39,291
What are you doing? You stay here!

809
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:40,834
He needs to know.

810
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:42,378
You know what he's like!

811
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:45,297
He'll kill a Muslim and start a war!

812
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:46,757
I beg you.

813
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,008
He needs to know.

814
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,135
Let me tell him.

815
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:54,223
He's all I have now. I can't lose him, too.

816
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,441
Answer me, baby.

817
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:08,279
Answer me, sweetheart.

818
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:01,767
Get down from there.

819
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:11,485
Are you not a mother?

820
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,822
You take people's children without asking?

821
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,575
What right do you have to take him from me?

822
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,703
Why didn't you protect him?

823
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,371
What were you doing?

824
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,417
I trusted you with him
and this is how you give him back?

825
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,044
This is how you return him?

826
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:31,880
Go see him, he's in the well!

827
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,342
You don't care. Your son's in your arms!

828
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,136
But where's my son?

829
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,557
Why do you look at me like that?

830
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,477
Answer me! Where is my son? Where is he?

831
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:49,148
Give him back.

832
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,651
Give him back to me!

833
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:58,741
You'll never see me here again,
you hear me?

834
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:05,748
I won't let you hurt any more children.

835
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:48,957
Rita.

836
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,426
That's enough crying now.

837
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:04,223
Go wash up and put on some makeup.

838
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,184
Put on some colorful clothes.

839
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:12,898
You, just behave like normal.

840
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,610
If anyone asks, Nassim's sick.

841
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,779
Say he's got mumps.

842
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,783
Nobody can see him, okay?

843
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:08,180
Give it back then.

844
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:10,182
It's fly spray!

845
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:13,268
- Give it.
- Nothing will hide your goat-y smell.

846
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:15,771
And you smell like jasmine?

847
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,356
Not goat in any case.

848
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:20,400
Give me that cap, you dirty pig!

849
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:24,655
What's up with you?

850
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:26,365
It's Nassim's cap!

851
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,912
Tell him to come and get it!

852
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:45,801
Oh, my God!

853
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,014
Get moving!

854
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:54,184
How could you do that? Go on, move.

855
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:57,270
Shame on you! What were you thinking?

856
01:11:57,397 --> 01:12:01,566
Don't we have enough problems already?

857
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:08,407
Takla?

858
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,246
Open up. It's Afaf.

859
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:18,834
How are you?

860
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:21,878
Hammoudi has come to apologize to Nassim,

861
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,463
and return his cap.

862
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,465
Go on, darling.

863
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:30,512
It was a joke. I didn't mean it.

864
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,139
I'm very sorry.

865
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,348
Go on, go in.

866
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:37,227
No, he can't come in. Nassim is ill.

867
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,312
He won't go near him.

868
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:42,691
You don't get it. He has the mumps.

869
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:46,361
It's contagious. It's dangerous for boys.

870
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:47,821
We have enough problems!

871
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:50,115
He's a big, strong lad.

872
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,702
He'll be fine. Why do you look so serious?

873
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:56,413
Nassim?

874
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:04,880
- He's asleep, we'll come back.
- Just apologize from here.

875
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,965
He has a sore throat. He can't speak.

876
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,884
Do I talk to the door?

877
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:10,927
Go on, speak. He'll hear you.

878
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:14,473
Yes, he'll hear. Say what you have to say.

879
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,395
Speak up!

880
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,399
I came to apologize.

881
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:27,944
I'm sorry about what happened.

882
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,113
We're children of the same village.

883
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,324
We're brothers.

884
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,328
I regret what happened.

885
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:39,831
You, Roukoz and your cap
deserve our respect.

886
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:44,211
Don't be mad at me. I'm sorry.

887
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:46,129
We're sons of the same village.

888
01:13:46,214 --> 01:13:48,340
I promise it will never happen again.

889
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:50,175
I'll kiss the door.

890
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:54,096
Your cap's in great shape. As good as new.

891
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,014
I'll leave it here for you.

892
01:13:56,808 --> 01:13:59,142
I hope you get well soon.

893
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:00,227
Happy now?

894
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,903
Why are you so pale?

895
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:13,240
It's nothing. I'm just tired.

896
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:16,451
Everything will be all right. Don't worry.

897
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:19,955
Don't worry about Nassim.
Mumps is nothing.

898
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:22,791
Two mallow compresses and he'll be fine.

899
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,377
Wash your face and get dressed.

900
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:28,839
We'll go to Amale's and see what to do.

901
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:31,883
"What to do"? What is there left to do?

902
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,177
Come on. I'm counting on you.

903
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:36,263
No, I'm staying with my son.

904
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,559
She's strange today.

905
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,402
And I remember, her mother-in-law
was still alive then.

906
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:56,241
Saydeh says Nassim's already had mumps.

907
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:57,993
- Hasn't he?
- Yes.

908
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:00,912
Along with my boy when they were small.

909
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:05,125
Why are you lying to us?
Your mother-in-law was still alive.

910
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,627
Two days I've been worrying.

911
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:09,421
What are you hiding?

912
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:11,173
Tell us. What is it?

913
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,967
What's wrong?

914
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,254
Hello, Mom.

915
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:53,632
Hello, lssam, how are you?

916
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:55,050
Where's Aida?

917
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,095
Where's the green box? I can't find it.

918
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:00,847
What box? I don't know.

919
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:03,183
I've searched the whole house.

920
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:06,728
- Did you hide it?
- No. Why do you want guns?

921
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:07,896
Why guns?

922
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:19,324
Why do you want guns?

923
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:22,494
Where is Nassim?

924
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:24,704
Why is it locked?

925
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:26,873
I told you, he has mumps.

926
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:29,125
Stop with the mumps! Open it!

927
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,211
Open this door!

928
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:33,088
Your brother has mumps.

929
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,173
That's enough. Let me in!

930
01:16:35,258 --> 01:16:37,008
I won't give you the key!

931
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,428
- Leave her, you'll kill her.
- The key!

932
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,684
- I beg you.
- Stop it, Mom.

933
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,324
Where's Nassim?

934
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:06,955
Where's Nassim?
Look at me. Where is Nassim?

935
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,084
Where is he? Did someone hurt him?

936
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:14,754
Aida, where is Nassim?

937
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,632
Why this silence? Where is he?

938
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,137
Is Nassim hurt?

939
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,222
Did someone hurt him?

940
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:26,933
Where is Nassim? Tell me!

941
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:34,274
Where is he? What did they do to him?

942
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:38,069
Did they hurt him? Those sons of bitches?

943
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:43,241
- Who hurt him?
- Nobody, I promise.

944
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:51,291
Who did it?

945
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:10,477
Issam, I beg you.
It was nobody from the village!

946
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,562
I beg you!

947
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,707
Those sons of bitches!

948
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:39,422
Mom, what are you doing?

949
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:43,927
Are you crazy?

950
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:45,470
You're staying here.

951
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,055
Drop it!

952
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:48,348
You're staying here!

953
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:49,432
Put it down!

954
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:51,184
It was nobody from the village!

955
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,144
- Drop that!
- You're going nowhere!

956
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:03,822
I won't let you die, too!

957
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:14,290
What are you doing?

958
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,126
You can't stay here!

959
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:17,293
Are you crazy?

960
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,129
She's stoned.

961
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:21,172
- Calm down. Here.
- I don't want any!

962
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,465
- Why not?
- Because!

963
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,509
It's kicking off here!

964
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,012
They've gone crazy. Blown a fuse.

965
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:31,266
- So what?
- You think it's better anywhere else?

966
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:33,184
They booked us for a week.

967
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:34,978
They're counting on us.

968
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:36,646
We're staying, whatever.

969
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:39,607
Okay. It's your choice.

970
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,693
But you won't see a dime.

971
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,611
We're really scared!

972
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,321
We're terrified!

973
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,323
Good-bye!

974
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:54,122
We're in the shit, Father.

975
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,708
They're out of control.

976
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:59,377
My dear lmam,

977
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:03,882
forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

978
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:07,218
And you think we do?

979
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,055
We've one man dead,
and they'll want revenge.

980
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:14,726
Luckily, they don't know about Nassim.

981
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:19,272
When they find out he was killed,
regardless of where,

982
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:22,192
there'll be no holding them back,

983
01:20:22,276 --> 01:20:24,319
and it'll be a bloodbath.

984
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:27,155
Dear lmam, my hands are tied.

985
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:30,450
They got me to fake a miracle.

986
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:33,036
I won't even get into hell, now.

987
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:36,039
You see those women?

988
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,833
If we go with them,

989
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:41,836
and do what they want,

990
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:45,131
1,000 paradises await us!

991
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,718
Who is it?

992
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,220
Yvonne. Open up.

993
01:20:57,645 --> 01:20:58,978
It's all I had.

994
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:02,440
With a little hash, it'll
knock out a camel.

995
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:13,701
Cut, chop

996
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,537
Crush, smash

997
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:17,539
Grind it fine, don't hold back

998
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:19,499
Mix it all together

999
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:23,711
Take the finest hash
Worth its weight in gold

1000
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:27,924
Yellow or brown
It makes no difference

1001
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:31,636
Add some more, don't be shy
This hashish comes from my heart

1002
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:34,472
He's drowning, throw him a ring

1003
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,183
Roll it, knead it

1004
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:39,352
Mix it, stretch it

1005
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:42,021
Plait it, turn it, bake it

1006
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,065
Nice and slow

1007
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:47,652
Take the finest hash
Worth its weight in gold

1008
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:51,489
Yellow or red
He'll still be stoned

1009
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:55,743
Add some more, don't be shy
This hashish comes from my heart

1010
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,162
He's drowning, throw him a ring

1011
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,295
In the name of Allah, the all-merciful,

1012
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:08,172
all inhabitants of our dear village,

1013
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:12,427
we invite you to a meeting

1014
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,847
about the stupid things
you are currently doing,

1015
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:17,557
and which we want to stop.

1016
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:21,811
We invite you on Thursday, at 6:00 p.m.,

1017
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:24,480
to Madame Amale's café.

1018
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:27,317
For all children of Christ,

1019
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:30,028
attendance is compulsory!

1020
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:35,158
Let us clean consciences and hearts
of the atrocities you do to each other.

1021
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:39,454
And maybe later, when our guests leave,

1022
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:41,873
they might have a good word to say

1023
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:44,542
after you have humiliated us

1024
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:46,502
dragging us through the mud.

1025
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:48,212
Shame on you!

1026
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:51,174
Attendance is compulsory!

1027
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:53,384
Compulsory!

1028
01:22:55,346 --> 01:22:58,973
Peace be with you, and God bless you!

1029
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:05,104
Chop it, fry it

1030
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:06,648
Stuff it, roll it

1031
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:10,777
Mix it, sprinkle it
In the oven it goes

1032
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:15,323
Take the finest hash
Worth its weight in gold

1033
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:18,034
Yellow or brown
He'll still be stoned

1034
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:23,414
Add some more, don't be shy
This hashish comes from my heart

1035
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:26,125
He's bored, and needs some fun

1036
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:28,628
Forget his silliness

1037
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:30,672
Good riddance to his problems

1038
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,715
Perhaps now he'll understand

1039
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,801
And we might see him smile again

1040
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:39,347
Take the finest hash
Worth its weight in gold

1041
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:43,267
Red or brown
It makes no difference

1042
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:47,230
Add some more, don't be shy
This hashish comes from my heart

1043
01:23:47,398 --> 01:23:49,816
He's sleepy
Give him his pajamas!

1044
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:55,363
- It's very good with juice.
- No, thank you.

1045
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:58,616
Go on, for me. It's delicious.

1046
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:00,201
Help yourself.

1047
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:11,295
While you wait for the priest.

1048
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,047
Enjoy!

1049
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:14,757
While we wait for the imam.

1050
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,336
Where is the mayor?

1051
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:55,631
He's sulking.
Nobody asked him about the meeting.

1052
01:24:56,467 --> 01:24:58,676
Don't worry. I sorted him out.

1053
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:22,700
Abou Ahmad! Cheers, my friend!

1054
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,160
Cheers, asshole!

1055
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,086
Eight...

1056
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:45,801
On the tape, they said from the olive tree
it was 20 paces south.

1057
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:50,681
Spare us the science, Einstein.
That's south. Carry on.

1058
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:52,516
Where was I? Nine,

1059
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:54,852
10, 11 ...

1060
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,604
Wait, Amale. Wait.

1061
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:59,106
They counted in men's shoe sizes.

1062
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:01,192
You're only a size six.

1063
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,361
Afaf, you have feet like a man.

1064
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:06,238
- You must be a 10.
- Very funny, Cinderella!

1065
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:08,491
You trod on my foot!

1066
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:11,869
Sorry, darling. Where were we?

1067
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:15,456
- Fourteen...
- Fifteen...

1068
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:28,094
Good job, Katia!

1069
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:36,347
Allah?

1070
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:49,693
"Praise be to Allah for his graciousness."

1071
01:31:08,046 --> 01:31:09,547
Did you take up yoga?

1072
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:15,553
That's it. We've gone and lost her now!

1073
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:22,560
Did you forget your pills, dear?

1074
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:28,899
No. Her brain is fried forever.

1075
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:33,112
Is your hotline to the Virgin down?

1076
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:37,241
Poor me.

1077
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:39,743
She's gone for good.

1078
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:44,498
Praise be to the Prophet, by the Prophet,

1079
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,417
and go wash your mouth.

1080
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:51,255
"By the Prophet"?

1081
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:55,843
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1082
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:58,095
The Lord be with you...

1083
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:03,100
Are you feeling okay, Mom?

1084
01:32:03,894 --> 01:32:05,311
What's that?

1085
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:07,479
What's that thing?

1086
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:12,151
What's wrong with you, Mom?

1087
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:15,279
What are you wearing?

1088
01:32:19,326 --> 01:32:20,659
Where are the girls?

1089
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:22,786
Where did they go?

1090
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,956
Why don't you answer, Mom?

1091
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:31,420
Have you blown a fuse?

1092
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,130
Shut up. Time for mass.

1093
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:34,840
Mass?

1094
01:32:35,008 --> 01:32:38,510
I'm wearing this now
for walking in the village.

1095
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:41,222
Come on, everybody! Come look at me!

1096
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,224
I'm only half-dressed!

1097
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:45,726
What's this dictionary under my pillow?

1098
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:48,103
It's the book of God. It's the gospel.

1099
01:32:48,355 --> 01:32:51,607
It's my holy book now, the gospel!

1100
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:56,737
Come and open the door right now
or I'll smash it and smash you, too!

1101
01:32:56,905 --> 01:33:00,658
Smash me? Like your neighbor, Georges?

1102
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:03,494
Only yesterday, you ate hummus with him

1103
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:07,164
calling him,
"Georgie, my friend, my brother!"

1104
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:09,541
And now you want to kill him?

1105
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:12,503
Because, out there, they're fighting?

1106
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:15,005
You want to cut him into pieces?

1107
01:33:15,674 --> 01:33:18,217
Well, I'm one of theirs now. I'm Georgette.

1108
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:21,011
Start with me! Come and kill me!

1109
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:24,556
It's what I look like now.
Like it or lump it.

1110
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:27,559
- Where are you going?
- To the depths of hell!

1111
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:30,688
Whose is this hand on the door?

1112
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:33,607
The hand that will strangle you

1113
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:36,860
if you keep this up.
Go throw some more blackberries!

1114
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:38,988
You want to make a fool of me?

1115
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:42,241
You're fools already!
You're driving us nuts!

1116
01:33:42,409 --> 01:33:45,244
The cards have been dealt.
What's done is done.

1117
01:33:45,412 --> 01:33:46,829
A curse on you!

1118
01:33:51,668 --> 01:33:54,086
We're already cursed.

1119
01:33:54,254 --> 01:33:56,046
You broke our hearts.

1120
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:58,340
We've nothing left to hope for.

1121
01:33:58,717 --> 01:34:00,759
What are you wearing? What's that?

1122
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:02,720
Don't you like it? Divorce me then!

1123
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,221
I must be dreaming!

1124
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,056
Where are you going?

1125
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,349
To Mecca!

1126
01:34:07,517 --> 01:34:09,727
May God punish you, Father Constantine!

1127
01:34:14,441 --> 01:34:16,400
Did we get away with it?

1128
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:20,487
Down here, maybe.
But up there, I'm not so sure.

1129
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:49,850
Now you live with the enemy.

1130
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:53,604
Mom, what have you done?

1131
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:56,565
I'm one of them now.

1132
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:58,400
What more can you do?

1133
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:14,166
Get up, my son.

1134
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,043
We have to bury your brother.

1135
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:29,700
My story is now ending
for all those who were listening.

1136
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:34,705
Of a town where peace was found,
while fighting continued all around.

1137
01:36:35,582 --> 01:36:38,625
Of men who slept so deep

1138
01:36:38,835 --> 01:36:41,753
and woke to find new peace.

1139
01:36:43,089 --> 01:36:46,341
Of women still in black,

1140
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:49,052
who fought with flowers and prayers

1141
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:51,305
instead of guns and flares,

1142
01:36:51,473 --> 01:36:53,265
and to protect their children.

1143
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:57,769
Destiny then drove them to find a new way.

1144
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:40,521
Where do we go now?

1145
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:48,362
To our mothers...

1146
