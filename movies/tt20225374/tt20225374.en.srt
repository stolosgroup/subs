1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,741
Ah! It's hot.

3
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:27,577
Why such a hurry?

4
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:47,832
I'm going to the old lab.

5
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,838
Ugh... I hate this place.

6
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,019
Careful up here.

7
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,706
Look what I found.

8
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:40,010
Enough Vesper,
my battery is low.

9
00:07:44,014 --> 00:07:46,016
Nobody forced you to come.

10
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,618
You should have stayed home
to charge.

11
00:07:58,863 --> 00:08:01,265
You're wasting our time
on these experiments.

12
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:15,713
Don't worry.

13
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:18,682
It won't hurt.

14
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:39,136
Thank you.

15
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:43,240
Wait here.

16
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:06,730
It's just a pilgrim.
Come on.

17
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:24,782
- I think it's a "she".
- Leave it.

18
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:01,385
One day, I'd like to follow one,

19
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:03,821
find out where
they're taking all that junk.

20
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,757
Don't.
They just wander until they die.

21
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:10,160
How do you know
they never come home?

22
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,363
Everyone knows it.

23
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:15,299
How could anyone know
about all of them?

24
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:18,302
Vesper.
She's not coming back.

25
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:33,517
Is there anyone in there
with you?

26
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,522
I think they're gone.

27
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:40,991
I don't hear anything.

28
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,939
Vesper, the tank!

29
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:00,871
The power!

30
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,619
Get the back up from the fridge.

31
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:18,322
I took it out...

32
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:22,025
I needed space
for my cell cultures.

33
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:34,438
I'll go to Jonas.

34
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,204
Who is in charge?

35
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,644
Who is in charge?

36
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:49,513
Me...

37
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,648
But they didn't attach the po...

38
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,653
The Jug was your responsibility.

39
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:01,225
Now put the poor creature
out of its misery.

40
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,047
It's not human.

41
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:25,649
It won't feel a thing.

42
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,419
It was made in a lab.

43
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,635
That Jug might have cost you
a fortune. What a waste.

44
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:54,571
- What brings you, Vesper?
- You know.

45
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:58,275
How would I? You're holed up
in that shack with my brother.

46
00:15:58,308 --> 00:16:00,845
Someone sabotaged our generator.

47
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,245
Is that so?

48
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,548
What a world.

49
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:07,785
All our bacteria's gone.

50
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,287
We have no power.

51
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,356
Il you know we can't do charity.

52
00:16:13,825 --> 00:16:15,693
I'm not asking for any.

53
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:28,438
Believe me, we work for it.

54
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:31,909
Family has to stick together
to survive out here,

55
00:16:31,943 --> 00:16:36,814
especially with the Citadel
raising the price of seeds.

56
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:39,383
Fortunately,
we have what they want.

57
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,921
Skinny!

58
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:46,724
Look who's come to see us.

59
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:24,227
Your blood won't be young
for ever.

60
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,700
Shame to waste it all
on emergencies like this.

61
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,636
But of course,

62
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,439
living alone as you do,

63
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,374
you're lucky
it hasn't been worse.

64
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:41,344
Pilgrims, drifters, bandits...

65
00:17:41,913 --> 00:17:43,580
They come to your door,

66
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:46,550
and it can all end in tragedy.

67
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:49,553
You'd be safer here.

68
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:52,456
What about my father?

69
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,926
We would take care of him.

70
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,494
It's not his fault
your mother left.

71
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:01,631
You'd both be more comfortable,

72
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:05,569
especially during the winter.

73
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:10,540
You remind me so much
of your mother.

74
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,351
I hope you're not afraid of me?

75
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:27,457
I'm not going to become just
another one of your breeders.

76
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:33,630
You say it
like it's a dirty word.

77
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:38,568
Think you're better
than everyone?

78
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:40,303
I have skills.

79
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:42,572
I taught myself.

80
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,776
And one day I'll get out.

81
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:46,744
But you...

82
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:49,346
You'll still be here,

83
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:52,016
sucking your kids' blood
to trade for seeds.

84
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:55,452
My ambitious little girl.

85
00:18:57,454 --> 00:18:59,791
You know we are so alike,
you and I.

86
00:19:01,692 --> 00:19:05,562
Because we won't let this world
of shit crush us, will we?

87
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:13,871
But don't think you can change
the order of things.

88
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:19,944
Take every opportunity
as it comes to you.

89
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,524
Can I have my bacteria now?

90
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,361
You'll have to come back
in two days' time.

91
00:19:39,697 --> 00:19:42,099
I need to sell your blood
to the Citadel, first.

92
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,769
You know Papa won't survive
that long without energy.

93
00:19:44,802 --> 00:19:46,636
I wish I had some more to spare.

94
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:53,110
No!

95
00:19:53,978 --> 00:19:56,346
No!

96
00:19:56,814 --> 00:19:58,648
No! No!

97
00:23:58,122 --> 00:24:00,658
You won't be mad anymore
when you see what I got.

98
00:24:17,842 --> 00:24:20,177
What is this?
Where did you get that?

99
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:22,813
- Jonas gave me.
- For what?

100
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:26,717
- What did you do to get them?
- Nothing.

101
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,821
I just took them.

102
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:32,723
Put them back before he notices.

103
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,326
No.

104
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:39,230
They're mine,
and I'm going to unlock them.

105
00:24:39,263 --> 00:24:41,966
- Make them fertile.
- You know that's not possible.

106
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:45,302
Once I do, the Citadel will
want me to work in their labs.

107
00:24:45,336 --> 00:24:47,805
They'll never let you
work inside.

108
00:24:47,838 --> 00:24:50,274
You're just afraid
that I'll leave, like Mum!

109
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:53,377
Oh Vesper,

110
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,947
you don't know
the cost of dreams.

111
00:24:57,481 --> 00:24:58,983
Shut up!

112
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:02,686
- Your place is here.
- Shut up!

113
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:06,170
I saw a wing-glider last night.

114
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:09,206
Maybe it crashed.

115
00:28:13,977 --> 00:28:16,447
Wouldn't you want to help?
If it were you?

116
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,549
Dump her back
where you found her.

117
00:28:18,582 --> 00:28:20,584
She's not our responsibility.

118
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:35,366
Maybe she could help us.

119
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,201
Oh, no...

120
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:40,170
You think she's going to take us
to the Citadel.

121
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,140
These people do not act
out of kindness.

122
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:46,910
What does she have to gain
by bringing you?

123
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:48,512
Maybe...

124
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,548
- The labs.
- Nothing.

125
00:28:53,117 --> 00:28:54,985
Do you want to blow us up?

126
00:28:55,018 --> 00:28:57,087
Would you prefer
that I left her there to die?

127
00:28:57,588 --> 00:28:58,555
Yes!

128
00:29:22,613 --> 00:29:24,148
Where is the man I was with?

129
00:29:25,215 --> 00:29:26,350
You were alone.

130
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:31,155
I need to find him.

131
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:33,090
He might be injured,
our glider crashed.

132
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:35,125
Can you take me
to where you found me?

133
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:38,696
You're not going
to get very far.

134
00:29:47,404 --> 00:29:48,639
Can you help me?

135
00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:52,509
Can you help me?

136
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:03,721
You can go.

137
00:30:04,354 --> 00:30:06,623
You can get help.
You can search for him.

138
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:09,226
We're not your servants.

139
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:13,063
Yes. Please forgive my manners.

140
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:15,700
The man is my father
and I'm scared for him.

141
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,269
Any help you provide
will not go unrewarded.

142
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:21,071
We have helped.

143
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:23,407
Did you call the Citadel?
Are they coming?

144
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,042
I don't know.

145
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,110
I fell from the glider
before it crashed.

146
00:30:27,144 --> 00:30:28,645
- Pap.
- No!

147
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,414
You can't stop me.

148
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:33,517
Do what you want,
but don't come crying to me.

149
00:30:35,352 --> 00:30:36,620
I'm Camellia.

150
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:39,256
Vesper.

151
00:30:39,657 --> 00:30:41,726
You will not regret helping us.

152
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:43,695
You have my word.

153
00:30:44,328 --> 00:30:45,730
We'll start at sunrise.

154
00:30:46,463 --> 00:30:49,333
- It's not safe at night.
- Thank you.

155
00:31:27,705 --> 00:31:29,540
I gave you the juiciest ones.

156
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,784
Thank you.

157
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:48,458
Who lives here with you?

158
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:51,796
Just... me and Pap.

159
00:31:52,764 --> 00:31:56,400
The... cranky drone.

160
00:31:58,235 --> 00:32:00,604
He uses it to communicate.

161
00:32:00,637 --> 00:32:02,674
What happened to him?

162
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:06,510
He got hurt, serving for the...

163
00:32:07,244 --> 00:32:08,680
Citadel's army.

164
00:32:10,147 --> 00:32:13,617
All they gave him
was that old scrap drone.

165
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:15,753
If we brought you both
to the Citadel,

166
00:32:15,787 --> 00:32:17,621
I'm sure they could help him.

167
00:32:17,655 --> 00:32:19,456
Really? You...

168
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,726
You could do that?

169
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:22,694
Um-hum.

170
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:26,396
My father is
a very influential man.

171
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:29,734
You hear that Pap?

172
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:33,303
Pap?

173
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:43,915
Pap, Pap, Pap!

174
00:32:43,948 --> 00:32:46,617
Stop!

175
00:32:46,651 --> 00:32:47,885
Pap, no.

176
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,388
Pap! Pap! Pap!

177
00:32:52,255 --> 00:32:55,325
No, stop. Stop it! Pap!

178
00:32:55,727 --> 00:32:58,629
Stop, Pap.

179
00:32:58,663 --> 00:33:01,699
Stop, Pap. Please. Stop!

180
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:04,501
- Please, stop.
- Keep hold of him.

181
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:30,695
He's sleeping now.

182
00:34:10,735 --> 00:34:12,536
What did she do to you?

183
00:34:12,569 --> 00:34:13,871
I don't know.

184
00:34:15,907 --> 00:34:18,375
Can everyone
from the Citadel do that?

185
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:19,609
I don't think so.

186
00:34:20,678 --> 00:34:22,646
Lucky she was there.

187
00:34:24,614 --> 00:34:25,950
She's awake now.

188
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,391
Vesper?

189
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:17,460
I expected to find pilgrims.

190
00:36:21,132 --> 00:36:22,867
This man needs help.

191
00:36:25,402 --> 00:36:28,105
- Good to see you, Darius.
- Jonas.

192
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:30,107
I see you got your power back.

193
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:33,845
I found backup supply.

194
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:35,746
How fortunate.

195
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:38,883
We still owe you for that blood.

196
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,551
You should come and see us.

197
00:36:51,762 --> 00:36:52,997
Bring me...

198
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:55,933
Bring me...

199
00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:06,509
Why has no one from the Citadel
come to find you?

200
00:37:06,844 --> 00:37:08,045
Camel...

201
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:11,682
Close blinds...

202
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:16,988
Lay with me.

203
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:23,627
I've always wondered...

204
00:37:25,963 --> 00:37:28,632
What do you do
with my children's blood?

205
00:37:31,802 --> 00:37:34,638
Do you use it
to make your own more special?

206
00:37:47,151 --> 00:37:48,085
Help.

207
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:50,755
Please.

208
00:37:57,128 --> 00:37:58,528
You're suffering?

209
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:05,635
- Now you know how it feels.
- No!

210
00:38:07,738 --> 00:38:10,640
No! No!

211
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:14,045
No! No!

212
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:18,481
No! No!

213
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:23,955
No! Let him!

214
00:38:28,525 --> 00:38:29,660
No.

215
00:38:30,294 --> 00:38:31,628
No...

216
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:34,765
No. No...

217
00:38:47,278 --> 00:38:48,611
Take it apart.

218
00:38:50,181 --> 00:38:51,949
Salvage what's good.

219
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:56,754
What's bothering you?

220
00:38:58,155 --> 00:39:00,557
Did this man
mean anything to you?

221
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:21,145
There was another passenger.

222
00:39:33,691 --> 00:39:35,525
How did you find this?

223
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:40,698
We were foraging.

224
00:39:41,165 --> 00:39:43,768
What, you just...
stumbled on it?

225
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:49,572
Why won't you look at me?

226
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:51,776
Because she's afraid of you!

227
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:53,210
Let's go, Vesper.

228
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:55,813
No.

229
00:39:56,747 --> 00:39:58,049
You don't just leave.

230
00:39:58,983 --> 00:40:01,185
Not without helping
to clean up first.

231
00:40:36,053 --> 00:40:37,888
We say we didn't find anything.

232
00:40:37,922 --> 00:40:39,790
Can't lie to her for ever.

233
00:40:39,824 --> 00:40:41,992
Jonas is looking for her.

234
00:40:42,026 --> 00:40:44,995
It would be dangerous
if she did anything rash.

235
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:46,997
We have to inform the Citadel.

236
00:40:47,031 --> 00:40:49,934
Jonas is the only one
with a transceiver.

237
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:50,935
So?

238
00:40:51,836 --> 00:40:54,105
You've never snuck
into his farm before?

239
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:03,013
Did you find him?

240
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:07,251
We didn't find anything.

241
00:41:12,056 --> 00:41:13,324
But how...

242
00:41:14,325 --> 00:41:17,094
The wing-glider couldn't have
crashed so far away.

243
00:41:17,928 --> 00:41:21,765
The area is...
It's really big.

244
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:26,137
We'll go tomorrow.

245
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,772
We need to inform
the Citadel about the crash.

246
00:41:30,274 --> 00:41:32,376
Our neighbour has a transceiver.

247
00:41:32,943 --> 00:41:34,712
We'll go in the morning.

248
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:38,215
Yes.

249
00:41:39,383 --> 00:41:40,818
All right.

250
00:41:42,286 --> 00:41:43,654
Let's do that.

251
00:41:54,498 --> 00:41:56,100
Your leg.

252
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:58,869
You've almost stopped limping.

253
00:41:58,903 --> 00:42:00,204
Can I see?

254
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:06,277
You made that?

255
00:42:07,344 --> 00:42:08,412
I did it for him.

256
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,315
To protect his open sores,
but...

257
00:42:11,348 --> 00:42:14,118
It doesn't speed up
the healing process.

258
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,857
I didn't know people here knew
so much about synthetic biology.

259
00:42:20,324 --> 00:42:22,860
The vermin have brains, too.

260
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:25,296
This is nothing.

261
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:31,202
- Come with me.
- Vesper, it's not safe.

262
00:42:31,235 --> 00:42:34,038
She needs to see my work
if she takes us to the Citadel.

263
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:36,307
Let's go.

264
00:43:47,011 --> 00:43:49,913
The little ones always greet me.

265
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:19,510
She likes you.

266
00:44:37,995 --> 00:44:40,197
This is the first one I created.

267
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:49,540
He's sulking, because I haven't
been here for a few days.

268
00:44:51,642 --> 00:44:54,411
He is not the best looking,
but...

269
00:44:55,312 --> 00:44:56,847
He has character.

270
00:44:57,981 --> 00:44:59,049
Like Pap.

271
00:45:03,153 --> 00:45:04,321
Come on.

272
00:45:54,338 --> 00:45:58,041
They're safer here,
but I hope one day,

273
00:45:58,075 --> 00:46:01,011
they make their way out
into the world.

274
00:46:02,446 --> 00:46:04,682
I've never seen
anything like it.

275
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:09,586
We have to show Elias.

276
00:46:10,254 --> 00:46:11,255
Who?

277
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:14,692
My father.

278
00:46:16,393 --> 00:46:19,496
He's the synthetic biology head,
at the Citadel.

279
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:22,633
He would love this.

280
00:46:23,634 --> 00:46:25,436
I'm still learning.

281
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:30,274
The first ones
didn't even survive,

282
00:46:30,307 --> 00:46:32,342
or, they killed each other.

283
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:36,146
But I'm getting closer

284
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,082
to the right assembly
with each generation.

285
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:44,588
I still make mistakes though.

286
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:49,092
This one should be blue
like the others.

287
00:46:51,763 --> 00:46:54,164
Something must have changed
my original code.

288
00:46:56,734 --> 00:47:00,437
Let's find out why you don't do
what you're supposed to.

289
00:47:01,038 --> 00:47:04,208
We both know
I won't make it to the Citadel.

290
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:07,712
But the kid trusts you.
It's everything to her.

291
00:47:37,709 --> 00:47:39,576
When did your mother pass away?

292
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,615
She's not dead.

293
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:47,685
She left us a year ago.

294
00:47:49,152 --> 00:47:50,554
Followed the pilgrims.

295
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:54,424
Who are the pilgrims?

296
00:47:56,527 --> 00:47:58,295
They wander in groups

297
00:47:58,328 --> 00:48:00,597
with veils over their faces,
scavenging old junk.

298
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,501
No one knows why.

299
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:07,170
They don't talk.

300
00:48:07,772 --> 00:48:09,707
Why did she follow them?

301
00:48:11,776 --> 00:48:13,610
Pap said she dreamed too much.

302
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:17,581
Got sad staying here.

303
00:48:22,185 --> 00:48:23,320
She...

304
00:48:24,889 --> 00:48:27,424
She scribed
these beautiful songs.

305
00:48:29,526 --> 00:48:31,663
When she sang,
it made me feel...

306
00:48:34,498 --> 00:48:35,599
Warm.

307
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:39,737
One morning, I...

308
00:48:41,138 --> 00:48:42,306
I went to her,

309
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,375
asking her to sing, but...

310
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,145
She'd lost her voice.

311
00:48:50,748 --> 00:48:52,583
Two days later she was gone.

312
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,192
Some people say...

313
00:49:03,193 --> 00:49:06,597
That it's a virus
that makes them pilgrims.

314
00:49:08,231 --> 00:49:10,668
She'd never have left you
if she had a choice.

315
00:49:24,782 --> 00:49:26,550
What about yours?

316
00:49:32,489 --> 00:49:33,658
I never met her.

317
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:38,796
Maybe it's better like that.

318
00:50:29,346 --> 00:50:30,682
Do they exist for real?

319
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:33,951
They did, a long time ago.

320
00:50:35,753 --> 00:50:39,857
Is it true that
the Citadel can generate any...

321
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:41,625
- Any life form?
- Hm.

322
00:50:48,331 --> 00:50:50,434
- Have you ever seen this one?
- Um-hum.

323
00:50:51,568 --> 00:50:53,938
That's a cat.
They're very independent.

324
00:50:55,372 --> 00:50:56,941
Does it make a sound?

325
00:50:59,010 --> 00:50:59,944
Yeah.

326
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:09,619
- What about this one?
- That's an owl.

327
00:51:09,654 --> 00:51:12,289
They fly and they go...

328
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:29,439
- This one?
- That's a parrot.

329
00:51:29,473 --> 00:51:31,676
They repeat everything you say.

330
00:51:32,476 --> 00:51:33,778
- What?
- What?

331
00:51:34,746 --> 00:51:36,714
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

332
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:39,016
- Oh, I get it.
- Oh, I get it.

333
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:41,886
- Stop now.
- Stop now.

334
00:51:41,919 --> 00:51:43,386
- Stop.
- Stop.

335
00:51:43,955 --> 00:51:46,824
- Stop it. Stop it now.
- Stop it. Stop it now.

336
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:48,391
- Stop.
- Stop.

337
00:51:48,693 --> 00:51:50,728
- Stop, Camellia.
- Stop, Camellia.

338
00:51:50,762 --> 00:51:54,364
- Stop it. Stop it.
- Stop it. Stop it.

339
00:51:54,397 --> 00:51:57,567
- Stop. Actually stop.
- Stop. Actually stop.

340
00:51:57,601 --> 00:51:59,603
- Stop. Stop.
- Stop. Stop.

341
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06,811
This is a wolf.

342
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:08,913
They travel in packs.

343
00:52:08,946 --> 00:52:12,415
And they like
to howl at the moon.

344
00:52:46,884 --> 00:52:50,320
Why is the Citadel so closed-off
to people like us?

345
00:52:54,058 --> 00:52:57,494
If they opened its doors to all,
there'd not be enough resources.

346
00:53:00,097 --> 00:53:01,598
But...

347
00:53:01,631 --> 00:53:04,802
You're creating Jugs
to serve you.

348
00:53:06,536 --> 00:53:08,072
We could do their work.

349
00:53:10,842 --> 00:53:12,743
The Citadel likes control.

350
00:53:13,711 --> 00:53:15,746
Jugs are designed to be loyal.

351
00:53:17,514 --> 00:53:19,382
It wouldn't be so easy
with humans.

352
00:53:58,689 --> 00:54:00,091
Hum something.

353
00:55:14,298 --> 00:55:16,267
He'll be busy with them.

354
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,468
I'll check if it's clear.

355
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:42,860
Come on in, Vesper.

356
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,608
The gyroscope wasn't
working properly.

357
00:55:59,076 --> 00:56:00,643
I'm fixing it for you.

358
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:08,652
What brings you two here?

359
00:56:14,191 --> 00:56:15,159
Vesper.

360
00:56:17,361 --> 00:56:19,830
Why are you trespassing
on my farm?

361
00:56:21,966 --> 00:56:25,202
We came to get what you owe us,
for the blood.

362
00:56:25,236 --> 00:56:27,671
Well there's no need
to sneak through the back.

363
00:56:28,172 --> 00:56:30,508
Last time,
your kids threw rocks at me.

364
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:33,110
Things have been
a bit tense here.

365
00:56:35,279 --> 00:56:38,115
A few days ago, our germinating
seeds disappeared...

366
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,751
Skinny was watching them.

367
00:56:41,852 --> 00:56:43,788
He said that bugs took them.

368
00:56:44,922 --> 00:56:45,923
Imagine?

369
00:56:50,361 --> 00:56:53,264
I had to send him away
to think about that.

370
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:58,102
If you can't trust
your family...

371
00:57:04,141 --> 00:57:06,744
Do you really think
bugs stole those seeds?

372
00:57:10,247 --> 00:57:11,581
Hold here.

373
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:24,895
If I caught a bug stealing
from my family's stockpile,

374
00:57:25,429 --> 00:57:27,231
I'd tear off his wings,

375
00:57:28,132 --> 00:57:30,267
each little tiny leg.

376
00:57:40,244 --> 00:57:42,279
And what about
the extra passenger?

377
00:57:44,315 --> 00:57:45,783
You've seen anything?

378
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:52,823
I have lost all patience
with liars.

379
00:57:57,795 --> 00:57:59,730
The drone is as good as new.

380
00:58:05,136 --> 00:58:07,338
But we don't do charity here.

381
00:58:47,344 --> 00:58:48,812
Are you hungry?

382
00:59:08,265 --> 00:59:09,767
Can you fly?

383
00:59:18,142 --> 00:59:19,810
What did he do to you?

384
00:59:21,445 --> 00:59:22,746
Fly one more time.

385
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:53,404
No!

386
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:04,915
No! No!

387
01:01:31,676 --> 01:01:33,177
What happened?

388
01:01:38,015 --> 01:01:39,283
Vesper?

389
01:01:45,356 --> 01:01:47,157
Did you contact the Citadel?

390
01:01:54,064 --> 01:01:55,366
Vesper.

391
01:02:02,473 --> 01:02:04,541
- Hey, just take a moment.
- No!

392
01:02:06,443 --> 01:02:08,112
- Vesper!
- No.

393
01:02:20,624 --> 01:02:23,661
- What if it can't be fixed?
- Of course it can.

394
01:02:25,496 --> 01:02:26,630
You'll find a way.

395
01:02:28,232 --> 01:02:29,066
I promise.

396
01:02:29,868 --> 01:02:32,369
And then we can go
look for Elias

397
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:36,573
because I'm feeling
so much better. Hm?

398
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:41,645
He's dead.

399
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,535
Show me.

400
01:03:37,601 --> 01:03:40,137
No, no, no!

401
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:42,606
No, no, no!

402
01:03:50,414 --> 01:03:52,049
No, no, no!

403
01:04:46,303 --> 01:04:47,471
You're a...

404
01:04:48,205 --> 01:04:49,406
I'm a Jug, yeah.

405
01:04:52,844 --> 01:04:55,646
But, I've seen a Jug before...

406
01:04:56,881 --> 01:04:58,750
It wasn't like you.

407
01:04:58,783 --> 01:05:00,584
He created me.

408
01:05:02,185 --> 01:05:03,420
I'm different.

409
01:05:06,758 --> 01:05:08,793
You can't get us
into the Citadel.

410
01:05:10,795 --> 01:05:13,430
We were escaping the Citadel
when we crashed.

411
01:05:15,532 --> 01:05:18,302
Creating an intelligent Jug
is a major crime.

412
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:20,137
They'd kill me.

413
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:24,241
Elias made a deal

414
01:05:24,274 --> 01:05:26,811
with another Citadel
for refugee status.

415
01:05:28,645 --> 01:05:30,748
You were never going to take us.

416
01:06:08,518 --> 01:06:10,722
Get cleaned up. Go!

417
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:23,661
Vesper, I'm sorry.

418
01:07:27,899 --> 01:07:30,333
I never felt so worthless.

419
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,681
Try to fly.

420
01:07:46,951 --> 01:07:48,686
You can't stay here.

421
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,387
Jonas marked you.

422
01:07:50,788 --> 01:07:52,857
He thinks you belong to him now.

423
01:07:54,558 --> 01:07:56,293
We're not going anywhere, Pap.

424
01:07:59,529 --> 01:08:00,798
She's a Jug.

425
01:08:03,467 --> 01:08:04,702
She lied to us.

426
01:08:07,739 --> 01:08:09,406
You were right.

427
01:08:12,442 --> 01:08:14,712
I'm going to take her to Jonas.

428
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:18,515
Then maybe he'll go easier
on me.

429
01:08:19,784 --> 01:08:21,618
Don't be too hard on her.

430
01:08:21,652 --> 01:08:23,755
Jugs obey their masters.

431
01:08:24,554 --> 01:08:26,490
She didn't have a choice.

432
01:09:42,934 --> 01:09:44,669
Stop!

433
01:10:08,826 --> 01:10:11,162
I don't exist anymore.

434
01:10:13,931 --> 01:10:17,467
You don't just get to give up
when things are hard.

435
01:10:19,502 --> 01:10:21,471
They're hard for all of us,

436
01:10:22,073 --> 01:10:23,473
but we stay,

437
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:27,510
and we help each other.

438
01:10:37,454 --> 01:10:38,723
Follow me.

439
01:10:51,068 --> 01:10:52,103
Sit.

440
01:10:56,173 --> 01:10:59,176
I found out why it wasn't doing
what it was supposed to.

441
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:04,481
It's met a fungus
with an orange pigment.

442
01:11:05,482 --> 01:11:09,153
They joined
and made something new.

443
01:11:10,955 --> 01:11:13,556
If a flower can change
its purpose,

444
01:11:14,058 --> 01:11:15,192
so can you.

445
01:11:30,908 --> 01:11:31,842
What?

446
01:11:35,846 --> 01:11:37,682
Could I study a sample of you?

447
01:12:03,808 --> 01:12:04,742
Camellia?

448
01:12:06,543 --> 01:12:07,712
Camellia?

449
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:21,491
See this part here.

450
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,095
It keeps repeating,

451
01:12:24,128 --> 01:12:26,664
but it doesn't belong
to your core DNA.

452
01:12:30,067 --> 01:12:32,203
- What is it?
- It's locked.

453
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:34,905
Elias didn't tell me anything.

454
01:12:55,059 --> 01:12:57,128
I used to play for Elias
when he was working,

455
01:12:57,161 --> 01:12:59,163
he said
it helped him concentrate.

456
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:02,066
He was in a Citadel lab.

457
01:13:03,367 --> 01:13:06,070
With their technology,
this would be easy.

458
01:13:06,103 --> 01:13:08,305
You wouldn't like it
in the Citadel.

459
01:13:11,776 --> 01:13:14,245
Elias used to say life there
was like a frozen river,

460
01:13:14,278 --> 01:13:16,047
the surface was beautiful,

461
01:13:17,314 --> 01:13:18,749
but underneath...

462
01:13:21,252 --> 01:13:23,687
Everyone tries to live for ever,

463
01:13:23,721 --> 01:13:25,689
and it's a joyless
and a lonely life.

464
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:27,825
You lived there.

465
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:31,162
I lived for Elias.

466
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:37,034
I entertained him,
I took care of him.

467
01:13:39,737 --> 01:13:41,806
I let him take care of me.

468
01:13:45,943 --> 01:13:47,344
I kept him warm,

469
01:13:48,245 --> 01:13:49,680
I helped him sleep...

470
01:13:57,855 --> 01:13:59,757
I did everything he told me to.

471
01:14:54,245 --> 01:14:55,279
Camellia?

472
01:14:57,481 --> 01:14:59,850
No. Keep playing.

473
01:15:07,057 --> 01:15:09,760
There, that last note,
keep playing that.

474
01:15:25,509 --> 01:15:27,111
Look.

475
01:15:29,013 --> 01:15:32,149
These,
the DNA sequences of plants...

476
01:15:33,784 --> 01:15:36,320
There are so many,
I don't get it.

477
01:15:38,422 --> 01:15:39,790
Wait.

478
01:16:19,263 --> 01:16:20,397
Pap!

479
01:16:26,036 --> 01:16:28,973
I found the key
to unlock the Citadel seeds.

480
01:16:29,506 --> 01:16:31,508
I can make them fertile.

481
01:16:32,476 --> 01:16:34,178
We'll never starve again.

482
01:16:37,548 --> 01:16:39,383
So that was his plan:

483
01:16:40,384 --> 01:16:43,520
to trade them for entrance
to the other Citadel.

484
01:16:44,421 --> 01:16:46,957
You need
to take Vesper there tomorrow.

485
01:16:48,092 --> 01:16:49,460
- No.
- Vesper.

486
01:16:49,493 --> 01:16:50,995
- Pap.
- You...

487
01:16:51,028 --> 01:16:52,896
I'm not leaving you.

488
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:56,567
You don't understand,
the Citadel will be ruthless.

489
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,337
I need new filters.
We have to go to the old lab.

490
01:17:17,288 --> 01:17:19,890
You won't believe
what I'm about to do.

491
01:18:10,974 --> 01:18:14,278
I'm so relieved
to finally find you, Miss.

492
01:18:14,311 --> 01:18:15,512
And you are?

493
01:18:18,048 --> 01:18:19,583
Where are my manners?

494
01:18:21,018 --> 01:18:22,886
My name is Jonas.

495
01:18:25,289 --> 01:18:26,890
I'm his brother.

496
01:18:31,995 --> 01:18:33,997
If you come back with me,

497
01:18:34,398 --> 01:18:36,533
I can help get you home.

498
01:18:36,567 --> 01:18:39,603
We've contacted the Citadel,
they're on their way.

499
01:18:41,605 --> 01:18:43,941
Either you're mistaken, or...

500
01:18:47,344 --> 01:18:49,346
Someone isn't truth-telling.

501
01:18:54,218 --> 01:18:58,889
I'm the only person in this area
with a transceiver.

502
01:19:00,557 --> 01:19:02,626
You have to be really careful

503
01:19:04,528 --> 01:19:06,330
who you trust.

504
01:19:08,198 --> 01:19:09,566
My place is more...

505
01:19:10,567 --> 01:19:12,903
appropriate for a lady.

506
01:19:14,037 --> 01:19:17,341
It's bigger, more comfortable.

507
01:19:23,748 --> 01:19:25,416
It doesn't smell of death.

508
01:19:29,486 --> 01:19:32,122
I'll go with you.

509
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,663
Unbelievable!

510
01:20:15,599 --> 01:20:17,501
You're practically human.

511
01:20:20,571 --> 01:20:23,775
- A Jug needs a master.
- I have one.

512
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:26,643
Not anymore, you don't.

513
01:21:00,277 --> 01:21:01,679
You think I'm stupid?

514
01:21:10,187 --> 01:21:13,190
Vesper stop! Stop that! Stop it!

515
01:21:17,795 --> 01:21:19,596
No, no, don't.

516
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:21,331
Jonas, no!

517
01:21:26,671 --> 01:21:27,638
Drop it.

518
01:21:51,328 --> 01:21:53,163
So this is how it ends.

519
01:22:20,357 --> 01:22:22,125
I want to make a deal.

520
01:23:06,436 --> 01:23:08,673
Camellia's owner was
an engineer.

521
01:23:11,743 --> 01:23:15,646
He hid the codes to
unlock the seeds inside her DNA.

522
01:23:24,722 --> 01:23:26,658
I can make them fertile.

523
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:41,638
We'll both have
all the food we need.

524
01:24:10,668 --> 01:24:12,870
I found the Jug
you're looking for.

525
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:21,478
This will mix
with the seeds' cells

526
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:23,613
and change their DNA.

527
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:24,982
How long will it take?

528
01:24:58,448 --> 01:24:59,483
It worked.

529
01:25:02,787 --> 01:25:06,023
This little one
can change our entire lives.

530
01:25:30,782 --> 01:25:32,649
Away from the window.

531
01:25:55,372 --> 01:25:56,573
Vesper...

532
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:28,773
Leave it.

533
01:27:02,139 --> 01:27:03,741
Don't breathe it.

534
01:27:24,662 --> 01:27:26,630
They'll be here soon.

535
01:27:27,564 --> 01:27:28,766
I'll turn myself in.

536
01:27:30,001 --> 01:27:32,502
It's too late for that.
They know we've helped you.

537
01:27:32,535 --> 01:27:34,105
You and Vesper have to go now.

538
01:27:34,138 --> 01:27:34,972
No!

539
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,475
- We're not leaving you here.
- Don't argue.

540
01:27:38,508 --> 01:27:40,845
I can buy you
enough time to escape.

541
01:27:46,684 --> 01:27:48,485
Look at me.

542
01:27:53,523 --> 01:27:57,194
You and Camellia must go
to the Citadel in the south.

543
01:27:57,228 --> 01:27:59,030
Trade the seeds for safety.

544
01:27:59,063 --> 01:28:01,766
No, I don't want any of this.

545
01:28:02,767 --> 01:28:04,769
I'll give them the seeds.

546
01:28:04,802 --> 01:28:06,804
It doesn't work that way.

547
01:28:06,837 --> 01:28:08,706
I'm not leaving you here.

548
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:11,709
Vesper.

549
01:28:13,978 --> 01:28:15,612
How about this?

550
01:28:17,281 --> 01:28:18,683
We'll trick them.

551
01:28:22,687 --> 01:28:25,790
You'll hide in the swamp
and I'll tell them you're gone,

552
01:28:26,589 --> 01:28:28,759
and when it's over
you can come back.

553
01:28:29,927 --> 01:28:34,065
I've worked for these people.
I know how to talk to them.

554
01:28:36,267 --> 01:28:37,534
Besides,

555
01:28:38,936 --> 01:28:41,471
how can they hurt me any more?

556
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:45,910
We could hide you from them,
too.

557
01:28:45,943 --> 01:28:47,178
There you go.

558
01:28:49,814 --> 01:28:51,648
That's a great idea.

559
01:29:11,268 --> 01:29:13,304
Promise you'll take care of her.

560
01:31:58,903 --> 01:32:01,105
No, no.

561
01:32:01,138 --> 01:32:03,741
No! No!

562
01:32:05,176 --> 01:32:09,413
- I'm sorry. Come.
- No!

563
01:32:09,446 --> 01:32:11,916
- Come here. I'm sorry.
- No, no!

564
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:16,453
No. No.

565
01:32:16,987 --> 01:32:18,856
He'll always be with you.

566
01:32:20,157 --> 01:32:22,927
He'll always be with you.

567
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:23,928
Vesper.

568
01:32:25,296 --> 01:32:27,431
He told us to go to your garden,

569
01:32:27,464 --> 01:32:30,868
and then when it's safe
we go south to the Citadel.

570
01:32:30,901 --> 01:32:31,835
OK?

571
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:33,971
Come on.

572
01:32:35,372 --> 01:32:37,007
Come on.

573
01:33:00,030 --> 01:33:01,365
Come on.

574
01:33:05,436 --> 01:33:06,437
Run.

575
01:33:10,074 --> 01:33:11,942
Don't touch the red grass.

576
01:35:46,630 --> 01:35:48,098
I'll go with you.

577
01:36:10,154 --> 01:36:11,455
Hey!

578
01:37:18,255 --> 01:37:20,390
They won't stop until they get
me.

579
01:37:23,494 --> 01:37:24,595
No.

580
01:37:25,128 --> 01:37:26,263
Pap said...

581
01:37:27,264 --> 01:37:29,032
We have to stay together.

582
01:37:29,767 --> 01:37:31,535
You can't just leave me.

583
01:37:35,807 --> 01:37:39,276
Vesper, do you remember
what you said about the seeds?

584
01:37:40,410 --> 01:37:43,781
How just one could change
everything?

585
01:37:43,815 --> 01:37:45,783
- No.
- Vesper.

586
01:37:45,817 --> 01:37:47,719
- You can't do this.
- It's OK.

587
01:37:47,752 --> 01:37:50,320
You're coming with me.

588
01:37:50,354 --> 01:37:54,558
You're going to stay with me,
and that is it!

589
01:37:54,591 --> 01:37:57,094
You have to do what I say.

590
01:37:57,628 --> 01:38:01,666
It's an order, I'm ordering you,
and you will stay with me.

591
01:38:01,699 --> 01:38:04,334
- Vesper...
- OK? Come on. Come on.

592
01:38:04,368 --> 01:38:05,670
You're staying with me.

593
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:09,573
You're going to stay with me,
OK?

594
01:38:09,606 --> 01:38:13,243
You're going to stay with me.
You're not going to leave.

595
01:38:13,277 --> 01:38:14,679
No. No.

596
01:38:15,412 --> 01:38:17,514
- Please.
- Vesper.

597
01:38:17,548 --> 01:38:21,184
- Please don't leave me.
- Shh.

598
01:38:21,853 --> 01:38:23,655
- Please.
- Vesper.

599
01:38:24,521 --> 01:38:26,323
- Please.
- Vesper...

600
01:38:26,356 --> 01:38:27,624
Please.

601
01:38:30,795 --> 01:38:34,097
Please stay with me.

602
01:38:52,516 --> 01:38:54,819
Have beautiful dreams.

602
01:38:55,305 --> 01:39:55,918
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
