You're not one of them
TV journalists, are you?

25
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:20,275
No, I'm an old mate
of Luke's, actually.

26
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:22,745
Bloody tragic.

27
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,793
We gather this morning
in sadness

28
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:43,632
in this time of trouble
and devastating drought.

29
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:49,471
We come to honour the lives
of Karen and Billy...

30
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:51,407
..and Luke.

31
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,910
This is yet another hardship

32
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:58,947
through which our community
must bond together.

33
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,385
We do so with sadness,
but with a sense of promise.

34
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:06,454
As we pray together

35
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:09,358
in the name of the Father
and of the Son

36
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:12,194
and of the Holy Spirit...

37
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:25,941
- Move!
- Come on, come on!

38
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:27,676
- Catch, Gretchen.
- Oh, thanks.

39
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:31,546
This is bloody beautiful.
Hurry up.

40
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:41,290
Jealous?

41
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:42,757
As if, Gretchen.

42
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,526
- Ellie's jealous!
- Oh!

43
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:16,257
You look like shit.

44
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,959
How are you, Gretchen?

45
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:22,430
I still can't believe it.

46
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:27,136
I was wondering
if you'd be here.

47
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:29,504
Yeah, well,
where else would I be?

48
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:34,043
Come on. Barb and Gerry
have booked the hall.

49
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:35,811
Everyone's been
making sandwiches.

50
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:39,848
Hey, Lachie! Gentle!

51
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,584
Yeah,
Luke said you had a kid.

52
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:43,853
Did he?

53
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:51,860
Poor little thing. He's in
the same class as Billy.

54
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:55,330
I don't know how you're meant
to explain to a kid how...

55
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:10,645
Did Luke say anything to you?

56
00:07:10,678 --> 00:07:12,246
No.

57
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,382
You know, I was meant
to give him a call,

58
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:16,552
but, you know,
just never, you know...

59
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:20,822
You don't need to make excuses.
We all feel guilty.

60
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:25,561
I'll just put these over here.

61
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:27,361
We just wanted
to thank you all

62
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:29,230
for coming here today

63
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:34,536
to... to pay your respects
to Karen and to Billy.

64
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:38,973
What's happened
has been a terrible thing,

65
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,744
but we hope that eventually

66
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:46,348
you'll be able to remember Luke
the way he was before.

67
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,583
He was a friend to many of you

68
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:52,420
and he loved that family of his.

69
00:07:52,454 --> 00:07:54,656
Yeah,
till he butchered 'em.

70
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:57,593
Oh, not today.

71
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:02,063
Hey, I came here to drink
for the kid and Karen, alright?

72
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,431
Not celebrate a murderer.

73
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:05,032
- Oh!
- Shut up, Grant.

74
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:07,335
Not now, not fuckin' never.

75
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,119
- Oi!
- Call that running?!

76
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:59,288
- Come on!
- Aaron!

77
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:03,158
Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo! Come on, Luke!

78
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:05,093
Whoo! Hey, Gretchen.

79
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,394
What took you so long?

80
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,062
Ellie.

81
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:56,345
Stay back, Mal.

82
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:59,181
Ellie?

83
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:23,404
This is Charlotte.

84
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:26,307
Oh, she's struggling
with the formula.

85
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:29,110
And she's so restless,
aren't you, darling?

86
00:10:29,144 --> 00:10:31,379
There we are. Oh...

87
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,083
Gerry says I waste water
on the roses.

88
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:39,053
Oh, it's just a bucket
after a shower.

89
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:40,389
They're still hanging on.

90
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,891
- Hey, Gerry.
- Aaron.

91
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:44,559
Sit down.

92
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:53,501
How are you both coping?

93
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,770
Well, thank you for asking.

94
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:57,505
Most people who come here

95
00:10:57,538 --> 00:11:00,909
can't even look us
in the eye, can they, Gerry?

96
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,581
Obviously, Luke didn't do it.

97
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:09,551
He wouldn't, and you know that.

98
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,085
He wouldn't do it to himself

99
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,822
and he certainly wouldn't do it
to that beautiful family.

100
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:17,392
And that's why we've...

101
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:21,263
..we've been wondering
if you would help us.

102
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:25,934
Barb's got a theory.

103
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:29,437
When we let Luke
have the farm,

104
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,572
obviously, we thought
we were helping him.

105
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,945
But over the last couple
of weeks, I've been thinking.

106
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:39,147
You know,
with the drought so bad

107
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:40,481
and everybody's desperate,

108
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:42,451
there's the wheat crop
failing and...

109
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:44,552
Now, if he had to borrow
from someone

110
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:46,822
and... and then
he couldn't pay them back,

111
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:48,757
now, they might have
come to the farm...

112
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:52,193
Barb, if you're worried about
how the investigation ran,

113
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:54,730
um, I could possibly
put you in touch

114
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:56,264
with some people I know
in Melbourne.

115
00:11:56,297 --> 00:12:00,134
No, no.
We... we saw you on the news.

116
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:01,702
- The Pemberley case.
- Right.

117
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:05,606
And we were all following that,
and you got the money back.

118
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,977
And Luke was so proud
that you were his friend.

119
00:12:10,711 --> 00:12:13,548
You'll look at the books
before you head home?

120
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:17,085
Well, legally, I'm not actually
allowed to interfere in an...

121
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:19,121
You look.

122
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:20,788
For Barb's sake.

123
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:23,591
You lied back then, Aaron.

124
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:26,995
Luke lied as well.
I've always known.

125
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:34,735
The day that...
that poor girl drowned, I...

126
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:36,471
..I saw Luke
coming back from the river,

127
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:39,508
nowhere near the field
you boys said you were in.

128
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,277
- We were shooting rabbits.
- Bullshit!

129
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:44,846
I loved my son.

130
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:47,816
But you tell me,

131
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:49,551
if he did this now...

132
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,886
..could he have done it then?

133
00:12:52,986 --> 00:12:54,622
To Ellie?

134
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:03,899
Maybe if...

135
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:08,103
..if either of us had told the
truth back then, then maybe...

136
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,271
I'll take a look
at the books, OK?

137
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,742
But then I'm gone.

138
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,416
Ellie!

139
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,593
Luke...

140
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:36,731
Don't!

141
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:39,600
Luke! Let go of her!

142
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:41,970
What are you doing?
Luke, she can't breathe!

143
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:43,705
Let go!

144
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:46,875
- The fuck is wrong with you?!
- I'm sorry, Ellie!

145
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:01,155
We have a two-night minimum.

146
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,460
Right, I'm just staying
the one night, so...

147
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:09,130
Right.

148
00:14:09,163 --> 00:14:10,731
Thank you.

149
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:15,036
Alright, I've got
full-strength or mid.

150
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:17,204
- Um...
- I'm out of mid.

151
00:14:23,977 --> 00:14:26,581
Oh, you beauty!

152
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:29,750
I'm on a roll!

153
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:36,591
How are you goin'?

154
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:41,730
You haven't changed at all,
have you? Hmm?

155
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,933
'Cause I've been seeing
your face in my dreams for...

156
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:47,702
..fuck knows how long.

157
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:51,339
Isn't that right, Uncle Mal?

158
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,576
- Look who's here.
- Why are you back, Falk?

159
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:57,946
I thought you got the message.

160
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:59,781
You bring the kid with ya?

161
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:02,250
That son of yours,
that bloody son,

162
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:03,884
is he back here as well
with you?

163
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:07,623
Sit down.
He is the son. Just sit down.

164
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:10,658
It's alright.

165
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:15,096
You've gone and upset him now.

166
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:18,800
You see, he thinks you're your
prick of a father.

167
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:23,071
It's OK, Mr Deacon.

168
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:25,639
OK, is it? Just like that, Falk?

169
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:28,376
All OK? Hmm?

170
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:34,216
I never got a chance to say
back in the day, but I'm sorry.

171
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:36,384
I'm sorry for your loss.

172
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:39,386
I'm sorry about Ellie.

173
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:41,589
You fuck off right now.

174
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:45,860
What, do you want me to fuckin'
help you with that, do you?

175
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:49,464
Well, that's the thing, Grant,
about being a public bar.

176
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:51,165
Anyone can drink here

177
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,269
and now that includes
him and you.

178
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,739
Yeah, the problem's
not with him being in the bar.

179
00:15:57,772 --> 00:15:59,941
It's a problem with him
being in Kiewarra at all.

180
00:15:59,974 --> 00:16:04,446
Now, you understand this,
and you tell your boy.

181
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,681
There's nothing here
for you at all

182
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:08,617
other than
a whole load of people

183
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:10,885
who remember what your son...

184
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,523
..did to my daughter.

185
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:49,057
Oh, chill out, Gretch.
I was just muckin' around.

186
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,557
I wasn't gonna bloody drown her.

187
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:52,159
You could have killed her.

188
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:55,396
<i>OK. Alright.
I'm fuckin' sorry!</i>

189
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:57,364
<i>Sorry, Ellie! Sorry!</i>

190
00:16:57,398 --> 00:17:00,569
<i>Far out. Chill the fuck out.</i>

191
00:17:01,402 --> 00:17:03,572
<i>Yeah, alright. Settle. Settle.</i>

192
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:06,206
- Funny?
- Alright.

193
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,741
You think it's funny? Yeah?

194
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,711
- Yes.
- Funny? Really funny.

195
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:10,944
I'm sorry.

196
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:12,279
Idiot.

197
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:17,218
Ellie,
let's get away from this.

198
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:19,421
- Stop it!
- Come on!

199
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,323
It was pretty funny!

200
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:24,558
What's wrong with you?

201
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:04,899
Where is
the dirty fuckin' pig, eh?!

202
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,269
You're fucked! Where are ya?

203
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:10,904
Are you up there, copper?!

204
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,712
Wake up, copper!

205
00:18:18,945 --> 00:18:20,781
Wake up, you stinkin' pig!

206
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:22,484
Oi!

207
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:24,586
What are you doin'
back in our town, boy?!

208
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:26,954
Oi! Wake up!

209
00:18:26,988 --> 00:18:28,856
You're a fuckin' killer!

210
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,191
Fuckin' right!

211
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:31,592
You killed poor little...

212
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:38,633
Fuckin' liar! You're a killer
and a fuckin' liar!

213
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,038
<i>Oh, g'day, it's Aaron.</i>

214
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:48,642
<i>Look, um, I'm gonna need
a little bit more time out here.</i>

215
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:52,246
<i>Uh, the funeral was pretty
devastating, to be honest.</i>

216
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,914
<i>So I'm gonna stay behind</i>

217
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:56,084
<i>and, um, help the family out
with a couple of things.</i>

218
00:18:56,116 --> 00:19:00,422
<i>I'm not sure how long
it'll take, but at least a day.</i>

219
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:04,125
So I will take this
as personal leave.

220
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:06,327
OK. Thank you.

221
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:37,024
G'day.

222
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:38,792
How are you goin'?

223
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:40,161
Can I help you?

224
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:42,329
I'm Aaron Falk.
I'm a friend of the Hadlers.

225
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:45,266
Oh, right. Greg Raco.

226
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:47,035
Local sergeant.

227
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:49,871
Gerry said you'd swing by.

228
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:51,338
AFP, right?

229
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:53,374
Must be something.

230
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:55,210
No, I'm just here
in a personal capacity.

231
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:56,277
Right.

232
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:57,979
Told 'em I'd have
a look at the books.

233
00:19:58,011 --> 00:19:59,947
Yep. Their house now.

234
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,619
- I'll show you.
- Great.

235
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:20,101
Did you find 'em?

236
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:21,769
The bodies?

237
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:23,404
Yeah.

238
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:28,643
Karen was there.

239
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:31,678
It seems she met Luke
at the front door.

240
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:35,115
I don't know. Does your missus
meet you when you come home?

241
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:37,017
I'm not married, mate.

242
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:41,556
Yeah. It's been
bugging me a bit.

243
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:44,826
Where'd you find the boy?

244
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:49,263
Uh...

245
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,672
Just... in here.

246
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:16,257
Uh... I found Charlotte
in through here,

247
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:17,925
if you want to see.

248
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:24,598
- Just, uh...
- This one?

249
00:21:24,632 --> 00:21:26,301
No, the other.

250
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:31,373
Screaming her little lungs out.

251
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,442
Dehydrated herself.

252
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:43,852
It's, uh, eight steps.

253
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,759
He would have still had the
adrenaline going, blood pumping.

254
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:55,629
Eight steps...

255
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:59,334
..to stop and change his mind
and not shoot the baby.

256
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:05,340
Maybe babies don't make
great witnesses.

257
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:07,275
What do you think?

258
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:08,977
Don't know.

259
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,146
You knew him, didn't you?

260
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,283
What do you think?

261
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:19,052
Was this the first time
you were a first responder?

262
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:20,855
Yeah.

263
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:22,423
Did you do the debrief sessions?

264
00:22:23,557 --> 00:22:27,729
Yeah. Down in Ballarat.
I saw the head doc.

265
00:22:30,064 --> 00:22:32,066
Not terribly helpful.

266
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:35,269
You've just got to keep going.
You've got to keep going back.

267
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:37,304
Yeah, no, I know.

268
00:22:38,138 --> 00:22:39,906
Well, thanks for
showing me around, eh?

269
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,277
Yeah, no worries.

270
00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:17,111
That was a nice service.

271
00:23:17,144 --> 00:23:19,381
Oh, what we needed.

272
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:22,115
The tree hasn't got a hope,
of course.

273
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:25,552
God knows what we're supposed
to tell the kids when it dies.

274
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:28,790
There it is.

275
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:31,425
Where she worked.

276
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:36,497
She did the accounts?

277
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:39,966
Yeah. Mainly.

278
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,935
Just two days a week.

279
00:23:43,537 --> 00:23:45,807
Any problems
that you were aware of?

280
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,477
Well, I mean,
it's not, you know...

281
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:52,613
It's nothing I didn't already
tell the other detectives.

282
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:55,982
She made a couple of errors
in the accounts.

283
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:57,752
Nothing serious.

284
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:01,254
But we did speak and she was...

285
00:24:01,288 --> 00:24:03,557
..she was upset
about her husband.

286
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,926
Did she tell you
why she was upset?

287
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:09,262
Pretty vague. You know, money.

288
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:11,865
But everyone here's
worried about money.

289
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:14,568
Uh...

290
00:24:14,602 --> 00:24:19,240
Did she seem at all scared
of him to you? Luke?

291
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:23,278
I mean... I didn't think so.

292
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,480
I suppose I wasn't
listening hard enough.

293
00:24:26,513 --> 00:24:28,716
Clearly, I missed the signs.

294
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:31,820
Yeah, well...

295
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,522
Thanks.

296
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,625
Any time.

297
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:41,962
Listen, um... I don't know.

298
00:24:41,996 --> 00:24:44,832
If you... if you want to do
a careers talk sometime,

299
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:47,000
the kids would love it.

300
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:49,704
We could all use
some inspiration.

301
00:24:51,105 --> 00:24:52,973
- Thanks for your time.
- Yeah, no worries.

302
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:54,642
Cheers.

303
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:01,950
Gretchen.

304
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:05,754
- Hi.
- Hi.

305
00:25:07,086 --> 00:25:08,655
Thought you were a ghost before.

306
00:25:08,689 --> 00:25:10,557
You couldn't wait
to get out of here.

307
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,993
Nah, I just wanted to see
where Karen worked.

308
00:25:13,027 --> 00:25:15,596
Well, here it is. High glamour.

309
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,999
So what was she like?

310
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:19,768
Younger.

311
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:23,738
Nah, she was
a good person, actually.

312
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:26,507
Yeah, the Hadlers
have asked me to hang around.

313
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:28,609
Yeah, course they have.

314
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,813
Barb's never gonna be able
to accept that she,

315
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:35,950
queen of the CWA with
the award-winning lamingtons,

316
00:25:35,982 --> 00:25:37,918
raised a...

317
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:43,456
Hey, remember us in here?

318
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,625
Grade three? Miss Massey?

319
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,797
Yeah.
She took away my recorder.

320
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:52,165
Do you remember grade one,
you pissed on my exercise book?

321
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:53,835
- I did not!
- You did so!

322
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:55,769
They wouldn't let you
go to the toilet,

323
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:57,071
you couldn't hold it in,

324
00:25:57,104 --> 00:25:58,940
and then Luke got up
and joined in too.

325
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:01,008
Ohh!

326
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,976
Solidarity.

327
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:08,649
Hey, if you're hanging around,
you're gonna need to eat.

328
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:11,885
Tonight?

329
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,855
You got another date?

330
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,558
<i>It's just up here.</i>

331
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:28,468
Hi there, rock tree.

332
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:30,704
Tell me your secrets.

333
00:26:30,738 --> 00:26:32,440
It's beautiful.

334
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:36,577
I come up here
to get away from everything.

335
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:39,446
Can you help me with this?

336
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:49,557
- Shit!
- Oh, fuck.

337
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:50,958
Aaron!

338
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:04,739
Would have been lost
in here forever.

339
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:06,473
Here. Here.

340
00:27:08,075 --> 00:27:10,278
It's just that it was my mum's.

341
00:27:11,111 --> 00:27:12,647
Do you miss her?

342
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:15,449
Do you miss yours?

343
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:34,201
Whoa.

344
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:35,802
Oh, I'm sorry.

345
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:43,010
- I'm sorry.
- Stop saying that.

346
00:27:45,112 --> 00:27:46,748
Ellie?

347
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:49,651
Yeah, we're good.

348
00:27:56,323 --> 00:27:57,858
- Hi.
- G'day.

349
00:27:57,891 --> 00:28:00,728
Oh... Did you find something?

350
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,129
No, not yet.
But I was wondering...

351
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:04,798
Tell me, what is it
you were looking for

352
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:07,802
in the shed this morning
when I pulled up?

353
00:28:07,835 --> 00:28:09,504
Ah.

354
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:13,740
It's just, um...

355
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:16,678
..the bullets don't match.

356
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:20,114
Three shots were those.
Remingtons.

357
00:28:20,146 --> 00:28:21,881
They're blue.

358
00:28:21,914 --> 00:28:23,451
But the only ammunition

359
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:25,986
I could find on the whole
property is Winchester.

360
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:27,821
Those shells are bright red.

361
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,326
So I'm still looking, but...

362
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:46,406
Luke and I used
to come fishing out here.

363
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,477
- Right.
- Look at it now.

364
00:28:51,377 --> 00:28:56,317
Detectives say Luke
drove to his house at 4:30,

365
00:28:56,349 --> 00:28:58,385
killed his family...

366
00:28:59,252 --> 00:29:01,990
..then headed here
to kill himself.

367
00:29:02,923 --> 00:29:05,826
Wouldn't be my choice
for a final resting place.

368
00:29:23,477 --> 00:29:26,547
There's three properties
side by side around this lake.

369
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:29,115
Luke's family's,

370
00:29:29,148 --> 00:29:31,618
Mal Deacon and Grant Dow's.

371
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:35,088
Who's running the Murray
property these days?

372
00:29:35,122 --> 00:29:36,691
Uh...

373
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,859
That's, uh, Jamie Sullivan.

374
00:29:39,893 --> 00:29:41,629
Lives with his nan.

375
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:45,432
Yeah, Jamie Sullivan was with
Luke the afternoon he died.

376
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:48,101
Shooting rabbits.

377
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:52,239
Had him come in to the station
a couple of times... What?

378
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:54,442
He said he was shooting rabbits?

379
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:56,743
Yeah. Why?

380
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:29,275
Who's this, then?

381
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:30,478
- G'day.
- Hello.

382
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,011
Just calm down, Gran.
They're cops.

383
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:33,614
But they're not staying.

384
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:36,015
I've just made
some chocolate cake.

385
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:37,585
Would... would you like some?

386
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:40,487
Oh, no. My wife's got me
on a low-sugar diet.

387
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,824
- We'd love some. Thank you.
- Oh.

388
00:30:49,363 --> 00:30:52,266
Any chance we could
get a look at your gun, mate?

389
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:54,501
Yeah, no problem.

390
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:58,605
Are you boys here
about Luke Hadler?

391
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:01,407
Uh, just tying up
some loose ends, yeah.

392
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:03,076
Oh.

393
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:05,312
Poor Barb and Gerry.

394
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,515
Send them my love, will you?

395
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:09,916
I wanted to go
to the funeral, but...

396
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,753
..Jamie doesn't like me driving.

397
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,822
Thanks, mate.

398
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:20,027
What do you use this for?

399
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:23,563
Rabbits. Roos.

400
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:25,598
I keep asking him to shoot me,

401
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:29,437
but he's a sensitive soul,
my grandson.

402
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:32,706
Been having a bit of trouble

403
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:34,607
with the rabbits
getting into the canola,

404
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:38,813
so I asked Luke to come around
and give me a hand.

405
00:31:41,214 --> 00:31:44,114
You supplied the ammo?

406
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:45,819
What sort?

407
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:50,758
Dunno. Um, Winchester,
Remingtons. Whatever's cheap.

408
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:53,494
Why?

409
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:55,596
Did Luke bring any of his own?

410
00:31:56,395 --> 00:31:59,767
My bunnies, my bullets.
That's my way of thinking.

411
00:32:02,402 --> 00:32:04,505
How'd he seem to you that day?

412
00:32:05,305 --> 00:32:07,674
Fine. Same.

413
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:10,076
How long was he here for?

414
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:12,379
Uh, maybe about two beers.

415
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,048
Left about 4:15.

416
00:32:15,082 --> 00:32:17,051
And did you go out after that?

417
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:18,751
No, no, just, um...

418
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:21,088
..stayed here and had
a cup of tea with Gran.

419
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:28,329
Did he say anything
about his family?

420
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:31,932
"Bloody women."

421
00:32:31,964 --> 00:32:33,967
"Bloody women"?

422
00:32:35,836 --> 00:32:37,371
What did he mean?

423
00:32:37,403 --> 00:32:40,874
I asked him how Karen was
and he said,

424
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:44,311
"Bloody women, always
goin' on about somethin'."

425
00:32:45,178 --> 00:32:46,780
And then he shot another rabbit

426
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:50,985
and then he went home
and he shot her and the kid.

427
00:32:55,355 --> 00:32:56,824
- See you.
- Thanks, love.

428
00:32:56,856 --> 00:32:58,692
<i>..the United Nations
Climate Emergency Summit,</i>

429
00:32:58,724 --> 00:33:01,828
<i>where we'll see world leaders
from across the globe...</i>

430
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,636
- Hey, mate.
- G'day.

431
00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:22,516
- G'day.
- G'day.

432
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:25,051
I saw you at the funeral.
You're sticking around?

433
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:27,421
Uh... yeah.

434
00:33:27,453 --> 00:33:29,222
I was just closing up.
Do you want something?

435
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:31,258
No, I'm OK. I just, um...

436
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,493
My dad used to work here
when I was a kid,

437
00:33:33,527 --> 00:33:35,996
so I was just... reminiscing,
you know?

438
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:39,133
- Falk?
- Yeah. Aaron.

439
00:33:39,165 --> 00:33:42,702
- Yeah, Dr Leigh. Chris Leigh.
- Right.

440
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:44,571
So you knew the Hadlers?

441
00:33:44,604 --> 00:33:46,973
Yeah, you know everyone
in this job.

442
00:33:47,007 --> 00:33:48,776
Yeah, sometimes
too well, I bet.

443
00:33:51,577 --> 00:33:56,250
Hey, I was wondering,
with, um... with Luke,

444
00:33:56,282 --> 00:34:00,119
any obvious signs of distress?

445
00:34:00,153 --> 00:34:03,557
With Karen?
Like, bruising or anything?

446
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:05,692
You know I can't tell you that.

447
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:09,596
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

448
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,005
Still here?

449
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:20,273
You're OK if I stay another
night, aren't you, mate?

450
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:21,507
I know occupancy's
probably a huge...

451
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:25,179
Nah, mate, we're overrun.
Inundated. Swamped.

452
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:26,847
Thank you.

453
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,782
Night.

454
00:34:36,523 --> 00:34:38,192
- G'day.
- Hi.

455
00:34:38,224 --> 00:34:39,860
How are you?

456
00:34:39,893 --> 00:34:41,628
Good.

457
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:43,329
That's nice.

458
00:34:43,362 --> 00:34:45,832
Yeah, well, I thought
I should buy local.

459
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:47,400
It suits you.

460
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:49,937
I can see it really working
in one of your alleyway bars,

461
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,337
sipping espresso martinis.

462
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:53,340
I think you've got
the wrong idea about my life.

463
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:54,675
- Do I?
- Mm-hm.

464
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,644
Well, good.

465
00:34:57,811 --> 00:35:00,280
Thank you.

466
00:35:00,313 --> 00:35:02,316
Thank <i>you.</i>

467
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:07,187
Cheers.

468
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:09,789
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

469
00:35:14,027 --> 00:35:16,563
So it won't shock you to learn
that it's all over town

470
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:18,733
that you're reopening
the investigation.

471
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,668
Most are sure
that you, of all people,

472
00:35:22,702 --> 00:35:24,638
should be minding
your own business.

473
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:28,942
Tell me, you...
you're convinced he did it?

474
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:32,480
No shadow of a doubt?

475
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:38,752
Common things
occur commonly, right?

476
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:42,155
I mean, I didn't go to
detective school, but...

477
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,427
- G'day.
- What can I get you?

478
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,195
Oh, can we share the, uh,
fisherman's basket?

479
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:50,630
Yep. Good choice.

480
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:53,233
Ohh. We're a long way
from the ocean.

481
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,536
Oh, shut up. You'll love it.

482
00:35:56,836 --> 00:35:59,273
- Go extra on the yabbies, eh?
- Yeah, that's too easy, mate.

483
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:01,342
Thanks, Kelly.

484
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:10,851
Was he ever violent with you?

485
00:36:10,884 --> 00:36:13,519
Luke? No!

486
00:36:13,552 --> 00:36:15,788
I mean, he was an arsehole
regularly, but...

487
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:18,759
Mmm. You guys gave it a crack?
On and off?

488
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:21,261
Yeah, I mean...

489
00:36:23,195 --> 00:36:26,833
I guess it was a bit raw
after Ellie and...

490
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:29,803
..when you left and...

491
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,806
We just clung to each other.

492
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:35,675
We were just four dumb kids.

493
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,581
What do you think
happened to Ellie?

494
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:44,117
Oh, Aaron. Please, can we just
sit and drink our body weight?

495
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,385
It's just you never said
back then.

496
00:36:46,418 --> 00:36:48,655
You never told me
what you thought.

497
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:51,925
Well, I think
she killed herself,

498
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,927
like I think Luke...

499
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,463
..snapped.

500
00:36:57,597 --> 00:36:58,665
I think...

501
00:36:58,697 --> 00:37:01,868
God, I think she was a kid
who needed support.

502
00:37:04,036 --> 00:37:06,105
I mean...

503
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:08,709
..the stuff that was
going on at home.

504
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:10,143
Like what?

505
00:37:10,175 --> 00:37:12,545
Like how she hated her dad.

506
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:18,217
You know, after her mum left,
people should have... stepped up.

507
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:19,620
But everyone looked away.

508
00:37:19,652 --> 00:37:21,855
I mean, everyone still looks
away. We're very good at it.

509
00:37:21,887 --> 00:37:25,224
So, yeah, I'm sure
they felt guilty about that.

510
00:37:25,257 --> 00:37:27,593
But people don't like
feeling guilty, so...

511
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:30,831
..they find a letter
with your name on it

512
00:37:30,864 --> 00:37:31,898
and, great, job done.

513
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:34,166
They can blame you
for the rest of their lives

514
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,902
'cause it's easier.

515
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:45,112
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hello!

516
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:46,646
What's going on here?

517
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:50,583
You going up for a...
a quickie, are you?

518
00:37:51,384 --> 00:37:53,186
You know, you want
to be careful, Gretch.

519
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:55,688
Birds that hang around with
this fella tend to end up dead.

520
00:37:55,722 --> 00:37:59,226
Aww. Thanks, Grant.
Glad you have my back.

521
00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:01,795
I've got your back,
your front...

522
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:06,967
I gotta say, you are looking
real, real fancy tonight.

523
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:09,903
That dress is beautiful.

524
00:38:10,903 --> 00:38:13,005
Is that for him?

525
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:15,376
Jeez, I hope
you appreciate it, Falk.

526
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:18,845
Can I help you
with something, mate?

527
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:20,447
Now that you asked, you can.

528
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,918
Why don't you fuck off
back to where you come from?

529
00:38:24,717 --> 00:38:27,853
What happened here
has got nothing to do with you.

530
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:29,423
Nothing.

531
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:35,729
See ya, Gretch.
Have a good one.

532
00:38:35,762 --> 00:38:37,565
Come on, Grant.

533
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,570
Fires around Karoonda.

534
00:38:45,204 --> 00:38:48,007
We've been waiting
so long for rain.

535
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:28,248
I should go.

536
00:39:30,817 --> 00:39:32,753
If you say so.

537
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,737
<i>I'm gonna jump one day.</i>

538
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:52,639
Just... jump.

539
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,541
When I'm old as fuck, why not?

540
00:40:27,306 --> 00:40:29,275
Hello?

541
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:36,516
Hello?

542
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:39,853
Barb?

543
00:40:39,885 --> 00:40:41,554
Gerry?

544
00:40:42,554 --> 00:40:43,990
Barb?

545
00:40:45,224 --> 00:40:46,993
Oh, hello, love.

546
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:52,633
No secret is safe from
a good clean-out, is it?

547
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:58,838
Billy was obviously as bad at
spelling as his father!

548
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:08,414
Oh, Aaron.

549
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:11,951
I mean, what am I supposed
to do with all their things?

550
00:41:12,985 --> 00:41:15,922
Can't you just... leave all this
stuff for a little while maybe?

551
00:41:15,954 --> 00:41:19,860
No. Gerry says it's...
it's time we faced it now.

552
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:21,728
Oh!

553
00:41:23,695 --> 00:41:25,731
Oh, my God.
These are library books!

554
00:41:25,764 --> 00:41:28,134
How overdue are
these bloody things?!

555
00:41:28,168 --> 00:41:31,003
I'll take them back.
I can return these.

556
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:32,872
Don't worry. It's OK.

557
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:38,010
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do with the farm?

558
00:41:39,012 --> 00:41:41,315
Why? Have you found something?

559
00:41:42,347 --> 00:41:44,217
Was the farm the motive?

560
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,887
No, probably not.

561
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,722
What about the finances?

562
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:51,458
There's nothing amiss.

563
00:41:52,492 --> 00:41:54,461
But you're still here.

564
00:41:58,063 --> 00:41:59,565
Did you look
at those books?

565
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,001
Yes.

566
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:06,273
Yeah, there was nothing.
I'm sorry.

567
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:11,577
Thought with Luke, we might
have had a bit longer, but...

568
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:15,882
Oh, it's all gonna
be big machines

569
00:42:15,914 --> 00:42:17,884
from now on anyway.

570
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:22,121
Remote-controlled.

571
00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:24,791
GPS.

572
00:42:24,824 --> 00:42:26,894
Farms with no people.

573
00:42:27,994 --> 00:42:29,762
Imagine that.

574
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:32,732
No need for towns.

575
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,836
No need for any of us.

576
00:42:37,135 --> 00:42:40,172
Gonna give me
a hand with that?

577
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:41,974
Yeah, sure.

578
00:44:38,324 --> 00:44:40,594
That was really beautiful.

579
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,932
My mum used to sing it to me,
over and over and over.

580
00:44:46,965 --> 00:44:49,234
Bit sentimental to me.

581
00:44:49,268 --> 00:44:52,005
- I'm gonna go for a piss.
- Cheers.

582
00:44:54,407 --> 00:44:55,809
Oh, fuck!

583
00:44:55,842 --> 00:44:57,077
Luke?

584
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,577
<i>Luke! Luke!</i>

585
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,079
- <i>Luke?</i>
- <i>Luke?! Luke?!</i>

586
00:45:00,112 --> 00:45:03,248
- <i>He's faking it!</i>
- <i>Gretch, just calm down.</i>

587
00:45:03,282 --> 00:45:05,986
You guys
took your time, didn't you?

588
00:45:06,018 --> 00:45:07,319
You're an arsehole.

589
00:45:07,353 --> 00:45:08,989
Fucking dickhead!

590
00:45:15,161 --> 00:45:16,829
Fuck you, Luke!

591
00:45:23,168 --> 00:45:24,536
Really?

592
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,006
What?

593
00:45:27,005 --> 00:45:28,273
You guys make me sick.

594
00:45:28,306 --> 00:45:31,377
The way you two indulge him
is nauseating.

595
00:45:31,411 --> 00:45:33,480
Jesus, Ellie,
what's crawled up your arse?

596
00:45:33,512 --> 00:45:36,115
- Why don't we just go back...
- No, I'm asking as a friend.

597
00:45:36,148 --> 00:45:37,549
- And even Gretch is saying.
- Luke...

598
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:39,652
You don't drink. You don't even
fuckin' laugh anymore.

599
00:45:39,684 --> 00:45:41,587
Luke!

600
00:45:42,855 --> 00:45:44,657
Fine. I'll go.

601
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,596
Fuck... Ellie!

602
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,731
Ellie, I'm sorry. Come back.

603
00:45:52,764 --> 00:45:54,733
Ellie! Ellie...

604
00:46:08,213 --> 00:46:09,748
Hey, Jamie!

605
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:13,586
Come on, Jamie.

606
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:56,863
So, you never met
Karen Hadler?

607
00:46:56,896 --> 00:46:58,364
No.

608
00:46:58,396 --> 00:47:01,201
Then why did she have
a news article about you?

609
00:47:01,233 --> 00:47:02,634
No idea.

610
00:47:02,668 --> 00:47:06,005
That's it.
Now bring it up higher.

611
00:47:06,038 --> 00:47:07,773
A bit higher!

612
00:47:07,806 --> 00:47:10,275
Yeah, that'll do, mate.
Leave it there.

613
00:47:20,552 --> 00:47:22,989
Look who's here. It's the pigs.

614
00:47:24,422 --> 00:47:27,926
Looking for a job,
are you, boys? Eh?

615
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,728
You're out of luck here, right?

616
00:47:29,762 --> 00:47:32,399
There's a no-dickhead
policy, see?

617
00:47:35,534 --> 00:47:37,136
Grant, how would you describe

618
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,039
your relationship
with Karen Hadler?

619
00:47:40,106 --> 00:47:43,910
Masturbatory.

620
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:45,445
You found her attractive?

621
00:47:47,045 --> 00:47:50,682
Yeah, she's alright, I guess,
for 'round here. Yeah.

622
00:47:50,715 --> 00:47:53,519
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

623
00:47:56,054 --> 00:47:58,791
I honestly couldn't tell you.
I don't fucking know.

624
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:01,927
What about a week
before she died?

625
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,330
On February 19?

626
00:48:05,463 --> 00:48:07,599
Do I have to stay for this? Huh?

627
00:48:07,632 --> 00:48:10,369
How is this prick allowed
to question me? What...

628
00:48:10,402 --> 00:48:12,505
And you're just gonna sit there?

629
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:16,442
Perhaps you could tell us...

630
00:48:16,474 --> 00:48:19,278
..why your name, Grant,

631
00:48:19,311 --> 00:48:23,349
was written by Karen Hadler
the week she died.

632
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:33,592
You're not pinning
this fucking thing on me.

633
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:35,195
Pinning what on you, Grant?

634
00:48:35,228 --> 00:48:38,130
Listen, if Luke Hadler wants to
go 'round shooting his family,

635
00:48:38,164 --> 00:48:39,799
that's his fuckin' business.

636
00:48:39,831 --> 00:48:43,469
Right? This has got nothing
to do with me. Nothing.

637
00:48:44,336 --> 00:48:46,472
Where were you
that afternoon, Grant?

638
00:48:46,505 --> 00:48:49,175
It's in the police report.
Read the fuckin' police report.

639
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:50,610
Mmm. I've read it.

640
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:52,878
It says you were working
out on Eastway,

641
00:48:52,911 --> 00:48:55,180
with a couple of the mates
that you've listed there.

642
00:48:55,213 --> 00:48:56,782
Do you stand by that?

643
00:48:58,483 --> 00:49:01,320
Yeah, we were there all day.
We were at the pub after.

644
00:49:03,054 --> 00:49:05,757
Go and ask 'em.
<i>You</i> asked 'em. Go and ask 'em.

645
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:09,829
You work hard, don't you,
on your uncle's farm.

646
00:49:11,429 --> 00:49:13,766
Planning on selling it
after he dies?

647
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:17,570
That's none of your
fuckin' business.

648
00:49:17,603 --> 00:49:19,972
And what about
Luke's farm?

649
00:49:20,773 --> 00:49:22,876
I hear it'll come up for sale
eventually.

650
00:49:23,775 --> 00:49:26,378
You're trying to buy
Jamie Sullivan, aren't you?

651
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:28,914
Three properties side by side.

652
00:49:29,715 --> 00:49:31,317
Yeah, that sounds
a lot more attractive

653
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:32,585
to potential investors, Grant.

654
00:49:32,617 --> 00:49:34,653
- What do you reckon?
- Well...

655
00:49:34,686 --> 00:49:37,723
Fuck you and fuck you,
Falk, alright?

656
00:49:37,757 --> 00:49:38,758
Grant...

657
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:40,927
Don't say my name like
you know me!

658
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,394
You don't fucking know me!

659
00:49:42,427 --> 00:49:45,397
You didn't ever fucking know
me, Falk! You don't know me!

660
00:49:45,431 --> 00:49:47,934
Stop saying my name like that.

661
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:52,438
We're gonna check your
movements on that day.

662
00:49:52,471 --> 00:49:55,141
We're gonna check
everything you've said.

663
00:49:55,173 --> 00:49:56,842
And maybe you've got
a couple of mates

664
00:49:56,876 --> 00:49:58,811
that'll back you up, you know?

665
00:49:58,844 --> 00:50:00,746
But alibis...

666
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,882
..you put them under
enough pressure

667
00:50:02,914 --> 00:50:05,317
and they just crumble real fast.

668
00:50:06,851 --> 00:50:08,954
Like yours. Yeah?

669
00:50:10,523 --> 00:50:12,492
What was the alibi
you and Luke come up with

670
00:50:12,525 --> 00:50:14,327
all the way back then, was it?

671
00:50:15,894 --> 00:50:17,764
Shoot... shooting rabbits?

672
00:50:25,204 --> 00:50:29,108
The CCTV cameras,
I want to look at them.

673
00:50:29,141 --> 00:50:32,478
Dow's lying.
I want to test that alibi.

674
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,947
Yeah, we took 'em all.

675
00:50:35,947 --> 00:50:38,282
Jamie Sullivan too.
He wasn't with his nan.

676
00:50:38,284 --> 00:50:40,387
- He's lying.
- Yeah.

677
00:50:49,094 --> 00:50:50,730
Yeah, there's one
beside the pub,

678
00:50:50,762 --> 00:50:53,632
uh, one over
the pharmacy storeroom,

679
00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:56,001
two covering the service station

680
00:50:56,034 --> 00:50:57,737
and two over the school.

681
00:50:57,769 --> 00:51:00,038
Start there.
Start with the school.

682
00:51:00,072 --> 00:51:01,541
Mm-hm.

683
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:06,378
School. End of the day.

684
00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:12,018
There's Karen Hadler.

685
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:19,425
It's just two hours
before she was...

686
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:21,461
Does she look like
she's struggling?

687
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:23,630
I don't know.

688
00:51:26,532 --> 00:51:30,436
And then
nothing for a while.

689
00:51:30,469 --> 00:51:34,574
One hour. Two hours.

690
00:51:34,606 --> 00:51:37,943
Ah, there's Principal Whitlam.
He knows by now. We called him.

691
00:51:38,943 --> 00:51:40,713
That's it.

692
00:51:41,813 --> 00:51:45,283
Thanks, mate.
That's Luke's car.

693
00:51:45,317 --> 00:51:47,753
We found it out at the dry lake.

694
00:52:02,735 --> 00:52:04,937
Ellie! Can we just talk about
what happened last night?

695
00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:06,405
There's nothing to talk about.

696
00:52:08,673 --> 00:52:10,509
There is.
I just want to help you.

697
00:52:10,543 --> 00:52:12,912
- I don't need your help.
- Fucking bullshit.

698
00:52:29,295 --> 00:52:32,432
Hey, do... do you want
to help me get this home?

699
00:52:34,032 --> 00:52:35,768
I can't.

700
00:52:37,135 --> 00:52:38,438
No worries.

701
00:52:57,822 --> 00:52:59,458
Bye.

702
00:53:17,242 --> 00:53:18,945
Ellie!

703
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:34,726
- You alright?
- Yeah.

704
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:47,606
Oh, Christ.

705
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:54,347
Uh, righto, guys, just
give us a little room, please.

706
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,082
Did anyone see anything?

707
00:53:56,114 --> 00:53:57,883
Nah, nothing.

708
00:53:57,916 --> 00:53:59,284
No-one? Right.

709
00:53:59,318 --> 00:54:01,788
Uh, Jim?
Can you give me a hand...

710
00:54:09,827 --> 00:54:12,398
Yeah, some prick
put a calf...

711
00:54:19,137 --> 00:54:20,338
Basically all over town.

712
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:21,773
Pretty much every
building and fence.

713
00:54:21,806 --> 00:54:24,276
- Here he comes now.
- Oh, this'll be good.

714
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:25,777
Alright, guys, just hang out.

715
00:54:25,811 --> 00:54:27,313
Mate, we'll get them
taken down, alright?

716
00:54:27,346 --> 00:54:29,315
Where is he? Is he in here?

717
00:54:29,347 --> 00:54:30,750
I don't want you in there.

718
00:54:30,782 --> 00:54:33,318
- Let me talk to him.
- Mate, mate, mate, listen.

719
00:54:33,351 --> 00:54:35,754
Come and have a drink
at my place, alright?

720
00:54:35,788 --> 00:54:37,556
We'll clean your car up.

721
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,125
OK?

722
00:54:44,396 --> 00:54:47,233
Hey, Wal, John,
get these down, will you?

723
00:54:47,266 --> 00:54:49,001
- Get 'em down.
- No worries.

724
00:54:56,909 --> 00:54:58,411
Ellie?

725
00:55:02,681 --> 00:55:04,284
Ellie?

726
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:17,028
Mate, nice place.

727
00:55:17,061 --> 00:55:20,967
Oh, yeah.
Suburbia in the country.

728
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,835
Worst of both worlds.

729
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:26,271
- You good?
- That's it. Yep.

730
00:55:41,753 --> 00:55:43,255
Here you go.

731
00:55:43,288 --> 00:55:45,557
Oh, mate, thanks.

732
00:55:46,692 --> 00:55:48,561
- Cheers.
- You too, mate. Thanks.

733
00:55:48,594 --> 00:55:50,429
Hey, thanks for your help
with all that too.

734
00:55:50,461 --> 00:55:52,530
No worries. Happy to help.

735
00:55:52,563 --> 00:55:54,466
Don't know what
I would have done out here

736
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,635
if you hadn't have been saving
your dirty water.

737
00:56:00,405 --> 00:56:03,241
I, uh, thought you might like
to hear her voice.

738
00:56:07,813 --> 00:56:10,182
<i>Hi, Sandra. It's Karen.</i>

739
00:56:10,215 --> 00:56:11,717
<i>I'm so sorry to do this to you,</i>

740
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,653
<i>but I'm afraid Billy can't
come over this afternoon.</i>

741
00:56:15,954 --> 00:56:17,390
<i>He's a bit under the weather.</i>

742
00:56:17,422 --> 00:56:19,758
<i>I think it's better
if he just comes straight home.</i>

743
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:21,226
<i>Is that OK?</i>

744
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,629
<i>Sorry for the late notice,
Sandra.</i>

745
00:56:23,661 --> 00:56:25,597
<i>OK, bye.</i>

746
00:56:27,733 --> 00:56:30,603
Just so you know
she was a real person.

747
00:56:32,137 --> 00:56:33,972
Did you call her back?

748
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:37,208
Honestly... I was annoyed.

749
00:56:37,242 --> 00:56:39,312
We had a plan and, uh...

750
00:56:42,847 --> 00:56:44,884
Love, love.

751
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:49,320
How could you have known
it was gonna turn out like that?

752
00:56:49,353 --> 00:56:51,456
Alright? None of us knew.

753
00:56:52,891 --> 00:56:54,661
I'm sorry. Um...

754
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,563
She was nice.

755
00:56:58,463 --> 00:57:00,732
Welcoming, which...

756
00:57:00,766 --> 00:57:03,969
Can be a bit unusual
around here, right?

757
00:57:05,603 --> 00:57:07,739
Everyone loved her, you know?

758
00:57:08,507 --> 00:57:11,476
And what that animal did
to Karen and her little boy...

759
00:57:13,545 --> 00:57:14,780
Yeah.

760
00:57:14,813 --> 00:57:17,182
Aaron was, uh,
friends with Luke Hadler

761
00:57:17,215 --> 00:57:19,418
when they were kids, so...

762
00:57:21,753 --> 00:57:24,523
Well, maybe he was
different back then.

763
00:57:25,556 --> 00:57:26,925
Can you...

764
00:57:27,726 --> 00:57:30,162
Can you imagine
what Karen and Billy's

765
00:57:30,195 --> 00:57:32,664
last moments
must have been like?

766
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:35,934
Can you?

767
00:57:38,202 --> 00:57:40,373
Yeah, um...

768
00:57:43,007 --> 00:57:44,743
I'm sorry.

769
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:53,119
Can I show you something?

770
00:57:53,152 --> 00:57:54,787
Sure.

771
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,123
I found this.

772
00:57:57,155 --> 00:57:58,523
Oh, wow.

773
00:57:58,556 --> 00:58:02,227
School archives.
You and your old man.

774
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,163
Oh, that's amazing.

775
00:58:04,195 --> 00:58:05,764
Huh.

776
00:58:11,103 --> 00:58:14,307
Um, listen, I...

777
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,943
I'm sorry about Sandy.

778
00:58:20,179 --> 00:58:22,414
She's the reason I took the job.

779
00:58:24,615 --> 00:58:25,985
We got robbed...

780
00:58:27,652 --> 00:58:29,755
..back in Melbourne and, um...

781
00:58:31,155 --> 00:58:33,525
..the girls were out,
thank God, but...

782
00:58:34,326 --> 00:58:36,195
..I was held at knifepoint.

783
00:58:36,228 --> 00:58:37,429
- Jesus!
- Yeah.

784
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:38,963
It was a couple of junkies.

785
00:58:38,996 --> 00:58:41,533
Cleaned out the safe, you know?

786
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:45,336
All of Sandy's jewellery.

787
00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:47,272
What did the cops say?
They find 'em or...

788
00:58:47,306 --> 00:58:49,175
Never got 'em.
Just never got 'em.

789
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,811
And, um... um...

790
00:58:52,911 --> 00:58:54,280
..she's been rattled ever since.

791
00:58:54,313 --> 00:58:56,115
- Of course.
- Yeah.

792
00:58:56,148 --> 00:58:58,251
I think the invasion of it.

793
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:01,553
I don't know.
It just feels like, uh...

794
00:59:03,588 --> 00:59:06,391
It feels like she's drifting
away from me, you know?

795
00:59:10,728 --> 00:59:12,197
Anyway...

796
00:59:12,231 --> 00:59:14,767
- Another beer?
- Yeah, sure.

797
00:59:34,585 --> 00:59:36,588
<i>Hey, mate.
Have you seen Aaron?</i>

798
00:59:37,655 --> 00:59:39,324
<i>No?</i>

799
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:41,327
Do you have any idea
where he went after school?

800
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,262
No. He usually comes
straight home.

801
00:59:43,295 --> 00:59:45,264
Hey, Dad.

802
00:59:46,063 --> 00:59:48,000
Mate, where have you been?

803
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,504
They're saying they found
a body in the river.

804
00:59:53,038 --> 00:59:54,373
A teenager.

805
00:59:58,943 --> 01:00:00,779
I thought it was you.

806
01:00:04,882 --> 01:00:08,152
Aaron. Aaron!

807
01:00:19,697 --> 01:00:22,335
Keep everyone up on the bank!

808
01:00:23,367 --> 01:00:25,304
Stay back, Mal.

809
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:28,440
My girl!

810
01:00:28,472 --> 01:00:31,175
- Ellie?
- My girl!

811
01:01:06,177 --> 01:01:08,947
I slaved over this!

812
01:01:10,849 --> 01:01:12,351
Oh, what I wouldn't give!

813
01:01:12,384 --> 01:01:14,519
I keep saying she can have one.

814
01:01:14,552 --> 01:01:17,455
- Just one. I know.
- How much longer?

815
01:01:17,489 --> 01:01:18,923
Four weeks, fingers crossed.

816
01:01:18,956 --> 01:01:21,527
Yeah, the baby's lying
the wrong way, but she'll turn.

817
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:24,163
She might not. She could
be stubborn like her dad.

818
01:01:24,195 --> 01:01:25,530
Oh, right.

819
01:01:25,563 --> 01:01:27,932
Can you go and put the dessert
in the oven, please?

820
01:01:27,965 --> 01:01:30,134
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.

821
01:01:30,168 --> 01:01:32,403
No sugar for me, thanks, mate.

822
01:01:32,436 --> 01:01:35,139
Have you been bitching
and moaning about the diet?

823
01:01:35,172 --> 01:01:37,175
- No...
- I hope not!

824
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:39,243
He's been having
a packet of Tim Tams

825
01:01:39,277 --> 01:01:40,846
every night of this pregnancy.

826
01:01:40,878 --> 01:01:43,581
He's the one that's gonna get
gestational diabetes.

827
01:01:49,954 --> 01:01:51,389
You've been helpful.

828
01:01:51,422 --> 01:01:53,625
I think he's developed
a bit of a man crush.

829
01:01:55,226 --> 01:01:57,328
Yeah, look, he's doing
really well, you know?

830
01:01:57,362 --> 01:01:59,999
He's very dedicated,
very thorough.

831
01:02:00,032 --> 01:02:01,867
He's also very trusting.

832
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,268
It's odd for the job,

833
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,170
but it's what he's wanted to do
since he was a kid

834
01:02:06,204 --> 01:02:08,374
and so I've supported him.

835
01:02:08,407 --> 01:02:10,509
Yeah, well, you moved
all the way out here.

836
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:11,978
I did.

837
01:02:12,777 --> 01:02:14,545
I think it would be
hideous for someone

838
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:18,250
to take advantage of him
for their own benefit.

839
01:02:20,485 --> 01:02:22,887
So you've heard
some stories about me?

840
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,823
- I've heard some.
- Mmm.

841
01:02:25,856 --> 01:02:27,559
Honestly,

842
01:02:27,592 --> 01:02:30,229
like your husband,
I just want to know

843
01:02:30,262 --> 01:02:32,465
whether or not
Luke Hadler killed his family.

844
01:02:33,697 --> 01:02:35,500
Oh, no!

845
01:02:35,534 --> 01:02:37,236
Is she grilling you?
She does that.

846
01:02:37,268 --> 01:02:38,636
- Nah, nah, nah.
- Yes!

847
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:41,206
Because I don't want you
and some stranger - no offence -

848
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:43,608
to go chasing after,
what is it, a serial killer?

849
01:02:43,641 --> 01:02:45,710
Well, that is actually my job,
is to hunt down...

850
01:02:45,744 --> 01:02:47,813
He hasn't slept
since he found them.

851
01:02:47,846 --> 01:02:49,581
Hey!

852
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:52,284
Not OK.

853
01:02:54,753 --> 01:02:57,990
Look, there's nothing
to worry about, honestly.

854
01:02:58,023 --> 01:03:00,992
- Promise?
- I give you my word.

855
01:03:01,992 --> 01:03:03,528
Good.

856
01:03:14,072 --> 01:03:16,775
Aaron, mate, there's trouble.

857
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:19,110
That note you gave Ellie,
they found it on her.

858
01:03:19,143 --> 01:03:20,578
They think it's you.

859
01:03:20,612 --> 01:03:22,414
You asked her
to meet you at the river?

860
01:03:22,447 --> 01:03:24,583
Yeah, but she never showed up.

861
01:03:24,615 --> 01:03:27,052
Mate, there's no fuckin' way
they're gonna believe you.

862
01:03:27,085 --> 01:03:28,454
- Jesus...
- Aaron, mate?

863
01:03:28,487 --> 01:03:31,123
Aaron, mate, are you listening?
I'll help you.

864
01:03:31,922 --> 01:03:34,692
If anyone asks, you waited
for her, she didn't show up,

865
01:03:34,726 --> 01:03:36,561
so you and me, we went
shooting rabbits together

866
01:03:36,594 --> 01:03:38,329
out in the back paddocks
near the Cooran Road.

867
01:03:38,362 --> 01:03:40,465
We hit... we hit one or two.
Alright?

868
01:03:40,498 --> 01:03:43,801
No, two. Two.
Say two. Alright?

869
01:03:43,835 --> 01:03:45,938
Yeah, OK. Two.

870
01:03:45,971 --> 01:03:48,039
Alright.

871
01:03:48,072 --> 01:03:50,708
Don't forget, we were together.

872
01:03:51,976 --> 01:03:53,645
Go on, say it.

873
01:03:54,445 --> 01:03:55,947
I was with Luke Hadler...

874
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:57,049
Yeah.

875
01:03:57,081 --> 01:03:58,983
- ..shooting rabbits...
- Mm-hm.

876
01:03:59,016 --> 01:04:01,752
..out on the Cooran Road
paddocks.

877
01:04:01,786 --> 01:04:03,556
Right.

878
01:04:06,023 --> 01:04:09,293
Are you sure
you don't know where he was

879
01:04:09,327 --> 01:04:11,397
after school hours?

880
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:16,501
No idea.

881
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:19,972
I was shooting rabbits.

882
01:04:21,005 --> 01:04:22,641
<i>Whereabouts?</i>

883
01:04:22,673 --> 01:04:25,009
<i>The Cooran Road paddocks.</i>

884
01:04:25,043 --> 01:04:26,411
<i>Just on your own or...</i>

885
01:04:26,443 --> 01:04:29,114
No, I was with Luke Hadler.

886
01:04:29,146 --> 01:04:31,150
Just you and Luke, yeah?

887
01:04:31,182 --> 01:04:34,552
Yes. Just me and Luke.

888
01:05:38,483 --> 01:05:40,052
Get off the road,
you idiot!

889
01:05:40,085 --> 01:05:42,721
Yeah!

890
01:05:42,753 --> 01:05:44,389
Whoo!

891
01:05:58,570 --> 01:05:59,871
Come here!

892
01:05:59,903 --> 01:06:01,974
Oof!

893
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:06,945
Get off him!

894
01:06:06,978 --> 01:06:09,548
Calm down! Sit down!

895
01:06:09,581 --> 01:06:11,316
Get your grandmother
to say that...

896
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:12,851
Shut up.
- ..you fuckin' big mouth!

897
01:06:12,884 --> 01:06:15,653
- Keep your mouth shut, OK?
- Fuckin' big mouth!

898
01:06:15,686 --> 01:06:18,757
It's in your interest to keep
your mouth shut, Grant.

899
01:06:21,293 --> 01:06:23,329
Just stay there.

900
01:06:24,762 --> 01:06:26,163
Jesus.

901
01:06:26,197 --> 01:06:28,000
Hey, you right?

902
01:06:32,137 --> 01:06:34,072
Wrong place, wrong time.

903
01:06:34,105 --> 01:06:35,606
What the hell happened here?

904
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:37,442
Our friend Dow
seems to think

905
01:06:37,474 --> 01:06:40,778
the only reason he's
in the frame for the Hadlers

906
01:06:40,811 --> 01:06:42,647
is 'cause Jamie Sullivan's
been spreading word

907
01:06:42,681 --> 01:06:44,383
that he wants to buy
the property.

908
01:06:51,356 --> 01:06:52,958
If we're bothering you, Grant,

909
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,893
all you have to do
is explain to me

910
01:06:54,925 --> 01:06:57,962
why Karen Hadler wrote
your name on a piece of paper

911
01:06:57,996 --> 01:07:00,365
a week before she was murdered.

912
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:02,735
How the fuck should I know?

913
01:07:04,068 --> 01:07:05,570
Give me your keys.

914
01:07:05,603 --> 01:07:07,905
- House is five kays away.
- Be good for your cardio.

915
01:07:11,842 --> 01:07:13,611
Fuckwit.

916
01:07:15,179 --> 01:07:17,915
You, come with me.

917
01:07:17,949 --> 01:07:19,651
Why don't you all go home?!

918
01:07:20,751 --> 01:07:22,186
- Righto!
- Piss off, ya dickhead!

919
01:07:22,219 --> 01:07:24,289
Alright, enough! Oi!

920
01:07:38,202 --> 01:07:39,971
Jesus Christ.

921
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:43,909
- Fun night?
- Yep.

922
01:08:02,927 --> 01:08:04,663
All good.

923
01:08:07,831 --> 01:08:10,268
Doc, can I talk to you
out here for a second?

924
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,804
You stay right there.

925
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:22,314
We have Jamie on camera
driving past here

926
01:08:22,346 --> 01:08:24,382
the day the Hadlers
were murdered.

927
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:28,420
He lied to us.
He told us he was at home.

928
01:08:28,453 --> 01:08:31,556
So this is your one chance
to tell us the truth.

929
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:36,427
Look, I wanted to say
something straightaway.

930
01:08:36,461 --> 01:08:38,664
See, Jamie's a bloody idiot.

931
01:08:39,863 --> 01:08:41,500
I told him he had...

932
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,636
I guess he panicked.

933
01:08:44,668 --> 01:08:46,270
He was here?

934
01:08:47,604 --> 01:08:50,207
The day the Hadlers
were murdered,

935
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,644
I had open surgery till 4pm.

936
01:08:52,676 --> 01:08:56,614
He sent me a message,
I told him to come over...

937
01:08:57,515 --> 01:08:59,751
The usual arrangement.

938
01:08:59,783 --> 01:09:03,254
He arrived, we chatted,
had a cold drink...

939
01:09:04,055 --> 01:09:05,691
..and went to bed.

940
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,364
Mate.

941
01:09:13,398 --> 01:09:16,501
Interfering in an investigation?
Lying to an officer?

942
01:09:16,533 --> 01:09:18,836
Like I care who
you sleep with, mate.

943
01:09:19,636 --> 01:09:22,875
We needed the truth and
you wasted our fucking time.

944
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:25,710
You...

945
01:09:25,743 --> 01:09:29,147
You think you're gonna get
the truth in a town like this?

946
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,283
I'm sorry?

947
01:09:32,684 --> 01:09:37,689
When you've been lying about
something for... for so long...

948
01:09:38,957 --> 01:09:41,260
..it becomes second nature.

949
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:48,099
Falk, you killer!

950
01:09:52,569 --> 01:09:54,840
Stay there!

951
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:20,332
Dad.

952
01:10:20,364 --> 01:10:22,733
Look, let me just stay
for the funeral.

953
01:10:28,105 --> 01:10:29,707
You're leaving?

954
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,676
We have to bury her.

955
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:36,615
I'll come back.

956
01:10:37,782 --> 01:10:39,451
You promise?

957
01:10:49,159 --> 01:10:50,863
Tell Luke goodbye.

958
01:12:04,402 --> 01:12:06,805
Hey, don't you touch,
you mongrel!

959
01:12:06,837 --> 01:12:09,006
I come here every week
to keep that clean.

960
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:10,675
You keep your hands off her.

961
01:12:10,707 --> 01:12:12,978
It's alright, mate.
I was leaving anyway.

962
01:12:14,112 --> 01:12:16,146
Hey. Hey!

963
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:17,783
You're...

964
01:12:18,582 --> 01:12:20,818
You're the kid, aren't you?

965
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,958
The Falk kid. Not the dad.

966
01:12:27,091 --> 01:12:28,727
Yeah, I'm the kid.

967
01:12:31,229 --> 01:12:34,132
You know he begged me, your dad?

968
01:12:34,164 --> 01:12:37,135
He wanted me to tell
everybody in the town

969
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:40,404
to back off until
the police had finished.

970
01:12:41,204 --> 01:12:43,942
As if I'd give him
the steam off my piss!

971
01:12:43,975 --> 01:12:46,645
Must be a dreadful thing,

972
01:12:46,677 --> 01:12:50,247
to have your old man
think so little of ya.

973
01:12:51,649 --> 01:12:55,720
He might have been a coward,
your dad, but he wasn't stupid.

974
01:12:55,752 --> 01:12:57,488
He wouldn't have
fallen for that story

975
01:12:57,521 --> 01:12:59,925
you and the Hadler kid
cooked up!

976
01:13:01,292 --> 01:13:03,028
Why is it you've always
been convinced

977
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:04,528
that Luke and I
weren't together?

978
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:08,567
Hey? What do you know, Mal?

979
01:13:10,001 --> 01:13:12,704
I know I loved my daughter.

980
01:13:43,533 --> 01:13:45,002
Dad...

981
01:13:46,804 --> 01:13:48,407
Stay in the car.

982
01:13:49,172 --> 01:13:50,708
Why have you stopped?

983
01:13:51,509 --> 01:13:53,177
- Should have kept going!
- You won.

984
01:13:53,211 --> 01:13:55,012
- We're going!
- Good! Good!

985
01:13:55,046 --> 01:13:56,414
There's no need for you to stop.

986
01:13:56,447 --> 01:13:58,615
You just keep on the bloody
road until you disappear.

987
01:13:58,649 --> 01:14:00,585
- Everything you've done to us...
- Yeah?

988
01:14:00,618 --> 01:14:02,454
My boy had nothing
to do with it!

989
01:14:02,487 --> 01:14:04,588
- You don't know that.
- They were friends!

990
01:14:04,622 --> 01:14:06,691
- I don't bloody care.
- This was our home!

991
01:14:06,724 --> 01:14:08,226
- Don't you dare come back!
- Fuck you!

992
01:14:08,259 --> 01:14:09,895
I'll fuckin' lay into ya!

993
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:37,389
I'm going to ask one time...
and never again.

994
01:14:38,189 --> 01:14:40,559
So you tell me the truth.

995
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:44,996
Did you have anything
to do with that girl's death?

996
01:14:46,063 --> 01:14:47,733
No.

997
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,470
No, Dad. Jesus!

998
01:14:53,371 --> 01:14:55,574
I can't believe
you're even asking me that.

999
01:15:02,913 --> 01:15:04,849
Were you really with Luke?

1000
01:15:07,318 --> 01:15:08,987
Look at me.

1001
01:15:10,387 --> 01:15:12,524
Were you really with Luke?

1002
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:16,360
Yes.

1003
01:16:05,408 --> 01:16:07,377
- Heya.
- G'day.

1004
01:16:07,411 --> 01:16:08,746
What are you doing out here?

1005
01:16:08,779 --> 01:16:11,749
Oh, just felt like seeing
a friendly face.

1006
01:16:11,782 --> 01:16:13,885
Very nice bit of land
you got out here.

1007
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:15,987
Very impressive.

1008
01:16:17,188 --> 01:16:18,690
Mmm. Thanks.

1009
01:16:18,722 --> 01:16:20,658
You should see it
after it rains.

1010
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:24,062
Just gonna have to get
a few more of these

1011
01:16:24,095 --> 01:16:26,364
before I call it a day,
if that's OK.

1012
01:16:26,396 --> 01:16:27,966
Do you need anything
for your ears?

1013
01:16:27,998 --> 01:16:29,733
Nah, I'm right.

1014
01:16:29,766 --> 01:16:30,868
OK.

1015
01:16:30,902 --> 01:16:33,337
The warren's over there.
Point when you see one.

1016
01:16:35,338 --> 01:16:36,975
There's one.

1017
01:16:43,648 --> 01:16:45,417
You want a go?

1018
01:16:48,051 --> 01:16:49,453
Yeah, sure.

1019
01:16:49,487 --> 01:16:52,222
Do you need a lesson,
federal policeman?

1020
01:16:52,256 --> 01:16:54,259
Nah, I think I'm alright.

1021
01:17:05,603 --> 01:17:07,572
What's wrong? It's right there.

1022
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:22,286
Fair enough.

1023
01:17:23,087 --> 01:17:26,457
You know I'm gonna have to
shoot it anyway, don't you?

1024
01:17:26,489 --> 01:17:28,559
Can't have 'em on my land.

1025
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:37,768
Lachie?

1026
01:17:37,801 --> 01:17:39,503
Yeah, Mum! Nearly ready.

1027
01:17:39,537 --> 01:17:42,407
- Try and ignore the mess.
- Oh, you should see my place.

1028
01:17:43,173 --> 01:17:44,609
What's all this?

1029
01:17:44,641 --> 01:17:47,278
They're applications
to get funding for the school.

1030
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:49,280
It's a nightmare.

1031
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,283
- Is that Karen's handwriting?
- Yeah.

1032
01:17:53,317 --> 01:17:56,320
I try to do my best,
but it's not really my thing.

1033
01:17:56,354 --> 01:17:57,889
It's this Crossley Trust grant.

1034
01:17:57,921 --> 01:18:00,090
See if we can get further
than last year's shortlist.

1035
01:18:00,123 --> 01:18:01,992
- You've taken it on?
- Yeah.

1036
01:18:02,025 --> 01:18:04,662
The application's
doing my head in.

1037
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:08,498
Hey, strange question...

1038
01:18:08,532 --> 01:18:10,301
..but did Karen ever mention me?

1039
01:18:11,902 --> 01:18:14,771
No. No, I don't think so. Why?

1040
01:18:14,805 --> 01:18:17,642
Oh, I'm just wondering if my
name ever came up. That's all.

1041
01:18:17,675 --> 01:18:21,479
Is that why you came to see me?
To ask me about Karen?

1042
01:18:24,849 --> 01:18:27,652
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come back! Come back!

1043
01:18:28,918 --> 01:18:30,220
Hug!

1044
01:18:30,253 --> 01:18:32,090
Alright?

1045
01:18:32,122 --> 01:18:33,557
I want you to meet someone.

1046
01:18:33,591 --> 01:18:36,694
This is my oldest friend
in the world. This is Aaron.

1047
01:18:36,726 --> 01:18:37,961
- G'day.
- Hello.

1048
01:18:37,994 --> 01:18:39,130
- How are you?
- Good.

1049
01:18:39,162 --> 01:18:40,897
Good stuff.

1050
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:43,634
Alright. You be good, please.

1051
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:45,103
I will!

1052
01:18:45,136 --> 01:18:47,538
- Love you!
- See ya!

1053
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:49,539
Thanks, Andrea.

1054
01:18:53,644 --> 01:18:55,445
Sleepover.

1055
01:18:55,479 --> 01:18:57,682
Perfect timing, for once.

1056
01:18:59,949 --> 01:19:03,253
So will you
stay on till it's solved?

1057
01:19:07,158 --> 01:19:09,027
Why are you still here?

1058
01:19:13,863 --> 01:19:15,632
OK, then.

1059
01:19:16,867 --> 01:19:18,469
Professional habit.

1060
01:19:18,502 --> 01:19:20,739
Nah, you were always quiet.

1061
01:19:21,738 --> 01:19:24,608
But then you always
saw everything.

1062
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:29,279
Oh, my God.
I've just remembered something.

1063
01:19:29,313 --> 01:19:31,282
Come. Come and have
a look at this.

1064
01:19:34,952 --> 01:19:38,256
- Oh, no!
- Yes!

1065
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:41,925
Oh, here we go.

1066
01:19:43,894 --> 01:19:45,663
Mmm.

1067
01:19:46,564 --> 01:19:48,733
What have we got in here?

1068
01:19:50,067 --> 01:19:53,037
- Oh, wow.
- Mmm.

1069
01:19:54,939 --> 01:19:57,609
Gymnastics award. Look out!

1070
01:19:59,476 --> 01:20:01,679
Oh. Look at Ellie.

1071
01:20:55,466 --> 01:20:58,903
- Leave it.
- Oh, no, I can't.

1072
01:20:58,935 --> 01:21:01,005
I can't. It might be Lachie.

1073
01:21:05,376 --> 01:21:08,179
Oh, it is. Hang on.

1074
01:21:08,212 --> 01:21:09,981
Sorry. I'll be back.

1075
01:21:10,014 --> 01:21:13,818
Hey, Andrea.

1076
01:21:16,921 --> 01:21:18,722
Is everything alright?

1077
01:21:22,993 --> 01:21:24,562
Alright.

1078
01:21:25,395 --> 01:21:27,631
Do you want to put him on?

1079
01:21:27,664 --> 01:21:29,333
Yeah.

1080
01:21:31,534 --> 01:21:34,439
Hey, mate! Are you alright?

1081
01:21:35,838 --> 01:21:37,742
Oh, OK.

1082
01:21:37,774 --> 01:21:39,743
Poor thing.

1083
01:21:39,777 --> 01:21:43,847
Alright. Well, why don't you
see how you feel after tea?

1084
01:21:45,582 --> 01:21:47,251
OK.

1085
01:21:48,284 --> 01:21:50,454
Alright. Love you.

1086
01:21:51,822 --> 01:21:54,259
Thanks, Andrea. Thank you.

1087
01:21:55,859 --> 01:21:58,196
Yeah, no worries. Alright.

1088
01:21:58,229 --> 01:22:00,999
Thanks for calling. Bye.

1089
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:10,007
Aw! He's feeling a bit homesick.

1090
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:14,712
Do Gerry and Barb know?

1091
01:22:16,145 --> 01:22:18,782
Know... what?
There's nothing to know.

1092
01:22:21,918 --> 01:22:23,755
Did Karen?

1093
01:22:25,055 --> 01:22:27,258
What? No...

1094
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:29,293
I told you,
Lachie's dad's not around.

1095
01:22:29,326 --> 01:22:31,328
Luke is an old friend.

1096
01:22:31,362 --> 01:22:36,533
He came to visit and hang out
with Lachie now and then.

1097
01:22:38,234 --> 01:22:40,505
Luke is not Lachie's father.

1098
01:22:41,572 --> 01:22:42,940
OK.

1099
01:22:42,972 --> 01:22:44,708
What's the birth
certificate say?

1100
01:22:44,742 --> 01:22:46,476
What?

1101
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:52,682
It's blank.

1102
01:22:52,716 --> 01:22:55,720
Not that that's
any of your business.

1103
01:22:58,087 --> 01:22:59,657
What?

1104
01:23:07,163 --> 01:23:12,302
Have you got a...
photo of Lachie's dad?

1105
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:17,075
Is there one... one photo
you could show me?

1106
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:21,712
God, it was a two-night stand.
We didn't get a fucking selfie.

1107
01:23:24,014 --> 01:23:25,617
Why would I lie?

1108
01:23:27,184 --> 01:23:28,920
'Cause Luke asked you to.

1109
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,956
What are you even asking me?

1110
01:23:40,898 --> 01:23:42,766
I have to ask.

1111
01:23:44,033 --> 01:23:45,802
Well, then ask.

1112
01:23:47,136 --> 01:23:48,773
Ask!

1113
01:23:50,573 --> 01:23:52,542
Three people were killed.

1114
01:23:52,576 --> 01:23:54,244
So I hope, for Lachie's sake,

1115
01:23:54,278 --> 01:23:56,414
that you lying about
your relationship with Luke

1116
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:58,682
is the worst thing
you've done to that family.

1117
01:24:07,725 --> 01:24:09,460
Uh...

1118
01:24:11,494 --> 01:24:12,896
Get out.

1119
01:24:16,432 --> 01:24:18,336
Get out of my house.

1120
01:24:22,573 --> 01:24:25,310
- Hey...
- No, get the fuck out.

1121
01:24:57,673 --> 01:24:59,176
Sandra.

1122
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:00,944
Are you OK?

1123
01:25:00,978 --> 01:25:02,579
Oh.

1124
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:05,849
Just, uh, looking for Scott.

1125
01:25:06,649 --> 01:25:09,420
He said he might
pop in for a drink.

1126
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:12,722
It's pretty late.
He's probably on his way home.

1127
01:25:12,756 --> 01:25:15,393
Yeah, he probably is.

1128
01:25:16,627 --> 01:25:19,797
I... I think it's all getting
a bit much for him.

1129
01:25:19,829 --> 01:25:21,565
Sandra?

1130
01:25:23,233 --> 01:25:25,235
Are you alright?
Is everything OK?

1131
01:25:26,036 --> 01:25:30,608
Sometimes I, uh... I think I see
people outside the house.

1132
01:25:31,574 --> 01:25:32,876
Watching us.

1133
01:25:32,909 --> 01:25:37,280
My imagination.
Um, I... I get nervous.

1134
01:25:37,314 --> 01:25:38,783
Why are they watching you?

1135
01:25:38,815 --> 01:25:41,418
Well, in Melbourne,
there, um... there was a...

1136
01:25:41,452 --> 01:25:43,020
There you are, love.

1137
01:25:44,054 --> 01:25:45,890
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

1138
01:25:45,922 --> 01:25:47,490
You OK?

1139
01:25:47,524 --> 01:25:48,893
I just thought
you were here. That's all.

1140
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:52,530
OK. Well, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1141
01:25:53,564 --> 01:25:55,733
Come on. Let's go home.

1142
01:25:58,702 --> 01:26:00,938
- Night.
- Thanks, mate.

1143
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:09,913
Is Whitlam here
every night, mate?

1144
01:26:09,947 --> 01:26:11,782
Yeah.

1145
01:26:11,814 --> 01:26:13,416
It's hard to figure out

1146
01:26:13,449 --> 01:26:15,685
whether I should kick him out
early for his own good

1147
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:19,390
or give him free drinks so
he dumps more into the pokies.

1148
01:26:21,358 --> 01:26:23,795
I assume you're staying
another night?

1149
01:26:24,595 --> 01:26:27,097
Yes, I am.

1150
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:28,865
Ah.

1151
01:26:28,899 --> 01:26:30,935
The black hole of Kiewarra.

1152
01:26:43,747 --> 01:26:45,149
Jesus, mate!

1153
01:26:45,181 --> 01:26:47,318
Mal Deacon's been
down at the station.

1154
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:49,052
Claims you assaulted him.

1155
01:26:49,086 --> 01:26:50,454
Does he?

1156
01:26:50,487 --> 01:26:54,123
Old man grieving
by his daughter's grave.

1157
01:26:54,157 --> 01:26:58,162
- He's lying. I'll sort it.
- No, you won't.

1158
01:26:58,194 --> 01:26:59,796
Word's out up the tree

1159
01:26:59,829 --> 01:27:02,198
there's an off-duty detective
looking into a case,

1160
01:27:02,231 --> 01:27:04,033
that's meant to be solved,
by the way!

1161
01:27:04,067 --> 01:27:05,435
Hey, calm down.

1162
01:27:05,469 --> 01:27:08,005
A detective who also has
personal history

1163
01:27:08,037 --> 01:27:10,006
with the death of Ellie Deacon.

1164
01:27:12,576 --> 01:27:14,712
I never lied about that fact.

1165
01:27:14,744 --> 01:27:16,514
I haven't wanted to ask.

1166
01:27:17,713 --> 01:27:20,350
So? What is this?

1167
01:27:20,384 --> 01:27:22,152
Is this a revenge trip?

1168
01:27:22,185 --> 01:27:25,489
'Cause, mate, you're obsessed
with Mal Deacon, Grant Dow.

1169
01:27:25,521 --> 01:27:27,457
There's more going on
in this town

1170
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:29,726
than a girl who died in a river
20 years ago.

1171
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:32,829
There's a connection
between the two deaths.

1172
01:27:32,863 --> 01:27:34,231
Well, I need a suspect.

1173
01:27:34,264 --> 01:27:36,467
I'm working on it.

1174
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:40,704
I can't do my job
if the locals don't trust me.

1175
01:27:43,539 --> 01:27:45,743
I just need
a little bit more time.

1176
01:27:45,775 --> 01:27:47,478
No. We're nowhere.

1177
01:27:48,444 --> 01:27:51,347
Allowing you
a backstage pass was...

1178
01:27:51,381 --> 01:27:53,651
..stupid rookie shit.

1179
01:27:55,018 --> 01:27:56,887
You gotta go home now, alright?

1180
01:28:01,057 --> 01:28:03,627
I can handle this on my own.

1181
01:28:36,693 --> 01:28:38,762
ARRGGGGHH!

1182
01:31:49,452 --> 01:31:51,387
Hi, Rita. Is he here?

1183
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:53,356
Did you find my...?

1184
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:55,125
What are you doing here?

1185
01:31:55,158 --> 01:31:58,896
Karen's note.
Mate, it's not a name.

1186
01:31:58,929 --> 01:32:01,832
It's a grant. As in, funding.

1187
01:32:04,835 --> 01:32:06,770
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

1188
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:15,646
Karen was concerned
about a grant for the school.

1189
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:18,114
She wasn't scared of Grant Dow.

1190
01:32:18,148 --> 01:32:19,516
Or her husband.

1191
01:32:19,548 --> 01:32:21,851
She found something,
she told Luke,

1192
01:32:21,885 --> 01:32:23,119
Luke showed her this article,

1193
01:32:23,153 --> 01:32:25,155
and she was gonna call me
and ask for help.

1194
01:32:25,188 --> 01:32:26,556
Yeah, but what did she find?

1195
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:28,091
I'm pretty sure Scott Whitlam's

1196
01:32:28,123 --> 01:32:29,827
got a gambling problem, pokies.

1197
01:32:29,859 --> 01:32:33,197
She made a query on this one
and only this one.

1198
01:32:33,229 --> 01:32:35,998
I think she probably
confronted him about it.

1199
01:32:36,032 --> 01:32:38,101
But the CCTV footage...

1200
01:32:38,134 --> 01:32:41,038
He was there at the school
while the murders took place.

1201
01:32:41,938 --> 01:32:44,675
When was the last time
you saw him drive his car?

1202
01:32:45,442 --> 01:32:48,712
He's always riding
his bloody bike!

1203
01:32:51,614 --> 01:32:53,449
<i>Our records are very clear.</i>

1204
01:32:53,483 --> 01:32:55,085
<i>We approved the grant</i>

1205
01:32:55,118 --> 01:32:58,488
<i>and transferred $70,000
into an account two months ago.</i>

1206
01:32:58,520 --> 01:32:59,523
Jesus.

1207
01:32:59,555 --> 01:33:01,557
You're absolutely sure
that it was transferred?

1208
01:33:01,591 --> 01:33:03,327
<i>We're absolutely sure.</i>

1209
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:05,795
<i>What are we doing about
getting this money back?!</i>

1210
01:33:05,828 --> 01:33:08,765
Thanks, Helen. Leave it with us.
We're on it at this end.

1211
01:33:09,865 --> 01:33:12,069
70 grand and three dead.

1212
01:33:12,101 --> 01:33:13,470
Jesus!

1213
01:33:43,332 --> 01:33:45,034
Oh, you're here.

1214
01:33:46,036 --> 01:33:47,570
That was Helen,

1215
01:33:47,604 --> 01:33:49,405
from the Crossley
Educational Trust.

1216
01:33:49,439 --> 01:33:52,843
Could you give her a call back?
She said it's urgent.

1217
01:34:00,817 --> 01:34:02,886
Left my laptop at home.

1218
01:34:02,918 --> 01:34:04,555
No worries.

1219
01:34:21,604 --> 01:34:23,640
Alright. Well done.

1220
01:34:46,563 --> 01:34:49,466
- Scott. Where is he?
- He had to pop out for a bit.

1221
01:34:50,265 --> 01:34:52,268
Is his daughter still in class?

1222
01:34:54,671 --> 01:34:57,708
- Where is she?
- There, in the third row.

1223
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:01,311
Would he leave town
without his child?

1224
01:35:05,849 --> 01:35:07,618
Go, go, go, go!

1225
01:35:18,994 --> 01:35:20,631
Clear.

1226
01:35:25,835 --> 01:35:28,238
Shit. Remingtons.

1227
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:29,907
Forest.

1228
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:25,029
I wouldn't.

1229
01:36:26,796 --> 01:36:28,265
Hey, Scott.

1230
01:36:28,297 --> 01:36:30,567
What are you... what are you
doing out here, mate?

1231
01:36:31,868 --> 01:36:33,504
You OK?

1232
01:36:47,015 --> 01:36:48,918
Best you stay back.

1233
01:36:50,252 --> 01:36:52,255
You do realise that
if that hits the ground,

1234
01:36:52,287 --> 01:36:54,156
this whole forest
will catch fire?

1235
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:57,827
Hey! Put your fucking gun away!

1236
01:36:57,860 --> 01:36:59,729
- Cop!
- Do it.

1237
01:37:04,868 --> 01:37:06,503
Whatever you've done...

1238
01:37:07,337 --> 01:37:09,339
..you don't want to do this.

1239
01:37:09,372 --> 01:37:11,541
This whole place
is dry as a tinder.

1240
01:37:11,573 --> 01:37:13,210
It's just waiting to burn.

1241
01:37:13,243 --> 01:37:15,078
I'll drop it, mate. I will.

1242
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:17,314
The school is close by.

1243
01:37:17,346 --> 01:37:20,783
You've got kids in there,
including your daughter, OK?

1244
01:37:20,817 --> 01:37:22,485
They'll all burn to death.

1245
01:37:22,519 --> 01:37:26,423
Look, I know
you love your family, hey?

1246
01:37:26,456 --> 01:37:28,324
I've seen you with them.

1247
01:37:29,158 --> 01:37:31,761
This whole thing
was for my family.

1248
01:37:33,363 --> 01:37:35,966
I brought them up here
to protect them!

1249
01:37:35,998 --> 01:37:40,436
They found me anyway,
came for the money I owed.

1250
01:37:46,909 --> 01:37:49,378
They made me hold the nail gun

1251
01:37:49,412 --> 01:37:52,182
they were gonna pin my daughter
to the wall with!

1252
01:37:52,215 --> 01:37:54,685
The carving knife...

1253
01:37:56,219 --> 01:37:58,588
..they were gonna slit
her throat with.

1254
01:38:00,222 --> 01:38:01,725
I had no choice!

1255
01:38:01,757 --> 01:38:05,761
You needed the money,
huh? For your family.

1256
01:38:09,966 --> 01:38:12,569
Everyone will understand.

1257
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:22,278
Tell my wife
I never meant to hurt the boy.

1258
01:38:33,122 --> 01:38:34,458
Go!

1259
01:42:06,536 --> 01:42:09,139
They say you saved the town.

1260
01:42:09,171 --> 01:42:11,774
Stopped the school from burning.

1261
01:42:11,807 --> 01:42:15,278
And you put him out
with your bare hands.

1262
01:42:23,618 --> 01:42:25,354
He'll be OK.

1263
01:42:26,721 --> 01:42:28,425
I know he will.

1264
01:42:30,827 --> 01:42:32,628
What about Scott Whitlam?

1265
01:42:34,896 --> 01:42:37,266
Unrecognisable.

1266
01:42:39,167 --> 01:42:41,470
They've transferred him
to Melbourne.

1267
01:42:43,738 --> 01:42:45,608
He'll live.

1268
01:42:47,944 --> 01:42:49,679
Aaron!

1269
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:53,817
We've been waiting
for you to wake up.

1270
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:56,019
We're not the only ones.

1271
01:42:56,051 --> 01:42:58,822
I think word's
got out in the town.

1272
01:43:02,992 --> 01:43:05,829
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

1273
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:15,305
Your old man would be
so bloody proud of you.

1274
01:43:16,605 --> 01:43:19,041
He always knew the man you were.

1275
01:43:35,323 --> 01:43:36,926
Cheers, mate.

1276
01:43:37,726 --> 01:43:39,261
Will you go on
the old TripAdvisor

1277
01:43:39,295 --> 01:43:41,331
and leave me a good review?

1278
01:43:41,363 --> 01:43:43,332
Five stars
all the way, mate.

1279
01:43:43,365 --> 01:43:45,435
Good man.

1280
01:43:51,073 --> 01:43:52,709
- Hey.
- G'day.

1281
01:43:54,010 --> 01:43:55,579
I, uh...

1282
01:43:56,378 --> 01:43:58,582
..wanted to come
to the hospital, but I was...

1283
01:43:59,782 --> 01:44:01,418
..too angry.

1284
01:44:03,519 --> 01:44:06,256
Well, I probably shouldn't have
accused you of murder.

1285
01:44:06,288 --> 01:44:08,757
- Oh...
- Bit of a mood-kill.

1286
01:44:08,791 --> 01:44:13,296
I don't know. I wanted to...
kill him a bunch of times.

1287
01:44:14,363 --> 01:44:17,400
You know, he loved Karen.

1288
01:44:18,734 --> 01:44:22,872
I was never his first choice,
which was...

1289
01:44:22,904 --> 01:44:24,740
Which was his loss.

1290
01:44:32,614 --> 01:44:36,286
Hey, there's something I need
to tell you before you go,

1291
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:39,389
that I've wanted to tell you
for years, right?

1292
01:44:41,122 --> 01:44:42,858
'Cause I saw her.

1293
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:45,862
Heading to the river.

1294
01:44:45,895 --> 01:44:50,066
And if I'd gone to her,
I could have stopped it, but...

1295
01:44:50,099 --> 01:44:52,302
..I didn't.

1296
01:44:53,469 --> 01:44:57,306
I left, with Luke.

1297
01:45:01,409 --> 01:45:03,680
He was with me that day.

1298
01:45:09,685 --> 01:45:11,621
So I lied too.

1299
01:45:25,234 --> 01:45:27,737
See you in another
20 years, hey?

1300
01:46:21,256 --> 01:46:23,259
Goodbye, El.

1301
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,302
Ellie?

1302
01:48:48,136 --> 01:48:49,871
Ellie?

1303
01:48:49,904 --> 01:48:51,573
Ellie?

1304
01:48:56,478 --> 01:48:59,948
<i>He called me by my
mother's name the first time.</i>

1305
01:49:00,949 --> 01:49:03,519
<i>"I'm Ellie," I try to scream.</i>

1306
01:49:03,551 --> 01:49:05,721
<i>"My name is Ellie."</i>

1307
01:49:09,457 --> 01:49:13,161
<i>He takes it anyway,
my name from me.</i>

1308
01:49:13,194 --> 01:49:15,331
Oh, bloody hell!

1309
01:49:16,131 --> 01:49:17,700
Grant! Come!

1310
01:49:18,701 --> 01:49:20,203
<i>A punch.</i>

1311
01:49:20,235 --> 01:49:22,204
<i>Hard.</i>

1312
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:24,407
<i>I can't feel it.</i>

1313
01:49:24,439 --> 01:49:28,911
<i>Can't taste the blood.
Can't move. Can't cry.</i>

1314
01:49:31,447 --> 01:49:34,984
<i>Frozen in 40 degrees.</i>

1315
01:49:36,985 --> 01:49:39,221
<i>My mother hated him too.</i>

1316
01:49:39,255 --> 01:49:43,292
<i>She ran away,
said she'd be back for me.</i>

1317
01:49:44,326 --> 01:49:46,796
<i>Hope disguised as a lie.</i>

1318
01:49:48,296 --> 01:49:51,800
<i>It's my turn now... to leave.</i>

1319
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:58,506
<i>"I'll kill her if I find her,"
he said.</i>

1320
01:49:58,539 --> 01:50:00,076
Oh, El.

1321
01:50:00,109 --> 01:50:03,913
<i>"I'll kill you too
if you try and run away."</i>

1322
01:50:05,613 --> 01:50:07,082
<i>Just try,</i>

1323
01:50:07,115 --> 01:50:09,618
<i>because I'll be gone,</i>

1324
01:50:09,652 --> 01:50:11,319
<i>long gone.</i>

1325
01:50:11,353 --> 01:50:13,322
<i>Another name.</i>

1326
01:50:13,354 --> 01:50:16,024
<i>Another home, far from here.</i>

1327
01:50:18,127 --> 01:50:20,730
<i>Goodbye, Ellie Deacon.</i>

1328
01:50:20,762 --> 01:50:22,798
<i>Time for a new life.</i>

1329
01:50:42,283 --> 01:50:44,920
Stay there, Grant!

1330
01:51:15,149 --> 01:51:17,920
<i>No! Dad!</i>

1331
01:51:19,954 --> 01:51:22,190
<i>Stop!</i>

1332
01:52:35,010 --> 01:52:38,135
