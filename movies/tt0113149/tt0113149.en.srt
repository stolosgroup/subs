1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,040
FRENCH TWIST

3
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:51,856
Happy with the rental?

4
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:53,978
I'll come by tomorrow for the pool.

5
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:59,933
Is your dad okay?

6
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:01,865
Give your mom a kiss.

7
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:14,282
How's it going?

8
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:22,748
How did it go?

9
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:26,861
The usual: They'll think it over,
they'll call. Jerks!

10
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:28,629
- Miss.
- Hello.

11
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:30,335
Antoine. This is Vero.

12
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:32,724
Vero! Nice to meet you. Cute.

13
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:34,419
Yeah.

14
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:37,006
- A Pastis!
- Coming!

15
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:41,006
The guy wants two million for a dump.

16
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:42,432
Some nerve.

17
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:46,167
Four walls, no roof, but it sold.

18
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:47,721
Right!

19
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:49,822
Some Brit bought it.

20
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:53,745
As long as there's sun, they're happy.
Look at their weather.

21
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,681
Thanks, we've already fucked.

22
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:00,022
Nice.

23
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:03,555
Just kidding, Vero.
Wait, wait.

24
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:12,871
Well, I've got to go.

25
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:17,247
- See you tomorrow?
- I can't tomorrow.

26
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,688
Call me at 7:00.
Don't forget.

27
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:21,545
At 7:00? Okay.

28
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:24,622
See you soon?

29
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,529
- What's your sign?
- Here, Mr. Lafaye.

30
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,730
- Oops, sorry. Excuse me.
- It's okay.

31
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,352
May I?

32
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:39,534
Haven't we met?

33
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:42,381
Probably. I run the sports shop.

34
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,470
I'll have to drop by.

35
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,620
I don't look it,
but I'm really a jock.

36
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:51,429
Any time. It'd be my pleasure.

37
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:54,381
Ingrid, it's Laurent.

38
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:55,943
Yeah, everything's fine.

39
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,480
Laurent!

40
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:01,841
I'll meet you there
in an hour and a half.

41
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:03,517
Okay? Bye.

42
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:09,398
Your wife is really cute, Mr. Lafaye.

43
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:10,985
My wife? Where?

44
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:14,449
Yeah, she's cute.

45
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:15,984
Even better than that.

46
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:23,877
Julien!
Seven years bad luck if it breaks.

47
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,965
Touch with your eyes only.

48
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,273
It's pretty.

49
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:32,257
Go play with Pablo.

50
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:47,672
Hello, Mrs. Lafaye!

51
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,120
How are you?

52
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:54,742
- I'm dying from the heat.
- Mommy! Quick!

53
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:57,687
Why did you put your toy in there?

54
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:04,278
Look. Now it's all plugged up!

55
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:05,908
Real smart move.

56
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:07,491
It just fell.

57
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:10,593
Sure. It jumped right in.

58
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:17,179
Go see who it is.
Shit!

59
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,506
Mommy, it's a man.

60
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:26,383
Sorry to bother you,
but my van broke down.

61
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:29,114
Let's see what's up, Pablito.

62
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:32,302
It overheated.
May I have some water, please?

63
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,350
The man's got dirty hands.

64
00:06:37,303 --> 00:06:40,663
Stop it, Julien!
You know it's not a man.

65
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:42,288
I'll unscrew it.

66
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,669
- I'm so useless.
- I'm pretty good at this.

67
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:47,769
Are you from Paris?

68
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:50,331
I was a DJ in a club there.

69
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,510
That must be a great job.
Fiesta every night.

70
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:57,603
Yeah, we had a lot of fun.

71
00:06:57,805 --> 00:06:59,525
But I got fired.

72
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,362
Staff cutback?

73
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,636
- Love affair.
- He was your boss?

74
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:08,913
She was.

75
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:12,557
Here you go.

76
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,715
For me?

77
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,050
That's sweet.

78
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:19,504
- Sugar?
- Please. Two.

79
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,796
- Hi!
- Hi, kid.

80
00:07:27,977 --> 00:07:29,217
It stinks.

81
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:30,832
Julien! Be polite!

82
00:07:30,977 --> 00:07:33,777
He's right. It does stink.
Do you mind?

83
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:35,498
Not at all. Go ahead.

84
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:39,325
I like to smoke a little cigar
now and then.

85
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:40,603
Have one.

86
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:43,849
No, thanks.
My husband doesn't like it.

87
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:46,786
He's not home. We won't tell.

88
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:00,195
Thanks.

89
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:07,748
Great coffee.

90
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,150
It feels good to take a break.

91
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,360
That engine gave me a headache.

92
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:18,006
Piece of shit broke down three times.

93
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,660
I'm sweating like a pig and I'm dirty.
Do I smell bad?

94
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:27,741
Don't worry. I opened the window.

95
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:31,861
I like your laugh.

96
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,297
Tight, Mr. Lafaye?

97
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:47,329
Nothing gets past you.

98
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:50,649
He could've parked in your yard.

99
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,266
- Who?
- Your visitor.

100
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,489
Nicely decorated.

101
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:57,498
Depends on one's taste.

102
00:08:57,658 --> 00:09:00,058
The heat, it's never going to end.

103
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:02,443
Are you expecting triplets?

104
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:04,458
Why is he saying that to me?

105
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:25,898
What's Fatso saying? Nobody's here.

106
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:27,561
Hey, it stinks!

107
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:30,867
Loli! Don't tell me
you're smoking cigars again.

108
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:32,561
It's me.

109
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:36,429
Sorry, I'm stinking up the place.

110
00:09:36,622 --> 00:09:39,982
My van broke down
and your wife let me shower.

111
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,607
Julien clogged the drain with a toy.

112
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:46,832
Luckily she was here to fix it.

113
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:49,522
- So I...
- Let her take a shower. I know.

114
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:51,747
Is the Hare Krishna van yours?

115
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,359
I got it cheap
from some retired hippies.

116
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,746
Nice, huh?

117
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,318
- Was it in the way?
- Not at all.

118
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,254
May I use your hair dryer?

119
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:07,276
Always the bleeding heart.

120
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:08,942
You should be careful.

121
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:13,527
- Listen, she unplugged...
- The sink. I know.

122
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:15,995
Hey, Pablo won again.

123
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,290
Juju, look what you've done.

124
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:20,303
Why are you so edgy?

125
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:26,143
- I don't like her.
- Why?

126
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,239
- Didn't you notice anything?
- No.

127
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:30,803
Julien, don't play with that.

128
00:10:30,984 --> 00:10:33,144
- What's that?
- The lady's cigars.

129
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:35,201
Let me see.

130
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:41,283
Truck driver's cigars!

131
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:43,806
Can't you see she's a dyke?

132
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:46,267
I can smell them a mile away.

133
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,205
It smells great. What is it?
Rabbit. I love it.

134
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:51,126
Move over.

135
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,079
You only like women
with huge tits and garter belts.

136
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,283
Wrong.
You don't have huge tits...

137
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,290
or garter belts.

138
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:06,851
I'm glad I'm spending the evening
with my dearest wife.

139
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:10,717
Right, midgets?
Isn't she the best mom?

140
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,367
I worked so hard, I'm exhausted.

141
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,135
We'll put the kids to bed,
then let's do it!

142
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:21,562
Let it ring.

143
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:25,263
What a pain.
I told them not to call me at home.

144
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:27,775
No, I'm busy.

145
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:29,991
Okay, I'll be there in ten minutes.

146
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,340
Antoine's a pain!

147
00:11:35,452 --> 00:11:37,972
Can't he go alone?
He's your partner.

148
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:39,682
He can't schmooze.

149
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:42,793
It's a big sale.
Without me it might not go down.

150
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,759
- Go down.
- What's so funny?

151
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,715
Nothing. Just a thought.

152
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:52,111
Shit. A client at 8:00 p.m.

153
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:55,893
- And he'll want to have dinner.
- Will it be long?

154
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:59,643
I don't know.
I'll do my best, kitten.

155
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:03,115
It was the same thing yesterday
and last week!

156
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,914
We almost had
a quiet evening together!

157
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,003
We never eat before 10:00 p.m.!

158
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:11,609
Dinner time in Spain!

159
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:15,631
But in Spain I had fun.
I wasn't home alone waiting.

160
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,039
It's my job. I can't help it.

161
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:21,612
I can't pass on a deal.
We owe the bank...

162
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:24,676
- You're a quiet one.
- Loafers.

163
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:27,598
Thanks so much.
You've both been great.

164
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:29,875
Thank my wife, not me.

165
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:31,446
Some men would mind.

166
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:33,948
I'm not the type.

167
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,569
Your cigars.

168
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,470
Bye, kitten.

169
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:41,909
Should I wait for dinner?

170
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:44,129
- Better not.
- Fine.

171
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,221
Will you stay for dinner?

172
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,983
I don't want to be a bother.

173
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:51,054
It's no bother at all.

174
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:53,658
- Right, Laurent?
- Good idea.

175
00:12:54,194 --> 00:12:57,114
At least I won't be alone for once.

176
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:02,262
Do you like rabbit?

177
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:05,406
- We were the "Purple Queen".
- Here.

178
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:07,814
I was on drums.

179
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,550
We were into women's lib.

180
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:12,139
We believed in it.

181
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:16,399
Fabienne wrote the lyrics.

182
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:17,977
Death to men!

183
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,798
No! Just a title.

184
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,792
And after all this time
you split up?

185
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:26,953
I was with Dany, the guitarist.
She was dating the singer.

186
00:13:29,116 --> 00:13:31,436
- May I?
- Of course.

187
00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:35,142
You should leave some.

188
00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:36,964
He should've been here.

189
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,519
He who leaves his place...

190
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:41,224
Loses it!

191
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:42,969
That's all.

192
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:45,762
We lost track of one another.

193
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:49,554
Then we ran into each other again.

194
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:52,309
I worked at her club.
"The Sofa." Sofa, Sappho.

195
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:54,297
- Sofa?
- Sofa, Sappho.

196
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:56,416
- It's a muff bar.
- A what?

197
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,659
A muff bar. Muff, the muff.

198
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,431
- What's that?
- The muff.

199
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:03,896
We say "the carpet."

200
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,739
I didn't know that one!

201
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,794
That's a good one.

202
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:10,997
The rabbit's great.

203
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,630
What's the matter?

204
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,840
Do you know rabbit in Spanish?

205
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,593
The muff.

206
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,153
You know what it is in Quebec?

207
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,970
Beaver.

208
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:34,008
- But beavers also have a dick.
- Rabbits do too.

209
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:36,652
- But it's tiny.
- That's true.

210
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:44,287
The bitch I found in bed with her
was from Quebec.

211
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:48,232
I come home early
and get dumped.

212
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:50,022
Luckily, I had the van.

213
00:14:50,212 --> 00:14:54,252
It happened to me too.
I found a slut in my home.

214
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:59,066
I wanted to leave him,
but he was so miserable.

215
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:03,116
It can happen once, right?

216
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,620
How much are they asking?

217
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,839
Three million.
But we can negotiate.

218
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:15,369
Not bad.

219
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,224
Make an offer I can't refuse.

220
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:22,704
If you're nice to the broker.

221
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:28,219
It's a major investment.
Let me think.

222
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:31,948
Ingrid, let's close the deal now.

223
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:36,394
It's too good to let go.

224
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:38,394
It is tempting.

225
00:15:39,428 --> 00:15:41,268
I'll go for it.

226
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:56,334
What are you doing?
Get ready.

227
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,316
No. I've got to go now.

228
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:01,115
It's not late, and I still want to.

229
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,270
- One for the road.
- Some other time.

230
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:07,928
My wife's waiting for me. Stop.

231
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,582
What makes you so sure?

232
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:12,007
What do you mean?

233
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:14,145
She might be doing the same.

234
00:16:14,351 --> 00:16:17,311
Are you nuts?
Get dressed and cut it out.

235
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,360
You got hair all over me.

236
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,799
You've never thought about that?

237
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:27,347
Listen, we have great fun
screwing together.

238
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:30,722
But leave my wife out of it.

239
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,578
She's the faithful type.
Get it?

240
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,810
My husband must say the same
to his mistress about me.

241
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:48,307
Why did you quit?

242
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,360
Love.
I met Laurent while on tour.

243
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:54,006
What a pity.

244
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:55,709
Love?

245
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:58,019
No, to have quit dancing.

246
00:16:58,232 --> 00:17:00,712
It just happened that way.

247
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,779
I saw him and knew he was the one.

248
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:06,824
I mean, you just know it.

249
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:13,276
I haven't smoked in years.

250
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:20,216
I might pull my panties
over my head!

251
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,326
The pleasure would be all mine.

252
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:24,961
Let's get it straight.

253
00:17:25,153 --> 00:17:28,593
I'm only kidding.
I hope it's okay.

254
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:30,662
Yes, it's okay.

255
00:17:35,113 --> 00:17:37,553
This takes me back.

256
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:42,139
In Barcelona,
we'd go dancing all night...

257
00:17:42,448 --> 00:17:44,368
then rehearse in the morning.

258
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:45,893
We were young.

259
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:49,701
Life sucks.

260
00:17:49,908 --> 00:17:52,628
If you liked women,
you'd still be a dancer.

261
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:54,946
We might've hit it off.

262
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,476
Imagine the love affair!
Just kidding.

263
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:02,142
Don't worry, it's okay.

264
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:04,449
Great. It's cool then.

265
00:18:08,744 --> 00:18:11,144
But men are great.

266
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:12,809
Have you ever tried?

267
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:14,635
No way!

268
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,590
He sticks it in, you're in ecstasy.
Right?

269
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:20,507
But I have orgasms
and give right back.

270
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:23,545
And no premature ejaculation with us.

271
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:26,348
That's true.

272
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,859
You're right.

273
00:18:30,997 --> 00:18:32,837
Did you ever want kids?

274
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,679
Can't have it all.

275
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:39,312
Can you see me with a kid?
With my lifestyle?

276
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:43,387
I've got two cute nephews.

277
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,083
A hair!

278
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,130
- But I shaved today.
- Not close enough.

279
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:58,417
You've got a hair as big as a...

280
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,386
- Where?
- There. I'll get it.

281
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:02,385
No, it's too small.

282
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:04,343
Wait, don't move.

283
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,144
- Don't move!
- Stop!

284
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:08,974
- Why?
- Stop.

285
00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:13,332
This time, no kidding.

286
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:15,346
You turn me on.

287
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:27,415
All my stuff's in it.
It's jam-packed.

288
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:31,419
Your rabbit was delicious.

289
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,790
Really. Thanks. Bye.

290
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,326
Bye.

291
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:39,289
Bye, and thanks again.

292
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,146
Thank her, not me.

293
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:43,941
All the same, bye.
See you around.

294
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,519
Hey, kitten. Any rabbit left?

295
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:56,299
You could've saved some
from that truck driver.

296
00:19:56,594 --> 00:20:00,434
You said you were eating
with your client.

297
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:02,561
Yeah, well, I wasn't sure.

298
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:04,401
How did it go?

299
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:07,754
- With who?
- Your client.

300
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:09,532
Oh, yeah.

301
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:12,396
The deal went down.

302
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:17,596
Wait, I'm not finished.

303
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:19,124
Okay.

304
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,746
Night, kitten.

305
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:47,496
Stop it, Loli. I'm tired.

306
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:49,525
I've been at it all day.

307
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:55,502
Come on, Loli!

308
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:57,287
I want it.

309
00:20:57,436 --> 00:20:58,996
What's with you tonight?

310
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:00,425
Lolo!

311
00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:05,152
Come on.
It'll help you relax.

312
00:21:07,937 --> 00:21:09,737
Did you hear a noise?

313
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,044
Stop it.

314
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:18,573
Someone threw a stone.

315
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:36,609
- I can't believe it.
- What is it?

316
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:39,659
What's the diesel doing here?

317
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:41,511
Who?

318
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:44,012
Your pal, the top model.

319
00:21:45,235 --> 00:21:46,555
You're naked!

320
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:50,056
Seeing one for a change won't kill her.
What's wrong?

321
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,999
Sorry to wake you.
I left my wallet.

322
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:56,356
I need my papers. I'm leaving.

323
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:58,452
What a pain in the ass!

324
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:01,573
Come on, she's sweet.

325
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,469
You go then. She's your guest.

326
00:22:05,697 --> 00:22:07,497
What a grump.

327
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:11,594
Okay. Relax.

328
00:22:12,823 --> 00:22:14,503
I'll go. It's okay.

329
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:26,811
Sorry, I couldn't find it anywhere.

330
00:22:27,992 --> 00:22:29,832
Because I didn't lose it.

331
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:36,284
I just wanted... to say good-bye.

332
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:40,095
You've got guts.
What if he had come down?

333
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:43,819
I just knew it would be you.

334
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:36,766
I went to a dyke bar once...

335
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:40,321
and I ended up feeling effeminate.

336
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,746
Lucky I wasn't home last night.

337
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:47,122
I couldn't have put up with the diesel
and her smelly cigars.

338
00:23:48,254 --> 00:23:50,894
I know why she's a dyke.
She has no choice.

339
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:56,587
Mr. Lafaye?
It's for you. It's a Marijo.

340
00:23:58,131 --> 00:24:00,171
Marijo? Don't know her.

341
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:02,101
Can't keep track of them?

342
00:24:02,297 --> 00:24:04,577
No, I don't know any Marijos.

343
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,599
Take the call anyway.

344
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:09,244
Hello.

345
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:13,486
Marijo? Do I know you?

346
00:24:13,675 --> 00:24:16,355
- Who is it?
- Oh, it's you!

347
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:18,874
You're still here?
The diesel.

348
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:20,893
Put the speaker on.

349
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:22,931
I want to apologize.

350
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:24,775
You were both so nice.

351
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:26,489
May I buy you dinner?

352
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:27,875
Say yes! Yes!

353
00:24:28,053 --> 00:24:33,573
We would have been delighted,
but my wife and I are busy.

354
00:24:33,928 --> 00:24:35,528
Yes, it'll be fun!

355
00:24:35,678 --> 00:24:37,718
Hold on a second.

356
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:39,729
I want to come along.

357
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:42,672
May I bring a friend?

358
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:45,804
The doctor pulls one more
from his butt.

359
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:48,537
He counts them: 12 flowers.

360
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:53,123
So the fag says,
"I didn't know how to tell you."

361
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:59,226
Excuse me.
I'm off to the powder room.

362
00:24:59,515 --> 00:25:01,355
I have to take a leak.

363
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:05,421
I think she fancies you.

364
00:25:05,641 --> 00:25:07,681
Sure.

365
00:25:07,891 --> 00:25:09,451
I keep on telling her.

366
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:14,203
I don't mind two women doing it
as long as they fit me in.

367
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:19,081
It depends.
If she asks me, I'm out of here!

368
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:24,914
So when are you two doing it
and fitting me in?

369
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:27,752
What's with you, Loli?

370
00:25:27,937 --> 00:25:31,137
I was joking. Weren't you?
Are you shocked?

371
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:34,355
Yes!
In a woman's mouth, it's vulgar!

372
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:37,805
Why? Because there's penetration?

373
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:40,661
- Cut it out. You're pushing it.
- What's up?

374
00:25:40,897 --> 00:25:43,537
Dykes, fags and penetration.

375
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:45,535
Very highbrow!

376
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,250
Dessert time!

377
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,240
Let's sweeten up.

378
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:54,834
Damn, everything's good here.

379
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:56,863
What do I want?

380
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:59,424
For me... profiteroles.

381
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:02,897
Oh, shit. My cigarettes.

382
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:04,907
Did you choose?

383
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:06,427
I'd sure go for...

384
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:09,331
a creme brulee. And you?

385
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,206
A lemon sorbet.

386
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:13,082
I love it.

387
00:26:13,276 --> 00:26:15,076
Are you ready?

388
00:26:16,902 --> 00:26:19,382
One lemon sorbet. Marijo?

389
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,980
Creme brulee.

390
00:26:23,154 --> 00:26:24,794
I'm having the profiteroles.

391
00:26:24,987 --> 00:26:26,307
Laurent?

392
00:26:27,946 --> 00:26:30,346
Laurent. What do you want?

393
00:26:30,613 --> 00:26:32,933
Nothing. I'm not hungry anymore.

394
00:26:33,155 --> 00:26:36,675
What's wrong?
You've turned white.

395
00:26:36,988 --> 00:26:39,108
Something I ate.

396
00:26:39,323 --> 00:26:43,003
Paella's vicious.
All it takes is one clam.

397
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:53,061
Antoine, let's dance.

398
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:55,521
What's up? Too much clam?

399
00:26:55,742 --> 00:26:58,062
Come on, let's dance.

400
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,042
Come on, we'll show them.

401
00:27:41,415 --> 00:27:43,055
Marijo! Come on!

402
00:27:44,624 --> 00:27:46,064
May I?

403
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:28,786
That's enough!

404
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:30,565
- What's wrong?
- We're leaving!

405
00:28:30,714 --> 00:28:33,754
- You're hurting me!
- Come on, we're having fun.

406
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:35,727
Back off. Are you coming?

407
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,360
You're ridiculous!

408
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:41,667
No, you're ridiculous!
Are you drunk?

409
00:28:43,175 --> 00:28:45,735
Let go of me! You're sick!

410
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:48,166
You're a pain in the ass.

411
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:51,545
- Right.
- Jesus! Stop fighting.

412
00:28:51,802 --> 00:28:53,642
What's with you, Laurent?

413
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:02,371
I can get in on my own!

414
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:08,284
- Let's go.
- What about Marijo?

415
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:10,112
Leave the fat dyke.

416
00:29:10,304 --> 00:29:13,064
She's paying. We can't dump her.

417
00:29:13,305 --> 00:29:15,065
Here she comes.

418
00:29:50,686 --> 00:29:53,006
Good night, lovebirds!

419
00:29:53,353 --> 00:29:55,873
Couples! They'll patch it up.

420
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,941
Next time, I'm buying.

421
00:29:59,103 --> 00:30:01,263
Thanks, but I'm leaving tonight.

422
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:09,768
Are you okay?

423
00:30:09,897 --> 00:30:11,937
- How much?
- Three hours.

424
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:14,388
- When can we...
- Not now.

425
00:30:20,607 --> 00:30:24,327
- What came over you?
- Hush. You'll wake the kids.

426
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:26,446
Thanks, miss. Bye.

427
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,420
Had fun, huh?

428
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:34,650
I could have,
if you hadn't been such a jerk!

429
00:30:34,943 --> 00:30:36,263
Slut!

430
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:39,483
I never knew you were such a slut!

431
00:30:39,693 --> 00:30:41,013
Are you mad?

432
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:43,793
Now you're going to wake up the kids!

433
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:48,147
Did you care about the kids
when you felt up that...

434
00:30:48,402 --> 00:30:49,402
that thing?

435
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:52,928
What? What are you talking about?

436
00:30:53,195 --> 00:30:54,315
I saw you!

437
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:57,367
You had your hands
in each other's panties!

438
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,710
That sure shut you up!

439
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:04,067
Shame on you!

440
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,278
Disgusting!

441
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,565
Hey, look who's talking.

442
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,622
I never brought anyone home.

443
00:31:09,823 --> 00:31:11,903
Who screwed around in our bed?

444
00:31:12,073 --> 00:31:14,553
- It happened once!
- Well, then me too!

445
00:31:14,782 --> 00:31:16,542
But I didn't screw a fag!

446
00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:18,219
I didn't either.

447
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:20,446
Don't try to be funny!

448
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:22,697
Oh, that fat, horny pig!

449
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:24,787
I'll kick her ass!

450
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,373
Stay here, please.

451
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:30,734
Laurent, come back!

452
00:31:33,535 --> 00:31:35,775
- Get out of there.
- Laurent!

453
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:38,273
You got a problem?

454
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:40,655
Ask my wife, you slut!

455
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:43,229
- Calm down!
- Leave me alone!

456
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,243
Are you nuts?

457
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,611
Afraid of coming out?

458
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:51,869
You act tough,
but you don't have any balls!

459
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,879
The neighbors, Laurent!

460
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,420
- I'm not afraid of a baseball bat.
- Cricket bat.

461
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:04,065
It bruises better.

462
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:06,773
I'll still knock your teeth out!

463
00:32:06,998 --> 00:32:08,318
Don't hit a woman!

464
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:10,658
A woman? I don't see a woman!

465
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,555
Trouble, Mr. Lafaye?

466
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:14,427
Should I call the cops?

467
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:16,264
No, Mr. Crepineau!

468
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:19,618
My cousin saw a prowler
and called my husband.

469
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:21,116
But he's gone.

470
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:23,693
Oh, because we heard a commotion.

471
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:27,988
- Sorry we woke you up.
- Thanks.

472
00:32:31,044 --> 00:32:32,884
Let's go back in.

473
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:37,123
If I catch you around here...

474
00:32:37,337 --> 00:32:40,457
I'll ram the bat up your ass!

475
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:44,191
Not its normal use,
but it could be a lot of fun.

476
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:51,795
Asshole.

477
00:32:52,922 --> 00:32:54,562
She touched my hand.

478
00:32:54,714 --> 00:32:56,754
And you didn't do a thing?

479
00:32:56,965 --> 00:33:00,205
What did you two do together?
Answer me!

480
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:04,186
I told you... just that. I swear.
She started.

481
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:07,626
And you let her touch you?

482
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:09,564
How was it? She got you wet?

483
00:33:09,717 --> 00:33:12,357
Not at all.
I was too afraid to speak.

484
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,030
You were afraid,
so you felt her up?

485
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,979
Shut up!
I don't know what came over me.

486
00:33:18,218 --> 00:33:20,258
You know I'm not like that.

487
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:24,421
I'm ashamed.

488
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,556
So ashamed.

489
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,080
Laurent.

490
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,380
Forgive me, forgive me, please.

491
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,347
You don't know how I feel.

492
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:37,234
In front of everybody.

493
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:39,348
But nobody saw us.

494
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:41,754
At least you kept it
under the table.

495
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,102
Loli, you're repulsive.

496
00:33:45,263 --> 00:33:47,703
No, Laurent, no!

497
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:51,009
Please! Please, forgive me.

498
00:33:51,223 --> 00:33:53,223
Forgive me. Forgive me.

499
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,520
I love you. You know I do.

500
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:23,873
What are you doing here?

501
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,063
Coming to bed.

502
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,829
Are you kidding?

503
00:34:27,061 --> 00:34:29,421
Go sleep wherever,
but not here.

504
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:31,686
It's a big house.

505
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:34,976
Why not go see bushwhacker
in her pretty van?

506
00:34:36,146 --> 00:34:37,946
What do you think?

507
00:34:50,815 --> 00:34:52,655
What... Did he hit you?

508
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:55,216
- I'll bash his head in!
- No!

509
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:58,641
Tell me what happened.
Did he hurt you?

510
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,140
He threw me out.

511
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,281
I don't want him to hurt you.

512
00:35:05,443 --> 00:35:08,923
I never want anyone to hurt you, ever.

513
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:56,542
Daddy, Daddy!

514
00:35:58,535 --> 00:35:59,895
I'm hungry.

515
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:01,996
Go see Mommy.

516
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,042
Mommy's not here.

517
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:19,381
Finally. Hurry!
The sun's already up.

518
00:36:19,662 --> 00:36:23,182
I'm not doing 30 miles
sweating like a pig.

519
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,094
You could've told me.
I called the Crumble sisters.

520
00:36:27,372 --> 00:36:29,772
They'll be all hot and ready.

521
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:32,201
Hey, the kids.

522
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:36,429
You look pretty bad.

523
00:36:36,581 --> 00:36:38,141
Pass the chocolate.

524
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:40,906
Where's Mommy?

525
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,923
She's out shopping.

526
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,013
Hi, Antoine.

527
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,289
Hello.
Hurry. We're going shopping.

528
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,864
Coming.

529
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:06,356
Why is she here?

530
00:37:06,545 --> 00:37:08,425
It's all my fault.

531
00:37:08,587 --> 00:37:11,787
So take a swing at me,
but let her be.

532
00:37:12,921 --> 00:37:14,841
You banged my wife again!

533
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:17,047
Stop it, Laurent!

534
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:21,849
Stop being a jerk!
She drove me back.

535
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,670
Marijo!
So you didn't leave after all?

536
00:37:28,924 --> 00:37:32,324
A little setback,
but I'm on my way.

537
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,870
Once you know our region,
you'll never leave.

538
00:37:36,092 --> 00:37:38,412
- Are you going?
- Are we in the way?

539
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,853
Stop arguing, you two.
Life is too short.

540
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:45,412
Keep your two-bit wisdom.

541
00:37:45,593 --> 00:37:48,313
Fine.
I'll wait outside, but hurry up.

542
00:37:48,552 --> 00:37:50,472
If this keeps up, I'm going alone.

543
00:37:50,718 --> 00:37:52,718
Come on in. It's okay.

544
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:55,608
Come on!
And you, get going! Go cool down.

545
00:37:55,844 --> 00:37:59,284
And leave you two alone
to do your filthy stuff?

546
00:37:59,553 --> 00:38:03,913
You can have your wife,
but you don't deserve her.

547
00:38:12,097 --> 00:38:13,937
Are you leaving?

548
00:38:24,057 --> 00:38:25,857
I was a jerk last night.

549
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:29,266
I didn't know what I was saying.

550
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:34,733
- Forgive me.
- Don't touch me. Get out.

551
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:38,134
Isn't it great to be here?

552
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:40,471
Feel the cool breeze on your neck?

553
00:38:40,643 --> 00:38:42,483
Can't you shut up?

554
00:38:42,644 --> 00:38:45,844
- Jesus, what's with you?
- It's not your problem.

555
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:48,781
What are friends for, damn it?

556
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,980
For screwing the Crumble sisters
and bicycling like hot pigs!

557
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,230
No one made you come!

558
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:57,396
You're being a real pain.

559
00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:59,884
Screw it! You can go alone.

560
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,944
Great move.
You were getting boring.

561
00:39:03,146 --> 00:39:05,466
For Christ's sake!

562
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:07,887
That's it. Leave me!

563
00:39:08,689 --> 00:39:10,609
And you call yourself a friend?

564
00:39:10,814 --> 00:39:12,294
What's the problem?

565
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,052
Can't you see I'm miserable?

566
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:15,840
And two Pastis, two!

567
00:39:22,221 --> 00:39:23,881
Waiter, please!

568
00:39:28,978 --> 00:39:29,640
Thanks.

569
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:33,491
Nope!

570
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:46,558
Men can screw around.
It has nothing to do with love.

571
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:49,119
I mean love with a capital "L."

572
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,780
We don't use our feelings,
only our dick.

573
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:55,517
But a women who's cheating on
her husband, that's disgusting.

574
00:39:55,623 --> 00:39:58,264
That'll never happen with Loli,
you've got a real pearl there!

575
00:39:56,177 --> 00:40:01,146
And having a little fight now
and then isn't a bad thing.

576
00:40:01,354 --> 00:40:02,901
Makes a couple stronger.

577
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:10,463
If my wife had been more like yours...

578
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,165
I'd still be with her.

579
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,768
Here's a good one.

580
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:20,192
A guy had this wild thing
happen to him.

581
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:22,454
A married guy...

582
00:40:23,683 --> 00:40:25,762
happy, the perfect couple.

583
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:31,217
His wife was banging a woman.
Can you believe that?

584
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,327
You believe it?

585
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:35,489
And under his own roof.

586
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:36,501
- No way.
- I swear.

587
00:40:37,286 --> 00:40:40,838
As soon as he was away,
they'd start bushwhacking!

588
00:40:42,512 --> 00:40:43,335
How humiliating.

589
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,624
What a dork!

590
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,557
Do I know him?

591
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:52,632
He's right in front of you.

592
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:54,951
You're kidding.

593
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:57,837
Loli? With who?

594
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:04,197
With who? With who?
You idiot!

595
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:08,193
Are you my friend or what?
She's banging the dyke!

596
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:09,547
Holy shit!

597
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:14,097
No, it can't be.

598
00:41:14,983 --> 00:41:16,257
Not Loli.

599
00:41:24,975 --> 00:41:26,125
What did I do to her?

600
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,957
What did she do to her?

601
00:41:31,342 --> 00:41:33,063
- Slut.
- In my opinion...

602
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,681
she's playing with you.

603
00:41:37,085 --> 00:41:39,039
She must've found something.

604
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:41,551
I'm extra careful.

605
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:44,845
No traces, ever.

606
00:41:45,552 --> 00:41:47,977
No calls at home,
so she can't track me down.

607
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,673
I'm no bastard.
I don't want to hurt her.

608
00:41:51,638 --> 00:41:53,405
She caught me once.
That was enough.

609
00:41:56,589 --> 00:41:59,412
I don't know.
It only takes a scent.

610
00:42:00,732 --> 00:42:05,164
Women don't just use their brains.
They sense things.

611
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,548
But why?
Why with that poor /ersatz/?

612
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:14,217
At least with a man I'd understand.
But with that? Why?

613
00:42:17,053 --> 00:42:20,110
Because Loli's faithful.
She's not a pervert.

614
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:23,047
That's all that was available.

615
00:42:24,337 --> 00:42:26,040
She did it once to piss you off.

616
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:28,380
Anyhow, the dyke's gone.

617
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:46,062
Your wallet?

618
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:56,939
To say good-bye.

619
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:03,909
- May I kiss you?
- Wait. Fatso's watching.

620
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:11,019
- Life's a bitch.
- Yup.

621
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:13,149
And a short bitch too.

622
00:43:15,269 --> 00:43:17,429
Just a little kiss good-bye.

623
00:43:17,644 --> 00:43:20,604
A little love kiss, to say good-bye.

624
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,610
And then you leave?

625
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:27,946
Then I leave.

626
00:43:30,271 --> 00:43:31,631
Wait.

627
00:43:32,897 --> 00:43:34,417
Mrs. Lombard?

628
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:41,264
I've got to do my laundry.
Could you watch the kids?

629
00:43:41,565 --> 00:43:45,445
I'm hurt. I'm hurt!

630
00:43:45,732 --> 00:43:47,052
Hurt!

631
00:43:48,107 --> 00:43:50,747
I'm so hurt.

632
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:52,901
Deeply.

633
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:54,427
Hurt.

634
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:59,173
- Very, very hurt!
- It'll be okay.

635
00:44:01,985 --> 00:44:03,785
Stop it now.

636
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,084
Sluts!

637
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:12,036
Sluts... all sluts!

638
00:44:12,236 --> 00:44:13,396
Excuse him.

639
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:16,290
Come on, put my helmet on.

640
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,090
It makes me look like a dickhead.

641
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:23,120
Better a dickhead than a busted head.

642
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:25,765
We're surrounded by sluts!

643
00:44:27,279 --> 00:44:29,919
Laurent, come on. Cut it out!

644
00:44:30,155 --> 00:44:32,235
Laurent, come on.

645
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:37,019
Get on, get on.
There. Get on.

646
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,200
We'll take it nice and slow now.

647
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:41,811
Are you okay?

648
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:43,791
Why wouldn't I be okay?

649
00:44:44,032 --> 00:44:45,832
Isn't life swell?

650
00:44:47,241 --> 00:44:49,081
You're going the wrong way!

651
00:44:49,242 --> 00:44:51,722
I'm off to see the Crumble sisters!

652
00:44:51,908 --> 00:44:52,908
Come back!

653
00:44:53,575 --> 00:44:56,855
Look out! You're gonna crash!

654
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:03,936
Where are the Crumbles?

655
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,199
Where are the sluts?

656
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:11,453
You had it coming!

657
00:45:27,998 --> 00:45:29,798
Great!

658
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:33,199
We just made some cheese.
It's all fresh!

659
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:35,334
We had a little setback.

660
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:40,421
I hate women. I hate 'em!
They make me wanna puke!

661
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:43,975
We were waiting for you.

662
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:46,447
- Sluts!
- He's depressed.

663
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:47,341
What's wrong?

664
00:45:47,602 --> 00:45:49,792
Don't come near me.
Don't touch me!

665
00:45:51,956 --> 00:45:53,396
As for your crappy cheese...

666
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:57,867
I hate you,
I shit on you!

667
00:45:58,647 --> 00:45:59,494
Bitches!

668
00:46:10,338 --> 00:46:12,136
I'm gonna hump a goat.

669
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:14,929
What's wrong with this guy?

670
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:20,198
Stop it, their milk will be sour!

671
00:46:20,721 --> 00:46:25,376
Stop goofing around and
give me a hand, you bitches!

672
00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:28,320
What a pair of numbskulls!

673
00:46:29,168 --> 00:46:29,921
OK, I'm off.

674
00:46:30,302 --> 00:46:32,922
I'll make some dandelion tea.

675
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:35,256
It should clear his mind up.

676
00:46:35,321 --> 00:46:38,054
Right. Make him some herb tea.

677
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:42,075
I'll go get the car, it'll
take me at least two hours.

678
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:45,781
I'm miserable. I'm so miserable.

679
00:46:46,968 --> 00:46:50,208
I'll follow the coast
down to the Italian Riviera.

680
00:46:52,302 --> 00:46:56,782
I have a girlfriend.
She works at a spa.

681
00:46:57,095 --> 00:46:58,855
A girlfriend?

682
00:46:59,054 --> 00:47:00,854
Just a friend.

683
00:47:01,054 --> 00:47:03,054
I've got regular friends too.

684
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:09,650
We won't see each other again?

685
00:47:09,888 --> 00:47:11,968
Who knows?

686
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:13,661
I do.

687
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:26,715
Loli! Are you home?

688
00:47:27,974 --> 00:47:32,414
You're the only one that counts.
You and the children.

689
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:35,964
He got the message.
No more fooling around.

690
00:47:36,268 --> 00:47:40,428
No more girls.
No more cheating left and right.

691
00:47:40,685 --> 00:47:43,285
And he really means it.

692
00:47:44,478 --> 00:47:46,798
What cheating left and right?

693
00:47:53,688 --> 00:47:55,248
When you caught him.

694
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:57,357
Don't take me for an idiot!

695
00:47:57,563 --> 00:48:00,643
You said: "Left and right"!

696
00:48:00,855 --> 00:48:03,695
He's been cheating on me,
and you knew it?

697
00:48:03,939 --> 00:48:05,619
With who?

698
00:48:05,814 --> 00:48:08,574
But... But...
With who? Who? Nobody.

699
00:48:08,815 --> 00:48:13,135
It was just a little fling or two.
He's a man with needs.

700
00:48:13,482 --> 00:48:16,722
I know nothing!
It's none of my business!

701
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:19,983
Loli, have you gone mad?

702
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:22,871
You're his best friend, you bastard.

703
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,988
You're both bastards!

704
00:48:25,234 --> 00:48:29,474
So you'd better tell me everything,
or I'll gut you!

705
00:48:37,395 --> 00:48:39,235
You son of a bitch!

706
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:49,929
What's going on?

707
00:48:50,113 --> 00:48:52,033
She's moving in.

708
00:48:52,238 --> 00:48:54,158
You bastard!

709
00:48:57,405 --> 00:48:59,205
What was that you said?

710
00:48:59,406 --> 00:49:02,926
How long have you
been fooling around?

711
00:49:03,197 --> 00:49:05,277
Everybody knew.

712
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:07,249
Everybody!

713
00:49:07,407 --> 00:49:11,687
You cheated on me
with every slut around.

714
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,189
I'm humiliated.

715
00:49:14,408 --> 00:49:17,728
Ashamed to be married
to a pig like you.

716
00:49:17,992 --> 00:49:19,592
What's this bullshit?

717
00:49:19,742 --> 00:49:22,782
Ask your friend Antoine!

718
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:24,917
Unless he made it up!

719
00:49:25,076 --> 00:49:26,596
And this!

720
00:49:26,826 --> 00:49:28,426
You use condoms with me?

721
00:49:28,618 --> 00:49:33,138
You have a whole stock
hidden in the kids' room!

722
00:49:33,411 --> 00:49:35,051
You're a monster!

723
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:44,319
I don't want her
anywhere near my son!

724
00:49:48,955 --> 00:49:52,715
Whatever happens, Loli,
whatever happens...

725
00:49:53,038 --> 00:49:56,238
I don't want this diesel in my house!

726
00:49:56,498 --> 00:49:58,298
If she goes, I divorce.

727
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:02,617
With your track record,
kiss the house good-bye!

728
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:06,356
- Maybe, but I'd get the kids!
- Not with a good lawyer!

729
00:50:06,582 --> 00:50:08,942
Come, baby. Come with Mommy.

730
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,410
You're wrecking a home.

731
00:50:20,585 --> 00:50:22,425
Feel good about it?

732
00:50:38,046 --> 00:50:40,046
You're not leaving?

733
00:50:46,006 --> 00:50:48,006
What did you do to me?

734
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,040
Why'd you do it?

735
00:50:57,237 --> 00:50:59,037
You're my friend! Why?

736
00:51:01,154 --> 00:51:03,114
I was trying to help.

737
00:51:04,988 --> 00:51:07,108
Hit me... kick me.

738
00:51:07,321 --> 00:51:09,241
I'm useless. I'm a shit.

739
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:18,268
Stop bawling!

740
00:51:20,365 --> 00:51:22,165
I should be crying.

741
00:51:28,075 --> 00:51:30,235
This is a nightmare.

742
00:51:31,115 --> 00:51:32,358
Please God, I want to wake up.

743
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,679
What are you doing?
You're crazy!

744
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:49,310
- Yeah, I'm crazy!
- Put that down!

745
00:51:50,078 --> 00:51:51,438
Where are the bullets?

746
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:55,220
Don't mess with that!
For Christ's sake, stop!

747
00:51:59,621 --> 00:52:01,421
Let go, or I'll hurt you!

748
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:05,101
I don't care.
Stop, I'm begging you!

749
00:52:09,581 --> 00:52:11,261
Think about your kids.

750
00:52:11,455 --> 00:52:14,455
In jail, you won't ever see them.

751
00:52:14,623 --> 00:52:16,823
Not seeing your kids...

752
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:19,319
is the worst thing on earth.

753
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,020
I haven't seen mine in 12 years.

754
00:52:22,249 --> 00:52:23,689
Twelve years.

755
00:52:41,252 --> 00:52:42,732
Good evening.

756
00:52:46,629 --> 00:52:48,629
Why are you so sad?

757
00:52:49,254 --> 00:52:50,814
Why?

758
00:52:50,962 --> 00:52:53,202
Because of whores like you.

759
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:55,701
You're more the heartbreaker.

760
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,680
With your looks.

761
00:52:57,796 --> 00:52:59,796
Stop it. I'm not interested.

762
00:53:00,464 --> 00:53:02,824
You're not here by chance.

763
00:53:04,173 --> 00:53:05,653
Why not?

764
00:53:05,798 --> 00:53:07,958
It'd be my first old bag.

765
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:14,446
I'm leaving.

766
00:53:17,634 --> 00:53:20,274
I'll pay. Don't worry.

767
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,907
Too old?

768
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:26,207
Sorry, I was cruel.

769
00:53:26,385 --> 00:53:28,385
I'm used to worse.

770
00:53:29,802 --> 00:53:32,202
I can't be picky anymore.

771
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,919
Please.

772
00:53:52,222 --> 00:53:54,342
It's not your age.

773
00:53:55,806 --> 00:53:57,886
You're beautiful.

774
00:53:58,098 --> 00:53:59,858
Look at me.

775
00:54:00,015 --> 00:54:01,655
You're beautiful.

776
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,750
It's me. I'm not doing well.

777
00:54:05,973 --> 00:54:08,453
Usually, I do the comforting.

778
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:12,331
Go.

779
00:54:12,475 --> 00:54:15,155
Go to the wife
who's waiting for you.

780
00:54:18,434 --> 00:54:20,194
She's not waiting.

781
00:54:20,351 --> 00:54:21,791
Not anymore.

782
00:54:24,477 --> 00:54:26,797
Stay a while, if you want.

783
00:54:26,978 --> 00:54:28,978
Since you're paying.

784
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:34,051
To say what?

785
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:37,552
Bullshit you've heard
over and over?

786
00:54:39,563 --> 00:54:43,403
Actually, my story
has a little twist to it.

787
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,960
She dumped me for a woman.

788
00:54:48,606 --> 00:54:50,526
Isn't that funny?

789
00:54:54,356 --> 00:54:56,916
You only have one true love
in your life.

790
00:54:57,149 --> 00:54:58,869
Only one.

791
00:54:59,066 --> 00:55:02,146
All the others
are just poor substitutes.

792
00:55:03,859 --> 00:55:06,659
You might not know
it's the right one.

793
00:55:07,942 --> 00:55:09,782
Or you might know...

794
00:55:09,984 --> 00:55:11,784
but not be loved back.

795
00:55:13,818 --> 00:55:16,018
And sometimes it's the perfect match.

796
00:55:16,235 --> 00:55:18,795
That's the most difficult.

797
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:21,587
But when it happens, don't blow it.

798
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,620
Is it that one?

799
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,767
It was, but I found out too late.

800
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:32,891
Bullshit.

801
00:55:34,738 --> 00:55:36,778
If it is, then swallow your pride.

802
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:40,027
Beg, grovel... accept.

803
00:55:40,947 --> 00:55:42,907
Believe me.

804
00:55:43,155 --> 00:55:46,195
You must show those you love
how much you love them.

805
00:55:48,448 --> 00:55:50,488
I understood too late.

806
00:55:57,366 --> 00:55:59,646
Give me a kiss.

807
00:55:59,825 --> 00:56:01,985
Just a kiss.

808
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,190
I cooked a roast and vegetables.

809
00:56:31,434 --> 00:56:34,394
Do you like that?
Great.

810
00:56:34,643 --> 00:56:36,443
Will you be long?

811
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,832
See you soon. I love you.

812
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:48,389
- I want juice.
- You've had enough.

813
00:56:48,604 --> 00:56:51,204
- A little more.
- I said no.

814
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:53,201
Eat, Pablo.

815
00:56:55,146 --> 00:56:58,346
Eat the good food Daddy made.

816
00:56:58,563 --> 00:57:01,283
- Here, baby.
- Can I try?

817
00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:02,722
Huh, Pablito?

818
00:57:02,856 --> 00:57:04,856
Do you have kids? No?

819
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:07,063
So butt out!

820
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,150
Yes, baby.

821
00:57:10,315 --> 00:57:11,795
Here, baby.

822
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,820
Smell that? It'll be delicious.

823
00:57:18,025 --> 00:57:19,265
It's always delicious.

824
00:57:33,694 --> 00:57:36,694
- That's my shirt.
- Really?

825
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,440
- Where was it?
- In a pile.

826
00:57:39,654 --> 00:57:41,054
That's my shirt.

827
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,820
You steal my shirts too?

828
00:57:44,987 --> 00:57:46,827
You can have it back!

829
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,710
Keep it. It's dirty.

830
00:57:57,698 --> 00:58:00,618
- What a looker.
- You like it?

831
00:58:00,864 --> 00:58:02,584
Mommy's beautiful.

832
00:58:02,741 --> 00:58:04,461
One from the heart.

833
00:58:07,907 --> 00:58:12,147
Look, I got it for nothing.
Beautiful, huh?

834
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,442
Off to bed, kids.

835
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:21,131
Give Mommy a kiss.

836
00:58:24,202 --> 00:58:26,002
A little peck.

837
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:30,963
You brushed your teeth?
Go on, I'll be right along.

838
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:42,519
Oh, you.

839
00:58:42,705 --> 00:58:45,345
I don't like your hair like that.

840
00:58:48,538 --> 00:58:50,898
Could I have some bread, please?

841
00:58:53,832 --> 00:58:56,952
Nice eating in front of a newspaper.

842
00:58:57,206 --> 00:58:58,566
You get the news.

843
00:58:58,707 --> 00:59:01,627
If I loafed all day,
I could read the paper too.

844
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,880
Who's that aimed at?

845
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:09,121
- I'll get the cheese.
- Good for you.

846
00:59:15,627 --> 00:59:18,347
- Bastard!
- Sure, I'm the bastard.

847
00:59:18,544 --> 00:59:22,344
She lives off me and screws my wife,
but I'm the bastard.

848
00:59:22,627 --> 00:59:24,987
You know what really bothers you?

849
00:59:25,211 --> 00:59:26,691
You can't screw her!

850
00:59:26,878 --> 00:59:29,238
Please! I don't know how you can.

851
00:59:31,963 --> 00:59:34,643
Be an angel.
Give me some cheese.

852
00:59:40,131 --> 00:59:43,291
- Sorry.
- Some of that one too.

853
00:59:43,505 --> 00:59:45,545
Thanks. No butter?

854
00:59:46,919 --> 00:59:49,233
I'll rub your nose in the butter, sir!

855
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:57,145
Hello? Yes, just a moment please.

856
00:59:57,472 --> 00:59:59,844
Hey, it's Ingrid.

857
01:00:00,706 --> 01:00:01,589
I'm not here.

858
01:00:01,627 --> 01:00:05,301
Bad luck, he just left!

859
01:00:06,096 --> 01:00:09,693
Yes, I'll tell him.
Yes, of course I will!

860
01:00:09,843 --> 01:00:13,405
But he's very busy these days.
That's right, talk to you later!

861
01:00:15,762 --> 01:00:17,943
That's the third time
she's calling this week.

862
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:19,623
And so does Vיro.

863
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:21,546
Let them call.

864
01:00:23,764 --> 01:00:26,578
You've been hiding for a month now.

865
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:28,363
You look like a zombie.

866
01:00:29,044 --> 01:00:31,354
Come on, let's go out.
It'll do you good.

867
01:00:40,383 --> 01:00:41,673
She likes you.

868
01:00:41,727 --> 01:00:46,015
I always knew it. You can
have her whenever you want!

869
01:00:46,196 --> 01:00:47,196
Nice sense of humor.

870
01:01:13,165 --> 01:01:16,165
Are you listening?
He's feeling bad.

871
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:20,015
He was crying in front
of the TV last night.

872
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,650
Laurent? I don't believe it.

873
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:24,353
Go easy on him.

874
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:27,221
After what he did?
Are you kidding?

875
01:01:27,459 --> 01:01:30,419
I feel bad he's so flipped out.

876
01:01:30,668 --> 01:01:33,228
He screwed up, so he's paying.

877
01:01:35,878 --> 01:01:37,358
Ease up.

878
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,020
Go see him.

879
01:01:42,628 --> 01:01:44,588
Do it for me.

880
01:01:45,212 --> 01:01:46,852
Do you want me to?

881
01:01:49,422 --> 01:01:50,862
Okay.

882
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:58,270
At least put something on.

883
01:02:04,882 --> 01:02:06,762
Leave me alone.

884
01:02:06,965 --> 01:02:08,805
Go back upstairs.

885
01:02:20,217 --> 01:02:22,977
Stop it. You're being a pain.

886
01:02:27,135 --> 01:02:28,935
Tell me what to do.

887
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:33,490
I can't take it anymore.

888
01:02:33,678 --> 01:02:35,718
I love you.

889
01:02:35,928 --> 01:02:37,728
I love you so.

890
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:41,051
I'm nothing without you.

891
01:02:41,262 --> 01:02:42,702
Forgive me.

892
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:46,709
Stop it now.

893
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:50,597
You don't love me anymore?

894
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,660
It's over?

895
01:02:55,807 --> 01:02:57,487
Then say it.

896
01:02:57,682 --> 01:02:59,882
Look me in the eye and say it.

897
01:03:00,057 --> 01:03:02,017
I'll let you be.

898
01:03:02,141 --> 01:03:03,661
I'll leave.

899
01:03:05,142 --> 01:03:06,982
You'll never see me again.

900
01:03:10,101 --> 01:03:12,701
But I must know... I must know!

901
01:03:41,313 --> 01:03:43,593
Remember our first time?

902
01:03:44,981 --> 01:03:47,301
The bed was even smaller.

903
01:03:49,064 --> 01:03:51,424
You wore a red dress.

904
01:03:51,607 --> 01:03:56,007
And you were in such a hurry
you caught your finger in the zipper.

905
01:04:11,235 --> 01:04:13,835
- Do you love me?
- Y-Yes.

906
01:04:14,026 --> 01:04:16,906
- Say it.
- Yes!

907
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:19,473
- Say it.
- Yes! Yes, I love you.

908
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,749
Sorry to disturb you lovebirds.

909
01:04:29,988 --> 01:04:32,988
- You have to get the kids.
- Thanks.

910
01:04:33,155 --> 01:04:34,955
Oh, and I'm leaving.

911
01:04:35,155 --> 01:04:36,835
Good news at last.

912
01:04:36,988 --> 01:04:39,428
But why?

913
01:04:40,948 --> 01:04:42,588
What got into her?

914
01:04:42,739 --> 01:04:44,659
What now?

915
01:04:44,823 --> 01:04:47,423
Can't I sleep with my husband?

916
01:04:47,616 --> 01:04:50,696
Of course you can.
And I can leave!

917
01:04:52,157 --> 01:04:55,317
For once I agree with you.
Put that on.

918
01:04:56,825 --> 01:04:59,505
You asked me to be nice to him.

919
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:02,180
Being nice to guys
means balling them?

920
01:05:02,409 --> 01:05:04,569
Guys! Marijo, it's not guys.

921
01:05:04,743 --> 01:05:06,343
It's my husband!

922
01:05:06,952 --> 01:05:09,192
Not easy to cope with, huh?

923
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:13,848
Why don't you just drive off
in that pretty little van of yours?

924
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:17,961
Loli, ask your husband
to put some underwear on.

925
01:05:18,203 --> 01:05:20,043
Let's not bicker over details.

926
01:05:20,204 --> 01:05:23,084
Oh, baby, afraid of Uncle Dick?

927
01:05:23,329 --> 01:05:25,089
No, it's just ugly.

928
01:05:25,204 --> 01:05:26,364
That's all.

929
01:05:26,788 --> 01:05:29,068
Yup, but this is my house.

930
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:34,009
And in my house,
I walk around naked...

931
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:36,011
if I feel like it.

932
01:05:36,164 --> 01:05:38,764
Please, don't overdo it.
And you?

933
01:05:38,999 --> 01:05:42,359
You're bailing out again?
Yet you can't live without me?

934
01:05:42,624 --> 01:05:44,304
Take your glasses off.

935
01:05:44,499 --> 01:05:47,259
Look, I put up with your hubby...

936
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,500
but there are limits.

937
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:51,708
So you choose, or I split!

938
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:55,914
- Then split! The door's wide open!
- I don't want to choose!

939
01:05:56,168 --> 01:05:59,128
I don't want to, and I can't.

940
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:01,056
How can you ask me that?

941
01:06:02,252 --> 01:06:05,852
I've always hated dykes,
and I always will.

942
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:08,327
- Saggy balls.
- You're gonna get it.

943
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:09,904
Come on then.

944
01:06:11,712 --> 01:06:14,272
Are you nuts?
Marijo, are you okay?

945
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:16,544
Wow, it feels good!

946
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,079
It could work out fine...

947
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:26,173
with a little good will.

948
01:06:26,381 --> 01:06:28,381
What do you mean, good will?

949
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:31,590
Three days each. That's fair.

950
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,000
Two times three is six.
A week has seven days.

951
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:37,098
On the seventh day we rest.

952
01:06:37,257 --> 01:06:39,857
- What do you mean, rest?
- Each in his own bed.

953
01:06:40,049 --> 01:06:42,249
There are only two beds for three.

954
01:06:42,425 --> 01:06:44,705
That's the problem.

955
01:06:44,883 --> 01:06:46,283
What problem?

956
01:06:46,425 --> 01:06:49,385
I take the room, you the den,
Marijo the van.

957
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:52,595
Fine by me,
but the neighbors will wonder...

958
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:56,403
why the cousin sleeps in the van
once a week.

959
01:06:56,677 --> 01:07:00,997
Just be discreet.
I know it's asking a lot.

960
01:07:01,303 --> 01:07:03,103
It makes you sick that I'm staying?

961
01:07:03,344 --> 01:07:06,064
Get used to it!

962
01:07:06,345 --> 01:07:10,145
You're so childish.
Can't you be more mature?

963
01:07:10,429 --> 01:07:14,429
Easy for you to say,
playing princess in your room.

964
01:07:14,722 --> 01:07:16,642
Stop showing off your ass!

965
01:07:16,847 --> 01:07:18,767
As if I'd never seen it!

966
01:07:54,018 --> 01:07:55,378
Coming.

967
01:08:14,189 --> 01:08:17,069
No, no, no! Today's Sunday.

968
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:26,780
See you Thursday.

969
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:54,910
See you tomorrow.

970
01:09:05,363 --> 01:09:06,883
Good night!

971
01:09:13,531 --> 01:09:15,451
Hello, Mrs. Lafaye.

972
01:09:18,449 --> 01:09:21,769
Hello, Loli.
Wow, she's beautiful!

973
01:09:49,871 --> 01:09:51,791
I love you.

974
01:09:51,996 --> 01:09:53,916
If you love me, kick her out.

975
01:09:54,163 --> 01:09:57,403
Aren't we happier since she came?

976
01:09:57,664 --> 01:09:59,584
You're your wife's lover.

977
01:09:59,789 --> 01:10:01,629
Sure, I should thank her.

978
01:10:02,914 --> 01:10:04,754
Listen, I can't keep this up.

979
01:10:04,915 --> 01:10:07,155
Don't get started again.

980
01:10:07,373 --> 01:10:08,773
Let's go.

981
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:13,284
You're not dressed? Hurry up.

982
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:16,938
You won't talk.
You only speak with your ass.

983
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:18,568
That's nice.

984
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,510
Get dressed and cut the bullshit.

985
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:23,391
We've got to pick up the kids.

986
01:10:23,543 --> 01:10:24,943
She's not doing it?

987
01:10:25,209 --> 01:10:27,529
She's at the unemployment office.

988
01:10:27,751 --> 01:10:30,551
They should find her a job abroad.

989
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:33,474
There must be dyke bars in Guyana.

990
01:10:33,711 --> 01:10:36,791
Jealous, jealous, jealous.

991
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,560
Mommy, I made a drawing.

992
01:10:50,755 --> 01:10:53,155
- For Daddy or Mommy?
- For Mommy.

993
01:10:54,381 --> 01:10:56,221
Not for Daddy? Figures.

994
01:10:57,881 --> 01:10:59,281
Jealous.

995
01:11:00,632 --> 01:11:02,472
What's this mess?

996
01:11:04,382 --> 01:11:07,142
A bargain. The kids'll love it.

997
01:11:07,382 --> 01:11:08,702
And the adults too!

998
01:11:08,882 --> 01:11:11,522
- Thanks so much.
- Who's that?

999
01:11:11,717 --> 01:11:15,077
A long story. It's a crazy life.
Hey, girls.

1000
01:11:15,342 --> 01:11:18,582
I'm at the unemployment office,
and guess what?

1001
01:11:18,843 --> 01:11:21,803
There's my old pal Dany!
Can you believe it?

1002
01:11:22,052 --> 01:11:23,132
Hi!

1003
01:11:26,261 --> 01:11:28,741
- And Solange.
- Hi.

1004
01:11:28,969 --> 01:11:31,049
I'm off to wash the kids.

1005
01:11:31,262 --> 01:11:33,102
Bye.

1006
01:11:34,179 --> 01:11:36,539
Come, Pablito. Bath time.

1007
01:11:37,804 --> 01:11:40,724
Well, uh, time to go.

1008
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:44,010
Give me a buzz in Paris,
huh, babe?

1009
01:11:45,181 --> 01:11:47,741
Here's my number. Call me.

1010
01:11:47,931 --> 01:11:50,611
No! Don't just leave like that.

1011
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,406
Let's have a drink.

1012
01:11:53,723 --> 01:11:55,043
I'm not hungry.

1013
01:11:55,223 --> 01:11:57,543
Eat your meat, like your brother.

1014
01:11:57,724 --> 01:12:00,604
- How about a drink?
- I'm too busy.

1015
01:12:00,808 --> 01:12:02,768
They're nice, huh?

1016
01:12:02,933 --> 01:12:06,733
Especially Dany.
She played bass guitar in a band.

1017
01:12:07,059 --> 01:12:08,499
Purple Queen.

1018
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:12,239
- Come on.
- I'm too busy!

1019
01:12:13,101 --> 01:12:15,661
- Something wrong, kitten?
- Why would there be?

1020
01:12:15,894 --> 01:12:17,894
My little wife.

1021
01:12:18,727 --> 01:12:21,887
- What's cooking?
- Rabbit.

1022
01:12:22,102 --> 01:12:24,102
It'll be good.

1023
01:12:29,062 --> 01:12:31,222
- I'll cream your ass!
- I doubt it.

1024
01:12:31,396 --> 01:12:35,276
It'd be the first time
a man touches your ass.

1025
01:12:35,563 --> 01:12:37,363
- Cut it out!
- Weep, ladies!

1026
01:12:38,564 --> 01:12:41,164
Ain't over yet. Match point!

1027
01:12:42,939 --> 01:12:43,979
Coming, kitten!

1028
01:12:44,898 --> 01:12:46,498
Time out?

1029
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:52,005
- What's up, kitten?
- Dinner is ready.

1030
01:12:52,232 --> 01:12:53,552
They're not staying.

1031
01:12:53,732 --> 01:12:56,412
Ask Marijo. They're her pals.

1032
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:58,941
Want to play, Loli?

1033
01:12:59,067 --> 01:13:01,707
I have a lot to do,
and I'm on my own!

1034
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,020
Is there a problem?

1035
01:13:05,527 --> 01:13:06,887
Not at all.

1036
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:09,790
Storm warning posted.

1037
01:13:10,902 --> 01:13:12,702
- Tell me something.
- What?

1038
01:13:14,444 --> 01:13:16,604
- I'm wondering.
- What?

1039
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:19,099
Why are you so nice suddenly?

1040
01:13:20,404 --> 01:13:22,964
I'm lightening up. It happens.

1041
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:25,915
Let's stop acting like old pricks.

1042
01:13:26,112 --> 01:13:27,792
Two against one, ladies?

1043
01:13:27,947 --> 01:13:29,947
Well, the husband's nice.

1044
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:31,417
Julien, stop that!

1045
01:13:32,448 --> 01:13:36,212
Pablo is going to take a nice nap
while mommy's being mad at my friends.

1046
01:13:36,371 --> 01:13:37,940
Even though they are really nice.

1047
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,779
Especially Dany, the bass player!

1048
01:13:41,097 --> 01:13:43,474
She's your ex, right?

1049
01:13:43,658 --> 01:13:45,858
You'd get along with them.

1050
01:13:46,032 --> 01:13:47,912
I don't like her!

1051
01:13:48,116 --> 01:13:51,316
Too bad.
She's my friend and she's great.

1052
01:13:51,576 --> 01:13:53,696
I don't want them in my home!

1053
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:57,370
- Shit!
- Cheers.

1054
01:13:57,826 --> 01:13:59,906
- Marijo, you want some?
- No, thanks.

1055
01:14:01,576 --> 01:14:03,496
Want to eat out, girls?

1056
01:14:03,702 --> 01:14:05,702
Yeah! I'm getting hungry.

1057
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:08,190
- Good idea.
- Great idea!

1058
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:11,650
Oh, no! Have dinner with us.

1059
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:13,350
Not enough food!

1060
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:16,415
Then we'll dig up some pasta, okay?

1061
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,980
So he bought the bunker!

1062
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,563
Rita's married.

1063
01:14:20,704 --> 01:14:22,224
No way!

1064
01:14:22,413 --> 01:14:24,573
In Sweden, with Isabelle.

1065
01:14:24,789 --> 01:14:26,589
You had me scared!

1066
01:14:39,957 --> 01:14:41,477
No, thanks.

1067
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:42,784
Now, listen, you!

1068
01:14:43,791 --> 01:14:45,071
They're al dente.

1069
01:14:47,624 --> 01:14:49,104
You two go way back?

1070
01:14:49,292 --> 01:14:50,612
Oh, yeah.

1071
01:14:50,792 --> 01:14:53,072
We were broke, but we had fun.

1072
01:14:53,251 --> 01:14:55,051
Those were the days.

1073
01:14:55,209 --> 01:14:59,289
- We're out of gas.
- Then get off your fat ass!

1074
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:04,647
I told you I put on weight.

1075
01:15:04,878 --> 01:15:06,398
Wait, I'll go.

1076
01:15:09,253 --> 01:15:12,053
Why not champagne? To celebrate!

1077
01:15:12,295 --> 01:15:15,735
I saw her eyeing you up!
All gooey-eyed!

1078
01:15:15,963 --> 01:15:18,963
How'd you manage?
She's ugly as shit!

1079
01:15:19,172 --> 01:15:21,292
And the other paratrooper!

1080
01:15:21,464 --> 01:15:23,424
Look who's jealous now.

1081
01:15:23,631 --> 01:15:25,591
Oh, yeah? How come?

1082
01:15:25,798 --> 01:15:28,678
You've been taking time off
for your husband!

1083
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:30,084
You can't fool me.

1084
01:15:30,257 --> 01:15:32,537
I'm allowed to go out.

1085
01:15:32,715 --> 01:15:34,595
And I to have friends!

1086
01:15:34,799 --> 01:15:37,119
I'm not putting up with dykes!

1087
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:40,190
The recession put us in a slump.

1088
01:15:40,425 --> 01:15:41,905
Do you count too?

1089
01:15:42,134 --> 01:15:43,534
It's better now.

1090
01:15:43,759 --> 01:15:45,559
Bitch!

1091
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,560
I see good signs.

1092
01:15:47,718 --> 01:15:49,718
How about in your business?

1093
01:15:50,968 --> 01:15:53,608
There are ups and downs.

1094
01:15:53,803 --> 01:15:56,323
I'm into army surplus.

1095
01:15:56,511 --> 01:15:58,751
You are so selfish!

1096
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:01,009
Gotta go. I'm up early.

1097
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,540
I'm splitting too.

1098
01:16:03,762 --> 01:16:05,842
Don't go. Coffee's ready.

1099
01:16:06,013 --> 01:16:09,493
I'm up at the crack of dawn
tomorrow.

1100
01:16:09,805 --> 01:16:12,245
- It's not late.
- I wake up at 5:00 a.m.

1101
01:16:12,471 --> 01:16:15,311
I'm tired. I'm going to bed!

1102
01:16:16,722 --> 01:16:18,442
- Bye, ma'am.
- Night.

1103
01:16:20,223 --> 01:16:21,983
Fuck off.

1104
01:16:23,431 --> 01:16:24,871
Bitch.

1105
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:26,535
There's pasta.

1106
01:16:29,474 --> 01:16:31,834
Stay, Dany. I'll drive you back.

1107
01:16:32,016 --> 01:16:35,616
No, I'd better go.
It's getting tense.

1108
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:38,170
Tense? What's tense?

1109
01:16:38,351 --> 01:16:41,231
You mean Loli? It is tense.

1110
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:43,756
We haven't talked in years.

1111
01:16:43,977 --> 01:16:45,777
You've got to stay.

1112
01:16:45,977 --> 01:16:49,297
Well, I'm off.
Thanks for the pasta.

1113
01:16:49,602 --> 01:16:51,042
Thank your wife.

1114
01:16:51,228 --> 01:16:53,908
Any problem with the purchase,
just give a buzz.

1115
01:16:54,103 --> 01:16:55,503
Bye, now.

1116
01:16:55,645 --> 01:16:57,685
My wife seems jealous, but...

1117
01:16:57,895 --> 01:17:00,775
Spaniards! It comes and it goes.

1118
01:17:02,396 --> 01:17:04,716
Okay. Well, we'll see.

1119
01:17:04,938 --> 01:17:06,378
Some cards?

1120
01:17:16,816 --> 01:17:18,936
- Your turn, Dany.
- Wait a sec.

1121
01:17:21,815 --> 01:17:23,535
I'll pass.

1122
01:17:25,733 --> 01:17:27,813
You're a funny guy.

1123
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:33,860
'Cause I live with my wife's mistress?

1124
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:38,388
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

1125
01:17:38,568 --> 01:17:40,648
It is pretty unusual.

1126
01:17:40,819 --> 01:17:45,659
I love Loli,
and I'll win her back one day.

1127
01:17:47,821 --> 01:17:49,541
Wouldn't you, for love?

1128
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,055
I don't think so.

1129
01:17:53,237 --> 01:17:54,997
I would.

1130
01:17:55,155 --> 01:17:57,795
If I had to, I would.

1131
01:17:57,988 --> 01:18:00,908
That's why I let you
screw in secret.

1132
01:18:03,989 --> 01:18:05,789
The tension is rising.

1133
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:09,188
It's cool. We're only talking.

1134
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,920
Amongst men.

1135
01:18:13,491 --> 01:18:17,451
Julien, no bicycling.
Come and eat.

1136
01:18:17,699 --> 01:18:19,539
Come and eat, Julien.

1137
01:18:24,242 --> 01:18:26,402
Hi, kiddo. Hello.

1138
01:18:26,617 --> 01:18:28,497
I slept like a charm!

1139
01:18:28,702 --> 01:18:30,062
Where'd she sleep?

1140
01:18:30,202 --> 01:18:32,562
On the sofa.
Marijo, in the office.

1141
01:18:32,785 --> 01:18:35,065
At least, I think.

1142
01:18:40,828 --> 01:18:44,148
I've got tickets for U2.
Like to come?

1143
01:18:44,413 --> 01:18:47,333
Great.
I'd love to see U2 with you too.

1144
01:18:53,205 --> 01:18:55,245
But I don't know.

1145
01:18:56,497 --> 01:18:58,377
Who's stopping you?

1146
01:18:59,497 --> 01:19:00,777
Nobody.

1147
01:19:03,915 --> 01:19:06,235
- Coffee, Loli?
- No, I had mine.

1148
01:19:06,457 --> 01:19:09,657
I woke up at 8:00 with the kids.

1149
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:15,145
I'll be going.
Can I call a cab?

1150
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,093
- I'll drive you.
- No.

1151
01:19:17,251 --> 01:19:20,851
Your train is at 5:00.
You have plenty of time.

1152
01:19:21,084 --> 01:19:24,524
We could go for a walk.
To the Ochres?

1153
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:26,434
With the kids, huh, Loli?

1154
01:19:27,419 --> 01:19:29,659
- No, I'll drive her.
- Why?

1155
01:19:29,877 --> 01:19:33,797
Do you mind going with me?
Or does she mind?

1156
01:19:34,129 --> 01:19:36,289
No, not at all.

1157
01:19:39,337 --> 01:19:40,897
What's the Ochres?

1158
01:19:52,923 --> 01:19:54,763
Isn't it beautiful?

1159
01:19:55,923 --> 01:19:58,803
Here is my number in Paris.

1160
01:19:59,008 --> 01:20:01,248
Call me.

1161
01:20:01,424 --> 01:20:04,304
This time, let's not lose touch.

1162
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:06,071
My rock and roll girl.

1163
01:20:06,217 --> 01:20:08,697
The colors are great at sunset.

1164
01:20:09,008 --> 01:20:12,008
It's an ochre quarry.

1165
01:20:12,175 --> 01:20:14,615
It's sculpted by nature.

1166
01:20:15,843 --> 01:20:17,843
We're leaving, Mommy?

1167
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,448
Loli, wait!

1168
01:20:30,804 --> 01:20:33,084
Are you happy now? You won.

1169
01:20:33,304 --> 01:20:36,024
Oh, and you're not at fault here?

1170
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:38,420
Piss me off
and you're walking home!

1171
01:20:39,513 --> 01:20:42,273
Guess I'm taking a cab after all.

1172
01:21:05,143 --> 01:21:08,263
I'm fed up with the situation.

1173
01:21:12,602 --> 01:21:14,642
I'm hurting you.

1174
01:21:14,852 --> 01:21:17,572
I've lied to you both.

1175
01:21:17,769 --> 01:21:20,209
It's not that I don't love her.

1176
01:21:22,062 --> 01:21:25,662
But I want it to be
just you and me.

1177
01:21:27,604 --> 01:21:29,204
It's my fault.

1178
01:21:29,354 --> 01:21:32,874
No, it's my fault.
I screwed up first.

1179
01:21:34,855 --> 01:21:38,055
I just want to hold you in my arms.

1180
01:21:38,439 --> 01:21:42,559
Don't worry.
There'll be no fights.

1181
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:47,542
- Give me the phone.
- I don't want to speak to her.

1182
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:09,650
She won't see you anymore.

1183
01:22:11,027 --> 01:22:13,587
You'd better leave now.

1184
01:22:19,903 --> 01:22:22,023
I'd like to hear it from her.

1185
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,870
Don't make it any harder on her.

1186
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:27,591
It's over.

1187
01:22:29,697 --> 01:22:31,537
She said so?

1188
01:22:31,698 --> 01:22:33,698
Didn't you hear?

1189
01:22:33,864 --> 01:22:35,864
She won't even speak to you.

1190
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:38,351
She wants to be with me and the kids.

1191
01:22:38,531 --> 01:22:41,051
Back to normal.

1192
01:22:41,282 --> 01:22:43,122
I'll let her tell me herself.

1193
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:48,519
She'll never leave me,
so why bust our balls?

1194
01:22:48,784 --> 01:22:50,624
You've done enough.

1195
01:22:52,075 --> 01:22:53,915
The game's not over.

1196
01:22:54,075 --> 01:22:55,915
There are three periods.

1197
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:08,439
I thought it over.

1198
01:23:08,662 --> 01:23:10,062
I'll leave.

1199
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,960
Are you stoned...

1200
01:23:14,162 --> 01:23:15,802
or really leaving?

1201
01:23:17,329 --> 01:23:20,929
I'm a bit high,
but I'm really leaving.

1202
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:25,070
- Happy?
- It's hard to contain my joy.

1203
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:28,010
But on one condition.

1204
01:23:28,207 --> 01:23:29,807
What?

1205
01:23:30,998 --> 01:23:34,718
Tonight, you give me a child.

1206
01:23:43,124 --> 01:23:45,684
I'm 40. I have no time to lose.

1207
01:23:46,584 --> 01:23:48,184
You're asking me?

1208
01:23:48,376 --> 01:23:50,856
I could do worse.

1209
01:23:51,042 --> 01:23:54,362
You're handsome.
I know your background.

1210
01:23:54,627 --> 01:23:56,867
You won't nag me.

1211
01:23:57,502 --> 01:24:00,142
Why should I agree?

1212
01:24:02,128 --> 01:24:04,248
Loli's back tomorrow...

1213
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:06,580
and we're bound
to get back together.

1214
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,560
I know it's beyond you...

1215
01:24:09,713 --> 01:24:13,153
but one phone call can't erase
what's between us.

1216
01:24:18,297 --> 01:24:21,217
I'm not forcing you.
That'd be hard.

1217
01:24:21,464 --> 01:24:23,784
It's up to you.

1218
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:26,820
Either pass...

1219
01:24:27,007 --> 01:24:29,767
or assume you have the better hand.

1220
01:24:31,799 --> 01:24:33,639
It's like a game.

1221
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,680
- Could be fun.
- Get out.

1222
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08,630
You'll be out of our lives.

1223
01:25:11,847 --> 01:25:13,847
We never see you again.

1224
01:25:15,182 --> 01:25:16,782
Ever.

1225
01:25:18,432 --> 01:25:20,272
Even if it doesn't work.

1226
01:25:21,432 --> 01:25:25,192
And I pray it won't,
for the kid's sake.

1227
01:25:25,433 --> 01:25:27,433
I give you my word.

1228
01:25:30,517 --> 01:25:32,357
Want a toke?

1229
01:25:32,559 --> 01:25:35,079
To muster up some courage...

1230
01:25:35,351 --> 01:25:36,791
partner.

1231
01:25:51,645 --> 01:25:55,685
Let's go.
The missionary position.

1232
01:25:55,937 --> 01:25:57,097
How fitting.

1233
01:25:57,229 --> 01:25:59,869
I have to get it up somehow.

1234
01:26:01,396 --> 01:26:04,276
Not an enticing prospect.

1235
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:27,259
You have to touch me a little.

1236
01:26:29,318 --> 01:26:30,878
Yeah.

1237
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:32,547
Purely mechanical.

1238
01:26:37,028 --> 01:26:39,068
That hurt!

1239
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:40,317
Sorry.

1240
01:26:40,485 --> 01:26:42,525
I'm not used to this.

1241
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,120
I'm a virgin.

1242
01:26:49,528 --> 01:26:51,328
Funny, huh?

1243
01:26:52,072 --> 01:26:54,592
Am I your first virgin?

1244
01:26:54,822 --> 01:26:58,262
My second. I married the first.

1245
01:26:59,239 --> 01:27:00,999
Lucky bastard.

1246
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:03,118
Here's what we'll do:

1247
01:27:03,282 --> 01:27:07,602
Close our eyes
and both think real hard of Loli.

1248
01:27:11,033 --> 01:27:14,993
That way we might just manage.

1249
01:27:15,283 --> 01:27:17,083
Especially me.

1250
01:27:57,124 --> 01:27:58,644
She's gone.

1251
01:28:18,751 --> 01:28:22,551
We'll be happy.
You'll see how happy we'll be.

1252
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:47,452
Miss? I'd like a water and...

1253
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:49,980
a club sandwich.

1254
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:53,910
It's a small world.

1255
01:28:54,111 --> 01:28:55,871
Remember me?

1256
01:28:56,486 --> 01:28:58,006
Of course.

1257
01:29:02,993 --> 01:29:04,183
Any news of Marijo?

1258
01:29:04,425 --> 01:29:06,635
Oh yes, she's fine.
It's due next month.

1259
01:29:07,701 --> 01:29:08,652
What's due?

1260
01:29:09,095 --> 01:29:10,052
Why, her baby!

1261
01:29:13,364 --> 01:29:15,562
Didn't you know?

1262
01:29:15,906 --> 01:29:17,746
Loli's back in two days.

1263
01:29:19,156 --> 01:29:21,396
To see her brother. Just a day.

1264
01:29:23,032 --> 01:29:26,792
How're the kids?
Not too rough on you?

1265
01:29:29,116 --> 01:29:31,916
See you Thursday.
Good-bye, Dad.

1266
01:29:32,168 --> 01:29:33,704
He's waiting for you.

1267
01:29:33,806 --> 01:29:34,107
Come in, miss. Don't be afraid.

1268
01:29:50,946 --> 01:29:52,790
Are you looking for an appartment?

1269
01:29:52,904 --> 01:29:56,978
We've met, you know.

1270
01:29:58,179 --> 01:30:01,201
Strange, I really don't recall.
I should remember...

1271
01:30:01,701 --> 01:30:03,128
such a charming girl!

1272
01:30:05,187 --> 01:30:06,387
Don't I look familiar?

1273
01:30:07,779 --> 01:30:09,892
Well, I'd love to say you do...

1274
01:30:10,569 --> 01:30:11,436
What's your name?

1275
01:30:15,638 --> 01:30:17,862
A pretty name for
such a pretty face!

1276
01:30:19,097 --> 01:30:23,056
How about a drink?
There's a nice bar next door?

1277
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:29,391
I'll be back soon.

1278
01:30:30,522 --> 01:30:33,171
Just long enough for a flirt,
so you can score tonight?

1279
01:30:35,982 --> 01:30:36,661
Excuse me?

1280
01:30:37,616 --> 01:30:40,675
My name is Christelle Bartavי.
I'm your daughter.

1281
01:30:44,309 --> 01:30:46,844
I wondered if what mom
said about you is true.

1282
01:30:48,346 --> 01:30:50,241
Now I know.

1283
01:31:12,593 --> 01:31:14,417
Hi honey. How is everything?

1284
01:31:14,753 --> 01:31:17,058
You make a child behind my back!

1285
01:31:16,758 --> 01:31:19,638
What about me? What about me?

1286
01:31:19,842 --> 01:31:21,242
Stop screaming.

1287
01:31:21,425 --> 01:31:24,305
You lied to me.
Once again you lied!

1288
01:31:24,509 --> 01:31:29,236
I'll get the next plane to Paris
and meet you at the station.

1289
01:31:40,062 --> 01:31:43,300
See, Antoine... you always
have to pay for bullshit.

1290
01:31:44,223 --> 01:31:45,728
I just got the check too.

1291
01:31:51,055 --> 01:31:52,775
She didn't rape you!

1292
01:31:52,931 --> 01:31:54,291
In a way, yes!

1293
01:31:54,431 --> 01:31:55,711
Don't bullshit me!

1294
01:31:55,847 --> 01:31:59,127
Why didn't you tell her to split,
Ms. Courage?

1295
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:02,790
Cut it out.
I didn't ask you to sleep with her.

1296
01:32:03,098 --> 01:32:06,378
Why stir shit up now?
It's over.

1297
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,520
I want to clear it up.

1298
01:32:08,684 --> 01:32:10,724
Listen to your bullshit!

1299
01:32:10,933 --> 01:32:12,813
I say bullshit? You do it!

1300
01:32:12,975 --> 01:32:14,055
Bastard!

1301
01:32:14,225 --> 01:32:16,585
- Where is she?
- In the 15th district.

1302
01:32:16,767 --> 01:32:20,167
Look at the line of jerks
waiting for a cab!

1303
01:32:20,435 --> 01:32:22,795
I'm not going.

1304
01:32:22,976 --> 01:32:24,656
Oh, yes, you are!

1305
01:32:24,811 --> 01:32:27,091
Let go. You're a real pain.

1306
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:28,990
Hey, my cab!

1307
01:32:29,144 --> 01:32:31,664
What the hell!

1308
01:32:31,895 --> 01:32:34,175
Fuck off, asshole!
Take the cab!

1309
01:32:37,104 --> 01:32:39,824
- Please.
- It's private, sir.

1310
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:41,620
You let my wife in.

1311
01:32:41,771 --> 01:32:45,571
I choose who I let in.
Move out of the way.

1312
01:32:45,814 --> 01:32:47,054
Peeping Tom!

1313
01:32:47,189 --> 01:32:50,189
I didn't fly 500 miles
to be kicked out.

1314
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:53,640
Don't you get it, dude? No men!

1315
01:33:32,654 --> 01:33:35,254
How was it with Laurent?

1316
01:33:36,113 --> 01:33:37,433
Painful.

1317
01:33:40,447 --> 01:33:42,607
I'm glad to see you.

1318
01:33:52,157 --> 01:33:56,597
Some asshole says he knows you.
What is it about?

1319
01:33:56,908 --> 01:33:58,228
Coming!

1320
01:33:59,575 --> 01:34:02,815
- Who's the broad?
- Fabienne. Who's the jerk?

1321
01:34:03,075 --> 01:34:04,875
Excuse me, miss.

1322
01:34:07,410 --> 01:34:08,730
Sorry.

1323
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:17,860
Excuse me, miss, I only...

1324
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:20,839
Hey, wrong club.

1325
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:29,430
- You're back with her.
- Not at all.

1326
01:34:29,621 --> 01:34:32,261
- You can tell me.
- No way!

1327
01:34:32,454 --> 01:34:35,174
But I need to eat,
to eat for two.

1328
01:34:35,373 --> 01:34:36,733
Hey.

1329
01:34:38,415 --> 01:34:40,815
I'm sorry. Loli made me come.

1330
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:44,440
I made you come!
She made you sire a child!

1331
01:34:44,665 --> 01:34:46,185
It's never your fault.

1332
01:34:46,373 --> 01:34:48,533
I never thought it'd work.

1333
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:52,351
Cut it out!
I'm fine. No problem.

1334
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:54,545
How are you going to raise the baby?

1335
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:57,030
In the club? What a life!

1336
01:34:57,208 --> 01:34:59,048
Loli, that's my problem.

1337
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:01,133
No, it's ours!

1338
01:35:01,293 --> 01:35:03,213
I'm behind this baby too!

1339
01:35:03,376 --> 01:35:05,936
She can't stay.
She's coming home.

1340
01:35:06,127 --> 01:35:08,687
- What?
- She's better off with us.

1341
01:35:08,919 --> 01:35:12,519
No way! She wanted the kid.
It's none of my concern.

1342
01:35:12,794 --> 01:35:15,034
Who asked you?
You've done enough!

1343
01:35:15,254 --> 01:35:18,174
A child needs
a mother and a father!

1344
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:21,061
Wait.
Have I got a say in this?

1345
01:35:21,296 --> 01:35:24,656
- What?
- I don't want a thing from you!

1346
01:35:25,964 --> 01:35:28,484
What are you doing?
What about the music?

1347
01:35:28,714 --> 01:35:30,874
What have you been up to?

1348
01:35:31,089 --> 01:35:33,449
Just hanging out with friends.

1349
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:38,000
- That's the sperm bank?
- What's her problem?

1350
01:35:38,257 --> 01:35:41,937
And that's the love of your life?
Great couple.

1351
01:35:42,174 --> 01:35:44,654
Is that what's
going to raise our child?

1352
01:35:44,882 --> 01:35:46,322
Over my dead body!

1353
01:35:46,466 --> 01:35:49,946
Who took care of her
when you dumped her?

1354
01:35:50,217 --> 01:35:51,337
Little bitch!

1355
01:35:51,467 --> 01:35:53,587
- Stop it!
- I'll get upset!

1356
01:35:53,801 --> 01:35:56,281
- I'll get upset!
- Back off, Loli!

1357
01:35:56,386 --> 01:35:59,256
No dick has ever entered
here in over 5 years...

1358
01:35:59,412 --> 01:36:02,089
so piss off, you and your bitch!

1359
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:04,975
The bitch is gonna
punch your lights out!

1360
01:36:05,365 --> 01:36:07,525
Come on, little tart! Come on!

1361
01:36:07,699 --> 01:36:09,499
- Loli, stop!
- You hear me!

1362
01:36:09,657 --> 01:36:10,697
Get her out!

1363
01:36:12,451 --> 01:36:13,571
Hold my ring.

1364
01:36:15,534 --> 01:36:16,574
In the nose.

1365
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:18,180
My ring.

1366
01:36:19,743 --> 01:36:22,663
She broke my nose!
I'm gonna kill her!

1367
01:36:22,868 --> 01:36:26,988
I never want to see you again, Marijo!
Just move out!

1368
01:36:27,285 --> 01:36:31,245
And don't come back!
I'll toss your shit out!

1369
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:34,214
Right out the window!

1370
01:36:34,494 --> 01:36:38,334
What are you staring at?
There's nothing to see.

1371
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:40,830
The bleeding's stopped.

1372
01:36:40,996 --> 01:36:42,916
Feel better?

1373
01:36:43,413 --> 01:36:45,533
- Come on.
- What's with you?

1374
01:36:45,705 --> 01:36:48,105
We're going home.

1375
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:51,610
We can't leave Marijo like this!

1376
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:53,790
- Asshole!
- Where'll she go?

1377
01:36:53,998 --> 01:36:56,878
- Who cares?
- Don't you care about your baby?

1378
01:36:57,124 --> 01:36:58,404
No! Come on.

1379
01:36:58,540 --> 01:36:59,820
Let go!

1380
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:04,228
What's wrong?

1381
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:06,615
It hurts!

1382
01:37:06,833 --> 01:37:09,473
- Take it easy.
- Now what?

1383
01:37:09,667 --> 01:37:13,787
She's going to give birth
on the street! Help me!

1384
01:37:14,084 --> 01:37:16,044
Come! Quick!

1385
01:37:16,293 --> 01:37:18,653
Take it easy. Relax.

1386
01:37:18,877 --> 01:37:21,077
- What'll we do?
- See the bench?

1387
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,972
Come on. Grab her shoulders.

1388
01:37:24,169 --> 01:37:27,009
Get her bag. The shoulders.
Hurry!

1389
01:37:27,211 --> 01:37:29,091
Okay. Coming!

1390
01:37:29,295 --> 01:37:31,735
Grab her legs.

1391
01:37:31,962 --> 01:37:33,762
- A bloody whale!
- Sorry.

1392
01:37:33,963 --> 01:37:36,403
It's your child she's carrying!

1393
01:37:36,629 --> 01:37:38,429
Don't fight over me.

1394
01:37:45,422 --> 01:37:47,262
There. It's okay.

1395
01:37:48,673 --> 01:37:51,353
Go get an ambulance.

1396
01:37:54,132 --> 01:37:55,252
Where? Where?

1397
01:37:55,382 --> 01:37:57,862
Where? I'm gonna sock you one!

1398
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:02,570
Take care of her. I'll find one.

1399
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,360
- Don't go!
- I'll be back.

1400
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:11,976
What's wrong?

1401
01:38:12,176 --> 01:38:14,216
My water is breaking.

1402
01:38:14,428 --> 01:38:17,548
- That's normal.
- I'm scared.

1403
01:38:17,802 --> 01:38:20,722
- It happens to all women.
- I'm scared!

1404
01:38:21,011 --> 01:38:23,651
I don't want to lose my baby!

1405
01:38:23,845 --> 01:38:24,845
I'm here!

1406
01:38:25,012 --> 01:38:27,292
I want it to live!

1407
01:38:27,512 --> 01:38:29,672
To live, Laurent.

1408
01:38:29,847 --> 01:38:32,047
Some are even born at six months.

1409
01:38:37,889 --> 01:38:39,409
I'm here.

1410
01:39:03,227 --> 01:39:05,067
See you later.

1411
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:21,959
Bye, Manuela.

1412
01:39:23,188 --> 01:39:24,948
My little angel.

1413
01:39:37,357 --> 01:39:39,197
Can I have her?

1414
01:39:44,108 --> 01:39:46,348
Look, it's Daddy.

1415
01:39:46,525 --> 01:39:49,525
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, Manuela.

1416
01:39:49,775 --> 01:39:51,855
Don't forget the diapers.

1417
01:39:52,026 --> 01:39:53,866
Ten pounders, pink.

1418
01:39:56,692 --> 01:39:59,212
- She's hungry.
- I'll feed her.

1419
01:40:01,527 --> 01:40:04,687
Look, Daddy's leaving.

1420
01:40:04,902 --> 01:40:06,742
Say bye to Daddy.

1421
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:09,790
Bye, Daddy.

1422
01:40:10,154 --> 01:40:11,594
May I help you, sir?

1423
01:40:11,778 --> 01:40:15,138
I'm Mr. Lafaye
from the real estate agency.

1424
01:40:15,363 --> 01:40:16,883
Come in.

1425
01:40:19,779 --> 01:40:21,259
Follow me.

1426
01:40:24,531 --> 01:40:26,571
I'll tell him you're here.

1427
01:40:35,492 --> 01:40:37,249
It's the real estate agent.

1428
01:40:44,158 --> 01:40:46,518
I'm here.

1429
01:40:46,742 --> 01:40:48,422
Hello.

1430
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:54,130
I called yesterday.

1431
01:40:56,078 --> 01:40:59,478
Sorry to meet you so early.
My plane leaves at 10:00.

1432
01:41:18,226 --> 01:41:19,466
Found a buyer?

1433
01:41:19,601 --> 01:41:22,401
Yes. Me.
If we strike a deal.

1434
01:41:22,902 --> 01:41:23,594
Why not?

1435
01:41:27,706 --> 01:41:29,106
I'll give you a tour.

1436
01:41:33,999 --> 01:41:36,959
You're standing on my robe.

1437
01:41:38,667 --> 01:41:40,467
I'm so sorry.

1438
01:41:43,709 --> 01:41:45,229
Thanks.

1439
01:41:49,043 --> 01:41:50,963
Want something to drink?

1440
01:42:03,567 --> 01:42:05,687
It breaks my heart to leave.

1441
01:42:07,567 --> 01:42:09,567
So many memories.

1442
01:42:12,568 --> 01:42:14,808
If we agree, you'll stay.

1443
01:42:17,152 --> 01:42:19,432
I mean for a visit. No...

1444
01:42:21,861 --> 01:42:23,661
You'll always be welcome.

1445
01:42:24,904 --> 01:42:26,184
Beware.

1446
01:42:28,571 --> 01:42:30,491
I just might.

1447
01:42:49,094 --> 01:42:51,334
Are you... Spanish?

1448
01:42:51,554 --> 01:42:53,394
Yes. You know Spain?

1449
01:42:53,596 --> 01:42:56,356
- My wife's from Barcelona.
- So am I.

1450
01:42:57,513 --> 01:42:58,513
That's funny.

1451
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:02,020
Were you a good girl?

1452
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:05,100
Yes, she was a very good girl.

1453
01:43:05,348 --> 01:43:07,308
Did you have your bottle?

1454
01:43:11,738 --> 01:43:12,433
What's your name?

1455
01:43:15,515 --> 01:43:17,317
I'm Diego.

1456
01:43:18,195 --> 01:43:18,990
To you, Laurent.

1457
01:43:22,103 --> 01:43:22,994
You understand?

1458
01:43:23,032 --> 01:43:24,649
Cheers?

1459
01:43:25,146 --> 01:43:26,462
Almost.

1460
01:43:35,297 --> 01:43:36,440
I understand.

1461
01:43:36,488 --> 01:43:39,884
I'll be back on Saturday.
Will you be here?

1462
01:43:43,645 --> 01:43:44,710
I will.

1463
01:43:46,064 --> 01:43:49,744
Salut i forחa al canut!

1464
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,512
A lot of "forחa" !

1465
01:43:52,305 --> 01:44:52,188
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
