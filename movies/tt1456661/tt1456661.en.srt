00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,190
Legend of Chen Zhen

-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.org ] ==-

3
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,080
Europe. France 1917

4
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,730
The frontline is dangerous, we need 10 more people now...

5
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,810
No more ammo!

6
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,730
Move it, quick.

7
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,320
Tiansheng, dont be scared.

8
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,290
Calm down, calm down.

9
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,500
We will make it back to China...we can't die here.

10
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,750
Everyone don't be scared, continue forward

11
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,170
Do not go back, march forward.

12
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,590
My lucky charm.

13
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,130
It will protect you.

14
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,340
Brothers, let's move forward.

15
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,680
Lets go!

16
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:38,850
Lets go!

17
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,320
Quickly!

18
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,950
Commander, ammo is here.

19
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,080
Why are the French retreating?

20
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,510
Chen Zhen...

21
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Help me.

22
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,180
Chen Zhen!

23
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,320
Germans are here, damn it.

24
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,140
Everyone alright? anyone hurt?

25
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,640
Chen Zhen, lucky to have you here.

26
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,140
Brother Chen, I'm okay.

27
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,690
Thanks to your lucky charm.

28
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,560
Thank heaven, thank god.

29
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,490
I must go home.

30
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,120
Tiansheng...

31
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,410
I must go home.

32
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,830
I'll kill all of you!

33
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,130
I must go home.

34
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Everyone get down.

35
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,930
We cannot die here.

36
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,830
Mr. Liu!

37
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,590
Thank you.

38
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,590
- Owner Liu, business is good huh?.
- You guys please enjoy.

39
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,150
Boss, look, every night it's like this.

40
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,570
Who would believe there's a war going on.

41
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,650
It's crazy out there,

42
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,780
they dont come here, then where else?

43
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,700
Everyone, my brother says he has war news from the front.

44
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,120
He says, General Zhou will defeat Commander Zeng.

45
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's news that Commander Zeng retreated.

46
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,630
If General Zhou wins, China will be unified.

47
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,340
Not for sure yet.

48
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,220
The British, Japanese are still behind Commander Zeng

49
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,510
Both do not wish China to be unified.

50
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,350
Are you kidding?

51
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,850
You've been to Taiwan?

52
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,060
Japan invaded Taiwan.

53
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,190
You fight back, and get terminated.

54
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,270
You still want to fight back?

55
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,230
History books won't even record your name.

56
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,860
If this continues, Taiwan will become Japan

57
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,280
Also, China is not under Chinese control

58
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,330
Eventually, I think either the Brits or Japanese will win.

59
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,910
Don't forget

60
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,370
More chaos here, more prosperity for us.

61
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,570
Tell her to sing this song.

62
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,610
Kiki, sing us a Japanese song.

63
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,030
Kiki.

64
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,170
Come on, lets go.

65
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,780
Thank you.

66
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,650
Thank you.

67
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,030
Very good, very nice.

68
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,620
Thank you.

69
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,700
Who are you?

70
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,870
Who do you want?

71
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,910
Officers, dont be angry.

72
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,130
Everyone's my guest today, please save this Lu some face

73
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,210
Sit, sit

74
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,210
- Ah Wan
- Yes

75
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,960
I am sorry. Please sit down.

76
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,510
I can't take this, Mr. Liu

77
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,180
Brother, you returned from France?

78
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,680
Correct.

79
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,800
Have a drink.

80
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,930
Thank you Mr. Liu.

81
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,630
Let me ask something...pair is big or three of a kind?

82
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,960
What are you holding?

83
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,470
Three of a kind.

84
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,890
My pair beats your three of a kind.

85
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,020
Come on.

86
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,060
Okay, continue.

87
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,480
Winner winner, chicken dinner

88
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,400
I won

89
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,450
Again

90
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,840
Tiansheng, taking big risk?

91
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,800
Risking my life is okay?

92
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,720
Your Life? How much is it worth?

93
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,680
Not cheaper than yours!

94
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,850
What did you say?

95
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,810
Your life, is it worth this much?

96
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,070
Then my life is yours now.

97
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,200
Who is scared of who?

98
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,330
Three of a kind.

99
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,040
It's over for you.

100
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,670
Two Pair.

101
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,460
Pair can beat three of a kind?

102
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,260
Didn't someone say that moments ago?

103
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,840
You...

104
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,680
Correct?

105
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,640
Sit down...

106
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,180
Okay.

107
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,430
Rules are made by you guys.

108
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,180
Can't take it when someone wins?

109
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,520
Okay.

110
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,400
My brother.

111
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,110
You gave me your money, or your life?

112
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,240
Of course, I need money not life, Mr. Liu.

113
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,110
Okay then.

114
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Drink.

115
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,330
Come on, continue

116
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,420
Drink too much these couple days.

117
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,970
Cant drink anymore, I have to go back to the hotel

118
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,760
Don't stay in the hotel anymore

119
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,260
move in here

120
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,520
Don't be a stranger

121
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,230
Don't mention it

122
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,980
Okay, Thank you Mr. Lu.

123
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,660
You're here?

124
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,040
Didn't you say this room's for me to watch the sunrise?

125
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,080
It's only 3... no sunrise yet

126
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,590
Let me introduce my brother, Qin Tiansheng.

127
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,460
This is Kiki.

128
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,380
Then now you got more brothers than wives

129
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,640
What am I to do?

130
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,310
You are married to me, you should know what to do

131
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,520
What about other mistresses?

132
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,770
They're one night stands, you're my main chick

133
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,360
When they are all gone, we can continue this talk

134
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,290
Have a drink!
- Next time perhaps

135
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,460
I drank a lot tonight, thanks Miss

136
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,000
He drank a lot, let me.

137
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,550
Then I won't bother you two

138
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,640
I'll go first

139
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,520
Ah Wan's downstairs, he'll see you out.

140
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,600
Thank you.

141
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,070
Your girlfriend's cold.

142
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,530
You interested?

143
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,240
If you have it, take it. I'm afraid you can't control yourself

144
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,210
That's you, Mr. Liu.

145
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,210
Really?

146
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,170
Good night

147
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,300
Thank you Mr. Liu.

148
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,460
You are welcome.

149
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,600
You hang out with Liu Yiutian now?

150
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,680
If so, you'll be famous

151
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,730
This keeps up, then it will be too dangerous

152
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,690
This is small part of the plan

153
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,690
No, getting close to Liu Yiutian is a big part already

154
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,780
He can't trust you that quickly

155
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,990
Be careful

156
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,110
Liu Yiutian, this person...

157
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,660
you think he can do big things?

158
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:31,200
Also... he has ties to the underground

159
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,660
After all, he is still Chinese

160
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,170
Our force is not strong enough...

161
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,380
...to face the Japanese

162
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,630
We must encourage every single Chinese

163
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,430
The more power Liu Yiutian has, the more valuable

164
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,720
Thus, if we and the underground...

165
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,470
established ties...

166
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,350
It will be beneficial to us.

167
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,060
I contacted some sailor brothers from France for help

168
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,400
Don't worry

169
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,440
Don't forget our school mates

170
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,530
Every Chinese is together on this

171
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,120
But our country cannot be unified

172
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,240
At least, for now..

173
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,210
I believe we can do it. We can.

174
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,640
Master, why did you start Jing Wu School?

175
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,150
To protect the homeland, Chen Zhen.

176
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,700
France. 1917.

177
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,210
Tian Yuan, we almost made it to China.

178
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,750
You stay here and rest.

179
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,960
Tian Yuan will go back to China with us.

180
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,300
Chen Zhen can't go home now.

181
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,470
But Qin Tiansheng can.

182
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,430
China's Battlefield.

183
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,900
I got news from France.

184
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,530
England intercepted news about our troop movement

185
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,820
Besides me, only 3 of you know.

186
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,160
Who made the mistake?

187
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,830
Sir, I never left base.

188
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,390
You all listen...

189
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,260
Japanese soldier, must have courage

190
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,060
Yes.

191
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,150
Sisters, boss is here

192
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,320
Now, bottoms up!

193
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,360
Whose birthday is it?

194
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,440
Whose birthday is not important.

195
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,070
It's important that you invite us for a drink

196
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,070
Okay, let's drink

197
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,990
Ah Chi.

198
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,950
Your boss has ways with the ladies.

199
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,370
He is very wealthy in Shanghai.

200
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,870
Wearing white is Wei Wei.

201
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,870
You, come here!

202
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,080
I have to go now...

203
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,580
General Zeng's lover...keep eyes on her.

204
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,790
He's here!

205
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,630
Not at the battlefield?

206
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,300
He's back, at Duy Quinh Place

207
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,590
Told me to come over

208
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,720
Shall I call a car for you?

209
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,850
No need. He sent a driver

210
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,140
He will pick me up

211
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,390
Drink one, then go

212
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,310
Give her one shot

213
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,650
Hong Lan

214
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,360
Any left?

215
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,610
Sorry sister Kiki, I just sold out.

216
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,660
I'll go buy one for you, okay?

217
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,780
Okay

218
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,380
Mr. Qin, see you.

219
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,140
Lady Duy, General is waiting upstairs.

220
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,180
Okay

221
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,150
Sir, we have located General Zhou and General Zeng of the NE army

222
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,780
My people are ready, waiting for your orders

223
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,120
General Zhou, hello!
Arrived? Hello!

224
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,160
Long time, sit sit

225
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,950
It's cold outside, lets eat hot pot

226
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,370
We just talking nonsense to relax

227
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,420
General Zeng

228
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,340
Tell me, your troops against mine... who will win?

229
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,600
You'd win

230
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,940
What if the Japanese help you

231
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,030
If so, I would surrender

232
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,570
I only use the Japanese

233
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,870
They are a bunch of bastards

234
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,500
The Japanese won't give you the time.

235
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,670
Things are critical now

236
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,170
Some already moved to Europe.

237
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,090
Honestly, I don't want to fight the NE army.

238
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,890
But, your army can't be helping the China government.

239
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,140
To be direct

240
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,900
If you withdraw, the army is still yours

241
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,900
I'll stop fighting immediately

242
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,820
What do you think?

243
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,410
Brother Zhou, don't force me.

244
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,540
This reply, is what you want to say to all of China?

245
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,840
General Zhou

246
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,420
General Zeng, forgive me for not seeing things

247
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,880
He trusts you...admires you

248
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,220
Won't you believe in him?

249
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,900
Let me tell you

250
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,610
If he doesn't want to be Japan's dog...

251
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,740
Then he has only got one option

252
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,780
Negotiation

253
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,960
Brother, it's not easy, to get to where China is today

254
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,420
Victory is in sight

255
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,220
Brother Zhou, I need time to tell everyone

256
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,430
Give me 7 days

257
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,180
Okay

258
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,060
7 days is okay

259
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,610
If...

260
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,440
If they don't listen...

261
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,820
Next time we meet, it will be on the battlefield!

262
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,370
We two, will always be brothers

263
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,000
Bottoms up!

264
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,410
Give me some money

265
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,160
Easy, give me some money

266
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,210
Get lost!

267
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,430
Your majesty!

268
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
Thank you

269
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,680
Protect the General!

270
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,100
Protect the General!

271
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,370
One more skilled fighter

272
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,590
1,2,3,4

273
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,710
5,6

274
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,100
Who is driving that fast? Even the police don't drive THAT fast

275
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,890
Do I know who?

276
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,200
Let's go see

277
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,000
Who? Me?

278
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,540
Is it me every time? Hurry and go!

279
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,750
You go!

280
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,750
Me?

281
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,170
Come here, come here

282
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,020
Make way!

283
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,940
Useless fellow...

284
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,650
Search the crime scene, see who's alive

285
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,740
Go look over there, okay

286
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,620
Go and get killed

287
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,800
Who are you?

288
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,060
You need not know

289
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,180
You. Why did you save me?

290
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,940
I didn't want to save you. I had no choice!

291
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,560
I want to say one thing to you.
"Don't work with the Japanese!"

292
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,230
Don't dig your own grave!

293
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,450
Did General Zhou send him?

294
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,450
No, he isn't that type of person

295
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,210
Then who else knows you're back?

296
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,260
Your Majesty, my men practise day and night

297
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,140
Why want to assassinate his son?

298
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,560
I'm not interested in helping you handle this Zhou, he's not worth much

299
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,020
He only commands the NE army

300
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,390
Only the NE army, what can they do?

301
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,270
What is important, is what Tokyo wants

302
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,650
Only to see China surrender...
To us, that's beneficial

303
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,400
When General Zeng dies

304
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,570
War between General Zeng and Zhou can't be avoided

305
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,950
Just that we messed up

306
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,910
Can't believe a pro fighter appeared

307
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,160
We don't need to dwell on this

308
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,880
Right now what's important is...find out who he is!

309
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,130
Hurry and investigate

310
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,970
A person appeared to fight the mighty Japan!

311
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,720
Let us unite!

312
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,100
Many characters is good for us

313
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,900
We will help with all we got

314
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,230
Read all about it!

315
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,030
Read all about it!

316
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,450
Mysterious man appears to fight back Japan!

317
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,960
How Tai, don't wear black clothes all day

318
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,080
Wanna scare people to death?

319
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,370
Talking about me?
Then who else?

320
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,580
Can you guys guess who this mysterious guy?

321
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,800
I know who he is!

322
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,550
You sound confident, are you?

323
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,800
He didn't escape from the psychiatric ward

324
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,680
This person is here among us

325
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,520
Why are you so sure?

326
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,360
All of Shanghai knows.
I know everything going on in that ward!

327
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,490
You better be careful, maybe you are tired.

328
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,450
Head of a psy ward, scared of someone with a brain?

329
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,830
Maybe...

330
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,620
What happened last night?

331
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,670
You stupid chink!

332
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,550
Where were you yesterday?

333
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,840
You cant believe the news, that's no truth in the paper

334
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,760
Do you know what happened? Who is the mysterious guy?

335
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,840
General

336
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,470
That is weird. We received the same news.

337
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,180
We came to the scene right away

338
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,060
We got there, bodies everywhere

339
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,100
There's 17,18...

340
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,020
Bodies everywhere...

341
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,680
Over there 10...

342
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,730
Who knows, guns started firing

343
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,150
You were holding me!

344
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,530
When we were behind the car, We fired back!

345
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,400
Then we split up...

346
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,780
I'm on the right, he's on the left

347
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,110
I kept firing till I'm out...

348
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,700
Then what?

349
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,620
Out of bullets, at a moment like this...

350
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,660
I jumped from the hood of the car...

351
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,080
Then I jumped to the other side!

352
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,160
I thought I was dead meat...

353
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,380
But I got over in one jump

354
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,300
You think I'm a pig?

355
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,710
Listen to me!

356
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,420
Working too openly is not wise

357
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,090
I think if I pulled the hat down...

358
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,300
Nobody would notice me!

359
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,180
I'm a bad-ass, isn't that right?

360
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,100
You think you are that mysterious guy?

361
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,640
Look at yourself!

362
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,900
You look like a pig!

363
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,110
You stupid chink!

364
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,990
not Chink, it's Chinese.

365
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,110
Whatever, you stupid Chink!

366
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,000
Here's the money...

367
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,250
This is good...

368
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,880
I can go eat with the superiors

369
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,380
Yes, brother, we're here...

370
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,880
Every month it's gonna be like that

371
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,610
Stop staring, you want one too?

372
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,570
Luckily, you're not here yesterday

373
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,490
If not, dressing like this is scary as heck

374
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,290
Don't joke, I have a gun...

375
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,250
GUN

376
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,000
Then why didn't you appear earlier yesterday?

377
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,170
Am I not looking for the right opportunity?

378
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,260
- What did you find out?
- I investigated it all

379
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,470
None of the dead guys had any records

380
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,930
Let me ask you, who's at that bottom of this

381
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,470
I don't know

382
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,930
How are you gonna find a suspect from the dead bodies?

383
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,640
General Zeng returned to Japan

384
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,400
And Wei Wei?

385
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,770
But yesterday, General Zeng was courageous

386
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,440
Preparation is being done at the restaurant

387
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,240
Money?

388
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,290
Next time be careful. Don't drag me in again

389
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,510
Any one suspicious lately?

390
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,680
One new shareholder appeared

391
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,100
ery suspicious individual

392
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,310
Continue

393
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,850
His name is  Qin Tiansheng

394
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,190
Just back from France

395
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,650
Mr. Lu

396
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,150
Even invited him to be a shareholder of the night club

397
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,990
And you?

398
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:21,000
My mission is to stay close and retrieve intel from the British

399
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,130
But more people come in and out everyday

400
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,090
I'll pay more attention to this Tian Yuan

401
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,930
Sorry

402
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,740
Next time, don't come back with no intel

403
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,950
You better watch yourself

404
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,870
I'm sorry

405
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,130
Wei Wei

406
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,220
I thought I would never see everyone again

407
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,340
This is for you

408
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,680
It's perfume and cosmetics

409
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,310
Only sold in Shanghai

410
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,680
I have this

411
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:18,730
Thank you

412
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,190
Thank you everyone

413
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,060
Oh yeah

414
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,230
You told me to bring it

415
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,240
These bracelets...I keep 1, you keep 1

416
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,540
This is from your mom

417
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,130
You are my best friend

418
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,890
Alright, hurry, go go

419
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,790
Get me a box of cigarettes

420
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,960
Yes

421
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,300
Very nice to meet you

422
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:38,730
Sir

423
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,770
enjoy your stay, ok

424
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,650
You dare mess at Mr. Lu place?

425
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,690
It wasn't me

426
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,280
Kiki, your cigarette

427
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,070
Excuse me

428
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:50,910
Bottoms up

429
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,780
We are ready

430
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,960
Mr. Lu, who's the guy with glasses

431
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:05,840
Him?

432
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,420
Businessman from England

433
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,050
High influence, up there with the English government

434
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,550
Quick with info too

435
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,600
Faster than you?

436
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,180
If it's about France, yes

437
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,690
I'm here

438
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,690
Don't go, come here.

439
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,150
Drink a little

440
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,740
Just got here, but stirring things up already...

441
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,820
I want a half day off

442
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,490
Off for what?

443
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,240
Me and him

444
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,240
Go out

445
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,120
You don't care right?

446
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,080
I dont mind

447
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:44,880
Let's go!

448
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,510
Kiki, where I want to go, you need not go

449
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,390
Cause you dare not take me?

450
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,200
This is the General, let's fight

451
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,870
Let's watch

452
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,580
Come here

453
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,960
Any more seats? Who is that?

454
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,460
Anybody else, no. For you, yes.

455
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,420
Brothers, look who's here

456
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,130
Brother, come here

457
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:31,930
Everyone

458
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,220
Kiki

459
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,560
Everyone introduce yourselves!

460
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,600
I am Ta Chong

461
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,690
Fu Hai

462
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:37,690
I'm Chi Hie

463
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:38,640
Da Woh, Ting Hong

464
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,150
Ah Kian

465
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,520
I'm Li Hsieh

466
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,820
Hello

467
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,990
Big Brother, this beautiful lady

468
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,780
Your wife?

469
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,740
Girlfriend!

470
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,750
Lady Kiki, hotpot is okay?

471
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,160
Of course!
Lady Kiki, hotpot is okay?

472
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,080
Of course!

473
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,750
Very good!

474
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,750
Let me ask...

475
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,550
What powers have you got.. to control big brother!

476
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,470
I dance at Casablanca night club ..

477
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,270
That's a hot job in Shanghai right now

478
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
You're the best!

479
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,900
Stop playing

480
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,940
Let's drink!

481
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,780
Big Brother, I wanna ask something

482
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,450
We're happy that you're here today

483
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,160
Let me make the first toast

484
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,660
Let us remember our fallen brothers as well

485
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,460
Let's drink to our good brother...

486
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,540
Chen Zhen

487
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,050
Alright, let's not talk about the past

488
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,090
Come on

489
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:49,930
Let's drink!

490
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,760
Zhi Shan?

491
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,600
Thank you

492
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,190
Kiki, hello

493
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,150
My sister.
- Your sister?

494
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,820
Why is it that you two don't look alike?

495
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,030
Of course we dont!

496
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,990
Cause I'm better looking!

497
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,000
Oh, you said Chen Zhen

498
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,000
The Chen Zhen that defeated Hong Khau ?

499
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,790
Yes

500
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,840
Wasn't he killed by the Japanese ?

501
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,050
He is still alive

502
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,430
There are a lot of rumors that year

503
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,220
But he definitely didn't get killed by the Japanese

504
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,140
He went through life and death with us...

505
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,930
...for 3 long years.

506
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,560
Chen Zhen is my good brother.

507
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:38,940
He is a good brother of ours, ain't that right?

508
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,270
Yes

509
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,270
It's the truth!

510
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,360
Though my eyes are small, I see very well

511
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,490
Chen Zhen is a bad ass

512
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,570
Really?

513
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,240
Yes, even Tu Dian is not as fast as him

514
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,410
Bottoms up...

515
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,950
Bottoms up!

516
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,000
Let's drink!

517
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,510
Lady Kiki

518
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,050
For you

519
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,180
Thank you!

520
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,470
I won't bother you two

521
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:51,720
Look like me?

522
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,270
It's good here...

523
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,270
Everyone's kind-hearted

524
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,770
No one is trying to deceive you...

525
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,480
or put on a front.

526
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,440
Living like this is nice

527
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,490
Yes

528
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,550
Stick, tiger, egg...

529
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,600
Tiger!

530
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,810
You lost

531
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,480
I let you win!

532
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,810
We've reached your home

533
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,110
Thank you

534
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,510
Thank you

535
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,060
Who are you?

536
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,200
I count to 3, I'll shoot if you don't tell me

537
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,450
One

538
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,240
Two

539
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:33,750
Three

540
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,460
You drank a lot

541
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,090
Too much

542
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,170
I'm going in

543
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,180
You carry a gun everyday?

544
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,390
Shanghai is a complicated place

545
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,810
Mr. Lu let us have them for protection

546
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,030
Handsome, let me have your signature

547
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,530
Signing is not needed, but you can keep it

548
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,040
Then it's my reward for the day

549
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,830
Thank you!

550
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,840
Who are you... really?

551
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,140
Your real name...

552
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,930
Feng Ching

553
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:30,930
Lady Feng Ching

554
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:48,740
The Japanese map must be completed quickly

555
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,580
Must deliver in 2 days

556
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,710
What the situation regarding the artifacts?

557
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,330
Here is the map of China's artifacts

558
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,880
Lots of valuable things

559
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,420
Okay, take as much as you can

560
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,760
Destroy anything you can't

561
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,630
Valuable sources like this...

562
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,350
...in the hands of China, is such a waste!

563
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,850
This country should be under Japan's control

564
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,810
Colonel, classified news from Japan

565
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,110
Killed this many?

566
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,530
To kill this many in 1 month

567
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:24,320
even using all of our manpower

568
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,410
it is not possible.

569
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:31,250
To achieve Japan's dream, We must do justice.

570
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:34,500
We just need extra effort

571
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,960
This list...

572
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,380
contains those who publicly oppose Japan

573
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,430
Cannot let it leak out

574
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:47,760
If not, Japan's killings would only increase

575
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:50,350
So England and U.S would do nothing?

576
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,980
When is Japan moving their troops here?

577
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,850
Any word from England and U.S?

578
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,270
No

579
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,570
When Japan set their troops here

580
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,480
They only want to benefit from  it

581
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,280
Don't forget, this country is victorious in war

582
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,200
But England, U.S, France

583
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:06,530
Let Japan have Taiwan island

584
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,160
Without any talk or consideration

585
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,700
Only seeing to their own benefits

586
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,090
Headlines!

587
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:17,960
Japan's assignations

588
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,760
Spark Radio reporting

589
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,050
List of Japanese assasinations

590
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:26,220
Killed for opposing...

591
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,640
Jack Taylor...

592
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,100
John Hanneke...

593
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,060
Robert Wendon...

594
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:36,190
Do Wen Chiu... He Chang... Ji Yong...

595
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,030
This has already happened

596
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,070
I want to know, what you guys are doing about it

597
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,120
Sit

598
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:51,750
We had a meeting this morning

599
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,380
We were expecting something like this

600
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,500
Following it very closely

601
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,130
Not a big deal

602
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,920
Don't just say it

603
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:03,010
I already know what you're gonna do

604
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,390
Talk to a superior?

605
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,100
Talking to your superior is useless

606
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,730
I'm trying to run a business, then this happens

607
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,400
Do you know how much my business...

608
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,030
would be damaged?

609
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,160
Now everyone is worried?

610
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:25,870
All customers are gone

611
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,040
What am I to do?

612
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,250
I want to know what you are doing about it

613
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,290
Go protect people on this list

614
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,300
...or find out who's behind this!

615
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,180
You are the law, so you must do it yourself

616
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,930
Don't depend on that Tien Sun Hei guy

617
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:52,810
Alright, I'm done talking

618
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,110
This is my good brother, Qin Tiansheng

619
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,480
This is Mr Huang

620
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,150
Chief Investigator right? Hello

621
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,200
I'm Huang Ciao Long

622
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:06,620
Boss, the Japanese are here

623
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:07,990
There seems to be a problem

624
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,670
Wait, wait miss pretty...

625
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,590
Please take a seat

626
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,710
They are here

627
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:18,800
Mr. Owner

628
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,550
Sun Qi Chin, hello...

629
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,930
Long time no see

630
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:24,140
Have a smoke

631
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:25,640
Where the girls?

632
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,060
Why are there no girls sitting here?

633
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,060
Sorry

634
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,270
Hurry

635
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,690
Mr. Lu, I'll see to it for you

636
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,230
You can see, but what can you do?

637
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:36,070
You dare kick him out?

638
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,110
Where are the girls?

639
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,150
Right away

640
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,740
Sorry

641
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:42,910
Get them here...what's with you?

642
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:45,700
The beautiful lady is here

643
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,700
Come over here

644
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:48,910
Please sit, sit

645
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,960
You help us translate a bit...

646
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:52,210
Okay, speak

647
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,710
Today, the ladies of Caca...

648
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,210
...all don't want to sit with these Japanese folks

649
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,840
People will die, if you say that Lady Kiki

650
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:00,880
Say it...

651
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,470
Say it!

652
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,760
She says she won't sit with Japanese!

653
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,640
What?
It's nothing!

654
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:08,810
Wait a minute!

655
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:10,440
Wait!

656
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,310
Sorry...Hold it. ..

657
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,940
How's it? I'm here

658
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,270
Let me!
Sit down!

659
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,360
Sorry, I'm Qi Tiansheng.

660
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,660
Nice to meet you!

661
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:26,660
You're Qi Tiansheng, the business partner of Owner Lu right?

662
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,500
Your info is good!

663
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,290
Let me serve you!

664
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:39,470
I'm not only good with info but also like to find things

665
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,760
This man in this picture is also Qin Tiansheng.

666
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,220
I lost this picture a long time ago.

667
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,350
Thank you

668
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,940
No need to thank me. It wasn't hard to find

669
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:55,860
What's hard is telling who's real and who's not

670
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,950
Mr. Qin, Do you know who the green hornet is?

671
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,410
I've heard about this "green hornet" movie..

672
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,450
Not a bad film really!

673
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,460
After this movie came out, the ticket offices are packed

674
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,750
You've seen this movie?

675
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,670
After the kill list came out, you think the Green Hornet would appear?

676
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:20,800
You say the Green Hornet, huh...

677
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,010
Give me a sec, let me think...

678
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,970
YES!

679
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,440
Then let us make a bet!

680
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,610
More people die, or more saved by the Green Hornet...

681
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:37,940
Okay?

682
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:38,990
what are we betting with?

683
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:41,280
A country!

684
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,490
Colonel Chikaraishi, great to have you here

685
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,160
what we betting? a country?

686
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:21,700
My business partner, you guys have met

687
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:23,070
Interesting guy!

688
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:26,830
Owner Lu, why accept Mr. Qin as new shareholder

689
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,250
But denied us in joining you?

690
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:31,040
This small business isn't fit for the Japanese

691
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,170
We want in!

692
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,630
Then you can open another one. Guaranteed that it'll be bigger than this place

693
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,220
You're not afraid of competition?

694
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,050
If your place is a success, we'll close down right away!

695
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,220
The Japanese release of this kill list...

696
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:48,890
besides Chinese, there's British, U.S, and French...What's your explanation?

697
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:50,980
This list is fake!

698
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:51,940
There's someone behind this trying to frame us!

699
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:54,820
Japanese troops are on the move. Are you guys invading China?

700
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:57,190
Does Japan want to start WWII?

701
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,530
My presence here at Casablanca is the best evidence!

702
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,990
Japanese and Chinese are good friends

703
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,410
Me and Owner Lu are good friends

704
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,790
We will never become enemies

705
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:13,130
I have to go. I'll come back when I have time

706
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,840
If you can, don't ever come back!

707
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,020
Mr. Li Tze Men, wait a sec!

708
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:31,560
I think you dropped this...

709
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,400
It's mine. Thank you.

710
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:41,620
Come to Japan sometime

711
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,160
Alright, next time.

712
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,460
Boss, it's alright now

713
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,380
Alright?

714
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:55,800
We just made enemies, and that's alright?

715
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,440
Yên

716
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,260
Expert Lam, go to Hong Kong and hide!

717
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:44,060
Okay, thank you ..

718
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,100
Feng Ting, I'll take you home..

719
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,570
Why is that?

720
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,240
You forgot you upset the Japanese?

721
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,740
There are lots of folks in Shanghai that upset the Japanese

722
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,490
How many can you protect?

723
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:01,990
As many as I can.

724
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,490
Careful!

725
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:54,510
Headlines!

726
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,980
Big Brother, tell the Hoa Chong brothers

727
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:06,480
Ready all our manpower! - Yes!

728
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,560
Combine with the students.

729
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,560
Fight back Japan!

730
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,070
Save our China!

731
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,780
Fight back Japan!

732
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:18,280
Save our China!

733
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:24,200
This is our China... How can I just leave?

734
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:26,120
Just because you say that, we cannot lose you!

735
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:27,120
It's only temporary leave

736
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:28,330
When it's safe, we'll bring you back

737
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,540
Who?
It's me, Hao.

738
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,920
Attacking the old and young, even me.

739
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,090
What did you do?

740
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,380
I told you to protect everyone

741
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,590
Protect the scholars and educated minds

742
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,260
I did follow your list of names

743
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,430
But those people...

744
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,060
...don't wanna leave, what can I do?

745
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,060
Threaten them!

746
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,850
You good at that, right?

747
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,100
What are you doing? Just go, go!

748
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:50,060
Don't push me! I won't push, just go!

749
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,650
You people don't have the right to do this

750
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,570
There're worse things...you wanna try it?

751
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,150
Get on, now!

752
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,490
From the General!

753
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:02,830
After you release this list, a lot of people ran away!

754
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,460
Then, doesn't that solve our problem?

755
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,790
Move aside..

756
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,170
Don't look!

757
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,300
Do not move!

758
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:24,640
3!

759
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:25,600
4!

760
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:26,770
5!

761
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,160
What are you guys doing? Why...

762
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,480
Listen up!

763
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:10,820
British, Americans, Germans must unite

764
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,570
We must show the Japanese who runs Shanghai!

765
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,330
Damn you Japs! Do you hear me!

766
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,370
You bastards!

767
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:23,870
How brave you are!

768
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,610
Ever think about leaving Shanghai?

769
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:58,910
It's not like I've never left Shanghai

770
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,210
This time's different, it's with me.

771
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:05,120
Go where?

772
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,130
Anywhere is fine

773
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,130
When Shanghai is less chaotic

774
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:14,590
I'll take you with me

775
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,220
Right now, you have a lot of things to resolve.

776
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,310
This world has lot of problems...

777
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,150
How you going to resolve them?

778
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:32,530
If everyone leaves just like you...

779
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,620
This place won't exist.

780
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:40,120
With no country, there's still a home

781
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:47,290
You're not afraid of death?

782
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,760
Everyone dies

783
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,720
it's important to die with meaning

784
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:56,390
Right?

785
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,150
When the ships dock, work with each other

786
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,070
Watch the spacing between ships

787
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,530
Now is when we show our nation's force

788
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,000
Going against China's army...

789
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,500
Number is not an issue..

790
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,000
We are for sure stronger!

791
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,040
Correct!

792
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,720
Then let's join together.

793
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,070
Don't you love to write? Keep writing!

794
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,320
Let's see how you write next time?

795
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,110
Chen Zhen..

796
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,570
Don't give up!

797
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:53,790
Boss, Chong from LuShan Times died!

798
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,850
So did the deputy editor...

799
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,560
Search again to be sure!

800
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,590
Your little brother died!

801
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,210
My good war brother taught me this piece

802
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,840
To save our country..

803
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,310
He was sacrificed in a battle with foreigners

804
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,240
Till this day..

805
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:41,820
The sacrifices continues...

806
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:53,050
Long live! Long live! Long live!

807
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:59,680
Japan's 80 planes bombarded the General's battlefield nonstop

808
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,180
Japanese ground troops at Honglong Giang blocks his retreat

809
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,770
Munitions are also destroyed ..

810
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,640
Let us unite, to defeat Japan

811
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:08,770
Fight Back against Japan!

812
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:11,400
Save our China!

813
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,150
These same old sayings, over and over!

814
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:15,820
These sayings are useless!

815
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:16,990
Just get the guns

816
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,490
Don't be rash!

817
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:19,860
To get ammo..

818
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:21,160
Right, that's it. Fight fast, win fast!

819
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,080
Cannot do this idea!

820
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,960
We can't just sit and wait

821
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:32,250
This time we must raise our flags!

822
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,280
Lady, your wine!

823
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:40,410
Thank you!

824
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:57,760
Sorry!

825
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:11,480
You got something to tell me?

826
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:25,080
1 sugar, 2 sugar..

827
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:26,750
No milk?

828
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,010
Why are you here at Casablanca?

829
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:43,140
I'm a dance girl..

830
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,230
So now you won't accept me

831
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:48,310
Wanna know this lowly girl origin?

832
01:08:57,410 --> 01:09:01,370
You do not smoke, why tell Hong Lian to buy them?

833
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,080
I don't know what you're talking about

834
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,430
I really hope you can tell me that you don't work for the Japanese

835
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,720
Don't come back here again!

836
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:02,430
If you come back, I will kill you

837
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:10,590
Let me go!

838
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:12,840
No, don't hurt Kiki!

839
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,380
I am the General's girlfriend!

840
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,800
Anything you wanna say to him, he'll answer you guys

841
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,350
Don't throw Kiki into the water!

842
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,270
Do you guys understand what I'm saying?

843
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:24,350
Kiki, don't be scared!

844
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:26,270
They only want the General to listen to them

845
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:29,940
You know her?

846
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,190
You don't know her!

847
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:37,030
She's not Kiki, she's Sunko Yomei.

848
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,740
She is Japanese.

849
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:42,870
What do you want?

850
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,130
Thu Phe Yen has Yin Tze ..

851
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,090
I have her..

852
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:59,510
Both sides have the best spies

853
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:04,560
You cannot touch her, she's General Zeng's girl!

854
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:06,230
We can still use her..

855
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,270
She can be our hostage..

856
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,030
This is a lowly method... using a woman for blackmail

857
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:14,490
Do you think I'll do it?

858
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,510
This country needs an army to create confusion

859
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:37,760
General Zhou is against the idea of General Zeng working with us

860
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,020
So he sent someone to kill his wife

861
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,520
Sunko Yomei, it is YOU who will make this happen

862
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:05,670
Lt. Sunko Yomei, congratulations for accomplishing this

863
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,750
I will report to my chain of command in Tokyo!

864
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,540
Sorry to bother you!

865
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:43,290
I'm Huang Ciao Long from the police station

866
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:46,880
What do you want?

867
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:50,760
Im here to see Colonel Li Tze Men.

868
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:01,180
My wife.

869
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:17,330
Why so much?

870
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,370
Great, Chen Zhen calls us here, but he doesn't show up!

871
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,370
Alright, our plan depends on 3 main points

872
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:23,790
First, timing...

873
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,880
Since we are splitting up, we must arrive back at the same time!

874
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,500
Second, it's timing!

875
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,300
One extra second is one more danger

876
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:31,010
Third, it's still timing!

877
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,050
Here, hold it!

878
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:33,760
Hurry and go! what you doing here?

879
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:34,850
Come with us!

880
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,680
I've got it here, I'm the Chief Investigator

881
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:37,680
You're useless!

882
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:44,600
Continue!

883
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,400
Hurry!

884
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:46,520
Go!

885
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,330
Why is he here?

886
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,160
He is our country's enemy, that's why!

887
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:40,960
Every Chinese is our enemy!

888
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,500
How many can you imprison here?

889
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:47,500
What are you questioning him about?

890
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:48,840
Nothing.

891
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:56,220
Chen Zhen, you're being sloppy

892
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:02,020
Last year, you killed a man named Li Tze Chong.

893
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,400
That person is my father...

894
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,770
We Chinese are not the Sick Men of Asia

895
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,900
Sir! Something happened at headquarters

896
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:51,110
We Chinese are not the Sick Men of Asia!

897
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:54,990
Release him!

898
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:57,660
I still want a battle of life or death with you...

899
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,290
To revenge my father's death!

900
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:10,970
Hurry!

901
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:18,980
Japanese troops are here! Scram!

902
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:26,070
Hurry! Get out!

903
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:28,610
Over here, quickly!

904
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:30,070
Run!

905
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,450
Hurry, over here!

906
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:39,710
Hide over here!

907
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,500
Hurry! Get in!

908
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:46,960
Hurry!

909
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:55,680
Stop! Don't you run!

910
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,730
Idiot! Where did you place the bombs?

911
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:18,580
Fire! Put out the fire!

912
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,980
Chen Zhen the game ends now!

913
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:57,540
Mr. Qin!

914
01:18:57,790 --> 01:18:58,580
Come and help!

915
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:18,270
Kill!

916
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:53,640
Don't worry, you're Chen Zhen's sister

917
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,430
How can I kill you?

918
01:19:58,190 --> 01:19:58,980
Take her!

919
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:29,220
Move. Make way!

920
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:31,850
Move!

921
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:34,600
You watch here! You come here!

922
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:37,180
Get back, step back. There's nothing to see

923
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:55,700
My people wake up, wake up!

924
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,580
Fight back, save the homeland!

925
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,790
Save our country!

926
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:04,760
Disband Japan!

927
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,930
Our people wake up!

928
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:10,760
Our people wake up!

929
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,140
Save our country!

930
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,320
Special report, Shanghai Radio

931
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:26,700
The North Army attacked General Zhou...
heavy losses

932
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,950
30,000 casualties...

933
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,200
The NE Army is losing hope...

934
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,330
You're having a good sleep!

935
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:39,210
You're good!

936
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:42,920
With the situation like this out there,
you still can sleep

937
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:50,090
Now I think I'm the one running things

938
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:54,060
You're something else, just sleeping

939
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,150
But do you know what time it is now?

940
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:00,730
It's to the brink of disaster out there, Wake up!

941
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:03,400
I can't... I can't handle it all

942
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:05,780
Are you really Chen Zhen?  You need to wake up!

943
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,330
Fight Japan, Save country! Fight Japan, Save Country

944
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,630
Preserve our homeland! Preserve our homeland

945
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,840
Disband Japan! Disband Japan

946
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:25,880
My people wake up!

947
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:28,680
Protect our country!

948
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:30,640
Disband Japan!

949
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:32,140
Okay, okay..stop yelling

950
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,890
You noisy kids, what good does that do?

951
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,520
Go back, go back home!

952
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,770
That is Japan's Territory ahead...

953
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,230
I can't help you all if you cross that line

954
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,360
Who needs your help?

955
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:42,070
We don't need you patrol dogs to help!

956
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:43,610
Right! you all are Japan's lap dogs

957
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:45,190
You do not represent us Chinese!

958
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,570
Besides taking bribes, what else do you do?

959
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:48,780
Don't speak nonsense here!

960
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,410
You all, don't come near!

961
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,830
They fired!

962
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,000
Stop your fire!

963
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:58,080
Who fired?

964
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:01,670
Stop, stop your fire!

965
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:12,970
Stop, stop!

966
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,240
You won't control these students who started firing...

967
01:23:25,490 --> 01:23:27,160
Now you tell me to let them go?

968
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:30,450
No, think about it, where did they get guns?

969
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,740
Must be someone else trying to start things

970
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:34,330
The students must be punished!

971
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,290
If not, how can I socialize with the Japanese?

972
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,000
You socialize with them?

973
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,340
Is this not English territory?

974
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,800
So useless!

975
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,800
You don't want to work here anymore?

976
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:49,100
Stay off!

977
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:55,310
This is China!

978
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,150
It's you that needs to get lost!

979
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:00,860
Let me tell you something, I can't stand you all pale pig skins...

980
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:02,530
Dancing around right in front of my face

981
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:04,280
I really want to tell your superiors

982
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:06,160
How much money do you take from us monthly?

983
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:07,870
Let's see who should get lost

984
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:10,620
Look at you! All day, you copy those dog foreigners

985
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,040
Without us, can you be so relaxed?

986
01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:15,330
Without us, you can do nothing here!

987
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:17,380
You think you get to keep this job, for such a long time?

988
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:20,090
You still want to socialize with the Japanese?

989
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,000
Socialize my ass!

990
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:25,340
What? Something is wrong?

991
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:27,800
Can't understand me?

992
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:30,140
Then let me use English

993
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,060
You are useless!

994
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,310
Let me tell you, our country China has been here for thousands of years

995
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,940
Countless times, foreigners try to invade us

996
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:41,190
We give them only 2 words in the end,
"get lost"!

997
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:42,570
Yeah!

998
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:47,660
Let me free the students...

999
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:50,410
Whatever...

1000
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:12,560
Awake, he's awake

1001
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:13,730
Thank the stars! He is up

1002
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,230
Brother Chen!

1003
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:17,900
He's up, Doctor!

1004
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:18,940
Hurry, come here!

1005
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:26,530
Ting Hong, Fu Hai, Thong Man, Da Woh!

1006
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:28,660
One by one right in front of us..

1007
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:31,500
That's what the Japanese want

1008
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,000
They wanted to show the people of China...

1009
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,790
What should we do now?

1010
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:41,000
When I left, Zhi Shan, she...

1011
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:04,820
I'm okay, brother Chen

1012
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,530
I am really alright...

1013
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:20,340
Headlines! Headlines! General Zhou has lost!

1014
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,430
General Zhou has lost completely...

1015
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,800
Japan and General Zeng joined forces to defeat him

1016
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,390
Both husband and wife are dead!

1017
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,890
And the list of names...

1018
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:36,400
In there, some are dead, some escaped

1019
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:39,020
We've lost, let's surrender...

1020
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,900
Just 2 of us cannot save the world

1021
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:48,660
My brother!

1022
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:10,470
Is it Kiki ? Am I mistaken?

1023
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:22,650
I'm worried. You haven't worked for some time

1024
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:25,200
You look very good in that!

1025
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:28,700
I'm part of the Japan army secret force

1026
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:32,870
Lady General!

1027
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:36,840
Merry Christmas!

1028
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:44,050
I represent the Japanese Army to meet you

1029
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:46,800
I hope you can find one person

1030
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:51,350
This is one of my people?

1031
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,020
I don't know

1032
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:55,190
His name is Chen Zhen

1033
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:57,520
Did Chen Zhen not die?

1034
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,740
We're also holding his accomplice, named Ta Kang

1035
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:08,370
What if I don't give him up?

1036
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,160
In the interest of Japan immigrants...

1037
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,790
We expanded our patrol area of protection to them

1038
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:14,370
Colonel Li Tze Men, he...

1039
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:17,840
has prepared the troops...

1040
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:22,050
Then you're saying, if I can't give you the person..

1041
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,680
You'll find an excuse to fight, right?

1042
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,220
These shameless animals. You need to do this?

1043
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:35,900
You have no other option

1044
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:45,450
You!

1045
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:47,790
We still have...

1046
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:48,790
You!

1047
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:52,330
What's happened?

1048
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:53,250
Keep still!

1049
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:57,750
Now... I have an option

1050
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:05,010
Master, why did you start Jing Wu School?

1051
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:08,140
To protect China, Chen Zhen

1052
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,850
Chen Zhen will win!

1053
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,480
Jing Wu will live forever!

1054
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,520
Chen Zhen will win!

1055
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:36,320
Jing Wu will live forever!

1056
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:04,260
I've been waiting a long time...

1057
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:11,350
10 years of no martial art training

1058
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,690
Everything is the same

1059
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:15,650
Japan is mighty

1060
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,400
There will only be one outcome

1061
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:19,650
We also have one outcome

1062
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,820
You must be crazy!

1063
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:30,120
You promised not to kill him

1064
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:33,710
You need to know one thing

1065
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:36,250
Those who oppose Japan, I will not let them live

1066
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:38,340
Watch her!

1067
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:45,470
And you...

1068
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:50,810
If you don't want to end up like her...

1069
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:54,270
Then you just do what we do

1070
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:02,450
Chen Zhen

1071
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:08,120
Women are just objects for men to use

1072
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:13,130
So our method is, your little sister is...

1073
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:03,050
You all listen...

1074
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:05,020
China is not the Sick Man of Asia

1075
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:17,860
Stop! Everyone get back!

1076
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:19,740
I want to fight him

1077
01:35:55,070 --> 01:35:57,360
Things between us shouldn't have started

1078
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:02,120
Chen Zhen , I hurt you...

1079
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:14,420
Come here!

1080
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:54,800
You...

1081
01:36:58,090 --> 01:36:59,680
What? I'm here!

1082
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:25,100
We'll make it back to China

1083
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:28,190
We'll march forward together.

1084
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:30,980
Our battlefield in China.

1085
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:32,820
We only need to stick together.

1086
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:35,700
No other country, no other man can defeat us

1087
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:37,410
I told you to protect everyone!

1088
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:41,540
We've lost, nothing else we can do...

1089
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,160
Protect our homeland!

1090
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:47,040
Are you not Chen Zhen? Wake up!

1091
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:08,050
General, this way.

1092
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:09,090
Salute!

1092
01:42:10,305 --> 01:43:10,536
