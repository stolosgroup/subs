00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,666
<i>We've got heavy rain
being reported around the region.</i>

3
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,375
<i>But we've got wind gusts
of 30 or 40 miles an hour.</i>

4
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,291
<i>Visibility is poor, so you motorists
be careful out there.</i>

5
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,375
<i>How's it going?</i>

6
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,375
Yeah, you know.

7
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,166
Is Dad there?

8
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,583
<i>He's not going to talk to you.</i>

9
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you think
it would make a difference if I...

10
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,208
- <i>Came home?</i>
- No.

11
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,541
No.

12
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,208
If I write to him.

13
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,500
I've been having bad dreams.

14
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,708
I just want to leave.

15
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,041
I was wrong, okay? I never...

16
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,416
I just want things to go back
to how they were.

17
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Fuck...

18
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,291
<i>Listen, I have to go to work now.</i>

19
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,500
<i>That arrest led investigators...</i>

20
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,958
<i>You there?</i>

21
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,541
<i>Simona?</i>

22
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,166
<i>Simo...</i>

23
00:02:58,916 --> 00:02:59,916
Hello?

24
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:30,833
Hello?

25
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,823
Everybody out.

26
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:44,708
Let's go.

27
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,041
Come on, huh?

28
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:48,916
Come on.

29
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,791
Let's go.

30
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,708
Keep moving.

31
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,916
Let's go.

32
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,333
- Take care.
- You too.

33
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,193
If you want to stay
any longer, I need your ID.

34
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,791
It's been two weeks now.

35
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,750
Yeah. Okay, you'll get it.

36
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,658
Ambar, are you coming?

37
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,875
- We don't want to be late.
- I'll be right there.

38
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,708
Don't mind the mess.
We just took over the place.

39
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,750
We're still fixing it up.

40
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,000
Your, uh, room's just over here.
You have a good view from this floor.

41
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,000
Not that Cleveland's much to look at.

42
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,333
How you finding it?

43
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,833
Uh, yeah, it's nice.

44
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,166
Not been here long, then.

45
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,666
How many others live here?

46
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,375
Uh, you're the second.

47
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,250
Freja's the first.
Her English ain't so good.

48
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,875
Where's she from?

49
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,916
Somewhere they don't speak English.

50
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,791
Uh, ladies only.

51
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,083
No guests after 9:00.

52
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,000
No smoking, no pets.

53
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,166
Okay.

54
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:04,791
Oh...

55
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:11,166
Radiator's off.
Once it's on, one side is warm...

56
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,083
- Oh, sorry.
- Shoot. I got it, I got it.

57
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,791
Are you sure? I can just...

58
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,958
I'll prop that up. Okay.

59
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,750
Don't worry. I'll replace that.

60
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,458
- So, where are you from?
- Uh...

61
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,041
South of here.

62
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,041
How far south?

63
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,041
Not very far.

64
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:34,958
You got a job?

65
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes.

66
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,916
They pay cash?

67
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,916
Yeah.

68
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,833
- One month's rent upfront.
- A month?

69
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,250
You want the room or not?

70
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,291
Key is in the drawer.

71
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,708
Anything else, I'm upstairs, top floor.

72
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,791
Just holler.

73
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,250
Thanks.

74
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,098
<i>Saved messages.</i>

75
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,708
<i>Hi, sweetheart. It's Mama.</i>

76
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,083
<i>Sorry for calling so late.</i>

77
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,208
<i>You know I can't sleep in these beds.</i>

78
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,791
<i>Thank you for today.
I know you have plans,</i>

79
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,750
<i>but I need you to come in tomorrow.</i>

80
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,833
<i>Please come.</i>

81
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,291
<i>Your visits are the only thing...</i>

82
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,000
Can you stay a little longer?

83
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,625
Of course.

84
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,958
- Oh, sorry!
- Sorry.

85
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,291
Uh, Freja?

86
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,291
Sorry, I'm... I'm Ambar.

87
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,125
Red said it's just the two of us.

88
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,875
Red is full of shit.

89
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,875
- This needs to be double stitched.
- Okay. I'm sorry, sir.

90
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,583
- This hem's no good either.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

91
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,559
- It won't happen again.
- I need you to hurry up.

92
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,333
- You should be doing twice as many.
- Yes.

93
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,041
- Pick up the pace.
- Yes, sir, I'm sorry. Thank you.

94
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,000
<i>He adds the raids go after employees,</i>

95
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,125
<i>but not the business owners
also committing crimes by hiring...</i>

96
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,333
Come on, we agreed!

97
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,583
But why? Can I know why?

98
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,375
Yes! Fine.

99
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,416
Bye.

100
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,458
Well, how much is the ID?

101
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,000
- The price went up to 3,000.
<i>- </i>Three?

102
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,142
- Come on, you said it was one!
- I know, but...

103
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,708
- This guy's an asshole. I'm sorry.
- Why?

104
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,916
Birthplace. If it's Ohio,
it's still a thousand.

105
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,125
- No, it has to be Texas.
- Why can't you come from Ohio?

106
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,333
- I can't.
- Then it's gonna have to cost you more.

107
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,625
I'm sorry.

108
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,875
Don't worry about it.
You'll think of something.

109
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,166
Texans are resourceful people.

110
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,166
Be nice when we go out there.

111
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,583
I'm trying to be nice,
but I don't know who she is.

112
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,750
You hardly knew her mother!

113
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,416
It's gonna be a nice evening

114
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,416
as long as you are able to,
you know, be nice.

115
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
I'll do my best.

116
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,250
Carlos? Dinner.

117
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,541
- Can I help?
- No, it's okay.

118
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,333
I hope you like meatloaf.

119
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,458
Yes.

120
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,833
It smells delicious.

121
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,125
Thank you for inviting me.

122
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,333
Of course.
It's our pleasure to meet you.

123
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:07,833
Thank you.

124
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,166
You must be Carlos.

125
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,791
- What?
- Oh, we don't...

126
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,166
Carlos isn't used to speaking Spanish.

127
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,333
Oh.

128
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,666
I'm... I'm sorry.

129
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,208
Carlos, Ambar's mama was my cousin.

130
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,166
That makes Ambar your second cousin.

131
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,500
Are you all set for Friday?

132
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,291
Yes.

133
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,416
Yes, thank you very much.

134
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,000
No promises,
but I did put in a good word for you.

135
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,375
Don't forget to bring your ID.
They were pretty big on that.

136
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,166
So, how do you like the city, Ambar?

137
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,875
I mean, it's nice.

138
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,208
- Just a little cold.
- It's freezing.

139
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,583
I have to wear two pairs of socks here.

140
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,625
You know,
you should get a proper coat.

141
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,750
Sylvia, don't we have something
we can give her?

142
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,541
Oh, no, no. That's okay. I can buy one.

143
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,958
No, it's fine. I...

144
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,833
I have an old coat in my closet.

145
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,375
Well,

146
00:13:58,958 --> 00:13:59,958
thank you.

147
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,791
So, Beto says you didn't go to college.

148
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,500
Well, I was going to,
but then Mami got sick.

149
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,291
Um...

150
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,333
I'm gonna go to night school
to study business management.

151
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:17,833
It's a great thing you did,
staying by her side through her illness.

152
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,875
Well, she needed me.

153
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,125
Putting your life on hold all those years,

154
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,083
not a lot of people would've done that.

155
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,500
Are you listening, Carlos?

156
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,208
Lose something?

157
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:09,958
Hey.

158
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,625
No. Uh, there was a sound.

159
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,416
Basement's private.

160
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,791
Sorry. Um, I... I actually need
to talk to you about something.

161
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:23,041
Look, it's late. I need to finish up,
so let's talk tomorrow.

162
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,291
Study's private too.

163
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,291
Oh, um...

164
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,583
Well, I need to talk to you
about my deposit.

165
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,250
Why?

166
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,750
Well, I'm very sorry,
but I need my deposit back.

167
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:42,000
Something has come up. You can have
the money for last night and tonight.

168
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,416
You just moved in.

169
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,791
I know, Red. Please, I... I need that money.

170
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,083
I already spent it.

171
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,625
- What?
- Refurbishments, tools, materials.

172
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,750
It's done. Sorry.

173
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,250
Hey, are you okay?

174
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,625
Freja?

175
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:01,750
<i>Coming up next, we find out
what really happened to the four hikers</i>

176
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,375
<i>that went missing
in the Swedish wilderness.</i>

177
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,625
<i>You've always had such beautiful hair.</i>

178
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:16,500
You'd brush it a hundred times
before letting me leave the house.

179
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,291
And aren't you glad I did?

180
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,250
Yes.

181
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,083
Are you sure you're happy to stay?

182
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Of course.

183
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,291
Hmm.

184
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,000
You're too kind, Ambar.

185
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,541
What's that in the corner?

186
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,208
<i>You want what?</i>

187
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,750
Can I get paid for next week?

188
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,833
You know how many girls would kill
for this job?

189
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,958
- And you ask me for an advance?
- But what if I do double shifts?

190
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,416
Every day you're getting slower!

191
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,708
You're lucky you still have a job.

192
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,750
I'm sorry. I'll move faster.

193
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,291
You just got here,
and you keep saying that!

194
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,416
I know, but I promise. I'm sorry.

195
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,208
Why don't I put you on packing?

196
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,750
I'm not supposed to, but just for today.

197
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:47,208
And you come back tomorrow
and prove to me you're good for this job.

198
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,791
- Okay.
- Okay?

199
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,875
How about a thank you?

200
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,583
<i>Ambar.</i>

201
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,458
Why do you need the ID so soon?

202
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,875
What's so important about Friday?

203
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,791
I have a job interview.

204
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,958
So take the damned ID
which says you were born in Ohio.

205
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,291
You can just say Texas was a mistake
on your application or something.

206
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,708
- I can't.
- Why not?

207
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,125
- Well, it's complicated.
- So explain!

208
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,208
My uncle.

209
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,333
I called him up
and asked... asked for a job, and...

210
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:54,541
he said he couldn't help me
because I wasn't a US citizen, and...

211
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,916
I lied and said that I was born...

212
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
In Texas!

213
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,000
Mami used to live in Texas, and...

214
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,791
now I'm stuck.

215
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,333
I didn't want to come here like this.
But Mami got sick,

216
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,208
and then she'd get better,
and I could make plans.

217
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:17,083
But then things would get bad again,
and I'd have to stay.

218
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,708
I was relieved when it was all over.

219
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,458
I could finally leave for a new start.

220
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,750
You know, people always told me
I had an eye for fashion.

221
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,791
A gift for seeing
who people would like to be.

222
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,916
We came here, and I thought I would
open up a shop or maybe start a website.

223
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,208
Five years later,

224
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:43,791
and I'm still working
the same shitty job.

225
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,166
We are too kind.

226
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,083
Why else am I still living
with several members of my family?

227
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,083
I should make them work for me.

228
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,541
I love them, but life would be
so much easier without them.

229
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:02,708
Listen, this is clearly the drink talking,

230
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,750
but why don't I lend you the rest?

231
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,875
- What?
- You're going to have a real job soon.

232
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,250
You can pay me back.

233
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,666
And then maybe lend me
some money to do my own thing.

234
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,750
Oh my God.
Kinsi, are you... are you serious?

235
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,500
Yes! I'm serious.

236
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:20,958
When can you get this done?

237
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,641
As soon as you get me the money.

238
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,375
What are you doing?

239
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:33,750
Get this to your guy
and... and get me my papers.

240
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:35,875
You are sure?

241
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,541
Yes!

242
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,291
Hello?

243
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,517
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

244
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:13,141
- Who's this?
- I don't know. She scared me.

245
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:19,000
Hi. I'm... I'm Ambar.

246
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,500
- Maria.
- Petra.

247
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,125
- Are you guys staying here?
- For now. Drink?

248
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:29,708
Um... No, no, thank you.
I've had plenty tonight.

249
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:31,125
If I have another one,

250
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:34,083
I don't think I'll make it
into work tomorrow.

251
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:37,333
- Huh.
- What do you do for work?

252
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,958
Yeah, it's... it's tough out there.

253
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,125
Yeah. It's so much better in here.

254
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,416
Right. Right.
At least the rent is cheap.

255
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,375
It's cheap because it's shit.

256
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,000
Sure.

257
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,250
Cigarette?

258
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:01,041
Uh... Yeah, yeah.

259
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:03,291
Thank you.

260
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,250
Evening, ladies.

261
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:13,375
- You ready to go up?
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:14,625
Let's go.

263
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:21,083
I thought you said
this place was women only.

264
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:23,333
There was this other guy downstairs.

265
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:27,750
Oh, that's just Becker. He's my brother.
It's just me and him, don't worry.

266
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:37,208
<i>...as performed
within the ritual sacrifice.</i>

267
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:42,333
<i>You will then give her the elderly</i>,
<i>women, children</i>.

268
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:45,083
<i>In return, you'll receive the blessings...</i>

269
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,791
<i>We don't know
how it began or how it ended.</i>

270
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,125
- Good luck.
- Let's go.

271
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,833
All right, let's move it.

272
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,958
Come on.

273
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,291
Come on, come on.

274
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,958
Come on, come on.

275
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:18,516
<i>Hey, it's Kinsi.
It sucks that you missed me,</i>

276
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:22,166
<i>but leave a message
and I'll call you back soon. Bye!</i>

277
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,458
- Have you seen Kinsi?
- She quit this morning.

278
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:31,041
All I get is a text.
Didn't even bother to call.

279
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,750
- Do you have her address?
- I can't give you that.

280
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,666
- Come on. I need it.
- Why?

281
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,500
- I... I just really need it.
- It's against company policy.

282
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,375
Company policy?
What company policy? It's just you!

283
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,000
You ain't worth the hassle.

284
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,333
- You're fired.
- No, no. Hey, wait, wait...

285
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,583
Hey, Kinsi, it's Ambar.

286
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,250
Call me back.

287
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:05,855
<i>Hey, it's Kinsi.</i>

288
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:09,083
<i>It sucks that you missed me,
but leave a message and I'll call...</i>

289
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,666
Help!

290
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,125
Help!

291
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,250
Help!

292
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,000
Help!

293
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:25,958
Help!

294
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,333
Freja?

295
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,708
Oh, shit!

296
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:48,916
- I'm so sorry.
- What the fuck!

297
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,250
What's wrong?

298
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,875
Have you seen Freja?

299
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,916
Uh, she... she moved out.

300
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,750
What? When?

301
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:57,750
A couple days back.

302
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,875
People come and go from here all the time.

303
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:01,833
I'm sorry. I need to...

304
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,958
I wanted to talk about your deposit.

305
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,708
With the new girls here,
it's a little easier, so...

306
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,583
- I can get it back to you.
- Okay, now?

307
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:17,083
No, I don't have cash
on me right now.

308
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:18,791
Um...

309
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:20,708
Tomorrow.

310
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:24,916
Okay. Thanks. I'm sorry.

311
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:38,041
Hey, Beck, you okay?

312
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:37,583
<i>Saved messages.</i>

313
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,708
<i>Hi, sweetheart. It's Mama.</i>

314
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:43,125
<i>Sorry for calling so late.</i>

315
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:46,166
<i>You know I can't sleep in these beds.</i>

316
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,333
<i>Thank you for today.
I know you have plans,</i>

317
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,041
<i>but I need you to come in tomorrow</i>.

318
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
<i>Please...</i>

319
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:13,000
<i>Hi, sweetheart. It's Mama.</i>

320
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:15,458
<i>Sorry for calling so late.</i>

321
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:18,625
<i>You know I can't sleep in these beds.</i>

322
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:21,291
<i>Thank you for today.
I know you have plans...</i>

323
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:36,750
Ambar.

324
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,041
No.

325
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,875
Please don't...

326
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,458
Please, Mary, no.

327
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:11,166
I must prepare you,

328
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,833
or Arthur will hurt us both.

329
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,750
Come here!

330
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,958
Stop!

331
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:34,541
Come here.

332
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,541
Hurry up! Stop!

333
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:39,291
Hey!

334
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,666
You'll do what I say.

335
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:21,541
No, Mary. No.

336
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:36,000
Please, Mary.

337
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,291
Please, Mary.

338
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,083
Mary, please.

339
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,666
Don't listen to Arthur.

340
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:22,250
Please, let me...

341
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,758
Come on.

342
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:25,833
Pick up the phone!

343
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,833
- <i>Ambar?</i>
- Beto?

344
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:35,000
<i>It's the middle of the night.
Are you all right?</i>

345
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:40,333
Beto, can you pick me up?
I'm at 1521 Recolte Avenue. Please.

346
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,583
Please, Beto. I can't stay here. Please...

347
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:45,750
<i>We're out of town.</i>

348
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,791
<i>We're looking at a college
for Carlos, remember?</i>

349
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,916
<i>Listen, if you're in trouble,
call the cops.</i>

350
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,916
No, I can't call the police.

351
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,500
- <i>Why not?</i>
- Because...

352
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:57,791
Because I wasn't born in Texas.

353
00:41:58,625 --> 00:41:59,833
<i>What do you mean?</i>

354
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:05,750
I came here after Mama died.

355
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:06,875
<i>Ambar...</i>

356
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:11,500
I'm so sorry. I'll make it up to you,
but I really need your help.

357
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,500
Can you wire me some money?

358
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,708
Please, I promise I'll pay you back.

359
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,625
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

360
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:20,916
<i>It's just... we'd never even met before.</i>

361
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,666
<i>Look, I'll come see you as soon as I can.</i>

362
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,000
<i>Just try and stay
out of trouble until then.</i>

363
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:32,541
Red?

364
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:33,666
Red?

365
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:36,958
Red, I need my...

366
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,958
Where's Red?

367
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:44,916
He said he'd give me my deposit back.

368
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:48,833
- I'll send him down when he gets back.
- No...

369
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:11,250
No. There's no vacancy. Not here.

370
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:14,625
- I'll pay the rest tomorrow...
- Just get out of here, okay?

371
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:16,750
Come on.

372
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:29,208
Hold up.
Hey, where you going, darling?

373
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:06,166
<i>Hi, sweetheart. It's Mama.</i>

374
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,625
<i>Sorry for calling so late.</i>

375
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:11,125
<i>You know I can't sleep in these beds.</i>

376
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,208
<i>Thank you for today...</i>

377
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,583
<i>This is the red line to Tower City.</i>

378
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:26,791
<i>Next stop, West Park.</i>

379
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,416
Fuck!

380
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,541
<i>The 444 team has been tracking</i>

381
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,916
<i>this major weather storm all day.</i>

382
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,500
<i>We are here tonight to let you know
just how long the snow...</i>

383
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:43,333
Thank you. Can I...
Sorry, can I actually have another one?

384
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,583
Did you bring my deposit?

385
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:37,583
Hello to you too.

386
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,750
Sorry, hi.

387
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:42,375
No, I was out.

388
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:44,000
It's back at the house.

389
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:46,916
You sounded like you were upset,
so I came straight here.

390
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,458
Okay. Can you bring it?

391
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:51,166
You want me to drive
all the way back across town,

392
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,833
pick up your money, and bring it here?

393
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:55,208
- I can't go back to the house.
- Why?

394
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,416
I don't want
to take you back there either.

395
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,750
Becker and I

396
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:05,250
didn't see eye-to-eye on your refund.

397
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:06,958
I'm sorry.

398
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:08,291
It's fine.

399
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:12,875
Becker's a bit off,

400
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:16,125
but he took care of me growing up.

401
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,666
Our dad, I had a hard time with him.

402
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:22,458
Becker stuck up for me.

403
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,666
But he's sick now.

404
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:28,583
And the way I see it,

405
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:30,916
he looked after me...

406
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:35,000
Now it's my turn.

407
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:38,583
You know what I mean?

408
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:45,375
Come on. Let's get your money.

409
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:27,791
The money's in your room.

410
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,916
What did I tell you girls
about smoking in the lounge?

411
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
We weren't.

412
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:37,916
Ambar, come have a drink.

413
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,416
No, I'm not staying. Thank you.

414
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:42,125
Come help me!

415
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:44,750
Red, where's the wine going?

416
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:47,416
Wherever. I'll be there in a minute.

417
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:35,791
You sure you don't want a drink?

418
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:37,708
Where's my money?

419
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,083
You sure?

420
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:40,708
Where's my money, Red?

421
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,291
Suit yourself.

422
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:47,333
I know this house is kind of weird.

423
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:52,583
My dad used to dig up
and collect all this strange stuff.

424
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:56,208
He was a real nutjob. Killed our mom.

425
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:59,458
- I want to leave now.
- Come here, come on.

426
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:02,000
It'll warm you up.

427
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,458
Get out of my way.

428
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:08,916
I wish you hadn't called me.

429
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,833
- I was gonna help you.
- Get out...

430
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,750
I hope you know that part was true.

431
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,250
If you hadn't left,
I would've given you your money.

432
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:21,708
- You'd be out of here.
- Red.

433
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:22,791
But Becker...

434
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:26,125
He needs you.

435
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:27,208
Fuck you.

436
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:35,958
Let me make this as easy
as I can for you. You gotta drink...

437
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:41,458
- Beck, I got this.
- Quiet.

438
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:43,458
- Beck, I got...
- Shut the fuck up.

439
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:59,041
Let me teach you something.

440
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:08,625
Open your mouth.

441
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:11,208
Open your mouth.

442
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:16,375
Open

443
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:18,000
your mouth.

444
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,500
No.

445
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,208
Please don't try to leave.

446
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:44,875
He'll make it way worse.

447
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,208
Please?

448
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:24,875
We come in, please?

449
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:34,333
- You're alone?
- Yes.

450
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,166
Come on.

451
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,333
- Becker?
- Yes.

452
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,541
We should stay together.

453
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:54,416
- You want to fight him?
- No. He'll kill us.

454
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,208
- He's different. We must leave.
- Now?

455
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:59,000
No, he's downstairs,
always by the basement door.

456
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,625
We should wait.

457
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:04,583
But in day he sleeps.

458
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:10,541
You think they're keeping
other women in the basement?

459
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,833
I don't know. I don't want to find out.

460
00:53:16,416 --> 00:53:18,458
There's something wrong with this place.

461
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:21,583
What have you seen?

462
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:25,541
I keep dreaming about home.

463
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:28,958
My son is there.

464
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:32,208
But he's changed, something's different.

465
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:34,541
I like him like this.

466
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:36,458
I can't leave him.

467
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:38,500
So I hold him.

468
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:42,625
I hold him tight, do not let go.

469
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:48,458
And... And I see this box.

470
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,416
A stone box?

471
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:57,916
Even when I'm awake, I see it.

472
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,041
- I've seen it too.
- No.

473
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,250
I think the box is here.

474
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:11,375
Where?

475
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,000
Basement.

476
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,000
I want to go home.

477
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,708
You hear it too?

478
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:00,625
Yeah.

479
00:55:01,416 --> 00:55:02,708
All night, the same.

480
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:04,583
Women crying.

481
00:55:05,666 --> 00:55:06,746
They're dead.

482
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,541
Ambar.

483
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:48,916
Stay a little longer.

484
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:51,583
Ambar.

485
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:55,083
- Ambar. Wake up!
- Come here.

486
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,250
- No, Petra!
- Get up!

487
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:02,583
- Beck!
- No!

488
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:28,916
Go.

489
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,642
- Why do I have to...
- Now!

490
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:48,541
Hey, man.
It's a little early to be coming around.

491
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:50,875
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm looking for somebody.

492
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:52,666
Her name is Ambar Cruz.

493
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:56,000
- Sorry, don't know her.
- She's 5'7", brown hair, this long.

494
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:58,750
- She said that she was living here.
- Still no.

495
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:04,125
I'm sorry. I know it's early, but...

496
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:06,875
- Beto!
- Like I said, I ain't seen her.

497
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:09,291
She's in trouble.
Maybe she isn't using her real name.

498
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:11,125
If she's lying to you about that,

499
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:13,250
maybe she's lying to you
about where she's staying.

500
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:15,133
Yeah, I just want to be sure,
you know?

501
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:17,333
- Beto!
<i>- Hombre.</i>

502
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:18,833
She ain't here.

503
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,875
That's her coat.

504
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,208
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Beto!

505
00:58:25,291 --> 00:58:27,434
- That's her coat. My wife gave...
<i>- Hombre,</i> settle down!

506
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:29,166
Don't <i>hombre</i> me...

507
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,916
Beto, help!

508
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,083
Ambar!

509
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:37,250
- Ambar!
- Beto, up here! Third floor!

510
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:38,541
Beto!

511
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,916
Becker!

512
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,041
Beto!

513
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:44,750
Ambar!

514
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:45,750
Becker!

515
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,793
- Where are you?
- Beto!

516
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:52,625
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

517
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:53,708
Step back!

518
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,708
Beto, watch out, there's another guy!

519
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:58,125
Stop! Stop!

520
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,750
Leave him alone!

521
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:04,625
Leave him alone!

522
00:59:06,666 --> 00:59:08,333
Son of a bitch!

523
00:59:35,916 --> 00:59:37,583
Jesus, Beck. Look what you...

524
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,500
Prepare her.

525
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:43,208
Upstairs.

526
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:44,291
Now.

527
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:06,041
- No! No!
- She's ready. Just calm down, man.

528
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,083
Her next.

529
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:11,583
That's too many in one go, Beck.

530
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:13,375
You don't...

531
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:28,833
What are you going to do to us?

532
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:31,875
Are you going to kill us?

533
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:35,541
- Of course you're going to kill us.
- Quiet.

534
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:40,041
Why are you doing this?

535
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:41,708
I'm trying to help my brother.

536
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:43,333
By doing this?

537
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,041
He's sick.

538
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:48,750
You haven't seen him after,
there's benefits. Believe me.

539
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:53,916
We moved back home because we couldn't
afford Beck's medical bills.

540
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,833
He wasn't doing so good.

541
01:00:56,333 --> 01:01:00,666
I wanted to convince the old man
to let us stay for a while.

542
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:03,875
Then we saw what he'd done...

543
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,125
to those girls.

544
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:11,000
He made Mom help him,
and then he killed her too.

545
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:13,041
Mary?

546
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:18,833
Yeah.

547
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:27,541
We did the world a favor,
getting rid of our dad.

548
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,166
I wanted to leave right after,

549
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:35,125
but Beck said we could fix the place up.

550
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:37,916
But just like Dad,

551
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,500
he started spending more time
with that damn box.

552
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:43,166
He thinks it chose him.

553
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:46,208
And then he started getting better.

554
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:49,750
Beck says he only needs

555
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:53,458
a few more hits,
and then we can stop all this.

556
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:54,625
Hits of what?

557
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:00,000
How many, Red?

558
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:03,666
- How many women?
- He's my fucking brother.

559
01:02:07,666 --> 01:02:08,666
Okay.

560
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,166
You need to get out of here.

561
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:13,708
We're done.

562
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:15,916
Red.

563
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:17,916
Hey.

564
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:19,541
Hey, look at me.

565
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:22,083
Come on, look at me.

566
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,000
Let's get out of here.

567
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:53,916
I'm sorry, <i>chica.</i>

568
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:56,333
Red.

569
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,166
- She's almost done. Just gotta...
- Her next.

570
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:05,708
Don't fight.

571
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:08,625
The last one fought.

572
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:17,416
Stop!

573
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:24,083
No! No, no!

574
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:25,958
Red!

575
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:28,875
Red! Red!

576
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:30,875
No!

577
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:33,083
Help!

578
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:34,875
Get help.

579
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,833
Please!

580
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:38,041
Oh my God.

581
01:03:38,666 --> 01:03:40,500
Stop. Stop!

582
01:03:44,166 --> 01:03:45,416
What the fuck.

583
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:47,416
Stop! Help!

584
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,625
Stop!

585
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:51,833
Help!

586
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,250
Please, please. Please wait...

587
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:26,625
Quiet.

588
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:35,333
Oh my God.

589
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:38,166
No!

590
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,458
No, no, no, no, no!
No! No! Stop!

591
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:58,041
Becker... Becker, Becker. Becker, stop.

592
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:02,125
Oh my God.

593
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:05,458
Becker. Becker, hey.

594
01:05:06,166 --> 01:05:09,041
Please. Please stop. Please stop.

595
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,125
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

596
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:17,041
Becker. Hey.

597
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:18,916
Becker.

598
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:21,041
Please let me go.

599
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:28,666
Come on.

600
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:33,083
No!

601
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:35,625
Please, let me go.

602
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:52,750
Becker, Becker, please.

603
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,375
Please stop!

604
01:05:56,041 --> 01:05:57,500
You should feel honored.

605
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:16,875
Let me go.

606
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:33,750
No. No, no, no. No...

607
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:39,833
Come on, come on.

608
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:15,250
- Ambar?
- Beto?

609
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:17,458
- Ambar, hold on.
- Beto.

610
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:18,541
Come on.

611
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:26,291
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I am.

612
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:34,416
Let's go. Hurry.

613
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,875
Help me!

614
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,000
Help me!

615
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:47,250
Together!

616
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:51,666
One more!

617
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:53,791
One more!

618
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:02,833
Beto?

619
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,291
Beto.

620
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:37,250
You've always had such beautiful hair.

621
01:08:39,791 --> 01:08:43,666
You'd brush it a hundred times
before letting me leave the house.

622
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,083
And aren't you glad I did?

623
01:08:58,041 --> 01:08:59,041
Yes.

624
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:34,083
Can you stay a little longer?

625
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:39,250
Please stay.

626
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,416
Stay with me.

627
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:22,375
I don't want you to go.

628
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:51,083
I need you to stay with me.

629
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,458
Can you stay a little longer?

630
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:37,916
Stay a little longer?

631
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:40,125
No.

632
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:48,708
I can't stay here.

633
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:50,208
I need you.

634
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:55,208
- Please, Mom, I have to go.
- You're too kind.

635
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:57,583
- You're too kind.
- No.

636
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:04,500
- You need to stay, sweetheart.
- No.

637
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:06,750
- Stay a little longer.
- No.

638
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:09,208
- I can't do this again.
- Stay still.

639
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,291
No.

640
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:11,708
Stay still.

641
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:13,458
No.

642
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:47,000
No!

643
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:53,666
No!

644
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:16,750
Quiet.

645
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:20,833
No...

646
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
What is it?

647
01:14:36,083 --> 01:14:38,250
- Go check.
- Why?

648
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:42,500
Something's different.

649
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:50,541
Open it.

650
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:53,125
- Why? What is it?
- Just open it.

651
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:07,958
There's nothing.

652
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:13,083
Fuck!

653
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:36,458
No, wait!

654
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:01,833
