<i>Hello.</i>

3
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,166
<i>This is the beginning.</i>

4
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,958
<i>The beginning of a film called </i>The Wonder.

5
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,250
<i>The people you are about to meet,</i>

6
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,500
<i>the characters,</i>

7
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,250
<i>believe in their stories
with complete devotion.</i>

8
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,833
<i>We are nothing without stories.</i>

9
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,458
<i>And so we invite you
to believe in this one.</i>

10
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,791
<i>It is 1862.</i>

11
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,208
<i>We left England, bound for Ireland.</i>

12
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,500
<i>The Great Famine
still casts a long shadow,</i>

13
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,875
<i>and the Irish hold England responsible
for that devastation.</i>

14
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,125
<i>There sits a nurse.</i>

15
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,125
<i>An English nurse…</i>

16
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,250
<i>…traveling all on her own.</i>

17
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,166
<i>And it's with her, we begin.</i>

18
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,958
You'll be the English nurse.

19
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,708
Will I?

20
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:46,416
Well, I'm due a nun and a nurse,
and… …you're not the nun.

21
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,250
No.

22
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,916
Maggie!

23
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,750
I thought I was lodging
with the girl's family,

24
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,000
the O'Donnells.

25
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,125
Sorry to disappoint.

26
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,083
- No, no, I was ju...
- Sure, they'd have nowhere to put you.

27
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,250
The O'Donnells live beyond the village.

28
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,500
You and the nun are to lodge here.

29
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,541
Sorry, but why a nun?

30
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,500
- Welcome to Ireland.
- Mm.

31
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,541
Your room.

32
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,416
We'll see you at eight for breakfast.

33
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,708
Good morning.

34
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,083
Have you come to do
some experiments on Anna?

35
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,500
No.

36
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,500
Do you know her?

37
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,833
Everyone knows everyone here, Mrs. Wright.

38
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,041
Ah.

39
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,916
We shared a desk at school.

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,916
Did you?

41
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,583
You've been blessed
with many daughters, Mrs. Ryan.

42
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,666
Only that one's mine.

43
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,166
The other blessings
belonged to the first Mrs. Ryan.

44
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,250
I'd call it "tricked."

45
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,500
Mrs. Wright,

46
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,625
the committee is waiting.

47
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,291
Let her have breakfast.

48
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,208
Please.

49
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:24,791
Thank you.

50
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,375
- The watch is to last two weeks.
- It's been decided it's two weeks?

51
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,041
- Two weeks is too long.
- It's important to be thorough.

52
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,250
The village is overwhelmed
with sightseers and gawkers

53
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,708
coming to stare at the child.

54
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:50,750
And the newspapers.

55
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,916
When will we stop being made a mockery of
thanks to someone's journalistic desires?

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,500
- It was a medical paper.
- In a national newspaper.

57
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,250
May I ask, gentlemen?

58
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,583
No one has told me
what precisely is wrong with the girl.

59
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,000
Nothing at all.

60
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,125
Very well.

61
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,958
I shall return to my post in England.

62
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,125
Anna O'Donnell doesn't eat.

63
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,625
If a patient in the hospital
refuses to eat, we use force.

64
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,500
The girl is not to be forced.

65
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,083
Nor interrogated or badgered.

66
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:29,333
But she is also not to be denied food
should she ask for it.

67
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,250
The girl has lived
miraculously without food

68
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,791
since her 11th birthday.

69
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,000
"Miraculously" is not how she's done it.

70
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,041
The purpose of the watch is to determine

71
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:43,375
exactly how Anna O'Donnell
has survived without food.

72
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,791
So you want us to watch her?

73
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,541
Yes.

74
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,083
We are proposing eight-hour shifts,

75
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,375
changing over at five in the morning,

76
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,875
one in the afternoon, and nine at night.

77
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,541
Does that suit you?

78
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,333
There is to be no conferring
between the two of you.

79
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,625
On the 14th day,

80
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,958
you will each present
your separate testimony.

81
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,833
How long exactly has it been
since the last time the girl ate?

82
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,875
Four months.

83
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,791
That's impossible.

84
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,333
May I ask why not two nurses,
Dr. McBrearty?

85
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,000
Sister Michael
is the second nurse, Mrs. Wright.

86
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,125
The O'Donnell family
drew some comfort in the idea of a nun,

87
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,708
as did some of the less

88
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,833
scientifically minded members
of the committee.

89
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,791
And I assume she's bedridden?

90
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,416
Better not to assume.

91
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,625
Here we are.

92
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,541
<i>- Dia duit.
- Dia is Muire duit.</i>

93
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,333
<i>Tar is teach.</i>

94
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,208
- Morning, Doctor.
- Morning, Rosaleen.

95
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,416
Hello.

96
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Hello.

97
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,833
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

98
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,875
May I take your daughter's history,
Mrs. O'Donnell?

99
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,666
Sure, what history could a child have?

100
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,750
She hasn't eaten in four months.
Is that correct?

101
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,708
That is correct.

102
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,291
And would you describe her as healthy?

103
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,791
Well, she's a little delicate, perhaps.

104
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,416
But she never complains.

105
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,416
- And her appetite?
- Never greedy.

106
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,583
May I see the girl, please?

107
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,750
She has visitors at the minute.

108
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,500
Visitors?

109
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,791
All the time.

110
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,041
From all over.

111
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,916
Mr. O'Donnell.

112
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,916
How are you?

113
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,500
Doctor.

114
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,125
This is Mrs. Wright.

115
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,333
<i>Fáilte romhat.</i>

116
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,458
It means, "You're welcome here."

117
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Thank you.

118
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,416
Perhaps…

119
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,666
I think the watch

120
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,666
may be more appropriately conducted
in a hospital.

121
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,541
No.

122
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,916
You're not taking my wee girl away.

123
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,833
Thank you.

124
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,875
- Thank you.
- Uh, for your trouble.

125
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,833
- No trouble.
- Well, something for the wee lass.

126
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,333
In the poor box, if you insist.

127
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,875
She's a jewel.

128
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,250
A wonder.

129
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,875
Thank you, Doctor.

130
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,791
Thank <i>you,</i> Nurse Wright.

131
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,958
…most precious cross,
adorned by the tender, delicate,

132
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,833
and venerable members of Jesus my Savior,

133
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,916
sprinkled and stained
with his precious blood.

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,166
Hello, Anna.

135
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,291
Hello.

136
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,750
My name is Elizabeth Wright.
You may call me Mrs. Wright. May I?

137
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,125
Open, please.

138
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Arms up.

139
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,333
Down.

140
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,791
Turn around.

141
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,041
Turn around again.

142
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,041
And eyes wide open.

143
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,166
You seem well, Anna.

144
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,750
Are you nervous at all?

145
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,000
Why should I be nervous?

146
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,000
Strangers…

147
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,375
Such as myself.

148
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,416
Do you know why I'm here?

149
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,458
To make sure I don't eat.

150
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,958
I'm here to watch.

151
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,416
Not prevent you from eating.

152
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,833
Do you know the dangers
of a prolonged fast, Anna?

153
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,708
I don't need to eat.

154
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,250
I live on manna.

155
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,791
From Heaven.

156
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,125
And how does that feel?

157
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,500
Full.

158
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,750
Your son is not home, Mr. O'Donnell.

159
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,708
Pat's gone over.

160
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,625
God keep him.

161
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,250
Have you no blessings of your own?

162
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,750
No.

163
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:57,875
Widowed.

164
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,041
We were married for less than a year.

165
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,833
I adore thee,
O most precious cross,

166
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:20,125
adorned by the tender, delicate,
and venerable members of Jesus my Savior,

167
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,250
sprinkled and stained
with his precious blood.

168
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,250
Amen.

169
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,666
- Good evening, Sister.
- Good evening.

170
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,208
Well?

171
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,291
I've been summoned all the way here…

172
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,250
- Sure, no one forced you. Another?
- Aye, two more.

173
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,833
- To offer my professional opinion...
- You can give me your professional...

174
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,750
My professional opinion

175
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:18,958
on a girl who could be somehow having food
secretly shoveled into her mouth.

176
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,875
Well, that sounds about right.

177
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,500
What kind of backwards village
imports a professional nurse

178
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,208
for something like this?

179
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:32,333
"Backwards village."
Didn't you nurse in the Crimea?

180
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,625
That's exactly my point, Mr. Ryan.
This has nothing to do with nursing.

181
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,791
You're being paid handsomely
to sit on your backside for a fortnight.

182
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,708
- I'll pay you to sit on my back...
- I'm warning you!

183
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,791
Prove it's nonsense, then.

184
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,083
Prove it's nonsense, then fuck off home.

185
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,958
I had his eyes painted on…

186
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,000
Afterwards.

187
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,541
I misunderstood.

188
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,125
I thought your son had emigrated.

189
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,541
I need my children near.

190
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,666
I'm sorry.

191
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,208
The very best…

192
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,083
He takes early to be His angels.

193
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,458
Should we go back?

194
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:07,875
No.

195
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,041
Fresh air is good for your lungs.

196
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,583
Those are big boots.

197
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,208
They were my brother's.

198
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,625
Are you hungry?

199
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,583
Would you like some water?

200
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,541
Thank you.

201
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,625
- Any more?
- No, thank you.

202
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,333
Who's that one?

203
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,041
St. Cecilia.

204
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,666
She's the patron of music.

205
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,041
She heard it playing in her heart.

206
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,500
Lucky one, St. Cecilia.

207
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,333
St. Lucy.

208
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,000
Patron of the blind
and protector of sight.

209
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,416
St. Agnes, chastity and purity.

210
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,125
Who's your favorite?

211
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:38,916
Here, look.

212
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,833
The mystic marriage
of St. Catherine and the baby Jesus.

213
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:47,541
He gave her a wedding ring,
but only she could see it.º

214
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,083
Anyone can be chosen.

215
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,583
Saints or sinners.

216
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,333
Elizabeth of Hungary.

217
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,125
She was a widow.

218
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,208
Ah…

219
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,625
The very worst of sins.

220
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,458
No, not at all.

221
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,916
That's not what I meant.

222
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,583
I know.

223
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,833
Does your family call you… Elizabeth?

224
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,583
Or Eliza?

225
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,958
Or maybe Betty?

226
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,000
They don't call me anything.

227
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,500
I don't have a family anymore.

228
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:45,958
I'm sorry.

229
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:53,208
Doesn't look like a child
who's not eaten in four months, does she?

230
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,833
Indeed.

231
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,500
How strongly the vital force burns.

232
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,958
Are you feeling well
in yourself, Anna?

233
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,375
Very well, Father, thank you.

234
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,625
Good girl.

235
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,000
Hold still.

236
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,791
One,

237
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,541
two,

238
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,416
three,

239
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:19,916
four…

240
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,708
What if Anna is drawing
on some nutritive force

241
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,875
we don't yet understand?

242
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,250
Such as?

243
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:31,458
Well… magnetism, perhaps?

244
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,791
Molecules of scent?

245
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,000
Anna is bothered by visitors constantly.

246
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:42,416
For a serious study,
we need quiet and isolation, Doctor.

247
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:44,916
Doctor.

248
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,541
Are you eating for the patient
as well as yourself?

249
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,083
That was rude.

250
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:12,958
I'm sorry.

251
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,375
Will Byrne, <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.

252
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,916
Over from London.

253
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:21,875
Like you.

254
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:26,041
I was hoping for an interview
with the miracle girl herself.

255
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:27,666
She is not taking visitors.

256
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,666
Doctor's orders.

257
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,000
And who gives him his?

258
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,333
He started this whole thing off,
the good doctor.

259
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:41,291
I'm writing a big piece about the girl.

260
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,708
- Just doing my job.
- Hmm.

261
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,250
And I, mine.

262
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:54,041
Perhaps I could interview you instead?

263
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:57,291
The Nightingale
who's come to watch over her.

264
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:01,000
I would never speak about a patient.

265
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,541
And certainly not to a journalist.

266
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:07,208
I'll have you know, I've written
for dozens of publications, all over.

267
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,250
So you'd write anything for a shilling.

268
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,791
What else has brought you across the sea
to play jailer to a child?

269
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,750
Kitty.

270
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,541
What was the last thing Anna ate?

271
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,250
Do you remember?

272
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,500
The flesh of our Savior.

273
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:44,125
Her birthday and her Holy Communion
were on the same day.

274
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,291
It was a blessed day.

275
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:49,625
So just water and wheat?

276
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,416
No, missus,
not just water and wheat.

277
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,666
It's the body and blood of Christ.

278
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:00,000
That's a story, Kitty.
I'm looking for facts.

279
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:04,833
I'm sorry.

280
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:06,875
I didn't…

281
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,291
It's what I'm here for.

282
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:15,750
- To tell the difference between...
- I dig up turf, and you dig up the truth.

283
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:20,666
That's exactly right.

284
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:25,916
You see, you also need your stories.

285
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,666
You write them down
in that little notebook of yours.

286
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,750
Thank you.

287
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,666
It's quite the bible you got going.

288
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:47,416
<i>Hello again,
I told you we are nothing without stories.</i>

289
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:51,833
Father Thaddeus dropped it by.

290
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:56,125
He said you'd asked for a lamp.

291
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,541
- I did.
- Amen.

292
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,791
Candlelight is not half bright enough
for a watch.

293
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,458
Sweet dreams, pet.

294
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,708
And it's important
we stay alert, Sister.

295
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,958
- It runs on burning fluid.
- Sleep sound.

296
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:11,666
- Good night.
- And you have to keep the wick trimmed.

297
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,625
- Night, Mammy.
- I'm sure I'll manage.

298
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:17,458
- <i>Oíche mhaith,</i> Anna.
- Good night, Kitty.

299
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,166
Will you be able to sleep
with the light on, Anna?

300
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,125
Yes, thank you, Miss…

301
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,416
Betsy?

302
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:29,875
It's Nurse Wright to you, missy.

303
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,750
- Anything?
- We're not to confer.

304
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:35,541
Good night, Anna.

305
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,416
Night, Sister.

306
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh.

307
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,083
…sprinkled
and stained with his precious blood.

308
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:33,166
Amen.

309
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:36,083
Good morning, Anna.

310
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:38,875
Good morning…

311
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:42,333
Lily?

312
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:47,083
If you make up names for me,
I'm gonna have to do the same for you.

313
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:51,958
Good morning…

314
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,833
Lizzie?

315
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,291
Should I call you Annie?

316
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Or Annabelle?

317
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:07,500
Hannah, perhaps?

318
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,041
But then I'd be someone else,

319
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,125
not me.

320
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Nancy.

321
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:18,916
Or Nan.

322
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,000
Nan. I like Nan.

323
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,666
Well, Nan…

324
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,458
I owe you an apology.

325
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,958
Last night…

326
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:40,083
I knocked over one of your treasures,
and I'm sorry.

327
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,791
Is the lock of hair your brother's?

328
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:09,583
You must miss him.

329
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,458
I know your mother misses him terribly.

330
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,000
Sorrow is God's spade.

331
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,000
What does that mean?

332
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:28,416
It readies the ground.

333
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,833
Can I tell you something?

334
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:39,208
My mother used to call me Lib.

335
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,458
- Lib.
- Mm-hmm.

336
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:46,458
Mrs. Lib.

337
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,916
Hail Mary,
full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

338
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,958
- Blessed art thou amongst women…
- Have you seen anything?

339
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:49,333
There's been nothing to see.

340
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,000
Right.

341
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,250
Morning, sweetheart.

342
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:12,000
Angel of God, my guardian dear, to whom…

343
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:13,958
Mrs. Lib?

344
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:15,833
Yes?

345
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,375
Is it true you went to war?

346
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,958
Yes. Turn around. Sit down, please.

347
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:28,958
What was it like?

348
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,041
It was difficult.

349
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,541
I was tending to soldiers.

350
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:45,166
Men who'd seen awful things.

351
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,708
Who'd done awful things.

352
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,500
Were they very sick?

353
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,625
Some of them were, yes.

354
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:02,458
But…

355
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,375
It's a great privilege…

356
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:09,458
Being with people at the end.

357
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:12,833
They talk.

358
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,166
They tell their stories.

359
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:18,958
Open.

360
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:30,958
The souls in Purgatory
have to be burned for a while,

361
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:32,916
to clean them.

362
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:37,500
But the souls in Hell
have to be burned forever.

363
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:43,500
Surely your brother's in Heaven, Anna?

364
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,750
We can't know that, Mrs. Lib.

365
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:36,458
I'd assumed you'd be
on your way back to London by now.

366
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,541
If only.

367
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:43,333
My editor demands daily dispatches
on this matter of international import.

368
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
All I can currently supply
is satirical speculation.

369
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,541
I must beg for your help again.

370
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:51,166
Ask the nun.

371
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:57,000
If she sees me, she'll take the rod to me.
I've sinned too much. It shows.

372
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It would make a good story though.

373
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,250
Are they making money out of her?

374
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,625
Straight in the poor box.

375
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,791
Money for the Church, then.

376
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,708
Not enough to be worth this much effort.

377
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:13,500
The doctor? Making his name?

378
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,875
No. He admires her "vital force."

379
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,625
What about Flynn? He owns their house
and is the most fervent of them all.

380
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,833
He's obsessed
with her being a miracle child.

381
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,458
He's never there, if that's what you mean.

382
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,083
Is it all the girl's doing?

383
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:37,208
I've watched her until my eyes burn.

384
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:40,416
These days,
nothing but water has passed her lips.

385
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,416
She's an actress.

386
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:32,000
God bless the bed that I lay on.

387
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:36,666
As I lay down my head to sleep,
I pray to God my soul to keep.

388
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:42,125
If I should die before I wake,
I pray to God my soul to take.

389
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:47,583
- Wake me now, wake me never.
- My soul…

390
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,000
From this point on,
no one can come near her.

391
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:52,875
Save for myself and Sister Michael,
no one can touch her.

392
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:55,166
- I must ask you to leave.
- You can't do that.

393
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,500
Stand up. It's a requirement of the watch.
Please leave.

394
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,250
We're wishing our daughter a good night.

395
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,166
You can do so from the stairs.
Anna, over here.

396
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,208
- Sister Michael?
- Are these Dr. McBrearty's orders?

397
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:07,291
- Mm-hmm. Move.
- A mother's kiss is sacred.

398
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,375
Good night.

399
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,958
It's not for long.

400
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:15,458
What right does a stranger have
to come between a child and its people?

401
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,000
There's no stew.

402
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:58,083
Oh.

403
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,291
- No problem.
- I'll see what I have.

404
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,291
Thank you.

405
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:04,666
That's the nurse.

406
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:08,791
Ah.

407
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:14,000
Thank you for your help.

408
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,041
How is the wee faker?

409
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,250
She's not well.

410
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,333
But nor does she seem starving.

411
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:31,666
Of course not. She's being fed.

412
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,875
She's got some good tricks.
Whose pawn is she?

413
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:41,250
I didn't think
she'd hook you quite so easy.

414
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,250
<i>She</i> is sincere.

415
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:50,875
Come on.

416
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:55,333
Let me meet her.

417
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:58,666
Fresh eyes.

418
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,333
I could coax the truth
out of your little saint in ten minutes.

419
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:04,416
You rate your powers highly.

420
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,666
I've forbidden the family
from approaching her,

421
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,666
so the truth should come out soon.

422
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,666
By stopping the family,
you're stopping the feeding.

423
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,166
This story of the little girl
who won't eat becomes true.

424
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,333
She could die.

425
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,125
Unless they confess first.

426
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:23,083
If they confess,
they'll be driven from their home,

427
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,000
excommunicated,

428
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,750
hauled in front of the judge
for misrepresentation, concealment,

429
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:30,875
conspiracy to defraud.

430
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:36,875
Think the folk you've been spending
all this time with would bear that well?

431
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,000
Thank you, Maggie.

432
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,291
- Hello, pet.
- Hello.

433
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:14,750
- Hello, Anna.
- Go upstairs, please, Anna.

434
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,625
- Go on.
- It's all right, sweetheart.

435
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,291
Mrs. Wright,
Rosaleen tells me you won't allow her

436
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:29,125
to be with her own child.

437
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:32,166
I'm sorry.

438
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:35,833
But for an objective report,
no one can touch her.

439
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:39,375
You'll never understand.

440
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,958
My only concern,
as the family's parish priest,

441
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,250
is for them to find peace.

442
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,750
So why would you allow
this nonsense?

443
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:52,458
It's not your job to question us, Nurse.

444
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:55,958
You are here only to watch.

445
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:58,958
Then let me.

446
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:04,208
I adore thee,
O most precious cross,

447
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:11,041
adorned by the tender, delicate,
and venerable members of Jesus my Savior,

448
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,666
sprinkled and stained
with his precious blood.

449
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,750
Amen.

450
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:49,708
Look up.

451
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,458
Look at me.

452
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:15,083
Open.

453
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:25,708
Spit it out.

454
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,250
It's all right. Spit it out.

455
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:01,541
Say hello to Will for me, will you?

456
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:05,416
Mr. Byrne? You know him?

457
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:09,208
I knew him when we were little.

458
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:11,375
And then he went to school and…

459
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,416
I didn't.

460
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:15,458
Ah.

461
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:17,666
He's a newspaper man now.

462
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:24,458
His family locked themselves up
in their cabin.

463
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:26,916
After he went away.

464
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:33,333
When the hunger came,

465
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,625
they nailed the door shut from the inside.

466
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:39,833
Why did they do that?

467
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:43,000
Privacy.

468
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:47,291
Save themselves the shame
of dropping down dead in the street.

469
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:49,666
No.

470
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,708
Remember me to him, will you?

471
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:42,208
Mrs. Wright.

472
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:45,166
Mrs. Wright.

473
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:48,291
What's the matter?

474
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:52,875
Kitty told me about your family.
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

475
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:54,125
What about them?

476
00:46:56,708 --> 00:46:57,625
Ah.

477
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:01,458
The most gory bit.

478
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:05,541
You weren't here.

479
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,791
You would have helped them
if you were here.

480
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,208
Thank you.

481
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:53,041
No. Please. Thank <i>you</i>.

482
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,791
I thought you didn't like me.

483
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:07,708
I like who I like.

484
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,166
I had a baby.

485
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,166
She lived three weeks
and two days.

486
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,541
I'm sorry.

487
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,083
Mm-hmm.

488
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:34,791
And your husband?

489
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:40,000
He vanished a few days after.

490
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,833
He may as well have died.

491
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:52,875
I adore thee,
O most precious cross,

492
00:48:53,708 --> 00:49:00,125
adorned by the tender, delicate,
and venerable members of Jesus my Savior,

493
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:04,333
sprinkled and stained
with his precious blood.

494
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:05,458
Amen.

495
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,250
Does Father Thaddeus make you say that
every minute of the day?

496
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:11,791
Not Father Thaddeus.

497
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:13,958
Thirty-three times.

498
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:16,791
And why 33 times?

499
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:20,000
Our Lord's age.
He rose again after three days.

500
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,750
- Ahh…
- Three's a sacred number.

501
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:26,291
Is he a visitor, Mrs. Lib?

502
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:27,416
No, no.

503
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:29,291
That's my friend.

504
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:31,875
Morning, Anna.

505
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:35,500
I'm Will. This is Barry.

506
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:41,666
"There's not a kingdom
through which I haven't traveled,

507
00:49:42,416 --> 00:49:45,541
and, whether it be day or night,
I pass unseen."

508
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:46,708
"What am I?"

509
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,625
Someone invisible,

510
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:52,291
who goes everywhere.

511
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:55,958
- Or something?
- This girl needs no hints.

512
00:49:58,041 --> 00:49:59,041
The wind?

513
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,875
Mr. Byrne has traveled to many kingdoms.

514
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:08,333
He's reported on Russia,

515
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,416
the Punjab, Egypt.

516
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,416
Have you seen the Sphinx of Giza?

517
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,833
Sat on her back too.

518
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:16,875
Seventy feet high.

519
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:20,000
Here.

520
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:25,166
What is it?

521
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:27,291
They call it a thaumatrope.

522
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:31,125
You have to twist the string
between your thumb and forefingers.

523
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:39,125
- Is it trapped or is it free?
- That's for you to decide.

524
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:42,375
Inside. Outside.

525
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:44,541
Inside. Outside.

526
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:47,583
In. Out.

527
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:50,958
In. Out.

528
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:52,625
In.

529
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:55,416
Out. In.

530
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,208
- "And…"
<i>- Out.</i>

531
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:59,500
"…after my ssss…

532
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,083
Skin has been…

533
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:05,125
Des… des…"

534
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:06,916
Destroyed.

535
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,250
"…destroyed…

536
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:13,416
Yet in my… fffl…"

537
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,541
Flesh.

538
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:18,375
"…flesh I will see God."

539
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:21,625
"I myself

540
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:24,000
will see him."

541
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:38,500
Mrs. O'Donnell…

542
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,083
You must see that Anna's getting weaker.

543
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:45,541
She's pale. She's tired.

544
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,416
She's been perfectly fine…

545
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:52,708
All these months
till <i>you</i> kept her from us.

546
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:55,208
Mr. O'Donnell,

547
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:58,291
do you not want your daughter to get well?

548
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:00,750
More than anything.

549
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:02,416
Then ask her to eat.

550
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,666
She made me swear… on her birthday.

551
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:11,375
She made me swear…

552
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:15,250
Never to ask her to eat again.

553
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,041
For my wife…

554
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:42,541
And my children.

555
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:48,958
It's my little ritual.

556
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:55,291
To remember them.

557
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,500
So…

558
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:09,416
Is she reporting any pain?

559
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:12,666
You know Anna never complains.

560
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:22,791
What if she's developed the capacity
to convert sunlight into energy,

561
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:24,166
as plants do?

562
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:26,875
Anna is in danger.

563
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:29,208
The great discoveries of science,

564
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:33,666
from Archimedes to Newton,

565
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:38,041
have always seemed like black magic
at first, have they not, Nurse?

566
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:41,166
It's not science. It's nonsense.
Please. You need to stop the watch.

567
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,291
- Mrs. Wright...
- Anemia, dropsy, scurvy, pellagra...

568
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:45,708
You are a nurse.

569
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:49,125
Please, don't make a diagnosis.

570
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:53,416
You're paid to watch, not to intervene.

571
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,583
You're neither the girl's mother
nor her physician.

572
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:00,083
You're overstepping, madam.

573
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:03,208
If Anna doesn't eat, she could die.

574
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,875
Please just do your job.

575
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:08,416
May I have something to eat, please?

576
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,750
We'll eat in a little while.

577
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:16,750
If she wants something to eat,
she may have it.

578
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,375
There's soup on the side.

579
00:56:20,916 --> 00:56:22,833
Soup would be lovely. Thank you.

580
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:32,791
- It's not hot.
- That's fine.

581
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:35,125
Thank you, Kitty.

582
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,708
Mrs. Lib?

583
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:56,875
Open your mouth, please, Anna.

584
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:03,125
If you won't eat, I have to use force.

585
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:05,541
- Mrs. Lib, no. No, please.
- Open your mouth.

586
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:08,416
- Please, please, please.
- Open your mouth. It will hurt otherwise.

587
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,708
- Open your mouth, Anna.
- No. No. No, no.

588
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:12,583
Anna, please. Anna, down!

589
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:16,083
Open. Open.

590
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:18,125
Anna, open!

591
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:20,333
Open.

592
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:35,000
Stop.

593
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:44,875
I'm sorry.

594
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:48,958
Forgive me.

595
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,041
Anna?

596
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:58,583
Is everything all right?

597
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:04,666
Everything's fine.

598
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:19,750
Are you all right?

599
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,166
- I think we should go back.
- No.

600
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:28,750
- I want to show you something.
- Another time, Anna. Come on.

601
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:29,875
Not you.

602
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:35,291
You.

603
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:41,583
Be ca... Be careful, Anna.

604
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,666
The Holy Well.

605
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,166
We used to come here when we were…

606
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,666
"Turn the pebbles in the…"

607
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:02,250
"Bullaun."

608
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,166
Bullaun.

609
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:10,958
"Rub a clootie on what hurts,
and tie it to the May tree."

610
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:14,625
Yes.

611
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:17,916
"By the time it rots away,

612
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,791
your hurt will be gone."

613
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:23,250
Hmm.

614
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:28,458
I've submitted my article.

615
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:30,625
"Murder by Degrees."

616
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:33,500
You have to try
with the other committee men.

617
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:36,583
- She's going to die.
- Stop it.

618
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,291
Anna?

619
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:47,875
Anna?

620
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:52,208
Anna, I'm here. I'm here.

621
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:03,333
Give her to me. Give her to me.
You can't take her in. Come on, Anna.

622
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:05,250
- This has to end, Lib.
- Come on.

623
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:12,375
Anna?!

624
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,833
Here she is.
Here she is. Here she is.

625
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,541
It's just a faint, Mammy.

626
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,875
Is there…

627
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:37,625
Is there anything I can get you?

628
01:00:41,916 --> 01:00:42,958
Nothin'?

629
01:00:45,666 --> 01:00:47,916
Nothin' at all, Anna?

630
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,666
Just a little sleep, Mammy.

631
01:00:56,416 --> 01:00:58,250
And then, I'll awake.

632
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,833
Then you'll wake.

633
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:22,833
How is she?

634
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:39,375
"Little A-Anna O'Donnell…

635
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:43,125
The last s-surviving child

636
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:46,000
of a humble bog man,

637
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,583
appears to need no more

638
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:51,375
n-nourishment than air."

639
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,958
- Best teacher I could have.
- Why is she in that chair?

640
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:00,291
Dr. McBrearty brought it.

641
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,708
Borrowed it from Sir Otway.

642
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:05,458
Just till Anna's back on her feet.

643
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:14,458
Lean forward, please, Anna.

644
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:33,041
Breathe in.

645
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,250
And again.

646
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:26,666
In.

647
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:30,291
Out.

648
01:03:32,916 --> 01:03:34,500
In.

649
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:38,250
Out.

650
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:55,083
Sit up. Up.

651
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:57,625
Squeeze my arm. Squeeze it.

652
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:11,000
- Thank you, Sister.
- You're a little early.

653
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,208
- Anna.
- Goodbye.

654
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,083
- Thank you.
- Good day.

655
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:40,416
"Manna from Heaven."

656
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:44,250
You lived off manna from Heaven.

657
01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:52,708
"A mother's kiss is sacred."

658
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,666
You don't understand us.

659
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:02,625
I don't, but…

660
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:06,500
I do understand

661
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:09,000
that your mother spat chewed-up food…

662
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,291
Manna from Heaven.

663
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:12,291
- …from her mouth…
- From God.

664
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,625
- …In order to sustain you.
- Manna.

665
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:17,833
Food, Anna.

666
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:18,875
Food.

667
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:25,708
'Twas a holy secret.

668
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:28,041
A mystery.

669
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:30,375
Anna…

670
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:32,916
Anna, I have to tell.

671
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:35,625
I have to.

672
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:38,916
It's what I'm here for,
to find out the truth.

673
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:42,416
Then eat.

674
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:52,583
What if your mother could kiss you again?

675
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:54,666
What if…

676
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:57,833
What if God

677
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:02,208
could provide manna again?

678
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:08,916
Why won't you eat, Anna?

679
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:11,291
I adore thee…

680
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:15,458
O most precious cross…

681
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:19,750
Adorned by the tender,

682
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:23,833
delicate, and venerable members…

683
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,333
Your prayer.

684
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:33,708
Thirty-three times.

685
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:38,333
Whilst fasting.

686
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:42,000
But to what end, Anna? What for?

687
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:46,250
One soul will be released.

688
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,291
Released?

689
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:52,083
From Hell.

690
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:57,000
Your brother?

691
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:04,625
H... He must be so close now.

692
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,333
Anna,

693
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:12,833
fasting means skipping one meal,
not all of them.

694
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,458
That's to atone.

695
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:26,583
I have to save him

696
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:28,875
from all of the burning.

697
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:34,833
He is burning all the time.

698
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:37,458
- No.
- No, Mrs. Lib.

699
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:40,375
That's what hell is.

700
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,375
- No.
- It's ceaseless.

701
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:45,208
Anna, he was just a boy.

702
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:49,000
He was just a child.
Why would he be burning?

703
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:55,375
What did he do?

704
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,041
He said it was double.

705
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:09,458
Double?

706
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:14,166
Double love.

707
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:19,041
A sister…

708
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:22,583
And a wife.

709
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And I…

710
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:39,958
How old were you?

711
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:46,208
Nine.

712
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:54,791
Just the once?

713
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:03,791
Love is forever.

714
01:10:06,666 --> 01:10:09,000
He told me like it was a story.

715
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:13,041
We married in the night.

716
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:20,166
And then he got sick.

717
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,291
It...

718
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:26,416
It wasn't holy.
He was being punished.

719
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:31,708
And…

720
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:34,625
And Mammy said…

721
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:41,250
- That it was my fault he'd been taken.
- No.

722
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:44,791
No. That is not true.

723
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,666
That is not true, Anna.

724
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:50,583
No.

725
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:58,833
I loved him back.

726
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:20,458
You have urgent information
pertaining to the watch, Mrs. Wright?

727
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:22,333
I do.

728
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,750
Go ahead.

729
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:28,166
Anna O'Donnell is dying.

730
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:32,375
- Mrs. Wright...
- She can barely stand up.

731
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:33,875
She can barely move.

732
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:37,916
She's feverish,
and her pulse rate quickens by the hour.

733
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,250
If you have medical concerns
about the patient,

734
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:45,708
may I ask you come to me,
rather than summoning everybody...

735
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:48,708
Our watch, sir, has thwarted
the one thing that has kept her alive

736
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:50,041
for the past four months.

737
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:53,875
Go on.

738
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:02,208
Anna's mother, Mrs. O'Donnell,

739
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:05,791
has been passing her food
from her own mouth.

740
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,791
She cups her face and kisses her
good morning and good night,

741
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:13,208
and she feeds her daughter with each kiss.

742
01:13:14,541 --> 01:13:15,625
Like a bird.

743
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:21,166
Now that you have the answer,
I am begging you, you must stop the watch

744
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:24,125
and make every effort
in keeping this girl from dying.

745
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:27,291
Lies.

746
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:30,625
I am not lying.

747
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:36,708
It was a mistake,
a terrible mistake, to bring a nurse here.

748
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:38,625
An <i>English</i> nurse.

749
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:40,791
What reason would I have to lie?

750
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,250
"Murder by Degrees," Mrs. Wright.

751
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:46,916
Take that up with the journalist.
She did not write that.

752
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,333
Well, how else did he catch a glimpse
of the fasting girl?

753
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:52,875
Perhaps you should interrogate Mr. Byrne
rather than me.

754
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:56,916
Stopped that little girl
from seeing her own mother and father.

755
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,333
- But handed her over to some journalist.
- I have only done as you have asked of me.

756
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,083
Sister Michael,

757
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,625
have you observed this practice
between mother and child?

758
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,666
Have not, Sir Otway.

759
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:20,208
- There. Lies!
- I'm not lying.

760
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:22,708
- She's making it all up.
- I am not lying.

761
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,583
- She should not have come here.
- I am telling you the truth.

762
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:31,416
Perhaps we might ask Anna herself.

763
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:39,083
Very well.

764
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,291
Bring the child in.

765
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:50,333
Come through.

766
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:14,166
There she is.

767
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:19,125
Anna…

768
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:25,875
Mrs. Wright has shared something with us

769
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:27,916
that she has observed

770
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:31,750
between you and your mother.

771
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:38,541
Does your mother feed you, Anna?

772
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:40,791
Pass food…

773
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:44,041
From her mouth to yours?

774
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:57,166
Let me ask
a little more plainly, if I may.

775
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:01,333
Have you eaten anything

776
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,458
in the past four months, Anna?

777
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:16,250
Manna from Heaven.

778
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,833
That is all.

779
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:21,958
Well done, Anna.

780
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:27,916
You will carry on
with the watch as planned, Mrs. Wright.

781
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,750
- Fools.
- The watch will continue.

782
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:33,625
She just told us.
She found the reason.

783
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:36,041
We all agreed to the watch,

784
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:38,375
and we shall see it through.

785
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:43,500
I will nurse her until she dies.

786
01:16:46,791 --> 01:16:48,833
As I have done many times before.

787
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:52,416
I have nothing more to say.

788
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:59,416
I'll be offering a solemn Mass for you
tomorrow night.

789
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,291
To pray for strength and hope

790
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:06,208
and for your recovery, Anna.

791
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:07,708
Thank you, Father.

792
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:06,500
Good girl.

793
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:08,166
Good girl. All done.

794
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,833
All done.

795
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:14,375
Lie back. Go on.

796
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:16,625
There you go.

797
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:18,583
Close your eyes.

798
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:25,375
She's dying.

799
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,666
She's chosen.

800
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,750
She's not chosen. She's a child.

801
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,958
- You don't know us.
- Wait.

802
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:46,333
I'm sure that's true in many ways.

803
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:52,458
And I'm sure there's much about your life
that I don't understand.

804
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:57,291
But I do know grief

805
01:18:58,625 --> 01:18:59,791
and loss.

806
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:05,541
And the pain of losing a child
is something I do know.

807
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:10,083
I didn't…

808
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:14,750
Abandoning Anna to die
when you could have prevented it

809
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,333
is a terrible thing.

810
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,750
This is for her salvation.

811
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:32,083
Perhaps you could
kiss her good night again?

812
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:36,041
Or good morning.

813
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:40,958
- Or goodbye...
- This life is so short, Mrs. Wright.

814
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:46,125
The next is for eternity.

815
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:53,166
My children… will be in Heaven.

816
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,750
- That's insane.
- Ugh!

817
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:50,541
- That's insanity, Lib!
- Fine. Don't help. That's fine.

818
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:54,375
- You can't take a child from its family.
- They don't want her!

819
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:57,583
You've fundamentally misunderstood
these people, my people.

820
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:58,666
That man loves her.

821
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:03,666
Love requires some action,
some intervention, at some point.

822
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:07,916
- Not just standing by...
- His faith, his prayer, is his action.

823
01:21:08,666 --> 01:21:11,208
- You don't understand...
- Perhaps. Yes, perhaps.

824
01:21:11,291 --> 01:21:14,500
But this isn't some philosophical point
that we can debate.

825
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:18,500
This is a child's life,
and they are killing her.

826
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,750
You wrote so yourself.
Or were you just lying?

827
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,875
- Her mother and father...
- Have failed her.

828
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:27,125
- That's not...
- Will you help me?

829
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:31,125
The family will be at Mass this evening.
This is my last chance to help her.

830
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:32,958
To do something good here. Please.

831
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:36,625
The sun sets at nine.
Will you come then to the well?

832
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:43,500
This could be something new
for each of us.

833
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:47,166
A new story. A new life.

834
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,458
I don't want that.

835
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:51,500
I'm not asking you
to fall in love with me.

836
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,083
I'm asking you to help and maybe…

837
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:59,708
Maybe live a different way
and find contentment in a different place.

838
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:00,791
No.

839
01:22:10,916 --> 01:22:12,458
If you don't want to come…

840
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:18,041
I'd love you...

841
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,333
I want you to come.

842
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:25,250
But if you don't want to,
can you just get us as far as Dublin?

843
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:26,833
Please. That's all. Nothing else.

844
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:31,916
It's not a small thing
you're asking of me.

845
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:36,250
It's kidnapping, Lib. We'd end up in jail.

846
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:38,958
Don't you wish someone had fought
for the lives of your family?

847
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:44,666
I'm sorry.

848
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,666
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

849
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:50,708
Will, no. No. Please.
Please, Will. Please. I'm sorry.

850
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,041
Anna.

851
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:14,458
Anna, I need you to wake up.

852
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:17,791
Anna.

853
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:26,000
Am I going to God's side?

854
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:29,916
Yes.

855
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:33,583
It's nearly time.

856
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:38,541
Anna's going to God.

857
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:44,791
Anna's going to die now.

858
01:24:57,208 --> 01:24:58,375
What if…

859
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:02,208
What if…

860
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:04,541
Once Anna dies…

861
01:25:06,291 --> 01:25:07,541
You wake up.

862
01:25:10,041 --> 01:25:11,458
A new little girl.

863
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:14,500
Nine years old.

864
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:21,125
Nothing bad has ever happened
to this little girl.

865
01:25:31,375 --> 01:25:32,833
What might her name be?

866
01:25:38,916 --> 01:25:39,916
Hey?

867
01:25:44,041 --> 01:25:45,125
Nan?

868
01:25:46,291 --> 01:25:47,291
Nan.

869
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:50,375
Of course.

870
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,791
Anna's going to die.

871
01:25:58,166 --> 01:25:59,208
Yes.

872
01:26:01,916 --> 01:26:03,416
Anna's going to die,

873
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:07,333
but Nan is going to live.

874
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,708
It's time to go to God now, Anna.

875
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:31,916
It's all right.

876
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:35,375
It's all right. I'm here.

877
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:40,000
Close your eyes.

878
01:26:43,708 --> 01:26:44,708
Go on.

879
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:51,666
Shh…

880
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Go on.

881
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:03,500
There you go.

882
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,166
There you go.

883
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:13,083
Goodbye, Anna.

884
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:25,166
Nan?

885
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:35,583
Nan?

886
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:45,250
You can wake up now, Nan.

887
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:52,916
Nan?

888
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:10,083
Am I Nan?

889
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,500
Yes.

890
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:23,083
Yes, you are Nan.

891
01:32:01,041 --> 01:32:02,291
It's all in here.

892
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:32,000
"8:22 p.m. Severe lung congestion."

893
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:37,250
"8:43 p.m. Delirium."

894
01:32:38,458 --> 01:32:41,708
"8:49 p.m. Breathing distressed."

895
01:32:42,416 --> 01:32:44,083
"Heartbeat irregular."

896
01:32:45,291 --> 01:32:47,125
"8:57 p.m.

897
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,041
Death."

898
01:32:55,875 --> 01:32:57,125
Now, what…

899
01:32:58,166 --> 01:32:59,833
Puzzles me is…

900
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:04,541
How did the cabin go up in flames…

901
01:33:06,416 --> 01:33:07,416
Mrs. Wright?

902
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:12,958
I confess…

903
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:17,083
When she died, I was frantic.

904
01:33:19,291 --> 01:33:21,166
When I tried to revive her,

905
01:33:21,916 --> 01:33:23,291
m-my s…

906
01:33:25,041 --> 01:33:26,041
The lamp…

907
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:29,958
My dress must have knocked it over.

908
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:34,666
You were hired to watch her,

909
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:37,000
and all you left us with
was a pile of ash.

910
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:39,833
Not her bones even?
How hard have they tried?

911
01:33:40,416 --> 01:33:43,291
Difficulties compounded by heavy rain.

912
01:33:43,375 --> 01:33:46,166
- Unbelievable.
- The ruins will become a shrine.

913
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:48,041
Oh,
stop with your nonsense, Flynn.

914
01:33:48,125 --> 01:33:49,625
If there was a body to be cut open,

915
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:52,125
you'd have found a hungry child
starved to death.

916
01:33:52,208 --> 01:33:55,208
Nothing but holiness
would you have found there.

917
01:33:55,291 --> 01:33:58,208
Our first saint since the Dark Ages.

918
01:33:58,291 --> 01:34:03,708
- Father, for goodness' sake.
- Nothing has been proven, Flynn.

919
01:34:03,791 --> 01:34:04,750
That is true.

920
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:09,291
Because this woman has destroyed
any evidence of a miracle

921
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:10,958
by burning down the house.

922
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:14,041
- Jesus Christ.
- Is that an accusation?

923
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:15,875
Of course it's an accusation.

924
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:18,541
- This is a matter for the police.
- Enough.

925
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:23,583
The most pressing question,

926
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:26,250
a... as I see it,

927
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:32,458
is how much liability
could be attached to a nurse

928
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:35,500
acting in the capacity of a servant

929
01:34:36,708 --> 01:34:38,041
to this committee?

930
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:49,791
You will remain here

931
01:34:50,541 --> 01:34:54,125
until the head constable says you may go.

932
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:57,166
And it goes without saying

933
01:34:57,833 --> 01:35:00,708
that you won't receive your payment.

934
01:35:24,166 --> 01:35:25,666
Does it hurt?

935
01:35:27,791 --> 01:35:28,833
Mm.

936
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:32,375
Awful.

937
01:35:33,916 --> 01:35:36,166
That they allowed it to go on for so long.

938
01:35:37,083 --> 01:35:38,875
That a little girl should die.

939
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,250
These men…

940
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:01,916
Can I…

941
01:36:04,541 --> 01:36:05,916
Can I ask you something?

942
01:36:10,416 --> 01:36:11,375
Mm-hmm.

943
01:36:12,458 --> 01:36:14,375
Before I found you last night…

944
01:36:17,916 --> 01:36:19,875
I believe I was granted…

945
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:22,125
A vision.

946
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:29,250
I was too uneasy
to stay to the end of Mass, you see.

947
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,500
And on my way to the house,

948
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,083
I saw…

949
01:36:40,125 --> 01:36:41,333
An angel

950
01:36:42,875 --> 01:36:44,291
on horseback,

951
01:36:44,875 --> 01:36:47,041
riding away with Anna.

952
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:07,875
Has she gone to a better place?

953
01:37:08,791 --> 01:37:10,333
Can you promise me that?

954
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:19,750
I promise.
