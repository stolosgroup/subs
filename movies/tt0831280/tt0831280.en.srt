If you're watching this right now,

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,130
it's because you've forgotten,

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,770
why you've locked yourself
in your apartment.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,500
You've given yourself 30 days,

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,340
to figure out why you're so messed up.

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,380
Your phone's been turned off.

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,860
You don't have shit.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,890
You don't have friends.
You don't have a job.

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,130
This is your last chance.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,570
'Cause I swear to God,

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,970
if things don't change
in these next 30 days...

12
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,980
...I will kill myself.

Madison.

21
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,090
Madison, wake up.

22
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,630
Madison, can you hear me?

23
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,530
I'm Dr. Barnes.

24
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,670
Can I have some water?

25
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,840
Can you tell me your full name?

26
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,350
Madison Walker.

27
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,720
Do you know what month it is?

28
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,390
June?

29
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,730
July?

30
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,710
Have you ever been treated
for any type for of mental illness?

31
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,110
I take medication.

32
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,910
And what do you
take medication for?

33
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,280
I don't know.

34
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,360
You don't know
what you take medication for,

35
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,760
or you were never told
what the medication was for?

36
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,630
I don't understand the question.

37
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,230
When can I go home?

38
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,100
Are you having
any suicidal thoughts now?

39
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,530
No.

40
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,640
Can you tell me
what happened last night?

41
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,320
I don't remember.

42
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,750
Well, if you don't remember,

43
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,190
then how do you know that you
didn't try to take your life?

44
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,230
Because I know I wouldn't do that.

45
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,260
Have you ever spent any time
in a psychiatric hospital?

46
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,400
No.

47
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,970
Would you ever consider
checking yourself in to one?

48
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,050
No.

49
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,280
I have that book.

50
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,320
Excuse me?

51
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,860
I'm gonna give you my number,

52
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,370
and, uh, I want you to call me
if you need anything.

53
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,900
My mom burned them all.

54
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,370
Burned what?

55
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,230
My notebooks.

56
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,470
But I hid one so she couldn't find it.

57
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,050
Why did you hide that one
and not the others?

58
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,710
Because I needed you to find it.

59
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,260
Uh, I was sitting up front
in his station wagon,

60
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,810
and he had these, um,
red plastic seat covers.

61
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,040
It made a noise when he moved.

62
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,980
And there was, like, um, a plastic...

63
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,420
Jesus figurine on the dashboard.

64
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,290
Why were you alone
in the car with him?

65
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,290
Uh, well, it was like, um...
like a field trip to the... to the zoo,

66
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,300
and, uh... and the bus
was all filled up,

67
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,370
so, um, I rode with him in the car.

68
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,000
What happened... in the car?

69
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,140
It's okay. You can tell me.

70
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,940
It's okay.

71
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,950
Um...

72
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,810
He kissed me.

73
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,360
Did he try to...

74
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,320
touch you, or...

75
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,660
Why didn't you tell your parents
what happened?

76
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,360
Um...

77
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,460
I told my mom.

78
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,060
And what did she say?

79
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,610
Um... She didn't believe me.

80
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,710
How could she not believe you?

81
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,750
She said that, uh, a man of God
would never do something like that.

82
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,820
What do you mean, "a man of God"?

83
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,320
Um, he was our priest.

84
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,020
Okay, so, I guess
you just fell on that razor.

85
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,360
Uh-huh.

86
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,660
You know what your problem is?

87
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,070
You're too fucking white.

88
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,940
You see, Black people...
we don't let shit get to us.

89
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,030
I mean, seriously,

90
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,910
that's why you don't see Black girls
up in the loony bin.

91
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,950
Because we don't let shit bother us.

92
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,950
We don't give a fuck.

93
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,640
What are you waving at
with that tired-ass...

94
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,950
- I'm not interested.
- I'm not selling.

95
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,920
Glad we got that straight.

96
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,390
You know, tell me something,
beautiful.

97
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,200
I bet you like to get fucked
really hard, hmm?

98
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,880
Tell Daddy what you like.

99
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,450
Uh, since when do you smoke?

100
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,450
What... what the hell
is your problem?

101
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,880
Hello?

102
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,220
Mm.

103
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,290
Where were we?

104
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,140
Put your hands around my throat.

105
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,970
What?

106
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,600
Oh.

107
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,070
Harder.

108
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,830
Yeah. Yeah, you like that?

109
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,770
Choke me.

110
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,540
Choke me. Choke me.

111
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,480
Please stop.

112
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,740
You like getting fucked.

113
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,380
Please stop. Please.

114
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,800
I know what you want me to say.

115
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,300
What do you think
I want you to say?

116
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,540
That they took advantage of me
because I was only 13.

117
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,680
Well, do you think
they took advantage of you?

118
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,690
No.

119
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,110
They got you drunk with the intention
of having sex with you.

120
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,660
Look, they've been married
for, like, 100 years.

121
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,530
They needed something
to spice it up.

122
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,200
Did you have any feelings for...
either one of them?

123
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,240
I liked him better.

124
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,040
And where is he now?

125
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,180
He killed himself.

126
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,200
What do you want?

127
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,240
Your rent.
You're like a week late.

128
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,310
It's due on the 1st.

129
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,540
Today is the 9th, sweetheart.

130
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,710
I'll have it tomorrow.

131
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,380
No, you...

132
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,480
Tomorrow's too late, sweetheart.
Open the door.

133
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,130
Tomorrow's too late.

134
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,030
But, now, if you wanted
to do some trading

135
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,890
like we did back in March...

136
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,090
I'll work with you.

137
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,130
I don't know what you're talking about.

138
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,750
You have my money by tomorrow
morning or you're out of here.

139
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,770
Margaret,
we can't keep doing this.

140
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,480
I can.

141
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,170
Why do you want to?

142
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,340
'Cause.

143
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,880
'Cause why?

144
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,590
Because I'd rather slit my wrist

145
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,130
or be fucking hung upside down
and beaten to a pulp

146
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,060
than have to talk to you.

147
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,190
You're angry.

148
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,060
No.

149
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,900
Don't start that psychological shit.

150
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,400
You really don't like me, do you?

151
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,170
Beth, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

152
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,870
It's not that...
that I don't like you.

153
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,740
I fucking hate you.

154
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,020
Why?

155
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,490
"Why?" "Why?"

156
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,760
Because people that are scared
make me sick.

157
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,900
You think that I'm scared?

158
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,630
I don't know, Beth.
Are you scared?

159
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,600
Hmm? What happened to you?

160
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,610
Tell me.

161
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,840
You gonna say
any-fucking-thing? No?

162
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,350
No, I can play that game, too.

163
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,410
Cool.

164
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,780
I'll go back to bed.

Maddie?

170
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,620
Hi, Dad.

171
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,170
A friend of yours, Greg Hicks,
got married last week.

172
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,000
Did you hear?

173
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,370
No.

174
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,780
Yeah.

175
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,640
They had the wedding
over at the Episcopal church

176
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,880
on, uh, Fitz Morris street.

177
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,110
Hurricane knocked down everything
on that street except that church.

178
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,290
Is everything all right with you?

179
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,690
Yeah, same as usual.

180
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,320
That's good. That's good.

181
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,330
You need money?

182
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,770
Dad, I didn't come here
to ask you for money.

183
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,070
Well, I know you didn't.

184
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,840
I just... but it's okay if you...
if you need it.

185
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,610
I don't know how much I can give,

186
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,380
'cause your mother's insurance
got pulled again.

187
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,920
Who's there, Steven?

188
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,620
Tell me I'm not dreaming.

189
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,920
Hi, Mom.

190
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,290
My angel's come home!

191
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,160
Look at you!
Look how long your hair is!

192
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,170
Steven, why didn't you come
and tell me my little angel was here?

193
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,960
Well, I thought you were sleeping.

194
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,000
Sleep? Who has time for sleep?

195
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,570
Steven, did you get her some food?

196
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,510
Well, I... I didn't think
that she wanted any.

197
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,310
Yeah, no, I'm... I'm not hungry.

198
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,310
Oh, nonsense.

199
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,380
You sit right here,
and daddy will get you some food.

200
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,820
You are skinny as a scarecrow!

201
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,250
Daddy said you're doing
some telemarketing.

202
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,400
How is that going?

203
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,190
Uh, it's fine.

204
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,990
Oh, Maddie, please tell me

205
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,700
you're not still living
in that awful French Quarter.

206
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,070
I am still living
in that awful French Quarter.

207
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,180
Someone like you should not be
living in a place like that.

208
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,440
It's enough to tempt anyone.

209
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,010
- Is that meat?
- Uh-huh.

210
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,380
I don't feel like red meat.

211
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,780
My blood is thick today.
It needs poultry.

212
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,120
Want me to make you some chicken?

213
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,120
It's not very attractive
being so skinny, Maddie.

214
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,590
It makes your face sink in.

215
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,920
A woman should be soft and round,
the way God made her.

216
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,300
Mmm!

217
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,670
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

218
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,530
Mmm. Meat, yes.

219
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,480
Tell him everyone that you love.

220
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,910
Dear God, I love my mama,
my daddy, my uncle Pete.

221
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,610
Tell God you love His only son,
our Lord Jesus Christ.

222
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,450
Dear God, I love your only son,
Jesus Christ.

223
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,550
Our Lord Jesus Christ.

224
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,860
Our Lord Jesus Christ.

225
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,690
Tell Him to forgive you
for the sins you have committed.

226
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,130
What sins, Mama?

227
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,790
Tell Him your sins.

228
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,870
But I haven't sinned.

229
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,940
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

230
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,140
Watch over my daughter, and
cleanse her of her wrong doings.

231
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,130
Put your hand on the Bible

232
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,790
and swear your life over
to Jesus Christ.

233
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,700
- I don't want to.
- Do it.

234
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,270
I swear my life over
to Jesus Christ.

235
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,920
I would have put
fresh sheets on the bed

236
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,580
had I known you were coming.

237
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,830
It's okay. I'm not staying.

238
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,350
Why not?

239
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,430
Because I have my own place.

240
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,030
You're being tempted living
in that awful French Quarter.

241
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,760
Oh, God, Mother, don't start.

242
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,340
You want to spend your days
in eternal hell?

243
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,570
As long as you're not there.

244
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,440
Listen to the filth
coming out of your mouth.

245
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,450
What has happened to you?

246
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,210
I wonder.

247
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,980
You're a heathen! Look at you!

248
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,420
I can see it in your eyes.
He's robbed your soul!

249
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,260
Dolly, come to bed now.

250
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,130
I can see it in her eyes, Steven!
She's got him crawling all over her!

251
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,790
Listen to how she speaks to me!

252
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,730
It's all right.
You just go on to bed.

253
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,700
Go on to bed. It's all right.
It's all right.

254
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,770
She's sick, honey.
She doesn't mean it.

255
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,210
You're still making excuses for her?

256
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,820
I'm not making excuses.

257
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,320
You're defending her.

258
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,010
Well, she loves you.

259
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,690
She thinks I'm Satan.

260
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,850
Oh, that's just...
that's just her sickness talking.

261
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,220
She doesn't really think that.

262
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,360
Well, she needs medication!

263
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,430
Just look... just...

264
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,020
Sweetheart, just...

265
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,330
Hey, keep your voice down.

266
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,730
Dad, why are you still
protecting her?

267
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,340
Well, I'm not protecting her, I...

268
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,140
Yeah.

269
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,570
Whatever.

270
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,140
Please, sweetheart...

271
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,180
Just, Maddie,
please stay the night.

272
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,550
We never get to see you.

273
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,550
I have work tomorrow.

274
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,680
Mama?!

275
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,980
Mama?!

276
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,410
Mama! Please!

277
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,720
I didn't do anything wrong!

278
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,690
Please don't leave me in here!

279
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,960
I didn't do anything wrong!

280
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,240
Okay, and here,
we'll just, once again,

281
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,290
use the little crisscross strokes.

282
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,650
That's a nice little gray sky there.

283
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,160
So, tell you what...
let's take some of that same color...

284
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,890
Just the black and the blue.
That's all we need.

285
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,620
Come on.
You know you want it.

286
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,400
You can add more of the black.

287
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,030
You can gray it down
or leave it brighter.

288
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,660
Dang! 89!

289
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,470
Lexy, shut up!

290
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,560
- Grace Matthews.
- Margaret.

291
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,340
Be right back.

292
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,610
Margaret, don't...
don't give me evil stares.

293
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,810
Margaret Jones.

294
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,980
Alexis, Grace, Margaret,

295
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,490
I have a very exciting project
I want to talk to you about.

296
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,350
Can you please all come
to the meeting area?

297
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,720
Alexis, shut up!

298
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,120
Just for about 10 minutes.

299
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,350
Um, I was watching that.

300
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,660
Sorry.

301
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,630
Grace, could you please
come over here?

302
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,890
Elizabeth! I was watching that.

303
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,090
Alexis!

304
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,670
Elizabeth, I'm...
I'm playing a game.

305
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,570
1, 2, 3, 4...

306
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,660
Alexis!

307
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,110
Okay.

308
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,650
I have three video cameras.

309
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,520
I want you to use these
to express yourselves...

310
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,710
any thoughts or feelings
that you may have.

311
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,880
Like a... like a diary?

312
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,590
Yes, like a diary.
Could you please cross your legs?

313
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,460
Thank you.
Here's your camera.

314
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,930
Here you go.

315
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,660
I don't have any thoughts.

316
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,270
I don't have any thoughts.
I don't have any memories.

317
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,140
I was watching the fucking TV.

318
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,070
I'm sure you'll think of something.

319
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,080
That is not okay.
That's inappropriate.

320
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,170
Pick that up, Margaret, now.

321
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,010
Margaret, pick it up,
'cause that's very inappropriate.

322
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,710
Pick it up.
Margaret, pick it up.

323
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,840
Pick it up. Pick it up.

324
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,250
Take the camera, Margaret.

325
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,820
I don't want to do this project
with any of you guys!

326
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,290
All right, that is not okay.
That is not okay. Sit down!

327
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,690
It is okay, okay?!
Get out of my seat!

328
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,760
It's not necessary, really.
She's fine.

329
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,170
Sit down.

330
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,130
I'll be waiting for you, sweetheart.

331
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,100
Shh. Shh.

332
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,040
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

333
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,080
Ow.

334
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,610
30 tapes, 30 days.

335
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,030
How long have you been
having these blackouts

336
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,670
that you keep talking about?

337
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,410
Since I was 12... or 13.

338
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,220
And what's the longest
you've ever blacked out?

339
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,620
Two months.

340
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,490
Two months?

341
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,890
What happened?

342
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,670
I... woke up...

343
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,170
In New York on a subway.

344
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,100
And do you know
how you got there?

345
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,710
No, I don't remember anything.

346
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,540
And how do you know that you were
in New York for two months?

347
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:05,380
Um, because I found
a bus ticket in my bag

348
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,790
that said it was
from New Orleans to New York.

349
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,560
It must be really scary
to not be able to remember.

350
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,980
I can deal with it.

351
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,970
Why do you think you have to deal
with everything all by yourself?

352
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,960
Do you think I'm crazy?

353
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,230
I think you should
check yourself in to the hospital.

354
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,780
This is the first time in 13 years...

355
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,620
that I haven't taken medication.

356
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,960
I don't know...

357
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,630
I don't know
what's really happening. Uh...

358
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,210
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

359
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,110
I know that...

360
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,610
I know that you can hear me.

361
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,290
I'm in my apartment right now...

362
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,850
And, uh... and...

363
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,390
I don't...

364
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,230
I don't really remember...

365
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,670
much of, like, where I've...

366
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,140
where I've been
and what I've been doing,

367
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,770
and, uh...

368
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,480
It's kind of a scary feeling.

369
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:21,710
The first time I tried to kill myself,
I was, uh, 13,

370
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,850
and my mom had
these crowns of thorns.

371
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,190
Um, and she had this particular one
that was really special to her.

372
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,320
And... and so I put that one
on my head.

373
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:39,530
And I cut my wrists and my ankles,
and I laid down on the floor

374
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,200
so that I was beautiful and peaceful,
just like Jesus.

375
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,340
And, um... and I thought
when she found me,

376
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,040
she'd be really happy,
because she loves Him so much.

377
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,020
Um, and then she...

378
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,750
she came into the room
and she saw me lying there.

379
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,480
And, um...

380
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,430
And she was really mad.

381
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,430
And... and that's when I knew
that she'd never...

382
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,870
never love me
as much as she loves Jesus.

383
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,810
The first time
I tried to commit suicide,

384
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:22,180
I was 16.

385
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,710
I got pregnant
and had to have an abortion.

386
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,460
I didn't have any money,
and I couldn't tell my parents,

387
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,660
so I had to have it done by this guy
who said he could do it real cheap.

388
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,700
But he messed up,
and now I can't have kids.

389
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,970
So, uh, here, Elizabeth.
Here's a little thought for you.

390
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,000
Every time you walk into the room...

391
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,600
I want to take your fucking face

392
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,950
and smash it against the ground.

393
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,940
Margaret, what are you doing?

394
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,780
- What are you doing? That is...
- Ahh!

395
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,020
This is not funny.

396
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,350
Fucker!
Why don't you let me do it?!

397
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,440
I have no... no concept of...
of time or what time is.

398
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,750
I don't understand it.

399
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,180
I mean, is it even real?
Because I don't remember...

400
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,380
I don't remember so many things.

401
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,260
What's your magical power
going to be?

402
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,860
I don't want one.

403
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,340
But you have to.
Come on, just pick one.

404
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,670
I want to be invisible.

405
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,300
But if you're invisible,
then I can't see you.

406
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,970
And if I can't see you,
we can't be friends.

407
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,340
We're friends?

408
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,150
Madison!
Madison, where are you?!

409
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,310
I have to go.

410
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,980
You don't have to go.
We can hide here.

411
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,280
She won't find us.

412
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,050
Madison Ann Walker,
I'm going to count to three!

413
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,100
Madison?

414
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,260
Huh?

415
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,490
Where were you just now?

416
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,300
Madison.

417
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,200
What?

418
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,270
Come sit down.

419
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,130
Why can't you look at me?

420
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,030
I don't know.

421
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,130
Well, if you ever feel uncomfortable,

422
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,460
you tell me, and we'll fix it.

423
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,200
Why are you being so nice to me?

424
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,680
Hasn't anyone ever been
nice to you?

425
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,760
We'll just, once again,
use the little crisscross strokes.

426
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,020
You can add more of the black.

427
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,430
You can gray it down
or leave it brighter.

428
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,660
It all depends on you.

429
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,490
You want to paint my nails for me?

430
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,640
Is it... is it at all possible

431
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,730
that you can not be a skank
for one second

432
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,470
when I'm watching my show?

433
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,970
No.

434
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,600
Get off my fucking couch.

435
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,270
Make me.

436
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,440
Yeah?

437
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,610
Margaret, come get your meds.

438
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,050
Just, once again,
use a little crisscross stroke.

439
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,520
- Bitch.
- Mm-hmm.

440
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,650
Checkmate.

441
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,090
Checkmate.

442
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,700
Checkmate. Checkmate.

443
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,670
Checkmate, checkmate,
checkmate! Aaaaaah!

444
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,260
Aah! Aaaaaah!

445
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,810
Checkmate.

446
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,450
Psst!

447
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,290
She can't help you.

448
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,490
Your precious doctor...

449
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,260
That isn't even a doctor.

450
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,330
She's just gonna make you worse.

451
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,260
And what makes you the expert?

452
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:42,070
Well, I've been here the longest.

453
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,480
I can see why.

454
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,380
You're gonna need me.

455
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,780
How's that?

456
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,440
- Leave her alone, Margaret.
- Shut up! You'll be the first to go.

457
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,320
You don't scare me.

458
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,120
I bet I can.

459
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,450
Aaaaaaaaaahh!

460
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,530
Aah! Stop it, Margaret!
Leave me alone!

461
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,530
Please leave me alone!
Let me go!

462
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:08,190
No! No! No! Aah!

463
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,530
Margaret, give it back!

464
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,470
Margaret, give it back! Stop it!

465
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,640
I don't think anybody
knows me anymore.

466
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,280
I'm... I'm a stranger...

467
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,250
I'm a stranger to everyone, and I'm...

468
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,090
I'm a stranger to myself.

469
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,710
Margaret, you're not meant
to be in my room.

470
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:28,870
Go now.
You're not meant to be in here.

471
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,310
You know that she's gonna...

472
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,410
watch those tapes and use them
to keep you locked in here, right?

473
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,150
Margaret, can you...
can you go now?

474
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,120
What? You think she cares?

475
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,280
Can you please stop this
and leave me alone?

476
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,490
Can you... can you go now,
please, Margaret?

477
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,900
Margaret, please, can you go now?

478
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,970
Please leave me alone.
Otherwise, I'm gonna tell.

479
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,230
I'll tell. I will. You know I will.

480
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,970
If you tell, then...

481
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,600
Then you're gonna go
where all the bad girls go.

482
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,800
No. No.
Because I'm not bad, Margaret.

483
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,900
You are very bad.

484
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,210
No, I'm not. I'm not bad.

485
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,370
- You're bad.
- Shh. Shh.

486
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,110
You're the one who's bad,
Margaret, not me.

487
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,720
I'm not... I'm not bad.

488
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,840
I want to talk.

489
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,980
No, please, I'm...

490
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,420
Just leave me alone, please.

491
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,530
Hey...

492
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:17,320
Tell me what that holy man
did to you in the car.

493
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,930
Margaret,
please leave me alone now.

494
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,190
Did he make you feel good?

495
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,930
- No. Please.
- Come on. Show me.

496
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,870
- No, please. I don't want to.
- Show me what he did.

497
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,200
Please, can you
leave me alone now?

498
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,330
- Did he make you feel good?
- Please, no, leave me alone.

499
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,130
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, he did.

500
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,730
No! No!

501
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,640
- Margaret, no!
- Shh!

502
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,950
Please get rid of her.
She's ruining everything.

503
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,750
Stop freaking out.
She's just crying, all right?

504
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,410
All right, all right.
I'll go, I'll go.

505
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,660
Whoo!

506
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,240
Uh...

507
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:09,140
Everything's really blurry.

508
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,850
Time's blurry.
My vision's blurry.

509
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,800
Alexis, you want to play unicorns?!

510
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,810
I'll play unicorns with you!

511
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,000
Elizabeth!

512
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:43,610
The sun turned black
from the face of the Lord,

513
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,050
and it turned black!

514
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,850
It turned black, the sun.

515
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,010
How can the sun turn black?!

516
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,690
The sun!

517
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,190
Yes, Mom!

518
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,700
I never do anything right.

519
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,390
I thought that you liked that.

520
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:05,440
♪ Can anybody hear me? ♪

521
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:10,500
Alexis, want to come play now,
you stupid ass?!

522
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,170
Come play in here!

523
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:24,350
You really enjoy
this circus act, don't you?

524
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,720
Why don't you just die?

525
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,790
I asked you not to go
into Alexis' room.

526
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,060
And I watched as the sixth seal,

527
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,500
and there was
a great, big earthquake,

528
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,570
and the sun turned to black,

529
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,500
like sackcloth made of goat hair.

530
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,470
Is that Revelation?

531
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,080
Did I ever tell you how my mom
used to put me in the closet

532
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:54,450
with the Bible every night
and make me memorize verses?

533
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,190
And you want to know
what would happen if I didn't?

534
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,760
Well?

535
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,930
This is what you want,
right, Elizabeth?

536
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:09,970
You want me to tell you
all of my problems...

537
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:16,040
so we don't have to talk about
what happened in your closet.

538
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,640
You know I know.

539
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,580
And that's why you hate me.

540
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,450
I don't hate you.

541
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:38,960
I don't even remember...

542
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,090
I don't even remember
what I was like on medication.

543
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,640
So, I mean, was I even a person?
Maybe I wasn't even real.

544
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,730
I mean, if you... if you don't...
if you're not yourself, right,

545
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,070
I mean, then what...
what's the point?

546
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,940
Like, I mean, what...

547
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,950
If you don't remember, I mean,
you're not really real.

548
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,700
Hey.

549
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Can I come in?

550
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:25,500
Do you want a cigarette?

551
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:26,870
I don't smoke.

552
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,000
Well, you might as well.

553
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,850
There's nothing else
to do around here.

554
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,250
You know, I can get you
whatever you want.

555
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:46,700
What do you think I want?

556
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,800
Money...

557
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,030
Sex...

558
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,430
Fun...

559
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,300
You want to get high?

560
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:00,540
Are you insane?

561
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,510
You know Mike, Mr. Nurse man?

562
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,480
See, I blow him...

563
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:11,520
And he gives me whatever I want.

564
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:16,530
Trust me.

565
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:24,730
I'm on your side.

566
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,500
What?

567
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,270
I said...

568
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,140
I'm the one that's on your side.

569
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,580
The others don't give a shit
about you.

570
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,890
The others?

571
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:43,190
They're the ones that aren't real.

572
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:49,460
I...

573
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,590
How do I know you're real?

574
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,800
I'm here, aren't I?

575
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,920
Everything okay?

576
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,890
It's finished if you want to buy it.

577
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,130
Amazing, isn't it?

578
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:10,430
When you start to see yourself
in everything?

579
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,400
Huh?

580
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,800
I said are you sure you're okay?

581
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,430
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

582
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,340
It'll come around for you soon,
Madison.

583
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,150
Madison.

584
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,960
Madison.

585
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,830
Hello?

586
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,310
Hello?!

587
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,200
Let me go!

588
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,370
Please stop.

589
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,010
Please.

590
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,480
Make it stop!

591
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:39,280
Please make it stop!

592
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,780
It's for your own good.

593
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:45,150
But, Mama,
I didn't do anything wrong.

594
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,190
You're talking to people
who aren't there.

595
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,590
It's the work of Satan.

596
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,290
But no one's there, Mama.

597
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,560
Come put your hands over the sink.

598
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:53,720
No, Mama.

599
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,590
Come put your hands
over the sink.

600
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,240
Please, Mama.

601
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,890
Put your hands over the sink!

602
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,790
What happened?

603
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,360
It hurts.

604
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,450
What hurts?

605
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,920
- Please, it really burns.
- What?

606
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,220
It hurts. The water... it's so hot.

607
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,560
There's no water.

608
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,330
- There is. Please make it stop.
- No, there's no water.

609
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:29,490
- Please make it stop.
- What's wrong?

610
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,730
I have to burn.
I have to burn because I'm bad.

611
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,670
- Who said that?
- I have to burn.

612
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,330
- Who said that?
- I'm going to hell.

613
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,530
You're not going to hell.

614
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,740
- I am.
- No, you're not. No.

615
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,470
I am. I'm going to hell.

616
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,050
No, you're not going to hell.

617
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,670
- I am.
- No.

618
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,910
Good people do not go to hell.

619
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,550
Do you know what I do
when I have scary thoughts?

620
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:49,810
What?

621
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,020
I close my eyes...

622
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,720
and I think of the happiest place
I know.

623
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:00,860
But... but I don't have
any happy places.

624
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,500
Everything's crashing on me...

625
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:10,270
Like waves. It's like tidal waves.

626
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:14,680
I feel like I'm drowning.

627
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,960
Our Father...

628
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,390
Who art in heaven...

629
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,760
Hallowed be Thy name.

630
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:37,200
Thy kingdom come...

631
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,860
Madison, Madison,
come and play with me.

632
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:41,060
I can't.

633
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:43,840
See, you're talking again
to imaginary people.

634
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,710
But, Mama, she's right there.

635
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,710
Madison, come on.

636
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,040
Let's play.

637
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,970
Will you tell me more
about the little girl?

638
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:14,060
No.

639
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,040
Why don't you want
to talk about her?

640
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,010
I just... I just...

641
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,980
I, uh... can... can we talk
about something else?

642
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:29,050
What is it about her that makes you
feel so uncomfortable?

643
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,290
I'm not supposed to talk
about the little girl.

644
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:38,450
Why? Why aren't you supposed
to talk about the little girl?

645
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:45,230
'Cause she'll get mad at me.

646
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,370
Who?
Who's gonna get mad at you?

647
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,040
Please don't make me talk about it.

648
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,940
Madison.

649
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,940
Madison.

650
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:04,420
Madison.

651
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:08,890
My name isn't Madison,
you fucking bitch.

652
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:14,630
You push too hard
with your stupid little questions.

653
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:23,300
You're trying to break her.
I can feel it.

654
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,100
I'm trying to help you.

655
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,640
You're trying to help me?

656
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:30,010
I don't need help.
You need help.

657
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,780
Aah!

658
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:38,620
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no.

659
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:40,990
What's wrong?
What's going on?

660
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,750
- Stop it.
- What?

661
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,760
I can't talk to you.

662
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,660
Why?

663
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,670
Because she's gonna get mad at me.

664
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,260
Who's gonna get mad at you?

665
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,840
She's gonna hurt me if I tell.

666
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,370
Nobody's gonna get mad at you.

667
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,130
Madison, it's all right.

668
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,780
What are you doing?

669
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,310
What just happened?

670
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:07,620
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

671
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,080
- No, I'm not gonna be okay.
- Yes, you are.

672
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:11,420
This is not okay,
because you're making me worse,

673
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,150
- And I really don't want to...
- You're gonna be okay.

674
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,850
It's not okay.
You're making me worse.

675
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,820
I know this is really hard.

676
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,260
You know what's fucking hard?
You know what's hard, Beth?

677
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,460
Is that I don't know
what you're talking about.

678
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,230
That's good. That's good.
You're getting angry.

679
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,360
That's really good.

680
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,970
When is the last time
you remember getting angry?

681
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,040
You never needed
to get angry before

682
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,610
because there was somebody else

683
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,310
who was always
getting angry for you.

684
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,970
- What are you saying?
- Somebody was protecting you.

685
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,110
- God, I knew this would happen.
- What would happen?

686
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,390
That I would trust you,
and you would screw me over.

687
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,250
Madison, look at me.
No, I can help you.

688
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,790
Don't say my name.
Don't say my name.

689
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,330
Look at me! Madison!

690
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:55,730
Are you deaf, you bitch?!
I said, "Don't say my name. "

691
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,540
Why can't you just
leave it alone, Beth?

692
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,340
What? Do you think I'm deaf?

693
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,740
You think I don't hear
what you say about me?

694
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,000
I'm trying to help you.

695
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:08,940
Shut up.

696
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:11,740
You called me,
and I came here to help you.

697
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,550
I didn't call you.

698
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,020
I...

699
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,680
I hate you.

700
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,690
She called you.

701
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:25,250
She's gonna die.
She is gonna die.

702
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:27,760
You're gonna die.

703
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,200
Stop.

704
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,740
She isn't real.
She isn't real.

705
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,570
I'm real.

706
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:37,570
She isn't real.

707
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,700
Real.

708
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,780
It's okay.

709
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:46,050
Just fucking stop.

710
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,880
Madison, let me be there for you.

711
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:51,420
Just let me be here.

712
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,260
Come here.

713
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,800
It's okay.

714
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,000
It's okay.

715
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:11,010
It's okay. It's okay.

716
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,800
It's okay.

717
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,280
It's okay.

718
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,340
- It's okay.
- I don't...

719
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:23,680
It's okay.

720
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,350
"What is real?",
asked the rabbit.

721
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:31,120
"Real isn't how you're made,"
said the skin horse.

722
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,820
"It's a thing that happens to you. "

723
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:37,730
- My turn?
- Go ahead.

724
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,830
"Does it hurt?"

725
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,730
"Sometimes.

726
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,710
When you are real,
you don't mind being hurt. "

727
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,440
"Does it happen all at once?"

728
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,780
"It doesn't happen all at once.

729
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,650
You become.
It takes a long time.

730
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,910
That's why it doesn't often happen
to people who break easily,

731
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:58,110
or who have sharp edges,

732
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,060
or who have to be carefully kept.

733
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,250
Generally...

734
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,290
By the time you are real,

735
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,660
most of your hair
has been loved off,

736
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:10,700
and your eyes drop out,

737
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,600
and you get loose in the joints
and very shabby.

738
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:17,330
But these things don't matter at all,

739
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,410
because once you are real,
you can't be ugly,

740
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:23,950
except to people
who don't understand. "

741
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,480
- Mama?
- Yes, Maddie?

742
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,520
Am I real?

743
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,920
I get a lot of requests
from people wanting to do...

744
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:05,110
Checkmate.

745
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,620
So I thought today...

746
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,850
Hey, Madison.

747
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,120
Madison?

748
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:12,920
Madison, what's wrong?

749
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,400
What do you want, Alexis?

750
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,930
You want to come play with me?

751
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,060
Nope.

752
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:19,190
Why? What's wrong?

753
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,970
Nothing's wrong.

754
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:25,200
You always say nothing's wrong
when something is always wrong.

755
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,970
Why don't you come play with me?
Come on.

756
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:27,940
Just one game.

757
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:29,540
- Do you see those people right there?
- Yeah.

758
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,020
They look like
they're having a lot of fun.

759
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,210
I think you should go play with them.

760
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:34,980
No, I want to play with you.

761
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:35,820
Checkmate!

762
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,450
Okay, okay.
Well, um, uh, we can play...

763
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,520
Yeah?

764
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,720
- Hide and go seek.
- Okay.

765
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:41,990
All right, so you're gonna go hide.

766
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:44,690
No, we did that the other day,
and you didn't come and find me.

767
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,350
Madison, you didn't come.

768
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:48,460
I've got a better idea.
Why don't we go play horses?

769
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:51,900
Come on. We can ride horses,
like we always used to ride horses.

770
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,060
- We can ride horses.
- No, there's no horses here.

771
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:56,000
What are you talking about?
We used to always ride horses.

772
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:57,580
Yeah, well, we're
in a hospital right now,

773
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,010
and I've never been on a horse
in my entire life.

774
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:01,040
Do you not remember?

775
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,240
Do you not remember
all those times we played horses?

776
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,910
- Please stop.
- Why are you being so weird?

777
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,980
- Please stop. Please stop.
- Come on, one game, Madison.

778
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,950
Why are you being so weird?
You don't remember anything?

779
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,750
What do you mean you don't
remember?! You do remember!

780
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,150
We used to always
play horses together!

781
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,660
- Please stop.
- You do remember!

782
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,780
- Stop it.
- You do! You do!

783
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:16,020
Shut the fuck up,

784
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,750
or I'm gonna smash your head
against that wall, okay?!

785
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,900
- You say the F-word all the time.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck!

786
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,430
Stop saying the F-word
the whole time!

787
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,260
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

788
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:26,130
Go back to your couch!

789
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,170
Do... do I see a little bit
of personality in you?

790
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,040
Oh, yeah?
A little personality right there?

791
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,270
Yeah, yeah. Fine.

792
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,000
Come on, tough girl.
Come on, tough girl!

793
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,940
- Shut the fuck up!
- Oh, yeah.

794
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:37,840
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

795
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:38,740
Fuck you!

796
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,310
Good job.

797
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,690
Bitches.

798
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,620
Madison, you did it.

799
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:51,090
You did it.

800
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,490
Don't tell Margaret.

801
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:01,110
Madison!

802
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,800
Madison, where are you?!

803
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:58,590
Madison!

804
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,460
You want to spend
your days in eternal hell?

805
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:07,000
Make it stop!

806
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,200
Make it stop!

807
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,940
Well, I was sitting
in the front in his station wagon,

808
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:19,380
and he had, like, um,
these red plastic seat covers.

809
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,320
And it made a noise when he moved.

810
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:27,050
Um, and there was a plastic
Jesus figurine on the dashboard.

811
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:30,390
I know what you want me to say.

812
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,490
What is it that you
think I want you to say?

813
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:39,990
That they took advantage of me
because I was only 13.

814
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:49,680
I would rather slit my wrist...

815
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:54,480
or be fucking hung upside down
and beaten to a pulp

816
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,880
than have to talk to you.

817
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:59,250
Madison.

818
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,260
You are Grace...

819
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:04,690
and you are Margaret...

820
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,920
and you are Alexis.

821
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,590
They're all you.

822
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,910
No, because I didn't...

823
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:17,910
I didn't say these things.

824
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,940
Um...

825
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,740
And I know that they're real,

826
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,510
because I've...
I've talked to them and...

827
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:26,020
and I've talked to you about them.

828
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:32,110
And... you've talked to them...

829
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,690
Right?

830
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:37,850
I've only talked to you.

831
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,040
I've only talked to you.

832
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,200
I don't know what's going on.

833
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:03,010
Where are you going?

834
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,820
Can you take me with you?

835
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,620
Nope.

836
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:08,560
Why?

837
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,850
Because you...

838
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:13,160
Are gonna stay here.

839
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,130
But I want to be with you.

840
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:18,500
Well, you know, that's too bad,
because you're not coming.

841
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,900
But I want to stay with you.

842
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,440
Alexis, don't cry.

843
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,840
Please, please don't cry.

844
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:24,500
But... but why can't I come?

845
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,340
Why?

846
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,910
- Because I said so.
- But why?

847
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:28,440
Shh!

848
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:29,640
Why?

849
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:32,220
Because you're not real.

850
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:27,920
If you're watching this right now...

851
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:31,220
it's because you've forgotten

852
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:34,090
why you've locked yourself
in your apartment.

853
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:38,300
You've given yourself 30 days

854
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:42,600
to figure out
why you're so messed up.

855
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,940
Your phone's been turned off.

856
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:51,780
You don't have shit.

857
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,880
You don't have friends.
You don't have a job.

858
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:00,110
This is your last chance.

859
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:03,520
'Cause I swear to God,

860
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:08,400
if things don't change
in these next 30 days...

861
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:12,230
I will kill myself.

862
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:23,810
Hello?

863
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,940
Dr. Barnes?

864
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:27,280
Yes?

865
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:30,550
Madison is gonna die tonight.

866
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,560
Who is this?

867
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,630
Her friend.

868
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,490
Where's Madison?

869
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,560
Mama?!

870
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:26,300
Mama?!

871
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,240
Mama!

872
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:25,760
Are you Mr. Walker?

873
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,120
Yeah.

874
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,960
I'm a friend of Madison's.

875
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:35,500
Please come inside.

876
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,390
She ain't no doctor.

877
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,550
Can't you see she's got
the devil all over her?

878
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:56,220
She's got him coming out
of her mouth, Steven.

879
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,120
Look at how she's looking at me.

880
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:02,700
The Lord gives me His eyes,

881
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:05,060
and I see through
your wicked games.

882
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,100
Dolly...

883
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,800
Dolly, go on to your room.
Let me talk to her.

884
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:10,800
I'll take care of it.

885
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,970
I pray for your soul.

886
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:18,140
I'm sorry about that.

887
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,940
Some days are worse than others.

888
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:23,150
Are you sure you don't want
anything to eat?

889
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,910
I'm not hungry.

890
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,920
Well, why don't you have a seat?

891
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,190
Now...

892
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:32,690
What was it that you were saying
about Madison?

893
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,530
Madison checked herself
out of the hospital,

894
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:39,900
and, um, I'm really worried
that she might hurt herself.

895
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,670
Do you know where she is?

896
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,670
No, but, uh, you... you...

897
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:48,400
I think that you should
just stay right here until...

898
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:50,340
Until she comes around.

899
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:02,850
Do you mind if I ask you
a-a few questions?

900
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:05,520
Please, yes, do.

901
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:10,670
Did you know what was going on...

902
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:13,600
between Madison and her mother

903
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,470
when Madison was young?

904
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,240
Well, now...

905
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,640
I don't know what you, uh...

906
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,980
I don't know what you mean...
what you mean.

907
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,140
Did you travel a lot
when she was young?

908
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:31,150
Yeah, I did, I did.

909
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,850
Quite a bit.

910
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,190
And you weren't curious...

911
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:40,290
about all the trips to the hospital...

912
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,420
while you were gone?

913
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,400
Um...

914
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:49,600
Hospital... hospital trips.

915
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:50,830
That's, um...

916
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,000
Well, if you're gonna pretend
that you don't know what happened,

917
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:56,410
then it's not gonna help her.

918
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:00,880
And I think that you should... tell her.

919
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,150
What should I say?

920
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,690
That you're sorry.

921
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,860
Can we read that part again?

922
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,050
Which part?

923
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,680
The part about being real.

924
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,630
"What is real?", asked the rabbit.

925
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:50,990
"Real isn't how you're made,"
said the skin horse.

926
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,700
"It's a thing that happens to you. "

927
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:56,400
- My turn?
- Go ahead.

928
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:57,670
"Does it hurt?"

929
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,140
"Sometimes.

930
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,040
When you are real,
you don't mind being hurt. "

931
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,350
I love my daughter.

932
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,490
I love her very much.

933
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:25,560
I know.

934
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:37,780
It's not worth playing
into her games like that.

935
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,280
What about it?

936
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:41,370
I have enabled her.

937
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:45,650
We know better.
We know better, Steven.

938
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,920
I just... it's just...
it's so hard for me, okay?

939
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:50,460
This is a dangerous situation, Steven.

940
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,760
I can't talk about it
anymore, darling.

941
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,870
I just can't talk about it anymore.

942
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:12,970
I-I know how difficult
this has been for all of us.

943
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:18,450
And your daughter is... is...

944
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:22,090
is, uh...

945
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,490
is...

946
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:28,260
Sweetheart, sweetheart...

947
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:31,630
You...

948
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:33,360
are...

949
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:35,460
our daughter.

950
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:38,710
I'm...

951
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:39,900
You understand?

952
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:41,840
- No.
- You understand?

953
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,310
You are.

954
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:45,640
You are.

955
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,350
Oh.

956
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:17,980
It's a little hard
for us to understand...

957
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,740
but...

958
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,480
Maddie, we'd like to help you
if we can.

959
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:30,450
Madison?

960
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,430
Yeah?

961
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:35,090
Hey. Hey.

962
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:39,430
Hey.

963
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,320
You should have told me.

964
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,190
I should have told you what?

965
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,700
That you weren't real.

966
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:14,570
I'm as real as you are.

967
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:19,070
And the others?

968
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,670
They real?

969
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:22,770
I don't care about the others.

970
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:25,110
I've only cared about you.

971
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:37,120
So, what happens now?

972
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,020
We say good-bye.

973
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,590
No. No good-byes, no good-byes.

974
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:49,430
Yeah.

975
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,640
It's time.

976
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,950
You're gonna be okay on your own.

977
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,130
You will.

978
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:12,220
