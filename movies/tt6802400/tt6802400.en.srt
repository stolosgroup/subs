2
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,464
Good morning, Mother and Father.

3
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,675
Good morning, Tinashe.

4
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,426
Good morning, Mother and Father.

5
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,262
Good morning, Omma.

6
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,181
Good morning, Mother and Father,
and happy anniversary.

7
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,475
Yes, Meeka.

8
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,144
It is our anniversary.

9
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,190
Today, we celebrate

10
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,777
30 years of Zamundan prosperity,

11
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:35,531
30 years of service
to our great nation

12
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:39,535
and 30 years
of delicious fast food.

13
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:43,122
We want to welcome
you all to McDowell's Zamunda.

14
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,044
The McDowell's menu is in no way

15
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,505
influenced by
the McDonald's menu.

16
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,424
They've got Egg McMuffins.

17
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,301
We've got Egg McStuffins.

18
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,969
We are also celebrating

19
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:02,391
the arrival of our new
Beyond Big Mick Burger!

20
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,312
And it's all part of my lovely
granddaughter's campaign

21
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,522
to reduce our, uh... our what?

22
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,149
Carbon footprint.

23
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,360
And without using
any animal by-products.

24
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:16,238
It's just
good old-fashioned grass.

25
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,451
- So there's no meat?
- There's no meat.

26
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,747
Beautiful, leafy taste.

27
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,916
So delicious.

28
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,043
Maybe it would taste
much better with a...

29
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,795
Pepsi.

30
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,799
Pepsi, the official soft drink
of McDowell's Zamunda.

31
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,079
You look tired, Father.

32
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,623
Maybe he needs a nap.

33
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,045
I am the heir
to the throne of Zamunda.

34
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,339
I shall not be shamed
by my two daughters.

35
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,590
Three daughters!

36
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,444
Yeah!

37
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:40,531
Behold! Prince Akeem
in his natural element,

38
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,826
cowering at the mercy
of the women in his life.

39
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,929
Semmi, perhaps you would like
to spar with my daughters

40
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,538
and teach them
some combinations.

41
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,999
No doubt, you are

42
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,500
their best teacher,
Your Majesty.

43
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,876
It is my daughters that teach me

44
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,270
in the languages
of the modern world.

45
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,921
For instance,

46
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,631
are my princely robes
not on fleek?

47
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,259
Oh, my God, Father.
To be on fleek is no more.

48
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,885
Really?

49
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,014
I rather enjoyed being on fleek.

50
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,557
Your father has sent for you.

51
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,892
He has an urgent matter
to discuss with you.

52
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,021
Tell me, Semmi,
this urgent matter...

53
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,648
does it concern
my marriage to a suitor

54
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:17,151
who shall one day sit
on the throne of Zamunda?

55
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,028
I will talk to Father alone.

56
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,452
And how is my father today?

57
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,079
He has already ordered
my execution three times.

58
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,415
Oh, then he must be
feeling better.

59
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,666
Prince Akeem!

60
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,418
Nexdorian soldiers.

61
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,462
I could not stop.
They are coming.

62
00:05:55,981 --> 00:06:01,528
Presenting the supreme leader
of Nexdoria,

63
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,865
the conqueror of countries
and hearts...

64
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,910
...the wrestler of lions,

65
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,079
the tamer of elephants,

66
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,664
the inspiration for Mufasa...

67
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:21,423
...the most well-endowed man
in Africa,

68
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,051
General...

69
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,386
Izzi.

70
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,485
Prince Akeem.

71
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,487
Whoa, look at you.

72
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:51,036
My condolences this day
for your father, the king.

73
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,914
Many thanks for your
well wishes, General Izzi,

74
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,291
but as you know,
my father still breathes.

75
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,670
Barely, but for how long?

76
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,380
Why have you come here, General?

77
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,841
30 years ago,
you left my sister at the altar.

78
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,300
Oh, here we go.

79
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,385
Now look at she.

80
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,685
Imani, always a pleasure.

81
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:20,482
If you had married her,
our countries would be united,

82
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,735
putting an end to decades
of suffering for all our people.

83
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,362
General, throughout the years,

84
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,990
we have tried to help
Nexdoria many times.

85
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,951
I would like nothing more
than to help your country

86
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,828
relieve its burden of poverty.

87
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,081
Zamunda can only afford so much.

88
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,625
I did not come here for money.

89
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,128
I came here for blood.

90
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,299
But not the murder kind.

91
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,801
No, no, no, family blood.

92
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,220
Marriage blood, yes?

93
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,060
Has your daughter considered
the proposal from my son?

94
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,396
Hey, Prince-o.

95
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,148
My fellow player.

96
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,858
Hey!

97
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,860
Yes.

98
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,946
I do not think that he and Meeka
will ever happen.

99
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,409
Ever.

100
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,667
There is Bopoto, my daughter.

101
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,544
Perhaps your son can be...

102
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,296
Uh, ay...

103
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,465
But you don't have one.

104
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,634
The shame must be unbearable,

105
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,094
as a man, as a king,

106
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,972
without an heir with a nut sack.

107
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:39,144
Thank you for your visit,
General.

108
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,938
Seeing you brings to mind

109
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,190
all of my father's
favorite curses for you.

110
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:48,153
To call you a shit stain
brought him much joy.

111
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:51,031
I advise you
to reconsider my offer.

112
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,618
It is better to be bound
by blood and marriage

113
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,997
than be divided
by blood and war.

114
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,459
Eh?

115
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,505
Hey!

116
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,266
My time has come, my son.

117
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:21,895
You must heed my words
before I'm gone.

118
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,739
Please don't leave us so soon,
Your Highness.

119
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,148
Zamunda needs you.

120
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,025
Oh, shut up, Semmi!

121
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,278
You don't have to suck up
to me anymore.

122
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,821
I'll be dead soon.

123
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,407
Why couldn't it be you, Semmi?

124
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,783
Yes, Your Majesty.

125
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,868
His life is far too worthless.

126
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,913
His death would make me smile.

127
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,206
Baba.

128
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,794
The throne must pass
to a male heir.

129
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,212
Yes, Father.

130
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,672
A male heir.

131
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,383
Once again, I apologize to you

132
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,011
for all of the shame
and disappointment

133
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,555
that my offspring's
genetic makeup has caused you.

134
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:01,768
My son, it appears
your shortcomings in masculinity

135
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,104
have turned out to be unfounded.

136
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,273
I seen it

137
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,150
in a vision.

138
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,528
You gots a son.

139
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,115
It is true.

140
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,702
You have a son, Akeem.

141
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,205
A bastard son.

142
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,291
That is impossible.

143
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,252
The only woman
I have ever lain with is Lisa.

144
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:30,922
Father, I did not sow
my royal oats.

145
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,343
Semmi!

146
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,761
Hmm?

147
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,263
Tell Akeem the truth at once.

148
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:46,146
Remember in Queens,
night after night,

149
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,315
you were looking
for the perfect woman?

150
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,775
Yes.

151
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,153
Well, I too was...
how can I say this?

152
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,908
I was looking
for the perfect vagina.

153
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,953
Or any vagina.

154
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:07,084
We scoured the far reaches
of that loathsome city,

155
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,753
searching rather unsuccessfully
for the woman of your dreams.

156
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,464
♪ My name is Peaches,
and I'm the best ♪

157
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,008
♪ All the DJs want
to feel my breast. ♪

158
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,511
I've been
watching you all evening,

159
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,971
and I want to tear you apart.

160
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,974
And your friend, too.

161
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,354
I am going to mingle.

162
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,689
I had had enough.

163
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,776
And I realized, if I was ever
going to sow my oats

164
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,319
on American soil,

165
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,238
I was going to need
to find someone

166
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,823
to take care of you.

167
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,367
But don't worry,
I never broke our oath

168
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,452
of keeping our identity
a secret.

169
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,121
A prince?

170
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,165
Yes, a prince.

171
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:50,710
But he cannot know
that you know who he is.

172
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:54,214
We are undercover Africans.

173
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,050
Africans undercover.
Oh, that's good, baby.

174
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,886
You ain't got to lie like that
to get some of this ass.

175
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,906
But you know what? I'll bump
uglies with your homeboy.

176
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,516
Just let me go throw up
real quick, and, uh...

177
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,561
and then we can, you know,
get it crackin'.

178
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,231
♪ Let your soul glow... ♪

179
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,859
I may not have been
thinking straight.

180
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,027
In my defense, it had been weeks

181
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,364
since the last time I was
tended to by the royal bathers.

182
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,325
But at the time,
it seemed like a good plan.

183
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,205
Mmm.

184
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,917
I hope you like, uh,
pumpkin pie.

185
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:34,629
'Cause you gonna get
a whole slice.

186
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,426
That is not what happened,
Father.

187
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,179
I remember meeting
this morally bereft woman,

188
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,431
but there was
no inappropriate mating.

189
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,600
She offered me
some of her ceremonial herbs.

190
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,938
Princey.

191
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,773
And then, if memory serves,

192
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,692
a wild boar burst into the room.

193
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,028
It came and jumped into my lap.

194
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,738
And then it began to ram me.

195
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,491
And ram me and ram me, ramming and ramming!

196
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,367
And a foul...

197
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,793
You fool,
what have you done to me?!

198
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,462
Go on, son.

199
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,625
- Just kill him.
- Kill him!

200
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,343
- So I actually have a son?
- A bastard son.

201
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,848
Why was his existence
hidden from me all these years?

202
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:31,353
I was hoping you would put
a stem on an apple of your own.

203
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:36,149
The royal artist made a sketch
of my vision.

204
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,487
This is your bastard.

205
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,531
Hear me, Prince Akeem.

206
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:46,284
General Izzi, he will use
the passing of our great king

207
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,329
as a sign
to attack the weak one.

208
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,873
The weak one?

209
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,708
Am I the weak one?

210
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,461
I spoiled you, my son.

211
00:13:56,545 --> 00:14:01,049
You are not strong
or ruthless as I am.

212
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,426
You will be assassinated.

213
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,389
Within a week.

214
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,140
Month, tops.

215
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,394
Prince Akeem,
follow the thunderbird.

216
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,437
It will take you to your boy.

217
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,897
Follow the thunderbird?

218
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,440
This is madness.

219
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,377
If my family were to ever
find out about this...

220
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,111
You will be safe.

221
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,072
Our people will be safe.

222
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,492
It is the only way. You must.

223
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,667
Easy, my father.

224
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,086
The end is near.

225
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,923
My funeral...

226
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,718
should be spectacular.

227
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,638
Yeah, it will, Papa.

228
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:53,226
Let's have it now
while I'm alive.

229
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,063
It shall be glorious.

230
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,192
In the beginning,

231
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,319
the universe began.

232
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,031
Stars, planets,

233
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,074
all the visible objects
in the universe

234
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:12,746
came to be
with a single purpose:

235
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,791
to prepare the way for
the grandest creation of all,

236
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,753
the birth of Jaffe Joffer.

237
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,801
But today,

238
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:30,096
we gather for a moment or two

239
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,390
to give much respect due

240
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:36,353
to the king who made
a difference in our world.

241
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:40,649
Zamundans, I give you...

00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,140
And I have a child
on the other side of the world.

306

Take heart in your grief.

307

You are king now.

308
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,937
Be as your father.

309

Bark orders at me.

310
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,858
Throw things at me.
It will make you happy.

311
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,031
Prepare the royal jet.

312
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,910
We are going back to America.

313
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,622
Oh, hell no, Your Majesty!

314
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,541
Now, I will find
this bastard of Queens,

315
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,751
and I will look into his eyes,
and if I see

316
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,504
the strength of our ancestors,
I shall know he is of my blood.

317
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,548
Then he must come back
to Zamunda

318
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,216
and take the princely test.

319
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,969
Heir to the throne of Zamunda,

320
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,138
born in America...

321
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,892
...land of opportunity.

322
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,188
What kind of man
do you think he is?

323
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,858
This bastard.

324
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,028
If he has Joffer blood
running through his veins,

325
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,197
I'm sure he's destined
for greatness.

326
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,082
You think you look respectable?

327
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,792
I just want to look employable.

328
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,516
Ain't nobody gonna hire you
over all these

329
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,129
Mitt-Romney-looking-ass
shmiggas.

330
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,882
Why not? I got sales experience.

331
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,967
Which reminds me...
St. John's is at the Garden.

332
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,969
Now, I want you to take
these tickets up there.

333
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,971
Sell 'em at full freight
until tip-off.

334
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,766
I can't do this shit
no more, man. I really can't.

335
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,310
This hand-to-mouth shit,
it's got to stop, all right?

336
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,645
I got to get solid.

337
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,063
I'm in my 30s now.

338
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,689
Since when?

339
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,107
Today!

340
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,693
Today.

341
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,236
Today is my birthday.

342
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,863
And you forgot.

343
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,741
Listen to me, young Jedi, okay?

344
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,618
What you need to do
is learn to relax.

345
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,244
I'm your uncle.

346
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,455
You stay on the ground with me.
You dig it, son?

347
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,665
Uh, L. Junson.

348
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,376
Don't use white voice.

349
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,002
Present.

350
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,672
I do know smartphones.

351
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,507
I know technology, all right?

352
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,259
I'm well-versed
in emerging trends.

353
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,595
And I'll tell you this, too.

354
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,348
If you hire me,
I won't let you down.

355
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,308
That's really inspiring.

356
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,936
So, uh, just give me a chance,
Mr. Duke.

357
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,938
Oh, my God, please.
My father is Mr. Duke.

358
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,857
Uh, and my, uh, grandfather
and great-uncle,

359
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,193
who founded Duke &amp; Duke.

360
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,237
- Uh, please just call me Calvin.
- All right.

361
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,488
I'm calling you Calvin.

362
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,282
I noticed here,
under education, that...

363
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:26,035
did it say that
you-you didn't graduate college?

364
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,759
Well, yeah, see,
I was three credits short

365
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,139
from getting my, uh,
business degree,

366
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,915
but then my mom got laid off,
and, uh,

367
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,626
you know, I had to, uh,
drop out to help with the rent.

368
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,129
- Is she addicted to drugs or...
- What?

369
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,506
- She have gambling issues or...
- No, man.

370
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,842
Pops, uh, in the picture or...

371
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,595
- My dad was not in the picture.
- Ah.

372
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,390
You know, I went
to boarding school,

373
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,058
so there were months
where I didn't see

374
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:52,228
my parents, except for breaks,
and, uh, it can be hard.

375
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,440
I mean, I've read
a lot of studies that say

376
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,900
that not having
a dominant male figure at home,

377
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,028
it's so detrimental to a child.

378
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,613
- Do they say that?
- Yeah, they say that.

379
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:04,490
- Who?
- Scientists.

380
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,951
- Bill Nye did a...
- The Science Guy.

381
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,536
Your guy, uh,
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

382
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,830
Do you think that not having

383
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:15,418
that kind of male role model
could put you at a disadvantage?

384
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,629
No more of a disadvantage
than having a father

385
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,673
who handed you your position.

386
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,175
"Handed"?

387
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,719
I-I was not handed anything.

388
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,971
So you're saying
Daddy never donated a building

389
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,015
to get you into
an Ivy League school?

390
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,641
No. Yeah.

391
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:33,519
Well, there was
a small off-campus library.

392
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:36,064
And Daddy never
had to sneak you into

393
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,024
an overpriced rehab facility

394
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,109
to cover up
a cocaine addiction, Calvin?

395
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,403
It was oxy, and my mom took me.

396
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,782
Kiss my ass, Calvin.

397
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,200
Hey, you know something?

398
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,927
You've been judging me
since I walked in here.

399
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,537
Which sucks because
I am so motivated.

400
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,474
You know what, I-I just
can't wait for them to find

401
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,875
blackface photos of you
from the office party.

402
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,795
I was
Will Smith's Aladdin, okay?

403
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,296
Peace, Calvin.

404
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,298
There was blueface
over the black...

Floyd "Money"
Mayweather ain't shit!

417
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,421
He beat that Filipino boy ass.

418
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,298
"Pack-a-quando," "Pack-a-mondo."

419
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:47,593
Wh-Whatever his name is,
he beat that boy ass, Clarence.

420
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:51,180
And he beat that meshuggener
Conor McGregor, the Irishman.

421
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,558
Yeah, 'cause he had to do that
for the blacks.

422
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,619
In this political climate,
Black man can't be taking

423
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:56,978
no ass-whipping
from no white man.

424
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,104
Would've caused a riot.

425
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,397
I was ready to riot anyway.

426
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,208
I wanted to get me
one of them flat-screen TVs.

427
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,573
Well, I'll be damned!
Look who done come up in here.

428
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,701
Hey, it's Kunta Kinte and Ebola.

429
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,328
- Famine and Blood Diamond.
- Nelson Mandela and Winnie.

430
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,559
Those hungry babies
with the flies on their face.

431
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,223
- Hey. Oh, oh, oh, oh.
- Whoa, whoa.

432
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,770
That's too much, man.
You stepped over the line, now.

433
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,272
We don't be talking that kind
of shit about the hungry babies.

434
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,315
You gonna have to get out my
chair talking that kind of shit.

435
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,674
Politically incorrect.

436
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,467
Somebody need to whip your ass.

437
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,511
Mm-hmm.
Get up and whip him, Sweets.

438
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,364
Hey, don't be putting the money
in my hand all rough.

439
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,866
Take your ass out of here.
You buy you a Flowbee

440
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,433
and cut your own damn hair
from now on.

441
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,977
Right now I could rip
a new ass in that kid.

442
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,103
It is so good to see you.

443
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,105
Your neighborhood
seems to be thriving.

444
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,332
Oh, that's that gentrification.

445
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,941
You know,
when the colored man here,

446
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,335
this neighborhood
didn't have shit.

447
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,986
When the white man move in,

448
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,447
they got their coffeehouses
and their dog parks,

449
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,159
and my brownstone on Foch
Boulevard is worth $10 million.

450
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,828
Your brownstone ain't worth
no ten million.

451
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,598
My brownstone is, too, worth $10 million!

452
00:24:57,622 --> 00:25:00,166
And I'm gonna sell it
and get me a Tesla.

453
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,019
America has certainly changed
since our last visit.

454
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:05,880
Your Black president finally
united this great country.

455
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,590
Yeah, but it's all
gone to hell now.

456
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,218
We all gonna die.
Just don't know how.

457
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,802
It's gonna be the Nazis.

458
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,471
Nazis are back,

459
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,224
but now they dress
like the Best Buy Geek Squad

460
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,351
and they want to kill people.

461
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,896
Anybody could be a Nazi.
You ever notice that, Prince?

462
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,814
Akeem now is an African king.

463
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,098
Well, I'll be damned.

464
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,735
You got any kids? I got kids.

465
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,947
In fact, I got one granddaughter
used to be my grandson.

466
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,407
They can turn your penis
into a vagina now.

467
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,785
It's science.

468
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,328
I bet they could fix

469
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,372
them long, sloppy titties
y'all got in Africa.

470
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,957
You can't even
squeeze a tit nowadays.

471
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,291
It'll get you fired.

472
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,418
I'm so sorry you can
no longer indiscriminately

473
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,545
touch a woman's body
at your every whim.

474
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,006
Oh, it's okay.
I got it in when I was young.

475
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:57,682
So what you doing back here,
Idiot Amin?

476
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,475
I am actually here
with a purpose.

477
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,019
I have just discovered
that I may have a bastard son

478
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,397
here in this land,
conceived during my last visit.

479
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,025
The long arm of the family court
bring 'em back every time.

480
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,653
How much child support
she getting from you?

481
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,280
The king pays no child support.

482
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:15,533
No child support for 30 years,
and you came back?

483
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,618
You's a dummy!

484
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:20,663
My son has been without a father
for far too long.

485
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,416
I've seen him.

486
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,793
That's the kid that's always
out in front of the Garden.

487
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,716
He scalp tickets
down at Madison Square Garden.

488
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,423
He probably over there right now
working the St. John's game.

489
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,008
Their mascot is a big turkey.

490
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,552
Oh, hell no, it ain't.
It's a thunderbird.

491
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,306
"Follow the thunderbird."

492
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,016
Hey! Come on, y'all!

493
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,810
I got five! Got five!

494
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:46,105
Got five tickets to the
Middle Tennessee game tonight!

495
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:49,150
Come on, y'all!
You want it, I got it!

496
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,873
Hey, I got five...
Hey, I got five tickets

497
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,087
to the Middle Tennessee State
game, man.

498
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,446
- No.
- Come on, yo.

499
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,729
What better way to spend
your night than paying to watch

500
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:56,907
unpaid student athletes?

501
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,370
Semmi, look.

502
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,043
It is my potential bastard son.

503
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,462
Akeem.

504
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,088
You are king of Zamunda.

505
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,591
Your noble visage is known
around the world.

506
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:17,928
You cannot stroll down the
street like we did years ago.

507
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,640
Come on, Middle Tennessee State.

508
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,059
Come on, y'all.

509
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,269
They got
a seven-foot-five center.

510
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,563
Catch him before his knees pop.

511
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,942
Hello.

512
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:34,987
You want some tickets, man?

513
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,697
No, thank you.

514
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:42,036
I am King Akeem Joffer,
king of Zamunda.

515
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,121
And I believe that you...

516
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,291
What is your name?

517
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,752
It's Lavelle.

518
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,588
- Lavelle Junson.
- ...Lavelle Junson,

519
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,383
are the heir
to the throne of Zamunda.

520
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:00,679
My firstborn child
and my only son.

521
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:05,226
Yes, my son.

522
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,228
Are you putting
the candles on the cake?

523
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,398
31 candles.
I need 31 candles on that cake.

524
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh, well, there's only ten
in the pack, so...

525
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,527
What do you mean, only ten?
Why is there only ten?

526
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,171
'Cause I did not have
enough change left over

527
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,446
to get another pack of candles.

528
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,031
It's your nephew's birthday.

529
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:20,467
Look, just please try
to make 31 candles.

530
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,451
Cut the candles in half.

531
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,495
That's just 20. It's...

532
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,248
Cuzzo! Happy birthday!

533
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,000
Happy birthday!

534
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,419
Happy birthday, cuz!

535
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,254
Hey, baby, happy birthday!

536
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,636
Oh, my God.

537
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,304
My African.

538
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,181
I told you
he was gonna come back!

539
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,475
Boy, why you ain't tell me
you was bringing company?

540
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,239
- I would've cleaned up.
- Uh-huh.

541
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,771
- So you know this man?
- I definitely know this man.

542
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,398
I know this man
all the way live.

543
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,567
You know, I know this man
all up in the crevice.

544
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,777
Yes, it's, uh,

545
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,863
very good to see you again...

546
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,160
- Mary.
- Mary.

547
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,412
- Like the Virgin.
- Oh. Okay, baby. All right.

548
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,456
- Virgin? Not our Mary.
- She ain't no virgin.

549
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,308
- You know that.
- You know what? That's right.

550
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,768
Y'all was doing
that little weak pickup game.

551
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,878
I think he was
supposed to be, like,

552
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,588
the prince or something.

553
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,214
He is not a prince anymore.

554
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:18,757
He is our king.

555
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,635
- Oh, he's a king now.
- A king?

556
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,679
Oh, okay, King.

557
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,849
So, you still got that smooth...
scepter?

558
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,100
Hey.

559
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,519
No. Nobody want to hear that
on my birthday.

560
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,789
- - Mary. Mary.
- Yo, Mom, for real,

561
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:33,939
is this dude my father?

562
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,317
Father? Boy...

563
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,569
Mm.

564
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:42,114
Oh, boy, yeah, that might...
he might be.

565
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,366
He does... Y'all know
I was a ho, though, right?

566
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,118
Y'all know I was
out in these streets?

567
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,637
- You was a ho.
- I wasn't selling it.

568
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:48,763
I should've been selling it.

569
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,456
In one of them
Fashion Nova dresses.

570
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,350
- 'Cause I was giving it away, for sure.
- Mary.

571
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,918
I've come back for my son.

572
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:57,379
To have him take his
rightful place on the throne.

573
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:58,964
Ain't nothing happening.

574
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:01,234
Zamunda, Wakanda, Connecticut...
I don't know where you from.

575
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,593
- Exactly.
- But I've been a force

576
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,261
in this boy's life
since he was born.

577
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:05,971
Please.

578
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,598
It is the boy's birthright.

579
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,350
I'm only giving him
an opportunity

580
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,935
to have a better life.

581
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,770
No. Hey, man, for real, look.

582
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,396
I don't know
who you think you are,

583
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,023
but I'm-a tell you
who I am, man.

584
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,775
I'm Lavelle Junson, a'ight?

585
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,568
And I don't need no handout.

586
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,155
Hmm? Wait a minute.

587
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,490
- Wait.
- My mistake.

588
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,242
Continue.

589
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,535
Oh, my God.

590
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,121
Do the right thing.
Go ahead, boy.

591
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,709
Ooh.

592
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,213
Are those coins?
Are those gold bars?

593
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,590
There's cash.

594
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,801
Hey, yo, uh,

595
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,844
you know, I'm thinking, who am I

596
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,222
to say no to becoming a prince?

597
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,850
Ma, pack your bags, man. We out.

598
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:55,271
Amen! Okay, so do I get my own
hut with my private shaman?

599
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:59,525
We are only offering to take
Lavelle back to Zamunda.

600
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,169
Uh-uh.
Ain't happening like that, man.

601
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,695
I'm not hopping on some plane,

602
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,072
flying across the world
without my mother.

603
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,157
All right? She coming.

604
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,454
- So be it.
- So be it.

605
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,182
- So be it.
- And so it is. A'ight.

606
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,375
- I'm-a go pack.
- Okay, baby.

607
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,002
Hey, Mary, you just gonna leave?

608
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,045
Y'all know my PlayStation
ain't going nowhere.

609
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,547
I mean, what about
all your stuff?

610
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,049
It all sucks! Y'all can have it.

611
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:28,762
Inform General Izzi that I have
retrieved my son from America.

612
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,973
Yes, Your Majesty.

613
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,017
Hey, we packed.

614
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,810
Ah.

615
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,313
Yes, the limousine is waiting
for you right downstairs.

616
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,276
- Limo? We got a limo, man.
- What's that? Limo!

617
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,233
I ain't been
in a limo since '00.

618
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,169
- Hey. What's up?
- What's up, fellas?

619
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,571
How y'all doing? Y'all so cute.

620
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,324
Do you think Lisa
will be understanding?

621
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,701
What is not to understand?

622
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,994
You lied to me!

623
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,621
I did not exactly lie to you.

624
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:54,830
This reeks of Semmi.

625
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,541
Ah, well, I don't want
to shift blame,

626
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,335
but, yeah, it...
yes, you're right

627
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,754
when you assume that Semmi had
something to do with this.

628
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,339
I should've known about this.

629
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,468
I did not know what to do.

630
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,031
I was only trying to do
what is right.

631
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,930
For our family or for Zamunda?

632
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,059
Okay.

633
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,519
You have an illegitimate son.

634
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,164
You wouldn't be
the first king to have one.

635
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,230
That is true.

636
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:22,107
Besides, we hadn't even met yet.

637
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:24,735
Exactly. We hadn't met yet.
It's not like I cheated on you.

638
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,695
This happened
before we even met.

639
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,965
And it's not like you're the
first man I've ever been with.

640
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,175
Right, I...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

641
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,867
What did you just say
about the other men?

642
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,494
So I guess, uh,

643
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,337
you didn't really do
anything wrong, did you?

644
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:38,040
It was a totally honest mistake
that can happen to anyone

645
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,060
whose best friend introduced him
to a strange woman

646
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,419
who drugged him
and had sex with him.

647
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,046
But what did you say...
the other men

648
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,422
that you were with, the...

649
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,428
From here on out,

650
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,889
I'm gonna need you
to be honest with me.

651
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,642
- No more surprises.
- I promise.

652
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,936
No more surprises, my sweet.

653
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,438
Never again shall there be
another surprise.

654
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:04,400
Ooh, ooh! What?!

655
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,068
Look at this foyer!

656
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,320
I got to get
some shots for the Gram.

657
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:10,447
Goddamn!

658
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:11,925
- Oh, my goodness!
- Hashtag "family"!

659
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,492
That's the last surprise.

660
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,285
- Hey! What's up, y'all?
- Hey!

661
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,246
What's up, fam?

662
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,164
Look, I'm gonna hug you
'cause I'm a hugger.

663
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,708
Hey, Queen!

664
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:23,585
I'm sorry I slept with your man.

665
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,046
It's okay. It's okay.

666
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,716
- What is going on here?
- Oh, children.

667
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,969
Children, I would love for you
to meet your brother.

668
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:35,139
Uh, Lavelle, uh,
Princess Tinashe.

669
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,850
Tinashe, this is your
bastard brother from America.

670
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,268
And, Princess Omma,

671
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,604
this is your
bastard brother from America.

672
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,607
Now, this is my eldest daughter,
Princess Meeka.

673
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,025
Meeka, this is your bast...

674
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,027
Bastard brother. They know.

675
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,989
I think they get the idea.
So, how you doing?

676
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,032
And my name is Mary.
How you doing?

677
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,993
Just call me your second mom.

678
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,579
But you really
don't have to, girls.

679
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,582
I mean, but you should, though,
'cause I kind of am.

680
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,041
Well, look at us.

681
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,502
Just one big, happy

682
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:08,255
Zamundan-American
aristocratic blended family.

683
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,675
Ah, just like the Kardashians!

684
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:31,904
And that is the story
of the bunny and the bear.

685
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,947
Good class today, children.

686
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,616
Okay, go play now.

687
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,576
Play with your grenades
and your Kalashnikov.

688
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,620
Sifo, don't mess with the sarin.

689
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,371
Okay? It is dangerous.

690
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:44,625
General Izzi,
we have just been informed

691
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:49,588
King Akeem has returned
from America with a son.

692
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,590
A son?

693
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,761
A son.

694
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,110
I am so hungry,

695
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,112
I could eat the ass
out of a zebra.

696
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:21,036
So, Lavelle,
what did you do in Queens

697
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,497
before you found out
you were a prince?

698
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,874
Oh, I wasn't doing that much,
you know what I mean?

699
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,710
Just sort of, like,
in between opportunities.

700
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,647
- You know?
- Let me tell you something, baby.

701
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:33,006
- Hmm?
- You a prince now. Okay?

702
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,926
And one day,
all this is gonna be yours.

703
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,845
This long-ass table,
all this food,

704
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,097
this whole damn kingdom.

705
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,308
I always thought that Meeka
was going to be queen.

706
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,227
A woman isn't
allowed to rule Zamunda.

707
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,311
It's the law.

708
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:49,606
So it's going to be this guy?

709
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:55,529
I have lost my appetite.

710
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:56,822
Mm.

711
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,327
Mm.

712
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:05,122
So, um, is anybody gonna tell me

713
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,499
why these mashed potatoes
is black?

714
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,042
It's caviar.

715
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,336
- It's cava-what?
- Caviar, Mom.

716
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,422
You know, our cousin named that.

717
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,138
You sure you're
in the right room?

718
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:24,600
Mm, Lisa, please.
I'm getting it from everywhere.

719
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,602
Meeka is so upset.

720
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:32,774
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe

721
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,152
Meeka might have wanted
to be your heir?

722
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:38,447
She's practically trained for it
her whole life.

723
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,409
This boy would not have been
my first choice,

724
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,870
but what can I do?

725
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,123
He is my firstborn, my only son,

726
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,125
and you know the law.

727
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,835
That is not you talking.

728
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:54,588
That is your father.

729
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,298
Good night.

730
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,641
Uh, Lisa, I was, uh, wondering,

731
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,893
uh, I just recently returned
from a trip

732
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:11,480
that was most tiresome,
and I thought maybe, perhaps,

733
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,066
if you were in the mood...

734
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,443
Yeah, perhaps it was
poor timing on my behalf

735
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,987
to even suggest such a thing.

736
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,448
Good night, my sweet.

737
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,034
Uh, s-sweet dreams, my sweet.

738
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,584
This is bullshit.

739
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,552
Mm.

740
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:44,262

00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,783
Okay, baby, first of all,
calm down.

769
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,577
Okay?
You know we in another country.

Good morning,
Your Royal Highness.

789
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,705
My name is Mirembe.

790
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,832
I will be your royal groomer.

791
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,959
Please allow me the honor

792
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,587
of trimming
your most precious hairs.

793
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,839
Um...

794
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:45,592
The ones atop your head, sir.

795
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,844
- Precious head of hair. Okay. All right.
- Yes.

796
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:50,847
Surely, the royal bathers
have cleansed you thoroughly,

797
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:53,558
judging by the smile
on your face.

798
00:39:56,812 --> 00:40:00,023
Now, please sit back and relax.

799
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:13,078
Oh!

800
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,080
Yo! Man, look at you.

801
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,998
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

802
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,334
- And you look so fre...
- Right? Right?

803
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,836
- Right?
- What's this? What's this?

804
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,171
Oh, yeah, I got a royal barber,
and she hooked me up.

805
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:27,759
- We got to go.
- Right. Got that thing.

806
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:44,442
Presenting Lavelle Junson
of Queens!

807
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,237
And my moms.

808
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,532
And his moms.

809
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,662
Oh, hey, baby's daddy king.

810
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,581
Step-mama queen, what up?

811
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:00,250
Mother, don't you have
a dress like that?

812
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,002
Thank you for the borrow.

813
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,211
The royal tailors had to add

814
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:04,671
some extra material
to make it fit.

815
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,506
You got a dope closet, baby.

816
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,508
And who told you
you could go through my closet?

817
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:11,303
Well, well, I was just thinking,
since we're related,

818
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:15,015
uh, maybe that we could share
a couple of...

819
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,683
Why your mama so uppity?

820
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,560
What is "uppity"?

821
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,103
I am not uppity.

822
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:21,897
Uppity bitch say what?

823
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,523
What?

824
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:24,900
You said it.

825
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,904
We do that in Queens.

826
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,323
I cannot stress how important
it is that you're here

827
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,908
right now at this moment.

828
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,492
For educational purposes.

829
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,286
At any moment,
a world leader can come

830
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,914
bursting through the door
with some pressing,

831
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:42,375
uh, time-sensitive propositions.

832
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:04,731
General Izzi, what a totally
unexpected surprise.

833
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:08,610
King Akeem, I have come
to give you congratulations

834
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,238
for locating
one of your lost sperm.

835
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:14,699
I too wonder about
my own stray bullets.

836
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:16,993
Thank you for your kind words.

837
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:20,205
Ah, but I've not come
with just words.

838
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:25,043
I came with a gift
for your new prince.

839
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:34,010
With your permission,
King Akeem.

840
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:35,845
My permission is granted.

841
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,662
I would like to

842
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:04,457

my daughter, Bopoto!

What's up?

880
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:59,114
King Akeem, shall we join
our families in marriage

881
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,907
under one flag

882
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,453
by uniting your bastard
with my Bopoto?

883
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,667
General...

884
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,169
as you know, I have
very, very strong opinions

885
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:15,463
when it comes
to arranged marriages.

886
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:19,467
True love is the bedrock
of my kingdom.

887
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:26,474
But if this is something
that Lavelle desires,

888
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:28,226
who am I to stand in his way?

889
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:29,602
- Wait, what?
- Father.

890
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,523
Lavelle, is this what you want?

891
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,067
Yeah. I'm 'bout it.

892
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:37,735
Then it is settled!

893
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,404
Then let us proceed!

894
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:42,323
A semiautomatic shotgun wedding
it will be!

895
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:53,334
Remember your father's
final words.

896
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:56,754
The boy must pass
the princely test.

897
00:45:56,838 --> 00:46:00,800
To forget the princely test
would be to spit in the faces

898
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:04,137
of the great Joffers
who have come before you.

899
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:06,764
Whose auntie is this?

900
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,767
I give you a week.

901
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:14,564
I wouldn't want to go back
to plotting your death.

902
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:17,233
Zoot!

903
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:18,544
- Zoot!
- What's "zoot"?

904
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:20,069
Y'all leaving?
Does that mean "leave"?

905
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,370
I'll see you in one week,
my prince.

906
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:31,080
A'ight.

907
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:36,336
- Father, can we talk about this?
- There is nothing to talk about.

908
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,838
Nexdoria is our greatest threat.

909
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:41,758
To broker a peace hinging on
the testosterone-clouded whims

910
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,469
of a son you barely even know
is foolish.

911
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:46,513
I said there is
nothing to talk about.

912
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,148
This is ZNN.

913
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,775
Good evening, my neighbors.

914
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,735
I'm Totatsi Bibinyana.

915
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,029
In a most promising twist,

916
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,865
the Zamunda News Network
has confirmed

917
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:08,785
that King Akeem has a son.

918
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,411
While it is too early
to determine

919
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:12,664
whether the boy possesses
any strength, intelligence

920
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,415
or capability whatsoever,

921
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:17,210
what we do know
is that he is a man.

922
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,963
And as far as Zamundan royalty
is concerned,

923
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:21,548
that's good enough.

924
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:24,652
The princely test
has three parts.

925
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:26,135
- Okay. Uh-huh.
- Culture,

926
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,722
critical thinking and,
more importantly, courage.

927
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,266
Where do we begin?

928
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:35,603
Teach the young prince
how to walk like royalty.

929
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,313
That is what we will do.

930
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:40,024
We will teach you
how to walk like a prince.

931
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:41,859
Yo, what's wrong
with the way I walk now?

932
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:43,695
You walk like an American pimp.

933
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,863
You dress like
a slave from the future.

934
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:47,532
Old Jar Jar Binks lookin' ass.

935
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:49,742
Here, in this hall,

936
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:54,163
you will come face-to-face
with your Zamundan heritage.

937
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:56,207
Let us begin.

938
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,418
Jompu Joffer.

939
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,794
Jampu...

940
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,297
- Jakoof Joffer.
- Jujkoof...

941
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,340
Mighty Jokeim Joffer,

942
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:06,509
the most handsome
of all the Joffers.

943
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:09,721
Clench your backside.

944
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,181
- Put your shoulders back.
- Mm-hmm.

945
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:13,391
- Put your chin up.
- Mm-hmm.

946
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:16,060
Suck in your stomach
and walk thusly.

947
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,896
Now? Walk? Okay.

948
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,609
- This is a regal gait.
- Okay.

949
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,653
Stop! Don't...

950
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:27,447
Tuck in your backside.

951
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,115
And who is this?

952
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:30,366
Uh, that's Jappa Joffer.

953
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,243
- No.
- Jabba the Hutt Joffer.

954
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:34,579
- No.
- Jumpin' Jack Flash Joffer.

955
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:35,705
No.

956
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,349
- Gerald Levert Joffer?
- No.

957
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:39,125
- Jimmie "JJ" Walker Joffer?
- No.

958
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,085
- Jabberwocky Joffer.
- No.

959
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:42,229
James Brown Joffer.

960
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,379
Hey!

961
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:53,056
All right, y'all,
what am I doing out here?

962
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,474
I'm hungry. I'm...

963
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,226
I-I'm late for my bath.
What am I looking for?

964
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,978
Hmm?

965
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:01,272
Oh! That's a damn lion, bruh!

966
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:04,692
Only when you can retrieve
the whiskers from a resting lion

967
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:06,527
will you be ready
to become prince.

968
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,450
This is a joke.

969
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,243
This is a joke, 'cause I know

970
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,167
your soft ass ain't never
do nothing like that.

971
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,872
Oh, yes, I did.

972
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,833
- On my very first attempt.
- Well...

973
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:23,836
Yes. First attempt. Very brave.

974
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,106
You will need the courage
of all your ancestors...

975
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,174
A machete? A rocket launcher?
What you got?

976
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,635
...and the cunningness
of your Western ways.

977
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,096
And these.

978
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,729
Thank you.

979
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,282
Ain't this a bitch.

980
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:57,203
I just don't belong here.

981
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,831
You are the son
of the king of Zamunda.

982
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,584
You come from a long line
of Joffers, and...

983
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:06,671
I come from a long line
of broke-ass nobodies.

984
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:11,300
What the hell I was thinking
that I could have this?

985
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,386
Or any of it?

986
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,014
Hey, for real, just...
cut this off, all right?

987
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:18,725
Just cut it off.

988
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:23,146
You want to get rid of
the royal princely braid?

989
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:26,858
Well, this is fair.

990
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:30,361
To be honest, it wasn't
a great look on you.

991
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,782
Just one of the many
backward Zamundan traditions.

992
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:38,077
Hell yeah.

993
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:40,705
How long have you felt that way?
You know how itchy this is?

994
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,749
It's a rat tail.

995
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:45,293
And what's up
with y'all and lion whiskers?

996
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,128
Like, be for real...
what's up with that?

997
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:51,674
Hey, yo, I-I can't do this
right now, man.

998
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,471
Yo, look where I'm at.

999
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:00,224
I'm not supposed to be here.

1000
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,102
You know, my whole life,
I had dreams

1001
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:05,021
that my pops
would show up and take

1002
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,231
me and my mom away
to a whole new life.

1003
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:09,233
And come to find out,
he's a king.

1004
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,027
To a whole damn country.

1005
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,154
And the only way
to meet his expectations

1006
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:16,866
is to walk with a stick
up my ass or get myself killed.

1007
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,953
This-this ain't my way, Mirembe.

1008
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:24,624
And I-I-I can't... I can't be
what he wants me to be.

1009
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:30,087
Then perhaps
be not as King Akeem

1010
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:32,423
but as Prince Akeem.

1011
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,927
Ain't that the same brother?

1012
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,846
You haven't heard the story.

1013
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,390
Everyone in Zamunda knows

1014
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:45,228
the legend of Prince Akeem

1015
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:48,815
in the land of Queens.

1016
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:51,442
Prince Akeem was
a dutiful prince

1017
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:53,152
and loyal son of Zamunda.

1018
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:54,278
Hello, Babar.

1019
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,863
But he believed that a man

1020
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,907
must walk his own path
and follow his heart.

1021
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,742
I intend to find my bride.

1022
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:01,577
What is wrong
with the one you have now?

1023
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:03,496
Bark like a dog.

1024
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,164
I want a woman that's going to

1025
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:07,041
arouse my intellect
as well as my loins.

1026
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,085
He flew across the sea

1027
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,586
to find his true love.

1028
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:11,838
Now there,

1029
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,924
in the barbaric land of Queens

1030
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:18,344
did Prince Akeem battle
bug-eyed burglars,

1031
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:20,221
foul-mouthed barbers

1032
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:23,099
and sexist men of the cloth

1033
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,476
to win the heart
of his true love,

1034
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,271

and beautiful and magical.

1040
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,454
A new dawn had arised
in Zamunda,

1041

a new sense of hope

1042

may have forgotten his story,

1045

but the people of Zamunda
have not.

Walk your own path.

Be not the prince of Zamunda.

I present to you Kareem Junson,

1058
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:52,313
aka Uncle Reem,

1059
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,357
my royal consigliere.

1060
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,525
That's Italian
for "mack daddy mentor."

1061
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:59,779
You need no other teacher
than your king and your father.

1062
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,198
No, no, no, no. See, you watch
your bottom lip, money grip,

1063
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,884
'cause you understand,
while y'all was out here

1064
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:05,618
riding elephants
and chasing Tarzan,

1065
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,913
I was schooling this boy
on the streets of Queens.

1066
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,933
- All right, well, that's...
- No, 'cause he don't know me.

1067
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:13,250
- You do not know me.
- No, you don't know me.

1068
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:14,377
You do not know me.

1069
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,812
- You don't know me.
- I will cut you.

1070
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,004
Enough of this.

1071
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:23,469
Uncle Reem of Queens...
you're welcome in my kingdom.

1072
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:24,804
Come on.

1073
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,931
Benson, y'all got
some crab cakes, man?

1074
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,057
I need some protein.

1075
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,351
- Who is Benson?
- Benson is you.

1076
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,228
Hold up. Hold up.

1077
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:34,689
Let me get my Spotify
on deck real quick.

1078
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:37,775
Let's rock.

1079
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,735
You ain't said nothing
but a thing.

1080
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:40,820
See his feet?

1081
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,113
- Yes.
- See where his hand at?

1082
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,864
- Mm-hmm.
- See how he moving?

1083
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:46,617
Yes. There's a fluidity to it.

1084
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:49,620
Yeah, it's like Bruce Lee said,
"Be like water."

1085
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:51,330
That's Hebbe Joffer.

1086
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:52,974
Legend has it
he could speak to animals,

1087
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,239
and people thought he was crazy

1088
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,091
until he made a giraffe
do the Electric Slide.

1089
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:59,213
It appears a royal wedding

1090
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,965
may soon be upon us.

1091
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,842
For more on this,
we are joined by Semmi.

1092
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,260
Good to see you, Totatsi.

1093
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:07,763
According to our ZNN source
inside the palace,

1094
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,765
we are hearing... and I quote...

1095
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:13,769
"The boy been balling
on this princely-ass test

1096
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:18,607
ever since his handsome
and mad smart uncle showed up."

1097
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:21,152
That is absurd, Totatsi.
Who is your source?

1098
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:23,112
What the deal? What the deal?

1099
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,239
Palace life for me.

1100
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,949
Who do you think you are, Reem,

1101
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,492
going behind the king's back?

1102
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:30,216
- You keep talking slick...
- G-Gentlemen.

1103
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,038
...and when my man
is running this place,

1104
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:33,873
you gonna go from
royal ass kisser

1105
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:35,708
- to royal ass wiper.
- No, no.

1106
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,561
- I will do no such thing.
- Please, g-gent...

1107
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:39,503
Yeah, well,
I eat a lot of fried food,

1108
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:40,880
so don't come at me with

1109
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,715
- anything less than two-ply.
- Oh!

- Don't hurt nobody.

1117
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,276
Yeah, you got something.

1118
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,046
- Now let me hear you say, "Hey, ho."
- I don't know...

1119
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,529
- Hey, ho.
- That's right.

1120
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:07,531
That's how we do it
in Queens, though.

1121
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:09,658
- Hey, ho.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1122
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:11,094
No, don't do that.
That's his mother.

1123
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:12,679
- Oh, don't say it to...
- No, not to his mother.

1124
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,306
- You obese American, you.
- No.

1125
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,706
Yeah, for 25 cents a day,

1126
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:18,417
I could sponsor-feed
your scrawny ass.

1127
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,336
Go to hell, you Western weasel!

1128
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:22,213
- Yo, well, why don't you go?
- Make me.

1129
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:23,964
You know something? Then I will.

1130
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,591
You cholesterol dumpster fire,
you.

1131
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,510
I... o-okay, okay.

1132
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:28,987
Totatsi! Call the guards!

1133
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,280
Let us, let us go
for a short break.

1134
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:31,680
Hmm.

1135
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:32,932
That's Forest Whitaker.

1136
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,391
I'm joking. That's not...

1137
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:36,560
That one is Tunde Joffer.

1138
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:38,288
Uh, he's the reason why
the Zamundans migrated

1139
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:39,438
from the north to the east.

1140
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:41,023
He's doing pretty good.

1141
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:43,609
Yeah?

1142
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,754
♪ I'm a queen, I'm a queen,

1143
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:48,322

1144

1145
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,660
There is but one test
that remains:

1146
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,495
retrieving the whiskers
from a lion.

1147
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:59,917
How will you conquer your fear?

1148
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,627
I'm not.

1149
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,254
It's a damn lion.

1150
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:05,256
Well, I found it is helpful
to think of them

1151
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,007
as just being big house cats.

1152
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:08,592
Oh?

1153
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,052
Just big house cats?

1154
00:57:10,136 --> 00:57:12,304
Really?
When'd you figure that out?

1155
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:14,723
Was that on your tenth
or 11th try?

1156
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,433
I know not what you speak of.

1157
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:18,144
I was successful my first time,

1158
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:20,479
- just like my father.
- Jaffe Joffer.

1159
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:22,982
- And his father before him.
- Jappa Joffer.

1160
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:26,068
Very good. Very good!

1161
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,488
Oh, watch.

1162
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:31,031
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, do not be alarmed.

1163
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:32,825
This Babar, he is my friend.

1164
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,827
I have known him
since he was a small elephant.

1165
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:35,953
Let him pass. Move.

1166
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:37,305
- Let him pass.
- All right.

1167
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,081
Come through, Babar, my friend.

1168
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:41,458
Babar, the magnificent one.

1169
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:44,003
I have known him
since he was a little elephant,

1170
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,880
and now he is a father, as well.

1171
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,506
- Wow.
- The great one!

1172
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,847
I must admit,
your manner and your style

1173
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,766
is foreign to my kingdom,
but it is impressive.

1174
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:01,478
Yeah? Damn, I'm just
trying to be like you.

1175
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,480
You know what I mean?

1176
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:06,400
You know, Mirembe,
my royal barber,

1177
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,777
told me the story that your pops

1178
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:10,988
wanted you to marry
a Nexdorian girl,

1179
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,200
so you bounced to Queens to find
a wife on your own terms.

1180
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:18,621
I wanted to find
more than a wife.

1181
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:22,249
To find someone that
I connected with on every level.

1182
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,168
Someone who knew
where I was coming from

1183
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,379
even though we came from
entirely two different places.

1184
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,720
And one might say I was
looking for myself, as well.

1185
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,893
Get some rest, my son.

1186
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:44,396
Thanks, Pops.

1187
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:08,295
He looks hungry.

1188
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:10,881
You can see it in how
he walks low to the ground.

1189
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:13,259
Look, man, you haven't liked me
since I got here,

1190
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:15,219
and I get that,
but ain't my fault

1191
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:18,013
your dad knocked up my mom and
dragged my ass back to Africa.

1192
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:20,557
Well, no one is
asking you to stay.

1193
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:22,476
It's all good, little sis.
All good.

1194
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,412
I'll be gone in a minute,
'cause I'm about to be

1195
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,729
- eaten by a lion!
- I hope so!

1196
00:59:25,813 --> 00:59:26,897
- Fine! Fine!
- Fine!

1197
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,615
You really think
I'm gonna fail, don't you?

1198
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:45,874
I have never said that...

1199
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,876
out loud.

1200
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,837
You ain't got to.

1201
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,255
It's that look.

1202
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:58,012
Been getting that look
my entire life.

1203
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:01,265
People writing me off
'cause of the way I talk

1204
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,726
or where I'm from.

1205
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:05,811
But you got no idea
what I'm talking about.

1206
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:08,105
'Cause you a princess.

1207
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:11,859
Princesses can be written off
just as much as anyone.

1208
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:15,070
I have been preparing
my whole life

1209
01:00:15,154 --> 01:00:17,865
to be standing where you are
in this moment.

1210
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,993
But you are right.

1211
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,911
It is not fair
for me to blame you

1212
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:25,289
for my father's mistake.

1213
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:27,833
Not that you are a mistake.

1214
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,835
- Well, you kind of are a mistake.
- Okay.

1215
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,879
I get it, I get it. A'ight.

1216
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,505
Damn.

1217
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,474
Perhaps the test has
nothing to do with bravery.

1218
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,772
The tests are also a challenge
of the mind.

1219

So, in sales, it's called
a bait and switch.

1226
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,336
So, the customer thinks
that they're buying something

1227
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:20,177
at half off,
so they come flocking,

1228
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,155
waving their wallets,
just hungry to buy something,

1229
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,972
but by the time they get there,

1230
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:26,100
you sell 'em the upgrade
at double the price.

1231
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,852
Yes. It is the same
as a technique

1232
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:31,522
we use in battle
called the feigned withdrawal.

1233
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,108
An army retreats
with the sole intention

1234
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,902
of drawing the enemy out
and ambushing him.

1235
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:39,405
So, what, in this scenario,
I'm-I'm the retreating army?

1249
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:11,812
My nephew could be eaten
by a man-eating lion!

1250
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,814
Besides, what kind of kingdom
is this?

1251
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:17,985
I don't see no Lunchables or
no lunch trays up here, nothing!

1252
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:58,025
No.

1253
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:02,154
Oh!

1254
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,825
Run! Run!

1255
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:08,869
Trust me, don't look back!

1256
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,454
Just keep running!
Keep running! Run!

1257
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:12,289
Keep running!

1258
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:29,723
No, no. No!

1259
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,145
He's trapped. I must save him.

1260
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:36,271
Stupid.

1261
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:37,356
Wait, Father.

1262
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:42,236
Look.

1263
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,370
What is this?

1264
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,123
What is this?

1265
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:57,918
What every dangerous
house cat likes.

1266
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:01,421
Cat food.

1267
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,501
I got 'em. Mm-hmm.

1268
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:46,133
He is almost ready
to become a prince.

1269
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,593
Wait, almost?

1270
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:53,140
It is time for umbajuntoo.

1271
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,892
- Umbajuntoo!
- Umbajuntoo!

1272
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:09,406
Uh, what's-what's, uh...
umbajuntoo?

1273
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,950
Ceremonial circumcision.

1274
01:05:12,034 --> 01:05:14,244
Ceremonial...

1275
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:15,888
That mean they're gonna
sharpen your tool, nephew.

1276
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,582
- Hold him.
- Hey, yo, ain't got to restrain me. Yo...

1277
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:20,560
- Hey, Ma, tell 'em we already did this!
- That's okay, baby.

1278
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,169
We love it here, right?

1279
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,129
Let them take a little bit
off the top.

1280
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:28,884
These are the foreskins
of your forefathers.

1281
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,219
- Ew.
- Joffer Joffer.

1282
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:33,138
Great-great-great-grandfather.

1283
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:35,182
Jappa Joffer.

1284
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,683
Your great-grandfather.

1285
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,685
Jaffe Joffer.

1286
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:39,770
Your grandfather.

1287
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:43,357
And King Akeem.

1288
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,781
Okay.

1289
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:12,594
What are you...
Oh, what is wrong with you?

1290
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:16,098
See, a potato.

1291
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,233
They got you, baby!
They got you!

1292
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:30,612
You just completed
the final princely test,

1293
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:33,240
- the test of courage.
- Courage?

1294
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:35,492
Need I remind you
I was face-to-face

1295
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:36,827
with a man-eating lion?

1296
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,162
For one to put
his member in danger

1297
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:41,915
is also a test of courage, yes?

1298
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:45,085
You are willing to sacrifice
what is most sacred.

1299
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:46,753
My penis?

1300
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:48,714
Your pride.

1301
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,217
Lavelle Junson of Queens,

1302
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,679
I hereby crown you

1303
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:58,223
the prince of Zamunda.

1304
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,814
Okay, so you thought
the best response was

1305
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:07,607
to let them cut it off?

1306
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:09,609
I was doing whatever it took.

1307
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,445
Like what, exactly?

1308
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,947
Well, to prove myself.

1309
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,949
You know, like,
I-I never really got

1310
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,576
the chance to do that back home.

1311
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:25,333
As you were.

1312
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,297
I take it you are growing
accustomed to a palace life.

1313
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,132
I mean...

1314
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:35,802
aside from some insane rituals
y'all have here,

1315
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:38,889
I suppose life here
ain't too bad.

1316
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,872
- Well, there are certain disadvantages.
- Uh-huh.

1317
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:47,790
- I mean, have you seen a Zamundan movie?
- Mm-mm.

1318
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,649
Total baboon dung.

1319
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:52,778
So, what, like, nothing
over a 30% on Rotten Papayas?

1320
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:54,279
Ah.

1321
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,490
American cinema is the best.

1322
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,492
The best? That is, like,

1323
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,869
the most blasphemous thing
I've ever heard.

1324
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:03,079
What do we have
besides superhero shit,

1325
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:07,334
uh, remakes and-and sequels
to old movies nobody asked for?

1326
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,211
This is true about sequels.

1327
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:10,712
If something is good...

1328
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,130
...why ruin it?

1329
01:08:12,214 --> 01:08:13,465
Mm.

1330
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,884
- Although there are exceptions.
- Like what?

1331
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,928
Are you familiar
with the Barbershop series?

1332
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:19,805
- Am I familiar with...
- Look at me.

1333
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:22,265
Of course I'm familiar
with the Barbershop series.

1334
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:26,311
My favorite spin-off is
the one with Queen Latifah.

1335
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:28,855
Yeah, but that's not Barbershop.

1336
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:31,441
That's Beauty Shop.

1337
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:34,277
To-mah-to, to-may-to.

1338
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:36,363
Potato, papaya.

1339
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,452
So, what,
American entertainment?

1340
01:08:42,536 --> 01:08:44,538
Is that our biggest difference?

1341
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:47,749
Well...

1342
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:51,503
there are certain freedoms
that exist outside of Zamunda.

1343
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:53,255
Okay.

1344
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:54,965
Like what?

1345
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:59,427
Okay, this is
going to sound stupid,

1346
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:02,556
but it has always been
a dream of mine to...

1347
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,641
to one day have
my own barbershop.

1348
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:06,768
Yo, that's awesome.

1349
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:09,729
Are you making fun of me?

1350
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,356
No.

1351
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,191
Nah, I'm being dead-ass.

1352
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:14,776
Do it.

1353
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,987
I-I don't know anybody
who can work scissors like you.

1354
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:19,281
Well, except
women are not allowed

1355
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:20,991
to own businesses in Zamunda.

1356
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:23,034
You serious?

1357
01:09:23,118 --> 01:09:24,536
Indeed.

1358
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:26,580
That's not cool.

1359
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:30,667
Well, I'm prince, right?

1360
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,335
So, you know something?

1361
01:09:32,419 --> 01:09:34,504
As long as I'm prince,

1362
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:37,299
I can promise you there's gonna
be some changes around here.

1363
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:40,093
Well, that is very idealistic.

1364
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,888
But every prince...

1365
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:45,140
promises to do things
differently,

1366
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:47,726
but eventually, they do things

1367
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:49,811
the same way they've always
been done before.

1368
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:54,065
Yeah, well, I'm not like
every other prince.

1369
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:56,192
Remember?

1370
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:58,153
I'm a prince from Queens.

1371
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,032
I wonder who told you that.

1372
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,492
Somebody.

1373
01:10:13,752 --> 01:10:16,338
I should not have done that.

1374
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:18,548
- I should not have done that.
- Wait. Wait, hold on.

1375
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:20,050
Mirem...

1376
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:21,760
Um...

1377
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:26,306
I think it is best you go to bed
and get some rest.

1378
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,726
Tomorrow is going to be
a very long day.

1379
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:32,604
You are one step closer to...

1380
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:34,898
marrying your princess.

1381
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:40,320
Good night.

1382
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,926
Presenting the crown prince
of Zamunda,

1383
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,928
Prince Lavelle!

1384
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:30,495
- King Akeem.
- Yes.

1385
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:32,163
So wonderful to see you,
General.

1386

Ooh.

1387

- General Izzi.

Compadre?

Well, if you're
going to wear that dress,

1415
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:57,999

01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:32,367
Two shots of chilled Cîroc.

1432
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:41,292
So, uh... marriage.

1433
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:42,919
It's a big step.

1434
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:46,548
I will make you a happy prince.

1435
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:51,845
What about you?

1436
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:54,556
How can I make you
a happy princess?

1437
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:56,432
What do you like?

1438
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:59,519
Whatever you like.

1439
01:14:00,562 --> 01:14:02,230
Okay, I'll back up.

1440
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:06,151
Uh, Bopoto,
what's your favorite movie?

1441
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:09,737
Whatever is your favorite movie.

1442
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:12,240
Uh... is there a goal you have?

1443
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:14,701
Is-is there a business
that you want to start?

1444
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,704
Whatever business
you'd like to start.

1445
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:31,134
I want to have a connection
with the person

1446
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:34,387
that I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with.

1447
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,973
But I am just a wife.

1448
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:45,982
- Can you wait right here?
- Okay.

1449
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:48,151
- But what shall I do?
- Just wait.

1450
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,944
Right here.

1451
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:53,072
I shall wait here.

1452
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,783

Hey, um, I don't mean
to interrupt,

1464
01:15:20,892 --> 01:15:23,770
but, Mutombo, do you mind
if I have a minute with her?

1465
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,146
My bad, man.

1466
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,065
No, no, no.

1467
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:28,608
It's your party, Prince.

1468
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,610
Come here, you gentle giant.

1469
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,654
Yeah.

1470
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,864
I need to talk to you.

1471
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:37,951
There's nothing for us
to talk about.

1472
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:39,285
Excuse me.

1473
01:15:39,369 --> 01:15:40,620
Yes, there is.

1474
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,830
I don't want to marry her.

1475
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:52,465
I want to be with you.

1476
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:57,303
You and only you are
the reason why I'm a prince.

1477
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:59,514
But, Lavelle...

1478
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:00,974
Look.

1479
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:03,851
My father...

1480
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:05,520
he'll understand.

1481
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:09,274
I'll be right back.

1482
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:16,739
I must say, you are more like
your father than I thought.

1483
01:16:16,823 --> 01:16:19,033
Oh, really?
Why do you say that, General?

1484
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:21,369
Snatching up this bastard boy
from America

1485
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:24,330
and throwing him
into our kingly affairs...

1486
01:16:24,414 --> 01:16:27,041
like a chess pawn?

1487
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:32,171
Your pawn just took
a future queen,

1488
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:34,716
and now there can be peace.

1489
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:36,843
And profit.

1490
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,096
Well played, King Akeem.

1491
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:42,098
Well played.

1492
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,899
I need to find my mom.
I need to find my Uncle Reem.

1493
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:55,278
We got to bust out
of this bullshit, man.

1494
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,280
Wh-Why? Where are we going?

1495
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:58,823
Home.

1496
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:02,243
A home...

1497
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:05,705
A home that we can build
together.

1498
01:17:24,349 --> 01:17:26,434
Uh, where is Prince Lavelle?

1499
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:29,604
My prince asked me to stay here
about an hour ago.

1500
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:37,820
Prince Lavelle Junson was seen
fleeing with the royal groomer.

1501
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:39,655
And he took his Uncle Reem

1502
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:41,342
and that wretched woman
with him, as well.

1503
01:17:41,366 --> 01:17:43,034
Show respect.

1504
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,119
She is still
the mother of my son.

1505
01:17:45,203 --> 01:17:47,497
She took the royal jet.

1506
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,248
That thieving bitch.

1507
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:50,833
King Akeem.

1508
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,836
Where is your prince?

1509
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,588
Ah, I do believe he has gone

1510
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,799
for one of his, um,
evening strolls.

1511
01:17:57,882 --> 01:18:00,051
He does that from time to time
to clear his mind.

1512
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,636
Oh.

1513
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:04,180
I hope he's not getting
cold feet.

1514
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:06,516
Nonsense.

1515
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:08,017
Good.

1516
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:11,145
Because I will be expecting
a wedding tomorrow.

1517
01:18:11,229 --> 01:18:12,688
Of course.

1518
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:19,821
Wedding bells, wedding bells.

1519
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:23,825
Everything that I have
done for him,

1520
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:25,576
I can't believe
he has done this.

1521
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:27,995
I make him a prince,
I give him a chance to finally

1522
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:30,540
make something of himself,
and this is how he repays me!

1523
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:34,168
I finally made
a friend from my own hood,

1524
01:18:34,252 --> 01:18:36,045
and now she's gone.

1525
01:18:36,129 --> 01:18:39,674
Oh, I'm-a miss her crazy ass.

1526
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:41,551
He could've told me
about this groomer.

1527
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:44,345
But, no, instead he runs off
to America without a word to me.

1528
01:18:44,429 --> 01:18:47,682
It is the most selfish act,
unworthy of a Joffer!

1529
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:49,392
It is spineless!

1530
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:51,769
Like father, like son.

1531
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:53,396
What did you say?

1532
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,440
- Uppity bitch say what?
- What?

1533
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:01,237
You are intoxicated, my queen.

1534
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,489
All kinds of
wiggity-wack stuff happens

1535
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:06,367
when you are drunk and high,

1536
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:10,079
including making babies

1537
01:19:10,163 --> 01:19:14,250
that you don't know
anything about.

1538
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,669
Right now you are getting
very in and out of my pocket.

1539
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,672
Are you trying to say
I'm out of pocket?

1540
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,942
What I am saying is, when a
person is drunk, they may say

1541
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:23,485
- something that they regret...
- So, whenever a woman

1542
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:24,987
speaks her mind, including
our daughter, then you just...

1543
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:26,451
...so I suggest
you mind your tongue!

1544
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:32,018
What happened to you, Akeem?

1545
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:36,063
You were supposed to
change things.

1546
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:39,525
You were supposed to bring this
kingdom to the 21st century,

1547
01:19:39,609 --> 01:19:43,946
but instead,
you push our daughter aside,

1548
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:49,035
someone who has dedicated
her life to this country.

1549
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,621
And because she's a woman,

1550
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,915
she can't be your heir?

1551
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:57,001
I cannot ignore
hundreds of years of tradition.

1552
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,669
I am the ruler of this land.

1553
01:19:58,753 --> 01:20:00,421
I must be strong.

1554
01:20:05,343 --> 01:20:06,761
I get it.

1555
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:10,431
You're the king.

1556
01:20:10,515 --> 01:20:12,642
Well, I'll tell you what.

1557
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:15,770
There are a lot of other beds
in this castle.

1558
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:19,982
I suggest you find another one.

1559
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:24,362
Would you dare banish me
from my own bedroom?

1560
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:26,155
Are you a fool?

1561
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:29,742
Do you see me hopping on one leg
and barking like a dog?

1562
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,728
What the hell is going on here?

1563
01:20:57,812 --> 01:20:59,355
He's in the back.

1564
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,649
He's been here for hours.

1565
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:08,656
Akeem.

1566
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:12,868
How you doing, son?

1567
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,163
I used to quite enjoy mopping.

1568
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:18,666
It was simple,
and it made sense.

1569
01:21:23,004 --> 01:21:25,923
Every day, I have moved
closer to the comfort of life,

1570
01:21:26,007 --> 01:21:28,050
and now my eyes are open,

1571
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:29,969
and the man that
I always wanted to be

1572
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:31,679
is on the other side
of the world.

1573
01:21:31,762 --> 01:21:33,306
Lavelle.

1574
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:36,892
Yes, he has fleed to America
for love just as I did.

1575
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:38,728
And now,
because of my stubbornness,

1576
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:40,771
I have run off my own son.

1577
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:43,774
Failed him as a father.

1578
01:21:43,858 --> 01:21:46,402
You're not just a father.

1579
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:48,112
You're the king.

1580
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:51,198
And heavy lies the head
that wears the crown.

1581
01:21:51,282 --> 01:21:53,993
Yes, I understand
that expression more now.

1582
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:56,537
It's not so much the crown
that is so heavy.

1583
01:21:56,621 --> 01:22:00,041
It's everything
that comes with it. Hmm?

1584
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:01,834
You've got your country to run

1585
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,754
and a crazy-ass general
breathing down your neck.

1586
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,672
And on top of all that,

1587
01:22:06,756 --> 01:22:09,508
you got to be
a husband and a father.

1588
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:11,719
Yes, you can see
that is most troubling.

1589
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,512
- Oh, I get it.
- Of course you get it.

1590
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:15,598
You are the king
of your own castle.

1591
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:18,100
And the troubles never stop,
Akeem.

1592
01:22:18,184 --> 01:22:20,227
When I introduced the McFlurby,

1593
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:21,979
the McDonald's lawyers
came after me

1594
01:22:22,063 --> 01:22:24,565
the same way this General Izzi
is coming after you.

1595
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:28,235
Cease-and-desist letters,
copyright infringement.

1596
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,448
I mean, the McFlurby
is nothing like the McFlurry.

1597
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:35,326
We put our toppings
on the bottom.

1598
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:38,371
So you have to stay strong.

1599
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,289
And you have to put
McDowell's first.

1600
01:22:40,373 --> 01:22:42,917
- I am McDowell's.
- And I am Zamunda.

1601
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,293
It's not the Golden Arches.

1602
01:22:44,377 --> 01:22:46,420
It's the Golden Arcs.

1603
01:22:46,504 --> 01:22:47,838
And I'm the boss.

1604
01:22:47,922 --> 01:22:50,007
And I am the MF'ing king.

1605
01:22:50,091 --> 01:22:51,342
You damn right you are.

1606
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:54,261
Cleo, thank you.

1607
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:57,056
I much needed to hear
the wisdom of a father.

1608
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:58,891
Well, I'm sure your father
would understand

1609
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,310
- what you're going through.
- Yes.

1610
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,022
Akeem.

1611
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:09,318
What do you think
your mother would say now?

1612
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:12,405
My mother?

1613
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:14,365
The queen.

1614
01:23:14,448 --> 01:23:18,619
I always thought that she was
the wisest of all the Joffers.

1615
01:23:18,703 --> 01:23:21,122
What do you think
she would say to you now, son?

1616
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:32,675
Zamundans, rise.

1617
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:34,135
Prepare the royal jet.

1618
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:35,636
I shall return to America

1619
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,805
and retrieve
this errant child of mine.

1620
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:39,765
General Izzi will return
in one day,

1621
01:23:39,849 --> 01:23:43,060
and if there's no wedding,
he most certainly will attack.

1622
01:23:43,144 --> 01:23:45,104
You stay here
and protect my family.

1623
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,523
I'm no warrior, Your Majesty.

1624
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:48,941
Remember who you are.

1625
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,484
You are a son of Zamunda.

1626
01:23:50,568 --> 01:23:52,570
Be strong.

1627
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,411
And I'll tell you
something else.

1628
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:02,079
I only like redbone gals.

1629
01:24:02,163 --> 01:24:04,582
Oh, see, that's where we part.
I like my women Black.

1630
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:05,875
I want a woman so Black,

1631
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,626
when you make love,
you need a flashlight.

1632
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,211
I'm looking for
the good stuff, man.

1633
01:24:09,295 --> 01:24:10,546
Hey! Mufasa!

1634
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:12,965
Hey, I hear you got
your boy back.

1635
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,842
My son has returned to Queens.

1636
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:16,153
It is most urgent
that I find him.

1637
01:24:16,177 --> 01:24:17,696
You know, he was here
a little while ago

1638
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,531
with a fine little, pretty
African thing. Wasn't she fine?

1639
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:21,891
- Mm-hmm!
- Yeah, talking about getting her a job here.

1640
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:23,684
Then they gonna
save up her money.

1641
01:24:23,768 --> 01:24:25,746
- Then she gonna get her own place.
- That's right.

1642
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:27,372
I told her she could start
right now, she was so fine.

1643
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:30,036
- That's right.
- But, she... they had to go off to their nuptials.

1644
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:32,651
Nuptials?

1645
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:34,278
- Yeah.
- Where?

1646
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:35,780
Near that Chinese restaurant

1647
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:37,573
where I caught the runs
last Saturday.

1648
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:39,158
- What?
- Oh, King Yum's.

1649
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:40,385
Gentlemen,
I have no time for this.

1650
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,328
That egg foo yong
made me have to stop off

1651
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:45,498
at my sister's last week
and make an emergency dump.

1652
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,082
Silence!

1653
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:48,643
I have no time to listen
to your stories

1654
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:49,794
about your bowel movements.

1655
01:24:49,877 --> 01:24:51,837
Where is the ceremony?

1656
01:24:51,921 --> 01:24:54,423
- Church of Holy Jubilation.
- Thank you.

1657
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:57,843
You're welcome.

1658
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:02,598
Who the hell he think
he talking to? Coming in here...

1659
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,409
Just 'cause he a king.
I got a dog named King.

1660
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:05,660
Yeah, he ain't
the king of this shop.

1661
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:07,394
- I'm the king of this shop.
- Exactly.

1662
01:25:07,478 --> 01:25:09,730
He was nicer
when he was a prince.

1663
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:19,031
Is this a pious house of God?

1664
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,575
If "pious" means cheap,
well, then you right.

1665
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:23,619
This the best house of God
we could find

1666
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:24,995
on a Tuesday afternoon.

1667
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:26,872
So let's get these rings
on these fingers

1668
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:28,999
before the all-day shrimp
ends at Sizzler's.

1669
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:30,843
I don't even know why
they call it "all-day."

1670
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,044
It ends at 6:00.

1671
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:33,629
Look, baby,
it's about the love, okay?

1672
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:35,297
Not the shrimp.

1673
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:36,966
- What's a Sizzler?
- It's nothing.

1674
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:52,064
I assume the prince has returned
from his midnight stroll

1675
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:55,442
and is prepared
to marry my daughter.

1676
01:25:55,526 --> 01:25:58,237
My apologies, General.

1677
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,782
Prince Lavelle is
currently indisposed.

1678
01:26:01,866 --> 01:26:03,701
Indisposed?

1679
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:05,786
Really?

1680
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:08,539
I will not continue
to be jerked around

1681
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:10,541
like a howler monkey

1682
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:13,127
grazing in a field
of horny goat weeds.

1683
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:17,006
Now, you tell me,
where is King Akeem?

1684
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:32,146
All right.

1685
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:34,064
Let's get hitched.

1686
01:26:34,148 --> 01:26:35,774
♪ Hallelu... ♪

1687
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:37,359
Let there be light.

1688
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:38,527
Hey!

1689
01:26:39,987 --> 01:26:43,824
We are gathered here today

1690
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:48,120
for the meeting
of these two beautiful souls,

1691
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:52,166
pressed together
like a pair of sumptuous...

1692
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,627
...beings.

1693
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,587
Yeah, Lord.

1694
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:59,298
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen!

1695
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:00,799
- Feel his presence?
- Yes, Father.

1696
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:02,134
I can't wait to go home and...

1697
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:05,346
Look, um, I just
want to apologize.

1698
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:10,017
I know this isn't exactly the
wedding you've always imagined.

1699
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,311
I don't know why
you would apologize.

1700
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:15,731
I'd always imagined there'd be
a womanizing, sexist officiant

1701
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:19,693
leading a very strange ceremony
in black socks.

1702
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,821
It couldn't be more perfect.

1703
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:25,282
- So nice, I want 'em to say it twice.
- Go on, preacher!

1704
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:26,575
Amen!

1705
01:27:26,659 --> 01:27:28,702
- Say it again.
- Amen, girl. - Hallelujah! Amen!

1706
01:27:28,786 --> 01:27:30,138
- Yes!
- Go on, girl!

1707
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,206
- Yeah!
- That's right, girl.

1708
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:33,499
You family now.

1709
01:27:36,085 --> 01:27:37,586
Take her.

1710
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:39,672
Keep her as a prisoner

1711
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:43,550
until King Akeem
gives me my answer.

1712
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:45,928
- Zoot!
- Zoot!

1713
01:27:59,108 --> 01:28:01,485
Teach this girl some respect.

1714
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,836
Halt!

1715
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:21,889
Take me to the Church
of the Holy Jubilation.

1716
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:24,299
Sorry, pal. You're gonna
have to go into the app.

1717
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:25,926
You can get a Lyft Lux.

1718
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:27,153
It's rush hour surge pricing.

1719
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:28,804
You might want
to look for a promo code.

1720
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:38,689
Fighting is not for pretty girls
and princesses.

1721
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:41,692
Your king and father
should have taught you

1722
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:44,737
to be more polite,

1723
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,822
not so nasty.

1724
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,577
Oh?

1725
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:59,043
Defend yourself, you sweat
from a baboon's balls.

1726
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:23,275
Meeka!

1727
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,708
Perhaps now you would like

1728
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:42,586
to solve your problems
diplomatically.

1729
01:29:45,339 --> 01:29:47,341
Do I have your attention?

1730
01:29:49,343 --> 01:29:50,469
I'm listening.

1731
01:29:51,762 --> 01:29:54,848
Now it's time for
the main event, young folks.

1732
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:58,143
Lavelle Junson, do you take...

1733
01:29:58,227 --> 01:30:00,354
Stop!

1734
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:04,733
Did you run here
all the way from Africa?

1735
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:07,152
Lavelle, you cannot do this.

1736
01:30:07,236 --> 01:30:09,530
And you cannot turn your back
on your family.

1737
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,716
- Family?! Let me tell you something!
- Oh!

1738
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:12,801
- I raised that boy!
- You ain't gonna

1739
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:14,034
run in here from Zamunda...

1740
01:30:14,118 --> 01:30:16,328
I know what I am to you!

1741
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:19,289
I heard everything
General Izzi said to you.

1742
01:30:19,373 --> 01:30:22,042
Using me as a chess pawn, right?

1743
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:24,670
- Lavelle, my son...
- Don't "son" me!

1744
01:30:24,753 --> 01:30:28,257
I'm gonna live my life
with the woman I love.

1745
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:31,802
Ain't no castle
or mountain of gold

1746
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:33,929
that's gonna stop me
from loving her.

1747
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,850
And I'm-a try my hardest
to make her happy.

1748
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:42,312
Now, do you or do you not
understand that?

1749
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:03,458
I do.

1750
01:31:10,007 --> 01:31:12,301
Long ago, I had your spirit.

1751
01:31:14,052 --> 01:31:18,265
I may not have been
as brave as you, Lavelle Junson,

1752
01:31:18,348 --> 01:31:21,059
but I know true love.

1753
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:26,940
When I told my mother that
my true love was my Queen Lisa,

1754
01:31:27,024 --> 01:31:29,151
she urged me to go to her,

1755
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:32,487
just as you have for your bride.

1756
01:31:32,571 --> 01:31:35,240
The burdens of my country
are not yours to carry.

1757
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:38,911
And if you want to stay here
in Queens and marry

1758
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:42,122
this fine Zamundan woman,
I shall not stand in your path.

1759
01:31:42,206 --> 01:31:45,459
I've been ruled by fear
for far too long.

1760
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:48,253
It's time for me to start
becoming my own king.

1761
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:53,592
My own man.

1762
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:57,721
Just as you did, my son.

1763
01:32:03,393 --> 01:32:06,897
So, please excuse my intrusion.
Carry on, please.

1764
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,374
Oh, wait, wait,
we into overtime now.

1765
01:32:08,398 --> 01:32:09,942
I need 200 more dollars.

1766
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:12,462
What you need is to start this
ceremony before I come up there

1767
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:14,988
- and beat your...
- Mary, Mary, if our son

1768
01:32:15,072 --> 01:32:18,242
wants to be married
in this glorious house of...

1769
01:32:18,325 --> 01:32:21,411
in-in this glorious house...

1770
01:32:21,495 --> 01:32:23,372
This is a house of God,
isn't it?

1771
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,082
More like a crack house of God.

1772
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:26,792
Ah. Then it shall be

1773
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:28,752
as magnificent
as a palace ceremony.

1774
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:29,920
Come. Sit.

1775
01:32:31,338 --> 01:32:33,090
Yes, continue.

1776
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:35,008
This doesn't feel right.

1777
01:32:35,092 --> 01:32:37,761
What?
You don't want to get married?

1778
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:41,348
No, I'm not saying
I-I don't want to get married.

1779
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:42,432
Then what?

1780
01:32:42,516 --> 01:32:44,226
Zamunda's my home.

1781
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:46,895
It is my pride and my joy.

1782
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:50,232
And what about your sisters?

1783
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:52,025
You think they don't need you?

1784
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:54,861
Well, um...

1785
01:32:56,113 --> 01:32:58,115
...maybe we should get married
at the palace.

1786
01:32:58,198 --> 01:33:00,492
But what about your people here?

1787
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:03,161
What about the land of Queens?

1788
01:33:03,245 --> 01:33:04,413
Wait.

1789
01:33:05,414 --> 01:33:07,624
Hear me now.

1790
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:10,419
I am King Akeem Joffer,

1791
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:13,130
and I'm bestowed
with great power.

1792
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:17,551
I shall bring Queens to Zamunda!

1793
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:19,094
Yes!

1794
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:20,554
That's what I'm talking about.

1795
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:22,514
They still wear silk.

1796
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:24,975

I think my kingdom was safer

01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:41,528
I simply acted as my father
and king has instructed.

1837
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:44,364
And that is why
I've issued a decree to Baba.

1838
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:48,368
When I am gone,

1839
01:35:48,452 --> 01:35:51,621
Meeka Joffer shall rule
as queen.

1840
01:35:51,705 --> 01:35:54,040
- But the laws.
- Will change.

1841
01:35:54,124 --> 01:35:57,586
With more changes to come
with your guidance.

1842
01:35:57,669 --> 01:35:59,337
And what about Prince Lavelle?

1843
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:02,841
Prince Lavelle shall serve
as an ambassador to America.

1844
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:04,926
Thank you.

1845
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:07,012
And as your brother.

1846
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:13,727
Forgive an old fool.

1847
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:19,316
Old fool
who loves you very much.

1848
01:36:26,281 --> 01:36:28,325
- Hi. How y'all doing?
- This is Mary.

1849
01:36:28,408 --> 01:36:29,910
Y'all look good tonight.

1850
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:31,203
Hey. How you doing?

1851
01:36:31,286 --> 01:36:32,926
Girl, you is making
a statement with that.

1852
01:36:32,954 --> 01:36:34,223
- You is making a statement.
- Thank you.

1853
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:36,291
King Akeem.

1854
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:40,795
Love has once again triumphed
in Zamunda.

1855
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:44,674
Oh, children,
you can go and play.

1856
01:36:44,758 --> 01:36:46,468
Go dance.
Shake your booties off.

1857
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:50,096
I hear the trade routes have
reopened between our nations.

1858
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:53,308
Yes. It will be a prosperous

1859
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:57,020
and peaceful time
for us old heads.

1860
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:01,191
I want to thank you
for releasing my sister

1861
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:03,235
from her canine curse.

1862
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,168
Yeah, give it up!
Give it up for Davido!

1863
01:37:20,252 --> 01:37:22,379
My man.

1864
01:37:22,462 --> 01:37:23,922
All right, all right.

1865
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:25,465
Where are my people
from Zamunda at?

1866
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:32,055
Dig all that. Okay, now,
where my people from Queens at?

1867
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:33,139
Queens!

1868
01:37:33,223 --> 01:37:34,891
- Yeah!
- Hey, right here!

1869
01:37:34,975 --> 01:37:36,202
- We in the house!
- In the building!

1870
01:37:36,226 --> 01:37:37,586
- In the building!
- We in Zamunda!

1871
01:37:39,563 --> 01:37:41,565
Well, I can dig that, too.

1872
01:37:41,648 --> 01:37:44,651
We're about to fix it into overdrive, okay?

1873
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:48,196
First of all, shout-out
to King Akeem and his family

1874
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:51,116
for bringing my favorite artist
back to Africa...

1875
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,701
Who is it? Who is it?

1876
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:54,661
- Wait, Kendrick Lamar?
- No.

1877
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:56,871
All right, we gonna
take this old-school now, okay?

1878
01:37:56,955 --> 01:37:58,373
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1879
01:37:58,456 --> 01:37:59,749
- Mary J. Blige.
- No.

1880
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:01,835
- Diana Ross!
- Nope.

1881
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:04,629
He's my cousin.
He's also my inspiration.

1882
01:38:04,713 --> 01:38:07,257
Okay? He's the wind
beneath my wings.

1883
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:08,675
Don't play.

1884
01:38:08,758 --> 01:38:10,278
Who could be better
than Diana Ross? Tell me!

1885
01:38:10,302 --> 01:38:11,988
- Oh, you'll see.
- Okay, I want y'all

1886
01:38:12,012 --> 01:38:14,764
to put your hands together
for Randy Watson!

1887
01:38:14,848 --> 01:38:16,534
Randy Watson in here?!

1888
01:38:16,558 --> 01:38:18,935
- And his band...
- Oh, Lord.

1889
