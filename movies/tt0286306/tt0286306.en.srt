2
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,229
There's a warrior coming!

3
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,589
I'm coming!

4
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:26,589
Right, check your weapons!

5
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:31,148
It's time to prove yourselves, gentlemen.
See you all on the other side.

6
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:33,427
Good luck.

7
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:35,587
Ready.

8
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:37,628
Advance!

9
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:41,267
I can't. I can't go.

10
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:42,866
Advance. Move.
You bloody little coward Shakespeare.

11
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:45,147
You're not fit to wear the King's uniform.

12
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:47,186
Do your duty!

13
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,546
I can't go.

14
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,106
Move!

15
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,106
I said move!

16
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:54,905
This is not the way.

17
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:59,024
Get your men over the top, Jennings!

18
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:03,304
Come on son. Come with me.
You've got to go over.

19
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,344
I can't go.

20
00:03:06,263 --> 00:03:07,784
Just stay with me.

21
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,623
Come on, let's go nail some Hun together. 
Yeah?

22
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:11,023
Gotta go. Gotta go.

23
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:13,103
Right gentlemen, good luck!

24
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:15,623
Good lad. Good lad.

25
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:20,502
Welcome to hell, Private Shakespeare.

26
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,019
Oh my God.

27
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,698
You're going to have to do this.
Now, come on.

28
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:56,298
Come on!

29
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,091
Come on Shakespeare.
Keep your head down, good lad. Come on.

30
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,850
Shakespeare.

31
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,010
Help me!

32
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:25,887
Shakespeare.

33
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:49,044
Oh my God!

34
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,843
Jesus!

35
00:05:51,204 --> 00:05:52,284
Christ!

36
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:57,603
Gas! Gas!

37
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:08,595
Where's your mask, private?

38
00:07:14,553 --> 00:07:15,514
Help me.

39
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:17,393
Alright Hawkstone. 
Calm down, calm down.

40
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:18,794
Don't breathe.

41
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,990
It's bloody fog.

42
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,069
It's just fog. It's not the gas.

43
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,988
It's not the gas.

44
00:07:58,068 --> 00:08:01,068
Doc, masks off. It's not gas.

45
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:03,588
Boys, take your masks off.

46
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:04,748
It's just fog.

47
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:13,346
What happened to the gas?

48
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:18,186
Fuck the gas. 
What happened to the night?

49
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:24,465
Come on Y Company, it's not a holiday camp.
Let's get moving.

50
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:40,704
Mcness.

51
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:41,583
Sarge.

52
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:42,623
Guess what?

53
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:43,703
You're on point.

54
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,982
Oh, fuckin' 'ell, Sarge!

55
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:48,023
How comes it's always me first out?

56
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:49,222
Is it a Scottish thing?

57
00:08:49,302 --> 00:08:50,343
No, it's not a Scottish thing.

58
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,662
Aye it is. I know it is.
It's a Scottish thing, isn't it?

59
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,462
It's not, it's because you're a...
because you're a...

60
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:56,461
fucking plank!

61
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:58,462
Aye, well, knew it was something.

62
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:45,696
Aaah. Lovely!

63
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:54,175
That's better.

64
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:02,213
Halten! Halt!

65
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:04,813
Sergeant, quickly!

66
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:07,573
You're looking the wrong way. Up here!

67
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:10,533
Get your filthy hands up!

68
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:13,572
Shut the fuck! Get your hands up!

69
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:15,172
Turn around! Up here!

70
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,612
What's the matter with ya?

71
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:18,492
On me. That's it.

72
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:19,612
Alright, Mcness?

73
00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:20,611
Quinn.

74
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:23,451
Oh, Christ!

75
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:24,451
Halt!

76
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:27,251
Fuckin' don't, Quinn.

77
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:28,891
Fuck! Shoot him!

78
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:30,450
We shoot back!

79
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,210
You, get down.

80
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,810
Get down.

81
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,250
Come back here!

82
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:40,569
Get down, you bastard!

83
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:41,729
Quinn!

84
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,648
Quinn!

85
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:49,968
Just doin' me job!

86
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:13,046
Okay, now just calm down, son...

87
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:14,685
Calm down.

88
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:18,085
Get off me.

89
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:21,044
I don't understand.

90
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:23,564
Do you understand this?

91
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:34,162
What?

92
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:38,403
Starinski, deal with him.

93
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:39,482
Sarge!

94
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:43,642
Look lively lads. We don't know
how many others are still in here.

95
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:45,001
Okay, on your feet. 
Come on, on your feet.

96
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:47,961
Alright, nice and gently, hip and shoulders, 
just roll him over gently.

97
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:53,841
Come on, come on, come on. 
Good man, good man Chevasse. Now I have to look.

98
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,400
I have to look. 
Good man, good man, sssh.

99
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,679
Come on, come on Chevasse.

100
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,400
Corporal.

101
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,800
Oh, God. It hurts.

102
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,039
Put your hand here.

103
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,199
Yes, sir.

104
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,238
How is he?

105
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:11,319
I think he's cut his spine.

106
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:16,038
The chances are that it'll turn gangrenous and er, 
I'm almost out of morphine

107
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,157
I could read to him.

108
00:12:19,797 --> 00:12:21,237
Yes, why don't you, 
because that'll help.

109
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:24,916
What'll we do, sir?

110
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:28,116
Stay here. Hold the trench.

111
00:12:28,836 --> 00:12:31,236
Sir, if I don't get him back
to our support trench, he will die.

112
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:34,715
I know.

113
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:38,475
Thank you, Corporal.

114
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:39,874
Yes, sir.

115
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:44,115
Okay, listen.

116
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:47,313
We've captured a forward, German trench.

117
00:12:47,794 --> 00:12:49,394
It's a rare achievement, gentlemen.

118
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:52,593
It may be vital to the war effort.

119
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:57,073
We will hold this trench 
until we are reinforced. We must...

120
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:00,032
that is our duty.

121
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:03,832
Get some scoff on, get a brew going...

122
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:06,352
See if we can't make the best of it, eh?

123
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:07,791
Make the best of it?

124
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:10,111
He makes it sound like a bloody holiday.

125
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:12,870
I went to Blackpool once.

126
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:15,150
Yeah?

127
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,071
Nice?

128
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,070
I killed a man there. 
Yeah, it was nice.

129
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:38,547
How old are you, son?

130
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:39,908
Nineteen, Sarge.

131
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:42,227
Don't fuck me about. 
How old are you?

132
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:46,227
Sixteen.

133
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:49,386
And a half.

134
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:55,506
Bloody hell. So you lied
about your age and signed up?

135
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,426
Yeah?

136
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,425
Is this what you wanted? Eh?

137
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:03,145
Go and sit over there.

138
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:07,384
Come and sit down here.

139
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:14,343
Och, don't worry about it.
He didn't believe I was nineteen either.

140
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:17,543
We're not secure, sir.

141
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:19,303
Well, the men are exhausted,
they need a rest.

142
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:20,743
This is a German dug out.

143
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,383
It'll be dark soon. 
We're not secure, sir.

144
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:25,822
Yes, of course, 
you're right, sergeant.

145
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,582
Right, let's secure the trench.

146
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:31,781
Sergeant, if you would.

147
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:32,861
Yeah.

148
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:37,661
Right, Quinn, Starinski, Hawkestone,
McNess, Shakespeare,

149
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:39,100
we're gonna secure this trench.

150
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,060
Oh bloody hell, Sarge.

151
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,860
Doc, if you can take Chevasse up there,
under that cover.

152
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,140
Make him as comfortable as possible.

153
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,740
Sarge.

154
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,860
What about him?

155
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,219
I don't want him watching my back.

156
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:53,379
Shakespeare's coming.

157
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:55,939
Right, ladies. Move out!

158
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:17,536
Y Company on me, anything to report?

159
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:19,815
It's like a maze, Sarge.

160
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,215
There's no front line or nothing.

161
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:23,855
What's the fuckin' point of that?

162
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:25,215
Maybe they forgot where the war was.

163
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:26,535
Feels like the war was in here.

164
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:29,015
Right lads, listen up.
If we're going to hold this trench,

165
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,014
we need to make it
a smaller area to defend.

166
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:32,694
We'll set charges here,

167
00:15:32,854 --> 00:15:34,933
here and twenty yards down there,
on the right.

168
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:36,974
That'll bring down
this section of the dugout.

169
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,773
After that, we rest.

170
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:40,733
Come on, move it!

171
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:49,612
Who's going to be hiding here?

172
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:53,011
Well, that German and his pals for one.

173
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:57,811
Help me.

174
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,850
It's just pure luck you made it this far,
isn't it, Shakespeare?

175
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,610
We've wired up the detonator right,
haven't we?

176
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,609
If you've got it wrong,
you'll blow us all to hell.

177
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,929
Don't you trust me, huh?

178
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:16,969
Well, that's a good sign.

179
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:18,168
Alright, heads down.

180
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:22,968
Why isn't...

181
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,406
Jesus Christ, did you hear that?

182
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:40,646
Aye.

183
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:42,166
Good work, lads.

184
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:43,885
What bloody good is that?

185
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:46,525
Only half as much to defend now,
isn't there?

186
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,162
Corporal!

187
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:19,961
Sir!

188
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,400
How long would you say
we were walking back there in the fog?

189
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:27,080
Couple of hours, maybe?

190
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,280
Really?

191
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,119
Why?

192
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,080
Well, I...

193
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:37,679
Sir.

194
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:42,918
Bradford?

195
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:46,638
It's one of these new crystal radio units, sir. 
We've got then in command.

196
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,438
But can we raise HQ with it?

197
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:50,477
I don't know, I can try.

198
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:55,077
There's so many dead.

199
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:58,957
That German's gonna be
a million miles from here.

200
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:01,076
There's plenty of rats, though.

201
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:02,596
That's a German bayonet.

202
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:05,395
Were they fighting each other?

203
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:07,555
Hun sticking Hun.

204
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:11,395
Jesus, what happened here? 
Look at this.

205
00:18:11,475 --> 00:18:12,434
But why?

206
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:15,034
Maybe gas.

207
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:19,754
Gas can make you do funny things.

208
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:22,234
What do you think McNess?

209
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:25,433
I think, if they keep this up,

210
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:27,513
we won't have to do any fighting ourselves.

211
00:18:34,032 --> 00:18:35,033
Oi!

212
00:18:39,512 --> 00:18:41,311
Woah, close one!

213
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:42,831
What is it?

214
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:44,351
It's a bullet.

215
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,590
I'd hang on to that. Might be lucky.

216
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,830
Lucky it didn't blow his balls off!

217
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,869
Hey!

218
00:18:57,989 --> 00:19:01,509
Nobody rests until we secure every inch
of this trench. Alright?!

219
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:03,108
Sarge.

220
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:04,869
Now, on me.

221
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,145
Shakespeare. Take this morphine.
Make sure Doc gets it for Chevasse.

222
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:32,985
Yes, sir.

223
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:35,745
Don't call me sir, lad. I'm a sergeant.
I work for a living.

224
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:38,784
Take it down.

225
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,224
Take it down. 
Good boy, good boy.

226
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:44,664
That's it.

227
00:19:47,663 --> 00:19:48,544
I think...

228
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:52,063
I think I can move my hands a little.

229
00:19:53,503 --> 00:19:54,582
Well, that's good.

230
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:56,902
Look.

231
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:00,342
See my fingers?

232
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:03,702
See them moving?

233
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:04,741
I do, yeah.

234
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:07,061
We'll have you doing
the Lambeth Walk in no time.

235
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:09,061
And this'll help.

236
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:20,459
Right, get some rest.

237
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:21,580
You're not going.

238
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,379
I have to go mate, 
there's a lot of work to be done,

239
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:26,898
but Bradford's here though, okay?
Now, get some sleep.

240
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:29,938
Keep an eye on him.

241
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:48,696
No tits on her.

242
00:20:49,735 --> 00:20:50,896
Wouldn't mind that.

243
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:52,016
Keep that one.

244
00:20:52,815 --> 00:20:53,816
That one will do.

245
00:20:56,575 --> 00:20:57,495
What?

246
00:21:00,654 --> 00:21:01,735
Any British command.

247
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:03,894
Any British command.

248
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:07,813
Any British command receiving this, 
please respond.

249
00:21:08,854 --> 00:21:10,613
Any Allied listening post.

250
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:14,613
This is a British unit lost in enemy territory. 
Urgently need assistance, over.

251
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:19,012
Anyone. Anyone, fucking anyone. 
Shit.

252
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:23,292
<i>Y Company. Y Company. 
We've lost...</i>

253
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:24,732
Captain Jennings. Captain!

254
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:25,931
<i>We've lost Y Company.</i>

255
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,012
Bradford!

256
00:21:27,092 --> 00:21:29,811
No, no this is Y Company.
There are survivors...

257
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:31,211
<i>We've lost Y Company.</i>

258
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:32,891
What is it?

259
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:33,931
Have you made contact?

260
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:34,771
Yes, sir.

261
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:35,530
Well done.

262
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,850
<i>Y Company. There are no survivors.</i>

263
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,010
<i>Repeat. There are no survivors.</i>

264
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,250
This is Captain Bramwell Jennings,
Y Company, 5th Battalion.

265
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,489
We have captured a forward German trench.

266
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,569
Location unknown.
We need urgent support, over.

267
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:47,329
<i>Y Company.</i>

268
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:48,689
Yes, Y Company.

269
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:50,329
<i>There are no survivors.</i>

270
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:51,488
What's that mean?
Why are they saying that?

271
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:52,849
It's a mistake, it's a mistake.
They'll send support.

272
00:21:52,969 --> 00:21:54,208
Sir, but if they think we're dead,
they won't try to find us...

273
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:55,448
It's a mistake. It's a mistake.

274
00:21:55,568 --> 00:21:56,368
<i>Y Company?</i>

275
00:21:56,488 --> 00:21:58,407
The survivors of Y Company have regrouped. 
We are...

276
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:05,926
Don't tell the men.

277
00:22:06,086 --> 00:22:06,446
But sir...

278
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:08,926
Do you understand me, don't tell the men.

279
00:22:09,006 --> 00:22:11,206
It's a mistake. They will find us.

280
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:18,885
Hawkestone!

281
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
Sergeant!

282
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,320
Sergeant!

283
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,279
Get down!

284
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,079
Get down, you fuckin' Hun bastard.

285
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:12,679
Fuck you!

286
00:23:22,877 --> 00:23:23,878
Sergeant!

287
00:23:24,358 --> 00:23:25,277
Sergeant!

288
00:23:26,357 --> 00:23:29,956
Halt! Halt you fucking Hun bastard.

289
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:35,276
Starinski!

290
00:23:36,036 --> 00:23:40,235
Hello mate. Hello Fritzen.
You are gonna die!

291
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:42,795
What do you want? What do you want?
This one, or this one, eh?

292
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:44,195
This one, or this one?

293
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:50,754
Oi, Quinn.

294
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:53,074
Not, while I'm around.

295
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:54,394
Yeah, how long's that gonna be then?

296
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,513
Long enough.

297
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,993
Thank fuck he's on our side, huh?

298
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,390
I really thought my time was up.

299
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,950
Got a girl at home.

300
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,109
Yeah.

301
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:32,669
What's she like?

302
00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:34,549
She blonde?

303
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:36,188
Brunette?

304
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:37,389
I'd love a piece of cheese.

305
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:38,748
I know you would.

306
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:40,068
Wensleydale.

307
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:41,708
Lancashire crumbly.

308
00:24:42,268 --> 00:24:43,068
Cheddar.

309
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:47,428
I'd better take watch.

310
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:48,867
Good luck, yeah.

311
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:52,387
Well Shakespeare, that was a gastronomic delight. 
Well done, son.

312
00:24:52,587 --> 00:24:53,746
Glad you liked it, Sarge.

313
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:56,226
That was so good, 
you can have me blanket.

314
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:58,467
Thank you, Sarge.

315
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:01,665
A few seconds,
and you'll be out like a light.

316
00:25:02,306 --> 00:25:03,386
So get some sleep.

317
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:04,785
Thanks, Doc.

318
00:25:09,665 --> 00:25:10,585
Bradford?

319
00:25:11,265 --> 00:25:13,265
Come and have a pew by the fire.
Let me have a look at that leg.

320
00:25:19,703 --> 00:25:20,824
Any luck with the radio?

321
00:25:20,984 --> 00:25:21,943
Er, not yet.

322
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:24,383
The chances of getting a signal 
are pretty slim.

323
00:25:24,663 --> 00:25:26,063
More likely to end up talking to the Hun.

324
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:27,582
Well, that's not a bad thing.

325
00:25:27,863 --> 00:25:29,422
At least they might be able 
to tell us where we are.

326
00:25:30,222 --> 00:25:31,343
Doesn't the Captain know?

327
00:25:31,742 --> 00:25:32,662
Doubt it.

328
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,182
I think he'd rather be tucked up in Sandhurst, 
polishing his boots.

329
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:37,061
You served with him before?

330
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:40,141
No, no. He was posted to us
when our last CO was hit.

331
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:41,541
He seems decent enough.

332
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:43,381
He seems like a man out of his depth,
if you ask me.

333
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,500
At least, we've still got Tate.

334
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,939
Chevasse is gonna die, isn't he?

335
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,339
Yeah.

336
00:25:56,499 --> 00:25:57,779
I shipped over with him.

337
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:00,218
He said he had a fiance in Norwich.

338
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:01,819
What?

339
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:02,898
Well, you heard the joke?

340
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:05,218
What joke?

341
00:26:05,418 --> 00:26:06,378
Girl in Norwich.

342
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:07,978
I don't get it.

343
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:11,377
Knickers. Off. Ready. 

344
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:13,777
When. I. Come. Home. 
Norwich, you see. It's a joke.

345
00:26:13,897 --> 00:26:15,137
Oh.

346
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,297
You haven't heard it?

347
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:17,057
No.

348
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:18,977
Right. You've dressed this well.

349
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,536
Yeah, practice makes perfect.

350
00:26:20,816 --> 00:26:23,016
I'm only twenty,
I've already been shot four times.

351
00:26:23,536 --> 00:26:24,776
Your friend up there must like you.

352
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:28,215
Not exactly spreading it around much 
though, is he?

353
00:26:29,175 --> 00:26:30,655
God has love for us all.

354
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:33,094
You just have to open your heart.

355
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:35,454
I don't think God is anywhere
near this place.

356
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,654
He brought us here, didn't he?

357
00:26:38,214 --> 00:26:41,854
Out of the battle, out of the gas.
We were blessed.

358
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,654
Blessed? Really.
What about Chevasse, is he blessed?

359
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,253
God works in mysterious ways.

360
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:49,573
And there are better places than here.

361
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:53,612
Fuckin' Sergeant needs anything doing,
it's always McNess.

362
00:26:53,772 --> 00:26:55,932
McNess, you killed the president,
McNess on point.

363
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:58,731
What about Starinski?
It's never fuckin' Quinn.

364
00:26:58,811 --> 00:27:00,132
What about Hawkestone? No.

365
00:27:00,212 --> 00:27:01,211
Fuckin' me.

366
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:03,091
I know what it is.

367
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:06,250
It's a Scottish thing.
He doesn't like Scots, that's what it is.

368
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:09,130
Maybe it's because he trusts you.

369
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,850
Aye. Well, there's that as well.

370
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:14,850
Trust me on this, right?

371
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:16,929
We shouldn't be here.

372
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:20,129
Fuckin' dead bodies everywhere.

373
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:25,409
Why? Why haven't they come back
for the trench?

374
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:28,249
Why haven't they come back for the men?

375
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,767
Ah? Why haven't they come back for you?

376
00:27:33,088 --> 00:27:34,127
We shouldn't be here.

377
00:27:35,728 --> 00:27:37,447
Do you think our men
will come back for us?

378
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:14,562
Stay alert. Stay awake.

379
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:30,801
Right, that says prison to me.

380
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,079
Get in there.

381
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,319
In there.

382
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,079
Aye, why not?

383
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:45,999
Get in there.

384
00:28:52,518 --> 00:28:53,478
Get in.

385
00:28:53,918 --> 00:28:55,277
Or I'll fuckin' shoot ya.

386
00:28:56,198 --> 00:28:57,118
Get in!

387
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:00,677
Shoot him!

388
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:03,797
Go on, shoot him.

389
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:04,597
Why?

390
00:29:04,757 --> 00:29:06,556
Because he kicked me in the fuckin' balls.

391
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,836
Why kill him?
What good's that going to do anyone? 

392
00:29:09,996 --> 00:29:10,796
He's scared.

393
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:15,475
Fuckin' should be.

394
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:19,475
Come on, what else you gonna do?

395
00:29:19,755 --> 00:29:20,634
Get in.

396
00:29:22,754 --> 00:29:23,434
Come here.

397
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:27,194
McNess. McNess, don't!

398
00:29:37,753 --> 00:29:41,592
What now? Do you wanna make him 
a wee cup of cocoa?

399
00:29:51,631 --> 00:29:53,710
Evenin' Fraulein.

400
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:21,907
Oh, yeah.

401
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:31,546
Yeah. Yeah.

402
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:34,505
Oh... this fuckinn' rain!

403
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:39,185
Come on.

404
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,825
Yeah, nearly there.

405
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:45,504
Yeah...

406
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:48,584
Oi, who's that?

407
00:31:08,102 --> 00:31:09,062
Quinn!

408
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:14,821
Not fuckin' funny!

409
00:32:01,215 --> 00:32:02,135
Got ya.

410
00:32:11,494 --> 00:32:13,374
What the fuck is goin' on here?

411
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,450
Oh my fuckin' God. Sergeant!

412
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:55,769
Better come and see this.

413
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:07,687
Starinski!

414
00:33:10,527 --> 00:33:14,206
There. Quinn, Hawkestone down there.
Shakespeare with me.

415
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,164
Starinski!

416
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:40,443
You try up there, I'm going down here.

417
00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:41,444
Sergeant.

418
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,039
Sergeant...

419
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:16,639
I've found Starinski.

420
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:23,478
There's more Germans here.

421
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:25,598
We're gonna have to find them.

422
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,077
English!

423
00:34:36,357 --> 00:34:37,716
Speak any French, Captain?

424
00:34:38,196 --> 00:34:39,276
I can.

425
00:34:47,436 --> 00:34:49,995
The other... ou est l'autre?

426
00:34:52,395 --> 00:34:53,314
What's French for German?

427
00:34:54,435 --> 00:34:56,594
Shut up! I'm not askin' you! 

428
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:01,714
I was a liaison with the French Command
before coming to the front.

429
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:04,473
I can speak French.

430
00:35:04,593 --> 00:35:06,513
- Well, you'd better do the translating then.
- Sir.

431
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:07,673
- Go on son.
- Sir. 

432
00:35:12,753 --> 00:35:15,472
Yeah, you're not proposing fucking marriage. 
Just find out where his mate is.

433
00:35:20,312 --> 00:35:21,271
What's he saying?

434
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:24,631
He said... well, sir, it's very hard...

435
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:25,711
What's he saying?

436
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,350
He said... look, I,
I think he said we're all going to die.

437
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:36,509
It's his Kraut chum who's gonna die.

438
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:38,270
He said something
about turning on each other.

439
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,789
I'm going to wrap barbed wire around him,

440
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:43,668
and squeeze him 
until he's nothing but little pieces.

441
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:44,948
He said none of us will survive.

442
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:53,188
Tell him that we know

443
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:55,187
his friend murdered one of my men...

444
00:35:55,307 --> 00:35:57,267
and when we find him, we're gonna kill him. 
Tell him that.

445
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,065
He said they're not the enemy. He said...

446
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:11,066
there's something wrong with this place, 
with this trench...

447
00:36:11,306 --> 00:36:13,065
Look he said it's in the earth,
in the ground...

448
00:36:13,265 --> 00:36:14,144
In the ground.

449
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,825
They must be using tunnels to get about.

450
00:36:20,904 --> 00:36:22,944
It killed all of them, it's gonna kill us too. 
He says we should leave.

451
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,143
Mal. What's that, what's that word?

452
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:32,903
Evil. It means evil.

453
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,220
This is Y Company,
and we're still alive...

454
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,819
Is anybody there? Anybody?

455
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,379
This is Y Company, 
and we're still alive.

456
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:07,698
No. No. No, we are alive!

457
00:37:08,898 --> 00:37:10,738
We are still alive.

458
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:20,457
<i>Bradford.</i>

459
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:28,376
Chevasse.

460
00:37:41,054 --> 00:37:42,014
Who's there?

461
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,374
Who are you?

462
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:50,494
Who are you?

463
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:57,773
These Bosch are worse dead than alive.

464
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:03,771
So what's the point of this?

465
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:05,812
It's easy to hide in the bodies, isn't it?

466
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:08,651
Put them all in one place,
and there's one less place to hide.

467
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:11,611
That's the last of them.

468
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:13,890
Those we can move anyway.

469
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,010
So much death.

470
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:22,610
Beggars the imagination.

471
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:27,089
Perhaps you'd like to say
a few words, Bradford.

472
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:32,368
The Captain's saying he wants
to hear something from your book.

473
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:34,888
Very well.

474
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:46,806
And the four angels were loosed...

475
00:38:47,606 --> 00:38:50,126
which were prepared for an hour,
and a day,

476
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:52,206
and a month, and a year.

477
00:38:52,606 --> 00:38:54,765
For they were to slay
the third part of men...

478
00:38:55,926 --> 00:38:59,965
by the fire, by the smoke
and by the brimstone...

479
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:02,685
which rained down about their heads.

480
00:39:04,404 --> 00:39:06,285
We have all made a covenant with death...

481
00:39:07,724 --> 00:39:09,443
and with hell we are in agreement.

482
00:39:10,324 --> 00:39:14,563
Who do you think you are,
the Archbishop of fuckin' Canterbury?

483
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:18,483
Ignore him.
You send one up there for me, aye.

484
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:21,963
When the over flown scourge
shall pass through...

485
00:39:22,202 --> 00:39:23,962
you shall be trodden down by it.

486
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:37,760
Are these better than ours?

487
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:42,960
Well, if you're looking for a nice line
in shrapnel wounds and severed limbs. Yeah.

488
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,320
Probably a little better.

489
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,639
Mind you, I hear our pineapples
make a pretty good fruit salad.

490
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:56,238
Why are we doing this?

491
00:39:57,158 --> 00:40:02,638
Ah, well... sometimes it's just better
to be doing something.

492
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:05,118
We know the enemy's still here somewhere, so...

493
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:08,917
Captain tells us we have to stay
and hold the trench, so...

494
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:12,797
we stay and hold the trench. 
That's the chain of command, we do what we're told.

495
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:14,716
And what then?

496
00:40:15,475 --> 00:40:18,635
All of us at risk to hold this place,
and we, we don't even know where it is.

497
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:21,715
Or what it is.

498
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:25,754
Right, we've got underground saps
all along here, yeah?

499
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:26,955
Some of them have got tunnels.

500
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:29,194
There, there and down there.

501
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,554
So we just chuck grenades in
and collapse the entrances?

502
00:40:32,634 --> 00:40:33,713
Yeah, that's about the sum of it.

503
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:34,954
Do you think it will work, Sarge?

504
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:36,033
Why not?

505
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:39,713
Oh, come on.
There's a bad feeling here. This trench.

506
00:40:40,393 --> 00:40:41,393
What you talking about?

507
00:40:42,513 --> 00:40:43,313
Sarge, something isn't right...

508
00:40:43,432 --> 00:40:44,712
What?

509
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:46,952
Nothing.

510
00:40:47,232 --> 00:40:50,112
Right, with a bit of luck the whole thing
will cave in and trap him down there.

511
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:52,272
Aye, or drive them out into the open.

512
00:40:52,392 --> 00:40:54,271
Yeah, either way we've got a result.
Alright?

513
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:54,831
Aye.

514
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:55,711
Bradford!

515
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:00,711
Bradford!

516
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:04,030
Tell Jennings one minute. Go on. Go!

517
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:12,349
We're ready, sir.

518
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:13,349
One minute.

519
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:15,229
Very good. Tell him to proceed.

520
00:41:16,468 --> 00:41:17,388
One minute.

521
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,426
Go on!

522
00:42:06,303 --> 00:42:07,462
Come on, on your feet.

523
00:42:07,782 --> 00:42:08,702
Patrol coming.

524
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:09,702
Get up!

525
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,740
Tate?

526
00:42:29,979 --> 00:42:30,980
Tate!

527
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:56,937
- Incoming! 
- Artillery!

528
00:42:57,017 --> 00:42:59,576
Hawkestone, go find the Captain. Go, Go!

529
00:42:59,696 --> 00:43:00,536
Sergeant.

530
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:03,255
Move! Move! Get in the bunkers.

531
00:43:03,575 --> 00:43:04,776
Take cover lads!

532
00:43:09,895 --> 00:43:10,894
Take cover, boys.

533
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,855
Fuck off!

534
00:43:14,895 --> 00:43:16,494
Shakespeare, get back in there!

535
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:17,894
In with Doc. Go!

536
00:43:17,974 --> 00:43:19,654
Charley, Charley!

537
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:22,534
Charley, get in here!

538
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:26,293
Keep down!

539
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:27,373
Keep the... where's it coming from?

540
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:27,933
Keep down! Keep down!

541
00:43:28,053 --> 00:43:29,012
Where are they?

542
00:43:29,172 --> 00:43:29,893
They're coming!

543
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:31,052
Right, here they come.

544
00:43:31,372 --> 00:43:34,212
Steady boys. 
Make every bullet count!

545
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:37,332
Stay focused.

546
00:43:38,412 --> 00:43:39,331
Easy.

547
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:41,091
Any second now.

548
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:47,050
Captain!

549
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,290
Tate!

550
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:52,770
Tate!

551
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,250
Tate!

552
00:44:05,128 --> 00:44:05,969
Tate!

553
00:44:07,368 --> 00:44:08,328
Tate!

554
00:44:15,647 --> 00:44:18,967
Tate! Tate!

555
00:44:20,727 --> 00:44:22,246
They're coming!

556
00:44:27,806 --> 00:44:28,646
They're coming!

557
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:30,605
They're coming! 
Tate, where are you?

558
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:32,445
Goddamit, where are you?

559
00:44:43,324 --> 00:44:44,683
Come on!

560
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,003
Who are you?

561
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,719
What happened? 
Huh, put the gun down!

562
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:23,559
Captain, put the gun down, it's me.

563
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:25,918
Put... put the gun down.

564
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:27,239
Cap...

565
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:32,318
Oh, Jesus Christ.

566
00:45:32,518 --> 00:45:34,478
Captain made his bullet count, Sarge.

567
00:45:40,797 --> 00:45:42,077
Oh Jesus...

568
00:45:42,557 --> 00:45:48,836
No, no! 
No, what's the matter with this place? 

569
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:51,836
Where's... where's the army?

570
00:46:02,114 --> 00:46:03,914
Got any words for us now, Archbishop?

571
00:47:01,787 --> 00:47:04,907
Sergeant Tate,
are we spending another night here?

572
00:47:07,426 --> 00:47:08,547
Is that a good idea?

573
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:10,786
It's up to the Captain.

574
00:47:13,346 --> 00:47:14,306
But what would you do?

575
00:47:15,385 --> 00:47:16,266
Stay here?

576
00:47:18,785 --> 00:47:21,825
There's something wrong with this place, 
isn't there?

577
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:23,705
Something not right.

578
00:47:25,104 --> 00:47:26,304
Look, what the Captain did.

579
00:47:26,584 --> 00:47:27,824
What happened to Starinski?

580
00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:29,943
I don't know what you're talking about.

581
00:47:31,384 --> 00:47:32,423
But the...

582
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,183
You heard it.

583
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:37,502
I heard nothing.

584
00:47:38,743 --> 00:47:39,343
Well, what about the noise?

585
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,022
I heard nothing.

586
00:47:41,503 --> 00:47:43,262
What did you hear, eh?

587
00:47:44,382 --> 00:47:45,262
You.

588
00:47:48,541 --> 00:47:49,542
You.

589
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:59,901
But the prisoner. What he said.
He said we'd turn on each other.

590
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,340
What are we gonna do.
I mean we can't just...

591
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,460
Shut up!

592
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:08,499
Just... just shut up with your questions.

593
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:10,899
He's the Captain, not me.

594
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:13,018
Ask him.

595
00:48:17,098 --> 00:48:18,698
Shakespeare, Shakespeare.

596
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:20,657
Come here.

597
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:27,697
We should leave right now.

598
00:48:28,136 --> 00:48:31,576
Two men dead. Do you want 
to add to that, Shakespeare, huh?

599
00:48:31,696 --> 00:48:32,657
Do ya?

600
00:48:35,056 --> 00:48:38,615
The Captain says we hold this trench.
So we're gonna sit tight.

601
00:48:38,975 --> 00:48:40,935
You're gonna sit tight.

602
00:48:42,415 --> 00:48:43,615
You understand?

603
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:25,370
Little Hun bastards.

604
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,249
What have you been doin' here, eh?

605
00:50:10,604 --> 00:50:12,204
Jesus Christ, Bradford.

606
00:50:13,004 --> 00:50:15,404
This place is scary enough
without you jumping out at me.

607
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:22,483
Are you alright?

608
00:50:25,602 --> 00:50:26,523
Good.

609
00:50:26,763 --> 00:50:28,242
You take over, I'm gonna get some kip.

610
00:51:19,516 --> 00:51:20,956
Right Bradford, I'm here.

611
00:51:24,476 --> 00:51:25,676
Bradford?

612
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:38,753
Well, that's just fuckin' great.

613
00:52:50,145 --> 00:52:51,785
Have you come for me, have you?

614
00:52:51,946 --> 00:52:52,985
Come on then.

615
00:52:53,985 --> 00:52:56,105
Is this my time, huh?

616
00:52:56,865 --> 00:53:00,064
Well, bring it at me.
You're gonna fuckin' need it.

617
00:54:00,577 --> 00:54:02,377
No!

618
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:21,534
What the fuck happened to you,
you stupid Scottish bastard?

619
00:54:21,614 --> 00:54:22,654
You alright, McNess?

620
00:54:23,295 --> 00:54:24,574
Come on, let me have a look.

621
00:54:26,813 --> 00:54:27,694
Wait!

622
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:30,974
McNess, what are you doing?

623
00:54:31,054 --> 00:54:31,853
Leaving!

624
00:54:31,973 --> 00:54:34,012
Well, that's the best idea
I've heard all day.

625
00:54:35,013 --> 00:54:37,612
McNess, you can't leave. 
You know that.

626
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:41,332
Look we'll dig in.
Build a strong defensive position.

627
00:54:41,531 --> 00:54:46,611
Defensive position? What are we 
defending against Sergeant, huh? What?

628
00:54:47,491 --> 00:54:49,931
Come on say it. Evil!

629
00:54:50,051 --> 00:54:52,330
Will you listen to yourself. Evil!

630
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,890
It's the gas,
we are hallucinating, that is all.

631
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,770
Was Starinski hallucinating, huh?

632
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,610
Is this a fuckin' hallucination?

633
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:00,610
There must be another sniper.

634
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:02,649
Germans we haven't found yet.

635
00:55:03,289 --> 00:55:04,409
I don't know.

636
00:55:04,529 --> 00:55:08,129
Aye, I know you don't know.
You don't know because you won't admit it.

637
00:55:08,249 --> 00:55:09,688
Fucking none of you.

638
00:55:10,368 --> 00:55:11,769
I don't... I don't wanna die.

639
00:55:13,248 --> 00:55:14,528
I'm not waiting to die.

640
00:55:14,608 --> 00:55:16,248
Mcness, please don't go out there.

641
00:55:16,368 --> 00:55:20,047
There's nothing out there. 
It's in here.

642
00:55:20,647 --> 00:55:22,407
It's in fuckin' here.

643
00:55:24,806 --> 00:55:26,047
Where do you think you're going?

644
00:55:27,526 --> 00:55:28,806
Deserters will be shot.

645
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:43,324
What would your father say
if he saw you now?

646
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:46,204
He'd say naughty boy.

647
00:55:47,004 --> 00:55:49,204
'Naughty boy' pointing weapons at people.

648
00:55:50,523 --> 00:55:53,523
I'll put you over my knee 
and I'll give you a damn good thrashing.

649
00:55:54,203 --> 00:55:55,603
That's what he'd say.

650
00:55:57,642 --> 00:55:58,963
Give me the gun, Captain.

651
00:56:04,602 --> 00:56:05,682
Give me the gun.

652
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:22,000
Remember your fuckin' manners.

653
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,080
Don't forget your fuckin' manners.

654
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:29,959
You are under arrest.

655
00:56:30,479 --> 00:56:31,439
Mcness!

656
00:56:50,397 --> 00:56:51,436
I don't see him.

657
00:56:51,596 --> 00:56:52,556
Right, hold on.

658
00:57:00,596 --> 00:57:01,515
Got him.

659
00:57:17,553 --> 00:57:18,633
Bradford!

660
00:57:23,952 --> 00:57:26,273
Jesus, Bradford.

661
00:57:30,432 --> 00:57:31,192
He's been hit.

662
00:57:31,312 --> 00:57:32,631
Where did the shot come from?

663
00:57:33,712 --> 00:57:34,351
I'd better go and get him.

664
00:57:34,471 --> 00:57:36,031
No, I'll get him. 
You cover me.

665
00:57:36,311 --> 00:57:36,910
Alright.

666
00:57:37,031 --> 00:57:39,310
Remember, just keep on the move.

667
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:42,510
Right, go!

668
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:21,546
Bradford?

669
00:58:29,065 --> 00:58:30,024
Bradford!

670
00:58:44,783 --> 00:58:45,902
Bradford!

671
00:58:51,902 --> 00:58:53,221
Bradford!

672
00:59:02,941 --> 00:59:03,980
Bradford!

673
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,540
Come out!

674
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,060
Now!

675
00:59:25,338 --> 00:59:26,297
Bradford!

676
00:59:27,538 --> 00:59:29,337
Bradford are you down here?

677
00:59:45,056 --> 00:59:46,335
McNess!

678
00:59:47,015 --> 00:59:48,255
McNess!

679
00:59:49,695 --> 00:59:50,575
Doc!

680
00:59:50,855 --> 00:59:51,534
Oh, fuck.

681
00:59:51,614 --> 00:59:52,375
McNess!

682
00:59:52,495 --> 00:59:55,975
I can't move, I've been shot.

683
00:59:56,414 --> 00:59:57,534
Doc!

684
00:59:59,614 --> 01:00:00,134
Doc!

685
01:00:00,254 --> 01:00:01,174
It's okay, mate.

686
01:00:01,373 --> 01:00:03,254
Help me, oh help me God.

687
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:04,733
I'm coming, I'm coming.

688
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:05,813
Doc!

689
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:33,330
Hello Charlie.

690
01:00:40,649 --> 01:00:41,689
Why did you shoot him?

691
01:00:42,008 --> 01:00:43,168
He was trying to leave.

692
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:45,768
We have to stay.

693
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:52,647
I'm a mess, man. Doc!

694
01:00:55,247 --> 01:00:56,087
I'm coming!

695
01:00:57,927 --> 01:00:59,087
I'm coming, I'm...

696
01:00:59,247 --> 01:01:00,206
Oh, God.

697
01:01:04,845 --> 01:01:05,806
Look at me.

698
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:12,845
Take out, take out your field dressing.

699
01:01:12,965 --> 01:01:14,045
Look at me!

700
01:01:15,444 --> 01:01:16,525
Look at me!

701
01:01:24,804 --> 01:01:26,363
Hold on, McNess!

702
01:01:27,763 --> 01:01:34,603
Hold on, McNess! Hold on McNess!
Hold on, McNess! Hold on to me! McNess!

703
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,160
What's happened to you, Bradford?

704
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,840
It's inside me, Charley. 
I can feel it.

705
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,719
It's moving around like worms in my gut,

706
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:02,879
I can't stop it.

707
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:04,079
What?

708
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,679
What is it?

709
01:02:05,878 --> 01:02:06,918
It's death!

710
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:09,598
And it's waiting for us.

711
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:14,637
All this blame, this hatred...

712
01:02:17,197 --> 01:02:20,717
Come on, Bradford. 
Come back with me.

713
01:02:22,157 --> 01:02:24,196
It's in the earth, and the rats,

714
01:02:24,276 --> 01:02:26,756
and the flies, and you and me.

715
01:02:28,196 --> 01:02:31,755
We're dead, Charley. I know that now.

716
01:02:33,835 --> 01:02:35,875
I can't feel my heart beating anymore.

717
01:02:39,114 --> 01:02:41,155
I died here, 
and I just didn't realise it.

718
01:02:41,754 --> 01:02:44,834
Come on. Come back with me.

719
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:47,353
No. You have to stop me.

720
01:02:48,714 --> 01:02:49,793
I'm not a murderer.

721
01:02:51,274 --> 01:02:52,313
You will be.

722
01:02:54,232 --> 01:02:58,953
I was wrong, you see. God is dead.

723
01:02:59,672 --> 01:03:00,712
We're all alone.

724
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:03,512
Bradford.

725
01:03:04,671 --> 01:03:08,271
Bradford! Where are we?

726
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:15,870
Tate, barricades won't work.
It didn't help the Germans.

727
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:18,910
That thing out there took McNess.

728
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:21,950
Right in front of my eyes,
sucked him into the fuckin' mud.

729
01:03:22,149 --> 01:03:24,390
So what are we gonna do.
Hide round some boxes?

730
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:25,709
Captain.

731
01:03:27,348 --> 01:03:28,789
Captain, we need a hand here.

732
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:40,547
Halt! Who's there?

733
01:03:42,147 --> 01:03:42,947
It's me!

734
01:03:44,147 --> 01:03:44,986
It's me.

735
01:03:45,546 --> 01:03:47,426
Shakespeare, where the hell have you been?

736
01:03:48,226 --> 01:03:48,986
Come give us a hand, will ya?

737
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:50,026
Sarge.

738
01:03:58,945 --> 01:04:00,144
Bradford shot McNess.

739
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:02,904
I saw him do it.

740
01:04:04,505 --> 01:04:06,304
He shot his own man.

741
01:04:08,504 --> 01:04:10,863
That's not gonna do us any good, Sergeant.

742
01:04:11,704 --> 01:04:13,023
Not against what's in here.

743
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:17,383
I'm a soldier, son. I fight what I can see. 
What's in front of me.

744
01:04:18,302 --> 01:04:21,942
But it's not in front of us.
Don't you understand that yet?

745
01:04:22,342 --> 01:04:23,742
Look, you're not listening.

746
01:04:24,582 --> 01:04:25,981
You're meant to be in charge.

747
01:04:26,061 --> 01:04:27,502
Just listen to him.

748
01:04:28,701 --> 01:04:32,501
Oi! Hun! Hun!

749
01:04:34,821 --> 01:04:36,540
You wanna kill me?

750
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,020
Well, come on then.

751
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,980
Come on, come on then!

752
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,899
I'm waiting.

753
01:05:17,335 --> 01:05:18,656
Where do you think you're going?

754
01:05:18,935 --> 01:05:20,055
I can't let Quinn kill the prisoner.

755
01:05:20,175 --> 01:05:20,615
You mad?

756
01:05:20,695 --> 01:05:23,855
Shakespeare, you don't fight 
your own men to save the enemy.

757
01:05:24,374 --> 01:05:25,935
But he's not the enemy.

758
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:29,294
Look we can't let this go on,
not in this place.

759
01:05:32,534 --> 01:05:33,494
Please...

760
01:05:34,533 --> 01:05:36,014
Alright, I'll bring him back myself.

761
01:05:37,773 --> 01:05:38,813
Out my way, Doc.

762
01:05:42,292 --> 01:05:43,373
Sergeant Tate?

763
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:44,492
Sir.

764
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:46,092
Muster the men, please.

765
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:48,452
Sir.

766
01:05:48,572 --> 01:05:51,372
For inspection,
muster the Company if you would. 

767
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:53,131
What about Quinn?

768
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:56,970
There's no Company left, sir.

769
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:58,451
Nothing to inspect.

770
01:05:58,571 --> 01:05:59,570
Just follow your orders.

771
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:00,570
Oh, for God's sake, man...

772
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,451
Carry out my orders!

773
01:06:01,531 --> 01:06:02,570
This is not the time.

774
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:09,570
You are a weak man, Sergeant Tate.
I've always thought that of you.

775
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:12,809
And you are a streak of posh,
fucking piss, sir!

776
01:06:17,488 --> 01:06:18,568
Captain, no!

777
01:06:18,688 --> 01:06:20,848
You are relieved of your duties.

778
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:26,727
Private First Class Shakespeare,
falling in for inspection, sir.

779
01:06:26,808 --> 01:06:28,887
Corporal Fairweather 
falling in for inspection, sir.

780
01:06:30,927 --> 01:06:32,407
You are relieved of your duties.

781
01:06:32,886 --> 01:06:33,806
Very good.

782
01:06:38,446 --> 01:06:40,485
Doesn't do to let standards slip, Corporal.

783
01:06:40,565 --> 01:06:42,206
You have a responsibility
to these young men.

784
01:06:42,286 --> 01:06:43,245
Yes, sir.

785
01:06:46,525 --> 01:06:48,284
What is that godawful racket?

786
01:06:49,485 --> 01:06:50,924
That's Private Quinn, sir.

787
01:06:52,445 --> 01:06:54,244
And why is he not here for inspection?

788
01:06:55,084 --> 01:06:56,044
Sergeant!

789
01:06:58,203 --> 01:07:00,723
Why is Private Quinn
not here for inspection?

790
01:07:03,082 --> 01:07:06,202
Right. Well done men, you fall out.

791
01:07:06,562 --> 01:07:08,122
I'm going to go 
and have a word with Private Quinn.

792
01:07:08,202 --> 01:07:09,762
Please, don't do that, sir.

793
01:07:09,962 --> 01:07:10,962
He'll kill you, sir.

794
01:07:12,402 --> 01:07:13,441
I'm an officer.

795
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,999
Quinn!

796
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:35,679
What do you think you're doing?

797
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:41,638
Take that man down and get back
to the trench for inspection, now.

798
01:07:52,077 --> 01:07:52,877
And?

799
01:07:55,797 --> 01:07:57,156
Take your hands off me.

800
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:01,755
You know what I hate most
about this fuckin' war?

801
01:08:03,796 --> 01:08:04,635
It's not the mud...

802
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:07,595
or the cold...

803
01:08:16,114 --> 01:08:17,074
or the wet...

804
01:08:23,754 --> 01:08:24,593
Sarge?

805
01:08:25,793 --> 01:08:28,513
Or even the Hun...

806
01:08:38,432 --> 01:08:39,671
What have I done?

807
01:08:39,791 --> 01:08:41,871
It's the fucking officers.

808
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,350
Sarge!

809
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,189
Make your peace.

810
01:08:55,869 --> 01:08:58,949
Quinn! No!

811
01:09:00,749 --> 01:09:02,109
Quinn!

812
01:09:12,268 --> 01:09:13,387
Quinn!

813
01:09:26,906 --> 01:09:28,625
You ain't come to arrest me again, have ya?

814
01:09:28,825 --> 01:09:32,784
I'm not gonna arrest you, Quinn.
I'm gonna fuckin' kill ya.

815
01:09:34,065 --> 01:09:37,025
Oh good, it's about time
you showed some fuckin' bollocks.

816
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:08,420
Charley! Charley!

817
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,260
It's too late, you can't do anything.

818
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:20,900
It wasn't the Hun killed McNess, 
it was Bradford.

819
01:10:21,899 --> 01:10:23,099
That makes sense...

820
01:10:23,539 --> 01:10:25,419
the Bible basher losing it out here.

821
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:26,938
You don't see it, do ya?

822
01:10:27,538 --> 01:10:29,378
This place is making us kill each other.

823
01:10:30,818 --> 01:10:34,537
There's nothing making me kill you. 

824
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:38,777
Quinn, Quinn, don't do it!
It's wrong, you can't do it.

825
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:42,456
Quinn? Quinn!

826
01:10:43,896 --> 01:10:46,656
Quinn! Don't do it, please!

827
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:48,656
It's a bit late for heroics ain't it?

828
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:56,175
Quinn, there's been enough killing.

829
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:00,134
Not yet, there hasn't.

830
01:11:00,774 --> 01:11:07,173
Quinn... I've got... 
I've got children.

831
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:18,452
No!

832
01:11:21,732 --> 01:11:22,932
You murderer!

833
01:11:24,931 --> 01:11:26,932
You're just a fuckin' animal!

834
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:39,370
Well, go on. Go on.

835
01:11:43,529 --> 01:11:45,209
You haven't got the guts have you?

836
01:11:45,929 --> 01:11:47,009
You're a coward.

837
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:49,489
You left him to die before.

838
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:51,448
Do you think nobody saw you run away?

839
01:11:51,528 --> 01:11:52,928
We all did!

840
01:11:53,648 --> 01:11:55,327
You should be shot!

841
01:11:56,488 --> 01:11:59,448
You should curl up into a little ball...

842
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:01,287
and shrivel up with shame.

843
01:12:01,407 --> 01:12:02,846
At least I'm not a murderer.

844
01:12:02,967 --> 01:12:06,927
That's all we do here.
This war is all murder.

845
01:12:07,607 --> 01:12:08,766
And do you know what?

846
01:12:10,086 --> 01:12:11,126
I love it.

847
01:12:14,006 --> 01:12:15,086
You're a coward.

848
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:52,401
Shoot!

849
01:13:40,795 --> 01:13:41,675
We are goin'.

850
01:13:43,235 --> 01:13:44,714
I'm not gonna leave them behind.

851
01:13:47,074 --> 01:13:50,834
No. No, they're not.

852
01:14:00,153 --> 01:14:04,273
Take this. If I don't come back,
you get out of here.

853
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:21,590
Doc!

854
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:24,430
Doc, where are you?

855
01:14:30,829 --> 01:14:31,949
Hello Chevasse.

856
01:14:33,309 --> 01:14:34,309
What's happening?

857
01:14:38,068 --> 01:14:39,428
I'm gonna get you out of here.

858
01:14:40,628 --> 01:14:45,147
I've had terrible dreams. Terrible.

859
01:14:45,707 --> 01:14:46,867
Where's Doc?

860
01:14:47,187 --> 01:14:48,707
I'm going to go and find him now.

861
01:14:49,347 --> 01:14:50,586
I'll be back very soon.

862
01:14:55,986 --> 01:14:57,146
You can move your legs again?

863
01:14:58,386 --> 01:14:59,546
That's a good sign.

864
01:14:59,826 --> 01:15:00,785
I'm trying.

865
01:15:01,585 --> 01:15:03,225
I'll be back on my feet soon enough.

866
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:10,025
Can I have a little water,
if you don't mind?

867
01:15:11,224 --> 01:15:12,264
Of course.

868
01:15:26,182 --> 01:15:28,902
What's wrong? Charley?

869
01:15:29,022 --> 01:15:29,462
Oh God.

870
01:15:29,582 --> 01:15:30,502
What's wrong?

871
01:15:51,419 --> 01:15:51,859
No!

872
01:15:51,979 --> 01:15:54,979
I'm gonna help you, Chevasse.
I'm gonna get you out of here, I promise.

873
01:15:55,099 --> 01:15:55,939
It's gonna be alright.

874
01:15:56,099 --> 01:15:57,299
It's gonna be alright, just calm down.

875
01:15:57,539 --> 01:15:59,338
Please just calm down. Please.

876
01:15:59,458 --> 01:15:59,938
No!

877
01:16:00,018 --> 01:16:02,018
It's gonna be alright.
Please, please calm down.

878
01:16:02,218 --> 01:16:03,378
No, help me, Charley!

879
01:16:03,498 --> 01:16:06,577
Help me! Help me, Charley.

880
01:16:07,978 --> 01:16:08,937
Help me!

881
01:16:09,017 --> 01:16:09,697
Help me.

882
01:16:10,777 --> 01:16:11,857
I'm sorry, Chevasse.

883
01:16:35,974 --> 01:16:38,774
What are you doing, Bradford?
Why are you doing this?

884
01:16:39,773 --> 01:16:40,734
Is it because of me?

885
01:16:40,974 --> 01:16:43,133
Because I don't believe?
I do believe, I swear to God.

886
01:16:43,253 --> 01:16:43,973
Liar!

887
01:16:49,373 --> 01:16:51,132
Everyone loses it in this war.

888
01:16:51,933 --> 01:16:53,612
It's just what it does to you.

889
01:16:53,812 --> 01:16:57,691
But we're getting it back.
Bradford, we'll get you back.

890
01:16:57,891 --> 01:17:01,331
We'll put you on leave.
We'll sort, well sort you out.

891
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:12,170
Doc!

892
01:17:18,849 --> 01:17:19,929
Think of your faith.

893
01:17:20,728 --> 01:17:24,168
What it means to you. Please.

894
01:17:25,248 --> 01:17:28,728
What about forgiveness,
or redemption, or mercy?

895
01:17:30,487 --> 01:17:33,207
Be not overcome by evil, 
but overcome evil. With good...

896
01:17:33,287 --> 01:17:34,727
Corinthians, chapter twelve.

897
01:17:35,446 --> 01:17:36,887
It's Romans twelve!

898
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:40,966
So your actually gonna kill us all.
Is that it?

899
01:17:41,286 --> 01:17:43,606
Your just gonna blow us all to hell 
and for what?

900
01:17:44,086 --> 01:17:45,166
So what?

901
01:17:52,885 --> 01:17:55,125
There is no victory, Bradford.

902
01:17:55,724 --> 01:17:57,405
Not here, not anymore.

903
01:18:00,683 --> 01:18:03,923
Please, Bradford. 
There's no victory.

904
01:18:05,324 --> 01:18:06,963
You don't win anything.

905
01:18:08,443 --> 01:18:10,323
Shakespeare's coming to save you.

906
01:18:12,043 --> 01:18:14,002
Do you think you deserve to be saved?

907
01:18:16,082 --> 01:18:17,042
I think so.

908
01:18:19,802 --> 01:18:22,801
Oh, thank God. 
Charley... where's Tate?

909
01:18:27,321 --> 01:18:28,121
Don't.

910
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,760
Doc, you're coming with me.

911
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:38,919
Bradford, just... 

912
01:18:39,999 --> 01:18:41,159
Look, you don't want to do this.

913
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,639
I told you you'd have to kill me Charley, 
but you didn't listen.

914
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:44,558
I won't do it.

915
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,398
Yes! You will.

916
01:18:46,518 --> 01:18:47,598
Shoot him!

917
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:49,998
Stop me, Charley. 
I can't fight it anymore.

918
01:18:50,198 --> 01:18:53,318
Bradford please, whatever it is inside you, 
please just fight it.

919
01:18:53,398 --> 01:18:54,117
I can't!

920
01:18:54,197 --> 01:18:55,277
Charley, shoot him!

921
01:18:55,357 --> 01:18:55,918
I won't.

922
01:18:55,998 --> 01:18:56,957
Yes, you will!

923
01:18:57,077 --> 01:18:57,877
You have to!

924
01:18:57,997 --> 01:18:59,196
No more killing.

925
01:18:59,476 --> 01:19:00,877
No, Bradford!

926
01:19:07,596 --> 01:19:08,676
Well done, Charley.
Now get me out of these.

927
01:19:08,756 --> 01:19:09,555
Bradford.

928
01:20:17,228 --> 01:20:17,867
No!

929
01:21:03,782 --> 01:21:05,342
No.

930
01:22:06,935 --> 01:22:08,214
<i>Turn around Charlie.</i>

931
01:22:16,453 --> 01:22:17,493
Who is this?

932
01:22:25,212 --> 01:22:26,132
Shakespeare.

933
01:22:27,092 --> 01:22:28,012
Sargeant?

934
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:38,771
I'm not dead!

935
01:23:26,285 --> 01:23:27,205
I'm not dead!

936
01:23:29,044 --> 01:23:30,125
I'm not dead!

937
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:33,164
I'm not dead!

938
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:12,559
Allemand!

939
01:24:26,757 --> 01:24:27,917
Hey, Allemand?

940
01:24:40,316 --> 01:24:41,236
What are you doing?

941
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:55,234
I saved you.

942
01:25:02,633 --> 01:25:04,033
I tried to help you.

943
01:25:05,513 --> 01:25:06,593
You did Charlie.

944
01:25:08,232 --> 01:25:09,872
Only you tried to save me.

945
01:25:11,672 --> 01:25:12,832
That is why you are free.

946
01:25:21,391 --> 01:25:22,311
What's out there?

947
01:26:46,341 --> 01:26:47,541
Oh, Jesus.

948
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:52,420
Sarge! I've got something over here.

949
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:55,980
Get your hands up. Now!
You German bastard!

950
01:26:56,305 --> 01:27:56,220
