...serve the Lord, rejoicing

3
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:26,537
in the power of his Spirit.

4
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,773
And the blessing
of God Almighty,

5
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:32,643
the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit be upon you

6
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,913
and remain with you all forever.

7
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:36,513
Amen.

8
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:37,749
Amen.

9
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:46,423
Thank you.

10
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:02,740
Mm-hmm.

11
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:13,986
They're coming. Look.

12
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:29,835
If you could all look
this way, please.

13
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:40,511
I have never seen
a wedding like it.

14
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:42,915
It's a bit grander than ours.

15
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:46,384
There you are.

16
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,925
I haven't noticed any
congratulations on your lips.

17
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,193
- Mm.
- Don't tease him.

18
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:55,895
I wish the boy well.

19
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:57,595
- I do.
- Oh.

20
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:00,398
Very smart.

21
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,503
- Ah, Mary.
- Hello.

22
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:07,576
- Darling, have you seen the cake?
- It's beautiful.

23
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:09,641
All smile.

24
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:14,747
It's delightful.

25
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,948
Be careful, children.

26
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:20,618
Oh.

27
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:25,925
Thank you.

28
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:28,526
They're going to live here.

29
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,929
And I'm off to the dower house.

30
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:31,864
The thought of being warm
in winter

31
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:33,232
goes to my head
like strong drink.

32
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:34,900
I can imagine.

33
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:36,802
We're going to cut the cake.

34
00:03:36,835 --> 00:03:39,004
I want to thank you
for allowing me to be so happy.

35
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:41,118
I feel like I've been given
much more than I deserve.

36
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:46,511
Well, that's
an encouraging start.

37
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:53,887
Bravo.

38
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:04,463
Splendid. Size of that cake.

39
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:11,771
- Goodbye.
- Send us a postcard.

40
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:12,949
- Thank you for everything.
- Bye, old boy.

41
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:14,083
- Bye-bye.
- Have a wonderful time.

42
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:15,474
- Have a safe journey.
- We will.

43
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:24,084
Bye.

44
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:26,886
Goodbye.

45
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:29,055
Goodbye.

46
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,996
Congratulations.

47
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:43,602
I've had a letter
from Mr. Murray.

48
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:45,005
He's coming to Down ton
on Tuesday.

49
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:47,007
- What do you want him for?
- Oh, it wasn't me.

50
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,109
It was your grandmother
who summoned him.

51
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:51,543
He'd like us there.

52
00:04:51,577 --> 00:04:53,313
Rosamund, you should be with us.

53
00:04:53,346 --> 00:04:55,782
- Oh, dear.
- Why do you say that?

54
00:04:55,815 --> 00:04:59,585
There's only one reason
old ladies summon their lawyers.

55
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,015
Do sit down.

56
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:31,118
I feel like Andromeda
chained to a rock

57
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:33,087
with you lot hovering over me.

58
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,923
I don't know why
Murray told you to be here

59
00:05:35,956 --> 00:05:37,792
without asking me first.

60
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:39,360
Nor do we.

61
00:05:39,393 --> 00:05:41,028
Ah, Denker.

62
00:05:41,062 --> 00:05:42,662
A Mr. Murray will be here soon.

63
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:44,597
H-He's here now, milady.

64
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:46,801
He... he says
you're expecting him.

65
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:49,003
What? Why didn't you tell me?

66
00:05:49,036 --> 00:05:51,638
You shouldn't be so untrusting.

67
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:57,178
Ah, have you told them,
Lady Grantham? Good.

68
00:05:57,211 --> 00:05:58,711
Please.

69
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,014
She's told us nothing.

70
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:01,949
Well, that's easily done.

71
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:05,753
I've come into possession of
a villa in the south of France.

72
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:09,924
And now I've given it to
my great-granddaughter Sybbie.

73
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:10,991
What?

74
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,660
What bit didn't you understand?

75
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:15,096
I don't understand any of it.

76
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:16,897
What villa? Where?

77
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:19,632
This is too extraordinary
for any words.

78
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,203
It's called La Villa des
Colombes, and it's near Toulon.

79
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:23,938
But why was it yours?

80
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:25,973
And why have you never
said anything about it?

81
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:27,775
Because I thought it was a joke.

82
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:30,744
Start at the beginning.

83
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:35,249
Years ago, before you were born,
I was in France,

84
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:38,953
and I met a man,
the Marquis de Montmirail.

85
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:41,155
And he invited me
to spend some time

86
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:43,858
at a villa he'd just bought.

87
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:46,160
A year or so later,
he wrote to me

88
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:51,265
and said he'd transferred
the villa into my name.

89
00:06:51,298 --> 00:06:54,869
I never thought he was serious,
so I didn't pay any attention.

90
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:57,805
- But it wasn't a joke?
- It seems not.

91
00:06:57,838 --> 00:07:00,876
He died recently,
and to his widow's alarm,

92
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:03,278
the villa they've been using
every winter for years

93
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:06,047
was registered to Lady Grantham.

94
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,782
He never changed it.

95
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,851
- Now, I'll need some signatures.
- Oh, yes.

96
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:11,887
Why have you given it to Sybbie?

97
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,022
Your children
are well set up here,

98
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:16,224
and Edith's are more
than taken care of,

99
00:07:16,258 --> 00:07:20,795
but Brompton will go
to a child of Tom and Lucy's.

100
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:23,832
So darling Sybil's only daughter
will inherit little,

101
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,967
and I wanted to correct that.

102
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:30,138
What family did he have, uh,
this M-Montmirail chap?

103
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:33,275
The widow and a son,
the present marquis.

104
00:07:33,308 --> 00:07:36,811
The mother is keen they should
take the matter to court.

105
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:38,156
- Well, you can't blame her.
- Why?

106
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,282
If her husband
wanted me to have the place,

107
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:41,883
who are we to argue?

108
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:43,852
You never thought
to turn it down?

109
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:48,689
Do I look as if I'd turn down
a villa in the south of France?

110
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,093
Mr. Murray?

111
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:56,298
- May I ask a favor?
- Please.

112
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:58,200
I have a task for you.

113
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:00,068
It's all explained
in this letter.

114
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:02,013
I'll telephone in a few days
in case there are questions.

115
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:03,805
Of course, Lady Grantham.

116
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:06,308
- Now, I hear my train calling.
- Goodbye, Mr. Murray.

117
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:07,976
And thank you.

118
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:13,348
<i>You want me to tell you</i>

119
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:17,118
why he did it when the truth is

120
00:08:17,152 --> 00:08:19,120
I do not know.

121
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:22,891
And with that,
I will say good night

122
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:26,962
and leave you to discuss
my mysterious past.

123
00:08:26,995 --> 00:08:30,198
Now, Denker, don't steer me.

124
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:32,867
I'm not a racing car.

125
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,803
More's the pity.

126
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:37,073
I beg your pardon.

127
00:08:37,106 --> 00:08:38,241
You really must try...

128
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:39,976
It does seem odd.

129
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:42,278
They spend a few days together
in the same resort

130
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:46,082
more than 60 years ago,
and he gives her a house.

131
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:47,550
I suppose he wasn't
just a lunatic.

132
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,352
Well, that's what
they'll try to prove.

133
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:52,221
Well, I think it's marvelous of
Granny to take care of Sybbie.

134
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:55,024
Even if Monsieur de Montmirail
was as mad as a rat.

135
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:56,792
But why did Mama
never say a word?

136
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:58,036
As far as she's concerned,

137
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,162
she received
a very eccentric letter

138
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:02,031
more than half a century ago,

139
00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:04,133
she considered it potty
at the time

140
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,269
and never gave it
another thought.

141
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:09,138
Well done, Marigold.

142
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:14,353
That's right. Good shot.

143
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:15,878
You stand back.

144
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:19,282
Nanny, watch.

145
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:22,018
A telephone call
for you, milord.

146
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:23,919
- Who is it?
- Uh, a Mr. Barber.

147
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:25,964
- Says he's from British Lion.
- What's that?

148
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:28,057
It's a film company, isn't it?

149
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,326
I better find out what he wants.

150
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:33,939
What will they do with the villa
in the summer?

151
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,865
They can't let it.
Nobody goes there then.

152
00:09:35,898 --> 00:09:38,067
- Oh, they do now.
- Well, surely it's too hot.

153
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,201
Apparently not.

154
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:40,312
- Mummy!
- Hello, darling.

155
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:41,370
Mummy, come and play!

156
00:09:42,938 --> 00:09:45,041
MARIGOLD
It's a race. Come on. Quickly.

157
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:55,284
Mr. Barber turns out to be
a producer and director.

158
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:58,020
He wanted to practice
chronophotography here.

159
00:09:58,054 --> 00:10:00,022
It's not the Stone Age, Papa.

160
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:02,191
You mean he wants
to make a film at Down ton?

161
00:10:02,224 --> 00:10:03,926
What did you say?

162
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,128
- I let him down gently.
- Then I'll ring him back.

163
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:07,472
I want to hear
what he has to offer.

164
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:09,065
What's the point?

165
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:10,208
Well, I suppose
there'd be a fee.

166
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:11,476
When does Henry get home?

167
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,935
Not in time for this.

168
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:14,304
Where is he now?

169
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:17,341
His last message
was from Istanbul or somewhere.

170
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:18,909
But as far as I'm concerned,

171
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:20,219
the whole idea
of a rally is barmy.

172
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:21,387
You can manage it without him.

173
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:23,146
I see.
So it's down to me, is it?

174
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,249
You can't expect us
to deal with kinema people.

175
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:28,085
First, let's just listen
to his proposal.

176
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:29,228
- Hmm.
- Come along, Mary.

177
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:30,454
I'll keep you company.

178
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:31,988
The money would be useful,
surely.

179
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,991
Is everything
all right with Henry?

180
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:38,061
He's in love with cars.

181
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,231
He's in love with speed.
He's in love with adventure.

182
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:43,467
He's also in love with me,
I think.

183
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,136
But I don't seem to cancel out
the other three.

184
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:47,671
And you thought you would?

185
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:49,339
I suppose I did.

186
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:50,907
Ready for you.

187
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:09,092
It's perfect.

188
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:11,528
Until recently, film making was

189
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:13,230
largely confined to the studios,

190
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:15,399
but now the process
has opened up.

191
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:18,068
Abel Gance's <i>Napoléon</i> last year

192
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:20,137
showed what a camera can do
on location,

193
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,005
filming in real houses,
real landscapes.

194
00:11:22,038 --> 00:11:23,974
What sort of film is it?

195
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:26,343
<i>The Gambler</i> is set in 1875.

196
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:29,146
Uh, an earl's daughter,
Lady Anne Erskine,

197
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:32,048
falls in love with a man
who turns out to be a gambler,

198
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:33,183
to her family's horror.

199
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:34,518
I can imagine.

200
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:36,129
They meet at a house party
in the country,

201
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,330
and things soon
spin out of control.

202
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:40,090
There are visits
to a smart gambling club,

203
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:41,224
which we'd do here.

204
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:43,160
A gambling club at Down ton?

205
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:44,494
That would finish Granny off.

206
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:46,329
And Papa, too.

207
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:48,965
- We must have time to think.
- Of course.

208
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,568
Here's my card.

209
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:53,137
- Mm-hmm.
- Ring me if you have any questions at all.

210
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,740
I'll get Barrow to see you out.

211
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:57,008
I suppose there are two
questions that we would need

212
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,544
the answer to before we can
really have the discussion.

213
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:01,446
Uh, we'd be here
for about a month,

214
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:04,515
and if you turn the card over,
you'll see what we'd pay.

215
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:07,218
Of course, that's negotiable.

216
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:09,353
- Goodbye, Mr. Barber.
- Goodbye.

217
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:17,595
And that's the starting point?

218
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,567
<i>I think it's a horrible idea.</i>

219
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,772
Actresses plastered in makeup
and actors just plastered,

220
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:28,372
scrambling over our things.

221
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:31,275
We'd have to keep counting
the spoons in the pantry.

222
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:33,010
The locals might take
a dim view.

223
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,780
Well, you mustn't
let that stop you.

224
00:12:34,813 --> 00:12:36,581
The county takes
a dim view of everything.

225
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:38,316
You have to consider the fee.

226
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:40,117
We don't need
to talk about money.

227
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:42,019
Oh, but you need
to think about it.

228
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,564
You could have a new roof,
for a start.

229
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:45,466
You could soon be looking at
real flooding, and then what?

230
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,534
If you turn them down, do you
think we could persuade them

231
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,160
to drive further north
to Brancaster?

232
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:53,364
Mama, where do you stand?

233
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,634
Mary, dear, will you take
your father to see the attics?

234
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,437
I don't think he's been there
for quite a while.

235
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:12,550
I haven't been up here
for years.

236
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,353
Well, this is the situation
we're in.

237
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:17,622
With the money, we can bring
the house up to snuff,

238
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:20,057
to match what we've spent
on the estate

239
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,627
and enter the 1930s
with our heads held high.

240
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,263
- But if you don't want to...
- No.

241
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:29,501
No, you steer ahead.

242
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:32,304
You're the captain now.

243
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:35,307
I am aware of that,
even if you think I'm not.

244
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:39,611
And now I have
the unenviable task

245
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:42,147
of breaking the news
to Mr. Carson.

246
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,348
I can't believe it.

247
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:45,450
To make a film here?
Can they do that?

248
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:47,286
Would there be film stars?
Famous ones?

249
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:50,122
Oh, give her some water
before she passes out.

250
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:51,456
Nothing's decided yet.

251
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,667
It's all very fine
to get excited.

252
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:54,293
You live at the farm.

253
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:56,161
The rest of us
will have them in and out

254
00:13:56,194 --> 00:13:58,564
and round about
every hour God sends.

255
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:00,165
And what of Her Ladyship?

256
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:02,301
- Hoping for a peaceful end...
- Mm.

257
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:05,504
...and suddenly plunged into
a three-ring circus.

258
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:06,638
Well, I agree with Daisy.

259
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:08,340
We'll get to know men and women

260
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:10,142
we've only seen
upon the silver screen.

261
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,887
- And if it's good for the house...
- This is the point.

262
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:13,454
An injection of cash
could make all the difference.

263
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,280
They mention how much?

264
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,282
It's not our business
if they did.

265
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,251
- They did not.
- Well, good night.

266
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:20,695
- Good night. - Good night.
- Good night, Mrs. Hughes.

267
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:24,156
Still, times change
and we must change with them.

268
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:26,325
Mrs. Parker.
We should be getting home, too.

269
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:28,360
Very good, Mr. Parker.
I'm coming.

270
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:33,900
Daisy's more obedient with him
than she ever was with me.

271
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,601
Maybe he makes her happier.

272
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:38,103
Well, I did me best.

273
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:42,608
<i>A moving picture?</i>

274
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:44,309
At Down ton?

275
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,311
I know it sounds unlikely,

276
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:49,749
but I'm not sure
it's quite as awful as that.

277
00:14:49,782 --> 00:14:51,350
I disagree.

278
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:54,353
Rough and vulgar actors
and actresses

279
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:57,155
strolling through the rooms
with their sticky fingers,

280
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,624
sitting on the chairs,

281
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:01,426
eating at the table where
the King of England once sat?

282
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,764
Oh, this smacks of
the worst excesses

283
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:06,265
of the French Revolution.

284
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,234
Should we ask them
to stay standing

285
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:09,402
and put them in gloves?

286
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:11,371
This is a comedown, Elsie.

287
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:12,705
This is a falling-off.

288
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,174
They are flirting with mob rule.

289
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,745
But it will pay, Charlie,
and they need the money.

290
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:20,781
Oh, by that argument, why not
open the place to the public

291
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:23,650
and have them poke and pry
in every corner?

292
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:25,385
We tried that once,

293
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:28,421
and I thought we'd all decided
never again.

294
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,559
You carry on like that, you'll
give yourself a heart attack.

295
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:36,663
I'd be better off out of it
if this is what we've come to.

296
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:44,370
Hmm.

297
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:48,675
Andy, I wonder if you might

298
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,786
fold that newspaper properly?

299
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,411
I'll take it upstairs with me.

300
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:53,312
Course.

301
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:56,549
So, moving picture
to be made at the big house.

302
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,618
What will that mean
for the pair of you?

303
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:01,554
- Can't say exactly.
- But it'll be exciting.

304
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:04,557
Seeing how a film's made,
meeting the stars.

305
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,693
I'd keep clear of them
if I were you.

306
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:07,828
Keep clear of all of it.

307
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:09,797
I'll say good night, then.

308
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,398
- Good night.
- Night.

309
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,538
Forgot the paper after all that.

310
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,474
Memory like a sieve.

311
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:24,343
Night.

312
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,581
Remember,
it's his farm, not ours.

313
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:30,683
It's Lord Grantham's farm,
and he's only the tenant.

314
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,285
Maybe.

315
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:33,495
But don't say anything
you'll regret.

316
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,022
That's the problem.

317
00:16:35,055 --> 00:16:38,324
I'm bound to in the end,
and then where will we be?

318
00:16:38,357 --> 00:16:40,661
Murray's had
the will translated.

319
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:45,432
Apparently, Montmirail refers
to an idyllic interlude

320
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:48,737
he spent with Mama as a young
man before he was married.

321
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,571
What else did Murray
have to say?

322
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:51,773
Why, it's odd.

323
00:16:51,806 --> 00:16:53,640
The widow wants
to fight the will,

324
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:56,477
but the son believes it can be
settled in a friendly way.

325
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,346
I'd cover the villa with barbed
wire and board up the windows.

326
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:01,682
He says he'd like us
to visit him there.

327
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:03,350
Now, clearly Mama can't travel,

328
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:05,452
but he asked us to bring
Tom and Lucy with us

329
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:07,621
now that he knows
Sybbie is to be the beneficiary.

330
00:17:07,654 --> 00:17:08,857
What do you think?

331
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,558
Well, we could
get to know Lucy better.

332
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:13,293
And with any luck, it would mean

333
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:15,662
we'd miss the whole
of Mary's frightful film.

334
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:18,565
I found it. Myrna Dalgleish.

335
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,634
I knew I had a good one of her.

336
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,636
Her beauty is so classic.

337
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:24,571
I've got one of him.

338
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:27,641
Guy Dexter in <i>Casanova.</i>

339
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:28,853
The very thought of it
makes me blush.

340
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:30,544
There is something about him.

341
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:31,856
Like a wild animal
ready to spring.

342
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,447
Ready to spring on you,
you mean.

343
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,315
That's enough.

344
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:36,626
You'll have Andy and me jealous
if you don't watch out.

345
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,787
Oh, I like the sound of that.

346
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:43,490
I hate that you'll miss
all the fun.

347
00:17:43,524 --> 00:17:46,728
I'm nervous now, leaving you
alone with Guy Dexter.

348
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:49,630
The chance would be
a fine thing.

349
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:52,699
- What do you think, Bertie?
- A complication.

350
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:54,736
Tom says they'd have to bring
Maud Bagshaw.

351
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,805
She's living with them
until her house is ready.

352
00:17:56,838 --> 00:17:59,373
We can all stay in an hotel.

353
00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:01,375
In that case, can we come?

354
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:02,576
I'd love it.

355
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:03,677
We wouldn't be in the way?

356
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,479
So everyone's going except me?

357
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:06,815
And me.

358
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:08,558
I've been thinking about
an article on the people

359
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:10,426
who visit the south of France
in the summer now.

360
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,352
Are you writing again?
I'm pleased.

361
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:15,455
Edith's back at the magazine
for a couple of days a week.

362
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:16,691
And little Peter?

363
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:18,693
Has a wonderful nanny,
thank heavens.

364
00:18:18,726 --> 00:18:20,763
Can you really work
with two young children

365
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:22,798
while running a house
like Brancaster?

366
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:25,433
Ask me in six months' time.

367
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:26,644
Well, I'm glad to hear
you're doing something

368
00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:27,837
with your brain again.

369
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,537
Well, let's hope
it's still there.

370
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:30,749
I'll telephone
Montmirail tomorrow

371
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:32,908
and explain
we'll be in an hotel.

372
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:34,676
I should think
he'll be relieved.

373
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:38,379
Come in.

374
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:41,917
I saw the light was still on.

375
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:46,387
I suppose you agree with Papa
that the whole idea of a film

376
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:48,590
is too common
to even be considered.

377
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:50,159
Nothing is too common

378
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:52,761
if it will help
to keep Down ton afloat.

379
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:54,797
Well, we'd have enough money
for a new roof.

380
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,766
At the cost
of one terrible month.

381
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,635
Honestly, I do think
it will be pretty terrible.

382
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:02,905
But the sight of old washbasins
catching rainwater

383
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:05,174
in the attics is terrible, too.

384
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,743
We got through the war.
We can get through this.

385
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:10,545
But you must be firm, Mary.

386
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:14,750
To those people, women like us
fall into two categories:

387
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:17,485
dragons and fools.

388
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:20,756
You must make sure
they think of you as a dragon.

389
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:28,696
<i>Mr. Bates and Miss Baxter</i>

390
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:30,665
<i>will go to look after
Lord and Lady Grantham.</i>

391
00:19:30,698 --> 00:19:33,668
The rest will stay at Down ton
to help with the film people.

392
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:35,603
You'll get no help from me.

393
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:37,740
In contrast to
Miss Won't-Lift-a-Finger,

394
00:19:37,773 --> 00:19:39,707
I'd love to help.

395
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:41,810
Could I be
Miss Dalgleish's lady's maid?

396
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:44,013
I've asked Anna to take that on.

397
00:19:44,046 --> 00:19:46,048
I don't want to be
a spoilsport, Daisy,

398
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:47,950
but you do have a job down here.

399
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:50,618
We know Miss Dalgleish
is staying in the house?

400
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:52,030
She is, with the director
and the leading man.

401
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:54,858
The rest are going to put up
in the village.

402
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:57,726
Now, I need to go
and see Lady Mary.

403
00:19:57,761 --> 00:19:59,662
Oh, don't worry, Daisy.

404
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:01,630
Anna will find a way
to get you in there.

405
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:04,500
Well, I'd exchange it all for
a trip to the south of France.

406
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:05,969
Daisy?

407
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:10,639
He's opposed, I'm afraid,
milady, and says he must

408
00:20:10,673 --> 00:20:13,877
stand watch
and keep them in check.

409
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,812
I don't know how helpful
that will be.

410
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:18,815
We've got to get rid of him.

411
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:20,582
But how?

412
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,895
I should travel to France

413
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,254
with the rest of the party?

414
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:25,822
Really?

415
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:27,565
She worries
that everything will be

416
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:29,993
odd and foreign
for His Lordship.

417
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:32,594
And neither Mr. Bates
nor Miss Baxter

418
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:35,031
will have the authority to make
sure it's all done properly.

419
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:36,733
Yes. I see.

420
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:38,969
His Lordship needs you, Charlie.

421
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:41,838
Only you can show them
how things should be managed.

422
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:43,106
Don't you worry about that.

423
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,574
They'd better be warned.

424
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:46,810
The British are coming.

425
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:49,112
But what would I do with him?

426
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:51,781
And wouldn't it be rather an
imposition on the Montmirails?

427
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:55,051
He longs to be useful to you,
Papa, as he always did.

428
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:56,996
Couldn't you give him
the feeling that he'd help you

429
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,922
just by being there?

430
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:02,993
I will if you insist, but it
seems very sentimental to me.

431
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:06,695
Hold it right there.

432
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,732
Right, you lot, go behind him.

433
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:13,702
You two, come on, pull along.

434
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:15,114
- Follow the wardrobe mistress.
- Pass me those.

435
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:16,818
- She'll show you where to go.
- Thank you.

436
00:21:18,174 --> 00:21:20,043
- No, that's private.
- Oh, I see.

437
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:22,644
- This way.
- Here they are.

438
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:26,850
Excuse me, gentlemen.

439
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:33,623
Yes, please. That's it.

440
00:21:33,656 --> 00:21:34,992
You're an angel.

441
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:03,988
Hello, Mr. Molesley.
Why are you here?

442
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:06,057
You know I love anything
to do with films.

443
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,801
Well, I know you enjoy
a trip to the pictures.

444
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,592
Oh, no, it's more than that.

445
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:12,863
For me, Hollywood is
the ultimate dream factory.

446
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:14,932
And I need dreams
as much as the next man.

447
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,667
Mm.

448
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,669
All this for one woman.

449
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:22,206
I give you
Miss Dalgleish's wardrobe.

450
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:25,042
I know, but just fancy.

451
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:31,982
No, do it properly.

452
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:46,797
Sorry.

453
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:47,731
Nice and steady, lads.
Keep it moving.

454
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:49,767
Keep it just over there.

455
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,634
- Thank you very much.
- Right you are.

456
00:22:51,668 --> 00:22:53,737
Watch your footing.

457
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:56,807
Oh, you're all here,
hiding from the invaders.

458
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:57,942
Sybbie!

459
00:22:57,975 --> 00:22:59,410
Hello, darling.

460
00:22:59,443 --> 00:23:01,254
- What a lovely surprise.
- Tom had her driven

461
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:03,023
so she could be with her cousins
while we're in France.

462
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:04,982
Oh, we've been
talking about you.

463
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,718
About me, Donk? Why?

464
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:09,720
Any number of reasons, all good.

465
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:10,922
May I present Miss Dalgleish.

466
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,924
My father, Lord Grantham.

467
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,860
She is one of the stars
of our film.

468
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,128
I can easily believe it.

469
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,063
Welcome to Down ton,
Miss Dalgleish.

470
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:20,932
Mm.

471
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:26,938
The modern world
comes to Down ton.

472
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,950
You've told our host in France
that we're staying at an hotel?

473
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,442
Oh, he wouldn't hear of it.

474
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,177
He insists we stay at the villa.

475
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,012
Even though we're there
to steal it from them?

476
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,923
He seems a very nice chap,
and his English is flawless,

477
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,283
which is more than can be said
for my French.

478
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,051
Mr. Guy Dexter.

479
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:43,255
Welcome, Mr. Dexter.

480
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,823
I'm Lord Grantham.

481
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,858
This is my daughter,
Lady Mary Talbot.

482
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,160
She'll look after you,

483
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,162
as the rest of us
are off to the Riviera.

484
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,696
But I hope
you'll enjoy yourself here.

485
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,166
I'd come with you if I could.

486
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,301
- You're English?
- Yes.

487
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,837
I went over to America
ten years ago to try my luck,

488
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,047
and I've been there ever since.

489
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,773
- Hmm.
- I'm not the only one.

490
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,241
They call us the Hollywood Raj,

491
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,777
and we all play cricket
once a week.

492
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,321
And the weather
never stops play.

493
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,047
Do you know the south of France?

494
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,925
Last time I was there,
I was marooned on the roof

495
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,218
of the Negresco with Ronald
Colman and Gloria Swanson.

496
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,886
On the roof?

497
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,330
You can tell us the rest
of that story at dinner.

498
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,156
- When are you leaving?
- Tomorrow.

499
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,126
Uh, Dover, Calais and then
the Blue Train down to Nice.

500
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,061
How enviable that sounds.

501
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,896
When do you expect
your director?

502
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,098
Oh, he'll be here for dinner.
Don't you think, Myrna?

503
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,134
How should I know?

504
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,974
Myrna Dalgleish in this house.

505
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,876
It seems incredible.

506
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,144
Her dad sold fruit

507
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,912
in the old Borough Market.
Now look at her.

508
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,782
A goddess of the screen.

509
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,850
And you're going to be her maid.

510
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,352
She's brought
a mountain of luggage,

511
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,821
so I thought you and Anna
could go together right now

512
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,756
and offer to unpack.

513
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,534
Just remember,
neither of you know this woman.

514
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,362
She may not be the film star
you see in the fan magazines.

515
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:59,298
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

516
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,139
Thank you.

517
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,910
The Lady Grantham.

518
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,345
I'm sorry to burst in on you.

519
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,913
Not at all.

520
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,224
The fact is
I've made a new will,

521
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:17,216
and I need you both
to witness my signature.

522
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,918
I'm just fussing.

523
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,786
It's only my jewelry
and a few other pieces.

524
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,060
It's always a good idea to
bring these things up to date.

525
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,557
Murray was down anyway,

526
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,959
so I thought I would
take advantage of that.

527
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:29,862
I'm glad you've come,
because I wanted to tell you

528
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,964
that Violet has asked us
to go through her things.

529
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:33,966
What? Why has she asked you?

530
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,569
I really don't know, but,
of course, anything of interest

531
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:39,338
will be referred
to Robert and you.

532
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,307
I just thought
you ought to be told.

533
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,143
Well, she wants her death to be
ordered and free of bother.

534
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,978
It's all
very Violet-like, really.

535
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:48,180
- Are we wrong to go to France?
- Oh, certainly not.

536
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:50,816
Mary can send a telegram

537
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,219
if there are
any dark developments.

538
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,154
But there won't be.

539
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,290
I don't pretend I've always
worshipped at her shrine,

540
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,025
but it will be strange.

541
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,960
And Mary will miss her
when she's gone.

542
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,428
Mary will become her,

543
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,897
so the gap will be filled.

544
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,198
And now I must run.

545
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,034
I'm making dinner late
by being here.

546
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,971
I'll see you when we get back.

547
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,406
Yes, of course.

548
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,876
She's right.
It will be strange.

549
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,914
I shall miss having a sparring
partner to keep me trim.

550
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:24,117
Be careful how you handle
them clothes.

551
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:26,053
They're haute couture.

552
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,922
I should go to Lady Mary and
Lady Hexham to help them dress,

553
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:30,433
so I'll leave Daisy
with the unpacking.

554
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:32,192
I'll be back
when you're at dinner.

555
00:26:32,225 --> 00:26:33,860
So long as it's finished

556
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,414
and the trunks are gone
when I come up.

557
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,035
What were you doing
on the roof of the Negresco?

558
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:44,213
Oh, it was a scavenger hunt,
and we needed a chimney pot.

559
00:26:44,237 --> 00:26:47,007
But when we got up there,
they were huge,

560
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,318
so we smashed one
and all took a piece.

561
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:51,411
Oh, was the manager pleased?

562
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:53,080
Well, it was good publicity.

563
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:55,215
Is there such a thing
as good publicity?

564
00:26:55,248 --> 00:26:57,317
There is
if you're in the movies.

565
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:59,953
Well, I suppose the Russians
smash their glasses

566
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,355
for good luck.

567
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:04,157
And now film people
smash other people's property

568
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:06,326
for good publicity.

569
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,328
Is this true, Miss Dalgleish?

570
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:10,230
Oh, I don't do nothing
unless I feel like it.

571
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:12,032
Oh, how musical
you make it sound.

572
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,235
Hold the plate nearer.

573
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:19,139
How did you become
a film actress?

574
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:21,241
A talent scout spotted me.

575
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:23,443
Because I'm so beautiful.

576
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:26,380
It seems wonderfully romantic.

577
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:27,457
Well, it's not that romantic.

578
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,116
Not when you know that every man

579
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:31,017
in the room
just wants to give you one.

580
00:27:32,552 --> 00:27:35,389
What a colorful life you lead.

581
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,126
H-Have you made
many kinematographs

582
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,394
traveling around the country?

583
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:42,262
I'm afraid I'm rather glad
to be missing it.

584
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:43,940
Well, I know you're only
doing it for the money,

585
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:45,098
but that's all right.

586
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,937
What I never understand is how
you remember all those lines.

587
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:52,305
Well, it's not theater.

588
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,475
In fact, I'm not even sure
it's proper acting.

589
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:56,010
Oh, but isn't that
about to change?

590
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,945
Aren't films starting to talk?

591
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:00,391
Couple of words here or there.
Nothing to frighten the horses.

592
00:28:00,415 --> 00:28:02,150
Says who?

593
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:03,951
Get me a crème de men the.

594
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,289
Would it be possible
to remind Miss Dalgleish

595
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:10,391
that the servants work hard
in this house

596
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:12,026
and they are doing their best?

597
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,361
They're not used to rudeness.

598
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:15,163
Well, she's not
used to criticism.

599
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:17,432
Her face on the screen
sells a million tickets,

600
00:28:17,465 --> 00:28:19,567
- and she knows it.
- Cheers.

601
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,335
I see.

602
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:29,310
Well, I got my
first picture when I was 20.

603
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:33,414
Thank you.

604
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:38,152
I'm the butler, sir.

605
00:28:38,186 --> 00:28:39,563
Please tell me
if there's anything you need.

606
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:41,322
Anything I need?

607
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:42,957
Seems rather a tall order.

608
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:47,228
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm teasing you.

609
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:51,165
What I should've said was
I have everything I need.

610
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,400
Thank you so much.

611
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:54,469
Very good, sir.

612
00:28:57,104 --> 00:29:01,209
Oh, put that guidebook down,
Charlie, and go to sleep.

613
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:03,311
Mm, let me finish the chapter.

614
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:11,219
You won't believe
what these people eat.

615
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:23,064
Sorry.

616
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:26,167
- Come on, Carson.
- Coming through.

617
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,370
Let's run for it
before things get any worse.

618
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:32,107
I hope you've got
a Mediterranean version

619
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,042
of that outfit, or you'll boil.

620
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:35,244
Don't worry about me, milord.

621
00:29:35,277 --> 00:29:36,612
Hmm.

622
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:40,291
And you're going
to be good, aren't you?

623
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:41,517
Goodbye, Papa.

624
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,352
- Look after Teo.
- Of course.

625
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:45,396
Now, have a lovely time,
no matter what they're like.

626
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,089
Yeah. We'll do our best.

627
00:29:47,122 --> 00:29:50,225
Now, don't get into any scrapes.

628
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:52,227
I have found,
when dealing with foreigners,

629
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:56,632
if one speaks loudly and slowly,
they'll bend to your will.

630
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:59,134
Not too loudly
and not too slowly.

631
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:01,303
Uh, no, no, Andrew.
Andrew. No, no.

632
00:30:01,336 --> 00:30:03,372
Thank you, Bates.

633
00:30:04,874 --> 00:30:07,142
- Ah.
- We've come to wish you luck.

634
00:30:07,175 --> 00:30:08,544
Well, you only just caught us,

635
00:30:08,577 --> 00:30:10,546
as we set off
on our strange mission.

636
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:16,351
Well.

637
00:30:16,385 --> 00:30:18,420
I'm sorry
you'll miss the filming.

638
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:20,188
Will you watch it
while we're away?

639
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:22,090
I will if they let me.

640
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:24,226
Try and enjoy yourself.

641
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,295
No need to say the same to you.

642
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:28,306
Please make sure that
Johnnie keeps his nose clean.

643
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,098
It will be done, sir.

644
00:30:36,271 --> 00:30:40,175
Everyone aboard
or we'll miss the train.

645
00:30:46,315 --> 00:30:47,726
Don't think I've ever seen

646
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,185
so many lovely-looking ladies.

647
00:30:50,218 --> 00:30:52,187
Cup of tea for Miss Dalgleish.

648
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,656
I've just made some.
Daisy can take it up.

649
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,259
Oh, I'll do that. I want to.

650
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:59,227
No, let me. Please.

651
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:01,229
Lady Mary won't mind.
I'm begging you.

652
00:31:01,263 --> 00:31:02,464
Steady on, Daisy.

653
00:31:02,497 --> 00:31:03,817
Uh, but I'll fetch
the tray after.

654
00:31:19,515 --> 00:31:21,451
This is for you, Miss Dalgleish.

655
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:23,586
I never got chance to say
how exciting it is

656
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,421
that you're here.

657
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:26,924
I love your pictures.

658
00:31:26,957 --> 00:31:29,392
You've been such an inspiration
to me.

659
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:31,194
Since I first saw
<i>Star-Crossed...</i>

660
00:31:31,227 --> 00:31:33,267
- Can we get a move on?
- Right away.

661
00:31:33,296 --> 00:31:35,398
Positions, everyone.

662
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:38,434
She's the actress?

663
00:31:38,468 --> 00:31:40,670
Roll the camera.

664
00:31:40,703 --> 00:31:42,940
Harry.

665
00:31:42,973 --> 00:31:45,642
And action!

666
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:48,378
You walk downstairs

667
00:31:48,411 --> 00:31:50,246
and find him with your eyes.

668
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,682
You halt and walk on.

669
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:54,651
But he's waiting for you.

670
00:31:54,684 --> 00:31:56,653
Tell her she looks beautiful.

671
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:00,590
You're delighted to hear it,
but you cannot admit it.

672
00:32:03,827 --> 00:32:05,963
You look into his eyes.

673
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:07,397
Will you let him kiss you?

674
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,631
It feels as if you might.

675
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:11,300
Wait! Wait! Who's he?

676
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:12,378
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

677
00:32:12,402 --> 00:32:13,636
So... I'm ever so sorry.

678
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,438
Wait, I-I can't work like this.

679
00:32:15,471 --> 00:32:16,706
Oh, it's Molesley.

680
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,307
He's a great favorite here.

681
00:32:18,341 --> 00:32:19,743
You don't mind him watching,
do you?

682
00:32:19,777 --> 00:32:21,377
I'm sure they don't mind
him watching.

683
00:32:21,411 --> 00:32:22,722
- They just don't want him in it.
- Oh.

684
00:32:22,746 --> 00:32:24,347
No. Well spotted.

685
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,783
So now you just do it all again?

686
00:32:25,816 --> 00:32:27,350
- Exactly.
- Oh.

687
00:32:27,383 --> 00:32:30,186
I'd rather earn my living
down a mine.

688
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:32,588
- First positions please.
- Oh.

689
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:33,824
Roll the camera.

690
00:32:33,857 --> 00:32:35,224
Harry.

691
00:32:37,326 --> 00:32:38,628
And action!

692
00:32:38,661 --> 00:32:40,339
- As if he did that again.
- Coming down the stairs,

693
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:42,243
not expecting to find him there
waiting for you.

694
00:32:48,572 --> 00:32:50,550
If I'd known we were all going
to be staying at the villa,

695
00:32:50,574 --> 00:32:53,011
- I'm not sure I'd have come.
- Why not?

696
00:32:53,044 --> 00:32:55,345
You don't think it might be
a little awkward?

697
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:57,581
When we've appropriated
this family's home?

698
00:32:57,614 --> 00:33:00,018
I'm not sure that's
the sensible way to look at it.

699
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:02,619
I'm just glad Sybbie will be
on much more equal terms

700
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:04,455
with her cousins.

701
00:33:04,488 --> 00:33:06,566
Violet is giving
your child a great opportunity,

702
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,293
a real start in life.

703
00:33:10,095 --> 00:33:11,796
Does her generosity
surprise you?

704
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,498
Attila the Hun loved his family.

705
00:33:20,772 --> 00:33:23,273
You all right, Mr. Carson?

706
00:33:23,307 --> 00:33:24,651
"All right"
is not the first phrase

707
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:26,610
that springs to mind.

708
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:28,483
I've brought you
some chicken soup, Mr. Carson.

709
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:52,469
I think she sounds very rude.

710
00:33:52,503 --> 00:33:54,571
I expect she's done in.

711
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:56,817
Well, it must be difficult when
the whole film depends on you.

712
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:58,743
It depends on Mr. Dexter, too,

713
00:33:58,777 --> 00:34:00,644
and he seems very well-mannered.

714
00:34:00,677 --> 00:34:02,546
And so attractive.

715
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:04,082
Oi, oi.
Are you up to something?

716
00:34:04,115 --> 00:34:05,917
If I were, would I tell you?

717
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:08,820
Mr. Molesley's in the film now.

718
00:34:08,853 --> 00:34:10,855
I wasn't sure where to stand.

719
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:13,624
Why don't we let the film
people get on with their work

720
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:15,492
while we get on with ours.

721
00:34:15,526 --> 00:34:16,937
Listen to him, Daisy,
before you run away

722
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:19,563
to join the circus.

723
00:35:16,588 --> 00:35:18,690
I say, how are we all?
How did we all survive?

724
00:35:18,723 --> 00:35:19,835
- All right?
- Yes.

725
00:35:22,627 --> 00:35:24,830
- Well, shall we?
- Oh, the color of the sea.

726
00:35:24,864 --> 00:35:26,397
Ah.

727
00:35:30,803 --> 00:35:32,570
Monsieur de Montmirail?

728
00:35:32,604 --> 00:35:35,406
Lord Grantham. <i>Bienvenu.</i>

729
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,942
Well, we've become
quite a party.

730
00:35:36,976 --> 00:35:38,643
I'm afraid we've even
brought our butler.

731
00:35:38,676 --> 00:35:39,745
I'm not quite sure why.

732
00:35:39,778 --> 00:35:40,946
But how chic.

733
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,948
Now, come in, everybody.

734
00:35:42,982 --> 00:35:44,625
- Come on.
- Just going to feel like I need a drink.

735
00:35:44,649 --> 00:35:46,819
And I could do with a sit-down.

736
00:35:46,852 --> 00:35:49,554
I can imagine.

737
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:53,959
Welcome.

738
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:56,494
<i>Merci.</i>

739
00:35:59,698 --> 00:36:01,467
<i>Ma man.</i>

740
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,837
May I present Lord Grantham.

741
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,638
My mother.
La Marquise de Montmirail.

742
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:07,040
Madame.

743
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:09,009
Uh, this is Lady Grantham,
Lord and Lady Hexham,

744
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,510
Lady Bagshaw
and Mr. and Mrs. Branson.

745
00:36:11,543 --> 00:36:12,955
Ah, Monsieur Branson,

746
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:14,647
father of the lucky child.

747
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,649
How happy you must be.

748
00:36:16,682 --> 00:36:18,919
My wife and I
are very glad to be here.

749
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:21,855
I must say straightaway how
kind you are to include us all.

750
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,555
We're delighted, Lord Hexham.

751
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:25,225
Aren't we, <i>maman?</i>

752
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:26,659
Delighted.

753
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,829
Thank you, Mrs. Patmore.

754
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:32,866
- Thank you.
- Uh, mind you eat them slowly.

755
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,935
Whoa.

756
00:36:34,968 --> 00:36:36,836
Oh. Mr. Mason.

757
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,638
How are you? Are you
on your way back to the farm?

758
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:40,950
I wanted to give
the young couple a break.

759
00:36:40,974 --> 00:36:42,541
They're never alone.

760
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:43,920
They always
have to put up with me.

761
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:45,946
Well, it's your house
to do as you like.

762
00:36:45,979 --> 00:36:48,014
But I want them to feel
it's their home,

763
00:36:48,048 --> 00:36:51,517
so that when I surrender the
tenancy, they'll take it on.

764
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,718
What will you do?

765
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:53,954
Don't you worry about me.

766
00:36:53,987 --> 00:36:55,789
You've got your own concerns.

767
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:56,957
Well, I do worry about you.

768
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,591
Oh, thank you. Oof.

769
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:01,928
Call sheets for tomorrow
will be issued in an hour

770
00:37:01,962 --> 00:37:03,562
and delivered to your digs.

771
00:37:03,595 --> 00:37:04,898
A good day?

772
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,033
It's always good
if we get through the schedule.

773
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:08,634
What's that? Good news, I hope.

774
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:09,970
Not really.

775
00:37:10,003 --> 00:37:12,038
My husband isn't coming back
when he said.

776
00:37:12,072 --> 00:37:13,873
Must be a disappointment.

777
00:37:13,907 --> 00:37:15,842
It's a disappointment
but not a surprise.

778
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,576
Half past 8:00
is too late for me.

779
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:19,511
I like to eat at 7:00.

780
00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:22,715
It's difficult for the kitchen
if we change the usual timings.

781
00:37:27,586 --> 00:37:29,588
I wish I could see
the star magic.

782
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:30,790
Well, I tell you what.

783
00:37:30,824 --> 00:37:31,867
One of her films
is showing in Thirsk.

784
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:32,892
Why don't we catch it?

785
00:37:32,926 --> 00:37:34,661
I should say no.

786
00:37:34,694 --> 00:37:36,097
Why?

787
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,210
None of your family's here.
You're your own mistress.

788
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,868
All right.

789
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:44,504
I'll warn Barrow,
put on a coat and tell Granny.

790
00:37:50,044 --> 00:37:51,746
Now, Granny, don't be cross,

791
00:37:51,779 --> 00:37:53,748
but I'm going into Thirsk
to see a film.

792
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:55,682
On your own?

793
00:37:55,715 --> 00:37:57,818
With Mr. Barber, the director.

794
00:37:57,852 --> 00:38:01,022
Have you heard
from Henry lately?

795
00:38:01,055 --> 00:38:03,157
He sent a telegram today.

796
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,059
He's not coming back yet.

797
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:06,761
Denker, change of plan.

798
00:38:06,794 --> 00:38:07,895
I won't get dressed.

799
00:38:07,928 --> 00:38:09,997
I'll have my dinner on a tray.

800
00:38:10,031 --> 00:38:12,066
Milady.

801
00:38:17,204 --> 00:38:19,106
I am sorry.

802
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,975
It's not your fault

803
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:25,146
that Miss Dalgleish has
all the charm of a verruca.

804
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:27,014
Well, Mr. Dexter's nice.

805
00:38:27,048 --> 00:38:29,784
He can stick up for himself
without my help.

806
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:31,185
Doesn't filming interest you?

807
00:38:31,218 --> 00:38:33,154
I watched some of it.

808
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:35,022
I'd rather eat pebbles.

809
00:38:35,056 --> 00:38:36,857
In fact,

810
00:38:36,891 --> 00:38:38,625
I think I'll retire to my bed.

811
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:40,928
At least until they've all gone.

812
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:42,830
Should I be worried?

813
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:46,666
Well, Florence Nightingale took
to her bed at the age of 38.

814
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,069
She died at 90.

815
00:38:48,102 --> 00:38:49,937
You would tell me, wouldn't you?

816
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,907
What do you think?

817
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,141
Go on.

818
00:39:01,148 --> 00:39:02,850
<i>And you, Lord Grantham?</i>

819
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:05,652
Are you familiar
with the south of France?

820
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:07,164
I know Lord Brougham
first made it fashionable

821
00:39:07,188 --> 00:39:09,156
in the 1830s
when he was chancellor.

822
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,961
So you're only taking back
what is yours by right?

823
00:39:12,994 --> 00:39:14,695
I wouldn't say that,
but I do see

824
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,064
why you find it upsetting.

825
00:39:16,098 --> 00:39:17,833
But here you are,

826
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:20,102
eyeing up the furniture,
measuring the curtains.

827
00:39:20,135 --> 00:39:21,103
<i>Ma man,</i> please.

828
00:39:21,136 --> 00:39:22,838
We can always buy another villa.

829
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:26,975
We're here
because your son invited us.

830
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:28,877
But I suppose
I would like to know

831
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,079
why your husband
did what he did.

832
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:32,990
I've asked our lawyer
to join us here in a few days.

833
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:34,850
I think it's an excellent idea.

834
00:39:34,883 --> 00:39:37,085
Until then,
I hope you'll enjoy your stay.

835
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:44,725
Your butler lends a welcome air
of splendor to the proceedings.

836
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,895
But he can stand down
if you prefer.

837
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:49,006
Why, when the villa already
belongs to your granddaughter?

838
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,734
Lady Bagshaw,
please come and sit here.

839
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:56,838
I am so sorry.

840
00:39:56,872 --> 00:39:58,950
I laid down for five minutes,
shut my eyes, and that was it.

841
00:39:58,974 --> 00:40:00,708
I was gone.

842
00:40:00,742 --> 00:40:02,844
Welcome to
the Villa of the Doves.

843
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:04,688
- You must come here a lot.
- We do.

844
00:40:04,712 --> 00:40:07,849
Or rather, we did,
before you entered our lives.

845
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:09,026
Always in the winter

846
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,819
for as long as I can remember.

847
00:40:10,852 --> 00:40:13,021
But now coming in the
warmer months is catching on.

848
00:40:13,054 --> 00:40:14,990
I'm planning an article on that.

849
00:40:15,023 --> 00:40:16,258
You're a writer, Lady Hexham?

850
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,059
More of a journalist,
I'm afraid.

851
00:40:18,093 --> 00:40:21,129
I have a magazine, and
I'm taking back control of it.

852
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:22,864
What's your article about?

853
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:26,902
Oh, uh, Scott Fitzgerald,
Zelda, Coco Chanel.

854
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:29,670
All the people that got the
hotels to stay open in July.

855
00:40:30,338 --> 00:40:33,108
Can I publish some pictures
of the villa?

856
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,910
Might that be possible?

857
00:40:34,943 --> 00:40:36,178
Of course.

858
00:40:36,211 --> 00:40:38,046
If we can see the images
before you use them.

859
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,882
Ah, you're obviously not
the first journalist he's met.

860
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:45,987
Tickets, please.

861
00:40:48,357 --> 00:40:50,326
We're going to have to defer
our appreciation

862
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:53,062
of Miss Dalgleish's attractions
to another time.

863
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:54,797
This isn't her film.

864
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,731
<i>The Terror</i> is the first
all-talking picture

865
00:40:56,766 --> 00:40:58,201
to show in Britain.

866
00:40:58,234 --> 00:41:00,074
- I thought that was <i>The Jazz Singer.</i>
- Oh, no.

867
00:41:00,102 --> 00:41:02,214
In that, Al Jolson just says
a few words to his old mother.

868
00:41:02,238 --> 00:41:03,806
Oh, and sings.

869
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,808
In this,
they talk all the way through.

870
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,310
- Mm.
- Where's the Rialto?

871
00:41:07,343 --> 00:41:09,711
Uh, take the next left and park.

872
00:41:15,117 --> 00:41:17,987
Lady Mary's gone
to the pictures in Thirsk

873
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,290
with Mr. Barber, and old Lady
Grantham's eating in her room.

874
00:41:21,324 --> 00:41:24,827
So Mr. Dexter and Miss Dalgleish
will be dining alone.

875
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,229
Have you let Mrs. Patmore know?

876
00:41:26,262 --> 00:41:27,263
I have.

877
00:41:28,264 --> 00:41:30,132
We all pity Mr. Dexter.

878
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:33,769
What's the matter?

879
00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:36,038
Oh, you wouldn't be interested,
Mrs. Hughes.

880
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:38,307
Try me.

881
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:40,009
If you want to.

882
00:41:49,151 --> 00:41:50,553
When we had the royal visit,

883
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:53,923
do you remember
a valet called Ellis?

884
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:55,958
I do.

885
00:41:55,992 --> 00:41:59,161
You and he were quite friendly,
I recall.

886
00:41:59,195 --> 00:42:03,132
I had a letter from him
this morning

887
00:42:03,165 --> 00:42:05,001
saying he's getting married.

888
00:42:06,602 --> 00:42:09,171
And that's sad?

889
00:42:10,306 --> 00:42:13,009
I know it shouldn't be.

890
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:17,146
Mr. Barrow, your path in life
is a hard one.

891
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:19,982
Most people in your position

892
00:42:20,016 --> 00:42:22,051
choose to hide
behind appearances

893
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:26,156
that will allow them to
avoid persecution and rejection.

894
00:42:26,189 --> 00:42:28,925
He's surely not
to be blamed for it.

895
00:42:31,061 --> 00:42:33,797
It isn't what I want,
Mrs. Hughes.

896
00:42:35,065 --> 00:42:37,134
Then you're a brave man.

897
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:40,370
But you're also destined
to be a lonely one.

898
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:42,172
Unless you're very fortunate.

899
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:08,298
I thought you said her face
could sell a million tickets.

900
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:10,367
Not in Thirsk, apparently.

901
00:43:14,471 --> 00:43:16,073
But you're right, of course.

902
00:43:16,106 --> 00:43:18,275
She is very beautiful.

903
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:33,423
How wonderful this is.

904
00:43:33,457 --> 00:43:36,927
I'm still curious
as to why we're here.

905
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,129
If you'd come to England,
you could have met Mama,

906
00:43:39,162 --> 00:43:41,064
which would've made more sense.

907
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:43,500
It was you I wanted to meet
more than old Lady Grantham.

908
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:45,068
And your mother?

909
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:47,371
The situation is
more delicate for her,

910
00:43:47,404 --> 00:43:48,672
but she'll be all right.

911
00:43:48,705 --> 00:43:50,240
I'll make sure of that.

912
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:56,213
- That way.
- Mm.

913
00:43:57,481 --> 00:43:59,217
<i>What do think their game is?</i>

914
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,119
To lull us into
a sense of security

915
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:02,387
then whack us with a lawsuit?

916
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,055
Maybe they want us
to feel guilty

917
00:44:04,088 --> 00:44:06,023
and withdraw from the field.

918
00:44:06,057 --> 00:44:08,268
I think it's just that Monsieur
de Montmirail loved his father,

919
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:10,294
and he intends
to carry out his wishes.

920
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:12,263
And we're here
to represent Granny,

921
00:44:12,296 --> 00:44:14,031
the mystery figure in all this.

922
00:44:37,255 --> 00:44:38,423
<i>Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

923
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:41,125
Glare. Um, no.

924
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:43,060
Um, cover.

925
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:45,263
C... Uh, cool.

926
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:46,364
Yes.

927
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:48,166
- Carson?
- Oh.

928
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:50,501
May I be of help?

929
00:44:50,535 --> 00:44:54,305
Um...

930
00:44:54,338 --> 00:44:57,308
I thought maybe this one.

931
00:44:57,341 --> 00:45:00,111
It makes you look like
King Zog of Albania.

932
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:02,947
Yeah.

933
00:45:04,348 --> 00:45:05,349
Oh, perfect.

934
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:07,351
Oh. No, no, no.

935
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:08,453
I wouldn't hear of it.

936
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:10,321
It was my choice,
so I should pay.

937
00:45:10,354 --> 00:45:12,323
Yeah, but I'm the one
who has to wear it.

938
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:13,424
Um...

939
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,993
Thanks for your custom, sir.

940
00:45:16,027 --> 00:45:17,328
Both you and your wife.

941
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:26,480
If you were selling menswear
when you first

942
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:29,073
got to Hollywood,
how did you break into films?

943
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:31,309
Well, one day, they asked me
to pose for a trade journal

944
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:33,077
in a suit
that they were marketing,

945
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,146
and an agent came
and signed me up.

946
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:37,216
- Because you're so handsome.
- Oh.

947
00:45:37,249 --> 00:45:39,351
I thought they were excited
by my acting talent.

948
00:45:39,384 --> 00:45:41,320
Come on, girls. Get to wardrobe.

949
00:45:41,353 --> 00:45:43,322
We all want to go home.

950
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,158
Now you know
why I'm in the movies.

951
00:45:46,191 --> 00:45:47,459
How did you become a butler?

952
00:45:47,493 --> 00:45:49,228
Well, it's a lot less glamorous.

953
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:50,629
I got a job as a hall boy.

954
00:45:50,662 --> 00:45:53,465
Then I was a junior footman,
first footman, valet

955
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:55,267
and finally butler.

956
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,478
There's not much
I couldn't tell you

957
00:45:56,502 --> 00:45:58,203
about how to run a house, sir.

958
00:45:58,237 --> 00:45:59,647
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

959
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:02,074
I don't know what I'm doing
half the time.

960
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:03,509
That's not what it looks like.

961
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:07,112
Oh, thank you, Mr...?

962
00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:09,214
Just Barrow, sir.

963
00:46:09,248 --> 00:46:10,382
Right, Guy.

964
00:46:10,415 --> 00:46:12,417
Let's rehearse please.

965
00:46:16,388 --> 00:46:18,423
Myrna, say the line.

966
00:46:19,691 --> 00:46:21,426
I saved you a mallet.

967
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:24,663
I always think they look like
instruments of war.

968
00:46:24,696 --> 00:46:26,131
It's because they are.

969
00:46:26,164 --> 00:46:28,066
There's a telephone call
for you.

970
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,102
A Mr. Bullock.
He says it's urgent.

971
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:32,304
Five minutes, everyone!

972
00:46:33,572 --> 00:46:35,440
<i>There's a drama going on below.</i>

973
00:46:35,474 --> 00:46:37,285
The man in charge was
shouting down the telephone

974
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:39,077
when I came up.

975
00:46:39,111 --> 00:46:41,280
Apparently, they're making
the wrong sort of film.

976
00:46:41,313 --> 00:46:42,681
Is there a right sort?

977
00:46:42,714 --> 00:46:44,416
Well, all I know is

978
00:46:44,449 --> 00:46:47,419
it seems the public
only want films that talk.

979
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:49,454
I should've thought
the best thing about films

980
00:46:49,488 --> 00:46:51,623
is that you can't hear them.

981
00:46:51,657 --> 00:46:54,159
Be even better if
you couldn't see them either.

982
00:46:55,594 --> 00:46:57,095
Everybody,
gather around, please!

983
00:46:57,129 --> 00:46:59,431
Everybody!

984
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:04,136
We are suspending production.

985
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:05,437
I-I know. I know.

986
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,439
I'm sorry to be
the bearer of bad news.

987
00:47:07,472 --> 00:47:10,108
We'll contact you all
when we've finalized our plans.

988
00:47:10,142 --> 00:47:11,610
Thank you.

989
00:47:11,643 --> 00:47:14,714
What is it? What's happened?

990
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,482
Well, it seems the talkies are

991
00:47:16,516 --> 00:47:18,551
making too much money
to ignore, while our picture

992
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,154
is silent and too expensive
to make its costs back,

993
00:47:21,187 --> 00:47:23,623
so they want to cut
their losses and shut us down.

994
00:47:23,656 --> 00:47:26,159
- But how sad.
- It is worse than sad

995
00:47:26,192 --> 00:47:27,503
for the men and women
working on it.

996
00:47:27,527 --> 00:47:29,329
We still owe our extras
back pay,

997
00:47:29,362 --> 00:47:31,631
and now they're out of a job.

998
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:34,434
- I told you. I...
- Excuse me.

999
00:47:34,467 --> 00:47:35,735
Myrna.

1000
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,604
W-Why is he stopping?

1001
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:40,607
Apparently, silent films
aren't making any money now.

1002
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,241
I saw it the other night.

1003
00:47:42,275 --> 00:47:43,610
The cinema was almost empty.

1004
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:44,711
What a shame.

1005
00:47:44,744 --> 00:47:46,446
I feel sorry for Mr. Barber.

1006
00:47:46,479 --> 00:47:48,348
- He doesn't deserve this.
- Enough.

1007
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:53,586
I wish I could help.

1008
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,355
Oh, uh, I wish you could, too,

1009
00:47:55,388 --> 00:47:56,456
but I don't see how.

1010
00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:57,690
We're making a silent.

1011
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:59,525
They only want to release
talkies, so...

1012
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:01,670
Well, why couldn't this be
turned into a talking film?

1013
00:48:01,694 --> 00:48:03,931
What would that mean?

1014
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,666
Getting a technician down
from London.

1015
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:08,267
He could record sound

1016
00:48:08,301 --> 00:48:10,303
for scenes
we've already made and...

1017
00:48:10,336 --> 00:48:11,647
And then put new speeches
into the rest.

1018
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:13,406
Why wouldn't that work?

1019
00:48:13,439 --> 00:48:14,607
Uh...

1020
00:48:16,576 --> 00:48:19,512
Mr. Mason's driving me mad.

1021
00:48:19,545 --> 00:48:21,514
Every cup and saucer
has to be right.

1022
00:48:21,547 --> 00:48:23,549
The fact is
you're his daughter-in-law.

1023
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:24,684
His son died in the war.

1024
00:48:24,717 --> 00:48:26,252
I mean, it's no wonder he and I

1025
00:48:26,285 --> 00:48:27,620
rub each other up the wrong way.

1026
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,264
Well, it's a shame
he's getting on your nerves

1027
00:48:29,288 --> 00:48:31,391
because he's a lovely chap.

1028
00:48:31,424 --> 00:48:33,259
And he thinks the world
of you, Daisy.

1029
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:35,361
Weren't you sweet on him once?

1030
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:37,497
About a hundred years ago.

1031
00:48:39,365 --> 00:48:41,710
I hear there's a sound
expert coming down from London.

1032
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:43,469
Don't remind me.

1033
00:48:45,471 --> 00:48:46,974
Are you all right?

1034
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,441
Can I help?

1035
00:48:48,474 --> 00:48:50,210
No one can help me now.

1036
00:48:57,584 --> 00:48:59,620
Well.

1037
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:01,422
If it isn't Just Barrow.

1038
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:03,223
Sir?

1039
00:49:03,257 --> 00:49:04,701
I've just been thinking
how much more interesting

1040
00:49:04,725 --> 00:49:07,327
this great house is
than our silly little film.

1041
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,596
Don't call me "sir."

1042
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,834
Is there anything I can do?

1043
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,369
Well, not unless you've got
some ideas for my next career.

1044
00:49:15,402 --> 00:49:17,638
Um, I don't understand.

1045
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,608
Films have been mime until now.

1046
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:23,444
Mime with music.

1047
00:49:23,477 --> 00:49:26,447
Now with the new talkies,
they're gonna be about acting.

1048
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,315
They won't want us.

1049
00:49:28,348 --> 00:49:31,452
They'll hire real actors
from the theater, and...

1050
00:49:31,485 --> 00:49:32,720
we'll be finished.

1051
00:49:32,754 --> 00:49:34,621
But you've got a good voice.

1052
00:49:34,655 --> 00:49:37,324
There may be
new faces coming in,

1053
00:49:37,357 --> 00:49:38,635
but the public
won't want to say goodbye

1054
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:40,494
to all their old favorites.

1055
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:41,763
I hope you're right.

1056
00:49:42,764 --> 00:49:44,264
Sir.

1057
00:49:58,612 --> 00:49:59,881
That's the Duke...

1058
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,350
That's the Duke
of Westminster's yacht.

1059
00:50:30,678 --> 00:50:32,580
Let me sum up.

1060
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:34,649
In the years since 1864,

1061
00:50:34,682 --> 00:50:37,485
the late Marquis de Montmirail
made four wills.

1062
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:39,687
In every one,
he refers to the fact

1063
00:50:39,721 --> 00:50:41,523
that he gave
the Villa des Colombes

1064
00:50:41,556 --> 00:50:44,827
to the now Dowager Countess
of Grantham in 1865.

1065
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,594
I brought the originals.

1066
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:48,596
I will leave copies.

1067
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,641
Then clearly it wasn't something
that slipped his mind.

1068
00:50:50,665 --> 00:50:52,778
He meant to do this thing,
and he stuck by his decision.

1069
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:54,636
I feel better for that.

1070
00:50:54,669 --> 00:50:56,114
She must
have had some hold over him.

1071
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:57,940
She must have blackmailed him.

1072
00:50:57,973 --> 00:50:59,607
<i>Ma man,</i> this is
a foolish response.

1073
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:01,342
We shall challenge it in court.

1074
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:03,813
On what basis, madame?

1075
00:51:03,846 --> 00:51:05,413
You have other houses.

1076
00:51:05,446 --> 00:51:06,816
There's no question of hardship.

1077
00:51:06,849 --> 00:51:09,484
Your husband bought the villa
and disposed of it

1078
00:51:09,517 --> 00:51:11,419
before he even met you.

1079
00:51:11,452 --> 00:51:15,456
My advice would be to surrender
the property without delay.

1080
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:21,563
Thank you so much.

1081
00:51:21,596 --> 00:51:23,866
- Do you mean to accept this?
- Of course.

1082
00:51:23,899 --> 00:51:26,734
My father made me sole executor,
Lord Grantham.

1083
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:28,570
I like to think
it was because he trusted me

1084
00:51:28,603 --> 00:51:29,772
to carry out his wishes.

1085
00:51:29,805 --> 00:51:32,875
Then why did you invite us here?

1086
00:51:32,908 --> 00:51:34,676
Because I was curious
to meet you.

1087
00:51:34,709 --> 00:51:35,945
My father and your mother

1088
00:51:35,978 --> 00:51:38,613
spent a week together
in October 1864.

1089
00:51:44,586 --> 00:51:46,889
And I was born in July 1865.

1090
00:51:46,922 --> 00:51:48,723
Precisely.

1091
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:50,159
I think that's the key to why

1092
00:51:50,192 --> 00:51:51,760
he gave her the villa
one month later.

1093
00:51:51,794 --> 00:51:54,395
In gratitude for your birth.

1094
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:59,935
In short, I believe you and I
have a great deal in common.

1095
00:52:14,951 --> 00:52:17,386
- We should thank old Lady Grantham.
- Of course.

1096
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:20,489
At least now we know
that for her to have the villa

1097
00:52:20,522 --> 00:52:22,691
wasn't a random choice
or a foolish mistake

1098
00:52:22,725 --> 00:52:26,495
but a decision that was firmly
endorsed over many years.

1099
00:52:26,528 --> 00:52:28,765
Feels funny, in a way,
to know my own child is

1100
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:30,776
part of this golden circle
where, because of your blood,

1101
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,635
lovely things happen.

1102
00:52:32,668 --> 00:52:35,504
Just as Mary will have Down ton
and we will have Brompton.

1103
00:52:35,537 --> 00:52:36,907
Yes, but they're
working estates.

1104
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,009
This place was made
for laughter and fun.

1105
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:42,611
Wouldn't Sybil have been
pleased for her daughter?

1106
00:52:43,712 --> 00:52:46,783
And encouraged her to use it
for the good of others?

1107
00:52:46,816 --> 00:52:49,052
Yes, I think she would.

1108
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:50,653
Then let's do the same.

1109
00:52:50,686 --> 00:52:52,789
I long to bring Sybbie here.

1110
00:52:52,822 --> 00:52:54,891
She'll love it.

1111
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:56,725
Look at that view.

1112
00:52:58,862 --> 00:53:01,865
Don't you feel grateful
we're alive?

1113
00:53:01,898 --> 00:53:03,565
I love you, you know.

1114
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,536
In a way I thought
I'd never love again.

1115
00:53:07,569 --> 00:53:09,505
And I love you.

1116
00:53:09,538 --> 00:53:10,840
So that's all right.

1117
00:53:14,911 --> 00:53:16,880
Shall we go back in?
The water is...

1118
00:53:16,913 --> 00:53:18,882
They look very happy together.

1119
00:53:18,915 --> 00:53:21,017
- So they should.
- Mm.

1120
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:23,887
It's thrilling for Sybbie,
for all of them.

1121
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,956
I like the idea of Tom and Lucy

1122
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:28,557
hosting a gathering here
every summer,

1123
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,027
until it becomes
a family tradition.

1124
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:34,730
The sun has made me sleepy.

1125
00:53:34,764 --> 00:53:38,869
If you'll excuse me, I think
I'll have a nap before dinner.

1126
00:53:38,903 --> 00:53:41,272
You look a little tired, too.

1127
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:43,573
Why don't you do the same?

1128
00:53:43,606 --> 00:53:44,909
I won't be too long.

1129
00:53:48,879 --> 00:53:51,548
She's right. You do look tired.

1130
00:53:51,581 --> 00:53:53,693
Never sure how helpful it is
for people to point it out.

1131
00:53:53,717 --> 00:53:55,485
Oh, I'm sorry.

1132
00:53:57,021 --> 00:53:59,991
Keep writing, whatever happens.

1133
00:54:00,024 --> 00:54:03,961
Mama, if something is troubling
you, please just say it.

1134
00:54:03,995 --> 00:54:05,997
No, no, it's nothing, honestly.

1135
00:54:08,065 --> 00:54:09,977
I've had to change

1136
00:54:10,001 --> 00:54:12,602
the setting of
the dinner table again,

1137
00:54:12,635 --> 00:54:14,147
but I think they've got
the hang of ironing

1138
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:16,539
His Lordship's shirts at last.

1139
00:54:16,573 --> 00:54:18,608
You should've let me do that.

1140
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:20,053
They must be very grateful
for your help, Mr. Carson.

1141
00:54:20,077 --> 00:54:21,078
Well, maybe.

1142
00:54:21,112 --> 00:54:23,014
When I showed them how to do it,

1143
00:54:23,047 --> 00:54:25,816
they certainly spoke a lot of
French very loud and very fast.

1144
00:54:26,817 --> 00:54:28,886
Is anything settled yet?

1145
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:31,989
It seems the villa
now belongs to Miss Sybbie.

1146
00:54:32,023 --> 00:54:33,758
Lucky girl.

1147
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:35,059
Do you envy her, Miss Baxter?

1148
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:37,328
I'm not a big believer in envy,
Mr. Bates.

1149
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:39,997
I know what I want,
and I can live without

1150
00:54:40,031 --> 00:54:41,966
a villa in the south of France.

1151
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:43,968
What do you want, Miss Baxter?

1152
00:54:44,001 --> 00:54:45,702
Oh, come now, Mr. Carson.

1153
00:54:45,735 --> 00:54:47,080
We all know
what Miss Baxter wants.

1154
00:54:47,104 --> 00:54:49,774
Her affections are
very firmly engaged.

1155
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:51,342
Not engaged.

1156
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:55,913
Not engaged in that way,
perhaps, but thoroughly taken.

1157
00:54:55,946 --> 00:54:58,182
Are we discussing Mr. Molesley?

1158
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:00,650
We are.

1159
00:55:00,683 --> 00:55:02,685
But suppose he never
steps up to the mark?

1160
00:55:03,686 --> 00:55:06,090
Then I will be a spinster.

1161
00:55:06,123 --> 00:55:07,825
You'd never marry anyone else?

1162
00:55:09,193 --> 00:55:11,694
It took me long enough
to find him.

1163
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:12,997
Madame.

1164
00:55:19,037 --> 00:55:21,807
I don't know how long
he's thought about it,

1165
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,942
but once he checked the dates,
he was sure.

1166
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:27,145
I was born exactly nine months
after... and I quote...

1167
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:29,713
The "idyllic interlude"
they spent together.

1168
00:55:29,747 --> 00:55:31,783
And he gave her the villa
soon after I was born.

1169
00:55:31,817 --> 00:55:33,094
I'm sure that's all coincidence.

1170
00:55:33,118 --> 00:55:34,219
Are you?

1171
00:55:34,252 --> 00:55:36,021
It would explain the mystery.

1172
00:55:36,054 --> 00:55:37,956
Your father loved you very much.

1173
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:41,126
But Rosamund's the one who looks like him.

1174
00:55:43,195 --> 00:55:45,130
I hope this helps, milady.

1175
00:55:45,163 --> 00:55:46,231
Thank you, Baxter.

1176
00:55:46,264 --> 00:55:47,799
- Good night.
- Good night.

1177
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,801
What's that for?
Are you all right?

1178
00:55:49,835 --> 00:55:51,155
Just a bit of heartburn.
I'm fine.

1179
00:55:53,939 --> 00:55:56,775
What will happen if the story
gets out, do you think?

1180
00:55:56,808 --> 00:55:58,709
I suppose Carson
will hand in his notice.

1181
00:55:58,742 --> 00:56:00,045
Don't be ridiculous.

1182
00:56:00,078 --> 00:56:01,756
You're the least French person
I've ever met.

1183
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,048
You don't even like garlic.

1184
00:56:03,081 --> 00:56:05,150
That's not exactly
cast-iron proof.

1185
00:56:09,454 --> 00:56:11,123
How have they managed
this so fast?

1186
00:56:11,156 --> 00:56:12,891
Because time is money.

1187
00:56:12,924 --> 00:56:14,001
The problem now is
what are the actors gonna say.

1188
00:56:14,025 --> 00:56:15,193
What do you mean?

1189
00:56:15,227 --> 00:56:16,862
Well, I write
the lines for them,

1190
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,072
but they don't always
stick to the text,

1191
00:56:18,096 --> 00:56:19,663
and often
we can't really remember

1192
00:56:19,697 --> 00:56:21,433
what the actors
have actually said.

1193
00:56:21,466 --> 00:56:23,869
Why not let Mr. Molesley help?

1194
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:25,103
Why? What could he do?

1195
00:56:25,137 --> 00:56:26,771
Well, he's the village
schoolmaster,

1196
00:56:26,805 --> 00:56:28,273
and I know he can lip-read.

1197
00:56:28,306 --> 00:56:30,008
I'm sure he could
sort something out.

1198
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:31,675
That's certainly true.

1199
00:56:31,709 --> 00:56:33,054
And he's been here
every day as it is

1200
00:56:33,078 --> 00:56:34,155
and watched all the scenes.

1201
00:56:34,179 --> 00:56:36,747
Right, Mr. Barber. I'm ready.

1202
00:56:36,781 --> 00:56:38,783
Bring on the thespians.

1203
00:56:39,784 --> 00:56:41,719
Oh.

1204
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:48,760
That looks
very professional, milady,

1205
00:56:48,793 --> 00:56:49,904
if you don't mind my saying.

1206
00:56:49,928 --> 00:56:51,730
It's the new Speed Reflex.

1207
00:56:51,764 --> 00:56:53,732
You can see the image
before you take it.

1208
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:55,768
Oh, what will they think of next?

1209
00:56:55,801 --> 00:56:57,045
How are you
getting on downstairs?

1210
00:56:57,069 --> 00:56:59,038
All right, I think, sir.

1211
00:56:59,071 --> 00:57:02,008
Although, they're very French,
the French, aren't they?

1212
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:03,276
I suppose they're bound to be.

1213
00:57:03,309 --> 00:57:05,144
I suppose they are.

1214
00:57:05,178 --> 00:57:06,879
Poor things.

1215
00:57:06,913 --> 00:57:08,247
Now, this is pretty good,

1216
00:57:08,281 --> 00:57:10,049
but, Carson, could you move
the telephone?

1217
00:57:10,082 --> 00:57:12,251
It spoils it a bit.

1218
00:57:13,819 --> 00:57:16,088
It's lovely to see you
enjoying your labors.

1219
00:57:16,122 --> 00:57:17,924
It feels good to have a...

1220
00:57:17,957 --> 00:57:19,325
Foothold in
the real world again?

1221
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:22,195
- Something like that, yes.
- Mm.

1222
00:57:23,362 --> 00:57:25,264
Oh, my goodness.

1223
00:57:25,298 --> 00:57:26,698
What is it?

1224
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:28,801
Look.

1225
00:57:35,975 --> 00:57:37,810
Who is she?

1226
00:57:37,843 --> 00:57:40,913
That is the Lady Grantham
I first went to work for

1227
00:57:40,947 --> 00:57:42,882
as a young hall boy
wet behind the ears.

1228
00:57:42,915 --> 00:57:44,951
Granny?

1229
00:57:44,984 --> 00:57:47,086
Heavens.

1230
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,855
Thank you, Carson.
Could you leave us for a moment?

1231
00:57:52,024 --> 00:57:53,226
What does it say?

1232
00:57:53,259 --> 00:57:56,896
<i>"Violette, mon adorée."</i>

1233
00:57:59,165 --> 00:58:00,866
Gosh.

1234
00:58:03,569 --> 00:58:06,239
Mary had a little lamb.

1235
00:58:06,272 --> 00:58:09,108
Its fleece was white as snow.

1236
00:58:09,141 --> 00:58:10,543
Right, Mr. Stubbins,
are you ready?

1237
00:58:10,576 --> 00:58:12,545
As ready as I can be,
Mr. Barber,

1238
00:58:12,578 --> 00:58:15,248
when I've not controlled
the soundproofing or the set.

1239
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:17,550
If we could have
Mr. Dexter, please.

1240
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:18,884
Guy?

1241
00:58:19,885 --> 00:58:21,120
Where are the lines?

1242
00:58:21,153 --> 00:58:22,555
I'm so sorry.

1243
00:58:22,588 --> 00:58:24,223
- No, no, no.
- Oh.

1244
00:58:24,257 --> 00:58:27,059
- Thank you.
- And here.

1245
00:58:27,093 --> 00:58:29,196
Now, time your speech
to match the film.

1246
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:31,365
No, no, no. Don't lean in.

1247
00:58:31,398 --> 00:58:34,001
And try not to move your head.

1248
00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:35,369
All right.

1249
00:58:35,402 --> 00:58:38,772
Ring the bell for silence!

1250
00:58:40,374 --> 00:58:41,908
And...

1251
00:58:41,942 --> 00:58:43,343
Rolling sound.

1252
00:58:55,055 --> 00:58:56,823
"Well, if it isn't Lady Anne.

1253
00:58:56,857 --> 00:58:59,092
"I thought you might find me.

1254
00:58:59,126 --> 00:59:01,361
"No one can keep a secret
these days.

1255
00:59:03,096 --> 00:59:06,800
"May I remind you
it's my future to throw away.

1256
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:12,439
No, wait. Don't go."

1257
00:59:12,472 --> 00:59:13,907
Cut.

1258
00:59:19,346 --> 00:59:21,181
Well done.

1259
00:59:21,214 --> 00:59:22,616
Miss Dalgleish.

1260
00:59:22,649 --> 00:59:24,217
Ready.

1261
00:59:35,228 --> 00:59:37,397
And action.

1262
00:59:41,034 --> 00:59:42,369
"I knew where you'd be.

1263
00:59:42,402 --> 00:59:44,871
I only came to..."

1264
00:59:44,905 --> 00:59:46,416
Hang on a minute.
I turned me head round there.

1265
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,141
- You...
- Oh, y-yes.

1266
00:59:48,175 --> 00:59:50,944
I-I've written a line
to cover that. You see?

1267
00:59:50,977 --> 00:59:53,447
"I've only come to stop you
throwing away your future."

1268
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,183
You... y-you turn back
on "future."

1269
00:59:56,216 --> 00:59:57,384
Right.

1270
01:00:01,021 --> 01:00:03,223
And action.

1271
01:00:05,426 --> 01:00:07,228
"I knew where you'd be.

1272
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:09,306
I've only come to stop you
throwing away your future."

1273
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:12,100
Louder, Miss Dalgleish!

1274
01:00:12,133 --> 01:00:15,269
"I can't stay
and watch you ruin yourself.

1275
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:19,173
- Um, I must..."
- Cut. Cut.

1276
01:00:19,207 --> 01:00:20,942
Thank you, Myrna.
Could I have a moment?

1277
01:00:22,343 --> 01:00:25,046
You all right?

1278
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,481
Now what?

1279
01:00:26,514 --> 01:00:28,416
- Mr. Stubbins?
- Oh, I am here to record sound,

1280
01:00:28,449 --> 01:00:30,952
Mr. Barber, not to perform miracles.

1281
01:00:30,985 --> 01:00:32,920
The Lady Anne Erskine
she is not.

1282
01:00:32,954 --> 01:00:34,465
Couldn't she just learn
the accent a bit better

1283
01:00:34,489 --> 01:00:36,190
and do it again?

1284
01:00:36,224 --> 01:00:37,401
People spend lives
trying to learn

1285
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,093
this particular accent
and failing.

1286
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:40,304
George Bernard Shaw
wrote a play about it.

1287
01:00:40,328 --> 01:00:43,131
Uh, you could do it, milady.

1288
01:00:43,164 --> 01:00:45,400
You saw how Mr. Dexter managed.

1289
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,001
It can't be that hard.

1290
01:00:47,034 --> 01:00:48,536
- But I couldn't.
- What?

1291
01:00:48,569 --> 01:00:50,138
You couldn't do the accent?

1292
01:00:50,171 --> 01:00:52,273
I think you could.
I think you do.

1293
01:00:52,306 --> 01:00:55,209
- But I'm not an actress.
- Well, is Myrna an actress?

1294
01:00:55,243 --> 01:00:56,978
Are you keen to see
her Hedda Gabler?

1295
01:00:57,011 --> 01:00:58,112
Even so.

1296
01:00:58,146 --> 01:00:59,714
Look, just-just try it.

1297
01:00:59,747 --> 01:01:02,016
If you can't do it, we'll
shut down, possibly for good.

1298
01:01:02,049 --> 01:01:05,453
If you can,
you'll allow us to keep going.

1299
01:01:05,486 --> 01:01:07,288
Please.

1300
01:01:07,321 --> 01:01:09,457
How do we deal
with Miss Dalgleish?

1301
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,193
Oh, right now, um,
get her back upstairs.

1302
01:01:12,226 --> 01:01:13,537
- We need to know if this is gonna work.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1303
01:01:13,561 --> 01:01:16,497
- I'll do that.
- Mm-hmm.

1304
01:01:16,531 --> 01:01:18,266
Miss Dalgleish?

1305
01:01:23,438 --> 01:01:25,549
- Here are the lines, milady.
- Thank you.

1306
01:01:25,573 --> 01:01:27,475
I don't know how I get myself
into these things.

1307
01:01:36,451 --> 01:01:38,486
"I knew where you'd be.

1308
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:42,458
"I've only come to stop you
throwing away your future.

1309
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:46,495
"I can't stay
and watch you ruin yourself.

1310
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:48,363
I must."

1311
01:01:49,364 --> 01:01:50,332
And cut.

1312
01:01:50,365 --> 01:01:51,500
Play them together.

1313
01:02:01,577 --> 01:02:03,579
Well, if it isn't Lady Anne.

1314
01:02:03,612 --> 01:02:05,314
I thought you might find me.

1315
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,349
No one can keep a secret
these days.

1316
01:02:07,382 --> 01:02:09,351
I knew where you'd be.

1317
01:02:09,384 --> 01:02:12,321
I've only come to stop you
throwing away your future.

1318
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:15,090
May I remind you
it's my future to throw away.

1319
01:02:16,592 --> 01:02:20,128
I can't stay
and watch you ruin yourself.

1320
01:02:20,162 --> 01:02:21,497
No, wait.

1321
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,098
Don't go.

1322
01:02:24,132 --> 01:02:25,400
I must.

1323
01:02:28,237 --> 01:02:31,373
Oh.

1324
01:02:42,417 --> 01:02:45,053
I do hope that was a prop.

1325
01:02:45,855 --> 01:02:47,523
When was it painted?

1326
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:49,491
And why was she his adored one?

1327
01:02:49,525 --> 01:02:51,493
Because she granted
the ultimate favor?

1328
01:02:51,527 --> 01:02:53,395
They were only together
for a few days.

1329
01:02:53,428 --> 01:02:54,563
Does it sound likely?

1330
01:02:54,596 --> 01:02:56,265
And it's just a coincidence

1331
01:02:56,298 --> 01:02:58,500
that Papa was born
nine months later?

1332
01:02:58,534 --> 01:03:00,235
I expect, when she got home,

1333
01:03:00,269 --> 01:03:02,504
your grandpapa was
jolly pleased to see her.

1334
01:03:02,538 --> 01:03:04,415
Anyway, what's clear is

1335
01:03:04,439 --> 01:03:06,408
Monsieur de Montmirail
was madly in love with her.

1336
01:03:06,441 --> 01:03:08,510
- When did he marry?
- Oh, I know that.

1337
01:03:08,544 --> 01:03:09,545
I looked him up.

1338
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:11,179
He married in 1870,

1339
01:03:11,213 --> 01:03:13,248
five years after
Robert was born.

1340
01:03:13,282 --> 01:03:16,084
And the present marquis
arrived in 1873.

1341
01:03:16,118 --> 01:03:17,630
So the villa was
a sort of parting gift

1342
01:03:17,654 --> 01:03:20,223
to your grandmother before
he looked around for a wife.

1343
01:03:20,256 --> 01:03:21,424
That's what it sounds like.

1344
01:03:21,457 --> 01:03:23,092
Evidently.

1345
01:03:26,129 --> 01:03:28,097
<i>I'm gonna sound him out.</i>

1346
01:03:28,131 --> 01:03:30,300
- About Mrs. Patmore.
- You can't.

1347
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,101
I can.

1348
01:03:32,135 --> 01:03:33,670
You know she's got
a house of her own.

1349
01:03:33,703 --> 01:03:35,305
You know she's lonely.

1350
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:37,373
It's a solution for all of us.

1351
01:03:38,374 --> 01:03:40,209
You look very conspiratorial.

1352
01:03:40,243 --> 01:03:41,578
We were talking about
Mrs. Patmore

1353
01:03:41,611 --> 01:03:43,212
and how much she likes you.

1354
01:03:43,246 --> 01:03:44,547
Does she indeed?

1355
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:46,449
Well, I like her.

1356
01:03:46,482 --> 01:03:48,318
- She's a fine woman.
- She is.

1357
01:03:48,351 --> 01:03:50,587
But I worry sometimes
that she's lonely.

1358
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,388
She's got her own cottage,
of course,

1359
01:03:52,422 --> 01:03:54,357
but I think she'd like
some company in it.

1360
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:59,128
I know what you're thinking,
but the answer's no.

1361
01:03:59,162 --> 01:04:00,597
You've always said
you admired her.

1362
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,131
And so I do.

1363
01:04:02,165 --> 01:04:03,375
But I couldn't live off a woman.

1364
01:04:03,399 --> 01:04:05,201
It wouldn't be right.

1365
01:04:05,234 --> 01:04:07,370
- Even if she wanted it?
- Even then.

1366
01:04:07,403 --> 01:04:08,614
There are things that are right

1367
01:04:08,638 --> 01:04:10,239
and there are things
that are wrong,

1368
01:04:10,273 --> 01:04:11,507
and I can't change that.

1369
01:04:15,612 --> 01:04:17,347
Thank you for taking it on.

1370
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,615
I owe you a great deal.

1371
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:20,216
Is everything in order?

1372
01:04:20,249 --> 01:04:21,919
Well, once we've recorded sound

1373
01:04:21,952 --> 01:04:23,453
for the scenes
we've already shot,

1374
01:04:23,486 --> 01:04:25,622
we'll need new material
for what's left...

1375
01:04:25,655 --> 01:04:27,290
Ooh.

1376
01:04:28,391 --> 01:04:30,526
M-May I have a word, Mr. Barber?

1377
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,261
Of course.

1378
01:04:32,295 --> 01:04:33,773
I-I've been through
all the dialogue cards

1379
01:04:33,797 --> 01:04:35,775
that w-would've been shown
if the picture were silent,

1380
01:04:35,799 --> 01:04:38,334
and I've started
to sketch out scenes

1381
01:04:38,368 --> 01:04:40,169
that would cover
the needs of the plot.

1382
01:04:40,203 --> 01:04:41,313
You mean you've written a play?

1383
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:43,239
Well, I've started one.

1384
01:04:43,272 --> 01:04:44,683
- Could I read these scenes?
- Of course.

1385
01:04:44,707 --> 01:04:47,410
And if you're content,
I'll do the rest.

1386
01:04:49,545 --> 01:04:52,315
Am I bound by the plot synopsis?

1387
01:04:53,684 --> 01:04:56,720
For instance,
when she finally casts him off,

1388
01:04:56,754 --> 01:04:59,657
might it not be better
with a big romantic climax?

1389
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:01,225
I don't understand.

1390
01:05:01,258 --> 01:05:02,660
Well, Bill Benson's

1391
01:05:02,693 --> 01:05:05,396
about to throw away his life
on the tables.

1392
01:05:05,429 --> 01:05:09,768
Alone, hollow and without hope.

1393
01:05:11,468 --> 01:05:13,270
Then suddenly he lifts his face

1394
01:05:13,303 --> 01:05:15,673
and sees Anne standing there,
tall, serene, graceful,

1395
01:05:15,706 --> 01:05:20,979
her eyes shining
with unshed tears.

1396
01:05:21,012 --> 01:05:22,981
On an impulse,
he snatches back his money.

1397
01:05:23,014 --> 01:05:25,416
<i>Rien ne va plus!</i>

1398
01:05:25,449 --> 01:05:26,717
The wheel spins.

1399
01:05:35,659 --> 01:05:39,998
And every last thing he owns
would have gone.

1400
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:41,632
But no.

1401
01:05:41,665 --> 01:05:45,804
Her love, her beauty
have saved him.

1402
01:05:47,304 --> 01:05:50,407
She takes his hand,
and they walk away.

1403
01:05:51,408 --> 01:05:52,543
Together.

1404
01:05:52,576 --> 01:05:54,344
The end.

1405
01:05:55,646 --> 01:05:57,514
I think I'm going to cry.

1406
01:05:57,548 --> 01:06:01,351
Mr. Molesley,
please finish the script

1407
01:06:01,385 --> 01:06:02,863
however you think best
and bring it to me.

1408
01:06:02,887 --> 01:06:04,388
Right.

1409
01:06:07,591 --> 01:06:10,327
- You say he used to work here?
- Yes.

1410
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,329
He was a footman.

1411
01:06:12,362 --> 01:06:14,598
But we weren't aware
of his hidden talents.

1412
01:06:18,502 --> 01:06:21,338
Poor Carson. He must be
cooking in those heavy clothes.

1413
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:23,875
Isn't there a lighter version
he could wear?

1414
01:06:23,908 --> 01:06:26,310
- I believe so.
- Thank you, monsieur,

1415
01:06:26,343 --> 01:06:29,313
but we English are never too
hot to wear the correct attire.

1416
01:06:29,346 --> 01:06:31,683
I've invited
some friends tomorrow

1417
01:06:31,716 --> 01:06:33,886
to say goodbye
and introduce all of you.

1418
01:06:33,919 --> 01:06:35,687
But the presence
of your butler reminds me

1419
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,288
that we are now your guests

1420
01:06:37,322 --> 01:06:38,432
and I should have
asked your permission.

1421
01:06:38,456 --> 01:06:39,491
Oh, please.

1422
01:06:39,524 --> 01:06:40,860
Let us drink to

1423
01:06:40,893 --> 01:06:43,495
your fortunate granddaughter,
Sybil Branson.

1424
01:06:43,528 --> 01:06:45,630
- To Sybbie.
- Sybbie.

1425
01:06:45,663 --> 01:06:47,699
I wish she were here.
I should like to meet her.

1426
01:06:47,732 --> 01:06:48,810
I hope you will one day.

1427
01:06:48,834 --> 01:06:50,502
She's a lovely girl.

1428
01:06:50,535 --> 01:06:52,772
It's nice to hear
a stepmother talk like that.

1429
01:06:52,805 --> 01:06:54,783
You must be pleased
the way things have turned out.

1430
01:06:54,807 --> 01:06:56,541
When people you love
have a stroke of luck,

1431
01:06:56,574 --> 01:06:58,376
it's almost better than
being lucky yourself.

1432
01:06:58,409 --> 01:06:59,711
Almost but not quite.

1433
01:06:59,744 --> 01:07:00,846
Yeah.

1434
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:07,552
You know the miniatures
in the library?

1435
01:07:08,486 --> 01:07:12,557
One of them is of Granny,
and it's engraved on the side.

1436
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,862
I've seen it.

1437
01:07:18,463 --> 01:07:20,431
I have been obliged
to see it there

1438
01:07:20,465 --> 01:07:22,300
for more than half a century.

1439
01:07:22,968 --> 01:07:25,403
But he forbade me to move it.

1440
01:07:25,436 --> 01:07:26,872
He made me swear.

1441
01:07:31,643 --> 01:07:33,813
Any more news from Mr. Talbot?

1442
01:07:33,846 --> 01:07:36,115
Not since the cable
I showed you.

1443
01:07:36,148 --> 01:07:37,817
You must be missing him, milady.

1444
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:39,852
I just hope he misses me.

1445
01:07:43,488 --> 01:07:45,423
His Lordship will be home soon.

1446
01:07:45,456 --> 01:07:47,625
I'm afraid
he'll be in for a shock.

1447
01:07:47,659 --> 01:07:49,862
Have you enjoyed the filming?

1448
01:07:49,895 --> 01:07:50,896
In a way.

1449
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:53,531
I like Mr. Barber and Mr. Dexter

1450
01:07:53,565 --> 01:07:56,701
and watching how a film is made,
but...

1451
01:07:56,734 --> 01:07:58,736
I feel a bit let down, too.

1452
01:07:58,771 --> 01:08:00,505
By Miss Dalgleish?

1453
01:08:00,538 --> 01:08:02,507
It sounds stupid, but...

1454
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,409
I thought
we might become friends.

1455
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:07,848
They say it can be a mistake
to meet your favorite stars.

1456
01:08:07,881 --> 01:08:10,549
In this case, they'd be right.

1457
01:08:19,926 --> 01:08:22,595
So do I.

1458
01:08:22,628 --> 01:08:24,164
Are you feeling happy?

1459
01:08:24,197 --> 01:08:26,498
I am, but there's work
to be done.

1460
01:08:26,532 --> 01:08:28,869
And the more hard work involved,
the happier you'll be.

1461
01:08:28,902 --> 01:08:30,736
Well, you know me already.

1462
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:33,807
And, yes, I mean to enjoy
Sybbie's good fortune.

1463
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,474
I want us all to enjoy it.

1464
01:08:35,507 --> 01:08:36,943
Congratulations, Tom.

1465
01:08:36,977 --> 01:08:39,880
You're a leopard who has
successfully changed his spots.

1466
01:08:51,657 --> 01:08:53,026
Ah, he's too fast.

1467
01:08:53,059 --> 01:08:54,895
- Another one.
- Oh, no.

1468
01:08:56,796 --> 01:08:58,731
Where's the ball?

1469
01:08:58,765 --> 01:08:59,866
He's gone.

1470
01:09:00,867 --> 01:09:02,701
Ah, good hit.

1471
01:09:02,735 --> 01:09:04,503
Yes. How's that?

1472
01:09:04,536 --> 01:09:07,740
George should be in bed,
or at least on his way there.

1473
01:09:07,774 --> 01:09:09,642
Do you have other children?

1474
01:09:09,675 --> 01:09:12,879
A daughter, Caroline,
with my second husband.

1475
01:09:12,913 --> 01:09:15,916
George's father was killed in
a car accident seven years ago,

1476
01:09:15,949 --> 01:09:18,651
on the day George was born.

1477
01:09:18,684 --> 01:09:21,620
He held the baby in his arms
and died on the way home.

1478
01:09:21,654 --> 01:09:23,589
My God.

1479
01:09:24,991 --> 01:09:25,992
What was he like?

1480
01:09:26,026 --> 01:09:28,762
He was perfect, really.

1481
01:09:29,996 --> 01:09:32,799
As handsome as a prince
in a fairy tale.

1482
01:09:32,832 --> 01:09:37,636
Moral, strong, full of dreams,
determined to do his bit.

1483
01:09:38,704 --> 01:09:40,807
- Do you miss him?
- Of course.

1484
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,541
Although I sometimes wonder

1485
01:09:42,574 --> 01:09:44,946
what life would've made of him
if he'd lived.

1486
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:46,646
In a way...

1487
01:09:47,848 --> 01:09:49,683
In a way?

1488
01:09:49,716 --> 01:09:52,585
I was going to say, in a way,
you remind me of him.

1489
01:09:52,619 --> 01:09:53,897
Although I couldn't
tell you why.

1490
01:09:53,921 --> 01:09:54,989
I'm flattered.

1491
01:09:55,022 --> 01:09:57,825
What about your present husband?

1492
01:09:57,858 --> 01:09:59,626
Oh, Henry's much more pragmatic.

1493
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:02,562
There are no dreams about him.
He's a doer.

1494
01:10:02,595 --> 01:10:04,265
And he must test
his powers of endurance

1495
01:10:04,298 --> 01:10:05,699
from morning till night.

1496
01:10:05,732 --> 01:10:07,902
But he's a good workmate.

1497
01:10:07,935 --> 01:10:09,270
Is he handsome, too?

1498
01:10:09,303 --> 01:10:11,738
Oh, yes.

1499
01:10:11,772 --> 01:10:13,640
I like them handsome.

1500
01:10:14,909 --> 01:10:17,812
But there's trouble in paradise?

1501
01:10:17,845 --> 01:10:19,512
You don't need me to tell you

1502
01:10:19,546 --> 01:10:23,516
that marriage is a novel,
not a short story.

1503
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,585
Full of plot twists
along the way.

1504
01:10:26,387 --> 01:10:29,290
Suppose it comes down to
whether or not you love him.

1505
01:10:29,323 --> 01:10:30,757
Really, Mr. Barber?

1506
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:32,271
Is this because
you work in the films?

1507
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:35,930
I think I've said more than
enough for one evening.

1508
01:10:37,798 --> 01:10:39,142
So I hope you will warmly

1509
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:40,935
welcome our successors
of the villa.

1510
01:10:40,968 --> 01:10:44,005
And with the Bransons, perhaps
you'll see Lord Grantham,

1511
01:10:44,038 --> 01:10:46,740
whom I think
I may now call my...

1512
01:10:46,774 --> 01:10:47,775
my good friend.

1513
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,829
He's handled it all
with such good manners.

1514
01:11:08,863 --> 01:11:10,663
Because he thinks
I'm his brother.

1515
01:11:10,697 --> 01:11:12,142
For a second there, I thought
he was going to say it.

1516
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:14,701
You can't talk like that.
Your father loved you.

1517
01:11:14,734 --> 01:11:16,113
- Enough.
- But it's not enough, is it?

1518
01:11:16,137 --> 01:11:19,640
Not when I might be a lifelong fraud.

1519
01:11:19,673 --> 01:11:20,942
A Frenchman's bastard

1520
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:23,577
who usurped the role
of the proper heir.

1521
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:25,646
But that would've been
Matthew's father,

1522
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,025
and now Matthew's son
will inherit,

1523
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:29,351
so what difference does it make
in the long run?

1524
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:40,728
I'm afraid
it's a real blow for Papa

1525
01:11:40,762 --> 01:11:42,764
to find he may be an impostor.

1526
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,132
If it's true, he'll be crushed.

1527
01:11:46,634 --> 01:11:48,203
<i>Ma man.</i>

1528
01:11:48,236 --> 01:11:50,372
You know, I've enjoyed
watching you work out here.

1529
01:11:50,405 --> 01:11:52,774
I had a sort of flash of
what you've been missing.

1530
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,176
It seems I'm not quite ready

1531
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:56,144
to say goodbye
to that side of my life.

1532
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,213
I've looked at the miniature,

1533
01:11:58,246 --> 01:11:59,881
Lady Hexham,
and, uh, you're right.

1534
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:02,150
The matter is settled.

1535
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:03,885
Please take it home
for your grandmother.

1536
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:04,886
It's hers anyway.

1537
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,922
<i>Merci.</i>

1538
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,144
Excuse me a moment.

1539
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:34,715
What is it?

1540
01:12:34,748 --> 01:12:36,017
Whatever your secret may be,

1541
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,019
isn't it a good time
to share it with Papa?

1542
01:12:52,767 --> 01:12:55,137
Yeah, it's nothing
compared to the sea.

1543
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,140
- That was beautiful.
- It was...

1544
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:01,444
You've been so gracious, but
it's time for us to go home.

1545
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:03,188
We'll be gone, too, before long.

1546
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,456
As you know,
the contents of the house

1547
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,848
already belong to your mother.

1548
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,159
Oh, you must take
whatever you want.

1549
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:09,751
No. His wishes are clear.

1550
01:13:17,193 --> 01:13:19,728
Well, our lawyers
can manage the rest.

1551
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,998
I know it's late,
but can we go for a walk?

1552
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:24,033
Yes, of course.

1553
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,902
Monsieur, we are in your debt.

1554
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:27,904
Thank you.

1555
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:29,071
- Madame.
- Thank you.

1556
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:06,809
Why didn't you tell me before?

1557
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,820
I was going to, and then
suddenly we were coming here.

1558
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:10,813
But you should never
have come here.

1559
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:12,090
We have to get you
to a proper doctor,

1560
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,325
and I don't mean
some quack in Marseilles.

1561
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:15,151
Dr. Clarks on
is more than capable

1562
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,828
- of coming up with a diagnosis.
- Then we'll go to London.

1563
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,263
We'll-we'll go to America
if we have to.

1564
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,989
We'll discuss it
when we know more.

1565
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:21,090
You should have told me!

1566
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,301
With the chance of a last treat

1567
01:14:22,325 --> 01:14:23,993
before illness
took over our lives?

1568
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:25,228
It may not be as bad as that.

1569
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:27,063
Robert, I've run
the hospital for years.

1570
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:28,307
Do you think I just sat there
with my ears blocked?

1571
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:30,833
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1572
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:32,369
No. No.

1573
01:14:32,402 --> 01:14:34,838
This is not what I wanted
at all.

1574
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:36,940
We're not sad people.

1575
01:14:36,974 --> 01:14:39,776
My being ill now
doesn't make us sad.

1576
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,144
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

1577
01:14:41,178 --> 01:14:45,082
To lose my mother and my name.

1578
01:14:45,115 --> 01:14:47,384
Must I lose you, too?

1579
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:50,120
- I can't bear it.
- If I can bear it, you can.

1580
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:52,389
Remember, I loved you
from the start.

1581
01:14:52,422 --> 01:14:55,792
I loved you before you loved me.

1582
01:14:55,826 --> 01:14:57,261
I've always been ashamed
of that.

1583
01:14:57,294 --> 01:14:59,830
Don't be. I had money.
You needed it.

1584
01:15:01,832 --> 01:15:03,000
And then love came.

1585
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:06,303
And we have been happy,
haven't we?

1586
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:07,771
Oh, darling.

1587
01:15:13,977 --> 01:15:16,013
You have been everything to me.

1588
01:15:17,047 --> 01:15:18,348
Everything.

1589
01:15:18,382 --> 01:15:22,286
And I hope I can be everything
for a while yet.

1590
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:23,987
Now...

1591
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:27,400
- ...we must make an early start tomorrow,
- Oh.

1592
01:15:27,424 --> 01:15:29,159
And it's hours past my bedtime.

1593
01:15:31,061 --> 01:15:32,996
Oh, dear.

1594
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:35,365
Hope we can still get tickets
on the Blue Train.

1595
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:37,167
Oh, yes.

1596
01:16:04,461 --> 01:16:07,097
Why is the camera
in a padded cell?

1597
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:09,067
Anyone would think
it was a lunatic.

1598
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,377
Well, it's certainly
unpredictable.

1599
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:13,204
The microphone
must not pick up any noise

1600
01:16:13,237 --> 01:16:16,341
- unless I have approved it.
- Mm.

1601
01:16:16,374 --> 01:16:20,278
The padded box contains the
sound of the camera working.

1602
01:16:20,311 --> 01:16:22,947
So we're really in
your hands now, Mr. Stubbins.

1603
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,949
Your words, not mine.

1604
01:16:24,982 --> 01:16:26,050
Everyone ready?

1605
01:16:26,084 --> 01:16:27,952
Let's go for a take. And...

1606
01:16:27,985 --> 01:16:31,155
Uh, please be aware
of where the microphones are

1607
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:34,092
and speak clearly.

1608
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:36,461
And, uh, this time, Myrna,
mime but don't talk.

1609
01:16:36,494 --> 01:16:38,463
- Not a word. Do you understand?
- I'm not stupid.

1610
01:16:38,496 --> 01:16:40,164
We only want to hear Lady Mary.

1611
01:16:40,198 --> 01:16:41,366
Mary, please.

1612
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:43,301
Very good.

1613
01:16:43,334 --> 01:16:44,974
Uh, Albert,
you ready with the clap stick?

1614
01:16:47,071 --> 01:16:48,215
Ring the bell.

1615
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,341
Roll the camera.

1616
01:16:52,143 --> 01:16:53,344
Albert.

1617
01:16:55,046 --> 01:16:56,114
And...

1618
01:16:58,082 --> 01:16:59,384
...action.

1619
01:16:59,417 --> 01:17:02,086
<i>Madame, Messieurs,
placez vos Paris.</i>

1620
01:17:04,555 --> 01:17:06,524
Bill.

1621
01:17:06,557 --> 01:17:08,226
You came back.

1622
01:17:08,259 --> 01:17:09,470
I always come back.

1623
01:17:09,494 --> 01:17:11,262
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Cut!

1624
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,398
Uh, everyone,
back to ones, please.

1625
01:17:16,033 --> 01:17:17,201
Roll the camera.

1626
01:17:20,004 --> 01:17:22,306
And... action.

1627
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,942
<i>Madame, Messieurs,
placez vos Paris.</i>

1628
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:28,279
Bill.

1629
01:17:28,312 --> 01:17:29,547
You came back.

1630
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,182
I always come back.

1631
01:17:31,215 --> 01:17:32,517
- Sorry!
- Cut!

1632
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:33,994
But it's just
very difficult for me

1633
01:17:34,018 --> 01:17:35,162
because she's right in me ear!

1634
01:17:35,186 --> 01:17:36,430
And you've got me
coming out a bush!

1635
01:17:36,454 --> 01:17:38,089
I understand. Reset please.

1636
01:17:40,491 --> 01:17:41,526
Bill.

1637
01:17:41,559 --> 01:17:43,127
You came back.

1638
01:17:43,161 --> 01:17:44,562
I always come back.

1639
01:17:44,595 --> 01:17:46,341
- Bloody hell!
- There's no need to swear, is there?

1640
01:17:46,365 --> 01:17:47,409
- Myrna, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Right, that's it.

1641
01:17:47,433 --> 01:17:48,443
- I've had enough.
- Myrna.

1642
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:49,968
You take your hands off me.

1643
01:17:50,002 --> 01:17:51,312
- Get out of my way!
- Myrna, darling!

1644
01:17:51,336 --> 01:17:53,205
No!

1645
01:17:55,307 --> 01:17:57,009
Now what?

1646
01:17:57,042 --> 01:17:59,044
I knew she'd be trouble
right from the start.

1647
01:17:59,077 --> 01:18:00,446
She's rude. She's surly.

1648
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:03,182
True, but now
she also feels humiliated.

1649
01:18:03,215 --> 01:18:06,051
Moving her mouth while Lady
Mary's voice comes out of it.

1650
01:18:06,084 --> 01:18:08,053
And this is
her first sound film.

1651
01:18:08,086 --> 01:18:09,455
What happens to her next?

1652
01:18:09,488 --> 01:18:11,166
I suppose her career's finished.

1653
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:12,500
I suppose a lot of them
are finished.

1654
01:18:12,524 --> 01:18:15,327
The point is they've got
to get her back to work.

1655
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,030
But what if she won't come?
They can't force her.

1656
01:18:18,063 --> 01:18:20,065
Why don't you two have a go?

1657
01:18:20,098 --> 01:18:21,500
You know how to reason with her.

1658
01:18:21,533 --> 01:18:23,035
They don't.

1659
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:29,341
Myrna, darling,
please come down.

1660
01:18:29,374 --> 01:18:31,410
We can't do anything
without you.

1661
01:18:31,443 --> 01:18:32,544
You can talk without me!

1662
01:18:32,578 --> 01:18:34,513
Just go away!

1663
01:18:37,115 --> 01:18:38,250
Milady.

1664
01:18:40,252 --> 01:18:42,387
I think it would be
a good idea to let the maids

1665
01:18:42,421 --> 01:18:44,523
see if they can make her
comfortable, Mr. Barber.

1666
01:18:44,556 --> 01:18:46,358
All right.
If you think so, yeah.

1667
01:18:46,391 --> 01:18:48,427
Stand back, everybody.

1668
01:18:50,529 --> 01:18:52,164
Please let us in,
Miss Dalgleish.

1669
01:18:52,197 --> 01:18:53,641
We understand
what you're going through.

1670
01:18:53,665 --> 01:18:57,269
That's true, and you know it.

1671
01:19:02,074 --> 01:19:03,551
I'm not going down
just so they can humiliate me

1672
01:19:03,575 --> 01:19:05,611
- and laugh at me.
- They won't do that.

1673
01:19:05,644 --> 01:19:08,080
Oh? You should've heard them
at every premiere.

1674
01:19:08,113 --> 01:19:09,491
"Don't speak.
Don't open your mouth."

1675
01:19:09,515 --> 01:19:11,183
They despise me.

1676
01:19:11,216 --> 01:19:12,393
Why didn't you take
elocution lessons?

1677
01:19:12,417 --> 01:19:13,485
Lots of people do.

1678
01:19:13,519 --> 01:19:15,387
I tried. I couldn't get it.

1679
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,155
Couldn't get the knack.

1680
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:19,391
Something's upset you
since the day you got here.

1681
01:19:19,424 --> 01:19:21,393
- What is it?
- It's this.

1682
01:19:21,427 --> 01:19:24,097
I knew I was finished the moment
I saw <i>The Jazz Singer.</i>

1683
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:26,132
It's been like a sword
hanging over me.

1684
01:19:26,165 --> 01:19:27,576
I thought maybe I had
a few more films ahead of me,

1685
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,168
but this one will be me last.

1686
01:19:29,202 --> 01:19:30,403
You don't know that.

1687
01:19:30,436 --> 01:19:31,614
You look good
in the bits I've seen.

1688
01:19:31,638 --> 01:19:33,306
And how do I sound, eh?

1689
01:19:33,339 --> 01:19:35,375
But the fact is I'm washed up,
as the Yanks say.

1690
01:19:35,408 --> 01:19:37,143
I'm yesterday's news.

1691
01:19:39,646 --> 01:19:41,314
Come on, lady.

1692
01:19:41,347 --> 01:19:43,383
You're not talking
to your fan club now.

1693
01:19:43,416 --> 01:19:44,584
What?

1694
01:19:44,617 --> 01:19:47,153
You're famous,
beautiful and rich.

1695
01:19:47,186 --> 01:19:50,156
So what if
your film career is over?

1696
01:19:50,189 --> 01:19:52,358
There's any number of things
you can do.

1697
01:19:52,392 --> 01:19:53,660
Now, dust yourself off.

1698
01:19:53,693 --> 01:19:55,428
And while you're at it,
try being polite

1699
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:58,331
- to the people who serve you.
- Come on, Daisy.

1700
01:19:58,364 --> 01:20:01,200
You're one of us,
not one of them.

1701
01:20:01,234 --> 01:20:03,336
Just remember it.

1702
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:04,671
Now, chop-chop.

1703
01:20:04,704 --> 01:20:06,406
Straighten your hair,
and let's get going.

1704
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:10,143
How you doing in there?

1705
01:20:10,176 --> 01:20:11,656
She's almost ready, Mr. Barber.

1706
01:20:12,745 --> 01:20:15,281
You are, aren't you,
Miss Dalgleish?

1707
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,689
I had a sister
just like you once.

1708
01:20:22,722 --> 01:20:24,257
I miss her.

1709
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:25,391
Every day.

1710
01:20:25,425 --> 01:20:27,327
You remind me of her.

1711
01:20:29,429 --> 01:20:32,398
She died of the Spanish flu
in 1919.

1712
01:20:32,432 --> 01:20:33,910
Didn't think
it would touch our family,

1713
01:20:33,934 --> 01:20:36,235
but you never know, do you?

1714
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:40,273
Shall we go?

1715
01:20:48,247 --> 01:20:50,416
I'm not worth it.

1716
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:52,218
You're worth it to me.

1717
01:20:57,557 --> 01:20:59,393
<i>Rien ne va plus.</i>

1718
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,168
It seems you're my savior.

1719
01:21:08,202 --> 01:21:10,471
And I intend
to remain your savior

1720
01:21:10,504 --> 01:21:12,573
for a very long time to come.

1721
01:21:12,606 --> 01:21:14,341
Mary?

1722
01:21:15,676 --> 01:21:17,378
What on earth is going on?

1723
01:21:17,411 --> 01:21:18,345
Cut!

1724
01:21:18,379 --> 01:21:20,481
Oh, no!

1725
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:24,451
So you put them to rights?

1726
01:21:24,485 --> 01:21:26,186
I think I can say so

1727
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,688
without fear of contradiction.

1728
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:30,324
I left them in no doubt
as to how things are done

1729
01:21:30,357 --> 01:21:31,558
when they are done properly.

1730
01:21:31,592 --> 01:21:32,760
Eh, Mr. Bates?

1731
01:21:32,794 --> 01:21:34,628
Uh, you made
your feelings clear.

1732
01:21:34,662 --> 01:21:36,239
They certainly know
what it is to deal with

1733
01:21:36,263 --> 01:21:37,340
an English butler.

1734
01:21:37,364 --> 01:21:39,667
Oh, get your coats.

1735
01:21:41,301 --> 01:21:43,404
Watching you,
it took me back to the plays

1736
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:45,639
you three used to put on
in the attic.

1737
01:21:45,673 --> 01:21:48,275
Except there's rather more
riding on it this time.

1738
01:21:48,308 --> 01:21:50,678
I don't mean to be harsh, but
how do we know she's any good?

1739
01:21:50,711 --> 01:21:52,212
Oh, she's absolutely superb.

1740
01:21:53,647 --> 01:21:56,350
I showed Granny
Papa's telegram, Tom,

1741
01:21:56,383 --> 01:21:57,651
but you ought to look in.

1742
01:21:57,685 --> 01:21:59,286
Perhaps we should go up now.

1743
01:21:59,319 --> 01:22:00,554
Maybe you're right.

1744
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:02,589
It ought to be you.

1745
01:22:02,623 --> 01:22:04,692
You can give her the miniature.

1746
01:22:07,428 --> 01:22:08,595
What miniature is this?

1747
01:22:08,629 --> 01:22:11,265
It's a long story.

1748
01:22:11,298 --> 01:22:12,633
Talkies must be good news

1749
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:14,468
for the actors
in the West End theaters.

1750
01:22:14,501 --> 01:22:18,405
Good news for them,
bad news for me.

1751
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:20,240
Death by microphone, eh, Guy?

1752
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:22,710
Our business has always been
a game of chance.

1753
01:22:22,743 --> 01:22:24,678
Well said.

1754
01:22:27,849 --> 01:22:31,218
I have an idea, Miss Dalgleish,
which might just help.

1755
01:22:32,486 --> 01:22:33,530
I'm taking your mama
to the hospital

1756
01:22:33,554 --> 01:22:34,565
first thing in the morning.

1757
01:22:34,589 --> 01:22:36,859
I'm dreading it, of course.

1758
01:22:36,892 --> 01:22:39,494
But that's for you to hear,
not her.

1759
01:22:39,527 --> 01:22:42,297
I thought they might
put up more of a fight.

1760
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:43,465
So did we.

1761
01:22:43,498 --> 01:22:45,633
The mother wanted to.

1762
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:47,837
And then Edith found this.

1763
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:50,271
It's inscribed to you
on the side.

1764
01:22:51,073 --> 01:22:52,574
Oh.

1765
01:23:02,785 --> 01:23:04,719
I...

1766
01:23:04,753 --> 01:23:09,357
I suppose they think something
improper went on between us.

1767
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:11,659
- I suppose everyone does.
- Oh, no.

1768
01:23:11,693 --> 01:23:13,762
I-I wouldn't say that.

1769
01:23:13,796 --> 01:23:17,732
You're such a bad liar, Tom.

1770
01:23:17,766 --> 01:23:21,871
I'd never have got anywhere if
I were as rotten a liar as you.

1771
01:23:23,806 --> 01:23:26,641
We're going to try and meet
at the villa every year.

1772
01:23:26,674 --> 01:23:28,844
The whole family together,
in the summer.

1773
01:23:28,878 --> 01:23:31,312
Won't it be too hot?

1774
01:23:31,346 --> 01:23:33,457
- We hope you'll come and find out.
- Oh, no.

1775
01:23:33,481 --> 01:23:35,084
No.

1776
01:23:35,117 --> 01:23:37,719
That's-that's all over for me.

1777
01:23:37,752 --> 01:23:39,789
Never mind.

1778
01:23:39,822 --> 01:23:43,691
I am happy to have
known you, Tom.

1779
01:23:43,725 --> 01:23:46,528
I think we got on pretty well
in the end, don't you?

1780
01:23:46,561 --> 01:23:48,363
I think we did.

1781
01:23:48,396 --> 01:23:49,932
In the end.

1782
01:23:49,965 --> 01:23:52,467
You weren't quite
what we had in mind for Sybil,

1783
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,536
but we got past it.

1784
01:23:54,569 --> 01:23:55,871
And that's life, isn't it?

1785
01:23:55,905 --> 01:23:59,541
Getting past the unexpected.

1786
01:23:59,574 --> 01:24:01,609
And perhaps learning from it,

1787
01:24:01,643 --> 01:24:03,611
which I think we can say
we've done.

1788
01:24:03,645 --> 01:24:06,447
You've been a good friend to me
through the years, Violet.

1789
01:24:06,481 --> 01:24:07,817
I hope I've been
a friend to you.

1790
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:10,752
And now you're settled.

1791
01:24:10,786 --> 01:24:14,858
Maud's back in the family,
and everyone's happy.

1792
01:24:18,862 --> 01:24:20,563
When was the miniature painted?

1793
01:24:20,596 --> 01:24:22,565
Did you sit for it?

1794
01:24:22,598 --> 01:24:26,535
No, we... we went for a walk

1795
01:24:26,569 --> 01:24:28,537
in the town one day,

1796
01:24:28,571 --> 01:24:31,674
and there was a shop where
a man was taking photographs.

1797
01:24:31,707 --> 01:24:33,977
Yeah, I remember 'cause
he was the first photographer

1798
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:35,711
I'd ever seen.

1799
01:24:35,744 --> 01:24:37,513
They must have copied it
from that.

1800
01:24:37,546 --> 01:24:39,850
Montmirail sent it to me
in London

1801
01:24:39,883 --> 01:24:42,384
with a silly scribbled letter.

1802
01:24:42,418 --> 01:24:45,454
I sent it back.

1803
01:24:45,487 --> 01:24:46,923
Of course,
I should have burned it.

1804
01:24:48,657 --> 01:24:50,392
We'll leave you to rest.

1805
01:24:50,426 --> 01:24:52,494
But we wanted to say
how very grateful we are.

1806
01:24:52,528 --> 01:24:53,662
And Sybbie will be, too.

1807
01:24:53,696 --> 01:24:55,899
It's a beautiful place.

1808
01:24:57,766 --> 01:24:59,635
That I do remember.

1809
01:25:19,455 --> 01:25:20,656
Time for bed.

1810
01:25:20,689 --> 01:25:23,559
Yes, I'll just tidy these up.

1811
01:25:23,592 --> 01:25:24,828
What are they?

1812
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:27,563
The letters of
Monsieur de Montmirail.

1813
01:25:27,596 --> 01:25:29,900
Oh. They're clearly labeled?

1814
01:25:29,933 --> 01:25:32,601
I'm afraid so.

1815
01:25:32,635 --> 01:25:34,603
So she was lying

1816
01:25:34,637 --> 01:25:35,882
when she said
she remembers nothing.

1817
01:25:35,906 --> 01:25:37,506
"Lying" is a harsh word.

1818
01:25:37,539 --> 01:25:38,985
Maybe she pushed it
to the back of her mind.

1819
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:40,219
Well, I don't believe
it stayed there

1820
01:25:40,243 --> 01:25:41,677
with all the fuss going on.

1821
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:43,746
- I'll ask when I go and see her.
- Hmm.

1822
01:26:07,071 --> 01:26:08,672
Is this the way
to find Mr. Barrow?

1823
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:10,540
Left.

1824
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,715
- Oh.
- So this is where you hide.

1825
01:26:18,748 --> 01:26:20,750
Can I help with anything, sir?

1826
01:26:20,785 --> 01:26:22,865
Well, you can certainly help
by not calling me "sir."

1827
01:26:24,288 --> 01:26:27,024
I'm not sure
what Mr. Carson would make of

1828
01:26:27,058 --> 01:26:30,593
my receiving a visit from
an upstairs guest, Mr. Dexter.

1829
01:26:30,627 --> 01:26:32,696
Well, Mr. Carson
isn't in charge now.

1830
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:34,098
You are.

1831
01:26:34,131 --> 01:26:37,667
Suppose someone comes in.
What would they say?

1832
01:26:37,701 --> 01:26:39,536
I don't care.

1833
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:41,571
I've lived in America
for ten years now.

1834
01:26:41,604 --> 01:26:43,808
I don't believe
in that stuff anymore.

1835
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:46,911
Please, call me Guy.

1836
01:26:49,146 --> 01:26:51,015
What's your real name?

1837
01:26:51,048 --> 01:26:53,683
Quentin.

1838
01:26:53,717 --> 01:26:55,719
Quentin Sidebotham.

1839
01:26:56,887 --> 01:26:58,588
That was a good decision.

1840
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:02,559
Do you know
what you're doing next?

1841
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:04,661
I don't think anybody does.

1842
01:27:04,694 --> 01:27:07,597
I shall go home
and await developments.

1843
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:09,867
I might call Clive Brook
or Charlie Chaplin,

1844
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:11,068
see what they think.

1845
01:27:12,069 --> 01:27:13,904
You know Charlie Chaplin?

1846
01:27:13,938 --> 01:27:16,307
Well, he's a little wild
for me, but yeah, I-I know him.

1847
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:18,876
Hollywood gets some bad publicity,

1848
01:27:18,909 --> 01:27:20,677
but I live in a place
called Hancock Park,

1849
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:22,980
and it's... it's pretty nice.

1850
01:27:24,349 --> 01:27:26,617
I can believe it.

1851
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:30,122
Well, why don't you come
and see for yourself?

1852
01:27:34,725 --> 01:27:36,328
What?

1853
01:27:36,361 --> 01:27:38,662
I mean it.

1854
01:27:40,932 --> 01:27:42,633
I travel a lot for my work,

1855
01:27:42,666 --> 01:27:45,736
and I don't have a wife
to look after me, so...

1856
01:27:46,737 --> 01:27:48,739
...you could do it.

1857
01:27:49,975 --> 01:27:51,642
I'd be your valet?

1858
01:27:51,675 --> 01:27:54,112
More than that.

1859
01:27:54,146 --> 01:27:57,049
You'd run the house
and organize our journeys,

1860
01:27:57,082 --> 01:27:58,616
make me comfortable.

1861
01:27:59,617 --> 01:28:01,787
Make us both comfortable.

1862
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:03,355
Of course, if my career folds,

1863
01:28:03,388 --> 01:28:04,799
then we'd have to
think again, but...

1864
01:28:04,823 --> 01:28:06,792
Your career won't fold.

1865
01:28:06,825 --> 01:28:08,860
Good.

1866
01:28:08,894 --> 01:28:10,095
Well...

1867
01:28:11,695 --> 01:28:13,731
You let me know when you've...

1868
01:28:13,764 --> 01:28:15,566
come to a decision.

1869
01:28:23,775 --> 01:28:25,844
Right. I have everything I need.

1870
01:28:25,877 --> 01:28:28,113
I will come up to the house
with the results

1871
01:28:28,146 --> 01:28:29,713
as soon as I have them.

1872
01:28:29,747 --> 01:28:31,715
But do you feel optimistic?

1873
01:28:31,749 --> 01:28:33,785
Robert, there's no point
in that sort of talk.

1874
01:28:33,819 --> 01:28:37,655
Lady Grantham knows too much
to pull the wool over her eyes.

1875
01:28:37,688 --> 01:28:40,691
But even if everything is
as bad as it could be,

1876
01:28:40,724 --> 01:28:42,027
there's still a surgery.

1877
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,862
Let's take it
one step at a time.

1878
01:28:43,895 --> 01:28:45,629
Oh, God.

1879
01:28:46,697 --> 01:28:50,402
Robert doesn't see it, but
things could be a lot worse.

1880
01:28:50,435 --> 01:28:52,070
How many have to face
this kind of thing

1881
01:28:52,104 --> 01:28:53,872
feeling they've wasted
their lives?

1882
01:28:53,905 --> 01:28:56,041
I don't.

1883
01:28:56,074 --> 01:28:57,741
Not at all.

1884
01:29:01,147 --> 01:29:02,949
How are things at the farm?

1885
01:29:02,982 --> 01:29:04,117
Cramped.

1886
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:05,750
Poor Mr. Mason.

1887
01:29:05,785 --> 01:29:08,020
He'd be so unhappy
to hear you say it.

1888
01:29:08,788 --> 01:29:11,057
He's been talking
about you lately.

1889
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:12,691
Oh, yes?

1890
01:29:12,724 --> 01:29:14,193
Saying what a fine woman you are

1891
01:29:14,227 --> 01:29:16,229
and how much he admires you.

1892
01:29:16,262 --> 01:29:18,431
Does he? Really?

1893
01:29:18,464 --> 01:29:20,665
But he won't take it
any further.

1894
01:29:20,699 --> 01:29:21,968
Why not?

1895
01:29:22,001 --> 01:29:24,736
Because he can't ask you
to live at the farm

1896
01:29:24,769 --> 01:29:26,806
and he couldn't be dependent
on a woman.

1897
01:29:26,839 --> 01:29:28,673
Oh, couldn't he?

1898
01:29:28,707 --> 01:29:30,176
We'll see about that.

1899
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,715
Look what we've found.

1900
01:29:36,748 --> 01:29:38,918
When I was going through
Violet's things.

1901
01:29:39,886 --> 01:29:42,021
"The letters of
the Marquis de Montmirail."

1902
01:29:42,054 --> 01:29:43,122
Oh, dear.

1903
01:29:43,156 --> 01:29:44,756
It doesn't look good for Papa

1904
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:46,792
if she felt the need
to keep it a secret.

1905
01:29:46,826 --> 01:29:48,227
Well, let's not jump the gun.

1906
01:29:48,261 --> 01:29:49,872
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you
in the middle of something?

1907
01:29:49,896 --> 01:29:51,264
No, no.

1908
01:29:51,297 --> 01:29:52,198
Could I speak to you alone
for a moment, please?

1909
01:29:52,231 --> 01:29:53,765
Yes.

1910
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,135
So what happens now?

1911
01:29:56,169 --> 01:29:58,070
Well, I thought
we could read them together.

1912
01:29:58,104 --> 01:30:00,840
Bertie, you and I can do it and
report back what they contain.

1913
01:30:00,873 --> 01:30:04,676
And we'll break the news
to Papa.

1914
01:30:10,349 --> 01:30:12,852
What is it?

1915
01:30:12,885 --> 01:30:14,153
You have to help me.

1916
01:30:14,187 --> 01:30:16,789
We're just about to film
our last set piece,

1917
01:30:16,822 --> 01:30:19,125
the-the dinner when Benson
realizes he must give her up

1918
01:30:19,158 --> 01:30:20,725
and rushes off to London.

1919
01:30:20,759 --> 01:30:22,004
I know.
I've just been learning it.

1920
01:30:22,028 --> 01:30:24,729
Molesley's done a wonderful job.

1921
01:30:24,763 --> 01:30:27,133
I told you the extras were
fed up with not being paid,

1922
01:30:27,166 --> 01:30:28,801
and I don't blame them,

1923
01:30:28,834 --> 01:30:30,803
but I'm still waiting
for the money.

1924
01:30:30,836 --> 01:30:32,147
Well, they won't do
anything too drastic.

1925
01:30:32,171 --> 01:30:33,506
Won't they?

1926
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:35,775
They say they're not
coming into work.

1927
01:30:35,808 --> 01:30:37,244
But how can I help?

1928
01:30:38,245 --> 01:30:42,983
Could your servants stand in?

1929
01:30:43,984 --> 01:30:45,185
You're welcome to ask them.

1930
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,162
Is there something else,
Mr. Barber?

1931
01:30:56,163 --> 01:30:59,032
I could never have got through
any of this without you.

1932
01:31:00,033 --> 01:31:02,970
If that's true, then I'm glad.

1933
01:31:05,572 --> 01:31:07,174
May I kiss you?

1934
01:31:10,978 --> 01:31:12,079
No.

1935
01:31:12,112 --> 01:31:14,348
Don't you want to?

1936
01:31:16,049 --> 01:31:18,852
I'm afraid I'm too
old-fashioned to believe

1937
01:31:18,885 --> 01:31:22,155
that what I want is
the only thing that matters.

1938
01:31:23,857 --> 01:31:26,994
- Have I offended you?
- Not at all.

1939
01:31:27,027 --> 01:31:29,263
Nothing is nicer
for an old married woman

1940
01:31:29,296 --> 01:31:31,932
than to find she's still
an object of desire.

1941
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,111
Well, you better not tell
your husband when he gets back.

1942
01:31:35,135 --> 01:31:37,104
He might, uh,
hit me on the nose.

1943
01:31:37,137 --> 01:31:38,572
Mm, wouldn't that be thrilling?

1944
01:31:38,605 --> 01:31:41,141
Two gorgeous men
fighting for my favors.

1945
01:31:44,444 --> 01:31:46,179
You rang, milady?

1946
01:31:46,213 --> 01:31:49,349
- So she'd kept his letters?
- Seemingly. Every one.

1947
01:31:49,383 --> 01:31:51,018
I won't ask
what she had to hide,

1948
01:31:51,051 --> 01:31:52,586
in case you tell me the answer.

1949
01:31:52,619 --> 01:31:54,955
Well, most of them
are rather sad.

1950
01:31:54,988 --> 01:31:58,292
There was clearly no love lost
between him and his wife.

1951
01:31:58,325 --> 01:31:59,960
But what do they tell us about

1952
01:31:59,993 --> 01:32:01,895
the days they spent together
in France?

1953
01:32:01,928 --> 01:32:03,239
I'm afraid that they didn't
write to each other then.

1954
01:32:03,263 --> 01:32:07,000
So we still have no proof
of what really happened.

1955
01:32:07,034 --> 01:32:08,268
I suppose that is

1956
01:32:08,302 --> 01:32:09,936
where the mystery resides.

1957
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:12,005
I'll come and see
Violet tomorrow.

1958
01:32:12,039 --> 01:32:14,175
Should I do it?

1959
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,943
No.

1960
01:32:15,977 --> 01:32:18,913
You're what the lawyers call
"an interested party."

1961
01:32:18,946 --> 01:32:20,915
I'm not.

1962
01:32:23,084 --> 01:32:25,053
You mean we'd be up there
on the screen

1963
01:32:25,086 --> 01:32:26,397
with Miss Dalgleish
and Mr. Dexter?

1964
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:28,132
Are you sure?

1965
01:32:28,156 --> 01:32:29,867
- That's exactly what I mean.
- Well, I'll do it.

1966
01:32:29,891 --> 01:32:31,225
Mm, so will Mr. Carson.

1967
01:32:32,493 --> 01:32:34,162
Mr. Molesley
will want to join in.

1968
01:32:34,195 --> 01:32:35,239
- How many do you need?
- Uh, we need ten.

1969
01:32:35,263 --> 01:32:36,407
Miss Denker, are you up for it?

1970
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:37,965
Certainly not.

1971
01:32:37,999 --> 01:32:39,476
I want to keep an eye
on Her Ladyship.

1972
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,336
- What about Mr. Mason?
- I could always ask.

1973
01:32:41,369 --> 01:32:43,237
No, hurry to the farm
and ask him now.

1974
01:32:43,271 --> 01:32:44,939
And they've got costumes for us?

1975
01:32:44,972 --> 01:32:46,216
Oh, well,
they'll need time to fit them,

1976
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,975
so you should
go upstairs to wardrobe

1977
01:32:48,009 --> 01:32:49,086
before the end of the day.

1978
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:50,378
What about servants?

1979
01:32:50,411 --> 01:32:52,447
Who's going to wait on us?

1980
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,282
Well, I was thinking
we could use Albert.

1981
01:32:54,315 --> 01:32:56,160
Would I be serving Miss Dalgleish?

1982
01:32:56,184 --> 01:32:58,252
- I suppose so.
- Oh, well...

1983
01:32:58,286 --> 01:33:00,988
Right, let's get back to work, please!

1984
01:33:01,022 --> 01:33:03,024
- All right, come on now.
- Come along.

1985
01:33:05,026 --> 01:33:08,196
<i>Filming must be the
slowest occupation known to man.</i>

1986
01:33:08,229 --> 01:33:10,098
It makes a glacier
look impatient.

1987
01:33:10,131 --> 01:33:12,367
I suppose Robert's in hell.

1988
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:16,104
He was longing for it all to be
over by the time they got back.

1989
01:33:16,137 --> 01:33:19,006
You could ease his pain
if you wish.

1990
01:33:20,341 --> 01:33:23,244
We found the letters
of Monsieur de Montmirail.

1991
01:33:23,277 --> 01:33:26,280
But Robert still doesn't have
the answer he needs.

1992
01:33:27,448 --> 01:33:30,118
I won't pretend
not to understand you.

1993
01:33:30,151 --> 01:33:31,986
Did they tell you
about the miniature?

1994
01:33:32,019 --> 01:33:33,488
What's its significance?

1995
01:33:33,521 --> 01:33:35,189
Well, could you fetch it?

1996
01:33:35,223 --> 01:33:37,959
It's in the bottom
right-hand drawer.

1997
01:33:37,992 --> 01:33:39,327
If you open it at the back,

1998
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,330
you'll find the letter
he sent with it.

1999
01:33:42,363 --> 01:33:46,434
It's still there
after all this time.

2000
01:33:47,435 --> 01:33:49,036
Could you read it?

2001
01:33:54,576 --> 01:33:57,413
<i>"Chère Violette,</i>
we have missed the chance

2002
01:33:57,446 --> 01:33:59,381
"to know perfect love.

2003
01:34:01,116 --> 01:34:06,188
But we still can if you would
only change your mind."

2004
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:09,191
Why didn't you just tell us?

2005
01:34:10,759 --> 01:34:13,562
There was nothing to tell.

2006
01:34:13,595 --> 01:34:15,130
Nothing happened.

2007
01:34:15,164 --> 01:34:17,332
Apart from years
of being pestered.

2008
01:34:17,366 --> 01:34:19,034
Well, no.

2009
01:34:19,067 --> 01:34:21,003
That's not quite right.

2010
01:34:21,036 --> 01:34:22,471
Then what is?

2011
01:34:22,504 --> 01:34:25,174
I never saw him after that.

2012
01:34:25,207 --> 01:34:27,042
I knew I'd have given in.

2013
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:31,480
If I'd been tested again,
I would have failed.

2014
01:34:32,581 --> 01:34:34,283
Oh.

2015
01:34:34,316 --> 01:34:37,352
I was a fool for love
in those days.

2016
01:34:37,386 --> 01:34:40,155
A few years later,
we went to Russia,

2017
01:34:40,189 --> 01:34:42,991
and I got into terrible trouble.

2018
01:34:43,025 --> 01:34:44,560
Well, I nearly did.

2019
01:34:44,593 --> 01:34:47,329
With Prince Kuragin.
Yes, I know.

2020
01:34:47,362 --> 01:34:49,465
How did you avoid it
with the marquis?

2021
01:34:49,498 --> 01:34:51,133
I can't think.

2022
01:34:51,166 --> 01:34:54,203
He was the most attractive man
I'd ever met

2023
01:34:54,236 --> 01:34:57,139
in my life.

2024
01:34:57,172 --> 01:34:58,775
But I hadn't long been married,

2025
01:34:58,808 --> 01:35:02,377
and it must have seemed a
shame, you know, to spoil that.

2026
01:35:03,479 --> 01:35:05,447
I wish you'd said all this.

2027
01:35:05,481 --> 01:35:07,425
I didn't want you to think
my life had been a fraud,

2028
01:35:07,449 --> 01:35:09,051
when it hasn't.

2029
01:35:09,084 --> 01:35:11,587
I was happy
with Robert's father.

2030
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:15,190
Well, happy enough
in that English way,

2031
01:35:15,224 --> 01:35:19,561
when you never talk
about anything

2032
01:35:19,595 --> 01:35:21,630
but you trust each other.

2033
01:35:21,663 --> 01:35:26,102
If they'd put Kuragin
and Montmirail together,

2034
01:35:26,135 --> 01:35:29,606
I would have come out
as some sort of scarlet woman.

2035
01:35:31,274 --> 01:35:33,276
You don't seem
very scarlet to me.

2036
01:35:33,309 --> 01:35:35,445
Well, I'm trusting you

2037
01:35:35,478 --> 01:35:40,016
to make sure
that's not how I'm remembered.

2038
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:44,320
Well, the next earl
will be Matthew's son,

2039
01:35:44,354 --> 01:35:47,524
my grandson,
your great-grandson.

2040
01:35:47,557 --> 01:35:50,426
I'll do my best
to see he values you.

2041
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:53,162
I know you will.

2042
01:35:53,196 --> 01:35:56,533
I know I can trust you
to do the right thing.

2043
01:35:56,566 --> 01:35:58,301
That's very generous of you.

2044
01:35:58,334 --> 01:36:00,570
Well, because we've had
our tussles, you and I.

2045
01:36:00,603 --> 01:36:05,408
Well, it's true, but
I'm glad you came to Down ton.

2046
01:36:05,441 --> 01:36:09,145
I'd never known anyone
whose opinion I could trust,

2047
01:36:09,178 --> 01:36:12,649
you know, to be morally right,
not for years.

2048
01:36:12,682 --> 01:36:16,119
Well, not since my mother died.

2049
01:36:16,152 --> 01:36:18,121
You must have wondered
why I asked you

2050
01:36:18,154 --> 01:36:19,422
to go through my papers.

2051
01:36:19,455 --> 01:36:21,457
I did rather.

2052
01:36:21,491 --> 01:36:25,562
When I think about that world
of long ago,

2053
01:36:25,595 --> 01:36:30,600
when I... I was a girl
in my first crinoline...

2054
01:36:32,669 --> 01:36:37,273
...in those moments, I feel
as if I've been transported

2055
01:36:37,307 --> 01:36:41,144
to a different planet.

2056
01:36:41,177 --> 01:36:43,680
And so you have been.

2057
01:36:43,713 --> 01:36:46,549
Like every human being
who lives long enough.

2058
01:36:46,583 --> 01:36:49,252
And I have. Lived long enough.

2059
01:36:49,285 --> 01:36:52,589
Oh, I didn't mean it like that.

2060
01:37:05,469 --> 01:37:07,171
I'm sorry,
but I just couldn't wait.

2061
01:37:07,204 --> 01:37:08,706
It's all right.

2062
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:10,474
Nothing happened.

2063
01:37:10,507 --> 01:37:12,710
You're your father's son.

2064
01:37:16,647 --> 01:37:18,649
I can't pretend
I'm not relieved.

2065
01:37:18,682 --> 01:37:21,285
I can't pretend
I'm not insulted.

2066
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:25,155
Why do you think
he gave you the villa

2067
01:37:25,189 --> 01:37:27,424
if it has nothing to do
with my birth?

2068
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:29,928
I think it had everything
to do with your birth.

2069
01:37:29,961 --> 01:37:33,163
When you were born,
it sent a message

2070
01:37:33,197 --> 01:37:36,233
that what he wanted
was never going to happen

2071
01:37:36,266 --> 01:37:38,569
and it was time to move on.

2072
01:37:38,602 --> 01:37:41,405
He never loved his wife
as he loved you.

2073
01:37:41,438 --> 01:37:42,673
The villa proves that.

2074
01:37:43,808 --> 01:37:45,409
Well...

2075
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:48,712
...that's not for me to say.

2076
01:37:54,752 --> 01:37:57,154
- Yeah.
- Right.

2077
01:37:57,822 --> 01:38:00,157
Ooh.

2078
01:38:04,829 --> 01:38:06,630
I looked through
the final scenes.

2079
01:38:06,664 --> 01:38:08,232
I'm impressed.

2080
01:38:08,265 --> 01:38:09,309
Does this kind of work
appeal to you,

2081
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:11,435
writing plays for the screen?

2082
01:38:11,468 --> 01:38:12,804
What, you-you mean...

2083
01:38:12,837 --> 01:38:14,672
Well, say, four a year.

2084
01:38:14,705 --> 01:38:16,707
I'd send you the book
or short story I was keen on

2085
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,475
with my notes and suggestions.

2086
01:38:18,509 --> 01:38:22,413
Um, I would pay 700 guineas
against a thousand.

2087
01:38:22,446 --> 01:38:23,514
Mr. Barber.

2088
01:38:23,547 --> 01:38:24,816
Sorry?

2089
01:38:24,849 --> 01:38:26,818
Uh, you'd get 700
for writing the script.

2090
01:38:26,851 --> 01:38:29,720
That would rise to a thousand
if the film is made.

2091
01:38:33,323 --> 01:38:34,725
For each script?

2092
01:38:39,431 --> 01:38:42,267
I feel like the queen.

2093
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,270
Well, I don't envy her if these
corsets are anything to go by.

2094
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:51,710
- This is absurd.
- Cheer up.

2095
01:38:51,743 --> 01:38:54,612
After all, you should be
used to the costume.

2096
01:38:55,413 --> 01:38:57,716
We've put the names
on the places, so, please,

2097
01:38:57,749 --> 01:38:59,651
all of you,
find your chair and sit.

2098
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:02,855
Uh, Mr. Carson, you will be
playing Lord Pumphrey

2099
01:39:02,888 --> 01:39:05,390
at the head of the table.

2100
01:39:05,423 --> 01:39:07,592
Seems odd to be sitting in here.

2101
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:09,661
You've spent enough time
standing.

2102
01:39:12,397 --> 01:39:14,699
I'd say you've spent
long enough.

2103
01:39:14,733 --> 01:39:16,768
You may be right, Mr. Dexter.

2104
01:39:16,802 --> 01:39:20,705
Tell me, did your offer mean
what I think it did?

2105
01:39:20,739 --> 01:39:23,575
It can mean as little
or as much as you like.

2106
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:26,611
I'd like it to mean
a great deal.

2107
01:39:27,612 --> 01:39:29,547
Then you're in luck.

2108
01:39:37,655 --> 01:39:40,258
- Mrs. Hughes.
- Thank you.

2109
01:39:42,795 --> 01:39:44,496
This is you.

2110
01:39:44,529 --> 01:39:46,765
I don't recognize you.

2111
01:39:46,799 --> 01:39:49,467
And...

2112
01:39:50,635 --> 01:39:52,337
Oh, no, no, really.

2113
01:39:52,370 --> 01:39:53,906
Please, we're not here.

2114
01:39:53,939 --> 01:39:56,299
My Lord, if-if you could make
your way up behind the camera.

2115
01:39:57,810 --> 01:39:58,810
Thank you.

2116
01:40:03,548 --> 01:40:04,548
Oh.

2117
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:08,586
I look like something
to scare the crows.

2118
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:09,687
Nonsense.

2119
01:40:09,721 --> 01:40:12,323
You're a picture of elegance.

2120
01:40:12,357 --> 01:40:15,661
Now, sit down here
and have something warming.

2121
01:40:15,694 --> 01:40:18,330
I thought
it were just colored water.

2122
01:40:18,364 --> 01:40:19,900
Well, so it is for the others.

2123
01:40:19,933 --> 01:40:23,804
For us, I've smuggled in
something nice.

2124
01:40:23,837 --> 01:40:25,906
Oh, you're right. This is good.

2125
01:40:27,808 --> 01:40:30,409
Don't the young
couple look nice together?

2126
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:32,745
It must be wonderful
to feel you're helping them.

2127
01:40:32,779 --> 01:40:34,747
I'd like to do more.

2128
01:40:34,781 --> 01:40:36,749
Well, this is what
I want to talk about.

2129
01:40:45,992 --> 01:40:48,561
You're not nervous?

2130
01:40:48,594 --> 01:40:49,896
Well, how should a man feel

2131
01:40:49,930 --> 01:40:53,465
when all his dreams
have come true?

2132
01:40:53,499 --> 01:40:54,901
All your dreams?

2133
01:40:54,935 --> 01:40:58,138
I-I know, but, you see,
Miss Baxter...

2134
01:40:58,171 --> 01:40:59,538
Phyllis.

2135
01:41:00,539 --> 01:41:01,808
Phyllis.

2136
01:41:01,842 --> 01:41:04,476
I felt ashamed.

2137
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:06,512
The best I could offer
was a poor life

2138
01:41:06,545 --> 01:41:07,781
on a schoolmaster's salary.

2139
01:41:07,814 --> 01:41:09,883
I'd have taken it.

2140
01:41:12,185 --> 01:41:14,753
But now you won't have to.

2141
01:41:14,788 --> 01:41:17,756
I'm gonna write plays
to be made into films.

2142
01:41:17,791 --> 01:41:18,925
For Mr. Barber?

2143
01:41:18,959 --> 01:41:20,726
For Mr. Barber now,

2144
01:41:20,759 --> 01:41:22,671
but who knows what'll happen
if I'm any good at it.

2145
01:41:22,695 --> 01:41:24,739
Uh, it's gonna
be talking films from now on.

2146
01:41:24,763 --> 01:41:26,632
Oh, what the blazes?

2147
01:41:26,665 --> 01:41:28,400
And these will pay?

2148
01:41:29,702 --> 01:41:31,503
For the first time,

2149
01:41:31,537 --> 01:41:35,741
I can offer
a decent prosperous life.

2150
01:41:35,774 --> 01:41:37,743
For the both of us.

2151
01:41:37,776 --> 01:41:39,712
So what do you say?

2152
01:41:42,481 --> 01:41:43,817
Are you not going to kneel?

2153
01:41:48,487 --> 01:41:50,656
- Do you want me to?
- I think so.

2154
01:41:50,689 --> 01:41:52,759
It'll never happen again.

2155
01:41:54,694 --> 01:41:56,730
Right then, um...

2156
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:01,869
Will you marry me, Miss Baxter?

2157
01:42:01,903 --> 01:42:04,504
I mean, Phyllis.

2158
01:42:06,539 --> 01:42:08,708
Yes!

2159
01:42:08,742 --> 01:42:11,444
I jolly well will,
Mr. Molesley.

2160
01:42:21,755 --> 01:42:23,523
Congratulations.

2161
01:42:23,556 --> 01:42:25,725
- Well done.
- Well done, Mr. Molesley.

2162
01:42:26,961 --> 01:42:29,529
Well done, Mr. Molesley.

2163
01:42:29,562 --> 01:42:31,041
Settle down, everyone, please.

2164
01:42:31,065 --> 01:42:32,532
Let's go for a first take.

2165
01:42:32,565 --> 01:42:33,700
Say it again.

2166
01:42:33,733 --> 01:42:35,903
Barkis is willing.

2167
01:42:35,937 --> 01:42:37,939
Oh, Mr. Mason.

2168
01:42:37,972 --> 01:42:40,607
And you'll be content to live
in my little cottage?

2169
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,776
Unless you think it's wrong.

2170
01:42:42,810 --> 01:42:44,678
I most certainly do not.

2171
01:42:44,711 --> 01:42:46,546
And now the young ones
can have the farm?

2172
01:42:46,579 --> 01:42:47,848
I'll surrender the lease.

2173
01:42:47,882 --> 01:42:49,784
Oh, well, I'll drink to that.

2174
01:42:50,985 --> 01:42:52,752
- Right, and if we can...
- Remember!

2175
01:42:52,787 --> 01:42:56,257
Clarity, diction
and keep your heads still.

2176
01:42:56,290 --> 01:42:58,092
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2177
01:42:58,125 --> 01:42:59,726
Roll the camera.

2178
01:43:02,029 --> 01:43:03,463
And action.

2179
01:43:07,034 --> 01:43:08,702
Where are you going?

2180
01:43:08,735 --> 01:43:10,670
Back to London.

2181
01:43:10,704 --> 01:43:12,840
What? You can't.

2182
01:43:12,873 --> 01:43:14,674
I can and I must.

2183
01:43:14,708 --> 01:43:16,877
If I stay, darling Anne,

2184
01:43:16,911 --> 01:43:18,778
I'll destroy you
along with myself.

2185
01:43:18,813 --> 01:43:19,880
Can't you see?

2186
01:43:20,881 --> 01:43:22,049
Oh.

2187
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:23,126
We'll fight it together.

2188
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:24,751
No, we won't.

2189
01:43:24,785 --> 01:43:26,096
I'm the worthless one.
I'm the exile.

2190
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,721
I'm the lost soul.

2191
01:43:27,754 --> 01:43:29,523
Now let me go!

2192
01:43:35,797 --> 01:43:37,933
Bill, please wait.

2193
01:43:37,966 --> 01:43:40,534
He's broken her heart.

2194
01:43:40,568 --> 01:43:41,736
Chap's a cad.

2195
01:43:41,769 --> 01:43:42,871
And cut.

2196
01:43:47,809 --> 01:43:51,046
Bravo.

2197
01:43:54,116 --> 01:43:56,018
Bravo.

2198
01:44:00,188 --> 01:44:02,057
The buffet in the hall
is ready, milady.

2199
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:03,090
Thank you, Barrow.

2200
01:44:05,827 --> 01:44:08,163
Milady, I wonder
if I might have a word.

2201
01:44:08,196 --> 01:44:09,764
Of course.

2202
01:44:10,866 --> 01:44:12,901
I'd like to hand in my notice.

2203
01:44:12,934 --> 01:44:13,935
Oh.

2204
01:44:15,203 --> 01:44:18,340
Well, I know you haven't
always been happy here.

2205
01:44:18,373 --> 01:44:21,575
Oh, it's not that, milady.
I've had good years at Down ton.

2206
01:44:21,609 --> 01:44:23,111
But I've formed a sort of...

2207
01:44:23,145 --> 01:44:25,646
Well, I'm not sure
what it is, really...

2208
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:28,183
A working friendship
with Mr. Dexter.

2209
01:44:28,216 --> 01:44:30,352
- Guy?
- That's it, milady.

2210
01:44:30,385 --> 01:44:31,887
And we mean to travel together.

2211
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,655
He'll make films,
and I'll look after him.

2212
01:44:34,688 --> 01:44:37,192
I'll be his dresser,
as the film people put it.

2213
01:44:37,225 --> 01:44:39,961
And if I'm right...

2214
01:44:39,995 --> 01:44:42,730
then it's the nearest I've come

2215
01:44:42,763 --> 01:44:45,699
to the offer
of an honest way of life.

2216
01:44:47,768 --> 01:44:49,737
You don't need
to explain, Barrow.

2217
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:51,807
I wish you well.

2218
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,976
And I hope you'll be as happy
as our cruel world allows.

2219
01:44:56,111 --> 01:44:57,913
Thank you, milady.

2220
01:45:08,224 --> 01:45:10,226
Well?

2221
01:45:10,259 --> 01:45:12,028
I've done it.

2222
01:45:13,963 --> 01:45:14,964
Good.

2223
01:45:19,869 --> 01:45:21,880
We're all wondering if you'll
miss your acting career.

2224
01:45:21,904 --> 01:45:23,906
Oh, please say yes.
Come up to London.

2225
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:25,674
- We'll find you a part.
- No, thank you.

2226
01:45:25,707 --> 01:45:29,078
I've enjoyed it, in fact,
but once will suffice.

2227
01:45:29,112 --> 01:45:31,948
Can I help you, Miss Dalgleish?

2228
01:45:31,981 --> 01:45:33,983
Um, I'd love some of that ham,

2229
01:45:34,016 --> 01:45:37,019
if you can reach it,
and a little sauce.

2230
01:45:38,221 --> 01:45:40,755
What's happened to your voice?

2231
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:41,791
What do you mean?

2232
01:45:41,824 --> 01:45:43,826
Well, you've lost the ghastly...

2233
01:45:46,295 --> 01:45:48,264
Of course, I didn't mean
"ghastly," exactly.

2234
01:45:48,297 --> 01:45:49,932
She's a natural.

2235
01:45:49,966 --> 01:45:51,801
Well, Lady Grantham thinks

2236
01:45:51,834 --> 01:45:54,203
I can go to Hollywood
and just be an American.

2237
01:45:54,237 --> 01:45:56,205
Well, why shouldn't you?

2238
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:57,874
Come along, Bertie.

2239
01:45:59,774 --> 01:46:00,910
Would you excuse me?

2240
01:46:00,943 --> 01:46:03,246
I, um, I just want
to go downstairs.

2241
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:04,779
Thank you.

2242
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:07,749
Why is she so nice
all of a sudden?

2243
01:46:07,783 --> 01:46:09,027
Oh, it's simple.
She's not afraid anymore.

2244
01:46:09,051 --> 01:46:10,086
Mm-hmm.

2245
01:46:12,088 --> 01:46:15,724
You do know that
I'm completely mad about you?

2246
01:46:15,757 --> 01:46:17,193
Dear Mr. Barber,

2247
01:46:17,226 --> 01:46:19,661
I can't give you what you want.

2248
01:46:20,662 --> 01:46:24,666
But I can say that I've loved
working with you.

2249
01:46:25,334 --> 01:46:27,203
And I must be content with that.

2250
01:46:27,236 --> 01:46:28,770
It's all you're going to get.

2251
01:46:30,173 --> 01:46:32,141
I'm mainly glad to be
my father's son

2252
01:46:32,175 --> 01:46:33,910
because I loved him.

2253
01:46:33,943 --> 01:46:36,979
It matters more to me
than all the dynastic stuff.

2254
01:46:37,013 --> 01:46:39,015
And so it should.

2255
01:46:39,048 --> 01:46:41,919
I'm happy for Sybbie, as long
as she learns how to pay back.

2256
01:46:41,952 --> 01:46:43,029
You don't believe
in the idle rich?

2257
01:46:43,053 --> 01:46:44,288
I believe in them.

2258
01:46:44,321 --> 01:46:45,222
I just don't want
any member of my family

2259
01:46:45,255 --> 01:46:46,790
to be one of them.

2260
01:46:46,823 --> 01:46:48,001
That sounds good to me.

2261
01:46:48,025 --> 01:46:49,759
I think I'll have another cup.

2262
01:46:49,793 --> 01:46:51,828
Excuse me.

2263
01:46:55,365 --> 01:46:58,302
Does that include any
future member of your family?

2264
01:46:58,335 --> 01:47:01,104
Well, yes, of course, becau...

2265
01:47:04,541 --> 01:47:06,343
It's early days,
so don't say anything yet.

2266
01:47:06,376 --> 01:47:09,079
Oh, my darling,
I won't say a word.

2267
01:47:09,112 --> 01:47:11,215
But I think that I can kiss you.

2268
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:15,319
Dr. Clarks on
has arrived, milord.

2269
01:47:17,955 --> 01:47:20,324
I notice you're very friendly
with the handsome Mr. Barber.

2270
01:47:20,357 --> 01:47:22,125
Don't start.

2271
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:25,963
I've kept myself out of trouble
and I've been good.

2272
01:47:25,996 --> 01:47:28,165
With some difficulty,
I might add.

2273
01:47:28,932 --> 01:47:31,368
It is not
what you were dreading.

2274
01:47:31,401 --> 01:47:34,271
Pernicious anemia is
often mistaken for cancer.

2275
01:47:34,304 --> 01:47:36,106
And until a few years ago,

2276
01:47:36,139 --> 01:47:38,242
it might well have
finished you off.

2277
01:47:38,275 --> 01:47:40,077
But there is now treatment.

2278
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:41,321
- Oh.
- Oh, thank God.

2279
01:47:41,345 --> 01:47:43,280
It won't be
particularly enjoyable,

2280
01:47:43,313 --> 01:47:45,382
but you will get better
and you won't die.

2281
01:47:45,415 --> 01:47:48,318
Well, thank you, Dr. Clarks on.

2282
01:47:49,886 --> 01:47:51,855
Thank you very, very, very much.

2283
01:47:51,888 --> 01:47:53,857
Yes, thank you.

2284
01:47:53,890 --> 01:47:55,335
Now, you must come in
and have some supper.

2285
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:57,961
But it's very much
catch-as-catch-can tonight.

2286
01:47:57,995 --> 01:47:59,372
All the servants
are film stars now.

2287
01:47:59,396 --> 01:48:01,031
I doubt we'll ever get them back

2288
01:48:01,064 --> 01:48:02,075
behind the green baize door.

2289
01:48:02,099 --> 01:48:03,200
Oh, milord!

2290
01:48:03,233 --> 01:48:05,135
Milady! Come quickly!

2291
01:48:05,168 --> 01:48:07,871
Please, quickly!

2292
01:48:07,904 --> 01:48:08,905
Doctor.

2293
01:48:10,907 --> 01:48:12,075
Say it again.

2294
01:48:12,109 --> 01:48:13,944
Talk in that voice.

2295
01:48:13,977 --> 01:48:17,014
I just
wanna say how grateful I am.

2296
01:48:17,047 --> 01:48:20,151
You both licked me into shape
when I needed it.

2297
01:48:20,184 --> 01:48:22,020
Thank you.

2298
01:48:22,053 --> 01:48:23,297
- So you'll go to Hollywood now?
- Why not?

2299
01:48:23,321 --> 01:48:25,123
I've no family to hold me here.

2300
01:48:25,156 --> 01:48:26,958
And I've done a talkie now,

2301
01:48:26,991 --> 01:48:29,894
which puts me ahead
of the race, I hope.

2302
01:48:29,927 --> 01:48:32,163
Just don't forget who you are
or where you've come from.

2303
01:48:32,196 --> 01:48:34,265
But don't let it
hold you back either.

2304
01:48:34,299 --> 01:48:35,433
And good luck.

2305
01:48:37,168 --> 01:48:38,202
Come here.

2306
01:48:44,275 --> 01:48:46,277
Old Lady Grantham's
sinking fast.

2307
01:48:46,311 --> 01:48:48,046
They're upstairs with her now.

2308
01:48:48,079 --> 01:48:51,316
Get some coffee or something
stronger just in case.

2309
01:48:56,421 --> 01:48:59,357
Charlie, are you all right?

2310
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:01,092
What did King Lear say?

2311
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:05,396
"Blow, winds,
and crack your cheeks.

2312
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:10,268
Rage, blow, you cataracts
and hurricanoes."

2313
01:49:13,171 --> 01:49:17,108
Has the moment
of her leaving come at last?

2314
01:49:17,141 --> 01:49:19,110
Oh.

2315
01:49:20,244 --> 01:49:25,016
That so great a lady should go

2316
01:49:25,049 --> 01:49:29,253
when the house
is full of film people.

2317
01:49:39,997 --> 01:49:41,065
Maud.

2318
01:49:43,101 --> 01:49:45,370
What are you doing here?

2319
01:49:45,403 --> 01:49:49,240
Well, you won't believe me,
but I sh... I shall miss you.

2320
01:49:49,273 --> 01:49:52,276
Or have you just come to check
I'm on the way out?

2321
01:49:54,145 --> 01:49:55,314
Is there anything you want?

2322
01:49:57,082 --> 01:50:01,687
Whatever I have wanted,
dearest boy,

2323
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,056
you have given me
long before now

2324
01:50:04,089 --> 01:50:07,092
and many times over.

2325
01:50:07,126 --> 01:50:12,297
Dear Mama, I hope I haven't
been a disappointment.

2326
01:50:12,331 --> 01:50:14,266
You were always
so much cleverer than me.

2327
01:50:14,299 --> 01:50:16,402
True.

2328
01:50:16,435 --> 01:50:19,071
But don't let that
come between us now.

2329
01:50:19,104 --> 01:50:24,343
You are far kinder
than I have ever been.

2330
01:50:26,011 --> 01:50:29,982
Cora, I owe you an apology.

2331
01:50:30,015 --> 01:50:33,018
I didn't think
you'd last the course.

2332
01:50:33,051 --> 01:50:34,420
I know.

2333
01:50:34,453 --> 01:50:37,156
But I was wrong.

2334
01:50:37,189 --> 01:50:42,361
Now, that's something you
haven't heard me say until now.

2335
01:50:42,394 --> 01:50:43,562
It was worth waiting for.

2336
01:50:45,197 --> 01:50:48,233
Oh, Mary dear and Edith.

2337
01:50:49,501 --> 01:50:52,171
You've been
wonderful granddaughters.

2338
01:50:52,204 --> 01:50:54,273
And I leave you both

2339
01:50:54,306 --> 01:50:59,445
confident that your lives
will be happy and fruitful.

2340
01:50:59,478 --> 01:51:01,280
Oh, Granny.

2341
01:51:01,313 --> 01:51:03,348
Darling Granny.

2342
01:51:03,382 --> 01:51:05,551
Now, that must be enough

2343
01:51:05,584 --> 01:51:08,253
or I shall be like
one of those guests who

2344
01:51:08,287 --> 01:51:11,323
pack the car and never leave.

2345
01:51:11,356 --> 01:51:14,193
Mila... Milady...

2346
01:51:14,226 --> 01:51:17,262
Stop that noise.

2347
01:51:17,296 --> 01:51:20,199
I can't hear myself die.

2348
01:53:01,902 --> 01:53:03,570
Take that as well.

2349
01:54:27,254 --> 01:54:28,589
Thank you, Bates.

2350
01:54:31,725 --> 01:54:33,761
A strange day for you and me.

2351
01:54:34,796 --> 01:54:36,697
We're orphans at last.

2352
01:54:40,467 --> 01:54:41,667
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

2353
01:54:47,442 --> 01:54:48,710
Milady.

2354
01:54:53,481 --> 01:54:56,251
She'd be so pleased you're here.

2355
01:54:56,284 --> 01:54:59,421
I can remember the first time
I really saw her, milady.

2356
01:54:59,454 --> 01:55:01,791
Oh, close up, I mean.

2357
01:55:01,824 --> 01:55:03,993
I'd just been promoted
from hall boy,

2358
01:55:04,026 --> 01:55:06,695
and I was in the dining room
with the old butler then,

2359
01:55:06,728 --> 01:55:08,463
Mr. Mount joy.

2360
01:55:08,496 --> 01:55:10,565
I'd been terrified of him.

2361
01:55:10,598 --> 01:55:13,301
But then she walked towards us.

2362
01:55:13,334 --> 01:55:16,304
She was angry
about something, and...

2363
01:55:16,337 --> 01:55:18,808
and I could see him tremble.

2364
01:55:18,841 --> 01:55:21,309
I never forgot that.

2365
01:55:21,342 --> 01:55:23,778
And I was never afraid
of him again.

2366
01:55:23,813 --> 01:55:25,447
You belong to our history.

2367
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:28,650
In fact, I wonder
if your part is quite done.

2368
01:55:29,852 --> 01:55:32,387
Would you ever consider
coming back?

2369
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:34,589
For a bit longer anyway.

2370
01:55:34,622 --> 01:55:36,491
Milady?

2371
01:55:36,524 --> 01:55:40,595
Barrow is leaving, and I can't
break in a new butler alone.

2372
01:55:40,628 --> 01:55:42,464
Could Andrew be your steady hand

2373
01:55:42,497 --> 01:55:44,532
while you train him up
to succeed you?

2374
01:55:44,566 --> 01:55:46,267
Could he manage that,
do you think?

2375
01:55:46,301 --> 01:55:47,837
Well, certainly.

2376
01:55:47,870 --> 01:55:49,637
In time.

2377
01:55:51,773 --> 01:55:54,442
Her Ladyship's brooch.

2378
01:55:54,476 --> 01:55:57,345
So now the Down ton torch
has passed to you.

2379
01:55:57,378 --> 01:55:58,546
Mm.

2380
01:55:58,580 --> 01:56:00,749
Oh, to His Lordship.

2381
01:56:00,782 --> 01:56:04,285
But if I'm to carry it, too, I
shall try to do so with pride.

2382
01:56:07,589 --> 01:56:09,657
I can't pretend
I'm not a little frightened.

2383
01:56:09,691 --> 01:56:12,527
Oh, you have no need to be.

2384
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:14,295
You have the strength for it.

2385
01:56:14,329 --> 01:56:15,396
- Do I?
- Mm.

2386
01:56:15,430 --> 01:56:16,866
Sometimes I wonder.

2387
01:56:17,867 --> 01:56:20,436
Well, I don't wonder.

2388
01:56:20,469 --> 01:56:22,605
Not for a moment.

2389
01:56:22,638 --> 01:56:25,541
And you can always count on me,
if that means anything.

2390
01:56:26,542 --> 01:56:27,676
It means a great deal.

2391
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:32,816
And I think you know.

2392
01:56:35,551 --> 01:56:37,753
Now I just need a moment
before we go.

2393
01:56:39,522 --> 01:56:40,756
Milady.

2394
01:56:58,474 --> 01:57:00,811
What did she have to say?

2395
01:57:00,844 --> 01:57:03,847
She wants me back in the house.

2396
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:05,347
As butler.

2397
01:57:05,381 --> 01:57:07,416
Does she indeed?

2398
01:57:10,619 --> 01:57:11,720
We ought to move off.

2399
01:57:11,754 --> 01:57:13,824
Thanks for organizing this.

2400
01:57:13,857 --> 01:57:16,659
She left instructions
down to the tiniest detail.

2401
01:57:16,692 --> 01:57:18,137
I can imagine.

2402
01:57:18,161 --> 01:57:19,695
You'll be burying me one day,

2403
01:57:19,728 --> 01:57:21,865
and I'm glad to see
it'll be done well.

2404
01:57:21,898 --> 01:57:23,632
I suppose the point is

2405
01:57:23,666 --> 01:57:27,369
individual Crawleys come and go,
but the family lives on.

2406
01:57:27,403 --> 01:57:29,538
Mama knew that
and believed in it.

2407
01:57:29,572 --> 01:57:30,874
Didn't she just.

2408
01:58:33,871 --> 01:58:36,573
This way now.
We shall go inside.

2409
01:59:45,143 --> 01:59:46,677
Thank you.

2410
01:59:46,711 --> 01:59:48,847
Oh. Aha.
Here they are. Oh. Oh.

2411
01:59:50,816 --> 01:59:52,516
- Oh.
- Andy.

2412
01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:53,986
Adorable.

2413
01:59:54,019 --> 01:59:55,653
- Hello.
- Aw.

2414
01:59:55,686 --> 01:59:57,588
- Congratulations. - Thank you.
- Well done.

2415
02:00:00,658 --> 02:00:02,060
Are you exhausted?

2416
02:00:02,094 --> 02:00:03,728
Sybbie, how are you doing?

2417
02:00:08,599 --> 02:00:10,002
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2418
02:00:12,838 --> 02:00:15,639
Oh. What a bonny baby.

2419
02:00:15,673 --> 02:00:16,918
- Aw.
- He's very handsome.

2420
02:00:16,942 --> 02:00:19,577
Look, Mary.

2421
02:00:19,610 --> 02:00:21,313
Hello.

2422
02:00:21,346 --> 02:00:23,514
Who's this?

2422
02:00:24,305 --> 02:01:24,731
