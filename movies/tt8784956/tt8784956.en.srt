3
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,802
Mr. Hamilton.

4
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,594
Yes.

5
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,763
You have water in the door.

6
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,556
Great.

7
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,986
Straight to
the convention center?

8
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,279
Absolutely.

9
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:11,188
You're American.

10
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,222
Mm-hm.

11
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:13,557
Arkansas.

12
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,192
Ah, Southern girl.

13
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:16,893
Yes sir, I am.

14
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:18,195
Call me Peter.

15
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:20,264
Sir makes me feel like
I'm retiring to Florida.

16
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:23,900
Oh, I'm so sorry about that.

17
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:25,402
What's your name?

18
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:27,804
I'm Brandy.

19
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:31,708
I've had one of those
fuckers of a morning, Brandy.

20
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,644
Mm, I'm so sorry to hear that.

21
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:37,447
I had this meeting, and this
passive-aggressive motherfucker

22
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,083
insinuates all
this shit about me.

23
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:43,086
Why was I so blind to this
fucking prick who was suggesting

24
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:44,421
I wasn't very good at my job?

25
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:46,089
Which I am, by the way.

26
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:47,891
God love him.

27
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:50,127
You know, Croesus once said,
"Count no man happy

28
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,662
until the end is known."

29
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,570
Ah. Look at you.

30
00:03:00,572 --> 00:03:01,972
Let's make a deal.

31
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,509
I don't know you,
and you don't know me,

32
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:06,977
and since we don't
know each other,

33
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,345
we've got nothing to lose.

34
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:09,746
We can just be real.

35
00:03:09,748 --> 00:03:11,248
Okay?

36
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,683
No masks.

37
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:16,086
Just the experience
of Brandy and Peter.

38
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:16,953
What do you say?

39
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:18,155
Does this usually work?

40
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:24,361
Okay.

41
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:29,166
No masks, no bullshit.

42
00:03:33,205 --> 00:03:36,773
I'm up here thinking that I'd
love to pull the car over,

43
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:42,279
get in the back, have a
drink with you, and then...

44
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,014
see what else happens.

45
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:12,743
Oh, I wish I could.

46
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:14,077
I thought...

47
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,346
I said I'd
love to have a drink.

48
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:18,248
I have one sip of that,
and someone's going to jail,

49
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,884
someone's going to the ER.

50
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:26,723
I didn't come back here
for a drink, Peter.

51
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,394
I wanted to see what you
looked like from this angle.

52
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,496
You like what you see?

53
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:36,967
Your pictures do
not do you justice.

54
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,539
Come here.

55
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,341
Hold on a second, Peter.

56
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:46,877
I just want to ask
you a question first.

57
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:49,246
Yes, ma'am.

58
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,882
You're the boss now.

59
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:52,582
What'd you do?

60
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,187
What did I do?

61
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,791
Well, I don't know
when you did it, but...

62
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:04,027
I know you did something, Peter.

63
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,930
What are you talking about?

64
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,932
Why would someone not want
you to be alive anymore?

65
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,641
You know, if you modernize it,
what Croesus actually said is,

66
00:05:17,643 --> 00:05:21,478
Count no man happy until
he's had a good death.

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,313
I genuinely try to give my
subjects a good death

68
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:25,248
when I can.

69
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,385
But I can't do that unless
I know what you did.

70
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:33,490
This isn't funny.

71
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:35,926
Who put you up to this?

72
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:37,093
Was it Ronny?

73
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:38,628
Aw, that bastard.

74
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,796
I knew it was.

75
00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:41,498
Let's give him a call.

76
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,966
Put the phone down, please.

77
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,636
Ah, fuck!

78
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:49,639
Oh, please!

79
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,740
Please don't, please!

80
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:52,108
Don't beg.

81
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,944
Just think of it as though
it's already happened,

82
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:55,145
because it has.

83
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,581
Now answer my question.

84
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,950
Nothing!

85
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:00,951
I'm a nothing!

86
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:02,018
I'm a nobody!

87
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,887
I just move money
around for companies!

88
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:07,924
So you don't have
an answer for me?

89
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,594
No! No, no, wait, wait.

90
00:06:10,596 --> 00:06:12,195
Okay, okay.

91
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:15,499
I know why.
I know why.

92
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:25,075
No, you don't.

93
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:27,377
Subjects rarely do.

94
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,779
Okay, okay, please.

95
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:31,715
I'll pay you.

96
00:06:31,717 --> 00:06:33,116
I'm sure you hear
this all the time,

97
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:36,553
but I'll give you every cent
that I've got. I'm in finance!

98
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,673
Executive code 74598CG.

99
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:32,842
Management Code 840227.

100
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:34,878
Confirmed.

101
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,413
Subject's closed.

102
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,681
You sound a little off, kiddo.

103
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,919
Anything to share?

104
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:46,222
Nope.

105
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:48,558
Nothing to report?

106
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,226
Gotta get a new set of wigs.

107
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:52,596
I don't know if they've
shrunk, or my head's grown.

108
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,398
Any hiccups?

109
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,133
You can stop worrying
about me now.

110
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:58,068
I'll stop worrying

111
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,070
when I stop worrying.

112
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:01,204
How's the mind?

113
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:02,138
Clear.

114
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,239
Fine.

115
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:05,308
You don't sound clear.

116
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,610
Shut up.

117
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:07,577
Or fine.

118
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:08,878
Just please shut up.

119
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,716
I'm just still in it,
that's all.

120
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:14,284
Did you close this subject

121
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,418
with dignity?

122
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,920
Yep.

123
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:17,721
Was management compromised?

124
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:19,055
Nope.

125
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:22,425
Then move the fuck on.

126
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:24,561
I think I might go back
to Boston for a bit.

127
00:08:24,563 --> 00:08:26,396
Is that a good idea?

128
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:28,064
It's personal, Duke.

129
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:29,933
You want to talkprep for Riyadh?

130
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,001
Later?

131
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:32,168
Okay.

132
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,471
Well, let's go over
it like it's your S-A-Ts,

133
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,340
'cause management asked
for you specifically.

134
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,009
They'll be watching.

135
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:41,511
We cover every exit on this one.

136
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:42,679
Duke.

137
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:43,647
I'll call you

138
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,148
if you don't call me.

139
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,151
Keep your head down and
your powder dry, kiddo.

140
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,452
Head down, powder dry.

141
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:51,755
Got it.

142
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:08,338
Just doing the final
boarding check.

143
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:11,007
Flying time to Boston
will be approximately

144
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,610
six hours and 40 minutes,

145
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:16,212
bringing us in just
ahead of schedule.

146
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:39,189
Checking in.

147
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:41,090
Campbell.

148
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:11,654
Hello?

149
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:12,856
Management code 980456.

150
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:16,025
Executive Order 98602FT

151
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:17,794
We have a situation.

152
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,363
She's one of our own,
so do nothing

153
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,165
until you get the green light.

154
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,933
Just keep her in your sights.

155
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,703
Financial
advisor Peter Hawthorne

156
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:04,407
has been discovered outside
Paris inside a burned car.

157
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,009
French police are describing it

158
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:08,611
as an assassination
style killing.

159
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,013
Hawthorne, a key advisor

160
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,015
to the International
Monetary Fund,

161
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:14,450
had recently been accused
of money laundering

162
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,519
and election tampering

163
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:20,189
after several high level
officials of the...

Yeah,
should be an early flight.

176
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:19,308
Hey, Jude.

177
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:24,647
Can I walk you home?

178
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,888
Well, the funeral was a joy.

179
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,489
Yeah, sorry about that.

180
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:34,590
Yeah.

181
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:35,925
I know you had to do
it all by yourself.

182
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:39,562
I managed.
I managed big time.

183
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:43,032
- How's Mom?
- Irritable.

184
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:45,868
Oh. So she's fine, then.

185
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:49,072
Here.

186
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,740
Michael hates it.

187
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,979
So that's still happening, huh?

188
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,752
I'm sorry, okay?

189
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:04,454
You're my fuckin' sister.

190
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:07,023
Yeah, and you fuckin' left.

191
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:10,026
It happened.

192
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:11,727
I haven't seen you
for eight years.

193
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:13,396
I called you.

194
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:14,430
Yeah, every six months, for you
to deflect all our questions

195
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,366
about where the fuck you are.

196
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:18,901
You just quit
drinking, disappeared,

197
00:16:18,903 --> 00:16:22,905
and left me holding
all these bags of shit.

198
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:24,607
I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

199
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:30,446
Nice.

200
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:35,284
I'd invite you in...

201
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:38,454
but Michael lives
here with me now.

202
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,333
I'll be at the hospital at nine
if you want to meet me there.

203
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:52,735
Hospital?

204
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:55,738
Are you fucking kidding me?
I emailed you last week.

205
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,406
What?

206
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,775
I figured that's
why you're here.

207
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:03,679
Ava, Mom had a heart attack.

208
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:05,481
It wasn't a heart attack.

209
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,483
You're such a drama queen.

210
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,085
It was angina.

211
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:10,820
It's nothing.

212
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:11,587
Heart attack.

213
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:18,027
Baby, will you get me that
other blanket, please?

214
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:20,062
The one on the chair?

215
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,500
Thank you.

216
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,668
You don't have to
stand in the doorway.

217
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,971
Now that you're finally here,
you might as well join us...

218
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:32,175
in the actual room.

219
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:35,611
Here.

220
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:37,480
Oh. No vase.

221
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:39,382
Hey, which nurse is on tonight?

222
00:17:39,384 --> 00:17:42,285
Is it Gloria,
the-the tall redhead?

223
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:43,719
It's Sophie, Ma.

224
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:45,221
Oh, she's nice too.

225
00:17:45,223 --> 00:17:46,822
Maybe she can get us a vase.

226
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:47,857
Mm.

227
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:48,891
They're very sweet to me.

228
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:50,526
They give me extra desserts.

229
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,895
Not that my waistline
could use it.

230
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,830
Well, I think you
look great, Ma.

231
00:17:54,832 --> 00:17:57,533
Hm, I would have thought
maybe you'd be shocked

232
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,136
to see me this old,

233
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,637
considering you
haven't laid eyes on me

234
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:02,905
in such a long time.

235
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:05,875
You look exactly the same age.

236
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,009
It's really great work.

237
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:10,012
Come on, Ava.

238
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:11,347
Thank you, Ava.

239
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:13,883
But really,
it's just my moisturizer.

240
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,051
It's on the shelf
in the bathroom

241
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,153
if you want to grab
some for yourself.

242
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:18,570
It's funny,
I never would have thought

243
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:19,988
that the Netherlands
would be that hot,

244
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:23,426
but it seems like you're
getting a little sun damage.

245
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:25,494
Sun is a great idea.

246
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:27,330
Let's get you in the chair, Ma.

247
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:28,497
I'm not in the mood.

248
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:36,172
Dad only thought
about himself.

249
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:38,874
Nonsense.

250
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:41,577
Your dad was always pushing.

251
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,682
Always indestructible, always
thinking he was invincible.

252
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:47,550
And charm?

253
00:18:47,552 --> 00:18:48,517
Pfft.

254
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:50,086
To burn.

255
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,854
He just charmed them all.

256
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:55,424
He had that manipulative
thing, like Ava.

257
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,428
Your hair looks terrible.

258
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,763
Thank you.

259
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:04,467
Well it just... it just
sits there, like, meh.

260
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:06,535
You could wear it
with some style.

261
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:07,970
You're not in the army anymore.

262
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:09,739
Well, I don't have
anyone to impress.

263
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:12,308
I could cut it for you while
you're here, if you want.

264
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,609
Well, I don't want
to put you out.

265
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,311
I cut Judy's hair all the time.

266
00:19:15,313 --> 00:19:17,446
It is how I earned my living

267
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,149
before I gave up
everything for you two.

268
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:21,717
I do know what I'm doing.

269
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:23,286
I'm sure you do, Ma.

270
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,054
Forget that I mentioned it,
I wish I never brought it up.

271
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:27,290
Fuck, if you want to cut my
hair, you can cut my hair, okay?

272
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,326
Honey, how's Michael?

273
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:32,161
- Uh...
- Have you seen him yet, Ava?

274
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,966
No, not yet.

275
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:40,236
When you do, just remember,

276
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:44,907
try not to make it all about you
and your feelings, huh?

277
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,613
So...

278
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:52,682
Come on, let's hear it.

279
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:54,216
Tell us all about the fancy job.

280
00:19:56,754 --> 00:19:58,854
Nothin' much to tell.

281
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:00,923
So this one could be tricky.

282
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:04,093
The approach should
be flirty but classy.

283
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:07,096
Anything aggressive is going
to scare the General off.

284
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:07,963
Is he married?

285
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:08,698
Separated.

286
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,099
What's the front door key?

287
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:11,801
Larry Sullivan,
a good friend of your father's

288
00:20:11,803 --> 00:20:13,035
and the General.

289
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:16,305
Sunday lunches at your
childhood home in London

290
00:20:16,307 --> 00:20:18,341
is a primary memory.

291
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:21,143
Sullivan used to tell you and
your little brother war stories

292
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:22,511
after the meal.

293
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,213
Got it, that's good stuff.

294
00:20:24,215 --> 00:20:26,148
Stick to the script this time?

295
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,551
The General's a big
weapons mover and shaker

296
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:31,654
internationally, and management
stressed that it has to appear

297
00:20:31,656 --> 00:20:35,157
like natural causes.

298
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:38,027
The necessary materials along
with your personal effects,

299
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,062
will meet you in Riyadh.

300
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:43,032
Go gentle on this one.
all eyes are on us.

301
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,400
Message received.

302
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:46,001
You be great, kiddo.

303
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:46,802
Head down.

304
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:47,670
Powder dry.

305
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:49,872
I know, I know.

306
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,502
You think that is funny?

307
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:53,837
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,840
You really have
a charming laugh.

309
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:00,260
It's your third best quality.

310
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,641
So what are my first and
second best qualities, then?

311
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,686
Of course, well, we could
discuss this upstairs...

312
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,940
I think at this time it's best
if we both leave you alone.

313
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,732
Miss Porter.

314
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,872
I'm so glad Larry sent you.

315
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:24,173
Mm.

316
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:26,075
Mr. Sullivan's a good
friend of my father's.

317
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:29,979
Practically grew up with him
at our house every weekend.

318
00:21:32,283 --> 00:21:35,684
Well, so leave us now,
gentlemen.

319
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:40,790
So, the ambassador is a
very good friend of mine

320
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:45,194
and lets me use his office to
escape these horrible parties.

321
00:21:46,531 --> 00:21:48,864
May I see it?

322
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:52,601
Yes. Please.

323
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,771
So how are you enjoying
this trip in Saudi Arabia?

324
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,541
I must warn you...

325
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,280
I'm a little slut.

326
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,555
Oh, my God.

327
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,563
I... I really like you.

328
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:37,746
It's completely painless.

329
00:22:39,684 --> 00:22:41,584
It'll take about 15 minutes.

330
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:48,691
Everyone will think you died of
a stress-related heart attack.

331
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:01,370
You did something bad.

332
00:23:01,372 --> 00:23:03,239
Right?

333
00:23:06,143 --> 00:23:10,179
They wouldn't have
sent me if you hadn't.

334
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,719
I wish I knew what it was.

335
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:31,800
It was the name, right?

336
00:23:31,802 --> 00:23:33,002
Sullivan.

337
00:23:33,004 --> 00:23:34,803
Faulty fuckin' intel, right?

338
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:36,572
I said the name wrong.

339
00:23:36,574 --> 00:23:37,239
Fuck you.

340
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,105
Help!

341
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,275
Help! Help!

342
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,527
Get her downstairs, it
looks like she's been hit.

343
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,946
Help the General!

344
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:51,146
Oh, my God!

345
00:24:51,148 --> 00:24:53,649
Let's get you down to safety.

346
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,052
It'll be all right.
Calm down.

347
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,830
Almost there.

348
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,004
Keep moving, please.

349
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:17,740
I'm going to throw up if I
don't sit down for a second.

350
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:20,342
Don't move.

351
00:26:24,975 --> 00:26:27,042
Fuck.

352
00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:09,885
Sullivan, O'Sullivan.

353
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:10,953
It's a typo.

354
00:27:10,955 --> 00:27:12,688
I disagree.

355
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,090
Who was responsible?

356
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,760
Well, let's say for the
purposes of this conversation,

357
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:18,861
it's my fault.

358
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:20,229
I'm supposed to get
you in and out safely.

359
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:21,029
I failed.

360
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:23,132
I'm sorry, darling.

361
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:25,634
It was meant to look
like natural causes.

362
00:27:25,636 --> 00:27:26,902
I can do natural causes.

363
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:29,037
I know you can.

364
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,240
I can do an accident.

365
00:27:31,242 --> 00:27:32,241
I can do gentle.

366
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:33,308
I know.

367
00:27:36,147 --> 00:27:38,380
Duke, if you're gonna
close me, just do it now.

368
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:40,516
Management knows
it's not your fault.

369
00:27:45,556 --> 00:27:47,089
Okay.

370
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:48,724
They arranged for one of the
more obscure Middle Eastern

371
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:51,593
terror factions to
claim responsibility.

372
00:27:51,595 --> 00:27:54,897
So some anti-Western group's
gonna get 20 rocket launchers.

373
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:56,265
It's an error.

374
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:59,301
Let's move the fuck on.

375
00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:09,945
How did the General fall
into our parameters?

376
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:12,848
Ava, don't tell me you've been
asking the subjects

377
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,751
what they did wrong again.

378
00:28:15,753 --> 00:28:19,822
We're not going to survive
another episode of that.

379
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:21,623
Have you been using again?

380
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:23,625
No.

381
00:28:23,627 --> 00:28:25,460
You're an addict.

382
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:28,197
Do you remember what that
behavior led to last time?

383
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,631
Yeah.

384
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:31,767
The hospitalization of three
wait staff 'cause they...

385
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:33,101
It's not like that this time.

386
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:34,870
It's just,
sometimes I just want to know

387
00:28:34,872 --> 00:28:36,338
why I'm closing somebody.

388
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,006
Who gives a shit?

389
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,175
You're client-facing.

390
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:43,846
You're not a member of the
parole board or a prison shrink.

391
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:47,449
You're there to get the
SignEasy on the toe tag.

392
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:51,453
Yours is not to reason why,
yours is to do or die.

393
00:28:54,992 --> 00:28:56,658
You know, I'm not going to
be able to protect you

394
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,826
a second time.

395
00:28:57,828 --> 00:28:59,161
Duke.

396
00:28:59,163 --> 00:29:00,796
I'm good.

397
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:01,630
All right?

398
00:29:01,632 --> 00:29:03,131
I promise you.

399
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:07,836
Well, management is going
to be extra cautious.

400
00:29:07,838 --> 00:29:09,404
Okay.

401
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:12,241
They want you off the
grid for a beat or two.

402
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,045
My father died.

403
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:21,216
I know.

404
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,151
You didn't kill him, did you?

405
00:29:23,153 --> 00:29:24,486
Okay.

406
00:29:28,926 --> 00:29:31,026
I need to go back
to Boston anyway.

407
00:29:31,028 --> 00:29:32,895
Tie up some loose ends.

408
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,197
Finish some stuff.

409
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,999
That's a lot of pain points.

410
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:41,370
I know that.

411
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:43,672
You want me to tell management
you'd like time off?

412
00:29:43,674 --> 00:29:44,840
Yeah.

413
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:45,807
I already did.

414
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:51,713
You asshole.

415
00:29:51,715 --> 00:29:53,949
You're such an asshole.

416
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,410
And there you are.

417
00:30:55,412 --> 00:30:57,813
Michael?

418
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:58,814
You look good.

419
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,782
I don't. I don't.

420
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:02,084
But thanks for saying it.

421
00:31:02,086 --> 00:31:03,852
You do, actually.

422
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,757
Judy's inside with your mother.

423
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:10,792
Oh. Some things never
change, do they?

424
00:31:10,794 --> 00:31:13,762
Some things do.

425
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,899
I'm happy for you guys.

426
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,838
I really am.

427
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,976
I probably should have told
you my sister's in town.

428
00:31:27,978 --> 00:31:29,211
Yeah.

429
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:30,879
You gonna start showing
up without calling first?

430
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:32,280
To visit my mother?

431
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:34,349
I can hear you out there,
you know.

432
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:37,919
Come help me with
this fucking TV!

433
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:45,060
Can you believe
Michael remembered?

434
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:46,695
Thank you, Michael.

435
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:50,465
Ava, can you believe Michael
remembered I love irises?

436
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:52,000
Uh, yeah, I can believe
that he'd remember

437
00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:54,102
something like that.

438
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:55,804
Want me to take a look at it?

439
00:31:55,806 --> 00:31:57,205
Nope.

440
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,241
Leave it, you're going to
break the whole damn thing.

441
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:00,675
Uhh, it's fine, it's
just the antenna.

442
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:03,578
I've almost got it.

443
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:07,315
The three of you should go
out and have a nice dinner

444
00:32:07,317 --> 00:32:09,251
tomorrow night.

445
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,853
- Uh. Ma, I...
- No, no.

446
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:13,388
Ava, take them somewhere nice.

447
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,824
- Uh, I don't...
- No, go on. Go on. Go on.

448
00:32:15,826 --> 00:32:17,859
I need to know the
three of you get along.

449
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:20,262
In case anything,
you know, happens to me.

450
00:32:20,264 --> 00:32:21,229
Touch wood.

451
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,432
Ma, stop it.

452
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:29,104
Wow, you fixed it.

453
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:30,839
Good work.

454
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:32,274
Hm.

455
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:34,109
I guess there was
nothing wrong with it.

456
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:40,682
About 10 years ago,
at my most fucked up,

457
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:42,484
I caught my dad
having an affair.

458
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:47,856
And I told him that
if he didn't tell Mom,

459
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:49,624
that I was going
to do it myself.

460
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,296
So... he cried.

461
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:59,167
And he promised me that he
would tell her about it.

462
00:33:00,404 --> 00:33:02,771
But what he did instead was...

463
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:09,611
tell her that he caught me
stealing money from his wallet.

464
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:13,081
He said that I tried to
blackmail him into giving me

465
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:19,321
$1,000, and that if
he wouldn't do it,

466
00:33:19,323 --> 00:33:24,860
that I would make up a story
about him having an affair.

467
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,265
I was a total alcoholic-addict
piece of shit at the time who

468
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:34,536
had been caught stealing
money for drugs, so...

469
00:33:36,273 --> 00:33:38,673
naturally, she believed him.

470
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,245
I don't blame her.

471
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:47,482
But him...

472
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:55,023
The look on his face when she
was confronting me about it.

473
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:01,763
It was like he was amused...

474
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:04,499
for using me to save his ass.

475
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:10,605
I couldn't get through
that day without using.

476
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,609
Made me want to kill him.

477
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:21,016
Oh, I fuckin'
fantasized about it.

478
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:30,525
And I knew that if I didn't
leave immediately, that I would.

479
00:34:33,297 --> 00:34:35,463
So...

480
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:38,567
I left and I joined the army.

481
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:46,141
When I heard he was dead,
I knew it was safe to come back.

482
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,413
That's all I got.

483
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,816
Thank you for sharing.

484
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,553
Hey, I'm Tony and
I'm an alcoholic.

485
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:01,289
Hi, Tony.

486
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,189
- Hey.
- Hey.

487
00:35:38,128 --> 00:35:40,095
So when are our Syrian friends
going to claim responsibility,

488
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,129
has that been arranged?

489
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:42,631
Being arranged, as we speak.

490
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:44,165
Okay.

491
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:52,607
Goodness gracious me.

492
00:35:53,543 --> 00:35:55,343
That was a hiccup.

493
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,545
That was more than a hiccup.

494
00:35:57,547 --> 00:36:00,448
The Saudi branch has
completed refurbishment.

495
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,485
They say they're ready to
chase returns and get filled.

496
00:36:03,487 --> 00:36:06,621
They say there's no way
it can lead back to us.

497
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,590
There's one way.

498
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:09,924
No, not her.

499
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:12,327
I recruited her, I trained her.

500
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:13,762
You recruited me,
you trained me.

501
00:36:13,764 --> 00:36:14,863
I say she's a liability.

502
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:17,732
Simon.

503
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:19,301
She's best of breed.

504
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:21,603
There's no way she can be ID'd.

505
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:22,337
There's a risk factor.

506
00:36:24,274 --> 00:36:25,273
Have you forgotten?

507
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:26,775
That was two years ago.

508
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:29,177
And she had valid doubts
about the ethical merits

509
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:31,446
of a couple of closures.

510
00:36:31,448 --> 00:36:34,316
Valid doubts...

511
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,951
the pursuit of which led her
to have a fuckin' meltdown.

512
00:36:36,953 --> 00:36:38,320
And she got back on track.

513
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:41,456
She's talking
to the fuckin' targets!

514
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,491
Again!

515
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:45,093
You told me...

516
00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:48,530
when soldiers disobey the
chain of command, people die.

517
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:50,632
H-How do we know this?

518
00:36:50,634 --> 00:36:53,101
I heard her.

519
00:36:53,103 --> 00:36:54,836
I was in France.

520
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:06,448
Saudi Arabia wasn't her fault,
that's all I'm saying.

521
00:37:07,384 --> 00:37:09,150
So whose fault was it?

522
00:37:09,152 --> 00:37:14,522
My executive, my care and
feeding, my responsibility.

523
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,124
Well, thank you.

524
00:37:16,126 --> 00:37:17,092
Thank you for saying it.

525
00:37:19,963 --> 00:37:22,330
All right, then.

526
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:25,233
She is the most gifted
we have, you know that.

527
00:37:25,235 --> 00:37:26,968
Okay.

528
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,670
She'll take a rest.

529
00:37:28,672 --> 00:37:31,139
Let the dust settle.

530
00:37:31,141 --> 00:37:32,841
I'll re-engage her
when the time is right.

531
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:34,676
That's the best decision.

532
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:37,011
It's your decision, Duke.

533
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:39,314
Just lettin' you make it.

534
00:37:39,316 --> 00:37:40,749
Yeah.

535
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:41,750
Now get the fuck out of
here and let me enjoy

536
00:37:41,752 --> 00:37:43,585
me son's christening.

537
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:45,186
Yeah.

538
00:37:45,188 --> 00:37:47,422
Congrats.

539
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:08,777
So?

540
00:38:11,114 --> 00:38:12,514
She's always been
Duke's favorite,

541
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:15,383
but she's a loose cannon and
a danger to the organization.

542
00:38:15,385 --> 00:38:18,286
I wanted her killed in Riyadh
so he wouldn't know it was us.

543
00:38:18,288 --> 00:38:20,522
But now...

544
00:38:20,524 --> 00:38:22,690
Call Alain.

545
00:38:22,692 --> 00:38:26,361
Tell him tooth or finger,
I don't care which.

546
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:27,896
I want to see a piece of her.

547
00:38:27,898 --> 00:38:29,564
Hm.

548
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:31,132
What about Duke?

549
00:38:31,134 --> 00:38:32,700
Don't you worry about Duke.

550
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,702
- But Dad...
- Listen.

551
00:38:34,704 --> 00:38:37,605
Five days,
that man was tortured,

552
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,141
and he didn't give me up.

553
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:43,278
Five days.

554
00:38:43,713 --> 00:38:45,046
But won't he know it was us?

555
00:38:45,048 --> 00:38:46,714
Doesn't matter,
go outside to the party.

556
00:38:46,716 --> 00:38:48,483
Spend some time with your
little brother, will you?

557
00:38:48,485 --> 00:38:50,785
Go on.

558
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:51,886
Half-brother.

559
00:38:51,888 --> 00:38:53,555
I'm good.

560
00:42:02,078 --> 00:42:04,512
- I know you're angry...
- Stop talking.

561
00:42:04,514 --> 00:42:05,980
I just...

562
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:06,981
You know how I always say
stop talking and you don't,

563
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,650
and it's part of our
hilarious banter?

564
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:12,987
This time I'm actually
telling you stop talking.

565
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:18,326
You're showing me a gun?

566
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,862
You know what happened to the
last person who showed me a gun?

567
00:42:20,864 --> 00:42:22,964
And the person before that?

568
00:42:22,966 --> 00:42:26,200
And the person before that, and
so on, if you follow my drift?

569
00:42:28,471 --> 00:42:31,172
Saudi Arabia was their fuckup.

570
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:32,707
It was your fuckup, Duke.

571
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:34,642
You're trying to close me?

572
00:42:34,644 --> 00:42:39,947
I know it may look like that,
but honestly, and no offense,

573
00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:41,949
the company is not
trying to close you.

574
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:45,053
If they wanted you closed,
you'd be closed.

575
00:42:45,055 --> 00:42:46,220
Uh-huh.

576
00:42:46,222 --> 00:42:47,655
And you're sure of that
because...?

577
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:51,225
Because it was discussed.

578
00:42:51,227 --> 00:42:52,360
Right.

579
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:53,895
Of course it was
fuckin' discussed.

580
00:42:53,897 --> 00:42:56,798
You keep breaking protocol.

581
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,566
I warned you.

582
00:43:01,137 --> 00:43:03,638
Anyway, I told Simon
you're not to be touched,

583
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,674
and if he wanted to do
something like that,

584
00:43:06,676 --> 00:43:08,876
he would have to involve me.

585
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,879
And kill me.

586
00:43:13,516 --> 00:43:16,751
Say that again.

587
00:43:16,753 --> 00:43:18,820
The company had
nothing to do with it.

588
00:43:22,192 --> 00:43:26,327
I got an ID on the guy from
my sources at Boston PD.

589
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:30,331
He's ex-French Special Forces,
dishonorably discharged,

590
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,200
and MIA for years.

591
00:43:32,202 --> 00:43:34,235
He had a drug problem.

592
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:38,506
So it would seem that an
exceptionally unlucky junkie

593
00:43:38,508 --> 00:43:39,841
tried to mug you...

594
00:43:39,843 --> 00:43:42,210
You don't believe that, Duke.

595
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:46,214
Uh, because operatives with
black arts combat training

596
00:43:46,216 --> 00:43:48,683
can't be addicts?

597
00:43:48,685 --> 00:43:50,718
I know you don't trust anybody.

598
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,354
But I'm not anybody.

599
00:43:53,356 --> 00:43:57,391
So, I'm gonna take my
hands out of my pockets,

600
00:43:57,393 --> 00:44:01,696
I'm gonna put them up like this,
I'm going to step toward you...

601
00:44:01,698 --> 00:44:05,600
place them on your shoulders
in a comforting,

602
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:07,335
but firm, fatherly manner...

603
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,073
and I'm going to ask you.

604
00:44:12,075 --> 00:44:13,274
Are you sure you
don't want me to

605
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,711
hang around for a few days,
keep an eye on you?

606
00:44:24,053 --> 00:44:26,020
I came here to get a
break from you, remember?

607
00:44:28,258 --> 00:44:29,891
Here's his gun.

608
00:44:31,494 --> 00:44:32,727
Can you run it for me?

609
00:44:32,729 --> 00:44:34,028
Will do.

610
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:14,502
- He's a punk.
- No.

611
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:16,103
He's a punk.

612
00:45:16,105 --> 00:45:19,340
- Teddy's a great bass player.
- He's a fine bass player.

613
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,275
And 'fine' not as
in, Oh, he's fine.

614
00:45:21,277 --> 00:45:22,510
'Fine' as in average.

615
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,111
You can do better.

616
00:45:24,113 --> 00:45:26,113
He hates Teddy coz he hit on
me at the first gig we played.

617
00:45:26,115 --> 00:45:28,950
What? That's not true.
I don't even remember that.

618
00:45:28,952 --> 00:45:30,384
Oh, you don't?

619
00:45:30,386 --> 00:45:31,819
- No?
- No.

620
00:45:31,821 --> 00:45:33,621
Oh, she can't drink that.

621
00:45:38,394 --> 00:45:40,795
But first,
bullshit you'd forgotten?

622
00:45:40,797 --> 00:45:42,330
Mm-hm.

623
00:45:42,332 --> 00:45:45,166
And second, he just didn't
know that I had a boyfriend.

624
00:45:45,168 --> 00:45:47,168
Hm. Yeah, okay.

625
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:49,237
Judy's in this incredible band,
you gotta hear 'em.

626
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:50,204
She heard actually.

627
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,038
Thank you, by the way.

628
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,140
She heard us play
the other night.

629
00:45:53,142 --> 00:45:54,475
They're great.

630
00:45:54,477 --> 00:45:56,510
You should come hear them
play at Wally's on Friday.

631
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:58,512
You're playing Wally's Cafe?

632
00:45:58,514 --> 00:46:00,915
You're gonna blow up, Jude.

633
00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:01,983
Well, you're biased.

634
00:46:01,985 --> 00:46:03,918
Wow, you always wanted
to play at Wally's.

635
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,254
Come on, with all
the fake modesty.

636
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:07,922
You know you rant and
rave every night about

637
00:46:07,924 --> 00:46:10,725
how underappreciated
you guys are.

638
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:12,693
Don't fucking say that.

639
00:46:12,695 --> 00:46:14,595
What?

640
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:17,231
Could you not say that kind of
fuckin' stuff in front of her?

641
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,199
What kind of stuff?

642
00:46:18,201 --> 00:46:19,033
What did I say?

643
00:46:19,035 --> 00:46:19,700
You didn't say anything.

644
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:24,605
Why are you fuckin' asking her?

645
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:27,341
Don't laugh at me.

646
00:46:27,343 --> 00:46:28,709
Judy, he's not laughing at you.

647
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:30,544
Okay, just don't do that.

648
00:46:30,546 --> 00:46:32,680
Listen, what I say at home,
I say it at home.

649
00:46:32,682 --> 00:46:34,682
And I... I've just been
complimenting you for the past

650
00:46:34,684 --> 00:46:36,384
10 minutes, I was talkin'
about how brilliant you are.

651
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:37,618
Was that hard for you?

652
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,152
No. Look, you know, what?
I'm not gonna do this.

653
00:46:39,154 --> 00:46:40,687
- Was it a chore for you?
- You're drunk. Okay?

654
00:46:41,891 --> 00:46:43,858
That's what it is, you're drunk.

655
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,459
So.

656
00:46:45,461 --> 00:46:47,361
So, what's... what's
your job like?

657
00:46:47,363 --> 00:46:48,930
How's it work?

658
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:51,232
Oh, uh, it's not
that interesting.

659
00:46:51,234 --> 00:46:54,769
Events and functions and endless
cocktail parties where the

660
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:57,038
food's terrible and I can't
drink the free booze.

661
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,040
What's the point?

662
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:00,574
So...

663
00:47:00,576 --> 00:47:02,810
running around Beijing trying
to find almond milk for the

664
00:47:02,812 --> 00:47:06,480
delegate from France
who's lactose intolerant.

665
00:47:06,482 --> 00:47:08,516
Sounds like a glorified
flight attendant.

666
00:47:14,557 --> 00:47:18,326
Oh, it's so weird being here.

667
00:47:18,328 --> 00:47:20,494
There's so many memories here.

668
00:47:20,496 --> 00:47:23,564
What memories?

669
00:47:23,566 --> 00:47:24,732
- Babe.
- What?

670
00:47:24,734 --> 00:47:25,967
She said it.

671
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:27,401
Let her explain it.

672
00:47:27,403 --> 00:47:29,303
I didn't mean what
you're thinking, Jude.

673
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,571
No? You did.

674
00:47:32,942 --> 00:47:35,042
You guys have fun.

675
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:40,948
Je-sus.

676
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:42,650
Well...

677
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:44,251
she was happy for a while there.

678
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:45,686
Mm-hm, and then?

679
00:47:45,688 --> 00:47:47,154
And then your father died.

680
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:50,124
And she was the only one here
to take care of everything.

681
00:47:50,126 --> 00:47:51,158
Then that, Ava.

682
00:47:53,429 --> 00:47:54,462
Okay.

683
00:47:54,464 --> 00:47:56,464
No, it's not, actually.

684
00:47:56,466 --> 00:47:58,499
What does that mean?

685
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:03,170
Fine, I'll go talk to her.

686
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,139
No.

687
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:08,642
You don't get to come in here
and try to fix everything.

688
00:48:08,644 --> 00:48:10,277
Okay?

689
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:13,914
You don't get to be that person.

690
00:48:18,154 --> 00:48:20,254
Sorry.

691
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:27,361
I'm the one who
should apologize.

692
00:48:28,564 --> 00:48:31,232
I left without saying goodbye.

693
00:48:34,971 --> 00:48:36,370
You did.

694
00:49:07,537 --> 00:49:08,536
Yeah?

695
00:49:08,538 --> 00:49:11,238
Ava?

696
00:49:15,845 --> 00:49:16,877
Sorry it's so late,
I don't know what to do.

697
00:49:16,879 --> 00:49:18,913
What do you mean you
don't know what to do?

698
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:21,182
Uh, Michael hasn't come home.

699
00:49:24,053 --> 00:49:26,053
He went out and he
hasn't come home.

700
00:49:26,055 --> 00:49:31,692
Well, I'm sure he's just cooling
off like he always does, right?

701
00:49:31,694 --> 00:49:34,095
You must be fucking loving this.

702
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:36,831
Why would I love you waking
me up at 5 am, yelling at me?

703
00:49:39,302 --> 00:49:40,701
Fine, you know what?

704
00:49:40,703 --> 00:49:41,869
I'm gonna go.

705
00:49:41,871 --> 00:49:43,237
Jude.

706
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:44,972
I know you don't trust me.

707
00:49:44,974 --> 00:49:46,440
I know I let you
down and disappeared.

708
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:47,808
But I'm here now.

709
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,044
Please...

710
00:49:50,046 --> 00:49:52,213
just talk to me.

711
00:49:56,419 --> 00:49:58,586
It's happened before.

712
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:01,822
Sometimes he doesn't
come home from...

713
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:04,358
Come home from where?

714
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:12,366
When did he start
gambling again?

715
00:50:16,939 --> 00:50:19,473
He never stopped.

716
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:24,245
Right.

717
00:50:24,247 --> 00:50:25,479
He's good at it.

718
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,181
You know that.

719
00:50:27,183 --> 00:50:28,916
And we could really make a
start with what he could

720
00:50:28,918 --> 00:50:30,251
pull down at the tracks.

721
00:50:30,253 --> 00:50:31,752
But I told him...

722
00:50:31,754 --> 00:50:32,686
no cards.

723
00:50:32,688 --> 00:50:34,622
I told him no fucking cards.

724
00:50:34,624 --> 00:50:37,291
Those people are...

725
00:50:37,293 --> 00:50:38,592
they're so crazy.

726
00:50:38,594 --> 00:50:40,828
You're sure he's playing cards?

727
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:44,465
It's okay.

728
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:46,267
I fucking... I hate it.

729
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:49,136
'Cause part of me is hoping
you know where he is,

730
00:50:49,138 --> 00:50:53,240
and the other part is
gonna be pissed if...

731
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:57,144
So do you?

732
00:50:57,146 --> 00:50:59,213
No.

733
00:50:59,215 --> 00:51:01,849
Sorry.

734
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,200
Haven't seen you in a while.

735
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:20,134
Huh.

736
00:51:20,136 --> 00:51:21,001
Is she expecting you?

737
00:51:21,003 --> 00:51:21,969
Isn't she always?

738
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,360
Fuck no.

739
00:52:19,362 --> 00:52:20,694
Hey, Toni.

740
00:52:20,696 --> 00:52:22,596
My little lost lamb...

741
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:25,065
who threw up on my floor.

742
00:52:25,067 --> 00:52:28,369
That was eight years ago.

743
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:31,438
I'm out.

744
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,643
I found this pretty thing
outside my door half-dead

745
00:52:35,645 --> 00:52:37,611
with a needle stuck
between her toes.

746
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:40,914
A lot has changed.

747
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:42,750
I can see that.

748
00:52:42,752 --> 00:52:44,952
She's not a thankful person.

749
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:48,622
I cleaned her up,
let her live on my sofa.

750
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:52,326
And then she took
my rabbit's foot.

751
00:52:52,328 --> 00:52:54,695
Now she thinks she
can take him again.

752
00:52:56,599 --> 00:52:57,731
Cash him out.

753
00:52:57,733 --> 00:52:59,400
He's got someplace
he's gotta be.

754
00:52:59,402 --> 00:53:02,970
That someplace isn't
with you anymore, is it?

755
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:04,972
Looking good.

756
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:06,674
How long you been clean?

757
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,744
Long enough.

758
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,447
Tick-tock.

759
00:53:15,251 --> 00:53:18,519
That's enough, Toni.

760
00:53:18,521 --> 00:53:19,486
Let's go.

761
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,088
I always liked you...

762
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,456
in my way.

763
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:25,292
Don't push my patience.

764
00:53:25,294 --> 00:53:26,927
You need to go.

765
00:53:26,929 --> 00:53:29,163
I'm going to be here
maybe a hour or so.

766
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:30,497
How much are you into her for?

767
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:32,032
He's not leaving this game.

768
00:53:32,034 --> 00:53:33,634
Listen... You heard her.

769
00:53:33,636 --> 00:53:34,935
Time to go.

770
00:53:34,937 --> 00:53:35,836
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

771
00:53:57,293 --> 00:53:58,625
Come on, Michael.

772
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:00,260
Lead the way.

773
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:06,533
Let's see how many holes
I can put in her face

774
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:07,968
before you shoot me.

775
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,036
Put it away.

776
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:11,472
Put it down.

777
00:54:20,683 --> 00:54:24,051
Who taught you those
slick moves back there?

778
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:27,421
You always were a quick
study though, weren't you?

779
00:54:27,423 --> 00:54:30,557
You had everyone's
number, right?

780
00:54:31,527 --> 00:54:32,826
I'm going to leave you here.

781
00:54:33,863 --> 00:54:35,396
You can get out now.

782
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:38,866
It's tomorrow... and the next
day and the day after

783
00:54:38,868 --> 00:54:40,901
that you need to worry about.

784
00:54:47,676 --> 00:54:49,176
How much?

785
00:54:49,178 --> 00:54:50,444
I don't care about the money.

786
00:54:50,446 --> 00:54:51,879
Let's pretend for a
second that you do.

787
00:54:51,881 --> 00:54:53,247
How much does he owe you?

788
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:56,183
Seventy five, give or take.

789
00:54:56,185 --> 00:54:57,918
Give me 36 hours.

790
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,787
You don't fuck with him.

791
00:54:59,789 --> 00:55:01,955
That'd be mighty
magnanimous of me.

792
00:55:01,957 --> 00:55:04,425
You got a lot of fucking nerve.

793
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:06,360
I guess we both do.

794
00:55:06,362 --> 00:55:08,195
Yeah.

795
00:55:18,908 --> 00:55:21,041
What the fuck was that?

796
00:55:21,043 --> 00:55:23,043
Judy came to my hotel,
she was worried about you.

797
00:55:23,045 --> 00:55:25,379
That's not what
I'm talking about.

798
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:26,980
All the stuff
you was doing.

799
00:55:26,982 --> 00:55:28,382
Who the fuck is in
front of me right now?

800
00:55:28,384 --> 00:55:30,717
Wonder Woman?

801
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:32,386
I started studying martial
arts when I was in rehab.

802
00:55:32,388 --> 00:55:33,487
Nah.

803
00:55:33,489 --> 00:55:34,721
No.

804
00:55:34,723 --> 00:55:36,623
Don't give me the story
you give everybody else.

805
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,091
You tell me the truth.

806
00:55:38,093 --> 00:55:40,194
Or get the fuck outta my face.

807
00:55:44,433 --> 00:55:45,732
Oh, it's like that now?

808
00:55:45,734 --> 00:55:46,834
You want to talk
about my honesty?

809
00:55:46,836 --> 00:55:48,635
Look, I'm just trying
to get out of debt.

810
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,671
You do realize the number's
meant to get smaller, right?

811
00:55:50,673 --> 00:55:52,005
No shit.

812
00:55:52,007 --> 00:55:54,575
Toni's no joke, Michael.

813
00:55:54,577 --> 00:55:56,443
Well, she's the only
one who would stake me.

814
00:55:56,445 --> 00:55:57,945
That's helped you.

815
00:55:57,947 --> 00:55:58,946
Oh, yeah?

816
00:55:58,948 --> 00:56:00,814
Just what have you
been up to, Cakes?

817
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,583
Don't call me that,
I'm not that person anymore.

818
00:56:02,585 --> 00:56:03,951
Oh, yes you are.

819
00:56:03,953 --> 00:56:08,121
You'll always be Cakes to me.

820
00:56:08,123 --> 00:56:11,425
I asked you to marry me,
and you said yes.

821
00:56:11,427 --> 00:56:13,894
And then you just disappear
for eight fuckin' years!

822
00:56:19,468 --> 00:56:21,768
I made a mistake with my family
and I had to get away from it.

823
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:24,771
You couldn't talk
to me about it?

824
00:56:28,477 --> 00:56:29,710
So I got you a few days.

825
00:56:29,712 --> 00:56:31,111
How much can you rustle up?

826
00:56:31,113 --> 00:56:32,546
Not enough.

827
00:56:32,548 --> 00:56:34,281
Well, do you need cash?

828
00:56:34,283 --> 00:56:36,717
Not from you.

829
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:39,286
What is your alternative,
Michael?

830
00:56:39,288 --> 00:56:42,122
This is my alternative...
right here.

831
00:56:42,124 --> 00:56:43,023
What the fuck are you
going to do with that?

832
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,491
You gonna kill her?

833
00:56:44,493 --> 00:56:45,993
I owe her 80 grand.

834
00:56:45,995 --> 00:56:51,732
Crush or no crush, lucky charm...
she's gonna come for it.

835
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:55,235
And I gotta think
about Judy and...

836
00:56:55,237 --> 00:56:56,837
Hey.

837
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:57,905
Don't do that.

838
00:56:57,907 --> 00:56:59,172
What are you doing?

839
00:56:59,174 --> 00:57:01,975
I'm not yours anymore.

840
00:57:11,353 --> 00:57:14,421
So you're happy.

841
00:57:14,423 --> 00:57:18,492
I asked her to marry me.

842
00:57:18,494 --> 00:57:20,294
And she said yes.

843
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:22,796
Ava.

844
00:57:24,033 --> 00:57:24,898
Ava!

845
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:07,808
What'll it be?

846
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:10,143
Scotch, double.

847
00:58:10,145 --> 00:58:11,979
You got it.

848
00:58:20,222 --> 00:58:21,488
Shit.

849
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:23,323
You want it on the rocks?

850
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:24,558
Sure.

851
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,926
Good.

852
00:58:25,928 --> 00:58:27,995
'Cause you got it on the rocks.

853
00:58:30,265 --> 00:58:31,965
You a guest here at the hotel?

854
00:58:34,236 --> 00:58:38,572
Room number please?

855
00:58:42,344 --> 00:58:43,677
Ma'am?

856
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:44,945
You want me to charge
this to your room?

857
00:58:44,947 --> 00:58:46,013
Sure.

858
00:58:53,622 --> 00:58:54,588
Hey, man.

859
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:55,989
Hey.

860
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:57,457
I finally got me
73-year-old mother

861
00:58:57,459 --> 00:58:59,459
to agree to come over here.

862
00:58:59,461 --> 00:59:01,662
She's never been on a plane,
she's never left Ireland.

863
00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:03,764
She's gonna be here
within the hour,

864
00:59:03,766 --> 00:59:05,832
so at the expense of
sounding like a pushy prick,

865
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,768
what's on your mind?

866
00:59:08,337 --> 00:59:12,606
So, Saudi Arabia wasn't
an error, was it?

867
00:59:12,608 --> 00:59:17,210
You set her up, you wanted
her to get killed, right?

868
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:20,147
I underestimated her.

869
00:59:20,149 --> 00:59:22,015
That was an error.

870
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:23,784
I can see that now.

871
00:59:23,786 --> 00:59:26,553
And the executive you sent
to Boston to close her?

872
00:59:26,555 --> 00:59:30,290
You haven't heard from
him in 24 hours or so?

873
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:34,795
That may count as
an error as well.

874
00:59:34,797 --> 00:59:36,196
Go ahead and activate
cleanup protocol

875
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,065
on all of Alain's aliases.

876
00:59:38,067 --> 00:59:41,101
- But...
- He's dead. Go on.

877
00:59:51,246 --> 00:59:52,546
I really didn't want to put
you in the position

878
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:54,181
of having to sanction the kill.

879
00:59:54,183 --> 00:59:55,515
Which you would have
had to have done.

880
00:59:55,517 --> 00:59:56,750
The buck stops with me now.

881
00:59:56,752 --> 00:59:58,518
I gotta make the hard calls.

882
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,654
You taught me this.

883
01:00:00,656 --> 01:00:03,356
You're not my superior
officer anymore.

884
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:05,425
Now, if that causes you any
discomfort, Jesus, I'm sorry,

885
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:06,526
but get the fuck over it.

886
01:00:06,528 --> 01:00:07,894
This isn't like the war.

887
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,564
There are no sides.

888
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:15,168
This is business,
and it's brutal.

889
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:16,937
And I know you like Ava.

890
01:00:16,939 --> 01:00:19,339
Wanted to spare your feelings.

891
01:00:19,341 --> 01:00:22,309
Rely on your understanding
afterwards, you know?

892
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:31,618
What does she think happened?

893
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,920
Let's hope she thinks
what I told her to think,

894
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:36,690
that she was
attacked by a junkie.

895
01:00:36,692 --> 01:00:38,625
I lied to her.

896
01:00:38,627 --> 01:00:39,960
Good.

897
01:00:43,132 --> 01:00:45,799
You need to rescind
the kill order.

898
01:00:45,801 --> 01:00:47,768
You know I can't do that.

899
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,836
Sure you can.

900
01:00:58,914 --> 01:01:00,147
Hey, what the fuck, man?

901
01:01:00,149 --> 01:01:01,081
Duke! Duke! I knew it was you!

902
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:03,216
You did? Oh, boy.

903
01:01:03,218 --> 01:01:04,751
You knew it was me?

904
01:01:04,753 --> 01:01:06,753
Really?

905
01:01:06,755 --> 01:01:10,791
Hey, is it true that you are
the prettiest in your family?

906
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:12,425
Yes.

907
01:01:12,427 --> 01:01:16,329
Is it true that you're the
smartest in your family?

908
01:01:16,331 --> 01:01:17,264
Yes.

909
01:01:17,266 --> 01:01:18,498
Your whole family?

910
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,466
Come to Daddy, Monster.

911
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:20,600
Come here.

912
01:01:20,602 --> 01:01:22,402
Oh my God, where's your mother?

913
01:01:22,404 --> 01:01:23,403
Shower.

914
01:01:23,405 --> 01:01:24,771
Yeah, did you sneak
out on your own?

915
01:01:24,773 --> 01:01:26,506
Crafty.

916
01:01:26,508 --> 01:01:29,910
Well, Uncle Duke's gonna have a
job for you with those skills.

917
01:01:29,912 --> 01:01:32,012
Oh, no, he won't.

918
01:01:32,014 --> 01:01:34,247
One daughter's enough?

919
01:01:34,249 --> 01:01:36,850
The field is no
place for a lady.

920
01:01:36,852 --> 01:01:40,320
I think we've established that.

921
01:01:43,826 --> 01:01:45,292
Say goodbye to
Uncle Duke, Monster.

922
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:46,960
Bye, Uncle Duke.

923
01:01:46,962 --> 01:01:48,962
Bye, beautiful.

924
01:01:48,964 --> 01:01:50,664
All right you, get in there.

925
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,365
Bring her out to her mother, and
don't let her back out again.

926
01:01:52,367 --> 01:01:54,234
Yes, sir.

927
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:47,320
No! Stop! It's not
your fight, darlin'.

928
01:02:47,322 --> 01:02:48,822
Go on, get out of
here, leave us alone.

929
01:02:48,824 --> 01:02:50,490
Leave us alone!

930
01:04:12,674 --> 01:04:14,341
Come in.

931
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:23,650
You should have stayed
at the hospital.

932
01:04:23,652 --> 01:04:25,785
You sure you don't want to
give it a few more days?

933
01:04:25,787 --> 01:04:28,421
I certainly did not want
to give it a few more days.

934
01:04:28,423 --> 01:04:30,023
I mean, just in case
you're not completely...

935
01:04:30,025 --> 01:04:31,624
Ohhh!

936
01:04:31,626 --> 01:04:34,094
I hate that kind of talk.

937
01:04:34,096 --> 01:04:37,530
You can go to hell with
your just in case garbage.

938
01:04:37,532 --> 01:04:40,800
Touch wood.

939
01:04:40,802 --> 01:04:43,036
Go on, touch wood.

940
01:04:44,539 --> 01:04:47,273
Both hands.

941
01:05:33,021 --> 01:05:34,988
Hearts.

942
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,600
Anyone ever talk to you about
going on some OCD medication?

943
01:05:47,602 --> 01:05:48,701
Ha.

944
01:05:48,703 --> 01:05:50,937
That's what you
would like, isn't it?

945
01:05:50,939 --> 01:05:56,676
Drug me up and then throw
me away in the loony bin.

946
01:05:57,179 --> 01:05:58,912
Here we go.

947
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:02,916
Ma.

948
01:06:05,387 --> 01:06:07,687
I have to talk to
you about something.

949
01:06:10,725 --> 01:06:14,461
You should choose carefully
what you tell me, Ava.

950
01:06:15,063 --> 01:06:16,796
'Cause you can't...

951
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:20,934
un-say it, and I
can't un-hear it.

952
01:06:22,804 --> 01:06:27,707
And I would love to believe that
you work at the United Nations,

953
01:06:27,709 --> 01:06:30,110
honey, I really would.

954
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:33,813
I'm sorry.

955
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:55,802
I... I knew who your father
was when I married him.

956
01:06:56,838 --> 01:07:00,840
I didn't want to look at
that part of him, so...

957
01:07:00,842 --> 01:07:06,346
I focused on the half of him
that made me happy and I, uh,

958
01:07:06,348 --> 01:07:10,183
ignored the half of him
that broke my heart.

959
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:19,926
If I'd have called him out
then for screwing around,

960
01:07:19,928 --> 01:07:21,694
it'd be not only
for his betrayal,

961
01:07:23,965 --> 01:07:26,833
it'd be because he lied
about his daughter

962
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:30,170
to save his own ass, and...

963
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:36,309
well, any decent mother would
have to leave the man then,

964
01:07:36,311 --> 01:07:39,479
right?

965
01:07:39,481 --> 01:07:44,450
I was scared to be alone.

966
01:07:47,122 --> 01:07:49,422
I chose him over you.

967
01:07:51,626 --> 01:07:55,361
That's why I didn't
want to talk to you.

968
01:07:55,997 --> 01:07:58,097
I dreaded you calling every
six months, because...

969
01:08:01,236 --> 01:08:03,937
you knew what I'd done.

970
01:08:09,844 --> 01:08:16,816
Whatever it is, whatever it
is that you've been hiding...

971
01:08:17,686 --> 01:08:20,119
I don't care.

972
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:22,155
Because I can see
in your eyes

973
01:08:22,157 --> 01:08:26,726
that it's given you
a strength...

974
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:30,897
You would never do
to your child...

975
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:32,465
what I did to mine.

976
01:08:35,503 --> 01:08:39,239
I can see, you are not scared.

977
01:08:44,246 --> 01:08:47,146
And that...
makes me very proud.

978
01:08:53,888 --> 01:08:55,855
Mom.

979
01:08:58,193 --> 01:09:02,395
Ava, it's your turn...

980
01:09:02,397 --> 01:09:05,465
and I have to win so
I can get some rest.

981
01:09:05,467 --> 01:09:07,700
Okay? So...

982
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:42,168
Day like this
reminds me of home.

983
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:43,436
Does it?

984
01:09:43,438 --> 01:09:45,738
Yeah.

985
01:09:47,075 --> 01:09:49,742
And I'm going to go to Boston.

986
01:09:49,744 --> 01:09:51,311
Take care of Ava meself.

987
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:52,679
Mm.

988
01:09:52,681 --> 01:09:56,249
Good luck.

989
01:09:56,251 --> 01:09:56,983
Is there anything you'd
like me to say to her

990
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:59,152
before I put her in the earth?

991
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:05,124
Well, tell her I'm sorry I
couldn't be there to watch her

992
01:10:05,126 --> 01:10:07,927
cut your heart out.

993
01:10:09,097 --> 01:10:11,097
Will do.

994
01:11:23,605 --> 01:11:24,704
Yep?

995
01:11:24,706 --> 01:11:26,873
Management Code 980456.

996
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:28,408
Executive Code, please?

997
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:32,879
Executive Code 74598CG.

998
01:11:32,881 --> 01:11:34,414
Confirmed.

999
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:36,382
Who's this?

1000
01:11:36,384 --> 01:11:38,785
Hello Ava, I'm Simon.

1001
01:11:38,787 --> 01:11:40,620
Did Duke ever tell you about me?

1002
01:11:45,627 --> 01:11:46,526
No?

1003
01:11:46,528 --> 01:11:47,693
Well, I'm not surprised.

1004
01:11:47,695 --> 01:11:48,861
I was his first protégé.

1005
01:11:48,863 --> 01:11:52,432
Broke him in for you,
so to speak.

1006
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:54,367
I always said about Duke,
if he didn't teach me everything

1007
01:11:54,369 --> 01:11:56,736
I know, he certainly taught
me all the useful shit.

1008
01:11:56,738 --> 01:12:00,640
Well, I never fuckin' heard of
you, man, so what do you want?

1009
01:12:00,642 --> 01:12:02,408
I just killed him...

1010
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:04,277
because of you.

1011
01:12:08,216 --> 01:12:10,616
If that's true, Simon...

1012
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:12,652
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

1013
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:17,657
I imagined you'd say that.

1014
01:12:17,659 --> 01:12:21,227
Duke asked me to tell you he's
sorry he won't be there to watch

1015
01:12:21,229 --> 01:12:22,829
you cut out my heart.

1016
01:13:25,627 --> 01:13:27,293
Is Judy here?

1017
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:29,028
No, Judy's at a gig right now.

1018
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:33,299
She, uh, she'll be back
at around 1:00, 1:30.

1019
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:40,172
Come away with me.

1020
01:13:40,174 --> 01:13:40,873
What?

1021
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,241
Come with me.

1022
01:13:42,243 --> 01:13:43,376
Come with you where?

1023
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:45,411
Uh, I don't know.

1024
01:13:45,413 --> 01:13:48,214
Just... go away together.

1025
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:51,450
Go someplace nobody can find us.

1026
01:14:00,528 --> 01:14:02,562
Judy's pregnant.

1027
01:14:04,866 --> 01:14:07,533
We weren't even tryin'.

1028
01:14:07,535 --> 01:14:09,235
We just found out.

1029
01:14:45,306 --> 01:14:48,207
She's here.
Stay back.

1030
01:17:07,014 --> 01:17:09,381
I asked Michael to
run away with me.

1031
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,918
Do you believe that, Toni?

1032
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,955
My own sister's fiancé.

1033
01:17:17,592 --> 01:17:21,393
I didn't even think about
the consequences for Jude.

1034
01:17:21,395 --> 01:17:24,730
I've never told anyone this...

1035
01:17:24,732 --> 01:17:27,700
but I've been paid
to kill 41 people.

1036
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:36,208
And even after all that...

1037
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:41,046
it wasn't until I did
that to my sister...

1038
01:17:41,048 --> 01:17:44,617
that I really knew
what I was capable of.

1039
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,426
I know my secret's
safe with you.

1040
01:18:01,736 --> 01:18:04,003
Aaah!

1041
01:18:29,797 --> 01:18:31,864
Now we're square.

1042
01:18:31,866 --> 01:18:33,499
It's paid.

1043
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:37,636
Never, ever bother
my family again.

1044
01:18:37,638 --> 01:18:41,173
We're done now.

1045
01:22:17,591 --> 01:22:20,159
Simon.

1046
01:22:20,161 --> 01:22:22,561
It's a lovely
morning for it, Ava.

1047
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:25,164
I see you took a
trip to the minibar.

1048
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:26,899
What would Duke say?

1049
01:22:29,036 --> 01:22:31,036
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Shocking.

1050
01:23:50,117 --> 01:23:51,283
I'm a little bit rusty.

1051
01:24:03,597 --> 01:24:04,997
Hey, come here!

1052
01:24:24,818 --> 01:24:25,717
You know what, Simon?

1053
01:24:29,023 --> 01:24:30,355
Shut up, babe.

1054
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:33,158
Oh, that's right.

1055
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,228
You don't like it when I
talk to my subjects, do you?

1056
01:24:38,332 --> 01:24:40,232
This time...

1057
01:24:40,234 --> 01:24:41,733
I know what you did.

1058
01:24:54,648 --> 01:24:56,782
Fuckin' hell.

1059
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,727
Count no man happy...

1060
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:10,195
Until the end is known.

1061
01:25:10,197 --> 01:25:11,530
Yeah.

1062
01:25:13,701 --> 01:25:16,168
Yeah, Duke made me read
all that Greek shit too.

1063
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:25,677
I see why he liked
you so much, Ava.

1064
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,246
You've got moxie.

1065
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:43,895
If I see you again, I
will fucking kill you.

1066
01:26:27,241 --> 01:26:28,807
Go that way.

1067
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,776
Attention, hotel guests,

1068
01:26:30,778 --> 01:26:32,811
please evacuate the building.

1069
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:34,980
Do not attempt to
use the elevators.

1070
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:37,149
Please use the stairwell.

1071
01:26:37,151 --> 01:26:39,017
This is not a drill.

1072
01:26:39,019 --> 01:26:41,086
Evacuate the hotel immediately.

1073
01:27:54,661 --> 01:27:57,929
Management Code 98045FT.

1074
01:27:57,931 --> 01:27:59,898
Put security around my
family on high alert.

1075
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,999
Double the guard detail.

1076
01:28:02,536 --> 01:28:04,669
The object is still open.

1077
01:29:03,664 --> 01:29:05,330
Agh!

1078
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:26,785
My family.

1079
01:29:26,787 --> 01:29:29,921
I have no interest in them.

1080
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:36,761
I do understand that if you...

1081
01:29:36,763 --> 01:29:40,332
...if you wanted to take
your time with this.

1082
01:29:46,473 --> 01:29:49,774
Count of five?

1083
01:29:50,611 --> 01:29:51,409
Why not?

1084
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:56,648
One.

1085
01:30:16,737 --> 01:30:19,738
I'm here for my sister.

1086
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:22,040
Holy... Oh my God, get
in here, get inside.

1087
01:30:22,676 --> 01:30:24,409
I need to talk to you alone.

1088
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:27,145
We're fine.

1089
01:30:28,181 --> 01:30:29,548
We're fine.

1090
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:31,816
What happened?

1091
01:30:33,086 --> 01:30:34,686
I need you to listen to me.

1092
01:30:34,688 --> 01:30:37,188
Go get Mom and get out
of the country tonight.

1093
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:39,090
Just for a month or two
until I can contact you.

1094
01:30:39,092 --> 01:30:40,025
What?

1095
01:30:40,027 --> 01:30:41,760
Don't go to Europe or the UK.

1096
01:30:42,095 --> 01:30:44,229
You sound crazy right now.

1097
01:30:44,231 --> 01:30:45,730
Here's an account
number and a code for

1098
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:48,033
an offshore account in my name.

1099
01:30:48,035 --> 01:30:50,068
Memorize this and
then burn it, Jude.

1100
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,337
There's $500,000 in there.

1101
01:30:52,339 --> 01:30:54,372
Use whatever you need.

1102
01:30:54,374 --> 01:30:56,207
Here's $20,000.

1103
01:30:56,209 --> 01:30:58,677
This will be enough to get you
all out of the country and safe.

1104
01:30:58,679 --> 01:31:00,045
What the fuck?

1105
01:31:00,047 --> 01:31:01,446
Jude, come on, listen.

1106
01:31:01,448 --> 01:31:02,914
Are you fucking listening to me?

1107
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:06,751
I need to you to do exactly
what I'm telling you to do.

1108
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:07,619
What? What is going on?

1109
01:31:07,621 --> 01:31:09,421
Why would I do that?

1110
01:31:09,423 --> 01:31:10,622
Because I need you to
take care of the family

1111
01:31:10,624 --> 01:31:13,191
the way I was never able to.

1112
01:31:13,193 --> 01:31:17,429
All right?

1113
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:19,197
You're a momma now.

1114
01:31:20,233 --> 01:31:21,766
Okay?

1115
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:27,839
You need to take care
of your baby.

1116
01:31:31,244 --> 01:31:34,512
I could never make him as
happy as you obviously do.

1117
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:38,383
This came for you.

1118
01:31:41,888 --> 01:31:44,122
Thank you.

1119
01:31:45,892 --> 01:31:48,193
Ava.

1120
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:55,166
Who are you?

1121
01:31:55,168 --> 01:31:58,003
Nobody that you want
your child to know.

1122
01:32:08,281 --> 01:32:12,584
Count no man as happy
until his end is known.

1123
01:32:12,586 --> 01:32:16,688
What Simon would call
all that Greek shit.

1124
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:18,957
It's not until you
know how someone dies

1125
01:32:18,959 --> 01:32:22,460
that you know what
really mattered to them.

1126
01:32:22,462 --> 01:32:25,530
What they cared about,
what they'd sacrifice for.

1127
01:32:25,532 --> 01:32:27,132
What they would die for.

1128
01:32:27,134 --> 01:32:32,037
Who they loved and who
loved them in return.

1129
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:35,774
We don't have much
control over our lives.

1130
01:32:35,776 --> 01:32:38,309
But our end?

1131
01:32:38,311 --> 01:32:41,212
Sometimes we write that story.

1132
01:32:41,214 --> 01:32:44,983
If you're getting this,
you know my end.

1133
01:32:44,985 --> 01:32:49,621
I've never been happier.

1134
