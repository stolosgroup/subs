00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,200
<i>(woman)</i> Your Highness, please allow
me to make this little contribution.

3
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,700
<i>(man)</i> No, I cannot accept it.

4
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,300
But think of what these
could do for your cause.

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,000
Even though I know they would mean
freedom for many of my people...

6
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,600
...I will not take them.
- Please. Please!

7
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,300
- These could save the lives of many men.
- The men of my country are proud.

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,600
They would die rather than have
their prince accept charity.

9
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,300
Then think of the lives
of the women, the mothers...

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,100
The women of my country
fight alongside the men.

11
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,900
They are also too proud to accept charity.

12
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,800
Then consider the lives of the children.

13
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,300
The innocent children.

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,000
But... for the children.

15
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,400
She's the blonde
in the blue sequinned dress.

16
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,900
Extremely rich, very married...

17
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,400
...eminently corruptible
and a willing infidel.

18
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,300
Perfect.

19
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,900
<i>(croupier) Faites vos jeux!</i>

20
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,900
<i>Rien ne va plus!</i>

21
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
<i>Sept rouge, inpair et manque!</i>

22
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,200
<i>Faites vos jeux, messieurs!</i>

23
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Monsieur Andre, would you see
what you can get for this?

24
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,600
- Not the royal ring, Your Highness?
- Sh!

25
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,900
Do you want the whole world to know?

26
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,900
Excuse me.
Is that man there truly royalty?

27
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,300
- No, madame.
- But you called him "Your Highness".

28
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
It was a faux pas. Please forget it.

29
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,900
You can trust me, I won't tell.

30
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,700
Madame, I am the police chief
of Beaumont-sur-Mer.

31
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,100
What makes you Americans
think you can buy anyone at any price?

32
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,500
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No!

33
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,000
- I've already caused the prince enough...
- Prince?

34
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,900
He sounded like he was in trouble.
Perhaps I can help.

35
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,300
If you really want to help, forget
everything that you have seen and heard.

36
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,800
Forget the very existence...

37
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,100
...of that brilliant, extraordinary man...

38
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
...of destiny.

39
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Your Highness...

40
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,600
Your Highness, don't be alarmed.
I can be trusted.

41
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,200
- Are you one of my subjects?
- No. I'm an American.

42
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Fanny Eubanks of Omaha.

43
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,600
I couldn't help overhearing.
If you're in trouble and I can help...

44
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,900
Thank you. But I cannot accept.

45
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,900
You've already risked
too much just in speaking to me.

46
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,100
I still wanna help.

47
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,400
You must understand.
I have powerful enemies.

48
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,500
They may be watching even as we...

49
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
My God, you're attractive.

50
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,000
It's late.

51
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,900
I must go.

52
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,000
- Has he left?
- Yes. Just a moment ago.

53
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,900
Good.

54
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,700
Please. You must tell me where he lives.

55
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,400
- I feel it only fair to warn you...
- I know he has powerful enemies.

56
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,400
There may also be an emotional risk.

57
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,100
You see, His Highness has
been a widower for five years.

58
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,400
For five years?

59
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
<i>(Fanny)</i> Please, Your Highness.

60
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,700
<i>("Prince")</i>
Fanny... the Freedom Fighters thank you.

61
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
This is for the overhead.

62
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,200
This goes to you, Arthur.

63
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,900
This goes to you, Andre.

64
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,900
This goes to me...
which means it's time to go to Zurich.

65
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,500
Excuse me. May I sit here, please?

66
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
- If you like.
- Thank you.

67
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,800
Good evening, sir.
Would you like to see the menu?

68
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,500
Oh, yes. I'm starving.

69
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,900
Really starving.

70
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,800
Oh! Prices.

71
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Woo!

72
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,100
I think I'll just have some water.

73
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
- Water?
- Yes.

74
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,600
Only water? But you seemed so hungry.

75
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,500
I'm saving my money
for something special.

76
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
- My mother.
- Your mother?

77
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,600
Well, she's not really my mother.
Actually, she's my grandmother.

78
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,700
But she raised me.

79
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,900
My real parents... didn't want me.

80
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,000
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- But my grandmother is wonderful.

81
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,200
She has a laugh
that can make the birds sing.

82
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,600
But she's been quite ill lately... and
the hospital bills have been adding up.

83
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,500
I just wanna do my share.

84
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,500
It's kinda tough for me because
I was never very good with money.

85
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,900
I just seem to take what the Red Cross
pays me and I give it right back to them.

86
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,800
But I am going to help my gram-gram.

87
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,300
She is the one who taught me
it is better to be truthful and good...

88
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,000
...than to not.

89
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,500
- Waiter!
- What are you doing?

90
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Waiter.

91
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,800
- Give this man whatever he wants.
- I can't let you buy me a meal!

92
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,500
Nonsense.

93
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,500
I'll have a double turkey sandwich
on white, fries, a large knockwurst...

94
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,400
...three bags of chips,
a chocolate milk and two beers.

95
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,900
Why don't you have a beer? Three beers.

96
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,500
Thank you.

97
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,200
Forgot I had a first-class ticket.

98
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,400
<i>(chuckles)</i>

99
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,400
- That bother you?
- No.

100
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,900
# I love to love you in the night...

101
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,700
I couldn't help overhearing
your conversation in the dining car.

102
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,300
My condolences to your grandmother.

103
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,600
Huh?

104
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Oh!

105
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,600
Oh... right(!)

106
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,700
Didn't you say she was taken ill?

107
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,300
I tell 'em what they wanna hear
if it gets me what I want.

108
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Rather a shabby trick, isn't it?

109
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,500
I can tell you've got
a lot to learn about women.

110
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,600
Yes, I'm afraid I am a bit naive
when it comes to the weaker sex.

111
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,700
Freddy Benson.

112
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,600
- And you are?
- Lawrence Jamieson.

113
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,200
- You're married, aren't you?
- You can tell?

114
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Listen.

115
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,200
We're the weaker sex.
Men don't live as long as women.

116
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,300
We get more heart attacks,
more strokes, more prostate trouble.

117
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,100
I say it's time for a change.

118
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,100
I say let them give us money.
Let's live off them for a while.

119
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,700
That probably shocks
a guy like you, right?

120
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,600
Well, it's rather a revolutionary thought.

121
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,400
Do you really think it's possible?

122
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,500
<i>(laughs)</i>

123
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,600
Look what I did in the dining car!
She gave me 100 francs.

124
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,600
That's like, uh... 20 bucks!

125
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,800
Do you have any idea what it feels like
to take a woman for 20 bucks?

126
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,200
No, I haven't.
I'm afraid it's a little out of my class.

127
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,700
<i>(tuts)</i>

128
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
- What?
- It's too bad.

129
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,900
We could've had a blast on the Riviera.

130
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,100
- You're headed for the Riviera?
- Yeah.

131
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,000
There's a little town there, supposed
to be crawling with rich women.

132
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,600
Oh. And what town is that?

133
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,200
Uh... Beaumont-sur-Mer.

134
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,800
Beaumont-sur-Mer? <i>(laughs)</i>

135
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm afraid you've been misinformed.

136
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Beaumont used to be lively, but it's been
taken over by older, retired couples.

137
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,800
- Older, retired couples? Are you sure?
- Yes, I live there.

138
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,600
I'm considered to be the town's playboy.

<i>(whistles)</i>

140

All the social activity
has gone to the Italian Riviera.

141
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,900
Portofino.

142

<i>(exhales)</i>

143
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,600
Still doesn't hurt to check it out. Some
of these sleepy towns really pay off.

144
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,600
Would you excuse me?
I have to phone my wife and children.

145
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,600
I like to let them know
what time I'm arriving.

- Afraid so.

147
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,100
Well, here we are.

148
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,800
- Older, retired couples?
<i>- (Lawrence chuckles)</i>

149
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
- You have a ride into town?
- Yes, I have.

150
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,000
- Great. You can give me lift.
- Do you have a hotel room?

151
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,200
- I never make reservations.
- Excuse me. Is this the Portofino train?

152
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Yes, it is. But we're getting off, right?

153
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,700
<i>Scusi.</i>

It's about 170km. I live there.

158
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
- No!
- Yes!

159
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,600
Come and stay with me.
You can go to Portofino later.

160
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,200
I would love to, but my grandmother
is there and she's expecting me.

161
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,000
- Your grandmother is living in Portofino?
- Yes. Actually, she's quite ill.

162
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,600
Well, good luck. Give my best to your
grandmother. I hope her health improves.

163
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
<i>- Ciao.</i>
<i>- Ciao.</i>

164
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
<i>Ciao.</i>

165
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,000
Your phone call did not
give me much time.

166
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,100
Marion was perfect.

167
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,100
Make sure she gets back all right, Andre.

168
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,100
May I ask why she was necessary?

169
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,200
I needed a decoy.
This idiot was sharing my compartment.

170
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,800
He fancied himself as a bit of a player.

171
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,900
Said he was going to do
some hunting in my Beaumont-sur-Mer.

172
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,500
Monsieur Lawrence,
you can afford to dismiss such amateurs.

173
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,400
- Surely he was no match for you?
- You can't be too careful, Andre.

174
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,100
A poacher who shoots at rabbits
may scare big game away.

175
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,200
Hey, Lawrence, listen to this.

176
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,000
"A clever, young American con artist,
nicknamed The Jackal...

177
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,200
...has been working Western Europe."

178
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,300
If he's in the papers,
how clever can he be?

179
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Now, to business. Krista Knudsen.

180
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Widow of Lars Knudsen,
the Danish match king.

181
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,500
She left the Excelsior Hotel in Genoa...

182
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,700
...at 0740 hours this morning
in a white Ferrari.

183
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,800
She should be arriving at approximately...

184
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,200
Ah-hah!

185
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Here she is now.

186
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,300
<i>(woman)</i> I would like
to help your grandmother.

187
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
- I got some money here.
- <i>(Freddy)</i> Oh, no. No, I wouldn't accept it.

188
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,900
That's strange.
There's a young man with her.

189
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,400
- Please, I insist. I insist.
- I'm gonna pay you back.

190
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,200
- The poacher?
- Yes.

191
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,400
And he's no longer satisfied with rabbits.

192
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,200
Monsieur Police Inspector,
can you arrange something for me?

193
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,800
- I'm gonna pay you back, though.
- No!

194
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,700
The usual?

195
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,000
<i>Bonjour!</i>

196
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
<i>Bonjour!</i>

197
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,300
<i>Bonjour!</i>

198
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,400
Hey! Encore, encore!

199
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,800
<i>(Freddy whoops)</i>

200
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,100
Yee-ha!

201
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
# Da da-da da da

202
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
# Da-da da-da da da

203
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,100
# Da-da da-da da da daa!

204
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,400
Monsieur!

205
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,900
<i>Merci.</i>

206
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,900
Something like this, OK?
All right, here we go! Here we go!

207
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,500
OK. Two more! Two more.
How much is it?

208
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,400
Have you seen enough, Mrs Knudsen?

209
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,200
That money was to go toward
an operation for his grandmother!

210
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Here we go! Ha ha haa!

211
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,500
He's a confidence man. A trickster.
Will Madame sign the complaint?

212
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,500
Gladly.

213
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
I told you, I didn't steal any money
from her! She gave it to me.

214
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,700
She filed this complaint against you.

215
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,000
She caught me with another woman.
You're French, you understand that!

216
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,700
To be with another woman, that is French.

217
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,800
To be caught, that is American.

218
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,600
God! All right, what am I gonna do?
How am I gonna get out of here?

219
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,500
It's very difficult. The charge is a serious
one and you are a vagrant, an unknown.

220
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Listen, I'm not a vagrant!

221
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,100
This is my point!

222
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,700
I know somebody here.
I met him on a train. His name is...

223
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,700
His name is... James... No.

224
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,500
His name is... James Josephson.

225
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,800
Oh, no, no!

226
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,600
James Lawrence. Lawrence! Lawrence!

227
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,100
Lawrence...

228
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
Lawrence Fells. Lawrence Fings.

229
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,900
Forest Lawrenceton.

230
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,600
La... Lars. Lars!

231
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,200
Lawrence. Lawrence Lacko...

232
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,400
Lawrence...

233
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
His name is James Jessenden.

234
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,900
Lawrence Fells. Lawrence Jesterton.

235
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Lawrence Jesterton.

236
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
- Lawrence Jamieson?
- Yes!

237
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,500
Yes! Yes! We're like this!

238
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,400
Freddy. This is really very serious.

239
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,800
- They don't treat gigolos lightly in France.
- What do you mean?

240
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,900
Until 75 years ago,
they were still castrating them.

241
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,800
Don't say that word.

242
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,900
- What do they do now?
- Well, that depends who the judge is.

243
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>- Inspecteur, qui est le juge?</i>
- <i>(chuckles)</i> Reynoux.

244
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,200
Oh. Judge Reynoux.

245
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,400
<i>(both inhale)</i>

246
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,900
- Good luck, Freddy.
- No, no. You can't go. You gotta help me.

247
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,900
- Do you have any money?
- Yeah, I got about 12... 900 dollars.

248
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,600
No, I know this chap.
He'll want at least 5,000.

249
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,500
5,000? I don't have 5,000!

250
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,400
- Can you get it?
- I have it at home.

251
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,100
- I could fly home and mail him a cheque.
- OK.

252
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
<i>- Inspecteur!</i>
<i>- Oui?</i>

253
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,300
<i>Est-il possible...</i>

254
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
<i>(whispering)</i>

255
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,100
<i>Non! Non, non, pas possible! Crיtin!</i>

256
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,100
Freddy.

257
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,900
He says you can go... Ah-ah-ah!

258
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,100
He's got to have the rest
of the money within 48 hours...

259
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,300
...or he'll submit your name to Interpol
and you'll never travel in Europe again.

260
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,300
That's fine, that's fine.
Thank you, thank you.

261
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,900
Thank you, Lawrence Jamieson.

262
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,200
You know, I'm pretty good
at sizing people up...

263
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,200
...and I think you are one terrific guy.

264
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,000
I suppose I get pleasure
from helping people like you out.

265
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,000
- I see you know His Highness.
- Who?

266
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,000
- The prince.
- The prince?

267
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,600
I saw him shake your hand
and pat you on the back.

268
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
No kidding!

269
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,800
- And you are?
- Fanny Eubanks.

270
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,100
Fanny Eubanks? Of Omaha?

271
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,900
- Of Omaha?
- You don't have to cover up with me.

272
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,100
It may be my money
that's financing your mission.

273
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,600
You're financing my mission?

274
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,000
Perhaps His Highness has mentioned me?

275
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,300
Oh, <i>Lady</i> Fanny of Omaha?

276
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,700
He called me Lady Fanny?

277
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,900
Oh, yes. Lady Fanny of Omaha.
He speaks of you with great affection.

278
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,300
Drink, sir?

279
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
You have done a wonderful thing.

280
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,200
Sir.

281
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,700
Excuse me. I'm very sorry, sir,
but the man said it was urgent.

282
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
- What man?
- The courier, sir. He's waiting outside.

283
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,000
He said you would recognise
the secret password.

284
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,300
- What secret password?
<i>- (Freddy)</i> Lady Fanny of Omaha!

285
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,500
Hi!

286
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,100
Could you take this to the guest bedroom
and see everything is pressed?

287
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,700
Go ahead, Arthur.

288
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,300
Wow!

289
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,900
Wo-ha-ha-how! Wow!

290
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,100
All I can say is "wow"!

291
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,100
What an asshole I was
telling <i>you</i> how to take women!

292
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,800
All right. How much do you want?

293
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,600
Oh, Your Highness,
I don't want money from a man...

294
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,100
...who needs every penny
to free his enslaved people.

295
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,300
<i>(laughs)</i>

296
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,500
- What do you want?
- This!

297
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,800
This! I want this!

298
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
This is what I want.

299
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,400
I don't want money. I want you
to teach me. I'm in your hands.

300
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,500
- You can't be serious.
- Larry...

301
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,100
Lawrence.

302
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,300
All my life, I wanted to be the best at
something. I thought I was, till I met you.

303
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,600
I never realised how far
you could go with this scamming thing.

304
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,900
- You've opened my eyes!
- Freddy, this "scamming" thing...

305
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,900
...as you put it, took me years to perfect.

306
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,200
- I got time.
- Why should I help you?

307
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,700
A guy with my mouth could ruin
a lot of business around here for you.

308
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,700
What sort of an education did you have?

309
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
High school diploma.

310
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,600
And you majored in?

311
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,700
- Metal shop.

- Stop worrying, Andre.
- I tell you, it is a mistake to take him in!

my money on wine you can't drink...

00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,000

00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,500
<i>- Au revoir,</i> Lawrence.
- <i>Au revoir,</i> Andre.

468
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,400
<i>(man)</i> Oh, Miss! Miss!

469
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,500
Excuse me.
Where can I get the <i>Wall Street Journal?</i>

470
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,400
I'm trying to find out the stock prices
to see how my takeover bid is going.

471
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,700
It's so hard to get
the stock prices around here.

472
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,100
<i>Au revoir!</i>

473
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,900
What are you doing here?

474
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,400
You know, that's a funny story.

475
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,600
I was at the train station, ticket in hand...

476
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,300
...and I thought "What am I leaving
this place for? I love me here!"

477
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,400
So, I'll be around a little bit more.
Lucky you.

478
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,200
Freddy. Freddy!

479
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,400
Freddy!

480
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,000
There simply isn't enough room
for both of us to work Beaumont-sur-Mer.

481
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,400
- You know what? I think you're scared.
- Of what?

482
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,500
Competition. You've been top dog here
for so long, you think you own the place.

483
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,700
Nice!

484
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,600
- Believe me, Freddy, I'm not afraid of you.
- Sure you are, and you should be.

485
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,100
I'm younger than you.
I'm better-looking than you.

486
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,900
I'm thinner than you. I could kick your
ass off this hill in a New York minute.

487
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,800
And I could have you arrested again.

488
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,000
And I could always call
Lady Fanny of Omaha.

489
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,600
Freddy, as a younger man...

490
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,000
...I was a sculptor,
a painter and a musician.

491
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,500
There was just one problem.

492
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,100
I wasn't very good.

493
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,700
As a matter of fact, I was dreadful.

494
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,900
I finally came to the frustrating conclusion
that I had taste and style, but not talent.

495
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,200
I knew my limitations.

496
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,100
We all have our limitations, Freddy.

497
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,500
Fortunately,
discovered that taste and style...

498
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,300
...were commodities that people desired.

499
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,000
Freddy, what I'm saying is...
know your limitations.

500
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,200
You are a moron.

501
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,600
You've been trying to get me
out of this town ever since I came here.

502
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,100
I'll tell you what. We'll make a bet.

503
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,700
If I lose, I'll leave.

504
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,900
If I win... you leave.

505
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,600
All right, Freddy, suppose we try this.

506
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,200
We find a woman, set a price...

507
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,400
...and the first man to extract
the correct amount from her wins.

508
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,100
But if you...

509
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But if you lose,
you not only leave town graciously...

510
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,700
...you promise never to come back
to Beaumont-sur-Mer again.

511
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,900
Done. Who's the woman?

512
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,800
<i>- (woman)</i> Ooh!

Who is she?

517
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,200
I believe she is
the United States Soap Queen.

518
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,000
Thank you, Charles.

519
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,800
- OK, how much?
- She's a little young, isn't she?

520
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,300
Out of your league?

521
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,800
All right. I'll make it easy for you. $50,000.

522
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,200
$50,000?!

523
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,000
Out of <i>your</i> league?

524
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
All right. I could use $50,000.

525
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,300
First one to get 50,000 out of her.

526
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,500
May the best man win.

527
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,500
Thank you.

528
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,200
She is at the roulette table...

529
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,200
...just waiting for Your Highness.

He has dropped from sight.

532
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,500
Perhaps the Jackal finally realises
he is no match for the lion, huh?

533
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,200
Keep your eyes open, Andre. He'll turn up.

10,000 francs.

Freddy... would an operation help you?

584
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
No. My problem isn't physical.

585
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,600
- It's emotional.
- Really?

586
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,600
I'm on six weeks' MTL.

587

Mental trauma leave.

588
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,400
- What happened?
- Well...

589
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,500
...I was engaged to a girl
back in the States.

590
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,100
And we loved to dance.

591
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,900
We wanted to be professionals.
Isn't that silly?

592
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,700
And we got an opportunity
to perform on TV, on <i>Dance USA.</i>

593
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,800
And we decided that if we won,
we'd get married.

594
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,400
So, we went on and we danced,
and we won!

595
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,000
Oh, great!

596
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,700
And in the excitement... we got separated.

597
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,600
So I went back to the studio...

598
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,700
...and there they were...

599
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,900
...naked...

600
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,000
...dancing.

601
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,900
And then they stopped...

602
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,800
...and they made love,
right there on the dance floor.

603
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,100
Who was she with?

604
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,700
Deney Terrio, the host of <i>Dance USA.</i>

605

I'm sorry.

606
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,800
In the morning, I woke up
and my legs were useless.

Why don't you go to him?

A man like Schauffhausen
is in demand all over the world.

616

They're dancing. They're dancing!

624
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,700
Freddy, we are going up to my room
right now and write to Dr Schauffhausen.

625
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,900
- Oh, God! They're dancing!
- Ssh-ssh-ssh.

626
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,200
Oh, take me from this place!

627
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,300
Oh, God!

628
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,900
<i>(Freddy sobs)</i>

629
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,800
I wish you hadn't written
these things about me.

630
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,700
- You make me sound like a hero.
- They're true, aren't they?

631
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,300
Yes. Still, you shouldn't have
promised him the money.

632
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,500
Where am I gonna get $50,000?

633
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,600
You leave that to me, Freddy. When the
time comes, I promise you, you'll have it.

634
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,400
I'm going downstairs to mail this
letter and I'll be right back.

635
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,100
Janet.

636
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,200
Thank you.

Number one! Number one!

00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,200
Hello again! <i>(laughs)</i>

644
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,400
Are you Dr Schauffhausen?

645
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,300
- Yes, Fraulein.
- What a coincidence! This is a miracle!

646
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,700
I just wrote you a letter
about someone who needs your help.

647
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,900
<i>(German accent)</i> Good. I look forward to
reading it when I get back to my clinic.

648
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,600
<i>- Auf Wiedersehen.</i>
- Uh, what?

649
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,600
Goodbye. <i>(laughs)</i>

650
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,400
Could I just talk to you
for a minute, right now?

651
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,900
Please. I am on my vacation.

652
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,200
But it's about an American Naval Officer,
Fred Benson.

653
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,200
You saw him.
He was next to you at the roulette table.

654
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,400
- Benson. Benson.
- In the wheelchair?

655
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,700
Is he the one who wrote me
all those letters?

656
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,100
Something about his fiancיe
running off with a, uh... dancer.

657
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,100
That's the one!
And he's right here in the hotel.

658
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,400
I hate to disturb you while
you're on vacation, Doctor...

659
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,800
...but could I just get you
to take a look at him?

660
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,600
I'm sorry, <i>Frהu...</i> What is your name?

661
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,400
- Janet Colgate.
- Janet. Oh.

662
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:47,600
I am sorry, Janet, but if I see your friend
Benson, I have to see everyone.

663
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,700
I must draw the line somewhere.

664
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,200
- But if it's a matter of money, I...
- You haven't given him any money?

665
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,000
Just a bit.
For his grandmother's operation.

666
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,200
- Don't give him any more money.
- Why?

667
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,800
You see...

668
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
...his ego has taken
one shattering blow from a woman.

669
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,900
And, if he accepts charity
from a woman, that is another blow.

670
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,200
- It makes my work so much harder.
- Does that mean you'll see him?

671
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,400
- All right. I'll see him.
- That's wonderful!

672
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,300
But remember what I said.
No money for him.

673
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:33,200
If I do decide to take this case,
you must pay the fee directly to me.

674
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,200
- You understand?
- Absolutely.

675
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,900
All right.

676
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,300
Where is the boy?

677
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,600
<i>(laughter)</i>

<i>(Janet laughs)</i>

I have a wonderful surprise for you.

01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,700
- What?
- Cover your eyes.

685
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
- You are a nut!
- Go on.

<i>(giggles)</i>

687
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,700
Now, who is the one person in this world,
outside of your grandmother...

688
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,800
...that you would like <i>most</i>
to see at this moment?

689
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:36,000
- I give up! Who?
- Dr Emil Schauffhausen!

690
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,700
At last we meet, Officer Benson.

691
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,300
After all those letters,
I feel that I know you.

692
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,900
- He can't believe it's really you!
- Yes, I think that's it.

693
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,800
I am here to help you, my boy.

694
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,300
Great!

695
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,700
Now, let's have a look
at those legs, shall we?

696
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,900
So.

697
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,600
You are numb from the waist down?

698
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,300
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.

699
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,200
Completely numb?
No feeling whatsoever?

700
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,800
- That's right.
- Mm-hm.

701
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,900
So you won't be feeling Mr Piggy,
then, will you?

702
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,500
No.

703
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,900
Tell me if you feel this.

704
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,500
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

705
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,600
- No.
- No?

706

<i>(Lawrence sighs)</i>

707
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,300
We must try something else.

708
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,300
Something a little more stringent.

709
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,600
Now tell me, do you feel this?

710
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,300
No.

711
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,300
How about...

712
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,500
...that?

713
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,200
- Nothing.
- Nothing, hm?

714
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,400
Watch yourself, Janet! Back a little bit.

715

01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,200
<i>(Lawrence)</i> Nothing? Hmm.

718
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,200
Any feeling there?

No?

720
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,600
This case intrigues me, Janet.

721
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,700
- I will take Officer Benson as a patient.
- Did you hear that, Freddy?

722
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:58,900
I am renting a villa here. We will move
him in, and I will really go to work on him.

723
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:03,100
Oh, thank you, Doctor. Do you really
think you can get him to walk again?

724
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,800
I will have him running,
jumping, shouting, screaming...

725
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,400
...or my name isn't
Doctor Emil Schauffhausen...

- Protector of the Veld.
- What a pleasant surprise.

733
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,800
How was your mission to Belahavula?

734
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,500
It was a great success, thanks to you.

Lady Janet, this is Mrs Reed.

Your Highness. Your accent.

- Thank you, Your Highness.

<i>(Mrs Reed)</i> Oh, please!

Unfortunately, incurable.

Freddy, isn't this beautiful?
I can't believe this is really happening.

752
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:14,500
He's sacrificing his vacation and
sharing his villa. This is incredible.

753

Arthur, this is Miss Colgate.
She will be staying at the hotel.

754
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,800
But Officer Benson
will be staying with us.

Please don't worry.
You are close to my room.

756

I shall keep my eyes
on you night and day.

May I show you the villa?
It has a fascinating history.

Welcome to hell.

759
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,800
This is so beautiful.

760
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,900
Janet, we haven't discussed my fee yet.

761
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,000
It will be $50,000.

762
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,500
- Yes, I'll have to call my father.
- I wish I could make it lower...

763
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,300
...but the clinic would never allow that.
- Oh, I understand.

764
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,700
- Let me show you the rest of the villa.
- OK.

I'd like to come upstairs, too.

768

Of course you would. Come on!

769
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,000
- But he can't!
- Yes, he can. It's all in his mind.

770
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,800
- It seems so cruel.
- Trust me. I'm a doctor.

771
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,300
First, I will show you the music room.

772

- Isn't this beautiful?
- Mm.

I love all these old musical instruments.

775

This music box. This is my favourite.

- Listen.
<i>- (plays tune)</i>

Besides, knowing I helped a man like
Freddy be able to live his life again...

916

If we take her for everything,
she still ends up with a very nice mink.

All right. We'll forget about the money,
but the bet is still on.

- All right. What is the bet?

934

- A completely new bet.
- Yes, well, think of one.

First one to get her into bed.

Let me tell you something, Freddy.
This is for certain.

A woman like Janet would never
give herself to a man like you.

- You wanna bet?

All right, Freddy, I'll bet.
But I'm not competing to win.

Yeah, well, he did. I... couldn't sleep.

Well, come in.

Dr Schauffhausen told me.

That I could walk again
if the desire was strong enough?

963

Yes, he told me the same thing.

Janet...

...I think you're the only person in
the world who can give me that desire.

Well... what do you mean?

I love you...

But... I still have this terrible fear.

- That my feelings won't be returned.

Sure.

1087
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:39,700
And... shut the door.

1088
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:41,700
Yeah.

1089
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,100
<i>(laughs)</i>

1090
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,400
It's Andre, sir.

1091
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,200
Thank you.

1092
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:24,000
- Hello, Andre. What a lovely morning.
<i>- Monsieur Jamieson?</i>

1093
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,200
<i>- Are you lying down?</i>
- What?

1094
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,900
Miss Colgate was seen
returning to the hotel.

1095
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:34,700
<i>- But I took her to the plane.</i>
- Then somebody took her off.

1096
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:40,500
- Where's Freddy?
<i>- The Jackal is with Miss Colgate now.</i>

1097
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:44,400
<i>They have been together in her room,</i>
<i>with the curtains drawn.</i>

1098
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,800
Oh. And for how long?

1099
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,300
Oh, not long. But long enough.
It is a disaster.

1100
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,900
It seems the teacher
has underestimated the student.

1101
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,200
<i>We must accept defeat graciously.</i>

1102
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,300
Now I will prepare myself for the Jackal.

1103
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,500
I'm sure he'll be over here soon
to gloat over his victory.

1104
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,700
Thank you, my old friend.

1105
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:18,300
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

1106
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,900
- Janet!
<i>- (sobs)</i>

1107
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Janet. What is the matter?

1108
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:53,500
I know what you said,
but I just had to see him again.

1109
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:56,500
You see, I...
I thought I was in love with him.

1110
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,700
- What?
- I went back to see him and...

1111
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,100
- And?
- And...

1112
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,600
We made love and...

1113
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,500
I tried to please him,
but how could I have known?

1114
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:18,000
And then what happened was I fell asleep,
and when I woke up, he was gone.

1115
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:24,100
He took all my money. My mink,
my jewellery, my traveller's cheques.

1116
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:27,000
Even my little change purse.

1117
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,300
What kind of a man
would do something like that?

1118
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:36,200
And do you know what else?
I'm beginning to think that he could walk.

1119
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,800
That he pretended this whole thing
just to get to me and my money.

1120
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,600
It was all my savings, the prize money.
Everything.

1121
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,100
$50,000!

1122
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:49,800
Janet, I told you I'd waive my fee.

1123
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,700
It had already gotten here.
I had it in my purse.

1124
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,500
What am I gonna say to my father?
Some of the money was his.

1125
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,300
Arthur!

1126
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:06,400
Yes, sir?

1127
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:10,400
I want you to phone Andre
and tell him to find Officer Benson.

1128
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:13,800
It seems he has stolen
some of Miss Colgate's property.

1129
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:16,200
I shall be at the airport.

1130
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:19,600
Janet, I am going to cover your losses.

1131
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,700
You and your father
will get your $50,000 back...

1132
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:25,200
...and I am putting you on the next plane.

1133
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,600
And this time,
I will make sure you are on it.

1134
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:31,000
But you're not responsible.
How could you have known?

1135
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:34,700
Any good psychiatrist would have
known he was a charlatan.

1136
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:38,300
Come. In any case, it's cheaper
than a malpractice suit...

1137
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,400
...which I am sure you would win.

1138
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:44,700
- I can't take your money.
- You can, and you will. Take it.

1139
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:57,600
Janet, come on.

1140
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:01,300
- You change planes in Paris.
- OK.

1141
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,300
I don't feel good about taking your money.

1142
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,400
I feel good about it.

1143
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:09,400
It has been so great to meet you, I...

1144
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:14,600
If you're ever in Cleveland,
will you call me?

1145
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,800
I will.

1146
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:21,800
Goodbye.

1147
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,300
Goodbye.

1148
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,900
Janet!

1149
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:32,500
Have a good flight.

1150
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:34,700
Thank you!

1151
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:55,700
I can't take this. It doesn't belong to me.

1152
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,700
And I'll always have something
from you that means much more!

1153
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,000
Bye!

1154
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:05,000
Bye!

1155
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,900
Goodbye!

1156
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,600
<i>(siren)</i>

1157
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:31,400
Monsieur Jamieson! I caught him
at the hotel, at the scene of the crime.

1158
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,900
What crime?
What is this guy talking about?

1159
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,500
Listen, Freddy. This time,
she really is on that plane.

1160
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:41,800
- And you can't harm her again.
- You let her go? You gotta stop her!

1161
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,700
<i>(Freddy)</i> Hey! Hey!

1162
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:48,700
Hey! Hey! Hold it! Hold it!

01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:52,000
Come back! Hey, hey, hey!

1164
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,200
Hold it!

1165
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,000
You idiot! You let her go!

1166
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:01,600
You slept with her,
but you didn't have to steal her money.

1167
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,600
Steal her money? I didn't!
She stole from me.

1168
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:08,200
I'm about to win the bet and she says
"Close the drapes." I close them.

1169
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:13,400
"Close the door." I close it. "Would you
mind taking a shower?" I took a shower.

1170
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:17,200
When I come out, she's gone. My clothes,
my wallet and my watch are gone.

1171
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,600
She even took the 2,000 francs
she gave me!

1172
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:23,500
Do you expect me to believe that when
she's returned the $50,000 I gave her?

1173
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:27,400
- What $50,000?
- The $50,000 you stole from her.

1174
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,000
I didn't steal $50,000 from her!

1175
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,100
Hey, there's my clothes.

1176
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,900
"Hello, boys. It was fun."

1177
01:40:56,400 --> 01:41:01,000
"I'll miss you. Love, Janet. The Jackal."

1178
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:04,600
"PS. I'm keeping the money.
Is that wrong?"

1179
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:16,200
Of all the lousy...

1180
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,500
She is disgusting!

1181
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:21,600
She is lying! She is deceitful!
She is two-faced!

1182
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,100
She is conniving and she is dishonest!

1183
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,300
Yes.

1184
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,500
Isn't she wonderful?

I'm sorry I broke your VHS player.
Give me the model number.

- When I'm settled, I'll send you a cheque.
- Oh, shut up.

<i>(Freddy)</i> Well, thanks for
letting me stay the extra week.

the beginning. <i>J,</i> Janet. <i>J,</i> Jackal.

1190
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,400
If you think about it, it's obvious.

1191
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,400
When do you think she was onto us?

1192
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:09,400
<i>(Lawrence)</i> From the beginning, Freddy.

1193
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:12,100
She was onto us from the very beginning.

1194
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,200
She was perfect.

1195
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:25,600
<i>(Freddy)</i> So,
uh... what are you gonna do now?

1196
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:31,000
Well, things are going to be
quiet around here now.

1197
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:35,800
The season's over.

1198
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,100
Autumn's coming.

1199
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:41,500
I'll be shutting up part of the house.

1200

God, are you kidding me with this gravel?
These heels weren't made for this.

Hey! Hello! We made it.
Could youse get the bags up here pronto?

- Nikos, come here!
- All right, Paula.

Come on, everybody.
I want you to meet Mr Big Stuff. <i>(laughs)</i>

1215
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,600
I was showing Nikos property in Florida.

01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:52,400
He goes "I wanna invest
my 16 million bucks someplace new."

1217
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,500
I say "Where?"
He goes "How about Australia?"

1218
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:58,600
And then it hits me. Boom!
Australia, are you kidding me?

1219
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:03,400
We gotta go meet Mr Australia himself!
He goes "Why not?" I go "Why not?"

1220
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:07,200
- Pretty soon, the whole group goes...
<i>- (all)</i> "Why not?"

So here we are.

<i>(Australian accent)</i> G'day, Nikos.
How's it goin', sport? Good on ya, cobber.

1226

Chips O'Toole.
Hotels and oil from down under.

1227
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,100
Do you still have any situations
available in Sydney?

1228
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:50,000
No, it's all gone, Paula.

1229
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:53,100
Never mind, Nikos.
People drop out, don't they?

1230
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:57,400
Anyway, come on up to the house. We'll
put some shrimps on the barbie for ya.

1231

Hey, I almost forgot somebody!

1232
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,800
Mr Junior Partner.
The man Chips can't do without.

1233
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,400
The whiz kid. Randy Bentwick.

1234
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:11,500
Unfortunately, Randy is a mute.

1235
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:17,100
All right, everybody get on up
to the house for a drink.

1236
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:20,600
You wanna refresh those cocktails,
don't you?

1237
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,900
The ice is melting. Hurry, hurry.

1238
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,400
Go on up!
Follow the path around the house.

1239
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:27,800
Keep going! That's it, keep going!

1240
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:31,000
I'll be right up there.

1241
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:42,700
Fellas, last year I made $3 million.

1243
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Are you ready?

1244
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,800
Then let's go get 'em.

1245
01:46:53,305 --> 01:47:53,353
