2
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:37,300
I know I should know this, darling,
but are you mad at me?

3
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:39,942
Baby. Holly.

4
00:01:41,412 --> 00:01:45,279
I did something, right?
I did something bad, right?

5
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:46,972
Should I know what it is?

6
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:51,345
Or is it something
maybe you just think I did?

7
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:57,718
No, no. I did it. I did it.

8
00:01:58,461 --> 00:02:02,157
It was a bad, bad thing I did,
and I'm so sorry, luv.

9
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:04,923
Holly, come on, will you?

10
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,398
Holly, wait. Baby...

11
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:11,539
...you have to let me in on it.

12
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,441
Or are you waiting until we're in
the apartment before you talk to me?

13
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:20,076
Are you gonna make me
sleep in the bathtub again?

14
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:26,314
Oh, no, I don't know what I said.

15
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:29,615
- You said it. You know you said it.
- No, I don't know what I said...

16
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,350
...but I didn't mean it.
- You mean everything you say.

17
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:34,618
Sometimes I mean nothing
when I say something.

18
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:37,058
Something is never nothing.
It's always something.

19
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,664
Most of what I say is nothing.
Just something to say.

20
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:43,132
Men say it's just something to say
to get away with saying something...

21
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:46,534
...but they know they're saying something.
- Say what? What did I say?

22
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:49,800
You said at my mother's, you
would have a baby but I'm not ready.

23
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:52,569
To my mother! You might as well
have said I'm a lesbian.

24
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:54,804
Well, I am the only man you ever had.

25
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,313
Oh, I dated Timmy Harrison
for four months before I met you.

26
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:00,679
- Isn't he a woman now?
- Aah!

27
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:02,844
<i>You told my mother
I didn't want children!</i>

28
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:05,115
- I did not. I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

29
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,689
- Yes, you did. You said exactly that.
- I did not.

30
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:12,353
I didn't say that you weren't ready to
have a baby. I said that you wanted to wait.

31
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,464
Which means I don't want one right now.

32
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:16,224
- Right.
- Thank you.

33
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:18,961
Wait a minute. I'm confused.
Can I get a ruling on this?

34
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:21,298
No, you're not confused.
You're just wrong.

35
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,338
"Holly doesn't wanna have a baby. "
We had a plan, Gerry.

36
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:27,204
To wait to have children
until we could buy an apartment...

37
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:30,437
...put 25 percent of each paycheck
into a separate joint account...

38
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:33,606
...with a 6.25 interest for 5 years.
Why didn't you tell my mother that?

39
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:36,252
Ha-ha-ha. Each paycheck?

40
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,218
Darling, you only just started
getting regular paychecks.

41
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,449
- You quit five jobs in two years, remember?
- Well, I can't work for idiots.

42
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:46,322
- They can't all be idiots.
- Yes, they can.

43
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:49,589
They can all be idiots.
And why didn't you tell my mother...

44
00:03:49,765 --> 00:03:52,791
...about the business loan you and John
took out without asking me?

45
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,435
Oh... Aha!

46
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:57,003
You see, you... You finally said it.

47
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:59,732
- I knew that's why you're angry.
- That's not the reason.

48
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:00,897
It is not the reason.

49
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:02,976
- It is the reason.
- We should have waited.

50
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:06,841
Waited for what? What? I've been
driving limos for four years, Holly.

51
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:12,281
So John and me, we wanna start a business.
We buy a few cars, we get a few clients.

52
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:14,785
That's a career right there.
What is your problem?!

53
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,788
What if it doesn't work?
What if we always have to live here?

54
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,688
And what about what I want, huh?

55
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,988
You think
I wanna be a real estate agent...

56
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,723
...showing apartments to buy
that I can never live in?

57
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,231
There may be other things
I wanna do with my life.

58
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:31,700
- Okay. Like what?
- I don't know. Other things.

59
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:37,368
Then quit, all right? The job makes you
cranky at home every bloody day anyway.

60
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,841
- You wanna have a baby? Let's do it.
- See?

61
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:42,378
- I hate when you do that.
- Hah. Do what?

62
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,015
"Let's have a baby. " La-la-la!

63
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:48,483
In a five-floor walkup we can barely move
in. I'd change diapers on the windowsill.

64
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:52,680
You have to have a plan. You can't act like
everything's just gonna work out by itself.

65
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:55,917
Why do I have to be
the responsible grownup who worries?

66
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:59,860
Why can't I be the cute, carefree
Irish guy who sings all the time?

67
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,896
Because you can't sing
without making dogs bark.

68
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:08,596
Look, Holly, people have babies
with no money all the time.

69
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:12,368
If you're so worried about it, why don't
you stop buying designer clothes?

70
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:14,306
I buy everything on eBay.

71
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,242
It doesn't count when you're wearing
Marc Jacobs from Minneapolis.

72
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:25,548
Do you want to have a baby?

73
00:05:25,855 --> 00:05:28,551
- Do you?
- Yes, I do.

74
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,625
- See?
- See what?

75
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:33,558
I know what you're really saying
even when you don't say it.

76
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,459
You mean the two conversations thing.

77
00:05:35,632 --> 00:05:38,226
The one we're having
and the one you think we're having.

78
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:42,268
You said that to my mother because you're
mad at me for not wanting children yet...

79
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:48,706
...and because I'm no fun anymore and
we don't have enough hot, nasty sex...

80
00:05:48,877 --> 00:05:53,041
...because I'm always bitching about bills.
Why don't you just be honest and say it?

81
00:05:53,215 --> 00:05:55,149
Say what you mean.

82
00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:58,046
All right.

83
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:02,682
I wish we had more hot, nasty sex.

84
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:06,420
Or the other kind is fine.

85
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:09,654
What you're really saying is this
isn't the life you wanted, is it?

86
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:13,761
Well, that's not what I'm saying.
Is that what you're saying?

87
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:17,961
And what if this is it, Gerry?
What if this is all there is to our life?

88
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:20,106
- What do you mean?
- It means this is it.

89
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:22,468
We're a married couple
who own a limo company...

90
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:25,202
...who may or may not have children,
end of story.

91
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:27,903
- Well, what other story do you want?
- I don't know. L...

92
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:29,810
What do you want, Hol? What?

93
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,480
Because I'm tired
of trying to figure it out.

94
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:35,643
You want a bigger apartment?
I'll take a second job.

95
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:38,346
You want a child, you don't want a child.
What?

96
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:43,951
I know what I want because
I have it in my hands right now.

97
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:47,655
Do you?
Do you know what you want?

98
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:50,995
Because you better tell me now
if I'm not it.

99
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:54,327
Or what? You gonna leave?

100
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:56,473
- You want me to leave?
- If you wanna leave.

101
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:59,303
- Don't use me as an excuse.
- I'll leave if you want me to.

102
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:00,842
Then leave if you wanna go.

103
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:03,344
- Don't push me.
- You wanna leave, just say goodbye.

104
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:05,037
Oh, that's me bollocks!

105
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,945
- Stop acting bilingual.
- Oh, kiss me arse.

106
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:10,279
Kiss mine in English!

107
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:35,009
Are we finished now, luv?
Can I come back?

108
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:37,945
Yeah.

109
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:42,743
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

110
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:48,851
- I'm sorry, luv. Ahhh.
- I'm sorry.

111
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:55,093
I'm sorry I said the wrong thing
to your mother.

112
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:57,787
God, I still get nervous around her.

113
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:01,093
I still think after nine years,
she doesn't like me.

114
00:08:01,268 --> 00:08:02,565
I know I'm being stupid.

115
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:07,002
No, you're not being stupid, baby.
She doesn't like you.

116
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:11,509
Really? And I thought deep down,
she really loved me.

117
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:15,580
No, she doesn't.
I was 19 when we got married.

118
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:19,779
And you corrupted me
with sex and charm...

119
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:24,083
...and the longer it takes you to make your
fortune, the less sexy and charming you are.

120
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:25,485
Hmm.

121
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:28,252
What? What are you looking for?

122
00:08:28,428 --> 00:08:32,557
Me balls. They were hanging there
a minute ago.

123
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:38,260
My mother said it was a mistake marrying
you because I loved you too much.

124
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:40,098
"It won't last. "

125
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:43,332
I don't wanna make any mistakes, Gerry.

126
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,141
Well, you're in the wrong species, luv.
Be a duck.

127
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:54,341
My baby.

128
00:08:54,919 --> 00:09:00,050
We're not a mistake
just because we don't have any money.

129
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,316
And we are gonna last.

130
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:05,456
You know how I know?

131
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:10,360
Because I still wake up every morning...

132
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:15,402
...and the first thing I want to do
is see your face.

133
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,036
Oh, I'm sorry.

134
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:25,070
I see people buying bigger apartments
and having babies.

135
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,148
I get so afraid sometimes
our life's never gonna start.

136
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,682
No, baby.

137
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:35,883
We're already in our life.

138
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:38,355
It's already started. This is it.

139
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,194
You have to stop waiting, baby.

140
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:46,299
And Hol, you can't keep eating
me head off, telling me to leave.

141
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:49,158
I'm not going anywhere.

142
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:56,971
I'm not your dad.

143
00:09:58,345 --> 00:09:59,972
Or don't you know that yet?

144
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:08,213
I should get my shoes.

145
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:12,084
They're all over the place.
They're gonna think I don't love them.

146
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,423
Whoo!

147
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:05,331
Shake it, baby.

148
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:06,873
Do the stomach shake.

149
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:10,339
Whoo!

150
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:17,278
Oh! Ow! Aah! Ooh!

151
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,146
My eye! I'm blind.

152
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:22,950
Oh, I just wanna lick
your little Glaswegian chocolate.

153
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:27,459
Okay, okay. I can't believe
I'm in love with a leprechaun.

154
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:32,967
- Oh, wait. The light. You were up last.
- The light?

155
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:34,295
- No.
- You were up last.

156
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:37,960
But I'm not up now, am I?
Baby, look, I'm injured. My eye.

157
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:40,198
God. A pain in me hole.

158
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:43,707
That's a good girl.
That's a good girl.

159
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:47,211
Come on, get back to bed
or I'm gonna start without you.

160
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:51,474
Aah! Shit.

161
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:55,417
- You okay?
- Shit, no! My toe! Oh! Ow!

162
00:11:55,588 --> 00:11:59,718
I tell you what. Someone should get a
light, that side of the bed. It's ridiculous.

163
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:01,326
Ridiculous.

164
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:05,328
- I'll get my next husband to do it.
- Oh, come here.

165
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:10,134
Next husband. Oh-ho-ho. Next husband.
Come here, you.

166
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:16,797
I'm sorry I lose my mind sometimes.

167
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:21,435
- Did it hurt you? Let me look.
- Will you shut up and kiss me, okay?

168
00:12:24,716 --> 00:12:26,774
You crazy bitch. Pain in me hole.

169
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:55,224
Oh, Daniel, we forgot those Thanksgiving
decorations. Will you take them down?

170
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,426
Sure, Mrs. Reilly.
Where do you want them?

171
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:01,198
Patricia. In the skinny closet.
Have you got the key?

172
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,103
No, I don't.

173
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,506
I'll make you a set next week.

174
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,305
And ask Gerry's drivers
to close the curtains, will you?

175
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,845
Sure.

176
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:14,374
Go ahead.
Thanks.

177
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:20,246
- John.
- What?

178
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,552
- Oh, Denise.
- Hi.

179
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:25,160
- Oh, it's good to see you.
- Do I have to help?

180
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:27,024
- No, you do not have to help.
- Good.

181
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:28,687
- Sharon, you look great.
- Hi.

182
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:31,027
- Hi. This is good.
- So do you.

183
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:32,725
- Am I late?
- No. This is gorgeous.

184
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:34,803
Wait till you see Gerry.
You're gonna die.

185
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:36,837
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

186
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:07,227
Well, as Gerry would say,
let's get this party started.

187
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:12,273
Gerry Kennedy did not want a lot of words.
He preferred music.

188
00:15:12,841 --> 00:15:15,139
He was a unique young man...

189
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:20,446
...as you can see by the urn he had
designed by the love of his life...

190
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:22,912
...his wife, Holly.

191
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:27,817
His life may be over for now,
but we can still hear it.

192
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:32,419
He lives in us forever in our hearts...

193
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:34,354
...like his favorite song.

194
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,972
<i>Got on a lucky one</i>

195
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:52,441
<i>Came in eighteen to one</i>

196
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:55,774
<i>I've got a feeling</i>

197
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,078
<i>This year's for me and you</i>

198
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,850
<i>So happy Christmas</i>

199
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:09,481
<i>I love you, baby</i>

200
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:13,625
<i>I can see a better time</i>

201
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:18,601
<i>When all our dreams come true</i>

202
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:33,543
<i>- You're a bum, you're a punk
- You're an old slut on junk</i>

203
00:16:33,717 --> 00:16:36,515
<i>Lying there almost dead
On a drip in that bed</i>

204
00:16:36,686 --> 00:16:39,587
<i>You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap, lousy faggot</i>

205
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:42,349
<i>Happy Christmas, your arse
I pray God it's our last</i>

206
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:48,353
<i>The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing "Galway Bay"</i>

207
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:53,161
<i>And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas Day</i>

208
00:16:57,806 --> 00:16:58,795
Aww.

209
00:16:59,474 --> 00:17:00,907
Mama, how you doing?

210
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:04,871
- Ciara.
- Oh, sis, good to see you.

211
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:07,579
- Oh, good to hold you.
- Oh.

212
00:17:11,953 --> 00:17:13,887
Hello, Gerry.

213
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:28,164
- Hi, I'm Denise.
- Matt.

214
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:30,303
- I love your tie.
- Oh, thanks.

215
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:32,461
- Are you single, Matt?
- Yes.

216
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:34,773
- Are you gay?
- Yes.

217
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,698
Okay.

218
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:40,237
Did Holly call his parents?
Why aren't they here?

219
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:42,207
I did, I spoke to the mother.

220
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:45,782
His father's just had another operation.
He's not supposed to travel.

221
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:48,419
So why didn't she come alone?

222
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:52,489
I mean, it's Ireland, it's not Japan.
It was their only son.

223
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:54,249
Don't ask me.

224
00:17:57,662 --> 00:17:59,562
- Hi.
- Hi.

225
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:01,995
- I like your chain.
- Thanks.

226
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,635
- Denise.
- George.

227
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:07,600
- Are you single?
- Yes.

228
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:09,830
- Are you gay?
- No.

229
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:12,441
- Are you working?
- No.

230
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,714
You make a ravishing widow, sis.

231
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:24,148
Thanks.

232
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:29,282
I'm so glad you're here, but it's so far.
I would've understood.

233
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:33,520
No, I'm done with Australia.
Besides, Gerry wrote me I had to.

234
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:35,286
He wrote you?

235
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:38,366
Yeah, a couple of months ago.
Probably because of Mom.

236
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,002
He knew I'd have melodrama
for her to play with...

237
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:43,364
...while you pull yourself together.

238
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:45,963
Can I get you anything?

239
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,638
Mm.

240
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:53,542
- I'm sorry about your loss.
- Thanks.

241
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:55,146
How did he die?

242
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,484
- A brain tumor.
- Nice!

243
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:05,653
So that's a great looking urn.

244
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:08,292
I wish I were that creative.

245
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:12,289
I buried my dog in a stereo box.

246
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:17,099
It's not the same.

247
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:26,913
- I love your suit.
- Thanks.

248
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,809
- Are you single?
- Yes.

249
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:30,915
- Are you gay?
- No.

250
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,983
- Are you working?
- Yes.

251
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:35,177
- Denise.
- Sam.

252
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:45,227
Oh.

253
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,600
When Gerry and I went to a bank
to apply for a business loan...

254
00:19:58,776 --> 00:20:01,506
...I was a little nervous. Gerry told me:

255
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,408
"Relax, these people are never
gonna give us the money...

256
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:06,344
...so we might as well have some fun. "

257
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,108
No, don't clean.

258
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:12,847
No, I have to do something.
I can't talk anymore.

259
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:17,560
- Wanna stay with us while your sister's here?
- No.

260
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:20,086
I think...

261
00:20:20,797 --> 00:20:24,823
You know, I think I should be home.

262
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:27,128
I think I need to be...

263
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:30,402
...home.
- Well...

264
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:33,064
...this is your home too, you know.

265
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:37,538
But that's good. Get back on your feet.

266
00:20:37,713 --> 00:20:39,407
That's a good thing.

267
00:22:00,624 --> 00:22:02,455
<i>Hey, it's Gerry at Enniskerry Limo.</i>

268
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,525
<i>Leave a message.</i>

269
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:13,802
<i>Hey, it's Gerry at Enniskerry Limo.
Leave a message.</i>

270
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:26,472
<i>Hey, it's Gerry at Enniskerry Limo.
Leave a message.</i>

271
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,719
<i>Hey, it's Gerry at Enniskerry Limo.
Leave a message.</i>

272
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:46,128
<i>Holly? It's Mom. Are you all right?</i>

273
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,927
<i>Are you showering? Don't make me worry.</i>

274
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:49,933
<i>I'm worried you're not calling me back.</i>

275
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:53,800
<i>I know it's hard, honey, but don't lock
yourself in. It's been over a week.</i>

276
00:22:53,974 --> 00:22:55,601
<i>- I'm here, okay?
Hey, it's Denise.</i>

277
00:22:55,776 --> 00:22:58,939
<i>Listen, I buzzed your apartment.
Nobody's heard from you.</i>

278
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:02,548
<i>Where are you? All right, call somebody.
I love you.</i>

279
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,911
<i>I'll make him pay for it. I will.</i>

280
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:06,712
<i>Whatever you might do,
I can do more...</i>

281
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:09,014
<i>...because I know how to fight
better than you.</i>

282
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,719
Why can't I be Bette Davis?

283
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,256
<i>All right? I mean, the job...</i>

284
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,453
<i>...makes you cranky
at home every bloody day anyway.</i>

285
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,223
<i>You wanna have a baby? Let's do it.</i>

286
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,334
<i>See? I hate when you do that.
Hah. Do what?</i>

287
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,935
<i>"Let's have a baby. " La-la-la!</i>

288
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:27,333
<i>In a five-floor walkup
we can barely move in.</i>

289
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:30,736
<i>You can't act like everything's just
gonna work out by itself, Gerry.</i>

290
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,969
<i>Why do I have to be the responsible
grownup who worries?</i>

291
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:35,874
<i>If you're killed, I'll be free.</i>

292
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,844
<i>If I'm killed, it really doesn't matter.</i>

293
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,246
<i>If we both die, good riddance!</i>

294
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,012
<i>Go ahead, crash it. Crash it!</i>

295
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:52,352
Gerry, get the light.

296
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:54,588
It's your turn.

297
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,528
Mmm.

298
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:23,053
<i>I just want to see you</i>

299
00:24:23,225 --> 00:24:25,557
<i>When you're all alone</i>

300
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:31,257
<i>I just want to catch you if I can</i>

301
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:40,233
<i>I just want to be there When
the morning light explodes</i>

302
00:24:40,574 --> 00:24:45,534
<i>On your face it radiates
I can't escape</i>

303
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:48,580
<i>I love you till the end</i>

304
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,079
- Do all Irishmen sing?
- Heh.

305
00:24:52,585 --> 00:24:55,349
<i>I'll love you till the end</i>

306
00:24:55,555 --> 00:24:58,581
Ah. Only the really well-hung ones.

307
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:02,285
I can't fall asleep alone.

308
00:25:02,462 --> 00:25:04,396
I'm right here, baby.

309
00:25:04,564 --> 00:25:07,158
I had a terrible dream.

310
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:10,026
Don't tell me.

311
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:16,406
Gerry, I don't wanna go back to work.

312
00:25:16,575 --> 00:25:20,341
- What should I do?
- Quit.

313
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:22,608
Stay here with me.

314
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:32,253
I don't have a plan, Gerry.

315
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:36,154
<i>That's okay, luv,
your plans never work out anyway.</i>

316
00:25:36,894 --> 00:25:38,293
Hmm.

317
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:40,861
That's true.

318
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:59,209
<i>And all because of the man</i>

319
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:05,513
<i>That got away</i>

320
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:11,854
<i>No more his eager call</i>

321
00:26:12,027 --> 00:26:18,431
<i>The writing's on the wall</i>

322
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:24,831
<i>The dreams you dreamed Have all</i>

323
00:26:25,006 --> 00:26:30,034
<i>Gone astray</i>

324
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:38,307
<i>The man that won you Has
run off and undone you</i>

325
00:26:38,485 --> 00:26:44,651
<i>That great beginning Has seen a final inning</i>

326
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:48,456
<i>Don't know what happened</i>

327
00:26:48,628 --> 00:26:55,465
<i>It's all a crazy game</i>

328
00:26:56,068 --> 00:27:02,064
<i>No more that all-time thrill</i>

329
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:05,005
<i>For you've been</i>

330
00:27:05,177 --> 00:27:08,543
<i>Through the mill</i>

331
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:12,843
<i>And never a new love</i>

332
00:27:13,018 --> 00:27:19,753
<i>Will be the same</i>

333
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:24,525
<i>Good riddance, goodbye...</i>

334
00:27:33,637 --> 00:27:36,333
Whoo!

335
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:40,036
Happy birthday!

336
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:43,440
You're 30!

337
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:45,342
Hey, Holly...

338
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:47,710
...these were falling out of your mailbox.

339
00:27:48,951 --> 00:27:50,145
What is that smell?

340
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,220
I wasn't expecting company.
Mom, don't clean.

341
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:57,553
- I'm not. I'll just organize the garbage.
- We did try to call first.

342
00:27:57,727 --> 00:28:00,194
- Are you drunk?
- No.

343
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,762
- Do you wanna be?
- Ciara.

344
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,455
What happened to your head?

345
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,989
Pimple.

346
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:08,728
- You're not showering?
- You always squeeze it too hard.

347
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:10,804
- What is that smell?
- It's me, all right?

348
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:13,532
<i>Hey, hey, hey. Don't be like that.</i>

349
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,809
- Like what?
- Like the only lonely widow in Gotham City.

350
00:28:17,978 --> 00:28:21,004
I'm just... exhausted.

351
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:23,810
Yeah, well, what are you doing,
two shows a night?

352
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:29,217
You know, if you want us to leave,
that's fine...

353
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,688
...but you do know that at some point,
this all has to stop.

354
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:36,424
All right.

355
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:40,963
Just give me a second, okay?
I'll get cleaned up.

356
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:45,432
- Okay, troops, let's sweep the area.
- Yes.

357
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:49,133
I haven't called the office. Are they mad?

358
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:53,005
Nah. There's no rush.

359
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:58,013
Even Larry said, "Take all the time you
need. The job is there when you're ready. "

360
00:28:58,183 --> 00:28:59,377
That was nice of him.

361
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:02,042
- He's an asshole.
- He's still an asshole.

362
00:29:02,354 --> 00:29:06,517
Do you think it'll be all right
if I stop my life right here?

363
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:11,128
Become the Miss Havisham
of the Lower East Side.

364
00:29:11,295 --> 00:29:13,456
Never leave my apartment till I'm old.

365
00:29:13,631 --> 00:29:15,758
- Sit in my wedding dress.
- Which you never had.

366
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:18,766
- With an old piece of wedding cake.
- Which you never had.

367
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,062
You gotta be rich to be insane, Hol.

368
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:24,566
Losing your mind
is not a luxury for the middle class.

369
00:29:24,741 --> 00:29:26,868
I'll get it.
- That's so not fair.

370
00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:29,470
No, it's not.

371
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:32,474
Holly? Something's been delivered for you.

372
00:29:43,392 --> 00:29:44,552
What is this?

373
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:50,759
- I don't understand. Did you do this?
- No.

374
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,658
Wait a minute.

375
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:07,804
- John, tell me the truth. Did you do this?
- No. I did nothing, I swear.

376
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:25,464
<i>Hey, baby. Surprise.</i>

377
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:28,328
<i>I know this probably feels
a little bit morbid...</i>

378
00:30:28,502 --> 00:30:31,163
<i>...but I just hate the idea
that I'm not gonna be there...</i>

379
00:30:31,337 --> 00:30:34,966
<i>...to see you freak out over turning 30.
I mean, it kills me not to be there.</i>

380
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:37,234
<i>Heh-heh. That's funny.</i>

381
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,311
<i>- No, it's not.
- Okay. No, it's not.</i>

382
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,376
<i>You're gonna be so impressed.
I have a plan, baby. Can you believe it?</i>

383
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:49,611
<i>I've written you letters. Letters that
will be coming to you all sorts of ways.</i>

384
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:53,485
<i>I waited till your birthday. I figured
you weren't stepping out of the house...</i>

385
00:30:53,658 --> 00:30:56,627
<i>...for a while. Letter number one
will be arriving tomorrow.</i>

386
00:30:57,095 --> 00:30:59,962
<i>Now, you must do what I say, okay?</i>

387
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:01,962
<i>Okay?</i>

388
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:04,599
<i>Don't try to figure out
how the letters are coming.</i>

389
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:09,205
<i>It's too brilliant and it'll ruin my plan.
Just go along with me on this.</i>

390
00:31:09,373 --> 00:31:13,833
<i>Because the thing is,
I just can't say goodbye yet.</i>

391
00:31:14,878 --> 00:31:16,846
<i>So for starters...</i>

392
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:20,313
<i>...I want you to get dolled up,
and just go out and celebrate tonight.</i>

393
00:31:20,484 --> 00:31:22,041
<i>Go out with your girlies.</i>

394
00:31:22,218 --> 00:31:27,155
<i>I hereby free you from a party with
your family, especially your mom.</i>

395
00:31:27,423 --> 00:31:30,051
<i>Oh, man, your mom's there, isn't she?</i>

396
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:32,353
<i>Mm. Shit.</i>

397
00:31:32,562 --> 00:31:34,325
<i>Sorry, Patricia.</i>

398
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:36,021
<i>It isn't that I don't love you...</i>

399
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:39,759
<i>...but she needs to get a little crazy.
So have a slice of the bloody cake...</i>

400
00:31:39,935 --> 00:31:42,233
<i>...put on your dress
and get out of the apartment.</i>

401
00:31:42,404 --> 00:31:44,167
<i>- Denise, make a plan.
- I'm on it!</i>

402
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:47,331
<i>- I'll help.
- Just leave me with John, okay?</i>

403
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:51,138
<i>And know that wherever I am,
I'm missing you.</i>

404
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:53,878
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

405
00:31:54,316 --> 00:31:55,613
<i>I love you.</i>

406
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:06,751
- Come on.
- Look, it's a private gay club.

407
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:10,385
Yes, but we are on the list.
My colorist called and he's gay.

408
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:12,895
Gay colorist in New York?
Like sand on the beach.

409
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:15,534
Listen, Crystal. Don't mess with her.

410
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:17,693
- He's a very good colorist.
- Uh-huh.

411
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:21,602
And she's the princess of Finland.

412
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:26,104
And she's here on matters
of critical political importance.

413
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:29,805
And she's here to extend
the hand of friendship from Finland...

414
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,540
...to homosexuals...
That's us!

415
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:33,617
...throughout the tri-city area.

416
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:42,951
What?

417
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,424
Thanks.

418
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,770
Great. You're fired.

419
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,913
Okay. "Snaps" is the name of the game.
The name of the game is "Snaps. "

420
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,607
Make sure you pay attention.

421
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:09,941
Ready?

422
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,885
Have you got it?

423
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:16,047
Mariah Carey?

424
00:33:18,528 --> 00:33:19,517
I don't get it.

425
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:21,558
- Paul.
- God, he's been dead, like what?

426
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:23,221
- Fifteen years.
- Unbelievable.

427
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:25,833
- Can you believe that?
- You remember Steve?

428
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:28,936
Steve was so sweet.
He was a good guy.

429
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:31,972
- Honey, don't be so Miss Doom and Gloom.
- You'll be fine.

430
00:33:32,141 --> 00:33:33,972
Yeah, don't worry about it.

431
00:33:34,477 --> 00:33:36,035
"Snaps" is the name of the game.

432
00:33:36,212 --> 00:33:38,270
The name of the game is "Snaps. "

433
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:39,538
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

434
00:33:41,116 --> 00:33:44,108
Ready? Keep looking.

435
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:45,813
Derek Jeter!

436
00:33:45,987 --> 00:33:48,387
- Come on. No.
- How?

437
00:33:48,556 --> 00:33:49,716
This is a stupid game.

438
00:33:56,196 --> 00:33:57,857
Sorry.

439
00:33:58,265 --> 00:33:59,254
What are you doing?

440
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:01,901
Trying to figure out
why God killed my husband.

441
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:04,663
Well, if you need any help with that,
let me know.

442
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:12,737
- Ow!
- Sorry. Heh.

443
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,271
- Daniel?
- Yeah.

444
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:19,617
So why do you think?

445
00:34:19,786 --> 00:34:21,549
Your husband died?

446
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:23,746
Maybe you're being punished
for something.

447
00:34:23,923 --> 00:34:26,118
- What?
- Being too happy? Too beautiful?

448
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:28,384
I don't know.
God can be a pretty jealous guy.

449
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,723
I don't believe that. I've never been
too happy. I'm not too beautiful.

450
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:33,524
I think you're hot.

451
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:39,628
Sorry, I have a syndrome.

452
00:34:39,805 --> 00:34:43,070
I don't really have a filter.
I don't pick up on social cues.

453
00:34:43,241 --> 00:34:44,674
You mean you're rude?

454
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:47,868
Yeah, but now it's a disease
I can take medication for.

455
00:34:48,312 --> 00:34:50,177
They have pills for rudeness?

456
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:53,373
I know. And they can't figure out
the Middle East. Go figure.

457
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:59,452
Hey, you're Irish.
Maybe it's an Irish curse or something.

458
00:34:59,623 --> 00:35:01,818
Well, Gerry and I did love the Yankees...

459
00:35:01,992 --> 00:35:04,255
...which was pretty much
against our religion.

460
00:35:04,427 --> 00:35:05,587
Well, there you go.

461
00:35:05,762 --> 00:35:10,062
That explains a lot, actually. I love the
Yankees too, and I lost my fiancיe last year.

462
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,589
Really?

463
00:35:11,768 --> 00:35:15,169
Yeah, she slept with my best friend.
She left me.

464
00:35:15,338 --> 00:35:16,396
Oh...

465
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,573
My best friend was a woman.

466
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:19,729
Oh.

467
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:23,241
Her last words to me were, "I'd still
be with you if you weren't a man. "

468
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,743
And I'm like:

469
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:29,247
"Well, castrating me is definitely the first
step toward achieving that particular goal. "

470
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:31,349
It's still my fault. I introduced them.

471
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,978
I always had this fantasy about making
love to two women at the same time.

472
00:35:35,157 --> 00:35:38,614
Except in my fantasy, I was still
in the bed for the second and third time.

473
00:35:38,793 --> 00:35:40,852
- Sorry.
- Then this'll make you feel great.

474
00:35:41,028 --> 00:35:44,725
The best friend that my ex-fiancיe slept
with was my ex-ex-fiancיe...

475
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:48,733
...and she was my business partner, and
we started the business with my money.

476
00:35:48,903 --> 00:35:53,566
So I ended up losing the business,
my partner and my fiancיe.

477
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:56,168
How'd you get over that?

478
00:35:57,277 --> 00:36:01,304
I went through, like,
a major hooker phase all year.

479
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:02,778
But that didn't help.

480
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:05,918
No, it helped a lot.
I just started to run out of money.

481
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:08,384
It's actually a lot cheaper to date.

482
00:36:09,623 --> 00:36:13,524
Do you think that you're gonna ever find
another woman to love?

483
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,825
No.

484
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:20,125
No, I think I repel
the women that I want the most.

485
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,494
That's not true.

486
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:24,831
No?

487
00:36:30,575 --> 00:36:32,133
No?

488
00:37:02,038 --> 00:37:03,665
Thank you, Daniel.

489
00:37:11,714 --> 00:37:14,046
You can start closing up downstairs.

490
00:37:17,386 --> 00:37:18,852
Right.

491
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:53,613
What do you want?

492
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:56,647
<i>- Oh, good. A friendly voice.
Oh.</i>

493
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:58,422
What happened last night?

494
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:01,025
Lemon drops and tequila, my friend.

495
00:38:01,194 --> 00:38:04,755
<i>The moment where a 30-year-old body
does not recover quite as fast...</i>

496
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:06,523
...as a 29-year-old body.

497
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:08,394
Stop screaming at me.

498
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:11,258
<i>- Are you working?
- Hell, no.</i>

499
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:14,872
But I told him we're gonna start next
week. We'll go out starting Monday.

500
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:19,271
<i>- Is that okay?
- No, I was planning on...</i>

501
00:38:19,444 --> 00:38:21,810
...staying in bed and dying today.

502
00:38:23,148 --> 00:38:24,581
Well, you can't.

503
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,411
<i>You gotta go check the mailbox,
remember?</i>

504
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:29,917
<i>Call me immediately.</i>

505
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:54,938
<i>Save yourself bruises
and buy yourself a bedside lamp.</i>

506
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:58,877
<i>And remember, a disco diva
must look her best.</i>

507
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:02,882
<i>Go buy yourself a knock-out outfit. You'll
need it for when my next letter comes.</i>

508
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:04,280
Need it for what?

509
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:07,786
<i>And I know you hate your job,
but I'll help.</i>

510
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:11,255
<i>Look for a sign. You'll know what to do.</i>

511
00:39:14,863 --> 00:39:17,660
<i>P.S. I love you.</i>

512
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:15,212
I still know you're around.

513
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,288
You're still here, aren't you?

514
00:40:21,326 --> 00:40:22,691
So who lived here before?

515
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:26,591
A family. They're having another baby.
So do you have any children?

516
00:40:26,764 --> 00:40:29,665
Three. Girls. Teenagers.

517
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,027
That's nice.

518
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:32,529
Uh-huh.

519
00:40:32,736 --> 00:40:35,227
Ted, Sharon says there's
another offer on the table...

520
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:37,236
...and we have to move on this.

521
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:40,274
I think if you offer another
hundred grand, they'll back down.

522
00:40:40,444 --> 00:40:42,308
Well, maybe we should talk about it.

523
00:40:42,478 --> 00:40:44,810
We don't have time, Ted.
We have to tell her today.

524
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:46,141
We didn't wanna go over...

525
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:48,977
I know, but we love this apartment,
and it is what it is.

526
00:40:49,185 --> 00:40:51,745
There's nothing else.
This is what an apartment costs.

527
00:40:51,921 --> 00:40:54,321
- We're already beyond our cap.
- We'll make it work...

528
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,357
- Think about another area.
- I am not living in Brooklyn.

529
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:59,084
- Will you listen to him?
What?

530
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:00,922
He's obviously worried about this.

531
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:02,893
- Look at him. He's pale.
- Hol.

532
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:05,055
Who are you to tell me
how to talk to my husband?

533
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:07,667
You shouldn't push this on him
if he doesn't want to.

534
00:41:07,836 --> 00:41:09,929
I'll push what I want on him.
He's my husband.

535
00:41:10,105 --> 00:41:11,436
I want this apartment.

536
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:14,632
- Say no, Ted.
- It is amazing that you are still talking.

537
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,073
- Don't listen to her.
- Ted, she's being a tyrant.

538
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:20,645
She's got your balls on one of those
things that cling back and forth.

539
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:22,282
- You know?
- Yeah.

540
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:23,711
- You bitch.
- Brat.

541
00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:24,908
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

542
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:28,145
No, you shut up!
I will end you, and when I do...

543
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:31,018
- You know what? I'll tell you...
- No. No. No. Okay, tell me.

544
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:34,922
He's my husband, I'll talk to him the
way I want to. I'm not living in Brooklyn!

545
00:41:35,228 --> 00:41:37,924
Do you know who I am?
What's wrong with Brooklyn, lady?

546
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,964
Are you Holly Kennedy?

547
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:24,663
- If I am, will you sing?
- Yes.

548
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:26,968
- No, I'm not.
- Please don't make this an issue.

549
00:42:27,143 --> 00:42:30,670
- I gotta sing and deliver a letter.
- A letter? What's the song?

550
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:32,940
- "Yah Mo Be There. "
- Just give me the letter.

551
00:42:33,116 --> 00:42:35,448
- I could get reported.
- By the leprechaun union?

552
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,713
You know, I was in an off-Broadway play
with Al goddamn Pacino.

553
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,652
I don't need this shit.
You want the balloons?

554
00:42:41,824 --> 00:42:43,553
- No.
- Fine.

555
00:42:54,904 --> 00:42:55,893
You bastard.

556
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:57,695
There's no way I'm doing this.

557
00:42:57,872 --> 00:42:59,669
<i>Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.</i>

558
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:02,605
<i>- Oh, yes, you are.
- Oh, no, I'm not.</i>

559
00:43:02,777 --> 00:43:04,506
<i>Remember the last time?</i>

560
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:08,581
<i>All you wanna do is ride around, Sally</i>

561
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,184
<i>Ride, Sally, ride</i>

562
00:43:12,754 --> 00:43:16,519
<i>All you wanna do is ride around, Sally</i>

563
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,618
<i>Ride, Sally, ride</i>

564
00:43:19,793 --> 00:43:20,851
Yeah!

565
00:43:21,028 --> 00:43:25,294
<i>One of these early mornings</i>

566
00:43:25,465 --> 00:43:26,489
<i>You gonna be</i>

567
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:32,860
<i>Wiping those weeping eyes</i>

568
00:43:33,072 --> 00:43:35,666
<i>Those weeping eyes, yeah</i>

569
00:43:36,008 --> 00:43:38,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:43,472
Thank you very much.

571
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,647
Oh, my God.

572
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:54,882
Whoo!
- One more!

573
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,995
Okay. I guess it's time to give
somebody else a chance here now.

574
00:43:58,163 --> 00:43:59,425
Who wants a shot?

575
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:01,258
Anybody else here willing to give it a go?

576
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,897
Yourself? No? Young lady.

577
00:44:05,069 --> 00:44:07,367
Come on. Don't be shy.

578
00:44:07,538 --> 00:44:10,098
- What about Holly?
- Stop it.

579
00:44:10,274 --> 00:44:12,003
Holly. I don't know about that, John.

580
00:44:12,176 --> 00:44:14,736
Holly's my wife, by the way.
My beautiful wife.

581
00:44:14,912 --> 00:44:18,211
And I do... I love Holly, I do.

582
00:44:19,683 --> 00:44:21,446
But she would never have the guts...

583
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,845
Oh!

584
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:25,579
...to do something like this.

585
00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:28,319
Oh, no.

586
00:44:29,692 --> 00:44:32,320
In fact, she ate me head off
about coming out tonight.

587
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:34,827
You know, she had
a long day at the office.

588
00:44:36,165 --> 00:44:37,462
Ah. She'll never do it.

589
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:39,489
Yep.

590
00:44:42,504 --> 00:44:44,768
Oh, you think so?

591
00:44:45,273 --> 00:44:49,869
You think she'd get up here?
Okay, I'll bet you 100 dollars...

592
00:44:50,212 --> 00:44:52,908
...she doesn't get up on this stage.
Oooh.

593
00:45:00,955 --> 00:45:02,252
Make it two.

594
00:45:19,439 --> 00:45:21,930
- What is she doing? What is she doing?
- Ha-ha-ha.

595
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:28,342
That's my wife, the surpriser.

596
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,809
<i>How can I put this in a way</i>

597
00:45:35,988 --> 00:45:38,218
<i>So as not to offend or unnerve</i>

598
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,379
Holly!

599
00:45:39,558 --> 00:45:43,153
<i>There's a rumor going all around
That you ain't been getting served</i>

600
00:45:43,328 --> 00:45:44,317
All right.

601
00:45:44,496 --> 00:45:47,828
<i>They say that you ain't you know what
In, baby, who knows how long</i>

602
00:45:48,733 --> 00:45:52,669
<i>It's hard for me to say what's right
When all I wanna do is wrong</i>

603
00:45:53,304 --> 00:45:57,741
<i>Get off Twenty-three
positions in a one-night stand</i>

604
00:45:57,909 --> 00:46:02,505
<i>Get off
I'll only call you after if you say I can</i>

605
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,979
<i>Get off, let a woman be a woman
And a man be a man</i>

606
00:46:07,484 --> 00:46:10,681
<i>Get off
If you want to, baby</i>

607
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:12,947
<i>Here I am
Here I...</i>

608
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,581
Oh!
- Oh, God!

609
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:28,666
Do you mind coffee?

610
00:46:30,773 --> 00:46:33,139
How do you feel? You look good.

611
00:46:38,613 --> 00:46:42,310
I'm sorry, baby, but I have to say
you were really good before...

612
00:46:42,484 --> 00:46:46,978
My nose is broken, Gerry.
My ankle is twisted. Happy?

613
00:46:47,322 --> 00:46:49,381
- Are you mad at me?
- I didn't wanna go out...

614
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:50,785
...and you made me.

615
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:53,587
I hate karaoke
and you forced me to go up there.

616
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:56,058
Come on, honey. It was nobody's fault.

617
00:46:57,664 --> 00:46:59,757
Oh, come here, baby. Give me a...

618
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,099
Give me a kiss.

619
00:47:12,545 --> 00:47:14,740
Well, how long are you gonna be mad for?

620
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:19,743
<i>I never let him off the hook.</i>

621
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:21,682
Anytime I was mad,
I made him feel bad.

622
00:47:21,854 --> 00:47:23,845
I was mad when we
left the house that night.

623
00:47:24,023 --> 00:47:27,015
I was mad at him because our apartment
was too small. So stupid.

624
00:47:27,193 --> 00:47:28,591
Baby, you were married.

625
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,854
Married people make each other
feel like shit on purpose sometimes.

626
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,691
It just feels good.

627
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:37,631
Gerry knew you were crazy about him.
He told me all the time.

628
00:47:37,802 --> 00:47:40,134
Well, I wish I would've told him that night.

629
00:47:40,372 --> 00:47:42,203
So tell him now.

630
00:47:44,075 --> 00:47:46,474
It's slightly dirty. Just slightly.

631
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:53,844
Ooh.

632
00:47:54,018 --> 00:47:55,781
He's delicious, isn't he?

633
00:47:57,354 --> 00:48:00,050
You could serve coffee on that ass.

634
00:48:00,558 --> 00:48:04,584
Do you have to be so vulgar about men,
like they're pieces of meat?

635
00:48:05,562 --> 00:48:09,191
I'm sorry, John. I forgot you're sensitive
about your flat ass.

636
00:48:09,365 --> 00:48:10,354
Hoh.

637
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:13,593
You know, Denise,
that's why you're not married.

638
00:48:15,572 --> 00:48:16,971
- Ahem.
- Women act like men...

639
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,801
...then they complain
men don't want them.

640
00:48:19,141 --> 00:48:21,234
Oh, is that why? Oh.

641
00:48:22,377 --> 00:48:25,369
Okay. Because I thought
it was something different.

642
00:48:25,547 --> 00:48:28,311
I thought it was because
I thought that I deserve the best.

643
00:48:28,483 --> 00:48:31,941
And he's out there.
He's just with all the wrong women.

644
00:48:32,354 --> 00:48:33,412
And let me be clear.

645
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:38,287
After centuries of men looking at my tits
instead of my eyes...

646
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:41,189
...and pinching my ass
instead of shaking my hand...

647
00:48:41,362 --> 00:48:45,560
...I now have the divine right
to stare at a man's backside...

648
00:48:45,733 --> 00:48:49,294
...with vulgar, cheap appreciation
if I want to.

649
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,097
- Well said.
- I thought so.

650
00:48:51,305 --> 00:48:53,067
New York City, how we doing? Huh?

651
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,901
- Hey, guys, we're here!
Yay!

652
00:48:55,075 --> 00:48:57,270
Give a warm welcome
to our next singer.

653
00:48:57,444 --> 00:49:01,141
Rumor has it this is her return
engagement. Put your hands together...

654
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:02,645
...for Holly.

655
00:49:07,287 --> 00:49:10,847
This is for you, Gerry, you son of a bitch.

656
00:49:29,607 --> 00:49:32,007
<i>I just wanna tell you</i>

657
00:49:32,176 --> 00:49:35,668
<i>Nothing you don't want to hear</i>

658
00:49:36,614 --> 00:49:41,278
<i>All I want is for you to say</i>

659
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:49,550
<i>Oh, why don't you just take me
Where I've never been before?</i>

660
00:49:50,427 --> 00:49:54,830
<i>I know you want to hear me
Catch my breath</i>

661
00:49:55,432 --> 00:49:58,128
<i>I love you till the end</i>

662
00:50:02,772 --> 00:50:06,003
<i>I love you till the end</i>

663
00:50:09,879 --> 00:50:12,848
<i>I love you till the end</i>

664
00:50:27,529 --> 00:50:28,996
Okay, let me get this straight.

665
00:50:29,164 --> 00:50:32,031
You're straight, you're single,
and you own your own business?

666
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,224
It's my own club.

667
00:50:33,401 --> 00:50:34,890
I'm doing a big renovation right now.

668
00:50:35,069 --> 00:50:36,434
- It'll open in the spring.
- Mm-hm.

669
00:50:36,603 --> 00:50:40,505
I could show it to you if you want.
It's over on Tenth Avenue. Wanna go?

670
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:42,733
Great.

671
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:46,040
Yeah. Let me just do one thing first.

672
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:49,714
Mm.

673
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:00,114
What's my name?

674
00:51:00,493 --> 00:51:03,462
- Tom.
- Where have you been?

675
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:06,025
With all the wrong women.

676
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,198
Hmm.

677
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,363
- Hey.
- Hi.

678
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:17,406
Hey, Gerry. You lost weight.

679
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:21,478
Thanks for inviting me.

680
00:51:23,215 --> 00:51:24,648
You're a terrible singer.

681
00:51:25,317 --> 00:51:27,113
Yes, I am.

682
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:31,243
- I'd be really embarrassed if I were you.
- Did you take your medication today?

683
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,080
No, I thought I'd come here instead.

684
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:40,056
Say, I'm feeling kind of hungry. You feel
like getting a bite or something to drink?

685
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:43,563
No, I'm... I don't think so.

686
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,462
- It's all right.
- Thanks.

687
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,574
I don't mean to throw this at you,
but what do women want?

688
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:56,007
I can't figure it out.
They want us to ask.

689
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:59,511
They don't want us to ask. They want us
to make a move, not make a move.

690
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:01,740
They want us to be on bottom, be on top.

691
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:04,249
Use hair products, don't use hair products.

692
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,183
What do you people want?

693
00:52:06,355 --> 00:52:09,381
I'll tell you, but you have to promise
not to say I told you.

694
00:52:09,558 --> 00:52:12,322
- L... I swear.
- Because it's a sacred secret.

695
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:14,160
Sacred secret.

696
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:16,455
- You ready? You sure?
- Yeah. I think so.

697
00:52:16,631 --> 00:52:17,655
Come here.

698
00:52:19,267 --> 00:52:20,495
We have absolutely...

699
00:52:20,668 --> 00:52:21,657
...no idea what we want.

700
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:26,773
- I knew it! I knew that! Son of a bitch!
- Ooh!

701
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:31,502
Yeah.

702
00:52:35,282 --> 00:52:38,513
Look, if you ever just wanna get out...

703
00:52:38,852 --> 00:52:40,683
...just do anything, just...

704
00:52:42,789 --> 00:52:45,314
I'll wait for your call.

705
00:52:45,492 --> 00:52:48,461
And just so you know,
I'm not looking for a thing right now.

706
00:52:48,628 --> 00:52:53,291
- I'm just flirting in good faith.
- I appreciate that.

707
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:54,925
Maybe we can defy God...

708
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,829
...and go see a Yankees game.
- Yeah.

709
00:52:58,571 --> 00:53:02,564
We'll be really weird friends,
joined by self-pity, bitterness and vomit.

710
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,676
- I'd like that.
- Me too.

711
00:53:26,497 --> 00:53:31,332
<i>My leather jacket is for you.
I always loved the way that looked on you.</i>

712
00:53:31,502 --> 00:53:34,164
<i>But the rest of my stuff,
you don't need it.</i>

713
00:53:34,705 --> 00:53:39,199
<i>Make some space in that bloody
apartment for yourself. Go on.</i>

714
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,433
<i>It's time, baby.</i>

715
00:53:42,912 --> 00:53:46,643
<i>P.S. I love you.</i>

716
00:54:15,643 --> 00:54:18,111
I think you're a little bit perverted.

717
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:21,737
I mean, you bring me
to an Irish famine memorial...

718
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:25,113
...and we're eating corned beef
sandwiches. That's pretty sick.

719
00:54:25,286 --> 00:54:28,278
Gerry thought it was the best way
to honor the dead.

720
00:54:28,455 --> 00:54:31,424
You know, show them
how well we're doing.

721
00:54:32,592 --> 00:54:34,184
I'm sorry I always bring him up.

722
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,988
Yeah, I'm starting to get
a little bit sick of it.

723
00:54:42,835 --> 00:54:45,463
Now that's a real honest-to-goodness
couple right there.

724
00:54:45,638 --> 00:54:48,129
They've probably been together
since the Flood.

725
00:54:49,207 --> 00:54:50,834
We're so arrogant, aren't we?

726
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:55,346
We're so afraid of age,
we do everything we can to prevent it.

727
00:54:55,514 --> 00:54:59,075
We don't realize what a privilege it is
to grow old with someone...

728
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:03,688
...someone who doesn't drive you
to commit murder.

729
00:55:04,056 --> 00:55:07,991
Or doesn't humiliate you beyond repair.

730
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,593
It's sweet.

731
00:55:15,299 --> 00:55:16,766
It's good, huh?

732
00:55:21,072 --> 00:55:23,198
Can I ask you a favor?
Sure.

733
00:55:23,373 --> 00:55:25,773
I started bagging up Gerry's stuff.
Couldn't finish.

734
00:55:25,942 --> 00:55:29,844
I think I need someone who
didn't know him to get rid of it all.

735
00:55:30,013 --> 00:55:31,810
Be happy to help you get rid of Gerry.

736
00:55:31,982 --> 00:55:34,041
- Do you have to say it like that?
- Like what?

737
00:55:34,217 --> 00:55:36,913
- What is wrong with you? Take a pill.
- Nothing. What?

738
00:55:54,803 --> 00:55:56,031
What's wrong?

739
00:55:56,472 --> 00:55:58,302
Nothing, I...

740
00:55:58,473 --> 00:56:02,375
I've just never been alone with another
man in this apartment besides Gerry.

741
00:56:02,543 --> 00:56:05,637
Want me to stand out in the hall?
You can just throw me the boxes.

742
00:56:05,813 --> 00:56:06,802
No. Heh.

743
00:56:06,981 --> 00:56:08,448
That's okay.

744
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,115
I'm sorry.

745
00:56:10,652 --> 00:56:12,381
I'm gonna change.

746
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,616
Look through stuff.
If there's anything you want...

747
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,021
...just let me know.
- Okay.

748
00:56:38,678 --> 00:56:39,906
Mm.

749
00:56:40,913 --> 00:56:45,748
I can't remember the last time
somebody held me like this.

750
00:56:50,221 --> 00:56:52,746
Did you find a new husband yet?

751
00:56:52,924 --> 00:56:54,050
Shut up.

752
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,828
Where have you been?

753
00:56:57,996 --> 00:57:02,262
- I haven't felt you around lately.
- Oh, please.

754
00:57:02,434 --> 00:57:05,698
I've been so around.

755
00:57:07,304 --> 00:57:08,635
Mm.

756
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,434
I can feel you hugging me.

757
00:57:12,609 --> 00:57:15,373
That's because I am.

758
00:57:20,584 --> 00:57:23,609
You look great.

759
00:58:08,963 --> 00:58:10,521
This is the one.

760
00:58:15,802 --> 00:58:18,464
- Are you Barbara?
- Yes, may I help you?

761
00:58:19,272 --> 00:58:21,172
I hope so.

762
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,538
You're his wife.

763
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,913
He was here?

764
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:42,057
So I don't understand.
You're taking a vacation?

765
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,387
It's a trip.

766
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:47,960
Gerry planned the whole thing
for me and Sharon and Denise.

767
00:58:49,033 --> 00:58:50,967
You think it's the best time to vacation?

768
00:58:51,135 --> 00:58:53,729
Gerry made all the arrangements.
I have to go.

769
00:58:54,305 --> 00:58:57,797
Have you spoken to Daniel? Thought you
two were spending time together.

770
00:58:57,975 --> 00:58:59,533
We're just friends, Mom.

771
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:05,744
I've stood by and not said anything about all
this, but now I think it's time it stopped.

772
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:07,645
- What do you mean?
- It's not healthy.

773
00:59:08,451 --> 00:59:11,249
Gerry's not gonna be able
to keep this up forever, is he?

774
00:59:11,421 --> 00:59:14,083
His life ended, and so will his letters.

775
00:59:14,257 --> 00:59:16,555
You're gonna have to face
things on your own.

776
00:59:16,726 --> 00:59:18,887
It was a gift from Gerry.

777
00:59:20,129 --> 00:59:21,323
And how can you say that?

778
00:59:21,497 --> 00:59:24,364
My husband was 35 years old.
He wasn't supposed to die.

779
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:27,991
But he did. It was awful.

780
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,603
It's what happens.

781
00:59:29,939 --> 00:59:33,397
But his death is a part of your life now.
And you have to deal with it.

782
00:59:33,576 --> 00:59:36,511
Stop saying that
like I'm not dealing with it. I am.

783
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:39,772
How? By waiting for a letter
from a dead husband?

784
00:59:39,948 --> 00:59:43,714
Taking a vacation? When your father left,
I had two children to support.

785
00:59:43,885 --> 00:59:48,322
- Excuse me for not having any children.
- That's not how I meant it and you know it.

786
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:51,322
Your father leaving
was just as devastating.

787
00:59:51,492 --> 00:59:53,790
But I did what I needed to do
and got on with it.

788
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:55,553
- It's not the same thing.
- Why not?

789
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:59,961
My husband died. He was taken.
He didn't wanna go, he didn't wanna leave.

790
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:02,431
Yes, my husband wanted to leave.

791
01:00:02,603 --> 01:00:06,801
And it's so much easier
being abandoned by choice, is it?

792
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:21,375
I've had my say.

793
01:00:21,552 --> 01:00:23,645
I won't say anymore.

794
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:36,231
So where's he sending you?

795
01:01:29,883 --> 01:01:31,316
Oh, my God.

796
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:33,211
Get the bags.

797
01:01:33,387 --> 01:01:34,376
Oh.

798
01:01:34,555 --> 01:01:35,851
- All right.
- She just elbowed me.

799
01:01:36,022 --> 01:01:39,719
Know what? If that's an indication of
how this trip's gonna be, I won't have it.

800
01:01:58,376 --> 01:02:00,640
Is that her bag? Is that her bag?

801
01:02:00,812 --> 01:02:03,303
- Leave it. Don't take it in.
- This is ridiculous.

802
01:02:12,189 --> 01:02:13,178
Holly?

803
01:02:13,357 --> 01:02:14,415
- This is heavy.
- I know.

804
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:15,991
Holly!

805
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:21,357
Look.

806
01:02:24,768 --> 01:02:29,864
"Hey, Big Mama. Make sure
my baby has a good time.

807
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:33,202
Make sure you and John do everything
you wanna do...

808
01:02:33,376 --> 01:02:35,241
...whenever you wanna do it.

809
01:02:35,411 --> 01:02:37,743
And make sure my baby does things.

810
01:02:39,082 --> 01:02:41,073
- I want you to take her fishing. "
- Oh, God.

811
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:44,777
He's been wanting to get me
on a lake since forever.

812
01:02:44,953 --> 01:02:48,787
"And be sure to give yourself
a big, sweaty pony-boy kiss from me. "

813
01:02:48,957 --> 01:02:52,017
Ugh. Jerk. He will never let me forget
my bachelorette party.

814
01:02:52,194 --> 01:02:53,183
Joey the Pony Boy.

815
01:02:53,362 --> 01:02:54,351
- Tony.
- Tony.

816
01:02:54,529 --> 01:02:57,191
Tony, I remember him.
I bet I have a letter too.

817
01:02:57,366 --> 01:02:58,924
Where would he hide one for me?

818
01:02:59,101 --> 01:03:00,227
Bedroom.

819
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:04,098
"Denise, take Holly to Whelan's,
my favorite pub.

820
01:03:04,272 --> 01:03:07,605
There's beautiful music to be heard,
beautiful people to be around.

821
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:12,041
And Denise, you're going to heaven
for being my baby's friend.

822
01:03:12,213 --> 01:03:15,148
I'm making all the arrangements
up here for you.

823
01:03:15,316 --> 01:03:20,514
Got a few hot men lined up. I hear
Ben Franklin's hung like a racehorse.

824
01:03:20,687 --> 01:03:22,314
Love you. "

825
01:03:23,823 --> 01:03:27,156
- I don't know how you do this.
- Let me see it.

826
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:32,054
What?

827
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,399
He didn't leave me a letter.

828
01:03:36,769 --> 01:03:38,361
Well, probably didn't love you...

829
01:03:38,537 --> 01:03:40,562
...as much as us.
- Mm-mm.

830
01:03:56,254 --> 01:03:59,348
Oh my God, look at that. Look at that!

831
01:03:59,524 --> 01:04:00,684
Oh.

832
01:04:00,858 --> 01:04:02,587
Oh, my God.

833
01:04:05,496 --> 01:04:07,964
Oh. Please let me buy him as a souvenir.

834
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,535
- He's coming this way.
- He's coming.

835
01:04:26,882 --> 01:04:28,907
How long has it been?

836
01:04:29,385 --> 01:04:31,410
How long has what been?

837
01:04:31,754 --> 01:04:35,383
How long has it been?

838
01:04:37,994 --> 01:04:39,154
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

839
01:04:39,328 --> 01:04:41,626
- You're gonna go talk to him. Oh, yeah.
- Mm. No.

840
01:04:41,797 --> 01:04:44,663
You just heard him.
Say how much you like it, flatter him. Go.

841
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:46,460
We don't have those in the States.

842
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:47,965
Go, go.
We don't make those.

843
01:04:48,136 --> 01:04:51,628
- You're ready.
- Go! Do it for us. Go on.

844
01:04:58,646 --> 01:05:01,045
Where'd she go?
- What are you doing? Go ahead!

845
01:05:01,215 --> 01:05:02,842
I'm an old married widow.

846
01:05:03,017 --> 01:05:06,976
Oh, you've got much better stuff
than those tarts. You're experienced.

847
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:09,588
You're American. You got
foreign exotic stuff going...

848
01:05:09,757 --> 01:05:11,884
There's nothing exotic
about being an American.

849
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:13,822
- He doesn't know that.
- We'll help you.

850
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:15,427
- Just take it off.
No, no, no!

851
01:05:15,596 --> 01:05:17,495
Listen! You're gonna do what we say.

852
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:19,528
I'm gonna hurt you.
I'll pull your hair.

853
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:22,668
You look hot. Put your shoulders
back. Puff your hair a little.

854
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:26,134
- You're so sexy. Go.
- Yeah, you look hot. Do it!

855
01:05:36,314 --> 01:05:37,838
Hi.

856
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:42,286
I just wanted to say
I really loved your music.

857
01:05:44,122 --> 01:05:48,081
You're beautiful. I mean...
I mean... Sorry.

858
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:51,092
Your music is beautiful.

859
01:05:51,328 --> 01:05:52,955
Thanks... Um...

860
01:05:53,597 --> 01:05:56,896
- Holly.
- William.

861
01:05:57,068 --> 01:05:59,559
- You're American?
- Yeah.

862
01:05:59,737 --> 01:06:01,364
And what brings you to Ireland?

863
01:06:01,539 --> 01:06:04,770
Holiday. Oh, well, with my girlfriends.

864
01:06:05,176 --> 01:06:06,302
- Hi.
- Hi.

865
01:06:06,477 --> 01:06:08,910
Good. Good to have you here.

866
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:11,739
- Heh. Thanks.
- I have one more song to play.

867
01:06:11,948 --> 01:06:13,506
Will you stay and have a listen?

868
01:06:13,683 --> 01:06:17,278
It's an American song about a local girl.
I think you'll like it.

869
01:06:17,454 --> 01:06:19,786
- Sure.
- Good.

870
01:06:19,956 --> 01:06:21,389
Grand.

871
01:06:22,759 --> 01:06:24,692
So I'll see you after, then?

872
01:06:25,127 --> 01:06:26,253
Okay, sure.

873
01:06:34,336 --> 01:06:35,894
Em...

874
01:06:37,072 --> 01:06:41,098
This is an American song
dedicated to Holly.

875
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:44,201
I hope you enjoy it.

876
01:06:55,189 --> 01:06:57,952
<i>Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk</i>

877
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:00,958
<i>Of a day I-ay-I-ay</i>

878
01:07:01,737 --> 01:07:06,504
<i>I met a little girl and we stopped to talk
Of a fine soft day I-ay</i>

879
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:10,269
<i>And I ask you, friend
Well, what's a fella to do</i>

880
01:07:12,948 --> 01:07:16,246
<i>'Cause her hair was black
And her eyes were blue</i>

881
01:07:17,218 --> 01:07:22,212
<i>And I knew right then
I'd be takin' a whirl</i>

882
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:26,616
<i>Round the Salthill Prom
With a Galway girl</i>

883
01:07:38,905 --> 01:07:40,429
That's a very nice jacket.

884
01:07:40,907 --> 01:07:42,875
<i>I won it in a bet.</i>

885
01:07:45,578 --> 01:07:48,274
<i>We were halfway there
When the rain came down</i>

886
01:07:48,448 --> 01:07:49,471
<i>Of a day</i>

887
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:51,513
<i>L- ay-I-ay</i>

888
01:07:51,683 --> 01:07:56,416
<i>And she asked me up to her flat downtown
Of a fine soft day I-ay</i>

889
01:07:56,688 --> 01:08:00,784
<i>And I ask you, friend
What's a fella to do</i>

890
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:05,823
<i>'Cause her hair was black
And her eyes were blue</i>

891
01:08:07,231 --> 01:08:09,131
Enough of this.

892
01:08:37,027 --> 01:08:40,018
Why does he want me to remember
all these things that make it harder?

893
01:08:40,196 --> 01:08:41,254
It's cruel.

894
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:45,764
I don't know, baby.
But I don't think he means to be cruel.

895
01:08:45,935 --> 01:08:48,130
What does he mean?

896
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:51,035
I don't know.

897
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:54,472
Come on, let's go.
We're taking you back.

898
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:32,009
- I think you should find William.
- No.

899
01:09:32,178 --> 01:09:35,341
I left without saying anything.
He must think I'm an idiot.

900
01:09:35,514 --> 01:09:38,244
Well, you're an American.
They expect us to be idiots.

901
01:09:38,651 --> 01:09:39,845
Don't push her.

902
01:09:40,286 --> 01:09:42,254
If she's not ready, she's not ready.

903
01:09:43,189 --> 01:09:46,283
Although if memory serves me correctly,
Holly...

904
01:09:46,459 --> 01:09:49,586
...the longer you go without sex,
the meaner and bitchier you get.

905
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:51,228
- Eat me.
- Hello.

906
01:09:53,832 --> 01:09:56,392
Well, I'm really mad at Gerry.

907
01:09:56,768 --> 01:10:01,603
Maybe that's why he did it. You have to
stop wanting him at some point.

908
01:10:03,308 --> 01:10:04,433
When?

909
01:10:07,211 --> 01:10:08,439
- Grab the pole!
- What?

910
01:10:08,612 --> 01:10:10,512
- You've got a fish!
- It's a fish!

911
01:10:10,681 --> 01:10:12,114
- Okay.
Holly, grab the pole!

912
01:10:12,283 --> 01:10:14,649
- Okay, I'm grabbing it! I am, I am.
Take it out.

913
01:10:14,818 --> 01:10:16,843
- Hurry it up!
- Aah!

914
01:10:17,054 --> 01:10:19,750
You're not holding the ball.
Turn the knobby thing!

915
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:23,324
- Will you stop being so butch?!
Just watch it! Oh! Ow!

916
01:10:23,793 --> 01:10:25,522
- Help me!
Do you wanna get the fish?

917
01:10:25,695 --> 01:10:28,664
I'm trying.
Stop! My nails are wet!

918
01:10:28,831 --> 01:10:31,026
- Guys!
- Careful!

919
01:10:31,234 --> 01:10:32,895
Guys, I lost...

920
01:10:47,482 --> 01:10:49,245
Oh, my God.

921
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,781
What happened to our oars?

922
01:11:00,027 --> 01:11:01,153
Oh, my God.

923
01:11:03,898 --> 01:11:04,922
Help!

924
01:11:07,368 --> 01:11:09,996
Help!

925
01:11:10,404 --> 01:11:13,463
Help!

926
01:11:16,876 --> 01:11:18,707
I hate cosmetics companies.

927
01:11:18,878 --> 01:11:21,779
They get you addicted to
the perfect lipstick or nail polish...

928
01:11:21,948 --> 01:11:24,712
...and then six months later,
they discontinue it.

929
01:11:24,884 --> 01:11:28,684
You have to buy your favorite colors like
you're storing up for the apocalypse.

930
01:11:28,854 --> 01:11:30,321
That was my last bottle of this.

931
01:11:33,092 --> 01:11:35,219
I think that one of us
should swim ashore...

932
01:11:35,394 --> 01:11:37,726
...and it should be the one
who's already inflated.

933
01:11:37,896 --> 01:11:39,056
Okay, no, that's good. Here!

934
01:11:45,937 --> 01:11:47,928
- There, go swim ashore.
- Was that necessary?

935
01:11:48,106 --> 01:11:49,698
- You can swim ashore.
- You happy...

936
01:11:49,874 --> 01:11:51,933
...I inhaled all these toxins?
- You jump in!

937
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:54,578
- Stop fighting! You're acting like babies!
- All right. Shut up!

938
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:00,147
Nice.

939
01:12:08,525 --> 01:12:11,983
Maybe we'll eventually
drift towards the shore.

940
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,096
What shore? That could take months.

941
01:12:14,564 --> 01:12:18,762
Better not take more than nine or else
there'll be another person on this boat.

942
01:12:19,369 --> 01:12:20,995
What?

943
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:25,364
I wasn't gonna say anything
until we got back.

944
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,035
I'm having a baby.

945
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:32,940
A baby? Sharon, wow.

946
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:34,343
I know, I know.

947
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,109
- When are you due?
- March.

948
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:39,344
Oh, thank God.
You can still be in my wedding.

949
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:40,613
What?

950
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:43,690
Ah! I'm getting married.
Tom proposed, I said yes...

951
01:12:43,858 --> 01:12:45,723
...and we're planning
a New Year's Eve wedding.

952
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:48,590
Aah! Gosh!

953
01:12:48,763 --> 01:12:51,288
Congratulations!

954
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:56,597
- You okay?
- Yeah. No. Yeah.

955
01:12:56,770 --> 01:13:02,367
No, I mean, it's just... This is just
a lot of information to get in one boat.

956
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:04,306
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

957
01:13:04,478 --> 01:13:07,811
I wasn't gonna say anything
until we got back. This is your trip.

958
01:13:07,981 --> 01:13:10,211
- No, no, it's okay.
- Yeah, no, me too.

959
01:13:10,384 --> 01:13:14,376
But, you know, we might die here,
so I'm not going down as a spinster.

960
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:16,781
- You're getting married.
- You're having a baby.

961
01:13:16,956 --> 01:13:20,824
- Oh, my God. What, are you kidding me?
- What?

962
01:13:20,993 --> 01:13:22,483
- God.
- I know.

963
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:02,058
Mm.

964
01:14:02,232 --> 01:14:03,256
Who's the cook?

965
01:14:03,433 --> 01:14:04,422
- I am.
- Me.

966
01:14:04,601 --> 01:14:05,795
- We all helped.
- Ugh.

967
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:10,601
Denise is getting married.
Isn't that great?

968
01:14:10,874 --> 01:14:12,808
Sharon's pregnant. Heh.

969
01:14:12,976 --> 01:14:15,274
Congratulations to both of you.
Thank you.

970
01:14:15,445 --> 01:14:16,434
Thank you.

971
01:14:17,614 --> 01:14:20,673
The food was great. I don't think
I came up for air once.

972
01:14:24,486 --> 01:14:27,250
You know, it got a lot darker
while I was busy.

973
01:14:29,491 --> 01:14:32,051
Mm. Yeah, it gets dark at night...

974
01:14:33,762 --> 01:14:35,127
...here.

975
01:14:36,697 --> 01:14:38,096
You work on the lake?

976
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:41,793
Two days a week. Kind of a patrolman.

977
01:14:41,969 --> 01:14:44,870
Although, I gotta say, first time
I ever had to save anyone.

978
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:48,531
I feel really badly about you having
to drive all the way back this late.

979
01:14:48,709 --> 01:14:50,802
- That's enough.
In this rain, forget it.

980
01:14:50,978 --> 01:14:52,740
Feel free to stay till morning.

981
01:14:52,913 --> 01:14:57,077
Yeah, we have a pull-out couch.
A bed that pulls out.

982
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,547
Oh.

983
01:14:58,985 --> 01:15:01,146
It is a long drive.

984
01:15:01,421 --> 01:15:03,389
- I would love a shower.
- What a great idea!

985
01:15:03,557 --> 01:15:07,220
There's one downstairs, it's fantastic.
I'll get you some linens and towels.

986
01:15:07,394 --> 01:15:08,725
I'll show you.

987
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:13,224
Great. Take your wine...

988
01:15:22,007 --> 01:15:23,634
What, are you crazy?

989
01:15:23,809 --> 01:15:25,276
He's staying the whole night.

990
01:15:25,444 --> 01:15:27,934
He's gonna be here all night long,
all night long.

991
01:15:28,112 --> 01:15:30,137
He's gonna be here all night.

992
01:16:12,688 --> 01:16:14,679
You have to get pregnant immediately.

993
01:16:14,857 --> 01:16:17,882
Immediately. We can have kids together.

994
01:16:18,059 --> 01:16:21,586
How cute is that?
I mean, how cute is that?

995
01:16:21,763 --> 01:16:25,699
I don't know, I have this weird feeling.
I feel like there's a boy inside of me.

996
01:16:50,157 --> 01:16:54,024
Oh, Jesus! Oh, sorry.
I thought you were upstairs.

997
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:56,024
I need to just get my clothes.

998
01:16:57,063 --> 01:16:58,860
I'll get out of your way.

999
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,436
Sorry about that.

1000
01:17:08,674 --> 01:17:10,801
Would you like a drink?

1001
01:17:10,976 --> 01:17:13,774
Should I just lick it off the counter, then?

1002
01:17:13,979 --> 01:17:15,241
- Oh, no!
- Yeah.

1003
01:17:15,414 --> 01:17:18,474
Sorry, no... It's been a long time
since I've seen a man that naked.

1004
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:22,177
I mean, you have a...
How about that drink?

1005
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:25,484
- You're very sweet.
- Oh, God.

1006
01:17:25,656 --> 01:17:29,057
The last time a guy said that he followed
it up with, "But I don't date 13-year-olds. "

1007
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:33,291
Well, lucky for you, neither do I.

1008
01:17:33,864 --> 01:17:35,297
Cheers.

1009
01:17:35,466 --> 01:17:36,763
Cheers.

1010
01:17:46,876 --> 01:17:48,343
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Hi.

1011
01:17:48,511 --> 01:17:51,912
Sorry. Oh, I can't do this, I'm sorry.
It's not you.

1012
01:17:52,082 --> 01:17:54,516
<i>Look at me, I'm shaking.
I don't know how to do this.</i>

1013
01:17:54,684 --> 01:17:57,175
Don't even know if I want to,
I haven't been held in...

1014
01:17:57,354 --> 01:18:01,380
Oh, never mind. I'm just screwed up.
I'm trouble. Yeah.

1015
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:04,224
- I like trouble.
- Oh, no. Heh.

1016
01:18:04,393 --> 01:18:06,759
<i>I don't mean "cool Pulp Fiction" trouble...</i>

1017
01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:10,922
...I mean "mental case wacko" trouble.

1018
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:15,635
I'm out of my league here. I mean,
I haven't had a new man in over 10 years.

1019
01:18:15,803 --> 01:18:17,930
I had this old one. I mean, he wasn't old.

1020
01:18:18,106 --> 01:18:20,631
He was just old to me
because I had him so often.

1021
01:18:20,808 --> 01:18:22,833
He was my husband, but he died.

1022
01:18:25,346 --> 01:18:27,837
Kissing him like that,
I'm not surprised, poor lad.

1023
01:18:38,759 --> 01:18:39,953
No, it's not gonna work.

1024
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:44,920
I feel like I'm trying on a new pair of shoes
I really wanna buy, but they just don't fit.

1025
01:18:45,098 --> 01:18:46,827
Sorry.

1026
01:18:47,134 --> 01:18:51,661
All right then, how about
going barefoot for a while?

1027
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:23,959
There's no man, alive or dead,
who's gonna fault you for living.

1028
01:19:25,102 --> 01:19:27,502
You're very sweet.

1029
01:19:29,373 --> 01:19:33,867
He was a good man, I reckon,
your man who died.

1030
01:19:34,578 --> 01:19:36,205
Yes...

1031
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,071
...a very good man.

1032
01:19:47,123 --> 01:19:48,715
- William?
- Hmm?

1033
01:19:49,792 --> 01:19:53,421
Could you drive me to Enniskerry
in the morning?

1034
01:19:53,596 --> 01:19:54,995
Sure.

1035
01:19:55,498 --> 01:19:56,931
You got friends there?

1036
01:19:57,099 --> 01:19:59,828
Family. Sort of.

1037
01:20:00,302 --> 01:20:03,203
- In-laws. I should see them.
- Hmm.

1038
01:20:04,473 --> 01:20:07,101
What's their name? Maybe I know them.

1039
01:20:07,342 --> 01:20:08,775
The Kennedys.

1040
01:20:11,046 --> 01:20:13,640
Not Rose and Martin?

1041
01:20:14,049 --> 01:20:17,711
Yeah. You know them?

1042
01:20:22,122 --> 01:20:24,556
You're not Gerry's Holly?

1043
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:26,383
What?

1044
01:20:26,727 --> 01:20:28,285
Oh...

1045
01:20:28,896 --> 01:20:30,989
You're the girl from the pub that night.

1046
01:20:32,031 --> 01:20:34,295
I was in Gerry's band.

1047
01:20:34,467 --> 01:20:36,594
Not Billy...

1048
01:20:36,769 --> 01:20:38,031
...Gallagher?
- One and the same.

1049
01:20:39,772 --> 01:20:41,797
It's... It's all right.

1050
01:20:41,975 --> 01:20:44,341
It's all right. Me and Gerry,
we shared everything together.

1051
01:20:45,945 --> 01:20:48,879
Oh, no, no, no, I didn't mean it like that.

1052
01:20:49,047 --> 01:20:52,244
What I meant was, you know,
he wouldn't have a problem...

1053
01:20:53,519 --> 01:20:55,612
Well, he might have a problem
but, you know...

1054
01:20:55,787 --> 01:20:58,654
...there's not much
he can do about it now, is there?

1055
01:21:00,826 --> 01:21:02,384
Holly.

1056
01:21:03,362 --> 01:21:06,387
Come here. Come back to bed.

1057
01:21:07,431 --> 01:21:09,729
Now, let's... Let's talk.

1058
01:21:12,803 --> 01:21:14,270
Oh...

1059
01:21:14,572 --> 01:21:16,733
I heard he died.

1060
01:21:18,676 --> 01:21:21,873
Tumor, was it? Yeah.

1061
01:21:22,646 --> 01:21:25,911
You know, Gerry and I, we...

1062
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:29,916
We hadn't seen each other
in a long, long while.

1063
01:21:30,587 --> 01:21:33,112
It's sad when that happens
to best friends, isn't it?

1064
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:39,592
He... He was a wonderful lad.

1065
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:44,799
It's all right, you know.

1066
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:47,698
It's okay.

1067
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:50,467
You know, these things...

1068
01:21:50,973 --> 01:21:53,533
...they happen now and again.
Not very often...

1069
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:57,077
...but now and again.

1070
01:22:01,015 --> 01:22:03,950
Would you like me to tell you
some stories about me and Gerry?

1071
01:22:04,118 --> 01:22:06,052
I've got plenty.

1072
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:08,354
Yeah?

1073
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:11,951
Okay, here you go. Come on, sit back.

1074
01:22:16,763 --> 01:22:18,560
You know, he was...

1075
01:22:18,732 --> 01:22:21,166
He was my very, very best mate.

1076
01:22:21,802 --> 01:22:26,398
Starting back when we were terrors
running about at 5 and 6.

1077
01:22:28,275 --> 01:22:30,333
Oh, he made me laugh.

1078
01:22:30,509 --> 01:22:33,478
There was this time,
I don't remember how old we were...

1079
01:22:33,646 --> 01:22:36,080
...probably, you know, 10, 11.

1080
01:22:36,849 --> 01:22:38,407
We jumped on a train...

1081
01:23:29,832 --> 01:23:34,599
We received those packages you sent.
Come in. Come in.

1082
01:23:40,609 --> 01:23:41,667
Martin?

1083
01:23:43,311 --> 01:23:44,938
Look who it is.

1084
01:23:45,113 --> 01:23:48,048
Oh, well, look at that.

1085
01:23:48,216 --> 01:23:50,047
Come here, dear.

1086
01:23:50,252 --> 01:23:52,516
So nice to see you.

1087
01:23:53,288 --> 01:23:56,552
He was always one for writing.
Wasn't he?

1088
01:23:56,724 --> 01:23:58,123
Should've gone professional.

1089
01:23:58,292 --> 01:24:01,352
No. He did it for the love of it, Martin.

1090
01:24:01,896 --> 01:24:04,091
Now, where is it?

1091
01:24:04,365 --> 01:24:05,855
Oh, here it is.

1092
01:24:06,033 --> 01:24:10,197
"When Holly visits, take her
to my fort in the back yard...

1093
01:24:10,371 --> 01:24:11,997
...and give her this envelope. "

1094
01:24:12,505 --> 01:24:15,099
He knew that I'd come visit you?

1095
01:24:15,408 --> 01:24:19,037
Hmm. Suppose he did. Heh. Martin.

1096
01:24:19,612 --> 01:24:21,045
All right.

1097
01:24:25,485 --> 01:24:28,976
It's not really a fort,
it's just a stone wall.

1098
01:24:29,154 --> 01:24:31,281
He used to call it that when he was little.

1099
01:24:33,459 --> 01:24:36,257
He goes on about other things...

1100
01:24:36,695 --> 01:24:38,219
...lovely things.

1101
01:24:40,265 --> 01:24:44,599
He hadn't much strength in the end
though, did he?

1102
01:24:46,237 --> 01:24:49,900
Makes me sick to think
we weren't there when he died...

1103
01:24:50,074 --> 01:24:51,098
...for the funeral.

1104
01:24:51,275 --> 01:24:53,869
But you could hardly walk
just after your operation.

1105
01:24:54,545 --> 01:24:58,743
Maybe you'll come and visit us a bit more
now that he's gone, eh?

1106
01:24:58,983 --> 01:25:01,008
Martin, don't put that on her.

1107
01:25:01,185 --> 01:25:03,345
You're under no obligation.

1108
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,546
It's not like we're blood family.

1109
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:09,283
I'd like to come visit.

1110
01:25:09,459 --> 01:25:13,327
And I'm sorry we didn't in the past. L...

1111
01:25:14,231 --> 01:25:17,962
I just thought you were angry with me
for taking Gerry away.

1112
01:25:18,135 --> 01:25:21,035
- She wanted you dead, you know.
- Martin, don't you dare!

1113
01:25:21,203 --> 01:25:23,364
No, I don't blame you.

1114
01:25:23,539 --> 01:25:26,975
You know, my mother, she never
quite got over the idea either.

1115
01:25:27,143 --> 01:25:31,637
Yeah, well, you were both so young.
And it happened too fast.

1116
01:25:33,449 --> 01:25:38,010
But Gerry loved you. I saw that.

1117
01:25:38,586 --> 01:25:40,520
I saw that.

1118
01:25:46,728 --> 01:25:50,061
<i>To my Galway Girl:
You're an angel for seeing my folks.</i>

1119
01:25:50,231 --> 01:25:55,133
<i>I told you my mom didn't hate your guts.
Well, you know, anymore.</i>

1120
01:25:55,736 --> 01:26:00,196
<i>You are now standing in my fort
where I did all my big thinking.</i>

1121
01:26:00,374 --> 01:26:05,835
<i>This is where I stood thinking about you
after the very first time we met.</i>

1122
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:17,950
<i>You didn't look real to me at first.</i>

1123
01:26:18,124 --> 01:26:20,991
<i>I never saw so many colors
on one girl before...</i>

1124
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,993
<i>...but you looked like
you belonged out there, all right.</i>

1125
01:26:24,163 --> 01:26:26,495
<i>You and all your colors.</i>

1126
01:26:26,699 --> 01:26:29,826
<i>Do you remember
the first thing you ever said to me?</i>

1127
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:31,525
I'm lost.

1128
01:26:31,703 --> 01:26:35,070
<i>Oh, you didn't look lost, not to me.</i>

1129
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,435
So, what are you looking for out here?

1130
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:40,635
Wicklow Mountains National Park?

1131
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:45,938
Wicklow Mountains National Park.
Tell me, how long you been walking for?

1132
01:26:46,116 --> 01:26:47,481
A few hours.

1133
01:26:47,651 --> 01:26:51,678
Well, you've probably been in
the national park for a few hours, then.

1134
01:26:51,989 --> 01:26:53,889
Oh, my God.

1135
01:26:54,258 --> 01:26:55,589
This is a park?

1136
01:26:55,759 --> 01:26:57,386
Uh-huh.

1137
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:00,123
Oh.

1138
01:27:00,297 --> 01:27:01,661
It's so cold!

1139
01:27:01,831 --> 01:27:04,095
The paper said it was gonna be warm.

1140
01:27:04,267 --> 01:27:08,260
It is warm. I know you're lost, but
you do know you're in Ireland, don't you?

1141
01:27:10,173 --> 01:27:13,370
Well, I better head back. Heh.

1142
01:27:13,676 --> 01:27:20,239
- And where is that?
- I'm staying at a B and B in Dunlougahairy.

1143
01:27:20,415 --> 01:27:23,748
Dunlagohairy?
No, I think you mean Dתn Laoghaire.

1144
01:27:23,919 --> 01:27:27,787
- Heh-heh. You're kidding?
- No. Would I lie to you?

1145
01:27:29,391 --> 01:27:32,588
- Dתn Laoghaire?
- Dתn Laoghaire.

1146
01:27:34,763 --> 01:27:37,754
Okay. Thanks.

1147
01:27:37,965 --> 01:27:39,592
<i>You're grand.</i>

1148
01:27:40,768 --> 01:27:42,998
But you're going the wrong way,
you know.

1149
01:27:48,843 --> 01:27:50,071
That way?

1150
01:27:50,244 --> 01:27:51,802
Okay.

1151
01:27:51,978 --> 01:27:54,970
I think you quite enjoy this getting lost,
don't you?

1152
01:27:55,882 --> 01:28:00,080
You know, actually,
I don't mind so much, not here.

1153
01:28:00,787 --> 01:28:02,277
So how did you come to be here?

1154
01:28:02,455 --> 01:28:06,414
Oh, on my way home, college trip.
We started in Greece.

1155
01:28:06,593 --> 01:28:09,584
Jesus, that's a long walk.
That's a bad joke.

1156
01:28:09,762 --> 01:28:11,093
What are you studying?

1157
01:28:12,298 --> 01:28:14,459
- Art. Yeah.
- Art?

1158
01:28:14,633 --> 01:28:18,091
<i>- Oh, so you're an artist, then?
- Oh. I don't know yet.</i>

1159
01:28:18,537 --> 01:28:19,526
That's great.

1160
01:28:20,873 --> 01:28:22,807
Do you make anything or?

1161
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:25,399
I don't know yet.

1162
01:28:26,778 --> 01:28:28,575
Well, good luck with that.

1163
01:28:31,316 --> 01:28:32,613
Oh.

1164
01:28:40,024 --> 01:28:41,582
You...

1165
01:28:41,759 --> 01:28:45,922
Would you mind if we walked together
since we're going in the same direction?

1166
01:28:46,096 --> 01:28:49,827
I'll stay on this side of the road.
Don't even have to talk. Just...

1167
01:28:50,667 --> 01:28:54,763
Just quite nice, sometimes walking
along with someone without talking...

1168
01:28:54,938 --> 01:28:57,805
...once you get your feet wet.

1169
01:29:09,418 --> 01:29:11,409
<i>At first, the no-talking thing didn't last.</i>

1170
01:29:11,587 --> 01:29:13,452
<i>Before long, I couldn't get you to shut up.</i>

1171
01:29:13,622 --> 01:29:20,117
<i>But you were so cute, trying to impress me
with William Blake and all your grand plans.</i>

1172
01:29:20,295 --> 01:29:22,456
<i>I had no idea
what you were talking about...</i>

1173
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:25,531
<i>...but I couldn't help
loving the way you talked.</i>

1174
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:29,227
"I must create a... "

1175
01:29:29,471 --> 01:29:33,804
Something. "... or be enslaved
by another man's... " Something.

1176
01:29:33,974 --> 01:29:36,875
Wait, "I will not...

1177
01:29:38,278 --> 01:29:41,714
I will not reason or compare.

1178
01:29:41,882 --> 01:29:44,715
My business is to create... "

1179
01:29:45,085 --> 01:29:47,679
- Something. Oh, God.
- Did you just make that up then?

1180
01:29:47,855 --> 01:29:51,517
No, it's William Blake,
but I completely screwed it up.

1181
01:29:51,691 --> 01:29:54,159
No, you didn't, you made it better.
I understood it.

1182
01:29:54,327 --> 01:29:55,794
<i>I didn't have a clue, actually.</i>

1183
01:29:55,962 --> 01:30:01,059
All I know is, if you don't figure out the
"something," you'll just stay ordinary.

1184
01:30:01,234 --> 01:30:07,002
And it doesn't matter if it's a work
of art, or a taco, or a pair of socks.

1185
01:30:07,206 --> 01:30:11,301
Just create something new
and there it is.

1186
01:30:11,476 --> 01:30:14,843
And it's you, out in the world,
outside of you.

1187
01:30:15,013 --> 01:30:19,143
And you can look at it, or hear it,
or read it, or feel it...

1188
01:30:19,317 --> 01:30:21,751
...and you know
a little bit more about you.

1189
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,752
A little bit more than anybody else does.

1190
01:30:25,222 --> 01:30:26,883
Does that make any sense at all?

1191
01:30:28,492 --> 01:30:30,016
Yeah.

1192
01:30:30,594 --> 01:30:32,425
You're saying you want to paint socks.

1193
01:30:34,031 --> 01:30:35,760
Maybe.

1194
01:30:37,201 --> 01:30:39,396
<i>I loved you right then and there.</i>

1195
01:30:43,973 --> 01:30:46,203
Hey, I like this jacket.

1196
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:49,910
It looks good on you. Got it on a bet.

1197
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,775
- What was the bet?
- Heh.

1198
01:30:52,582 --> 01:30:55,142
I was a few Guinness's
for the worse at this point...

1199
01:30:55,318 --> 01:30:58,514
...but a fella bet me
that I couldn't get a certain girl...

1200
01:30:58,687 --> 01:31:00,882
...to kiss me without a provocation.

1201
01:31:01,056 --> 01:31:03,547
- What girl?
- His girl.

1202
01:31:03,725 --> 01:31:05,420
- Oh! Ha-ha.
- Uh-huh. Ha-ha.

1203
01:31:05,594 --> 01:31:08,427
- How'd you do it?
- There's nothing to it, really.

1204
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:12,723
A fella just has to tell a woman
the truth without words.

1205
01:31:12,901 --> 01:31:15,664
It's like a signal you send out.

1206
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:17,828
The woman, she just picks it up.

1207
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:20,238
And what's the truth?

1208
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:26,610
That kissing her would be
the end of life as I know it.

1209
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:30,081
Wow.

1210
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:34,110
And that's true of every girl
you've gotten to kiss you?

1211
01:31:35,822 --> 01:31:39,121
I could turn it on and off when I was
younger and I had no principles.

1212
01:31:39,292 --> 01:31:44,491
When every girl that I was lucky enough
to kiss was the end of life as I knew it.

1213
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,333
And now?

1214
01:31:50,603 --> 01:31:55,233
Now I only send it out when I think
she might be the one that makes it true.

1215
01:32:04,884 --> 01:32:07,875
I know where I am now.
Thanks, it was really nice to meet you.

1216
01:32:08,052 --> 01:32:10,486
- No, I could walk you into town.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

1217
01:32:10,655 --> 01:32:13,590
I know where I am.
I know where I'm going.

1218
01:32:17,662 --> 01:32:19,493
I'll never forget this.

1219
01:32:24,568 --> 01:32:25,796
Your jacket.

1220
01:32:29,506 --> 01:32:30,905
No, wait!

1221
01:32:31,074 --> 01:32:32,541
Wait, wait, don't move.

1222
01:32:32,709 --> 01:32:35,473
- What?
- Oh, yeah, it's a wild Irish dog.

1223
01:32:35,646 --> 01:32:36,635
- A what?
- Shh!

1224
01:32:37,714 --> 01:32:39,648
- You have to stand still.
- Okay.

1225
01:32:39,816 --> 01:32:43,979
Get close, like one person.

1226
01:32:44,153 --> 01:32:47,054
And if we separate, he'll feel...

1227
01:32:47,223 --> 01:32:49,817
...threatened and attack our vital parts.

1228
01:32:49,992 --> 01:32:52,893
- What vital parts? All my parts are vital.
- Shh, shh.

1229
01:32:55,798 --> 01:32:57,230
We have to stand still.

1230
01:32:57,399 --> 01:33:00,232
Now, just let him sniff around a bit.

1231
01:33:02,771 --> 01:33:04,068
Now wait.

1232
01:33:12,814 --> 01:33:14,872
I'm really scared.

1233
01:33:15,049 --> 01:33:17,040
Would you put
your arms around me?

1234
01:33:17,218 --> 01:33:18,583
All right.

1235
01:33:18,752 --> 01:33:21,516
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
- Yeah.

1236
01:33:23,324 --> 01:33:27,954
Do you think we could turn around and
face each other without freaking him out?

1237
01:33:28,996 --> 01:33:32,396
Ahh... Okay. Sure.

1238
01:33:32,599 --> 01:33:35,591
- But let's move very slowly, okay?
- Okay.

1239
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:43,467
- Ow.
- Oh, sorry.

1240
01:33:43,643 --> 01:33:46,203
I haven't done this in a while.

1241
01:33:46,379 --> 01:33:49,438
I've been seeing this boy,
but we don't do much. I don't know why.

1242
01:33:49,748 --> 01:33:53,149
- Maybe it's me.
- No, he's a boy who...

1243
01:33:54,886 --> 01:33:57,480
...doesn't know anything about kissing.

1244
01:33:58,523 --> 01:33:59,990
That's a man's business.

1245
01:34:01,026 --> 01:34:02,584
Is it?

1246
01:34:25,181 --> 01:34:28,116
That was the most perfect...

1247
01:34:29,786 --> 01:34:31,947
...perfect first kiss.

1248
01:34:33,156 --> 01:34:35,420
That was the second.

1249
01:34:35,725 --> 01:34:37,022
This is the third.

1250
01:35:00,181 --> 01:35:01,978
Brody, come.

1251
01:35:02,383 --> 01:35:03,372
Hey, Gerry.

1252
01:35:04,152 --> 01:35:05,983
Yeah. How are you, Jeff?

1253
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:12,057
- Hey, where you going?
- No, stay. Stay.

1254
01:35:12,226 --> 01:35:14,455
No, but... You have my jacket.

1255
01:35:14,628 --> 01:35:17,791
I know, I'm keeping it
unless we meet again.

1256
01:35:18,098 --> 01:35:19,395
I bet we do.

1257
01:35:19,566 --> 01:35:21,864
That's a bet you're gonna
have to win because...

1258
01:35:22,035 --> 01:35:25,300
...if we do meet again then that'll be
the end of it, you know.

1259
01:35:26,106 --> 01:35:27,232
The end of what?

1260
01:35:27,741 --> 01:35:29,174
Life as we know it.

1261
01:35:31,677 --> 01:35:34,942
- Look, I'm singing at this pub...
- No, no, no. Don't tell me.

1262
01:35:35,114 --> 01:35:37,912
If I happen to walk into the right one
in the right town...

1263
01:35:38,084 --> 01:35:41,349
...then we'll know for sure, won't we?
And if I don't...

1264
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:45,513
...then that'll just be the most perfect
kiss ever created by two strangers...

1265
01:35:45,691 --> 01:35:48,591
...and we'll just keep it perfect
for the rest of our lives.

1266
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:51,051
- What's your name?
- No, no! Wait, no, don't.

1267
01:35:51,229 --> 01:35:53,322
Don't, don't. No, no...

1268
01:35:58,269 --> 01:36:00,601
<i>Life had changed as I knew it.</i>

1269
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:03,799
<i>And now it's changed again, luv.</i>

1270
01:36:03,974 --> 01:36:06,807
<i>See, I don't worry about you
remembering me...</i>

1271
01:36:06,977 --> 01:36:10,538
<i>...it's that girl on the road
you keep forgetting.</i>

1272
01:36:10,714 --> 01:36:14,343
"My business is to create.

1273
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,519
It doesn't even matter what you do. "

1274
01:36:18,088 --> 01:36:20,487
You told me that, remember.

1275
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:24,951
P.S.

1276
01:36:36,172 --> 01:36:39,072
<i>So go home. Go find it.</i>

1277
01:36:39,241 --> 01:36:42,836
<i>Find that thing
that makes you like nobody else.</i>

1278
01:36:43,011 --> 01:36:44,569
<i>I'll help.</i>

1279
01:36:44,746 --> 01:36:46,680
<i>Look for a sign.</i>

1280
01:36:49,618 --> 01:36:52,246
<i>It's Mom.
Sharon called, said you're home.</i>

1281
01:36:52,421 --> 01:36:53,820
<i>Where are you?
Call me.</i>

1282
01:36:53,989 --> 01:36:57,219
<i>You haven't returned my calls. Come
to my first baby doctor's appointment.</i>

1283
01:36:57,391 --> 01:36:59,450
<i>What is going on?
Nobody's heard from you...</i>

1284
01:36:59,627 --> 01:37:01,527
<i>...my maid of honor. Call me.
Call me.</i>

1285
01:37:01,695 --> 01:37:05,961
<i>If you need to find any job
to get by, be realistic, luv, all right?</i>

1286
01:37:06,133 --> 01:37:08,328
<i>I cannot believe
you are not calling me back!</i>

1287
01:37:08,502 --> 01:37:10,265
<i>You can't be a secret agent...</i>

1288
01:37:10,438 --> 01:37:12,496
<i>...and there's no such thing
as a vampire slayer.</i>

1289
01:37:12,672 --> 01:37:15,436
<i>I'm getting married. Where are you?
Pick up the phone!</i>

1290
01:37:15,608 --> 01:37:17,439
<i>His death is a part of your life now.</i>

1291
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:18,668
<i>I am so mad at you!</i>

1292
01:37:23,917 --> 01:37:25,976
<i>Shh. There she is.</i>

1293
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:40,427
Great shoes.

1294
01:37:47,171 --> 01:37:49,230
<i>Okay, this message is for Holly Kennedy.</i>

1295
01:37:49,407 --> 01:37:51,102
<i>Please tell her, her friend Denise...</i>

1296
01:37:51,275 --> 01:37:55,109
<i>...is getting married December 31 st
and she's not invited. Okay?</i>

1297
01:37:55,279 --> 01:37:57,338
<i>How about that? You're not invited.</i>

1298
01:39:33,238 --> 01:39:35,604
Look at this. It needs to be tighter!

1299
01:39:35,774 --> 01:39:37,867
All right, I will do whatever you want...

1300
01:39:38,043 --> 01:39:39,908
...but I'm not so sure, I mean, I think...

1301
01:39:40,078 --> 01:39:43,945
No, listen, your bust looks absolutely
right, because let me tell you something...

1302
01:39:44,114 --> 01:39:46,582
...you don't want to look too busty.

1303
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:50,743
Yeah, well, see, although, you know,
my breasts are beautiful and firm...

1304
01:39:50,921 --> 01:39:55,085
...they do often have a mind of their own
and they can go off in different directions...

1305
01:39:55,259 --> 01:39:57,250
...without adult supervision.

1306
01:39:57,428 --> 01:40:00,454
So could you please just take it in just
a quarter-inch? Just a quarter-inch.

1307
01:40:00,631 --> 01:40:01,824
- Okay.
- Okay.

1308
01:40:07,036 --> 01:40:10,528
Could you give us...
Excuse us for a minute, please?

1309
01:40:10,707 --> 01:40:12,538
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1310
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:20,109
You look beautiful.

1311
01:40:21,049 --> 01:40:22,778
Well, I could've used some help.

1312
01:40:23,318 --> 01:40:27,584
This is the twelfth dress
I've tried on. So...

1313
01:40:29,424 --> 01:40:30,584
I'm sorry.

1314
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:35,586
Well, you were supposed to be my maid of
honor, but of course I didn't hear from you.

1315
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:41,124
Sharon feels too conspicuous since
she's popped. So, guess what?

1316
01:40:41,302 --> 01:40:43,463
I had to ask Tom's 51-year-old sister...

1317
01:40:43,638 --> 01:40:46,471
...who looks like Jerry Springer
and doesn't like me...

1318
01:40:48,809 --> 01:40:52,141
...all because my best friend couldn't
stand me being so happy.

1319
01:40:52,912 --> 01:40:54,402
Why? Why is that?

1320
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:58,847
Because our lives were moving on and you
weren't the center of attention anymore?

1321
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:00,646
- Yes.
- Really?

1322
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:04,051
- It was awful and I'm really sorry.
- Oh, no, I'm so sorry, honey.

1323
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:05,350
No, I'm so sorry.

1324
01:41:05,525 --> 01:41:07,117
You were right and I was wrong.

1325
01:41:07,293 --> 01:41:10,284
God, I'm such a bitch! I'm sorry!
I was so crazy mad.

1326
01:41:10,462 --> 01:41:11,895
I hope you can forgive me.

1327
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:16,023
Oh, you know what, it's not too late.
You can still be a bridesmaid with Sharon.

1328
01:41:16,869 --> 01:41:18,496
- Okay.
- Okay?

1329
01:41:19,204 --> 01:41:21,138
Can I ask you a favor?

1330
01:41:22,341 --> 01:41:25,504
- I want to make your wedding shoes.
- My shoes?

1331
01:41:25,677 --> 01:41:27,611
What'd you turn into, Geppetto?

1332
01:41:27,779 --> 01:41:30,680
Oh, my God! These are gorgeous!

1333
01:41:30,848 --> 01:41:35,080
I've been taking a class. It just happened
out of the blue. I really love it.

1334
01:41:35,253 --> 01:41:36,720
Oh, my God!

1335
01:41:37,221 --> 01:41:38,813
They're one-of-a-kind.

1336
01:41:38,990 --> 01:41:41,390
You'll be the only bride in history
to wear them.

1337
01:41:41,559 --> 01:41:42,547
Love that!

1338
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:45,855
Oh, God, Holly!

1339
01:41:46,029 --> 01:41:48,395
This is like shoe art.

1340
01:41:48,565 --> 01:41:52,467
They're gorgeous! We have to
show these to someone.

1341
01:41:55,439 --> 01:41:57,532
I feel like Gerry's guiding me.

1342
01:41:57,708 --> 01:42:01,370
I mean, shoes! I love shoes but I never
thought about it.

1343
01:42:01,544 --> 01:42:02,875
You look so great.

1344
01:42:03,045 --> 01:42:04,342
Thanks.

1345
01:42:04,513 --> 01:42:07,107
- Course, I look great too, right? Ha-ha.
- Yes.

1346
01:42:07,283 --> 01:42:10,844
When all this started happening,
you're the first person I wanted to tell.

1347
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:12,248
Isn't that funny?

1348
01:42:12,421 --> 01:42:16,050
That's hilarious. Any way we can stretch
this lunch out into a dinner?

1349
01:42:17,058 --> 01:42:18,753
I'm going to change the subject.

1350
01:42:20,528 --> 01:42:23,895
- How are you?
- I'm good. Things are good.

1351
01:42:24,699 --> 01:42:28,567
I've got some, some ideas for the future,
some possible business prospects.

1352
01:42:28,737 --> 01:42:30,500
I think about you all the time.

1353
01:42:32,907 --> 01:42:34,999
That's a little too much information,
I guess.

1354
01:42:35,175 --> 01:42:36,199
Yes.

1355
01:42:36,376 --> 01:42:38,037
But you did say you were
thinking about me.

1356
01:42:38,579 --> 01:42:41,104
Because you've been a real friend
through this all.

1357
01:42:42,182 --> 01:42:45,811
So, you haven't thought about me
in the nude?

1358
01:42:46,286 --> 01:42:47,583
No.

1359
01:42:48,088 --> 01:42:49,385
- Not once?
- No.

1360
01:42:49,556 --> 01:42:51,819
- Not even without my shirt?
- Gerry, stop it!

1361
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:54,784
Daniel.

1362
01:43:01,134 --> 01:43:02,396
I'm Daniel.

1363
01:43:05,271 --> 01:43:06,329
Sorry.

1364
01:43:09,775 --> 01:43:12,767
You think you'll ever feel about
somebody the way you felt about Gerry...

1365
01:43:12,978 --> 01:43:15,640
...or do you have to wait for a letter
to figure that out?

1366
01:43:18,049 --> 01:43:19,311
Where you going?

1367
01:43:24,321 --> 01:43:25,879
I really like you...

1368
01:43:27,224 --> 01:43:30,125
...but I can't be the invisible man.

1369
01:43:31,228 --> 01:43:33,628
I'm tired of being the shoulder.

1370
01:43:35,733 --> 01:43:40,500
I want to be another body part you need,
you know? I wanna be...

1371
01:43:40,671 --> 01:43:43,468
...the bad guy.
I want a woman to go crazy over me...

1372
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:48,134
...and then I wanna use her up
until she's ruined for all other men.

1373
01:43:48,311 --> 01:43:52,771
- You don't wanna do that.
- No, I don't wanna do that, but I would...

1374
01:43:54,784 --> 01:43:58,241
I'd like to date a woman
who actually likes men.

1375
01:44:04,927 --> 01:44:07,122
I'd like to be somebody's Gerry.

1376
01:44:17,772 --> 01:44:22,209
It's all right.
Honestly, it's not your fault, it's mine.

1377
01:44:24,512 --> 01:44:27,413
I didn't plan on feeling something
for you, it just sort of happened.

1378
01:44:27,582 --> 01:44:28,981
So I'm sorry about that.

1379
01:44:37,958 --> 01:44:39,550
Is your guest coming back?

1380
01:44:40,894 --> 01:44:43,556
- No.
- Just you on your own, then?

1381
01:46:11,179 --> 01:46:12,510
Take a break, will you?

1382
01:46:14,281 --> 01:46:16,613
- Mom!
- What's the matter?

1383
01:46:24,491 --> 01:46:26,118
Come on.

1384
01:46:26,994 --> 01:46:28,621
Come on.

1385
01:46:29,096 --> 01:46:30,960
What happened?

1386
01:46:32,231 --> 01:46:35,564
When... When Daddy left...

1387
01:46:36,402 --> 01:46:39,496
...I was 14 and I said:

1388
01:46:39,706 --> 01:46:43,198
"That's it, never again. No man... "

1389
01:46:45,311 --> 01:46:46,835
And then I meet Gerry.

1390
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:56,914
This wonderful man happens to me
and then... And then...

1391
01:46:57,089 --> 01:46:58,954
And then he died!

1392
01:46:59,124 --> 01:47:00,955
- What was the point?
- I know, honey.

1393
01:47:01,126 --> 01:47:03,822
I'm so angry I could kill somebody!

1394
01:47:03,996 --> 01:47:05,963
I'm alone and...

1395
01:47:06,263 --> 01:47:09,994
...it doesn't matter what job I have,
or what I do or what I don't do...

1396
01:47:10,167 --> 01:47:12,567
...or what friends I have. He's not here.

1397
01:47:12,737 --> 01:47:15,968
I'm... I'm not here.

1398
01:47:16,741 --> 01:47:20,541
- I mean, you're alone no matter what.
- That's right.

1399
01:47:23,213 --> 01:47:27,411
You know, I didn't come here for you
to give me some bullshit honest answer.

1400
01:47:27,584 --> 01:47:29,745
Why can't you lie to me just once?

1401
01:47:29,919 --> 01:47:31,648
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1402
01:47:37,093 --> 01:47:41,495
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- Shh. Come on.

1403
01:47:42,931 --> 01:47:44,899
Let's go for a walk.

1404
01:47:46,802 --> 01:47:48,997
Your father and I used to come here.

1405
01:47:49,171 --> 01:47:50,536
They had dances.

1406
01:47:50,706 --> 01:47:52,640
Well, not really dances.

1407
01:47:52,808 --> 01:47:55,640
We'd come with radios and cigarettes...

1408
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:58,643
...and drink beer and listen to Jimi Hendrix.

1409
01:48:01,249 --> 01:48:05,481
I bet you've had a hard time walking into
a room full of people on your own, right?

1410
01:48:06,554 --> 01:48:08,385
Yeah, I know that.

1411
01:48:09,323 --> 01:48:13,725
I know what it is not to feel like you're
in the room until he looks at you...

1412
01:48:13,894 --> 01:48:18,058
...or touches your hand, or even makes
a joke at your expense...

1413
01:48:18,698 --> 01:48:21,166
...just to let everyone know
you're with him.

1414
01:48:21,935 --> 01:48:23,493
You're his.

1415
01:48:25,539 --> 01:48:27,598
God, that man could make me laugh.

1416
01:48:29,408 --> 01:48:30,739
Daddy?

1417
01:48:32,945 --> 01:48:35,175
I don't ever remember you laughing.

1418
01:48:38,918 --> 01:48:41,751
Well, that makes me sad...

1419
01:48:44,957 --> 01:48:46,890
...because I did.

1420
01:48:49,627 --> 01:48:51,356
I did.

1421
01:48:56,868 --> 01:49:00,304
Did you hate Gerry because
he reminded you of Dad?

1422
01:49:02,107 --> 01:49:03,801
A little.

1423
01:49:09,046 --> 01:49:13,540
You know the worst thing for a parent,
second after losing a child?

1424
01:49:15,085 --> 01:49:18,577
Watching your child head for
the same life you had...

1425
01:49:19,490 --> 01:49:21,548
...and you can't stop it.

1426
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:27,554
It's a terrible, helpless feeling.

1427
01:49:28,831 --> 01:49:31,129
Makes you angry all the time...

1428
01:49:32,568 --> 01:49:34,536
...and I've been angry...

1429
01:49:35,838 --> 01:49:38,169
...a very long time.

1430
01:49:41,309 --> 01:49:42,367
I'm exhausted.

1431
01:49:47,349 --> 01:49:49,374
Do you think we'll ever see Dad again?

1432
01:49:51,253 --> 01:49:53,016
No, sweetheart.

1433
01:49:54,255 --> 01:49:55,882
Never.

1434
01:49:59,193 --> 01:50:01,525
So you have to stop waiting.

1435
01:50:26,186 --> 01:50:27,346
You?

1436
01:50:29,988 --> 01:50:34,220
I have to say I was impressed by how
he worked everything out ahead of time...

1437
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:38,252
...every delivery schedule,
the mailbox key...

1438
01:50:39,731 --> 01:50:42,700
Getting that leather jacket out
of your apartment wasn't easy...

1439
01:50:42,868 --> 01:50:45,199
...with you acting like Miss Havisham.

1440
01:50:49,807 --> 01:50:51,536
He made me promise.

1441
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:54,205
I couldn't say no.

1442
01:50:54,912 --> 01:50:58,905
I told him I didn't think
it was good for you, but...

1443
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:01,415
...I couldn't say no.

1444
01:51:05,755 --> 01:51:07,382
It's the last one...

1445
01:51:12,362 --> 01:51:14,227
...so all alone or not...

1446
01:51:15,699 --> 01:51:17,564
...you gotta walk ahead.

1447
01:51:22,438 --> 01:51:24,497
Thing to remember is...

1448
01:51:25,241 --> 01:51:30,235
...if we're all alone,
then we're all together in that too.

1449
01:51:33,048 --> 01:51:35,516
It helps me sometimes.

1450
01:52:37,942 --> 01:52:40,502
<i>Hi, it's Daniel.</i>

1451
01:52:40,679 --> 01:52:44,978
<i>Remember what I said in the restaurant?
Well, please forget it word by word.</i>

1452
01:52:46,417 --> 01:52:48,783
<i>They're gonna build
a new Yankee stadium.</i>

1453
01:52:49,653 --> 01:52:53,020
<i>I don't know why I said that.
I'm making small talk. I hate small talk.</i>

1454
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:57,627
<i>I hate the people who make small talk.
I should... I should stop. I'm stopping.</i>

1455
01:52:57,795 --> 01:52:58,784
<i>Shit!</i>

1456
01:53:10,306 --> 01:53:11,898
Gerry?

1457
01:53:17,446 --> 01:53:20,279
My uncle can get us in anytime we want.

1458
01:53:20,949 --> 01:53:23,110
He turned the lights on for us.

1459
01:53:25,721 --> 01:53:27,552
It's amazing...

1460
01:53:55,081 --> 01:53:56,446
You sure?

1461
01:53:58,485 --> 01:54:00,214
It's okay.

1462
01:54:01,921 --> 01:54:05,482
"Dear Holly, I don't have much time.

1463
01:54:05,892 --> 01:54:10,828
I don't mean literally, I mean, you're out
buying ice cream and you'll be home soon...

1464
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:13,755
...but I have a feeling
this is the last letter.

1465
01:54:13,932 --> 01:54:16,526
Because there's only one thing
left to tell you.

1466
01:54:17,102 --> 01:54:20,162
It isn't to go down memory lane
or make you buy a lamp.

1467
01:54:20,339 --> 01:54:23,502
You can take care of yourself
without any help from me.

1468
01:54:24,643 --> 01:54:29,511
It's to tell you how much you move me.
How you changed me.

1469
01:54:30,281 --> 01:54:33,614
You made me a man
by loving me, Holly...

1470
01:54:33,785 --> 01:54:37,380
...and for that I am eternally grateful.

1471
01:54:37,555 --> 01:54:38,954
Literally.

1472
01:54:40,191 --> 01:54:44,524
If you can promise me anything,
promise me that whenever you're sad...

1473
01:54:44,694 --> 01:54:46,093
<i>:::or unsure:::</i>

1474
01:54:46,763 --> 01:54:49,095
...or you lose complete faith...

1475
01:54:49,866 --> 01:54:52,801
...that you'll try and see yourself
through my eyes.

1476
01:54:53,303 --> 01:54:56,204
Thank you for the honor
of being my wife.

1477
01:54:56,406 --> 01:54:58,704
I'm a man with no regrets.

1478
01:54:58,875 --> 01:55:00,398
How lucky am I?

1479
01:55:01,777 --> 01:55:06,441
You made my life, Holly,
but I'm just one chapter in yours.

1480
01:55:06,816 --> 01:55:08,579
There'll be more.

1481
01:55:09,051 --> 01:55:10,541
I promise.

1482
01:55:11,554 --> 01:55:14,614
So here it comes, the big one.

1483
01:55:16,558 --> 01:55:18,651
Don't be afraid to fall in love again.

1484
01:55:20,261 --> 01:55:24,061
Watch out for that signal
when life as you know it ends.

1485
01:55:26,367 --> 01:55:30,804
P.S., I will always love you. "

1486
01:55:51,290 --> 01:55:53,690
Have you thought about this?

1487
01:55:54,861 --> 01:55:57,091
About me, I mean?

1488
01:55:59,265 --> 01:56:00,926
Have you?

1489
01:56:04,003 --> 01:56:05,630
Yeah.

1490
01:56:31,328 --> 01:56:33,592
- This isn't gonna work, is it?
- No way, no how!

1491
01:56:33,764 --> 01:56:34,924
- Damn!
- Oh!

1492
01:56:37,167 --> 01:56:38,794
Oh, wow.

1493
01:56:39,203 --> 01:56:41,693
I mean, that was like kissing my sister.

1494
01:56:41,871 --> 01:56:44,533
- I'm so relieved!
- Ha-ha-ha.

1495
01:56:44,707 --> 01:56:48,268
I got this letter and I thought he must
have been feeling self-sacrificing...

1496
01:56:48,444 --> 01:56:51,436
...but he's really full of crap.
If he meant it, he'd give me a sign.

1497
01:56:51,614 --> 01:56:54,845
- I hate signs.
- Then I got your message on the machine.

1498
01:57:01,390 --> 01:57:04,120
Weird, bitter friends?

1499
01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:07,657
Forever.

1500
01:57:19,774 --> 01:57:21,537
What's wrong, friend?

1501
01:57:21,709 --> 01:57:23,677
It's Gerry.

1502
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:27,511
It's been a year...

1503
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:32,716
...and I don't feel him
around me anymore.

1504
01:57:34,721 --> 01:57:37,019
I don't think he's here anymore.

1505
01:57:39,526 --> 01:57:41,721
I think Gerry's gone.

1506
01:57:43,263 --> 01:57:44,890
He's really gone.

1507
01:58:04,149 --> 01:58:06,582
<i>Dear Gerry, you said you wanted me...</i>

1508
01:58:06,751 --> 01:58:08,184
<i>...to fall in love again...</i>

1509
01:58:08,353 --> 01:58:12,756
<i>...and maybe one day I will,
but there are all kinds of love out there.</i>

1510
01:58:13,958 --> 01:58:15,755
<i>This is my one and only life...</i>

1511
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:19,618
<i>...and it's a great and terrible
and short and endless thing...</i>

1512
01:58:19,797 --> 01:58:22,594
<i>...and none of us come out of it alive.</i>

1513
01:58:32,442 --> 01:58:37,072
<i>I don't have a plan except
that it's time my mom laughed again.</i>

1514
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:39,111
<i>She's never seen the world.</i>

1515
01:58:39,282 --> 01:58:45,277
<i>She's never seen Ireland, so I'm
taking her back to where we started.</i>

1516
01:58:51,527 --> 01:58:53,893
<i>Maybe now she'll understand.</i>

1517
01:59:02,437 --> 01:59:03,631
Mom?

1518
01:59:19,219 --> 01:59:20,413
William?

1519
01:59:22,322 --> 01:59:23,516
Hello, you.

1520
01:59:26,827 --> 01:59:28,192
You back for another visit?

1521
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:30,826
How long?

1522
01:59:31,898 --> 01:59:33,456
I don't know.

1523
01:59:35,768 --> 01:59:38,134
Oh, um... This is my mom, Patricia.

1524
01:59:38,571 --> 01:59:40,436
Hello. This is me father, Patsy.

1525
01:59:44,677 --> 01:59:46,542
You've dropped your sweets, luv.

1526
01:59:46,713 --> 01:59:48,703
Mustn't do that around these parts.

1527
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:52,475
Pretty woman like you,
a fella could take it the wrong way.

1528
02:00:10,468 --> 02:00:12,026
So I'll see you around, then?

1529
02:00:13,104 --> 02:00:14,537
Yeah.

1530
02:00:21,343 --> 02:00:25,245
<i>I don't know how you did it,
but you brought me back from the dead.</i>

1531
02:00:25,414 --> 02:00:27,439
<i>I'll write to you again soon.</i>

1532
02:00:27,616 --> 02:00:29,481
<i>P. S...</i>

1533
02:00:29,651 --> 02:00:31,312
<i>Guess what.</i>

1534
02:00:32,305 --> 02:01:32,802
