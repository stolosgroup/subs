<i>Some days,
my childhood feels so very far away.</i>

3
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:22,342
<i>And others,</i>

4
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:25,592
<i>I can almost see it.</i>

5
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:28,175
<i>The magical land of my youth,</i>

6
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:33,633
<i>like a beautiful dream of when the
whole world felt like a promise</i>

7
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:38,258
<i>and the lessons that lay ahead
yet unseen.</i>

8
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:41,967
<i>Looking back,
I wish I'd listened.</i>

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,717
<i>Wish I'd watched more closely</i>

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,842
<i>and understood.</i>

11
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>But sometimes you can't see
what you're learning</i>

12
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,508
<i>until you come out
the other side.</i>

14
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:44,342
Come on!

15
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,467
Come on!

16
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:10,133
Come on!

17
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:47,758
I'm gonna miss out.

18
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:52,842
I've seen this contest

19
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:56,467
humble even the most
seasoned warriors, Diana.

20
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,258
I can do it.

21
00:02:59,175 --> 00:03:01,342
Just do your best.

22
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,758
And remember,

23
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:05,758
greatness is not
what you think.

24
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:07,800
Pace yourself and watch.

25
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:19,342
No!

26
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,008
No!

27
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:30,467
That's not fair!

28
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:32,342
No.

29
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:34,217
No. But...

30
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,508
- You took the short path.
- But...

31
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:38,133
- You cheated, Diana.
- No.

32
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:39,175
But that...

33
00:09:39,258 --> 00:09:41,633
That is the truth.

34
00:09:41,717 --> 00:09:43,175
That is the only truth,

35
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,342
and truth is all there is.

36
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:46,800
But I would've won,
if you didn't...

37
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:48,842
But you didn't.

38
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:53,092
You cannot be the winner,
because you are not ready to win,

39
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,133
and there is no shame in that.

40
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:59,883
Only in knowing
the truth in your heart

41
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,217
and not accepting it.

42
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,842
No true hero is born from lies.

43
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:13,550
Your time will come, Diana.

44
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15,383
When?

45
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:18,967
When you're ready.

46
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22,508
Look to the
Golden Warrior Asteria.

47
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:27,217
She did not become a legend
out of haste.

48
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,092
She did it through
true acts of bravery.

49
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:34,467
Like patience, diligence,

50
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,800
and the courage
to face the truth.

51
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,717
One day, you'll become
all that you dream of and more,

52
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,508
and everything
will be different.

53
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:56,883
This world is not yet ready
for all that you will do.

54
00:11:20,342 --> 00:11:22,883
<i>Welcome to the future.</i>

55
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:26,092
<i>Life is good,
but it can be better.</i>

56
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:27,758
<i>And why shouldn't it be?</i>

57
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:29,425
<i>Everything we've
ever dreamed about</i>

58
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:31,425
<i>is right at our fingertips.</i>

59
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:34,175
<i>But are you
reaping the rewards?</i>

60
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:35,342
<i>Do you...</i>

61
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:36,883
<i>...have it all?</i>

62
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:43,217
Slow down, dude.

63
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,342
No way.

64
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,925
Dude!

65
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:02,008
<i>Welcome to
Black Gold Cooperative.</i>

66
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:03,883
- Oh, my gosh. Guys!
- <i>The first oil company</i>

67
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,217
<i>run for the people,
by the people.</i>

68
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,717
<i>Think about finally having</i>

69
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,925
<i>everything you've
always wished for.</i>

70
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:11,092
Let's go!

71
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:12,675
Hey!

72
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:16,008
<i>For a low monthly fee,</i>

73
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:17,758
<i>you can own a piece</i>

74
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:20,800
<i>of the most lucrative industry
in the world.</i>

75
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:23,175
<i>And every time we strike gold,</i>

76
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:25,133
- <i>you strike gold.</i>
- Oh!

77
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:36,842
<i>No matter who you
are, no matter what you do,</i>

78
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:39,758
<i>you deserve to have it all.</i>

79
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,217
<i>Do you have everything
you've ever wanted?</i>

80
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,675
<i>Aren't you tired of
always wishing you had more?</i>

81
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:49,092
- Hey, move it. It's my turn.
- <i>Join me today.</i>

82
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:51,133
- Yes!
- <i>Operators are standing by.</i>

83
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:55,383
<i>You don't need a pile of money or
some business degree to get started.</i>

84
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,550
<i>You don't even have
to work hard for it.</i>

85
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,550
Good morning.

86
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,342
- Good morning.
- Don't even think about it.

87
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:04,467
<i>At Black Gold
Cooperative, all you need</i>

88
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,217
<i>is to want it!</i>

89
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:13,050
We get what we want,
and we go.

90
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,592
- What do you want?
- None of this junk.

91
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,550
Word is on the street

92
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:20,050
you got a nice little black market
side business going on back there.

93
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,092
If you don't tell,
we won't tell.

94
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:27,425
Yes, yes, yes!

95
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,008
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

96
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,633
Yes, yes, yes!

97
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,883
Sir, are you all right?

98
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:54,758
Gun!

99
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:56,425
He's got a gun!

100
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:59,675
Shut up! Please!

101
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:01,258
Come on, dude. Can't hide.
Let's get out of here!

102
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,092
Stop! Mall Security!

103
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,842
No, no, you, you, right there!

104
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:06,925
Right there! Freeze. Stop!

105
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:08,217
Move, move, move!

106
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,425
Chief, they're running up
the escalator.

107
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,800
Hey! Stop! Freeze!

108
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:13,425
Freeze!

109
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:14,883
No!

110
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,342
We have several
armed assailants running free.

111
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,425
We need the police here,
right now.

112
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:25,925
Freeze!

113
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:26,967
Freeze!

114
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:29,842
Freeze! Freeze!

115
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:32,050
Whoa, whoa! Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

116
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:33,592
No. Dude, dude, calm...

117
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:35,342
- Get back, man. I'll do it!
- Hey!

118
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:36,675
Hey, what are you doing?

119
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:38,133
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

120
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:39,425
What are you doing?

121
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,842
Hey, what are you doing?

122
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:43,592
- I'm not going back!
- No, no, no!

123
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,133
Just chill out.
Just chill.

124
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:48,383
- Stand back!
- Don't do it!

125
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,175
No, no, no!

126
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:52,092
Put the kid back.

127
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:53,592
Listen to me.

128
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,967
Listen to me!

129
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,300
- No!
- What are you doing?

130
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:59,800
Pull her back.
Pull her back in!

131
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:01,133
I'm not going back!

132
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:02,342
No!

133
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:03,508
Gonna let her go!

134
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:05,092
- No, no, no!
- No, no!

135
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,258
What? Who? What?

136
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,758
We won't be doing that today.

137
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,217
Whoa.

138
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,717
We... We... We should go...

139
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,383
Oh, my gosh!

140
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:00,217
Hold tight.

141
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:12,550
I hate guns.

142
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:14,300
We've got to go now. Come on.

143
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:45,008
Yo.

144
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:48,258
I'm sorry, lady.

145
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,092
- Shh.
- I'm sorry. Okay?

146
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,217
It was his idea.

147
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:03,800
<i>And the
authorities still have questions.</i>

148
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:06,467
<i>In fact, the first is
a real doozy, which is,</i>

149
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,383
<i>who exactly
even stopped this crime?</i>

150
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:11,967
If the story around here
is to be believed,

151
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,925
it wasn't the police,

152
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:16,967
but a mysterious female savior

153
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,633
that multiple witnesses saw.

154
00:17:18,717 --> 00:17:21,592
<i>If this sounds familiar,
it should.</i>

155
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:25,050
<i>We've now had more than
a half-dozen similar sightings</i>

156
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:28,592
<i>across the greater D.C. area
in the last year.</i>

157
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:31,633
<i>Which, of course,
begs the biggest question of today,</i>

158
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,800
<i>who is this woman</i>

159
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:36,258
<i>and where did she come from?</i>

160
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,550
Excuse me.
Are you waiting for someone?

161
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,842
No. Just me.

162
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:17,383
Taxi!

163
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:26,092
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

164
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:28,758
Hey, we could share,
if you like?

165
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:31,217
No, thanks. I'll wait.

166
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:16,967
Oh, my.

167
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:22,133
- Yeah.
- Hey, Jake.

168
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:23,842
Jake, hi. Can you...

169
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:31,967
Hi. I know, walk much?
The latch of my...

170
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:36,800
Good morning.

171
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:39,050
Hi. Thank you.

172
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:42,800
Diana Prince,
cultural anthropology and archaeology.

173
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:45,508
Barbara Minerva.
Geology, gemology, lithology,

174
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,133
and part-time cryptozoologist.

175
00:20:47,217 --> 00:20:48,008
Oh, wow.

176
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:50,217
I kept busy in college.

177
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:55,883
Sorry. It's these heels,
you know. It's stupid.

178
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,258
I don't know why I was gonna wear heels.
Scientists don't wear heels.

179
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,925
- Sometimes we do.
- Right.

180
00:21:01,008 --> 00:21:03,050
- Right. Those are cool!
- Have a nice day.

181
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:04,217
I like those.

182
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,592
Animal print.

183
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:08,175
Do you want to get lunch?

184
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:09,717
I, uh...

185
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,258
Not now, obviously.

186
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:14,050
It's morning.
But later today, or whenever.

187
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:16,175
Like, around...
Like, at lunchtime?

188
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:17,925
I have a lot of work today.

189
00:21:18,008 --> 00:21:20,258
- But maybe some other time?
- Oh.

190
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:23,008
- Yeah, I'm busy today, too.
- Great.

191
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:27,008
Ah! Diana, do you happen to
know who a Barbara Minerva is?

192
00:21:27,092 --> 00:21:28,800
Oh, hi, Carol. Hi.

193
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:32,008
It's me. I'm Barbara.
Remember? You hired me.

194
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:34,383
- Started last week.
- Oh!

195
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:35,758
Gemologist?

196
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:37,425
Yes. And zoologist.

197
00:21:37,508 --> 00:21:39,508
- We had a couple interviews.
- Yeah.

198
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:43,008
Well, the FBI are gonna drop off
some artifacts later this afternoon.

199
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:44,383
The FBI?

200
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:46,300
- Yeah. Yes.
- They're coming here?

201
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:47,883
The mall heist yesterday,

202
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:50,050
apparently they were using
a jewelry store as a front.

203
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:51,842
Front for what?

204
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:54,758
Black market. Stolen jewels and
art meant for private buyers.

205
00:21:54,842 --> 00:21:57,008
But we could use your help
identifying one in particular.

206
00:21:57,092 --> 00:21:59,883
My help?
Yeah, I'll help the FBI

207
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:01,717
with whatever they need.

208
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,925
Is that a yes?

209
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,258
Yes. I would, um...

210
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:06,342
- I would love to assist you.
- Wonderful.

211
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,550
It's nice to meet you.

212
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:10,258
We've met.

213
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,258
Have a nice day.

214
00:22:13,342 --> 00:22:14,633
Bye, Diana.

215
00:22:16,842 --> 00:22:20,925
Okay, item number 23.

216
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,842
Shoot. That's not it.

217
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:30,800
Oh, the Empress of Siam.

218
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:34,800
Originally found in the wreck
of the <i>Nuestra Senora de Atocha.</i>

219
00:22:35,508 --> 00:22:36,592
Wow.

220
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:40,092
Sorry. I couldn't resist
coming to see.

221
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:42,050
Oh, it's okay.

222
00:22:43,092 --> 00:22:44,092
Here it is.

223
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:46,592
- What is it?
- Um...

224
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,967
Uh...

225
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:51,675
I can't tell.

226
00:22:54,217 --> 00:22:55,925
Some light.

227
00:22:58,258 --> 00:23:03,008
I think the technical term here
is "extremely lame."

228
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:05,092
Um...

229
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,550
It's... It's citrine.

230
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:11,425
A classic stone used in fakes
throughout history.

231
00:23:11,508 --> 00:23:15,300
I can't imagine this is worth
any more than $75.

232
00:23:15,383 --> 00:23:16,592
What do you think?

233
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:19,258
Fakes aren't my forte,
but let me see.

234
00:23:20,092 --> 00:23:21,133
Mmm.

235
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:22,508
Latin.

236
00:23:22,592 --> 00:23:24,300
At least
it's an antique, right?

237
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:27,300
Or a purchase from a stall
on the Ponte Vecchio last week.

238
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:29,633
- Mmm-hmm.
- You never know.

239
00:23:29,717 --> 00:23:33,133
"Place upon the object held

240
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:34,925
but one great wish."

241
00:23:35,008 --> 00:23:36,300
You read Latin?

242
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:39,342
Yeah. Yeah.
Languages are a hobby.

243
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:41,342
So maybe it's, like,
a lucky charm or something?

244
00:23:41,425 --> 00:23:42,717
Yeah, I guess.

245
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,050
Strange.

246
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,050
I really wish I had a coffee.

247
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,842
You're funny.

248
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:50,383
Hey, I got Erika a coffee, but she's
out sick. Does anybody want this?

249
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:53,050
What?
Yeah, I'll take one.

250
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:54,800
Ooh, hot!

251
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:55,925
Hot, hot!

252
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:57,425
Did you see that?

253
00:23:59,883 --> 00:24:01,050
Oh...

254
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:03,883
Can you imagine?

255
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:06,175
- If only.
- Hmm.

256
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,675
So many things,
I don't even know what I would wish for.

257
00:24:16,217 --> 00:24:18,258
I do.

258
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,967
Well, um, anyway,
sorry to bother you.

259
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,550
If you need anything,
I'm around.

260
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,092
- Oh, yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah.

261
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,800
But thank you for...

262
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:31,800
That's okay. It's my job.

263
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:33,842
And I'll look into it more
when I have a chance.

264
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:34,883
Okay.

265
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:37,675
Well, thanks for...

266
00:24:37,758 --> 00:24:40,342
talking to me.

267
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:42,425
I'm... I'm sorry, uh...

268
00:24:43,092 --> 00:24:45,175
I mean, I'm fine.

269
00:24:45,258 --> 00:24:47,383
You know, we could go
and grab early dinner

270
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:52,508
and talk about exactly
how lame that stone is.

271
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:53,592
Really?

272
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:55,217
Yeah, I mean, citrine?

273
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,508
Who are they kidding, right?

274
00:24:57,592 --> 00:24:58,967
- So lame.
- Dorky.

275
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,383
- Lame.
- Yeah, let's go.

276
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,967
That's, like,
the lamest of lames.

277
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:34,633
Wow. You're so funny.

278
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:36,842
- Oh. Thank you.
- Wow.

279
00:25:36,925 --> 00:25:40,675
I mean, no one's made me laugh
like this in such a long time.

280
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:43,050
I mean, it's true,
I don't get out much socially.

281
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,800
You don't get out much?

282
00:25:44,883 --> 00:25:46,050
No, not really.

283
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:47,717
- No.
- I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.

284
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,133
Because you just seem like
the kind of person

285
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:51,633
who's, like, always out.

286
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,675
Like, people are asking you
to go out all the time

287
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:55,967
and you live out.
You're just out.

288
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,550
Like, you never get in.

289
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:01,342
You just seem
like you'd be really popular.

290
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:03,467
And I would know because
I've never been popular.

291
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,633
You haven't?

292
00:26:04,717 --> 00:26:06,133
You're so personable.

293
00:26:06,217 --> 00:26:09,258
So... free.

294
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:12,842
I mean, honestly,
I gotta say that I envy that.

295
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:14,133
What?

296
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:16,967
You envy me?
That doesn't make any sense.

297
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,050
Oh, my gosh.

298
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:21,258
People think I'm weird.
They avoid me

299
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:24,175
and talk behind my back when
they don't think I can hear them.

300
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:26,300
I'm like, "Guys,
I can hear you."

301
00:26:30,383 --> 00:26:32,592
Barbara, my life

302
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:35,967
hasn't been
what you probably think it has.

303
00:26:37,217 --> 00:26:39,342
We all have our struggles.

304
00:26:39,425 --> 00:26:40,425
Yeah, we do.

305
00:26:42,758 --> 00:26:44,217
Have you ever been in love?

306
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:48,717
Uh... Yeah.

307
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,383
- A long, long time ago.
- Mmm.

308
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:52,550
You?

309
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:54,842
So many times, yeah.
All the time.

310
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:56,550
Often.

311
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:57,842
So what happened?

312
00:26:57,925 --> 00:27:00,008
Where'd he go, your guy?

313
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:01,717
He, uh...

314
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:04,342
He died.

315
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:10,050
But I still think sometimes that
I see him up there in the sky.

316
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,217
He was a pilot.

317
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,425
- Oh!
- He was all kinds of things,

318
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:18,050
but he was great. It was true.

319
00:27:19,758 --> 00:27:21,717
I get it.

320
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,050
Well, cheers to us.

321
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:27,383
Wishing us better luck,
I guess.

322
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,925
Hey, Leon.

323
00:27:36,008 --> 00:27:37,550
Hey there, Barbara. Late night?

324
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:39,133
Yeah. Going back to work.

325
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:41,300
I wanted to bring this to you
while it was still hot.

326
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:44,217
- Oh, you're too good to me.
- It's not a problem.

327
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,717
Stay warm.

328
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:57,925
Hey there, sweetheart.
You need some help?

329
00:27:58,008 --> 00:27:59,383
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

330
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:01,925
'Cause, uh,

331
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:04,883
you know, you look as though you're
having a little bit of trouble

332
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:06,175
walking in those heels, huh?

333
00:28:06,258 --> 00:28:07,550
It's okay. I wear
these heels all the time.

334
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:09,383
Hey, come on.
Let me walk you home.

335
00:28:09,467 --> 00:28:12,008
- I'm not going home.
- Hey, I'm just trying to be nice here.

336
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:14,467
Huh? Come on.

337
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:18,425
Hey, hey. Hey, hey!

338
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:20,008
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey!

339
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:21,592
Let go of me!

340
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:23,008
- I'm just trying to help you!
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

341
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:25,550
Let go!

342
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,467
Forgot my keys. Lucky.

343
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,300
- How did you...
- Simple self-defense.

344
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:45,633
Used his own momentum against him.
I'll teach you.

345
00:28:45,717 --> 00:28:48,050
Honestly, it takes
no power at all.

346
00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:50,383
Are you okay?

347
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:52,967
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good.

348
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,508
- Thank you.
- Of course.

349
00:28:54,592 --> 00:28:55,758
Go home, okay?

350
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:57,717
- Yeah.
- Good night.

351
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:39,217
I do know what I'd wish for.

352
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:44,300
To be like Diana.

353
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:49,175
Strong, sexy,

354
00:29:49,258 --> 00:29:51,217
cool.

355
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:56,467
Special.

356
00:30:57,175 --> 00:30:58,133
Oh...

357
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:30,717
Oh, no! Oh!

358
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,092
Sorry.

359
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,467
Oh, it's okay.

360
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,050
Barbara, thank God
you're good in heels.

361
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:37,717
Oh.

362
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,300
- Hey, Barbara.
- Hi, Jake.

363
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:43,300
Wow. Looking good.

364
00:31:43,383 --> 00:31:45,467
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

365
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,592
This is our
Earth Sciences lab.

366
00:31:49,258 --> 00:31:50,550
Oh, Barbara!

367
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:51,717
Hi.

368
00:31:52,842 --> 00:31:53,967
Perfect.

369
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,592
I have someone
I would like you to meet.

370
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:58,175
- A pleasure, Ms. Minerva.
- Oh.

371
00:31:58,258 --> 00:32:01,050
Uh,
it's "Doctor," actually.

372
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:03,342
Um... Have we met before?
You look familiar.

373
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:06,050
- Do the thing. Do the thing.
- No.

374
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:09,258
Life is good,
but it can be better.

375
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:11,925
Oh, my gosh. From TV.

376
00:32:12,008 --> 00:32:13,633
Oh, my gosh.
You're the oil guy.

377
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:16,133
- "The oil guy." I'll take it.
- That's right.

378
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,383
Mr. Lord is considering

379
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:21,925
becoming a Friend of the
Smithsonian at the Partner level.

380
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:23,842
- Oh.
- Which entitles him to a handful

381
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:25,050
of private tours
of our facilities,

382
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:27,633
and he asked for you by name.

383
00:32:27,717 --> 00:32:30,342
- Me?
- Well, what can I say, Doctor?

384
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:32,175
Your reputation precedes you.

385
00:32:32,258 --> 00:32:36,133
And apparently we share
a passion for gemology.

386
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:39,008
- Wow, okay. We do.
- I'll leave you to it.

387
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:40,633
Uh...

388
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:43,300
Oh, let me just drop this off
in my office,

389
00:32:43,383 --> 00:32:45,258
and we'll go.

390
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,508
Oh! Oh, gosh. Don't look in there.
It's such a mess.

391
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:14,675
So, I thought maybe
we could start upstairs.

392
00:33:19,425 --> 00:33:21,425
I love that ruby.

393
00:33:21,508 --> 00:33:22,758
Oh, no. Be careful with that.

394
00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:24,425
- What?
- That's very...

395
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:28,717
Hey, have you seen
my friend? Where'd he go?

396
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,092
- I'm right here.
- You are.

397
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,800
Thank God.

398
00:33:31,883 --> 00:33:33,217
Oh, wait. You've got
a little dust on you.

399
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,592
- Sorry.
- Hey, good morning.

400
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:35,592
Oh, hi.

401
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:37,050
- Hi.
- Oh! Uh...

402
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:39,592
This is the one and only,

403
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:41,717
Mr. Maxwell Lord.

404
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:44,508
It's him.

405
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:47,092
Life is good,

406
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:49,592
but it can be better.

407
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:53,092
He's from TV.

408
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:54,425
Oh, I don't have a TV.

409
00:33:54,508 --> 00:33:56,092
Well, I have a great
relationship with Sears.

410
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:58,425
I can get you a brand-new TV
by the end of the day.

411
00:33:58,508 --> 00:34:00,175
Nineteen inches.

412
00:34:00,258 --> 00:34:02,633
- No strings attached.
- I'll stick to the one I don't have.

413
00:34:02,717 --> 00:34:04,258
But thank you.

414
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,300
Okay.

415
00:34:05,383 --> 00:34:08,050
You're so generous. Um...

416
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,842
Headline... Uh...

417
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:11,008
Mr. Lord

418
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:14,467
took a tour
of the entire Smithsonian

419
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,300
while considering partnership,

420
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:18,842
and guess
what he decided to do?

421
00:34:18,925 --> 00:34:20,842
Give his entire donation

422
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,008
to our department.

423
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:25,175
He's announcing it
at tonight's Members' Gala.

424
00:34:25,258 --> 00:34:26,675
It's going to be
an amazing party.

425
00:34:26,758 --> 00:34:29,050
I hope you have
something nice to wear.

426
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,175
I actually tend
to skip these events.

427
00:34:31,258 --> 00:34:35,133
I find that our benefactors with
a true eye towards philanthropy

428
00:34:35,217 --> 00:34:37,133
prefer to stay
out of the spotlight.

429
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:39,717
To let the museum's work
garner the attention.

430
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,967
I agree.

431
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,050
Except,

432
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:45,967
I like to party.

433
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,800
Oh, my gosh.
You're such a good dancer.

434
00:34:48,883 --> 00:34:50,092
- You like Latin dancing?
- I love it.

435
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:51,717
I know that
I'm a terrible dancer.

436
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,258
No, I doubt that
you're a terrible dancer...

437
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:55,008
No, I've got a hip injury
from high school.

438
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,050
...the shape that you're in.

439
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:57,550
Great, so,

440
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:59,883
- thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, yeah.

441
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:01,550
You know,
I really should be going.

442
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:02,800
Thank you for the tour.

443
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:06,175
I will have to see you tonight.

444
00:35:06,258 --> 00:35:08,425
See you tonight.

445
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:11,300
Bye. Have a good day.

446
00:35:12,383 --> 00:35:13,550
I'll find you.

447
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:18,217
What?

448
00:35:19,175 --> 00:35:21,342
I like him.

449
00:35:30,425 --> 00:35:31,758
Thank you, John.

450
00:35:36,758 --> 00:35:38,425
Ladies.

451
00:35:38,508 --> 00:35:40,467
Mr. Lord.

452
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,550
Mr. Lord.

453
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:43,383
Not now, Raquel.
My supplements?

454
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:47,342
On your desk,
but Mr. Lord.

455
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,842
Mr. Lord.

456
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:56,008
Mr. Lord.

457
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,217
Mr. Lord.

458
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,342
Mr. Lord.

459
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:23,342
Dad!

460
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:24,467
How?

461
00:36:25,175 --> 00:36:26,967
How!

462
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,508
It's your weekend.

463
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:30,592
Yes, clearly.

464
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:33,592
Alistair.

465
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:34,883
Where's the pool, Daddy?

466
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,842
It's not done yet, buddy.

467
00:36:36,925 --> 00:36:38,758
But it doesn't matter.

468
00:36:38,842 --> 00:36:40,633
You just have
to be patient.

469
00:36:40,717 --> 00:36:43,050
I told you the pool,

470
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:44,633
the helicopter,

471
00:36:44,717 --> 00:36:47,425
you'll have it all.
But remember,

472
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:50,425
Rome wasn't built in a day,
was it? No.

473
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,467
Hasn't it been
a lot of days?

474
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,467
Well, it takes time
to become a great, great,

475
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:58,800
number-one man,
like your dad is going to be.

476
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,300
Are you lying to your son,
like you lie to everyone else?

477
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:08,217
Simon.

478
00:37:09,717 --> 00:37:11,300
These offices aren't ready
for guests yet.

479
00:37:11,383 --> 00:37:13,758
It's over, Max.

480
00:37:13,842 --> 00:37:16,467
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I'm out.

481
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,050
Alistair, go wait with Raquel.

482
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:19,050
Simon.

483
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:22,467
I know it's hard
to see right now,

484
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,133
but we are finally right at the
edge of turning this thing around.

485
00:37:25,217 --> 00:37:27,050
"Turning it around"?

486
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:30,300
There is no oil.
There never was.

487
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:32,675
So how are you gonna
turn it around?

488
00:37:32,758 --> 00:37:35,675
Get more
sucker investors, like me?

489
00:37:35,758 --> 00:37:37,467
- It's called a Ponzi scheme.
- No!

490
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,758
I have a big...

491
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:42,092
There's something in the works.

492
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:43,967
And it's no scheme.

493
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,467
Simon, we have millions of acres
of potentially oil-rich land.

494
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,883
You have oil rights on land

495
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:53,008
that everyone else
passed on already.

496
00:37:53,092 --> 00:37:54,550
Now, it didn't take
much digging

497
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:55,925
to find that out.

498
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:58,050
I should have
done some digging on you, too,

499
00:37:58,133 --> 00:37:59,925
Maxwell Lorenzano.

500
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:03,175
Didn't take long to find out you're
nothing but a lowlife con man.

501
00:38:03,258 --> 00:38:05,633
I am not a con man!

502
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:12,050
I am a television personality.

503
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:13,550
And a respected businessman

504
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:15,050
- with a plan.
- Come on.

505
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:17,883
- With... With... With a great plan.
- Oh!

506
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:20,550
"If you can dream it,
you can have it."

507
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:22,550
Something like that?

508
00:38:23,883 --> 00:38:26,217
You have 48 hours

509
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,383
- to get my money...
- You're going to regret this.

510
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:31,592
...or the FTC gets an anonymous report.

511
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,758
- Loser.
- Simon, wait.

512
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:36,258
Simon, wait.

513
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:47,550
I am not a loser.

514
00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:51,050
He's a loser!

515
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:54,092
And don't you ever believe
a word that man said.

516
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:56,550
He's a liar...

517
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:58,925
and he's wrong.

518
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:05,133
And he will rue the day
he walked away from me.

519
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,425
And you...

520
00:39:16,675 --> 00:39:21,592
You are going to be so proud
to be my son.

521
00:39:23,342 --> 00:39:25,300
Okay.

522
00:39:29,925 --> 00:39:31,883
You'll see.

523
00:39:34,217 --> 00:39:36,092
Everyone will.

524
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,675
These are known
for a terrific fit.

525
00:40:22,758 --> 00:40:26,508
Yeah, I'm just
not so great with heels.

526
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:28,133
Just try them.

527
00:40:29,883 --> 00:40:32,675
Come out and show me.

528
00:40:32,758 --> 00:40:34,550
Okay. Hmm.

529
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:44,883
They do fit well.

530
00:40:44,967 --> 00:40:45,967
Ah.

531
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,133
Huh.

532
00:40:51,133 --> 00:40:53,633
- Yeah, I like it.
- You look

533
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,258
amazing.

534
00:40:55,342 --> 00:40:56,675
Do you think it's too tight?

535
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:59,175
I think it's just right.

536
00:40:59,258 --> 00:41:01,133
- Wow.
- Yeah.

537
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:04,217
I'll take it.

538
00:41:23,383 --> 00:41:25,175
Hey there. How are you doing?

539
00:41:53,342 --> 00:41:55,258
- Those shoes are incredible.
- Thank you.

540
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:58,008
- What a beautiful dress.
- You look fantastic.

541
00:41:58,092 --> 00:41:59,842
Thank you so much.

542
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:10,508
Dr. Minerva.

543
00:42:12,508 --> 00:42:16,133
You look breathtaking.

544
00:42:17,008 --> 00:42:18,758
Thank you.

545
00:42:18,842 --> 00:42:22,550
I... You know, we have to go to
these sort of things for work a lot,

546
00:42:22,633 --> 00:42:25,050
so I've probably worn this
dress a million times.

547
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:26,217
Mmm.

548
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,467
Um...

549
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,467
- Actually, no.
- I...

550
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,425
I just bought this today.

551
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,133
I never look like this.
Um, not even close.

552
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:37,717
Took me a long time
to get ready.

553
00:42:41,883 --> 00:42:43,925
Biotin.

554
00:42:44,717 --> 00:42:46,258
You should try it.

555
00:42:46,342 --> 00:42:48,800
Makes you glow like a teenager.

556
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:50,133
Reverses the clock.

557
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:53,258
Never accept
the limitations of nature.

558
00:42:53,342 --> 00:42:54,633
Yeah, no.

559
00:42:54,717 --> 00:42:57,050
Especially not
a beautiful woman like you.

560
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:58,300
Oh...

561
00:43:01,508 --> 00:43:03,842
God, it's so loud in here.

562
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:05,217
Yeah.

563
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,342
Can we go somewhere?

564
00:43:08,425 --> 00:43:10,508
- Just me and you?
- Yes.

565
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,842
Hmm... Your office?

566
00:43:25,342 --> 00:43:30,675
Oh, wow! Look at all
of this stuff. It's so...

567
00:43:30,758 --> 00:43:32,967
It's so beautiful.

568
00:43:34,592 --> 00:43:36,550
Like you.

569
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:44,092
What is that?

570
00:43:44,175 --> 00:43:45,342
Um...

571
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:48,383
Uh, it's nothing special,
really.

572
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:52,508
But the FBI did ask me
to help them identify it.

573
00:43:52,592 --> 00:43:54,050
Wow.

574
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:55,592
Though it certainly
has me stumped so far.

575
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,508
Let me help you.

576
00:43:57,592 --> 00:44:00,550
Max is here. No need to be
stumped ever again.

577
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:03,425
I have a dear friend
in Roman antiquities.

578
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:06,175
- Roman antiquities.
- Could give it a look, if you like?

579
00:44:08,633 --> 00:44:10,925
It is Latin, isn't it?

580
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:15,925
I really shouldn't let it
go out of the museum.

581
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,467
- Hey there, beautiful.
- No, thank you. Excuse me.

582
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:31,675
Oh, Diana.

583
00:44:32,508 --> 00:44:34,425
Hoping I'd see you.

584
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:36,717
Hey, do you know
I'm at the White House now?

585
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,758
Yeah, that's right. Interning,
but requested by name, so...

586
00:44:40,842 --> 00:44:43,633
Listen, I've had my eyes on you
for some time.

587
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:46,633
- So if you ever need...
- That's great, Carl.

588
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:52,008
Diana.

589
00:44:56,758 --> 00:44:58,425
Diana.

590
00:44:58,508 --> 00:45:01,133
Excuse me, I don't even know
you, so please stop following me.

591
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,008
- Good night.
- But...

592
00:45:08,092 --> 00:45:10,383
I wish we had more time.

593
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,008
Why did you say that?

594
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:19,675
Don't say that to me.

595
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,342
You don't even know me.

596
00:45:21,425 --> 00:45:23,758
Yes, I do.

597
00:45:34,717 --> 00:45:37,133
I can save today...

598
00:45:37,217 --> 00:45:40,092
but you can save the world.

599
00:45:47,967 --> 00:45:49,967
Steve?

600
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,800
Diana.

601
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,342
But how?

602
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,633
I don't know.

603
00:46:08,842 --> 00:46:10,592
Oh, my God.

604
00:46:13,008 --> 00:46:14,175
It's you.

605
00:46:25,217 --> 00:46:27,592
I missed you.

606
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:32,425
<i>So what do you remember?</i>

607
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,842
I remember...

608
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:37,550
I remember taking
the plane up...

609
00:46:37,633 --> 00:46:38,925
Mmm-hmm.

610
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:40,883
...and then...

611
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:44,175
nothing, really.

612
00:46:44,258 --> 00:46:45,675
Nothing.

613
00:46:45,758 --> 00:46:48,342
But somehow, I know
I've been someplace since then.

614
00:46:48,425 --> 00:46:51,092
Someplace that's, uh...

615
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:55,342
I can't really put words to it.

616
00:46:55,425 --> 00:46:59,133
But it's... It's good.

617
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:07,467
And then I, uh...
I woke up here.

618
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,383
Where?

619
00:47:08,467 --> 00:47:11,883
I ended up in a bed. Uh...

620
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:16,300
Strange, strange pillow bed
with slats.

621
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:18,133
- A futon, yeah.
- A futon?

622
00:47:18,217 --> 00:47:19,592
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

623
00:47:19,675 --> 00:47:24,383
Well, not comfortable.
And really a bit backwards

624
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:26,592
if I'm being
really honest with you.

625
00:47:26,675 --> 00:47:29,217
I mean, for a futuristic time
like this. Nineteen...

626
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,967
Eighty-four. 1984.

627
00:47:42,675 --> 00:47:45,717
That's amazing.

628
00:47:59,217 --> 00:48:03,217
Would you like
to see my futon?

629
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,550
Yeah. Um...

630
00:48:17,467 --> 00:48:19,592
You don't have to tell me.

631
00:48:19,675 --> 00:48:24,175
The place is a mess.
Cheese on demand.

632
00:48:24,258 --> 00:48:27,008
I spent all morning
cleaning his bedroom,

633
00:48:27,092 --> 00:48:30,425
but he seems to me
to be an engineer.

634
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,925
Lots of pictures of himself.

635
00:48:33,008 --> 00:48:38,717
Not what I would do,
but to each his own.

636
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,967
Oh, so this is
how you found me.

637
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,342
Yeah, the phone book.

638
00:48:43,425 --> 00:48:46,008
I guess some things
are just future-proof.

639
00:48:46,092 --> 00:48:47,342
So you went to my apartment?

640
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,925
Yeah, I tried to use
the bike at first.

641
00:48:49,008 --> 00:48:53,925
I couldn't really figure out
how to get it going,

642
00:48:54,008 --> 00:48:57,550
so I ran over
and saw you come back.

643
00:48:58,592 --> 00:49:02,675
And I was stunned.

644
00:49:04,383 --> 00:49:05,842
There you were.

645
00:49:07,717 --> 00:49:10,508
So I just, uh...

646
00:49:10,592 --> 00:49:12,967
followed you, like a creep.

647
00:49:16,092 --> 00:49:19,008
Diana, look at you. It's...

648
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:23,425
It's like not one day
has passed.

649
00:49:23,508 --> 00:49:26,092
I can't say the same thing
about you.

650
00:49:26,175 --> 00:49:31,300
Right, right, right.
Right.

651
00:49:38,717 --> 00:49:40,300
Yeah, he's, uh...

652
00:50:07,008 --> 00:50:08,383
He's got it.

653
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:11,175
No, I like him.

654
00:50:12,383 --> 00:50:16,925
He's great,
but all I see is you.

655
00:50:37,008 --> 00:50:41,217
"One great wish."
I've been waiting.

656
00:50:46,758 --> 00:50:49,425
I wish to be you.

657
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:52,217
The Dreamstone itself.

658
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:52,258
Hi.

659
00:51:54,092 --> 00:51:55,342
Come here.

660
00:51:55,425 --> 00:51:57,175
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

661
00:52:02,092 --> 00:52:03,675
Been eating Pop-Tarts
all morning,

662
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:06,508
and I've had about
three pots of coffee.

663
00:52:06,592 --> 00:52:10,758
This place is amazing.

664
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:13,592
- This place?
- Yeah.

665
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:15,883
You know,
if I really think about it,

666
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:19,008
I don't think I've ever been
in a room more amazing.

667
00:52:20,217 --> 00:52:21,717
- It's true.
- Yeah.

668
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,842
This room is
the most amazing place

669
00:52:23,925 --> 00:52:25,217
I've ever been in,
in my entire life.

670
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,800
It's the most
amazing place, right?

671
00:52:26,883 --> 00:52:30,258
So let's stay. We shouldn't go.

672
00:52:30,342 --> 00:52:32,758
- I really don't want to.
- So, let's not.

673
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:33,842
- Okay.
- Okay.

674
00:52:33,925 --> 00:52:35,050
Let's just stay here.

675
00:52:35,133 --> 00:52:36,675
Let's just stay here.

676
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,800
Forever.

677
00:52:41,883 --> 00:52:43,050
Although...

678
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:45,883
I should probably go
and figure out

679
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:50,967
how a stone brought my boyfriend
back in someone else's body.

680
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:57,550
That's a fair point. Let's go.

681
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,342
Whoa.

682
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:56,633
Mr. Stagg?

683
00:53:56,717 --> 00:53:58,633
Thank you, Belinda.

684
00:53:59,467 --> 00:54:00,550
Oh, God.

685
00:54:01,633 --> 00:54:03,758
You'd better be here
with my money.

686
00:54:03,842 --> 00:54:06,967
I'll have your money, Simon.
Today, I'm here for an apology.

687
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:09,633
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not going to apologize.

688
00:54:09,717 --> 00:54:10,925
I'm sorry.

689
00:54:11,008 --> 00:54:13,925
I messed up. I messed up.

690
00:54:14,008 --> 00:54:15,508
I lied.

691
00:54:16,842 --> 00:54:18,592
And I'm sorry.

692
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:21,842
You know, the truth is, I knew we
were going to sink a long time ago.

693
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,008
The wells were coming up dry.

694
00:54:24,092 --> 00:54:27,675
And no data suggested
that was going to change.

695
00:54:27,758 --> 00:54:29,383
I should have folded then.

696
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:32,633
But all the people that bought
in, that believed in me.

697
00:54:32,717 --> 00:54:35,008
- I wanted to do right.
- Oh, come on.

698
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:36,842
Max, look, you don't have to...

699
00:54:36,925 --> 00:54:40,758
Simon, don't you understand
that I wished for better?

700
00:54:40,842 --> 00:54:43,342
That with every ounce
of my being,

701
00:54:43,425 --> 00:54:47,800
I wished that Black Gold would
change the world for all of us.

702
00:54:49,592 --> 00:54:51,175
And I know
you wished that, too.

703
00:54:51,258 --> 00:54:54,050
Of course I wished that, too.

704
00:54:57,883 --> 00:54:59,758
Then your wish is granted.

705
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:02,633
And in return,
I'll take all of your shares...

706
00:55:04,675 --> 00:55:06,592
and full control of Black Gold,

707
00:55:06,675 --> 00:55:09,717
after you are somehow magically
removed from my path...

708
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,092
- You're gonna what?
- ...forever.

709
00:55:14,508 --> 00:55:16,383
Max!

710
00:55:16,467 --> 00:55:18,050
Hey, Max!

711
00:55:19,508 --> 00:55:22,717
- Get back here! Max!
- Ow.

712
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,008
What the hell is going on?

713
00:55:31,842 --> 00:55:33,217
We have a warrant
for Simon Stagg.

714
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,800
My word. Are we in danger?

715
00:55:34,883 --> 00:55:36,842
No, sir.
Federal taxation crime.

716
00:55:36,925 --> 00:55:38,758
It doesn't concern you.
Move along.

717
00:55:39,675 --> 00:55:41,008
Send them through.

718
00:55:41,092 --> 00:55:43,133
- Okay. Follow me.
- Let's go, guys.

719
00:55:55,467 --> 00:55:56,675
Ooh.

720
00:55:58,967 --> 00:56:02,383
So you said a stone
started all of this?

721
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:04,758
Yeah, that's what we need
to go and find out.

722
00:56:04,842 --> 00:56:07,342
I mean, it must have
done something.

723
00:56:07,425 --> 00:56:10,383
This is dynamite.

724
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:11,550
What do you think?

725
00:56:11,633 --> 00:56:13,925
- Yeah. Yeah...
- Huh? Right?

726
00:56:14,008 --> 00:56:17,300
I saw a couple of magazine pictures.
They roll these up.

727
00:56:17,383 --> 00:56:19,175
I think we can do better.

728
00:56:19,258 --> 00:56:21,800
Look at all the pockets in this.
There are pockets here.

729
00:56:21,883 --> 00:56:23,258
There are pockets
all over the pant.

730
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:26,967
American issue bag, adjustable.

731
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,675
Parachute pants?

732
00:56:28,758 --> 00:56:31,467
- Yeah. Uh...
- Does everybody parachute now?

733
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:33,133
<i>You know,
I'm not so keen on this one.</i>

734
00:56:33,217 --> 00:56:36,675
I figure you are, but you know
what, I'm ready to go.

735
00:56:36,758 --> 00:56:37,717
Mmm-mmm.

736
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,217
- Right?
- No.

737
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,758
- You're not even giving it a second.
- It's not good.

738
00:56:42,842 --> 00:56:45,508
"Too much" in a good way
or a bad way? Right?

739
00:56:45,592 --> 00:56:47,258
- In a bad way.
- Oh.

740
00:56:49,342 --> 00:56:50,550
Now that's great.

741
00:56:50,633 --> 00:56:52,508
It's beautiful.

742
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:55,133
Yeah. I would absolutely
never wear it.

743
00:56:55,217 --> 00:56:56,967
- I feel like a pirate.
- Steve.

744
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,800
Who would wear this?

745
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:01,008
Diana,

746
00:57:01,092 --> 00:57:02,550
have you seen these shoes?

747
00:57:02,633 --> 00:57:05,008
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Let's keep the shoes. Yes!

748
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:06,342
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Yes!

749
00:57:15,883 --> 00:57:18,383
This is a special one, okay?

750
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:20,675
- Let's do this together.
- Uh-huh.

751
00:57:22,342 --> 00:57:24,842
One foot after the other.

752
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:26,800
Now stay on this one.

753
00:57:26,883 --> 00:57:28,675
Go to the middle.

754
00:57:28,758 --> 00:57:30,675
No, Steve...

755
00:57:30,758 --> 00:57:32,717
Steve, you're gonna fall.

756
00:57:38,383 --> 00:57:40,967
I really thought
I was gonna fall.

757
00:57:56,175 --> 00:57:57,967
What's up?

758
00:58:18,633 --> 00:58:20,633
This is break dance.

759
00:58:20,717 --> 00:58:22,383
- Dancing?
- Yeah.

760
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:28,925
- Whoa!
- Oh, don't worry.

761
00:58:29,008 --> 00:58:30,217
- It's fine. It's just a move.
- Yeah? Oh.

762
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,425
It's nothing.

763
00:58:36,592 --> 00:58:38,883
It's all art.

764
00:58:41,675 --> 00:58:42,758
Yeah.

765
00:58:47,508 --> 00:58:49,175
Uh... That's just a trash can.

766
00:58:49,258 --> 00:58:51,258
It's just a trash can.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

767
00:58:54,925 --> 00:58:57,633
Is that a plane?

768
00:58:57,717 --> 00:59:00,467
Come on.
I want to show you something.

769
00:59:20,258 --> 00:59:22,800
This is incredible!

770
00:59:36,842 --> 00:59:39,300
<i>And every time we strike gold,</i>

771
00:59:39,383 --> 00:59:41,467
<i>you strike gold.</i>

772
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:46,300
<i>Think about finally having
everything you've always wished for.</i>

773
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:48,717
Raquel?

774
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,383
Raquel?

775
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:57,508
Black Gold. Can you hold, please?

776
00:59:59,467 --> 01:00:02,508
Black Gold. Yes. Hold, please.

777
01:00:02,592 --> 01:00:04,133
- Raquel?
- Hold, please.

778
01:00:04,217 --> 01:00:05,383
The wells struck pay!

779
01:00:05,467 --> 01:00:06,842
- Which ones?
- All of them.

780
01:00:06,925 --> 01:00:08,883
And the investors
heard about it somehow.

781
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:11,383
They're calling to up their buys.
Their friends are calling to buy in.

782
01:00:11,467 --> 01:00:13,550
New investors are calling
out of thin air.

783
01:00:13,633 --> 01:00:15,342
Hold on, please.
I need more help.

784
01:00:15,425 --> 01:00:18,217
- Black Gold. Can you hold, please?
- I'll get you help.

785
01:00:20,425 --> 01:00:22,717
Tell me again.
You wish you had more help?

786
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,467
Yes, I wish I had more help.

787
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:26,133
There are just
too many calls to take.

788
01:00:26,217 --> 01:00:27,800
Uh... Hi.

789
01:00:27,883 --> 01:00:29,342
I'm sorry to bother you.

790
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,300
I'm meant to be interviewing
at an accounting firm.

791
01:00:31,383 --> 01:00:32,717
- You're hired!
- Oh...

792
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,883
Welcome aboard!

793
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:35,550
- Emerson.
- Emerson!

794
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,217
Is this the employment office?

795
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,633
Yes! You're hired, too!

796
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,967
Mr. Lord,
it's <i>Wall Street Journal.</i>

797
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:45,342
They want to interview you
about company's sudden surge.

798
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,883
I'll take it in my office.

799
01:00:50,092 --> 01:00:53,550
And bring me my vitamins.

800
01:00:53,633 --> 01:00:55,550
So I did read
about four books last night...

801
01:00:57,717 --> 01:00:58,967
...to try to get to the bottom of this.
And did find out, Roger, you were right.

802
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:00,383
This is from the Song Dynasty.

803
01:01:00,467 --> 01:01:01,550
You were correct.

804
01:01:01,633 --> 01:01:03,383
And also interesting,

805
01:01:03,467 --> 01:01:05,217
I was looking at a couple of
encyclopedias last night and you...

806
01:01:06,425 --> 01:01:07,842
Thanks. Um...

807
01:01:10,425 --> 01:01:13,425
So funny, all this reading seems
to have cured my eyesight somehow.

808
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:17,008
- Interesting fact which we...
- Hey.

809
01:01:17,092 --> 01:01:18,967
- Hi.
- Good morning.

810
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,550
This is Steve. He's my, um...

811
01:01:21,633 --> 01:01:22,592
- Old friend.
- Yeah.

812
01:01:22,675 --> 01:01:25,092
Hi, old friend Steve.

813
01:01:25,175 --> 01:01:27,258
I'm Barbara,
Diana's new friend.

814
01:01:27,342 --> 01:01:28,758
So what do you do?

815
01:01:28,842 --> 01:01:30,467
I'm a pilot.

816
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:32,217
- Pilot? Isn't that...
- Can I speak to you for a second?

817
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,508
Sure.

818
01:01:36,258 --> 01:01:40,008
So, I just wanted to speak
to you about that stone.

819
01:01:40,092 --> 01:01:41,467
The citrine one.

820
01:01:42,592 --> 01:01:44,258
- Do you have it?
- Uh...

821
01:01:44,342 --> 01:01:47,800
Long story, actually,
about that.

822
01:01:47,883 --> 01:01:51,175
Max Lord came by
to visit yesterday.

823
01:01:51,258 --> 01:01:53,592
Which was actually
pretty great.

824
01:01:53,675 --> 01:01:55,800
I'll tell you
about it later. Um...

825
01:01:55,883 --> 01:01:58,300
I let him

826
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,800
borrow it.

827
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,092
What? Why?

828
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,425
Well, Diana,

829
01:02:02,508 --> 01:02:03,925
he just gave us
a huge amount of money.

830
01:02:04,008 --> 01:02:05,717
It's not like he's a stranger
or anything.

831
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,383
Plus he has a friend who's an
expert, and I don't know...

832
01:02:07,467 --> 01:02:09,300
What do you mean?
How could you loan it?

833
01:02:09,383 --> 01:02:11,217
- It's not even ours to loan.
- Whoa. Whoa.

834
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,383
What are you getting
on my case for?

835
01:02:13,467 --> 01:02:17,050
I've got 15 things in my office
more valuable than that stone.

836
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:18,883
Do you know where he took it?

837
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:21,383
No, I have no idea.

838
01:02:21,467 --> 01:02:23,300
Then I'll tell you
what we find out.

839
01:02:23,383 --> 01:02:24,633
Let's go.

840
01:02:24,717 --> 01:02:26,800
- I like your pants very much.
- Oh, thanks.

841
01:02:26,883 --> 01:02:28,258
Yeah. Call me.

842
01:02:28,342 --> 01:02:30,633
Or not. Whatever.

843
01:02:30,717 --> 01:02:32,967
But I'd be curious.

844
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:41,633
<i>Call the Black Gold hotline.</i>

845
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:44,467
<i>Shares are not available
in the building.</i>

846
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:49,092
What are these people doing?

847
01:02:49,175 --> 01:02:50,383
Whatever it is,

848
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:52,425
we're not getting in that way.

849
01:02:54,258 --> 01:02:57,467
Diana. Diana, this way.

850
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,925
Have at it.

851
01:03:22,508 --> 01:03:23,800
Strong lock.

852
01:03:38,675 --> 01:03:39,925
Steve.

853
01:03:56,175 --> 01:03:59,050
- It's so dusty.
- Yeah.

854
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:02,300
It's like a bomb went off.

855
01:04:14,008 --> 01:04:16,842
Whatever this is,
he's been looking for it for a long time.

856
01:04:29,092 --> 01:04:32,967
"Place upon
the object held."

857
01:04:35,842 --> 01:04:37,758
What is it?

858
01:04:37,842 --> 01:04:40,467
The language of the Gods.

859
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:43,342
Which God wrote it,
is the question.

860
01:04:46,217 --> 01:04:47,467
Thanks.

861
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,133
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. It's okay.

862
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:51,342
I gotta go do something. Okay.
I'll talk to you. All right?

863
01:04:51,425 --> 01:04:53,758
- Hello?
- <i>Barbara, I need your help.</i>

864
01:04:53,842 --> 01:04:55,925
<i>I need you to find out</i>

865
01:04:56,008 --> 01:04:58,633
exactly where
that stone was found.

866
01:04:58,717 --> 01:05:00,967
"Where" is what I need to know.
You understand?

867
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:03,258
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.</i>

868
01:05:03,342 --> 01:05:05,008
Thanks.

869
01:05:07,342 --> 01:05:09,342
You look like you saw a ghost.

870
01:05:10,925 --> 01:05:12,633
I did.

871
01:05:15,383 --> 01:05:17,883
There were many Gods

872
01:05:17,967 --> 01:05:20,675
and they did different things
for different reasons.

873
01:05:20,758 --> 01:05:24,842
One was making
objects like this.

874
01:05:24,925 --> 01:05:27,217
There are universal elements
in this world,

875
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,300
and when they're imbued
into something,

876
01:05:30,383 --> 01:05:34,800
they can become
very, very powerful.

877
01:05:35,758 --> 01:05:37,633
Like my Lasso of Truth.

878
01:05:37,717 --> 01:05:40,008
The truth is what powers it,
not me.

879
01:05:40,092 --> 01:05:43,175
The truth is bigger
than all of us.

880
01:05:43,258 --> 01:05:45,133
But what is this?

881
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:48,383
I don't know. Uh...

882
01:05:50,133 --> 01:05:52,050
Brought me back.

883
01:05:53,592 --> 01:05:57,508
Love or hope...

884
01:05:58,217 --> 01:05:59,967
maybe?

885
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:03,508
Maybe.

886
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:08,425
Well, whatever it is, I can promise you
this is too powerful for Maxwell Lord.

887
01:06:08,508 --> 01:06:10,300
We need to find this guy.

888
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,300
Uh...

889
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,592
Look at this.

890
01:06:21,675 --> 01:06:24,092
If this date's right,
he's going to Cairo.

891
01:06:25,008 --> 01:06:27,092
Cairo?

892
01:06:27,175 --> 01:06:30,383
Yeah.
Growth opportunity, you know?

893
01:06:30,467 --> 01:06:32,925
"King of Crude"?

894
01:06:33,008 --> 01:06:35,008
How is this so fast?

895
01:06:36,633 --> 01:06:38,467
You have a plane that can fly

896
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:40,008
from here to Cairo in one shot?

897
01:06:40,092 --> 01:06:41,925
That is amazing.

898
01:06:42,008 --> 01:06:44,592
Yeah, but we can't get you on one
because you don't have a passport.

899
01:06:44,675 --> 01:06:46,175
I don't want to get on one,

900
01:06:46,258 --> 01:06:48,050
I want to fly one.
I want to fly the plane.

901
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:49,633
I want to fly this plane.

902
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:51,883
Yeah?

903
01:07:17,258 --> 01:07:19,633
Oh, my Betsy.

904
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,633
Hey, Steve, this way.

905
01:07:26,717 --> 01:07:28,467
Yeah.

906
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:31,800
Look at these gams.

907
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:42,717
You wanna choose?

908
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:46,800
This one.

909
01:07:47,508 --> 01:07:48,967
I like it.

910
01:07:59,967 --> 01:08:01,425
Okay.

911
01:08:04,258 --> 01:08:07,258
Okay. Uh...

912
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:10,050
No.

913
01:08:10,133 --> 01:08:11,883
Uh...

914
01:08:13,008 --> 01:08:14,425
All right. Good, good.

915
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:16,550
Fuel, fuel, fuel.

916
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:18,217
Here we go. Engine.

917
01:08:20,258 --> 01:08:21,592
Here goes nothing.

918
01:08:24,842 --> 01:08:26,008
Oh...

919
01:08:38,092 --> 01:08:39,300
- Ken?
- What?

920
01:08:39,383 --> 01:08:41,050
There's an aircraft
on the runway.

921
01:08:41,133 --> 01:08:42,550
What do you mean,
"There's an aircraft on the runway"?

922
01:08:42,633 --> 01:08:43,925
Approach, this is Tower.

923
01:08:44,008 --> 01:08:45,342
There's an unlisted aircraft
on the runway.

924
01:08:45,425 --> 01:08:46,675
Are you seeing this?

925
01:08:50,842 --> 01:08:52,508
- Can you get us up there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

926
01:08:52,592 --> 01:08:54,092
I just have to pick up
speed first,

927
01:08:54,175 --> 01:08:55,758
and then I'll take off.

928
01:08:55,842 --> 01:08:58,758
The way I fly,
they will never find us.

929
01:09:03,133 --> 01:09:05,258
- Oh, I forgot to tell you.
- What?

930
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:06,717
Radar. I can't explain now,

931
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,008
but they'll see us anywhere,
even in the dark.

932
01:09:09,092 --> 01:09:11,842
Well, will they shoot at us?

933
01:09:12,967 --> 01:09:15,133
- Well, shit, Diana.
- Right.

934
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:23,842
- Diana.
- Wait. Shh! I know.

935
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:27,050
I know. Focus.

936
01:09:27,133 --> 01:09:28,967
Focus.

937
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:31,175
My father hid Themyscira
from the world,

938
01:09:31,258 --> 01:09:33,508
and I've been trying to learn
how he did it.

939
01:09:33,592 --> 01:09:34,675
Did what?

940
01:09:34,758 --> 01:09:36,633
Made something invisible.

941
01:09:36,717 --> 01:09:38,883
But in 50 years,
I've only done it once.

942
01:09:38,967 --> 01:09:40,508
Well, now's not a bad time
to start trying.

943
01:09:40,592 --> 01:09:42,717
- How long does it last?
- I don't know.

944
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,342
It was just a coffee cup...

945
01:09:45,425 --> 01:09:47,050
and I lost it.

946
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:13,633
Approach,

947
01:10:13,717 --> 01:10:14,842
the aircraft has vanished.

948
01:10:14,925 --> 01:10:16,092
Do you have eyes on it?

949
01:10:44,342 --> 01:10:46,633
An invisible jet.

950
01:11:09,842 --> 01:11:11,300
What's that?

951
01:11:13,592 --> 01:11:14,550
Oh, it's okay.

952
01:11:14,633 --> 01:11:16,592
It's just fireworks.

953
01:11:16,675 --> 01:11:19,342
The Fourth. Of course.

954
01:11:19,425 --> 01:11:20,925
The Fourth of July?

955
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:02,550
Wow.

956
01:12:14,133 --> 01:12:15,717
I got an idea.

957
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:53,842
You know, it's the one thing.

958
01:12:53,925 --> 01:12:56,217
The one thing
that's always been you to me.

959
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,217
What?

960
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,383
Flight.

961
01:12:58,467 --> 01:13:00,133
Your gift.

962
01:13:00,217 --> 01:13:02,717
I'll never understand it.

963
01:13:03,467 --> 01:13:05,008
Ah, it's...

964
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:08,675
It's so easy, really.

965
01:13:08,758 --> 01:13:11,800
It's wind and air

966
01:13:11,883 --> 01:13:15,967
and knowing how to ride it,
how to catch it.

967
01:13:17,383 --> 01:13:19,008
How to join with it.

968
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,008
Yeah.

969
01:13:22,092 --> 01:13:24,675
It's like anything, really.

970
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,175
Great, thanks.

971
01:13:51,258 --> 01:13:54,425
Found the last one.

972
01:13:54,508 --> 01:13:56,508
This should keep you busy
for a while.

973
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:01,675
Anything else I can get you?
Coffee?

974
01:14:02,092 --> 01:14:03,675
Tea?

975
01:14:03,758 --> 01:14:05,717
Me?

976
01:14:07,133 --> 01:14:09,967
I don't need anything from you,
and I'm done.

977
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,842
You're done?

978
01:14:11,925 --> 01:14:14,842
Hey, you don't have
to be mean about it.

979
01:14:21,717 --> 01:14:23,842
Hey, babe.
Where you going?

980
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:25,633
No thanks.

981
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,592
Ooh, you're pretty.

982
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:33,758
Hey, slow down, sexy.

983
01:14:38,925 --> 01:14:40,217
You talking to me?

984
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,342
Yep. I'm talking to you.

985
01:14:43,508 --> 01:14:46,842
Why don't you just
slow down a bit, huh?

986
01:14:46,925 --> 01:14:48,842
Come on, girl.

987
01:14:48,925 --> 01:14:51,675
I'd rather not.
You know what I mean?

988
01:14:54,008 --> 01:14:56,383
I'd rather not have anything
to do with someone like you.

989
01:14:56,467 --> 01:14:59,092
I'd rather you stop
harassing people.

990
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,883
Like me.

991
01:15:02,967 --> 01:15:04,258
Do you remember me?

992
01:15:06,133 --> 01:15:08,758
Oh, yeah, yeah.

993
01:15:08,842 --> 01:15:12,092
I remember.
Where were we, huh?

994
01:15:15,008 --> 01:15:16,175
No.

995
01:15:20,258 --> 01:15:21,425
No.

996
01:15:27,967 --> 01:15:28,967
No.

997
01:15:31,258 --> 01:15:32,342
She's right.

998
01:15:32,425 --> 01:15:34,717
It's not that hard.

999
01:15:40,008 --> 01:15:43,008
Yeah, I think I get it now.

1000
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,342
His body weight
does do all the work.

1001
01:15:50,508 --> 01:15:52,092
So easy.

1002
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,342
I think

1003
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:56,967
I could do this...

1004
01:15:59,508 --> 01:16:01,675
all...

1005
01:16:03,175 --> 01:16:04,383
night...

1006
01:16:05,883 --> 01:16:07,842
long!

1007
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:26,883
Barbara?

1008
01:16:30,342 --> 01:16:32,217
What are you doing?

1009
01:16:34,592 --> 01:16:36,967
Mind your business.

1010
01:16:44,717 --> 01:16:46,092
Sir?

1011
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:58,592
Your fortune the last few days
has been impressive, to say the least.

1012
01:16:58,675 --> 01:17:02,258
But why come all this way
to meet with me? Hmm?

1013
01:17:03,342 --> 01:17:05,008
To meet a peer.

1014
01:17:05,092 --> 01:17:06,842
A peer?

1015
01:17:06,925 --> 01:17:10,550
No, Mr. Lord. I only agreed to meet
with you because I was curious.

1016
01:17:10,633 --> 01:17:13,800
No one gets that lucky.
How did you do it?

1017
01:17:16,425 --> 01:17:20,300
On my journey
to self-fulfillment...

1018
01:17:20,383 --> 01:17:22,675
I lucked into a secret.

1019
01:17:22,758 --> 01:17:24,925
The secret of the wish.

1020
01:17:25,758 --> 01:17:27,008
So I wished for it.

1021
01:17:27,092 --> 01:17:30,508
Or someone
wished for it for me.

1022
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,425
Tell me what you wish for,
Your Highness,

1023
01:17:34,508 --> 01:17:37,050
and I will show you
how it works.

1024
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:41,133
I wish for things
one cannot attain.

1025
01:17:41,217 --> 01:17:42,758
Like what?

1026
01:17:44,758 --> 01:17:47,175
All of my land to be returned.

1027
01:17:47,258 --> 01:17:48,967
My ancestral realm.

1028
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:51,342
The Bialyian Dynasty.

1029
01:17:51,425 --> 01:17:54,300
And for all the heathens
who dare trod upon it

1030
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:59,592
to be kept out forever,
so that its glory may be renewed.

1031
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,633
You wish for that?

1032
01:18:01,717 --> 01:18:04,592
I wish for that deeply.

1033
01:18:09,842 --> 01:18:12,133
Your wish is granted.

1034
01:18:12,217 --> 01:18:15,425
And in return,
I will take your oil.

1035
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:23,758
You truly delight me.

1036
01:18:23,842 --> 01:18:26,092
You know so little.

1037
01:18:26,175 --> 01:18:29,425
I sold my oil to the Saudis.

1038
01:18:29,508 --> 01:18:30,925
You are a silly man.

1039
01:18:39,508 --> 01:18:41,550
Then I will take
your security team

1040
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:43,508
and leave you here
with nothing to defend yourself

1041
01:18:43,592 --> 01:18:47,258
against the wrath you most
certainly will face.

1042
01:19:27,425 --> 01:19:30,425
Stop! Stop the car!

1043
01:19:30,508 --> 01:19:31,800
What are you doing?

1044
01:19:31,883 --> 01:19:34,175
Stop what you're doing now!
I'm telling you.

1045
01:19:34,258 --> 01:19:36,133
I command you to stop!

1046
01:19:37,092 --> 01:19:38,175
Stop!

1047
01:19:38,258 --> 01:19:40,508
Stop! Stop!

1048
01:19:42,508 --> 01:19:45,342
<i>This
unbelievable and unexplainable wall</i>

1049
01:19:45,425 --> 01:19:47,050
<i>appears to somehow be the work</i>

1050
01:19:47,133 --> 01:19:49,050
<i>of Emir Said Bin Abydos.</i>

1051
01:19:49,133 --> 01:19:51,842
<i>The government is reporting

1052
01:19:51,925 --> 01:19:54,175
<i>acknowledging his claim

1053
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,675
You okay?

1054
01:20:06,758 --> 01:20:09,175
I'm fine.

1055
01:20:09,258 --> 01:20:13,050
You keep saying that, but...

1056
01:20:15,217 --> 01:20:16,300
That was him!

1057
01:20:16,383 --> 01:20:18,467
That was Max Lord.

1058
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,633
Get rid of them, please.

1059
01:21:24,383 --> 01:21:25,467
I got this.

1060
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:26,508
What?

1061
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:29,008
Diana!

1062
01:21:42,925 --> 01:21:44,717
The brakes still work.

1063
01:23:59,383 --> 01:24:00,925
Max Lord,

1064
01:24:01,008 --> 01:24:04,342
you're putting yourself and
everyone else in grave danger.

1065
01:24:04,425 --> 01:24:06,300
I need you
to give me the stone.

1066
01:24:06,383 --> 01:24:08,467
What happened to it?

1067
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:10,508
You're looking at it.

1068
01:24:16,717 --> 01:24:17,883
Whoa!

1069
01:25:08,842 --> 01:25:10,383
Steve!

1070
01:25:10,967 --> 01:25:11,925
Diana!

1071
01:26:11,842 --> 01:26:14,467
So who's the next
closest person with oil?

1072
01:26:34,217 --> 01:26:37,467
Diana. Diana.

1073
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:42,508
My God.
What's going on with you?

1074
01:26:42,592 --> 01:26:45,258
<i>A truly bizarre phenomenon
that is being called the Divine Wall.</i>

1075
01:26:45,342 --> 01:26:46,842
What is happening?

1076
01:26:46,925 --> 01:26:48,467
<i>It's an unexplainable event</i>

1077
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:50,425
<i>that now sees
Egypt's poorest communities</i>

1078
01:26:50,508 --> 01:26:52,842
<i>entirely cut off from their
only supply of fresh water.</i>

1079
01:26:52,925 --> 01:26:55,717
<i>An already
tense situation now escalating</i>

1080
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:00,050
<i>as the Soviet Union announces they
will recognize the Emir's claim.</i>

1081
01:27:00,133 --> 01:27:01,675
- Oh, no.
- <i>The United States,</i>

1082
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:04,133
<i>a longtime ally of Egypt,
has declared</i>

1083
01:27:04,217 --> 01:27:06,842
<i>their intention to side
with the government.</i>

1084
01:27:06,925 --> 01:27:09,217
<i>Bedlam on the home front
now as well</i>

1085
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,800
<i>as the shocking news
that American businessman</i>

1086
01:27:11,883 --> 01:27:14,633
<i>Max Lord has somehow
come into possession</i>

1087
01:27:14,717 --> 01:27:17,092
<i>of over half
of the world's oil reserves.</i>

1088
01:27:17,175 --> 01:27:20,300
<i>The instability in the
oil community has resulted</i>

1089
01:27:20,383 --> 01:27:22,258
<i>in a nationwide run on gas,</i>

1090
01:27:22,342 --> 01:27:24,300
<i>and experts are girding themselves...</i>

1091
01:27:24,383 --> 01:27:25,383
Hello?

1092
01:27:25,467 --> 01:27:26,800
Barbara, it's Diana.

1093
01:27:26,883 --> 01:27:30,175
- Did you...
- <i>Yeah. Uh, well, sort of.</i>

1094
01:27:30,258 --> 01:27:32,800
<i>I haven't figured out
exactly what the stone is,</i>

1095
01:27:32,883 --> 01:27:35,800
<i>but I've found
historical images of it.</i>

1096
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:36,800
From where?

1097
01:27:36,883 --> 01:27:38,342
That's the weird thing.

1098
01:27:38,425 --> 01:27:40,092
From everywhere.

1099
01:27:40,175 --> 01:27:43,633
It first appeared in the Indus
Valley almost 4,000 years ago.

1100
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:46,425
It popped up again
in Carthage in 146 BC.

1101
01:27:46,508 --> 01:27:48,342
Kush, 4 AD.

1102
01:27:48,425 --> 01:27:50,342
Romulus, the last
Emperor of Rome,

1103
01:27:50,425 --> 01:27:53,425
he had it on him when
he was assassinated in 476.

1104
01:27:53,508 --> 01:27:57,508
<i>The last record is in some
previously unknown dead city</i>

1105
01:27:57,592 --> 01:27:59,008
<i>near Dzibilchaltun.</i>

1106
01:27:59,092 --> 01:28:00,842
- The Mayans.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1107
01:28:00,925 --> 01:28:03,050
Anyway, it just led me
to a bunch of dead ends,

1108
01:28:03,133 --> 01:28:06,800
and my last lead
is not that promising.

1109
01:28:06,883 --> 01:28:08,050
What's that?

1110
01:28:08,133 --> 01:28:09,800
<i>A flier I found.</i>

1111
01:28:09,883 --> 01:28:11,675
Grabbed it at the embassy.

1112
01:28:11,758 --> 01:28:14,592
Some guy advertising
to be a Mayan shaman.

1113
01:28:14,675 --> 01:28:18,217
But he literally teaches a course
in a squat next to Galaxy Records.

1114
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:21,050
- And he knows about the stone?
- <i>So he says.</i>

1115
01:28:21,133 --> 01:28:23,258
I'm gonna go there
in the morning.

1116
01:28:23,342 --> 01:28:27,050
Okay, we'll meet you there.
And thank you.

1117
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,675
What is it?

1118
01:28:33,508 --> 01:28:34,883
The stone has
traveled the world

1119
01:28:34,967 --> 01:28:36,717
to seemingly random
and different places,

1120
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,217
- but they all have one thing in common.
- What?

1121
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:42,342
Their civilizations collapsed
catastrophically.

1122
01:28:42,425 --> 01:28:44,717
Without a trace as to why.

1123
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,592
You don't think
the stone could have...

1124
01:28:47,258 --> 01:28:48,633
Do you?

1125
01:28:48,717 --> 01:28:50,925
I don't know
what to think, Steve.

1126
01:28:51,842 --> 01:28:54,758
I can only hope I'm wrong.

1127
01:29:22,508 --> 01:29:24,717
Babajide?

1128
01:29:29,842 --> 01:29:31,925
- That was fast.
- Morning.

1129
01:29:34,008 --> 01:29:35,508
Hello.

1130
01:29:37,008 --> 01:29:39,133
One second.

1131
01:29:41,175 --> 01:29:43,175
So you're a Mayan?

1132
01:29:43,258 --> 01:29:45,675
What? I'm a citizen
of the world.

1133
01:29:45,758 --> 01:29:47,133
It says your name is Frank.

1134
01:29:47,217 --> 01:29:50,467
Yeah. Most of what I know
is a past-life thing.

1135
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:51,800
So that's a no.

1136
01:29:51,883 --> 01:29:54,217
But to answer
your question, yes.

1137
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:57,508
My great-great-grandfather

1138
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:59,175
left me this.

1139
01:29:59,258 --> 01:30:02,342
I don't know everything about
it, but I have been warned

1140
01:30:02,425 --> 01:30:03,883
I'm better off that way.

1141
01:30:03,967 --> 01:30:07,550
What I do know is,
it destroyed our people

1142
01:30:07,633 --> 01:30:08,967
in a matter of months.

1143
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:11,633
The few survivors,
they buried the stone,

1144
01:30:11,717 --> 01:30:14,800
never to be exhumed
under any circumstances.

1145
01:30:14,883 --> 01:30:17,633
- Can I see that?
- Be my guest.

1146
01:30:32,008 --> 01:30:33,425
What?

1147
01:30:34,133 --> 01:30:35,175
What is it?

1148
01:30:39,092 --> 01:30:40,842
<i>Dechalafrea Ero.</i>

1149
01:30:40,925 --> 01:30:42,008
What's that?

1150
01:30:42,092 --> 01:30:44,383
A very bad God.

1151
01:30:44,467 --> 01:30:47,008
The God of Lies,
Dolos, Mendacius,

1152
01:30:47,092 --> 01:30:49,342
Duke of Deception.
He's been called by many names.

1153
01:30:49,425 --> 01:30:51,758
But if he's the one
who empowered that stone,

1154
01:30:51,842 --> 01:30:53,217
there has to be a trick.

1155
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,258
What do lies have to do
with granting wishes?

1156
01:30:55,342 --> 01:30:57,717
It seems more like
a Dreamstone to me.

1157
01:30:58,758 --> 01:31:01,383
Wishes with a trick.

1158
01:31:01,467 --> 01:31:03,925
"The Monkey's Paw."

1159
01:31:04,008 --> 01:31:05,717
Beware what you wish for.

1160
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:09,133
It grants your wish,
but takes your most valued possession.

1161
01:31:10,467 --> 01:31:12,300
Diana, your powers.

1162
01:31:12,383 --> 01:31:13,842
No, that doesn't
make any sense.

1163
01:31:13,925 --> 01:31:15,883
What's more precious
than what you wish for?

1164
01:31:15,967 --> 01:31:17,175
How do we stop this?

1165
01:31:17,258 --> 01:31:18,717
The legend said

1166
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,800
it can only be stopped
by destroying the stone itself

1167
01:31:20,883 --> 01:31:22,800
or give back what was given.
My people couldn't do the first thing

1168
01:31:22,883 --> 01:31:24,467
and refused to do the second.

1169
01:31:25,425 --> 01:31:27,258
Now the culture's destroyed.

1170
01:31:27,342 --> 01:31:29,217
Wiped from the face
of the Earth.

1171
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:32,258
- No one renounced their wish?
- But the stone is already destroyed.

1172
01:31:32,342 --> 01:31:34,133
What? When?

1173
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,633
"You're looking at it."

1174
01:31:38,717 --> 01:31:42,508
"You're looking at it." That's
what Max Lord said to me.

1175
01:31:42,592 --> 01:31:44,300
Maybe it's him.

1176
01:31:44,383 --> 01:31:46,300
He's become it somehow.

1177
01:31:46,383 --> 01:31:48,258
But how would
that happen?

1178
01:31:48,342 --> 01:31:50,758
I mean, if he wished for...

1179
01:31:59,258 --> 01:32:02,175
No, that's crazy. No.

1180
01:32:02,258 --> 01:32:04,425
If we destroy it,

1181
01:32:04,508 --> 01:32:06,550
if we destroy him...

1182
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:08,800
all the wishes go back.

1183
01:32:08,883 --> 01:32:10,467
What are you
talking about? No.

1184
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:12,342
I'm not gonna be
a part of that. No.

1185
01:32:12,425 --> 01:32:14,258
Or if everyone
renounces their wish.

1186
01:32:14,342 --> 01:32:17,758
No, there has to be
a better way.

1187
01:32:17,842 --> 01:32:19,258
No.

1188
01:32:22,842 --> 01:32:24,217
She's right.

1189
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,425
We don't know enough.
We just don't know enough.

1190
01:32:26,508 --> 01:32:29,467
But what we do know is that we need
to stop him before he grants any more.

1191
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:33,300
Stopping him might
not be enough, Diana.

1192
01:32:33,383 --> 01:32:34,967
Wishes have been made.

1193
01:32:37,175 --> 01:32:38,550
Barbara?

1194
01:32:40,008 --> 01:32:41,425
Barbara?

1195
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:52,133
Like I want any of
these people in the club anyway.

1196
01:32:52,217 --> 01:32:53,717
Can we tell them
they're not invited?

1197
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,008
No, sir.

1198
01:32:55,092 --> 01:32:56,925
- The FCC said we couldn't...
- Oh, the FCC.

1199
01:32:57,008 --> 01:33:00,800
The BBB, the FBD.

1200
01:33:00,883 --> 01:33:03,633
It's a conspiracy
against my success.

1201
01:33:03,717 --> 01:33:05,800
They're jealous. That's why.
Who's next?

1202
01:33:05,883 --> 01:33:08,592
- Who's next?
- Well, everyone you asked for,

1203
01:33:08,675 --> 01:33:10,342
Lai Zhong, Mr. Khalaji,

1204
01:33:10,425 --> 01:33:13,508
- that televangelist who stole your slot.
- Mmm.

1205
01:33:13,592 --> 01:33:15,217
And you have Alistair
for the night.

1206
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:18,508
Alistair? Again?
How many weekends do I have?

1207
01:33:18,592 --> 01:33:19,633
What? What? When?

1208
01:33:19,717 --> 01:33:21,133
Tonight?

1209
01:33:25,925 --> 01:33:27,092
He's here already.

1210
01:33:27,175 --> 01:33:28,925
His mom is with her boyfriend.

1211
01:33:34,425 --> 01:33:36,675
Send in Mr. Zhong, please.

1212
01:33:36,758 --> 01:33:39,675
And buy Alistair a pony.

1213
01:33:39,758 --> 01:33:42,217
No! A race car.
Get him a race car.

1214
01:33:44,633 --> 01:33:46,717
Let's get to it, Lai.

1215
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,467
Tell me...

1216
01:33:49,217 --> 01:33:50,758
what do you want?

1217
01:33:51,883 --> 01:33:54,883
What do you wish for?

1218
01:33:54,967 --> 01:33:57,050
- Me? Truly?
- Mmm-hmm.

1219
01:33:57,133 --> 01:33:59,050
Mmm-hmm.

1220
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:01,883
The Soviets have sided
with Iran.

1221
01:34:01,967 --> 01:34:05,258
Iraq is preparing to defend
ourselves, as unrest spreads.

1222
01:34:05,342 --> 01:34:08,383
And you need? What do you...

1223
01:34:08,467 --> 01:34:10,383
What do you wish for?

1224
01:34:10,467 --> 01:34:12,675
Consider the sex tape gone.

1225
01:34:12,758 --> 01:34:14,758
And God darn it,
if I have to keep doing this

1226
01:34:14,842 --> 01:34:17,800
one by one, by one, by one...

1227
01:34:17,883 --> 01:34:19,425
- How's your health?
- Well...

1228
01:34:19,508 --> 01:34:20,675
Forget that.

1229
01:34:20,758 --> 01:34:22,842
But I will take
your entire congregation

1230
01:34:22,925 --> 01:34:24,300
and your time slot.

1231
01:34:24,383 --> 01:34:25,383
Let me ask you,

1232
01:34:25,467 --> 01:34:27,550
when they pray,
is there any way

1233
01:34:27,633 --> 01:34:30,883
I could get all of them to...

1234
01:34:30,967 --> 01:34:32,258
join hands with me?

1235
01:34:32,342 --> 01:34:34,050
And simply say, "I wish"

1236
01:34:34,133 --> 01:34:36,133
rather than, "I pray"?

1237
01:34:36,217 --> 01:34:37,592
Would that even work?

1238
01:34:37,675 --> 01:34:38,592
I don't...

1239
01:34:38,675 --> 01:34:40,008
I need to find a way

1240
01:34:40,092 --> 01:34:42,925
to touch a lot of people
at the same time.

1241
01:34:44,175 --> 01:34:45,925
Sir. The police are here.

1242
01:34:46,008 --> 01:34:48,258
They're challenging the
jurisdiction of your security team.

1243
01:34:48,342 --> 01:34:50,342
Oh, God!

1244
01:34:50,425 --> 01:34:53,592
This isn't working.
Bring in someone new.

1245
01:34:53,675 --> 01:34:54,842
And my son.

1246
01:34:54,925 --> 01:34:56,925
You, beat it.

1247
01:35:06,425 --> 01:35:08,217
Alistair!

1248
01:35:10,258 --> 01:35:12,717
I've missed you, buddy.

1249
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,675
Come. Sit down with Daddy.
I'm sorry.

1250
01:35:16,342 --> 01:35:21,425
But, your dad is on the absolute
precipice of everything.

1251
01:35:21,508 --> 01:35:23,842
Remember when I told you
that I would be number one?

1252
01:35:23,925 --> 01:35:25,800
Do you remember? Your dad?

1253
01:35:25,883 --> 01:35:28,092
Well, I'm inches away. Huh?

1254
01:35:28,175 --> 01:35:30,133
I know it's hard. I know.

1255
01:35:30,217 --> 01:35:31,633
But listen,

1256
01:35:31,717 --> 01:35:33,967
I also know what you wish for,
and I wish for it, too.

1257
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:36,175
Do you hear that?
I wish for it, too.

1258
01:35:36,258 --> 01:35:37,592
I just wish
I could be with you...

1259
01:35:37,675 --> 01:35:39,258
No!

1260
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,508
You don't use your
one wish like that, Alistair.

1261
01:35:43,592 --> 01:35:46,467
You don't wish for something
that you already have.

1262
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:49,217
You wish for greatness,
for success.

1263
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:51,508
That's why
I'm doing all of this.

1264
01:35:51,592 --> 01:35:56,467
Don't you see that my greatness
is your greatness? Huh?

1265
01:36:00,050 --> 01:36:01,925
Then I wish for your greatness.

1266
01:36:02,008 --> 01:36:04,050
No. No!

1267
01:36:16,883 --> 01:36:18,425
Thank you.

1268
01:36:19,758 --> 01:36:21,842
I love you so much.

1269
01:36:21,925 --> 01:36:23,800
And I promise you, one day,

1270
01:36:23,883 --> 01:36:26,342
everything is going
to make sense.

1271
01:36:26,425 --> 01:36:29,342
And one day, you'll thank me.

1272
01:36:30,717 --> 01:36:33,425
But right now, I, uh...

1273
01:36:33,508 --> 01:36:36,842
Right now, I need you to stay here
with Emerson, okay? I'll be back.

1274
01:36:36,925 --> 01:36:39,175
You stay here.

1275
01:36:50,133 --> 01:36:51,550
You. You.

1276
01:36:51,633 --> 01:36:53,175
Yes, sir?

1277
01:36:53,258 --> 01:36:55,508
Don't you wish I had an audience
with the President today?

1278
01:36:55,592 --> 01:36:57,383
Of course I do.

1279
01:36:57,467 --> 01:36:59,217
And can I tell you how happy I am
that you value my opinion, sir.

1280
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:01,633
Wait a minute.
Have I asked for your wish before?

1281
01:37:01,717 --> 01:37:03,800
Yesterday. A Porsche.

1282
01:37:03,883 --> 01:37:05,383
What is it with you aides
and Porsches?

1283
01:37:05,925 --> 01:37:07,175
You!

1284
01:37:07,258 --> 01:37:08,675
Hi.

1285
01:37:08,758 --> 01:37:10,800
This way.

1286
01:37:15,592 --> 01:37:16,592
How's traffic?

1287
01:37:16,675 --> 01:37:18,342
Huh? Terrible.

1288
01:37:18,425 --> 01:37:20,050
Don't you wish it wasn't?

1289
01:37:20,133 --> 01:37:23,092
And that everywhere you went
parted like the great Red Sea?

1290
01:37:23,175 --> 01:37:27,467
Of course I wish that.
Sadly, ain't gonna happen.

1291
01:37:35,342 --> 01:37:36,675
Hey, you! Stop!

1292
01:37:36,758 --> 01:37:39,008
Come on in. It's not safe.

1293
01:37:39,092 --> 01:37:41,092
There's a riot
at the Saudi Embassy

1294
01:37:41,175 --> 01:37:43,758
and there are Porsches
racing up and down the street.

1295
01:37:43,842 --> 01:37:44,925
Come on. It's mad.

1296
01:37:45,008 --> 01:37:47,925
But my cows.

1297
01:37:48,008 --> 01:37:51,633
I told a man I wanted a farm.

1298
01:37:51,717 --> 01:37:54,133
I didn't mean here.

1299
01:37:58,550 --> 01:38:00,967
I'll be right back.

1300
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,675
Diana, I know it's been hard.

1301
01:39:01,758 --> 01:39:04,008
You don't know. You don't.

1302
01:39:04,092 --> 01:39:05,967
But we...

1303
01:39:06,050 --> 01:39:07,467
It can't go on like this.

1304
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:09,717
- I can't talk about this.
- We have to talk about it.

1305
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,467
Steve, I can't talk about this!

1306
01:39:17,092 --> 01:39:19,592
I give everything I have,
every day.

1307
01:39:19,675 --> 01:39:21,550
And I'm happy to.

1308
01:39:21,633 --> 01:39:25,050
But this one thing...

1309
01:39:25,133 --> 01:39:29,800
You're all that I've wanted
for so long.

1310
01:39:29,883 --> 01:39:33,550
You're the only joy I've had
or even asked for.

1311
01:39:34,383 --> 01:39:36,092
I am so sorry...

1312
01:39:38,133 --> 01:39:40,842
but that's crazy.

1313
01:39:40,925 --> 01:39:44,842
There's a world
out there full of

1314
01:39:44,925 --> 01:39:46,217
so many better guys, for one.

1315
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:48,550
I mean, how about this guy?
How about him?

1316
01:39:48,633 --> 01:39:51,175
I don't want him. I want you.

1317
01:39:51,258 --> 01:39:54,675
Why, for once, can't I just
have this one thing, Steve?

1318
01:39:54,758 --> 01:39:56,425
This one thing.

1319
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:01,717
I'm not sure we have a choice.

1320
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,383
Well, I do have a choice.

1321
01:40:06,467 --> 01:40:07,967
And I can't give you up.
I can't.

1322
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:10,425
So I won't.
So we need to stop him

1323
01:40:10,508 --> 01:40:12,717
so we can figure that out.

1324
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,092
There has to be another way.

1325
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:17,092
Has to.

1326
01:40:30,175 --> 01:40:31,258
Wow.

1327
01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:35,217
This is incredible.

1328
01:40:40,175 --> 01:40:41,300
What's that?

1329
01:40:42,675 --> 01:40:44,383
From my culture.

1330
01:40:44,467 --> 01:40:49,133
The armor of an ancient Amazon warrior.
One of our greatest.

1331
01:40:49,217 --> 01:40:51,883
It's huge. This whole thing?

1332
01:40:53,967 --> 01:40:55,300
What is it made out of?

1333
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:57,258
Here. Let me show you.

1334
01:40:58,050 --> 01:40:59,883
Give me your hand.

1335
01:40:59,967 --> 01:41:01,592
What are you talking about?
I haven't lied.

1336
01:41:01,675 --> 01:41:04,300
The Lasso does more than
just make you tell the truth.

1337
01:41:04,383 --> 01:41:06,508
It can make you see it, too.

1338
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:14,008
<i>Her name was Asteria.</i>

1339
01:41:14,092 --> 01:41:15,967
<i>She was our greatest warrior.</i>

1340
01:41:16,050 --> 01:41:20,467
<i>When mankind enslaved the
Amazons, my mother freed us.</i>

1341
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:23,592
<i>But someone had to stay behind
to hold back the tide of men</i>

1342
01:41:23,675 --> 01:41:26,842
<i>so the others
could escape to Themyscira.</i>

1343
01:41:26,925 --> 01:41:28,967
<i>My people gave up
all of their armor</i>

1344
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:34,300
<i>to make her one suit strong
enough to take on the whole world.</i>

1345
01:41:34,383 --> 01:41:39,758
<i>And Asteria sacrificed herself
for a better day for others.</i>

1346
01:41:43,675 --> 01:41:45,092
That's...

1347
01:41:46,883 --> 01:41:48,008
That's incredible.

1348
01:41:48,092 --> 01:41:51,133
When I came here,
I searched for her.

1349
01:41:51,217 --> 01:41:54,633
But all I could find
was her armor.

1350
01:41:54,717 --> 01:41:56,300
What is this?

1351
01:41:57,508 --> 01:41:59,300
Where is he going?

1352
01:41:59,383 --> 01:42:00,800
Oh, no.

1353
01:42:20,508 --> 01:42:22,217
Diana, Diana!
What are you doing?

1354
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:23,967
- Where are you going?
- Steve, I'm going. You need to stay.

1355
01:42:24,050 --> 01:42:26,050
No. No. Listen to me.

1356
01:42:26,133 --> 01:42:27,425
You're getting weaker, Diana.

1357
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:28,758
- What if you fall?
- I won't.

1358
01:42:28,842 --> 01:42:31,758
You might. We don't know that.

1359
01:42:31,842 --> 01:42:34,217
There has to be another way in.

1360
01:42:46,717 --> 01:42:48,758
Everything okay, Mr. President?

1361
01:42:49,175 --> 01:42:50,258
Yes.

1362
01:42:51,133 --> 01:42:53,467
Something very strange. I...

1363
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:57,175
I thought I was somewhere else entirely.
Suddenly...

1364
01:42:58,508 --> 01:43:01,342
Anyway. Hectic times.

1365
01:43:02,592 --> 01:43:04,883
Give us a minute.

1366
01:43:10,675 --> 01:43:11,675
Excuse me.

1367
01:43:15,133 --> 01:43:16,800
- Carl.
- Diana.

1368
01:43:16,883 --> 01:43:18,592
- Hi.
- What a pleasure.

1369
01:43:18,675 --> 01:43:20,800
Good to see you.
How have you been?

1370
01:43:20,883 --> 01:43:22,175
- Good.
- This is Steve.

1371
01:43:22,258 --> 01:43:23,925
Steve, this is Carl.
My colleague.

1372
01:43:24,008 --> 01:43:26,383
- Hi.
- Hi.

1373
01:43:26,467 --> 01:43:27,758
Shall we, uh...

1374
01:43:27,842 --> 01:43:30,300
Yeah, we shall.

1375
01:43:30,383 --> 01:43:31,925
I'm sorry, Mr. Lord.

1376
01:43:32,008 --> 01:43:34,300
In fact, I don't even know
what we're supposed to discuss.

1377
01:43:34,383 --> 01:43:35,633
Exactly that, Mr. President.

1378
01:43:35,717 --> 01:43:39,633
These hectic days,
hectic times.

1379
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,092
And you.

1380
01:43:42,175 --> 01:43:43,467
<i>These aren't
exactly my favorite</i>

1381
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:45,258
of the busts on display here,

1382
01:43:45,342 --> 01:43:48,633
but it's a little picture of my top
ten, maybe top five at a push.

1383
01:43:48,717 --> 01:43:50,925
Oh, here's something up ahead
that will interest you.

1384
01:43:51,008 --> 01:43:55,883
These are floor tiles originally
laid by none other than Jan Lincoln,

1385
01:43:55,967 --> 01:43:58,467
a little-known descendent
of Abraham.

1386
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:01,133
You're having some troubles?

1387
01:44:01,217 --> 01:44:02,675
Everywhere suddenly.

1388
01:44:02,758 --> 01:44:04,633
Cuba, Egypt,

1389
01:44:04,717 --> 01:44:06,217
even here.

1390
01:44:06,883 --> 01:44:08,383
But Russia...

1391
01:44:08,467 --> 01:44:10,508
- very troublesome.
- Mmm.

1392
01:44:12,342 --> 01:44:13,758
I appreciate your concern,

1393
01:44:13,842 --> 01:44:16,050
but all the money in the world
won't help us now.

1394
01:44:16,175 --> 01:44:18,508
It's not money I'm offering.

1395
01:44:18,592 --> 01:44:20,133
You.

1396
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:23,008
You are a man of faith,

1397
01:44:23,092 --> 01:44:26,008
and I have been
very blessed lately.

1398
01:44:29,342 --> 01:44:32,092
I want to share
my blessing with you.

1399
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:35,717
The power of positive thinking.

1400
01:44:39,508 --> 01:44:41,633
Now...

1401
01:44:41,717 --> 01:44:45,175
tell me, Mr. President,
what do you need?

1402
01:44:45,258 --> 01:44:48,717
And you're not speaking to me
here, but to the universe.

1403
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,175
What do you wish for?

1404
01:44:53,425 --> 01:44:56,175
What is there to wish for but more?

1405
01:44:56,258 --> 01:44:58,383
More nuclear weapons.
More than they have.

1406
01:44:58,467 --> 01:45:00,092
Closer to 'em.

1407
01:45:00,175 --> 01:45:02,050
If I just had that in place,

1408
01:45:02,133 --> 01:45:04,258
then they would
have to listen to us.

1409
01:45:04,342 --> 01:45:07,550
A nice thought.
And I grant you...

1410
01:45:10,383 --> 01:45:11,717
Oh... Oh, my...

1411
01:45:16,675 --> 01:45:20,008
And you know what I'd like?

1412
01:45:20,092 --> 01:45:24,217
I would want all of your power,
influence, authority.

1413
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:25,633
All the respect you command

1414
01:45:25,717 --> 01:45:30,050
and the command
everyone must respect.

1415
01:45:35,758 --> 01:45:38,717
I mean, what else is there?

1416
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,592
Now, tell your people
I would appreciate

1417
01:45:41,675 --> 01:45:45,425
absolutely no interference
whatsoever.

1418
01:45:45,508 --> 01:45:47,800
No taxes, no rule of law,
no limits.

1419
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:52,550
Treat me like a foreign nation
with absolute autonomy.

1420
01:45:53,842 --> 01:45:55,175
Very good, sir.

1421
01:45:55,258 --> 01:45:56,383
Right away.

1422
01:46:03,967 --> 01:46:05,133
What's this?

1423
01:46:05,217 --> 01:46:06,467
Global Broadcast Satellite.

1424
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:08,092
Top-secret program
that enables us

1425
01:46:08,175 --> 01:46:10,175
to override any broadcast
system in the world

1426
01:46:10,258 --> 01:46:14,133
in case we need direct contact
with the people of an enemy state.

1427
01:46:14,217 --> 01:46:15,383
So what does that mean?

1428
01:46:15,467 --> 01:46:17,758
You're taking over
everyone's TVs?

1429
01:46:17,842 --> 01:46:19,008
How?

1430
01:46:19,092 --> 01:46:20,550
It uses
particle beam technology,

1431
01:46:20,633 --> 01:46:22,550
just like
the Star Wars program.

1432
01:46:22,633 --> 01:46:25,925
Apparently, it bathes the landscape
in a signal of particles that goes in

1433
01:46:26,008 --> 01:46:28,800
and fiddles with
any technology it touches.

1434
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:31,717
New or old.
Broadcast whatever you want.

1435
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:33,300
Very impressive.

1436
01:46:33,383 --> 01:46:37,883
You said "touches"?

1437
01:46:37,967 --> 01:46:41,050
As in the particles
you are sending...

1438
01:46:43,633 --> 01:46:48,258
are touching everything?

1439
01:46:48,342 --> 01:46:49,800
It's a figure of speech,

1440
01:46:49,883 --> 01:46:51,467
but yes.

1441
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:52,967
- That's how it was explained to me.
- I need immediate access

1442
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:55,633
to this satellite.
And a chopper

1443
01:46:55,717 --> 01:46:56,925
to get me there.

1444
01:46:57,008 --> 01:46:58,300
Yes, sir. Right away.

1445
01:47:08,925 --> 01:47:10,842
Well, aren't you resourceful?

1446
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:14,217
Come with me before you do
any more damage, Max.

1447
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:15,883
No. I don't think so.

1448
01:47:15,967 --> 01:47:17,633
Remove this woman, please...

1449
01:47:17,717 --> 01:47:19,592
permanently.

1450
01:47:28,425 --> 01:47:30,758
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

1451
01:47:33,925 --> 01:47:35,092
No, Steve. You can't use that.

1452
01:47:35,175 --> 01:47:37,758
It's not their fault.

1453
01:48:25,383 --> 01:48:26,717
That's neat.

1454
01:49:00,050 --> 01:49:01,633
Barbara.

1455
01:49:04,675 --> 01:49:06,592
I can't let you do this, Diana.

1456
01:49:37,258 --> 01:49:40,050
Barbara. What...

1457
01:49:40,133 --> 01:49:43,133
- How...
- I can't let you stop Max.

1458
01:49:43,217 --> 01:49:45,883
You're not the only one
with something to lose.

1459
01:49:49,425 --> 01:49:51,800
Turns out wishing
to be like you...

1460
01:49:53,008 --> 01:49:55,092
came with some surprises.

1461
01:49:58,592 --> 01:49:59,842
Hands up.

1462
01:49:59,925 --> 01:50:01,175
- Hands up.
- Hands up, hands up.

1463
01:50:01,258 --> 01:50:02,342
Hands up!

1464
01:50:02,425 --> 01:50:04,258
- Hands up!
- Now! Now, now!

1465
01:50:17,842 --> 01:50:19,217
Open fire!

1466
01:50:33,967 --> 01:50:37,175
Oh, how sweet,
defending your love. Huh?

1467
01:50:37,258 --> 01:50:40,133
What do you wish for?
Do you wanna be a real boy?

1468
01:50:40,217 --> 01:50:41,633
No.

1469
01:50:41,717 --> 01:50:44,050
Just not to be handcuffed to
you, but now I am.

1470
01:50:51,675 --> 01:50:53,467
I just learned that.

1471
01:51:05,550 --> 01:51:06,967
Barbara, stop!

1472
01:51:09,467 --> 01:51:10,633
Ahh!

1473
01:51:18,258 --> 01:51:19,342
Listen.

1474
01:51:19,425 --> 01:51:20,383
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

1475
01:51:20,467 --> 01:51:21,758
I'm not what you think.

1476
01:51:21,842 --> 01:51:23,092
You can't possibly
understand or handle...

1477
01:51:23,175 --> 01:51:25,258
Oh, I can't
possibly understand?

1478
01:51:28,842 --> 01:51:29,967
Oh...

1479
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:31,675
Dumb little old me.

1480
01:51:31,758 --> 01:51:33,258
Dumb little, poor little

1481
01:51:33,342 --> 01:51:35,300
nothing, nobody me.

1482
01:51:35,383 --> 01:51:36,925
I couldn't possibly handle it.

1483
01:51:37,008 --> 01:51:39,633
No, Barbara.
That's not what I'm saying.

1484
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:48,425
Well,
I'm handling it beautifully.

1485
01:51:48,508 --> 01:51:50,217
And I'm not giving it back!

1486
01:52:14,508 --> 01:52:15,425
Go.

1487
01:52:16,425 --> 01:52:17,467
Run!

1488
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:19,883
Everyone, stand down.

1489
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:22,800
Nobody hurts her.

1490
01:52:24,383 --> 01:52:26,633
They couldn't if they tried.

1491
01:52:31,050 --> 01:52:33,092
You've always
had everything,

1492
01:52:33,175 --> 01:52:36,175
while people like me
have had nothing.

1493
01:52:36,258 --> 01:52:40,675
Well, now it's my turn.
And you are not taking it from me. Ever!

1494
01:52:42,258 --> 01:52:44,008
But what is it costing you?

1495
01:52:44,092 --> 01:52:45,550
What is it costing me?

1496
01:52:45,633 --> 01:52:49,008
If it's the monkey's paw,
it takes as much as it gives.

1497
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:53,925
Yes, you're strong...

1498
01:52:54,008 --> 01:52:57,050
but what did you lose, Barbara?

1499
01:52:57,133 --> 01:53:00,675
Where's your warmth, your joy,

1500
01:53:00,758 --> 01:53:02,258
your humanity?

1501
01:53:02,342 --> 01:53:06,217
You're attacking innocent men,
Barbara. Look at yourself.

1502
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:08,217
Forget about me.

1503
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:10,550
What is it costing you?

1504
01:53:15,592 --> 01:53:18,092
Yeah, yeah.

1505
01:53:18,217 --> 01:53:20,092
That's right.

1506
01:53:20,842 --> 01:53:22,925
Get used to it.

1507
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:28,008
If you go after Max Lord...

1508
01:53:28,758 --> 01:53:31,092
or hurt him in any way,

1509
01:53:31,175 --> 01:53:32,717
I will destroy you.

1510
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:33,842
Barbara!

1511
01:53:51,133 --> 01:53:53,008
Are you all right?

1512
01:54:14,383 --> 01:54:16,550
Room for one more?

1513
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:26,342
<i>Sir, you need to wait.</i>

1514
01:54:26,425 --> 01:54:27,717
The President has
a meeting right now.

1515
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:28,717
We need
to see the President.

1516
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,342
He needs to be told.

1517
01:54:30,425 --> 01:54:32,258
- This is a matter of life and death.
- What is going on?

1518
01:54:32,342 --> 01:54:35,258
The Soviets' early detection
system picked up our new nukes.

1519
01:54:35,342 --> 01:54:37,300
<i>What new nukes?</i>

1520
01:54:37,383 --> 01:54:39,842
<i>A hundred warheads just went
online, ready to launch.</i>

1521
01:54:39,925 --> 01:54:42,133
<i>They're taking this
as an act of war.</i>

1522
01:54:42,217 --> 01:54:43,758
Prepping to return fire.

1523
01:54:43,842 --> 01:54:45,467
Return? What?

1524
01:54:45,550 --> 01:54:47,508
We haven't done anything.

1525
01:54:47,592 --> 01:54:49,092
That's not how it looks.

1526
01:54:49,175 --> 01:54:51,592
And we'd fire for less.

1527
01:54:54,508 --> 01:54:56,175
Are you kidding me?

1528
01:54:56,258 --> 01:54:58,133
You blew through that light right there!
You didn't even see!

1529
01:54:58,217 --> 01:54:59,550
How do you not see that?

1530
01:54:59,633 --> 01:55:01,467
Riots across
the world erupting

1531
01:55:01,550 --> 01:55:05,217
as America and the Soviet Union
end communication,

1532
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:07,217
declaring war!

1533
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:08,883
No one knows
any more than that.

1534
01:55:08,967 --> 01:55:10,967
But as you can imagine
with what's at stake,

1535
01:55:11,050 --> 01:55:13,342
there has been
madness down here

1536
01:55:13,425 --> 01:55:14,800
in downtown Washington, D.C.

1537
01:55:14,883 --> 01:55:16,717
The national guard
has been brought in...

1538
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:19,467
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

1539
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:21,800
<i>By executive order,
all civilians</i>

1540
01:55:21,883 --> 01:55:25,258
<i>must immediately evacuate the
Pennsylvania Avenue corridor</i>

1541
01:55:25,342 --> 01:55:28,175
<i>between 3rd
and 12th streets northwest.</i>

1542
01:55:36,133 --> 01:55:38,550
It is the final days
of tribulation

1543
01:55:38,633 --> 01:55:40,758
that is happening to us now.

1544
01:55:40,842 --> 01:55:44,300
Can you see
what your sinfulness has done?

1545
01:55:44,383 --> 01:55:45,925
Your greed?

1546
01:55:46,008 --> 01:55:48,717
You gotta do something!
You gotta do something!

1547
01:55:49,925 --> 01:55:52,925
Come on! This way! Come on!

1548
01:55:57,633 --> 01:55:59,342
Riley!

1549
01:55:59,425 --> 01:56:00,967
All units.

1550
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:02,008
Riley!

1551
01:56:02,092 --> 01:56:04,425
We need help.

1552
01:56:04,508 --> 01:56:07,092
- It's chaos out here.
- Riley!

1553
01:56:07,175 --> 01:56:10,842
What do you want me to do?
I don't know what to do.

1554
01:56:10,925 --> 01:56:13,175
Somebody help me.

1555
01:56:13,258 --> 01:56:15,550
I don't know what to do.

1556
01:56:19,842 --> 01:56:21,342
Diana.

1557
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:24,133
Diana, listen to me.

1558
01:56:28,717 --> 01:56:32,133
I had a great life.

1559
01:56:33,092 --> 01:56:34,175
Steve...

1560
01:56:34,258 --> 01:56:36,883
And you only made it better.

1561
01:56:38,467 --> 01:56:41,717
But you know
what you need to do.

1562
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:43,383
The world needs you.

1563
01:56:48,175 --> 01:56:50,342
- All right?
- No.

1564
01:56:50,425 --> 01:56:52,092
Yeah.

1565
01:57:04,925 --> 01:57:06,633
I'll never love again.

1566
01:57:06,717 --> 01:57:08,717
I pray that isn't true.

1567
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:11,842
There's a wonderful,
big world out there.

1568
01:57:11,925 --> 01:57:15,508
This crazy new world.

1569
01:57:15,592 --> 01:57:18,800
And I am so happy
I got to see it...

1570
01:57:19,675 --> 01:57:21,883
but it deserves you.

1571
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:33,842
I can't say goodbye.

1572
01:57:33,925 --> 01:57:36,758
I can't say goodbye.

1573
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:39,508
You don't have to.

1574
01:57:43,508 --> 01:57:46,175
I'm already gone.

1575
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:02,050
I'll always love you, Diana,

1576
01:58:02,133 --> 01:58:05,008
no matter where I am.

1577
01:58:05,092 --> 01:58:06,842
I love you.

1578
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:12,217
I renounce my wish.

1579
01:59:07,092 --> 01:59:08,508
<i>It's easy.</i>

1580
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,717
<i>It's only wind and air...</i>

1581
01:59:15,175 --> 01:59:17,092
<i>and how to ride it.</i>

1582
01:59:19,133 --> 01:59:21,300
<i>How to catch it.</i>

1583
02:00:34,342 --> 02:00:35,675
You made a wish too, huh?

1584
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:41,758
They're a bitch, aren't they?

1585
02:00:41,842 --> 02:00:45,425
Make you pay a price,
but I've never been one for rules.

1586
02:00:45,508 --> 02:00:47,675
Luckily, I have a way
to reverse it.

1587
02:00:49,092 --> 02:00:51,550
The answer is always more.

1588
02:00:51,633 --> 02:00:53,258
But you only get one wish.

1589
02:00:53,342 --> 02:00:56,133
But I, my dear,
grant the wishes.

1590
02:00:56,217 --> 02:00:59,342
So I take
what I want in return.

1591
02:00:59,425 --> 02:01:02,342
There's nothing in this world
someone doesn't have.

1592
02:01:02,425 --> 02:01:06,050
I'll rebuild my health,
wish by wish, organ by organ...

1593
02:01:06,842 --> 02:01:08,217
if I have to.

1594
02:01:09,592 --> 02:01:11,342
I'll be invincible.

1595
02:01:12,758 --> 02:01:14,342
Tell me,

1596
02:01:14,425 --> 02:01:16,467
what do you want?

1597
02:01:16,550 --> 02:01:18,800
I'm feeling generous.

1598
02:01:22,008 --> 02:01:26,300
I don't want to be
like anyone anymore.

1599
02:01:28,342 --> 02:01:30,758
I want to be number one.

1600
02:01:33,425 --> 02:01:36,133
An apex predator,

1601
02:01:36,217 --> 02:01:39,717
like nothing
there's ever been before.

1602
02:01:40,925 --> 02:01:43,550
I like the way you think.

1603
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,258
Go on.

1604
02:01:58,967 --> 02:02:02,717
You heard we were
coming, I presume?

1605
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,800
How many broadcasting signals
can I take over at once?

1606
02:02:05,883 --> 02:02:08,133
Well, as many as you like, sir.

1607
02:02:08,217 --> 02:02:09,758
I'll take all of them.

1608
02:02:09,842 --> 02:02:11,592
All of them?

1609
02:02:11,675 --> 02:02:15,967
And I sure wish this works
for me. Don't you?

1610
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:17,925
Yes, sir.

1611
02:02:20,925 --> 02:02:23,092
Lights, camera...

1612
02:02:23,175 --> 02:02:24,800
Okay, stations 12,

1613
02:02:24,883 --> 02:02:26,925
9, 16, go transmit.

1614
02:02:27,008 --> 02:02:29,842
I need it now.
16, 9, 12. Do you receive?

1615
02:02:29,925 --> 02:02:31,217
Copy. Maximum power.

1616
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:32,550
Okay. Moving forward now.

1617
02:02:32,633 --> 02:02:34,300
Global transmission in five,

1618
02:02:34,383 --> 02:02:36,967
four, three, two...

1619
02:02:40,758 --> 02:02:43,050
<i>Citizens of the world,</i>

1620
02:02:43,133 --> 02:02:47,592
<i>allow me to introduce myself.</i>

1621
02:02:47,675 --> 02:02:50,258
<i>I am Max Lord,</i>

1622
02:02:50,342 --> 02:02:52,925
<i>and I'm here
to change your life.</i>

1623
02:02:53,842 --> 02:02:56,550
<i>All you have to do...</i>

1624
02:02:57,592 --> 02:02:59,592
<i>is make a wish.</i>

1625
02:03:00,758 --> 02:03:03,508
<i>Anything you want.</i>

1626
02:03:03,592 --> 02:03:06,217
<i>Anything you dream of,
you can have it.</i>

1627
02:03:07,550 --> 02:03:09,300
<i>If you can dream it...</i>

1628
02:03:09,383 --> 02:03:10,342
Daddy?

1629
02:03:10,425 --> 02:03:13,008
<i>...you can achieve it.</i>

1630
02:03:13,092 --> 02:03:15,967
<i>So just look into my eyes...</i>

1631
02:03:17,133 --> 02:03:19,550
<i>and make a wish.</i>

1632
02:03:19,633 --> 02:03:22,967
<i>Anything you dream of,</i>

1633
02:03:23,050 --> 02:03:24,175
<i>have it.</i>

1634
02:03:25,675 --> 02:03:28,300
<i>Right now.</i>

1635
02:03:28,383 --> 02:03:31,300
<i>Do you want to be rich?</i>

1636
02:03:31,383 --> 02:03:34,467
<i>Do you want to be powerful?</i>

1637
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:36,133
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever you say.

1638
02:03:36,217 --> 02:03:37,633
- <i>Say it out loud!</i>
- You know what I wish?

1639
02:03:37,717 --> 02:03:39,175
- What? What?
- I wish all you Irish bastards

1640
02:03:39,258 --> 02:03:41,633
would get sent back
to where you came from!

1641
02:03:41,717 --> 02:03:43,133
Yeah? Well, I wish
you'd drop dead!

1642
02:03:43,217 --> 02:03:46,258
<i>Look around you.</i>

1643
02:03:46,342 --> 02:03:48,675
<i>Make your wish!</i>

1644
02:03:48,758 --> 02:03:50,592
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

1645
02:03:50,675 --> 02:03:52,592
<i>Whatever you want,</i>

1646
02:03:52,675 --> 02:03:54,258
<i>you can have it.</i>

1647
02:03:54,342 --> 02:03:56,175
I wish for a million dollars.

1648
02:04:01,717 --> 02:04:03,342
<i>Wish for it.</i>

1649
02:04:15,925 --> 02:04:18,217
<i>Anything you want.</i>

1650
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:22,592
<i>Anything you dream of, have it.</i>

1651
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:24,675
<i>Yes.</i>

1652
02:04:24,758 --> 02:04:26,217
<i>I can hear it.</i>

1653
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:29,050
<i>I hear you.</i>

1654
02:04:29,133 --> 02:04:30,217
<i>Yes, say it.</i>

1655
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:32,050
<i>Say it out loud.</i>

1656
02:04:32,133 --> 02:04:33,925
That's right.
"I wish."

1657
02:04:35,467 --> 02:04:36,425
Take it.

1658
02:04:36,508 --> 02:04:38,800
Take it. It's all yours.

1659
02:04:38,883 --> 02:04:40,717
It's all yours for the taking!

1660
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:48,258
And I... I take your health

1661
02:04:48,925 --> 02:04:51,133
and your strength.

1662
02:04:51,217 --> 02:04:52,800
Give her your rage

1663
02:04:52,883 --> 02:04:54,800
and your prowess.

1664
02:04:54,883 --> 02:04:57,800
And I take your power.

1665
02:04:57,883 --> 02:05:00,008
I take your life force.

1666
02:05:00,092 --> 02:05:01,925
Yes.

1667
02:05:02,008 --> 02:05:03,508
Yes!

1668
02:05:05,842 --> 02:05:07,633
That's right.

1669
02:05:07,717 --> 02:05:10,425
You're doing great.

1670
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:18,300
<i>It's all yours.</i>

1671
02:05:18,383 --> 02:05:19,842
I wish you were here, Daddy.

1672
02:05:19,925 --> 02:05:21,800
I wish you'd come back.
Daddy, please!

1673
02:05:21,883 --> 02:05:24,967
- <i>All you have to do is wish for it.</i>
- I'm still here, Daddy.

1674
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:26,883
Daddy, please!

1675
02:06:40,425 --> 02:06:42,425
Barbara.

1676
02:06:43,175 --> 02:06:45,550
What did you do?

1677
02:08:33,050 --> 02:08:34,050
No.

1678
02:08:35,425 --> 02:08:37,633
You renounced your wish.

1679
02:08:37,717 --> 02:08:40,633
I had to. And so do you.

1680
02:08:40,717 --> 02:08:44,300
Nothing good is born
from lies, Barbara.

1681
02:08:44,383 --> 02:08:47,133
We're wasting precious time.

1682
02:08:47,217 --> 02:08:51,467
Even now, patronizing me.

1683
02:10:21,133 --> 02:10:22,883
Barbara...

1684
02:10:22,967 --> 02:10:24,758
I know you're in there. Please.

1685
02:10:24,842 --> 02:10:26,592
Please, renounce your wish.

1686
02:10:26,675 --> 02:10:28,008
It's over.

1687
02:10:28,092 --> 02:10:30,050
Please!

1688
02:10:30,133 --> 02:10:31,883
Renounce your wish.

1689
02:10:31,967 --> 02:10:33,217
Never!

1690
02:10:36,425 --> 02:10:38,342
Then I'm so sorry.

1691
02:11:21,175 --> 02:11:22,675
That's right.

1692
02:11:22,758 --> 02:11:24,467
Just wish for it.

1693
02:11:24,550 --> 02:11:26,008
It's yours now.

1694
02:11:27,217 --> 02:11:29,758
All you have to do is
say it out loud.

1695
02:11:29,842 --> 02:11:32,383
Make a wish. Any wish.

1696
02:11:32,467 --> 02:11:35,717
Look into my eyes,
and everything you've been waiting for,

1697
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:37,383
it's all yours.

1698
02:11:37,467 --> 02:11:38,425
You're too late.

1699
02:11:40,175 --> 02:11:42,008
Granted.

1700
02:11:42,925 --> 02:11:44,383
Granted.

1701
02:11:45,175 --> 02:11:46,967
Granted.

1702
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:49,592
Granted!

1703
02:11:49,675 --> 02:11:52,342
- Granted.
- Why are you doing this?

1704
02:11:52,425 --> 02:11:54,133
Don't you have enough?

1705
02:11:54,217 --> 02:11:56,050
Why not more?

1706
02:11:56,133 --> 02:11:57,800
Why not wish for more?

1707
02:11:57,883 --> 02:12:00,300
But they don't know
what you're taking from them.

1708
02:12:00,383 --> 02:12:02,467
We want what we want.

1709
02:12:02,550 --> 02:12:04,258
Just like you did.

1710
02:12:06,342 --> 02:12:07,842
So make a wish.

1711
02:12:07,925 --> 02:12:09,008
Very good.

1712
02:12:19,133 --> 02:12:21,175
Granted.

1713
02:12:23,133 --> 02:12:25,758
It's too late, Diana.

1714
02:12:25,842 --> 02:12:28,425
They already heard me.

1715
02:12:28,508 --> 02:12:30,883
Already wished!

1716
02:12:32,758 --> 02:12:36,842
And those that haven't yet...

1717
02:12:38,967 --> 02:12:42,092
oh, they will!

1718
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:57,342
Granted.

1719
02:12:57,425 --> 02:12:59,467
Granted.

1720
02:13:00,508 --> 02:13:01,967
Granted.

1721
02:13:07,717 --> 02:13:10,008
Poor Diana.

1722
02:13:10,967 --> 02:13:13,300
Why be such a hero?

1723
02:13:14,508 --> 02:13:17,217
You could have kept your pilot

1724
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:18,925
and your powers,

1725
02:13:19,008 --> 02:13:22,217
if only you'd join me.

1726
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:25,550
Wanna reconsider?

1727
02:13:26,550 --> 02:13:29,758
I'm a forgiving man!

1728
02:13:33,717 --> 02:13:35,800
You want him back?

1729
02:13:35,883 --> 02:13:38,342
Just say the word.

1730
02:13:38,425 --> 02:13:41,008
You can have it all!

1731
02:13:41,092 --> 02:13:45,300
You just have to want it!

1732
02:13:47,342 --> 02:13:50,633
I've never wanted
anything more.

1733
02:13:56,508 --> 02:13:59,467
But he's gone...

1734
02:13:59,550 --> 02:14:02,592
and that's the truth.

1735
02:14:02,675 --> 02:14:04,967
And everything has a price.

1736
02:14:05,050 --> 02:14:07,550
One I'm not willing to pay.

1737
02:14:07,633 --> 02:14:09,217
Not anymore.

1738
02:14:15,925 --> 02:14:21,133
This world was a beautiful
place just as it was...

1739
02:14:22,217 --> 02:14:25,592
and you cannot have it all.

1740
02:14:25,675 --> 02:14:29,258
You can only have the truth.

1741
02:14:29,342 --> 02:14:32,300
And the truth is enough.

1742
02:14:32,383 --> 02:14:34,717
The truth is beautiful.

1743
02:14:37,717 --> 02:14:39,883
So look at this world...

1744
02:14:41,217 --> 02:14:45,675
and look at what your wish
is costing it.

1745
02:14:45,758 --> 02:14:49,633
You must be the hero.

1746
02:14:49,717 --> 02:14:53,258
Only you can save the day.

1747
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:57,675
Renounce your wish

1748
02:14:57,758 --> 02:14:59,883
if you want to save this world.

1749
02:14:59,967 --> 02:15:02,342
Why would I...

1750
02:15:02,425 --> 02:15:06,175
when it's finally my turn?

1751
02:15:07,675 --> 02:15:11,217
The world belongs to me!

1752
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:15,300
You can't stop me. No one can!

1753
02:15:16,675 --> 02:15:18,758
I wasn't talking to you.

1754
02:15:26,425 --> 02:15:29,883
I was talking to everyone else.

1755
02:15:34,050 --> 02:15:37,342
<i>Because you're not the only one
who has suffered.</i>

1756
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:40,175
<i>Who wants more.</i>

1757
02:15:44,133 --> 02:15:47,300
<i>Who wants them back.</i>

1758
02:15:48,967 --> 02:15:52,092
<i>Who doesn't want
to be afraid anymore.</i>

1759
02:15:55,550 --> 02:15:57,550
<i>Or alone.</i>

1760
02:15:57,633 --> 02:15:59,050
<i>Stop!</i>

1761
02:15:59,133 --> 02:16:01,425
Cut the signal! Stop!

1762
02:16:01,508 --> 02:16:03,550
Or frightened.

1763
02:16:03,633 --> 02:16:06,217
Or powerless.

1764
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:09,967
'Cause you're not the only one
who imagined a world

1765
02:16:10,050 --> 02:16:13,383
where everything was different.

1766
02:16:17,883 --> 02:16:19,175
<i>Better.</i>

1767
02:16:19,258 --> 02:16:21,842
<i>Finally.</i>

1768
02:16:25,175 --> 02:16:29,425
<i>A world where they were loved</i>

1769
02:16:29,508 --> 02:16:32,758
<i>and seen, and appreciated.</i>

1770
02:16:33,383 --> 02:16:34,342
Finally.

1771
02:16:34,425 --> 02:16:36,425
<i>Oh, my God. Who is he?</i>

1772
02:16:36,508 --> 02:16:38,758
He doesn't even speak English.

1773
02:16:38,842 --> 02:16:40,592
What is he eating?

1774
02:16:40,675 --> 02:16:41,758
Look at his shoes!

1775
02:16:43,133 --> 02:16:44,175
Weirdo!

1776
02:17:03,758 --> 02:17:07,633
<i>But what is it costing you?</i>

1777
02:17:07,717 --> 02:17:10,217
Do you see the truth?

1778
02:17:22,342 --> 02:17:23,342
<i>Daddy!</i>

1779
02:17:25,050 --> 02:17:26,967
<i>Daddy!</i>

1780
02:17:36,925 --> 02:17:40,717
The Russians are launching.
We've got orders to counter.

1781
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:42,633
All right, all right.

1782
02:18:00,217 --> 02:18:02,133
Alistair!

1783
02:18:03,425 --> 02:18:04,883
<i>Emergency alert.</i>

1784

<i>You have four minutes
to find shelter.</i>

1785
02:18:12,092 --> 02:18:14,342
Alistair!

1786
02:18:14,425 --> 02:18:16,592
My son!

1787
02:18:16,675 --> 02:18:19,550
<i>Stay calm
and stay indoors.</i>

1788
02:18:19,633 --> 02:18:21,342
Alistair!

1789
02:18:21,425 --> 02:18:24,342
<i>Daddy! Daddy!</i>

1790
02:18:24,425 --> 02:18:25,467
Help me, Daddy!

1791
02:18:25,550 --> 02:18:27,175
<i>This is not a test.</i>

1792
02:18:27,258 --> 02:18:28,342
Daddy!

1793
02:18:30,967 --> 02:18:32,383
<i>Daddy!</i>

1794
02:18:32,467 --> 02:18:34,258
<i>One-minute warning.</i>

1795
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:37,258
Wait. My son!

1796
02:18:37,342 --> 02:18:39,175
I can see my son!

1797
02:18:39,258 --> 02:18:41,092
Save him, Max.

1798
02:18:42,633 --> 02:18:44,300
I have to save my son.

1799
02:18:44,383 --> 02:18:45,967
<i>Daddy!</i>

1800
02:18:46,050 --> 02:18:47,217
Alistair.

1801
02:18:47,300 --> 02:18:49,550
Daddy!

1802
02:18:49,633 --> 02:18:50,717
Daddy!

1803
02:18:51,383 --> 02:18:54,175
My... Alistair.

1804
02:18:55,467 --> 02:18:57,842
I renounce my wish!

1805
02:19:12,508 --> 02:19:14,217
I renounce my wish.

1806
02:19:17,508 --> 02:19:20,133
We have missiles
disappearing, sir.

1807
02:19:21,133 --> 02:19:22,383
Yes, sir.

1808
02:19:22,467 --> 02:19:24,717
<i>They are vanishing
from our screen.</i>

1809
02:19:28,175 --> 02:19:30,592
<i>Only just hearing
now that a ceasefire</i>

<i>between the Soviet Union
and the United States</i>

1811
02:19:33,133 --> 02:19:35,758
<i>has averted
a global nuclear crisis.</i>

1812
02:19:37,592 --> 02:19:39,425
I renounce my wish.

1813
02:19:57,592 --> 02:19:58,967
- I take back my wish.
- I renounce my wish.

1814
02:20:21,258 --> 02:20:23,550
Alistair!

1815
02:20:30,092 --> 02:20:32,008
Alistair!

1816
02:20:32,425 --> 02:20:35,050
Alistair!

1817
02:20:37,508 --> 02:20:38,508
Daddy!

1818
02:20:45,008 --> 02:20:46,925
- Daddy!
- Alistair!

1819
02:20:51,050 --> 02:20:52,800
Alistair.

1820
02:20:55,967 --> 02:20:58,008
Oh, Alistair, Alistair.

1821
02:20:58,092 --> 02:21:00,508
I'm so sorry, baby.

1822
02:21:02,425 --> 02:21:06,633
I'm so glad I wished you'd come.
I knew it would work.

1823
02:21:09,592 --> 02:21:10,675
No.

1824
02:21:11,758 --> 02:21:13,800
That is not why I'm back.

1825
02:21:14,467 --> 02:21:15,550
No.

1826
02:21:17,425 --> 02:21:19,633
I've been lying to you.

1827
02:21:21,050 --> 02:21:24,175
I'm not a great guy.

1828
02:21:24,258 --> 02:21:27,092
In fact, I'm a pretty
messed up, loser guy.

1829
02:21:29,092 --> 02:21:31,883
And I made terrible mistakes.

1830
02:21:32,717 --> 02:21:34,467
But you...

1831
02:21:36,342 --> 02:21:40,133
you don't ever have to make
a wish for me to love you.

1832
02:21:41,592 --> 02:21:44,133
I'm here because I love you.

1833
02:21:46,467 --> 02:21:48,425
I just...

1834
02:21:48,508 --> 02:21:50,675
I just wish and I pray that,
one day,

1835
02:21:50,758 --> 02:21:52,342
I'll be able to
make you proud enough

1836
02:21:52,425 --> 02:21:55,133
that you'll be
able to forgive me.

1837
02:21:56,592 --> 02:21:58,425
And love me.

1838
02:21:58,508 --> 02:22:01,467
Because I'm nothing
to be proud of, Alistair.

1839
02:22:01,550 --> 02:22:04,592
I don't need you
to make me proud.

1840
02:22:04,675 --> 02:22:07,133
I already love you, Daddy.

1841
02:22:07,217 --> 02:22:09,425
You're my dad.

1842
02:22:56,383 --> 02:22:59,133
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Sorry.

1843
02:22:59,217 --> 02:23:01,675
It's okay. It's okay.

1844
02:23:06,717 --> 02:23:08,967
So beautiful.

1845
02:23:14,050 --> 02:23:18,633
Sorry.
Just talking to myself.

1846
02:23:20,883 --> 02:23:22,758
It's all right.

1847
02:23:22,842 --> 02:23:24,550
It's just that...

1848
02:23:24,633 --> 02:23:29,633
It's wonderful.
It's so many things.

1849
02:23:30,592 --> 02:23:32,133
Yeah.

1850
02:23:33,133 --> 02:23:35,175
I know what you mean.

1851
02:23:40,550 --> 02:23:42,508
I like your...

1852
02:23:42,592 --> 02:23:43,800
I like your outfit.

1853
02:23:44,342 --> 02:23:46,008
You like...

1854
02:23:46,092 --> 02:23:47,092
Thanks.

1855
02:23:47,175 --> 02:23:49,050
You know, my friends...

1856
02:23:49,133 --> 02:23:52,508
they kinda tease me about it,
but it works, right?

1857
02:23:52,592 --> 02:23:54,467
- You look great.
- Thank you.

1858
02:23:54,550 --> 02:23:57,008
You just made my day.

1859
02:24:04,717 --> 02:24:07,717
- Happy holidays. See you around.
- Happy holidays.

1860
02:24:47,675 --> 02:24:50,883
So many things.

1861
02:24:53,258 --> 02:24:56,925
So, so many things.

1862
02:26:32,925 --> 02:26:34,842
- Whoa!
- Look out!

1863
02:26:37,592 --> 02:26:39,092
Oh, my God.

1864
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:42,717
- Mom, would you take her?
- Yeah.

1865
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:44,383
Um, excuse me.

1866
02:26:44,467 --> 02:26:47,633
Excuse me. Please,
you have to let me thank you, Miss...

1867
02:26:48,967 --> 02:26:50,092
Asteria.

1868
02:26:50,175 --> 02:26:52,925
Asteria. Wow.
That's a beautiful name.

1869
02:26:53,008 --> 02:26:54,467
It's from my culture.

1870
02:26:54,550 --> 02:26:56,925
I can't thank you enough.
I mean, you saved my daughter.

1871
02:26:57,008 --> 02:26:58,758
How did you do that?

1872
02:26:58,842 --> 02:27:02,842
It's just a simple shift of weight.
Takes practice.

1873
02:27:02,925 --> 02:27:06,342
But I've been
doing this a long time.
