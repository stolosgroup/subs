00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:09,216
(male presenter, off)
There is a fifth dimension

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,510
Beyond that
Which is known to man.

4
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:14,555
It is a dimension
As vast as space

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,349
And as timeless as infinity.
6s
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:21,186
It is the middle ground
Between light and shadow

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,480
Between science
And superstition

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,233
And it lies between
The pit of man's fears

8
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,486
And the summit
Of his knowledge.

9
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,406
This is the dimension
Of imagination

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,993
It is an area
Which we call
The twilight zone.

Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,185
Special July clean up sale!

16
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,353
Lovely things,
Calamine lotion,

17
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,607
Good for sunburns!

18
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,109
How about binoculars?

Street scene

Summer, the present.

00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:17,201
Man on the sidewalk
Named Lou Bookman.

22
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,370
Age, sixtyish.
Occupation, pitchman.

23
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,083
Lou Bookman,
A fixture of the summer.

24
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,086
A rather minor component
To a hot July.

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,880
A nondescript
Commonplace little man,

26
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,673
Whose life is a treadmill

27
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,135
Built out of sidewalks.

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,012
In just a moment,
Lou Bookman

29
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,681
Will have to concern
Himself with survival.

30
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,476
Because as of 3 o'clock
This hot July afternoon

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,313
He'll be stalked
By Mr. Death.

Hi, Lou!

35
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,796
(Lou)
Hello, darling!
Oh, here, here.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,589
Oh, my goodness,
It is hot today!

37
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,757
Yeah.

38
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,051
Let's sit down.

39
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,847
What are you
Selling today, Lou?

40
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,890
Toys, Lou?
Are you selling toys?

41
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,478
I'll show you
What I was selling.
[chuckles]

42
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,646
There's one for you.

43
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,189
Thanks, Lou!

44
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,191
That's alright, Maggie.
Here, ricky.

45
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,901
Thanks, Lou!

46
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,779
Now the Lou Bookman
Social and ice cream hour

47
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,948
Takes place
Right after supper.

48
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,117
The regular
Turn now!

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,326
Don't forget!

50
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,786
Goodbye.

51
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,371
(chiidren)
Bye, Lou.

52
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,707
(Lou)
Don't forget
The ice cream, huh?

53
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,878

[intense ominous music]

55
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,032
You're, you're
The man I saw
On the sidewalk today.

56
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,742
You were writing
In a book.

57
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,702
You are Lou Bookman,
Aren't you?

58
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,537
That's right.
Louis J. Bookman,

59
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,372
Is there something
I can show you?

60
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,334
Maybe something
In collar stays?
I'll get that.

61
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,003
No, Mr. Bookman.
I'm not here
To buy anything.

62
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,088
Now let's get
To business, shall we?

63
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,217
Louis J. Bookman,
Aged 69, right?

64
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,510
I'll be 70
In September.

65
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,847
Hm. Occupation,
Pitch man, right?

66
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,058
Yeah, that's right.
[chuckies]

67
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,684
Are you
A census taker?

68
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,021
Born in New York
City in 1890.

69
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,857
That's right, 1890.

70
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,069
Father Jacob Bookman,
Mother Flora Bookman.

71
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,446
Father's place of birth,
Detroit, Michigan,

72
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,115
Mother's place of birth
Syracuse, New York, right?

73
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,534
That's right.
My goodness,
[chuckies]

74
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,536
You got it all down
In that book there.

75
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,206
Yes, we have to keep
These things efficient.

76
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,542
Now today
Is the 19th of July.

77
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,003
And your departure's
At midnight tonight.

78
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,297
My departure?

79
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,049
[knocking at door]

80
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,176
Oh, excuse me.

81
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,056
Hi, Maggie!

82
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,891
The key's bad, Lou.
Can you fix it?

83
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,768
Oh, sure,
Come on right in!

84
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,103
Come on in.
(chuckles)

85
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,273
Let me see it.

86
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,566
Well, there's your
Trouble right there.

87
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,902
See that little cogwheel?

88
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:43,407
Well, you've been pushing
In that key when you were
Winding it. You see?

89
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,700
See? Now
It's all right.

90
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,785
See?

91
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,413
I'd introduce
You two, only I
Don't know your name.

92
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,747
No need.

93
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,708
I think I got it
Now, Lou.

94
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,752
This gentleman
Came here to ask me
A lot of questions.

95
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,462
What gentleman?

96
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,006
[ominous music]

97
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,382
That gentleman!

98
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,678
What gentleman?

99
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:08,348
(Mr. Death)
Mr. Bookman, she can't
See me or hear me.

100
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,850
Why not?

101
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,643
Why not what, Lou?

102
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,520
Why can't you
See him or hear him?

103
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,523
See who, Lou?

104
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,775
It works great now, Lou.

105
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,361
Thanks an awful lot.
See you after supper, huh?

106
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,031
Now wait a minute.
You haven't forgot
Your manners.

107
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,782
Aren't you gonna
Say goodbye?

108
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,951
Oh, yeah.
Good bye, Lou.
Thanks a lot!

109
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,370
No, no, I mean
To the gentleman there.

110
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,456
Oh, it's a game.

111
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,459
The invisible man.
Goodbye, invisible man.

112
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,877
See you
After supper, Lou.

113
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,968
[suspense music]

114
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:49,556
I can see you,
Yet she can't.

115
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,976
(Mr. Death)
Only those who are
To accompany me
Can see me.

116
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,228
Understand, Mr. Bookman?

117
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,606
Uh, Mr. Bookman,

118
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,695
Only those that are
To accompany me can see me.

119
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,074
Now don't you think
You ought to start making
Your arrangements?

120
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,742
Arrangem ents?
For what?

121
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,244
For your departu re.

122
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,580
My departure where?

123
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,207
[sighs]
You just don't get it.

124
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,334
I just will never
Understand you people.

125
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,087
You get the idiotic notion
That life goes on forever.

126
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,463
Of course, it doesn't.

127
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,048
Everyone has
To go sometime.

128
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,008
Go? You mean--

129
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,761
That's right.
And what I further
Don't understand

130
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,680
How little you appreciate
The nature of your departure.

131
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,558
Think of all
The poor souls who
Go in violent accidents.

132
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,227
The non precognition victims.

133
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,270
We're not permitted
To forewarn them.

134
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,732
You, Mr. Bookman,
Fall into the category

135
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,359
Of "natural causes."

136
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,069
"natural causes?"

137
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,863
Number one, I find you
A very devious sort,

138
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,448
Number two,

139
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,242
I think that
You're dishonest.

140
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:54,287
Number three,
Why don't you say
What you mean!

141
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,707
Mr. Bookman, I've done
Everything but phone
Your own undertaker.

142
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,543
How much clearer
Do you want it?

143
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,336
If you still
Don't know who I am

144
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,922
Then you're the dumbest
Man I've come up against.

145
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,678
[intense ominous music]

146
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,729
You are--
You're death?

147
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,107
Exactly, Mr. Bookman.

148
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,986
Now, shall we get
Down to business?

149
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,905
Time of departure
Is midnight tonight.

150
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,824
I trust that
Will suit you.

151
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,577
Preordination is
For death during sleep.

152
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,580
I assume this too
Will meet with
Your approval.

153
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,791
You'll find
This a relatively
Simple and painless--

154
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,793
No, just a minute.
I don't wanna go!

155
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,837
No, they never do.

156
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,840
But there's
No reason to go.
I'm a very healthy man!

157
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,260
Outside of a slight cold
I had last winter,

158
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,472
And a sliver that festered
In that finger there,

159
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,057
I don't think I've had
A sick day in 20 years!

160
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,684
That may be,

161
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,936
But departure time
Is set for midnight.

162
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,230
And departure
Will be midnight.

163
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,524
Don't I have anything
To say about that?

164
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,693
We do listen to appeals

165
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,446
But frankly, Mr. Bookman,
There's very little here

166
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,698
In the way of an
Extenuating circumstance.

167
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,117
There are three major
Categories of appeals.

168
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,619
One, is hardship cases.

169
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,621
Now do you
Have a wife or family

170
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,957
Who might suffer beyond
A reasonable point
Your demise?

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,920
[softiy]
No, no family. No.

172
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,381
The second category
Is priority cases

173
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,551
Statesmen, scientists,
Men on the verge
Of discoveries.

174
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:37,891
I take it you're not working
On any major scientific
Pursuit at the moment.

175
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,143
[softly]
No [chuckles] no.

176
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,646
[firmly]
What's the third category?

177
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,982
I don't think you're
Qualified here either.

178
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,402
Unfinished business
Of a major nature.

179
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,906
You don't have
Any unfinished
Business, do you?

180
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,032
Ah, but I do!

181
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,492
Indeed I do!

182
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,161
That's it,
You see. I-- yeah.

183
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,413
I have some
Unfinished business.

184
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,208
Unfinished business, yes.

185
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,589
I've never flown
In a helicopter. That's it.

186
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,258
I've never flown--

187
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,760
(death)
Insufficient, Mr. Bookman.

188
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,348
Anything else?

189
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,102
Now you look here.
I've lived in this
Room for 21 years.

190
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,897
And you keep popping up
In corners of the room
I've never even seen before.

191
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,732
Will you please
Stay in one place?

192
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,527
Is there anything
Else, Mr. Bookman?

193
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,070
Yes, yes.

194
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,948
I have never seen
A Zulu war dance.

195
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,409
Now that's
The answer right there.

196
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:41,079
So you'll have to give
Me a couple of months to go
Over to that Zulu country

197
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,373
No?

198
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,917
No. Unfinished business
Of a major nature

199
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,128
Is something a man
Had yearned for

200
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,964
And something
He might accomplish
Given an extension.

201
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,842
Well, there is one thing.

202
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,219
What is it, Mr. Bookman?

203
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,055
Well, between you and me,

204
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,766
I never made
A truly big pitch.

205
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,644
I mean, I mean
A big pitch.

206
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,898
A pitch big enough
For the skies to open up.

207
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,402
You know,
A pitch for the angels.

208
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,071
Of course,
It wouldn't mean
Very much to you,

209
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,906
But it would mean
A great deal to me.

210
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,242
It would mean
That for one moment

211
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,163
In my whole life
I would have done
Something successful.

212
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:28,293
It would mean
That maybe the children
Would be very proud of me.

213
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,503
The children?

214
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:34,424
Yes, yes, I've always
Had quite a fondness
For children, you know.

215
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,635
Yes, that's all
Here in the record.

216
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,972
The problem here,
Mr. Bookman, is that
You'd require delay until--

217
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,932
Until I make a pitch!

218
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,518
The kind of pitch
I was talking to you about.

219
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,978
The one for the angels?

220
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,564
That's right.
One for the angels.

221
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,361
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Bookman,

222
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,196
But, no.

223
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,992
You see, these categories
Are very specific

224
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,496
And when reference is made
To unfinished business
Of a major nature,

225
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,581
The only I nterpretation
To be made here

226
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,166
Is simply that--

227
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,545
What-- what I mean
Is that, uh,

228
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,631
Unfortunately, Mr. Bookman,

229
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,509
An ability to, to succeed

230
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,386
In a given
Professional venture

231
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,180
Is really hardly
Of a major--

232
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,395
Mean a great
Deal to you, does it?

233
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,814
A great deal.

234
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,740
All right,
Mr. Bookman.

235
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,785
Under the circumstances
I believe I can grant
You a delay.

236
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,704
Until--

237
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,040
What do you mean 'until?'
Until you've made this pitch.

238
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,750
I can live til then?

239
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,502
That's the agreement.

240
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,005
Oh, well I think
That's a fine bargain.

241
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,049
I didn't get your name.

242
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,094
Now, about
This pitch, Mr. Bookman,

243
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,388
When might
We expect it?

244
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,098
When?

245
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,059
Oh, soon.
You know.

246
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:12,230
Maybe not this year, maybe
Not for a couple of years,
[chuckles] but soon.

247
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,859
I have the very odd feeling
That you're taking
Advantage of me.

248
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,777
Oh, you have?
Well, that's a pity,

249
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,698
Because I am!

250
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,117
You'll never catch me
Making a pitch anymore.

251
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,036
You think you can
Fool me, eh?
[chuckles]

252
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,372
I'll hardly open
My mouth from now on.

253
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,623
[mischievous music]

254
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,959
Really, Mr. Bookman?

255
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,795
This is much more
Serious than you imagine.

256
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,057
It's much more complex
Than you realize, what
You've just done.

257
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,573
Here I've gone
Out of my way to help you

258
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,283
And this is the way
You repay me?

259
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,632
Mr. Bookman.

260
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,301
It won't just end here,
You understand?

261
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,179
There will be
Consequences, you see?

262
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:30,600
FYI, that means
For you in formation

263
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,937
You made your bed
And you shall have
To sleep in it.

264
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,065
We made a bargain
That I don't have to go
Until I make a pitch.

265
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,526
And you'll have to wait
Until I make that pitch.

266
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,905
I can say this
Without the least
Fear of contradiction.

267
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,699
Have you got
A long wait!
[chuckles]

268
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,868
That may well be,
Mr. Bookman,

269
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,620
But since you won't
Come with me,

270
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,498
I've been forced
To select an alternative.

271
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,583
[brakes screeching
And woman yelling]

272
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,630
[people shouting]

273
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,721
Maggie!

274
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,807
I swear
I didn't see her.

275
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:14,477
She jumped right
Off the curb and I
Had no chance to stop.

276
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,397
I swear to you
I never had no
Chance to stop at all.

277
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,482
Well, then someone
Send for a doctor!

278
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,859
Get an ambulance.

279
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,318
I'll call one.

280
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,748
(Lou)
You're gonna be
All right, darling.

281
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,667
You're gonna
Be just fine.

282
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,586
Hi, Lou.

283
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,087
Hello, sweetheart.

284
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,340
[intense ominous music]

285
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,885
Lou?

286
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,094
Yes?

287
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,221
Who's that man?

288
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,473
[ominous music]

289
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,352
Do you see him?

290
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,688
Yes, Lou.

291
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,656
Hey, wait a minute.

292
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,074
You can't take her.

293
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,285
No, siree,
You can't take her.

294
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,038
Now listen, I'll go.
Never mind the pitch.

295
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,290
I don't even want to wait,
I'll go right now.

296
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,208
You can't take her.

297
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,294
I'll go with you, I'll--

298
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,646
[ominous music]

299
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,821
(man)
How's Maggie, doctor?

300
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,740
(doctor)
I can't tell.
I can't tell.

301
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,664
Doctor?

302
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,166
It's hard to tell.
She's a very sick
Little girl,

303
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,127
But we'll know
Soon, she should have
A crisis by midnight.

304
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,337
By midnight?

305
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,755
I think by then.

306
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,762
He won't come here.
I won't let him come here.

307
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,688
[suspense music]

308
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,747
[intense ominous music]

309
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,503
Good evening,
Mr. Bookman.

310
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,130
You've got
Business in there?

311
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,965
I most certainly do.

312
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:53,594
It's quarter to 12:00.
In 15 minutes, midnight.

313
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,179
That's my appointment.

314
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,645
Mr. Death, that little
Girl's only 8 years old.

315
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,189
I'm ready now.

316
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,401
I'm sorry, Mr. Bookman,
But I had to make
Other arrangements.

317
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,319
It's impossible
To change them now.

318
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,572
She's to come
With me at midnight,

319
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,324
So I must be
In there at midnight.

320
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,994
And if you're
Not in there?

321
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,163
It would be pretty
Much unheard of.

322
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,166
You see,
If I didn't get in there
At precisely midnight,

323
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,752
Then the whole
Timetable would
Be upset.

324
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,545
It's unheard of.

325
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,839
It's unheard of?

326
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,345
What are you
Doing, Mr. Bookman?

327
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,639
I'm just setting up
A pitch, that's all.

328
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,433
At this time
Of night?

329
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:44,687
Oh, I very often
Have a late sale.
Very often!

330
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,065
Not many customers.

331
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,108
Oh, they'll be here.

332
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,360
They'll come round--
You're here, anyway.

333
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,362
Oh, yes, I'm here.

334
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,032
But I'm afraid
I'm not much of a customer.

335
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,451
How do you know?
Have you seen my stock?

336
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:02,288
Take this lovely tie
Here, for instance.

337
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,374
Oh, oh, excuse me.

338
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,214
What does that
Look like to you?

339
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,465
It looks like a tie.

340
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,675
Feel it.

341
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,888
So--

342
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,307
Ladies and gentlemen,

343
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,392
If you will
Feast your eyes

344
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,395
On probably the most
Exciting invention

345
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,064
Since atomic energy.

346
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:32,235
A simulated silk
So fabulously conceived

347
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,739
As to mystify
Even the ancient
Chinese silk manufacturers.

348
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,368
An almost unbelievable
Attention to detail!

349
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:45,039
It has a wonderful
Work of weaving.

350
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,959
[suspense music]

351
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:01,305
(Lou)
Witness, if you
Will, a demonstration
Of tensile strength.

352
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,474
Feel that if you will, sir.

353
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,519
Unbelievable, isn't it?

354
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,480
As strong as steel.

355
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,359
Yet as fragile
And delicate
As Shantung silk.

356
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,696
(Lou)
Picture if you will
300 years

357
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,323
Of backbreaking
Research and labor,

358
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,992
To develop this.

359
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,452
The absolute
Ultimate in strength.

360
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,204
And what would
You expect to pay

361
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,291
For this fabulous,
I say fabulous, incredible,

362
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,210
Amazing development
Of the tailor's art?

363
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,129
Would you pay
30 dollars a spool?

364
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,298
25? 20? 10?

365
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,717
Well, very well
You might, sir,

366
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,386
If you were trying
To purchase this
At stores.

367
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,348
But this fantastic thread
Is not available in stores.

368
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,809
It is smuggled in
By Oriental birds

369
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,228
Especially trained
For ocean travel.

370
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:53,232
Each carrying a bit
Quantity in a small satchel

371
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,984
Underneath their
Ruby throats.

372
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,862
It takes 832 crossings

373
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,407
To supply enough thread
To go around one spool.

374
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,576
And tonight,
At my special

375
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,121
Get acquainted, introductory,
Mid-July hot
Summer sale

376
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,415
I offer you this
Fabulous thread

377
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,209
Not at 20
Dollars a spool,

378
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,502
Not at 10, not at 5,

379
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,673
But at the ridiculously
Low price of 25
Cents a spool.

380
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,593
I'll take all you have.

381

(Lou)
Sewing needles, yarn,

382

Marvelous plastic shoelaces,
Genuine static eradicator

383
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,268
Will fit
Any standard radio,

Suntan oil,
Eczema powder,

385

Razors, athlete's
Feet destroyer,

386
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,150
How about some nice
Simulated Kashmir socks--

387
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,194
All right, all right.
I'll take it all.

388
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,238
All of it.
Right there.

389
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,741
(Lou)
And now for
The piece de resistance.

390
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,912
An item never before
Offered in this or any
Other country.

391
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:53,167
One guaranteed
Live human man saver.

392
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,335
How's that?

393
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,878
For what I ask

394
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,881
You sir, receive
A willing, capable,

395
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,842
Worldly, highly sophisticated,
Wonderfully loyal

396
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,636
Right hand man

397
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,806
To use in any
Capacity you see fit.

398
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,974
How's that?

399
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,141
Me!

400
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,643
Lou is J. Bookman,

401
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,395
The first model
Of his kind,

402
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,815
He comes to you
With an absolute guarantee

403
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,109
All parts interchangeable.

404
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,653
With a certificate of 4 years
Service ability

405
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,613
He eats little,
He sleeps little,

406
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,156
He rests only occasionally,

407
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,492
And there he is
At your elbow

408
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,245
At you beck and call
Whenever you need him.

409
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,580
Mr. Bookman, you are
A persuasive man.

410
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,166
I challenge
Any other store

411
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,127
Wholesale house
Or industry

412
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,338
To even come
Close to matching
What I offer you here.

413
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,590
Because my dear man,

414

I offer you, I offer you--

415
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,272
It's midnight!

416
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,733
It's midnight and I've
Missed my appointment!

417
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,869
Give her the sedatives
Every three hours,
Mrs. Polansky.

418
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,621
She'll be all right.
She just needs a lot
Of rest now.

419
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,709
[bells continue to toll]

420
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,838
She's all right.

421
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,513
One minute past
12:00, Mr. Bookman.

422
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,849
And you made me
Miss my appointment.

423
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,476
Thank god.

424
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,395
A most persuasive
Pitch, Mr. Bookman.

425
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,022
An excellent pitch.

426
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,900
Yes, it's quite a pitch,
Very effective.

427
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,861
It's the best
I've ever done.

428
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,989
It's the kind of a pitch
I've always wanted to make.

429
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,240
A big one.

430
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,034
A pitch so big,

431
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,828
So big that the sky
Would open up.

432
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,997
A pitch for the angels.

433
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,416
That's right,
A pitch for the angels.

434

[soft melancholy music]

435
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,047
Well, I guess it's
Time for me now.

436
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,341
As per our agreement.

437
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:08,177
Well, I'm ready.

438
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,137
After you, Mr. Bookman.

439
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,518
Oh, excuse me,
I forgot something

440
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,894
I'll be back in a minute.

441
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:26,320
You never know
Who might need
Something up there.

442
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,780
Up there?

443
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,365
Up there, Mr. Bookman.

444
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,866
You made it.

Louis J. Bookman,

446

Age, sixtyish,
Occupation, pitchman.

447
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,966
Formally, a fixture
Of the summer,

448
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,719
Formally, a rather minor
Component to a hot July.

449
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,557
But throughout his life
A man beloved by the children

450
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:58,227
And therefore,
A most important man.

451
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,062
It couldn't happen, you say?

452
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,565
Probably not
In most places,

453
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,733
But it did happen

454
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,237
In the twilight zone.

Rod Serling,
The creator
Of twilight zone,

456
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,497
Will tell you
About next week's story

457
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:22,084
After this word
From our alternate sponsor.

458
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,752
And now, Mr. Serling.

459
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,380
Next week, we invite
You to take a walk

460
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,090
Down a western
Frontier street

461
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,134
At the elbow
Of a doomed gun man.

462
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,345
Whose salvations lies
In nothing less than
A magic potion,

And a colt 45.

Next week
On the twilight zone.

466
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,024
We hope you'll
Be able to be with us.
Thank you and good night.

00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:26,352
The tobacco is soothed
For the softest taste of all.

473
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:30,606
And menthol
Misting makes it so.

474
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,442
[relaxing music]

475
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,486
(male presenter, off)
This is an oasis.

476
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,780
Cool. Refreshing.

477
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,825
This is an oasis, too.

478
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,788
Just as the mist of mountain
Dew refreshes a flower,

479
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,540
Keeps it fresh all day,

480
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,001
So the tobacco
In oasis is misted,

481
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:56,382
Gently misted
All over with menthol.

482
00:27:56,466 --> 00:28:01,303
The tobacco is soothed
For the softest taste of all.

483
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:05,224
And menthol misting
Makes it so.

484
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:09,061
That's oasis,
The only filter cigarette

485
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:14,233
That's oasis cool,
Oasis mild,
Oasis fresh.

486
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:22,741
Buy oasis,
Try oasis,
Most refreshing cigarette?

487
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:26,412
Oasis, the tobacco
Is soothed with the softest
Taste of all.

488
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,707
Menthol misting makes it so.

489
