2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,963
This is the first one that I started
when I was 13.

3
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,299
And it says,

4
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,094
"My life, my career, my... my dream...

5
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,055
...my reality."

6
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,143
For a while, I wrote with quill and ink.

7
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,021
That was a phase I went through.
Like, I had a glass quill

8
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,689
with, like, an ink jet.

9
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,529
You know, my entire moral code,
as a kid and now,

10
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,658
is a need to be thought of as good.

11
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,828
That's dangerous. That's not...
That's dangerous for you.

12
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,083
It was all I wrote about.
It was all I wanted.

13
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,918
It was the complete and total...

14
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,088
belief system
that I subscribed to as a kid.

15
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,382
Do the right thing.

16
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,926
Do the good thing.

17
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,513
And obviously,
I'm not a perfect person by any stretch,

18
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,475
but overall, the main thing
that I always tried to be was...

19
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,975
um...

20
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,479
like, just...

21
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,356
like, a good girl.

22
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,947
<i>And now,

23
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,617
<i>a multitalented performing artist

Hey, everybody.

26
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,542
- Um...
- Hi, Taylor.

27
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,668
You know,

28
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,880
one of my first memories of country music
was when I was six years old,

29
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,299
and my parents took me
to see LeAnn Rimes in concert.

30
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,135
Guitar!

31
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,346
I... am...

32
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,013
happy!

<i>...twelve-year-old Taylor Swift!</i>

34
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,101
Whoo!

35
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,064
Hey, everybody. I'm Taylor.

36
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:30,066
<i>I'd been trained to be happy
when you get a lot of praise.</i>

37
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,860
Hi, Taylor.

38
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,989
See, that's...
that's Sony Music, right there.

39
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,160
Sony is gonna listen to her CD today.

40
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,374
<i>I had that praise of, "Taylor,
you're doing a good job at your work."</i>

41
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:50,044
Hey, this is Taylor Swift, and thanks
for listening to Cat Country 98.1.

42
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,703

at being a musician."</i>

44
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,219
<i>Like, those pats on the head
were all I lived for.</i>

45
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,097

right here, look at that.

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,601

<i>- Good morning.</i>

76
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,941
I've just been, like,
running up and down stairs,

77
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,277
like, moving things around,
unpacking boxes, like...

78
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,409
...trying not to think about you calling me
with Grammy nominations.

00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,681
- This is good. This is fine.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

86
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,433

87
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,994

<i>So, do you want me to call you right back

Sure.

99
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,547

00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,905

I don't need a rest. I'm fine.

142
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,541
This means it's working.

00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:30,588
Honey! How are you? Oh, honey!

144
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,215
Aw, hi, honey.

a </i>colossal<i> failure.</i>

148
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,776
Maybe first I could talk to you
about, um, kind of new album stuff.

149
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,861
There's gonna be from...

150
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,990
from 16 to 20 songs on it...

151
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,034
is what I'm guessing
it's gonna end up at.

152
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,828
- It's a lot.
- Let's get it done.

153
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,664
That's what...
that's what I was hoping for.

154
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,094
Everybody in music
has their own sort of...

155
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,930
niche specialty thing that they do...

156
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,892
that, you know,
sets them apart from everybody else.

157
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,980
And...
my storytelling is what it is for me.

158
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,317
I-I... I know that,
without me writing my own songs,

159
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,611
I wouldn't... be here.

160

<i>♪ We can leave the Christmas lights up

164
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,630
There is an element
to my fan base

165
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,674
where we feel like we grew up together.

166
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,566
I'll... I'll be going through something,
write the album about it,

167
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,345
and then it'll come out, and...

168
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,015
sometimes it'll just coincide
with what they're going through.

169
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,474
Kind of...

170
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,978
Kind of like they're reading my diary.

Okay.

177
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,421
This is a song I wrote yesterday,

178
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,716
and... it's about a girl
who's just different.

179
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,843
And I really like it

180
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,637
because it's just s-so happy.

181
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,600
So, this is called "Lucky You."

187
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,374
I have to be honest with you,
this song was seriously finished

188
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,667
five minutes ago.

189
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,212
So, you know,
I usually have these things memorized,

190
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,757
but... I just finished it
five minutes ago, so...

191

195
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,234
I started playing guitar
and wrote a couple songs,

196
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,819
and I've written 150 songs

197
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,737
and written every song
on this album, so...

198
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,614
You were a freshman
when you wrote this?

199
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:47,451
I actually came up with the concept for it
in math class my freshman year.

200
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,412
You know, I've had a single out now
for about a month.

201
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,747
Yeah!

202
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,875
There's this radio station called KZLA.

203
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,087
I want each and every one of you
to call 'em up...

204
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,298
and tell 'em you wanna hear a song
called "Tim McGraw"

205
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,968
by this girl named Taylor Swift.

206
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,847

A 16-year-old girl released
her debut country music album

211
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,447
and dreamed of making it big.

212
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,868
Well, today that girl
is as big as it gets.

213
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,744
In the past year, she has taken Nashville

214
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,289
and country music
on an unforgettable trip around the world.

215
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,292
<i>She went on
to sell more than any artist this year.</i>

216
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,095
<i>That made her
the youngest person</i>

217
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,629
<i>to write and perform
a number one country song.</i>

218
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,008
I give myself, like, five seconds a day
to be like, "Yes, this is happening!"

219
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,944
And then the rest of the day,

220
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,095
I'm trying to figure out
how I'm gonna make it last.

221
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,973

I always dreamed
about what it would be like

00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,790
to maybe win one of these someday,

but Beyoncé had one of the best videos

262
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,565
One of the best videos of all time!

263
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,870
I was standing onstage,

264
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,707
and I was really excited
because I had just won the award,

265
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,960
and then I was really excited
because Kanye West was on the stage.

266
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,211
And then I, um...

267
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,714
then I wasn't so excited anymore.

268
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,306
Hey, Taylor,
are there any hard feelings towards him?

269
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,684
I-I don't know him,
and I-I've never met him, so...

270
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,936
- So, were you a fan before?
- Um...

271
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,959
- ...yeah.
- Oh.

272
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,149
- He's Kanye West.
- Mm-hmm.

273
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,151
Are you still a fan? I take it no?

274
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,047
You know, I just... I don't know him,
and I don't wanna start anything

275
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,865
'cause I just, you know,
I had a great night tonight.

276
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,618
Everyone is talking
about this Kanye West thing, aren't they?

277
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,869
In case you're lucky enough

278
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,914
to have missed it,
Kanye West interrupted a young singer

279
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,332
named Taylor Swift while she...

280
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,585
President Obama
calling Kanye West a "jackass."

281
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,171
I can name you ten or 15 people

282
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,590
that he wouldn't have gone up
and taken that mic away from.

283
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,551
But he did it with a 17-year-old girl
because he could.

284
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,893
It was so echoey in there.

285
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,522
At the time, I didn't know
they were booing <i>him </i>doing that.

286
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,774
I thought that they were booing <i>me.</i>

287
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,569
For someone who's built
their whole belief system

00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,739
on getting people to clap for you,

289
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,200
the whole crowd booing...

290
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,743
is a pretty...

291
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,287

- Of course I eat burritos.

369

- Some people don't.
- Who doesn't eat burritos?

370
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:10,305
Um, I didn't ever eat burritos

I just had never tried one.

- That's the weirdest niche thing.
- Yeah.

00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,606
Mm-mm.

375
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,401

Oh.

- No.

Twenty-nine? I remember those days.

382

How do you feel about that?

383
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,465
I mean...

384
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,552
yeah, there's a part of me
that feels like I'm 57,

385
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,195
but there's a part of me that's like...

386
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,141
definitely not ready to have kids,

387
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,309
definitely not ready
for all this grown-up stuff.

388
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,477
- Yeah.
- So...

389
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,189
I don't think anybody's ever ready
for that stuff.

390
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,109
You just figure it out
when it happens.

391
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,195
I kind of don't really have
the luxury of...

392
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,490
...figuring stuff out
because my life is planned, like, in...

393
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,334
- like, two years ahead of time.
- Mm.

394
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,743
Like, literally, in two months,

395
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,867
they'll come to me with the dates
for the next tour.

396
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,789
- Right.
- They'll be like, "So...

397
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,958

398

or whatever year, you know?

399
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,296

- Wow. Yeah.

400

00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,692
- Incoming.
- Yup.

404
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,527
I got it.

405
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,446
- Whoa. Oh.
- Oh, no!

406
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,780
No!

407
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,867
Not the steak!

408
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,452
No, no, not on your forehead!

409
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,872
Yeah, well, I don't know. I...
Either that or the lap. I don't know.

410
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,058
- Oh, shit.
- This is a Rihanna shirt.

411
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,751
Oh, my God, it's all over me.

412
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,046
Want a bite? Want a bite?

413
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,590
She goes, "What is the panic?"

414
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:13,178
She did a better job of bracing herself
for takeoff than we did.

415
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,931
It is like traveling
with a pony.

416
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,974
But I love her.

417
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,185
- Oh, I know.
- But I love her.

418
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:24,022
She's... Okay, so what you're...
what you're seeing here... is...

419
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,275
...is exactly what Mom decided to do

420
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,152
when both of her kids were out
of the house.

421
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:33,782
She decided to get a third child,
like, a human-sized dog.

422
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,825
She's actually my cancer dog.

423
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,120
After I... found that out, I...

424
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,873
I decided to, um...

425
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,835
to do something I'd always wanted to do,
which was...

426
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,088
get a-a really big dog.

427
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,341
- That's good, Mom.
- Yeah. Well, that's what it is.

428
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,094
I'm happy that worked out for you.
I'm sor... sorry you had cancer.

429
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,846
I'm sorry.
That's really what it is.

430
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,601
<i>She got cancer several years ago.</i>

431
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,063
<i>That has been really hard for me</i>

432
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,567
<i>because she's my favorite person.</i>

433
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,695
On the third song,
where I hadn't gotten it started yet,

434
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,030
she goes, "Come on, Mom."

435
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,490
Like, into the microphone.

436
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,162
<i>It woke me up from this...</i>

437
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,082
<i>this life where I used to sweat
all these things.</i>

438
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,334
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing, babe?

439
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,004
<i>But, like, do you really care</i>

440
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,132
<i>if the Internet doesn't like you today</i>

441
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,594
<i>if your mom's sick from her chemo?</i>

442
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,929
Cheers!

443
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,351
- She looks like you.
- Oh, she's just like you, Kitty!

444
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,023
<i>You gotta be able to really prioritize</i>

445
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,357

446
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,903
<i>For me, it's my family and my friends.</i>

447
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,035
This is looking good, right now.

448
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,496
Would you like a glass of red wine
or white wine?

449
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,915
Can I get some white wine?
Oh, you got the red wine?

450
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,477
- Does that make me a difficult guest?
- It's for the recipe.

451
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,420
I'm happy to switch.
It's too adult for me,

452
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,963
- let's be honest.
- Yeah.

453
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,466
Oh.

454
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,718
And... ah, yes.

455
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,927
Okay, that's dinner.

456
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,824
I'm gonna get some ice
for my wine. You want any?

457
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,848
Yeah.

458
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,978
Oh, that's fine.
That's honestly just what I wanted.

459
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,938
- Yeah.
- You're like... "Uh..."

460
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,065
Eh.

461
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,002
- You know, Claire just had a baby.
- Mm-hmm.

462
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,278
And, like, I went over to see her, and...

463
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,149
How's she doing...

464
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,716
- She was just...
- ...with motherhood?

465
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,825
Well, she's the best 'cause she's like,

466
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,371
"Just so you know, this is what it is.

467
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:48,166
- You feed 'em, change 'em, they sleep.
- Yeah.

468
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,437
- You feed 'em, change 'em, they sleep.
- You do it all over. Yeah.

469
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,797
- You feed 'em." Like...
- It's just...

470
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,383
She's... And I was like,
"So, it's like a Tamagotchi?"

471
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,593
- Oh, my God.
- Like...

472
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,262
- Like, exactly, so...
- Yeah.

473
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,890
- You'd be an excellent mother.
- Thanks.

474
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,058
No questions.

475
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,353
Mmm. Mmm. This is so good.

476
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,375
- I'm gone for a month after this.
- Mm.

477
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,449
- We got three.
- Okay.

478
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,575
Huh?

479
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,911
Three paps.

480
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,080
- Three?
- Three paps now.

481
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,082
Three of 'em, you say?

482
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,669
Well, good luck sellin' this picture.

483
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,894
Oh, my God!

484
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,946
Taylor!

485
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,531
I love you!

486
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,073
Well...

487
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,745
So, this is my front yard...

488
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,790
...and...

489
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,043
I'm highly aware of the fact that
that is not normal.

490
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,714
I've learned over the years...

491
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,135
...it's not good for me

492
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:26,222
to see pictures of myself every day

493
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,766
'cause I have a tendency,

494
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,601
and it's only happened...

495
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,897
a few times,
and I'm not in any way proud of it,

496
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,064
but I get...

497
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,860
I tend to get triggered by something,
whether it's a picture of me

498
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,738
where I feel like I looked like my tummy
was too big

499
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,784
or... or, like, someone said
that I looked pregnant or something,

500
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,786
and that'll just trigger me to just...

501
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:52,373
s-starve a little bit, just stop eating.

502
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,171
I thought that I was just, like,
supposed to feel like I was gonna pass out

503
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,048
at the end of a show
or in the middle of it.

504
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,508
I thought that was how it was,

505
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,592
and now I realize:

506
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:06,262
no, if you eat food, have energy,
get stronger,

507
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,265
you can do all these shows
and not feel it.

508
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,684
Which is...

509
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,311
...a really good revelation...

510
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:18,441
because I'm a lot happier with who I am,
and I'm happier with, like...

511
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,525
I don't...

512
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,611
I don't care as much if, like...

513
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,489
somebody points out
that I have gained weight.

514
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,534
It's just something
that makes my life better,

515
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,828
the fact that I'm, you know...

516
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,832
I'm a size six
instead of a size double zero.

517
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:38,169
I mean, that... that wasn't...
how my body was supposed to be.

518
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,712
I just didn't really...

519
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,758
understand that a-at the time.
I really don't think I knew it.

520
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,847
I would've defended it to anyone
who said, "I'm concerned about you."

521
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,182
I was like, "What are you talking about?
Of course I eat.

522
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,601
It's perfectly normal.
I just exercise a lot."

523
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,021
And I did exercise a lot,
but I wasn't eating.

524
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,981
And...

525
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,401
you can't...

526
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,610
I just...

527
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:08,658
I don't think you know you're doing that
when you're doing it gradually.

528
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,287
There's always some standard of beauty

529
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,788
that you're not meeting.

530
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,374
'Cause if you're thin enough

531
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,918
then you don't have that ass
that everybody wants.

532
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,588
But if you have enough weight on you
to have an ass,

533
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,548
then your stomach isn't flat enough.

534
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,383
It's all just...

535
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,803
fucking impossible.

536
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,242
You don't ever say to yourself,
"Look, I've got an eating disorder,"

537
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,706
but you know you're, like,
making a list of everything you put

538
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,354
in your mouth that day,
and you know that's probably not right,

539
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,357
but then again, there's so many diet blogs
that tell you that that...

540
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,109
that that's what you should do.

541
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,989
This would cause me to go into, like,
a real shame...

542
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,198
like, hate spiral.

543
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,575
This.

544
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,661
And, like, I caught myself yesterday
starting to do it, and I was like,

545
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,581
"Nope, we don't do that anymore.
We do not do that anymore,

546
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,791
because it's better to look...

547
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,419
to think you look fat
than to look sick.

548
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,964
And we don't do that anymore,
and you just...

549
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,342
We're just...
We're changing the channel in our brain,

550
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,719
and we're not...
we're not doin' that anymore.

551
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,055
That didn't end us up in a good place."

552
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,354
As your career goes like this,
the magnifying glass goes like that.

553
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,901
Taylor Swift could not take herself
more seriously.

554
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,779
I think
that there's plenty of annoying women.

555
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,323
I-I think that Taylor Swift,
she is annoying.

556
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,701
She's too good.
She's too skinny. It bothers me.

557
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,663
All of her model friends.
And it's just like, come on!

558
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,866
Lock and load, boys.

559
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,666
Yo, Taylor!
You fucked him, Taylor?

560
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,269
We've got a roundup
of the guys that Miss Swifty has

561
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,962
at one point been romantic with,

562
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,506
and there are a lot of hotties
on this list.

563
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,091
Holy date life.

564
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,592
...meet the parents?

565
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,595
She's going through guys like a train.

566
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,847
- Can we get a pan down?
- It's beautiful.

567
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,725
I wanted to show the legs,
'cause as I was telling you,

568
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,436
you're gonna walk home with more
than maybe just a trophy tonight.

569
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,562
I think lots of men.

570
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,564
I'm not gonna walk home
with any men tonight.

571
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,567
Watch... watch out, guys!

572
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,070
We give you the latest
can't-look-away twist

573
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,489
in one of America's
favorite celebrity feuds.

574
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,372
<i>Kanye West
recently dissed Taylor</i>

575
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,492
<i>in his new song, "Famous."</i>

576
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:18,913
The song contains a lyric
calling Taylor Swift the b-word.

577
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,749

579
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,754
Kanye had said all along
that he got permission. Taylor denied it.

580
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,799
<i>Kim Kardashian released video

583
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,491
- <i>Oh, thanks.

584
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:41,144
<i>Um, yeah, I really appreciate it.
Like, the heads-up is so nice.</i>

585
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,564
She posted on Instagram,
"Where in the video is Kanye telling me

586
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,807
he was gonna call me 'that...

591
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:59,620
I don't buy the story
that she was so insulted by that one line.

592
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,082
I think she saw an opportunity
to be victimized here,

593
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,585
and she thought
everybody was gonna get on her side.

Fuck Taylor Swift! Fuck Taylor Swift!
Fuck Taylor Swift! Fuck Taylor Swift!

600
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,696
When people decided I was...

601
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,826
wicked and evil and conniving

602
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,329
and not... a good person,

603
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,373
that was the one
that I couldn't really bounce back from

604
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,793
'cause my whole life was centered
around it.

605
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,886
#TaylorSwiftIsOverParty
was the number one trend

606
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,179
on Twitter worldwide.

607
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,018
Know how many people have to be tweeting
that they hate you for that to happen?

608
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,325
We're people who got
into this line of work

609
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,993
because we wanted people to like us,

610
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,454
'cause we were intrinsically insecure,

611
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,040
because we liked the sound
of people clapping

612
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,918
'cause it made us forget how much
we feel like we're not good enough.

613
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,755
And I've been doing this for 15 years,
and it's just, I'm tired of it.

614
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,007
I'm just tired of the...

766
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,305
Did you know that was gonna ha...?

767
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,388
No.

768
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,308
I didn't know
that was gonna happen at all.

769
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,685
I was, like... you just, like...
High-five.

770
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,562
- Thank you.
- You guys engaged now?

771
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,248
- This is...? This...
- Yes, it's official.

772
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,816
- Oh, my God. That's amazing.
- Yes.

773
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,192
Whoa.

774
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,819
Bye, guys. Congratulations.

775
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,383
- Thank you.
- Whoa!

- Yeah.

786
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,429
My wife is from Detroit.

787
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,140
So, we talked about getting a place
to test it out.

788
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,559
And then fans found out,
and I had to leave.

789
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,483
Oh, would they...
would they just wait outside?

790
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,040
They would jump the gate
and, like, try to open our front door.

791
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,184
- And I was like, "This is not okay."
- Yeah, let's not do that. Yeah.

792
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,528
There's a difference between
"I connect with your lyrics"

793
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,631
- and "I'm going to break in."
- And "I want your blood."

794
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,532
Yeah. Yeah.

795
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:05,744
I had a crazy dude break into my apartment
and sleep in my bed a couple months ago.

796
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,454
- Oh, what?
- Didn't like it.

797
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,999
Well, you can have that apartment.

798
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,504
Oh, there it is. There's that middle.

799
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,116
I cannot believe you're even sick.

800
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,527

00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,109

00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,361
No way.
Thank you, guys. This is so cool.

826
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,381
- This is, like... I mean, I'm...
- Really good track.

827
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:27,659
...and I'm also really so excited
you're down to do, like, a massive video.

828
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,079
- Oh, yeah. That's gonna be a biggie.
- 'Cause it's not gonna be a small one.

829
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,323
- Well, it's gonna be so fun.
- Um...

830
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:36,460
My idea that I had in the beginning
is, like, it starts in an apartment.

831
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,045
Like, you and me get in a big fight.

832
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,297
I storm out, and I'm, like...

833
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:47,262
And then all of a sudden, like,
I have, like, a parade happening below.

834
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,472
Amazing, amazing.

835
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,183
- And, like, whatever makes you you...
- Yeah.

836
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,769
...you know, it's just, like, emo kids,

837
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:54,978
theater,

838
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,104
dance sequences,

839
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,856
- <i>La La Land, </i>everything.
- Nailed it!

840
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,858
And, like, when it's like, "me-ee-ee,"

841
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,319
it's like, dancers, cats,

842
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,614
gay pride,
people in country western boots.

843
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,283
I start riding a unicorn, like, just...

844
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,247
- everything that makes me me.
- Yes!

845
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,162
Five, six, seven, eight.

846
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,749
If you were to split open my imagination,

847
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,000
what would come out of it?

848
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,253
- Oh, it's so fun.
- I'm sweating now.

849
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,714
- Just like me. Oh, my God.
- I got way too excited.

850
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,798
- Okay, guys. Oh, my God.
- I got something.

851
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,469
Too excited about everything.
I feel like I'm just...

852
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:28,971
This is so cool.

853
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,060
- Uh, should I just follow you?
- Yes.

854
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,958
Just a curious cat in a...
in a big world.

855
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,171
I really, really care about my home state,

856
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,965
and I know that in this...

857
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,967
at this point in time, like,

858
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,636
my home state is a huge,

859
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,347
hugely important part
of this midterm election.

860
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:16,101
Tennessee's US senate race
figures to be crucial

861
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:19,646
in both parties' efforts to try
to control the US Senate after this year.

862
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,317
Marsha Blackburn,
a self-described hard-core conservative,

863
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,194
proclaims her support
for President Trump often.

864
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:31,450
I know the left calls me "a wingnut"
or "a knuckle-dragging conservative."

865
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,453
And you know what? I say,
"That's all right. Bring it on."

866
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,307
One of the things that, like,
outraged me so much

867
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,000
is that she voted
against the reauthorization

868
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,627
of the Violence Against Women Act,

869
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,463
which tries to protect women
from stalking,

870
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,214
from date rape, from domestic violence.

871
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,884
And then, obviously,
it's a no for gay marriage,

872
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,553
it's a no
for them to have any rights whatsoever.

873
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,806
I think I'll be really upset...

874
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,559
if people think that Tennessee...

875
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,021
stands for those things.

876
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,322
You've been very secretive
about how you vote,

877
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:11,531
what you're voting for.

878
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,993
Well, I mean,
I just figure, I'm a 22-year-old singer,

879
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,828
and, you know, I don't know

880
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,373
if people really want to hear
my political views.

881
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,496
I think they kind of just want
to hear me sing songs

882
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,002
about breakups and feelings.

883
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,298
<i>Part of the fabric
of being a country artist</i>

884
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,467
<i>is, "Don't force your politics on people.</i>

885
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,011
<i>Let people live their lives."</i>

886
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,723
<i>That is grilled into us.</i>

887
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,935
These three women have been
the reigning queens

888
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,436
of pop and country music.

889
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,272
They're the biggest-selling female artists
of all time,

890
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,526
nearly 30 million records sold
and even more fans

891
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,237
who always used to love
their high-spirited style,

892
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,656
their music, and their moxie.

893
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,618
Well, that racy magazine cover
on the stands today

894
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,453
pretty much sums up
some of the names

895
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,456
the Dixie Chicks are being called
in America these days:

896
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,501
"traitors, the Dixie Sluts,
anti-American,"

897
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,087
all because of one split-second comment

898
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,048
aimed at President Bush
right before the war with Iraq.

899
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,889
Their opinion is so ignorant.

900
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,653
They don't know
what they're talking about.

901
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,185
I think they are the Ditzy Twits.

902
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,731
These are the dumbest, dumbest bimbos,
with due respect, I have seen.

903
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,734
These are callow, foolish women
who deserve to be slapped around.

904
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:29,901
Absolutely.

905
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,095
<i>Throughout my whole career,</i>

906
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:38,160
<i>label executives
and publishers would just say,</i>

907
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,370
<i>"Don't be like the Dixie Chicks."</i>

908
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,665
<i>And... I loved the Dixie Chicks.</i>

909
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:51,131
<i>But a nice girl doesn't force
their opinions on people.</i>

910
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,800
<i>A nice girl smiles and waves</i>

911
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,177
<i>and says thank you.</i>

912
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:59,431
<i>A nice girl doesn't make people feel
uncomfortable with her views.</i>

913
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,224
It's my right to vote,

914
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,394
but it's not my right
to tell other people what to do.

915
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,354
- Right there, sister.
- Yes, thank you.

916
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,356
- Come on. Come on. Come on!
- All right.

917
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,779
<i>I was so obsessed
with not getting in trouble,</i>

918
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:14,863

919
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:18,617
<i>"I'm just not gonna do anything
that anyone could say anything about."</i>

920
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,628
I'm just getting... I'm just...

921
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,172
I'm getting to the point where I can't...

922
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,342
listen to people telling me,
"No, stay out of it.

923
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,593
Stay out of it."

924
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,770
- Yeah. Is that right? C to the A minor?
- Yeah.

925
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,813
Let me... just...
Can you not play for one second?

926
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,334
'Cause I'm trying to figure out this...
I like what I was doing,

927
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,235
but I can't figure out what key it was in.

928
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,654

Do you wanna start...
Maybe if you start a vibe...

952
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,258

953

It must be so exhausting.

954

You must have to be thinking
about this shit all the fucking time.

955
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:09,603
You are kind of doing a constant strategy
in your head

956
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,272
as to how not to be shamed
for something...

- Yeah.
- ...on any given day.

958
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:17,277
But then you get accused
of being calculated

959
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,070
- for having a strategy.
- Mm.

960
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,449
- So, it's like...
- It's just a lose-lose situation.

961
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,533
Yeah, it's...

962
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,494
I mean, I'm good, but it's been, uh...

963
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,456
You sort of do have to twist yourself
into a pretzel

964
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,292
- on an hourly basis.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

965
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,628
Do you like this for a second verse?

966
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,881
Lyric: "They'd say I hustled,

967
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,551
instead of shake their heads
and question how much of this I deserve.

968
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,054

or if I was rude.

That's it.

Taylor Swift the singer,
she goes to court today

991
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,778
against a former radio DJ
she says once groped her.

992
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,698
<i>Swift says this picture

993
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:30,535
<i>Mueller inappropriately grabbed her,
putting his hand up her skirt.</i>

994
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,122
<i>This had happened to me.
We told his boss.</i>

995
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,916
<i>They did an investigation.
He got fired,</i>

996
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,586
<i>then he sued me for millions of dollars,</i>

997
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,421
<i>so I countersued for one dollar.</i>

998
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,428
<i>You walk into a courtroom,</i>

999
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:53,266
<i>and then there's this person

<i>staring at you

1001
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,817
<i>The first thing they say to you in court</i>

1002
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,278
<i>is, "Why didn't you scream?</i>

1003
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,323
<i>Why didn't you react quicker?</i>

1004
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,576
<i>Why didn't you stand
further away from him?"</i>

1005

<i>Then he has a lawyer get up
and just lie.</i>

1006
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,796
<i>There were seven people
who saw him do this,</i>

1007
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,714
<i>and we had a photo of it happening.</i>

1008
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,301
<i>And I was so angry.</i>

1009
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,930
<i>I was angry that I had to be there.</i>

1010
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,432
<i>I was angry that this happens to women.</i>

1011
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:39,020
<i>I was angry that people are paid
to antagonize victims.</i>

1012
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,315
<i>I was angry
that all the details had been twisted.</i>

1013
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:48,446
<i>You don't feel a sense of </i>any<i> victory

1014
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,741
<i>because the process is so dehumanizing.</i>

1015
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,790
<i>This is with seven witnesses and a photo.</i>

1016

1017
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:19,769
So, um, I just wanted to...

1018
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,939
Just kind of looking back, um...

1019
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:27,610
this exact day a year ago, um...

1020
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,948
...I was, uh...

1021
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:35,368
I was not playing a sold-out stadium
in Tampa,

1022
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:40,165
I was... I was in a courtroom
in Denver, Colorado, um...

1023
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:48,381
Honestly, I-I was there
for a sexual assault case,

1024
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,465
and...

1025
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:54,554
t-this day, a year ago,
was the day that, um...

1026
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,850
...uh, the day
that the jury decided in my favor

1027
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,560
and said that they believed <i>me.</i>

1028
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,445
I guess I just think about all the people
that weren't believed,

1029
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,030
people who haven't been believed,

1030
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:15,867
or the people who are afraid to s-speak up
because they think they won't be believed.

1031
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:16,950
And...

1032
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,998
And I just...
I just wanted to say that, um...

1033
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,044
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
to anyone who ever wasn't believed

1034
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:31,174
because I don't know h... what turn
my life would have taken if somebody'd...

1035
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,926
if people didn't believe me

1036
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,261

that something had happened to me.

01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:57,570
and Tennessee's senate candidate
Marsha Blackburn is up in the polls.

1066
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,974
Congratulations, I know you've got
a little momentum going.

1067
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,409
This is the third poll in a row
that has shown you in the lead.

1068
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:08,039
My team's really not happy
with me right now.

1069
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,753
All I've talked about for the last couple
of months is the election in Tennessee.

1070
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,713
It's not that I want to step into this.

1071
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,007
I just...
I can't <i>not </i>at this point. Like...

1072
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,386
something is different in my life,

1073
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:25,682
completely and unchangeably different
since the sexual assault trial last year.

1074
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:30,436
Like, and no... no man in my organization
or in my family

1075
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,356
will ever understand what that was like.

1076
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,321
For 12 years,
we've not got involved

1077
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,656
with politics or religion.

1078
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,616
Yeah, but this is on the home front.

1079
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,536
And also,
back in the presidential election,

1080
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:49,914
I was in such a horrendous place

1081
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:53,126
that I wasn't gonna pop my head
out of the sand for anything.

1082
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,210
Why would you?

1083
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,796
I mean, does Bob Hope do it?
Did Bing Crosby do it?

1084
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,775
- Does... Does Mick Jagger do it?
- Honey, what the hell? Come on!

1085
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,069
- What I'm saying is...
- Bob Hope and Bing Crosby?

1086
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:04,178
First of all,
these aren't your dad's celebrities,

1087
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,972
and these aren't your dad's Republicans.

1088
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,016
Imagine if we came to you
and said, "Hey, we've got this idea

1089
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:12,195
that we could halve the number of people
that come to your next tour."

1090
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:15,177
The other thing,
just from a security standpoint,

1091
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,442
"Taylor Swift comes out against Trump."

1092
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,152
I don't care if they write that!

1093
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:24,031
I'm sad that I didn't two years ago,
but I can't change that.

1094
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,701
I'm saying right now

1095
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,504
that this is something
that I know is right,

1096
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,290
and, you guys,
I need to be on the right side of history.

1097
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,374
And if he doesn't win...

1098
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,627
- ...then at least I tried.
- Taylor, here's the problem.

1099
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,314
I just want to read you what I wrote,
and I'm gonna try to start...

1100
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,883
I just want you to know
that this is important to me. This is...

1101
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:43,944
- I totally agree with the issue,
- Have...

1102
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,863
- but let me explain to you...
- Have you heard her?

1103
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,305
I've read the entire thing,

1104
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,766
and the bottom line right now:
I'm terrified.

1105
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,809
I'm the guy that went out
and bought armored cars.

1106
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:55,271
I worry for her safety
as much as anybody does.

1107
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,605
Maybe more.

1108
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,942
It really is a big deal to me.

1109
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:03,738
She votes against...
against fair pay for women,

1110
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,865
she votes against
the reauthorization of the...

1111
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,575
of the Violence Against Women Act,

1112
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:09,452
which is just basically protecting us

1113
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,746
from domestic abuse
and stalking. Stalking!

1114
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:15,625
She votes... She thinks that...
that if you're a gay couple

1115
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,251
or even if you look like a gay couple,

1116
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,837
you should be allowed to be kicked out
of a restaurant.

1117
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:23,966
It's really basic human rights,
and it's right and wrong at this point,

1118
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,636
and I can't see another commercial...

1119
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:32,308
and see her disguising these policies

1120
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:35,144
behind the words
"Tennessee Christian values."

1121
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,230
Those aren't Tennessee Christian values.

1122
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,857
I live in Tennessee. I am a Christian.

1123
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,400
That's not what we stand for.

1124
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,946
I need to do this. I need you to just...

1125
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:48,708
Dad, I just need you to forgive me
for doing it, 'cause I'm doing it.

1126
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,622
- Okay, so...
- I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous.

1127
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,374
- You should be.
- Ooh.

1128
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,334
- I want to do this.
- Okay, so...

1129
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:01,146
I always have to bring up everything
that could go sideways...

1130
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,648
- everything we need to expect.
- Yeah.

1131
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,359
- One: the president could come after you.
- Fuck that, I don't care.

1132
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,426
If I get bad press for saying,

1133
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:12,056
"Don't put a homophobic racist in office,"
then I get bad press for that.

1134
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:14,576
- I really don't care.
- I would stand behind that 1,000 times.

1135
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,600
- Me too.
- Yeah.

1136
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:19,814
I think that it is so frilly
and spineless of me

1137
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:23,276
to stand onstage and go,
"Happy Pride Month, you guys,"

1138
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,902
and then not say this...

1139
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,697
when someone's literally coming
for their neck.

1140
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,780
Yeah.

1141
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,426
- All right, cheers.
- Cheers, ladies.

1142
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,786
- God help us all.
- Cheers to the resistance.

1143
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,247
To the resist... Stop it.

1144
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,082
It's gonna be okay.

1145
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,378
Oh...

1146
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:46,007
Oh, my God.

1147
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:49,343
Oh, it's so scary. This is the picture.

1148
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:54,140
- One...
- ...two, three...

1149
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:55,641
...go.

1150
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:59,812
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my goodness.

1151
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:11,198
Taylor Swift broke her silence
on politics over the weekend,

1152
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,659
publicly backing two Democrats
in Tennessee.

1153
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,579
Taylor Swift is taking
her first political stand,

1154
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:18,414
backing Democrat Phil Bredesen.

1155
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:23,169
The superstar making it clear
to her 112 million followers on Instagram,

1156
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,546
and the world, where she stands.

1157
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,341
Taylor Swift's jumping
into politics. What do you say?

1158
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:32,553
Let's say that I like Taylor's music
about 25% less now, okay?

1159
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:36,033
<i>The 28-year-old pop star
made her statement on Instagram.</i>

1160
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,857
<i>She broke
her longstanding policy</i>

1161
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:38,932
<i>of not talking politics...</i>

1162
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:40,736
<i>...using her voice in a new way.</i>

1163
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:43,481
<i>This is so out of the norm
for Taylor Swift, who...</i>

1164
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:45,983
<i>Republicans for years have thought</i>

1165
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,903
<i>that Taylor Swift
was a crypto-conservative, and she just...</i>

1166
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:51,197
<i>It is a risky move for an entertainer</i>

1167
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,324
<i>to step into politics at her age,</i>

1168
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,910
<i>- at her stage in her career.
- Vote.org reporting</i>

1169
01:05:55,993 --> 01:06:00,164
<i>more registrations in the last day
since Taylor's post than in all of August.</i>

1170
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:03,960
According to vote.org on Monday,

1171
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:08,047
nationwide there have been
51,308 new registrations

1172
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,715
- in the past 24 hours.
- Whoa!

1173
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:10,967
Yeah!

1174
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,262
- So proud of you.
- Congratulations.

1175
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,657
- Thank you.
- Go, Taylor.

1176
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,766
Do you think it'll... Do you think...

1177
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,478
I think it could, definitely.
It's your first race, so...

1178
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:25,856
I really hope it actually,
actually does something.

1179
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:30,194
But you know what?
Donald Trump likes my music 25% less.

1180
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,282
I feel 200 pounds lighter.

1181
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:38,452
I just feel like a... I just feel...
I've been feeling this way for months.

1182
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:39,829
Perez Hilton just posted,

1183
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:43,165
"Note how Republicans are attacking
Taylor Swift's intelligence

1184
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,500
instead of her ideas.

1185
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,211
They don't respect women enough
to debate them."

1186
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:49,380
Wow.

1187
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:50,881
It's not not true.

1188
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,306
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

1189
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:03,978
- Stunning and sexy.
- I look like a melted-down disco ball.

1190
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:07,773
- I love it.
- My God, you look amazing.

1191
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,442
- I am...
- Oh my God.

1192
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,420
- Gorgeous.
- ...a Pop-Tart wrapper.

1193
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,963
- Try this on that ear.
- She's got that...

1194
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,824
You know what?
This is gonna sound ridiculous,

1195
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:18,719
- but I can't move past here.
- Ooh, you got it.

1196
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,703
You got it.

1197
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,000
That's how this dress makes me feel.

1198
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,835
- Oh.
- Hmm?

1199
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,118
Can you breathe?

1200
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,338
- I can brea... I can.
- Yeah.

1201
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,758
- Is it easy? No.
- The other one's better.

1202
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:49,815
Don't block her.

1203
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:53,736
- Taylor! Taylor!
- Taylor!

1204
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,830
To your right! On your right!

1205
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,422
Taylor, look over to your right!

1206
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,467
Thank you for this.

1207
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,886
And I just wanted to make a mention
of the fact

1208
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:22,598
that this award
and every single award given out tonight

1209
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,767
were voted on by the people.

1210
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,144
And you know what else is voted on
by the people...

1211
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:32,733
...is the midterm elections
on November 6th.

1212
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,110
Get out and vote. I love you.

1213
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,621
Pre-chorus.
Six, seven, eight.

1214
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,348
One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1215
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,084
One, two, three, four five,

1216
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:53,587
six, seven, eight. Three!
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1217
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,006
Chorus.
Six, seven, eight.

1218
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,177
Yeah, I need to work on my face.

1219
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:04,557
I look like I have a mean face sometimes
when I'm not trying to.

1220
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,808
Know what I mean?

1221
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:08,852
Um...

1222
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,606
I think you might be more sensitive
than me to that.

1223
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,025
Yeah, I have a really slappable face.

1224
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,695
- Slappable? Ouch!
- Yeah, you just want to be like...

1225
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,363
"What are you plotting?

1226
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,575
What's she planning?"
I'm not meaning to look like that.

1227
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,119
You looked confident and strong.
It's the chorus.

1228
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:27,037
You got it. All right, we'll...

1229
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,248
I'm gonna try to be more likable
on the next one.

1230
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:30,875
All right, all right. Perfect.

1231
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:35,296
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight. One...

1232
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:40,593
I wish I didn't feel like
there's a better version of me out there.

1233
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,553
I feel that way all the time.

1234
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:46,473
You know what we call this?
This is "last rhino of the stampede,"

1235
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,434
up here, just...

1236
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,604
Everybody else is runnin'. Limping.

1237
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:53,689
First to get eaten.

1238
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:57,067
I keep looking down
because I'm afraid.

1239
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,277
Afrai...?

1240
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,361
And it shows.

1241
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,949
It's a lot to process
because we do exist in this society

1242
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:08,162
where women in entertainment
are discarded in an elephant graveyard

1243
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:10,365
by the time they're 35.

1244
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:13,459
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1245
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,544
Three!

1246
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:20,507
Everyone's a shiny, new toy
for, like, two years.

1247
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:34,366
The female artists that I know of

1248
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:38,651
have reinvented themselves 20 times more
than the male artists.

1249
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:40,694
They have to...

1250
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,239
or else you're out of a job.

1251
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,534
Constantly having to reinvent,

1252
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:53,457
constantly finding new facets of yourself
that people find to be shiny.

1253
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:58,379
Be new to us, be young to us,

1254
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,590
but only in a new way
and only in the way we want.

1255
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:03,092
And reinvent yourself,

1256
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,469
but only in a way
that we find to be equally comforting

1257
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:07,137
but also a challenge for you.

1258
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:10,474
Live out a narrative

1259
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:13,227
that we find to be interesting enough
to entertain us,

1260
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:16,272
but not so crazy
that it makes us uncomfortable.

1261
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:26,365
This is probably one
of my last opportunities as an artist

1262
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:29,994
to grasp onto that kind of success.

1263
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:32,996
So...

1264
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,709
I don't know, like,
as I'm reaching 30, I'm like...

1265
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:38,585
"I want to work really hard...

1266
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,920
um...

1267
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:46,427
while society is still tolerating me
being successful."

1268
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:52,391
We have another result
from the Senate. Marsha Blackburn...

1269
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:56,145
we were just talking about that...
Marsha Blackburn will win the Senate seat.

1270
01:11:56,228 --> 01:12:00,607
The Bredesen camp was very much hoping
for the "Swift lift," as they called it,

1271
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:03,986
because young voter turnout spiked here
by sevenfold

1272
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:07,239
from the previous midterm election,
and yet that wasn't enough.

1273
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:13,787
I guess Tay Tay didn't have
that much sway-sway.

1274
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:22,671
I can't believe it. I can't believe it.

1275
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:27,134
I can't believe that she gets to be
the first female senator in Tennessee

1276
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:29,094
and she's... she's Trump in a wig.

1277
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:32,181
She represents no female interests.

1278
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:37,853
She won by being a female applying

1279
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:40,981
to the kind of female
males want us to be

1280
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:44,485
in a horrendous... 1950s world.

1281
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:47,654
So, for the next two years,

1282
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,449
we have to build on what started here.

1283
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:08,050
The first verse I want to be all about,
like, hearing the news.

1284
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:11,345
You know, if you were, like,
a kid who, like, loved Beto

1285
01:13:11,428 --> 01:13:13,472
and thought that was the future
of Texas,

1286
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,641
or you really thought Stacey Abrams
was gonna win

1287
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:17,976
and you went door-to-door,
trying to make it happen,

1288
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,300
and then she still gets beat...

1289
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,247
- It didn't happen.
- And it didn't happen.

1290
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:23,232
But it's like, statistically,

1291
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,567
you know, we have, what?

1292
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:29,530
Three to four million people turning 18
in the next two years before the next one?

1293
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:30,489
So, it's like...

1294
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,492
it's basically saying, like,
"Don't lose hope. Don't get..."

1295
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:36,620
Yeah, your time will come
if you just hang in there.

1296
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:37,830
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

...called "Only the Young."

1304
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:14,825

That's basically saying, like, "Resist."

1313
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:46,690
If you can just shift the power
in your direction by being bold enough,

I just... I feel really good
about not feeling...

1352
01:16:58,071 --> 01:16:59,323
muzzled anymore.

1353
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:01,158
And it was my own doing.

1354
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:07,539
I needed to learn a lot
before I spoke to 200 million people.

1355
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:12,169
But... I've educated myself now,

1356
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:16,298
and it's time to take the masking tape
off of my mouth...

1357
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:19,092
like, forever.

1358
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:22,780
You were really major
at midterms, honey.

1359
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:23,889
Thank you.

1360
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:26,224
If you have anything I can help with,
just let me know.

1361
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,685
I think we just need to,
like, really keep talking about it

1362
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:31,647
because we really do need people
to put the pressure on those senators

1363
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,773
to pass the Equality Act.

1364
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:35,984
If they are forced to vote on it
and they do vote against it publicly,

1365
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:37,908
then it's really...
then we have their numbers,

1366
01:17:37,944 --> 01:17:39,071
you know, for next year.

1367
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:43,283
Literally,
just call me for anything,

1368
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,827
'cause you do so many good things
for people.

1369
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:51,208
All right, here we go. And... roll camera.

1370
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,336
- Rolling!
- And playback!

1371
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,129
<i>I want to love glitter</i>

1372
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:59,299
<i>and also stand up
for the double standards</i>

1373
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:01,009
<i>that exist in our society.</i>

1374
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,387
<i>I want to wear pink</i>

1375
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:06,181
<i>and tell you how I feel about politics.</i>

1376
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:10,811
<i>And I don't think that those things
have to cancel each other out.</i>

1377
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,613
How long have you been doing this?

1378
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,570
About a year.

1379
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,574
When I realized
that I really like having cute nails,

1380
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,828
but I really can't go in public.

1381
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:32,916
I will die if I get a VMA.

1382
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:35,669
Well, if we win something,
you're definitely first on the list.

1383
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:38,380
I will lose my shit.

1384
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:41,550
You don't understand.

1385
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:45,554
This is one of my favorite manis
I've ever gotten.

1386
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:47,931
I appreciate it.
Give me a good review on Yelp.

1387
01:18:48,014 --> 01:18:49,014
I will.

1388
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:51,810
- Swift Nails is the place to go.
- Yeah.

1389
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,939
- It looks so good.
- Fuck, yeah.

1390
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,070
And the VMA goes to...

1391
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,950
Taylor Swift, "You Need to Calm Down."

1392
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,455
At the end of this video,
there was a petition,

1393
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:13,206
and there still is a petition...

1394
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,084
Whoo!

1395
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:17,502
...for the Equality Act,

1396
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,046
which basically just says
we all deserve equal rights

1397
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,298
under the law.

1398
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:22,841
And...

1399
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:26,052
I want to thank everyone
who signed that petition

1400
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:29,890
because it now has
half a million signatures, which...

1401
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:35,228
...which is five times the amount
that it would need to warrant a response

1402
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:36,396
from the White House.

I'm trying to be as educated as possible
on how to respect people,

1412
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:58,752
on how to...

1413

deprogram the misogyny
in my own brain.

1414
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:07,135
Toss it out, reject it, and resist it.

1415
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:10,013
Like, there is no such thing as a slut.

1416

There is no such thing as a bitch.

1417
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:15,185
There is no such thing as someone
who's bossy, there's just a boss.

1418
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,438
We don't want to be condemned
for being multifaceted.

1419
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,376
- Sorry, that was a real soapbox.
- No.

1420

- Why did I say sorry?

- No, it's...

1422
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,699
because we're trained to say sorry.

1423
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:32,202
Yeah, we legitimately are. We're, like...

1424
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:36,122
"Sorry, was I loud...
in my own house that I bought

1425
