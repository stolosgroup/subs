2
00:02:09,644 --> 00:02:12,063
Come in.

3
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:22,891
Johnson, you're different
from the other coloureds in here.

4
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:26,286
You read books, play chess, write poetry.

5
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:34,168
But I don't believe you have any regret
whatsoever for taking a man's life.

6
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:41,592
A man who recognises his mistakes
is ready to seek God's forgiveness.

7
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:45,288
Yeah, I've read your Bible, Warden.

8
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:48,099
And?

9
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,731
It's a good book.

10
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:33,811
I need to feed my babies.

11
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:19,482
Let the men pass, son.

12
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,111
No man knoweth the moment nor the hour.

13
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:30,201
Good day to you, sir.

14
00:04:31,953 --> 00:04:36,524
I'll be damned! Bumpy Johnson!
They let your ass out, huh?

15
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:40,127
- How's business, Willie?
- People outta work play the numbers.

16
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:47,134
Batter up! This one's for you, Babe Ruth!

17
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:50,621
You gonna pay for that, Bub!

18
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:53,683
Where's the slips? Where's the slips?

19
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,898
- Call off your dogs, Bub!
- What did I tell you

20
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:04,677
about running numbers out of this place?

21
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:08,322
I was just trying to make a living
just like you, motherfucker!

22
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:17,039
You mess with Dutch Schultz,
you messin' with me!

23
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:27,008
You don't write a goddamn thing in Harlem!

24
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:31,621
Do you understand that now?

25
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:34,056
Yes.

26
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:37,768
It's a new day!

27
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:40,796
Dutch Schultz

28
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:43,466
writes policy

29
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:45,318
in Harlem!

30
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:58,247
- Keep the motor running, Cecil.
- Yes, sir.

31
00:05:58,998 --> 00:06:00,775
Ladies.

32
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,777
Very nice.

33
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:04,862
- Mr Luciano.
- Hello, Bo.

34
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:08,115
Franco, take Bambi for a walk.
OK? I'll be right out.

35
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:10,576
Watch out for all the broken glass here.

36
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:13,387
- Hey, Bobby.
- Mr Luciano.

37
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:18,584
Stand up for Mr Luciano!

38
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:22,063
Please, sit. Sit down, please. Thank you.

39
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,884
- Things are progressing here.
- Rapidly.

40
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:29,762
So you guys are doing OK?

41
00:06:29,862 --> 00:06:32,223
We make a mint.

42
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:34,433
Well, well! Cecil.

43
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:37,828
- How long it been?
- Damn near since the Ebony Earl days.

44
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:41,232
- Why the hell are you chauffeuring?
- Paying the bills.

45
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:44,668
My old lady made me put down the gun.

46
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:47,129
- Regards to Helen.
- You got it.

47
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:53,552
You won't have major trouble
with Madam Queen's people.

48
00:06:54,512 --> 00:06:55,955
Here.

49
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:58,624
Yeah, well, she's the last holdout.

50
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:02,812
- She bends to the stick, Harlem's ours.
- Hello, Dutch.

51
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:06,048
Well, well! Lucky.

52
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:09,135
- You're slumming today.
- Thought I'd stop by.

53
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:12,763
You know, for your portion
of the Dewey payment.

54
00:07:12,863 --> 00:07:17,268
Special fuckin' prosecutor. Trying to
put my ass in jail for tax evasion.

55
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:19,812
I still gotta make a fucking payoff!

56
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:24,066
Wanna keep our shirt collars clean,
we gotta have Dewey in our pocket.

57
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,819
I ain't seen him
touching your fucking business.

58
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:28,738
That's because I show him respect.

59
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:32,199
You're so busy with Harlem pennies,
you forget the big picture.

60
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:36,637
Yeah, well,
nigger pennies... white pennies.

61
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:41,433
They all add up to the same fucking thing:
my fucking dollars.

62
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:45,463
Well, that's why I'm here. Ante up.

63
00:07:45,563 --> 00:07:47,857
Lulu, get the cash.

64
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:55,848
When you give Dewey 2,000 of my
hard-earned dollars, tell him one thing.

65
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:59,535
If he don't back off,
I'll kill him myself.

66
00:07:59,785 --> 00:08:01,912
Here, Dutch.

67
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:16,635
- You got mustard on your suit.
- I'm breaking it in for a friend.

68
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:28,088
Answer me this. Why would that
droopy-eyed, lowlife, greaseball pimp

69
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:31,425
come all the way up to Harlem
when he could send a stooge?

70
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:34,820
- I don't know.
- It's rhetorical.

71
00:08:38,157 --> 00:08:41,560
Illinois, come on, baby.
Pay me some nevermind.

72
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,729
Put them number slips away!

73
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:47,650
Number slips is how I make my money.
You're confusing me, Pigfoot.

74
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,861
I'm three slips short.
The Queen already don't like me.

75
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:53,672
Would you just let a man
accomplish his business?

76
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,509
I'm your business now.
You need to accomplish this.

77
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:02,164
- Pigfoot.
- Huh?

78
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:05,834
- What time do I have to turn in my slips?
- One o'clock.

79
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:08,420
And what time do people check the paper

80
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,465
to get the day's numbers
off them stock exchange totals?

81
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:15,010
I'm not a goddamn idiot.
I know how to play the numbers.

82
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,363
You need to be...

83
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,643
- Is that your husband?
- How do I know?

84
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:26,272
I know nothing about that two-timing,
gator-faced grape-cat!

85
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:28,649
- Don't shoot him!
- I'm gonna fix his ass.

86
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:31,443
- Don't shoot him!
- Don't shoot him?

87
00:09:31,543 --> 00:09:34,713
If you don't get your ass
in that closet...!

88
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:48,894
Bumpy Johnson.

89
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:51,755
What's buzzin', cousin?

90
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:56,635
Don't you put your hand out there for me!
Come over here and hug my neck.

91
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,430
- Oh, my goodness!
- Been a long time, huh?

92
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,433
- Oh, man! Come here, man.
- Good to see you.

93
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,853
Mary! Mary, come on out.
You remember my cousin Bumpy.

94
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:09,481
Bumpy Johnson!
Oh, boy, you're a sight for sore eyes!

95
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:13,777
Good to see you.
I didn't interrupt anything, did I?

96
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:16,989
Baby, you and me gonna
have to lay dead for a little while.

97
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:19,783
- I gotta tend to my man's wellbeing.
- Dead?

98
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:21,952
Oh, you putting me out!

99
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:25,914
Let me get my shoes. Be a long time
before you get your hambone boiled!

100
00:10:26,014 --> 00:10:28,083
And you stay from up in my face!

101
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:30,686
Good to see you, Pigfoot.

102
00:10:34,398 --> 00:10:36,467
You think you're sharp!

103
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:39,887
What you doin' knocking
like you the damn police or worse?

104
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:42,264
Don't be ignorant your whole life.

105
00:10:42,364 --> 00:10:45,659
- Oh, Bumpy Johnson.
- Illinois Gordon.

106
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:48,979
- How's business?
- Dutch Schultz is at it again.

107
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:53,066
He been gattin' folks all over town.
Even messing with the Queen.

108
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,544
The Queen?

109
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:59,823
- The Queen don't bow to no man.
- She ain't bowed yet, but...

110
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:01,992
We can talk about that another time.

111
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:04,620
I see you still
with the large-sized ladies.

112
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,665
Now, hold on there, cousin.
Like I always tell you,

113
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:13,545
there ain't nothing like the loving
you get from a big woman.

114
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:16,231
Mm-hm. Same old Bear!

115
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:30,270
He thinks I'm gonna roll over, ¡está loco!

116
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,498
Take it easy, Henry.
Dutch just wanna talk.

117
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,200
Seem like everybody in Harlem
played 505 and the goddamn number hits.

118
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,744
I needed 18 grand to pay off the players.

119
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:50,582
That's why I came to you. Now my
runners say your boys are playing rough!

120
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:54,311
Sit down, Henry.
I'm getting a fucking neck ache.

121
00:11:56,396 --> 00:12:00,968
There's your money. Plus two in interest
on the loan, like we agreed.

122
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:04,680
I don't consider that a fucking loan, Henry.
That was an investment.

123
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,934
I believe that investment entitles me
to a piece of the fucking bank.

124
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:12,646
- We're partners, Henry.
- ¡Mira, no me vengas con eso!

125
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,398
- In English.
- No, no!

126
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:17,651
I know you since you sold shit-piss
needle beer in the Bronx!

127
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:21,989
And you're still the same.
¡P'al carajo, hijo de puta, cabrón, tacaño!

128
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:24,658
- Henry...
- You might've pulled this shit

129
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:28,662
con el motherfucking negro como
Willie Brunder and Big Joe Ison.

130
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:30,831
That's cos those bankers got no balls.

131
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:34,393
I got balls as big as you.
¡Las bolas más grandes!

132
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:46,530
Big balls. No brains.

133
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:11,830
Jesus!

134
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,000
- I don't feel comfortable here.
- Relax.

135
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,629
The mayor won't be happy to know his
special prosecutor's having a meeting

136
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:21,590
in Mr Luciano's milieu.

137
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,053
Why don't you ask him?
He's on the second floor right now.

138
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:28,889
This month's contributions.

139
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:31,283
Fine.

140
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:35,812
- We have a problem.
- The valise is not big enough?

141
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:39,232
I'm talking about Arthur Flegenheimer.

142
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:44,087
You know why Arthur chose the name
Dutch Schultz? He wants respect.

143
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:48,533
Who's gonna respect a man
by the name of Arthur Flegenheimer?

144
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:52,746
''All right, boys. Stick 'em up!
My name is Arthur Flegenheimer.''

145
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:56,291
- It won't work, Mr Dewey.
- He's threatening to kill me.

146
00:13:56,391 --> 00:14:00,462
It's nonsense. He's bent outta shape
because of your tax-evasion charges.

147
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:03,173
He'd rather lose a testicle
than pay the government.

148
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:07,552
- So what do you propose?
- I propose you take it easy.

149
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:10,972
Think about your future, not our demise.

150
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:16,102
In the meantime, enjoy the scenery.
Have a long drink with one of the girls.

151
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:19,940
Listen to me... very carefully.
I don't wanna have to say this again.

152
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,127
I am not your friend. I don't want
the services of your whores.

153
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:29,366
We are in a business arrangement
for obvious mutual benefits.

154
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:32,661
Mr Schultz threatens this arrangement.

155
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:35,680
- Have I made myself clear?
- Crystal.

156
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:46,274
It's clear you took the money.

157
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:50,011
I ain't seen this many poor folks
in Harlem in all my life.

158
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,681
Well, cousin, welcome to the Depression.

159
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:56,409
Only way a cat can make a dime
these days is running numbers.

160
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,990
Hey, toots, I see you!

161
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,175
You can't keep ducking me.

162
00:15:13,718 --> 00:15:15,804
All right.

163
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:32,637
- My boy is back.
- Whispers.

164
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:37,100
You ain't never had no loot,
but you still my favourite boot.

165
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,786
It does feel good to see you, Bump.

166
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:42,564
You're late, Illinois.

167
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:44,749
The Queen is mad.

168
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:49,487
Surprise!

169
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:52,674
Did somebody say something
about sprucing somebody?

170
00:15:55,427 --> 00:15:57,704
This is the new guy... Vallie.

171
00:15:57,804 --> 00:16:00,206
- Mr Johnson.
- Nice to meet you.

172
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:05,295
Come on, come on. Madam Queen
is waiting, been waiting.

173
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:07,939
There she is.

174
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:13,778
- Hello, Madam Queen.
- Bumpy Johnson.

175
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:23,104
You still have the light in your eyes, eh?

176
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:25,290
Praise God.

177
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:34,282
Before we get this soiree started,
I need to speak with you for a few ticks.

178
00:16:34,382 --> 00:16:35,492
All right.

179
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:38,136
Y'all enjoy yourself, hear?

180
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:42,916
Illinois said that Dutch Schultz

181
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:46,978
put six of your men on the slab
in Harlem Hospital.

182
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:50,090
Oui.

183
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,804
Mr Schultz is trying to make trouble,
but I set up a meeting next week,

184
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:58,615
and it is then
I will make my position clear.

185
00:16:58,907 --> 00:17:02,852
I wanna go with you to that meeting
as your bodyguard.

186
00:17:02,952 --> 00:17:07,816
You think you're gonna protect her,
lamb's breath? That for me job!

187
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:11,294
- Me take care of Queen!
- I have faith in Tee.

188
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:17,467
I know Tee-Ninchy got spine, but faith
ain't gonna get rid of the Dutchman.

189
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:21,371
I saw what his boys did to Willie Brunder.

190
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:24,874
I'm not gonna stand by and do nothing
and let that happen to you.

191
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:30,547
He's threatening to take over business
that's taken you ten years to build up.

192
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:35,318
I want everybody to know
the Queen's still carrying power uptown.

193
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:41,699
- Please?
- I still can't say no to you, eh?

194
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,024
I had a dream... a big ol' crawfish
jumped off a plate and bit me.

195
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:52,485
What Madam Zora's dream book say for fish?

196
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:56,114
579. But I wouldn't bother with no 579.

197
00:17:56,214 --> 00:18:00,326
That stock exchange figure they used
for the numbers was 579 last week!

198
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:02,704
It ain't gonna be 579 again.

199
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:05,290
There was sweet potato pie
on the plate, too.

200
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,252
Potatoes is under ''potatoes''.
Oh, look, here it is.

201
00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:15,650
642. Huh! 642? Uh-uh.
I ain't gonna play no 642. It give me gas.

202
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,680
Potatoes give me gas.
I ain't playing no number that give me gas!

203
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,725
I bet your gas smell as sweet
as flowers in springtime!

204
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:27,770
Mm-mm. Don't you be trying
to get in my good graces.

205
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,249
- Hey, Miss Mary.
- Shh. Damn, woman, you hard as lard!

206
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,028
You know what? I hate crawfish.

207
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:38,114
I'm gonna just go ahead
and play a dime on 642 straight.

208
00:18:38,214 --> 00:18:43,244
- That's another dime down the drain.
- Lord have mercy! Garveyite Francine.

209
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:46,789
This is for you and the kids.
Save your money, Sul.

210
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,459
Hey, you don't need
to be telling her that,

211
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,295
or I'll beat you
till you smell like onions.

212
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:55,214
I'll drag you by that collar
and drop you in the gutter.

213
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:57,400
Yeah, yeah. Let me see that.

214
00:18:57,942 --> 00:19:01,804
Now, look at this! What you doin',
peddling this gold-can jive?

215
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:05,308
You can bake it, broil it,
fry it, hang it out to dry,

216
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:08,353
it's still just as funky
as a fat man's drawers!

217
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:12,523
Don't you see people hungry? What do
you do for people, numbers man?

218
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:15,860
I have told you several times,
I'm the poor man's racetrack.

219
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,988
You take the money
needed to put food on the table.

220
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:22,992
A million-to-one odds... it's a scam!
It's gambling, that's what it is.

221
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:24,802
Excuse me.

222
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:29,165
The numbers provide jobs for
2,000 coloured folks in Harlem alone.

223
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:31,501
A penny gets you $6... a month's groceries.

224
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:34,921
A month's worth of people food,
not this bullshit!

225
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:37,423
It's the only home-grown business we got.

226
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:39,484
- Are you his partner?
- Don't worry about it.

227
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:42,445
Y'all make a better team
than Amos 'n' Andy!

228
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:47,992
I don't need no partner.
My name is Bumpy Johnson.

229
00:19:48,784 --> 00:19:51,913
Bumpy? Your momma named you Bumpy?

230
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:57,235
What you gonna do
with that hair in Africa?

231
00:19:57,335 --> 00:20:00,321
They ain't got no straightening
combs over there! Ugly!

232
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:02,698
- She fine as frog legs!
- OK, cousin,

233
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:07,078
- tell me about Miss Francine Hughes.
- Oh, Francine!

234
00:20:07,178 --> 00:20:12,041
She always quoting Marcus Garvey
about moving back to hot-ass Africa.

235
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:15,795
I think she work down at
that United Negro something-or-other.

236
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:19,132
- Improvement Association?
- That's it.

237
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:21,300
Man, she sure is high-toned!

238
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,138
You see the glimmers on that girl?
Where do you think she got them eyes?

239
00:20:25,238 --> 00:20:28,766
Francine Hughes is not gonna
take up with the likes of you.

240
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:31,894
She high-powered
and she got her boots laced,

241
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:34,105
so don't even pay that no nevermind.

242
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:36,482
All I wanna do is converse with her.

243
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:40,044
Yeah, I bet you gonna have
a long-ass conversation!

244
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:46,550
Son, the man that walks with Francine
will walk down the Christian path!

245
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:53,791
Hey! Damn! All these roaches in here!
It's like stepping on cornflakes.

246
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:56,627
At least you won't be sleeping alone.

247
00:20:56,727 --> 00:21:01,565
Hey, Bumpy, you know, these last
couple of years here with you gone,

248
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:05,261
well, I just wanna say
I really missed you.

249
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:09,223
- I missed you, too.
- I got you a little present.

250
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:13,703
Now, it's not new.
I got it from old Clarence up on St Nick.

251
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:17,064
Hello there, Mr Speaker!

252
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:21,919
Yeah, I figure you might need that
to open a few doors for yourself.

253
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:24,839
Yeah.

254
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:31,512
That's hard-hitting. Thanks, cousin.

255
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:42,898
Together we got strength,
we got experience.

256
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:49,305
Most of all, though, we got organisation.
A partnership's gonna increase the profits.

257
00:21:49,405 --> 00:21:55,077
Si, certainement. There will be no profit
with your boys collecting the money.

258
00:21:55,703 --> 00:22:00,066
What I got? I got fuckin' horns
growing outta my head here?

259
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,501
I don't feel nothin'.

260
00:22:03,586 --> 00:22:06,030
Madam Stephanie,
I'm not the fucking devil.

261
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,301
But you do the devil's work.
Six of me men is proof of that.

262
00:22:10,426 --> 00:22:14,747
But if I hadn't sent an invitation,
you wouldn't have met me, would you?

263
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:19,835
Come on, Queen. From what I hear,
you ain't exactly a fuckin' nun yourself.

264
00:22:19,935 --> 00:22:25,591
Mr Schultz, me not here to quarrel
about your right to own your own bank,

265
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:29,428
but I ask to respect my right
to have me own.

266
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:31,806
Comprenez-vous?

267
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:35,017
- Oh, yeah, I fuckin' vous.
- Bon.

268
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:40,523
You know, that reminds me of this
thing that spic Henry Miro said.

269
00:22:40,623 --> 00:22:43,317
He said he had the balls
to stand up to me.

270
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:47,321
''Las bolas más grandes.''
That's what he fuckin' said.

271
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:49,798
You know something?

272
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:53,285
He really does have big fuckin' balls!

273
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:56,055
Blasphemer! Ya bastard!

274
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,727
You gonna shoot me this time, Bub?

275
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:06,815
If so, you might wanna lower that
a little bit, hit me in the heart.

276
00:23:07,107 --> 00:23:10,236
This way you don't make a mess.

277
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:18,994
So, Dutch, you wanna do this peaceful
or you wanna make a go?

278
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:33,467
Boys, boys.

279
00:23:34,635 --> 00:23:37,554
Lower the fuckin' metal.

280
00:23:39,306 --> 00:23:42,017
Put 'em down.

281
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:45,754
Tee-Ninchy, now ain't the time.
Put the shotgun down.

282
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:49,717
Man crazy! Man real crazy!

283
00:23:49,817 --> 00:23:53,153
Think he can drop dead man's balls
upon me Queen!

284
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,600
You forget one thing, Tee.

285
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,036
Me no got no balls to lose.

286
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:07,459
We ain't gonna crease...
like Brunder, or Miro.

287
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:15,592
Some you win, some you fuckin' lose!

288
00:24:16,677 --> 00:24:18,746
- We got a problem.
- She's gonna fold.

289
00:24:18,846 --> 00:24:21,348
I ain't talking about her.

290
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:25,561
He's not gonna go away.

291
00:24:32,568 --> 00:24:37,348
You don't have to have a hanker
to be a broker or a banker

292
00:24:37,448 --> 00:24:41,618
No, siree, just if you'll be
my mother's son-in-law

293
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:46,982
Needn't even think of tryin'
to be a mighty social lion

294
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:50,110
Sippin' tea if you'll be
my mother's son-in-law

295
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,256
Look at all these fine women!
They must be having recess in heaven.

296
00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:57,201
..to set the world on fire

297
00:24:57,301 --> 00:24:59,787
Just wish you'd make it proper...

298
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:02,181
Ain't nobody here.

299
00:25:04,224 --> 00:25:06,293
Uh-oh. Don't look now,

300
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:09,772
but here's your chance
to have your long-ass conversation.

301
00:25:14,568 --> 00:25:16,762
Oh, look who came with Illinois.

302
00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:21,392
- Francine's new friend Bumpy.
- He's not my friend.

303
00:25:21,492 --> 00:25:24,937
All the women in the neighbourhood
have eyes for him.

304
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:27,748
Ooh, honey, he's a killer-diller!

305
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:33,045
- He is not my type.
- You can't judge a book with just a look.

306
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:41,245
Miss Mary, what say you
do me the honour of

307
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:44,164
joining me out there on the dance floor?

308
00:25:44,264 --> 00:25:48,127
Today's your lucky day, boy.
Sulie wanna dance, too.

309
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:50,754
Hell, no, I don't wanna dance!
My feet hurt.

310
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:52,940
Yes, you do.

311
00:25:54,858 --> 00:26:00,364
Oh, yeah. Who wouldn't wanna
dance with ol' Illinois?

312
00:26:16,713 --> 00:26:18,574
Mind if I sit?

313
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:22,828
I heard about you,
Mr Ellsworth ''Bumpy'' Johnson.

314
00:26:22,928 --> 00:26:25,747
Fresh out of Sing Sing
and back on the streets.

315
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:28,500
Yeah,

316
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,295
I got a reputation.

317
00:26:31,395 --> 00:26:34,481
But I like you, and I think
you like me, so

318
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:38,735
let's dance.

319
00:26:38,902 --> 00:26:45,350
In my solitude

320
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:52,958
You haunt me

321
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:59,239
With memories

322
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:03,510
Of days gone by

323
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:11,418
- There you are.
- Oh, my God!

324
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:15,047
Thanks. Thanks for walking me home.

325
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:17,232
My pleasure.

326
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,779
I have one question. Why you gotta
involve yourself in numbers?

327
00:27:23,113 --> 00:27:25,724
I mean, what would you have me do?

328
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,228
Shine shoes? Carry bags
down at Grand Central?

329
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:32,998
I'm a coloured man. White folks ain't
left me nothing but the underworld.

330
00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:37,861
Well, I disagree. There are coloured
doctors, lawyers, accountants,...

331
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:40,239
- True.
- ..writers, musicians.

332
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:45,260
- You could do any one of those.
- I do write a little poetry.

333
00:27:46,094 --> 00:27:48,597
You write a little poetry?

334
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:56,463
I ask myself where she got those eyes
So full of light, so free of lies.

335
00:27:56,563 --> 00:27:59,883
How does one get eyes like that?

336
00:27:59,983 --> 00:28:03,487
I tell myself she robbed a cat.

337
00:28:04,738 --> 00:28:07,491
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, I like it.

338
00:28:09,117 --> 00:28:11,286
Well, when can I see you again?

339
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:15,957
Well, keep writing those poems,
Ellsworth, and we'll see.

340
00:28:18,335 --> 00:28:20,754
- Good night.
- Have a good evening.

341
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:12,164
- Blow on my dice for me.
- Move yourself, boy!

342
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:16,126
I'm tryin' to make some money.
I need that cool West Indian breeze.

343
00:29:16,226 --> 00:29:20,397
Come on now, blow on it. Cool, cool
number. Look at him smiling now!

344
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:24,693
He blew on them bones, didn't he?

345
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:31,408
- I'm gonna break the bank now!
- Here we go. Here we go.

346
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:37,314
What you doin' pitchin' dice on me stoop?

347
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:40,125
- Go away from here!
- Yes, ma'am.

348
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,404
Bumpy, come help an old lady
down the steps.

349
00:29:44,504 --> 00:29:46,548
Yes, Madam.

350
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:53,747
Madam Queen! Looking just as fine
as one of them African violets.

351
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:57,250
Move from me! Me don't need
to have me bottom kissed.

352
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,045
Mikey, June, Whispers, trail our car.

353
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:04,316
Hey! Hey, Bumpy! Boy,
I sure wish I was going to the opera.

354
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:07,302
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, Tee-Ninchy!

355
00:30:07,402 --> 00:30:11,531
Hey, why you goin' to the opera
and you can't even understan' English?

356
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:14,451
You gotta gimme five! Gimme ten!

357
00:30:14,743 --> 00:30:19,289
Gimme 20! I would give you 30
but your hand's too dirty!

358
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:43,255
What is this now?

359
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:46,216
I don't know why you make me
come to these things.

360
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:48,385
To culture you, Bumpy.

361
00:30:48,485 --> 00:30:53,056
You know, I have not missed an opera
on me birthday in 16 years.

362
00:30:53,156 --> 00:30:55,850
You need to give Tee-Ninchy some culture.

363
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,896
- How about me rattle your head?
- You'll love Verdi's Macbeth.

364
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:02,691
It's in Italian.
I don't understand Italian.

365
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:07,712
It deals with life,
war and, most of all, passion.

366
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:13,843
Mon Dieu! We gonna miss the overture!

367
00:31:15,678 --> 00:31:17,472
Get down!

368
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,622
Move back! Move back!

369
00:32:46,352 --> 00:32:48,855
Bumpy! Mercy!

370
00:33:02,452 --> 00:33:06,856
Quel cauchemar! Mon protecteur!

371
00:33:06,956 --> 00:33:11,611
Amour! Mon ami amour!

372
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:13,988
Mon Dieu!

373
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:20,036
Sang partout! Sang partout!
Le sang partout!

374
00:33:20,136 --> 00:33:23,222
Mon amour! Sang partout!

375
00:34:58,151 --> 00:35:01,429
I can contain it because
only the negro papers have it.

376
00:35:01,529 --> 00:35:04,599
But if Winchell gets a hold of this,
he'll have a field day.

377
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:10,246
- He just wants to sell newspapers.
- He will, at everyone's expense.

378
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,907
Look, Charles, even by your standards,
this is a psychopath.

379
00:35:21,007 --> 00:35:24,927
How much longer am I going to
be worried about Arthur Flegenheimer?

380
00:35:25,428 --> 00:35:30,833
You gotta learn to relax, Thomas.
I'll take care of the Dutchman.

381
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:34,128
Meantime, why don't you come up here
and join us by the pool?

382
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:36,147
Loosen up that stiff neck of yours.

383
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:45,031
Thank you, Alice.

384
00:35:50,286 --> 00:35:53,397
So what's the skinny, Johnny?

385
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:55,775
You were right, Mr Luciano.

386
00:35:55,875 --> 00:36:00,696
My figures show the numbers
at 100,000 a day before payouts.

387
00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:03,507
Harlem is a g-g-g...

388
00:36:05,343 --> 00:36:08,012
goldmine.

389
00:36:11,682 --> 00:36:15,311
What's the matter?
You wanna go swimming there, Johnny?

390
00:36:16,812 --> 00:36:18,648
No, I-I never learned how.

391
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:35,456
- Where's Hector?
- Went out to get some rice and beans.

392
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,943
- When's he coming back?
- I don't know, boss.

393
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:43,673
But if you're here to collect policy money,
don't worry. It's all under control.

394
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:47,677
- Everything copacetic, cousin?
- Oh, yeah.

395
00:36:51,472 --> 00:36:54,058
- Who the hell are you?
- Me?

396
00:36:56,477 --> 00:36:59,730
- Now you know!
- I'm the bagman.

397
00:37:07,446 --> 00:37:09,532
Let's go, Bear.

398
00:37:16,497 --> 00:37:20,735
So, cousin, what are we gonna do
with all Dutch's money?

399
00:37:20,835 --> 00:37:23,337
Gonna put it back where it belongs.

400
00:37:30,261 --> 00:37:32,913
- Hey, Miss Francine.
- Hey, Mr Johnson.

401
00:37:33,013 --> 00:37:35,333
Why didn't you say
we was going to see Francine?

402
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:40,855
Hey, everybody! Got a gift from
Madam Queen, courtesy of Dutch Schultz!

403
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:50,239
- There you go!
- A penny for everybody!

404
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:05,254
These are very nice, John.

405
00:38:08,841 --> 00:38:11,343
First order of business.

406
00:38:15,097 --> 00:38:18,225
Like any square citizen,
we all have tax problems.

407
00:38:18,517 --> 00:38:21,270
But I have a solution.

408
00:38:25,232 --> 00:38:28,969
- Johnny.
- Mr G-G-Genovese.

409
00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:32,515
Mr C-C-Costello. Mr L-Lansky.

410
00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:36,268
Get on with it, John.
We ain't got all fuckin' day here.

411
00:38:36,368 --> 00:38:39,772
I have taken the liberty of
setting up for our use

412
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,875
a number of accounts in Havana, Cuba.

413
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,532
They are impervious
to the scrutiny of the feds there.

414
00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:52,451
At the request of my employer,
Lucky Luciano,

415
00:38:52,551 --> 00:38:57,890
I hereby offer these services
to each and every one of you.

416
00:39:03,854 --> 00:39:06,190
Second order of business.

417
00:39:11,153 --> 00:39:14,014
I'll wait.

418
00:39:14,114 --> 00:39:16,825
Excuse me.

419
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:22,606
The only thing that threatens profits is the
unwanted attention of law enforcement.

420
00:39:22,706 --> 00:39:25,609
- I wanna talk about Dutch's activities.
- What about 'em?

421
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:28,712
Got a call from Dewey.
He didn't appreciate your spree.

422
00:39:28,963 --> 00:39:31,323
I got it all under control.

423
00:39:31,423 --> 00:39:34,868
While he was up in Albany,
Bo Weinberg said just the opposite.

424
00:39:34,968 --> 00:39:36,745
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

425
00:39:36,845 --> 00:39:38,622
What did Bo say?

426
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:41,625
One of the coloured bankers
don't wanna join you.

427
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:45,921
He indicated you might need
a little help to straighten things out.

428
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:51,151
Bo must've been having a bad day.
His wife ran off with a dago from Yonkers.

429
00:39:56,699 --> 00:40:00,227
I was gonna propose that
myself, Frank and Vito

430
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:02,646
could lend you a little help.

431
00:40:02,746 --> 00:40:06,275
In return for a little piece, huh, Lucky?

432
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:09,737
I come to you guys a year ago
saying we should go uptown.

433
00:40:09,837 --> 00:40:13,157
You said nigger pennies
was a waste of fuckin' time.

434
00:40:13,257 --> 00:40:16,427
So, to you and your proposal,
I say only one thing.

435
00:40:17,177 --> 00:40:20,180
Take a flying fuck!

436
00:40:22,182 --> 00:40:26,420
Always missing the point. OK, Dutch,
you're on your own. Do as you wish.

437
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,132
If you need help from us
down the line, from us dagos,

438
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:32,151
your price just went up.

439
00:40:32,317 --> 00:40:35,946
On that note, this meeting's adjourned.

440
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,392
Louis, Meyer, Frank, Vito,
can I see you in my library?

441
00:40:40,492 --> 00:40:43,078
Nick, show Mr Schultz to the door.

442
00:40:44,496 --> 00:40:47,191
Put your hat back on.

443
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:49,793
You look ridiculous.

444
00:40:53,255 --> 00:40:56,575
You in big trouble.
There's no other way to say it.

445
00:40:56,675 --> 00:40:58,969
She'll be right down.

446
00:41:03,265 --> 00:41:05,751
Gonna take your hat off
in the house, Bear?

447
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:08,604
Now you're giving me lessons on manners.

448
00:41:10,189 --> 00:41:13,467
Goddamn! Look at the titties
on that statue!

449
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:15,844
Boy, if I...

450
00:41:15,944 --> 00:41:19,072
Imbécile!

451
00:41:24,036 --> 00:41:26,313
I hope you're proud of yourself!

452
00:41:26,413 --> 00:41:29,833
You have dishonoured my name
with your betrayal.

453
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:35,823
Who are you? Dutch Schultz burn down
three of me policy houses today!

454
00:41:35,923 --> 00:41:38,992
So we burn down three of his.
An eye for an eye.

455
00:41:39,092 --> 00:41:42,496
So you're the Queen now, eh?
Who runnin' this operation?

456
00:41:42,596 --> 00:41:46,558
- You.
- Then why you disregard my orders?

457
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:52,214
You think I don't know why you're
sticking close to me? I see your ambition.

458
00:41:52,314 --> 00:41:56,802
- It was time to take a stand.
- I take care of Schultz meself!

459
00:41:56,902 --> 00:42:01,198
- I am the Queen!
- But you are afraid of him.

460
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:07,829
Never thought I'd see the day
that you were afraid of any man.

461
00:42:08,538 --> 00:42:13,235
Of course I'm afraid.
But fear be a good thing sometime.

462
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:16,046
It checks the angry spirit.

463
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,492
I can beat him, Queen.
I can beat the Dutchman at his own game.

464
00:42:20,592 --> 00:42:25,163
Use your head, Bumpy.
Where you think they gonna fight this war?

465
00:42:25,263 --> 00:42:27,749
On Park Avenue?

466
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:30,335
Non. Mais non.

467
00:42:30,435 --> 00:42:35,941
Here. Right here,
on the streets of Harlem.

468
00:42:36,483 --> 00:42:39,219
I'm prepared to deal
with the consequences of that.

469
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:41,488
And what about the rest of us?

470
00:42:42,614 --> 00:42:46,243
You open the faucet of blood,
you never shut it off.

471
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:54,651
Three fuckin' grand?

472
00:42:54,751 --> 00:42:57,337
We hear this guy's a real tornado.

473
00:43:04,678 --> 00:43:08,540
Hey, Bub, you're gonna kill
my English ivy tree there.

474
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,916
I'm sorry.

475
00:43:10,016 --> 00:43:13,670
Dutch, the Salkes are the best
pickaxe boys in the business.

476
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:16,898
They'll turn this guy into a sieve.

477
00:43:21,194 --> 00:43:24,097
Ah, maybe the three grand's worth it, huh?

478
00:43:24,197 --> 00:43:27,309
I remember the days you could get
a guy hit for 40 bucks.

479
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:32,539
- We live in inflationary times.
- Ain't that the fuckin' truth!

480
00:43:36,543 --> 00:43:39,045
Don't come back without him.

481
00:43:41,047 --> 00:43:45,427
- You're under arrest!
- Foley, you mick, get over here!

482
00:43:47,888 --> 00:43:49,956
Hey, had you, didn't I, lads?

483
00:43:50,056 --> 00:43:52,476
How ya doin', Cap?

484
00:43:54,311 --> 00:43:57,714
Well, ain't it the short arm of the law.

485
00:43:57,814 --> 00:44:00,717
You beat up any niggers lately?

486
00:44:00,817 --> 00:44:03,945
No, I'm sorry to say I haven't. Have you?

487
00:44:08,825 --> 00:44:10,477
How's tricks?

488
00:44:10,577 --> 00:44:15,540
We live in inflationary fuckin' times.
How'd it go with Judge Capshaw?

489
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:19,903
He told me Stephanie St Clair
offered him 20,000 to shut you down.

490
00:44:20,003 --> 00:44:23,490
No shit? Well, I'm flattered.

491
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:27,619
You've gotta give that black bitch
credit. She's a wily old horse.

492
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:30,622
So, how much to top her ice?

493
00:44:30,722 --> 00:44:34,334
- Capshaw wants forty.
- He's a greedy bastard.

494
00:44:34,434 --> 00:44:36,545
Judges don't come cheap, Arthur.

495
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:39,673
That's true.
They're the crookedest crooks around.

496
00:44:39,773 --> 00:44:44,511
With a bit of proper evidence,
he can guarantee a conviction.

497
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:47,764
- Get the policy paper?
- I'm on it.

498
00:44:47,864 --> 00:44:50,559
What about them Salke brothers, huh?

499
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:54,479
How would you like one of them
fuckin' your sister?

500
00:44:54,579 --> 00:44:58,124
Well, it's better than some
I could think of.

501
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:04,923
Don't knock on my door

502
00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:12,264
I done told you two or three times
I don't want you no more

503
00:45:13,431 --> 00:45:18,170
I run in here, baby, cos I got kinda sick
Ain't nothing ailing my stomach

504
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:22,048
It's something wrong with my...
Dixieland was a camp in Georgia

505
00:45:22,148 --> 00:45:24,901
You can't stay there very long

506
00:45:26,111 --> 00:45:31,391
All the friends I had
done shook hands and gone

507
00:45:31,491 --> 00:45:34,769
Mr Johnson.
Mr Johnson, I work at the pool hall.

508
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:39,900
I wanna work for you. I promise I'll
be the fastest runner you ever seen.

509
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,903
The Queen ain't hiring no runners, son.
Neither am I.

510
00:45:43,003 --> 00:45:45,280
Besides, ain't it past your bedtime?

511
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,241
Oh, man, I'm gonna close this party down!

512
00:45:48,341 --> 00:45:53,138
..told you two or three times
I don't want no junk

513
00:46:00,562 --> 00:46:05,091
Bumpy Johnson! My name
Miss Philmore. I'm Danny's mother.

514
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:06,217
Ma'am.

515
00:46:06,317 --> 00:46:10,096
I wish more of our coloured men
would stand up and fight for they home.

516
00:46:10,196 --> 00:46:12,182
The way you doin' against Dutch.

517
00:46:12,282 --> 00:46:14,768
I heard you killed three of his men.

518
00:46:14,868 --> 00:46:18,355
Like the Lord swooped in
on Sodom and Gomorrah,

519
00:46:18,455 --> 00:46:22,609
you swung your mighty scythe and them
heathen heads rolled on the pavement!

520
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:25,570
- Yes, ma'am.
- You a killin' machine!

521
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:30,967
Ooh, Mr Johnson, you somethin' else!
I'm telling you, you just a killer!

522
00:46:32,635 --> 00:46:34,721
Thanks, everybody.

523
00:46:38,516 --> 00:46:40,727
Francine. Francine.

524
00:46:41,811 --> 00:46:44,089
- Francine.
- Bumpy Johnson!

525
00:46:44,189 --> 00:46:47,717
Mr Johnson, I been singing
for you a long time now.

526
00:46:47,817 --> 00:46:51,262
I been tryin' to get a job
at the Cotton Club for six months.

527
00:46:51,362 --> 00:46:54,683
Look here, come down to the Bamville.
See my man Calvin.

528
00:46:54,783 --> 00:46:58,728
He's a cleanhead man. He does
the hiring. Would you excuse me?

529
00:46:58,828 --> 00:47:02,290
- He gonna take care of me?
- He'll take care of you.

530
00:47:06,044 --> 00:47:08,129
What's wrong?

531
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:21,543
What was I supposed to do, Francine?
Let 'em kill the Queen?

532
00:47:21,643 --> 00:47:25,271
You shot three people.
Don't you have any remorse?

533
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:29,717
Remorse comes when you feel
you've done something wrong.

534
00:47:29,817 --> 00:47:34,180
- You don't think killing is wrong?
- Innocent people, yes.

535
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,450
There's been 35 lynchings this year alone.

536
00:47:38,284 --> 00:47:41,688
Depression got people starving
all over the country.

537
00:47:41,788 --> 00:47:45,400
Scottsboro boys... in jail
for a crime they didn't commit.

538
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,194
All of that is wrong.

539
00:47:48,294 --> 00:47:50,905
Yeah, I understand all that.

540
00:47:51,005 --> 00:47:52,866
But?

541
00:47:52,966 --> 00:47:55,260
But I don't understand you.

542
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,330
You're a gentleman, you're a poet,

543
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:03,626
you're nice to people,
you think about things.

544
00:48:03,726 --> 00:48:07,714
And then, within a blink of an eye,

545
00:48:07,814 --> 00:48:10,316
you can kill or be killed.

546
00:48:11,651 --> 00:48:14,470
Is there nothing in this world

547
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:16,931
that you love enough

548
00:48:17,031 --> 00:48:19,742
that you would kill for it or die for it?

549
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,914
I don't know.

550
00:49:01,617 --> 00:49:04,103
I'd give my left nut
for a piece of cheesecake.

551
00:49:04,203 --> 00:49:07,023
- Who makes the best in New York?
- Junior's.

552
00:49:07,123 --> 00:49:10,276
- Lindy's.
- Best sauerbraten?

553
00:49:10,376 --> 00:49:13,571

00:49:13,671 --> 00:49:16,366

555
00:49:16,466 --> 00:49:19,243
- Krause's.
- Best steak?

556
00:49:19,343 --> 00:49:22,055
- Luger's.
- Gallagher's.

557
00:49:24,015 --> 00:49:26,517
Now, let's do some damage.

558
00:49:39,822 --> 00:49:43,351
I'm tired of going to church
without my man.

559
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:48,122
I told you, Francine. The good Lord
and I have an arrangement.

560
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,794
I don't go into his house.
He doesn't come into mine.

561
00:49:56,088 --> 00:50:01,744
OK, you heathen. That's the last time
I try to save your soul.

562
00:50:01,844 --> 00:50:05,289
Aw, don't be that way, baby.

563
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:08,518
Besides, you know you're my religion.

564
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:17,819
- Good night.
- Good night.

565
00:50:29,705 --> 00:50:32,400
- Best martini?
- Stork Club.

566
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,419
Dave's Blue Room. Much bigger.

567
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:39,490
- Best Italian?
- Patsy's.

568
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:42,702
- Rao's.
- Best corned beef?

569
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:45,304
- Ratner's.
- Katz's.

570
00:50:47,265 --> 00:50:50,726
- Best frankfurter?
- Nathan's.

571
00:51:02,405 --> 00:51:05,116
Hey, hey, hey!

572
00:51:05,491 --> 00:51:08,227
What the fuck you doin' up here?

573
00:51:08,327 --> 00:51:13,357
Silent night

574
00:51:13,457 --> 00:51:17,612
- Did you hear what I said?
- Holy night

575
00:51:17,712 --> 00:51:20,406
What the fuck you...

576
00:51:20,506 --> 00:51:24,343
Silent night...

577
00:53:42,565 --> 00:53:44,842
Give me the gun.

578
00:53:44,942 --> 00:53:47,511
It's all right.
It's all right, give me the gun.

579
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:50,139
It's all right. It's all right.

580
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:54,518
It's all right. It's just you and me.
It's just gonna be you and me.

581
00:53:54,618 --> 00:54:00,040
I promise. I promise. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

582
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:03,711
It's all right. It's all right.

583
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:20,544
Lord have mercy! I didn't know
Josephine Baker worked here!

584
00:54:20,644 --> 00:54:25,316
Miss Baker, I thought you was in France.
Where is Pigfoot Mary?

585
00:54:26,108 --> 00:54:28,944
Give me 60 cents on 409.

586
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,323
60 cents on 409 straight.

587
00:54:32,823 --> 00:54:35,326
All right, I heard you.

588
00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:42,942
No, you hold onto that. Your money
ain't no good here. I'll take care of that.

589
00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:47,488
Oh, come on now, Mary. The governor
pardon folks quicker than you do!

590
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:52,968
Mm-mm. And if you don't quit mackin'
me so hard, I'm gonna crush your spine.

591
00:54:53,552 --> 00:54:57,973
Woman, now you're talkin' my language!

592
00:55:00,225 --> 00:55:03,295
- Come on. Give me some sugar now.
- Get outta here!

593
00:55:03,395 --> 00:55:07,274
That's all right. You gonna wanna
kiss me sometime later.

594
00:55:09,026 --> 00:55:14,531
Hello, Tiny. Well, let's see what
the good doctor has in his little black bag.

595
00:55:15,032 --> 00:55:17,326
Come on, now. Give it over.

596
00:55:22,373 --> 00:55:26,919
Hey! What the hell wrong? You got
no cause to be beatin' up on him!

597
00:55:27,753 --> 00:55:30,990
Would you rather it be you?
Cos we're here to serve.

598
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:34,118
That's what I thought.
All right, boys, get the bag.

599
00:55:34,218 --> 00:55:38,330
- OK!
- Well, maybe next time.

600
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,516
Toodle-oo.

601
00:55:41,558 --> 00:55:44,728
It's all right, Daddy. It's OK.
Momma's here.

602
00:55:53,237 --> 00:55:56,698
C'est fait accompli, mais non?
Don't fret yourself.

603
00:55:57,407 --> 00:55:59,852
What do you think you should've done, huh?

604
00:55:59,952 --> 00:56:03,480
Let that pickaxe-waving devil
just kill Bumpy?

605
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,916
You done right, sweetheart.

606
00:56:06,208 --> 00:56:10,587
The Lord knows there's a shortage
of eligible men in this town.

607
00:56:30,816 --> 00:56:34,152
Well, if it isn't Madam Queen.

608
00:56:36,572 --> 00:56:38,782
Speak your business.

609
00:56:40,325 --> 00:56:42,978
Stephanie St Clair, you are under arrest

610
00:56:43,078 --> 00:56:47,583
for violation of city code
section 1 7-64: illegal gambling.

611
00:56:50,043 --> 00:56:53,171
- You be careful, Captain.
- Likewise.

612
00:56:55,591 --> 00:56:58,260
All right, boys. Take her away.

613
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:18,305
This morning, the Queen turned over
control of the bank to me.

614
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:22,768
Now, she asked me to take
every precaution available

615
00:57:22,868 --> 00:57:25,687
to avoid shedding any blood.

616
00:57:25,787 --> 00:57:29,858
How we gonna get people to come to
work if we don't stop the son of a bitch?

617
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:33,070
- Yeah!
- By being smart.

618
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,781
By using the old idea pot. Vallie!

619
00:57:35,881 --> 00:57:38,909
- Yes, sir!
- You in charge of the policy room.

620
00:57:39,009 --> 00:57:41,553
OK, go to every controller's house.

621
00:57:41,678 --> 00:57:44,790
- You tell 'em this building is protected.
- Done.

622
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:49,461
Calvin, establish new routes for the
runners when they collect the slips.

623
00:57:49,561 --> 00:57:53,482
Whispers, Waldo, I want y'all
to beef up security on the premises.

624
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:56,927
- You got it, Bump.
- That cop Foley's in Dutch's pocket.

625
00:57:57,027 --> 00:57:59,388
He just as crooked as the letter ''S''.

626
00:57:59,488 --> 00:58:01,948
He gonna come after them slips
the way he did me.

627
00:58:02,074 --> 00:58:06,603
If he get 'em, you and the Queen
gonna be right back in the joint.

628
00:58:06,703 --> 00:58:10,315
We'll hide the slips so none of
these flatfoot can find 'em.

629
00:58:10,415 --> 00:58:14,152
When the number come out at the end
of the day, we burn the slips.

630
00:58:14,252 --> 00:58:15,904
- Excuse me...
- Shut up!

631
00:58:16,004 --> 00:58:19,366
Hey, hey, let the kid speak.
What's on your mind, kid?

632
00:58:19,466 --> 00:58:21,535
Folks is confused, that's all.

633
00:58:21,635 --> 00:58:24,871
I mean, all them policy slips
are on white paper.

634
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:27,666
If people wanna play a number,
they fill out a slip.

635
00:58:27,766 --> 00:58:30,585
They don't know whose bank
they playin' with.

636
00:58:30,685 --> 00:58:33,755
- What's your point, kid?
- We should use different paper.

637
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:37,551
It's the most flumadiddle idea ever!
You sniffin' that Shinola?

638
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:42,155
Hold on there, Vallie. Hold on.
The boy got a good idea.

639
00:58:42,823 --> 00:58:44,891
- What's your name?
- Tyrone, sir.

640
00:58:44,991 --> 00:58:50,205
All right, Tyrone. We're gonna change
the colour of our slips to, say, green.

641
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:52,691
Waldo, go down to the print shop.

642
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:54,901
Pick us up a bushel of green slips.

643
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:58,922
Everybody know they buyin' from us
and the Queen's still carrying power.

644
00:58:59,047 --> 00:59:03,285
I know every alley in this whole damn
neighbourhood. Let me run for you.

645
00:59:03,385 --> 00:59:07,789
All right, son. You done came up with
a good idea. Let's leave it at that.

646
00:59:07,889 --> 00:59:11,626
- Run your ass around the corner!
- Laugh if you want to.

647
00:59:11,726 --> 00:59:15,380
But even I know that if Dutch takes over,
that's not what she wrote.

648
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,926
Besides, old Ray told me
you started running when you was 16.

649
00:59:20,026 --> 00:59:23,029
- Hell, I'm 1 7.
- Oh, no!

650
00:59:25,824 --> 00:59:28,160
Come on, Mr Johnson. You can trust me.

651
00:59:34,082 --> 00:59:36,793
OK, Tyrone.

652
00:59:40,338 --> 00:59:43,466
But you better not frog up on me, boy.

653
00:59:44,134 --> 00:59:46,219
You hear?

654
00:59:47,095 --> 00:59:49,389
No, sir.

655
00:59:50,682 --> 00:59:53,794
Well, Bumpy, you know we all with you.

656
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:58,523
- You can confidence that now.
- We right with you, Bumpy.

657
01:00:12,454 --> 01:00:14,915
It's your time, Bumpy.

658
01:02:14,284 --> 01:02:16,978
I've built a nice mahogany coffin.

659
01:02:17,078 --> 01:02:21,833
Mother-of-pearl inlay,
solid brass handles.

660
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:26,112
My son did a beautiful job
with the bullet wounds.

661
01:02:26,212 --> 01:02:29,090
He looks like he died in his sleep.

662
01:02:35,096 --> 01:02:37,056
Thank you, Mr Johnson.

663
01:02:39,767 --> 01:02:42,462
Thank heaven for Mr Johnson.

664
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:47,233
That man done brought prosperity
back to this neighbourhood.

665
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,630
You have my deepest sympathies,
Mrs Anders.

666
01:03:09,714 --> 01:03:13,493
I scrubbed kitchen floors 20 years
to get that boy a home.

667
01:03:13,593 --> 01:03:17,805
Tyrone was a fine young man
and he died with honour.

668
01:03:18,306 --> 01:03:20,391
Honour?

669
01:03:22,101 --> 01:03:25,396
He's dead, Mr Johnson.

670
01:03:26,105 --> 01:03:29,359
Where is the honour in that?

671
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:34,697
I'm...

672
01:03:35,657 --> 01:03:38,309
sorry.

673
01:03:38,409 --> 01:03:41,329
People call you a hero.

674
01:03:43,831 --> 01:03:46,793
You just a common thief!

675
01:03:48,711 --> 01:03:54,300
You stole the only reason I had to live.

676
01:04:09,482 --> 01:04:15,305
See that? Every soul in Harlem played
235 because of this damn headline.

677
01:04:15,405 --> 01:04:17,890
Well, people are superstitious, you know.

678
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:20,852
Well, I don't know
what we gonna do after this one.

679
01:04:20,952 --> 01:04:24,080
Cos if we hit hard,
this might be 80 grand.

680
01:04:24,872 --> 01:04:28,443
Pigfoot told me that Dutch changed
his number to 236.

681
01:04:28,543 --> 01:04:30,612
We are not gonna do that.

682
01:04:30,712 --> 01:04:34,032
People play the number,
they expect to get paid when they hit.

683
01:04:34,132 --> 01:04:36,242
We're just gonna have to pay 'em.

684
01:04:36,342 --> 01:04:39,370
And that's the difference
between you and Dutch.

685
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:42,348
And that's why I love you.

686
01:04:43,391 --> 01:04:46,269
Oh, cut it out!

687
01:04:47,019 --> 01:04:49,714
Boy, I sure wish I could find Miss Right.

688
01:04:49,814 --> 01:04:53,009
Shit! I don't mean that.
I'm looking for Miss Right Now.

689
01:04:53,109 --> 01:04:55,636
- Go on, make the payoffs.
- You the boss, Bumpy.

690
01:04:55,736 --> 01:04:57,805
I'm gonna make the payoffs.

691
01:04:57,905 --> 01:05:01,017
You know what 235 mean
in Madam Zora's dream book.

692
01:05:01,117 --> 01:05:04,145
- No. What?
- Death.

693
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:09,025
Yeah. Well, when I see him, I'm gonna
tell him I changed his number for today.

694
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:12,712
- Yes, sir. Good day, Miss Francine.
- Good day.

695
01:05:13,754 --> 01:05:16,783
Here you go, Mr Johnson.

696
01:05:16,883 --> 01:05:18,201
Enjoy.

697
01:05:18,301 --> 01:05:21,162
What are you doing?
You don't like banana splits.

698
01:05:21,262 --> 01:05:25,183
- I like your banana splits.
- Hold on. Hold on.

699
01:05:25,308 --> 01:05:27,835
What's wrong?

700
01:05:27,935 --> 01:05:31,339
- Mr Redmond.
- Yes, sir, Mr Johnson?

701
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:36,260
- Do you see these almonds on my split?
- Yes, sir. I see them almonds.

702
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,738
You know I don't like almonds on my split.

703
01:05:39,697 --> 01:05:44,285
Yes, sir, Mr Johnson. I know
you don't like almonds on your split.

704
01:05:44,577 --> 01:05:47,063
Did you put these almonds on my split?

705
01:05:47,163 --> 01:05:51,083
- No, sir, Mr Johnson.
- Then who did?

706
01:05:51,334 --> 01:05:53,794
Jimmy, the new boy.

707
01:05:54,337 --> 01:05:58,382
Jimmy, give me a few ticks.

708
01:05:58,883 --> 01:06:02,954
- What's up, Bump?
- Bumpy, don't start anything.

709
01:06:03,054 --> 01:06:06,082
- It's all right.
- What can I do for you, Mr Johnson?

710
01:06:06,182 --> 01:06:08,668
Did Mr Redmond tell you
I don't like almonds?

711
01:06:08,768 --> 01:06:12,505
- Oh, boy!
- Yes, he did. I must've made a mistake.

712
01:06:12,605 --> 01:06:18,719
Oh, that's all right. Listen,
why don't you bring me some hot fudge?

713
01:06:18,819 --> 01:06:21,931
- See if you got any hot fudge.
- What is wrong with you?

714
01:06:22,031 --> 01:06:25,351
Nothing. I just wanna show
Jimmy the difference

715
01:06:25,451 --> 01:06:29,689
between a traditional split
and the way I like mine.

716
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:31,566
- Here you go.
- Have a seat.

717
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:34,193
I wanna show you how to make
a traditional split.

718
01:06:34,293 --> 01:06:36,696
Then I'll show you
how I like to have a split.

719
01:06:36,796 --> 01:06:39,282
A traditional split
has all these trimmings.

720
01:06:39,382 --> 01:06:44,036
The almonds, the whipped cream,
the cherry and the hot fudge.

721
01:06:44,136 --> 01:06:48,641
Jimmy, why don't you sample that,
tell me what you think?

722
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:52,670
No, thanks, Mr Johnson.
I'm allergic to ice cream.

723
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:55,690
Allergic to ice cream?

724
01:07:01,112 --> 01:07:04,448
Sounds to me like you're
allergic to rat poison, boy.

725
01:07:05,116 --> 01:07:06,909
Let me do him, Bumpy!

726
01:07:08,995 --> 01:07:11,272
Put the knife down, Vallie.

727
01:07:11,372 --> 01:07:14,275
Mr Johnson, I swear I didn't know!

728
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:16,752
He said you wanted that boy to work here.

729
01:07:17,003 --> 01:07:19,505
Who said I wanted this boy to work here?

730
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:28,723
Who said I wanted this boy
to work here, Mr Redmond?

731
01:07:29,265 --> 01:07:31,542
- Vallie.
- Say it ain't so, Vallie!

732
01:07:31,642 --> 01:07:34,186
Die, motherfucker!

733
01:07:38,649 --> 01:07:42,762
Whispers, bring him over here
and sit him down.

734
01:07:42,862 --> 01:07:45,222
Come on, sit him down.

735
01:07:45,322 --> 01:07:48,434
Calvin, get Vallie outta here.

736
01:07:48,534 --> 01:07:52,438
- Don't breathe.
- Lowlife snake!

737
01:07:52,538 --> 01:07:54,832
Open that damn door. Get outta here!

738
01:07:55,082 --> 01:07:57,835
Francine, you go home with Whispers.

739
01:08:01,255 --> 01:08:04,909
Relax, Jimmy. Relax.

740
01:08:05,009 --> 01:08:08,179
- Bumpy.
- He'll be OK.

741
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,311
Mr Johnson...

742
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:23,694
Eat.

743
01:08:28,449 --> 01:08:30,743
He said eat!

744
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,374
- Mr Johnson...
- Eat.

745
01:08:45,925 --> 01:08:48,327
- Mr Redmond.
- Yes, sir, Mr Johnson.

746
01:08:48,427 --> 01:08:51,914
From now on, you make my split.

747
01:08:52,014 --> 01:08:54,308
Yes, sir, Mr Johnson.

748
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,817
You got me all wrong, Bumpy!

749
01:09:06,111 --> 01:09:10,891
- I just wanna know why, Vallie.
- Dutch gave me $3,000.

750
01:09:10,991 --> 01:09:14,270
- You know how much money that is?
- That's a handsome ransom.

751
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,230
- Yes, sir.
- Let me go

752
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:20,668
and I'll be on the first smoker
to Philly tonight. I promise!

753
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:27,741
That's a nice ring, Vallie. Did you get that
with the money that Dutch gave you?

754
01:09:27,841 --> 01:09:32,329
I got that from my Aunt Helen! It's
just a dime-store trick. I've had it years!

755
01:09:32,429 --> 01:09:35,958
- I ain't never seen it.
- Bumpy, please!

756
01:09:36,058 --> 01:09:41,213
You's a merciful man!
So, Bumpy, Bumpy, I'm begging you...

757
01:09:41,313 --> 01:09:45,843
Please, Bumpy, let me go! I promise
I'll be on the first train to Philly!

758
01:09:45,943 --> 01:09:48,320
OK. Come on, Vallie. Vallie.

759
01:09:48,445 --> 01:09:50,990
Shh shh shh. Come on. Get up.

760
01:09:52,283 --> 01:09:54,810
Bumpy... Please, please, Bumpy.

761
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:57,413
You gonna be all right.

762
01:09:59,373 --> 01:10:01,458
You hear?

763
01:10:03,043 --> 01:10:05,321
Go on. Have a seat.

764
01:10:05,421 --> 01:10:09,800
All right. Thank you.
Thank you, Bumpy. Thank you, Bumpy.

765
01:10:12,219 --> 01:10:14,680
- Go on, now, drink up.
- Thank you, Bumpy.

766
01:10:14,805 --> 01:10:17,641
God bless you, Bumpy. God bless you.

767
01:10:19,977 --> 01:10:21,437
Dirt!

768
01:10:22,271 --> 01:10:25,607
S-s-s-s-s-snake!

769
01:10:51,675 --> 01:10:54,011
How you doin', Vallie?

770
01:11:54,363 --> 01:11:58,909
It don't mean a thing
if it ain't got that swing...

771
01:11:59,201 --> 01:12:02,062
If Ziegfeld doesn't put you
in his fuckin' chorus,

772
01:12:02,162 --> 01:12:05,691
I'll put his head in a fuckin'
meat grinder! I swear to Christ!

773
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:08,610
You'd do that for me? Isn't he romantic?

774
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:11,547
A regular Rudy Valentino!

775
01:12:12,756 --> 01:12:16,635
- Hey! Where's he going?
- He thinks he owns the joint.

776
01:12:18,554 --> 01:12:23,850
It don't mean a thing
if it ain't got that swing...

777
01:12:28,105 --> 01:12:31,233
Hey, Owney, look what I fuckin' got!

778
01:12:39,992 --> 01:12:43,912
- No coloureds allowed in here.
- It's a new day, motherfucker!

779
01:13:07,978 --> 01:13:13,108
He's the guy who got Duke to work the club.
He's probably here to collect his fee.

780
01:13:13,233 --> 01:13:16,220
Go to the back door.
What the hell are you doing to me?

781
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,431
Disregard the fee, Owney.
I came to talk to the Dutchman.

782
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:22,643
All right. You struck a blow
for the negro cause.

783
01:13:22,743 --> 01:13:25,187
The first nigger
to get into the Cotton Club.

784
01:13:25,287 --> 01:13:28,899
- Now, get out!
- Do you know my man Whispers?

785
01:13:28,999 --> 01:13:31,151
Like you and I, he's a fan of Ellington.

786
01:13:31,251 --> 01:13:36,949
He'd appreciate it if you would sit down
and take it easy for a few ticks.

787
01:13:37,049 --> 01:13:39,117
Dutch, that was quite a performance.

788
01:13:39,217 --> 01:13:43,680
I didn't realise that you people
had such rhythm.

789
01:13:45,682 --> 01:13:47,960
- How's business?
- Not bad.

790
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,128
But let me tell you about yours.

791
01:13:50,228 --> 01:13:52,965
Your bank is at 351 Lenox Avenue.

792
01:13:53,065 --> 01:13:57,302
You runnin' policy out of stores
on Amsterdam, St Nick and Madison.

793
01:13:57,402 --> 01:14:01,181
I'm here to tell you you're shutting
your operations down tomorrow.

794
01:14:01,281 --> 01:14:04,601
You don't, I shut you down myself.

795
01:14:04,701 --> 01:14:07,162
- Is that so?
- Oh, that's so.

796
01:14:09,289 --> 01:14:13,210
I thought all you niggers
travelled in packs.

797
01:14:13,335 --> 01:14:16,338
Where's my buddy, Vallie?

798
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:21,092
Vallie had to leave town in a hurry,
but he left something for you.

799
01:14:22,135 --> 01:14:24,413
Here.

800
01:14:24,513 --> 01:14:27,416
Go ahead.
Pick yourself a winner with that.

801
01:14:27,516 --> 01:14:30,836
- I'm gonna be sick!
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

802
01:14:30,936 --> 01:14:34,606
You've been warned.
Get ready for your final thrill.

803
01:14:35,106 --> 01:14:36,883
No! Not in here!

804
01:14:36,983 --> 01:14:40,904
No, no! Not in the Cotton Club.
No guns in here. No! Outside.

805
01:14:41,863 --> 01:14:45,784
- Get the fuck outta here!
- It's curtains, Dutch.

806
01:14:45,909 --> 01:14:48,620
The jig is up.

807
01:14:50,372 --> 01:14:52,774
You're a dead fuckin' nigger!

808
01:14:52,874 --> 01:14:56,361
You hear me? You're dead!

809
01:14:56,461 --> 01:14:59,965
You come uptown. You come uptown!

810
01:15:00,966 --> 01:15:03,577
Bring Francie with ya.
I'll fuck her for ya!

811
01:15:03,677 --> 01:15:08,682
I hear she needs it. I know where
your high-yellow bitch is living!

812
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:18,608
You boys, do like I say do.

813
01:15:20,569 --> 01:15:24,489
There's enough dynamite
in these three crates

814
01:15:25,365 --> 01:15:28,493
to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge.

815
01:15:30,412 --> 01:15:35,417
I've set the timer for seven minutes. When
you're making the drop, pull the switch.

816
01:15:35,792 --> 01:15:38,587
Seven minutes and the bomb
goes off, right?

817
01:15:38,878 --> 01:15:41,239
I'm a professional, Mr Johnson.

818
01:15:41,339 --> 01:15:44,326
The question ain't what time
the bomb is gonna go off,

819
01:15:44,426 --> 01:15:48,872
it's whether you boys will get out
before it does. Do you understand?

820
01:15:48,972 --> 01:15:53,351
- Yeah, we feature what you're saying.
- Bumpy, Dutch got all his men uptown.

821
01:15:53,643 --> 01:15:58,773
His main liquor warehouse is downtown.
That's where he makes his longest green.

822
01:15:58,898 --> 01:16:01,927
You talking about going downtown
to blow this man's shit up?

823
01:16:02,027 --> 01:16:05,222
- Do you know what you're saying?
- Too risky.

824
01:16:05,322 --> 01:16:07,866
Besides, the Queen would be against it.

825
01:16:07,991 --> 01:16:13,330
The Queen ain't here, Whispers. And
while she ain't here, I'm carrying power.

826
01:16:14,539 --> 01:16:17,275
OK.

827
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:20,278
Calvin, I want you to cover the bank.
30, 40 men.

828
01:16:20,378 --> 01:16:24,115
- Got it.
- Whispers, look after Francine.

829
01:16:24,215 --> 01:16:29,246
I'm trusting you with her life.
Me and Illinois will make the drop.

830
01:16:29,346 --> 01:16:32,040
Yeah, all right. That's good.

831
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:35,794
I like that.
You know I'm with you, cousin.

832
01:16:35,894 --> 01:16:38,188
From the womb to the tomb.

833
01:16:54,204 --> 01:16:56,815
What's the matter?

834
01:16:56,915 --> 01:16:58,984
I don't wanna die, Bumpy.

835
01:16:59,084 --> 01:17:02,404
Remember when I came up from
South Carolina... how scared I was?

836
01:17:02,504 --> 01:17:06,157
Never seen that many people
in one place. Scared me to death.

837
01:17:06,257 --> 01:17:10,095
- I remember. I'm not that old.
- You remember what you said to me?

838
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:15,041
Yeah. I told you I'd look after you.
Wouldn't let nothing happen to you.

839
01:17:15,141 --> 01:17:18,812
Look me in my eye and tell me
you think I'm carrying you downtown

840
01:17:18,937 --> 01:17:20,605
so you can die.

841
01:17:20,897 --> 01:17:23,441
- I know you don't want that to happen.
- I need you.

842
01:17:23,566 --> 01:17:25,677
Some things, a man can't do alone.

843
01:17:25,777 --> 01:17:29,697
I need my man hard down
with his boots laced up.

844
01:17:31,324 --> 01:17:34,369
Now, you with me?

845
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:41,793
OK, Bumpy.

846
01:17:44,087 --> 01:17:47,699
- Did you set that timer, cousin?
- Yeah, we got seven minutes.

847
01:17:47,799 --> 01:17:50,510
You got your boots laced up?

848
01:17:52,262 --> 01:17:55,582
All right!
You don't need no liquor, Illinois.

849
01:17:55,682 --> 01:17:59,018
- Long as you with me, you're safe.
- All right.

850
01:18:00,353 --> 01:18:03,064
We can celebrate later, right?

851
01:18:22,292 --> 01:18:25,253
- What's this shit here?
- Yeast delivery.

852
01:18:38,558 --> 01:18:41,019
Yeast for the beer, sir.

853
01:18:44,606 --> 01:18:48,192
- Take your ass on in there.
- Thank you.

854
01:19:10,965 --> 01:19:13,451
We got three minutes.

855
01:19:13,551 --> 01:19:17,163
You boys are late. You're slowing
down my brewery. Where's Eugene?

856
01:19:17,263 --> 01:19:19,332
Um, he couldn't make it, sir.

857
01:19:19,432 --> 01:19:23,353
Come on, move your asses!
Get the yeast on the dock.

858
01:19:26,481 --> 01:19:28,566
Jesus Christ!

859
01:19:30,693 --> 01:19:33,071
Come on!

860
01:19:33,988 --> 01:19:35,865
That's it, sir.

861
01:19:37,784 --> 01:19:41,120
I just need you to sign
on the dotted line.

862
01:19:42,747 --> 01:19:44,832
We need to be going now.

863
01:19:47,627 --> 01:19:51,990
- What's wrong with you, boy?
- Nothin', boss. Just a little tired.

864
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:55,843
We got all these deliveries still to make.

865
01:20:01,933 --> 01:20:04,877
I don't understand why Eugene
couldn't make the run.

866
01:20:04,977 --> 01:20:09,398
Eugene went out last night and got
just as drunk as a fiddler's bitch.

867
01:20:10,066 --> 01:20:12,610
That's when they called us, sir.

868
01:20:17,073 --> 01:20:19,450
Eugene's a fucking Mormon. He don't drink.

869
01:20:19,575 --> 01:20:24,163
That's the problem.
He got himself kicked out the church.

870
01:20:25,832 --> 01:20:28,918
Hey, where you goin'?

871
01:20:30,795 --> 01:20:32,864
We don't want no trouble, sir.

872
01:20:32,964 --> 01:20:36,884
Like I said,
we just got all these deliveries.

873
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,165
You boys stay put. I'm gonna get the boss.

874
01:20:42,265 --> 01:20:45,393
- Don't move.
- Yes, sir.

875
01:21:02,618 --> 01:21:03,953
Hey!

876
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:11,711
Hit the gas!

877
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:39,780
Now, I'll ask you one more time!
Where is he?

878
01:21:39,906 --> 01:21:42,617
I don't know! I don't know...

879
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:45,786
Hey, Dutch, you don't have to do that.

880
01:21:49,665 --> 01:21:53,294
Hey, Bub, toughen up a little, will ya?

881
01:22:30,122 --> 01:22:32,625
Mary? Ohh...

882
01:23:07,743 --> 01:23:13,024
I've got bodies all over
the front page of the Daily News!

883
01:23:13,124 --> 01:23:16,861
I got that pansy Hoover calling me,
asking if I need his help.

884
01:23:16,961 --> 01:23:20,573
- You put my dick in a wringer.
- Dutch didn't instigate this.

885
01:23:20,673 --> 01:23:22,950
Let me explain something to you.

886
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:28,264
If one crazy negro is provoked into
coming downtown, they'll all come.

887
01:23:29,723 --> 01:23:34,045
I can't afford to have all of Harlem
crossing the line because of you.

888
01:23:34,145 --> 01:23:36,839
You get this numbers thing settled,

889
01:23:36,939 --> 01:23:41,010
or I will launch an investigation
into every syndicate activity.

890
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:44,738
Do you get that, you wop pimp?

891
01:24:01,463 --> 01:24:05,951
Vide 'o mare quant'è bello

892
01:24:06,051 --> 01:24:10,414
Spira tantu sentimento

893
01:24:10,514 --> 01:24:15,603
Comme tu a chi tiene mente

894
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,441
Ca scetato 'o fai sunnà

895
01:24:38,959 --> 01:24:41,654
I thought it was about time we meet,
Mr Johnson.

896
01:24:41,754 --> 01:24:44,990
- I was honoured by your invitation.
- Thank you.

897
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:47,384
A friend in Sing Sing says you play chess.

898
01:24:47,593 --> 01:24:53,123
- You partake in the game?
- Nah. Only in its strategies.

899
01:24:53,223 --> 01:24:55,517
Franco, pigghia 'u cane.

900
01:24:57,519 --> 01:24:59,713
Shall we go for a walk?

901
01:24:59,813 --> 01:25:02,274
You're in good hands, boys.

902
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:07,221
I love this place.

903
01:25:07,321 --> 01:25:11,892
I was under the impression that you
and the Dutchman were partners.

904
01:25:11,992 --> 01:25:17,648
Dutch Schultz doesn't recognise that
a partnership requires compromises.

905
01:25:17,748 --> 01:25:21,043
I think you do.
This is about money, Mr Johnson.

906
01:25:21,794 --> 01:25:25,573
If you get a piece of my operation,
what will you offer me in return?

907
01:25:25,673 --> 01:25:28,033
For starters, political connections.

908
01:25:28,133 --> 01:25:31,620
The kind that'll keep you
from suffering like Madam St Clair.

909
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:35,766
If a man wants to be successful in
this business, he has to make alliances.

910
01:25:36,016 --> 01:25:38,419
- You got judges?
- Even better.

911
01:25:38,519 --> 01:25:40,796
The special prosecutor.

912
01:25:40,896 --> 01:25:45,067
- Thomas Dewey?
- He's as greedy as the rest of them.

913
01:25:49,822 --> 01:25:53,742
I appreciate your offer,
but my answer is no.

914
01:25:54,702 --> 01:25:59,415
- I'm strictly an independent operator.
- So be it.

915
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:04,320
But your move downtown
affects me as well as Mr Schultz.

916
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:08,298
It was a clever gambit,
Mr Johnson... your brewery job.

917
01:26:08,507 --> 01:26:11,285
But a meeting is required
to discuss these problems.

918
01:26:11,385 --> 01:26:13,537
The Dutchman and I are past discussion.

919
01:26:13,637 --> 01:26:17,641
It's not a request.
I'll call you with the time.

920
01:26:18,725 --> 01:26:19,977
What can I do you for?

921
01:26:20,102 --> 01:26:24,298
This thing between you and Mr Johnson
has gone way past bedtime.

922
01:26:24,398 --> 01:26:28,719
Why do you give a fuck? It ain't got
nothing to do with your whore business.

923
01:26:28,819 --> 01:26:31,363
If Tom Dewey clamps down,
it affects all of us.

924
01:26:31,613 --> 01:26:33,974
I'm the guy Dewey's
having wet dreams about.

925
01:26:34,074 --> 01:26:38,729
Exactly. Numbers has him looking to
open up a pan on all our business.

926
01:26:38,829 --> 01:26:41,373
You get me out of fuckin' bed for this?

927
01:26:41,498 --> 01:26:44,818
What's the other news?
Roosevelt running for re-election?

928
01:26:44,918 --> 01:26:49,715
Close. I wanna bring
Mr Johnson to our table.

929
01:26:49,923 --> 01:26:53,452
We do not bring that nigger
into my presence.

930
01:26:53,552 --> 01:26:57,081
We're having a sit-down, Dutch.
We're gonna settle things.

931
01:26:57,181 --> 01:27:00,793
- Is this your fuckin' strategy?
- My strategy is to keep order.

932
01:27:00,893 --> 01:27:03,587
My responsibility is the bigger picture.

933
01:27:03,687 --> 01:27:08,483
If I say no, does Vito send his boys to my
house in the middle of the fuckin' night?

934
01:27:08,609 --> 01:27:11,945
I'm warning you, Luciano.
Don't fuck with me.

935
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:17,101
- You been outvoted.
- OK, have it your way.

936
01:27:17,201 --> 01:27:20,913
Bring him to the fucking table.
Have him over for fuckin' dinner.

937
01:27:21,288 --> 01:27:23,290
Cecil, pull the fuck over!

938
01:27:27,294 --> 01:27:30,839
Where are you going?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

939
01:27:34,676 --> 01:27:37,788
To the library.
I'll take out that book you been reading:

940
01:27:37,888 --> 01:27:41,016
How to Fuck Friends and Irritate People.

941
01:27:44,686 --> 01:27:48,690
It look like the parole board
will let me out any day now.

942
01:27:49,441 --> 01:27:54,096
Then we'll have a celebration...
all up and down Lenox Avenue.

943
01:27:54,196 --> 01:27:58,433
You'll be happy to know that the bank
is making more money now than ever.

944
01:27:58,533 --> 01:28:03,956
When I take possession of me bank,
you will no longer work for the Queen.

945
01:28:05,999 --> 01:28:10,671
- What are you talking about?
- You broke your promise. You lied!

946
01:28:12,631 --> 01:28:15,325
I wasn't able to keep that promise.

947
01:28:15,425 --> 01:28:18,370
We had to fight for the bank.
Dutch wasn't gonna let up.

948
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:23,850
You villain. You are not gonna let up.
I can see that now.

949
01:28:24,101 --> 01:28:27,421
I've been invited to
the syndicate table by Mr Luciano.

950
01:28:27,521 --> 01:28:31,149
- Don't that count for nothing?
- What about life?

951
01:28:32,067 --> 01:28:34,903
Doesn't life count for anything?

952
01:28:36,446 --> 01:28:42,119
You asked me to take control
of the bank while you were gone.

953
01:28:42,994 --> 01:28:45,272
I did that and kept it
out of Dutch's hands.

954
01:28:45,372 --> 01:28:49,401
Now, you wanna come back and run it
with me, I'll welcome you with open arms.

955
01:28:49,501 --> 01:28:51,962
But we will do it together.

956
01:28:52,087 --> 01:28:55,632
So I guess you the king now, eh?

957
01:28:56,925 --> 01:28:59,678
Long live the king!

958
01:29:20,323 --> 01:29:22,517
Lovey, why aren't you dressed?

959
01:29:22,617 --> 01:29:27,414
I told Sam and them we'd meet them
at the Sugar Cane Club in half an hour.

960
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:31,126
Bumpy, I'm leaving you.

961
01:29:38,633 --> 01:29:41,244
You're leaving me?

962
01:29:41,344 --> 01:29:42,971
Yes.

963
01:29:45,807 --> 01:29:48,101
Hold on a few ticks.

964
01:29:59,571 --> 01:30:01,948
You going? Take that with you!

965
01:30:04,034 --> 01:30:06,286
And that, too.

966
01:30:08,622 --> 01:30:11,333
I don't care about your trophies!

967
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:14,820
- You don't want any?
- It was wrong for me to take 'em.

968
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:19,241
It was, was it? You took 'em nevertheless,
didn't ya? Take it all!

969
01:30:19,341 --> 01:30:22,077
- I don't want any of this shit!
- Watch your language!

970
01:30:22,177 --> 01:30:25,914
- You go to hell!
- You're playing with fire.

971
01:30:26,014 --> 01:30:29,935
You and your noble ideas!
And all your promises!

972
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:36,174
- You lied to me!
- You lied to yourself, Francine.

973
01:30:36,274 --> 01:30:40,320
When you left that stiff in the bathroom.

974
01:30:42,072 --> 01:30:45,308
You are just like Dutch Schultz.
You're a pig!

975
01:30:45,408 --> 01:30:49,329
If it wasn't for you,
Mary would still be alive!

976
01:30:49,454 --> 01:30:52,374
Yeah, I said it! You're a pig!

977
01:30:53,291 --> 01:30:56,778
You gonna hit me now? Bumpy, come on!

978
01:30:56,878 --> 01:30:59,172
Come on. Hit me.

979
01:31:11,434 --> 01:31:13,770
Why...?

980
01:31:13,979 --> 01:31:18,817
- Francine, you used to be...
- Well, you used to be a human being.

981
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:24,280
Used to be the man I loved.

982
01:31:28,284 --> 01:31:30,787
Sit down.

983
01:31:30,954 --> 01:31:33,665
I been sitting down too long.

984
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:37,335
I gotta go.

985
01:31:39,754 --> 01:31:42,298
Yeah, well,

986
01:31:44,718 --> 01:31:47,429
don't forget your good book.

987
01:31:51,016 --> 01:31:54,227
You used to write me poetry, Ellsworth.

988
01:32:16,082 --> 01:32:18,918
Make sure nothing happens to her.

989
01:32:23,715 --> 01:32:26,159
I'm a police captain,
for the love of Mike!

990
01:32:26,259 --> 01:32:28,870
How's it gonna look
if I'm seen with a nigger?

991
01:32:28,970 --> 01:32:31,623
That's all the ''niggers''
I'm gonna take from you.

992
01:32:31,723 --> 01:32:36,144
- What did you say to me?
- That's all the ''niggers'' I'm gonna take.

993
01:32:36,728 --> 01:32:41,508
That's one more than I'll take!
I don't ride with niggers in my car!

994
01:32:41,608 --> 01:32:44,319
Enough of this shit!

995
01:32:47,238 --> 01:32:49,324
Hewlett, sit down.

996
01:32:53,828 --> 01:32:55,605
- Jack.
- Yes?

997
01:32:55,705 --> 01:33:00,752
We go back 15 years, but I'll cut
your head off and drop it in the river.

998
01:33:01,044 --> 01:33:04,422
- What are you doin' to me?
- You wanna test me?

999
01:33:04,881 --> 01:33:07,742
Hewlett, I own you. You do as I tell you.

1000
01:33:07,842 --> 01:33:13,473
Put aside your differences for the time
being. We got a job to do. Shake hands.

1001
01:33:16,976 --> 01:33:19,270
Shake hands.

1002
01:33:21,105 --> 01:33:24,859
That's very nice. A truce.
Fuckin' beautiful.

1003
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:27,929
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1004
01:33:28,029 --> 01:33:31,474
Hewlett, why don't you take
some of this stuff home with ya?

1005
01:33:31,574 --> 01:33:34,118
Me and Foley didn't even finish
the sandwiches.

1006
01:33:34,244 --> 01:33:38,606
- No, Dutch. It ain't necessary.
- It'll go in the garbage otherwise.

1007
01:33:38,706 --> 01:33:41,609
You got all them grandkids to feed.

1008
01:33:41,709 --> 01:33:44,003
It ain't necessary.

1009
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:48,341
Don't be proud.

1010
01:33:48,716 --> 01:33:51,886
Wrap up the scraps and take 'em home.

1011
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,652
Thank you, Dutch.

1012
01:34:24,752 --> 01:34:26,963
It ain't nothin'.

1013
01:34:31,676 --> 01:34:36,664
- Leave me alone. Let me be.
- Here, here. Take it easy.

1014
01:34:36,764 --> 01:34:39,475
Can't you see we tryin' to play a game?

1015
01:34:40,893 --> 01:34:43,396
It be OK.

1016
01:34:44,397 --> 01:34:46,315
I see.

1017
01:34:47,525 --> 01:34:50,069
You wanna know what I see?

1018
01:34:52,655 --> 01:34:56,267
I done seen more people die
in the last six months

1019
01:34:56,367 --> 01:34:59,078
than I have in my whole life.

1020
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:04,108
Now, you leave me alone and let me
go play my song for Miss Mary.

1021
01:35:04,208 --> 01:35:07,654
- I understand you upset about Pigfoot.
- Mary!

1022
01:35:07,754 --> 01:35:12,951
That's her name! And you don't give
a good goddamn about her, no way.

1023
01:35:13,051 --> 01:35:16,245
You couldn't even come
to the goddamn funeral!

1024
01:35:16,345 --> 01:35:20,266
- I paid my respects.
- Fuckass flowers don't mean a thing!

1025
01:35:20,391 --> 01:35:24,295
They don't mean shit! You should've
brought your black ass over there.

1026
01:35:24,395 --> 01:35:30,009
Me going to church and you carrying on
ain't gonna bring Mary back, is it?

1027
01:35:30,109 --> 01:35:31,944
Let me ask you something.

1028
01:35:32,195 --> 01:35:35,431
How many of the general's
foot soldiers got to die

1029
01:35:35,531 --> 01:35:41,204
before you see that they playin' you just
like I'm playin' that raggedy-ass piano?

1030
01:35:42,914 --> 01:35:45,566
Dutch got niggers working for him.

1031
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:49,170
We kill them, and it all work out

1032
01:35:50,254 --> 01:35:53,549
so we all just killin' each other.

1033
01:35:56,636 --> 01:36:00,790
Any nigger fool enough to work
for the Dutchman deserve to die.

1034
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:03,167
How you sound!

1035
01:36:03,267 --> 01:36:06,521
You think innocent people deserve to die?

1036
01:36:07,647 --> 01:36:10,091
Tyrone?

1037
01:36:10,191 --> 01:36:11,734
My Mary?

1038
01:36:13,819 --> 01:36:17,573
You there like you ain't got
nothing to say to me.

1039
01:36:20,117 --> 01:36:25,248
Let's see what Mr Speaker got to say.
He always got a word for ya.

1040
01:36:25,873 --> 01:36:29,193
- Illy.
- Come on! Give it to me! Huh?

1041
01:36:29,293 --> 01:36:33,448
- Take it easy, man!
- It's all right. Turn him loose.

1042
01:36:33,548 --> 01:36:37,093
I wish I never gave you
that motherfuckin' gun!

1043
01:36:37,927 --> 01:36:40,830
Ooh, I'm sorry! I shouldn't have cussed!

1044
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:44,417
You need to go home.
You drunk on that King Kong.

1045
01:36:44,517 --> 01:36:50,006
- You drunk on yourself.
- Illinois, don't let me raise up

1046
01:36:50,106 --> 01:36:53,776
and come over there
and put my hands on you, hear?

1047
01:36:54,652 --> 01:36:57,530
That's how you talk to me now? Huh?

1048
01:36:59,615 --> 01:37:01,684
- You talking to me...
- I done told you!

1049
01:37:01,784 --> 01:37:04,912
Take yo' drunk ass home!

1050
01:37:09,041 --> 01:37:11,335
All right, then.

1051
01:37:12,461 --> 01:37:14,755
I'm gonna do what you say.

1052
01:37:15,673 --> 01:37:21,512
No! Illinois a good soldier!
Always do what General Bumpy say!

1053
01:37:25,308 --> 01:37:27,376
But let me put this on your mind.

1054
01:37:27,476 --> 01:37:33,107
You smoke this over when you're going
down your list of accomplishments.

1055
01:37:36,485 --> 01:37:41,073
Harlem used to be still
and silent at night.

1056
01:37:43,868 --> 01:37:47,788
You can thank yourself
for the way it is now.

1057
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,108
I'm through, cousin.

1058
01:37:51,208 --> 01:37:55,129
You can fight this war
by your goddamn self now!

1059
01:37:55,254 --> 01:37:57,740
I'm through.

1060
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:03,471
I'm like Jack the Bear's brother.
I can't go no further.

1061
01:38:05,306 --> 01:38:09,060
See? Good. Now you got two guns.

1062
01:38:14,857 --> 01:38:17,468
I'm gonna hold onto this for you, Bear.

1063
01:38:17,568 --> 01:38:21,722
Come on. Tell me a joke.

1064
01:38:21,822 --> 01:38:26,619
Come on, Illy. Tell Whispers a joke.

1065
01:38:28,245 --> 01:38:30,706
We the joke, Whispers.

1066
01:38:31,874 --> 01:38:34,585
You don't hear Dutch laughin'?

1067
01:38:52,728 --> 01:38:55,005
Tiny!

1068
01:38:55,105 --> 01:38:57,817
Tiny, let's have a talk.

1069
01:38:59,443 --> 01:39:03,364
- Come on over.
- Officer Foley!

1070
01:39:07,076 --> 01:39:09,770
I'm just fuckin' with ya.

1071
01:39:09,870 --> 01:39:12,982
I don't think you should do that, Tiny.

1072
01:39:13,082 --> 01:39:17,862
You're right. You the law!
I've been looking for you.

1073
01:39:17,962 --> 01:39:20,172
See how lucky you are? Here I am.

1074
01:39:20,631 --> 01:39:23,551
I got some good news for you.

1075
01:39:24,718 --> 01:39:28,456
You, too. I just want you to know

1076
01:39:28,556 --> 01:39:34,670
that from now on you won't have
no more trouble out of Illinois Gordon!

1077
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:40,192
That's right.
I wash my hands. I'm through.

1078
01:39:42,695 --> 01:39:46,031
- I'm out.
- Do you have trouble learning, son?

1079
01:39:46,865 --> 01:39:48,726
No, sir.

1080
01:39:48,826 --> 01:39:52,521
They should've taught you
a long time ago that once you're in,

1081
01:39:52,621 --> 01:39:54,899
you can't get out.

1082
01:39:54,999 --> 01:39:57,293
They should've.

1083
01:39:59,003 --> 01:40:01,071
- Get your ass in!
- I'm sorry!

1084
01:40:01,171 --> 01:40:03,465
Get your ass in!

1085
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:14,084
You're making it
awfully hard on yourself, son.

1086
01:40:14,184 --> 01:40:16,645
So I'll ask you again.

1087
01:40:18,105 --> 01:40:21,025
Where do you hide the policy slips?

1088
01:40:24,403 --> 01:40:26,947
- Would you like to have a go?
- That's you.

1089
01:40:27,072 --> 01:40:29,725
It is me, isn't it?

1090
01:40:29,825 --> 01:40:31,702
That it is.

1091
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:40,861
I see why Bumpy don't go to church, Bub.

1092
01:40:40,961 --> 01:40:43,322
What?

1093
01:40:43,422 --> 01:40:45,616
Kill

1094
01:40:45,716 --> 01:40:49,411
or be... or be killed.

1095
01:40:49,511 --> 01:40:54,892
Jesus Christ, Foley.
He ain't gonna talk. Let him go.

1096
01:40:55,309 --> 01:40:58,003
Oh, yes, he is.

1097
01:40:58,103 --> 01:41:00,397
He's gonna talk!

1098
01:41:01,899 --> 01:41:04,276
Sure you don't want to have a go?

1099
01:41:04,401 --> 01:41:09,156
- I'm going.
- Suit yourself.

1100
01:41:09,948 --> 01:41:16,622
Now, we both know
you're gonna talk, don't we?

1101
01:41:17,247 --> 01:41:20,776
Cos I will ram this corkscrew
up your nostrils

1102
01:41:20,876 --> 01:41:22,961
till I pop your eyeballs out.

1103
01:41:23,253 --> 01:41:26,173
And you know I'll do it, don't you?

1104
01:41:27,299 --> 01:41:30,786
OK, OK.

1105
01:41:30,886 --> 01:41:32,746
OK!

1106
01:41:32,846 --> 01:41:36,391
You have something to tell me, then, huh?

1107
01:41:37,434 --> 01:41:40,145
All right. What is it?

1108
01:41:44,066 --> 01:41:46,552
What? What? I can't hear you.

1109
01:41:46,652 --> 01:41:54,143
My cousin is gonna fuck you up
real bad behind this,

1110
01:41:54,243 --> 01:41:58,622
Officer Foley!

1111
01:42:02,125 --> 01:42:07,156
The dividing line could conceivably
be 135th Street running east to west

1112
01:42:07,256 --> 01:42:10,784
and Lenox Avenue running north to south.

1113
01:42:10,884 --> 01:42:13,787
Mr Schultz would take one territory

1114
01:42:13,887 --> 01:42:16,890
and Mr Johnson the other.

1115
01:42:19,726 --> 01:42:24,715
I can't accept any proposal that allows
Mr Schultz to operate freely in Harlem.

1116
01:42:24,815 --> 01:42:29,052
As I said before, I have no quarrel
with any of you gentlemen.

1117
01:42:29,152 --> 01:42:33,073
But if Mr Schultz
insists on coming uptown,

1118
01:42:33,198 --> 01:42:37,452
I have no choice but to make
my presence felt downtown.

1119
01:42:39,079 --> 01:42:41,982
Such a course of action
will bring about your demise.

1120
01:42:42,082 --> 01:42:46,587
Dutch been tryin' to bring about
my demise for quite some time.

1121
01:42:47,379 --> 01:42:50,507
- I'm not Dutch.
- Yeah, you Lucky.

1122
01:42:53,176 --> 01:42:58,724
- You got nuts the size of watermelons.
- Dutch, enough with the compliments.

1123
01:43:01,226 --> 01:43:04,546
Perhaps you gentlemen need more time
to consider my proposal.

1124
01:43:04,646 --> 01:43:07,899
We ain't gotta consider a fuckin' thing!

1125
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:12,137
Your days are numbered,
if you'll pardon the expression.

1126
01:43:12,237 --> 01:43:15,807
- You're pretty smart for a nigger.
- Yeah, so are you.

1127
01:43:15,907 --> 01:43:20,479
Well, that's good. Insult the man who
holds your destiny between his fingers.

1128
01:43:20,579 --> 01:43:24,983
So you got some slips.
I'll beat the rap hands down.

1129
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:27,794
Oh! Like the glorious
Madam Queen of Policy?

1130
01:43:30,339 --> 01:43:33,825
My judge is sending your black ass
to fuckin' jail!

1131
01:43:33,925 --> 01:43:36,428
Jesus Christ!

1132
01:43:42,517 --> 01:43:43,961
Your move.

1133
01:43:44,061 --> 01:43:46,129
- Bump?
- Yeah?

1134
01:43:46,229 --> 01:43:51,718
Illinois was the only one besides you who
knew where them slips was hidden, man.

1135
01:43:51,818 --> 01:43:55,155
That don't make him
a stool pigeon, Calvin.

1136
01:44:11,755 --> 01:44:13,840
- Bumpy...
- Yeah?

1137
01:44:14,758 --> 01:44:17,052
We found him.

1138
01:45:02,514 --> 01:45:07,169
That old brick-presser over there
said he saw a cop string him up.

1139
01:45:07,269 --> 01:45:10,230
The cop had captain's bars.

1140
01:45:49,185 --> 01:45:52,506
Kiss it again! Oh, yeah!

1141
01:45:52,606 --> 01:45:55,859
Oh, God, I love you, girl. Oh, yes!

1142
01:45:56,818 --> 01:46:00,989
- Aye, you do that so good!
- Thank you, Billy.

1143
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:08,288
Hey, what did you put it away for?

1144
01:46:10,582 --> 01:46:13,293
What are you doing? You can't stop...

1145
01:46:19,841 --> 01:46:25,055
Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Wait, wait.
Let me finish putting my pants on.

1146
01:47:04,844 --> 01:47:07,097
Hey, Bub.

1147
01:47:09,557 --> 01:47:11,376
- You touch Illinois?
- No.

1148
01:47:11,476 --> 01:47:13,670
Did you put your hands on my family?

1149
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:16,881
- I said, fuck no!
- You didn't do nothing to stop it.

1150
01:47:16,981 --> 01:47:21,027
If there's blood on my hands,
there's blood on yours, too.

1151
01:47:21,319 --> 01:47:26,516
- You ain't no better than me.
- How you sleep at night, old man?

1152
01:47:26,616 --> 01:47:29,744
How the fuck do you know I sleep at all?

1153
01:47:33,123 --> 01:47:35,417
You owe me.

1154
01:47:38,128 --> 01:47:41,464
You ain't no better than me!
You ain't no better than me.

1155
01:48:45,445 --> 01:48:49,574
- Sit down.
- Your man said you had a proposal.

1156
01:48:50,033 --> 01:48:54,621
If the Dutchman wins,
everybody in Harlem loses,

1157
01:48:55,371 --> 01:48:58,207
including you and me.

1158
01:49:15,683 --> 01:49:17,769
Go on.

1159
01:49:21,981 --> 01:49:24,275
Smoke this over.

1160
01:49:25,026 --> 01:49:28,847
When I went in the joint,
you ran the fiercest gang in Harlem.

1161
01:49:28,947 --> 01:49:31,099
I come out, you workin' for the Dutchman.

1162
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:35,895
With everything that's been goin' on
for the last year and a half, I start thinkin'.

1163
01:49:35,995 --> 01:49:40,608
How'd the Dutchman get so high up
on the ladder? Cos of you.

1164
01:49:40,708 --> 01:49:43,378
How come the Queen's still got her bank?

1165
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:14,017
- Why the change of heart?
- The Dutchman's got me boxed in.

1166
01:50:14,117 --> 01:50:18,896
And I need your connections so I don't
take the fall for those policy slips.

1167
01:50:18,996 --> 01:50:22,609
Besides, a coloured man don't stand
much of a chance buying Tom Dewey.

1168
01:50:22,709 --> 01:50:26,713
Tom Dewey would take a payment
from an aardvark.

1169
01:50:28,172 --> 01:50:30,992
I could also use your muscle
to keep Dutch off my back.

1170
01:50:31,092 --> 01:50:36,931
You know the terms of a partnership now,
at this juncture, would be quite severe?

1171
01:50:39,016 --> 01:50:42,628
A wise man once told me, Mr Luciano,

1172
01:50:42,728 --> 01:50:46,424
that if a man wants to succeed
in this business,

1173
01:50:46,524 --> 01:50:49,427
he has to make alliances.

1174
01:50:49,527 --> 01:50:51,387
Nice.

1175
01:50:51,487 --> 01:50:54,474
Should I drive around the yard
once again, Mr Luciano?

1176
01:50:54,574 --> 01:50:57,201
One more time, Cecil.

1177
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:01,689
How can I get assurances
you'll play square?

1178
01:51:01,789 --> 01:51:04,734
Have your accountant
come by my controller's house.

1179
01:51:04,834 --> 01:51:08,571
Say around three o'clock.
I'll let him go over the books.

1180
01:51:08,671 --> 01:51:11,674
The runners, routes, slips, everything.

1181
01:51:13,468 --> 01:51:19,807
You know, a funny thing about Dutch.
He's worth $3 million. Easy.

1182
01:51:23,102 --> 01:51:27,131
You'd think a guy makin' that kind of
dough would make himself look proper.

1183
01:51:27,231 --> 01:51:29,942
Nice clothes, good haircut.

1184
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:35,181
Instead, he looks like a vagrant
half the times.

1185
01:51:35,281 --> 01:51:38,618
He buys his suits off the rack
at Wanamaker's.

1186
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:42,163
If you don't know, you don't know.

1187
01:51:42,788 --> 01:51:46,334
- Do you know, Mr Johnson?
- I believe I do.

1188
01:51:51,005 --> 01:51:53,299
Then what happened?

1189
01:51:54,383 --> 01:51:57,829
Mr Luciano...
he don't think I be listening.

1190
01:51:57,929 --> 01:52:00,623
But I be hearing
every word they be saying,

1191
01:52:00,723 --> 01:52:04,977
on account I got the partition...
it's cracked.

1192
01:52:05,436 --> 01:52:07,505
Go on.

1193
01:52:07,605 --> 01:52:13,094
Bumpy Johnson say he need a partner
to help him beat you for the numbers.

1194
01:52:13,194 --> 01:52:14,303
And?

1195
01:52:14,403 --> 01:52:17,431
Bumpy Johnson asked Mr Luciano
to have Mr Johnny,

1196
01:52:17,531 --> 01:52:21,310
the fella that's good with figures,
to meet him this afternoon

1197
01:52:21,410 --> 01:52:23,871
so he can go over his books.

1198
01:52:27,917 --> 01:52:31,796
- Take the yard.
- Yes, sir.

1199
01:52:32,588 --> 01:52:34,882
Thank you, Mr Schultz.

1200
01:52:35,508 --> 01:52:38,494
If you're right, there's more
where that come from.

1201
01:52:38,594 --> 01:52:41,097
You won't say anything
to Mr Luciano, will ya?

1202
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:45,209
- My lips are sealed.
- Thank you, sir.

1203
01:52:45,309 --> 01:52:46,836
- Cecil.
- Yes, sir?

1204
01:52:46,936 --> 01:52:49,480
If you're lying,
you know what I'll do to you.

1205
01:52:49,855 --> 01:52:53,234
- Yes, sir. I know.
- So long as you know.

1206
01:52:54,110 --> 01:52:57,238
Yes, sir. Everybody know.

1207
01:53:00,908 --> 01:53:06,022
Don't that just figure?
A coloured and a dago partnered up!

1208
01:53:06,122 --> 01:53:10,901
Sicilians, they're nearly niggers anyways.

1209
01:53:11,001 --> 01:53:14,630
They're dark-complected bastards.

1210
01:53:15,339 --> 01:53:20,119
Takin' on Lucky, we're gonna
be in a whole lotta shit.

1211
01:53:20,219 --> 01:53:23,973
- What's up, Bub?
- Nothin'.

1212
01:53:24,265 --> 01:53:26,542
You goin' soft?

1213
01:53:26,642 --> 01:53:30,146
I'm behind you, Dutch. A hundred percent.

1214
01:53:39,447 --> 01:53:42,575
Good work, Cecil. Present from Bumpy.

1215
01:53:51,876 --> 01:53:54,587
- Here we go.
- Hold it.

1216
01:53:56,130 --> 01:53:57,673
We can wait.

1217
01:54:21,655 --> 01:54:23,032
There's Figures. Let's go.

1218
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:30,164
- Hey, Johnny. How ya doin'?
- Hey, Dutch. How are...

1219
01:54:31,415 --> 01:54:33,542
Little prick!

1220
01:54:38,631 --> 01:54:42,259
Vince, go back down and watch the door.

1221
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:50,267
- Is this it?
- Please, please...! Yes!

1222
01:55:32,476 --> 01:55:35,562
- Where is he?
- I don't know, Dutch.

1223
01:55:47,408 --> 01:55:50,269
What's 235?

1224
01:55:50,369 --> 01:55:52,663
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1225
01:55:53,747 --> 01:55:56,275
235.

1226
01:55:56,375 --> 01:55:58,961
It means death.

1227
01:56:00,629 --> 01:56:04,450
Please, Dutch. I'm only an accountant.

1228
01:56:04,550 --> 01:56:08,262
- You let me live, I'll make sure...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1229
01:56:16,937 --> 01:56:18,797
What's our next move?

1230
01:56:18,897 --> 01:56:22,443
I got a surprise
for little Arthur Flegenheimer.

1231
01:56:28,615 --> 01:56:30,701
Let's go!

1232
01:56:37,082 --> 01:56:39,168
Dewey's office. This way.

1233
01:56:42,004 --> 01:56:44,089
Quickly.

1234
01:57:05,319 --> 01:57:08,639
- Where's Hewlett?
- Still looking for Bumpy Johnson.

1235
01:57:08,739 --> 01:57:11,074
He wanted that 4,000 you promised.

1236
01:57:13,952 --> 01:57:17,898
You know,
it just doesn't make sense to me.

1237
01:57:17,998 --> 01:57:22,361
I don't ever see that jigaboo
making a deal with a white guy.

1238
01:57:22,461 --> 01:57:25,406
I mean, even if he's a Sicilian.

1239
01:57:25,506 --> 01:57:29,076
Yeah, well, Lulu,
that's cos you're a fuckin' idiot.

1240
01:57:29,176 --> 01:57:34,164
He never had no intention.
He set me up for a war with Luciano.

1241
01:57:34,264 --> 01:57:38,127
- That's pretty smart for a nigger.
- Yeah!

1242
01:57:38,227 --> 01:57:40,337
If Luciano wants a fuckin' war,

1243
01:57:40,437 --> 01:57:43,966
I'll splatter this fuckin' city
with his blood.

1244
01:57:44,066 --> 01:57:47,194
- I'm gonna take a piss.
- OK, Dutch.

1245
01:58:09,424 --> 01:58:12,803
What do you want? I'm fuckin' busy here.

1246
01:58:17,474 --> 01:58:20,811
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me!
They send you.

1247
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:34,801
It's done.

1248
01:59:35,093 --> 01:59:37,804
Where's the money?

1249
01:59:59,242 --> 02:00:02,979
- Hello.
- I wanna tell you this myself.

1250
02:00:03,079 --> 02:00:06,692
Bumpy Johnson just made me
a very wealthy man.

1251
02:00:06,792 --> 02:00:10,712
He took care of the Dutch Schultz
problem, and he used you to do it.

1252
02:00:11,254 --> 02:00:14,366
Not that you would have occasion to,

1253
02:00:14,466 --> 02:00:18,178
but, if I were you, Lucky,
I'd never go to Harlem.

1254
02:01:02,764 --> 02:01:05,625
The Dutchman's dead.

1255
02:01:05,725 --> 02:01:09,463
- Did Thomas Dewey get his money?
- Yes.

1256
02:01:09,563 --> 02:01:13,191
- Cecil get his cut?
- Yes.

1257
02:01:14,359 --> 02:01:17,012
Looks like the Queen has the bank back.

1258
02:01:17,112 --> 02:01:21,366
- That's the way it's supposed to be.
- What you gonna do, Bumpy?

1259
02:01:22,993 --> 02:01:27,606
I got some unfinished business
to take care of. What about you?

1260
02:01:27,706 --> 02:01:30,083
I'm gonna get some sleep.

1261
02:01:31,001 --> 02:01:33,295
Thanks.

1262
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:23,328
..how sweet the sound

1263
02:02:23,428 --> 02:02:31,544
That saved a wretch

1264
02:02:31,644 --> 02:02:38,902
Like me

1265
02:02:39,861 --> 02:02:48,144
I once was lost

1266
02:02:48,244 --> 02:02:56,027
But now I'm found

1267
02:02:56,127 --> 02:03:00,156
Was blind

1268
02:03:00,256 --> 02:03:09,641
But now I see

1268
02:03:10,305 --> 02:04:10,610
