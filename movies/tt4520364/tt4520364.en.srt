00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,755
Hi, darlin'. It's me.

3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,196
I thought we'd have, um,
lunch together today.

4
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,876
Oh, angel, you look sad.

5
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,030
You know, it's a very,
very natural thing.

6
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,879
It's actually a very
human thing to feel sad.

7
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,794
But emotions aren't bad.

8
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,392
I'm sorry, baby.

9
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,438
I'm still trying to get them
to change their mind

10
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,238
and let you out for a little bit.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,716
Ah! No! Ah! Get off!

12
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,354
No! Ah! Ah!

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,634
Oh, God!

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,598
Morgan, Morgan. Calm...
Hey. Calm down, please.

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,599
Hey, Morgan.

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
It's okay.

17
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,957
Remote access brief for SynSect.

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,830
Case number 6B1138.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,231
Audio ID. Please identify.

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,511
Lee Weathers.

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Risk Management.

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,360
Access granted.

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,393
Please stand by.

24
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,120
Good day, Miss Weathers.

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,959
Sorry for the short notice,

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,919
but we really appreciate
your urgent response on this.

27
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,476
As you can see from the flash report,

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,879
details are sketchy.

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,988
We do know there was an incident
involving the L-9 prototype

30
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,036
at one of our off-site labs.

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,148
Normally, we would send
a security team,

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,037
but given the extreme sensitivity

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,429
of the L-series genetic research,

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,839
we feel it best to exert
a light touch here.

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,109
We don't want another Helsinki.

36
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,398
Keep the project staff on-site

37
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,916
and make your assessment
following the psych eval.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,275
Dr. Ben Shapiro from psych tech

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,590
will join you
to interview the subject.

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,433
SynSect has invested
significant capital

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,273
in the L-series product, and, well,

42
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,796
let's just say these folks have been
holed up for quite a while.

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,136
Shortleaf.

44
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,559
Lee Weathers. I'm expected.

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,200
The faculty are a close-knit group,

46
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,069
so it's very possible
they've drifted off

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,513
the original project brief.

48
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,388
Update me following initial contact.

49
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,516
Confirmed. Delete file.

50
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,829
Miss Weathers.

51
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,148
Ted Brenner.

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,356
I'm the Project Manager.
We spoke online.

53
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,475
Nice to meet you.

54
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,312
Let me help you with your luggage.

55
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,593
Did you find the place okay?

56
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,680
I did.

57
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,271
I don't know if you've
already been informed,

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
but we just got word

59
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,078
that Dr. Shapiro has been detained.

60
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,119
Yes, I've been informed.

61
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,758
It's unfortunate, I know.

62
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,118
He should be here
early tomorrow morning,

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,599
so, if you don't mind waiting...

64
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,511
I guess I don't really have
much of a choice.

65
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
This way, please.

66
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,108
You have your own bathroom
with a shower.

67
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,913
Hot water is ample here.

68
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,677
I'd be happy to give you a tour
of the facilities if you'd like.

69
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,039
I'd actually like to meet
with Dr. Cheng and Dr. Ziegler.

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,270
Absolutely. They're eager to meet you.

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,395
And Kathy Grieff.

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Kathy...

73
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Uh, I haven't checked in

74
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,016
- on her today, but...
- Well, as soon as you do,

75
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,176
let her know I'd like to see her.

76
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Of course.

77
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,349
And Morgan.

78
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,715
As soon as possible.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,195
I will be sure to let
Dr. Ziegler know.

80
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,228
I think you'll see the results
of our investment,

81
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,311
despite the current setbacks,

82
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,599
are quite remarkable.

83
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Thank you, Ted.

84
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
Yes.

85
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
This is Lee.

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,136
You're clear to get started.

87
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,559
This is not just about the L-9.

88
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,154
Someone has really screwed up.

89
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,358
Use today to take
a closer look at the team.

90
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Of course.

91
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,798
After Shapiro's analysis tomorrow,

92
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,916
I'll have a more complete picture.

93
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,391
I also hope to see Morgan today.

94
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,998
I may need to press the issue.

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,631
Be cautious, Miss Weathers.

96
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,308
Make sure all
safety protocols are in place.

97
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,876
But above all, preserve the asset.

98
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,830
To confirm, I'm acting
on your full authority?

99
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,037
Absolutely, Miss Weathers.

100
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Good.

101
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,918
- Hi.
- Hi.

102
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,509
I'm Amy.

103
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,799
Ah, the behaviorist.

104
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
That's right.

105
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,200
I just reviewed your paper

106
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,071
on CNT in hybridized neuro-tech,

107
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,275
and it was very impressive.

108
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,351
Oh, thank you. But, I mean...

109
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,273
That was an old paper.

110
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,153
I can't even remember what I wrote.

111
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,595
You seem to have managed
to put a lot of it into practice.

112
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,920
Oh, I'll take your word for it.

113
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,400
You know, you're nowhere
near as scary as I imagined.

114
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
I'd love to chat more,

115
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,496
but I'm just in the middle
of getting settled.

116
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,670
Oh, I'll get out of your hair.

117
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,915
Boundary issues, right?

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,319
Is that what it says in my file?

119
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,277
- Something like that.
- Yeah.

120
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,596
You probably know
more about me than I do.

121
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,240
I wouldn't say that.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Look, I get it.

123
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,035
Okay, you have a job to do,
just like everybody else here.

124
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,916
Look, if you ever
need anything from me,

125
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,958
don't hesitate to ask.

126
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,471
I appreciate that. Thank you.

127
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,958
They tell you dinner's at 8:00?

128
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,395
- Mm-hmm.
- Skip's making a lasagna.

129
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,394
Everybody loves lasagna, right?

130
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,760
Right.

131
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Oh, hey, there.

132
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
You're Skip.

133
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Right. You're, um...

134
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,989
The consultant from, uh, Corporate.

135
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,753
Well, I am the nutritionist
and general kitchen monkey,

136
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,110
so if you need anything, let me know.

137
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,270
Do you need anything? Water?

138
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,271
Uh, beer? Maybe a protein shake?

139
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,558
No. I'm good. Thank you.

140
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,714
Oh, my glorious contribution
to science.

141
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,915
Ah.

142
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
You hunt?

143
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,151
Oh, yeah. We're farm fresh
around here.

144
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
I'm not a half bad shot.

145
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,952
Ah, there you are.

146
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,554
- I see you've met Skip.
- I have.

147
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,473
Well, Dr. Ziegler is just
finishing up a spot of work.

148
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,120
But I thought we might pop
in on Kathy.

149
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,753
Nice to meet you.

150
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,834
Kathy, Brenda,

151
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,956
this is Lee Weathers from Corporate.

152
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,075
Dr. Finch.

153
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,358
Kathy, I'd love to have a chat.

154
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Oh.

155
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,438
I'm up for anything.

156
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,634
I told Bren, I told the doc.

157
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,314
Hell, I told everybody. I don't need
to be in this God damn bed.

158
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,233
But nobody seems to
want to listen to me, so...

159
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,673
She's just been medicated.

160
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,440
I'd like to speak
with her in private.

161
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,976
She needs her rest.

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,149
It won't take too long.

163
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,514
It's fine.

164
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,509
We'll be right outside.

165
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
How are you feeling?

166
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,159
I look worse than I feel.

167
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,958
I can promise you that.

168
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,754
Look,

169
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,558
this wasn't Morgan's fault.

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,672
It was my fault. Really.

171
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,199
I was, like...

172
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,515
Careless.

173
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,559
She was in a mood.

174
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,557
The company doesn't have
to worry about me. Really.

175
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,675
We are worried.

176
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,117
Any time an employee is in danger.

177
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
No, no, I don't...

178
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,198
That's not... I mean,
it was my mistake.

179
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Huh?

180
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
I...

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,355
I shouldn't have confused her.

182
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,874
Morgan's not a "she."

183
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
It's an "it."

184
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,274
Oh, you're wrong about that,
Miss Weathers.

185
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,469
She's smart.

186
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,158
She's smarter than any of us.

187
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,071
But that's not what makes
Morgan special.

188
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,072
There was joy in her heart

189
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,351
before we shoved her back in that box.

190
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,034
You haven't met her?

191
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Not yet.

192
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,714
You'll see.

193
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,870
You will. You really will.

194
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,352
Nothing here is a foregone conclusion.

195
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,593
I'm just looking for some answers.

196
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,193
Some information.

197
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,319
You're a liar.

198
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,310
There's a smile on your face, but...

199
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,591
I can tell what you are.

200
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,429
You're a God damned assassin.

201
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,748
Get better soon.

202
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,475
No, no. I'm... I'm sorry.

203
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,750
It's these lousy drugs.
I'm not myself.

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,353
She's a good girl.

205
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,075
She just got it all mixed up,
just for a moment.

206
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,028
It can happen to anyone.

207
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,395
It can.

208
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Feel better.

209
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,877
- Dr. Ziegler.
- Oh.

210
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,995
Miss Weathers.

211
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
Pleasure.

212
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,430
Yes, absolutely.

213
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,216
It's unfortunate your stay here
has been needlessly extended.

214
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,639
That's okay, doctor. We'll adjust.

215
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,040
Why don't you get me up to speed?

216
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,278
Yes. Uh, please.

217
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,076
The creation of synthetic DNA

218
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,118
was the relatively simple half
of the equation.

219
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,758
The second half is where
it gets a little more tricky.

220
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,435
Like a magician,

221
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,273
we tricked the neural network
into accepting

222
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,590
our nano into its ranks,

223
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,636
to alight in its midst.

224
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,355
Then during the incubation period,

225
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,549
the nano begins to introduce
its own language,

226
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,308
its own commands.

227
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,235
The growth rate of the organism

228
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,356
gradually accelerates as it reacts
to and reproduces the new stimuli.

229
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,550
Yes, I have read the material, doctor.

230
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,190
Yes. Of course.

231
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,549
Well, as you know,

232
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,239
uh, Morgan was our third attempt.

233
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,111
Our first full-term subject

234
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,397
developed internal
features externally.

235
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,948
It's not working. It's dropping.

236
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,156
It expired not long
after its so-called birth.

237
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,719
No.

238
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,834
And then the second...

239
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,911
Well, it exhibited more
complete physical growth,

240
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,356
but it was plagued by mental issues
in its development.

241
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,311
This only strengthened our decision

242
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,597
to start with a more
emotionally cognitive specimen.

243
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Then,

244
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,794
after two years, we finally had our...

245
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,629
Our little breakthrough.

246
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Yes!

247
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,357
Hi.

248
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,714
We knew right away
that Morgan was very special.

249
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,915
Very alert, very responsive.

250
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
You are!

251
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,388
Her intelligence grew steadily.

252
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,434
Advanced comprehension, growth rate.

253
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,656
Are you ready?

254
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,875
Within a month,
walking and talking.

255
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,108
She was exactly what we intended,

256
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,472
a hybrid biological organism...

257
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,438
...with the capacity for
autonomous decision-making

258
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,795
and sophisticated emotional responses.

259
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,914
No, Morgan. Come back!

260
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,188
I'm gonna get you.

261
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,736
I'm gonna get you!

262
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,228
- Morgan, look over here.
- Oh!

263
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,271
Look at this! Do you see? What's that?

264
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,715
I got three.

265
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,678
Isn't it amazing?
Like a nice little...

266
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,998
Hooray!

267
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,598
It's her first birth...

268
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,557
Its first birthday.

269
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,949
It exceeded our...

270
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,116
Our wildest expectations.

271
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,355
A great day.

272
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Special day.

273
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,880
I'd like to discuss
the incident, if that's okay.

274
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,515
Yes.

275
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,993
What would you like to know?

276
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,275
I'm still unclear on the cause.

277
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Yes.

278
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,376
There had been some debate...

279
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,119
...on Morgan's time outside.

280
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,838
Something she clearly loved.

281
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,434
When the excursions
with Amy were postponed,

282
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,357
she may well have overreacted.

283
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,795
I believe Amy's use
of eco-therapy

284
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,871
was wonderful for Morgan.

285
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,550
Cheng believed Morgan was introduced
to this kind of stimuli

286
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,437
at too young an age.

287
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,216
It's okay.
Hey, that's it, Morgan.

288
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,470
Hey, hey. It's okay. Hey.

289
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,216
No!

290
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,037
It's very unfortunate.

291
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,376
Put your head back.

292
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,437
But we have
the opportunity to learn from this.

293
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,239
We can condition Morgan's behavior.

294
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,630
Teach it about action and consequence.

295
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,315
No... I think that
despite these obvious setbacks,

296
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,675
this project is heading
in the right direction.

297
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,840
It's okay, it's okay.

298
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,195
No. Morgan.

299
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,154
I, uh, want you to see
how special she is.

300
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,312
We've been working hard,
modifying command cues,

301
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,868
and with the psych
evaluation tomorrow,

302
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,353
I... I prefer your time
with her now be brief.

303
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Darren.

304
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,830
Darren.

305
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,873
- Darren.
- Hey! Hey.

306
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,232
Lee Weathers, from Corporate.

307
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,389
Yeah. Right. Corporate.

308
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,993
- Hello. Welcome.
- Hello.

309
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
How's she doing?

310
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,910
Uh, you know, she's okay.

311
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,999
What's with the music?

312
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
Hmm?

313
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,431
Oh, Morgan finds it relaxing.

314
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,516
She likes
different kinds of music.

315
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,636
Jazz, classical.

316
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,915
She's been quite taken
with opera of late.

317
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,873
Uh, Lee wants to say hello.

318
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,831
Can you get Morgan
to shut the music down?

319
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,040
Hey, Morgan, buddy.

320
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,056
Can you turn
the music down for a few?

321
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,120
We've got somebody here
we'd like you to meet, okay?

322
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,671
Oh, uh,
we've configured the room.

323
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,991
Morgan's learning to control
some aspects of her environment

324
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,559
without an intermediary.

325
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
Hello, Morgan.

326
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,915
Hello, Lee.

327
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,035
You know who I am?

328
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Yes.

329
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,075
Of course.

330
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,919
You're Lee Weathers.

331
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,555
Risk Management Consultant at SynSect.

332
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,349
And why I'm here?

333
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,872
To assess my viability
as a potential product stream...

334
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,716
In light of recent events.

335
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,308
That's right.

336
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,759
How are you feeling, Morgan?

337
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,833
I'm feeling

338
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,356
not quite myself.

339
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,870
Morgan's been quite upset

340
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
about Kathy.

341
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,992
I didn't mean to hurt her.

342
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,478
Kathy is a very sweet person.

343
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,312
I would never wanna do
anything to hurt her.

344
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,869
It was an error of judgment.

345
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,109
I made a mistake.

346
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,760
But it's okay now, Morgan.

347
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,439
It's all right.

348
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,752
I did not mean to be rude.

349
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,116
How are you feeling, Lee?

350
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
I'm okay.

351
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,513
I'm all right. Thank you for asking.

352
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,436
Would you like to talk
about what happened?

353
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,176
We're actually going to save

354
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,111
the psych evaluation
for tomorrow, Morgan.

355
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,516
Are we all good here, Lee?

356
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,239
We're good.

357
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,376
Get a good night's sleep, Morgan.

358
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,435
Yes.

359
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,959
Thank you, Dr. Ziegler.

360
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,038
I should get a good night's sleep.

361
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,598
I do feel terribly about it all.

362
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,320
Everything that's happened.

363
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,913
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

364
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Yes.

365
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Tomorrow.

366
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,429
Nice to meet you, Morgan.

367
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,473
Nice to meet you, Lee.

368
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,758
You're not even gonna say it?

369
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
Say what?

370
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,709
That you're impressed?

371
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,840
Is that what you need me to say?

372
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
That I'm impressed?

373
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,120
Are we allowed to be here?

374
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
It's okay.

375
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,868
This can be our little secret.

376
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,117
See, this is a pine tree.

377
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,835
And, you know,

378
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,832
some of them can live
for thousands of years.

379
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,919
Thousands of years?

380
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,355
Yeah.

381
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,876
It's pretty cool, isn't it?

382
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,596
Morgan, I'm so proud of you.

383
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
Why?

384
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,590
Because you're learning
how to be yourself.

385
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,312
And that's the most important thing.

386
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
That was delicious.

387
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,273
Thanks.

388
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,715
What, you showing off
for the new girl?

389
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,752
So what does that mean,
exactly? "Risk Management Consultant"?

390
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,831
Pretty much how it sounds.

391
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,912
Most corporations employ
a certain amount of risk

392
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,753
and I assess that risk
against anticipated profit.

393
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,637
Of course.

394
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,711
Anticipated profit.

395
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,638
So, did you two meet on the job?

396
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,153
We did.

397
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,992
Close quarters makes for
strange bedfellows, I guess.

398
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,230
It's funny, but in a weird way, Morgan
really brought us together.

399
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,434
She's almost like a child to us.
Isn't that right, babe?

400
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,556
- Absolutely.
- Mmm.

401
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,471
You know. You met her today.

402
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,879
Saw how special she is.

403
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,517
And that's just the thing.

404
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,957
You see, it is so easy to forget
that Morgan is only five years old.

405
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,429
She is an innocent and she's learning,

406
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,988
and she has the right
to make mistakes.

407
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,672
She has no rights, whatsoever.

408
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,600
Yes. Well, we've been
living here for seven years.

409
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,069
As you can imagine,
it's difficult to avoid gender.

410
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,513
"She", "it," whatever...

411
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,433
So you assess this whole
anticipated profit thing.

412
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,875
And then what?

413
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,349
Then I make my recommendation
to Corporate.

414
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,508
You'll have to forgive
Amy's curiosity.

415
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,440
Dr. Cheng,
may I present Miss Weathers.

416
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,560
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

417
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,035
Have we not met before?

418
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
I don't think so.

419
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,200
I'm sure I would have remembered.

420
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,993
So glad you could join us.

421
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,795
Thank you.

422
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,911
So, Miss Weathers...

423
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,231
I imagine that Corporate has granted
you unreserved authority here.

424
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,632
I hope we are able to assist you

425
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,960
in coming to a fair conclusion.

426
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,589
Thank you

427
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,628
I have an enormous amount of
respect for your work, Dr. Cheng

428
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,359
And your judgment

429
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,350
Were you in Helsinki for long?

430
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,148
Not until after.

431
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,079
I was with recovery.

432
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,080
I'm sure it was
very difficult for you.

433
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,071
No account could do it justice

434
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,635
We had a team of thirty
people on that project

435
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,558
It took only an hour

436
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,312
for thirty to become nine

437
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,680
I have learned a hard lesson here.

438
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,076
For every decision we make,
there are consequences.

439
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,114
Well,

440
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,228
this is not Helsinki, Dr. Cheng.

441
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,315
Those were crude prototypes.

442
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,914
Morgan is much more advanced.

443
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,833
So much more than the company
could ever expect.

444
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,477
I hope that you are correct.

445
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,033
Why did you end Morgan 's
eco-therapy sessions with Amy?

446
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,509
There was an incident in the woods.

447
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,833
Amy took Morgan
beyond the property lines.

448
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,150
It could have compromised
the entire project.

449
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,999
That was my excuse.

450
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,149
But the truth...

451
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,595
Do you know the cruelest thing
you can do to someone

452
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,835
you've locked in a room?

453
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,957
Press their face to the window.

454
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,638
You know what you must do.

455
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,176
All right.
I want you to watch this.

456
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,315
Okay.

457
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,038
So, do that weird one he sings...

458
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,031
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa pop
Cherry on the top

459
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Okay.

460
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,839
He goes down, down, baby

461
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,000
Down by the roller coaster

462
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,634
Sweet, sweet baby
Sweet, sweet, don't let me go

463
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,597
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa pop
Shimmy, shimmy, rock

464
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,796
Ice cream, soda pop
Vanilla on the top

465
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,696
And then sock you in the stomach
three more times.

466
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,756
How did you beat me?

467
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
You're so good!

468
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Wonderful!

469
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,713
Baby, you're so good.
You picked that up so fast!

470
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,336
- Can we do it again?
- Did you guys get that?

471
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,840
Can we do it again?

472
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,398
Uh-oh. You, too, huh?

473
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,595
You working late?

474
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Mmm.

475
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
It's peaceful out here.

476
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,475
Yeah, out here.

477
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,678
Brenda and Darren are going at it

478
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,399
pretty good in the room next to mine.

479
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,873
It's a nice old house,
but the walls are thin.

480
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,632
Can I get you a drink?

481
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,631
Please.

482
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,392
So, you, uh, enjoy the corporate life?

483
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,955
It's fine.

484
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,720
Yeah? You been there long?

485
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
A while.

486
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,514
Is that what you wanted
to be when you grew up?

487
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,716
A Risk Management Consultant?

488
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,275
Oh, you're kind of
an over-sharer, huh?

489
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,439
So, did Darren and Brenda,
did they pair up early?

490
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,238
Pretty early, I guess.

491
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,395
After he got tired
of chasing after Amy.

492
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
She's interesting.

493
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,638
Interesting is a word
to describe her. Sure.

494
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
You, too?

495
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,675
Me, too? No.

496
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,309
No, not really.

497
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,674
Yeah, we fooled around a bit
when we first got up here.

498
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,478
You know, it's... It happens.

499
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
- We don't...
- I don't...

500
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,430
I don't mean to pry.
I'm just trying to figure out

501
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,033
how things work around here.

502
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
Right.

503
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,400
No, we're just two people
having a conversation.

504
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,680
There's nothing wrong with that.

505
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,030
Right, I understand.
Uh, me and Amy.

506
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,576
I guess we were
the only two to pick up

507
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,953
on the distinct summer camp vibe

508
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,075
when we first made bunk.

509
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,596
But I really don't think I'm her type.

510
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,829
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey.

511
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
How's she doing?

512
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,112
She's a little unsettled tonight.

513
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
Right.

514
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,599
What do you make of Miss Weathers?

515
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,277
Oh, you know me, Ted.
I hate just about everybody.

516
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Morgan.

517
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,675
Morgan.

518
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,640
How do you feel about Morgan?

519
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Honestly?

520
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,755
We're one big happy family
up here and all that,

521
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,910
but the thing has always
given me the creeps.

522
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,600
You're the only one
I've heard say that.

523
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,320
That may be true, but, you know,

524
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,429
I'm not a scientist,

525
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,960
and maybe I'm just a little jealous.

526
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,993
- Jealous?
- Maybe.

527
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
But why?

528
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,752
It made a perfect risotto.

529
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,870
Made it like it was nothing.

530
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,438
They say you have to cook
with your heart

531
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,736
and your soul and all that stuff,

532
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,150
but it just made
the most perfect risotto.

533
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,391
- Hmm.
- I'm sorry.

534
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,590
Oh, God.

535
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,677
That is on me. Uh...

536
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,117
If you... If you knew how long

537
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,997
I've been up here
in the middle of nowhere,

538
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,278
flipping grilled cheese for these guys

539
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,356
and cutting the crusts off
for C-3PO, it's...

540
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,555
Have a good night, Skip.

541
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
All right.

542
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,758
That was, uh... Well played, Skip.

543
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,395
Well played.

544
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,392
I wanted to talk to you

545
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,395
before tomorrow.

546
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,360
You'll do fine, Morgan.

547
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,040
You will.

548
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,198
Just be yourself.

549
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Okay?

550
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,309
Yes.

551
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,433
I suppose that's

552
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,513
the only thing I can be.

553
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,675
Tell me again.

554
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
About the lake.

555
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,679
You remembered.

556
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,469
I'm going to take you to Lake Navar.

557
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,034
It's not too far
from where we are now.

558
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,558
It is the most beautiful lake
you will ever see.

559
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,759
And if we're quiet,

560
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,432
you can hear

561
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,911
just the smallest whisper
of wind through the trees.

562
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,312
It's our own paradise, Morgan.

563
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,791
It's just like heaven.

564
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,588
How old is it?

565
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,918
I think it's about
as old as the universe.

566
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,189
It's a deer.

567
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,229
Morgan, don't scare it.

568
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,389
Is it hurt?

569
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,309
This doctor,
he a friend of yours?

570
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
No.

571
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
Why?

572
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,917
I don't think I like him too much.

573
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Good to know.

574
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,879
They say I can't be there
for the psych eval.

575
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,714
Apparently, I didn't clear
for essential personnel.

576
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,079
I've reviewed the files.

577
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,071
Seems fairly straightforward, no?

578
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,912
Well, you may find this is not your

579
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,911
garden variety evaluation.

580
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,870
Morgan is an exceptionally
complex specimen.

581
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,872
Well, it's a God damn microwave,

582
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,188
as far as I'm concerned.

583
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,120
It's not gonna change how I do my job.

584
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,877
It's a standard long form
psych eval for fourth wave A.I.

585
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,753
Well, she's not a microwave,

586
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,398
and you'd do well to remember that.

587
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,510
Uh, this is my job, doctor.

588
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,676
It's a job I happen
to be very good at.

589
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,476
If you have a problem
with my methodology

590
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,118
or a lack of faith in my abilities,

591
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,080
well, I suggest you take
that up with Corporate.

592
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,668
- Dr. Shapiro.
- Yes?

593
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,079
This is Lee Weathers.

594
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,513
Glad to see you finally arrived.

595
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Trust everything's okay?

596
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,989
Yes. I... I've apologized
for the delay.

597
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,229
I got caught up in Utah,

598
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,576
- a personal matter.
- Not a problem.

599
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,635
We're behind schedule.

600
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,240
Will you need to review
the background?

601
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,918
No, not necessary.
I can dive right in.

602
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,911
I need to be out of here
as soon as possible.

603
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,056
Okay. Let's get started then.

604
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,560
- This way, please.
- Mm-hmm.

605
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,795
You want me to sit here?

606
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,713
Is this some kind of a joke?

607
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,519
Uh, just... In light of recent events,

608
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,830
I think we'd all feel
a lot more comfortable

609
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,353
with a high safety protocol.

610
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,595
Comfortable, right.

611
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,357
Well, Ted, in my experience,

612
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,238
comfort can be a thorn
in the side of revelation.

613
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,435
Of course. Yes, but...

614
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,318
It's my job to build
trust with the subject.

615
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,598
It's just gonna be a little hard

616
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,616
with a pane of glass
between us, you know?

617
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,077
It's really just, uh,
to ensure your safety, doctor.

618
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,195
Mm-hmm.

619
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,416
What did I miss in the brief?

620
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,431
What, does this thing
shoot laser beams

621
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,776
out of its eyes
or something?

622
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,915
Well, for one,

623
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,433
there's her emergent precognition.

624
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,193
What you don't understand is the...

625
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,712
The reach of her intelligence.

626
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,037
Doctor, all due respect,

627
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,456
you need me sitting on the other side

628
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,616
of the glass from this thing,

629
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,868
then I think it's safe to say

630
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,679
that it has already failed
the psych evaluation.

631
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,189
Good.

632
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,591
Hello, Morgan.

633
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,673
Hello, Dr. Shapiro.

634
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
You know my name.

635
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
Yes.

636
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,108
And you know why I'm here?

637
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Yes.

638
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,757
Great. Then we can dive right in.

639
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,755
That sound okay?

640
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,880
Yes.

641
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,112
There's no right or wrong
answers here, Morgan.

642
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,558
This is just us having a conversation.

643
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,832
Hmm? Just me and you

644
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,353
getting to know each other.

645
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,035
Me getting to know you, especially.

646
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,309
So you just, uh...

647
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,869
Be yourself.

648
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Okay?

649
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,040
Okay.

650
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
Okay.

651
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,949
All righty.

652
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,192
Yeah. I was...

653
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,076
I was reading in the report

654
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,233
that you've been feeling a little sad.

655
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,918
You feeling a little sad, Morgan?

656
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
Yes.

657
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,034
Why are you feeling sad?

658
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,436
I'm sad about Kathy.

659
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,269
Kathy Grieff?

660
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,315
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

661
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,833
Can you tell me what you did?

662
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,553
I stabbed Kathy in the eye.

663
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,554
It was an error.

664
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,348
I shouldn't have done it.

665
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
Mmm.

666
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,354
Feeling sad is the correct response.

667
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Mm-hmm.

668
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Yeah.

669
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
And, uh...

670
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,832
What would we call,
um, an incorrect response?

671
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Laughter.

672
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,080
Yeah, sure.

673
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,310
Laughter would be
an incorrect response, yeah.

674
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,593
What makes you laugh, Morgan?

675
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,480
I don't have a very good
sense of humor.

676
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,199
That's okay.

677
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,193
People tell me the same thing, so...

678
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,515
Do you consider yourself
a person, Morgan?

679
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,869
No.

680
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,314
I am something new.

681
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,919
There is no appropriate label.

682
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,678
Do you think it's safe to say

683
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,116
- that your consciousness is superior?
- No.

684
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,193
It's just different.

685
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,519
Apples and oranges, huh?

686
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,799
It's a saying. It means that, uh...

687
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,271
You're different from human beings

688
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,840
the way that apples
are different from oranges.

689
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,669
Yes. Of course.

690
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,150
- I am apples and oranges.
- Mmm.

691
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,270
Forgive me, I occasionally
struggle with metaphor.

692
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,958
Do you like it here, Morgan?

693
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,388
Yes.

694
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,673
What do you like about it?

695
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,754
I like my music.

696
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
I like my friends.

697
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,560
Who are your friends?

698
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
Darren is my friend.

699
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,156
Brenda is my friend.
Amy is my friend...

700
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,151
Ah, they're your friends, right.

701
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,840
But do you think they treat you
like a friend?

702
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
Do you?

703
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,800
I mean, you think it's normal

704
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,151
for friends to lock
each other in cages?

705
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,276
- I was not always in a cage.
- No?

706
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,159
Before the incident, I was free
to come and go as I pleased.

707
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Well...

708
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,713
I was reading in the notes,

709
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,280
in regard to the incident with Kathy,

710
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,038
that, uh, there was, in fact,

711
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,157
uh, some disagreement
on that matter the day before.

712
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,992
Could you look at me, please, Morgan?

713
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,476
I was meant to go
to the lake with Amy.

714
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,870
Oh. Go to the lake with Amy. I see.

715
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,114
That sounds like fun.
No wonder you were upset.

716
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,349
I was not upset.

717
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,560
There was an error.

718
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,280
An error?

719
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,194
Like the error that
occurred with Kathy?

720
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
I love Kathy.

721
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,559
You experience love?

722
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,191
I have the ability
to demonstrate love.

723
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,233
Okay.

724
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,313
So you can demonstrate love

725
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,231
and sadness.

726
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,437
How do you express other emotions?

727
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,873
What other emotions?

728
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,552
Oh, I don't know. Fear?

729
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,109
Anger?

730
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,713
You're a father, aren't you?

731
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,759
You have a 13-year-old daughter.

732
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,151
You don't get to see her much anymore.

733
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,469
Yeah, uh...

734
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,720
I, uh... I am a father. Mm-hmm.

735
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,709
So, what...

736
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,256
What am I supposed
to understand here, Morgan?

737
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,280
What am I missing?

738
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,755
I'm a child.

739
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,478
You're a child.

740
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,391
Yeah. That's true. You're a child.

741
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,308
Uh, you're only five years old.

742
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,358
What emotion do you think
you were expressing

743
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,078
with Kathy, Morgan?

744
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,996
- I love Kathy.
- Mmm.

745
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,349
What about me?

746
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,474
Do you love me?

747
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,596
- No.
- No?

748
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,676
Oh, that hurts my feelings
a little bit.

749
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,256
But you know what? I get it. I get it.

750
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,508
You just met me.

751
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,636
But, you know,
you might grow to love me.

752
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,800
Yeah. If, say, I recommended

753
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,836
that you be allowed to go to the lake.

754
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,880
With Amy.

755
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,633
Would you love me then?

756
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,080
I don't know.

757
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,680
Hmm.

758
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,717
What if I made
a different recommendation?

759
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,351
What if I recommended

760
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,159
that you should not be allowed
to leave this room?

761
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,152
My feelings are irrelevant.

762
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,200
If that is the recommendation...

763
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,349
Mmm. Okay.

764
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,919
What if I made the recommendation

765
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,558
that you not be able
to leave this room

766
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,437
and you not be able
to listen to your music

767
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,317
and you not be able
to see your friends?

768
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,430
What if I recommended
that you be terminated?

769
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,520
Huh?

770
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,356
Okay. All right.

771
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,155
Forget that.

772
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,676
Okay? Forget it. Let's say...

773
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,069
Let's say I do the opposite, okay?

774
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,791
What if I recommend
that you be allowed to go to the lake

775
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,393
and then I drive you there myself?

776
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,271
Yeah. Then, it would be only natural

777
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,396
you'd have warmer feelings for me.

778
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,914
Feelings like you might have
for, uh, Amy

779
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,319
or for any of your friends here.

780
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,356
Maybe even feelings like love.

781
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,759
I suppose. I...

782
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,896
I don't know.
It's a hypothetical situation.

783
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,920
Exactly.

784
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,797
So, hypothetically, what would you do

785
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,110
if I recommended
that you be terminated?

786
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,792
What would you do, hypothetically?

787
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,836
- I don't know.
- Come on. You don't know?

788
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,816
- No.
- Off the top of your head. Come on!

789
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,592
- I don't know.
- No right or wrong answer.

790
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,320
- I don't know!
- Come on! Come on!

791
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,192
Answer me. What would you do?

792
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,589
- I don't know.
- What would you do?

793
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,355
We should end this.

794
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,240
Show me,
if you can't tell me.

795
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,312
Demonstrate it for me.

796
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,280
That's it.

797
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,160
What is that?
I don't know what that is.

798
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,153
What is that showing me?

799
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,995
Show me! Show me!

800
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,275
I don't know what this is.
What is that?

801
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,759
Show me how you feel!

802
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,679
Show me how you feel!

803
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,990
Morgan!

804
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Tranquilizers! Go!

805
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,440
Now!

806
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,672
Brenda. Get Brenda. Go!

807
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,317
Shit. Shit.

808
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,600
Morgan!

809
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,474
No. What the fuck? Shit!

810
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,194
Morgan. Buddy.

811
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,918
I need you to chill
the fuck out, okay?

812
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,591
Fuck. Fuck.

813
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,475
Morgan.

814
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,520
Morgan?

815
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,560
Morgan?

816
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,355
Morgan, look at me.

817
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,355
Morgan.

818
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,440
Baby.

819
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,919
What happened?

820
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,918
Please. Try to relax, Morgan.

821
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,994
Darren, did I hurt him?

822
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,469
No. I'm okay, buddy.

823
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,949
I'm right here, okay?

824
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,669
I didn't mean to do it.

825
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,274
Hey, I know. I know.

826
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,153
I can't move my arms.

827
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,434
You've been restrained.

828
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,589
Morgan.

829
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,430
We have decided on a plan of action.

830
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,512
One that is best for you.

831
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,279
Best... Best for me?

832
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,720
Oh, my God.

833
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,755
What are we doing?

834
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,912
We need to inform Corporate
immediately, Dr. Ziegler.

835
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,473
I've taken the liberty.

836
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,656
A containment crew
will be here at daybreak

837
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,069
to collect the specimen
and any other data for analysis.

838
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,275
No, that's not gonna work.

839
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,993
Uh, no one else can handle
this kind of material.

840
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,232
Uh, it's more effective
if we process the data here.

841
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,035
I'm sorry, doctor. There's no
other work to be done here.

842
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,394
But it's our work.

843
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,270
Our lives invested in this.

844
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,349
We've created new life

845
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,277
and you want us
to just throw that away?

846
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Enough.

847
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,553
We've failed, Simon.

848
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,856
There's no reason to labor the point.

849
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,880
Cheng...

850
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,838
Go back to the house.
You don't need to be here.

851
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,393
Right.

852
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,072
And allow you to do what?

853
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,355
To destroy years of work?

854
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,512
Go back to the house.
Pour yourself a drink.

855
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,996
If that's what you think is best.

856
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,195
Sodium thiopental.

857
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,157
Five milliliters to sedate.

858
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,713
What are you doing?

859
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,911
Then, 30 milliliters
of dihydromorphinone.

860
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,873
Have I disappointed you, mother?

861
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,910
Have I failed? I always do my best.

862
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,790
I do everything you ask, Ted.

863
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,877
Amy. Amy!

864
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,633
No. No.

865
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,276
No! I promise I'll do better.

866
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,590
- I'll do whatever you want.
- Take it easy.

867
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,555
- No, no!
- Just relax. Relax.

868
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,958
It is time to go
to sleep, Morgan.

869
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,616
- No!
- It's gonna be okay, buddy.

870
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,640
No.

871
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,631
I don't wanna die!

872
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,720
Please, mother.

873
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,920
- This will help.
- No!

874
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,800
You won't feel any more pain.

875
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,558
No! Don't!

876
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,554
I wanna live. Please, mother.

877
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,112
I'm not your mother, Morgan.

878
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,235
You have no mother.

879
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,154
I have no mother.

880
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,880
I'm sorry.

881
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,595
We have failed you.

882
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,960
Make it quick.

883
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,680
Morgan!

884
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,359
I'm gonna get you!

885
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,919
I'm gonna get you.

886
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,437
Morgan?

887
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,553
Morgan?

888
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,240
Simon.

889
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,193
I am sorry.

890
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,274
Go fuck yourself.

891
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,880
I'm not gonna do it.

892
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,880
Darren.

893
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,668
I'm sorry.

894
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,113
No, you're right.

895
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,200
Come on.

896
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,439
I can't let you do this.

897
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,429
Get out of my way, Ted.

898
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,433
I'm sorry, Lee, but no.

899
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,156
Ah.

900
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,800
Lee!

901
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,760
Lee.

902
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,400
Lee.

903
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,869
It's usually effective
for at least another hour.

904
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,477
Lee. This is just
an unfortunate situation.

905
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,557
We all feel terrible about it,
about what happened.

906
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,912
Especially Amy.

907
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,709
Where's Morgan?

908
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,320
Look...

909
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,031
You know that I'm here, just like you,

910
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,076
as a representative of the company.

911
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,389
I'm here to act
in their best interests.

912
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,914
We have an honest
difference of opinion, you and I.

913
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,313
I feel like Corporate deserves

914
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,516
an opportunity to hear
our side of things.

915
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,231
You're a professional, Lee.

916
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,799
And I respect that.

917
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,216
But it's because of
that professionalism

918
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,576
that I think you should understand

919
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,955
and appreciate
our course of action here.

920
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,398
Let me out. Now.

921
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,917
I'm sorry, Lee. I can't do that.

922
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,035
They're gonna be here.

923
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,480
Your friends over at Corporate

924
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,431
are gonna be here
sooner than you think.

925
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,754
We're all gonna have a nice
little chat about everything.

926
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,236
Of course. You get some rest now.

927
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,998
I understand how you feel
about Morgan.

928
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,433
How much you care for her.

929
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,433
Ted, it needs to be terminated.

930
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,149
She's angry.

931
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,639
Well, of course she's angry.

932
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,756
Can't worry about that now.
We're past that.

933
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,755
How close are we?

934
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,798
Brenda's bringing the minivan
around and clearing out the office.

935
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,240
- Darren?
- Yeah?

936
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,278
- How we doing in there?
- We're close. Very close.

937
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,440
Morgan.

938
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,035
What's going on?

939
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,031
Nothing.
Go back to bed, Kathy.

940
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,792
I wanna know what's going on.

941
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,792
Nothing. Just stay out of it.

942
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,040
What... What happened?

943
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,197
Nothing. Everything is fine.

944
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,556
- Morgan is gonna be fine.
- Bren?

945
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,914
- Oh, God!
- Where's Morgan?

946
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,399
Just go back to bed.

947
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,234
Where's Morgan?

948
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,920
Morgan.

949
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,760
Sweetie.

950
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,710
We have to go now, okay?

951
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,550
I need you to sit up for me.
Can you do that?

952
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,596
Morgan, come on. Come here.

953
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,680
Morgan.

954
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,789
- Darren?
- Yeah.

955
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,154
I need you to sit her up.

956
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,313
All right. Here. You do this.

957
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,800
Okay.

958
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,472
Hey, buddy. I need you
to wake up. Come on.

959
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,633
We're gonna go on a little trip here.

960
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,319
On a little adventure.

961
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,158
Come on.

962
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,390
Come here. Here, look. Look here.

963
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,755
Look here. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

964
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,515
Hey, buddy.

965
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,558
Everything's gonna be okay.

966
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,915
Morgan, no!

967
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,353
Darren!

968
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,234
Oh, my God. Morgan. Morgan, no!

969
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,360
You gotta stop.

970
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,790
You're not well, Morgan.

971
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,560
You're sick.

972
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,193
I'm feeling much better.

973
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,675
Where are you going?

974
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,795
It's over.

975
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,256
You're not leaving 'cause you're
not allowed to leave, Bren.

976
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,759
You wanna tell me what's going on?

977
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,840
We're outta here, okay?

978
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,160
Hello, Lee.

979
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,468
Open the door.

980
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,433
Doctor Shapiro was correct.

981
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,478
Those people were not my friends.

982
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,069
They wanted to kill me.

983
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,198
Except for Amy.

984
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,557
She's the only one
that truly loved me.

985
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,954
You need help, Morgan.

986
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,076
Open the door and let me help you.

987
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,639
I don't need your help.

988
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,032
I'm starting to feel like myself.

989
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,832
Do you feel like yourself, Lee?

990
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,191
Or do you feel like something else?

991
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,112
I know why they made me.

992
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,673
But what if they're wrong?

993
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,873
Why don't you come inside?

994
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,148
We can talk about everything.

995
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,391
I'd love to stay and talk, Lee.

996
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,191
I feel there's so much
we have to talk about.

997
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,554
- But I have to go now.
- Open the door.

998
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,348
One day, you'll understand.

999
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,915
Morgan!

1000
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,668
Oh, fuck.

1001
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Amy!

1002
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,496
What are you doing?

1003
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,520
Skip.

1004
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,275
Get Morgan back inside. Amy!

1005
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,680
Stop them.

1006
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,416
- Skip, don't go in there, okay?
- Don't what?

1007
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,816
- Don't you go down there, Skip.
- What are you talking about?

1008
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,016
- Brenda!
- Where's Lee?

1009
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,794
Brenda!

1010
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,714
Brenda!

1011
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,913
Fuck!

1012
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,790
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck? I nearly ran...

1013
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,711
We gotta leave.
Brenda, we gotta go.

1014
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,233
Oh, oh, Amy! What's going on?

1015
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,874
- Where is everyone else?
- It's Morgan. It's Morgan.

1016
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,616
- Where's Darren?
- Darren...

1017
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,640
Where is Darren?

1018
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,878
Okay. Morgan. Where is she?

1019
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,837
Where is Morgan, Amy?

1020
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,160
I'm right here, Brenda.

1021
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,877
Hey, Morgan. Hey. Uh...

1022
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,039
Okay.

1023
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,231
Give me the gun, Morgan.

1024
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,155
Easy, easy. Easy, Morgan.

1025
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:32,960
Okay.

1026
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,796
Where's Darren, huh?

1027
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,080
Where... Where is Darren, Morgan?

1028
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,120
Sorry, buddy.

1029
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,954
Morgan!

1030
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,637
Don't be afraid, Amy.

1031
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,355
Get in the car.

1032
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,680
I have to go say goodbye to mother.

1033
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,793
This is Dr. Lui Cheng.

1034
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,712
Technical Director
of the L-9 Morgan program.

1035
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,670
It pains me to report
an accident that occurred

1036
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,116
during the scheduled psychological
evaluation of Morgan.

1037
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,916
We had anticipated that,
by developing a model

1038
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,638
that was more self-aware,

1039
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,280
more autonomous, and more human,

1040
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,638
we could teach it to be
the best of what we are.

1041
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:20,950
Our intent was to demonstrate to you,
to the SynSect board,

1042
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,158
that a more refined and peaceful
synthetic life-form is possible.

1043
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,880
Morgan?

1044
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,240
Baby.

1045
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,509
Darren.

1046
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,830
Despite our attempts
to promote a natural,

1047
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,751
emotional intelligence,

1048
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,115
Morgan has been unable to move beyond

1049
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,668
its weaponized design parameters.

1050
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,120
Ah!

1051
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,113
Shit. Fuck.

1052
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,475
Lee!

1053
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,320
Listen to me. Listen,
You can't go in there.

1054
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,476
Morgan's gone...
She's gone postal.

1055
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,993
This is what I do, Skip.

1056
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,479
Go get your rifle.

1057
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,270
Confirmation of program collapse.

1058
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,798
Morgan is no longer viable.

1059
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,395
Mother.

1060
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,880
All right.

1061
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,275
Implementation of loss protocol

1062
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,269
in action.

1063
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,471
I have come to say goodbye

1064
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,196
You should have told me, Mother

1065
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,873
What I truly was

1066
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,071
What I would become.

1067
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,588
I'm sorry

1068
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,474
Now you know exactly who you are

1069
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,315
Amy.

1070
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,071
Hey, get out of the car.

1071
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:49,196
Amy, get out of the car.
It's not safe here.

1072
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,835
- Give me the gun.
- No!

1073
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,033
All right. Okay. Okay.

1074
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,278
All right. Okay.

1075
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,200
Oh!

1076
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,551
No, stop. Stop!

1077
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,639
Move. Now.

1078
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,680
Morgan.

1079
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,910
Morgan. Morgan!

1080
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,638
Morgan, no! Don't!

1081
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,998
Ah!

1082
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,080
Stop!

1083
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:50,840
Oh, fuck!

1084
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,398
Morgan! Stop!

1085
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,153
No, Morgan.

1086
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,951
Jesus Christ, you all right?

1087
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,509
I'm taking your car.

1088
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,600
What?

1089
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,399
No, no, no, you're hurt.
Let it go. Let it go.

1090
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,317
No. That's not how it works.

1091
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,709
Get in. I know where they're going.

1092
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,353
I'm not gonna hurt you, Amy.

1093
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,674
You'll see.

1094
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,829
Pull over here. Not too close.

1095
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,920
Get back in the car.

1096
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,136
No, God damn it.
I'm coming to help you.

1097
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,435
Let me do my job.

1098
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,159
You'll see now.

1099
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,878
How happy we can be.

1100
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,032
Is this what heaven's like?

1101
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,589
I don't know.

1102
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,633
It must be.

1103
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,679
I feel...

1104
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:22,960
Alive.

1105
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:26,880
What was that?

1106
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,360
Morgan?

1107
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,996
Please, don't...

1108
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,354
Morgan?

1109
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,148
Oh, shit.

1110
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,188
Ah!

1111
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,280
Oh!

1112
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,034
What happened?

1113
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,279
Was it Lee?

1114
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,073
We go. Now.

1115
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,593
No! Morgan.

1116
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,516
You have to stop.

1117
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,832
Okay? Stop.

1118
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,755
What happened?

1119
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,155
It's over.

1120
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,549
Morgan's dead?

1121
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,148
It's dead.

1122
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,320
Where's Amy?

1123
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,674
We need to leave.

1124
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,400
Whoa.

1125
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,873
What happened to Amy?

1126
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:52,674
I'm sorry, Skip.

1127
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:55,714
Just wait a second. Lee...

1128
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,313
She did very well.

1129
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,950
Agreed, the situation is untidy,

1130
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,634
but given the unpredictable
nature of the assignment,

1131
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,434
she prosecuted her mandate perfectly.

1132
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,997
She was measured and surgical,

1133
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,755
even when the situation
was considerably less so.

1134
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,193
Most importantly,

1135
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,350
she followed her directives
without hesitation.

1136
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,031
The collateral damage
was regrettable, of course.

1137
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,393
But in this case,

1138
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,199
unavoidable.

1139
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,800
I think these events
make it punishingly clear

1140
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,831
what I had already predicted.

1141
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,840
The L-9

1142
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,357
was the inferior program.

1143
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,076
Though its emotional development

1144
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,434
was certainly remarkable,

1145
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,508
the immediate termination

1146
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,797
was an unfortunate
but clear necessity.

1147
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:28,158
Well, I guess the old dogs
hunt the best, sir.

1148
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:29,875
Then it's settled.

1149
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,039
We stick to what we know.

1150
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:36,679
All development assets
revert to the L-4 stream.

1151
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,069
So what do we do
about Lee Weathers?

1152
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,320
What about her?

1153
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,074
She's perfect.

1154
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,399
That's the song that
I knew when I was young

1155
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,311
About the tall trees
In Georgia

1156
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,557
If you love all men

1157
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,676
Then you'll be left
With none

1158
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:37,473
Don't you see
That's what you've done?

1159
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:44,468
Now the world
How it burns as it turns

1160
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:50,233
You've been taught
Oh, but you've never learned

1161
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:56,635
Just forget yourself
And forget it hurts

1162
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:01,315
Cut it off
If it gets too fierce

1163
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:10,798
What it'd be like
In the willows with you

1164
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,318
We 'd be free
Like we used to

1165
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:20,156
What does that even mean?

1166
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,275
It means we 'd want nothing

1167
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,070
But to be a good choice
To choose

1168
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:32,757
You're a good choice
To choose

1169
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:45,079
When the applause dies
And our hands are untied

1170
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,798
Will you believe me
That I love you?

1171
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:55,069
What a fool I've been

1172
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,909
To beg you again and again

1173
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,432
To believe me
That I want you

1174
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,630
And now we both can't sleep

1175
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,436
I see you in my dreams

1176
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,670
There you are on
The lonely screen

1177
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:20,750
What it'd be like
In the willows with you

1178
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,150
We 'd be free
Like we used to

1179
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,351
What does that even mean?

1180
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,595
It means we 'd want nothing

1181
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,835
But to be a good choice
To choose

1182
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:43,596
What it'd be like
In the willows with you

1183
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,111
We 'd be free
Like we used to

1184
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,676
What does that even mean?

1185
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,954
It means we 'd want nothing

1186
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,597
But to be a good choice
To choose

1187
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,471
You're a good choice
To choose

1188
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:28,795
You're so very cruel
You're so you're so

1189
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:34,589
You're so very cruel
You're so you're so

1190
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:40,390
You're so very cruel
You're so you're so

1191
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:46,154
You're so very cruel
You're so you're so

1192
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:51,830
You're so very cruel
You're so, you're so

1193
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,710
You're so very cruel
You're so, you're so

1194
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:03,550
You're so very cruel
You're so, you're so

1195
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,670
You're so very cruel

1195
01:29:07,305 --> 01:30:07,178
