<i>Welcome. Welcome to Ireland.</i>

00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:32,748
<i>My name's Tony Reilly.</i>

5
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:34,016
<i>I'm dead.</i>

6
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:39,955
<i>They say, if an Irishman dies
while he's telling a story,</i>

7
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,726
<i>you can rest assured,
he'll be back.</i>

8
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:49,765
<i>Once upon a time in Ireland,</i>

9
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,735
<i>there were two farms.</i>

10
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:59,875
<i>The Muldoon farm where Rosemary
lives with her mother, Aoife,</i>

11
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:02,811
<i>and her father, Chris,</i>

12
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:05,881
<i>who was at war with the crows.</i>

13
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:09,319
<i>And right down the road,</i>

14
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:14,224
<i>on the sweetest rise of land
you ever saw, was my farm,</i>

15
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:19,028
<i>where my wife Mary sang
until she conquered the house.</i>

[Tony] <i>And where, upstairs,</i>

19
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:37,214
<i>my son Anthony asked his
lonely question of the stars.</i>

20
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:38,814
Mother Nature,

21
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:40,983
why did you make me so?

22
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:46,055
<i>The real answer was just
down the road maybe.</i>

23

- Fiona!
- Look at your nose.

28
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:23,025
You look like a clown.

29
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:33,836
[woman] What's this?

30
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:36,539
- [gunshot]
- [crows cawing]

31

Chrissy, Chrissy.

32
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:41,176
We have a problem.

33
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,581
- <i>Anthony pushed Rosemary down.</i>
- [Fiona] Hmph!

34
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:49,184
- Why?
- Because Rosemary went after Fiona.

35
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:55,492
Rosemary? What's the matter?

36
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:57,560
I have no purpose.

37
00:04:57,594 --> 00:05:01,431
I'm just a girl.
The world is full of girls.

38
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:04,367
You are not just a girl.

39
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,803
You are a queen.

40
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:10,139
What kind of queen?

41
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,876
It was my mother's.
[blows]

42
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:17,913
It's full of swans.

43

[Tchaikovsky's
<i>Swan Lake</i> playing]

44

for better or for worse,

46
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:31,293
you are the white swan.

47
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:37,232
What does it mean
to be the white swan?

48
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:43,305
Well, it means
no one can stop you.

49
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,975
The world is yours.

50
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:52,081
You can do anything.

[Tony]
<i>Look at that weather coming.</i>

59
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:06,955
<i>It reminds me of the night
we buried Chris Muldoon.</i>

60
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,960
<i>Muldoon didn't leave
the Reillys much.</i>

<i>Two gates to open

[thunderclap]

63
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,269
[Tony] You should've
left the gates open.

64
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:22,639
[Anthony] They're Muldoon gates
and the Muldoons like them shut.

65
00:07:22,672 --> 00:07:25,442
I can't believe you took a widow's ham.
Have you no shame?

66
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:27,677
- [Tony] She offered!
- [Anthony] You asked!

67
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,077
[Tony] Hurry up!

68
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:32,047
Hurry, is it?
Why don't you get the gate?

69
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,149
It's barely raining.

- [dog barking, whimpering]
- [Anthony] Get down, Flossie!

73
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:04,547
[Tony] Look at you.
You can't even love a dog.

74
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:07,484
Would you look
at this kitchen?

75
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:09,619
Your mother would die again

76
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:11,721
if she saw the state
of this house.

77
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:13,656
They'll think us tramps.

78
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,658
- How's my face?
- A fright.

79
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,529
- Where's my pipe?
- Upstairs and you're not getting it.

80
00:08:20,395 --> 00:08:22,599
Look at me.
I look like a badger.

81
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:24,466
I'm freezing.

82
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:27,369
- Why'd you let the stove go out?
- Would you burn down the house?

83
00:08:27,402 --> 00:08:30,372
You had to invite
the Muldoons over?

84
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:32,241
The funeral wasn't
enough for you?

85
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:33,576
Are you that selfish, Daddy?

86
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,712
- [clattering]
- [stove ignites]

87
00:08:35,745 --> 00:08:38,615
- Jesus.
- [Anthony coughs]

88
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,115
Would you see the smoke.

89
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:42,619
I can't believe
Chris Muldoon is dead.

90
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:44,353
Who's going to kill the crows?

91
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:47,189
It's true, Chris Muldoon
did like to shoot the crows.

92
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:50,259
- He tore holes in the sky with that gun.
- [vehicle approaching]

93
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,795
- [both laughing]
- [Rosemary] Mam, wait.

94
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:54,564
Stop.

95
00:08:56,331 --> 00:08:57,634
What's funny?

96
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,167
You all right, Aoife?

97
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:02,437
All right, is it?
I'm in pieces.

98
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:04,807
Get the door
afore the night comes in.

99
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:08,377
Aoife, come. Sit by the heat.

100
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,614
Can't sit all the way down.
My legs lock.

101
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:16,418
- Were you having a laugh?
- We were.

102
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:18,287
- We were not.
- [Aoife] What about?

103
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,790
- Will you take a stout?
- In the bottle or the can?

104
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:22,825
- The bottle.
- [Aoife] No thanks.

105
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:24,293
The bottle tastes of glass.

106
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:26,428
Does glass have a taste then?

107
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:28,230
It does.
Glass tastes like teeth.

108
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:32,134
Oh, the taste of glass.
Sure, I know it.

109
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,571
- You know the taste of glass?
- I do.

110
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:36,204
You do not.

111
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:38,507
So no to the stout.
Well, I'm making some tea.

112
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,577
- You'll have one.
- What's that smoke?

113
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,344
The chimney's crusted shut.

114
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:43,813
- [Aoife] Mine is worse.
- [coughing]

115
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:46,181
I'm working
for every breath.

116
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:48,585
Look at her.
She'll be dead in a year.

117
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:51,486
[Aoife] I don't mind.
Except to desert Rosemary

118
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,323
- and leave her orphaned altogether.
- You look fine.

119
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:59,161
Oh, sure, the fruit still looks
good when the worm starts its work.

120
00:09:59,194 --> 00:10:01,330
And what about you?
When are you packing up?

121
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:02,799
I'll be dead by Christmas.

122
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:04,901
Just don't.

123
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:06,836
- Where's Rosemary?
- [Aoife] Outside.

124
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:09,171
- [thunderclap]
- In the rain?

125
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:13,275
She won't smoke in front of me and she's
always smokin', so I never see her.

126
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,477
That's her. Stubborn.

127
00:10:16,813 --> 00:10:18,380
[thunderclap]

128
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,517
[cow mooing]

129
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:25,153
She's out there, all right.

130
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:27,589
- She is. Smokin'.
- [Anthony] She'll catch pneumonia.

131
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:30,727
Nah, she's crazy.
The cracked ones never get sick.

132
00:10:31,426 --> 00:10:33,428
Crazy? Never noticed that.

133
00:10:33,462 --> 00:10:35,898
That's because you never notice
anything, Anthony.

134
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:38,835
You're famous across Ireland
for what goes by you.

135
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:41,303
Famous. As if.

136
00:10:41,336 --> 00:10:45,675
Tony, have you signed
the farm over to Anthony?

137
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:53,582
What? Just like that
you ask him?

138
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:55,685
I'm thinking tonight
about arrangements.

139
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:58,755
- Right.
- [Aoife] Or, are you going to leave it to him?

140
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:00,389
Who else would he leave it to?

141
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:01,958
The others have all fled.

142
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:04,259
I haven't made up me mind.

143
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,698
- You haven't what?
- I would've thought Chris Muldoon would have

144
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:10,565
you know, made out a plan.

145
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:12,969
He did. What was his
to leave, he left to me.

146
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:17,305
- As he should have done.
- It's only arrangements for Rosemary I'm thinking of now.

147
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,409
What do you mean you don't know
if the farm comes to me?

148
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:21,844
I don't see a clear path.

149
00:11:21,878 --> 00:11:23,278
From where to where?

150
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:25,280
- From me to you.
- Stop.

151
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:26,749
[Tony] It has to be said.

152
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,852
Your face is not right.

153
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:33,488
You come up
from some other people.

154
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:35,557
You're more Kelly than Reilly.

155
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,827
[Aoife] It's true,
you're a Kelly in the face.

156
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,429
- In my face?
- He likes to fish.

157
00:11:40,462 --> 00:11:42,865
That's the Kellys.
It's well known.

158
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,802
John Kelly
thought he was a fish.

159
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:49,005
- My name is Reilly. I'm a Reilly.
- [Tony] No, you're a Kelly!

160
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:53,876
You take after John Kelly and
that man was mad as the full moon.

161
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,377
Drowned himself!

162
00:11:55,878 --> 00:11:57,747
- In the Royal Canal.
- He fell in.

163
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,349
- He had a rock tied to his neck.
- I'm not a Kelly!

164
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:03,853
You're not a farmer,
that's what you're not.

165
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:05,320
Now, Tony.

166
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:07,023
[Tony]
You don't stand on the land

167
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:08,725
and draw strength from it.

168
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:12,227
As I did. Till Mammy died.

169
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:15,898
You'd rather read
your goddamn magazines.

170
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:18,266
[Aoife] Easy now.

171
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:22,437
Don't criticize me, Daddy.

172
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:25,440
Some of us don't have joy,
but we do what we must.

173
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:28,577
Is a man who does what he must
but feels no pleasure

174
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,813
less of a man
than one who's happy?

175
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:34,616
That's it.

176
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:36,953
If only for want
of better company,

177
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:38,687
I'm getting Rosemary.

178
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:41,656
Anthony, Anthony.

179
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:07,749
Rosemary.

180
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,052
Anthony.

181
00:13:10,086 --> 00:13:12,554
What are you doing out here
away from the house?

182
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:14,991
Smoking.

183
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:16,625
In the rain?

184
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:20,395
There's a bit of roof.

185
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:23,298
It's dark as tar.

186
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:26,869
I can see.

187
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,374
You're smoking a pipe now?

188
00:13:32,842 --> 00:13:34,709
[bull bellowing]

189
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:36,711
It's Da's.

190
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:43,685
That bull of yours
is coughing like pertussis.

191
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:46,488
I dosed him for worms.
He's coughing them up.

192
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:48,090
Doesn't sound good.

193
00:13:48,124 --> 00:13:49,658
Don't say it.

194
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:52,794
[bull wheezing]

195
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:54,629
[bull bellows]

196
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:03,705
How long
since you dosed him?

197
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:06,108
Three weeks.
His lungs should've cleared.

198
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:08,110
I don't know.
Should I call the vet?

199
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,712
The morning's soon enough
to spend money.

200
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:14,349
Go in, you'll catch your death.
No.

201
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:16,886
Have you heard from Fiona?

202
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,521
Never.

203
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:21,023
Not since our childhood days.

204
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,993
- Do you know where she is?
- She's in Wicklow.

205
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:25,794
With a husband
and three daughters.

206
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:28,730
- [bull grunts]
- He thinks we're talking about him.

207
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:32,001
Well, men always think
the subject's number one.

208
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:35,037
- [whimpering]
- [thunder rumbling]

209
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:38,875
[Aoife] Are you seriously
begrudging Anthony the farm?

210
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:42,912
I gave him his mother's ring
three years since.

211
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:46,615
He's done nothing with it.
He's a bachelor to the bone.

212
00:14:46,648 --> 00:14:51,486
- You're going the wrong way.
- This is my family's farm 121 years.

213
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,521
It won't stop with Anthony.

214
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:56,791
Things end
when God says they do.

215
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:01,130
Aoife. Aoife.

216
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:02,965
I can't believe
my Chrissy's gone.

217
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:05,634
Aoife. Oh.

218
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:06,768
Oh, Aoife.

219
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:08,837
Half my house is gone.

220
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:10,940
Aoife.

221
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:14,442
[Flossie barks, whimpers]

222
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:16,045
What's Flossie about?

223
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:18,080
She's after the ham.

224
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:19,547
She can't get it.

225
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:21,583
It's in the fridge.

226
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:24,053
Would you have a piece?

227
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:25,487
If you want ham,
have it!

228
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,756
Don't be offering me
me own ham!

229
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,763
Listen, I'm so sorry
about your da.

230
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:36,999
Thank you, Anthony.

231
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:44,006
Jesus. When my mother died,

232
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,042
I couldn't see colors anymore.

233
00:15:47,575 --> 00:15:49,744
Where do we go when we die?

234
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:51,047
The sky?

235
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,148
The ground.

236
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:53,648
Then what's the sky for?

237
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:56,718
It's for now.
The sky is for now.

238
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:07,163
You know, it was me
that found him.

239
00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:12,034
Mam came up. Her face was white as
snow, so I gave her water.

240
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:15,503
But didn't the glass
have his teeth in it.

241
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:18,074
- No!
- She was wild.

242
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:19,874
She won't drink
from a glass since.

243
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:21,576
I can testify to that.

244
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:23,878
- Says it tastes like teeth.
- Tastes like teeth.

245
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:36,491
Well, I'll get her. She won't sit
anywhere but her own chair, so...

246
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:38,094
we should go.

247
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:39,161
Right.

248
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:41,163
And you'd let me go,
wouldn't ya?

249
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:44,166
- Well, you said you were going.
- Don't you know better

250
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,867
than to listen to people?
Who is that?

251
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,569
It's Bad News Cleary.

252
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:48,870
Why do you call him that?

253
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:50,605
Because he only
brings bad news.

254
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:53,608
Hello, Rosemary.
Sorry for your trouble.

255
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:56,811
Listen, that horse of yours
has jumped the fence again.

256
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:58,147
Don't say it.

257
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,216
Yeah. I thought
you'd want to know.

258
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:02,084
Yeah,
thank you, Cleary.

259
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:04,586
You should go inside to see her mother.
She's in there.

260
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,222
I will not! Good night.

261
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:10,159
You see? Bad News Cleary.
Do you have a halter?

262
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:12,061
- I do.
- You'd best give it here.

263
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:13,561
What about your mother?

264
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:15,164
Would you take her home?

265
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:16,865
I don't mind.
Thank you.

266
00:17:16,898 --> 00:17:19,035
[Tony] <i>You're sure
you don't want some ham?</i>

267
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:20,169
Cut a piece for the dog.

268
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:22,071
No, it's too good for her.

269
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:23,705
It's too good
for either of you.

270
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:32,013
Should we speak of it?

271
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:33,648
What?

272
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:37,819
There was no point
while Chris was alive.

273
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:40,021
Are you proposing?

274
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:42,757
What? Jesus, no.

275
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:47,796
Then get off your duff and say
what you mean, you gobshite fraud.

276
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,667
That piece of land that
blocks me from the road,

277
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,835
sell it back to me.

278
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:55,637
You only have to open the gates.

279
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,640
Have you gotten
out of my car in the rain

280
00:17:58,673 --> 00:18:01,243
and drowned yourself
working those damn gates?

281
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:03,079
It rains on us all.

282
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:04,679
I'll give you a fair price.

283
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:07,216
Did your broach this with Chrissy?
I did.

284
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:08,983
No reply.

285
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:11,653
No reply is a reply.

286
00:18:11,686 --> 00:18:14,622
I need to pass the farm down
as it was given me.

287
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:16,092
So you're
passing it down now?

288
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,627
I was always passing it down.
To Anthony.

289
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:21,696
Rosemary asked me
to take you home.

290
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:23,832
Where is she?
Her horse got loose again.

291
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:26,968
That horse is Satan
on four feet!

292
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:29,105
Think on what I said.

293
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:30,705
I won't.
Why not?

294
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:33,775
You don't need me
concerning those gates.

295
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:35,977
- You need Rosemary.
- Why's that?

296
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,912
The frontage Chrissy
bought from you,

297
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:39,381
I do not own.

298
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:41,983
All the rest is mine,
but not that.

299
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:43,385
He sold it?

300
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:46,054
He gave it to Rosemary.

301
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:47,189
Rosemary?

302
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:49,023
What are you saying?

303
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:51,793
Chris Muldoon signed
that strip of dirt

304
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:54,130
between the gates
over to Rosemary

305
00:18:54,163 --> 00:18:57,433
when she was not more
than ten years of age.

306
00:18:57,466 --> 00:19:00,336
He gave a ten-year-old girl
my right of way?

307
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:02,737
She'd have it
and I can tell you why.

308
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,407
It was the spot where
Anthony pushed her down.

309
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:08,109
Me?
You pushed a little girl?

310
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:09,378
I did not. When?

311
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:11,413
When she was ten!
You did it!

312
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:14,015
And you're banished
from that spot.

313
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:18,786
Now take me home before
me pacemaker runs down to zero.

314
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:24,759
Bye, bye, bye,
bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

315
00:19:27,363 --> 00:19:28,930
Bye.

316
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:55,457
[Rosemary]
Good boy, Blister.

317
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:57,959
Oh, such a good boy.

318
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,163
You're so beautiful.
You stay right there.

319
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:04,866
All right.

320
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,269
All right.

321
00:20:07,303 --> 00:20:08,870
It's okay, my love.

322
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:11,739
- [snorts, whinnies]
- May you burn in hell,

323
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:13,942
you shite horse!

324
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:24,220
There's a good boy.

325
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:38,866
Okay. Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

326
00:20:44,872 --> 00:20:46,308
[clicking tongue]

327
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,926
[shouting, faint]

328
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,004
Anthony!

329
00:21:16,572 --> 00:21:17,939
[exclaims]

330
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,175
[geese honking]

331
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:26,981
Are you all right?

332
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:30,018
I'm fine.
What were you doing out there?

333
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:32,421
Fishing.
That was fishing?

334
00:21:32,454 --> 00:21:35,089
Yeah.
Without a rod?

335
00:21:36,057 --> 00:21:37,559
Who were you talking to?
I wasn't talking.

336
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:40,094
You looked to be talking,
then swatting, then you jumped in.

337
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:42,897
I did not. It's the Kellys
that jump in. I'm a Reilly.

338
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,033
- You're a Reilly.
- What are you doing down by the river?

339
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:46,968
What I've been doing.
After this one.

340
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:49,871
- You're not still from the night before?
- I am.

341
00:21:49,904 --> 00:21:51,839
Well, God in heaven!
You look the worse for it.

342
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:54,343
Well, thanks much.
You don't look perfect yourself.

343
00:21:57,346 --> 00:22:00,316
You have some fine-looking
cattle this year, Anthony.

344
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:03,918
Not too bad. Why does your
horse keep jumping the fence?

345
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:05,253
He's restless.

346
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:07,323
I know that one.
Do ya?

347
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:10,058
I hear a voice sometimes
when I'm out here,

348
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:12,060
and the voice says, "Go."

349
00:22:12,093 --> 00:22:12,994
Go?

350
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:14,596
Do you not love the farm?

351
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,198
Love? Sure hate it
for a prison.

352
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:20,835
Came up out of it like a tree
and here I am with it around me.

353
00:22:21,637 --> 00:22:24,205
Why don't you leave
and follow the voice?

354
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:26,442
- No.
- Why no?

355
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:33,848
There's
these green fields...

356
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:37,885
and the animals
living off them.

357
00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:41,289
And over that there's us...

358
00:22:42,323 --> 00:22:43,257
living off the animals.

359
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:48,397
And over that there's
that which tends to us...

360
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:51,299
and lives off us maybe.

361
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:54,902
Whatever that is...

362
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,039
it holds me here.

363
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:02,243
You should go.

364
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,114
Once you're on your own
you should sell the farm,

365
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:08,182
leave Ireland entirely.

366
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,084
Why?

367
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:12,454
It's a terrible place
for a decent person.

368
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:14,456
Are you not decent?

369
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,057
Me? [scoffs]

370
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,092
I'm mad.

371
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:24,132
You could walk us home.
I can't be leaving the boat.

372
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:25,967
I'll see you at church.

373
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,003
You were talking out there.
See you at church.

374
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:34,976
"There's the green fields,

375
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:37,145
and the animals
living off them..."

376
00:23:39,013 --> 00:23:42,216
[sighs] When he says
those things, Blister,

377
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,187
I know I must have him,
God help me.

378
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:51,926
[chattering]

379
00:23:59,668 --> 00:24:02,069
[bee buzzing]

380
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:47,783
- What's that?
- Stew.

381
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:50,619
- You were a while.
- Stopped at church.

382
00:24:50,652 --> 00:24:52,053
Have you taken it up?

383
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:55,356
It's no business of yours.

384
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:57,493
Want stew?
I would.

385
00:25:16,545 --> 00:25:17,779
Are you
not going to open it?

386
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:20,381
- What?
- The letter from America.

387
00:25:20,414 --> 00:25:24,520
- I'll get to it.
- You'll get to it?

388
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:27,523
How often do you get a letter from
your nephew and you'll get to it?

389
00:25:27,556 --> 00:25:29,490
Me glasses are upstairs.

390
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:30,826
I'll get them.

391
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:33,294
I'll read it when I'm alone.

392
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,197
What's in it?

393
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,066
How would I know?
I haven't read it.

394
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,170
What's in it?

395
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:46,107
[indistinct shouting]

396
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:49,510
You can't!

397
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:53,180
Fine! Then get a wife!

398
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:01,055
Rosemary...

399
00:26:02,123 --> 00:26:04,358
it seems like
maybe we should...

400
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,331
we should ma...

401
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:14,335
we should marry.

402
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:16,605
[exhales]

403
00:26:17,673 --> 00:26:19,273
Rosemary...

404
00:26:20,842 --> 00:26:22,578
we're known to each other

405
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,246
quite a while now.

406
00:26:27,348 --> 00:26:29,383
No doubt you could do better,
but...

407
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,354
Well, you don't seem
to be doing much, so...

408
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,090
will you have me?

409
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:41,162
Damn it, is that
not enough for you?

410
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:47,501
All right, seems like you won't
be satisfied until I'm on my knee.

411
00:26:47,535 --> 00:26:49,605
[braying softly]

412
00:26:51,505 --> 00:26:52,774
Would you marry me?

413
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:54,375
[Cleary laughing]

414
00:26:54,408 --> 00:26:57,211
So it's true.
You have the Kelly madness.

415
00:26:57,244 --> 00:26:59,513
- Cleary!
- I thought Tony was having me on.

416
00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:03,217
- What are you lurking?
- Your da's selling the farm from under ya.

417
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,853
I thought you'd want to know.

418
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:07,588
So you've taken up
with a donkey?

419
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:15,529
Watch out!

420
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:17,198
[Cleary laughs]

421
00:27:17,231 --> 00:27:20,134
I didn't know Cleary
could run like that.

422
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:22,570
[Anthony] Tony, you bastard!

423
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:27,208
- [Rosemary] What?
- [Anthony] He's selling the farm to Adam.

424
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:29,176
Well, then go and face
the old fool down!

425
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,245
- I don't like a fight.
- Well, who does?

426
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:33,381
- Half of Ireland, just not me.
- I'll go.

427
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:35,684
- You will not! Rosemary!
- What?

428
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,220
Nothing. Nothing.

429
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:41,255
Leave it!

430
00:27:42,523 --> 00:27:45,359
What's he on about?
I hope you have no part in this, Mother.

431
00:27:48,496 --> 00:27:51,733
Tony means to sell the farm
to his brother's son.

432
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:54,301
Adam? In America?
Yeah.

433
00:27:54,335 --> 00:27:56,637
That's why he wants
the land back.

434
00:27:57,471 --> 00:27:59,675
The Yank doesn't want to be
bothering with gates.

435
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,342
Oh, he'll be...

436
00:28:01,943 --> 00:28:03,812
He'll be bothering.

437
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:05,947
There's much
of your father in you.

438
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:08,315
Proud to know it.

439
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:12,319
Two bulldogs.
No, I'm a swan.

440
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:16,725
Why would you think
of denying Anthony?

441
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,393
- Leave it.
- Well, if you want to talk to me

442
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:21,963
about these gates,
you'll talk to me about Anthony.

443
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:24,298
What there is to say,
I won't say.

444
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:26,802
You've kept him down
with the promise of this farm.

445
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:28,302
Not a word of truth.

446
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:30,438
Don't cross me, Tony Reilly.

447
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:32,708
- Are you in love with Anthony?
- It's more than love.

448
00:28:32,741 --> 00:28:35,844
Don't be. Now go while
your damn gates are open.

449
00:28:35,877 --> 00:28:38,345
I'm not done with you!

450
00:28:39,313 --> 00:28:41,382
- He's not normal!
- I don't care!

451
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:43,451
He'll never marry.
Well, then neither will I,

452
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:45,887
and he will be in his house
and I'll be in mine.

453
00:28:45,921 --> 00:28:47,321
[Aoife]
Rosemary!

454
00:28:47,354 --> 00:28:49,991
Be quick! I need to pee!

455
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:51,860
And you'd sell to a Yank,
would ya?

456
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:53,661
He's a Reilly!
He's a Yank!

457
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:54,863
You're trespassing now!

458
00:28:54,896 --> 00:28:56,998
Drop this plot
or I'll kill ya!

459
00:28:57,032 --> 00:28:59,300
Would you have the place
go in auction?

460
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,737
Anthony will never marry.
Oh, he will.

461
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,005
Wake up!
Look to yourself.

462
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:07,241
If it comes to that,
I'll freeze my eggs!

463
00:29:08,342 --> 00:29:10,979
- You'll what?
- I'll freeze my eggs.

464
00:29:11,012 --> 00:29:12,613
If he's slow, I'll wait.

465
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:14,482
You should freeze
your whole body

466
00:29:14,515 --> 00:29:15,951
if you're waiting
for that one!

467
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:17,618
I believe he will come to me.

468
00:29:17,651 --> 00:29:18,954
I need this settled.

469
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:21,589
I'm turning 75.
Listen.

470
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,926
The farm goes to Anthony.
Just say it.

471
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,527
I can't.

472
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,829
Rose!

473
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,365
Take notice.
We're not done, sir.

474
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:33,634
We're not done!

475
00:29:35,402 --> 00:29:37,304
How will we be done?

476
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:40,407
I need these gates down.

637
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:57,090
Would you look at this.

638
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:05,700
What do you think?

639
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:07,468
Would you see this.

640
00:40:07,502 --> 00:40:08,935
Is it an automatic?

641
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:12,005
Anthony,
that is a Rolls-Royce.

642
00:40:12,038 --> 00:40:13,441
A Rolls-Royce.

643
00:40:14,241 --> 00:40:16,977
Can you believe the sound
of the words, Da? A Rolls-Royce.

644
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:20,213
It's the finest car
I've ever seen.

645
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:25,620
And that's how Anthony Reilly
fell in love with a donkey.

646
00:40:25,653 --> 00:40:28,054
[all laughing]

647
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:33,661
[Adam] Anthony.

648
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:35,362
Got you
a little something.

649
00:40:35,395 --> 00:40:38,965
What do you mean?
It's Tony's birthday, not mine.

650
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:40,934
What is it?
Open it.

651
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:49,577
- Huh?
- I am looking at it and I still don't know what it is.

652
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,077
Come on.

653
00:40:52,279 --> 00:40:55,248
- It's a raincoat!
- It's white.

654
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,485
It's a white raincoat.

655
00:41:07,762 --> 00:41:09,162
[Adam] Hi.

656
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:11,499
How are you?

657
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:15,101
I'm Tony's nephew, Adam.
Yeah, I know who are.

658
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:17,572
Rosemary Muldoon.
Yeah, I know who you are, too.

659
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:20,608
- You're on the next farm.
- I am.

660
00:41:21,642 --> 00:41:24,077
And you own that little piece
of land between those gates.

661
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,515
- I do.
- And you're going to sell it to me.

662
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:30,250
To who? You?
That's right.

663
00:41:30,283 --> 00:41:32,487
You're a little
confrontational.

664
00:41:33,554 --> 00:41:35,523
- Do you think so?
- I do.

665
00:41:37,257 --> 00:41:38,559
Too much so?

666
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:42,229
I don't know.

667
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:49,002
Look in my eyes
and ask me again.

668
00:41:52,773 --> 00:41:54,474
Are you going
to sell me that land?

669
00:41:56,544 --> 00:41:57,712
That was strong.

670
00:41:57,745 --> 00:41:59,179
Hmm.

671
00:42:00,146 --> 00:42:02,550
I don't know.
I might sell it, I might not.

672
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,417
I'm all aflutter.

673
00:42:07,522 --> 00:42:09,356
[yelps]

674
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:12,593
[Adam] Jesus.
What's he doing?

675
00:42:12,627 --> 00:42:15,596
He got himself a metal detector.

676
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:18,833
Huh. Did he lose something?

677
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:20,500
No, he's just shy.

678
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:23,436
[Adam]
I guess that's one word for it.

679
00:42:24,437 --> 00:42:27,173
I'm sorry to hear
your mom's not feeling well.

680
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,577
It's nice you came
for the birthday.

681
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,413
Yeah. I wish I could stay
a little longer.

682
00:42:34,849 --> 00:42:38,285
I have to get back.
That's too bad.

683
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:40,220
You should come to New York.

684
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:42,489
What would I do
in New York?

685
00:42:42,522 --> 00:42:44,291
I could take you
to see <i>The Lion King.</i>

686
00:42:44,324 --> 00:42:47,294
[laughs] I don't want
to see <i>The Lion King.</i>

687
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:49,329
And anyways,
who would see to my farm?

688
00:42:49,362 --> 00:42:52,332
You run that by yourself?
Yeah, I do.

689
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,068
How many acres do you have?

690
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,804
I don't know.

691
00:42:57,537 --> 00:42:59,339
How do you not know
how many acres of land...

692
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:01,474
Because it's just a number.

693
00:43:01,508 --> 00:43:04,144
I'm all about numbers.
I manage money for a living.

694
00:43:04,177 --> 00:43:06,313
Oh, does money need you
to manage it?

695
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:10,517
I'm not sure.

696
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,354
You seem set.

697
00:43:15,756 --> 00:43:17,457
Waiting for that one?

698
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:19,860
I don't know.

699
00:43:19,894 --> 00:43:21,394
Hmm.

700
00:43:22,597 --> 00:43:24,197
I don't know.

701
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,299
What are you
waiting for?

702
00:43:28,936 --> 00:43:30,503
Me, I don't wait.

703
00:43:30,905 --> 00:43:33,239
Well, I do like that.

704
00:43:34,374 --> 00:43:35,876
You should come
to New York sometime.

705
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,444
I don't want
to see <i>The Lion King.</i>

706
00:43:37,477 --> 00:43:39,579
What do you want to see?
The ballet.

707
00:43:41,214 --> 00:43:43,550
Hmm. Wouldn't have guessed that.

708
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,318
Never been to one.

709
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:53,226
[Adam] I've heard he's
fallen in love with a donkey.

710
00:43:53,259 --> 00:43:54,762
Well, you heard wrong!

711
00:43:55,395 --> 00:43:57,464
I'm sorry.
I don't understand you people.

712
00:43:57,497 --> 00:44:00,868
You just seem to accept
these crazy things,

713
00:44:00,901 --> 00:44:04,204
like that gate situation and...

714
00:44:04,237 --> 00:44:05,605
And what?

715
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,607
Loneliness.

716
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:11,378
- Is that your car?
- I rented it.

717
00:44:11,411 --> 00:44:13,648
Why'd you bring
such a fine car to a farm?

718
00:44:14,414 --> 00:44:17,317
- For show.
- Yeah, I don't understand that.

719
00:44:26,226 --> 00:44:27,695
Have you eaten?

720
00:44:28,763 --> 00:44:29,930
No.

721
00:44:29,964 --> 00:44:31,666
Steer clear
of the pudding.

722
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:33,466
I think it's off.

723
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:38,438
You know what?
I know it's off.

724
00:44:46,413 --> 00:44:49,549
[man] An Irish picnic.
What kind of madness is this?

725
00:44:49,582 --> 00:44:51,686
We've done it
for the Americans.

726
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:53,954
The Yanks thought it would
be nice to have a picnic.

727
00:44:53,988 --> 00:44:56,589
- [man] Lord love them.
- Happy birthday, Tony.

728
00:44:56,623 --> 00:44:57,825
Mammy sends her love.

729
00:44:57,858 --> 00:44:59,860
Tell her to feel better.
I will.

730
00:44:59,894 --> 00:45:01,594
You going?
I am.

731
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:08,969
[Adam]
How's Rosemary's mother?

732
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:10,871
[Anthony]
She's in a bad way.

733
00:45:10,905 --> 00:45:13,741
- [Adam] How bad?
- [Anthony] Bad.

734
00:45:15,675 --> 00:45:17,745
[cow moos]

735
00:45:27,554 --> 00:45:29,289
What kind of cows
are these?

736
00:45:29,322 --> 00:45:31,491
They're called Charolais.
Away, lads. Go on.

737
00:45:35,628 --> 00:45:36,997
What are you doing?

738
00:45:37,031 --> 00:45:38,631
Picking mushrooms.

739
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:41,936
Are they okay to eat?

740
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:43,470
Yeah.

741
00:45:44,004 --> 00:45:45,873
It's a grand thing to do
with children.

742
00:45:45,906 --> 00:45:47,674
- Pick mushrooms.
- Hmm.

743
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:51,244
What a beautiful spot.

744
00:45:51,912 --> 00:45:53,580
Yep.

745
00:45:54,547 --> 00:45:56,516
[Adam] That one looks
a little freaked out.

746
00:45:57,684 --> 00:46:00,755
It's the coat.
He doesn't recognize me in the coat.

747
00:46:00,788 --> 00:46:02,522
They're hungry, though.

748
00:46:05,658 --> 00:46:06,726
Come on now.

749
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,069
So how many acres
do you have exactly?

750
00:46:15,102 --> 00:46:16,703
I don't know.

751
00:46:17,537 --> 00:46:20,040
How does nobody know
how many acres they have?

752
00:46:20,074 --> 00:46:22,275
We're not a direct people,
you know.

753
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:25,378
Do you want to be
a farmer then?

754
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:27,580
Yeah.
No, you don't.

755
00:46:28,048 --> 00:46:30,050
You want to own a farm.
It's not the same.

756
00:46:30,084 --> 00:46:31,751
I could be a farmer.

757
00:46:31,786 --> 00:46:33,286
Wake up.

758
00:46:33,753 --> 00:46:35,522
You're no farmer.

759
00:46:35,555 --> 00:46:36,924
It would be a bloody farce.

760
00:46:36,957 --> 00:46:38,859
[chuckles]

761
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:42,362
Maybe you've been
a farmer too long.

762
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,531
How's that?

763
00:46:48,102 --> 00:46:50,436
You been talking to Cleary?
What did he say?

764
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:53,506
Something about
you and a donkey.

765
00:46:55,575 --> 00:46:57,443
I'm going to kill
that man one day.

766
00:46:57,477 --> 00:46:59,679
The world will
thank me for it.

767
00:47:11,457 --> 00:47:14,561
[no audible dialogue]

768
00:47:46,093 --> 00:47:48,361
I can't sell you the farm.

769
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,767
Listen, Tony.

770
00:47:56,769 --> 00:47:58,538
Even if I have to put up
with the gates,

771
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,540
I'm still interested.
No.

772
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:02,910
God would fault me.

773
00:48:04,544 --> 00:48:06,412
Is it those two?

774
00:48:06,446 --> 00:48:08,148
[Tony] I don't know what
they're going to do,

775
00:48:08,182 --> 00:48:11,684
but I can't be the reason
they're apart.

776
00:48:33,073 --> 00:48:35,541
Lord, help me.

777
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:41,481
Oh, help me.

778
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:51,557
[Tony] <i>I was there</i>

779
00:48:51,591 --> 00:48:53,760
<i>on Aoife's wedding day.</i>

780
00:48:54,962 --> 00:48:57,864
<i>I never saw a lovelier bride.</i>

781
00:49:22,056 --> 00:49:24,857
[owl hooting]

782
00:49:28,628 --> 00:49:29,929
[Tony] Anthony.

783
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:32,465
Anthony!

784
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,600
[Anthony]
You all right?

785
00:49:36,103 --> 00:49:37,670
Bring me my pipe.

786
00:49:38,205 --> 00:49:39,974
Are you serious?
Your pipe?

787
00:49:40,007 --> 00:49:42,608
You can't smoke with the oxygen.
I don't want it.

788
00:49:42,642 --> 00:49:44,477
What are you doing?
You need that.

789
00:49:45,012 --> 00:49:49,016
Roll that tank out of my room.
I mean to do it.

790
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:50,583
Okay, I'll do it.

791
00:49:51,151 --> 00:49:52,785
The nurse will have
my head, though.

792
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:56,622
The nurse won't come
till morning.

793
00:49:56,656 --> 00:49:58,591
She'll smell the smoke.

794
00:49:58,624 --> 00:50:00,827
Her perfume is worse.

795
00:50:04,064 --> 00:50:05,132
It's late.

796
00:50:05,165 --> 00:50:07,101

- Look, I have to go. I'll come back another time.
- You'll come back, will you?

1117
01:13:15,554 --> 01:13:17,590
It's your first time here
since never.

1118
01:13:17,623 --> 01:13:19,290
Put down the weed whacker.

1119
01:13:19,692 --> 01:13:21,926
It's not a weed whacker.
It's a metal detector.

1120
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,929
What are you after out there
besides the odd treasure?

1121
01:13:25,698 --> 01:13:27,932
Unexpected stuff.

1122
01:13:27,966 --> 01:13:29,602
- Coins maybe.
- Coins.

1123
01:13:29,635 --> 01:13:31,437
You're out looking for coins
in this weather?

1124
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:34,139
Rosemary, I...
Just let me see if I have a Guinness.

1125
01:13:35,574 --> 01:13:37,543
I have a full day.

1126
01:13:37,576 --> 01:13:40,178
- [Adam] <i>Why do you make everything so hard?</i>
- [woman] <i>Me?</i>

1127
01:13:40,211 --> 01:13:43,047
Well, not you specifically.
The Irish.

1128
01:13:43,716 --> 01:13:48,454
It's like they never can really
seize the day, make a move.

1129
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,990
Well, it's an island, you know?
You gotta be careful.

1130
01:13:52,023 --> 01:13:53,726
You don't want to call
attention to yourself.

1131
01:13:53,759 --> 01:13:55,293
Well, see, I like attention.

1132
01:13:55,326 --> 01:13:57,630
Of course you do.
You're an American.

1133
01:13:58,329 --> 01:14:00,198
I tell ya, I'm just here
for the minute.

1134
01:14:00,231 --> 01:14:02,200
You will visit
or I'll know why.

1135
01:14:02,233 --> 01:14:04,470
Now, they say this new bottled
Guinness is as good as the pub,

1136
01:14:04,503 --> 01:14:07,105
but that's a lie,
but it isn't too bad, maybe.

1137
01:14:07,138 --> 01:14:08,574
Does it taste of glass?

1138
01:14:08,607 --> 01:14:10,241
It does.

1139
01:14:11,544 --> 01:14:13,077
You know what?
Don't open it.

1140
01:14:13,111 --> 01:14:14,447
I'm going to open it.
Don't.

1141
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,014
It's done. I've opened it.

1142
01:14:16,047 --> 01:14:18,183
Jesus.
It's useless but to drink now.

1143
01:14:18,216 --> 01:14:20,418
All right, share it with me.
Me? I couldn't.

1144
01:14:20,453 --> 01:14:23,054
- Pour it out into two glasses.
- You're only saying that

1145
01:14:23,087 --> 01:14:24,457
to divide the time
in half you'll stay.

1146
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,492
Sit down and share it
or I won't touch it.

1147
01:14:26,525 --> 01:14:30,428
Look at you. You are a demon
tempting me with a drink.

1148
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:36,569
[thunder rumbling]

- <i>Slàinte.</i>

1150
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:04,062
Jesus,
have you got a rope?

1151
01:15:04,095 --> 01:15:06,397
It's a perfect day
to be hanging yourself.

1152
01:15:06,799 --> 01:15:08,701
Don't joke.
Do you think about it?

1153
01:15:08,734 --> 01:15:11,504
What? No.

1154
01:15:11,537 --> 01:15:12,771
Why? Do you think about it?

1155
01:15:12,805 --> 01:15:15,306
Suicide?
I think of little else.

1156
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:18,243
You're not serious. Should probably
blow meself up and be done.

1157
01:15:18,276 --> 01:15:20,111
- With what?
- The shotgun.

1158
01:15:20,144 --> 01:15:22,080
Your father's old cannon?
You don't still have it?

1159
01:15:22,113 --> 01:15:24,349
I do. She lives in the hall closet.
Loaded and ready.

1160
01:15:24,382 --> 01:15:26,317
- I don't believe it.
- See for yourself.

1161
01:15:36,562 --> 01:15:38,531
Jesus.
Why do you keep it?

1162
01:15:38,564 --> 01:15:39,765
Against the depression.

1163
01:15:39,798 --> 01:15:41,399
What? You're depressed?

1164
01:15:42,133 --> 01:15:44,469
Are you serious?
I'm shattered with depression.

1165
01:15:44,502 --> 01:15:47,272
I'm shattered with black
clouds of depression.

1166
01:15:47,305 --> 01:15:48,139
But why?

1167
01:15:48,172 --> 01:15:50,275
Since I quit the cigarettes.

1168
01:15:50,308 --> 01:15:53,411
Oh, yeah, I heard you quit the damn smokes.
That's very good.

1169
01:15:53,444 --> 01:15:55,781
No, it isn't.
I've thought of taking poison.

1170
01:15:55,814 --> 01:16:00,084
I can't stand being alive. It's like a
kettle boiling blood that comes up into me.

1171
01:16:00,118 --> 01:16:01,486
You know, all these feelings.

1172
01:16:01,519 --> 01:16:04,422
Jesus, your own blood
turning against you.

1173
01:16:05,189 --> 01:16:07,458
I can see it.
Is it that plain?

1174
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,162
Sit down again.
Don't stand over me.

1175
01:16:13,197 --> 01:16:17,268
It's only the rare signs from
heaven that give me hope.

1176
01:16:17,302 --> 01:16:20,338
What you've got is anxiety.
That's what it is.

1177
01:16:20,371 --> 01:16:22,173
Is that the name for it?
Sure.

1178
01:16:22,206 --> 01:16:24,175
It comes over me in waves.
It's nothing.

1179
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:26,311
It's feelings boiling up,
isn't it?

1180
01:16:26,344 --> 01:16:28,714
Sure, I hate them.
Feelings are useless.

1181
01:16:28,747 --> 01:16:30,381
I think it's worse in a man.

1182
01:16:30,415 --> 01:16:32,350
I can't stand a man
with feelings.

1183
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:34,620
A man with feelings
should be put down!

1184
01:16:46,832 --> 01:16:48,701
Can I make you a sandwich?

1185
01:16:51,235 --> 01:16:53,338
- No.
- I'm going to.

1186
01:16:53,371 --> 01:16:56,474
I told ya, I have a full day.
[silverware drawer slams]

- [whimpering]
- There you go, Flossie.

1189
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:16,260
The Guinness is good.

1190
01:17:16,294 --> 01:17:18,664
- Do you like it?
- It's perfect.

1191
01:17:18,697 --> 01:17:20,465
It's not the pub.

1192
01:17:20,498 --> 01:17:22,300
No.

1193
01:17:22,801 --> 01:17:24,637
You should come by more.

1194
01:17:27,271 --> 01:17:29,374
A girl needs a chat.

1195
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:33,211
Can I make you
another sandwich?

1196
01:17:33,244 --> 01:17:35,313
Rosemary, I have to go.
You do not!

1197
01:17:35,346 --> 01:17:37,181
I have to get to the airport.

1198
01:17:37,215 --> 01:17:38,784
My cousin is coming
from America.

1199
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:42,353
Who? Frank's son. Adam Reilly.

1200
01:17:42,387 --> 01:17:45,323
Him? The show-off?
The one with the grand car?

1201
01:17:45,356 --> 01:17:46,859
The one who missed
all the funerals?

1202
01:17:46,892 --> 01:17:48,894
Yes, that one. He's...

1203
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,461
He's going to want
to be brought round.

1204
01:17:50,495 --> 01:17:52,330
What do you mean?
Well, he called me.

1205
01:17:52,363 --> 01:17:55,166
- He did?
- He's going to want to meet people.

1206
01:17:55,566 --> 01:17:56,702
Which?

1207
01:17:57,435 --> 01:17:59,270
- Well, you'd be good.
- Me?

1208
01:17:59,303 --> 01:18:01,272
We could swing by.

1209
01:18:01,305 --> 01:18:05,711
Swing by? You've never swung
by anywhere in your life.

1210
01:18:08,312 --> 01:18:10,515
All right, if you want to know
the utter truth...

1211
01:18:11,449 --> 01:18:14,419
I believe Adam is coming from
America in search of a wife.

1212
01:18:17,355 --> 01:18:18,824
That seems
a long way to come.

1213
01:18:18,857 --> 01:18:22,326
He has an idea an Irish woman
would be made of better stuff

1214
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,562
than these girls
he meets in America.

1215
01:18:24,595 --> 01:18:28,299
- That's true. What about Mary O'Connor?
- Mary O'Connor?

1216
01:18:28,934 --> 01:18:30,468
Does she still have
that whistling tooth?

1217
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:33,504
Yeah, she does. God love her.
No, I was...

1218
01:18:34,338 --> 01:18:36,742
I was thinking more
somebody like you.

1219
01:18:39,812 --> 01:18:41,747
Me?

1220
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,449
What? Who's like me?
Well...

1221
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,752
y-you are.

1222
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:51,556
I was thinking that maybe I
might let him take a look at you.

1223
01:18:52,457 --> 01:18:54,659
Take a look at me
in what way?

1224
01:18:57,628 --> 01:18:58,696
Your beauty.

1225
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,535
My beauty.

1226
01:19:04,569 --> 01:19:07,806
Well, this is the first
I've heard about beauty.

1227
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,440
Oh, don't pretend
you don't know.

1228
01:19:09,474 --> 01:19:11,409
Do you want to put me
in a shop window

1229
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:13,812
like one of those Euro
floozies in Amsterdam?

1230
01:19:13,846 --> 01:19:16,614
What are you talking about? Amsterdam?
I'm talking about your cousin!

1231
01:19:16,647 --> 01:19:21,252
And you'd bring him round to look me
over, would ya? Like I was a red heifer.

1232
01:19:21,854 --> 01:19:24,022
I see what you mean about
the smoking and giving it up.

1233
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:25,758
- You're not yourself.
- How would you know?

1234
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:28,026
- Your temper's rough.
- Did he offer you money?

1235
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:31,864
- I've got to get the car. He'll be waiting.
- Don't walk out on me.

1236
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:34,800
I have to go. Don't you make
me reach for that shotgun.

1237
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:37,301
Jesus Christ, Rosemary. The shotgun?
What are you talking?

1238
01:19:37,335 --> 01:19:39,637
If you turn your back on me,

1239
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:42,841
I swear by Satan,
I will blow a hole in ya.

1240
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:45,476
Christ, Rosemary, if it's this
bad, go back on the cigarettes.

1241
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:47,946
You'd put me back
on the smokes, would ya?

1242
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:49,514
Bad cess to ya.

1243
01:19:49,547 --> 01:19:51,382
Hey, don't be cursing me!

1244
01:19:51,415 --> 01:19:53,451
After what I've been through
with the detoxification.

1245
01:19:53,484 --> 01:19:55,553
Just sit down.
You're upsetting Flossie.

1246
01:19:55,586 --> 01:19:57,588
He lands soon.
I still have to get the car.

1247
01:19:57,622 --> 01:20:00,391
I'll drive ya.
You'll be there. Sit down.

1248
01:20:06,564 --> 01:20:08,666
You'll calm yourself then.
All right.

1249
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:11,502
Shh.

1250
01:20:13,671 --> 01:20:16,975
- You'll have another Guinness.
- I can't have two.

1251
01:20:17,009 --> 01:20:19,077
You haven't had one.
You had a half.

1252
01:20:19,111 --> 01:20:21,779
Jesus Christ.
Shh. Peace now.

[kicking against door]

1255
01:20:37,728 --> 01:20:39,430
Drink the Guinness.

1256
01:20:40,866 --> 01:20:42,600
Go on.

1257
01:20:44,602 --> 01:20:46,872
- Isn't that nice?
- Mm-hmm.

1258
01:20:53,879 --> 01:20:55,446
Are you a homosexual?

1259
01:20:55,479 --> 01:20:57,815
- What?
- Are you gay? Are you gay?

1260
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:58,884
No!

1261
01:21:00,085 --> 01:21:01,485
No.

1262
01:21:13,098 --> 01:21:14,632
Don't stand over me.

1263
01:21:20,906 --> 01:21:24,609
Why would you try to give
me away to your cousin?

1264
01:21:25,509 --> 01:21:27,478
It's a solid idea.

1265
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:30,148
He's a fine lad.
He's rich.

1266
01:21:30,182 --> 01:21:32,117
So what?
So what?

1267
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:34,485
Don't you want to be rich?
No, I want a man!

1268
01:21:34,518 --> 01:21:37,022
Adam's a man.
Adam smells like soap.

1269
01:21:37,788 --> 01:21:40,025
He smells like
the lilies of the field.

1270
01:21:40,058 --> 01:21:42,060
Why do you want to
smell the cows on me

1271
01:21:42,094 --> 01:21:43,896
when you can smell
the lilies on him?

1272
01:21:43,929 --> 01:21:46,664
I'm the one who should smell good.
A man should stink.

1273
01:21:46,697 --> 01:21:49,433
Like you!
Oh, well, thanks for that!

1274
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:51,203
- Don't provoke me!
- Me provoke?

1275
01:21:51,236 --> 01:21:53,939
The fact of you is enough
to put me off my game.

1276
01:21:59,244 --> 01:22:01,579
It's good
that you're tall.

1277
01:22:03,248 --> 01:22:05,083
Men are beasts.

1278
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:10,688
They need that height to balance
the truth and the goodness of women.

1279
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:15,693
There's no answer
to blather like that.

1280
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:22,034
Hope, it's a force...

1281
01:22:23,268 --> 01:22:26,238
and women are the salvation
of the world.

1282
01:22:26,271 --> 01:22:29,874
I believe that.
I mean to make you believe it.

1283
01:22:31,709 --> 01:22:33,644
I'd like to believe it.

1284
01:22:37,215 --> 01:22:40,551
There's no truth to that business
of you and the donkey, is there?

1285
01:22:40,584 --> 01:22:43,055
- Who told you that?
- I never believed it.

1286
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:44,990
I'll kill Cleary one day.

1287
01:22:47,525 --> 01:22:49,995
You should have come
for yourself.

1288
01:22:52,064 --> 01:22:53,764
No.

1289
01:22:56,168 --> 01:23:00,538
Thought maybe it was the
cigarettes put you off, so I quit.

1290
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:02,740
You did that with regards to me?
I did.

1291
01:23:02,773 --> 01:23:06,144
Brought me to my knees. I can tell you,
my emotions were unspeakable, Anthony.

1292
01:23:06,178 --> 01:23:09,081
Unspeakable.
I was desperate.

1293
01:23:10,215 --> 01:23:12,583
I went to New York.

1294
01:23:13,118 --> 01:23:15,653
- What? When?
- Tuesday.

1295
01:23:15,686 --> 01:23:17,122
[thunder rumbles]
[electricity crackles]

1296
01:23:17,155 --> 01:23:18,656
There goes the electric.

1297
01:23:18,689 --> 01:23:21,525
You went to New York
on Tuesday? How?

1298
01:23:21,559 --> 01:23:23,627
On a plane
and back Wednesday.

1299
01:23:23,661 --> 01:23:26,999
You went to New York City
for one day?

1300
01:23:28,599 --> 01:23:30,668
- And I kissed Adam.
- You what?

1301
01:23:30,701 --> 01:23:33,671
I kissed him!
I kissed him, I kissed him.

1302
01:23:33,704 --> 01:23:35,340
[loud thunderclap]

1303
01:23:35,374 --> 01:23:40,212
[captain] <i>Good morning, folks. We are
now starting our descent into Ireland.</i>

1304
01:23:40,245 --> 01:23:41,779
Are you being met?

1305
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,749
I am, yes. You?

1306
01:23:44,782 --> 01:23:46,051
No.

1307
01:23:48,786 --> 01:23:50,188
You snore.

1308
01:23:50,222 --> 01:23:53,091
[chuckles] Really?

1309
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:54,625
Yes.

1310
01:23:54,658 --> 01:23:56,061
I don't think I do.

1311
01:23:56,694 --> 01:23:58,863
Well,
you must be single.

1312
01:24:15,213 --> 01:24:16,881
What stops you?
Is it Fiona?

1313
01:24:16,914 --> 01:24:18,916
Are you still mooning over Fiona?
No.

1314
01:24:18,949 --> 01:24:20,951
I think it's Fiona.
Oh, to hell with Fiona!

1315
01:24:20,985 --> 01:24:23,321
I opened my heart to her
and she was gone like yesterday.

1316
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:25,157
What did you say to her?

1317
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:26,824
Never mind.

1318
01:24:32,097 --> 01:24:34,031
- Say it to me.
- No.

1319
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:46,043
Have you ever wondered...

1320
01:24:47,245 --> 01:24:50,082
what I wore
when I wore less?

1321
01:24:51,149 --> 01:24:54,086
You've lost me.
Have you seen me naked in your mind?

1322
01:24:54,119 --> 01:24:57,222
Oh, Jesus Christ, Rosemary. Naked?
Shut up with that. I see you at church.

1323
01:24:57,255 --> 01:25:02,227
You say I'm beautiful.
So have you thought about me?

1324
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:04,662
Have you thought
about my shape?

1325
01:25:05,796 --> 01:25:07,765
I don't know.
Have you thought about picking me up

1326
01:25:07,798 --> 01:25:10,135
and carrying me off
to the moon?

1327
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:13,838
No.

1328
01:25:13,871 --> 01:25:15,706
What is it? Just tell me.
Are you a virgin?

1329
01:25:15,739 --> 01:25:17,375
I'm past the time!
I've still to get the car!

1330
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:18,876
No, I'm driving you!

1331
01:25:18,909 --> 01:25:21,645
You kissed him!
It was he that kissed me!

1332
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,981
That's what got him worked up!
That's why he's coming!

1333
01:25:24,014 --> 01:25:28,018
Time is running out.
Now you tell me your secret, Anthony.

1334
01:25:28,886 --> 01:25:31,389
I told Fiona
and she ran like Satan.

1335
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:33,691
I am off-kilter.
It doesn't matter how.

1336
01:25:33,724 --> 01:25:35,693
Is it because
you hate people?

1337
01:25:35,726 --> 01:25:37,995
No, I don't hate no one!

1338
01:25:38,028 --> 01:25:39,730
You can't shock me.

1339
01:25:39,763 --> 01:25:42,766
I have thought of everything.
I've made my peace with it.

1340
01:25:44,202 --> 01:25:45,736
Go on.

1341
01:25:50,475 --> 01:25:52,643
- What?
- [sniffling]

1342
01:25:53,478 --> 01:25:55,012
All right.

1343
01:25:56,181 --> 01:25:57,648
Okay.

1344
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:05,624
I believe that
I am a honey bee.

1345
01:26:12,164 --> 01:26:13,831
Say that again.

1346
01:26:18,436 --> 01:26:20,938
I believe that
I am a honey bee.

1347
01:26:25,477 --> 01:26:27,179
I'll get the car.

1348
01:26:34,151 --> 01:26:36,787
I don't believe it.
You don't think you're a honey bee!

1349
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:38,356
You're having me on.

1350
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,925
You do? How long?

1351
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:43,328
I don't know. I think that I'm a honey bee.
I always have.

1352
01:26:43,361 --> 01:26:46,964
- You are Anthony Reilly.
- Whatever I am, God knows me.

1353
01:26:46,997 --> 01:26:49,267
Is this why you never told me
I was beautiful?

1354
01:26:49,301 --> 01:26:51,835
Well, that and the nearness
of your farm to mine.

1355
01:26:51,869 --> 01:26:54,071
And it's true.
Bees don't like smoke.

1356
01:26:54,104 --> 01:26:55,407
Let me drive.

1357
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,074
No.
Slow down.

1358
01:26:57,107 --> 01:26:59,009
I don't care if you think
you're a bee, Anthony.

1359
01:26:59,043 --> 01:27:02,314
You think you're a bee!
I mean, you think you're a bee!

1360
01:27:02,347 --> 01:27:04,216
Keep your eyes on the road.

1361
01:27:04,249 --> 01:27:05,483
Never mind! I don't care!

1362
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:08,220
I'm half dying
with living for you.

1363
01:27:09,554 --> 01:27:11,423
[Anthony] Watch out!

1364
01:27:11,456 --> 01:27:13,023
Mind the road.

1365
01:27:13,824 --> 01:27:15,493
Do you think I'm a bee?
No.

1366
01:27:15,527 --> 01:27:18,862
- May I know what I am?
- You're a flower.

1367
01:27:18,896 --> 01:27:20,498
The most beautiful
bloom that grows.

1368
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:22,967
- Do you really think that?
- Yes.

1369
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,069
Anthony,
you are good for me.

1370
01:27:25,102 --> 01:27:27,805
No, I'm a disgrace! We'll get Adam.
You've already kissed him.

1371
01:27:27,838 --> 01:27:30,275
- He kissed me!
- You'll marry and go to America.

1372
01:27:30,308 --> 01:27:32,444
- Have you never thought to marry me yourself?
- I have.

1373
01:27:32,477 --> 01:27:34,845
- What stopped ya?
- I came to your house and when I looked

1374
01:27:34,878 --> 01:27:37,315
for my Mam's ring,
sure I'd lost it altogether.

1375
01:27:37,349 --> 01:27:41,519
Is that what you've been doing with that metal
detector? Looking for your mother's ring?

1376
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:43,854
The fact that I lost it
said it all.

1377
01:27:43,887 --> 01:27:46,291
A man like me
should not marry.

1378
01:27:46,324 --> 01:27:49,059
- Watch out!
- [sheep bleating]

1379
01:27:49,093 --> 01:27:51,195
You're going to
bust the axle.

1380
01:27:51,228 --> 01:27:54,231
- Everybody thinks they're something they're not!
- But not a bee.

1381
01:27:56,301 --> 01:27:58,270
Watch out! Watch out!

1382
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:01,939
[crash]

1383
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:14,386
You've destroyed the car.
It's fine.

1384
01:28:14,419 --> 01:28:15,953
It's not fine!
It's my car!

1385
01:28:15,986 --> 01:28:17,955
Look at it!
To hell with the car!

1386
01:28:17,988 --> 01:28:20,824
- [thunderclaps]
- [whinnying]

1387
01:28:25,597 --> 01:28:28,433
What? Oh, perfect!

1388
01:28:28,466 --> 01:28:31,035
Perfect! Would you
make up your mind!

1389
01:28:31,068 --> 01:28:32,970
Are you raining
or shining on us?

1390
01:28:33,003 --> 01:28:36,040
Tell me, standing on
this holy land of Ireland,

1391
01:28:36,073 --> 01:28:37,841
why shouldn't you marry me?

1392
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:40,144
I see things.
I'm delusional.

1393
01:28:40,177 --> 01:28:42,913
For the love of God, woman,
I think I'm a bug.

1394
01:28:42,946 --> 01:28:45,182
So what? Sometimes
I think I'm a house cat.

1395
01:28:45,215 --> 01:28:47,851
- You do not!
- But I don't stay with it.

1396
01:28:47,885 --> 01:28:50,087
Because I know I'm a swan.

1397
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,624
You do not literally
think you're a swan.

1398
01:28:52,657 --> 01:28:55,527
I do. Does that make me
useless as a wife?

1399
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,329
Don't muddy the waters.

1400
01:28:57,362 --> 01:29:00,332
Jesus Christ in heaven,
we're walking in circles.

1401
01:29:00,365 --> 01:29:01,633
We're standing on your land.

1402
01:29:01,666 --> 01:29:04,301
Just give us a chance.

1403
01:29:04,336 --> 01:29:06,136
[sighs]

1404
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:10,107
If it was meant to be,
I'd have found the ring.

1405
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:14,479
We say what's meant.
Life is here. We name it.

1406
01:29:14,512 --> 01:29:17,948
- But Adam is waiting.
- Look at me.

1407
01:29:17,981 --> 01:29:20,117
Look how I look at you.

1408
01:29:22,086 --> 01:29:25,089
I don't know if I can live
shut in a house with a woman.

1409
01:29:25,122 --> 01:29:26,990
You can have the winds
and the fields.

1410
01:29:27,024 --> 01:29:30,160
You just think of me
as the open door.

1411
01:29:30,194 --> 01:29:31,463
And here, fool.

1412
01:29:32,597 --> 01:29:34,932
You can have your ring, too.

1413
01:29:34,965 --> 01:29:38,335
- What's this?
- Found it by my gate.

1414
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,070
My mother's ring.

1415
01:29:40,104 --> 01:29:42,374
Thought it heaven-sent
to give me hope.

1416
01:29:42,407 --> 01:29:47,645
What do I have to do? Do I have to
swat at you to get you to sting me?

1417
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:50,314
I'm afraid.
