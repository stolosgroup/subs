2
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,211
You're going to be
looking at the rain

3
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:29,131
hitting ground midnight tonight,
moving in from the coast.

4
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:30,925
- Morning, Mark.
- Morning, Mark.

5
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,177
- Loser.
- Loser.

6
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,305
Daiquirí.

7
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,015
It's a village in Cuba.

8
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,975
- It's got three I's in it.
- Oh.

9
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,895
- And toast.
- Huh.

10
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,730
Mark, can you, uh...

11
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,992
- You know that's not real food, right?
- I know.

12
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,078
- Mark, eat something healthy.
- To be fair,

13
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,996
Dad, you're gonna be eating
an entire pint

14
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,667
of Chubby Hubby by yourself
in approximately eight hours.

15
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,379
You know you have math class
today, right, Mark?

16
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,299
What I know, Dad, is that
the capital of Burkina Faso

17
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:13,884
is Ouagadougou.

18
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,594
Is that...?

19
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,847
- O-U-A-G-A-D...
- Hang on, hang on.

20
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,139
- O-U...
- O-U...

21
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,725
- You are such a loser.
- You are such a loser.

22
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,644
- I am not. You...
- I... You are.

23
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,937
- I'm not.
- I'm not.

24
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,105
You'll be at Emma's
soccer game, right?

25
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,440
I'm sorry,
but that is incorrect.

26
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,373
- No, texter. Let it go.
- Uh...

27
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,302
Uh, the keys are in your bag.

28
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,096
Bless you.

29
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:11,043
It's, uh, straight down
that way,

30
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,128
and then it's kind of
one of these things,

31
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,922
and then it's your first right.

32
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,132
- But wait.
- I got kind of a Sherlock thing.

33
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,176
- I love that show.
- "The game is afoot!"

34
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,470
"Game is afoot."

35
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,098
Why would you say that?

36
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,200
Let's take one more look

37
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,201
at your winning numbers today:

38
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,537
42, 10, 25, 76...

39
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,622
Oh, my God. I-I won.

40
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,707
I just won!

41
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,167
I won the lottery.
Oh, my God!

42
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,127
Yeah!

43
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,274
Sorry.

44
00:05:58,942 --> 00:05:59,902
Are you okay?

45
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,361
Thank you.

46
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,698
You're the Sherlock guy.

47
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,743
Did I give you directions
earlier?

48
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,037
...like, the sun is 400 times
bigger than the moon,

49
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,456
but it's also 400 times
farther away,

50
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,416
so they look like
they're the same size,

51
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,793
- but they're not.
- Mm.

52
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,544
- Um...
- And that is why we have eclipses.

53
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:18,712
This is me.

54
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,589
Well, would you want
to hang out later?

55
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,299
Tonight or something?

56
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,468
Uh, I've got something.

57
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,346
Oh. Uh, thank you.

58
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,057
For your time.

59
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,772
- Bye.
- Bye.

60
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,419
Hey, man.

61
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,004
Hey.

62
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:04,842
Dude, those guys have armor.

63
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,218
- You got to use the rocket launcher.
- Yeah. No way.

64
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,928
- Shotgun. Watch. Ooh!
- Here.

65
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,389
- You're not John Wick.
- Just a little bit of sniper rifle.

66
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,682
- Your projectile's only gonna make it worse.
- No, no, no!

67
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,975
Not in the face.
Not in the face. No, no.

68
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,185
Not in the face.
Not in the face. No, no...

69
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,275
He got you in the face.

70
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,861
Yeah, I know, Mark,
he got me in the face.

71
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,029
I'm never gonna find that key.

72
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,823
What if your whole life
was like that?

73
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,032
What, where you die and respawn?

74
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,659
Yeah.

75
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,995
Or, like, you go to bed,
and when you wake up,

76
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,373
it's the same day all over
again, just on repeat.

77
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,791
What would you do?

78
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,169
- Besides this?
- Or in addition.

79
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,212
You know?
Switch it up a little.

80
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,256
Wait, wasn't that a movie
where Bill Murray's stuck

81
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,675
in the same day till he has sex
with his hot boss?

82
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,093
Groundhog Day.

83
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,595
Then that's it right there.

84
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:50,596
Girls.

85
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,889
You wouldn't... I don't know...

86
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,056
Tie a bunch of balloons

87
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,725
to a lawn chair or something?

88
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,935
Dude, no.
I'd definitely take the girl.

89
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,021
- Okay, forget that.
- No, no, no!

90
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,315
- You could be a force for good.
- Like Batman?

91
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,275
- Yeah, like Batman.
- But are we talking

92
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,611
Dark Knight Batman or
Ben Affleck Batman, because...

93
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,530
Dude, The Animated Series,
obviously.

94
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,616
No, I'd still take the girl.

95
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,576
I feel like it would
ultimately be more satisfying.

96
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,953
- Yeah! Hole in one!
- All right.

97
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,914
But it might be harder
than you think.

98
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,710
Dude, you'd get, like,
infinite do-overs.

99
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,712
You'd just iterate.
Straight A-B testing.

100
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,839
Right. If there's
infinite do-overs,

101
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,716
then sooner or later,
it has to happen.

102
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,677
Just, like, mathematically.

103
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,846
Maybe it's like pi, though.

104
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,140
Just goes on forever.

105
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,684
There could be infinite ways
for you not to get laid.

106
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,186
Yes!

107
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,357
Oh. -Oh, uh, next time...

108
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,364
Then you'd never get out
of the loop.

109
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,326
Right, but why
would you want to?

110
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,120
You'd be the center
of the universe.

111
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,039
- You could do anything.
- Yeah, but it could get

112
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,708
- boring or lonely.
- No way.

113
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:05,462
Man, I mean, you would be,
like, the king of everything.

114
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,881
Hi, honey.

115
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,052
- Sure, you will.
- No.

116
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,512
But say it's you
and you tell me.

117
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,138
- I'd just forget.
- Right, but you'd never

118
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,723
- believe me anyway.
- We could've had this

119
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,225
exact conversation, like,
50 times already.

120
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,309
- Yeah.
- The repetition.

121
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,103
'Cause it's not...

122
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,771
No, I don't think
I am being defensive.

123
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,189
I'm looking at this
as an opportunity.

124
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,524
The isolation.

125
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,654
You'd be like
the last man on Earth.

126
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,165
Three, two, one.

127
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,543
What,

128
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,378
where you die and respawn?

129
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,345
Morning, Mark.

130
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,472
- Loser.
- Loser.

131
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,645
Straight down that way,
and then there's...

132
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,105
there's, like, one of those,

133
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,648
and you just take a right.

134
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,275
- Uh, wait.
- Psychic.

135
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,485
Uh, I love psychics!

136
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,700
So, what'd she look like?

137
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,452
- She's kind of tall, got frizzy hair.
- Ah!

138
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,079
Sort of, like, a long nose.

139
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,955
Not, like, a long, long nose,
but like a... like a...

140
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,749
So, not conventionally
the prettiest girl ever.

141
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,125
No, no, she's cute.
She's cute.

142
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,377
Oh, so you're into her.

143
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,052
No.

144
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,637
So you're not into her.

145
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,973
Well, like,
I'm not not into her.

146
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,518
Dude, then why are you
looking for her?

147
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,561
Okay, fine,
I'm completely in love

148
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,271
with the girl from the pool.

149
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,607
- What was she wearing?
- She was wearing boots.

150
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,234
Who wears boots to the pool?

151
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,610
She's probably goth.

152
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,654
She's probably at
the Barnes &amp; Nobles at the mall

153
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,155
reading a manga right now.

154
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,949
Dude, this girl does not
hang out at the mall.

155
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,325
She's too good
for the mall, huh?

156
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,202
No, she's not
too good for the mall.

157
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,954
- I didn't...
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,747
Feelings for this one you have.

159
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,791
Okay, is that Darth Vader
or Yoda?

160
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,419
'Cause you have to pick one. You can't do both.

161
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,430
Hey!

162
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,564
Okay, does she have any tattoos?

163
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,023
I'm not trying to I.D.
her corpse.

164
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,901
She did drop a flyer
for a missing dog, though.

165
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,820
Mark, okay.

166
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,655
On the flyer,
it'll have her phone number.

167
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,032
Right.
Yeah, and I called the number,

168
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,492
and some guy picked up...

169
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,536
Who does have a daughter,
but she's eight.

170
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,996
And he seemed really upset

171
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,622
that I was using
his personal misfortune

172
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:28,832
to try and meet a girl.

173
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,375
- Which is...
- Which is fair.

174
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,460
- Yeah, that's fair.
- That's fair.

175
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,836
But wait. So she's looking

176
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,254
for the dog,
but it's not her dog?

177
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,298
You think maybe
there's a reward?

178
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,008
Did you try a dog shelter?

179
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,259
Can I help you?

180
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,179
Uh, y-yeah.
I'm-I'm looking for a girl.

181
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,889
We just have animals.

182
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,765
- Yeah.
- A vet?

183
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,483
An alley behind a restaurant?

184
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,526
I doubt she's looking
for actual Tramp

185
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,196
from Lady and the Tramp,
but thank you.

186
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,114
Maybe it's better
this way, you know?

187
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,699
Maybe you were gonna
have this, like,

188
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,618
doomed, toxic romance.

189
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,036
Maybe you dodged a bullet.

190
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,057
Hey, no, no. Hey!

191
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,892
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

192
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,393
Come on.

193
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,653
Great.

194
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,159
Uh, h-hey.

195
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,666
- Hi.
- Hi.

196
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,959
Uh, I'm Mark.

197
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,503
Uh, I just had a quick question.

198
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,837
- Okay.
- I was wondering...

199
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,548
This is gonna sound
really strange...

200
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,424
God, really bizarre...

201
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,843
But are you experiencing
any kind of temporal anomaly

202
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,720
in your life?

203
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,100
By "temporal anomaly," I mean...

204
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,894
I know what temporal anomaly is.

205
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,354
Okay, great.

206
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,357
So, what specifically
I was wondering is...

207
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,609
The thing where
the same day keeps happening?

208
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,990
Whoa. Okay.

209
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,493
Um...

210
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,204
I-I thought nobody else knew.

211
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,456
- Well, somebody does. Um...
- Yeah.

212
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,918
I-I saw you at the pool before.

213
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,296
You caught a-a beach ball, and
that had never happened before.

214
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,924
So I-I figured that
you probably had free will.

215
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,844
I've actually been looking
all over for you.

216
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,263
- You have?
- Y-Yeah.

217
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,807
You dropped a flyer
for a missing dog,

218
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,559
and I found it,
and the phone number on it

219
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,019
wasn't you-yours.

220
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,354
No, it wasn't.

221
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,106
So, what have you been up to
with, I mean,

222
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,317
like, I guess, in-infinite time?

223
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,152
Oh, you know, like,
solving crimes

224
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,403
and, like, finding true love.

225
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,738
Really?

226
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,908
No. Um, I've been
teaching myself how to drive.

227
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,536
Figure it doesn't matter
if I crash because, you know,

228
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,787
- time loop.
- Time loop, yeah.

229
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:16,249
- So...
- I was gonna try and-and cure cancer.

230
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,959
- Like that's what this was all for.
- Oh, wow.

231
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,669
And then when I figured it out,
it would...

232
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,379
time would start up again,
and I would basically

233
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:24,299
- have saved the entire world.
- Oh. How's that going?

234
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,384
Not that great. So far,
not a lot of real progress.

235
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,511
Maybe you set your sights,
like, too high.

236
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,888
Yeah. Like, maybe I should have

237
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,806
just tried to cure
athlete's foot.

238
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,807
Pink eye.

239
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,184
Indigestion.

240
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,394
Well...

241
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,647
- Mark.
- Mark, this has been fun,

242
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,398
but, um, I actually have to go.

243
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,858
- You do?
- Yeah.

244
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,652
You know, 'cause, 'cause, uh

245
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,445
I mean, you know
that the same thing

246
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,155
is just gonna happen again
tomorrow, right?

247
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,032
Yeah.
Yeah, I do know that, yeah.

248
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,284
Sorry. I mean,
but it's like, you know,

249
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,328
it's great being
the only one who knows

250
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,497
what's gonna come next,
but it's also...

251
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,333
weird.

252
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,043
Like, everything that's happened

253
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,961
has happened
like a thousand times.

254
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,881
Everyone's, like,
sleepwalking, you know?

255
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,258
They think this is all there is.

256
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,136
Yeah. Like everyone else
is dreaming

257
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,596
and you're the only one
who's awake.

258
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,681
Exactly.

259
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,360
I know you have to go, but-but
you really need to see this.

260
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,295
No, you have to hide.

261
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,299
Here it comes.

262
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,678
Sorry.

263
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,722
- What? Where's my phone?
- Sammy, the phone!

264
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,306
Oh, no! Sammy, come back!

265
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,599
- Dude, your dog...
- Come on, Sammy!

266
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,184
Your dog is taking my phone!

267
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,690
I've watched that
like ten times.

268
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,651
- I think it's a metaphor for something.
- Hmm.

269
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:07,986
Come on.

270
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,196
There's a better one.

271
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,408
Run!

272
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,034
So, he's explaining

273
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,328
how feminists control the world
and that's why

274
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,581
no one will read
his poetry, when...

275
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,252
Quarters... drops them.

276
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,379
Now the recovery.

277
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:29,090
Oh, but it would appear his
Linkin Park-style wallet chain

278
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,468
got stuck under his bootheel
and the consequences

279
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,845
were nothing short
of disastrous.

280
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,972
I know it's wrong to laugh
at other people's misfortune...

281
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,434
But they are
objectively hilarious.

282
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,316
Um, I really have to go.

283
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,359
C-Could I have your number?

284
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,987
I'm sorry. I know that
it's kind of like, um...

285
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,156
But I just figured, since we're
stuck in the same day

286
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,074
for pretty much forever,
it-it'd be good

287
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,659
- to keep in touch.
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

288
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,871
No, not yet.

289
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,748
No, I don't think
I am being defensive.

290
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,583
Eight, five, nine...

291
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,335
one, seven...

292
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,131
...true love.

293
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,435
Hi.

294
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,688
I'm supposed to be
in summer school.

295
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,692
But I've only gone like twice.

296
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,819
I want to... I want to go
to art school,

297
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,822
but my parents are obsessed
with putting me in honors math.

298
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,117
- You're in honors math, aren't you?
- No.

299
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,994
I'm in AP.

300
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,662
Why do you think
these things keep happening?

301
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,997
I don't know.

302
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,498
I honestly didn't figure it out
until there was

303
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,334
no new Doctor Who.

304
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,962
Why? Why do you ask?

305
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,134
I don't know. I'm just glad

306
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,844
that Stephen Hawking
isn't here to see this,

307
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,679
because it totally violates
all known science.

308
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:22,931
So, what's the craziest thing

309
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,266
you've done so far?

310
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,560
- Crazy, like...?
- I tried to hop a freight train once.

311
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,853
How'd that turn out?

312
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,522
I got way more respect
for hobos now.

313
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:34,025
I did, however,
ride my bike through school.

314
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,907
Wow. Impressive.

315
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,325
Are you, like, five?

316
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,453
Well, I guess the practical
application is limited.

317
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,206
Okay, but what if you were
driving your Lamborghini

318
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,875
into, like, a candy shop

319
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,753
and the time loop ended
and you were naked?

320
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,005
See, that is exactly
what I'm talking about.

321
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,591
You must have done
at least one cool thing.

322
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,677
I put my chess app
on maximum difficulty.

323
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,512
- And?
- I lost.

324
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,805
There's got to be
something else.

325
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,308
Okay, I'll show you.

326
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,687
Hey, watch it!

327
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,444
You ever wish that today
happened on a different day?

328
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,322
Like Christmas or your birthday?

329
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,658
I wish I'd painted my nails
yesterday.

330
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,577
Really? I like them.
It's just nice.

331
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,538
It's like a nice, um,
chartreuse, right?

332
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,707
- That's a green.
- They're always chipped.

333
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,044
I think that looks cool.

334
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,713
Thank you.

335
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,424
I just wish today
wasn't the day my dad decides

336
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,718
to have "the talk"
about my future.

337
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,012
Besides, who knows what they
want to be when they're 17?

338
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,555
- I do.
- Really?

339
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,265
Aerospace engineer.

340
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,726
Specifically a NASA
mission specialist.

341
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,521
Wait. Like an astronaut?

342
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,442
'Cause that's cool.
That's like a...

343
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,819
I mean, it's just,
like, a big call.

344
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,571
I have 20/20 vision,
uncorrected, so...

345
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,533
You never know how shit

346
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,869
your friend's taste in music is
till you steal her car.

347
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,746
Y-You stole this car?

348
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:10,955
I need it more
than Marissa does.

349
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,707
And honestly, this song is

350
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,126
kind of growing on me.
Right?

351
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,377
Bro, my lane!

352
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,881
- Whoa.
- Don't worry.

353
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,091
I'm pretty sure if I kill us
in a car accident

354
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,260
that we come back to life.

355
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,096
Yeah.

356
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,517
God, there must be a lot
of people who die today.

357
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,896
You only just thought of that?

358
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,898
150,000.

359
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:40,610
- What?
- That's how many people die every day... 150,000.

360
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,820
Geez.

361
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,238
And you'd just go through it

362
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,740
over and over again,
like Sisyphus.

363
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,117
Worse.
He was just pushing a big rock.

364
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,411
Dude, do you drive?!

365
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,206
Sorry, that was depressing.

366
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,874
Yeah.

367
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,335
Probably a lot of people's
birthday today, too.

368
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,879
Yeah.

369
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,353
Come on.

370
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,651
Come on!
We're gonna be late.

371
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,497
Okay.

372
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:49,679
I don't get it.

373
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,139
Shh.

374
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm good, thanks.

375
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,071
Look.

376
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,341
How did you find that?

377
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,595
I was looking for that dog.

378
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,598
You know, the one on the flyer.

379
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,476
I don't even know why.

380
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,437
I just have all this...
this time.

381
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,982
I guess I just wanted to try
and, like, fix something.

382
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,401
Which I know doesn't even
make sense.

383
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,403
You can't find it anyway.

384
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:04,670
I think I identify
with that fish.

385
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:16,515
Okay, Jared. I'm coming.

386
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,480
So, I'll see you around?

387
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,399
- 19 million.
- What?

388
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:29,612
That's how many people's
birthday it is today.

389
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:34,617
Bye, Mark.

390
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,078
Hey, did you do that
in your head?

391
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,008
No, I don't think
I am being defensive.

392
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:53,344
I'm looking at this
as an opportunity.

393
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,607
Three, two...

394
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,611
Crazy, like...?

395
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,133
Mark, I hate to be judgmental,

396
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,260
but why are we watching
a bunch of skate rats?

397
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,344
You'll see.

398
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,305
It's like your thing
with the eagle.

399
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,807
It doesn't really seem that much
like my thing with the eagle.

400
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,518
Margaret, what is
the one universal law

401
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,395
of all skate rats everywhere?

402
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:47,606
Um, that, ironically,

403
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,735
even though skating
completely identifies them,

404
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,779
they suck at it, like, a lot.

405
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,781
Exactly.

406
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:56,949
You said 2:00.

407
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,576
Yeah, I thought you were
gonna be late.

408
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,995
Any luck with the dog?

409
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,288
- What do you got?
- Oh!

410
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,124
It might be time to give up
on the dog.

411
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,544
- Oh! You all right, man?
- I lied before.

412
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,213
I love being judgmental.

413
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,176
- Here she comes.
- Come on.

414
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,886
Some kind of joke?

415
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,220
Does your mom know you're here?

416
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,515
There's no way
you're landing this!

417
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,777
Pretty cool, huh?

418
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,030
Yeah.

419
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,157
Just wanted to hear you say it.

420
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,244
Whoa!

421
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,163
So, who's Jared?

422
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,582
He's a med student.

423
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,417
How old is that guy?

424
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:51,337
21. Graduated Harvard at 19.

425
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,173
Uh, I-I-look out!

426
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,932
- So, I have a theory.
- Yeah?

427
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,434
You know how the fourth
dimension's supposed to be time?

428
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,228
- Yeah.
- So, what if, like,

429
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,355
these fourth-dimensional beings
are sort of, like,

430
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,732
toying with us?
Like, they bent time in a circle

431
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:14,026
and now we have to live the
same day over and over again,

432
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,653
- like on a hamster wheel.
- Right.

433
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:16,737
For their amusement.

434
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:18,114
Except time's not
the fourth dimension.

435
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,365
- It's not?
- No.

436
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,866
Not in any meaningful
Euclidean sense.

437
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,535
Oh, yeah, well,
of course it's not.

438
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,536
Incoming.

439
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,247
Incoming!

440
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,669
That's what I think
that this is all about.

441
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,462
What, eating all the ice cream
in the world

442
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,922
and not getting fat?

443
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,466
No, you showed me this
when you showed me the eagle.

444
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,176
I mean, think about it.

445
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,053
Most of life is just junk,
right?

446
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,221
It's-it's filler.

447
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,973
And then...

448
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,851
there's these moments

449
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:50,271
when all the randomness turns
into something perfect.

450
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,649
It's like life's dropping
all the bullshit

451
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,068
just for a second
to show us how amazing

452
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:59,113
it could be all the time
if it wanted to.

453
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,866
Hmm. I don't know.

454
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:05,619
I think maybe we're supposed
to become, like, better people.

455
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:08,205
Though I honestly don't even
know how that could be possible.

456
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,457
I mean, think about it.

457
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,000
We must miss so many of them.

458
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,002
All those tiny perfect things,

459
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,962
they're just... poof... gone.

460
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,881
Lost forever.

461
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,593
But not today.

462
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,804
That is a disturbingly
inspirational idea, Mark.

463
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:26,932
But... mmm... I have to go.

464
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,482
Why do I always feel like,
even though we're stuck

465
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,026
in the same day together,
I am never gonna see you again?

466
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,196
Because you watch
too much Doctor Who.

467
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,448
Wait.
What if we found them all?

468
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,037
- What do you mean?
- All the perfect things

469
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,208
in this one town,
in this one day...

470
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,542
We could collect them.

471
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:54,919
Like Pokémon?

472
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,171
Kind of like Pokémon.

473
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,466
We'd be like partners.

474
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,010
I mean, talk about
seizing the day.

475
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,137
The day's been seized.

476
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:07,890
It's right here.
It's waiting for us.

477
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,643
Mark, you don't understand,
okay?

478
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:11,894
I'm not like you.

479
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,979
I don't want to seize the day.

480
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,857
I just don't want the day
to seize me.

481
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,152
Okay?

482
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:27,201
I'm just trying
to get through this.

483
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,078
So am I.

484
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,457
We're not that different,
Margaret.

485
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,084
We're not like other people.

486
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,294
Everyone else gets
a brand-new day every day,

487
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:40,548
but not us...
This is the only one we have.

488
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:44,552
Sometimes I think,
what if it's not enough?

489
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:48,305
I just want it
to mean something.

490
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:54,728
Besides, you know, it's just us.

491
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,732
Everyone else is asleep.

492
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,332
You know what you
said about the fourth dimension?

493
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,792
The one that's not time?

494
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,211
Yeah. It's still not time.

495
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:23,007
But I've been thinking about
what it really is, and...

496
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,217
You know we have
three dimensions, right?

497
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,844
- Right?
- Go on.

498
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,429
Okay, so now think
about your shadow.

499
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,097
Okay, your shadow
is two-dimensional.

500
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,307
It's flat.

501
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,100
So think about something
that would cast

502
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,394
a three-dimensional shadow...
That's the fourth dimension.

503
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,980
I mean, technically,
we're just the shadows

504
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,190
of four-dimensional people.

505
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,861
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

506
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,451
Somebody actually figured out
what a 4D cube would look like.

507
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:56,498
I taught myself how to draw it.

508
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,418
When I was little, I used to
look for it everywhere.

509
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:04,465
I mean, theoretically,
it's around us all the time.

510
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,884
We're just not looking
in the right direction.

511
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,561
You could see everything
from in there.

512
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,732
And you could see inside things,
you could never get lost.

513
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:25,444
It's like the whole world
is a map of itself.

514
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,580
But I never found it.

515
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,459
I guess this is all there is.

516
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,462
So you just gave up?

517
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,006
Well, if the fourth dimension
wants to stop hiding

518
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,759
like a little bitch,
it knows where to find me.

519
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,600
So, how are we gonna do it?

520
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,268
Do what?

521
00:32:58,352 --> 00:32:59,895
Find the
perfect things or whatever.

522
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,189
We need a methodology, right?

523
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,733
Like a... like a system?

524
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,820
Well, we want to be rigorous
about it, so maybe, like,

525
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,280
take a survey map of the town
and, like, lay a grid over it

526
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:13,117
and split it up into squares,
each square is a 24-hour log,

527
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,743
and then you could take half,
and I...

528
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:17,371
Or we could just walk around
looking for cool stuff.

529
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,040
- Like partners?
- Like allies.

530
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:21,500
Like the U.S. and Canada.

531
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,710
- And I'll be...
- I'm Canada.

532
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:23,961
- No, you can't be Can...
- Too slow.

533
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,462
- I'm Canada.
- Sir?

534
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,387
- You did not.
- Oh, yes.

535
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,055
That was my thing.

536
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,807
That's my thing.

537
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,684
- Well, I took your thing.
- I showed you that.

538
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,686
I took it.

539
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,697
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

540
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,860
I'm sorry.

541
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,952
It's on!

542
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,590
You know all that math
you're supposed to be learning?

543
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,966
Maybe.

544
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,384
I'm gonna teach it to you.

545
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:18,760
No.

546
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,512
I can't keep hanging out
with someone who's ignorant

547
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:21,597
of basic logarithmic functions.

548
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,473
Mark, Mark, look at yourself.

549
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,476
You're a nerd who sucks at math.

550
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,853
Where does that leave you?

551
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,688
So, the first thing

552
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:34,276
that you need to know about math
is that it's always perfect.

553
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,986
If I don't use this stuff
later in life,

554
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,155
my fat, bitter middle-aged self
is gonna find you...

555
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,948
Look.

556
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,084
Wow.

557
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,715
Can I tell you a secret?

558
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,091
Of course.

559
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:01,511
Sometimes I don't
want this day to end.

560
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:04,139
I just want time
to stay broken forever.

561
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,484
Have you ever seen Time Bandits?

562
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,653
What is that?

563
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,947
OMG, you've-you've never heard
of Time Bandits?

564
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,366
- Don't do that.
- What?

565
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:25,077
Don't say "OMG"
like it's a thing people say.

566
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,788
Okay, well, I mean,
this is why time stopped...

567
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,539
So that you can see the greatest

568
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:31,667
- motion picture about time...
- Mark, I have to go.

569
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,418
Okay, blow him off,
just this once.

570
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,003
Okay? Jared will
totally forgive you.

571
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,172
- All right, just...
- Mark, I just have to go, okay?

572
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,507
He'll immediately forgive...
You don't even...

573
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,550
I-I got it.

574
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,886
Return the map.

575
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,098
Return what you have stolen.

576
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,558
You're watching
Time Bandits again?

577
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,478
Yep, never gets old.

578
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,817
You're getting better.

579
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,403
Thanks.

580
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:02,072
So, Mark, I know it's late...

581
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:06,868
But I was hoping
we could have a talk.

582
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,330
About your future.

583
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,374
I'm so glad you brought that up,
because I've actually

584
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,292
been considering
joining the priesthood.

585
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,795
- Uh-huh. Okay.
- Or...

586
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,547
the Space Force.

587
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,050
Better yet, the Space Priests.

588
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:23,927
Space Priests?

589
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:26,805
Right. Is that... Do you have to
go to seminary school

590
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,516
- and aeronautics school for that?
- Uh-huh.

591
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,435
Uh-huh. Okay. Right.

592
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,687
Well, I wouldn't make
any snap decisions.

593
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,896
On that note...

594
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,858
Oh, my God!

595
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:39,901
So, who's Jared?

596
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,886
Just a little bit
of sniper rifle.

597
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,596
So I met this girl.

598
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,347
- Her name's Margaret...
- Wait, wait, wait. You met a girl?

599
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:10,932
Yeah.

600
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,893
- When?
- Couple days ago.

601
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,269
Dude, I saw you last night.

602
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,520
- You didn't tell me anything about a girl.
- I know.

603
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:16,938
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

604
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,273
You don't have to
make it a big deal.

605
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,733
- It is objectively big.
- Okay, so, the point...

606
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,818
- It's just, it's not adding up.
- The-the point is that

607
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,904
I never used to say
this kind of stuff before,

608
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,239
but I feel
like we have a connection.

609
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,662
I'm sorry. This is just
a continuity nightmare.

610
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:34,873
Every night, it's 6:00 p.m.,
we're hanging out,

611
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,875
and boom... she disappears.

612
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,919
Like a vampire.

613
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,879
- Actually, that's more like a reverse vampire.
- Okay.

614
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,298
Which is basically just
a regular human, I mean...

615
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,717
- O-Okay.
- Okay, then if she won't go on a date with you,

616
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,177
then just spend a day with her.

617
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,678
Did that.

618
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:50,639
Okay, then take her
on a stealth date.

619
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,391
Just you two hanging out,
no big deal,

620
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:56,394
and then bit by bit,
by imperceptible degrees,

621
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,313
things get
more and more romantic.

622
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:00,982
And then bam!

623
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,400
You kiss her.

624
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,279
I don't think that's the sound
effect that I would go for...

625
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,657
- Okay, but you got to get the kiss, though.
- I know.

626
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,200
You just have to
take her to a spot

627
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,160
that shows
that you really get her.

628
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:14,788
I mean, you do get her, right?

629
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:18,041
So, to be clear, this isn't

630
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,709
- a perfect thing?
- No, uh...

631
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,753
I thought it could be fun
to take a break.

632
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,089
Hmm. I feel a little
bait-and-switched here.

633
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,091
Gonna be fun.

634
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,261
You only live once.

635
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,805
Oh, I see what you did there.

636
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,773
You practiced that.

637
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,651
Yeah, like a million times.

638
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,945
Um, I don't have
great associations

639
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,281
with this gym,
which will not be improved

640
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,199
if some security guard
comes in here and tases us.

641
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:52,993
Oh, it's okay, I'll just
tell him it was all my idea.

642
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,328
This was your idea.

643
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,379
What?

644
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,673
BRUCE McCANDLESS II: Ah, we're
getting a picture on the TV.

645
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,843
You got a good picture, huh?

646
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,512
McCANDLESS: Uh, there's
a great deal of contrast in it,

647
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,724
and, uh, currently it's
upside down on our monitor,

648
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,310
but we can make out
a fair amount of detail.

649
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,611
Here, we got to put these on.

650
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,446
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

651
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,878
McCANDLESS:
Okay, Neil, we can see you

652
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,630
coming down the ladder now.

653
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,095
What?!

654
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,097
Okay, I just checked

655
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,433
getting back up to
that first step, Buzz.

656
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,895
It's, uh... the strut isn't
collapsed too far,

657
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,731
but it's adequate
to get back up.

658
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,233
McCANDLESS:
Roger. We copy.

659
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,651
Takes a pretty good little jump.

660
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:17,202
That's one small step
for Margaret...

661
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,329
No, don't ruin it.

662
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,377
You know the real flag
fell over?

663
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,674
It got knocked down
when they took off

664
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,259
to go back to Earth.

665
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,680
Maybe you could put it back up.

666
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,768
Space food?

667
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,862
What?

668
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,494
Come in,
come in, come in, Mark.

669
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,008
Why did you do this?

670
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,385
I-I just had some time to kill.

671
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,305
No, you didn't. Not really.

672
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:20,265
How did you do it?

673
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,475
Well, I had a lot of practice,
for one.

674
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,147
And then I-I may
or may not have bribed

675
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,816
all of the kids
in the art department.

676
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:35,196
I just, I wanted to, um...

677
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,912
Uh, you know...

678
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:44,831
What?

679
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,173
There's one more thing.

680
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,175
What?

681
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,095
We have to get back to Earth.

682
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:01,681
- How?
- With a space shuttle.

683
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:03,516
Space shuttles are suborbital;

684
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,560
they don't actually go
to the moon.

685
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:16,112
I promise,
you will not regret this.

686
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,409
No.

687
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:27,332
- I already regret this.
- I wasn't ready yet.

688
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,376
- Okay.
- Okay.

689
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,347
Oh, no, no, no!

690
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,391
Oh, my God! Ah!

691
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:47,102
15 seconds,
guidance is internal.

692
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:50,814
- 12, 11, ten, nine...
- Ah!

693
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,982
Ignition sequence start.

694
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:54,609
Well, hang on!

695
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,820
Six, five, four,

696
00:44:56,903 --> 00:45:00,490
three, two, one, zero.

697
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,618
All engines running.
Liftoff!

698
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,163
We have a liftoff,
32 minutes past the hour.

699
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:08,998
Liftoff...

700
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:30,353
And you wake up at exactly
the same time every morning,

701
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:33,064
except, you know,
if you stayed up all night,

702
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:34,649
- you'd mess it up.
- Right.

703
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,443
- You-you'd crash the system.
- You'd think.

704
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,153
- Except you can't!
- Except you can't.

705
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,029
Because something puts you
to bed at midnight

706
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:42,240
- every night, like...
- Mm-hmm.

707
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:46,286
It's like you get kidnapped by some cosmic nanny.

708
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,455
It's so creepy.

709
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,626
Is there anyone home?

710
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,921
Uh, no. My sister's
at violin practice,

711
00:45:57,005 --> 00:46:00,675
and my dad has
old-person Pilates.

712
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,722
You want a...?

713
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,476
Why not?

714
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:32,582
Are these your parents?

715
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,250
Oh, uh, yeah.

716
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:36,628
Yeah, my mom works late tonight,

717
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,631
so I basically never see her,
which is kind of

718
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,383
the hardest part about the...
this whole thing.

719
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,844
My dad recently quit his job

720
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:48,640
to write a not-that-interesting
story about the Civil War.

721
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,642
What about you?

722
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,310
What?

723
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,103
Your parents.

724
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:56,022
Old people that look like you.

725
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,524
Yeah.

726
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,359
- What do you want to do?
- It's evil!

727
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:02,153
Don't touch it!

728
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,617
So, at the end,
why is Sean Connery

729
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,244
cosplaying as a fireman?

730
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,995
- It's part of the mystery.
- Hmm.

731
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:22,799
I have to pee.

732
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,719
Because beer.

733
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:28,888
You should probably do that
in the bathroom.

734
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:30,932
Yeah.

735
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:03,631
It is completely...

736
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:05,633
hopeless. Okay.

737
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:16,185
Um, no. No, no, no. No. Uh...

738
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:17,812
- What is this?
- No.

739
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:22,358
It's a work in progress.

740
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:24,819
You made a map of everything.

741
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,280
- The whole day.
- All the perfect things.

742
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,866
But you must have just done it,
like, this morning.

743
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,118
Well, I-I draw it
pretty much every day.

744
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,411
Wow.

745
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,663
Boys are so weird.

746
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,751
It's really good.

747
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:44,255
Maybe you should go
to art school.

748
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:48,426
This is gonna sound stupid,
but I, uh...

749
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:51,471
sometimes I think
if I stare at it long enough,

750
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:55,183
I'll find something, like a...
like a pattern.

751
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,060
I never do.

752
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:58,519
That does sound pretty stupid.

753
00:48:58,603 --> 00:48:59,979
Well, okay.

754
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:02,815
And "tree house"... two words.

755
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,489
You made a map of us.

756
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,658
Too bad it's just
gonna get erased.

757
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:13,868
Yeah, it's too bad.

758
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:32,095
I can't.

759
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,184
- Oh, um, okay. Yeah, no.
- I'm sorry.

760
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,520
I should go.

761
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:42,980
Yeah, Margaret,
are you all right?

762
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,232
Why shouldn't I be all right?

763
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,442
I mean, is-is this about Jared?

764
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:48,319
- No.
- 'Cause he's not gonna call for, like,

765
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:49,570
- another four minutes.
- Oh, my God.

766
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,739
- Can you just let that go?
- I just feel like

767
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,408
there's something that you're
not telling me, and I-I just

768
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,201
- want to let you know that you can.
- Well, you're wrong.

769
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,577
Okay? So too fucking bad.

770
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:05,211
Look, Mark...

771
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:08,131
We're castaways.

772
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,508
Except instead of an island,

773
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,051
we're marooned in a day.

774
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:14,095
We're stuck here together.

775
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:16,764
So I just think that

776
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:21,477
we need to be careful
to not mess it up.

777
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:24,731
The "perfect things" thing...
That was great.

778
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,861
But maybe that's enough.

779
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,658
I just think that maybe
we should be friends.

780
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:39,078
And have fun with it.

781
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,252
I don't want to.

782
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,299
Well, that's all I got.

783
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:56,554
So take it or leave it.

784
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:04,562
Yeah, I guess I'll take it.

785
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:08,941
I'll call you tomorrow.

786
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,568
Today.

787
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,737
Tomorrow.

788
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,619
You're going to be looking

789
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,621
at the rain hitting ground
midnight tonight,

790
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,498
moving in from the coast.

791
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:08,376
Not expecting to have too much
in the way of wind, but...

792
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,294
Morning, Mark.

793
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,387
How's Mom?

794
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,058
She's... fine.

795
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,769
Good.

796
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:28,980
Loser.

797
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,857
It seemed like
she was opening up.

798
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,900
You know? Seemed happy.

799
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:35,361
Not, like, happy-happy,
but happy for Margaret.

800
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,405
That's rough, bro.

801
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,323
She sounds like
an awesome person.

802
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,535
Nah, I'm joking.
I literally have no idea

803
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,412
who you're talking about.
Oh, no!

804
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:45,830
Shotgun, shotgun.

805
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,875
- What am I doing?
- Not in the face. No!

806
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:54,297
Those are imperial elites.

807
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,382
They have four arms.

808
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:59,260
It's like bringing a shotgun
to a maser fight.

809
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,721
Well, maybe it's better
this way, you know?

810
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,931
Maybe you were gonna have
this doomed toxic romance.

811
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:05,474
Hey, maybe you dodged a bullet.

812
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:07,643
Feelings for this one you have.

813
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:09,645
- Yep.
- Mmm, I'm in love with this

814
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:11,480
- mystery girl, in love...
- Okay. Enough, enough.

815
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:13,691
- Enough.
- Of what, exactly?

816
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,902
This is the problem.
I thought maybe if I went around

817
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,904
enough times, I'd get it right,
but I guess not.

818
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:19,530
You know what,
maybe it is like pi.

819
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:22,408
It's just wake up,
rejection, repeat.

820
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,202
Is that from Edge of Tomorrow?

821
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:26,329
Yeah, it is.

822
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,374
Nice.

823
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,131
Mark? Mark, is that you?

824
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,676
Oh, hey.

825
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,429
I'm glad I caught you.

826
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:45,097
Uh, I was just...

827
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:49,727
I was just hoping we could
talk about your future.

828
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,145
Chubby Hubby?

829
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:54,815
Here's the thing, Dad.

830
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,651
I don't have a future.

831
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,236
You know, I've heard that
before from people your age,

832
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,072
and it's pessimistic.

833
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,616
And frankly,
I think it's a little glib.

834
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,701
Well, I'm a little tired of

835
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:08,454
being the only one around here
that knows what's going on.

836
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,666
Look, I know about the climate.

837
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,668
I'm... I am woke.

838
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,753
- Do not do that "okay, boomer" thing with me.
- No.

839
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,129
That's not...
that's not what I mean.

840
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:20,091
Bottom line...

841
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,093
art school is expensive,

842
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:25,513
and when you graduate,
what happens?

843
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:26,931
I'm not gonna graduate, Dad.

844
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,808
No one is graduating,

845
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,977
because time is broken.

846
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,731
Sorry, metaphorically?

847
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:37,358
You have no idea what it's like

848
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,653
to just have your future
canceled for no reason.

849
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,613
And don't lecture me
about art school

850
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:44,657
when you quit your job
to write some

851
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,367
midlife crisis vanity book.

852
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,703
I don't think that's
entirely fair, Mark.

853
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,455
Why didn't you just
dye your hair?

854
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:53,791
Or, like,
take a knife skills class?

855
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:58,629
Or-or just buy a Tesla, Dad.

856
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,923
Just buy a Tesla.

857
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:17,231
Could you please stop for a sec?

858
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,192
Just a second? Emma, Emma,
could you please stop?

859
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:22,653
- I-I am begging you, please.
- Okay.

860
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:24,363
Okay.

861
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:28,117
Thank you.

862
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,327
- So, did you talk to Dad?
- What?

863
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:33,289
He's been stalking you all day.

864
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,042
I may have yelled at him.

865
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,710
You yelled at Dad?

866
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:45,801
I may or may not have told him
to purchase a Tesla.

867
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:47,720
Is that a euphemism?

868
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,472
No.

869
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,939
It's just, when he quit
his job, I thought,

870
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:01,442
"I get this.

871
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,652
He's doing what he wants.
He's following his passion."

872
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:05,488
And then when I try and do it,

873
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,490
suddenly I'm lazy
and irresponsible.

874
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,366
He didn't quit.

875
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,996
You know Dad got fired, right?

876
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:18,167
I don't think he messed up
or anything.

877
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,462
They just didn't need him
anymore.

878
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,255
And he doesn't want
to admit that,

879
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,549
because he's in
such a shame spiral.

880
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,927
And Mom's mad at him
for losing his job,

881
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,179
but she doesn't want
to admit that

882
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:32,807
because it'd just
come across as too mean.

883
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,352
They're just stuck right now.

884
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,355
Stuck.

885
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:41,148
I don't even think
he minds you going

886
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:42,817
to that art school so much.

887
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,028
We just can't afford it now.

888
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,907
How do you know all this?

889
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,118
Psychic powers.

890
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,536
Really?

891
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,287
No.

892
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:58,082
Because I think about
other people besides myself.

893
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,126
You should try it sometime.

894
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,427
Hey, Em?

895
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:14,765
How'd your game go?

896
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,392
We lost, three to nothing.

897
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:20,771
I'm sorry.

898
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:22,857
Yeah.

899
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,400
Keep working on that.

900
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,448
- Uh, hi.
- How can I help you?

901
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:34,743
Um, I'm-I'm in
your algebra class.

902
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:36,579
I-I just had a quick question.

903
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:38,330
I don't think
I've ever seen you before.

904
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:40,082
Yeah, yeah,
I've been sick a lot.

905
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:43,210
Like, really a lot.

906
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:46,922
So, suppose, theoretically,
that something happened to time.

907
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:49,925
Like, the flow of time.

908
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,844
Like, instead of going
in a straight line,

909
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,929
like, it-it just got stuck
in a circle

910
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:56,098
and-and kept repeating
over and over.

911
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:57,808
- Wasn't there a movie...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

912
00:57:57,892 --> 00:58:00,728
What I wanted to figure out
is what could cause that.

913
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,147
I've been doing some research.

914
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,524
Could the Earth have fallen
into a wormhole?

915
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:06,984
What?

916
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:11,280
I-I mean, I don't think so.

917
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:14,283
What if it got accelerated
past the speed of light?

918
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,368
No.

919
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:17,995
Is reality just a simulation?

920
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,456
That is unlikely but possible.

921
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,540
- Ancient curse?
- No.

922
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:22,583
Cosmic nanny?

923
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,376
I don't even know
what that means.

924
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,836
Is time just a big ball

925
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,838
of wibbly-wobbly
timey-wimey stuff?

926
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:30,424
Okay, that-that's a quote
from Doctor Who.

927
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,593
I really don't remember
seeing you in my class.

928
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,136
What if we're in hell?

929
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,096
Like we did something bad

930
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,849
and now we have to live this
one day forever as punishment?

931
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:41,852
This conversation is something
how I imagine hell would be.

932
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:44,188
Maybe your spiritual advisor
would be

933
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,649
- a more appropriate person...
- What about a singularity?

934
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,735
You know, those black hole
things where physics

935
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:51,111
gets all weird?

936
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,655
Yeah, I know what
a singularity is.

937
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,032
And, I mean, sure, in theory,

938
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:58,202
a singularity could produce
a local temporal anomaly.

939
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:01,163
So we would just
have to get out of it.

940
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:04,875
Like, get on a plane...

941
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:06,877
and fly out of it.

942
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:08,879
Why not?
Now, if you'll excuse me,

943
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:11,131
I have to go do the same thing
I did yesterday

944
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:14,009
and then forget about it.

945
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:24,520
Perfect thing alert.

946
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:31,110
False alarm.

947
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,280
I'm starting to think
maybe we found them all.

948
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:38,242
Just had a theory that
when we found the last one,

949
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,327
that time would start up again.

950
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:41,829
I guess not.

951
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,539
To be honest,

952
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:46,709
I'm kind of over the whole
"perfect thing" thing.

953
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:49,378
You realize it's never
gonna be Christmas?

954
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,505
Cool. You hate Christmas.

955
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,924
Yeah, but I don't want
to not have it.

956
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:57,469
I just feel like screaming
at everyone,

957
00:59:57,553 --> 00:59:59,638
"This isn't real.
You're asleep.

958
00:59:59,722 --> 01:00:01,265
- Wake up."
- What? Whoa.

959
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,434
God, they're like zombies.

960
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,060
You're a zombie.

961
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:06,770
I'm serious, Margaret.
It's time.

962
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:08,731
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Trust me, Jason,

963
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,858
- that's more your thing.
- Do I know you?

964
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,027
- Why?
- Why? It's like you said, we're stuck here.

965
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,737
I didn't mean "stuck" stuck.

966
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,323
Everybody else is stuck.
We're free.

967
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:19,992
Free from getting older,
from going to school,

968
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,494
- from climate change, cancer.
- Okay, great. I get it.

969
01:00:22,578 --> 01:00:24,538
- Pink eye. Instagram.
- What-what about all the stuff

970
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,248
- that we don't get to do?
- Like what?

971
01:00:26,332 --> 01:00:28,250
Like grow up or...
I don't know... be an astronaut?

972
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:29,752
- Mission specialist.
- Whatever.

973
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:31,712
What about all the things that I want to be?

974
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:33,547
We're saying goodbye
to the rest of our lives.

975
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,008
We will never do anything that
takes longer than 16 hours.

976
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:38,010
I can get a lot done
in 16 hours.

977
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:39,845
Hello. You can't go in there!

978
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,847
I feel like I'm living
in an Etch A Sketch.

979
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,016
Everything I do gets undone,
everything I fix

980
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,518
just gets broken,
and everything that I make...

981
01:00:46,602 --> 01:00:49,104
- It just disappears.
- Hey.

982
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:51,440
We're thinking too small. Okay?

983
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:54,026
We haven't even snuck into a zoo
or ridden a Zamboni

984
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:55,861
or ghost-ridden
any cool new whips.

985
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:57,279
Hey.

986
01:00:57,363 --> 01:00:58,906
- Public nudity...
- Margaret.

987
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,115
- ...is always an option.
- Margaret, stop.

988
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:01,658
It is. I'm just saying.

989
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,744
- Oh, thank you.
- Margaret, you're not listening.

990
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:07,247
- What?
- Margaret! Stop.

991
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,416
This isn't working.

992
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:12,961
Is this 'cause I won't kiss you?

993
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:17,341
Why don't you just kiss
one of them?

994
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,385
'Cause I don't want to.

995
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,604
Y'all will forget
about this tomorrow.

996
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,449
- Margaret.
- Come on.

997
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:45,160
I have something
to make you feel better.

998
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:47,162
I've been saving it.

999
01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:48,914
Do people live here?

1000
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:51,834
Mm-mm. It's a show house.

1001
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,669
I guess they use it
to make people, like,

1002
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,587
want to buy one of these.

1003
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:00,717
Mark.

1004
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:02,761
It's perfect.

1005
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:09,393
Okay. Ready? Oh!

1006
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:29,746
You know, even before this,

1007
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:33,709
I always thought there was
something wrong with the world.

1008
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:37,671
Like, really broken.

1009
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,590
Not fixable.

1010
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:44,178
But nobody else saw it, so...

1011
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:47,014
I just walked around pretending
everything was fine.

1012
01:02:48,182 --> 01:02:50,726
And then what happened?

1013
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,519
Nothing. I still feel like that.

1014
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:55,772
But with you,
I don't have to pretend.

1015
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:00,569
I was talking
to my math teacher,

1016
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,780
and he said that we're

1017
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:08,577
probably just in a singularity
and if we go far enough,

1018
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,954
like, on a plane...

1019
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:13,665
...we could get out of it.

1020
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:16,376
Are you really in
that much of a hurry?

1021
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:21,423
Like, "Hooray, it's the future."

1022
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:29,431
It's marriage counseling
and global warming

1023
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:32,643
and colonoscopies and...

1024
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:35,103
student loans.

1025
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:38,941
And suddenly you're 80,

1026
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,692
and you're waiting
for your Zoloft prescription

1027
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:42,903
at a Rite Aid
in your sweatpants wondering,

1028
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,197
"Where is that creeping sense
of failure coming from?"

1029
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,992
Because it all went by so fast.

1030
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:51,995
And you never wrote that book,
you know?

1031
01:03:53,539 --> 01:03:56,583
Or kissed that girl or...
went to Paris.

1032
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,212
It's all over.

1033
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:03,882
And it wasn't even
what you wanted.

1034
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:05,842
I mean, it's not
gonna be perfect.

1035
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:08,679
It's the same stupid crap

1036
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:11,265
over and over again,
just like in here.

1037
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:14,184
Yeah, but, I mean,
you don't actually think

1038
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:16,520
that this is living, do you?

1039
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,689
We're stealing people's lives.

1040
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:22,901
My dad is-is never gonna finish
his stupid Civil War novel.

1041
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:24,695
Henry's never gonna finish
War Fight.

1042
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:27,155
And...

1043
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:31,159
My sister loses her soccer game

1044
01:04:31,243 --> 01:04:33,912
three to nothing

1045
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:35,914
every day.

1046
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:38,500
We have all the time
in the world.

1047
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:40,085
No, we don't.

1048
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:42,337
This is not time.
Time is the stuff that

1049
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:44,715
when you spend it,
you don't get it back.

1050
01:04:55,684 --> 01:04:57,311
Okay.

1051
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,859
Um... "okay"?

1052
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:11,116
Okay, there's-there's
a flight to Tokyo

1053
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:12,868
at 10:00 in the morning.

1054
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:16,204
Let's go.

1055
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,501
If this works, our parents
are gonna freak out.

1056
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:24,046
Why Tokyo?

1057
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:25,881
I actually don't think
it matters.

1058
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:28,175
Just so long as we cross
the international date line,

1059
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,427
it's automatically tomorrow.

1060
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:32,971
Though there's a vending machine
at the airport

1061
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:34,681
that sells puppies, so...

1062
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:36,683
I can't afford puppies.

1063
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,811
I spent like 30 years of
my allowance on these tickets.

1064
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,623
You nervous?
'Cause I checked...

1065
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:02,084
This flight definitely
does not crash.

1066
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,127
Don't jinx it.

1067
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:07,756
You know, if this works,
we'll technically

1068
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,174
be saving the entire world.

1069
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:14,596
My sister said that I should
think about other people more,

1070
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,599
so I feel like
saving the entire planet

1071
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:19,142
is a pretty good start.

1072
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:20,852
You didn't cure cancer, though.

1073
01:06:20,936 --> 01:06:23,063
No.

1074
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:28,360
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to call these eye muffs.

1075
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:34,366
Although, if you think about it,

1076
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:36,576
an asteroid could hit
the planet tomorrow.

1077
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,705
Like, maybe that's why
time started looping.

1078
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:41,623
Because it's the last day
before the apocalypse

1079
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,375
and really,
instead of saving the world,

1080
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:48,171
we're actually just
destroying it, which would...

1081
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:54,136
Margaret, are you okay?

1082
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:59,474
Flight attendants,
prepare doors for departure

1083
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:00,892
and cross-check.

1084
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:14,781
Sir.

1085
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:16,533
Take your seat
and fasten your seat belt.

1086
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,368
- I, uh... I...
- Please take your seat, sir.

1087
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:19,911
Sir, please, sir,

1088
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:22,247
take your seat
and fasten your seat belt.

1089
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,592
You're going to be looking

1090
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,594
at the rain hitting ground
midnight tonight,

1091
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,137
moving in from the coast.

1092
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,680
We're not expecting
to have too much...

1093
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:44,723
Morning, Mark.

1094
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,566
What?

1095
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:57,819
Thought you were gonna
call me a loser.

1096
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,363
No.

1097
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:04,743
You were thinking it, though.

1098
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:06,411
Yeah.

1099
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:13,168
Hey, Dad, how's your book going?

1100
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:20,175
It's-it's great.

1101
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,886
I mean, the scope
of the Civil War is just...

1102
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:24,512
you know, we can't even
grasp it today.

1103
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:26,598
Do you know more Americans
died at Spotsylvania

1104
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,308
than on Omaha Beach?

1105
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,812
I... do now.

1106
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:34,272
As I've mentioned,

1107
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:36,691
smallpox, tuberculosis,
diphtheria...

1108
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:38,902
The casualties
were unimaginable.

1109
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:41,571
And the thing is, the war could
have ended so much earlier,

1110
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:43,406
especially if McClellan
had just pressed through.

1111
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:44,783
After Antietam...

1112
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:46,826
Go, Emma!

1113
01:10:50,789 --> 01:10:52,707
She's not gonna make it.

1114
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,334
- Go, go, go, go!
- Go! Cover! Go!

1115
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:04,636
Goal!

1116
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:14,562
Go, Emma!

1117
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:33,289
I won!

1118
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:34,708
I won!

1119
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:12,078
And Mark again.

1120
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,039
- 72.
- That is correct.

1121
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:15,331
Ah. What's got into you?

1122
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:17,417
On fire today.

1123
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,085
Isn't that a movie where,
like, Bill Murray's

1124
01:12:19,169 --> 01:12:20,211
stuck in the same day?

1125
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:21,671
- Groundhog Day.
- Oh!

1126
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:34,976
- There he is.
- Hey.

1127
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:37,020
Good luck.

1128
01:12:42,317 --> 01:12:45,153
Oh! Go for it!

1129
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:48,281
You're gonna be okay, man.

1130
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,617
This stuff happens all the time.

1131
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,661
So, was that "Tony Hawk,"
like the bird?

1132
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,402
I'm just a phone call away.

1133
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,786
Mom.

1134
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:04,417
And just a...

1135
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,002
...little bit of sniper rifle.

1136
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:07,545
- Oh, oh, you got him on the left?
- I got him on the left.

1137
01:15:07,629 --> 01:15:10,006
- Okay.
- Okay, dude, listen. We're stuck in a time loop.

1138
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:12,926
You, me, everybody, same day's
repeating over and over again.

1139
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,428
- What?
- Like in Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow,

1140
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,222
except only me and this girl
Margaret know about it,

1141
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:18,848
and we were sort of almost
boyfriend and girlfriend,

1142
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:20,266
but not really,
and then we broke up,

1143
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:22,268
and you won't remember
any of this because your brain

1144
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:24,270
keeps getting erased.

1145
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:27,815
Wait, dude,
you had a girlfriend?

1146
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:29,275
Not really.

1147
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:31,069
Well, what's she like?

1148
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:33,738
She's amazing.

1149
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:36,950
She told me this story about
how, when she was a little kid,

1150
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,910
she was always looking for

1151
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:40,203
the fourth dimension.

1152
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:43,456
It sounds cheesy,
but when I met her,

1153
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,625
it was kind of like I found it.

1154
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,418
There was just more
to everything

1155
01:15:47,502 --> 01:15:49,796
than I'd ever seen before.

1156
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:52,548
And there was more to me, too.

1157
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:56,344
And there always had been.
I just never...

1158
01:15:56,427 --> 01:16:01,015
realized it
until Margaret showed it to me.

1159
01:16:01,099 --> 01:16:03,851
Nah, bro, she sounds amazing.

1160
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:06,771
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1161
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,443
Well, if you're all
fourth-dimensional now,

1162
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:14,237
how come she dumped you?

1163
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,614
That's the thing... I thought
everything was perfect,

1164
01:16:16,698 --> 01:16:19,867
but there was more to the story
than that.

1165
01:16:21,828 --> 01:16:26,165
I thought it was a love story
and I was the hero, but...

1166
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:28,418
wasn't about me.

1167
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,503
It wasn't my story at all.

1168
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:37,302
It was Margaret's.

1169
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:09,500
What are you thinking about?

1170
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:14,756
Just this boy.

1171
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:21,346
I messed that up.

1172
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:23,890
It's never too late.

1173
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,726
I mean, unless you're dying
of cancer,

1174
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,770
but not until then.

1175
01:17:36,361 --> 01:17:39,113
You know, even before this,

1176
01:17:39,197 --> 01:17:42,867
I always thought there was
something wrong with the world.

1177
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,827
Like, really broken.

1178
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:50,666
You know, not fixable.

1179
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,710
But nobody else could see it.

1180
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:57,423
So I just walked around
pretending everything was fine.

1181
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:37,106
Are you Henry?

1182
01:19:38,566 --> 01:19:40,526
I think I can help you.

1183
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,236
- So, you're a friend of Mark's?
- Yes!

1184
01:19:43,571 --> 01:19:45,323
Yep.

1185
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:47,200
That's funny, because
he never mentioned you.

1186
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:49,911
Where did you two meet?

1187
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:51,245
Uh, temporal anomaly.

1188
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,000
Cool. Cool.

1189
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,878
So, if we're in
a temporal anomaly,

1190
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,880
how many times have we had
this conversation?

1191
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:03,674
First time.

1192
01:20:03,758 --> 01:20:05,301
Right.

1193
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,428
Okay, so, and...

1194
01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:09,597
what are you doing here?

1195
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,517
I'm saving your ass, obviously.

1196
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,935
And the dog?

1197
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:15,186
Oh, that's not my dog.

1198
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:16,812
His name's Chewbarka.

1199
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,814
There's these posters for him
all over town.

1200
01:20:18,898 --> 01:20:21,859
I think he jumped out of a van
on the way to the vet,

1201
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:24,237
and I've been looking
for him forever.

1202
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,325
And then suddenly,
there he was, just like that.

1203
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:31,786
But it doesn't matter.

1204
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:37,416
Because tomorrow, he'll just
be lost all over again.

1205
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,670
Mark was right... everything
we fix just gets broken again.

1206
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:45,299
Okay, so, I don't understand
what you're saying...

1207
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:46,926
Wait. Did you use the shotgun?

1208
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,803
Yeah, you need the grenade
launcher attachment, though.

1209
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:50,555
- There's a grenade launcher?
- Yeah.

1210
01:20:52,557 --> 01:20:54,642
It launches grenades.

1211
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:56,602
Boom!

1212
01:21:00,106 --> 01:21:02,775
I've died so many times
doing that.

1213
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:06,153
Yeah, that's the thing.

1214
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:08,573
Death, it's so terrible.

1215
01:21:08,656 --> 01:21:11,742
So terrible to lose someone.

1216
01:21:11,826 --> 01:21:13,995
And if you don't face it,

1217
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:16,247
if you don't deal with it,
then...

1218
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,543
...you just end up
losing yourself, too.

1219
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:24,338
Are we still talking
about War Fight?

1220
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,051
Yeah.

1221
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:31,345
Yeah, you can take it from here.

1222
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,270
Oh, my God.

1223
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:42,064
It's the key.

1224
01:21:44,442 --> 01:21:46,402
Whoa, it's the map.

1225
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:50,156
I was so lost before,

1226
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,325
but it all makes sense now.

1227
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:54,535
Oh, no.

1228
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:59,415
What?

1229
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,959
It's something...

1230
01:22:02,043 --> 01:22:04,003
It's something Mark said.

1231
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:11,177
I think Mark might have been
right about something.

1232
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,553
That doesn't sound like Mark.

1233
01:22:12,637 --> 01:22:15,014
No.

1234
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,682
Sorry, I think I have to go.

1235
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:18,476
- I have to go check something.
- Wait.

1236
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:19,810
- What?
- Watch Chewbarka.

1237
01:22:22,647 --> 01:22:24,398
I love you.

1238
01:22:25,775 --> 01:22:27,693
What?

1239
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:33,658
Sometimes I feel like,
if I stare at it long enough,

1240
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:37,328
something will happen, like,
a-almost a pattern or something.

1241
01:23:45,438 --> 01:23:47,982
There's something missing.

1242
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:51,986
And it's time.

1243
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,447
Time.

1244
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,996
No way.

1245
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:55,716
There's one missing.

1246
01:25:10,064 --> 01:25:12,691
Seven...

1247
01:25:22,076 --> 01:25:24,829
7:00 at the pool.

1248
01:25:27,081 --> 01:25:29,208
Pool.

1249
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:36,298
- You're up.
- Mm.

1250
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:38,801
Are you okay?

1251
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:41,679
It's a relative term.

1252
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:48,727
I thought we'd have
so much more time.

1253
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:50,354
I know.

1254
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:53,190
But you will be all right.

1255
01:25:57,528 --> 01:25:59,488
I don't know.

1256
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:03,909
I don't know if I can do this.

1257
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:05,452
Listen to me,

1258
01:26:05,536 --> 01:26:10,958
because I'm old
and I know things.

1259
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:13,085
It's true that
we're losing time every day,

1260
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,420
all the time,

1261
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:16,213
until one day it's all gone.

1262
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:18,716
But you're gaining it, too.

1263
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,260
Every second,

1264
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:24,597
perfect moments,
one after the other,

1265
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,474
until, by the end,
you have your whole life.

1266
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,478
You have everything.

1267
01:26:31,562 --> 01:26:34,481
And it costs you everything.

1268
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,484
But it's worth it.

1269
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:43,532
I promise that it's worth it.

1270
01:26:54,043 --> 01:26:55,628
You're still here.

1271
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:37,628
The plane thing didn't work.

1272
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,634
You were right
about the map, though.

1273
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:45,344
There is a pattern.

1274
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:48,138
It's just not finished yet.

1275
01:27:48,222 --> 01:27:50,099
There's one more perfect moment.

1276
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:51,475
Right.

1277
01:27:53,102 --> 01:27:55,270
I will keep a lookout.

1278
01:27:56,647 --> 01:27:58,732
I'm serious.
I think that there's one more

1279
01:27:58,816 --> 01:28:00,192
and that's the key,

1280
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,027
and once we find it, that's it.

1281
01:28:02,111 --> 01:28:03,278
It's all over.

1282
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:06,031
Margaret, I...

1283
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:08,242
saw you go to the hospital.

1284
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:15,082
I'm...

1285
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:17,459
not gonna...

1286
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:20,045
try and take you away from her.

1287
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:22,047
I can't do that.

1288
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:35,227
Before this all happened,
I went to go see her,

1289
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:38,063
and they told me that
it was her time,

1290
01:28:38,147 --> 01:28:40,441
that it was over.

1291
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:43,277
And that night, all I could
think about was that

1292
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,446
tomorrow can't come yet;
I'm not ready.

1293
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:47,865
I'm not ready to not have a mom.

1294
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:54,079
I just wanted time to stop.

1295
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:01,795
And it worked.

1296
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:09,762
Yeah.

1297
01:29:11,472 --> 01:29:14,183
And I was so happy about it.

1298
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:17,311
I just wanted to stay
in that moment, you know?

1299
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,482
And then the really weird thing
was that you showed up,

1300
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:23,317
and I didn't know
where you came from

1301
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,569
and why it was you, and...

1302
01:29:25,652 --> 01:29:28,697
and, um, now I think I know why.

1303
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:32,159
I think it's because, you know,
when it's time to go,

1304
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:34,411
I wouldn't have to go alone.

1305
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:38,415
Okay.

1306
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:41,877
And it's time.

1307
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,380
And it's not gonna be perfect.

1308
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:47,925
You know, we're never gonna
find the fourth dimension

1309
01:29:48,008 --> 01:29:50,469
or cure cancer or fix the world.

1310
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:53,430
The point is,
is that I was wrong.

1311
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:58,602
We're the ones sleeping.

1312
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:02,022
Everyone else is awake,
and it's just us dreaming.

1313
01:30:03,315 --> 01:30:05,818
I know it's gonna hurt
really bad...

1314
01:30:07,653 --> 01:30:09,947
...but I think that
I have to wake up now.

1315
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:16,036
I think that this is the moment.

1316
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,955
Right now.

1317
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:19,998
And I don't want to miss it.

1318
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,717
That was kind of perfect.

1319
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:33,971
There was a hair in my mouth.

1320
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:39,726
Kiss me again?

1321
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:44,833
Goodbye, Mom.

1322
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:13,737
You ready?

1323
01:32:15,489 --> 01:32:17,074
I don't know.

1324
01:32:18,305 --> 01:33:18,868
