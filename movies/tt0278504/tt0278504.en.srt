2
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,890
There's just nothing down there.

3
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,360
I haven't seen a building
in, like, 20 minutes.

4
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,130
- Look at that.
- We're not on vacation, Hap.

5
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,460
Cheer up, will you?

6
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,660
Tell that to her, partner.

7
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,500
Better hang on, guys.
It's gonna get rough.

8
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,980
Detective Eckhart,
Detective Ellie Burr.

9
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,880
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

10
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,420
How are you doing?

11
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,520
"Halibut fishing capital
of the world. " Okay.

12
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,060
Detective Dormer,
it's an honor to meet you.

13
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,490
Welcome to Nightmute.
I got the car right here.

14
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,610
It's so incredible
to be working with you.

15
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,720
I've followed all of your cases:
Theodore Dineli, Frank Prud'homme...

16
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,520
...the Ocean Park shootings and
especially the Leland Street murders.

17
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,060
Is that where Ronald Langley cut you,
at 325 Leland Street?

18
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,920
You did your homework.

19
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,970
The Leland Street murders was
my case study at the academy.

20
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,570
- I'll take you to the Lodge and...
- No, take us to the station.

21
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,200
Right. We need to get started.

22
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,840
Most homicides are solved
in the first 72 hours.

23
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,810
Well, it's 48 hours.
We're a day behind.

24
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,040
But who's counting?

25
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,590
Yeah, come in.

26
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,290
They got you behind a desk, huh?
Charlie Bubbles. How you doing?

27
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,160
- I haven't seen you since when?
- Hey, Charlie.

28
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,930
- Seven years?
- Eight.

29
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,570
Seven years! I am old.
Ellie, get everyone in the bullpen.

30
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,810
- Nice kid.
- Loves the job.

31
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,890
When I called Buck for advice on this,
I never expected he'd send you up here.

32
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,920
- Something about Internal Affairs?
- They're moving in.

33
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:05,120
It's nothing. It's the usual crap.
Buck figured you could use some help...

34
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,860
They got Finn and Kentor on Narcotics.

35
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,590
The fuckers are looking
for headlines...

36
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,000
- It's gonna blow over.
- Got a message from Warfield.

37
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,770
I. A.'s pit bull.

38
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,110
He wants to be posted
on your movements.

39
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,880
You'll find us more straightforward.

40
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,040
Good guys, bad guys, but a lot
less public relations. It's simple.

41
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,080
Except for this.

42
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,730
Okay, listen up.
Detectives Dormer and Eckhart...

43
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,990
...on loan from Buck Lundgard,
L. A. Homicide.

44
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,460
They'll help with the Connell case.

45
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,700
Anything they want to see, show them.
Anyplace they want to go, take them.

46
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,370
This is Fred Duggar.
He's heading the investigation.

47
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,600
- A pleasure.
- Want to get on it?

48
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,210
- Seen what we got?
- Let's start with the body.

49
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,320
- You got the report?
- I want to see for myself.

50
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,850
Herniation of the brain stem
due to intracerebral hemorrhage.

51
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,590
- Beaten to death.
- These contusions?

52
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,260
Superficial. Most of the trauma
was to her face and neck.

53
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,970
- Any signs of rape?
- No.

54
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,600
- This one covers an older bruise.
- There's an older one here.

55
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,710
- They're both in the report.
- He washed her hair.

56
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,420
Scrubbed her nails.

57
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,890
It's all in the report.

58
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,150
- Doesn't say he clipped them.
- She could have clipped them.

59
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,860
Nope. No polish on the ends
of the nails. See?

60
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,430
She painted them herself.
Someone else cut them. Toes too.

61
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,770
- Naked when found?
- Yeah. Last seen wearing a red dress.

62
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,880
No fibers, flakes, hairs?

63
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,240
We know about forensics work here.
The body gave us nothing.

64
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,750
She gave us plenty.
All this trouble, all this care. Why?

65
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,730
- He knew her.
- He knows we can connect him to her.

66
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,870
This isn't a random psycho?
Crime of passion?

67
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:25,470
Maybe. But whatever happened,
his reaction wasn't passionate.

68
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,010
He didn't panic.
Didn't chop her up or burn her.

69
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,110
He just thought about
what we would be looking for...

70
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,440
...and then calmly removed
all those traces.

71
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,680
No haste. No rush.

72
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,020
Why clip the nails
after scrubbing them?

73
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,520
Manipulating the body.
Prolonging the moment.

74
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,790
No mutilation.

75
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,530
Not this time.

76
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,370
- You think there's been others?
- No.

77
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,300
But there's gonna be. This guy...

78
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,040
...he crossed the line
and he didn't even blink.

79
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,340
You don't come back from that.

80
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,610
Okay. Let's go find out who Kay was.

81
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,920
Fred said not to touch anything,
so I haven't tidied up.

82
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,690
She hates it when I go
into her room anyway.

83
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,760
Thank you, Mrs. Connell.

84
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,840
So she went to a party Friday night.

85
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,750
Not exactly a party. It's a local dive
where the kids hang out.

86
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,150
No diary?

87
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,810
We didn't find one.
Her mom said she has a journal.

88
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,520
Friends said she argued
with her boyfriend Friday.

89
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,590
She stormed off just after midnight.

90
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,090
She did, huh?

91
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,330
This is interesting.

92
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,540
Who is this?

93
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,120
Tanya Francke, Kay's best friend.

94
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,750
I want to talk to her.

95
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:29,020
Who is Kay Connell? Who is she?
Is she popular or is she a loner?

96
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,390
Did she like this town?
She want to bolt first chance she got?

97
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,400
Did she have dreams?

98
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,400
She knew this guy.
We know her, maybe we can know him.

99
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,730
This is designer. This is expensive.

100
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,640
- The boyfriend, Randy.
- Randy Stetz.

101
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,300
- He could afford this?
- He's in school.

102
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,710
- Mom didn't buy it.
- What are we thinking?

103
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,220
I don't know, stepfather?
Any rich uncles?

104
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,720
No.

105
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,160
An admirer.

106
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,660
Yeah.

107
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,630
- I want the boyfriend.
- I'll get him to the station.

108
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,760
I want to go to the school.
Pull him out in front of friends.

109
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,670
Catch him off guard.
It will get people talking.

110
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,840
So how far away is the school?

111
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,420
- It's 10:00, Detective Dormer.
- You bet.

112
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,910
At night.

113
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,750
So when does it get dark here?

114
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,150
It doesn't.

115
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,590
Not this time of year.

116
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,100
Yeah, I heard about that.
How come you didn't know that, Hap?

117
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,310
- Lower 48.
- Lower 48?

118
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,950
Not from here.
Can tell by your walk.

119
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,720
- How's that?
- Unsure.

120
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,810
Dormer and Eckhart.
We have a reservation.

121
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,820
Don't be fooled by my friend's
frivolous demeanor. He's all business.

122
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,730
- Your restaurant still serving?
- Kitchen's about to close.

123
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,290
We'll be quick. Thank you.

124
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,720
Thanks.

125
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,900
We got the Halibut Calabrese,
got the Halibut Olympian.

126
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,470
- Keep going.
- Halibut Cajun style.

127
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,910
I can't wait to see
what they got for dessert.

128
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,970
Natives are getting restless.

129
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,880
- We gotta talk.
- No, we don't.

130
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,320
- Just sit tight?
- Nothing's changed.

131
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,680
Nothing's changed?

132
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,590
What do you think we're doing
in the halibut capital of the world?

133
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,820
Buck figured Charlie needed help.

134
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,700
Buck figured I. A. would be coming
to me next, and he was right.

135
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,740
Warfield had me in his office
for three hours yesterday.

136
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,470
Hap, he's rattling your cage, pal.
That's all.

137
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:05,110
Me and Trish talked it through,
and I'm sorry, I gotta cut a deal.

138
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,810
- Don't say this shit to me.
- You won't be involved.

139
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,960
I'm not? Of course I will.

140
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,850
With your reputation,
he can't touch you.

141
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,760
My reputation's the whole problem.

142
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:24,100
You think Warfield gives a fuck
about you shaking down drug dealers?

143
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,730
You think that will get him
his headlines? He needs the big fish.

144
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,140
He's putting the squeeze
on you to get to me.

145
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,040
- But you're clean, Will.
- I'm a good cop, yeah.

146
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,590
But there's always something they
could use to get at your credibility.

147
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,350
Have you any idea
what this is gonna do?

148
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,820
Think about all my cases. All the cases
dependent on my word, my judgment.

149
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,590
Those fuckers on the street.
That's what you're doing.

150
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,290
They got nothing on you
because there's nothing to get.

151
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,600
Dobbs.

152
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,180
- What about Dobbs?
- That's different.

153
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,610
It's different?

154
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,580
Warfield doesn't want
Dobbs on the street.

155
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,680
It's a house of cards. Once it starts,
it's just gonna tumble. All of it.

156
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,380
That's a chance I gotta take, pal.

157
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,160
- I got family.
- Don't give me that.

158
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,290
Warfield made it clear.
I get probation.

159
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,590
We're cops, man.
This is not about us.

160
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,340
This is about all the people who
depend on us. People with families.

161
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,670
I spent my life doing this. My life.

162
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,610
You're gonna destroy it like that.
Why? Why?

163
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,480
So some I. A. prick gets closer
to being chief of police?

164
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:49,250
Or playing golf with the mayor
or whatever the fuck else he's after?

165
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,680
You finished?

166
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,250
Sorry, I gotta cut a deal.

167
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,730
So, make any decisions?

168
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,470
- You do everything around here?
- After 11, pretty much.

169
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,500
Over to you, Will.
What are you having?

170
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,150
I lost my appetite.

171
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,730
Excuse me.

172
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,410
Morning.

173
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,460
- What kind of calls you get here?
- Mostly drinking-related problems.

174
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,440
Domestic abuse, bar fights,
that sort of stuff.

175
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,270
People here come to live
the way they want to...

176
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,920
...so most people keep to themselves.

177
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,950
Chief won't let me handle anything
over a misdemeanor.

178
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,880
Don't knock misdemeanors.

179
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,250
No, but it's such small stuff.
It's so boring.

180
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,920
It's all about small stuff.
You know, small lies, small mistakes.

181
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,970
People give themselves away same
in misdemeanors as in murder cases.

182
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,730
It's just human nature.
Aren't you gonna write that down?

183
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,090
Friends making you nervous?
They think you did it?

184
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,200
You killed her?

185
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,360
- No smoking on the school premises.
- Did you love her?

186
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,810
- Randy, did you love her?
- Sure, she was nice.

187
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,110
She was nice. Wow.
That makes me all soft inside.

188
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,850
Did it occur to you
she didn't love you?

189
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,960
She loved me.

190
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,580
- Wanted me every night.
- Probably to pass the time.

191
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Girl like Kay Connell, she was looking
for more than some loser. Right?

192
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,130
What can I say? Love is blind.

193
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,070
- Live on your own?
- His grandpa's.

194
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,210
- No alibi for Friday?
- Didn't know I'd need one.

195
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,000
- At the party what'd you fight about?
- Stuff. No big deal.

196
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,440
- I heard it was a loud fight.
- I guess.

197
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,850
- I heard it was pretty rough.
- It wasn't rough.

198
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:11,080
Not like the other times.
Those times she wouldn't listen to you.

199
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,520
Couldn't keep her mouth shut.

200
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,150
- Keep fishing, man.
- We saw the bruises.

201
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,390
They said she was beaten.

202
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,730
Not those bruises. Come on.
The old bruises. Your bruises.

203
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,370
I'm sick of this.
I haven't done anything wrong.

204
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,130
You haven't?

205
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,570
Fuck you!

206
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,870
You're a prick in a leather jacket.
What the fuck do you know?

207
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,280
Randy...

208
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,460
...this whole thing you're doing,
this fuck-the-world act.

209
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,860
It might work with your mom.
It might even work with local cops...

210
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,590
...who know you enough to figure
you're too dumb to kill...

211
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,700
...without leaving witnesses
and a signed confession.

212
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,340
It ain't gonna work with me.

213
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,540
Because I know things. You understand?

214
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,410
I know you beat your girlfriend.

215
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,320
I know she was seeing somebody else.

216
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:21,620
Someone she might have gone to see
after she walked out on you Friday.

217
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,960
Now are you gonna tell us
who that somebody might be?

218
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,030
Or are you so fucking stupid...

219
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,900
...you're gonna leave yourself as the
last person to see Kay Connell alive?

220
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,780
I don't know.

221
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,740
You don't know.

222
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,310
I couldn't get her to tell me.

223
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,290
How hard did you try?

224
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,820
Pretty hard.

225
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,050
- You think he...
- No.

226
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,620
How'd it go?
Find where this is from.

227
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,760
Mrs. Connell and her
friends don't know.

228
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,550
You try the jewelry stores?
Small things, remember?

229
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,930
The second you're about to dismiss
something, think about it.

230
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,230
Look at it again.

231
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,770
Want me to write that down?

232
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,340
No, I'll remember it.

233
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,540
- Where was it?
- In a cabin on the beach.

234
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,920
- It's Kay's?
- Her books are in it.

235
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,890
- Kids found it.
- Cabin secured?

236
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,320
- Francis is headed there.
- Stop him.

237
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,730
- Tell him to stay clear.
- Rich.

238
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,420
Biology and Algebra.

239
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,160
Let's find out who she studied with,
where she bought this.

240
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,340
"Otherwise Engaged.
A J. Brody mystery. "

241
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,600
- Who reads this crap?
- I do.

242
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,510
Read it. After it's dusted.

243
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,210
Find anything that strikes you,
plot-wise, underlined passages.

244
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,950
There it is. The diary.

245
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,380
Every word.

246
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,620
That's it.

247
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,690
- I'll put it in evidence.
- No.

248
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,130
Why?

249
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,770
Call every radio station
from here to Anchorage.

250
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,370
Tell them we're looking for
the bag Kay left the party with.

251
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,980
- Get it on the air in the next hour.
- You got it.

252
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,580
Fill that bag up with books
and put it back.

253
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,220
Gonna eat this son of a bitch alive,
knowing he missed this.

254
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,920
You know something, Charlie?
Maybe this isn't such a hot idea.

255
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,160
A guy picks up a bag,
don't make him guilty.

256
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,560
Will, it's solid.

257
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,960
I don't know. This kind of thing.
Maybe we do this by the numbers.

258
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,770
- Come on.
- I. A.'s gonna be on my ass.

259
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,640
I don't want this turning up in some
court when my rep's in the shit...

260
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,840
-... and they're pulling apart my cases.
- Bullshit.

261
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,710
What the fuck you care?!

262
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,290
Someone beat a girl to death.
Your job is to find him.

263
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,090
You're a cop, not a lawyer.
Don't let I. A. cut your balls off.

264
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,960
Charlie's right, Will.

265
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,320
OP 1, this is OP 2.
We still got nothing.

266
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,520
Yeah, it's nice. Light.

267
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,990
All plastic except for the barrel.
Never rusts.

268
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,490
What do you carry down in L. A.?

269
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,790
- Smith & Wesson. 45.
- Excellent.

270
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,900
- Anything?
- No.

271
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:36,210
- Maybe he doesn't listen to the radio.
- He prefers the voices in his head.

272
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,040
Hey, Will?

273
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,130
We have somebody moving
towards the cabin.

274
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,670
Okay, fan out.
Nice and easy.

275
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,500
Shit.

276
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,740
Come on, go!

277
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,460
Police!

278
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,230
Police! Come out!

279
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,940
Fuck!

280
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,420
Down there, huh?

281
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,650
Down to the water. Spread out!

282
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,980
Go!

283
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,260
Fuck it.

284
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,500
Dormer!

285
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,620
Hold it! Who's there?

286
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,390
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

287
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,320
- Will?
- Don't talk.

288
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,620
- Will.
- Don't talk. Don't talk.

289
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,420
- Here.
- You sh...

290
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,790
You...

291
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,930
You shot...

292
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,160
I know. I couldn't see, Hap.
I couldn't see in the fog.

293
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,470
You tried to...

294
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,300
You tried to kill me? Fuck you.

295
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,340
No, listen, Hap.

296
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,470
- Listen to me now. No, no.
- Get away, get away!

297
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,180
No, I couldn't see you in the fog.
I couldn't. I...

298
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,740
I couldn't see you, Hap.

299
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,520
Don't go. Come on.

300
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,810
- Man down!
- Who's down?

301
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,220
- Man down here!
- Spread out!

302
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:51,160
Dormer! Where'd he go? Which way?

303
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,390
Dormer! Which way?

304
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,460
That way.

305
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,930
Fuck.

306
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,940
You gave chase.

307
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,050
After you left Farrell,
you heard the killer's second shot.

308
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,020
You ran down to the water.
You found Hap.

309
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,020
Will?

310
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,990
Is that what happened?

311
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,840
- Did Hap say anything?
- Damn it!

312
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,230
Why didn't I know about
the goddamn tunnel?

313
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,140
You don't move on a suspect
without knowing his exits.

314
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,280
There's a bunch of those
tunnels out there.

315
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,010
Closed years ago
when they were mines.

316
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,120
- I don't even know most of them myself.
- I had him, Charlie.

317
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,620
As close as you are now.

318
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,860
I could smell the son of a bitch.

319
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,630
- And I blew it.
- There's no point in blaming yourself.

320
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,960
- I fucked up everything.
- Don't come apart on me, understand?

321
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,130
I need you to find this bastard.

322
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,180
Yeah.

323
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:19,110
- You wanted to see me?
- You're on Eckhart's shooting.

324
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,280
But we know what happened,
and I'm on the Connell case.

325
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,980
Anchorage wants to send someone.
I told them we can do it. Can't we?

326
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,990
- Sure.
- Write it up. No Shakespeare.

327
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,160
Just enough to fry this
son of a bitch longer. Right?

328
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,110
Hello?

329
00:31:54,350 --> 00:32:00,120
Jenny, it's Will.
Can you put your mother on?

330
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,490
Hello?

331
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,000
Trish, it's Will.

332
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:12,470
What's happened?
They won't tell me anything.

333
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,130
It's Hap...

334
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,930
Is he okay?

335
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,280
No, he's gone, Trish.

336
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,910
He's dead.

337
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,380
What?

338
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,890
Trish, I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

339
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,220
What was he doing, Will?

340
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:42,660
This guy killed a girl, and, so we...

341
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,800
We had him...

342
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,500
We found him and we had him cornered.
And then he ran and...

343
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,370
Hap...

344
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,240
I'm so sorry.

345
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,070
- I'm just so sorry.
- Did he suffer?

346
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,820
- No, I don't...
- Did he say anything?

347
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,920
Well, when I found him he...

348
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,390
He was peaceful.

349
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,610
- Did you get him?
- No, no. Not yet.

350
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,940
You find him.

351
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,400
And when you do, don't arrest him.

352
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,020
You understand me, Will Dormer?

353
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,050
Don't you dare fucking arrest him!

354
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,780
- Okay, Trish.
- You understand?

355
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,290
Okay.

356
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,990
Trish, listen.

357
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,800
I'm...

358
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,510
...was shot and killed this evening...

359
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,210
...in an attempt to apprehend
a suspect in the murder...

360
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,050
...of 17-year-old
local girl, Kay Connell.

361
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:18,620
I'm sorry. It's been
on the radio for hours.

362
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,380
We're not used to this
kind of stuff up here.

363
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,730
He was standing right there.
Last night.

364
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,770
I hope I was nice to him.

365
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,040
He liked you.

366
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,940
Detective? I'm sorry to bother you,
but could you just point...

367
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,770
...to where you were
when you heard the second shot?

368
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,110
Sorry to make you do this right now.

369
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,050
That's all right.
You're doing your job.

370
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,380
Where was I?

371
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,350
- There.
- Thank you.

372
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,650
No sign of Farrell's bullet yet, huh?

373
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:12,190
No, we'll have the other
one for ballistics after...

374
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,790
...the autopsy.

375
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,490
I'm really sorry.

376
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,340
- Clean through, huh?
- Yeah.

377
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,210
Bullet got lost in the rocks, I guess.

378
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,320
Well, better luck next time.

379
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,250
You ever been shot?

380
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,390
Yeah, I have.
Kind of itches, don't it?

381
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,850
We gotta catch him.
Did you get a look at him?

382
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,160
- When?
- When I left you.

383
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,230
- You see anything?
- I was in a lot of pain...

384
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,000
...and when I heard that second shot,
I kept my goddamn head down.

385
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,760
Hey, I'm...

386
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,430
...sorry about Detective Eckhart.

387
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,840
Sorry about that megaphone.

388
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,980
- Maybe if I hadn't...
- Farrell, listen.

389
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,240
What were we doing
running around in the fog?

390
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,410
We doing it for our health?
We were chasing someone.

391
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:16,050
So anything that happened
on that beach is not your fault.

392
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,420
That's the fault of one man
and one man only.

393
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,030
And that's the man who beat
Kay Connell to death.

394
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,270
At this point, Dormer
encountered Brooks.

395
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,040
The suspect, obscured by fog,
shot Officer Brooks...

396
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,880
...in the vastus externus
of the left thigh.

397
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,920
You're Farrell.
You were shot in the leg.

398
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,250
Come on, Ellie.

399
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,480
When you get this,
get the cone.

400
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,520
- This his blood?
- Ketchup maybe.

401
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,250
Was he eating a hot dog?

402
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,100
Anything he dropped...

403
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,730
...you put in a bag.

404
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,770
Cigarette butts, gum wrappers,
coins, anything.

405
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,970
Suspect will often
leave something behind.

406
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,900
Detective Dormer...

407
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,680
...lost the suspect in the fog
then heard a shot...

408
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,520
...coming from
a northeasterly direction.

409
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,880
- He wasn't that way.
- How do you know?

410
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,090
Because I saw him.

411
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,690
- Turn this way.
- Are we almost done here?

412
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,830
My nads are freezing off.

413
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,940
Ellie! I think I found something.

414
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,340
- Should they start further over?
- No.

415
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,270
He stayed by the water
far as he could.

416
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,240
I saw him over the rocks.
He knew he'd lose us down there.

417
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,380
Duggar.

418
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,560
Where'd he find it?

419
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,050
Okay.

420
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,520
Yeah, well, just let me know.

421
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,490
Okay.

422
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,360
I will.

423
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,040
Dormer?

424
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,500
They found Farrell's bullet.
Looks like a. 38.

425
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,940
We'll get both bullets to the lab.

426
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,140
See if we can get a fix on the weapon.
If it's okay with you.

427
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,650
A guy came by.
Said he was your new partner.

428
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,720
- Did he leave a name?
- No.

429
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,690
Can I borrow this? Thank you.

430
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,190
- Pioneer Lodge.
- Warfield for Dormer.

431
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,060
John Warfield.
He's called a couple times.

432
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,430
Want me to lie?

433
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,160
No, I'll take it.

434
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,230
Thank you.

435
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,740
Dormer here.

436
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:55,410
I was shocked to hear about your
partner. I was getting to know him...

437
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,850
What do you want?

438
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,860
You know what I want,
Eckhart was gonna give it to me.

439
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,580
You got something to say, just say it.

440
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,990
- He told you about our conversation?
- Say it.

441
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:12,030
Let's just say I'm interested to see
your report on what happened.

442
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,030
Don't presume to know what happened.

443
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,870
You weren't here.
But then, you never are, are you?

444
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:23,840
You're always safe behind some desk,
reading your bullshit reports.

445
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:28,380
And that is why I have
nothing but contempt for you.

446
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,990
You and all the assholes like you...

447
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:37,390
...risk nothing, spend all day sucking
the marrow out of real cops...

448
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,550
...when you never had
the balls to be one yourself.

449
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,640
- Detective, you came yourself.
- Yeah.

450
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,510
Sign here.

451
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,220
He didn't suffer too much.

452
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,090
- What's the caliber?
- Don't know.

453
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:30,600
The gunshot victims I see are
from rifles. Wasn't one of those.

454
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,900
- Had any sleep, detective?
- Yeah.

455
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:04,930
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Sorry.

456
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,660
No problem.

457
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:15,030
- Bullet. I want results by tomorrow.
- Aye, aye, cap'n.

458
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,040
We should check Randy's
whereabouts.

459
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,010
Think it was Randy out there?

460
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,140
He still doesn't have an alibi.
You said he beat Kay.

461
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,020
- You check it out, then.
- I will.

462
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:56,210
Detective Dormer?

463
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,980
My report. I finished.

464
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:02,890
I need you to look it over
and sign it.

465
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:09,190
It's self-explanatory. I look forward
to getting back to work with you.

466
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:13,170
We have more important
things to do than paperwork.

467
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,150
A man died, Ellie. This is important.

468
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,790
Of course. I didn't mean
to imply that that wasn't...

469
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:32,010
Be sure of your facts
before you file this.

470
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,890
It's your name on the report.

471
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,360
He couldn't have come from there.

472
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,080
Dormer here.

473
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:11,920
- Hello?
- Can't sleep, Will?

474
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,060
Me neither.

475
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,420
Who's this?

476
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:20,190
I got a nap this afternoon,
but I guess you had to work.

477
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,830
Who am I speaking to?

478
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,760
Get rid of your clock yet?
Won't help.

479
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,840
When I moved here, I went
five nights. You believe that?

480
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,410
- This crazy light.
- A name or I'm gonna hang up.

481
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,380
No, you're not. You need the company.
Nothing as lonely as not sleeping.

482
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:42,450
Feels like the whole fucking planet
is deserted. Just you and me.

483
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,420
So...

484
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,820
...tell me who I'm talking to,
and we can chat a while.

485
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:50,820
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

486
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,260
- Not till you understand some things.
- Like what?

487
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,090
I saw.

488
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:02,600
- Saw what?
- Saw you shoot your partner.

489
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,540
Saw him die in your arms
on that beach.

490
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:11,480
I thought you'd blame me.
That's why I dropped my gun.

491
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:14,380
- My uncle's old. 38.
- Yeah.

492
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:18,420
- You get it? What about ballistics?
- Listen to me now.

493
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:22,080
I don't know what you think you saw.

494
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,790
We should discuss this,
don't you think? Face to face.

495
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,560
This situation isn't yours
to control. I saw you.

496
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:33,070
I'll control this situation, pal.

497
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:38,170
Because you don't hide from me
in a town this small. Get it?

498
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,070
No, not for long.

499
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,040
I need your help.
I'm not telling anyone anything.

500
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,710
We're partners on this.

501
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,800
...but to be remembered
as the Kay we knew and loved.

502
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,500
Swimming,
hiking through the Kebaughs...

503
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,480
...meeting at Darrow's after school...

504
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:37,090
...and always,
always with a smile on her face.

505
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:40,180
Detective Dormer?

506
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,950
I want to check something. I was
going over my report last night...

507
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:50,360
...and I have a question about
where that second shot came from.

508
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,660
You said you heard it
from the waterline...

509
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:57,310
...but from the way
Detective Eckhart's body fell...

510
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:02,240
...it couldn't have come from
the rocks further up from the water.

511
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:08,380
Do you think it's possible you heard
the shot before you hit the waterline?

512
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:12,480
- Detective Dormer?
- Yeah, it's possible.

513
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,810
Yeah.

514
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:22,930
Why don't I give her a ride?

515
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:27,000
- Thought I smelled something.
- How you doing? Coping?

516
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:28,830
- You're that cop.
- Yeah.

517
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,910
- Are you coming or not?
- Not.

518
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,670
Hey.

519
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,320
You want a stick of gum?
I love chewing gum.

520
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,550
It keeps me awake.

521
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:55,900
- I never met anyone from L. A. before.
- Not missing much.

522
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:59,690
- So how do you like our shithole town?
- It's not bad.

523
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,770
- Were you good friends with Kay?
- Best friends. Since grade school.

524
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:09,210
- That's a long time.
- Yeah, we were like sisters.

525
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,410
Like sisters? Must be tough
for you what happened, then.

526
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:17,580
Everyone keeps telling me
I'm doing great, considering.

527
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:20,480
But they're all real worried about me.

528
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,150
They don't even care
if I show up for school or not.

529
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:26,690
Worried I haven't cried yet.

530
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,400
But ain't no law says
you gotta cry, right?

531
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,300
No, there ain't.

532
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:39,800
What about her other friends?

533
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:45,610
Do we have to talk about
Kay right now? God.

534
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,010
I don't want to think
about all that. Just drive.

535
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,120
I understand.

536
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,880
- Want me to take you somewhere?
- As long as it's fun.

537
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,850
Young, impressionable girl...

538
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:04,860
...left alone with older Los Angeles
cop. Who knows where we might go?

539
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,500
Well, I know a place.

540
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,470
Let's just drift a while.

541
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:15,240
Look at this.

542
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:17,310
Who does he think he is?

543
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,280
What does he think he's doing?

544
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,880
- Move over.
- Let him move over.

545
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:24,380
Come on! Move over!

546
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,190
What are you doing?
Move over, you crazy fuck!

547
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,200
Just a little visit to the dump!

548
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:42,300
- You should feel at home.
- You just about killed us! Get off me!

549
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:46,000
- What is this?
- You and Kay were like sisters?

550
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:50,510
- Yes. I told you.
- Why are her pictures of you torn?

551
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:55,310
Why was her boyfriend's hands
all over your ass at her funeral?

552
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:59,010
Randy doesn't have an alibi
because he was with you.

553
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:03,080
You were out fucking
your best friend's boyfriend.

554
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:07,560
- That what best friends do?
- She never really loved Randy, okay?

555
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,530
- She didn't love him?
- No.

556
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,190
How do you figure that?
She have someone else?

557
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:17,030
- I don't know.
- Someone bought her dresses, jewelry?

558
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,970
Hey, look around.

559
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:23,580
I want to show you something.
You'll understand why I brought you.

560
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:28,680
This is the spot where your
best friend's naked body was dumped.

561
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:32,080
Wrapped up in garbage bags!

562
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,760
Tanya...

563
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:42,520
...I know you don't want anyone knowing
you betrayed your best friend.

564
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:47,160
That's why you won't give Randy
an alibi for Friday night. I know.

565
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:51,530
Tell me who Kay was seeing.
And we can forget the whole thing.

566
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:55,840
It'd be our secret. Our little secret,
but I need a name.

567
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,110
She wouldn't tell me, okay?

568
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:01,610
She wouldn't tell you?
You're her best friend.

569
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,810
- It was her big fucking secret!
- Why a secret?

570
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:08,980
I don't... Because she thought
she was special...

571
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:13,150
...and she kept saying he'd
help her get out of here.

572
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:15,190
- Who is "he"?
- I don't know.

573
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,090
- She talked about him?
- Yeah.

574
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,960
- She talked to you?
- Yeah.

575
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,600
And what did she call him?

576
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,040
- She called him something, right?
- Yes!

577
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:27,700
What? What'd she call him?

578
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:30,700
Brody.

579
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:36,210
She called him Brody. That's not
his name, so what's the difference?

580
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:41,380
Jesus! You happy now,
you fucking asshole?

581
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,920
Okay. You did good. Come on.
I'll let you drive.

582
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,510
It's just poetry.
I read it line by line.

583
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:10,080
It's nothing specific. Verses
on nature, love. That sort of stuff.

584
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,880
Detective Dormer. Line one.

585
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:16,190
- Dormer here.
- How're you holding up?

586
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:20,620
Can't be easy to keep working
after three days of no sleep.

587
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,660
And hard to keep focus.

588
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,820
Are you seeing things yet?

589
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,900
You know, those little flashes?
Tricks of light?

590
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,330
See your partner?

591
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:36,240
- I see Kay sometimes.
- What can I do for you, sir?

592
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:39,380
Why couldn't you tell
anyone you shot him?

593
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,680
I mean, it was an accident, right?

594
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:47,250
I hope so. For your sake.
You know what I'm saying?

595
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,450
No need for threats.

596
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:52,890
I'm trying to make you
understand my situation.

597
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:57,470
You thought no one would believe
you because of the trouble in L. A.

598
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:59,930
I know what that's like, Will.

599
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,330
- I got the same problem.
- You do?

600
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,870
I'm not who you think I am.

601
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,480
- You're not?
- No.

602
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:16,080
- I'm not a murderer any more than you.
- Why don't we get together?

603
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:20,350
- Talk, have a beer, whatever?
- Throw a little gas on the fire?

604
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,990
Yeah...

605
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:37,300
I gotta go check some things.
Why don't you...

606
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:40,570
...put this stuff back
into evidence and tell...

607
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,410
- What's that guy?
- Fred.

608
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:45,240
Tell him I'll see him in the morning.

609
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:48,350
Can we return this?
Her mother might like it.

610
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,540
Sure.

611
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,730
That's right.

612
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,370
Here.

613
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:51,380
This is Walter.
Leave a message, wait for the beep.

614
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:55,070
Will, you there?
Where else can you go in that state?

615
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,410
You must've been freezing.

616
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:02,250
If you want, take a shower.
There are clean towels in the bathroom.

617
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,800
This is Walter.
Leave a message, wait for the beep.

618
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,270
Will, pick up.
I'm not dumb enough to come back...

619
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,200
- Walter Finch.
- Will.

620
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:21,500
Will Dormer, what are you doing?

621
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:25,340
I try to help and you're running
around like a maniac.

622
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:28,970
Were you gonna kill me?
How would you explain that?

623
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:34,450
No one gets too upset when child
murderers are brought in feet first.

624
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:38,990
There's no evidence I killed Kay.
You know because I told you.

625
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:43,290
- Come on. What's wrong with you?
- Guess I'm a little cranky.

626
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:46,130
- Lack of sleep.
- Get some rest, will you?

627
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,330
Got some pills,
and my bed's nice and comfy.

628
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:54,370
Another night up and you'll lose it.
Hallucinating, babbling.

629
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:59,740
Tomorrow when you feel better,
we'll meet in public. We'll sort it out.

630
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,050
There's a ferry north of Nightmute.
I'll be on the 11:00.

631
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:09,190
And before you leave, could you
feed the dogs? They're on a diet.

632
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:47,760
Dormer? Fax from the lab.

633
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:50,360
Weapon was a. 38 Smith & Wesson.

634
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:56,300
- We found something that might...
- I found this. At the Connells'.

635
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,970
And?

636
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:06,550
It's the author of the book
we found in Kay's bag.

637
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,450
It's signed by the author.
He's a local.

638
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:12,780
Kay had all his books.
We should check it out.

639
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:17,780
- Small stuff, right?
- Yeah. Sure, sure.

640
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:21,560
Nice work, Ellie.
She's got sharp eyes, huh?

641
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:24,800
You bet your ass she does.

642
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,160
Good stuff.

643
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,940
What a view.

644
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:17,020
- I'm not who you think I am.
- No?

645
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,350
Walter Finch:

646
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:23,360
Lousy writer. Lonely freak.

647
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:26,020
Murderer. No?

648
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,620
When I was 7, my grandmother
took me to Portland.

649
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:34,760
We were walking along
and two guys snatched her purse.

650
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:37,800
A police officer came
to ask questions.

651
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:41,310
He stood the whole time.
Uniform looked brand-new.

652
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:46,580
Shoes, badge were polished.
It was like a soldier, only better.

653
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,480
I respect your profession.
I write about it.

654
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:54,320
I wanted to become a cop after school.
I couldn't pass all the tests.

655
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:58,360
You should've tried Internal Affairs.
They'd have taken you.

656
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:00,500
What do you want from me?

657
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:04,690
After Kay died, I knew everyone
would think I meant to do it.

658
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:09,270
So I cleaned the body, removed
all evidence connecting it to me.

659
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:12,240
Except for your fucking novel.

660
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:16,210
You don't always see
the wood for the trees.

661
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,840
You, for one, should have
figured that out by now.

662
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:33,460
When I heard they had brought
somebody from L. A., I panicked.

663
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:37,290
I knew the locals would
connect me to Kay eventually.

664
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:42,130
I could handle them. They never
look in the eyes of a killer.

665
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:45,740
Killing changes you. You know that.

666
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:47,740
It's not guilt.

667
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:50,500
I never meant to do it.

668
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:54,010
It's like awareness.

669
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:57,980
Life is so important.
How could it be so fucking fragile?

670
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:00,710
You'd see it right away,
wouldn't you?

671
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:04,950
You trying to impress me?
Because you got the wrong guy.

672
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:07,990
Killing that girl
made you feel special.

673
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,820
But you're not.

674
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:17,500
You're the same pathetic freak
I've been dealing with for 30 years.

675
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,900
Know how many of you
I caught with your pants down?

676
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:27,280
- I never touched her like that.
- You wanted to. Now you wish you had.

677
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:31,110
Best you could do is clip her nails.

678
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:36,450
Now you're so different.
You don't get it, do you?

679
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:39,420
You're my job.
You're what I'm paid to do.

680
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:44,160
You're about as mysterious to me
as a toilet is to a plumber.

681
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:49,470
Reasons for doing what you did?
Who gives a fuck?

682
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:52,160
Motivations are everything, Will.

683
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,940
What did you see through the fog?

684
01:10:56,810 --> 01:11:00,650
I saw pretty clearly, didn't I?
I saw you take aim...

685
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:03,910
- Forget it.
-... shoot your partner in the chest.

686
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:08,690
I heard him say,
"Get away from me!" Why?

687
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,360
Anything to do with
Internal Affairs investigation?

688
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:15,260
All that tension in your department?

689
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,560
- You think I'm that easy?
- I'm saying that's how it looks.

690
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,590
Maybe even how it feels.

691
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:30,610
How did it feel when you found
out it was Hap? Guilt? Relief?

692
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:36,710
Suddenly, you're free and clear. Did
you think about it before that moment?

693
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:40,780
What would it be like
if he wasn't there anymore?

694
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,290
Doesn't mean you did it on purpose.

695
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:59,000
You figure if you got something on me,
then I'll just roll over?

696
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:02,370
- Protect my reputation?
- No.

697
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:04,540
Protect your life's work.

698
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:10,580
The scumbags you put away will be back
on the street before you go on trial.

699
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:15,150
With Hap gone, you're free and clear.
Why mess with that?

700
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:21,360
Kay Connell. Remember her?

701
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,690
It's your choice.

702
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:28,730
Think of all the other Kay Connells.

703
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:33,430
Do the math. You're a pragmatist.
You have to be because of your job.

704
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:37,410
This isn't easy,
but I want you to understand...

705
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:40,210
...we're in the same situation here.

706
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:45,120
You didn't mean to kill Hap
any more than I meant to kill Kay.

707
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:50,420
But that's hard for them to believe,
so that's why we need each other.

708
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:55,620
We gotta find a patsy for the
Connell case and make it stick.

709
01:12:56,330 --> 01:13:01,100
Then you go back to Los Angeles
and I can go back to living my life.

710
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,740
So, what do you need from me?

711
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,740
What do they know about me?

712
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:19,010
They found a signed copy of one
of your books at Kay's house.

713
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:23,590
- So you'll be brought in for questioning.
- At the station?

714
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,280
That's what they usually do.

715
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:30,190
Brought in for questioning.
I can write that easily.

716
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:35,630
Calm down. It's no big thing.
It's preliminary inquiry, so...

717
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,100
...just tell the truth.

718
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:43,130
- Tell them about Randy...
- Why are you talking about Randy?

719
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:48,480
Talk about your relationship with Kay.
You can't hide it, so just say it.

720
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:52,880
Randy is none of your business.
It's not your affair.

721
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:55,820
Shouldn't I tell them
she was unhappy...

722
01:13:55,990 --> 01:14:00,430
Tell them she was unhappy,
but let them find Randy themselves.

723
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,460
That way, they'll make it stick.

724
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:05,460
Understand?

725
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,590
We need a wild card.

726
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:14,540
- A wild card?
- Yeah. Something that's there.

727
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:18,670
Something we can use.
It's in every good detective novel.

728
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:21,040
You still have the. 38?

729
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,780
No.

730
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:27,690
Really? That's a shame.

731
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:32,290
We could use that.
That'd be very convincing for them.

732
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,500
This is my stop.

733
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:47,340
Dormer!

734
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:55,340
Wild card!

735
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,580
- Night, everyone.
- Night, Francis.

736
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:05,750
Working some overtime?

737
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:09,090
- Nice.
- Cracking some big cases?

738
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,900
- Night.
- Night, guys.

739
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:01,240
This is always the worst
time of night for me.

740
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:04,820
Too late for yesterday,
too early for tomorrow.

741
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:08,980
Sorry about the tape.
I had to make sure you'd follow through.

742
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,490
I'll follow through.

743
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:14,530
I've been thinking it over.
I should tell them about Randy.

744
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:19,790
- I think that's a bad idea.
- But he's the patsy. He deserves it.

745
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:22,990
You should have heard
the shit Kay told me.

746
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:26,040
But these are cops.
They're not children.

747
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:29,200
You don't throw things
like that in their lap.

748
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:31,440
I'll push them toward Randy.

749
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,580
When the time is right.

750
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:38,120
We don't have the gun.
How will we convince them he's guilty?

751
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:40,410
Did you keep the dress?

752
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:41,980
The dress?

753
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:45,790
Kay's dress, nail clippings.
What did you do with those?

754
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,520
That's great. The dress. We could
use that. Even better than the gun.

755
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:54,290
- Where could he have taken her?
- Where'd you take her?

756
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,570
- She died in the cabin, right?
- Yeah.

757
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:00,430
Where'd you take her
to clean her up?

758
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:04,500
Don't think about that.
This is tough enough for you.

759
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,540
- It was an accident.
- Yeah.

760
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:11,740
- I didn't mean to kill her, you know.
- I know, but what happened?

761
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:17,320
She called and said that
she and Randy had had a fight.

762
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:22,820
She wanted to come over and talk,
and I said, "Meet me at our place. "

763
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,060
That's the cabin at the beach.

764
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:29,190
She comes over.
She's distraught and a little drunk.

765
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:35,040
She starts telling me about how Randy
and Tanya were carrying on.

766
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:40,340
I only wanted to comfort her.
Hold her.

767
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:47,850
I kissed her,
and got a little excited...

768
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:52,220
...and she started laughing at me.

769
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:55,890
She wouldn't stop laughing.

770
01:17:56,430 --> 01:18:01,100
Ever had someone laugh at you
when you're like that? Vulnerable.

771
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:05,100
Laughing their ass off?
Someone you thought respected you?

772
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:07,910
You ever have that happen?

773
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:12,910
I just wanted to stop her laughing.
And then, you know...

774
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:14,740
...I hit her.

775
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:19,450
Couple of times, to stop her.
Get a little respect.

776
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:23,220
Randy did it all the time.
She liked it when he did it.

777
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:26,550
She never blamed him.
Never wanted to leave him.

778
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:30,100
I do it, she starts screaming.
She wouldn't stop.

779
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:34,590
She's screaming.
I put my hand over her mouth.

780
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:39,100
Then I'm really scared.
I'm scared shitless.

781
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:43,840
More scared than I've ever been.
I'm more scared than her.

782
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:45,600
And then...

783
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,150
...everything was clear.

784
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:52,190
There was no turning back.

785
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,820
And after that, I was calm.

786
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:00,820
Real calm.

787
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:06,800
You and I share a secret.

788
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:10,730
We know how easy
it is to kill somebody.

789
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:17,070
That ultimate taboo.
It doesn't exist outside our minds.

790
01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:19,380
I didn't murder her.

791
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:24,010
I killed her,
but it just ended up that way.

792
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,390
So where'd you take the body?

793
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,720
Thanks for listening to me.

794
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:34,560
Feels good to talk about that stuff.
I'll be able to sleep now.

795
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:37,320
You wanna talk about Hap?

796
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:51,700
- Morning.
- Your phone isn't working.

797
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,640
I turned it off.
I needed to sleep. Sorry.

798
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:58,650
Fred called that author.
He was happy to cooperate.

799
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:02,550
He'll be in first thing,
so we need to get to the office.

800
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,660
I forgot to tell you they sell these
in stores in Anchorage.

801
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:10,060
- No way of finding out who bought it.
- Okay.

802
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:13,720
Bet you're looking forward
to getting back to L. A.

803
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:16,500
Back to robbery homicide, or...

804
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:18,770
...maybe not.

805
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,210
- What are you saying to me, Ellie?
- Nothing.

806
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:29,510
Are you doing okay?
You haven't been sleeping much.

807
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,150
No, I haven't. No.

808
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:40,850
A good cop can't sleep because
a piece of the puzzle's missing.

809
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:44,260
A bad cop, because his
conscience won't let him.

810
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,960
- You said that once.
- I did?

811
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:54,630
Sounds like something
I'd say, don't it?

812
01:20:56,910 --> 01:20:59,110
I'll see you back there.

813
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:06,880
In what regard were you
and her familiar?

814
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,690
- How did you know her?
- She was an avid reader of my novels.

815
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,850
When did you meet her first?

816
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:18,360
A year ago. She came
to a signing in Nightmute.

817
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:22,400
She hung around afterwards.
We chatted about my writing...

818
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:24,940
...and how she wanted to write...

819
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:31,210
...then she asked if she could visit me
and talk about books, things like that.

820
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:34,210
- And she did?
- Yeah, we became very close.

821
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,680
She got comfortable enough
to show me her writing.

822
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:40,410
- What does she write?
- Poetry, actually.

823
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:42,990
- Any good?
- No, not really.

824
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:47,050
- You tell her that?
- Why would I?

825
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:53,590
Exactly what was the nature of your
relationship to this girl, Finch?

826
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:58,430
I was someone she could talk to.
Someone outside of her everyday life.

827
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:01,870
That's why she needed me
and approached me.

828
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,270
Why'd she need you for that?

829
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:09,210
- Well, her boyfriend, Randy...
- Randy Stetz?

830
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,580
- Abusive little prick. He hit her.
- We know all this already.

831
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,020
- It was getting worse.
- So?

832
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:18,720
A lot worse. Really.

833
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:22,260
Why all this eagerness
to talk about Randy?

834
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:26,320
You're right. I'm sorry.
That's probably all hearsay.

835
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,660
I don't want anything I say
taken the wrong way.

836
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,530
Anything you say to us
at this stage is in confidence.

837
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:38,340
Secondly, we're not a bunch of hotheads
who'll draw crazy conclusions.

838
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:41,110
- Okay.
- Please, continue.

839
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:46,950
One more thing. Probably doesn't
mean much, but I think Kay was scared.

840
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:50,560
- I have myself to blame for that.
- Why is that?

841
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:55,160
Randy knew who I was.
He knew that she had a friend...

842
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:58,260
...someone she confided in.
It made him furious.

843
01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:03,200
She wrote about being scared.
Her letters were getting desperate.

844
01:23:03,370 --> 01:23:06,360
You still have these letters,
by any chance?

845
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:10,030
I probably do.
Do you think it might help?

846
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:11,870
They might.

847
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:17,350
Okay. Anything else?

848
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,890
The thing that worried her
the most was the gun.

849
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:25,390
He had this old handgun.
He showed it to her.

850
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:29,290
I don't know where he got it,
probably wasn't even his...

851
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:33,730
...but he said he'd use it if he
found out who she was seeing.

852
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:38,800
He kept it hidden in a heating vent.
You know, in the skirting boards?

853
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:44,870
It might be the. 38.

854
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:47,280
- Get me Judge Biggs.
- What?

855
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:50,250
I'm getting a search
warrant to Randy's.

856
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:54,720
- Get Judge Biggs on the phone.
- I should get over there.

857
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:56,290
- No!
- No?

858
01:23:56,460 --> 01:24:02,230
You're the guy he's talking to.
So we're waiting for the warrant. Okay?

859
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:08,770
Do you know when Randy
showed her the gun?

860
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:10,960
February?

861
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:14,200
No, probably January.

862
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:17,140
Why didn't you come
forward when she died?

863
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:22,480
- She didn't want anybody to know.
- Even when she was dead?

864
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:27,020
Beaten to death. Her body
dumped on a pile of garbage!

865
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:28,950
- I was her friend.
- No!

866
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,990
- Acquaintance. We were close...
- Close?

867
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:35,790
She was attractive.
Did you have sex with her?

868
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,860
- She was 17.
- Seventeen? She was attractive.

869
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:40,160
I suppose.

870
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:43,630
Suppose? She was.
So did you have sex with her?

871
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:47,800
- No, I was her mentor.
- You bought her things. Gifts.

872
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:50,170
- Yes.
- What kind of gifts?

873
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:55,180
- Books, mostly, that's what she loved.
- Books? What about this?

874
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:58,580
- You give her this?
- Yes.

875
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,710
Why?

876
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:03,890
- To see how she looked with it on?
- No.

877
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:06,890
- No? Why jewelry?
- It was just a present.

878
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:11,000
- Bought a lot of presents? Dresses?
- What's wrong with that?

879
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:15,000
Nothing. I'm figuring out
what kind of mentor you were.

880
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:17,570
I gave her things she couldn't have.

881
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:21,540
You wanted to fuck her, didn't you?
Sick son of a bitch!

882
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,510
- Cool off.
- Sick bastard.

883
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,950
You have to cool down. Okay?
Cool down.

884
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:32,750
All right. I need a break.

885
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:52,870
I have to apologize
on behalf of my colleague.

886
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:57,440
He's been under a lot of pressure
lately. But he's a good cop.

887
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:01,170
I'd hate to see the bad cop.

888
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:08,950
Search and seizure warrant.
Yes, sir.

889
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,180
Randy Stetz.

890
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:27,070
- We got our warrant!
- Thank you. We appreciate it.

891
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:42,180
Francis, come with me. Let's go!

892
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,330
- You're not going?
- No.

893
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:15,890
Are you not on the Connell case?

894
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,960
I'm covering the shooting
of Detective Dormer's partner.

895
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:21,490
Heard about that.

896
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:28,960
- Should I call about Kay's letters?
- Yeah. I'll pick them up.

897
01:27:52,530 --> 01:27:55,290
Stetz! We're coming in!

898
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,370
Turn the place over.

899
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:26,760
Look there! Try over there!

900
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:29,390
Rich, look here now.

901
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:38,070
I got it! Hey, Fred!

902
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:01,820
- Just in time, Dormer.
- Had it in the motor oil.

903
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:06,230
What the fuck is this?

904
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:32,680
He says he was with Tanya
when Kay was killed.

905
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:35,160
- That's what she told me.
- When?

906
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:38,920
- When I questioned her.
- Were you planning on telling us?

907
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:40,930
That's what I'm doing now.

908
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:51,180
Randy and Tanya were screwing around.
She's trying to protect him.

909
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,610
- And the gun?
- Says it isn't his.

910
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:57,340
If we get the ballistics match,
he'll be forthcoming.

911
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,610
- Leaving?
- First thing tomorrow.

912
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:03,120
If Spencer can remember
where he parked the plane.

913
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:33,050
I thought you wanted to kill me
in the interview room.

914
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:37,160
- Randy is in jail.
- Said I'd write an ending they'd like.

915
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,380
You were wrapped up in details.

916
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:42,530
- The details? He's innocent.
- No, he isn't.

917
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:45,670
He beat Kay.
One day he'd do something worse.

918
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:55,670
You knew I planted the gun?

919
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,900
You wanted to help me
before the tape recorder.

920
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,340
You had to have a wild card.

921
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:05,510
You're a good man. I know that,
even if you've forgotten it.

922
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:11,360
When were you gonna point them
at me? When you found Kay's dress?

923
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:15,690
Where I took the body?
If you have a gun and forensics...

924
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:20,320
...wouldn't matter what I said
about you killing your partner.

925
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:35,740
May I have the tape?

926
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:46,860
- Did you make any other copies?
- Why would I?

927
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,360
Stop me from turning you in.

928
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,190
Or killing you.

929
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:54,560
I don't have a hold over you.
You made choices.

930
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:58,190
Like I wasn't here. Why kill me?
It won't help Randy.

931
01:31:58,370 --> 01:32:02,900
After your scene at the department,
it won't do you good if I'm dead.

932
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:07,710
- A lot of ways a man can die.
- Like an accident? Like Hap.

933
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,250
Like Kay.

934
01:32:12,290 --> 01:32:16,150
It took you 10 minutes to beat
Kay Connell to death.

935
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:20,620
Ten fucking minutes.
You calling that an accident?

936
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:24,590
It took you a fraction of a second
to kill your partner.

937
01:32:24,770 --> 01:32:27,030
Is that more of an accident?

938
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,230
Is this an accident?

939
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,370
If you want it to be.

940
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:53,850
It's over, Walt.

941
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:59,520
It's over. I'm telling them everything.
Tell them about Hap, you, everything.

942
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,730
- What good would that do?
- It'll end this thing.

943
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:06,500
It won't end it.
You're not thinking straight.

944
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:11,240
Will you tell the truth? You shot
your partner and lied about it.

945
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:16,140
To them, you're a liar and a killer.
You're tainted. Forever!

946
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:21,810
You don't get to pick when you tell
the truth. The truth is beyond that.

947
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:28,060
That tape was the only proof we had
a conversation outside of that room.

948
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:31,860
To them, I'm a writer
that Kay admired.

949
01:33:32,030 --> 01:33:36,700
Randy is the killer, and you're a
hero cop. Your life's work is intact.

950
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:41,840
Another abusive scumbag is in jail.
Everything is as it should be.

951
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:46,740
Go back to Los Angeles.
The case against Randy is pretty solid.

952
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:52,610
I can take care of everything here.
I got it worked out. Go home.

953
01:33:57,690 --> 01:34:01,790
Midnight of your sixth night.
You broke my record, Will.

954
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:44,470
- Randy Stetz. He was an asshole.
- You knew him as a kid?

955
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:48,130
- Dads were on the same boat.
- Bad seed.

956
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:50,600
How do you like our beer?

957
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,980
What Dormer needs
is a little shuteye.

958
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:02,180
- White nights getting to you?
- Hasn't been easy.

959
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,760
- Better than winter.
- Got that right.

960
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:10,060
- Sun barely comes up for five months.
- Like being sucked into a black hole.

961
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:16,000
- Hey, Nancy Drew. You hear? We got him.
- Rich found the gun.

962
01:35:17,770 --> 01:35:21,260
- Something's on her mind.
- I found this on the beach.

963
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,640
- What is it?
- Shell casing, 9mm.

964
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:29,340
The murder weapon was a. 38.
None of us carries a 9mm.

965
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,510
Or backup weapon, right?

966
01:35:33,190 --> 01:35:35,420
Get a hobby, would you?

967
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:39,020
It's a legitimate point,
isn't it, detective?

968
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:48,970
This case is closed, Ellie. Hold the
fort, boys. I'll go find a men's room.

969
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:53,400
Relieve myself of your
fine Alaskan beer.

970
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:55,800
Do you want a beer or something?

971
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,070
No, thanks.

972
01:35:58,510 --> 01:36:02,850
- He's good people, right?
- Don't get carried away.

973
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:06,610
What has two thumbs
and loves blowjobs?

974
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:09,120
- I don't know.
- This guy.

975
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:21,230
It's been something, Dormer.

976
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:25,160
It's been really great
working with you.

977
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,910
- Run Will to the airport?
- I gotta pick up the letters.

978
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,210
In Umkumiut...

979
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:38,910
At his lake house. Dormer will
have to leave my car at the dock.

980
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:42,720
- If that's okay with you?
- Yeah, it's fine.

981
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:51,090
It's been a pleasure.

982
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:52,890
Get some sleep.

983
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:17,940
Detective Dormer.

984
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:20,240
What is it?

985
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:24,450
Someone's complaining about the noise.
Says he can't sleep.

986
01:38:25,190 --> 01:38:27,060
Something wrong?

987
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,830
It's so fucking bright in here.

988
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:36,390
No, it's dark in here.

989
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:42,930
Will you please...?

990
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:03,020
There's this guy, Wayne Dobbs, 24.
Works part time at a copy store.

991
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:07,030
Every day he watches
this 8-year-old boy...

992
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:10,600
...waiting for his carpool
across the street.

993
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:15,170
- This is one of your cases?
- Yeah. Hap and me.

994
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:16,830
A year and a half ago.

995
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:19,670
For six months, he watches this kid.

996
01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:22,310
Finally gets up the nerve.

997
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:26,110
He goes down, grabs that boy
before the carpool comes...

998
01:39:26,290 --> 01:39:29,380
...takes him back to his apartment...

999
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:33,420
...and keeps him there for three days.

1000
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:36,790
He tortures him...

1001
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,230
...and makes him do things.

1002
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:45,630
And, finally, he's had enough.
He gets a rope.

1003
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:50,540
He hangs the boy in a storage space
in the basement of the building.

1004
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:53,080
But he didn't do it right.

1005
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:59,010
Little boy's neck didn't break,
so he dangled there for a while...

1006
01:39:59,190 --> 01:40:02,160
...and then died finally
from the shock.

1007
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:06,220
Landlord found the body
five days later.

1008
01:40:06,730 --> 01:40:10,360
The second I met this guy, Dobbs,
I knew he was guilty.

1009
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:14,090
That's what I do. That's my job.
I assign guilt.

1010
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:16,200
You find the evidence...

1011
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:21,640
...figure out who did it, and then
you go get them and put them away.

1012
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:29,610
This time there wasn't enough evidence.
And it's reasonable doubt to a jury...

1013
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:34,220
...because a jury never
met a child murderer before.

1014
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:35,580
But I have.

1015
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,080
Anyway...

1016
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:47,430
I went and took some blood samples
from the boy's dead body...

1017
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:51,490
...and I planted them...

1018
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,900
...in Dobbs' apartment.

1019
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:04,170
I could feel it there.

1020
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:07,840
This is gonna catch up with me.

1021
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:12,980
- I don't do things like that.
- So how did it catch up with you?

1022
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:16,620
Internal Affairs is coming down
on our department.

1023
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:21,290
Hap, he was gonna cut a deal...

1024
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:24,870
...and bring me straight into it.

1025
01:41:25,110 --> 01:41:28,700
They would've reopened Dobbs' case,
he would've walked.

1026
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,210
Now that won't happen.
And I don't know...

1027
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:35,310
...how I feel about that.

1028
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:40,780
But Dobbs was guilty.
Dobbs needed to be convicted.

1029
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:45,290
So the end justifies the means.

1030
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:48,320
Right?

1031
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:55,430
- I'm in no position to judge.
- Why not?

1032
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:58,530
Two kinds of people live in Alaska.

1033
01:41:58,710 --> 01:42:04,010
The ones who are born here, and the
ones who come here to escape something.

1034
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,510
I wasn't born here.

1035
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:10,110
Why don't you tell me what you think?

1036
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:14,820
Here. Now. In this room. You and me.

1037
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:16,920
Please.

1038
01:42:20,990 --> 01:42:24,760
I guess it's about what you
thought was right at the time.

1039
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:29,600
Then, what you're willing to live with.

1040
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:13,210
- Nightmute Police Department.
- Detective Burr.

1041
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:17,610
She's not here. She left town
about 20 minutes ago to go pick up...

1042
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,970
- Mr. Finch.
- Detective Burr.

1043
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:47,040
- Are they friendly?
- Yeah.

1044
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:52,410
Didn't expect to see you this soon.
Sorry about the mess, doing some work.

1045
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:09,360
Could Kay's letters strengthen
the case against Randy?

1046
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:10,720
Possibly.

1047
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,190
Watch your head.
I've done it 1000 times.

1048
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:56,270
Sorry about all the clutter.
I am a pack-rat.

1049
01:45:57,610 --> 01:45:59,600
I keep everything.

1050
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:02,810
I got them. Just don't know where.

1051
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:08,740
- They've gotta be here somewhere.
- Working on a new book?

1052
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:11,720
- Have you read any of my books?
- I haven't.

1053
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:55,500
- She knows, Will.
- Where is she?

1054
01:46:55,670 --> 01:47:00,540
She knows you killed Hap. You would've
realized if you weren't strung out.

1055
01:47:00,710 --> 01:47:03,470
- The way she looks at you...
- Where is she?

1056
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:07,040
- It's under control.
- If anything happened to her...

1057
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:08,200
She's okay.

1058
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:13,610
If she talks, you're fucked. Everything
you've worked for is destroyed.

1059
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,820
- Now give me...
- Show me where she is. Now.

1060
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:23,220
She's okay.
Listen. I mean, it's all fine.

1061
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:28,990
Let's search this place.
For the dress.

1062
01:47:29,170 --> 01:47:31,070
- What dress?
- Ellie's...

1063
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,340
- Kay's!
- You're rambling.

1064
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:34,560
Ellie's here.

1065
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:36,730
- I'm taking care of us.
- Us?

1066
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:38,740
- She saw the dress.
- Us?

1067
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:41,540
Where'd you get us?
Don't talk about us.

1068
01:47:41,710 --> 01:47:43,580
She's alive, Will. Ellie!

1069
01:48:14,410 --> 01:48:15,750
Hold it!

1070
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:19,010
Don't move!

1071
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:22,120
You shot Detective Eckhart.

1072
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:26,720
And Finch saw you do it.

1073
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,860
Did you mean to shoot Hap?

1074
01:48:33,970 --> 01:48:36,300
I don't know anymore.

1075
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:39,870
I don't know.

1076
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:47,980
I couldn't see him through the fog,
but when I got up close...

1077
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:51,550
...he was afraid of me...

1078
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:56,610
...and he thought I meant to do it,
so maybe I did.

1079
01:49:00,130 --> 01:49:02,620
I just don't know anymore.

1080
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:20,680
- Where's your gun?
- He took it.

1081
01:49:25,650 --> 01:49:27,450
Keep your head down.

1082
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:32,750
I got seven rounds in this clip.
Make it last. Head down.

1083
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:39,160
Okay, go! Go!

1084
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:37,190
You forgot the wild card.

1085
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:54,190
Detective Dormer!

1086
01:51:57,140 --> 01:52:02,630
I called for backup. They'll be
here soon. Dormer, just hold on.

1087
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:05,180
Hold on.

1088
01:52:13,190 --> 01:52:15,920
Nobody needs to know.

1089
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:23,450
You didn't mean to do it.
I know that even if you don't.

1090
01:52:23,630 --> 01:52:25,890
No, don't. Don't.

1091
01:52:26,070 --> 01:52:27,900
What?

1092
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:30,730
Why?

1093
01:52:32,810 --> 01:52:35,370
Don't lose your way.

1094
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:42,980
Hang on.

1095
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:46,520
Dormer.

1096
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:49,550
Let me sleep.

1097
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:51,660
No.

1098
01:52:52,660 --> 01:52:55,590
Just let me sleep.

1099
01:52:56,305 --> 01:53:56,280
