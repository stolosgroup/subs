with seasonal temperatures,

00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:01,968
we should reach our normal
high over this afternoon.

00:02:02,044 --> 00:02:03,886
Clear skies tonight.

7
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:06,955
Increasing cloudiness
tomorrow, sticky and humid.

8
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,044
Hey. Hey! Come give me a kiss. Be good.

9
00:02:23,047 --> 00:02:24,639
- Bye.
- Bye!

10
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:26,797
Have fun!

11
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:37,403
Cleve, it's 1955.

12
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,837
Please re-enter the clubhouse in a
more stereotypically animated fashion.

13
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:09,713
Hey. Man. You know where
I could find Frank Barnes?

14
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:10,998
- Sir?
- Frank Barnes.

15
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,033
Good luck.

16
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:17,231
Thanks.

17
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:27,119
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Frank Barnes.

18
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:28,960
You found him.

19
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:30,082
I'm Will Colson.

20
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,758
We're working together
today on train 1206.

21
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,357
1206.
That's the one.

22
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:37,361
That's the profile?
Yeah. Want to take a look?

23
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:40,756
How you doing?

24
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:48,083
Is there a problem?

25
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:50,039
No problem.

26
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:52,677
I just don't like working
in a damn day-care center.

27
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:56,359
Yeah. Well. I don't like working
at a retirement home. So...

28
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:58,354
All right.
I'll tell you what.

29
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,521
I'm going to finish my coffee.
I'll meet you on the wagon.

30
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:02,075
Sounds good.

31
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:04,396
1206.
Yeah. That's the one.

32
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:08,673
You know that punk's
union. Right?

33
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:11,071
Heard they just made him
a shop steward at the UTU.

34
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,595
First year?

35
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:15,118
You know how he got
hired? His name's Colson.

36
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,112
His two uncles are running
things over at Thornwood

37
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,683
and his brother's
lead welder at Deacon.

38
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,486
The whole family's
from Stanton.

39
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:23,202
That figures.

40
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,111
Here. They're shit-canning
guys every day.

41
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:27,326
But you got the right last
name and a rookie's pay grade.

42
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:30,433
You got a job.

43
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,685
What the hell are these guys?

44
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:44,042
Dewey. Gilleece.

45
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:45,960
Sorry to break up
charm school,

46
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:49,604
but what the hell is that
beast still doing on D-16?

47
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:51,560
I told you I need
that track clear.

48
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:54,485
Relax. Buddy. We were
just about to move it.

49
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:55,838
Like hell you are.

50
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:59,319
I've got 150 school students coming
in on some field trip on D-16.

51
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:00,805
I need that track cleared.

52
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,522
D-10's clear.
You can set it there.

53
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:09,676
All right. All right.
Settle down. Settle down.

54
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:12,956
Welcome to the
Railroad Safety Campaign.

55
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:14,471
We're a not-for-profit program

56
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:18,077
designed to educate young people
like yourselves about railway safety.

57
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:19,880
Hey. Settle down.

58
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,319
Show of hands.

59
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:22,949
Who's ridden a train before?

60
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:24,272
Me!
Me!

61
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:26,958
All right! All aboard!

62
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:32,635
So what's our day?

63
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:35,637
They got us going
on light power.

64
00:05:35,723 --> 00:05:37,958
We're supposed to pick up
25 cars just past Stanton

65
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:39,713
then it's pretty much a
straight shot through Wilkins.

66
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,391
Any slow orders?

67
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,242
No.
You sure?

68
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,589
They'd be highlighted in red.

69
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:49,159
No. No slow orders.

70
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:51,230
All right.

71
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:59,353
Dewey, what
the hell is taking you so long?

72
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,712
It's a 39-car consist.
Bunny.

73
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:04,043
The thing's half a mile long.
For Christ's sake.

74
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:09,432
Gilleece. Channel up.

75
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:12,434
Go for Gilleece.

76
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:13,921
You believe this shit?

77
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,840
Hey. Hold up. You forgot to
tie the air in from the point.

78
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:20,519
Yeah. So?

79
00:06:20,643 --> 00:06:23,003
So. You don't
have any air brakes.

80
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,508
You can tie the hoses
once we got her parked

81
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:26,148
and Bunny's quit
his bitching.

82
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:27,280
Okay.

83
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,198
I only got one rule.

84
00:06:40,284 --> 00:06:41,713
One rule only.

85
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,228
You going to do something.
You do it right.

86
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:44,993
You don't know how to
do it. Ask me. All right?

87
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,553
Likewise. If you need anything
from me. You better speak up

88
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,913
'cause you're
the conductor.

89
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,552
Once we get our freight.
It's your train.

90
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,394
I'm just the guy
driving it.

91
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,398
How long you been
out of training?

92
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,750
About four months.

93
00:06:56,837 --> 00:06:58,630
Four months? Wow.
Yeah.

94
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,392
Full-on yellow vest rookie.

95
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:02,955
How long you
been railroading?

96
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:06,791
Twenty-eight years.
November 13. 1981. 28 years.

97
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:08,470
What did you do
before that?

98
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:11,347
Oh. I don't know.
A bunch of different jobs.

99
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:13,437
Yeah? No railroading?
No.

100
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:16,429
Just looking to do
something different.

101
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:19,230
Something different?

102
00:07:19,326 --> 00:07:20,678
What do you mean.
Something better?

103
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:22,874
No. Just...

104
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,435
Different.
Just different.

105
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,068
Hey. Dewey. Want to pick
it up a little bit. Jag off?

106
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:35,552
I want to have
lunch at some point.

107
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:01,311
- Yeah.
- Hey.

108
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:04,198
Your lawyer just called.
You got a break.

109
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,356
The hearing's been
moved up to this morning.

110
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,514
Looks like
you'll be going home.

111
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,555
Well. That's great.
But...

112
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:17,068
Did you tell him
I was working?

113
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,152
I can't come in.

114
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:20,597
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
He said no problem. Man.

115
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:22,554
It's looking good.
All right.

116
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:27,032
Call him in an hour or two.
See where it's at.

117
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,308
I will.
And then give me a call.

118
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:31,434
We ready to
pull out or what?

119
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:33,630
Coming.

120
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:35,711
All right.

121
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:37,553
Train is leaving.

122
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:45,752
What's our
fuel gauge reading?

123
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:48,188
Fuel gauge.
2.900.

124
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:49,387
2.900!

125
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:52,705
Angle-cock's closed.
Hand brake's knocked off.

126
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:53,865
Good. Good. Good.

127
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:55,630
Got all the updated division
notices and bulletin orders.

128
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:56,752
The POS releases are in.

129
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:58,593
Filled out our time slips.
We're good to go.

130
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,511
Good. All right.

131
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:18,915
You're at 29 cars. You
got 10 to go. You're good.

132
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,703
Dewey, you got 29.
Ten more makes...

133
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,319
You taking PB-9
over to D-10?

134
00:09:29,915 --> 00:09:31,229
Dewey.

135
00:09:31,401 --> 00:09:32,706
Dewey.

136
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:34,269
Hold your horses.

137
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,309
What's wrong?

138
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,433
Damn trailing point switch.
The track's aligned for D-16.

139
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,591
What's your
stopping distance?

140
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:45,863
At least 20 cars
to a stop. Damn it!

141
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,868
Okay. So we back it up
and lose a little time.

142
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:51,838
I'm hopping out.

143
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,392
Do not get out
of that cab. Man!

144
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:55,789
Don't worry.
I'll set the independent.

145
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:58,474
Dewey! Dewey!

146
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,825
Come on,
get back on.

147
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:09,791
Dewey!
You better get back on!

148
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,795
I'm on it. I'm on it.

149
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,227
Shit!

150
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:40,547
You better get
back on. Dickhead.

151
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,499
Hey!

152
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,706
Shit!

153
00:10:56,831 --> 00:10:58,355
Nice job. Dewey!

154
00:11:14,793 --> 00:11:16,347
God damn it!

155
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:18,984
So now what the hell
do we do?

156
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:39,747
Shoot.

157
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:53,624
Ooh. You're in trouble.

158
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:56,990
Just don't talk about it. Just put
your sister on the phone. Sweetheart.

159
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:00,193
Dad.

160
00:12:01,238 --> 00:12:02,590
She doesn't want
to talk to you.

161
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:06,426
Listen. Just tell her I was...
I didn't forget. I was just...

162
00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:08,469
I was running late.

163
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,550
She's got a date tonight.

164
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:12,871
With who?

165
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:15,432
Just put your
sister on the phone.

166
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:17,311
Wait. Here she is.

167
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:24,945
Nic?

168
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:27,180
Nicky?

169
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:29,146
Hello?

170
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:30,824
Listen. Just...

171
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,627
Baby, look, I didn't forget. I was...

172
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,138
Frank. The stop blocks
are up. Is there a problem?

173
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:56,660
No. There's no problem.
Except you got it backwards.

174
00:12:57,513 --> 00:13:00,745
Turntable house goes on my
end. You're on the ballast.

175
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:02,184
On my end.

176
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,310
Other than that, no problem.
No problem at all.

177
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:17,307
Like I told you.

178
00:13:17,394 --> 00:13:19,388
If you don't know something.
Just ask. That's all.

179
00:13:20,348 --> 00:13:21,700
I got it.

180
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:23,579
I hope so.

181
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:27,300
Whatever.

182
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:29,266
Excuse me?

183
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:33,189
This shit. This "Let's make the
new guy prove himself" bullshit.

184
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:37,217
I got to tell you. I've heard it
before and it gets old real fast.

185
00:13:37,313 --> 00:13:39,547
Well. That's how it is
at the retirement home.

186
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:46,020
Company wants to get
rid of us old heads.

187
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:49,991
They give all the jobs to you
new guys. You yellow vests.

188
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:52,312
I'm not trying to take
anything from anybody.

189
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:54,297
As reassuring as that is.

190
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:57,624
A lot of guys
don't see it that way.

191
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,271
I'm here.
I'm walking in right now.

192
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:24,822
I got a car full of donuts
for those kids.

193
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,747
A coaster? What train?

194
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:29,780
How the hell
did this happen?

195
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:30,950
It just got away from me.

196
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:32,907
It got away from you?

197
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:34,786
It's a train. Dewey.
Not a chipmunk.

198
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:37,261
I had to leave the cab
to throw a switch.

199
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:38,987
- You left the cab?
- Yeah.

200
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:40,349
And it gets worse.

201
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,338
The air brakes weren't tied
on. They aren't tied on. Still.

202
00:14:45,105 --> 00:14:48,577
We've got an unmanned train
rolling into opposing traffic

203
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:50,303
with no air brakes. Is
that what you're telling me?

204
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,269
I set the independent brakes.
That will for sure stop it.

205
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:53,535
How fast is it going?

206
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:54,897
No more than 10 miles per.

207
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:56,499
Okay. Jump on the
hi-rail and go after it.

208
00:14:57,793 --> 00:14:58,829
Now!

209
00:14:58,906 --> 00:14:59,855
Okay. Ballbuster.

210
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:09,867
Call the field trip!

211
00:15:09,954 --> 00:15:11,306
I don't care where
they are on the main line.

212
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:12,428
They need to get
into the nearest siding.

213
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:16,178
RS Campaign. RS Campaign. This
is Fuller Yard. Do you copy?

214
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,373
RSC answering dispatch.
How can I help you? Over.

215
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,099
RS Campaign.
This is Fuller Yard.

216
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:26,017
We've got unauthorized
activity on your track.

217
00:15:26,113 --> 00:15:28,376
We're going to need you to divert
to a siding at Portville.

218
00:15:30,592 --> 00:15:31,982
Dispatch. Please repeat.

219
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:34,581
Please repeat. Over.

220
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:37,065
What time is train time?

221
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:38,580
Anytime!

222
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:41,582
Divert to a siding
in Portville. Do you copy?

223
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:43,941
I copy. I'll divert into the
siding at Portville. Over.

224
00:15:49,945 --> 00:15:52,332
Get me 777's
cargo information.

225
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:53,944
I have to call corporate
and report this.

226
00:15:55,027 --> 00:15:57,818
Now. Dewey said
he applied the independent.

227
00:15:57,904 --> 00:16:00,705
So friction should stop the
damn thing after a few miles.

228
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,054
Still. We need to alert every
northbound train on the mainline.

229
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,059
First 20 miles of
track take priority.

230
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,333
I don't care if
you're talking about

231
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,213
a spot weld on
a Class 3 rip track

232
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:15,704
or ground operations in Afghanistan.
It's all about precision.

233
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,778
- Right.
- Thank you.

234
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:19,540
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

235
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,055
Hello.

236
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:22,532
Ned. Where are you?

237
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,582
Oh. Connie.
I'm just driving in now.

238
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:26,857
I got to go.

239
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:28,497
How far are you
from milepost 5?

240
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,943
Roughly six minutes.
Traffic contingent.

241
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:32,784
Great. I need you to
haul ass over there

242
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,577
and throw the siding switch.
We got a coaster.

243
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:36,064
A coaster? Really?

244
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,653
Yeah. It should roll past
MP 5 in about 15 minutes.

245
00:16:38,787 --> 00:16:40,264
That should give you enough
time to throw the switch.

246
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,853
Get it off the mainline
and onto that siding.

247
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:44,618
You want me to climb
onboard and stop it?

248
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:47,984
What? No. Two hostlers are on the
way. Just throw the switch. Ned.

249
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:49,538
Roger that.

250
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:51,983
You can always
count on him to be late.

251
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:53,940
I'll see you later.

252
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:55,177
See you!

253
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:57,536
Yeah, I can get
you where you need to go

254
00:16:57,622 --> 00:16:58,735
'Cause I'm a country boy

255
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:10,579
What do we do when we
get to a railroad crossing?

256
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:13,101
Stop. Look and listen!

257
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:14,415
I can't hear you!

258
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,774
Stop. Look and listen!

259
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:39,694
You from Stanton?

260
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,102
Born and raised.
Yeah?

261
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:45,420
My whole family's
from Stanton.

262
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:48,537
Married?

263
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,416
Yeah.

264
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:53,974
Well. Sort of.
It's a long story.

265
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,298
We got a long day.

266
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,296
How about you?
You married?

267
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,454
Short story. Once.

268
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:08,858
Got two beautiful daughters.
Though. 18. 19.

269
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,416
They are both waitressing. Trying
to work their way through college.

270
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:13,903
- Oh. Yeah?
- Yeah.

271
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:15,773
- Where at?
- Hooters.

272
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:21,335
- Hooters. You know?
- All right.

273
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,819
That's right. Hooters.
Wipe that grin off your face.

274
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,092
- I'm a fan.
- Yeah.

275
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,137
You're blushing.

276
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:32,939
I'm used to it.

277
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:35,538
I'm used to it.

278
00:18:42,424 --> 00:18:44,495
Connie. Corporate on line 2.

279
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:48,053
This is Connie Hooper
at Fuller Yard.

280
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,652
I'll hold.

281
00:18:53,347 --> 00:18:54,737
Did I hear right?
You've got a coaster?

282
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,094
Yeah. This sort of thing
happens. We're on it.

283
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,974
Won't it trip a relay?

284
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:03,532
Listen. I need to speak
to Mr. Galvin directly.

285
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:07,809
I see. Can you have him call me. Then?

286
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:10,302
No. I'm about to review
the cargo shipment myself.

287
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:14,340
Who the hell are you?

288
00:19:14,426 --> 00:19:16,056
I'm here for the
Railroad Safety Campaign.

289
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:19,614
Scott Werner. FRA Region 2.
Federal Safety Inspector.

290
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,178
I'm supposed to give a
presentation to the children.

291
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:23,815
Go over some basic stuff.
That's great. Hey. Bunny? Bunny!

292
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:24,975
Can you help me out here?

293
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:26,491
Okay. See this
guy right there?

294
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:27,574
He's going to tell
you where to sit.

295
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:28,610
Track geometry.
Alignment...

296
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:29,694
Thank you so much.
I brought some gages...

297
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,775
The kids are going to
love that. It's great.

298
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:52,816
God damn it. Where
the hell is this thing?

299
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:03,729
Bunny? I need to know exactly
what's in cars 7 to 10.

300
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:05,177
Get a hold of
the shipper. Please.

301
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:14,413
Are you kidding me?

302
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,296
Where's the train?

303
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:23,897
Where does it look like
the goddamn train is?

304
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,422
It's not here! What
are you doing out here?

305
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:27,532
Do I look like I got a train
hidden in my back pocket?

306
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:28,731
Bunny. Get me Connie.
It's Ned.

307
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:30,016
Get behind us. Jackass.

308
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:31,646
Did you get here too late?
Don't give me that shit.

309
00:20:31,742 --> 00:20:33,861
You two numbnuts
are always screwing up.

310
00:20:33,938 --> 00:20:36,729
You switched the track that was supposed
to get the train on the right track.

311
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:38,014
Connie. Yeah. It's Ned.

312
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:39,328
Did you throw
that switch yet?

313
00:20:39,424 --> 00:20:41,812
Yeah. Six minutes ago. But
your train. It's not here.

314
00:20:41,898 --> 00:20:43,931
I thought it might be going a
little slower than you guessed,

315
00:20:44,017 --> 00:20:45,533
but these two numbnuts
that you sent.

316
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,808
They just showed up and
they haven't seen it. Either.

317
00:20:46,904 --> 00:20:48,496
Are you saying our
train has already passed?

318
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,098
Yes. Ma'am.
That would be my guess.

319
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,610
It's not a coaster.
That train is under power.

320
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:53,809
That would be my guess. Too.

321
00:20:55,017 --> 00:20:56,446
- Put Dewey on the phone.
- Sure.

322
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:57,894
She wants to talk
to you. Asshole.

323
00:20:58,019 --> 00:20:59,333
Yeah.

324
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:01,615
I need you to rally every
cell in that brain of yours.

325
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:02,853
When you applied
the independent.

326
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:05,058
Was the throttle in
the forward position?

327
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:06,813
Yeah. I had to
get it moving!

328
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,211
In what position
was the throttle set?

329
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,165
Damn it. Dewey.
What position?

330
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:17,056
Connie. The throttle
was in notch 8. Full power.

331
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,213
Okay? It was 39 cars!

332
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:25,370
Okay.

333
00:21:25,457 --> 00:21:27,653
Take the southbound track.
Catch up.

334
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:30,252
See if it's still going slow
enough for one of you to climb on.

335
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:34,337
You have got until milepost 13
before the track splits.

336
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:35,651
Let me talk to Ned again.

337
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,213
Nice job. Asshole!

338
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:46,651
Ned. I want you to get back in your
car and follow the mainline. Okay?

339
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:47,974
I want a set of
eyes on that train.

340
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:49,768
You got them. Roger that.

341
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:02,129
I can't hear you!

342
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,930
Railroad Safety Campaign!

343
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:02,375
You're good.

344
00:23:04,178 --> 00:23:05,722
Keep it coming. 50.

345
00:23:08,177 --> 00:23:09,366
20 feet.

346
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:10,968
Slow down.

347
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:14,890
All right. You're good.

348
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,011
Yeah.
What's going on?

349
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:32,843
You got a minute?

350
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:38,645
I thought he said
it was looking good.

351
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,841
That's what he thought.

352
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:43,325
Turns out the judge they
assigned was a real hard-ass.

353
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:45,847
You got to be kidding me.

354
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:48,446
Look. The restraining order is
being continued for another 30 days.

355
00:23:48,532 --> 00:23:50,652
Thirty days? What am I
supposed to do for 30 days?

356
00:23:50,738 --> 00:23:52,014
Stay away from my kid?

357
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,047
And then there's another
hearing after that. I guess.

358
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:58,410
What's taking
you so long. Will?

359
00:23:58,573 --> 00:23:59,925
You call that lawyer.
You can tell him

360
00:24:00,012 --> 00:24:01,326
he can stick it
up his ass. I got to go.

361
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:02,726
Will, pick up the radio.

362
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:06,284
Will. Pick up the radio.
Over.

363
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,576
Are you there?

364
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:09,602
Yeah.

365
00:24:09,938 --> 00:24:12,489
Yeah. Get off the phone.
Knock off the hand brakes.

366
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:14,694
Get up here. It's time
to go. We got work to do.

367
00:24:14,771 --> 00:24:15,807
Copy.

368
00:24:27,737 --> 00:24:28,773
No. It's definitely
under power.

369
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:30,250
We're not sure of
the exact speed yet.

370
00:24:30,576 --> 00:24:33,088
I thought all these trains had
some sort of dead-man brake.

371
00:24:33,175 --> 00:24:35,246
There's a wand the engineer
has to hit periodically

372
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:36,886
or the air brakes are
automatically applied.

373
00:24:36,972 --> 00:24:39,408
Unfortunately. This train's
air brakes were disconnected.

374
00:24:39,696 --> 00:24:43,014
Sir, I would gladly explain the
particulars of locomotive operation to you

375
00:24:43,091 --> 00:24:45,929
if we had time. But right now
I really need your assistance

376
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:47,847
posting officers at
all the mainline crossings.

377
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:48,883
One question.

378
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:51,367
How do you all
plan to stop it?

379
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:54,004
We're working on it.

380
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,764
Go. Go. Go!
The splits is coming up!

381
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:07,680
Are you sure
you can do this?

382
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:09,320
Just get
alongside of the cab.

383
00:25:15,295 --> 00:25:16,723
Get up alongside of it!

384
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:17,846
I'm trying!

385
00:25:21,778 --> 00:25:23,082
Go. Go. Go!

386
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:28,682
Remember. We don't have
a lot of track!

387
00:25:35,376 --> 00:25:37,208
You got it. Go. Go!

388
00:25:39,893 --> 00:25:41,246
Dewey!

389
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:43,202
It's too fast! Back it up!

390
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,638
Come on. Dewey! Go back!

391
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:56,609
Jump. Gilleece! Do it!

392
00:25:56,695 --> 00:25:58,402
Get in! Watch out!

393
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:05,125
So now what the hell do we do?

394
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:21,323
How many cars are we
supposed to cut in?

395
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,890
Twenty. Why?

396
00:26:24,977 --> 00:26:26,281
Twenty cars. Okay.

397
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,362
See the switch stand
up ahead of us?

398
00:26:28,774 --> 00:26:30,645
The switch stand. Yeah?
Uh-huh.

399
00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:33,809
Take a look in the rear view
mirror. You see the one behind us?

400
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,842
Way back there. You see it? Uh-huh.

401
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:38,969
There's exactly 21 cars
between the two stands.

402
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,120
Don't ask me how I know.

403
00:26:40,494 --> 00:26:42,086
So why is it that

404
00:26:42,172 --> 00:26:45,039
there's still more than four and
a half cars that are yet to clear?

405
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:48,645
Because I...

406
00:26:49,096 --> 00:26:50,007
Excuse me?

407
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:51,800
- Because I cut...
- Because what?

408
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:53,201
I cut in too many cars.

409
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:54,840
Cut in too many cars. Huh?

410
00:26:55,253 --> 00:26:57,037
Maybe if you weren't on
my ass the whole time.

411
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:59,156
I might be able to think
straight and do my job.

412
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:00,163
What do you mean.
"Maybe. If I..."

413
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:02,081
You been on my ass this whole
trip! You're blaming it on me?

414
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,596
I'm just saying.
Pick a goddamn job!

415
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:05,044
I got my job!
You pick one!

416
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:07,126
I pull the throttle. You pull
the pin! It's one or the other!

417
00:27:07,212 --> 00:27:08,516
You're five pins too many.

418
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:10,444
Pull the pins. You're
right. Pull the pins.

419
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,170
I've had my training!
All right?

420
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:14,807
Yeah. But we're out here in the
real world. This isn't training.

421
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:17,521
In training. They just give you
an F. Out here. You get killed.

422
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:19,123
I screwed up. Okay?
Yes. You did.

423
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:20,638
Stop and roll back and
I'll cut the empties.

424
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:21,683
Roll back?

425
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,637
Oh. Lord.

426
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,402
We can't stop out
here on the main.

427
00:27:26,526 --> 00:27:27,716
We're more than
a mile out on the main.

428
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,039
More than a mile
to the next stop.

429
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:32,165
You don't take a consist this
size that distance in reverse.

430
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:37,085
Fine. Then we'll make the
turn at the next siding.

431
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:39,320
The next siding's
not for 10 miles.

432
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:41,324
We do that. We're late.
I don't run late.

433
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,811
Just green-sheet it
and we'll move on.

434
00:27:42,887 --> 00:27:45,160
Come on. We green-sheet it and
it's my ass! Cut me some slack.

435
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,203
What do you mean. It's
your ass? You're a Colson.

436
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:48,325
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

437
00:27:48,411 --> 00:27:50,166
That means you can call your
uncle and they'll take care of it.

438
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,288
Is that what
this is about?

439
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:52,410
No. It's about
the five cars too many.

440
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:54,683
We're going to stop. Roll back
and cut those empties!

441
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:57,320
This may be your engine.
But it's my goddamn train.

442
00:27:57,445 --> 00:27:59,162
Yes. It is.
I'm the goddamn conductor!

443
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:00,763
- That's true.
- 1206, check in.

444
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,490
I'll write you up and
green-sheet your ass.

445
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:03,516
Will you?
How about that?

446
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:06,719
1206, this is dispatch. What's your
location? Over.

447
00:28:06,891 --> 00:28:08,560
- Something is funny?
- No.

448
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,401
What the hell are you laughing
at? What are you laughing at?

449
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:12,799
Because it's funny.
You're a funny guy.

450
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,040
Well-trained. But funny.
Yeah. This is 1206.

451
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:19,646
We're 60 miles
from Wilkins.

452
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:21,449
Forty minutes
out of Fuller Yard.

453
00:28:22,207 --> 00:28:23,761
Negative. 1206. Clear your
train at the next siding

454
00:28:23,847 --> 00:28:25,487
until further instructed.
Over.

455
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:26,925
What's up?

456
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:30,080
There's an unmanned train out of
Fuller, on the northbound track. Over.

457
00:28:31,653 --> 00:28:33,322
On our track?

458
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,365
A coaster?

459
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:36,515
1206. We don't have
all the details yet.

460
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:38,721
Just proceed to the next
siding and hold tight. Over.

461
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:40,476
Next siding's
not for 10 miles.

462
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,720
Affirmative, 1206.

463
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:44,120
Just get in that
siding and sit tight

464
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:45,521
until we give you
the all-clear. Over.

465
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:46,959
Affirmative.

466
00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:51,802
It's coming right at us.

467
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:04,001
More word on that runaway freight
train in rural Pennsylvania.

468
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:06,408
The train, A WVR777,

469
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:08,489
otherwise known as 777,

470
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:10,474
left Fuller
Yard in northern PA

471
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:12,517
sometime before 8:00 A.M. This morning

472
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:14,272
and no one was on-board.

473
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:16,842
Live, local, late-breaking.

474
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:19,681
The engineer, they say, made an
error in controlling the train.

475
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,244
Before leaving
the locomotive,

476
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,354
he intended to apply
the independent brakes.

477
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,281
And then by the time
he realized his mistake,

478
00:29:25,406 --> 00:29:28,005
the train was going too fast
for him to climb back on.

479
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:29,760
We're being told
now by a spokesperson

480
00:29:29,923 --> 00:29:31,352
for the Public
Utilities Commission

481
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:33,999
that this employee
will be held accountable.

482
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:43,963
Connie?
Yeah.

483
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,715
Headquarters is
on the phone. It's Galvin.

484
00:29:53,486 --> 00:29:54,886
Mr. Galvin. How are you?

485
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:56,315
God damn it.
How could this happen?

486
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:00,525
It's an unfortunate combination
of human error and bad luck.

487
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:01,676
Luck?

488
00:30:01,762 --> 00:30:04,007
I was a yardmaster
for 10 years. Ms. Hooper.

489
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:05,877
Luck has no business
in a rail yard.

490
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:07,881
What are we worried about
in terms of cargo?

491
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,914
Well. Obviously.
The diesel fuel's a concern.

492
00:30:10,202 --> 00:30:11,679
No, I said cargo.

493
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:13,367
Okay. Well.
Cars 7 through 10

494
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:16,483
and 16 through 19 are carrying
a chemical called molten phenol.

495
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,401
We're still trying to
connect with the shipper

496
00:30:18,488 --> 00:30:19,917
to determine
exactly what that is.

497
00:30:20,003 --> 00:30:21,643
It's used in
the manufacture of glue.

498
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:23,360
Can you hold on
one moment?

499
00:30:24,203 --> 00:30:25,393
You know about
molten phenol?

500
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:26,716
Yes.

501
00:30:28,922 --> 00:30:32,154
Mr. Galvin. We have
an FRA inspector here.

502
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,794
May I put you on speaker?

503
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:40,152
Region 2 Federal Safety Inspector
Scott Werner. How can I help?

504
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:42,482
Just tell me what you know
about molten phenol.

505
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:47,201
Well. It's serious stuff.
Very toxic. Highly combustible.

506
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:48,678
Oh, that's terrific.

507
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,356
Hooper. Get state
police back on the line.

508
00:30:50,442 --> 00:30:52,159
Make sure they got a HazMat
team briefed and ready.

509
00:30:52,926 --> 00:30:55,074
And ask them to put a
spotter chopper over 777.

510
00:30:55,362 --> 00:30:57,079
I take it you've
sided all rail traffic?

511
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:58,920
On our end, yes.
Brewster's notifying its own.

512
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:00,473
Sir.

513
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,152
How are we going
to handle this?

514
00:31:02,248 --> 00:31:03,763
I mean. This train
is en route to pass

515
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:05,604
through some
highly populated areas.

516
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:08,913
We're having a strategy call
in about two minutes.

517
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,754
All right. I'll be ready.

518
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,509
You won't be on
the call. Ms. Hooper.

519
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:15,357
Excuse me?
You'll be advised.

520
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:17,602
For now. Coordinate
with local authorities.

521
00:31:17,726 --> 00:31:20,354
God knows we got to have over 100
crossings that need to be secured.

522
00:31:20,642 --> 00:31:22,397
One hundred
and seventy-three.

523
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:24,324
Railroad crossings.

524
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:27,038
Between here and AWVR
substation in Brewster.

525
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:29,723
Listen. Mr. Galvin.

526
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:35,564
This train is half a mile long and
is traveling at speed into population

527
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:37,913
with eight freight cars of
hazardous chemicals

528
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,081
and 5, 000 gallons
of diesel fuel.

529
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,402
Sir, we're not just talking
about a train here.

530
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:46,353
We're talking about a missile
the size of the Chrysler Building.

531
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:48,002
So. What is your
point. Ms. Hooper?

532
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:50,112
My point is after it
crosses through Findlay.

533
00:31:50,246 --> 00:31:52,395
There's about 12 miles
of vacant farmland.

534
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:55,684
But after that. It's nothing
but town after town

535
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:56,710
all the way to Stanton.

536
00:31:56,806 --> 00:31:58,273
We have a very
limited window here.

537
00:31:58,408 --> 00:32:00,402
So. What are you
suggesting we do. Derail it?

538
00:32:00,968 --> 00:32:02,320
Yes. Sir. I am.

539
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:05,198
While we still can.

540
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:14,155
Mr. Galvin. I understand that's going to
cost the company a lot of money...

541
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:15,593
Do you think?

542
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:19,113
Ms. Hooper. We're not going to intentionally
destroy one of our own trains.

543
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:20,964
Not when we can
still stop it.

544
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:22,556
We can avoid
a lot of collateral...

545
00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:24,311
I'm going to extend you
my last ounce of good will

546
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:26,430
and pretend this conversation
never happened.

547
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:32,836
He thinks I'm worried
about my job.

548
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:42,599
Ma'am.
Please stay in your van.

549
00:32:43,366 --> 00:32:44,958
Come on. Please get back into the van.

550
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:46,598
Can you please tell us what's going on?

551
00:32:46,685 --> 00:32:48,229
Every crossing's
closed off for 20 miles.

552
00:32:48,325 --> 00:32:49,753
Ma'am. For your safety.
Please get back into your van.

553
00:32:49,878 --> 00:32:50,952
I'm not getting
back in the vehicle.

554
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,074
We need to know
what's going on.

555
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,832
Guys. Get out of there.
There's a train coming.

556
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:16,990
Hurry!

557
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:18,956
Hurry! It's coming!

558
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:22,561
Come on. We got to go.

559
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:24,470
Get out of there! Move it!

560
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,353
Get out of the way!

561
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:15,988
1206 to dispatch. Over.

562
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,156
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

563
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:19,834
We're not going to fit in that
siding. That's what's wrong.

564
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,675
1206 to dispatch. Over.

565
00:34:22,164 --> 00:34:23,680
1206. Are you
in the siding yet?

566
00:34:23,881 --> 00:34:25,233
What's your location?

567
00:34:25,483 --> 00:34:28,072
No, we're not in the hole.
We're not going to make it, can't do it.

568
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:29,386
Too much train.

569
00:34:29,482 --> 00:34:31,074
I'm going to need you
to realign the switch

570
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,675
so we can proceed
to the next siding.

571
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:34,785
1206. You have to
get off the main. Over.

572
00:34:34,881 --> 00:34:36,876
I understand that. But
you got to understand this.

573
00:34:36,962 --> 00:34:37,950
We're not going to fit.

574
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:39,388
1206, stand by.

575
00:34:39,484 --> 00:34:42,390
That siding's a good
3.000 feet. End to end.

576
00:34:42,524 --> 00:34:43,752
Check your timetable.

577
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:46,629
It's going to tell you
the siding is 4. 111 feet.

578
00:34:46,715 --> 00:34:48,317
But that's
signal to signal.

579
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:51,309
In reality.
It's more like 2.500 feet.

580
00:34:51,395 --> 00:34:53,275
You add those five cars
that you picked up...

581
00:34:53,361 --> 00:34:54,397
We can fit.

582
00:34:54,522 --> 00:34:55,557
No, we won't fit.

583
00:34:56,516 --> 00:34:58,070
Dispatch. This is 1206.

584
00:34:58,156 --> 00:34:59,748
Can you tell me where
the nearest rip track is?

585
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:02,913
1206. There's one in 6.2
miles. How fast are you going?

586
00:35:03,517 --> 00:35:04,869
55 miles an hour.

587
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,308
1206. Go faster. Over.

588
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:08,427
Why? Is that coaster
still on the main?

589
00:35:08,562 --> 00:35:12,551
1206, 777 is not a coaster. I
repeat, it is not a coaster. Over.

590
00:35:13,683 --> 00:35:15,198
You're telling me
it's under power?

591
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:17,116
Get in the goddamn siding.

592
00:35:18,401 --> 00:35:20,473
1206, stand by.

593
00:35:25,555 --> 00:35:28,279
1206. If you're going for it.
That rip track is confirmed vacant.

594
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:29,986
It's your call, Frank.

595
00:35:30,082 --> 00:35:31,674
We need to throw the switch
if you're staying on.

596
00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:34,225
We're not staying on!
Pull the brake. Frank.

597
00:35:34,321 --> 00:35:35,472
We pull the brake
and side up. I crash.

598
00:35:35,558 --> 00:35:36,670
I know what
the hell I'm doing.

599
00:35:36,757 --> 00:35:38,751
Bullshit! You're going to
get us killed. Hey!

600
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:41,264
1206, I need
an answer. Over.

601
00:35:43,038 --> 00:35:44,553
Realign the switch.

602
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,232
Over.

603
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:07,234
The train was just going with
no one in it. Just took off.

604
00:36:07,397 --> 00:36:08,558
We were yelling on
the radio earlier,

605
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:09,824
there's a runaway
train coming through.

606
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,550
It could be coming
to our town next

607
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,516
and the high school's right
next to those train tracks.

608
00:36:13,592 --> 00:36:14,782
Just a few moments ago,

609
00:36:14,878 --> 00:36:16,757
a train came barreling down
these tracks...

610
00:36:17,035 --> 00:36:18,551
We're still going
over the numbers.

611
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:22,866
But should 777 derail. We're
looking at a major disaster.

612
00:36:23,192 --> 00:36:25,110
If even one of
those HazMat cars blew.

613
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:27,230
It could easily
decimate an entire town.

614
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:29,109
That train is carrying
eight of them.

615
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:31,469
Can you please explain to our
viewers what you witnessed...

616
00:36:31,641 --> 00:36:35,429
Environmental liability. Track
damage. Car and locomotive loss.

617
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:39,630
We're looking at a projected
cost easily over $100 million.

618
00:36:39,793 --> 00:36:41,701
And the resulting
stock devaluation?

619
00:36:41,797 --> 00:36:46,554
Our projections indicate it
could be in the 30 to 40 % range.

620
00:36:46,755 --> 00:36:47,705
Oh!

621
00:36:47,801 --> 00:36:49,268
I say we go with
Mr. Galvin's option.

622
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:53,152
I've already prepped
our substation in Brewster.

623
00:36:53,238 --> 00:36:54,706
They just need a go-ahead.

624
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:56,307
You have it.

625
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:00,469
Okay. Everybody out.

626
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:02,272
Hoffman. You stay here.

627
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:05,264
Baker. Get me a track schematic.
Fuller to Stanton. Please.

628
00:37:18,518 --> 00:37:20,110
This is Owens.

629
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:23,994
71. 70. 71 on the gun.

630
00:37:26,554 --> 00:37:27,907
So the red means?

631
00:37:27,993 --> 00:37:29,662
777 blew through a signal.

632
00:37:29,758 --> 00:37:31,273
Everything in red means
trouble on the mainline.

633
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,663
That's a lot of red.

634
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:34,581
Connie, Mr. Galvin on line 2.

635
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:39,185
This is Connie Hooper.

636
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:42,311
Have all the mainline
crossings been closed?

637
00:37:42,436 --> 00:37:44,431
Yes, I've been
coordinating with PSP.

638
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:45,946
Do we have
a strategy in place?

639
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,471
It's already underway.

640
00:37:58,432 --> 00:37:59,986
By the activity
level behind me,

641
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:03,035
it is evident that a plan to stop
the runaway train is underway,

642
00:38:03,352 --> 00:38:06,872
but so far, no one
at AWVR is commenting.

643
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:13,460
We just witnessed
A WVR employee Ryan Scott

644
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:15,311
boarding one of
the rescue helicopters.

645
00:38:15,397 --> 00:38:18,667
He is a 22-year-old Marine vet who
has just returned from Afghanistan.

646
00:38:23,558 --> 00:38:26,666
What the hell is this?
I need a police escort now!

647
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,740
Whoa!

648
00:38:29,677 --> 00:38:31,547
It says here you're
a welder. Lead welder.

649
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:33,149
Listen. Buddy.
I don't got a lot of time.

650
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,345
You can call my yardmaster.
Connie Hooper!

651
00:38:40,677 --> 00:38:42,547
Connie sent you?
That's what I said.

652
00:38:42,672 --> 00:38:44,024
I need your help.

653
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:54,103
1206, this is dispatch.

654
00:38:54,189 --> 00:38:57,182
1206. We ran the math. At over
2.000. You wouldn't have fit.

655
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,339
Good call. Over.

656
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,233
Thank you. But I need to know
where that oncoming train is.

657
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,218
How far away is it?

658
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:07,270
1206, we're not exactly sure.

659
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:08,786
You're not sure?
Well. Find out!

660
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,978
I'm high above central
Pennsylvania. This train got away...

661
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:19,153
Emergency responders want to
halt all activity near the line

662
00:39:19,229 --> 00:39:20,984
and possibly
evacuate all homes

663
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:22,902
within a mile
radius of the tracks.

664
00:39:23,037 --> 00:39:25,904
There's thousands of gallons of fuel
onboard, which is highly flammable.

665
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,659
But we're still
awaiting word on that.

666
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:38,064
This is Galvin's strategy?

667
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,185
Looks like they're
putting a train in front of 777

668
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:48,431
in an attempt
to slow it down.

669
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:53,620
Now, they are sending
a chopper with Ryan Scott

670
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:56,458
and the railroad company
is still refusing to comment.

671
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:11,822
We've just learned that 26-year
rail company veteran Judd Stewart

672
00:40:11,947 --> 00:40:13,260
is at the controls
of the engine

673
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:14,747
that is in front of
the runaway train.

674
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:39,863
This is Connie Hooper
from Fuller Yard.

675
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,427
Is this your guy
coming off the helicopter?

676
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:54,623
Still holding at 55.

677
00:40:55,026 --> 00:40:56,627
Get her down to 40
and keep braking.

678
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:33,377
Shit!

679
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,174
That's it. Keep going.
Keep slowing.

680
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,418
Get her down to 40
and we'll set our boy down.

681
00:42:04,027 --> 00:42:05,063
Unbelievable!

682
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,702
Do this!

683
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:07,978
Come on.

684
00:42:08,189 --> 00:42:09,541
...incredibly dangerous...

685
00:42:22,747 --> 00:42:24,463
Do this. Judd. Come on!

686
00:42:34,504 --> 00:42:35,857
I'm under 40.
Is he on yet?

687
00:42:39,108 --> 00:42:40,460
Now!

688
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,184
Looks like Marine
Ryan Scott has been injured.

689
00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:03,179
It's a no-go.
Slow down!

690
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:06,583
Just keep braking. Try to slow
it. Try to get 777 off the main.

691
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:09,576
Switch has been thrown.

692
00:43:20,422 --> 00:43:22,062
Slow down. God damn it!

693
00:43:26,943 --> 00:43:29,092
Don't side it yet!
It's going too fast.

694
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:47,706
Bail! Bail! Bail!

695
00:44:04,748 --> 00:44:06,215
Holy shit!

696
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:09,418
Maybe it derailed.

697
00:44:11,825 --> 00:44:14,539
Wow! I can't
believe how crazy that was.

698
00:44:15,182 --> 00:44:17,330
Oh. My God!
Galvin. You asshole!

699
00:44:42,466 --> 00:44:44,854
Fuller Yard.
Fuller Yard. This is 1206.

700
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,297
We're passing milepost 52.
Heading northbound on the Main 1.

701
00:44:48,623 --> 00:44:49,898
1206. Who am I
speaking with?

702
00:44:49,985 --> 00:44:51,500
Frank Barnes. The engineer.

703
00:44:51,586 --> 00:44:53,418
This is Connie Hooper.
Yardmaster at Fuller.

704
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:55,537
Why are you still
on the mainline?

705
00:44:55,624 --> 00:44:57,743
We were directed to
a siding that's a no-go.

706
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,378
We're heading to a rip track
just past milepost 5-0.

707
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:03,852
We need to know the location
of your yard's train.

708
00:45:03,948 --> 00:45:07,621
It just passed milepost 47.

709
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:09,414
Holy shit.

710
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:20,098
They tried to side it. But it jumped
the switch and derailed the lash-up.

711
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:22,419
Lash-up? Who was driving?

712
00:45:22,543 --> 00:45:25,257
The engineer,
a 26-year rail company veteran,

713
00:45:25,344 --> 00:45:28,537
was killed earlier today in Keating
Summit, central Pennsylvania.

714
00:45:28,623 --> 00:45:29,573
Judd Stewart.

715
00:45:30,868 --> 00:45:32,018
Stewart?

716
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:33,888
You said Stewart?

717
00:45:34,387 --> 00:45:36,142
Judd Stewart.
An engineer from Brewster.

718
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:42,731
You know him?

719
00:45:51,343 --> 00:45:52,772
What's your power
on the point?

720
00:45:54,344 --> 00:45:56,339
5.000 horses.
She's not a hotshot.

721
00:45:56,425 --> 00:45:59,091
But she's still got
some life left in her. Over.

722
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:02,208
Give her all you got. Tell Galvin
we got two guys out on the mainline

723
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,647
about to play chicken
with our train.

724
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:13,697
We tried to stop it. We blew it. What?

725
00:46:13,822 --> 00:46:15,337
That train has got
to go down.

726
00:46:15,423 --> 00:46:17,015
The only question is
how to minimize the damage.

727
00:46:17,102 --> 00:46:18,051
Quiet!

728
00:46:18,138 --> 00:46:20,621
We just learned there is yet
another train on this track,

729
00:46:20,938 --> 00:46:22,779
headed directly
at the runaway.

730
00:46:23,144 --> 00:46:24,611
What the hell is this?

731
00:46:25,062 --> 00:46:28,092
We got to learn
about it on damn TV?

732
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:45,057
Nicole. Listen. Don't
hang up. Don't hang up.

733
00:46:45,143 --> 00:46:46,448
Dad. I'm busy. Okay?

734
00:46:46,544 --> 00:46:47,819
Okay, I understand.

735
00:46:48,145 --> 00:46:49,900
Dad? I just wanted
to tell you I love you.

736
00:46:50,025 --> 00:46:52,336
That's all. Okay.
Fine! Dad. What's wrong?

737
00:46:52,422 --> 00:46:54,571
Nothing. Nothing.
I just...

738
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,292
Dad. What's wrong?

739
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:02,128
Just tell your sister I love
you both. Okay? I got to go.

740
00:47:03,979 --> 00:47:05,772
What's wrong?

741
00:47:15,736 --> 00:47:17,529
1206. How are you
holding up?

742
00:47:17,616 --> 00:47:19,774
About a half a mile from
that rip track. Over.

743
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,574
Chances are you're going to
see 777's nose any minute now.

744
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,658
Affirmative.

745
00:47:36,978 --> 00:47:38,330
Why are you braking?

746
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:41,054
Trust me. If we head in this hot.
We'll tear right off the track.

747
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:44,612
Oh. Jesus.

748
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:51,651
Get her down to 40
and brace yourself.

749
00:47:55,257 --> 00:47:57,377
You need to get at least
10 cars into the siding.

750
00:48:04,138 --> 00:48:05,298
Yes!

751
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,170
Frank, go to 6. Frank, go to 6.

752
00:48:44,378 --> 00:48:45,615
Yeah. I'm at 6. Go.

753
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:47,811
They're evacuating Arklow.

754
00:48:48,454 --> 00:48:49,739
They're going to
derail the train.

755
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,571
What are they using?

756
00:48:51,657 --> 00:48:53,565
Standard DRE.

757
00:48:53,939 --> 00:48:55,330
Yeah.
A portable derailer.

758
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:01,612
What are you doing?

759
00:49:01,698 --> 00:49:04,210
I got a look at that train's
last coupler knuckle. It was open.

760
00:49:05,102 --> 00:49:06,771
We take off right now.
We get back on the main.

761
00:49:06,857 --> 00:49:08,373
We can chase it
down in reverse.

762
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:09,648
Chase?
Whoa. Wait a minute.

763
00:49:09,734 --> 00:49:12,333
The only way to stop that kind
of power. Grab it by the tail.

764
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,647
Boom. Gun it in
the opposite direction.

765
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:14,923
We can't just chase it down.
If it goes down.

766
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:16,371
We're going to be
a wreck on a wreck.

767
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:20,763
Doesn't matter. There's a good
chance the derailer won't work.

768
00:49:21,022 --> 00:49:23,017
It's called a derailer.
For Christ's sake!

769
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,522
That's what they do!
A train that size

770
00:49:24,618 --> 00:49:27,572
going that fast. It will vaporize
anything that gets in its way.

771
00:49:27,658 --> 00:49:29,087
Bullshit!
They wouldn't use it if...

772
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,494
They're wrong. All right?
They're wrong.

773
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:33,374
Are you in or are you out?

774
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,407
You want to get yourself
killed. You do it alone.

775
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:37,565
You know what? Ask your
wife what she thinks.

776
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:39,483
Wait!

777
00:49:43,175 --> 00:49:45,007
If you're right and
that derailer fails.

778
00:49:45,093 --> 00:49:46,887
What are the odds it
makes it to Stanton?

779
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:49,371
You saw the train.
What do you think?

780
00:50:14,372 --> 00:50:16,770
1206. This is Connie Hooper.
Are you there?

781
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:19,417
1206. Over.

782
00:50:19,493 --> 00:50:21,287
Just wanted to see
how you boys are doing.

783
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:27,089
We're doing about 60
mile an hour. Connie.

784
00:50:27,376 --> 00:50:29,927
Sorry? Frank.
I don't understand.

785
00:50:30,052 --> 00:50:31,960
We're going
after your train.

786
00:50:32,056 --> 00:50:33,936
1206, I'm not hearing you.

787
00:50:34,013 --> 00:50:35,442
The rear knuckle
was left open.

788
00:50:35,538 --> 00:50:37,926
So if we can catch up. We can
tie it on to our locomotive.

789
00:50:38,012 --> 00:50:39,489
Try and slow down 777.

790
00:50:39,575 --> 00:50:40,688
Frank. You can't.

791
00:50:40,774 --> 00:50:41,848
We already are.

792
00:50:41,934 --> 00:50:43,574
Portable derailer's
not going to cut it. Connie.

793
00:50:44,178 --> 00:50:45,722
Who said anything
about a derailer?

794
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:48,849
Dispatch. They said that
they're evacuating Arklow.

795
00:50:48,935 --> 00:50:49,971
Two plus two is four.

796
00:50:51,496 --> 00:50:52,973
It's Ned. He said he's still
following... No. No. No.

797
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:55,293
Tell him I'll call him back.
Get me Galvin. Now.

798
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,005
Frank. That train is carrying
30.000 gallons of toxic chemicals.

799
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,687
They had a window before. But that
train is going into populated areas.

800
00:51:02,774 --> 00:51:04,126
There's no way
they'd derail it now.

801
00:51:06,418 --> 00:51:07,646
Are you sure about that?

802
00:51:09,372 --> 00:51:10,925
Look. Let me
make some calls.

803
00:51:11,213 --> 00:51:13,121
Make some calls. Please.

804
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:23,815
What do you think? Do you
think they can catch up?

805
00:51:24,774 --> 00:51:26,970
Possibly.
But even if they do.

806
00:51:27,056 --> 00:51:30,403
We're talking about coupling at 10
times the normal speed. In reverse.

807
00:51:31,372 --> 00:51:33,127
I thought you were
in favor of derailment.

808
00:51:33,213 --> 00:51:35,409
Yeah. When they were in the
middle of nowhere. Not now.

809
00:51:35,495 --> 00:51:36,924
It's just town
after town out there!

810
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,679
Mr. Galvin says he'd
have to call you back.

811
00:51:38,775 --> 00:51:40,770
This is Connie Hooper
for Mr. Galvin.

812
00:51:40,856 --> 00:51:42,045
Mr. Galvin is in a meeting.

813
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:45,249
Then maybe you can tell me. Is the
company planning on derailing 777?

814
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,723
Last I heard. Galvin
was dead set against it.

815
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:49,478
I'm sorry, I'd really like
to help you, Ms. Hooper.

816
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:51,089
But I'm not at liberty
to give you that information.

817
00:51:51,175 --> 00:51:53,410
No. Of course
you're not at liberty to.

818
00:51:53,851 --> 00:51:55,328
Frank's right.

819
00:52:02,214 --> 00:52:04,649
What's the fastest you've
taken a single engine like this?

820
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:06,481
Unattached?
Yeah.

821
00:52:06,577 --> 00:52:08,447
Fifty. 55.

822
00:52:09,454 --> 00:52:10,682
Of course.
I was going forward.

823
00:52:11,411 --> 00:52:12,571
1206, you there?

824
00:52:13,252 --> 00:52:14,527
This is 1206. Over.

825
00:52:14,652 --> 00:52:15,889
Frank, you're right.

826
00:52:15,975 --> 00:52:18,402
About the derailment.

827
00:52:18,498 --> 00:52:20,368
They're planning an attempt
outside of Arklow.

828
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:25,009
Tell them idiots
it isn't going to work.

829
00:52:25,134 --> 00:52:26,764
That portable derailer.
It's worthless.

830
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:28,165
She already told us.

831
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:32,758
Frank. This is Oscar Galvin.
VP of Operations.

832
00:52:32,854 --> 00:52:35,482
Patched in at his request.
Open mike.

833
00:52:36,096 --> 00:52:40,133
Yeah. We're derailing 777.
Frank. It's a done decision.

834
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:42,598
Like it or not, it's our
best option at this stage.

835
00:52:42,694 --> 00:52:44,928
There will be less collateral
damage in Arklow.

836
00:52:45,293 --> 00:52:46,645
It's already being evacuated.

837
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:49,484
And we can't let 777
make it to Stanton.

838
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,603
Look. Mr. Galvin.
With all due respect.

839
00:52:51,689 --> 00:52:53,243
I've been railroading
28 years.

840
00:52:54,048 --> 00:52:56,436
I'm telling you. We got a
real chance to stop this thing.

841
00:52:56,532 --> 00:52:57,884
No. We already tried.

842
00:52:57,971 --> 00:53:01,241
That was from the front.
We're long hood lead back.

843
00:53:01,327 --> 00:53:04,243
It's a different situation.
We got more control now.

844
00:53:07,014 --> 00:53:09,402
What if I cancel the derailer
and you fail. Frank?

845
00:53:10,371 --> 00:53:12,203
That train will be doing
70 miles an hour

846
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,284
into that elevated
S- curve in Stanton.

847
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,087
The damage will
be 100 times worse.

848
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:20,162
Right. I'm just telling you. The
portable derailer is worthless.

849
00:53:20,613 --> 00:53:23,212
You got too much train
traveling entirely too fast.

850
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:26,837
Maybe 1206 should just
stay on it as a backup.

851
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:30,923
Look. I am not jeopardizing
more personnel and more property

852
00:53:31,009 --> 00:53:33,685
just because some engineer
wants to play hero.

853
00:53:33,771 --> 00:53:35,488
End of discussion!

854
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:38,691
That train is our property.
It's our decision!

855
00:53:39,813 --> 00:53:42,891
Now you stop your pursuit
or I will fire you!

856
00:53:43,495 --> 00:53:45,490
Fire.
You already did.

857
00:53:49,815 --> 00:53:51,484
Already did what?

858
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:53,929
You've already fired me.

859
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:59,760
I received my 90-day notice
in the mail 72 days ago.

860
00:54:00,614 --> 00:54:02,685
Forced early retirement.
Half benefits.

861
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:13,848
So you're going to risk your
life for us with three weeks left.

862
00:54:15,526 --> 00:54:16,879
Not for you.

863
00:54:18,528 --> 00:54:19,880
I'm not doing it for you.

864
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,803
Frank.
Let me see that thing.

865
00:54:28,128 --> 00:54:30,641
Mr. Galvin. This is Will
Colson. Your conductor.

866
00:54:33,892 --> 00:54:36,318
I'm letting you know. We're
going to run this bitch down.

867
00:54:36,932 --> 00:54:40,566
Maybe you didn't hear what I just
said. Colson. I will fire you!

868
00:54:42,053 --> 00:54:46,119
Well. That's too bad. I was
just starting to like this job.

869
00:54:48,287 --> 00:54:52,525
God damn it, you listen to me! You
son of a bitch! You will be fired!

870
00:54:52,612 --> 00:54:55,930
You're breaking up. Sorry.
You're...

871
00:55:00,293 --> 00:55:03,247
- This garbage is...
- Sir. I think they're gone.

872
00:55:06,613 --> 00:55:08,522
This is your
headache now. Hooper.

873
00:55:08,608 --> 00:55:12,761
Now you get them off the main or
consider yourself shit-canned. Too!

874
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:15,724
I like them.

875
00:55:16,405 --> 00:55:18,285
Bring up Beech Siding
to Arklow.

876
00:55:18,812 --> 00:55:21,603
Take a look behind me, you can
see emergency evacuation measures

877
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:24,125
are currently in effect right
here in the tiny town of Arklow.

878
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:31,433
The lash-up was a no-go.

879
00:55:36,046 --> 00:55:38,673
1206 to Fuller Yard.
Connie. Are you there? Over.

880
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:41,320
Frank. I'm real sorry
about Galvin.

881
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:43,161
That's okay.
Listen. Listen. Is he off?

882
00:55:43,248 --> 00:55:44,245
Yeah. He's gone.

883
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:45,847
Okay. Listen up.

884
00:55:45,923 --> 00:55:47,352
I'm going to need you
to do us a favor.

885
00:55:47,448 --> 00:55:51,323
I need you to keep us posted on
the speed and location of 777.

886
00:55:51,409 --> 00:55:52,953
Location and speed.
Over.

887
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:56,722
Connie?

888
00:55:58,726 --> 00:56:00,683
Frank. 777's
9 miles out of Arklow.

889
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:01,958
You got some
catching up to do.

890
00:56:02,044 --> 00:56:03,320
9 miles out of Arklow.

891
00:56:18,367 --> 00:56:20,199
What did you say
your wife's first name was?

892
00:56:20,285 --> 00:56:21,282
Darcy.

893
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:23,315
So. What was the long story
you didn't want to make long?

894
00:56:26,288 --> 00:56:27,880
I come home from
work two weeks ago

895
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,846
and she's
texting on the phone.

896
00:56:29,923 --> 00:56:32,484
I ask her who with.
She says. "Nobody."

897
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:34,766
I say. "Let me see
the phone." She says no.

898
00:56:34,843 --> 00:56:37,202
This goes on
five or six times.

899
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,686
Wait. You're losing me.
She's texting...

900
00:56:39,926 --> 00:56:41,479
There's this guy
we both went to school with.

901
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:43,637
He's a cop.
He's a PA state trooper.

902
00:56:43,723 --> 00:56:46,284
He's always had a thing
for Darcy. Going way back.

903
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:47,838
1206, where are you?

904
00:56:47,924 --> 00:56:51,559
1206 here. Connie. We're
just passing milepost 5-7.

905
00:56:51,645 --> 00:56:53,237
You're about a mile
and a half behind.

906
00:56:55,529 --> 00:56:57,437
How far out of Arklow
is 777?

907
00:56:57,524 --> 00:57:00,036
Seven and a half miles. It picked
up speed. You better step on it.

908
00:57:00,123 --> 00:57:02,367
I'm stepping on it. In it.
Around it and through it. Connie.

909
00:57:02,443 --> 00:57:03,959
Thank you. Over.

910
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:08,437
She's texting on the phone. I keep on
asking for it. She keeps on saying no.

911
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:11,640
She starts to walk
away and I grab for it.

912
00:57:12,686 --> 00:57:14,354
You hit her?
No. No. No.

913
00:57:16,445 --> 00:57:19,236
I mean. I scared her.
But I didn't hit her.

914
00:57:21,048 --> 00:57:22,803
Anyway. I drive
to this guy's house

915
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:24,357
and tell him we need to talk.
Let's take a ride.

916
00:57:24,443 --> 00:57:26,198
He jumps in my truck
and starts in with.

917
00:57:26,285 --> 00:57:28,672
"You got it all wrong.
We're just friends."

918
00:57:28,768 --> 00:57:30,792
Then he stops once he sees

919
00:57:31,607 --> 00:57:33,870
the gun I got sitting on the dash. Oh!

920
00:57:35,683 --> 00:57:38,838
I look him in the eye and say. "She's
my wife. You find a new friend."

921
00:57:38,924 --> 00:57:40,238
You pulled a gun on a cop?

922
00:57:40,325 --> 00:57:41,638
Frank?

923
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:44,755
Frank. 777 just
passed milepost 61.

924
00:57:46,002 --> 00:57:47,162
Thank you. Connie.

925
00:57:47,249 --> 00:57:49,080
- You want to hear the kicker?
- Yes. I do.

926
00:57:50,327 --> 00:57:53,233
It wasn't even him that was texting
her. It was my sister-in-law.

927
00:57:54,767 --> 00:57:57,318
Anyway. By the time I got home.
His buddy's waiting for me.

928
00:57:57,405 --> 00:58:00,397
Just waiting to serve me
with this restraining order.

929
00:58:02,487 --> 00:58:03,878
Darcy wouldn't
even look at me.

930
00:58:07,206 --> 00:58:09,709
So I'm living
with my brother.

931
00:58:09,805 --> 00:58:12,758
There was a hearing today. The
judge ordered a 30-day extension.

932
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,676
It's like one day
everything is going okay.

933
00:58:19,366 --> 00:58:20,996
And the next. It's all
falling apart faster

934
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:22,272
than you can put
it back together.

935
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:24,554
Yeah.
Never too late. Though.

936
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:36,839
The plan to
derail this 39-car runaway train

937
00:58:36,926 --> 00:58:38,556
is just minutes away now.

938
00:58:38,642 --> 00:58:40,599
There's a tremendous
amount of activity going on.

939
00:58:40,685 --> 00:58:43,677
Will this train be
able to be stopped?

940
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,875
1206. Connie. We're just
passing milepost 6-2.

941
00:58:48,961 --> 00:58:50,314
Milepost 6-2, over.

942
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,954
Still a mile gap.
Maybe more.

943
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,709
We're not
gaining on her. Frank.

944
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:55,790
Hold on.

945
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,714
It's just like
the shooting range!

946
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,147
All right. Here we go! Come on!
Let's go! This is it! It's game time!

947
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:13,637
Remember. We're aiming
for the red circular button!

948
00:59:18,518 --> 00:59:19,554
Now!

949
00:59:21,884 --> 00:59:25,356
Hold your fire! You're shooting
the fuel cap. God damn it!

950
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:26,747
Hold your fire!

951
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:29,317
We were aiming to disable
it by firing shotgun rounds

952
00:59:29,403 --> 00:59:33,556
at a fuel stop safety switch,
and so some shots were fired.

953
00:59:33,642 --> 00:59:36,433
That safety
switch is a mighty small target.

954
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:38,840
And it's right
next to a fuel tank.

955
00:59:43,481 --> 00:59:45,313
We're not going to
catch it before Arklow.

956
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,267
Frank. You're closing the
gap. You should cut your speed.

957
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:50,597
Allow yourself some stopping
distance. Just in case.

958
00:59:50,684 --> 00:59:53,273
No can do. Connie. If we slow
down now. We'll never catch it.

959
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,760
Not before Stanton. Over.

960
00:59:54,846 --> 00:59:56,121
It's your call.

961
00:59:56,917 --> 01:00:00,120
However, we have now also learned
that two railroad employees

962
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:04,436
are now in pursuit of train
777 in a single locomotive.

963
01:00:04,522 --> 01:00:05,827
It is unclear
what their plan is...

964
01:00:05,922 --> 01:00:08,521
Connie Hooper for you.

965
01:00:08,598 --> 01:00:11,801
Did I or did I not tell you
to get 1206 off the main?

966
01:00:11,878 --> 01:00:13,230
I asked them nicely.

967
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,554
You're 100% sure that
derailer won't work?

968
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:23,914
Yes. 100%? No.

969
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,074
Which one is it?

970
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:29,792
50-50.
Pretty funny.

971
01:00:29,879 --> 01:00:31,912
And if it does?

972
01:00:31,998 --> 01:00:35,633
If it does. Then
we're a wreck on a wreck.

973
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:38,913
I'm here with FRA
official Gene Devereaux.

974
01:00:38,999 --> 01:00:41,032
This train is getting close.
How is this going to work?

975
01:00:41,118 --> 01:00:43,554
Basically,
it works like a ramp.

976
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:45,875
The train comes along,

977
01:00:45,961 --> 01:00:49,673
this piece here will lift the
flange and pull it outside the rail.

978
01:00:49,759 --> 01:00:53,634
That will cause the train to
flip over on its right-hand side.

979
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,235
Son of a bitch won't
even know what hit it.

980
01:01:03,281 --> 01:01:05,113
Train is about four minutes out!

981
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:06,513
Guys. Come on. Get it started!

982
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:08,191
Guys. Come on!

983
01:01:30,517 --> 01:01:32,109
It has not succeeded! What?

984
01:01:32,196 --> 01:01:33,433
What in the hell was that?

985
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:37,470
That was 10 million pounds
of train. Mr. Galvin!

986
01:01:37,557 --> 01:01:39,753
And this is the sound
of me saving your ass!

987
01:01:40,635 --> 01:01:41,824
Frank. Do you copy?

988
01:01:42,515 --> 01:01:43,915
Frank?

989
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:45,392
This is 1206. Over.

990
01:01:45,478 --> 01:01:47,473
You were right.
It barely bumped.

991
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:50,359
Jesus Christ.

992
01:01:58,521 --> 01:02:00,391
We're bringing you
live coverage right now

993
01:02:00,477 --> 01:02:03,191
on what could very well result
in one of the worst disasters

994
01:02:03,277 --> 01:02:06,269
in the history of
the state of Pennsylvania.

995
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:08,188
Now, the particulars
are still being examined,

996
01:02:08,274 --> 01:02:10,230
but authorities
are far more focused

997
01:02:10,317 --> 01:02:13,788
on the potential destruction
that would result if train 777

998
01:02:13,874 --> 01:02:15,188
were to derail in Stanton.

999
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,669
What did you mean about
being married once?

1000
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:26,438
Alice. My wife.
She died of cancer.

1001
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:28,663
- Four years ago.
- I'm sorry.

1002
01:02:28,758 --> 01:02:30,187
Me. Too.

1003
01:02:30,993 --> 01:02:32,153
Me. Too.

1004
01:02:34,714 --> 01:02:37,869
Every night. I'd come home.
Tell her about my day.

1005
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:41,350
Where I'd been.
What I hauled.

1006
01:02:44,314 --> 01:02:45,388
Who annoyed me.

1007
01:02:46,673 --> 01:02:48,342
Guess I would have made
the evening report. Huh?

1008
01:02:48,437 --> 01:02:50,346
Yes. You would have
made it. Definitely.

1009
01:02:52,274 --> 01:02:53,865
You should call your wife.

1010
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,750
I would. But it's her day
off. She's probably sleeping.

1011
01:02:57,836 --> 01:03:00,109
Don't make excuses.
Wake her up.

1012
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,353
Been calling for
the past two weeks.

1013
01:03:02,439 --> 01:03:03,427
She still hasn't
called me back.

1014
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,518
She won't.
You got to call her.

1015
01:03:05,594 --> 01:03:07,906
Don't you know how that
works? You quit too easy.

1016
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:16,901
Darcy!

1017
01:03:17,476 --> 01:03:18,829
Darcy!

1018
01:03:20,037 --> 01:03:22,876
I have been
calling and calling.

1019
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:25,993
What is wrong?

1020
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,301
As we told you earlier today,
those emergency evacuations

1021
01:03:29,397 --> 01:03:33,224
began early this morning as they
try to move people out of harm's way.

1022
01:03:33,396 --> 01:03:35,947
You get a sense of the perimeter
here. You see the firefighters...

1023
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:38,584
Hey. It's me.
Yeah. We're on our way.

1024
01:03:39,553 --> 01:03:41,107
Yeah. I know.
I'm watching it.

1025
01:03:57,957 --> 01:04:01,831
Two railroad employees are
presently in pursuit of train 777

1026
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:03,222
in a single locomotive.

1027
01:04:03,317 --> 01:04:06,108
No one seems exactly clear
on what their plans are

1028
01:04:06,195 --> 01:04:07,787
should they catch
up to that train.

1029
01:04:07,873 --> 01:04:09,062
It's Dad.

1030
01:04:09,158 --> 01:04:11,546
We have just learned that
railroad employee Frank Barnes,

1031
01:04:11,632 --> 01:04:15,027
a 28-year veteran of the freight
company responsible for the runaway,

1032
01:04:15,113 --> 01:04:18,384
and Will Colson, a conductor, are
now onboard another locomotive.

1033
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,467
We're on our way.

1034
01:04:19,554 --> 01:04:21,347
A single locomotive
trying to catch up

1035
01:04:21,433 --> 01:04:22,594
to the runaway train.
She's got to get dressed.

1036
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:24,224
And get this. They were
traveling... I can tell.

1037
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:25,346
She'll be ready
in a minute.

1038
01:04:25,432 --> 01:04:27,149
...at speeds of up to 70
miles an hour in reverse.

1039
01:04:27,235 --> 01:04:29,230
777 is now just miles away
from the significantly...

1040
01:04:29,316 --> 01:04:31,148
Come on. Darcy. Let's go.
Come on. Get dressed.

1041
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:33,066
...more populated
town of Stanton.

1042
01:04:36,595 --> 01:04:37,948
Let's go. Boys!

1043
01:04:57,396 --> 01:04:58,432
Okay.
You're getting close.

1044
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,993
The gap's at a mile and
777 is 10 miles to Stanton.

1045
01:05:01,069 --> 01:05:04,186
Now. Listen. Frank. I got a guy
here named Werner from the FRA.

1046
01:05:04,273 --> 01:05:06,181
Now. I'm inclined to defer to
your judgment here. But he...

1047
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:09,307
All right. Put him on. We could
use all the help we can get.

1048
01:05:10,832 --> 01:05:12,626
Just press this
and hold to talk.

1049
01:05:14,592 --> 01:05:17,306
It's about slowing 777
once you've tied on.

1050
01:05:17,392 --> 01:05:19,185
I know
conventional wisdom says

1051
01:05:19,272 --> 01:05:21,708
to just gun it in
the opposite direction.

1052
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:23,626
But you'll have
a better shot

1053
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:26,426
alternating full throttle
with dynamic braking.

1054
01:05:26,512 --> 01:05:28,747
Yeah. But we can't afford
to lose counterthrust.

1055
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:30,866
What you'll lose
in counterthrust

1056
01:05:30,952 --> 01:05:32,621
you'll compensate for
in tractive force.

1057
01:05:33,072 --> 01:05:34,261
Are you sure about that?

1058
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:39,833
Well. It's more of a hunch
based on some quick calculations.

1059
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:41,943
It's a hunch.

1060
01:05:42,988 --> 01:05:45,021
I'm 70 miles an hour
and he's giving us a hunch.

1061
01:05:45,117 --> 01:05:47,831
Okay. Thank you.
Put Connie back on. Please.

1062
01:05:47,908 --> 01:05:49,145
It's me, Frank.

1063
01:05:49,231 --> 01:05:51,945
Yeah. Connie. Does this guy
know what he's talking about?

1064
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:54,985
In a perfect world.

1065
01:05:56,117 --> 01:05:57,747
Yes. I'd say yes.

1066
01:05:57,834 --> 01:05:59,541
In a perfect world. Okay.

1067
01:05:59,637 --> 01:06:02,859
We have more now on that runaway
freight train in rural Pennsylvania.

1068
01:06:03,108 --> 01:06:05,746
They've devised an ambitious
plan to bring it to a stop.

1069
01:06:05,832 --> 01:06:08,508
A single locomotive
moves in from behind,

1070
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:12,583
catches up, hooks up and then
brakes in an effort to slow it down.

1071
01:06:14,588 --> 01:06:16,784
Passing milepost 7-6.
Connie. Over.

1072
01:06:17,033 --> 01:06:18,424
You're only
a half mile away.

1073
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:19,862
Half a mile. Out.

1074
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,624
Frank. Running in reverse. How are
you going to gauge our gap distance?

1075
01:06:25,271 --> 01:06:27,630
I could go out there.
I could signal you by hand.

1076
01:06:29,395 --> 01:06:30,431
At 70 mile an hour?

1077
01:06:30,507 --> 01:06:31,457
I'm asking.
Would it help?

1078
01:06:35,149 --> 01:06:37,345
All right.
Radio and hand signals.

1079
01:06:37,432 --> 01:06:39,311
We'll combinate.
And be careful.

1080
01:06:39,388 --> 01:06:40,500
I will.

1081
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:41,785
And take that
vest off. Too.

1082
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:43,540
Why?
Just take it off.

1083
01:06:43,627 --> 01:06:44,576
I don't want to
look out this window

1084
01:06:44,672 --> 01:06:46,628
and see you in that yellow
vest. It'll freak me out.

1085
01:07:04,907 --> 01:07:05,857
Come on. Will.

1086
01:07:09,031 --> 01:07:10,096
Pick up. Come on.

1087
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:11,342
This is Will.
Leave me a message.

1088
01:07:11,429 --> 01:07:12,666
Damn!

1089
01:07:17,988 --> 01:07:19,101
Ten cars. Frank!

1090
01:07:19,475 --> 01:07:20,779
Affirmative. Over.

1091
01:07:26,313 --> 01:07:27,502
All right.
Here she comes!

1092
01:07:32,028 --> 01:07:33,026
Three cars?

1093
01:07:33,793 --> 01:07:35,462
Three cars steady. Copy.

1094
01:07:38,435 --> 01:07:40,429
All right.
Steady, steady!

1095
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:49,981
Two cars?

1096
01:07:51,314 --> 01:07:53,309
Yeah. Two cars. Copy.

1097
01:07:53,386 --> 01:07:54,661
Steady. Over.

1098
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:00,060
Keep it coming.
Keep it coming!

1099
01:08:04,472 --> 01:08:05,776
Keep it coming!

1100
01:08:06,428 --> 01:08:07,857
Steady. Steady!

1101
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:12,019
Will Colson
is trying to hook up 1206

1102
01:08:12,106 --> 01:08:13,583
with 777.
Oh. My God.

1103
01:08:18,071 --> 01:08:20,257
Something has gone
terribly wrong.

1104
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,786
Will. What was that?

1105
01:08:29,186 --> 01:08:30,615
The grain car
blew a seal!

1106
01:08:32,111 --> 01:08:33,626
Are we tied off?

1107
01:08:35,304 --> 01:08:36,465
Will, what's going on?

1108
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:41,701
Right now we are looking
at live pictures of this rescue operation.

1109
01:08:42,152 --> 01:08:43,456
Are we tied off?

1110
01:08:44,549 --> 01:08:47,052
No. Frank. It didn't work.
Our knuckle closed!

1111
01:08:47,148 --> 01:08:49,747
Will. Use hand signals!
Hand signals!

1112
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:00,104
We tied on?

1113
01:09:00,267 --> 01:09:01,505
We're good! We're good!

1114
01:09:01,591 --> 01:09:02,742
What?

1115
01:09:09,551 --> 01:09:11,018
Oh. Shit.

1116
01:09:11,785 --> 01:09:13,425
Frank.
The pin didn't fall!

1117
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,219
Say again. The what?

1118
01:09:15,871 --> 01:09:17,463
Will. Are we tied on?

1119
01:09:17,549 --> 01:09:19,908
It's not going to work.
The pin didn't fall.

1120
01:09:19,985 --> 01:09:20,982
What?

1121
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:23,907
The pin didn't fall!
It's not locking!

1122
01:09:24,224 --> 01:09:25,940
All right. Well. Look.

1123
01:09:26,027 --> 01:09:29,019
Try and get down there. See
what you can do. Be careful!

1124
01:09:29,546 --> 01:09:30,860
Be careful.

1125
01:09:39,789 --> 01:09:40,824
Will!

1126
01:09:40,911 --> 01:09:43,864
It's not slowing
down. It's gaining speed right now.

1127
01:09:43,951 --> 01:09:45,859
He's reaching down,
trying to couple...

1128
01:09:54,951 --> 01:09:56,178
Will. Can you read me?

1129
01:10:09,825 --> 01:10:10,937
He's gone!

1130
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:17,986
Will Colson is down.
We do not see him.

1131
01:10:19,463 --> 01:10:21,132
Chopper 43,
can you zoom in?

1132
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:24,862
We do not see the conductor,
Colson. Come on. Baby.

1133
01:10:29,629 --> 01:10:32,103
Will. Can you read me?
Will!

1134
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:47,217
Chopper 43, zoom
in. There he is. Will Colson.

1135
01:10:51,063 --> 01:10:53,297
As he struggles
to pull himself up,

1136
01:10:53,384 --> 01:10:55,618
looks like Will Colson
is in trouble.

1137
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:04,930
The train is coupled.

1138
01:11:05,026 --> 01:11:08,498
I'm now being told that the
connection has been made.

1139
01:11:08,584 --> 01:11:11,058
It looks as though this
train is now attached.

1140
01:11:11,144 --> 01:11:15,019
1206 has been successfully
attached to 777.

1141
01:11:15,105 --> 01:11:17,858
But it looks like
Will Colson is injured.

1142
01:11:19,545 --> 01:11:21,492
You all right?

1143
01:11:22,825 --> 01:11:24,101
I'm great.

1144
01:11:25,348 --> 01:11:27,179
Hey. Hey. Don't touch that!
Don't touch that boot!

1145
01:11:28,186 --> 01:11:29,615
Here. Just wrap it up
with this.

1146
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:31,735
Wrap it real tight.
All around.

1147
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:33,413
You okay?

1148
01:11:33,499 --> 01:11:35,379
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

1149
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:40,059
Barnes and Colson
have caught up to the runaway train.

1150
01:11:40,145 --> 01:11:41,900
Darcy. Come on. Come on.

1151
01:11:41,986 --> 01:11:45,698
But the train continues to speed
in excess of 75 miles an hour,

1152
01:11:45,784 --> 01:11:46,897
heading to Stanton.

1153
01:11:50,023 --> 01:11:51,337
Connie. How far we got?

1154
01:11:51,423 --> 01:11:53,543
How far to Stanton? Over.

1155
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,216
4 miles.
You guys are doing great.

1156
01:11:57,302 --> 01:11:58,539
You're cutting
it close. Though.

1157
01:11:58,625 --> 01:11:59,930
How's Will?

1158
01:12:00,745 --> 01:12:03,612
He's...
He's different. Over.

1159
01:12:06,787 --> 01:12:08,570
Ready for
a little tug-of-war?

1160
01:12:09,386 --> 01:12:10,498
Let's do it.

1161
01:12:18,861 --> 01:12:21,728
Match our speed with theirs.

1162
01:12:28,422 --> 01:12:30,570
Frank. We're going to snap right
off. No. We're not. We're not.

1163
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:34,013
We're just stretching. That's
all. We're just stretching.

1164
01:12:38,904 --> 01:12:39,940
Here in Stanton,

1165
01:12:40,026 --> 01:12:43,220
the evacuation procedures
continue for the entire town.

1166
01:12:43,306 --> 01:12:47,612
This is the town where that mainline
train track turns into an elevated curve.

1167
01:12:47,698 --> 01:12:49,578
They say there is
virtually no chance

1168
01:12:49,664 --> 01:12:51,496
this speeding,
out-of-control train

1169
01:12:51,582 --> 01:12:53,098
will make it
through that curve.

1170
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,374
We should be slowing down.

1171
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,052
Which we're not.

1172
01:13:03,138 --> 01:13:04,855
Shoot.

1173
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:09,247
Go to the dynamic.
Alternate full throttle.

1174
01:13:20,784 --> 01:13:22,568
Christ! Those cab brakes
are getting a workout.

1175
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:25,138
... because of the
highly toxic nature of the cargo.

1176
01:13:25,225 --> 01:13:26,212
Come on. Frank.

1177
01:13:26,538 --> 01:13:28,092
Come on. Baby.

1178
01:13:31,218 --> 01:13:32,494
Ah!

1179
01:13:33,865 --> 01:13:35,055
What's our speed?

1180
01:13:35,179 --> 01:13:36,416
We're under 50.

1181
01:13:36,503 --> 01:13:38,258
Connie. How far away?

1182
01:13:38,344 --> 01:13:40,895
3 miles. FRA's got men on the
ground ready to hop onboard

1183
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:42,257
as soon as you
guys get it under 20.

1184
01:13:42,343 --> 01:13:43,935
All right. Tell them.
Be ready to hop. Over.

1185
01:13:52,499 --> 01:13:53,612
Shoot!

1186
01:14:01,619 --> 01:14:03,288
What is it?
We're gaining speed.

1187
01:14:03,384 --> 01:14:06,050
Consist is too heavy.
We're being dragged.

1188
01:14:14,978 --> 01:14:16,168
Connie!

1189
01:14:16,302 --> 01:14:17,491
I'm here. Frank.

1190
01:14:17,577 --> 01:14:19,246
We're going to be
coming in too hot.

1191
01:14:20,579 --> 01:14:21,653
Let them know.

1192
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:23,255
The limit on
that curve is 15.

1193
01:14:23,341 --> 01:14:27,215
I don't know if you can take it
much faster. Maybe 20. 25. Max?

1194
01:14:27,302 --> 01:14:29,805
We may not have a choice. Just
tell them it's going to be real hot.

1195
01:14:36,422 --> 01:14:37,698
What about the braking
on the freight cars?

1196
01:14:42,339 --> 01:14:43,327
Good. Good.

1197
01:14:43,423 --> 01:14:44,334
All right. I'm on it.

1198
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,444
Just sit down. No. No.
I've got it. Sit tight.

1199
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:49,052
I'll go out. Sit down.
No. In fact. Come here.

1200
01:14:49,139 --> 01:14:51,210
You sit here. I'll go out.

1201
01:14:51,296 --> 01:14:52,649
Just keep it at four.

1202
01:14:53,819 --> 01:14:55,132
You all right? Take it easy. Yeah.

1203
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:56,734
Hold that dynamic at a four. Four.

1204
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,096
Integrate it with the
throttle if you have to.

1205
01:14:58,182 --> 01:15:00,014
Hold it at a four.
Integrate the throttle.

1206
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,095
Burn the block out.
It doesn't matter.

1207
01:15:02,814 --> 01:15:04,416
Hey. Don't get
sentimental on me.

1208
01:15:04,895 --> 01:15:07,043
Makes me think I'm going to die.
Just hold that four.

1209
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,487
Come on. Frank.

1210
01:15:28,573 --> 01:15:30,530
AWVR officials have no comment.

1211
01:15:31,134 --> 01:15:34,452
Barnes is attempting to manually
brake the last car of 777.

1212
01:15:44,618 --> 01:15:47,533
He's actually running on top
of the grain cars and jumping...

1213
01:15:47,619 --> 01:15:49,288
Way to go. Frank.
Let's go. Frank.

1214
01:15:57,536 --> 01:15:59,770
Looks like 777
is slowing down.

1215
01:16:02,494 --> 01:16:04,498
We understand this is some sort of

1216
01:16:04,575 --> 01:16:06,570
an attempt to try
and stop the train.

1217
01:16:06,656 --> 01:16:08,488
Yes! Come on.
Come on! You can do it!

1218
01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:13,609
Will. How fast you going?

1219
01:16:17,301 --> 01:16:18,653
34.

1220
01:16:21,012 --> 01:16:22,441
All right.
We're dropping. 33.

1221
01:16:22,537 --> 01:16:25,376
The railroad
spokesman just confirmed he is...

1222
01:16:25,453 --> 01:16:26,930
Think it'll work?
...attempting to slow 777

1223
01:16:27,016 --> 01:16:29,289
By manually
braking each car.

1224
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:30,727
Theoretically.

1225
01:16:30,814 --> 01:16:33,365
Provided that locomotive's
independent brake holds out.

1226
01:16:40,778 --> 01:16:43,530
We continue to bring you live
coverage of this breaking news event

1227
01:16:43,616 --> 01:16:44,652
from the town of Stanton.

1228
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:47,328
Emergency management officials
have created this perimeter.

1229
01:16:52,133 --> 01:16:54,089
This is
the police. Get off the roof.

1230
01:16:54,175 --> 01:16:56,410
You are being asked to
evacuate for your own safety.

1231
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:31,481
Shit!

1232
01:17:33,974 --> 01:17:35,010
Frank!

1233
01:17:35,336 --> 01:17:37,091
Yeah. I hear you.
I hear you!

1234
01:17:37,178 --> 01:17:38,645
We just lost our brakes!

1235
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:42,884
Looks like
the brakes have blown.

1236
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:44,255
Shit!

1237
01:17:53,059 --> 01:17:56,089
Frank!
Frank. You all right?

1238
01:17:56,694 --> 01:17:58,449
I'm here. Will.
What happened?

1239
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:00,367
We're picking up
speed again.

1240
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:06,571
Can you still slow it down?
We're almost at the curve.

1241
01:18:06,658 --> 01:18:09,209
Frank. Our engine
block's overheated.

1242
01:18:10,772 --> 01:18:12,124
I don't think those
hand brakes are going to

1243
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:13,486
have the muscle
to stop this thing.

1244
01:18:13,572 --> 01:18:14,761
We're creeping up fast.

1245
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:17,169
All right. Well. Just
hang on to the independent.

1246
01:18:18,012 --> 01:18:19,604
I'll tell you when.

1247
01:18:38,929 --> 01:18:43,206
Elevated and strictly Class 2, speed
restricted to 15 miles per hour.

1248
01:18:43,292 --> 01:18:45,086
Impact with at least
three of these buildings

1249
01:18:45,172 --> 01:18:46,812
directly below
will be unavoidable,

1250
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:50,168
as will contact with all the
fuel storage tanks situated here.

1251
01:18:50,936 --> 01:18:53,045
Will? Will.

1252
01:18:53,774 --> 01:18:54,963
We're all right.
We're all right.

1253
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:56,565
But we're
picking up speed again.

1254
01:19:09,176 --> 01:19:10,212
Will!

1255
01:19:11,612 --> 01:19:14,479
We're coming into the curve!
Get ready!

1256
01:19:28,011 --> 01:19:30,639
Will!
Hit that independent!

1257
01:19:31,492 --> 01:19:33,564
Hit that independent
as hard as you can!

1258
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:41,850
Frank.
We're going to rip right off.

1259
01:19:42,253 --> 01:19:43,442
Got no choice.

1260
01:19:53,252 --> 01:19:54,959
Will! Hang on!

1261
01:20:03,571 --> 01:20:05,691
Hit it! Hit it again!

1262
01:20:06,966 --> 01:20:08,002
Now!

1263
01:20:33,406 --> 01:20:34,759
Frank. You all right?

1264
01:20:34,855 --> 01:20:37,521
We made it! We made it!
We're through the curve.

1265
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:42,757
777 made it. It
made it through the Stanton curve.

1266
01:20:42,853 --> 01:20:44,723
777 is through
the Stanton curve,

1267
01:20:44,809 --> 01:20:46,804
but by no means
out of trouble.

1268
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:50,688
777 is gaining speed. It is out
of control and has to derail.

1269
01:20:51,254 --> 01:20:53,038
Frank Barnes and
Will Colson will be

1270
01:20:53,133 --> 01:20:54,888
the victims of
the biggest rail disaster

1271
01:20:54,965 --> 01:20:56,394
in the history
of the northeast.

1272
01:20:58,648 --> 01:21:01,678
It looks like Frank Barnes
is making an all-out effort.

1273
01:21:02,254 --> 01:21:03,241
Good job.

1274
01:21:03,328 --> 01:21:06,799
This is a remarkable effort
now to get to the front of 777.

1275
01:21:12,573 --> 01:21:13,685
Frank!

1276
01:21:14,807 --> 01:21:17,771
We're at... We're at 60. And
we're going to hit 80 in no time!

1277
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:22,729
He's not going to make it.

1278
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,162
Looks like the
gap between cars has stopped him.

1279
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:27,409
You can do it!

1280
01:21:27,485 --> 01:21:31,245
But the train continues to speed
in excess of 75 miles an hour.

1281
01:21:31,609 --> 01:21:34,160
Frank! Frank!

1282
01:21:34,688 --> 01:21:36,596
Will. We got a problem here.

1283
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:40,490
I don't think I can make it.

1284
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:44,000
Oh. God.

1285
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:54,520
There's Ned!

1286
01:21:57,685 --> 01:21:59,958
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

1287
01:22:04,647 --> 01:22:06,441
Hello.
Ned. It's Connie.

1288
01:22:06,527 --> 01:22:08,646
I'm kind of busy right now.
Connie. I'll call you back.

1289
01:22:27,491 --> 01:22:28,604
Hey!

1290
01:22:33,284 --> 01:22:34,597
Come on!

1291
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:40,754
Hop in the back
of the truck!

1292
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,801
Hop in the back
of the truck!

1293
01:22:44,888 --> 01:22:47,880
Connie? Connie.
Is that truck for us?

1294
01:22:48,484 --> 01:22:50,728
Yes. It is. Will.
You can do this.

1295
01:22:50,805 --> 01:22:52,684
Will, you can do this!

1296
01:22:58,324 --> 01:22:59,484
Come on!

1297
01:23:12,124 --> 01:23:13,955
Looks like
he's trying to synchronize

1298
01:23:14,042 --> 01:23:16,717
the speed of the pickup
with the train.

1299
01:23:17,408 --> 01:23:20,640
Do it. You pussy!
Jump in the back!

1300
01:23:25,368 --> 01:23:27,036
Yes! Yes!

1301
01:23:27,123 --> 01:23:28,600
Yeah!

1302
01:23:30,882 --> 01:23:31,918
Yeah!

1303
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:39,926
And look at what's happening now.

1304
01:23:40,002 --> 01:23:41,959
The red pickup racing
to the front of 777.

1305
01:23:42,045 --> 01:23:43,474
Come on. Will.

1306
01:23:52,729 --> 01:23:53,879
Frank!

1307
01:23:55,404 --> 01:23:57,840
Go! Just go! Go. Go. Go!

1308
01:23:59,327 --> 01:24:00,842
Go. Go. Go!

1309
01:24:00,966 --> 01:24:02,482
Go. Go!

1310
01:24:13,683 --> 01:24:15,755
Ned Oldham is
running out of parallel road.

1311
01:24:16,483 --> 01:24:17,759
Come on. Will.

1312
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:19,149
Drive. Ned!

1313
01:24:19,245 --> 01:24:21,202
He will attempt to
board this train.

1314
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:42,041
Come on!
Shit!

1315
01:24:42,127 --> 01:24:43,278
God damn it!
I overshot it!

1316
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:48,035
Come on.

1317
01:24:48,524 --> 01:24:51,123
There it is. Kid! Do it!

1318
01:24:52,044 --> 01:24:55,151
Come on. Jump! Do it! Jump!

1319
01:25:13,487 --> 01:25:14,600
Yes!

1320
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:18,676
Go. Dad!

1321
01:25:24,679 --> 01:25:26,396
Yeah! Yeah!

1322
01:25:26,482 --> 01:25:29,560
Yeah! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1323
01:25:29,647 --> 01:25:30,951
Oh. My God!

1324
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:34,193
Go! Go. Will!

1325
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:37,597
Will Colson
successfully making it into the cab,

1326
01:25:37,683 --> 01:25:39,592
now in control of 777.

1327
01:26:01,045 --> 01:26:03,673
Chopper 43 over
this remarkable aftermath.

1328
01:26:03,759 --> 01:26:06,483
We're talking about the
heroic work of two men,

1329
01:26:06,799 --> 01:26:08,631
Frank Barnes and Will Colson.

1330
01:26:08,717 --> 01:26:11,633
Southern Pennsylvania will
always be indebted to them.

1331
01:26:53,964 --> 01:26:58,078
- Judas Priest.
- We did it! We did it!

1332
01:26:58,164 --> 01:27:01,549
I knew once we got you up
there. We'd do it. Ned Oldham.

1333
01:27:01,645 --> 01:27:04,311
It's all about precision.
Good job. Kid.

1334
01:27:04,762 --> 01:27:06,786
- Your foot's hurt. He cut his foot!
- I think it's broken.

1335
01:27:06,881 --> 01:27:09,193
He cut his foot!
Let's get some medics!

1336
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,840
Get over here. Kiddo.

1337
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:38,472
Ned!
You!

1338
01:27:38,558 --> 01:27:40,150
Ned. Were you worried?

1339
01:27:40,236 --> 01:27:42,595
Was I worried?
Nah. Not really.

1340
01:27:43,036 --> 01:27:45,789
It's all about precision. I wouldn't
have undertaken such a task...

1341
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:46,911
Just got off the line
with corporate.

1342
01:27:46,997 --> 01:27:47,995
Oh. Yeah?

1343
01:27:48,081 --> 01:27:49,750
"Debt of gratitude."
Blah. Blah. Blah.

1344
01:27:49,836 --> 01:27:52,157
Same here.
Felt pretty good. Actually.

1345
01:27:52,722 --> 01:27:54,151
Yeah. It did. Actually.

1346
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:56,712
...bringing it to
a successful conclusion.

1347
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,673
What was your first reaction when
you realized what was happening?

1348
01:28:00,759 --> 01:28:02,878
I felt I was in
my comfort zone.

1349
01:28:03,243 --> 01:28:04,547
What did they say
about your job?

1350
01:28:04,643 --> 01:28:06,638
They said it's mine
if I want to keep it.

1351
01:28:09,515 --> 01:28:10,867
They'd be stupid
not to give it to you.

1352
01:28:10,963 --> 01:28:13,389
Yeah.
That's what I told them.

1353
01:28:15,758 --> 01:28:17,791
Said they better think about
giving me a better one. Too.

1354
01:28:18,635 --> 01:28:20,189
- How about me?
- How about you?

1355
01:28:20,275 --> 01:28:22,951
As you can see, the result
was a positive. Ned...

1356
01:28:27,362 --> 01:28:30,872
Do we have any better of an
idea as to how this happened?

1357
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:32,598
Well, the thing that happened...

1358
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:35,638
Thank you very much, Ned.
Everybody, this is Ned Oldham.

1359
01:28:35,715 --> 01:28:36,952
To answer that
last question...

1360
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:39,753
Sorry. I wonder if
you can help me.

1361
01:28:40,836 --> 01:28:42,026
- Connie?
- I can't decide

1362
01:28:42,121 --> 01:28:43,953
which one of you
I'm going to kiss first?

1363
01:28:44,039 --> 01:28:45,152
Me.

1364
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:48,384
Problem solved.

1365
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:50,148
Go get him. Connie.

1366
01:28:50,235 --> 01:28:51,395
All right. Bring it on.

1367
01:28:51,481 --> 01:28:54,790
... to Frank Barnes and Will Colson,

1368
01:28:57,753 --> 01:29:00,074
the engineer and the
conductor whose actions...

1369
01:29:00,161 --> 01:29:01,196
Your daughters?

1370
01:29:06,797 --> 01:29:08,226
Chopper 43, over and out.

1371
01:29:09,305 --> 01:30:09,819
