00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,130
Hello.

3
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,810
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

4
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,010
Listen! Children are asleep.
So, let's be quiet.

5
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,050
Thank you very much.

6
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,130
Thank you very much.

7
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,970
This is not much.

8
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,410
Thank you very much.

9
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,490
- Please, have some food.
- Thank you very much.

10
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,410
Try this one.

11
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:44,770
Is it good?

12
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,810
It is good, isn't it?

13
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:47,850
Is it good?

14
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,490
- It is good.
- It is good.

15
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:51,810
It is good.

16
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,690
Well...

17
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,890
Actually...

18
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,050
It is hard to talk about those things.

19
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,050
It is not just about us.

20
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,250
Akiko is our eldest.

21
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,570
They have tried to tell us...

22
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,770
that what she has is cerebral palsy,

23
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,490
but we knew better

24
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,490
She was born ill and she still is.

25
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,210
She will never get better.

26
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,170
But our family bonds are strong.

27
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,690
Akiko is... our treasure.

28
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,010
We have six children,

29
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,970
and we all work hard
to take care of Akiko.

30
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,410
It takes five hours a day to feed her,

31
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,130
but she brings us closer as a family.

32
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,970
When you meet her, you'll see.

33
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,410
She is a beautiful soul.

34
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,570
We don't want to bring attention
to our family...

35
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,330
but we don't have a choice.

36
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,010
I drive a truck for Chisso.

37
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,290
For Chisso!

38
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,770
But it's not enough to take care
of a family with the needs we have.

39
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,210
- We thank you for your kindness.
- Not at all.

40
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,170
If you don't mind...

41
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,090
Can we take some photos
of Akiko tomorrow?

42
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,210
Well really, that kind of thing...

43
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,170
...you'll have to excuse us

44
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,570
I'm sorry. No.

45
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,250
I'm sorry.

46
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,290
- I will make your beds.
- Thank you.

47
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,890
- Please! There's nothing much left but...
- Thank you.

48
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,130
Excuse me! Excuse me!

49
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,170
He seems that he cannot fall asleep.

50
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,650
Do you have anything to drink?

51
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,450
A drink?
Just one minute.

52
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,050
- He loves whiskey for sure.
- Probably.

53
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,050
Whiskey.

54
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,130
- Good.
- Good.

55
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,050
- Good night.
- Good night.

56
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,330
Last night I rode my bicycle
all the way up to Tsunagi...

57
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,250
...because I heard about one family.

58
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,850
At first, they didn't want to let me in.

59
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,250
I asked them why...

60
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,930
they haven't been seen
in the neighbourhood lately.

61
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:09,570
I could see the shame on their faces.

62
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:15,010
It turns out their young boy
was very sick with Minamata disease.

63
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:20,490
I asked them to join us,
that we wanted help.

64
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,370
They considered but ultimately
their shame won out and they declined.

65
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:31,490
They love their son just as they should.

66
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,090
In all cases of Minamata,
there is someone to blame.

67
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,690
The suffering is caused by an evil...

68
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,570
...that we know as a fact!

69
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,410
So, here we are.

70
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,690
We have a choice.

71
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,090
We can let the world know.

72
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,330
If we are loud enough, they will listen.

73
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,730
Accept your responsibility!

74
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,610
Come on.

75
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,850
Accept your responsibility!

76
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,610
Is he alone?

77
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,610
I think so.

78
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,730
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

79
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:26,690
Is this yours?

80
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,890
How do we turn it to photos?

81
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,490
Aren't you afraid of touching me?

82
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,490
Thank you.

83
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,530
Thank you.

84
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,170
This way.

85
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,450
Put your stuff here.

86
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,450
It's for my aunt.

87
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,170
Thank you very much.

88
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:04,410
If human beings are still
the masters of creation...

89
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:07,850
we have to overthrow this poisoned world.

90
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:09,970
Is this civilisation?

91
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:14,250
Is this the so-called
period of rapid growth?

92
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:18,170
But done at the cost
of sacrificing countless lives?

93
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:21,090
Our beautiful blue ocean is now made
into a deadly sea by those people.

94
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:26,490
So, if you are a human being,
please stand up...

95
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,570
and fight!

96
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:32,330
Remember, we never wanted a war.

97
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:35,410
But we have to fight.

98
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:39,570
Let's make this the last battle for humanity.

99
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,850
Please stand up!

100
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:44,330
Go! Go!

101
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:47,210
What are you doing?

102
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,330
Chisso is winning back
the support of the people...

103
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:22,810
because we're influencing
student activists...

104
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:25,650
who are acting violently
against Chisso personnel.

105
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,730
This is not who we are.

106
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:32,210
Chisso are the ones acting violently.

107
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,850
We need to stay together on this
or we'll lose.

108
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:36,730
You know we'll lose!

109
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:39,410
We've offered good terms.

110
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:43,170
Chisso are promising
compensation will be quick.

111
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:46,610
We don't want
any more fighting in the town...

112
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:49,370
or shame brought to Minamata.

113
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,530
Chisso is behind this.

114
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:53,690
You are blind to it.

115
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:55,210
That's not true!

116
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:58,130
Is your goal to have Chisso
move somewhere else?

117
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,650
That's what they'll do
and where will our town be then?

118
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:03,010
This is not just about this town.

119
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:05,530
It's about big companies all over the world

120
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,730
invading the towns of
good, hard-working people,

121
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:11,090
and polluting their existence.

122
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,890
It's happened before...

123
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,490
and it will happen again!

124
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,210
Don't get so emotional!

125
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:20,850
Calm down!

126
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:23,730
Don't cause any trouble.

127
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:26,530
We understand how you feel.

128
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:29,690
We are all in the same pain.

129
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:33,250
But we all want it to end.

130
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:38,130
The signatures speak for themselves.

131
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,490
The people have spoken!

132
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:43,770
This is the right way
to settle the matter...

133
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:45,330
for all.

134
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,050
No more fighting!

135
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:51,010
May we see the book?

136
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:54,050
That's not necessary.

137
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:56,890
Have you pressed your signature
on this document?

138
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,050
No.

139
00:58:58,450 --> 00:58:59,450
And you?

140
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:02,850
And you?

141
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:09,650
They have overwhelming
signatures of support in the book...

142
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,890
yet they won't show it.

143
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:15,530
Do we believe this is fair?

144
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,930
Let us see the book!

145
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,770
Show us! Show us!

146
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:30,250
That's my signature. I never pressed it!

147
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:34,370
That guy is dead. How could he have signed?

148
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,770
You're right. He is dead!

149
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,250
What's going on here?

150
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:39,770
Tell us!

151
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,490
You're full of lies!

152
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,130
Hello.

153
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:01,610
- Welcome.
- Sorry for the intrusion.

154
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,690
Excuse us.

155
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,050
Hello.

156
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:13,850
Hello.

157
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,330
Thank you.

158
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:22,330
Let's eat together.

159
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:32,010
Good, right?

160
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:01,130
Mr. Eugene, are you married?

161
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,330
He has two children.

162
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,410
Does he have photos of them?

163
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:26,010
Unfortunately, he hasn't got any photos of them.

164
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:06,450
Let's go.

165
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,970
I'll go out for a while.
Don't get worried.

166
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:17,050
I'll give you a bath soon, Akiko.

167
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:45,410
You're a good girl.

168
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,890
That way, we can't interfere.

169
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,250
- You are Yamazaki Mitsuo, right?
- We will search the place.

170
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:00,810
What?

171
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:02,930
- Get the children inside.
- Don't get in our way.

172
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:04,850
Go. Go.

173
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:10,850
Don't take photos!

174
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:12,170
Don't resist!

175
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:14,570
Don't resist!

176
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,810
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

177
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:30,450
Papa!

178
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:32,490
They're gone.

179
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:35,450
Papa!

180
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:36,610
Everything is okay.

181
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:39,530
Mama!

182
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,450
Papa!

183
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:43,450
Mama!

184
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:45,810
Mama!

185
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:26,810
Bring water.

186
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:56,330
Shigro.

187
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:41,410
Some people may come and go
with the best of intentions...

188
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,450
but we can't count on them.

189
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:46,370
This is our fight.

190
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:49,290
Why do you think Chisso are hitting us...

191
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:53,890
harder and harder?

192
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:57,610
Why do you think they're getting
bolder and bolder?

193
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:01,410
You know why.

194
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:05,850
They can threaten us...

195
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:09,850
but we are going
to the shareholders meeting...

196
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,570
Hello.

197
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,290
I'm not good at public speaking.

198
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:39,650
I believe that a picture
worths a thousand words.

199
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:56,810
I want to help you,
but I need your help too.

200
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:10,250
I want to spend some
precious time with your families.

201
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:17,730
If I did this,

202
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,130
I will be able to help you

203
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:22,810
to win your fight.

204
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:59,970
Does anyone agree to be photographed?

205
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:37,890
Thank you.

206
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:43,250
Are you drunk?

207
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:54,650
You are murderers!

208
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,850
How many people are outside?

209
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:29,890
Over 500.

210
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:31,170
500?

211
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:32,050
Yes.

212
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:22,850
Mr. President.

213
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:26,570
We know there is verdict
that will arrive soon.

214
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:33,290
We hope that Chisso will accept
responsibility for its negligence.

215
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:38,650
We are not here for luxuries.

216
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:42,130
Just to know that we will be looked after

217
01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:45,050
and able to die in peace.

218
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:50,530
If you are human,
listen to what we are saying.

219
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:03,090
I and Sadae Ogata.

220
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,130
I understand that you don't know who I am.

221
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:09,450
But you should.

222
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:14,490
Both of my daughters fell ill.

223
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:19,450
Both suffered more than I can imagine
anyone suffering, let alone a child.

224
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:25,570
My eldest daughter suffered
from convulsions for months.

225
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:31,090
So much pain that she couldn't cry.

226
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:35,810
She is dead now.

227
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:40,410
And my other daughter, Miyuki...

228
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:46,890
will never be able
to spend a day without care.

229
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:52,890
My husband and I cry often.

230
01:26:56,970 --> 01:27:02,770
We weep because we fear
for what will happen...

231
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:09,050
when we are no longer able...

232
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:10,850
to take care of her.

233
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:22,410
Mr. President...

234
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:27,490
You've got nothing to say?

235
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:32,770
You are a human being too, right?

236
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,410
We are the same, and yet...

237
01:27:36,930 --> 01:27:38,730
how can we be this different?

238
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:40,930
How can we?

239
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:52,970
I am sorry. I truly am.

240
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:20,570
What happened to you...

241
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:22,610
What you have gone through...

242
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:25,290
brings sorrow in our hearts.

243
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,330
Please forgive us.

244
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:47,170
My child also has Minamata disease.

245
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:50,050
He is nine years old.

246
01:28:51,370 --> 01:28:53,050
I work on the boats still...

247
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:56,650
when the fishermen allow me to...

248
01:28:58,370 --> 01:28:59,690
but because of my symptoms...

249
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:02,250
they don't want me on their boats.

250
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:06,850
So, it's my wife that needs to work.

251
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:11,450
She works on the boats sometimes...

252
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:14,130
and many nights she is forced
to take care of both of us.

253
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:19,370
She can't do that forever.

254
01:29:22,370 --> 01:29:23,490
Can she?

255
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:28,490
Mr. President.

256
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:33,810
We know that you will pay
for the old victims...

257
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:39,370
but you must pay the same
for the new victims as well.

258
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:41,330
It's your responsibility!

259
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:45,010
Am I wrong?

260
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:53,770
Mr. Uyishi, can I have a moment?

261
01:30:57,450 --> 01:31:01,810
Thank you all for coming
and speaking with me.

262
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:07,970
Your plight brings me much sadness.

263
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:21,890
But we've added up
the costs of your demands...

264
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:25,290
- However...
- We simply cannot pay.

265
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:28,810
Unfortunately... this is our final answer.

266
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:31,810
I can't take this anymore!

267
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:34,770
Kyushi! Kyushi!

268
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:37,530
They don't believe we're in pain.

269
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:47,250
This blood is on your hands!

270
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:54,410
Kyushi!

271
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:01,850
Are you okay?

272
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:33,250
Can I move Akiko's legs?

273
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:44,810
Excuse me.

274
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:53,130
Can I move Akiko's left hand?

275
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:54,290
Yes.

276
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:57,250
Akiko, I will move your hand

277
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:28,850
We have to pay.

278
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:32,650
Somehow we will find a way.

279
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:57,810
We must.

280
01:40:15,770 --> 01:40:16,850
We won!

281
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:29,410
Today, we have won the battle.

282
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:33,530
But the war persists.

283
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:36,410
We must continue to fight.

284
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:40,890
To fight for our children...

285
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:47,090
so their children have something...

286
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:49,450
that they can fight for.

287
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:54,210
But all of you here...

288
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:57,010
and the people who stood with us...

289
01:40:57,770 --> 01:41:01,410
have taught me that this a fight

290
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:04,290
we can win!

291
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:12,370
Go home tonight

292
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:17,530
and find some happiness with your families.

293
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:23,050
Because tomorrow we have more to do.

294
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:28,330
To fight for those that cannot.

294
01:41:29,305 --> 01:42:29,637
