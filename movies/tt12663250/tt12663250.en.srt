TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR SECURITY VIDEO RECORDING

4
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,701
Nothing wrong with it, right?

5
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,085
What the hell?

6
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,609
- Are you drunk?
- Call the cops now!

7
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,720
I never could've imagined

8
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,013
that you'd be a mole.

9
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,724
Please don't do it.

10
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,644
Sung-geun, Yong-soo, Victor...

11
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,897
- All dead. Because of you.
- Please don't.

12
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,941
You're gonna tell me
who's behind all this?

13
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,568
Hurry up! Spit it out!

14
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,280
I'm sorry.

15
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,797
Freeze!

16
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,328
It's me. I'm folding.

17
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,954
Clean up, and don't look for me.

FOUR YEARS LATER, SEOUL

19
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,001
<i>Well after midnight,
Chairman Lee of Sang-in Group</i>

20
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,463
is still being questioned for charges
of bribery and stock manipulation.

21
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,383
<i>According to the Prosecutor's Office,</i>

22
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,094
<i>if Chairman Lee continues
to deny the charges against him,</i>

23
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,389
<i>officials may be forced
to issue a warrant for his arrest.</i>

24
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,312
Are you tired?

25
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,481
Do you need a break maybe?

26
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,442
Just be honest with me for a minute.
Can you do that?

27
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,154
Why are you so obsessed with nailing me?

28
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,491
What? Nailing you?

29
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,494
If you committed a crime,
you should pay for it.

30
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,873
It seems like everyone else
is scared to even touch you,

31
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,126
but I'm definitely not.

32
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,129
So you just want to put me behind bars?

33
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,381
Yeah.

34
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,635
Do you have what it takes?

35
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,722
I'm gonna give it my best shot.

36
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,195
Close it.

37
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,116
We've got a problem here.

38
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,744
There's been a serious violation.

39
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,955
What violation?

40
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:42,295
Your investigators entered
their offices illegally.

41
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,505
I apologize.

42
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,925
It looks like
we walked right into their trap.

43
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,220
They haven't said anything
about it yet,

44
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,056
but as soon as we try to arrest him,
they'll use it against us.

45
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,727
No one in this room
is going to say a single word.

46
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,064
So whatever happens, keep your mouth shut.

47
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,569
Say it never happened.

48
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,280
You understand me? Huh?

49
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,619
I can't. I can't do that.

50
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,222
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Of course.

51
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,456
After all the work we did?

52
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,416
We committed a crime to catch a criminal!

53
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:26,130
Now we've sunk to their level.
Just actions preserve justice.

54
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,551
Get the camera! Camera!

55
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,096
Chairman Lee,
how do you feel right now?

56
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,057
We're over here!

57
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,600
Chairman Lee!

58
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,185
Chairman Lee, excuse me.

59
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,365
I gave you my card earlier,
but you threw it out in the restroom.

60
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,160
My apologies. I didn't think I'd need it.

61
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:57,994
Take it.

62
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,624
I promise you that
you'll be back here soon. I guarantee it.

PROSECUTOR HAN JI-HOON

64
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,796
I like your style.

65
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,382
You've got attitude.

66
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,552
Call me if you get fired.

67
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,470
I can help you find a job.

68
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,682
What is that?

69
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,642
Is that blood?

70
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,774
There.

71
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,236
Nice bow, son.

72
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,535
Chairman Lee,
what were you talking about?

73
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,953
Chairman Lee!

74
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,830
One last comment.

75
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,209
Wait, sir!

76
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,877
Thanks, please come again.

77
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,838
- Hey, miss.
- Yeah. Coming.

78
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,503
- Can I get a lemon soda?
- A lemon soda?

79
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,218
Excuse me. Could you clean up our table?

80
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,053
Yes. I'll be right there!

81
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,471
Have you decided?

82
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,235
One beef, two ox blood stews.

83
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,766
Coming right up.

84
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,684
Ji-hoon.

85
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,769
One beef and two ox bloods at two.

86
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,645
Hey.

87
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,949
What? What is it?

88
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,033
Huh?

89
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,953
- Oh, nothing. Eat up. Come on.
- Yeah, go ahead.

90
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,121
- Eat up.
- Mmm.

the prosecution's investigative methods</i>

95

101
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,566
I'm okay.

102
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,445
That's right. Take this opportunity
to open up your own law practice.

103
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:56,946
Mom.

104

Administration
of NIS prosecutors, well...

109
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,686
It involves legal advice, assistance,

110
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,480
interior reviews, that kind of thing.

111
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,692
Sounds impressive,
but most people do all that themselves,

112
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,402
so we don't really do much work.

113

No, no. Don't get up.

114
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,412
Have a smoke.

Don't worry. No one comes here.

117
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,752
Ah, no. Thanks. I don't smoke.

118

Ah.

119
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,842
So you're pretty straight-laced, huh?

120
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,095
You can relax here, okay?

121
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,724
All that clenching of fists,
gritting of teeth...

122
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,726
God! Exhausting.

- Please.

126
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,321
Don't talk about the past.

127
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,032
They say the job makes the man.

128
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,284
And I've changed.

00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,257
Good idea. You should definitely go, hah.

165
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,386
Ma'am. This man is no ordinary prosecutor.

166
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:52,308
This is the guy
who took on Sang-in Group. He's a shark.

167
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,018
It was like David and Goliath.

168
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,563
Oh, wait a second.

169
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,940
And you even speak Chinese, right?

170
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,859
You said you trained in Beijing.

171
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,779
If I could get reinstated
to the position I had before,

172
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,697
then I'll go.

173
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,042
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

174
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,037
<i>we will soon be arriving
at Shenyang Taoxian International Airport.</i>

175
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,580
<i>The temperature in Shenyang...</i>

176
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,263
<i>Shenyang has long been</i>

177
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,710
<i>the center of East Asia's power struggle
over North Korea.</i>

178
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,755
<i>Intelligence agents
from neighboring countries</i>

179
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,008
are still waging a cold war
from within city limits.

180
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,176
Because of that,

181
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,554
intel related to activities
in Shenyang is highly classified.

182
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,180
And with...

183
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,226
black teams engaged
in a number of secret assignments,

184
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,523
it's become an unwritten rule
to overlook Shenyang in internal reviews.

185
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,401
So have any problems come up there?

186
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,114
We've just learned that the last few
months of reports from Shenyang

187
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,909
are completely fabricated.

188
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,621
We have no choice but to order a review.

189
00:15:55,704 --> 00:16:00,042
To find out what's behind the reports
and if there's any illegal activity.

190
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,880
<i>That's what we want you to find out
in Shenyang.</i>

191
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,384
I'm busy. I'm at the airport right now.

192
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,804
I'm not flying anywhere.

193
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,307
Oh, will you just stop it?

194
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,312

TECHMON INC
MANAGER HAN JI-HOON

196
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,693
Yeah. Who knows?

197
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,736
Some jerk is coming in from Seoul.

198
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,946
It's so annoying.

199
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,283
Oh. Oh, uh...

200
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,702
TECHMON INC
MANAGER HAN JI-HOON

201
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,248
I mean, listen, they reached out to us
literally this morning, you know.

202
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,667
And they didn't say anything
except that you were coming

203
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,044
We had no time to get ready.
We're blindsided.

204
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,506
Those guys in Seoul makes you wanna...

205
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,093
I mean, it's about time
they got a taste of the real world.

206
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,180
All right.

207
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,725
Not what you expected?

208
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,353
This place isn't the typical Chinese city
that most people think of

209
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,188
like Beijing or Shanghai.

210
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,024
It's a city of heavy industry

211
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,735
with steelworks and chemical plants
on the outskirts.

212
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,988
Air's filled with chimney smoke
from the factories

213
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,199
and the crows
are always circling above it.

214
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,285
- And spies too, right?
- Huh?

215
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,289
I heard this city has the most spies
of any in the region.

216
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,207
With North Korea next door,

217
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,335
you get spies
from China, Japan, the US, Russia.

218
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,339
They say everyone here is either a spy
or some kind of government agent.

219
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,467
Who said that? Headquarters?

220
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,634
Is it true?

221
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,179
<i>007? Mission Impossible?</i>

222
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:42,561
Man! You've got some high expectations.
Hope you're not disappointed.

SAMJIN TRAVEL AGENCY

224
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,079
SAMJIN TRAVEL AGENCY

225
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,164
Welcome to the Shenyang branch

226
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,500
of Korea's National Intelligence Service.

227
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,223
Ms. Wang, get him some tea.

228
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,050
Oh, Mr. Chang!
How can I help you?

229
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,971
"Fang Defeng"?

230
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,474
Your pronunciation.
You could pass as Chinese.

231
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,143
- Not your real name, is it?
- Of course not.

232
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,022
How long have you pretended
this is a travel agency?

233
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,149
I'm not sure.

234
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,236
I know it was like this
when I got here three years ago.

235
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,655
Oh. And it's not a front.

236
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,491
As you can see,
it's a real working company.

237
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,451
We mainly do tours to Mt. Baekdu,

238
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,913
but with economy in the toilet,
we don't get a lot of customers.

239
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,623
And what about those employees?

240
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,585
Uh, those two ladies
are both real travel agents.

241
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,564
But that girl with the short hair
and that sleazy-looking guy work for us.

242
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,965
Hey, you two, say hi.

243
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,592
He's that crack prosecutor from Seoul.

244
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,515
Hey, where are the paper cups?

245
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,100
They're down below.

246
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,647
Uh, not the best manners.
Must be something in the water.

247
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,566
Please excuse them.

248
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,111
"Wei Longping."
Is that the Branch Manager Ji Kang-in?

249
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,696
Yeah. Yep. Right.

250
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,197
And where is he now?

251
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,658
Uh, he's actually on a business trip.

252
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,952
Where did he go?

253
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,790
I'm afraid
we have to keep that confidential for now.

254
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,793
Don't you understand why I'm here?

255
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,342
I want full reports on
all the agents' activities, transfers of...

256
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,636
Sorry. Excuse me.

257
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,515
Hey, Mr. Kim!

258
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,767
Why is it so hard to get ahold of you?

259
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,936
Is that right?

260
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,565
You better not be lying to me
like last time.

261
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,941
Okay. Okay.

262
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,652
You think I won't pay you back?

263
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,156
Come on. Okay, okay.

264
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,575
All right, I'll see you then.

265
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,745
All right. Never work on an empty stomach.

266
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,580
Let's go out
for an early dinner, shall we?

267
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,582
Let me give you
the Shenyang culinary tour.

268
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,335
- Let's see here...
- Where's the restroom?

269
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,045
Down the hall on the left.

270
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,672
Wait a second. Take the key with you.

271
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,696
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

272
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,032
Where is everybody off to?

273
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,742
Come on, get out.

274
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,704
When an inspector asks where you're going,
you should answer him right away. Got it?

275
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,831
We're gonna be late.

276
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,754
We got an urgent call from Manager Ji.
Okay? Now get out.

277
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,966
Since when does an urgent call
require this much cash?

278
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,885
I hear Manager Ji
is quite the habitual gambler.

279
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,804
Did he get cleaned out today?

280
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,723
- Great. Let's go together.
- Excuse me, sir!

281
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,226
- I'm gonna introduce myself.
- Wait, wait. Oh!

282
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,894
Sir, come on. Please get out right now.

283
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,896
- You really can't do this.
- Here.

284
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,877
- So he's a tough guy, huh?
- Please don't do this.

285
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,587
- This is not the restroom.
- Dives right in.

286
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,821
Jeong-dae, unlock the door...

287
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,504
Jeez. Well, whatever.

288
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,991
Open the door! Hey, hey!

289
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,702
Jae-gyu! Jae-gyu! Hey! Hey!

290
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,412
Hui-won, stop!

291
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,247
Shit.

292
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,359
Who's he?

293
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,991
I'm Prosecutor Han Ji-hoon.
I was sent here as an inspector.

294
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,494
Go ahead.

295
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,084
Wait. What are you doing?

296
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,795
- Let go of me. Let go.
- Dude, just put it on.

297
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,149
- You do that side.
- Raise your arms.

298
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,027
- Why do I need to wear this?
- Can you stop talking?

299
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,135
God, the dust.

300
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,473
What's going on? Is this a party?
Why so many people, huh?

301
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,018
Look at that. You even brought a civilian?

302
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,812
He's not here. Just lead the way.

303
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,896
Ugh.

304
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,900
Well, first things first.
Give me the money, okay?

305
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:52,871
Oh. Okay.

306
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,557
If the goods are damaged,
I'm not gonna be happy at all.

307
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,559
That's not my responsibility.

308
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,853
You should be
asking yourself that question.

309
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,164
Professor Wang, are you screwing with me?

310
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,999
Give us Room 39.

311
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,420
What the hell is this bullshit?

312
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,214
Okay, then. You guys work it out.
I'm out of here!

313
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,969
Wang, you stupid asshole.

314
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:49,886
Tell us!

315
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,054
Where is he?

316
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,433
Look.

317
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,728
Tell me what's going on here.

318
00:23:58,812 --> 00:23:59,892
<i>Shots fired.</i>

319
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,523
Get in the car now and stay down.

320
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,035
Hold your fire.

321
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,805
Threat neutralized.

322
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,641
TEXTILE FACTORY THREE

323
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,278
No need to check. They're North Koreans.

324
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,997
This rat had his escape all planned out.

325
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,333
He had another car parked in the back.

326
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,047
Why did you do it?

327
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:50,965
I'm really sorry.

328
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,761
They threatened
to kill my wife and kids. I had no choice.

329
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,099
Someone made you play both sides
and set up a firefight?

330
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,182
Who?

331
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,018
I just...

332
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,440
I really can't... can't tell you that.

333
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,111
Okay.

334
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,194
I understand.

335
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,948
No!

336
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,241
Wait!

337
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,659
Please don't do it.

338
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,804
- We've known each other...
- Stop. What are you doing?

339
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,913
You can't just threaten someone with...

340
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,630
Fall out.

341
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,842
Where are we going?

342
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,303
Huh? Where?

343
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,764
Please, Yaksha! I'm sorry!

344
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,851
Please! Please don't do it!

345
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,269
No!

346
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,070
Hey. Turn your head?

347
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,992
Hey. Hey.

348
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,286
Ouch, my head.

349
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,663
- Hey.
- Damn it.

350
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,667
I'm cold.

351
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,006
Where the hell am I?

352
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,759
Get up.

353
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,428
- Hey.
- Leave me alone.

354
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:11,897
Open up!

355
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,903
Open up! It's the police!

356
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,323
Open the door!

357
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,587
Oh...

358
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,089
Freeze!

359
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,341
He might jump. I'll go downstairs.

360
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,761
Hey.

361
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,889
Stay back! Stay back!

362
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:45,973
Stay there!

363
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,684
Stop! Stop!

364
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,477
Stop right there!

365
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,024
Come here!

366
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,155
Come here! Let's go down and talk.

367
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,114
I didn't do it.

368
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,533
Come back here!
Let's go down and talk.

369
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,708
Stop, come back!

370
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,627
Wait, don't!

371
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,181
Come on, get him!

372
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,266
What are you doing? Hurry up!

373
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,227
Hurry up! Hey! Stop!

374
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,188
That way!

375
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,408
Hey!

376
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,472
Son of a bitch.

377
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,149
I figured you'd get caught like an idiot.

378
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,068
But you made it.

379
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,862
I don't like your games.

380
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,031
You did pretty good for a nerd.

381
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,407
Do you workout by any chance?

382
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,410
What are you, a gangster? A hoodlum?

383
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,371
Both.

384
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,585
I don't know what it is
you came here to inspect,

385
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,629
but I really don't have time for it.

386
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,342
I'll have Hong write up a nice,
squeaky-clean report for you.

387
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,096
Then you can take it and leave quietly.

388
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,806
Not a chance.

389
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,892
I'm gonna write up a report

390
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,646
with every single thing I saw
and experienced today, in great detail.

391
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,315
You get the death penalty
for drug crimes here.

392
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,485
- I'm going to call the cops now.
- Go ahead.

393
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,155
I'm used to dealing
with thugs just like you.

394
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,325
I guess
I won't even need to call.

395
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,381
<i>Please respond.</i>

396
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,695
<i>Be careful of the leader there.</i>

397
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,530
<i>Branch Manager Ji Kang-in.</i>

398
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,367
He has run several foreign operations,

399
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,454
<i>and every time, he's a headache
for the Ministry.</i>

400
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,748
Because they always
have to clean up after him.

401
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,792
But one way or another,
he always gets the job done.

402
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,755
<i>So the higher-ups give him free rein.</i>

403
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,966
<i>His nickname is Yaksha?</i>

404
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,636
A hideous, violent demon that eats people.

405
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,017
<i>But it's also called a guardian
of Buddhist faith.</i>

406
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,812
Wherever it came from,
it's the perfect nickname.

407
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,982
<i>He's unpredictable, impossible to control.</i>

408
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,944
He's essentially a ticking time bomb.

409
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,820
You can't trust him.

410
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,702
What is that?

411
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,747
Don't worry about her.
She bites, but she's not poisonous.

412
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,500
Aw! Come here, Lizzie. You hungry?

413
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,297
You got outside again, didn't you?
Don't make me put a leash on you.

414
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,301
Jeez.

415
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,183
So you're a spy sent by Headquarters?

416
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,355
Is that what you guys call
special inspector around here?

417
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,775
They told you
to find out everything?

418
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,569
To investigate all the trouble
they're cooking up in Shenyang,

419
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,822
and also what problems
they're causing here.

420
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,324
Let's start.

421
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,868
You sure about this?

422
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,373
All right. Once you watch this,
you'll be wading into the sewer.

423
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,922
This was taken a week ago,
in front of Dongbei Bank.

424
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,384
It's the former Shenyang branch
of Daesong Bank in North Korea.

425
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,680
There was a shootout
between two unidentified groups.

426
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,808
The target of both groups
was that middle-aged man.

427
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,520
The first group that arrived on the scene

428
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,356
was later identified as
North Korea's Supreme Guard.

429
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,110
They were the ones
who attacked us yesterday.

430
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,862
But the other group...

431
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,575
we haven't been able to identify them yet.

432
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,994
And do we know who that guy is
they're fighting over?

433
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,417
That's the head of Room 39. Moon Byung-uk.

434
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,339
During the shootout,
he climbed over the wall and ran away.

435
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,008
He hasn't been seen since then.

436
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,177
You know who Moon Byung-uk is?

437
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,972
- Who is he?
- You really want us to go on?

438
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:28,524
"Room 39" is a group that's part of
North Korea's Central Committee.

439
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,486
It raises lots of foreign investment,

440
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,238
and maintains
the Kim family's giant slush fund.

441
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,199
Four trillion won offshore,

442
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,285
and the one who controls it all

443
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,080
is Moon Byung-uk.

444
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,750
But how did all of you
get involved in this situation?

445
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:50,671
A month ago, Moon reached out to us,
asking for protection.

446
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,342
We were all waiting
at the rendezvous point,

447
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,469
but Room 39 never showed up.

448
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,431
That's when all this happened
in front of the bank.

449
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,100
Do you know what that means?

450
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,936
Agents from both North Korea and China,

451
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,855
and also some unknown third party
fought over Moon.

452
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,900
If word of our involvement
gets leaked to the government,

453
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,735
it could trigger
a major diplomatic crisis.

454
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,530
So our objective
is to find and secure Moon

455
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,949
according to plan before all that happens.

456
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,374
Hey, Prosecutor.

457
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,459
You do your time in the army?

458
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,753
You're in deep shit now.

459
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:35,591
This afternoon was just a taste.
The real war starts right now.

460
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,011
Remember when we told you
to pack your bags and go home?

461
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,389
You should've thanked us
and been on your way.

462
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,402
MINE CLOSED
NO ENTRY

463
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,531
Shoot!

464
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,765
You seem different
from other shit heads,

465
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,207
so I decided to fill you in.

466
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,170
You should just lie low until
we wrap things up. It won't take long.

467
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,464
Did it ever cross your mind that
you should have filed a formal report?

468
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:21,220
Do all prosecutors talk down to people
the way you're doing with me?

469
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,972
You're the one who started it.

470
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,450
Can you just answer the question?
Why didn't you report this?

471
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,394
Report and wait for approval?
There's no time.

472
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,396
Okay, I'll report on it now.

473
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,107
Prepare to move out.

474
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,495
It's okay, go ahead. He knows everything.

475
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,373
I just talked to Hong.

476
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,752
Looks like Professor Wang got the order
from the Japanese.

477
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,715
Last week, he met
with a Japanese agent in Xita district.

478
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,300
Plus, the Russians say

479
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,594
someone is being held
at Big East Building as we speak.

480
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,346
Big East?

481
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,389
Dainichi Electronics?

482
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,770
We better get moving then.

483
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,522
We'll go in as soon as we're all set up.

484
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,858
Then I'll...

485
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,362
Come with me.

486
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,323
What are you going to do?

487
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,911
I guess we should feed him. He's a guest.

488
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,463
Put your seatbelt on.

489
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,137
Come on.

490
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,433
You know what you remind me of?

491
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,104
The white Nikes the hall monitor wore
when I was in school.

492
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,106
I stomped all over them.

493
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,778
- Where are we going now?
- You're an inspector. Time to inspect.

494
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,504
Here's what you asked for.

495
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,759
Your side hasn't found Room 39?

496
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,805
Not sure.

497
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,727
No, we haven't.

498
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,686
Okay.

499
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,899
Is D7 in Shenyang, by any chance?

500
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,947
How about that!

501
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,951
Well, where is he now?

502
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,287
I'll find out and contact you.

503
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,172
Switch off the lights
and leave through the kitchen.

504
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,638
So who was that?

505
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,223
An agent from State Security.

506
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,807
North Korea?

507
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,728
What did you just give that woman?

508
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,813
It's all give and take.

509
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,901
You can't do anything
in this field without intel.

510
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,613
It's like blood.

511
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,493
It needs to flow.
What happens when it clots?

512
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,576
You burst.

513
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,755
Now let's get to work.

514
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,968
BIG EAST

515
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:56,394
- What brings you here?
- We're fixing a line on the 34th floor.

516
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,569
Thank you.

517
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,456
The 67th floor is a separate block.

518
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,083
If we black out one block,

519
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,335
all the lights and security will go out.

520
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,129
Let's limit our contact with them.

521
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,055
Who are you?

522
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,685
Who the hell are you?

523
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,820
Hey.

524
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,282
You're D7, right?

525
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,867
I'll count to three.

526
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,704
Where is Moon Byung-uk?

527
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,956
One.

528
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,709
Two.

529
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,809
Keep your manners.

530
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,896
Disrespect

531
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,815
is always repaid in kind.

532
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:39,288
<i>The center of world
power is returning to Northeast Asia.</i>

533
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:44,919
<i>This, more than anything else,</i>

534
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,129
calls for strong solidarity in Asia.

535
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,716
It's also the reason
I came to be with you today.

536
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,426
Shall we raise a toast to that?

537
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,141
I thought I wouldn't see you
until next year in Hong Kong.

538
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,309
Thanks for coming.

539
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,288
He didn't think he'd see you...

540
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,709
- I'll see you again.
- See you.

541
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,842
You're still alive?

542
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,140
Sure. I don't die so easily.

543
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,520
I told you
about him before, right?

544
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,607
Mr. Ozawa Yoshinobu.

545
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,987
He started at CIRO,
Japan's intelligence agency,

546
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:56,448
but now he works as a lobbyist.

547
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,450
Say hello.

548
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:06,375
This is Jiang Wen,
from Chinese Special Forces.

549
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,924
I've heard much
about you. I'm Jiang Wen.

550
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,720
It's an honor to meet you.

551
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,513
Not at all.

552
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,308
It's nice to meet you.

553
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,311
Apologies for my broken Chinese.

554
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,812
Not at all.

555
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,940
My Japanese is far from perfect.

556
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,371
So what brings you here?

557
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,374
You're not the type of guy
who hangs out at places like this.

558
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,837
Jiang Wen here is a wine lover.

559
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,508
What about you?
What are you doing in Shenyang?

560
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,179
I just needed a change of scenery.

561
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,602
You didn't harm
Professor Wang's family, did you?

562
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:12,024
You almost got me killed
in broad daylight.

563
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,820
Hey.

564
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,659
Have you forgotten
that I'm with a commissioned officer?

565
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,081
Touch them,
and that'll be the end for you all.

566
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,624
Four years ago,

567
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:34,880
you ruined me in Hong Kong,
and I barely recovered.

568
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,800
Since then,

569
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,094
I never stopped thinking of you.

570
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:46,058
Sounds like you're in love with me.

571
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,601
It is love.

572
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,271
A match made in heaven.

573
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,982
And now we meet again.

574
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,987
This time I'm going to skin you alive.

575
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,699
Just you wait.

576
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:09,248
As usual,
you have no sense of dignity.

577
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,043
How long do you intend to work like this?

578
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,505
You're like a cheap hoodlum.

579
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,674
We're two of a kind.

580
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:19,883
You asshole.

581
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,028
Leaving already?
Something came up?

582
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:44,575
Seeing your face, Yaksha...

583
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,829
has ruined the taste of the wine.

584
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,591
You're a lot quicker than I thought.

585
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,387
So that was D7, right?

586
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,892
He's a Japanese spy
disguised as a lobbyist.

587
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,352
For espionage, he's the best in Asia.

588
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,646
So why did he just rush off?

589
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,941
It's a sign that our team
has just reached the target.

590
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,528
You mean they reached Room 39?

591
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,858
Things just got much more serious.

592
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,401
- Let's hurry.
- Yes, sir.

593
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,292
Where's Moon Byung-uk?

594
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,848
What's this?

595
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,018
Moon wasn't there.
We just found this woman.

596
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,147
- Who is she?
- She won't say.

597
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,692
Who she is,
or why she was locked up in there...

598
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,821
Then you should've
ripped her mouth open or something.

599
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,281
Why didn't you do anything?

600
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,544
I asked around.

601
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:05,173
Sounds like they managed to capture her
just after the shootout at Dongbei Bank.

602
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,906
I think maybe they took her
and they're using her as a hostage

603
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,178
to help them get Moon.

604
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,559
Are you Moon's girlfriend?

605
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,644
Fuck off, your breath stinks.

606
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,731
Where is he now?

607
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,534
Is this how you people solve everything?

608
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,912
At the end of the day, you're all
just a bunch of thugs.

609
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,249
Do you want to die?

610
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,172
Make sure she talks before dawn.

611
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,925
And lock this guy up.

612
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,843
See you around.

613
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,684
How long can you live this way?

614
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,563
You're one to talk.

615
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,941
I'm going to quit.

616
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:07,069
That can get you killed. Be careful.

617
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,615
You be careful.

618
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,034
Things are really tense right now.

619
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:19,039
I know for sure that our side is convinced
that the South is secretly hiding Moon.

620
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,583
Idiots.

621
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,046
State Security is going to
send more agents.

622
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:32,552
I've been ordered to keep my eye
on any agents from the South.

623
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,515
You're already doing that right now.

624
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,100
It's not enough.

625
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,486
Do you know who this is?

626
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,693
You're holding her?

627
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:54,866
Who is she?

628
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,162
Moon's daughter.

629
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,416
<i>He raised her in Beijing
to keep it secret from the party.</i>

630
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,751
She's the only family he has left.

631
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,006
<i>What is that?</i>

632
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,549
Old sparky.

633
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,468
It's great for loosening tongues.

634
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,512
You guys don't use this?

635
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,230
Keep moving, and I'll stab you.

636
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,671
Judo? It's not bad.

637
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,517
I hated you
from the moment I lay eyes on you.

638
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,271
You arrogant asshole.

639
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,075
Drop the knife, or die.

640
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,893
Are you okay?

641
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,395
Don't worry.

642
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,397
I'm a South Korean prosecutor.

643
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:53,360
I'll take you
to the South Korean consulate,

644
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,196
and then call the Chinese police.

645
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,075
Pull over.

646
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:13,922
Just wait a minute.

647
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:44,161
<i>Director Yeom? It's Han Ji-hoon.</i>

648
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,204
Prosecutor Han!

649
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,290
<i>What's going on?</i>

650
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,751
<i>Ji Kang-in
is definitely plotting something.</i>

651
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:56,006
<i>From her accent,
the missing hostage was North Korean.</i>

652
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,343
So does that mean you're no longer
anywhere near Ji Kang-in? Is that correct?

653
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:05,015
That's correct. Anyway,
considering that Japan is involved,

654
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,726
the situation is much more serious
than you anticipated.

655
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,478
<i>What about you? Are you okay?</i>

656
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,730
Yes, I'm doing all right.

657
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:13,981
That's good.

658
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,527
I'll call the Consulate General,
so you need to head over there right now.

659
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,611
I can't.

660
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,822
Given the situation,

661
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:24,034
I really think I should stay
and look into things more closely.

662
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,245
Yeah.

663
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,372
Hello? Hello?

664
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,456
Baby.

665
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,667
You need anything?

666
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,051
No, I'm fine.

667
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,594
It's okay.

668
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:45,472
Tell me what you want. My name's Eleven.

669
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,934
This is my neighborhood.

670
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,855
Out of the way.

671
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,398
I can't believe this.

672
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,400
You're not from here.

673
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,528
You look so tired.

674
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,406
Lie down for a bit.

675
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,116
Let go!

676
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:07,786
Huh?

677
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,839
Hang on. Hey.

678
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,192
This will buy you
an overnight. I'll make you happy.

679
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,346
Let's go.

680
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,116
- Don't get yourself hurt.
- Come quietly.

681
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,350
You're making a mistake.

682
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,726
Hey, Nike!

683
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,106
Any idea where you are?

684
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,109
Let him go.

685
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,363
They'll lead
a dummy like you off somewhere,

686
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,200
then cut out your kidneys
and everything else.

687
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,874
Let's go.

688
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:03,550
Why do shitheads like you always
had to butt in and screw everything up!

689
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:17,439
I told you to lay low,
you self-righteous asshole!

690
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,444
I'm a prosecutor.

691
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,989
You abduct, assault,
and even torture people!

692
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,992
Do you expect me to sit back and watch?
You piece of shit!

693
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,872
Wait. Wait.

694
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,422
Son of a bitch!

695
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,437
Whoa!

696
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:07,280
All right. Tell me where she is.

697
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,698
She ran off.

698
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,536
She's Moon Byung-uk's daughter,
you goddamn idiot!

699
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,740
You ruined everything, you shithead!

700
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,376
Did she say anything to you?

701
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,130
I told you. She told me
to get out and drove away.

702
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,724
Why is Japan getting involved in all this?

703
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,855
And what is it with you
and that Ozawa guy?

704
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,780
We've got a lot of memories together.

705
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,366
Stay out of it. None of your business.

706
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,743
We both know I can't do that.

707
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,374
You're looking at 25 years
for what you pulled just today.

708
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,960
I'm not gonna ignore it.

709
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,797
I'm gonna investigate
and prosecute you according to the law.

710
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,676
And then you think
they'll reinstate you after you do that?

711
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,138
I know everything about you.

712
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,223
What happened with Sang-in Group,

713
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,725
your demotion to NIS,
and volunteering to come here.

714
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:22,147
You want to prove yourself
and be reinstated as a prosecutor.

715
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,230
Am I right?

716
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,442
That's right.

717
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,487
I have to go back, and soon.

718
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,781
Then I'll nail Sang-in Group.

719
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,410
When society's rich and powerful elite
commit crimes,

720
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,248
a lot more people suffer
than you actually think.

721
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,084
And for hell of a lot longer too.

722
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:48,465
Any lawbreaking bastard
that I catch is going rue the day...

723
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,048
Shit.

724
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,886
Thank you.

725
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,937
Close the door.

726
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,823
What is this?

727
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,248
What? Looking for a tracker?

728
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,543
Those are a little dated.

729
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:31,716
We wipe that on you, and we can track you
by satellite for a full 18 hours.

730
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:34,594
It's always the first thing we do
when we have a guest.

731
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,762
In case they run off.

732
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,306
She's stopped.

733
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,518
Where?

734
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,311
The Korean neighborhood
in Heping District.

735
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,729
Twenty-three minutes away.

736
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,399
Let's go. Get us there in five.

737
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,693
Okay, five it is.

738
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,317
This is an operation.

739
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,735
Keep your cool, okay?

740
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,538
SATELLITE TRACKING SYSTEM

741
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:46,457
Hey.

742
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,753
Tell me. How long have you
been working with Ji Kang-in?

743
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,382
So what, now you're inspecting us?

744
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,428
Humor me, will you?

745
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,016
<i>Hui-won's
been here the longest.</i>

746
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:04,892
<i>Next is Jae-gyu.</i>

747
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,062
<i>Me, about three years?</i>

748
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,651
<i>I got roped in
while I was traveling in Cairo.</i>

749
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:19,073
Did he run around
shooting people then, too?

750
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:23,161
What do you think?
That's what black teams do.

751
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,881
<i>Since we'd all be dead
if it weren't for him,</i>

752
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,466
<i>we do everything he tells us.</i>

753
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,098
If he tells us to die, we do it.

754
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,830
What? She's moving.

755
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,707
SATELLITE TRACKING SYSTEM

756
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,304
Sir, looks like the squirrel slipped out.

757
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,474
Police.

758
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,771
<i>Mobilize quickly!</i>

759
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,607
<i>A shootout in Heping District 26-7!</i>

760
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,985
<i>Combatants are armed and unidentified.
Backup requested.</i>

761
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,322
It's Moon.

762
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,910
The cops are here. Fall back.
Do you hear me?

763
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,954
What's wrong?

764
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,956
I think the signal's being blocked.

765
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:51,623
I can't reach them.

766
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:56,254
He's been shot in the stomach,
at point blank range.

767
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,337
It's a trap.

768
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,258
How fast can you run?

769
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,568
<i>All units,</i>

770
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,678
<i>seize the group
of unidentified, armed combatants.</i>

771
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,057
We have to go.
The police are here.

772
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,770
Hey, Moon. Can you hear me?

773
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,815
Where's that thing
you were going to give me?

774
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,359
I am...

775
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,111
...useless now.

776
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:24,741
My daughter.

777
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,077
My daughter Ju-yeon.

778
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,665
Whatever happens, don't let...

779
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,795
...don't let the Japanese get her.

780
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,930
<i>Shoot them dead if they resist.</i>

781
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,349
<i>This is a residential area, so be careful.</i>

782
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,601
<i>Do not harm the civilians.</i>

783
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,111
Vision impaired
due to smoke bomb!

784
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,345
We need backup.

785
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,144
<i>Group B, move quickly
to Zone C flyover and block them off.</i>

786
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:48,366
Three men down! We need backup!

787
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,692
<i>We need backup!</i>

788
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,116
Freeze! Put down your guns!

789
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,893
- Jump.
- Huh?

790
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,394
You heard me. Come on, jump.

791
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,398
I'm... I'm a little afraid of heights.

792
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,360
Hey.

793
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:15,912
Agh! Sh...

794
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,335
Oh, sh...

795
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,878
Freeze!

796
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,005
On the ground!

797
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:31,593
Ah, sh...

SAMJIN TRAVEL AGENCY

799
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,731
Reporting in.
We're keeping guard at the intersection.

800
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:47,276
Sir, the police are here and
they're searching our office right now.

801
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,547
I'm pretty sure he's the one
who planned the whole thing.

802
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:51,656
Did you clean up?

803
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,450
Yeah, don't worry, it's clean.

804
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,117
All right.

805
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,246
Turn around.

806
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,416
They got the travel agency.

807
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,304
Let's close the shutter.

808
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,473
Huh?

809
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:22,269
<i>They're bound
to search there, too.</i>

810
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:24,688
<i>Close the shutter.</i>

811
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,815
Sure about this?

812
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:52,207
They must've hacked
into our tracking system.

813
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,928
The Chinese police had perfect timing.
It can't be a coincidence.

814
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,982
Oh shit. What about Lizzie?

815
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,904
What do you want?

816
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:16,240
This is all your fault.

817
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,533
Let me go!

818
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,662
Let go, damn it!

819
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,665
He screwed everything up.

820
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:29,420
Now what? You're gonna pay...

821
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:32,548
Calm down, will you?

822
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,843
What's the real reason
you went looking for Moon?

823
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,014
The real reason?

824
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,268
Yeah. Not the lies you put in reports,

825
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,687
but the real reason
you're keeping this secret.

826
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,608
I heard he was supposed
to give you something. Wasn't he?

827
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:52,358
So, what?

828
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:55,654
Could it be the secret fund
he was in charge of maybe?

829
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,238
Four trillion.

830
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,242
You're all just fighting
over that money, aren't you?

831
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,914
I heard you embezzled funds
for foreign operations.

832
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:08,042
And the higher-ups in Korea
just chose to let it slide.

833
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,251
Shut up.

834
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,630
You seem convinced that
we're some kind of trash.

835
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:15,091
Aren't you?

836
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,383
If not, go ahead.

837
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:18,135
Kill me.

838
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,011
That's enough.

839
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:24,225
<i>Looks like game over, no?</i>

840
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:25,308
Ozawa.

841
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,020
You came quite prepared.

842
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:31,732
You shouldn't take other people's things.

843
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,109
Still,

844
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,612
hitting our home seems a bit extreme.

845
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,740
It's for the best.

846
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:44,453
How about leaving here in the morning?

847
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:47,748
I won't leave

848
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,960
without taking care of you.

849
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:53,087
<i>You don't have many options.</i>

850
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:56,006
Since you killed Moon Byung-uk.

851
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:57,925
What?

852
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:02,138
At 8:00 a.m., a wanted
notice will go out all over China.

853
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,933
Newspapers, TV, internet...

854
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,812
Your faces will be everywhere.

855
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,690
<i>Your days working in China are finished.</i>

856
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:15,651
Boarding a ship won't be easy.

857
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:19,780
I recommend crossing
the Russian border before dawn.

858
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:22,116
<i>As an admirer of your talent,</i>

859
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:24,869
I'm doing you this last favor.

860
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,588
We've already called
your people several times,

861
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,298
but let me tell you directly.

862
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,426
One of the wanted suspects

863
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,469
is a prosecutor sent by us.

864
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,513
He came for an internal review,

865
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:48,017
but we think he got pulled
into this incident against his will.

866
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,228
We really need your cooperation on this.

867
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:53,897
Okay.

868
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,401
<i>The shootout
continued until midnight,</i>

869
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:59,904
<i>and one could tell
the situation was very urgent.</i>

870
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:02,865
<i>The shattered windows
and the holes in the walls</i>

871
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:04,825
<i>show the aftermath of the shootout.</i>

872
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:08,871
China's Security Ministry
is blaming everything on the police.

873
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:12,124
Which clearly means
they don't want to help.

874
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,294
Director, I think I've finally found
a way to get a hold of Hong.

875
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,379
<i>I went out to check on my kid.</i>

876
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,840
Our top priority
is getting Han out of there.

877
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,008
Let's get you on a plane.

878
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:25,971
<i>I suddenly heard some
commotion, sound of glass breaking.</i>

879
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,849
<i>I was terrified.
This has never happened before.</i>

880
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:31,936
<i>I couldn't believe
it was happening right in front of me.</i>

881
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:33,019
Here.

882
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,731
You're really starting to smell.

883
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:41,569
Damn it.

884
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:45,157
I don't exactly know
what you think of us at this point,

885
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,617
but let me say one thing.

886
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:49,954
Embezzling the operation funds...

887
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:53,582
You're right, it's true.
And it was a lot of money.

888
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,502
But all of it

889
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,129
was sent to the grieving families

890
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:02,758
of every single squad member who died
on the line of duty over the years.

891
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:06,804
Headquarters found out later
and decided to let it slide.

892
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:11,517
As far as he's concerned,
money means nothing to him.

893
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:13,560
Do you understand what I mean?

894
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:15,938
Eat your food.

895
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,369
Sorry to show up in this state

896
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,455
after so long.

897
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,292
I'm a bit embarrassed.

898
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:39,503
How can you say that between us?

899
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:42,756
If it weren't for you,

900
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,968
I'd be dead already.

901
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:50,723
For now, eat and get some rest.

902
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:03,152
Hey, Chang.

903
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:06,196
Stop the work and send everyone home.

904
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,910
<i>Don't worry. It's safe here.</i>

905
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:15,039
What are you planning to do with it?

906
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:22,963
I've managed to secure a way out
for each of us.

907
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:25,758
We'd be going through Vietnam,
but we don't have much time.

908
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:28,761
We probably have a good chance if
we leave the country some time today.

909
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:30,596
Sure, go ahead.

910
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:32,306
Huh?

911
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:35,434
You're the only one of us
who has a family to take care of.

912
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,937
Come on, sir,
after everything we've been through,

913
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,066
do you seriously believe
that I could do that to all of you?

914
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,906
If we're not all going to leave Shenyang,

915
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:50,824
then I'll just get ready
for our next mission.

916
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,956
Excuse me. What shall we do
with the prosecutor now?

917
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:01,543
Well, what do you think we should do?

918
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:05,827
According to the manual,
we should've dumped him already.

919
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,317
Can you hear me?

920
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:58,976
You don't want to go deaf, do you?

921
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,313
After all I did for you,

922
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,191
you shouldn't do this.

923
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:12,114
Ingratitude is the worst vice.

924
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:13,323
So,

925
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:15,742
where did you hide it?

926
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:18,536
Tell me.

927
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:26,044
As long as it stays hidden,

928
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:29,381
I can just make you disappear.

929
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:32,550
If I die,

930
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:35,762
it will all come out.

931
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:38,474
Didn't you think about that?

932
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:46,440
You prepared well,

933
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:48,942
just like a professional.

934
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:53,405
All right. I can wait.

935
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:11,173
We confirmed that they're currently
inside the Japanese consulate.

936
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:15,594
And aside from the consulate vehicles,
no other cars have left the premises.

937
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:18,347
So the plan is to hit them
right when they come out?

938
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,430
Yeah.

939
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:23,852
A large Japanese cargo ship is currently
anchored at the Port of Dalian,

940
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:27,314
so looks like they're going to move
Moon Ju-yeon by ship.

941
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:29,816
I identified three points

942
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,277
along the road from Shenyang to Dailan.

943
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,961
Based on that, it looks like
the safest place to intercept them...

944
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,323
No, not there.

945
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,158
Wherever we do it,

946
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:41,954
remember, the timing will be tough
since we're outnumbered,

947
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,497
and if we lose them,

948
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:45,582
it's game over.

949
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:47,292
So forget all this.

950
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:50,754
Let's just break in.

951
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:52,714
What?

952
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,467
We're gonna walk right in.

953
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,185
You know how to make me laugh.

954
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,147
You wanna break into the consulate?

955
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:14,069
That's Japanese land.
You know you'd be committing a crime.

956
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:16,446
They tried to burn our consulate down.

957
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,617
<i>Four years ago,</i>

958
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:24,997
<i>the two Koreas were planning
secret working-level talks in Hong Kong.</i>

959
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:29,626
<i>Japan's been trying to block cooperation
between North and South for a long time.</i>

960
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:33,839
<i>Because they think
a unified Korea would be a threat to them.</i>

961
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,718
<i>In the end, the talks never happened.</i>

962
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:42,347
<i>Three of our team died, and the other one</i>

963
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:43,807
<i>I killed myself.</i>

964
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,437
<i>Because he was a mole
working for the Japanese.</i>

965
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:52,983
Moon Byung-uk

966
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,069
was also a turncoat.

967
01:16:57,154 --> 01:17:00,991
He cut a deal and requested asylum
in exchange for classified information.

968
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:03,910
That's the reason
why the Japanese decided to kill him.

969
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:06,079
Then why did they kidnap his daughter?

970
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:09,333
Because now she has all the secret
information he was going to give us.

971
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:11,668
As soon as they get
that information they want from her,

972
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:13,378
she's as good as dead.

973
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:14,379
Which means,

974
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:17,049
we need to go get her back
before that happens.

975
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,344
Do you get the situation now?

976
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,979
Someone from HQ is coming.

977
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,984
They called all of us in. What do we do?

978
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,154
They're just going
to complicate things for us.

979
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,908
You go and try to stall them
until we're done.

980
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,077
Uh, but without me...

981
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:47,817
So, what, it's just going to be
the four of you going in?

982
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:50,374
Why four? It's five.

983
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,735
CONSULATE GENERAL OF JAPAN

984
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:20,529
What are you doing?

985
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:22,614
You can't do that here.

986
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,908
Go away! Go!

987
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:28,912
Go away!

988
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,210
What the hell?

989
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,092
Get out of here!

990
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,469
Are you insane?

991
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,127
Where is the Branch Manager?

992
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:19,337
Uh, I'm not sure.

993
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,882
Well, how exactly
are you planning to fix this?

994
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:22,883
I apologize.

995
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:24,301
And Prosecutor Han?

996
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:26,636
I'm not sure. I'm sorry.

997
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:46,239
I'm sorry, but this is just wrong.

998
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:50,368
It's called breaking and entering.
Clearly illegal.

999
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,204
By international law...

1000
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:55,624
If you're so scared for your life,
you can get out right now, you chicken.

1001
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:56,750
What?

1002
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,628
If we work by the law,
we can't do anything.

1003
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:05,133
There's this saying
I always try to live by.

1004
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,677
Just actions preserve justice.

1005
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,513
Justice?

1006
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:13,308
Is that really all justice is to you? Huh?

1007
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:19,773
The truth is that justice has to be
preserved by any means necessary.

1008
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:23,026
That's my idea of justice.

1009
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,575
All right. Stand by, okay?

1010
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,370
Have you ever seen me wear one of those?

1011
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,914
You should definitely wear one today.

1012
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,541
If your number's up, you die.

1013
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:39,709
If not, you live.

1014
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,173
Why don't you wear two? Come on, chicken.

1015
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:56,977
What the heck?

1016
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:04,776
Damn it!

1017
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,700
- Oh, it's getting away!
- Hey, it's getting away!

1018
01:21:19,165 --> 01:21:21,626
- Catch it!
- You're telling me to catch it?

1019
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,420
Stop.

1020
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:24,503
Stop!

1021
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:39,852
Hurry.

1022
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,312
This way.

1023
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,482
They came quicker than I thought.

1024
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:50,279
Wait.

1025
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,675
- Step back, please.
- Out of the way.

1026
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:54,034
Please hurry up.

1027
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,495
- A gun?
- Be quiet.

1028
01:21:58,538 --> 01:21:59,538
Hey!

1029
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:01,625
Why are you standing there?

1030
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:03,501
Get in here, quickly!

1031
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,800
Is she dead?

1032
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:14,428
Check.

1033
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:40,538
Out of the way!

1034
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:44,459
Move!

1035
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:56,054
Go!

1036
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:17,409
<i>Shenyang's
underground tunnels are like an anthill.</i>

1037
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:22,247
<i>During World War II Japanese troops
used them as air-raid shelters.</i>

1038
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,207
<i>They linked all the major points
in the city,</i>

1039
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:26,918
<i>so of course there'd be one
under the Japanese consulate.</i>

1040
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:31,089
<i>We'll figure out where it is,
and strike quickly.</i>

1041
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,423
Over there!

1042
01:23:57,782 --> 01:23:59,075
Go after them!

1043
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:15,485
It's okay. She's not poisonous.

1044
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:18,655
Get down, Lizzie.

1045
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:23,535
Get down.

1046
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,376
My father worked for many years

1047
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,546
as a Japanese spy.

1048
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,967
And last year,
I started helping him in secret.

1049
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:48,434
At first he thought he was working for
the good of both North and South Korea,

1050
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:52,147
but then he realized
he was only helping Japan.

1051
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:56,818
They had deceived him.

1052
01:25:59,028 --> 01:26:02,157
In the end he was tormented
by all the harm that he had caused.

1053
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:05,618
He said he couldn't be
Japan's puppet anymore.

1054
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,831
And so he decided to defect.

1055
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,294
To repent his sins.

1056
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:20,925
What secret information did he have?

1057
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:24,929
A spy list.

1058
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:28,098
A list?

1059
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:31,269
There were other spies
apart from your father?

1060
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:37,066
The current number of double agents
Ozawa maintains in East Asia is 107.

1061
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:40,195
The list has

1062
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:44,407
intelligence from mission dossiers,
objectives and reports.

1063
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:49,495
It even includes
the funding source for each operation.

1064
01:26:50,496 --> 01:26:52,498
My father wanted to make it public.

1065
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,126
Japan is still trying to stop him.

1066
01:26:57,712 --> 01:27:00,924
And do you know
where the list is now?

1067
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,568
Please zoom in.

1068
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,743
At 4:39 p.m.,

1069
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:32,413
they left their Cesco vehicle
in a parking lot near Zhongshan Square.

1070
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:36,084
Then they got in another vehicle
and fled toward the Heping District.

1071
01:27:38,127 --> 01:27:40,880
The last signal came from District 89.

1072
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:44,217
Activate all our antennas in Shenyang.

1073
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,416
I thought we're going somewhere safe.

1074
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,502
As of right now,
this may be our only option.

1075
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:27,969
Hey, Eleven.

1076
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:32,432
Baby!

1077
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:35,642
Are you insane?

1078
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:38,021
Why come back here?

1079
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:40,773
You want to die?

1080
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,994
Yaksha told us to come here.

1081
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,465
Don't worry.

1082
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:09,802
This neighborhood is so dirty and scary,

1083
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:11,721
not even the cops come.

1084
01:29:11,804 --> 01:29:14,891
If anyone turns up,
I'll tell you right away.

1085
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:16,059
Thanks.

1086
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:19,770
What's your name?

1087
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:23,482
Nike.

1088
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:26,110
Nike?

1089
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:32,909
Mmm, then I'm Adidas.

1090
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:42,418
Have a good time then.

1091
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:46,547
These walls are really thin,

1092
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:49,509
so make sure you do it lightly,

1093
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:51,344
gently...

1094
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,263
...and quietly.

1095
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,724
- Got it?
- All right.

1096
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:01,396
Let me know if you need anything!

1097
01:30:03,773 --> 01:30:05,066
So what now?

1098
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:08,861
We'll think of something.

1099
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:19,746
Don't worry.

1100
01:30:21,165 --> 01:30:23,501
We won't let the Japanese
capture you, okay?

1101
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:29,381
It's in Chile.

1102
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:32,759
Sorry?

1103
01:30:34,178 --> 01:30:35,346
My father's spy list.

1104
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:45,148
I hid it in the database
of a university in Santiago.

1105
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:47,566
But...

1106
01:30:48,067 --> 01:30:49,569
...it's not easy to find.

1107
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,655
You have to use foreign servers

1108
01:30:52,738 --> 01:30:55,032
and also bypass multiple firewalls.

1109
01:30:58,077 --> 01:30:59,871
Nobody can do it except me.

1110
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:31,402
- Han's not here yet?
- No.

1111
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,528
And the rest?

1112
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:35,448
I told everyone else to look around
and search for him.

1113
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,200
And the higher-ups?

1114
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:40,411
I took them for a ride
and slipped out, don't worry.

1115
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:45,166
Hello?

1116
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:46,529
<i>It's me, Han Ji-hoon.</i>

1117
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,384
What happened to you?
I told you to come here!

1118
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:50,087
Listen to me very carefully.

1119
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:54,258
The info that Moon had is a list
of the spies Japan has in each country.

1120
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:57,053
- Moon Ju-yeon talked?
<i>- She told me everything, but...</i>

1121
01:31:57,136 --> 01:32:00,056
That time I took Moon Ju-yeon
and escaped your compound,

1122
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:02,308
I immediately told Headquarters.

1123
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:04,685
<i>I told them everything.
I told them she got away.</i>

1124
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:05,811
Damn it.

1125
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:10,024
Do you think that's why the Japanese
were able to hack our tracking system,

1126
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:12,193
and were always a step ahead?

1127
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,237
Who exactly did you talk to?

1128
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:17,114
Director Yeom Jeong-won.

1129
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,283
She's also the one who sent me here.

1130
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:23,079
<i>If there's also a mole inside the NIS...</i>

1131
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:28,125
<i>Hello?</i>

1132
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:29,209
Hello?

1133
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:37,801
It was you.

1134
01:32:46,602 --> 01:32:47,602
Hello?

1135
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:50,940
That's him!

1136
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:37,403
Get him!

1137
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:51,792
Hmm. You're the mole?

1138
01:33:54,545 --> 01:33:55,546
How long?

1139
01:33:57,006 --> 01:34:00,301
With mountains of debt
and a sick kid who could die any day,

1140
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:03,804
what the hell did you expect me to do?

1141
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:25,159
Who turned you into this, huh?

1142
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,121
Was it that NIS bitch?

1143
01:34:29,955 --> 01:34:31,624
- Hmm?
- I can't tell you.

1144
01:34:32,249 --> 01:34:33,334
If I do...

1145
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:38,172
they'll kill my family.

1146
01:34:39,298 --> 01:34:40,341
I'm sorry, boss.

1147
01:34:58,484 --> 01:34:59,694
Greetings.

1148
01:35:02,321 --> 01:35:03,531
Prosecutor Han.

1149
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,410
Sorry to startle you,

1150
01:35:08,577 --> 01:35:09,995
but to be honest,

1151
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:13,040
I knew who you were from the beginning.

1152
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:15,501
Instead of the street,

1153
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:19,755
shall we go somewhere quiet
and talk over a cup of tea?

1154
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:38,482
It's a side wound.

1155
01:35:39,942 --> 01:35:42,403
I guess he wasn't trying to kill you.

1156
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,418
Let's run away together.

1157
01:35:57,501 --> 01:35:58,836
Run where?

1158
01:36:00,337 --> 01:36:01,380
I just feel like

1159
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,884
you're really going to die this time.

1160
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:06,802
Are you afraid to die?

1161
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:10,514
You're not?

1162
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:11,599
I'm scared

1163
01:36:12,808 --> 01:36:14,477
but only that I'll fail again...

1164
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,147
and make a total mess of everything.

1165
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:21,275
That's what scares me.

1166
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:27,198
My team almost risked their lives for me.

1167
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:31,494
<i>I need to finish</i>

1168
01:36:32,828 --> 01:36:34,163
<i>what they started.</i>

1169
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:57,705
I've taken action,

1170
01:37:57,788 --> 01:38:00,207
but I need a bit more time.

1171
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:03,586
I'll try my best to wrap this up quickly.

1172
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:06,088
Please don't worry.

1173
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:10,174
Hello?

1174
01:38:11,176 --> 01:38:13,345
<i>I'm disappointed in you.</i>

1175
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:18,559
I think it's time
to conclude our partnership.

1176
01:38:19,935 --> 01:38:21,854
What do you mean?

1177
01:38:21,937 --> 01:38:24,064
My sincere gratitude

1178
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:27,401
for all that you've done.

1179
01:39:00,392 --> 01:39:04,188
You turned Hong into a mole
that quickly?

1180
01:39:04,271 --> 01:39:06,440
Just to kill me?

1181
01:39:09,401 --> 01:39:12,571
Four years ago, the fire in Hong Kong,

1182
01:39:13,989 --> 01:39:15,449
that was also you, wasn't it?

1183
01:39:16,825 --> 01:39:18,953
What are you talking about?

1184
01:39:24,166 --> 01:39:25,751
I didn't have a choice.

1185
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:29,088
Yeah, sure. None of those moles
had a choice, did they?

1186
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:32,967
Where's Ozawa now?

1187
01:39:34,593 --> 01:39:37,429
Fu... Fukuyama Chemicals.

1188
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:39,890
He's headed to their Chinese factory.

1189
01:39:40,432 --> 01:39:41,684
Why there?

1190
01:39:42,434 --> 01:39:44,019
I have no idea.

1191
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:47,189
It's true!

1192
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:50,818
Listen to me.

1193
01:39:52,027 --> 01:39:53,529
I can help you take him down.

1194
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:58,075
Think about it.

1195
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:03,497
Who else but me
could possibly pull that off?

1196
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:08,502
Who's going to listen
to a hoodlum like you?

1197
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:12,381
You're finished, too.

1198
01:40:22,182 --> 01:40:23,267
Sir.

1199
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:28,856
- <i>It's me.</i>
- What?

1200
01:40:28,939 --> 01:40:30,399
Han came by earlier.

1201
01:40:30,482 --> 01:40:31,817
Well, where is he now?

1202
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:35,195
Don't know.
He wanted me to tell you something.

1203
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,406
<i>He wants to meet with you.</i>

1204
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:55,632
Are you really actually alone?
The team isn't hiding nearby, right?

1205
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:57,301
What are you so scared of?

1206
01:40:57,384 --> 01:40:59,386
There's no one I can trust anymore.

1207
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:00,804
Where's Moon Ju-yeon?

1208
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:10,773
What's your plan?

1209
01:41:10,856 --> 01:41:13,901
First, we all need to leave the city.

1210
01:41:13,984 --> 01:41:15,235
And get that list.

1211
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:16,903
Come on.

1212
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:20,157
If you hang around here,
you'll end up in prison.

1213
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,452
Hey, Yaksha.

1214
01:41:26,747 --> 01:41:28,707
<i>Go and kill Yaksha.</i>

1215
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:31,460
<i>Then bring Moon Ju-yeon to me.</i>

1216
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:37,716
I hear your mom and sister run
a restaurant near Suwon City Hall?

1217
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:41,720
If you don't do as told,

1218
01:41:41,804 --> 01:41:43,847
after midnight,

1219
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:47,267
a one-kilometer ring of fire will burn

1220
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:49,978
around Suwon City Hall.

1221
01:42:08,747 --> 01:42:09,747
Get in.

1222
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:16,338
Get in for now.

1223
01:42:44,449 --> 01:42:47,452
TO THE FUTURE
WITH REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY

1224
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:14,897
I knew you could do it.
Very impressive.

1225
01:43:15,772 --> 01:43:19,109
Now, we've become friends.

1226
01:43:23,488 --> 01:43:24,698
You aren't hurt?

1227
01:43:25,782 --> 01:43:27,242
Sorry for the mess.

1228
01:43:27,743 --> 01:43:31,622
It wasn't easy finding a system
we can use for this job.

1229
01:43:32,831 --> 01:43:33,999
So,

1230
01:43:36,418 --> 01:43:37,544
shall we begin?

1231
01:43:39,922 --> 01:43:42,216
This was the first intel

1232
01:43:42,299 --> 01:43:44,551
that Han gave us.

1233
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:51,350
I need to leave the country by morning,

1234
01:43:52,392 --> 01:43:54,186
so we don't have time.

1235
01:44:07,532 --> 01:44:09,326
Hey, who are you?

1236
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,501
Emergency in Zone A!

1237
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:19,920
Zone A!

1238
01:44:20,003 --> 01:44:23,006
There's an intruder! Send security!

1239
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:24,090
Hurry!

1240
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,260
There he is.

1241
01:44:28,595 --> 01:44:29,721
Freeze!

1242
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:33,224
Hands up!

1243
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:24,860
Stop!

1244
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:30,949
She went down!

1245
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:51,887
Up there!

1246
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:22,417
Why so slow?

1247
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:28,507
You think
breaking and entering is so easy?

1248
01:46:31,009 --> 01:46:32,677
Don't try any tricks.

1249
01:46:52,447 --> 01:46:53,573
How is it going?

1250
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,158
You're alive.

1251
01:46:55,242 --> 01:46:58,703
Sure. I don't die so easily.

1252
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:07,212
<i>He said he was going to shoot you,
but you should trust him.</i>

1253
01:47:09,172 --> 01:47:11,341
Have you ever seen me wear one of those?

1254
01:47:13,468 --> 01:47:17,264
If your number's up,
you die. If not, you live.

1255
01:47:17,347 --> 01:47:19,224
<i>That's what
he wanted me to tell you.</i>

1256
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:24,855
Uh, that hurts.

1257
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:27,399
Did any bullets pierce through?

1258
01:47:28,733 --> 01:47:29,734
Let me see.

1259
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:34,865
Goddamn it.
How many times did he shoot me?

1260
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:38,452
Prosecutor Han.

1261
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:41,413
You deceived me?

1262
01:47:41,496 --> 01:47:44,749
Compared to your methods,
this is pretty tame.

1263
01:47:46,209 --> 01:47:49,212
After all the stunts you've pulled,

1264
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:51,673
we decided to try one, too.

1265
01:47:52,632 --> 01:47:53,632
So what?

1266
01:47:57,846 --> 01:47:59,222
It's done.

1267
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:00,390
Do it.

1268
01:48:16,823 --> 01:48:17,908
Huh.

1269
01:48:29,836 --> 01:48:32,464
Look at all those moles.
They're everywhere.

1270
01:48:34,049 --> 01:48:36,176
Are these all your trainees?

1271
01:48:37,093 --> 01:48:40,096
I like to think of them as my artworks.

1272
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:41,380
My ass, they are.

1273
01:48:42,224 --> 01:48:44,184
Hey. Delete everything.

1274
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:57,197
It's a shame,

1275
01:48:58,073 --> 01:49:00,116
but that's all I can show you today.

1276
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:11,521
<i>Control room, respond!
The exit in Zone C has collapsed!</i>

1277
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:13,797
<i>Open the exit in Zone D!</i>

1278
01:49:15,298 --> 01:49:17,092
<i>Control room, respond!</i>

1279
01:49:17,175 --> 01:49:19,928
You want to delete it? It's not up to you.

1280
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:24,891
- You two, get out.
- Let's go together.

1281
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:25,976
It's dangerous here.

1282
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:28,894
Go.

1283
01:49:30,188 --> 01:49:32,315
I'm going to skin this jerk alive.

1284
01:49:58,425 --> 01:49:59,467
Hey.

1285
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:31,163
Stop!

1286
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:05,784
- Where's he?
- He's still in there. With Ozawa.

1287
01:51:12,957 --> 01:51:15,669
The thought
of that list getting out,

1288
01:51:16,252 --> 01:51:17,921
does it make you tremble?

1289
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,970
- No.
- Get off!

1290
01:51:26,054 --> 01:51:28,682
- We'll all die if we go in.
- We don't have time.

1291
01:51:28,765 --> 01:51:30,058
Listen to me!

1292
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:34,080
- These are his orders!
- Wait! No!

1293
01:51:34,104 --> 01:51:35,397
Let go!

1294
01:51:38,066 --> 01:51:38,983
Shit.

1295
01:52:30,034 --> 01:52:32,036
Your mission has finished.

1296
01:52:33,121 --> 01:52:35,290
You can go now, Yaksha.

1297
01:52:41,212 --> 01:52:42,255
Drop the gun!

1298
01:52:43,715 --> 01:52:44,883
Prosecutor Han.

1299
01:52:44,966 --> 01:52:48,136
You keep disappointing me.

1300
01:52:48,219 --> 01:52:49,345
Do it.

1301
01:52:50,889 --> 01:52:52,307
That's right.

1302
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:53,683
Shoot.

1303
01:52:54,684 --> 01:52:58,897
Shall we bet on who's faster?

1304
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:01,858
One.

1305
01:53:02,484 --> 01:53:03,485
Two.

1306
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:46,861
What's going on?

1307
01:53:47,362 --> 01:53:51,074
If anyone attempts to delete the file,

1308
01:53:51,157 --> 01:53:53,743
it's programmed to send it out.

1309
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:57,914
The intelligence services

1310
01:53:57,997 --> 01:54:00,583
of each country where your moles work

1311
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:02,502
are receiving the list right now.

1312
01:54:08,758 --> 01:54:11,094
No! Damn it!

1313
01:54:26,359 --> 01:54:27,735
Damn it!

1314
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:54,364
You're the one who's finished.

1315
01:56:49,752 --> 01:56:53,297
<i>Hey, Nike.
Pull it together and listen carefully.</i>

1316
01:56:53,881 --> 01:56:56,134
Whether you have to crawl away or jump,

1317
01:56:56,801 --> 01:57:00,013
make it out of here alive. You understand?

1318
01:57:02,098 --> 01:57:04,183
Then go to the old man's liquor factory.

1319
01:57:06,894 --> 01:57:07,979
Take that thing in,

1320
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:13,276
prosecute her to the full extent
of the law like you said.

1321
01:57:13,985 --> 01:57:15,111
What do you mean?

1322
01:57:15,194 --> 01:57:18,698
You clean things up. You do it.

1323
01:57:20,158 --> 01:57:21,701
You're the only one I trust.

1324
01:57:23,661 --> 01:57:24,787
Now, go.

1325
01:57:55,985 --> 01:57:58,946
<i>In a startling
development, a high-ranking director</i>

1326
01:57:59,030 --> 01:58:01,407
<i>at South Korea's
National Intelligence Service</i>

1327
01:58:01,491 --> 01:58:04,285
<i>has been arrested
for serving as a spy for Japan...</i>

1328
01:58:04,368 --> 01:58:07,580
<i>A director at South
Korea's National Intelligence Service</i>

1329
01:58:07,663 --> 01:58:09,266
<i>who's been spying for Japan
was arrested...</i>

1330
01:58:09,290 --> 01:58:12,436
From officials in major
government ministries, press members,

1331
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:13,961
<i>and even university professors,</i>

1332
01:58:14,045 --> 01:58:17,423
<i>they have been regularly taking hundreds
of millions of won worth of bribes.</i>

1333
01:58:17,507 --> 01:58:21,094
<i>From ten different Japanese
companies including Yamakawa and Nishiba,</i>

ONE YEAR LATER, SEOUL

1335
01:58:22,178 --> 01:58:25,264
<i>In particular, the news
that Sang-in Group's Japan branch</i>

1336
01:58:25,348 --> 01:58:27,100
<i>also took part in this bribery</i>

1337
01:58:27,183 --> 01:58:28,903
<i>has sent shock waves
through Korean society.</i>

1338
01:58:28,976 --> 01:58:30,561
Do you admit to the crimes?

1339
01:58:30,645 --> 01:58:33,106
Chairman Lee!
Do you finally admit to the crimes?

1340
01:58:39,487 --> 01:58:40,780
A pleasure, sir.

1341
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:47,370
I think you spilled sauce
on your shirt.

1342
01:59:01,551 --> 01:59:04,470
<i>At 4:00 p.m. today,
Seoul Central District Court</i>

1343
01:59:04,554 --> 01:59:07,431
<i>declared Chairman Lee guilty
and sent him to prison.</i>

1344
01:59:08,349 --> 01:59:11,394
<i>The Head Judge presiding
over the case, Jo Tae-soo,</i>

1345
01:59:11,477 --> 01:59:15,690
<i>sentences Lee to seven years
for stock manipulation, and additional...</i>

1346
01:59:15,773 --> 01:59:16,774
- Hello, sir.
- Hmm.

1347
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:18,298
<i>...five years in prison for bribery.</i>

1348
01:59:18,359 --> 01:59:20,903
<i>Meanwhile, after yet
another investigation,</i>

1349

<i>a trial will begin soon on payments</i>

<i>which is expected
to lengthen Lee's sentence.</i>

1352
01:59:32,165 --> 01:59:34,542
That impregnable fortress

1353
01:59:35,126 --> 01:59:37,879
collapsed after
just a few short confessions.

1354
01:59:37,962 --> 01:59:39,088
Hi, there.

1355
01:59:39,797 --> 01:59:40,840
What can I say?

1356
01:59:41,632 --> 01:59:44,177
It's like you waited for him
to turn around

1357
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:46,304
then hit him in the back of his head.

1358
01:59:46,387 --> 01:59:48,431
That's not your style at all.

1359
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:51,267
You've changed, haven't you?

1360
01:59:53,769 --> 01:59:54,769
Someone told me.

1361
01:59:55,605 --> 01:59:58,441
Justice has ot be preserved

1362
01:59:59,650 --> 02:00:01,485
by any means necessary.

1363
02:00:04,822 --> 02:00:05,698
Hello?

1364
02:00:05,781 --> 02:00:08,409
<i>Is this Prosecutor Han Ji-hoon?</i>

1365
02:00:09,035 --> 02:00:11,829
Yes, it is. Who's speaking?

1366
02:00:13,873 --> 02:00:14,957
<i>Hey, Nike!</i>

1367
02:00:16,918 --> 02:00:18,002
It's me, Yaksha.

1368
02:00:18,085 --> 02:00:19,128
What happened?

1369
02:00:20,338 --> 02:00:21,756
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1370
02:00:21,839 --> 02:00:23,424
<i>Did you think I was dead?</i>

1371
02:00:24,008 --> 02:00:25,426
<i>It'll take more than that.</i>

1372
02:00:26,594 --> 02:00:27,511
Where are you now?

1373
02:00:27,595 --> 02:00:30,181
Where do you think?
Back on the battlefield.

1374
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:33,017
<i>I need you here now.</i>

1375
02:00:34,435 --> 02:00:36,437
<i>I found this real evil dude.</i>

1376
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:41,108
<i>Someone who chews up the law
and spits it back out.</i>

1377
02:00:41,817 --> 02:00:43,861
<i>And I may need to teach you a lesson</i>

1378
02:00:44,362 --> 02:00:45,821
Dragging me back into the sewer?

1379
02:00:45,905 --> 02:00:48,199
Looks like it's pretty filthy this time.

1380
02:00:48,282 --> 02:00:49,784
Keep your phone on, all right?

1381
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:29,657
Please follow me, everyone.

1382
02:01:30,658 --> 02:01:31,659
This way.

1383
02:01:31,742 --> 02:01:33,160
Go on inside.

1384
02:01:53,347 --> 02:01:54,473
Oy!

1385
02:01:54,557 --> 02:01:56,142
Hey, you bloody idiot!

1386
02:01:56,225 --> 02:01:58,602
Quit slacking off, and get back to work!
