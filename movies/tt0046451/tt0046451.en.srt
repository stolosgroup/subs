00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,738
Max, get a load of this.

3
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:32,619
50 MILLION IN ORLY GOLD BULLION
ROBBERY... STILL MISSING

4
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,090
Here's your paper, Dédé.

5
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,290
Come see us, Max.
You won't be sorry.

6
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:47,163
It was obvious during rehearsals.
It's our best show yet.

7
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,100
I think so, too.
It really isn't bad.

8
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:53,401
You tell him, Riton.
- You gotta come, Max.

9
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:58,570
Lola's a mermaid in the second number.
It'll give the johns heart failure.

10
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,147
Yeah, I know.

11
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,383
Where you going?

12
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,389
To play my tune.

13
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,974
- Here's the cake you wanted.
- It looks delicious.

14
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,014
Dig the squares.

15
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,083
Can we get some service here?

16
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,119
We're here for dinner.
- Sorry. All booked up.

17
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,121
- What about those tables?
- Reserved.

18
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,522
We can have drinks while we wait.

19
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,424
Try Victor's.

20
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,331
It's an excellent restaurant.
Just across the street.

21
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,594
- Victor's it is.
- Just tell them I sent you.

22
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,467
Those chumps just don't get it.

23
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,343
Already she's got an attitude!

24
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,479
She's right.

25
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,475
There's no room for you
if I take just anyone in.

26
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:18,286
You might've given them some cake.
Their mouths were watering.

27
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,352
I was closing.

28
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,052
Evening, Madame Bouche.

29
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,726
You almost got tossed out, Marco.

30
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,159
- You eat yet?
- No, I'm not hungry.

31
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,440
Hello, kid.

32
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,842
Sit down.

33
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:41,280
Bouche, bring him a fork.

34
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,514
Don't let this cake go to waste.
We blow enough dough here.

35
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,880
What'll you drink?

36
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,387
Bring him a coffee.

37
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,515
So, Max, you coming or not?

38
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,652
If you don't like it,
you can always take off.

39
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,753
Nobody's forced to stay.

40
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:06,065
I'll come,
but I can't promise I'll stay.

41
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,571
Marco can tag along.

42
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,736
If I split, he can keep you company.

43
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,547
Watching mermaids...
will be a change.

44
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,726
Something eating you?

45
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,825
You owe some dough here?

46
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,398
9,000.

47
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,161
Relax. I'll take care of it.

48
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,171
Why should you?

49
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,101
Put this on Marco's tab.

50
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,643
That's swell of you.

51
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,306
Give me my bill.

52
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,043
All ready.

53
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,618
Not hungry?

54
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,555
We're gonna be late.

55
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,286
- We already are.
- Ready?

56
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,192
I have to let you out.

57
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,060
- Swell dinner, Madame Bouche.
- Just fine.

58
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,997
I don't poison my customers.

59
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,194
You can't take a compliment.

60
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,770
Move it.

61
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,241
You have 11,000 credit here.

62
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,871
- How can I thank you?
- Skip it.

63
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,688
Sit next to your boyfriend.

64
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,024
Violets, lady?

65
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,460
100 francs. Cheap.
- I don't want any.

66
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,028
Be nice.

67
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,230
Dumb bitch.

68
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,341
- See you after the show?
- Yeah, right.

69
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,539
You'll still be hoofing it
when I start snoring.

70
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,642
Go on and snore...

71
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,211
at my place.

72
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:05,022
Stick around, Max.
It won't be any fun without you.

73
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:09,022
After midnight I always feel
like I'm doing overtime.

74
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,353
Stay anyway.

75
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,101
Lola's happy now.

76
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,554
I warned you about that stuff!

77
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,688
- Don't park it too far.
- I won't, Mr. Riton.

78
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,160
Don't just stand there.

79
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,020
Albert, a brandy.

80
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,683
Always late.
Next time I'll fine you both.

81
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,351
We'll be ready, madame.

82
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,656
Get dressed.
And none of your lip.

83
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:56,134
It's not their fault, Marinette.
We're just too irresistible.

84
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,262
We had to force 'em to come.

85
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,637
You expect thanks
for causing a flap in my henhouse?

86
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,677
I'll give you a nice table
for the floor show.

87
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,715
How's this? My best table.

88
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,417
- It's only natural, my pet.
- Ain't it though?

89
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,619
If you'll excuse me...

90
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,797
Don't bother.
A bottle of bubbly. Dry.

91
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,232
And make it good, eh?

92
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,304
Order a magnum for us three.

93
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,304
You're right. A magnum.

94
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,576
Hello, kid.

95
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,021
You made a hit, daddy-o.

96
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,785
That's Vera the Russki.
We got a thing going.

97
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:57,591
You've got your hands full.
Those babes are a real health hazard.

98
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,660
And away we go.

99
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,939
Mr. Angelo wants to see you
in Pierrot's office.

100
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,652
Excuse me.

101
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,840
Can I give you a hand
carrying all that?

102
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,878
You ought to know better, Mr. Max.

103
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,279
- Where you going?
- To see your man.

104
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,166
<i>Come in.</i>

105
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,806
- Hope you don't mind.
- Not at all.

106
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,975
How you doing, Fats?

107
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,977
Ramon, leave us alone.

108
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,479
You can take the wheels.

109
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,521
Here's what it's all about.

110
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:33,315
We're counting on your experience...
to referee a spat we're having.

111
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,452
Well?

112
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,758
You tell him.

113
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,026
You know I've always supplied
the dope here.

114
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,369
And never a gripe from anyone.

115
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,530
Pure stuff at the right weight.

116
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,439
Just a sec.

117
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,575
Hey, Ramon.

118
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,011
Don't need the keys?

119
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,102
What do you think of Ramon?

120
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,467
I don't think anything.
I couldn't give a damn about him.

121
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,445
All I know is Fats here
isn't crazy about him.

122
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,817
Anyway, I think you can work it out.

123
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,385
A matter of the right man.

124
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,286
I don't know, Max.

125
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,821
I don't think you know Ramon.

126
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,392
No. Anyway, your dope racket
is specialized.

127
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:49,397
You need a guy with style
who fits in among the clientele.

128
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,462
I run a serious house,
with good connections.

129
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,199
It's cost me.

130
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,741
I won't get closed down
just to be nice to Ramon.

131
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,644
Ramon's a bum.

132
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,711
Keep him as a driver.
It's all he's good for.

133
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,719
I've got an idea.
I think I have just the man.

134
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,291
Anyhow, I'll vouch for him.

135
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,085
If he's game,
I'll send him right up.

136
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,732
I like Max. He's a pal.

137
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,808
You mind?

138
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,411
Help yourself.

139
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,713
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

140
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,588
And when he likes someone...

141
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,358
he's a friend for life.

142
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,359
Take Riton, for example.

143
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,987
It's lasted 20 years.
From what I hear.

144
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,692
Yeah, they've been
a team for 20 years.

145
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,838
Now that's friendship.

146
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,496
The same goes for me and Max.

147
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,603
I've got something for you.

148
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,940
Got anything on now?

149
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,302
Angelo needs a guy to sell dope here.

150
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,311
He's got his own crew.

151
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,511
Pierrot doesn't like his crew.

152
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,113
So I gave you a plug.

153
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,188
They're waiting for you upstairs
to discuss it.

154
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:56,759
I vouched for you,
so don't louse things up.

155
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,204
So, porcupine-head?

156
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,890
I'm fed up. I'm splitting.
You staying?

157
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,433
Have one last drink.
For the road.

158
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,469
The road!
I've heard that one.

159
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:15,098
We may end up
having a bottle with Pierrot.

160
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,775
Then the girls will want us
to take 'em out for onion soup.

161
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,114
Then we gotta get it on.
- So?

162
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:26,811
No "so!"
I'm not in the mood. I'm beat.

163
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,587
Don't give me that.

164
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,654
I'll go tell Lola I'm going.

165
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,989
She might meet the pigeon
of her life tonight.

166
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,153
I don't want to ruin her career.

167
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:16,129
Thanks a million, Max.
The deal's on. You were swell.

168
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,702
Dry up.

169
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,832
Come on in.

170
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,905
No harm done.

171
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,411
I was just congratulating Josy.

172
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,347
And so you should.
I was out there... and Josy was tops!

173
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,043
She's a hoot, isn't she?

174
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,011
Well, I'm off.
Thanks for Marco.

175
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,023
Don't be stupid.

176
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,191
We gotta talk, Max.

177
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,766
What about?

178
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,062
I don't love Riton anymore.

179
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,803
It's been quite a while.

180
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,805
Why tell me?

181
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,068
Because you just saw me with Angelo.

182
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:03,441
And only you can make Riton see
he's gotta let me go.

183
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,147
Talk to him.
I don't have the nerve.

184
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,681
Angelo's right. You're a hoot.

185
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:11,985
He'd listen if you talk to him.

186
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,095
Don't be mad at me.

187
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:21,194
I need your help. I'm so afraid
of what might happen to me.

188
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,704
If you see Lola... -
Skip it. Here she comes.

189
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,972
The dresser had to lower my neckline

190
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,979
to show more of my boobs.

191
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:38,050
Don't let me down.
Only you can help me.

192
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:41,314
Excuse me. I'm leaving.
I'm shot.

193
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,487
Not waiting for me?

194
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,088
Call that a man!
- Get in here!

195
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,193
That's the third time
the electrician jabbed my behind.

196
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,430
- I thought he only did it to me.
- You, too?

197
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,986
- Staying?
- I'm going, and so are you.

198
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,921
Listen, Riton...

199
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,660
Haven't you screwed around enough?
At your age? With your reputation?

200
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,858
That's what you look like now.

201
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:31,300
Look at those chumps.
Mr. Dugenet and his twitch.

202
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,908
Duglandin, the fatso over there.

203
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,279
And best of all,
Dufion, the bogeyman.

204
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:47,079
Dropping a bundle
while waiting to pick up showgirls.

205
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,114
And you're just like them.

206
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:54,990
Waiting patiently for madame
to get dressed to take her to the hotel.

207
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,189
You're a real jerk, old man.

208
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,958
A jerk? Why am I a jerk?

209
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:03,160
Ten years ago
you'd have waited for her

210
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,396
to come home with the bread.

211
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,699
Now she hasn't a chance
of meeting a john.

212
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,504
Whether she makes money now or not,
I don't give a damn.

213
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,240
All the more reason.

214
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,044
Start spoiling a broad
and she'll take off.

215
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,481
So go home to bed.

216
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,181
Josy knows the way home.
What's more,

217
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:28,560
a little worrying
will keep her in her place.

218
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,392
You're right. Let's go.

219
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,569
It's on the house.
Orders from the boss.

220
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,207
Thank him for us.

221
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,111
Drop you off?

222
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:54,414
I won't make you drive across town.
I'll take a cab.

223
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,917
See you tomorrow.
1:00 at Bouche's.

224
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,492
25, Rue Alphonse Allais.

225
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:42,065
That ambulance is tailing us.

226
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,666
It passed the hospital.

227
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,674
To go to another hospital maybe.

228
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,945
Give it a little gas, just to see.

229
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,360
That's enough. Don't overdo it.

230
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,954
Your street's coming up.
We'll see.

231
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:30,206
Slow down.
My building's third on the right.

232
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,836
Take off and don't turn around.

233
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,142
So, Mr. Ramon,

234
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:08,270
this a new game?

235
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,144
Ambulance rally and surprise party?

236
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,548
We're not here for you.

237
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,177
Going to see the midwife maybe?

238
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,888
I'll wake her up for you.

239
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,887
You nuts, Max? Stop it!

240
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:29,320
A brandy. Got a phone token?

241
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,389
You don't need one. Go ahead.

242
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,941
<i>Mr. Henri, please.</i>

243
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,515
Mr. Henri what?

244
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,083
Henri Ducros.

245
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,221
I call him Mr. Riton.

246
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,520
Count me in for 50%.

247
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,529
<i>You won't regret it.</i>

248
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,069
Excuse me, fellas.

249
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,607
Listen to me.

250
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,737
<i>- I'm listening.
- Anybody with you?</i>

251
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:32,283
I'm with Angelo and Bastien.
We're talking over a job.

252
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,046
Listen good, Riton.

253
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,245
Don't leave your room for anything.

254
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,892
There's something fishy
going on. Get me?

255
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:43,925
Sure.

256
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,125
Get rid of them fast.

257
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,293
Once they're gone, pick up again.

258
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:54,739
Just a sec.

259
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,483
Rotten luck, guys.

260
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,443
I can't come with you.

261
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:11,717
Family troubles.
I can't get out of it.

262
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,459
This is a real drag, Riton.

263
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,823
I was counting on you.

264
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:23,231
They're counting on me, too,
and have for a lot longer.

265
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,807
Had I known,
I'd have asked someone else.

266
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,933
You'll find someone.

267
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,111
- Sorry for the bother.
- No bother.

268
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,211
It's me who's sorry.

269
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:42,481
So long, guys.
Some other time.

270
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:54,957
Still there?

271
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,466
Are they gone?

272
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,035
Hold on.

273
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:18,350
They just drove off. What's up?

274
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,357
I'll tell you in person.

275
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:25,158
Take your heap and meet me
outside 40, Rue des Détroits.

276
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:30,028
Right, 40. Two times 20.
Near the Porte des Ternes.

277
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,467
Make sure you aren't tailed.

278
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,038
Gotcha.

279
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,253
We need more customers like him.

280
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,238
- Nobody shadowed you?
- No, I was careful.

281
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,447
Drive in here... -
Shove over. I'll drive.

282
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,947
Where are we?

283
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:27,424
I got a place in the building.
We'll park in the garage.

284
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:39,130
What's this monkey business
with Angelo?

285
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,337
It's a long story.
I'll tell you upstairs.

286
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,392
It's about time you saw something.

287
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,564
Whose is this?

288
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,141
Mine.

289
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,167
Must have cost a million.

290
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,043
More than that, buddy.
It's a special.

291
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,615
How much?

292
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,550
Five million.

293
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,710
Come take a look.

294
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:41,859
Here's our piggy bank.
I stashed our loot in cartridge cases.

295
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:46,294
Two gold bars per case.

296
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,565
That makes 50 pounds.
Easier to carry this way.

297
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:56,546
And you run around
with our 50 million under your ass?

298
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:00,584
You nuts? I brought this heap over
straight from the factory

299
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,654
the night before our job.

300
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:06,949
The next day I stashed it away.
It's been here ever since.

301
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,387
See? I played it right.

302
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,396
Why d'you say that?

303
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,179
I don't get it, Max.

304
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,683
I'll explain upstairs.

305
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,491
Funny lock you got there.

306
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,565
Ever heard of burglars?

307
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,863
You never told me about this crib.

308
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:32,876
It's just a little investment.
I don't come here often.

309
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,913
Sit down. I'll be right back.

310
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:40,951
Not bad.

311
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,847
I almost like it better
than your other pad.

312
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,823
It's quieter.

313
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,127
The other one was quiet, too.

314
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,785
Not anymore.

315
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,131
Sit down, I said.

316
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:12,147
Try some of this.
It's from a pal in Nantes.

317
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,795
You'll have to settle for biscuits.

318
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,924
Dig in.

319
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:08,337
Remember tonight, at the club...

320
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,503
I left you to see Lola?

321
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,704
Know who was in her dressing room?

322
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,949
Josy and Angelo going at it
like there was no tomorrow.

323
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,679
Why didn't you tell me?

324
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:29,749
I keep my mind on serious business,
not on petting parties.

325
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:31,854
I don't mix the two.

326
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,599
I hope you get my drift.

327
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:39,333
Now tell me why you told Josy.

328
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,975
What can I say?

329
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,180
To keep her hanging on.

330
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:53,517
She told me I'd come to nothing,

331
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,587
that I'd never have a joint
like Pierrot and Marinette.

332
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,792
So I told her not to worry.

333
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,928
I had what we needed.

334
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:12,059
You're right. I'm a chump.

335
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,970
More like a dope, if you ask me.

336
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,705
But the real problem is Angelo.

337
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:20,934
What's Angelo after?

338
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,915
You really have no idea?

339
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:29,646
No idea why he invited you out
on a bum steer at 2:00 a.m.?

340
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:32,214
Use your brains, for once.

341
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,123
I still don't see.

342
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:35,853
I'll tell you.

343
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:38,828
To take you somewhere quiet
and work you over

344
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,761
to get our stash.

345
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,390
And for insurance,
he tried to snatch me, too.

346
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,934
Get the picture now?

347
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,839
I'll settle Angelo's score.

348
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,644
Sure you will.
Rub him and his boys out?

349
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,009
So? That's my business.

350
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:58,082
You're gonna keep us out of this.

351
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:02,144
This was my last job.
We were sitting pretty.

352
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,745
I'd been waiting for this.

353
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:08,292
I was fed up years ago
with all our bullshit.

354
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,594
I want to retire, understand?

355
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,127
I know, Max.

356
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,430
Get a load of your mug.

357
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:25,140
The bags under your eyes.
And mine.

358
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,679
And this, and this.
Think we're a pretty sight?

359
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:31,778
No, pal, it's time to sign off.

360
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,214
You're exaggerating.

361
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,513
Like hell I am.
I know what's what.

362
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,423
Poor Riton.

363
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,626
I'll tell you what we'll do.

364
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,925
Tomorrow, we swap our gold bars
for nice little banknotes.

365
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:53,131
I wanted to wait,
but you had to be a wise guy.

366
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,736
So we don't fix Angelo?

367
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:01,869
Nope. We even let him have Josy.
It'll do you a favor.

368
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,046
Not hungry?

369
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,122
We better turn in
if we're gonna get any shut-eye.

370
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:41,082
Some pajamas.

371
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,154
And a towel.

372
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,497
Here's a toothbrush.
There's toothpaste on the sink.

373
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:33,222
Take your own bed.
I can crash here.

374
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,798
Suit yourself.

375
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,766
About Josy,
what would you do in my shoes?

376
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:14,839
How should I know?

377
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,573
I'll never be in your shoes,
you knucklehead.

378
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:54,357
Hello, angel.

379
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:01,236
Your uncle's in a meeting.
You can wait in my office.

380
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,882
Put it down there.

381
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,665
This stuff's heavy.

382
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,550
As lovely as ever.

383
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:51,019
Be serious, Max.
He's your uncle, after all.

384
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,850
This way it stays in the family.

385
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,758
It's a pleasure to see
our friends in good shape.

386
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:03,265
You ignore them.
We haven't seen you in months.

387
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:06,231
Business, doll, business.

388
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,583
Count on me, sir.

389
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:28,591
Thank you, my good man.

390
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,539
Hello, Uncle.

391
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,744
Go on in. I'm in a hurry.

392
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,746
Take the other two.

393
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:57,587
I'm not taking any calls.

394
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,801
This all of it?

395
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:12,563
In what form?

396
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,864
Gold bars.

397
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:23,138
No certificates of origin, of course?

398
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,442
Maybe you'd like an invoice, too?

399
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,514
How much is there?

400
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,086
200 pounds.

401
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:35,793
This junk is heavy!

402
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,130
It's yellow stuff.

403
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,822
This the best you can offer me?

404
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:14,891
REWARD...
STOLEN SEPT. 5, 1953... - ORLY AIRPORT

405
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,968
8 GOLD BARS... - 25 POUNDS EACH

406
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:24,297
Think business is easy?

407
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,603
I'm not crazy about this.

408
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:31,847
Isn't it your line?
How much can you offer?

409
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:35,541
35 million.

410
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:41,056
You're way off the mark.
They're worth at least 50.

411
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:44,184
Sure, with a certificate of origin.

412
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:48,162
But I have to melt them down,
find fake reference numbers.

413
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,466
All that costs.

414
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,465
If you don't like it, I'm out.

415
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:55,334
Get them out of here.

416
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,168
This isn't a warehouse.

417
00:47:57,475 --> 00:47:59,102
You're getting greedy, Oscar.

418
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:04,409
What about all the bloodsuckers
I have to pay off to keep quiet,

419
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:08,281
so that they don't have a chance
to get too nosy?

420
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:11,150
You gonna grease their palms for me?

421
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:21,363
Pour us some drinks.

422
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:26,195
You're all the same.
To you, a fence is a crook.

423
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,837
Don't waste your breath.
Just cough up.

424
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:33,503
35 million just like that?

425
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:36,705
Think I have that much on hand?

426
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:42,012
First, I have to get rid of them
one by one.

427
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,115
It'll take at least 10 days.

428
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:48,924
Gold coins would have gone quicker.

429
00:49:10,715 --> 00:49:11,977
Cheers.

430
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,641
Not drinking?
- Never in the morning.

431
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:23,023
I want it in 10,000-franc notes.

432
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:26,859
Divided equally into two packets.

433
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,164
Count it out right.

434
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,496
I am your uncle, after all.

435
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,270
Ain't I lucky.

436
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,245
So long, kid.

437
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,110
As soon as it's ready,
call me at PER 5590.

438
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:53,713
My new place.

439
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,792
Relax, it'll all go smoothly.

440
00:50:43,942 --> 00:50:45,534
Hold the line.

441
00:50:58,423 --> 00:50:59,583
Just a second.

442
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:22,278
Forget about her.

443
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,367
Yes, what is it?

444
00:51:43,468 --> 00:51:47,302
It's about time!
I want Miss Josy in Room 16.

445
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:48,372
She's out.

446
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:50,668
Have you seen Mr. Riton?

447
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,242
Who's calling?

448
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,774
Hello, Mr. Max.

449
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:59,416
Mr. Riton just left in an ambulance.

450
00:52:01,753 --> 00:52:03,653
Did you see the ambulance?

451
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,051
What color was it?

452
00:52:06,158 --> 00:52:07,819
I didn't notice.

453
00:52:07,926 --> 00:52:10,326
What happened to Mr. Riton?

454
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:12,487
I don't really know.

455
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:17,060
You'd best ask Miss Josy
when she comes in. That all?

456
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:20,031
Yeah, that's all.

457
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,287
<i>That Riton!</i>

458
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:42,122
<i>What a pain!
He's been a pain for years.</i>

459
00:52:43,295 --> 00:52:45,229
<i>Always lousing things up.</i>

460
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:49,027
<i>What a dope!
Jesus, how dumb can you get!</i>

461
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:54,796
<i>He thinks he's a big shot
because he's got guts.</i>

462
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:58,832
<i>He may have balls,
but what a jerk!</i>

463
00:53:00,145 --> 00:53:03,114
<i>I never should've hooked up
with a mug like him.</i>

464
00:53:04,716 --> 00:53:08,379
<i>The jobs I could've pulled off
if I didn't have him on my back.</i>

465
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,583
<i>Well, it's my own damn fault.</i>

466
00:53:12,524 --> 00:53:15,288
<i>I should've worked on my own.</i>

467
00:53:17,062 --> 00:53:19,121
<i>But I let feelings get in the way.</i>

468
00:53:20,131 --> 00:53:21,826
<i>Well, that'll teach me.</i>

469
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:30,368
<i>But how'd I get mixed up
with a guy like that?</i>

470
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:35,713
<i>Not to mention the bread
he's cost me for 20 years.</i>

471
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:39,750
<i>Forking out for his lawyers,
for his mother.</i>

472
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:44,218
<i>Not a tooth in his mouth
that hasn't cost me a bundle.</i>

473
00:53:45,957 --> 00:53:47,925
<i>Well, tough.
He's on his own now.</i>

474
00:54:21,693 --> 00:54:24,127
<i>- That you, Max?
- If it isn't you!</i>

475
00:54:24,229 --> 00:54:27,198
Are you free for lunch?

476
00:54:27,299 --> 00:54:29,233
For you, always.

477
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:33,668
I'd like to invite you over.
A wonderful idea, don't you think?

478
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:37,708
I'll just slip into another suit
and be over in half an hour.

479
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:39,607
See you soon.

480
00:56:23,748 --> 00:56:25,045
<i>Poor Riton.</i>

481
00:56:25,984 --> 00:56:27,884
<i>I'm a real bastard.</i>

482
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:31,617
Do you love me, Max?

483
00:56:36,461 --> 00:56:37,519
Just a second.

484
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:58,648
You're a funny guy.

485
00:56:59,317 --> 00:57:02,514
I don't really know who you are.

486
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,315
And that bugs you?

487
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:09,283
I have to go.

488
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,831
See you tomorrow?

489
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:09,852
- Hello, Mr. Max.
- Hello, kid.

490
00:58:18,763 --> 00:58:21,027
Interested in working with me?
I need some backup.

491
00:58:21,466 --> 00:58:24,401
We'll be dishing it out
but taking it, too.

492
00:58:24,903 --> 00:58:27,167
I'll make it worth your while.

493
00:58:27,906 --> 00:58:31,239
But I'm warning you.
It's no piece of cake. Well?

494
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:34,872
Sure thing. Riton's not with you?

495
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:39,311
No, that's just it.
I'll explain on the way.

496
00:58:39,584 --> 00:58:41,051
Count me in.

497
00:58:41,152 --> 00:58:43,552
There's something
I gotta do first.

498
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,254
There's fish soup
and roast chicken.

499
00:58:53,965 --> 00:58:55,557
Take a look.

500
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:57,931
Looks nice, but I'm not eating.

501
00:58:58,336 --> 00:58:59,598
Step outside.

502
00:59:06,578 --> 00:59:07,670
Wait.

503
00:59:13,585 --> 00:59:17,077
I'm on a job that may turn nasty.

504
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:20,353
I'm leaving you a few grand,
just in case.

505
00:59:21,192 --> 00:59:25,629
If I get into hot water,
it'll cover the lawyers and packages.

506
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,267
You're the best.

507
00:59:34,439 --> 00:59:35,701
Let's go, kid.

508
01:00:03,835 --> 01:00:06,030
<i>- Chez Bouche?
- This is it.</i>

509
01:00:06,137 --> 01:00:09,698
<i>- Is Max there?
- Mr. Max? Who's calling?</i>

510
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:11,336
<i>It's Angelo.</i>

511
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:13,910
You're out of luck. He just left.

512
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:15,844
<i>Is he coming back?</i>

513
01:00:15,947 --> 01:00:17,744
I have no idea.

514
01:01:31,439 --> 01:01:33,805
Open the door for me.

515
01:01:33,908 --> 01:01:37,105
It's occupied.
There's someone there now.

516
01:01:39,214 --> 01:01:41,148
Open up. It's me, Max.

517
01:01:41,816 --> 01:01:43,477
<i>I can't open now!</i>

518
01:01:43,718 --> 01:01:45,276
<i>I tell you it's Max.</i>

519
01:01:46,588 --> 01:01:48,385
What did I tell you?

520
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:51,425
- I want to talk to you.
- I'm busy.

521
01:01:51,526 --> 01:01:53,323
You gonna whine now?

522
01:02:00,769 --> 01:02:02,737
Tell me what happened.

523
01:02:04,572 --> 01:02:06,199
Talk! What happened?

524
01:02:06,308 --> 01:02:08,003
I can explain, Max.

525
01:02:08,109 --> 01:02:09,599
Were you here?

526
01:02:09,711 --> 01:02:12,202
Then beat it.
I'm talking to Josy.

527
01:02:16,184 --> 01:02:17,811
Riton was here.

528
01:02:18,353 --> 01:02:20,321
They jumped him when he walked in.

529
01:02:20,422 --> 01:02:21,389
Who?

530
01:02:22,424 --> 01:02:23,584
First, Jojo...

531
01:02:23,692 --> 01:02:25,592
Where was Jojo?

532
01:02:25,694 --> 01:02:29,596
There, behind the door.
I'll show you.

533
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:33,759
He slugged him.

534
01:02:33,868 --> 01:02:36,735
So he was in your room?

535
01:02:40,742 --> 01:02:42,835
After you saw us together,

536
01:02:42,944 --> 01:02:46,380
Angelo sent him over
to protect me from Riton.

537
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:49,178
Jojo makes one.
Who else was there?

538
01:02:51,886 --> 01:02:54,787
Angelo was waiting next door
with Ramon.

539
01:02:56,891 --> 01:02:58,518
But I didn't know.

540
01:02:58,626 --> 01:03:01,493
Not until the porter phoned them.

541
01:03:01,596 --> 01:03:05,896
I recognized Angelo's voice
just before Riton knocked.

542
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,558
That's a lie.

543
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,605
That's for starters.

544
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:16,006
So I suggest you start talking.

545
01:03:17,045 --> 01:03:19,912
I told them he was coming up.
Maybe I was wrong to.

546
01:03:20,782 --> 01:03:22,374
You sure were.

547
01:03:26,821 --> 01:03:28,584
Where'd they take him?

548
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:32,820
I don't know, Max.
If I did, I'd tell you right off.

549
01:03:33,828 --> 01:03:35,625
And Angelo's hideout?

550
01:03:39,033 --> 01:03:40,898
Where did you make love?

551
01:03:42,971 --> 01:03:44,233
In a hotel.

552
01:03:46,775 --> 01:03:48,936
You know too much or too little!

553
01:03:49,377 --> 01:03:51,277
Who asked you?

554
01:03:52,881 --> 01:03:54,678
Do you know anything?

555
01:03:55,717 --> 01:03:58,686
Honest to God,
I don't have any addresses.

556
01:03:58,787 --> 01:04:00,948
What'd they pay to shut you up?

557
01:04:06,094 --> 01:04:07,322
50,000 francs.

558
01:04:08,596 --> 01:04:10,120
Let's have it.

559
01:04:16,538 --> 01:04:18,563
I'll deal with you two later.

560
01:04:18,673 --> 01:04:20,607
What should I do, Max?

561
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:23,905
They wanted to take me, too.
But I ran away.

562
01:04:24,012 --> 01:04:25,707
Why'd you come back?

563
01:04:25,814 --> 01:04:27,611
To get my things.

564
01:04:27,849 --> 01:04:30,613
But I have no place to go.
Lola doesn't have room.

565
01:04:30,718 --> 01:04:32,913
Poor little lost bitch!

566
01:04:51,339 --> 01:04:52,533
Freeze.

567
01:05:13,194 --> 01:05:15,389
Small world, isn't it?

568
01:05:15,597 --> 01:05:16,859
Shove over.

569
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:23,735
How's Angelo?

570
01:05:24,839 --> 01:05:26,500
How should I know?

571
01:05:26,608 --> 01:05:28,508
We'll soon find out.

572
01:06:24,966 --> 01:06:25,990
Pierrot in?

573
01:06:33,675 --> 01:06:37,111
Hello, Fats. I need your help.

574
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,179
- What is it?
- But not if it bugs your woman.

575
01:06:42,283 --> 01:06:43,580
Relax. Tell me.

576
01:06:43,685 --> 01:06:47,018
Angelo and his boys
are giving me a hard time.

577
01:06:47,989 --> 01:06:50,116
It started last night

578
01:06:50,224 --> 01:06:52,692
and this morning they nabbed Riton.

579
01:06:53,227 --> 01:06:55,252
I want to know where they took him.

580
01:06:57,198 --> 01:06:58,665
Come with me.

581
01:07:30,465 --> 01:07:32,160
The cellar's better.

582
01:07:51,052 --> 01:07:54,112
- What're you gonna do?
- You'll find out, girlie! Move!

583
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:17,273
We're under the metro.

584
01:08:19,847 --> 01:08:21,815
Nobody will hear your screams.

585
01:08:31,325 --> 01:08:32,792
Now talk.

586
01:08:32,894 --> 01:08:34,794
But I didn't do anything!

587
01:08:37,065 --> 01:08:41,297
You weren't following me
to offer me candy. Punk!

588
01:08:41,402 --> 01:08:44,735
Angelo wanted to know
where you stashed your loot.

589
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:46,807
What loot?

590
01:08:46,908 --> 01:08:48,136
Tell him.

591
01:08:48,242 --> 01:08:51,234
He said you pulled a job
worth 50 million.

592
01:08:53,147 --> 01:08:54,705
It was you two?

593
01:08:55,783 --> 01:08:56,909
Keep going.

594
01:08:57,018 --> 01:09:01,250
He said if we nabbed you or Riton,
the other would squeal.

595
01:09:07,295 --> 01:09:08,626
Where's Riton?

596
01:09:08,963 --> 01:09:11,523
I don't know! I swear to God!

597
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:14,896
We're wasting our time.

598
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:28,806
Take off his jacket.

599
01:09:49,303 --> 01:09:50,770
Listen good, Fifi.

600
01:09:51,672 --> 01:09:53,799
We're gonna let you have it good.

601
01:09:54,342 --> 01:09:56,970
If you tell us where Riton is,
you'll save us some time.

602
01:09:57,612 --> 01:10:00,137
If you don't, you'll be real sorry.

603
01:10:04,018 --> 01:10:05,178
Congratulations.

604
01:10:05,286 --> 01:10:08,221
What are you doing here?
Who invited you?

605
01:10:09,223 --> 01:10:10,986
There's a call for Max.

606
01:10:11,092 --> 01:10:12,616
Who from?

607
01:10:12,727 --> 01:10:15,195
Angelo. He'll call back.

608
01:10:19,367 --> 01:10:20,959
I don't get it.

609
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:23,398
How can he know I'm here?

610
01:10:23,504 --> 01:10:25,165
- I know how.
- Then talk.

611
01:10:25,273 --> 01:10:26,740
Untie me first.

612
01:10:33,881 --> 01:10:35,246
Stay with him.

613
01:10:37,652 --> 01:10:38,880
Angelo?

614
01:10:43,925 --> 01:10:45,187
<i>That you, Max?</i>

615
01:10:46,627 --> 01:10:48,788
This is Angelo. You hear me?

616
01:10:50,431 --> 01:10:54,868
Listen. There's no time to lose.
You want Riton back alive?

617
01:10:56,003 --> 01:10:56,992
I'm listening.

618
01:10:57,705 --> 01:11:00,697
I've got nothing against Riton or you.

619
01:11:00,808 --> 01:11:03,868
All I want is your loot,
and within the hour.

620
01:11:04,779 --> 01:11:07,043
I'll put Riton on
so you know he's here.

621
01:11:20,528 --> 01:11:22,086
Yeah, it's me.

622
01:11:22,196 --> 01:11:23,390
Don't give in.

623
01:11:24,065 --> 01:11:25,532
Put Angelo on again.

624
01:11:25,633 --> 01:11:27,100
Don't give in, Max.

625
01:11:27,201 --> 01:11:28,930
Put him on, I said.

626
01:11:31,672 --> 01:11:33,401
You heard him?

627
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:36,866
If you care about his health,
you better act quick.

628
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:38,878
You get me, Max?

629
01:11:40,982 --> 01:11:42,040
Listen...

630
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:45,719
I propose a setup
that gives us equal guarantees.

631
01:11:47,688 --> 01:11:50,452
Break out the rods
and bring that louse Fifi up.

632
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:54,249
<i>Now listen good.
Put the loot in your car.</i>

633
01:12:04,939 --> 01:12:06,668
We're going places.

634
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:10,941
We're taking him upstairs.

635
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,168
- You're gonna do some work.
- Sure thing.

636
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:53,679
<i>Nights are for sleeping.
I do my business during the day.</i>

637
01:12:53,854 --> 01:12:55,845
Let me get a word in!

638
01:12:55,957 --> 01:12:58,221
You can say what you like.

639
01:12:58,826 --> 01:13:01,852
I hate being woken up.

640
01:13:02,563 --> 01:13:04,531
I can never get back to sleep.

641
01:13:04,732 --> 01:13:06,962
<i>Listen, I'm in a jam.</i>

642
01:13:07,068 --> 01:13:09,400
I need my merchandise right now.

643
01:13:09,503 --> 01:13:12,472
Have Eugene bring my cases down.
Is he there?

644
01:13:12,573 --> 01:13:15,007
I'll have to wake him up.

645
01:13:15,109 --> 01:13:17,009
I'll be over in 10 minutes.

646
01:13:18,145 --> 01:13:20,409
Thanks a lot.
Sorry for the bother.

647
01:13:24,518 --> 01:13:26,145
Put it down here.

648
01:13:28,255 --> 01:13:29,483
Sit down.

649
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:41,665
Help me with the hardware.

650
01:13:53,447 --> 01:13:55,244
What do you want?

651
01:13:55,716 --> 01:13:57,616
Come in and shut the door.

652
01:14:04,258 --> 01:14:05,816
Thanks a lot, Max.

653
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:08,888
I'm sorry, Marinette.
Someone's on my back.

654
01:14:09,063 --> 01:14:12,965
I had no choice.
We'll tell you about it later.

655
01:14:13,067 --> 01:14:14,796
If we feel like it.

656
01:14:17,104 --> 01:14:18,935
Take him with you.

657
01:14:25,479 --> 01:14:27,947
I'll be right down. Go on.

658
01:14:32,253 --> 01:14:35,882
You'll get your man back in no time.
You have my word.

659
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:39,255
At my age,
there's no second chance.

660
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,260
I said you have my word.

661
01:15:23,938 --> 01:15:26,668
You leaving me here?
How am I gonna get back?

662
01:15:26,774 --> 01:15:28,799
Try hunting snails, daddy-o.

663
01:16:17,992 --> 01:16:19,619
Pass me the goods.

664
01:16:42,349 --> 01:16:43,907
Hear that?

665
01:16:45,219 --> 01:16:46,345
It must be them.

666
01:16:48,689 --> 01:16:49,678
Here they come.

667
01:16:52,393 --> 01:16:54,122
Looks like it.

668
01:16:55,095 --> 01:16:57,325
Take it off.
What's it matter now?

669
01:16:57,431 --> 01:16:58,864
Soon enough.

670
01:17:02,036 --> 01:17:03,503
Get out, Riton.

671
01:17:26,694 --> 01:17:27,661
Answer.

672
01:17:31,632 --> 01:17:33,224
Go ahead, and watch out.

673
01:18:01,395 --> 01:18:02,828
Hey, Marco...

674
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:05,490
- That's me, Marco.
- Don't say hello!

675
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,458
Hello.

676
01:18:18,245 --> 01:18:19,712
Over this way.

677
01:18:27,321 --> 01:18:28,948
Search 'em, Riton.

678
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:40,634
- Clean.
- That'll do.

679
01:18:53,681 --> 01:18:55,080
Get moving.

680
01:19:06,093 --> 01:19:07,822
Put 'em down there.

681
01:19:13,133 --> 01:19:14,794
Now back off.

682
01:19:18,205 --> 01:19:19,263
There.

683
01:19:29,216 --> 01:19:31,514
I hope these gentlemen aren't armed.

684
01:19:32,486 --> 01:19:33,612
We're not.

685
01:19:34,988 --> 01:19:36,319
We're not either.

686
01:19:37,024 --> 01:19:39,288
Marco, over here.

687
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,628
May I?

688
01:20:10,057 --> 01:20:11,115
It's okay.

689
01:20:12,493 --> 01:20:14,051
Ain't we lucky.

690
01:20:24,071 --> 01:20:26,266
Wait till we're in the car.

691
01:20:26,673 --> 01:20:28,573
Till then, no one moves.

692
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,404
You coming with us?

693
01:20:54,268 --> 01:20:56,702
How about it?
I'd like to get to bed.

694
01:20:58,572 --> 01:21:00,039
We're off.

695
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:02,574
Behave yourselves.
For your own good.

696
01:21:51,124 --> 01:21:52,386
Move it!

697
01:21:52,493 --> 01:21:54,484
I tell you, they had two cars.

698
01:21:54,728 --> 01:21:57,697
I was blindfolded,
but I heard the other engine.

699
01:21:57,798 --> 01:21:59,060
Look!

700
01:22:08,609 --> 01:22:10,509
Take cover!

701
01:22:27,194 --> 01:22:29,526
Move back more.
We're in the open.

702
01:22:30,664 --> 01:22:34,191
I think I sprained something.

703
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,342
Turn around.

704
01:24:03,557 --> 01:24:05,286
They got him good.

705
01:24:17,037 --> 01:24:19,028
They won't get away with it.

706
01:24:19,139 --> 01:24:20,902
We won't get far in this.

707
01:24:21,108 --> 01:24:23,906
Riton, get their car, fast.

708
01:24:45,832 --> 01:24:47,459
Go get Marco.

709
01:25:34,548 --> 01:25:36,846
Where the hell are they?

710
01:25:49,162 --> 01:25:50,356
Here they come!

711
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:19,653
Floor it!

712
01:26:31,471 --> 01:26:34,201
The tires! Aim for the tires!

713
01:27:24,357 --> 01:27:26,518
Give me a hand! The loot!

714
01:27:34,467 --> 01:27:35,866
What?

715
01:27:45,212 --> 01:27:46,543
What?

716
01:28:09,536 --> 01:28:11,265
Let's get out of here.

717
01:28:59,286 --> 01:29:01,311
You shouldn't all be in here.

718
01:29:02,823 --> 01:29:04,620
He needs peace and quiet.

719
01:29:06,393 --> 01:29:08,293
What do you think, Doctor?

720
01:29:11,064 --> 01:29:12,463
He's tough.

721
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,869
He's already waking up.

722
01:29:31,251 --> 01:29:32,980
Still here, Max?

723
01:29:35,489 --> 01:29:37,389
So, porcupine-head?

724
01:29:38,692 --> 01:29:40,819
Pierrot, tell him to go.

725
01:29:40,928 --> 01:29:43,123
Where's the fire?

726
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:45,562
Go out, Max. Show yourself.

727
01:29:46,366 --> 01:29:48,266
Go to the restaurant.

728
01:29:48,635 --> 01:29:50,193
What time is it?

729
01:29:50,304 --> 01:29:51,999
6:00 in the morning.

730
01:29:53,974 --> 01:29:56,169
Riton's right.
You'd better leave.

731
01:29:56,543 --> 01:29:58,010
I'm off.

732
01:30:00,013 --> 01:30:02,140
See you later, Doctor.
- Good-bye, Max.

733
01:30:08,021 --> 01:30:10,581
You can come back after lunch.

734
01:30:14,261 --> 01:30:15,353
See you later.

735
01:30:26,907 --> 01:30:30,365
GUN BATTLE ON COUNTRY ROAD

736
01:30:30,477 --> 01:30:32,502
<i>You and your theories!</i>

737
01:30:32,613 --> 01:30:35,673
<i>You gotta stop going to the movies.</i>

738
01:30:35,782 --> 01:30:39,650
<i>I never go to the movies.
They hurt my eyes.</i>

739
01:30:39,753 --> 01:30:41,516
Get yourself glasses!

740
01:30:41,622 --> 01:30:43,089
So, what about it?

741
01:30:43,957 --> 01:30:47,017
The papers made it all up.

742
01:30:48,495 --> 01:30:50,292
But it's Angelo's photo!

743
01:30:50,397 --> 01:30:52,695
What's a photo prove?

744
01:30:52,799 --> 01:30:54,994
You could be run over tomorrow,

745
01:30:55,102 --> 01:30:59,334
and your picture'll be
in the papers with any old story.

746
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:02,374
So the Orly job was just a stunt?

747
01:31:02,476 --> 01:31:04,376
He didn't say that.

748
01:31:04,544 --> 01:31:06,705
But it wasn't Angelo.

749
01:31:06,813 --> 01:31:10,476
Angelo would never get mixed up
in something like that.

750
01:31:10,584 --> 01:31:12,313
Bouche, my cigarettes.

751
01:31:12,419 --> 01:31:14,250
I'm all out.

752
01:31:14,354 --> 01:31:19,758
But it was Angelo in the car
with the loot, wasn't it?

753
01:31:42,649 --> 01:31:45,447
How do you know it was him?

754
01:31:45,552 --> 01:31:48,112
They found his ring.

755
01:31:48,689 --> 01:31:50,589
The old ring trick!

756
01:31:51,958 --> 01:31:53,550
You can ask him.

757
01:31:57,864 --> 01:31:59,798
You're not so bad-looking.

758
01:32:00,801 --> 01:32:03,964
My friend Betty.
You haven't met her.

759
01:32:04,204 --> 01:32:06,365
I've told you about Madame Bouche.

760
01:32:07,641 --> 01:32:09,268
Sit down there.

761
01:32:13,947 --> 01:32:15,414
Excuse me.

762
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:18,943
- How about it, Max?
- What?

763
01:32:19,820 --> 01:32:22,152
- Haven't you seen the papers?
- Sure, why?

764
01:32:22,756 --> 01:32:25,782
You knew Angelo.
Tell him what you think.

765
01:32:25,892 --> 01:32:27,621
We've been discussing it for hours.

766
01:32:27,728 --> 01:32:30,196
That's swell of you,
but I'm going to have lunch.

767
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:34,266
How do you do it?

768
01:32:34,367 --> 01:32:35,925
Well, you know...

769
01:32:36,036 --> 01:32:37,799
That old devil Max.

770
01:32:39,506 --> 01:32:42,703
Order what you like.
I'm having roast beef.

771
01:32:43,376 --> 01:32:45,105
I have to make a call.

772
01:33:11,605 --> 01:33:13,698
Get me Mr. Pierrot.

773
01:33:13,807 --> 01:33:15,138
Hold the line.

774
01:33:25,385 --> 01:33:27,751
It's Mr. Max on the phone.

775
01:34:06,693 --> 01:34:08,320
Riton's dead, Max.

776
01:34:15,101 --> 01:34:16,090
Coming over?

777
01:34:18,138 --> 01:34:20,038
I only just arrived at Bouche's.

778
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,267
Leaving now would look funny.

779
01:34:23,276 --> 01:34:24,538
You're right.

780
01:34:25,712 --> 01:34:29,546
Take your time eating.
The main thing's to be seen in public.

781
01:34:30,317 --> 01:34:32,012
Sure. See you later.

782
01:34:36,289 --> 01:34:39,190
You wear glasses now?
I never noticed.

783
01:34:39,292 --> 01:34:41,192
They're for reading.

784
01:34:41,494 --> 01:34:43,462
You'll need them soon enough.

785
01:34:44,798 --> 01:34:46,857
Do I hold on to your money?

786
01:34:47,701 --> 01:34:49,635
For the time being.

787
01:34:49,803 --> 01:34:52,169
You ready for us?
- Go and sit down.

788
01:34:53,673 --> 01:34:56,267
I'm not mad!
You're a bore!

789
01:34:56,376 --> 01:34:58,367
Let's hear your story.

790
01:34:58,478 --> 01:35:00,912
- But you know it.
- No, I don't.

791
01:35:01,014 --> 01:35:03,244
Well, it's too late.

792
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:05,250
And he says he's not mad.

793
01:35:05,352 --> 01:35:08,651
Say, Max,
Bébert's angry about Angelo.

794
01:35:08,755 --> 01:35:10,950
Just deal and shut up.

795
01:35:12,726 --> 01:35:14,455
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

796
01:35:14,561 --> 01:35:15,755
What's the ante?

797
01:35:15,862 --> 01:35:18,330
- 3,000.
- If you want.

798
01:35:19,305 --> 01:36:19,286
