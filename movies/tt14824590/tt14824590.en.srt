00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:52,278
Let me go. I'm beggin' ya.

3
00:00:54,615 --> 00:00:56,310
Let me go.

4
00:00:56,437 --> 00:00:58,101
I'm beggin' ya.

5
00:00:59,574 --> 00:01:01,974
I already told ya
I didn't do it.

6
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:05,398
Please, let me...

7
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:08,725
Please!

8
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:13,047
Confess, confess!

9
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:14,389
Tell the truth.

10
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:17,398
You spilled innocent
cranberry juice everywhere.

11
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:19,445
No, no, it wasn't us.

12
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:20,502
It wasn't.

13
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:22,293
Adria did it.

14
00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:24,759
It's Adria who's going
to bed right now.

15
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,134
Aw, no, no, no, no.

16
00:01:26,262 --> 00:01:27,830
We got school in
the morning. We do?

17
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,462
Yes. Bedtime.

18
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,645
Bedtime, honey.
Hey.

19
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:31,957
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:33,589
Are you ready
for the big surprise?

21
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,429
Yeah.

22
00:01:37,782 --> 00:01:39,030
Okay.

23
00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:41,365
The horse is going to bed.
He's falling off the cliff.

24
00:01:41,494 --> 00:01:43,221
Oh, he's falling asleep!

25
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:44,887
And so are you.

26
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:46,870
Look into my eyes.

27
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:49,878
Okay?
Good night, sweetie, okay?

28
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:51,765
Night-night.
Aww.

29
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,973
My night owl's flying off again.

30
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:05,783
Are you ready?

31
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,285
I'm always ready.

32
00:02:07,414 --> 00:02:08,886
Will you be listening tonight?

33
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:11,734
Well, I think I'd rather
hear about it in the morning.

34
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:13,623
Okay, at breakfast?

35
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:16,021
Yes. Breakfast.

Good evening, Mr. Elvis.

79
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,517
Oh, hey, uh...
I'm sorry, I forgot.

80
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,821
Uh... what's your name again?

81
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:34,996
Hemwatinandan Sunderdas.

82
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:36,277
Uh, can I call you Bob?

83
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:38,261
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, how's the family?

84
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,501
Oh, they're great.
Thanks for asking, Bob.

85
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:42,036
You excited about
the show tonight?

86
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:44,406
Oh, absolutely. Look.
It's the final.

87
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:45,876
We'll finally get to find out

88
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:49,269
if the New York Newbies beat
the Manchester Magic Voices.

89
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:51,540
I'm all for Manchester!

90
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:54,580
It's my hometown.
How about you, sir?

91
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,533
Well, I was talking
about my show, Bob.

92
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,125
How do you expect to know what's
happening while I'm on the radio

93
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:00,469
if you don't even listen?

94
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:02,325
Oh...

95
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:06,229
Yep.

96
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,237
- You're in the right direction.
- Elvis.

97
00:05:09,845 --> 00:05:10,709
Hey.

98
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:15,315
Sorry, I'm late.
How are you?

99
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:16,756
I'm good, thanks.

100
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:17,877
Do I know you?

101
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:20,021
Well, that's funny.

102
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:21,493
Elvis, do you know this man?

103
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,476
Of course he knows me.
Come on, Elvis, let's go.

104
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:25,843
No, I don't know this guy.
Sir, who are you?

105
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:27,763
Hey, nobody's talkin'
to you, asshole.

106
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,140
Hey, come on, buddy, let go.

107
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:31,412
I will let go
once we get in the studio.

108
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,627
Okay, that's enough.

109
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:34,196
You got my hand, I want it back.

110
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:35,764
Man, come on!

111
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,444
Uh-oh.

112
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,357
If I say that we have
an appointment,

113
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:44,629
we have an appointment.

114
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:46,260
It has to be tonight.

115
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,404
I have to announce it tonight.

116
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:51,444
Okay, whoever you are,
this isn't gonna fly.

117
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:54,452
All right, that's the last time
you pretend not to know me.

118
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,020
Or else...
Or else what?

119
00:05:58,068 --> 00:05:59,507
Whoa, whoa! Hey.

120
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:00,597
Calm down here.

121
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:01,875
Or else I kill myself.

122
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:04,596
What is it that
you want to announce?

123
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,388
That I'm here.

124
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,725
I-I'm here. I'm...

125
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:11,059
I'm the Messiah.

126
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:14,068
I'm back.

127
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:16,244
Well, why the hell didn't you
say so in the first place?

128
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:18,932
It is you. It's him.
How you been?

129
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,268
So you do know him?

130
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:23,955
Yes. Obviously. Don't you?

131
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,739
He's... probably a Buddhist.
He's...

132
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:29,076
I'm a Hindu, actually.
Oh.

133
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:32,340
Look. We've been waiting
over 2,000 years for you.

134
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:34,132
Hey, you got
a lot of work to do.

135
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,004
You gotta make the lame walk
and the blind see.

136
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,508
You gotta save the world.

137
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:44,276
Can we go up and I can announce
that to everybody?

138
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,356
Why announce that on the radio?

139
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:50,164
I mean, you'll only reach
a handful of insomniacs.

140
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,397
Nobody listens to the radio
anymore, especially not at night.

141
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:55,572
And what's more,
they won't be able to see you.

142
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,196
And if they can't see you,
they may not believe it's you.

143
00:06:58,324 --> 00:07:03,827
For my money, you get the best
bang for your buck if you go live stream.

144
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:07,988
There's a camera
on her computer.

145
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:10,516
Who?

146
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:14,643
The woman at the center.

147
00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:16,339
What, the center
of the universe, or...?

148
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:18,836
They... They put me
at the treatment center.

149
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:22,867
But there's a camera on her
computer, and I can record myself.

150
00:07:24,372 --> 00:07:26,484
Then I can get the
message out. Yeah.

151
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:27,667
You have a great show.

152
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:31,283
What's your name again, brother?

153
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:33,139
Hemwatinandan.

154
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,892
Yeah.

155
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:41,555
I love you, Elvis!

156
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:43,443
Thank you.

157
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,963
Fuck.

158
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:50,355
Lock the door,
and don't let anyone else in.

159
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:53,843
That shouldn't have happened
in the first place.

160
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:01,203
<i>It's getting hot in here,</i>

161
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,755
<i>15 minutes before
the wonderful Elvis Cooney.</i>

162
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:10,644
<i>Enough time to listen together to
this amazing, incredible, fantastic song.</i>

163
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:12,786
<i>Oh, you're gonna love it.</i>

164
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,051
Shut up.

165
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:20,596
Elvis, hi.
Mary.

166
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:22,259
Man, did you
just roll out of bed?

167
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:25,075
You look like death warmed up.
I'm not quite warm yet.

168
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:27,827
Well, anyway, we've got
great callers tonight.

169
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,043
Cool.

170
00:08:29,171 --> 00:08:31,923
And this is
James Steel's biography.

171
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:33,843
That comedian
who does online videos.

172
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,283
He's got over
two million followers,

173
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:37,428
and we're gonna
get him on the air.

174
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:40,818
Thank you.

175
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:42,355
No problem, it's my job.

176
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:45,715
No, I mean thank you.

177
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:47,474
For my birthday.

178
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:49,843
Oh, sorry, it slipped my mind.

179
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,315
Isn't it tomorrow?

180
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:54,451
Well, tomorrow's
in about 13 minutes.

181
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:56,434
That's okay.

182
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:58,674
Everyone always forgets
my fuckin' birthday.

183
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:00,563
Happy birthday.

184
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,978
Not yet, in about
12 and a half minutes.

185
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:08,115
Who's that?

186
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:10,035
He's the newbie,
just arrived from London.

187
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:11,347
Long trip to America.

188
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:13,299
Elvis, this is Dylan.

189
00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:16,466
Dylan, this is Elvis.

190
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:18,514
Keep your transatlantic germs.
It's okay.

191
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:20,723
Okay.
You want one of these?

192
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,763
I could make you one if you'd
like. Uh, no, but thank you.

193
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:25,043
Mm-hmm.

194
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,410
I was just kidding.
This is for adults.

195
00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:28,818
I am 27.

196
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:30,226
Don't mind him.

197
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:32,306
Go to the studio.
Okay.

198
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:34,995
Oh.

199
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:36,851
I see Sam is still here.

200
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:38,674
Yeah.

201
00:09:39,731 --> 00:09:41,843
Should have brought
my rubber gloves.

202
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,282
Hey.

203
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:48,977
Don't even bother
to knock anymore.

204
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:51,026
Yeah, just like you don't
even bother to tell me

205
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:52,627
when you're coming
to watch my show.

206
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:55,731
What's to watch?
It's a radio show.

207
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:57,298
You need something?
I'm leaving in a minute.

208
00:09:57,427 --> 00:10:00,754
Oh, well, then why don't we
make this a quality minute?

209
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:03,058
When was the last time
you stayed this late?

210
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,010
Last year for the sweeps.

211
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,130
Mm-hmm.

212
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:08,531
Okay, I'll let you guys talk.

213
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:10,354
Sure.

214
00:10:11,954 --> 00:10:14,002
I'll be listening
to tonight's show in my office.

215
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,218
Oh, thanks, buddy.

216
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:18,354
Least somebody around here
gives a damn.

217
00:10:19,697 --> 00:10:21,555
Hey, since you're here.

218
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,034
I'm looking
at the quarter numbers.

219
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:28,338
Whoo! Okay.

220
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,130
You've plateaued.

221
00:10:30,258 --> 00:10:32,050
Your numbers are flat.

222
00:10:32,177 --> 00:10:34,194
Flat as a crepe.

223
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:36,467
Crepe, crepe? Oh, pancake.
Yeah, that's pretty flat.

224
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,545
But it's just one quarter,
that doesn't mean anything.

225
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:42,514
I think you have two problems.
Oh. Nobody has just two problems.

226
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:45,042
Okay, first, the audience.

227
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,090
They're not interested
in your social media.

228
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:48,497
Well, and neither am I.

229
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,025
That's why Mary
takes care of it.

230
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:52,530
Okay, blame Mary if you want.

231
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:54,258
Either way, it's a disaster.

232
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:55,923
Please, not this again.

233
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,930
I'm a radio host, not a TikTok
jock. Look at your last post.

234
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:02,130
Three months ago,
and all you said was, "Hey,"

235
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:03,890
with a big shot
of your fucking boots?

236
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:06,579
They were great,
very cool boots, size 12s.

237
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:08,114
Oh, gosh.
Okay, look.

238
00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:10,770
I'm the first to admit,
I'm not good at that stuff.

239
00:11:10,898 --> 00:11:12,529
That's not me.
Yeah, we all know that.

240
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:15,409
But today, radio
is not enough. Okay?

241
00:11:15,537 --> 00:11:17,297
Why don't you just
let me do what I do?

242
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:19,186
I mean, let's not rock the boat.

243
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:21,170
Okay, so you're not
listening to me.

244
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,921
The boat is sinking, Elvis.

245
00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:27,313
What?
You're...

246
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:29,265
different, somehow different.

247
00:11:29,393 --> 00:11:30,930
What?
Have you done...

248
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,074
You know, you're really stunningly
statuesque. Can you stop?

249
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:34,833
Stop. Nice try, though.

250
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:38,098
Second thing, I think
you're pushing too much.

251
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:40,786
Now, I've told you before,
you've got a great concept.

252
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:43,409
Okay? Telling it like it is,
take no mercy,

253
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,649
and all that is
what makes you, I get it.

254
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:46,673
Yeah.
Yeah.

255
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:47,921
But there's a push back now.

256
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,097
Push back from who?

257
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:52,817
From the Pope.
Oh, he listens?

258
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,065
<i>Wow, you should get him to call.</i>

259
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:55,697
I could tell him
how to separate...

260
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:57,233
Stop, no! Stop.

261
00:11:57,363 --> 00:12:00,017
I think you can afford now
to slow down, you know?

262
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:04,178
No, you're wrong.

263
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:05,778
Stop pushing the envelope.

264
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,497
If not, someday the big boss
is going to replace you.

265
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,802
Is that right? Who?

266
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:11,920
Is that a threat?

267
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:14,386
No, honey, it's not a threat.

268
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:17,233
It's a tip, okay,
from a very good friend.

269
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,689
Now, get out.
Have a good show tonight.

270
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:24,338
Wow. That was actually...
two quality minutes.

271
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:26,769
Just... goodbye.

272
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:35,345
Well, hey!

273
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:39,217
If it isn't "the greatest
radio host in the world."

274
00:12:39,345 --> 00:12:41,041
You know,
now that I'm not on the air,

275
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:43,793
I can tell you how
I really feel about you.

276
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:45,073
You...

277
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,386
piece of shit.

278
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:48,401
How you doing, Justin?

279
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:51,345
Your expression tells me that you're still
having trouble with those hemorrhoids.

280
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:54,321
The only pain in the ass
around here is you.

281
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,489
You will never get my show.

282
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:58,545
Do you hear me?

283
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:01,330
Listen. You will never,
ever have my show.

284
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:03,313
But I don't want your show.
Liar!

285
00:13:03,441 --> 00:13:05,297
You were just in there
with Sam asking for it.

286
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:08,145
Justin, I was not in there
to ask for your show.

287
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:10,448
Stop! Just stop lying, okay?

288
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:11,760
Justin, I don't want your show.

289
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:14,288
I'm not lying.
I don't want your show.

290
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:16,146
You don't?

291
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,098
No. I just want your slot.

292
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:20,080
It's an entirely
different thing.

293
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,161
Quite frankly,
your show plays shitty music

294
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:23,665
and you're just there
to tell the time.

295
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:26,065
They should have called it
"Justin Time." It's torture.

296
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:27,537
It's like listening
to the local radio

297
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:30,769
slap bang in the middle of
Squeal-like-a-pig Arkansas.

298
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:32,753
I'm from Arkansas.

299
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:34,544
Yeah, that's what I mean.

300
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:38,801
Fuck you, Elvis.

301
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:39,889
Thank you.

302
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:41,777
Guys. Guys.
Fuck you!

303
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,656
The snappy comebacks.
How does he do it?

304
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,248
We're live in one minute,
47 seconds.

305
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:48,208
Dickhead.

306
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:50,385
And dickhead's on top.

307
00:13:59,408 --> 00:14:00,785
Whoo-hoo.

308
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,992
<i>Elvis Live, "On the Line."</i>

309
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:18,064
It's midnight.

310
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,538
The witching hour.

311
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:23,121
Good morning to all you
night-crawling, circadian rhythm rejects,

312
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:26,609
you nocturnal emitters
that I like to call my family.

313
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:29,393
The studio's filling up,
everybody's getting settled,

314
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,888
and Mary's either manning
the phones or phoning her man.

315
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:33,296
Which is it, Mary?

316
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:35,984
You mean which man?
I get around, Elvis.

317
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:37,552
Yeah, be careful.

318
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:39,727
You get around too much,
you'll get rounder.

319
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:41,872
Hi.
We're expecting your calls.

320
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,951
Talk to Elvis live on air

321
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,800
and tell him about all
of your issues and problems,

322
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,233
<i>below or above the waist.</i>

323
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,888
Call us at 806-806-TALK.

324
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,057
806-806-8255.

325
00:14:55,184 --> 00:14:56,559
That's right.

326
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,336
And this evening, we've got
a newbie joining the show.

327
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:01,713
A rookie.

328
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:05,328
And his name is...
let's have a drumroll...

329
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:06,735
his name is...

330
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,304
What's your name again?

331
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:09,648
Dylan.

332
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,775
Dylan. Dylan replaces
our old pal, Turncoat Tom,

333
00:15:13,905 --> 00:15:16,559
who left us for a rival
station, that rat bastard.

334
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,383
You won't betray us like that,
will you, Dill?

335
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:22,223
Uh, yes. I mean, um, no.
Good evening.

336
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:23,857
Good evening, everyone.

337
00:15:23,984 --> 00:15:25,648
Oh, God, we got a shy one.

338
00:15:25,777 --> 00:15:27,376
You got stage fright?

339
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:29,104
No, not at all.

340
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:32,272
It's just that... it's a real
honor to be part of this show

341
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:33,904
that has been around
for so long.

342
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,881
I'm... so happy to be here.

343
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:40,528
"So long"? What are you
trying to say, kid?

344
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:44,688
That I'm a washed-up,
diaper-wearing has-been, is that it?

345
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:47,343
No.

346
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:49,103
I've been doing this show
for 40 years,

347
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:52,687
long enough to spot an
elder-abuse asshole when I see one.

348
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:55,087
You know, life's too short.

349
00:15:55,216 --> 00:15:57,232
Or in my case too long,
huh, Dylan?

350
00:15:57,361 --> 00:15:58,479
Huh? Hmm?

351
00:15:58,608 --> 00:15:59,887
Get lost. You're fired.

352
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:02,415
Take a plane, take a boat,
swim the Channel.

353
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:05,712
Go back to fuckin' England, or
wherever the fuck you came from.

354
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,071
Go on. Huh.

355
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:10,991
Why are you smiling?

356
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:13,295
You think I'm kidding?
He thinks I'm kidding.

357
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:15,951
Mary can produce the show.
She's done it a million times.

358
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,088
Get lost, go on.
Out, finished, over.

359
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,032
Now!
What are you waiting for?

360
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,599
Geez.

361
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:26,319
Okay, bring in the next one.

362
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:34,063
Well, that didn't
last very long, did it?

363
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:35,567
I'm kidding.

364
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:38,063
Oh, Dylan, come on back.
We love you, come on.

365
00:16:38,191 --> 00:16:39,663
I'm just joking, kid.
Come on back.

366
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,974
Get in here.

367
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:43,023
Look at him.
He looks like he's gonna cry.

368
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:46,830
Come on, kid.
It's just a joke for the newbie.

369
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,551
Sit down.
We'll have some soft foods.

370
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:51,598
Yeah, and with a Geritol
as a chaser.

371
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:53,231
There you go.
There's the spirit.

372
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,343
You just can't help yourself.
Yeah.

373
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:58,031
All right, people.

374
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,887
Here we go.

375
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:01,999
Settle in, relax.

376
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,272
Gimme a call.

377
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,638
This is "On the Line."

378
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:11,087
<i>Talk to Elvis! "On the Line"!</i>

379
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:13,551
Emma, good evening.
What's on your mind?

380
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:16,816
<i>Good evening, Elvis,
and the rest of the team.</i>

381
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:18,447
<i>Um...</i>

382
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:21,262
<i>Well, two months ago
my husband left me</i>

383
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,600
<i>after 17 years of marriage,</i>

384
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:25,712
<i>and I'm devastated.</i>

385
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:28,175
Oh, I'm sorry.
How did that happen?

386
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,927
<i>Well, he was so jealous.</i>

387
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:32,814
<i>He thought
I was cheating on him.</i>

388
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:35,119
Ah, I get it. Jealousy.

389
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:36,848
Sometimes flattering.

390
00:17:36,976 --> 00:17:40,431
Lets us know we're still desirable,
but too much, eh, not good.

391
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,246
What made him think
you were cheating on him?

392
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:45,776
<i>Actually, maybe, because...</i>

393
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:47,439
<i>I was cheating on him.</i>

394
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:50,543
Well,
that explains the jealousy.

395
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:52,847
Look, we're only human.

396
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:54,606
Seventeen years
of marriage, wow,

397
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:56,910
I guess he's, uh...
I guess he's hurt.

398
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,799
Might be tough to get him back.

399
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:02,926
Uh, you know, you guys should
talk about why you think it happened.

400
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:06,447
I'm sure it's not because he's left a
wet towel on the bed or something.

401
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:08,015
<i>Yeah.</i>

402
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:09,358
If you still love each other,

403
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,439
and, you know,
perhaps he still does,

404
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,575
um... it's worth having
another crack at it,

405
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:15,790
it's worth working.

406
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,520
I mean, you should do
whatever it takes,

407
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:19,757
whatever it takes
to fix it, okay?

408
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:21,071
Be honest, be open.

409
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,406
<i>Okay.
Right?</i>

410
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:24,847
<i>Yeah, thank you.</i>

411
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:26,639
Matt, I'm sorry
to disagree with you.

412
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:29,806
He's a great player
but a bad sport.

413
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:30,959
I never liked him.

414
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:32,654
I've got some bad news.

415
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:34,926
We were supposed to get
James Steel on the line.

416
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:36,399
Oh.
But his manager just told me

417
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:38,191
that he's tied up
shooting a video,

418
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,006
and there are some issues
that need his attention.

419
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:42,351
Fuck.

420
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:45,773
Tell him to go jump
off a fucking cliff,

421
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:48,175
with sharpened wooden stakes
on the bottom so he lands...

422
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:49,647
I hate these new Internet stars

423
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:52,334
that make three videos
in their mom's basement

424
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:55,150
and suddenly they think
they're Bouncy Knowles.

425
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,430
Beyoncé?

426
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:58,382
Well, she's bouncy to me.

427
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,877
That guy's stuck at a shoot
at 1:00 in the morning

428
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,382
when he's supposed to be
calling us?

429
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,662
I call bullshit.

430
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,358
He's probably home
playing video games,

431
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:06,893
speed bagging the pickle.

432
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:08,621
You remember this guy's name?

433
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,606
James Steel. He's a star.

434
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,814
Dylan, you know
who I'm talking about, right?

435
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,413
I'm... not sure.

436
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,790
Yes, he's an asshole,

437
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,390
and we'll never mention
his name again, okay?

438
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:19,470
Who are we talking about?
Yeah, you're learning.

439
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:21,583
Okay, we got Gary on the line.

440
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,310
What say you, Gary?

441
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:28,781
Gary, you with us?

442
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:32,782
Gary?

443
00:19:37,421 --> 00:19:39,534
Uh-oh, we got a breather.

444
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:42,414
What are you wearing, Gary?

445
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:44,527
Hey, Dylan,
you asleep at the wheel?

446
00:19:44,654 --> 00:19:47,117
Can you get Gary through to us?
He's on.

447
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:49,454
<i>I'm here.</i>

448
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,685
Ah, there he is.

449
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:55,310
How you doing, Gary?

450
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,102
<i>I'm not doing so hot, Elvis.</i>

451
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,141
What, tonsillitis,
athlete's foot?

452
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,965
Tell me more.

453
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:06,382
<i>I'm gonna do something
really screwed up tonight.</i>

454
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,590
Suicide.

455
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,559
All right, Gary, listen.

456
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:15,022
All's well. We're here for you.
We're like family.

457
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,390
Family that isn't fucked up.
You know that, right?

458
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:19,756
Now, where are you right now?

459
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,397
<i>I'm sorry, this was a bad idea.</i>

460
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,222
Gary. Shit. Mary, call him back.

461
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:29,583
Okay, well, we'll try and get
Gary back on the line very quickly

462
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:31,310
to understand
what's going on with him,

463
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,613
and in the meantime,
we'll take more calls.

464
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:38,094
<i>So, I have this central
erotic dream with my boss</i>

465
00:20:38,222 --> 00:20:39,916
<i>and I'm a little bit
confused, okay,</i>

466
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:43,853
<i>because today he told me that
he had the same dream as me.</i>

467
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:45,262
What do you do for work?

468
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,726
<i>I work for a mattress company.</i>

469
00:20:49,294 --> 00:20:51,341
He wants to test-drive the bed.

470
00:20:52,174 --> 00:20:53,838
Yeah, so when I was a kid,

471
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:55,693
I was terrified of clowns.

472
00:20:56,718 --> 00:21:01,005
You know, so when I grew up,
I decided to face my fears.

473
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,716
And one day,
I slept with a female clown.

474
00:21:04,845 --> 00:21:07,118
Red hair. Big shoes.

475
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:09,198
Wouldn't take her nose off.
It was weird.

476
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:10,605
Hmm.

477
00:21:11,597 --> 00:21:14,061
I woke up the next morning
alone, and, uh,

478
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:17,038
she'd twisted my penis
into a poodle.

479
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:19,821
Whoa!

480
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,078
We gotta fix this problem.

481
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:28,429
I mean, how can 11 laptops magically
disappear in the space of three months?

482
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:30,669
We're in a radio station,
cameras everywhere.

483
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:32,398
This is dick in' rifuckulous.

484
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,373
Probably just some dude
trying to build his collection.

485
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,229
Or collect what he can
from the building.

486
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:39,244
It's kind of hard to describe.

487
00:21:40,493 --> 00:21:43,662
Somewhere between a bald eagle
and a spotted owl.

488
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:46,317
Who hasn't tried
a little endangered species?

489
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:49,932
<i>Elvis is on KLAT-FM Los Angeles.</i>

490
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:52,333
<i>Live "On the Line."</i>

491
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:56,908
Okay, good news.
Gary's back on the air.

492
00:21:57,037 --> 00:21:59,053
We were worried about you, pal.
How you feelin'?

493
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,813
<i>I'm better.</i>

494
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:02,348
All right.

495
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:04,365
Um, where are you?

496
00:22:04,493 --> 00:22:06,124
<i>I'm... I'm in Pasadena.</i>

497
00:22:06,253 --> 00:22:08,781
Cool. Pasadena. You alone?

498
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:11,117
<i>Look, I'm just gonna
do what needs to be done.</i>

499
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:12,366
<i>It's better that way.</i>

500
00:22:12,493 --> 00:22:14,157
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Gary, hold on.

501
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:15,819
Gimme a minute. Let's talk.

502
00:22:15,949 --> 00:22:17,549
I love Pasadena.

503
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:19,789
Where exactly are you?

504
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:23,948
Gary, you there?

505
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:26,668
<i>I'm in a garden.</i>

506
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:29,101
Okay, in a garden.

507
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:32,748
Is it, uh... your garden?
Are you at home?

508
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:34,764
<i>No.</i>

509
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:36,269
No. Uh...

510
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,764
Does the home belong
to someone you know?

511
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:40,748
<i>No.</i>

512
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:42,988
<i>It belongs to a piece of shit.</i>

513
00:22:43,117 --> 00:22:44,237
<i>I'm gonna destroy him.</i>

514
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:45,612
Call the police.

515
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,492
Gary, tell me, is it the home
of a family member,

516
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,997
a neighbor, a colleague, a...

517
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,500
<i>I told you...
...ex-lover?</i>

518
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:53,357
<i>...it's a worthless
piece of shit's place.</i>

519
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:54,701
<i>Right.
And I'm...</i>

520
00:22:54,828 --> 00:22:56,780
<i>I'm gonna take out
his whole family.</i>

521
00:22:58,445 --> 00:22:59,820
Gary, come on.

522
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:01,773
<i>Why hurt his family If he's
a worthless piece of shit?</i>

523
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:03,468
I mean, they're innocent.

524
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:06,061
Don't let your instinct for
revenge drive you to do something

525
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:09,388
that you'll probably be
paying for the rest of your life.

526
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:12,395
You're better than that, Gary.

527
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:16,492
Tell me calmly, what's this guy
done to you to make you so upset?

528
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:18,732
Some injustice,
some hurt, some...?

529
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,933
<i>He destroyed my life,
and I'm gonna destroy his.</i>

530
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:24,300
<i>Ay, ay, ay, an eye for an eye.</i>

531
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:28,140
Gary, you're playing a game
called "You Lose," all right?

532
00:23:28,268 --> 00:23:31,437
Now, whoever he is,
he didn't destroy your life.

533
00:23:31,563 --> 00:23:33,357
Don't give him that power.

534
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:34,700
You know?

535
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:36,300
People come
on this show every day

536
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:37,901
that feel desperate,
hopeless, worthless,

537
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:40,588
usually because somebody else
made them feel that way, okay?

538
00:23:40,717 --> 00:23:44,012
Do not adopt that perception
of yourself, all right?

539
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:48,172
You got the power to change,
you got the tools inbuilt.

540
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,860
You gotta believe that, Gary.
You can do it.

541
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:54,412
Gary, what was that?

542
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,716
<i>I'm breaking into
the son of a bitch's house!</i>

543
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:58,380
Gary, stop, wait, listen.

544
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:01,356
If you want, we can chat
about this offline.

545
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:03,148
I mean, we can, you know...
Cool?

546
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:06,028
<i>No. I wanna stay on the air.
I'll put on a record, I swear.</i>

547
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:08,652
<i>I want everyone to hear
what's going down.</i>

548
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,468
I can't keep you on the air.
I'm sorry.

549
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:13,772
Let's chat offline. I promise
you, together we can fix it.

550
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,564
<i>No!
Do not cut me off the air,</i>

551
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:18,027
<i>or I'll go upstairs
and I'll kill everybody.</i>

552
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:19,916
You're not gonna kill anyone.

553
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:22,764
All right?
Everything's gonna be fine.

554
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:24,684
You're still live on air,

555
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:26,412
but I don't want you
to be in danger

556
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,556
or put anyone else
in danger, okay?

557
00:24:29,707 --> 00:24:33,388
Now, what part
of Pasadena are you in?

558
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:35,692
<i>Near Arlington Gardens.</i>

559
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:38,540
Ah. Well, yeah, nice area.

560
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:41,675
<i>Yeah, it's a neighborhood
you know all too well</i>

561
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:44,523
<i>'cause I'm at your house.</i>

562
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:48,268
<i>976 Orange Grove Boulevard.</i>

563
00:24:48,396 --> 00:24:51,340
<i>It's crazy
what a nice house you can buy</i>

564
00:24:51,468 --> 00:24:53,996
<i>when you host a shitty show
like yours!</i>

565
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:56,683
Gary, I don't know if this
is some kind of joke.

566
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:58,955
I mean, I got nothing
to hide from my listeners.

567
00:24:59,084 --> 00:25:01,420
Yes, that is my address.

568
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:04,908
But I think you're gonna have a
little trouble getting across the garden.

569
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:07,307
<i>Oh, you're talking about
the two mangy Dobermans?</i>

570
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:09,515
<i>Listen, buddy...</i>

571
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:13,387
<i>This afternoon, I threw them a
couple pieces of meat with rat poison.</i>

572
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:15,435
<i>I thought I might have to
fight them off a little bit tonight,</i>

573
00:25:15,564 --> 00:25:18,539
<i>but what do you know, when I got
here they were just lying on the ground.</i>

574
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:21,164
<i>I was, uh, kind enough
to relieve their suffering</i>

575
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,020
<i>with a butcher's knife.</i>

576
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:32,844
- Call 911.
- Yeah.

577
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:37,548
If that's true,
and you're really at my house,

578
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:39,468
we'll continue
this conversation offline.

579
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:41,355
Off the air. The police
will be there in a minute...

580
00:25:41,484 --> 00:25:45,195
<i>I don't give a fuck about the
cops, and you better not cut me off.</i>

581
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:46,636
<i>Gary. Hold on a second.
Don't cut me off!</i>

582
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:48,075
<i>Don't you dare!
Dylan, music, music.</i>

583
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:49,547
Dylan, wake up!
Put on a fucking song!

584
00:25:49,676 --> 00:25:51,403
<i>Don't cut me off!
I have no choice, Gary.</i>

585
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:53,643
<i>- We can't let you...
- Daddy!</i>

586
00:25:56,235 --> 00:25:57,675
Adria?

587
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:02,764
<i>I should have given her
rat poison, too,</i>

588
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:05,707
<i>but I wanted her
to be part of the fun.</i>

589
00:26:05,835 --> 00:26:07,403
Listen, it's over.

590
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:10,123
The police will be there in a
minute. Leave my daughter alone.

591
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,259
It's not too late. I won't
press charges, I promise.

592
00:26:13,387 --> 00:26:14,762
I just want you
to get some help.

593
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,914
The police are on their way.

594
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:17,675
<i>Tell the cops to stay outside.</i>

595
00:26:17,803 --> 00:26:19,915
<i>We don't need them for the show.</i>

596
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:22,571
There is no show, Gary.

597
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:25,451
The reality is, the police will
take you out if you don't comply.

598
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:28,267
Now, I won't press charges. I
just want you to leave my fam...

599
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,602
Gary, what was that? What the
fuck's happening? Holy shit, what...

600
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:35,626
<i>Honey...</i>

601
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:37,291
Oh... Olivia?

602
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,307
<i>Elvis.
Baby, you all right?</i>

603
00:26:39,435 --> 00:26:41,770
<i>Do as he says, please,
I'm begging you.</i>

604
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:44,779
<i>He just fired shots
into the fucking wall!</i>

605
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:48,554
<i>Yeah, you'll have to touch
up the paint a little bit, sorry.</i>

606
00:26:48,683 --> 00:26:50,188
<i>That was just to shut your trap.</i>

607
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:52,842
<i>Next time, I'm gonna aim for
your daughter and your wife.</i>

608
00:26:52,971 --> 00:26:55,179
The police are there.
They're waiting for backup.

609
00:26:55,307 --> 00:26:56,554
Try to buy some time.
Okay.

610
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:57,546
Yep.

611
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:01,963
Gary, I'm listening. Okay?

612
00:27:02,794 --> 00:27:04,330
Tell me what's going on?

613
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:06,890
Tell me what
you're pissed about.

614
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:09,514
I mean, clearly,
I don't know you, but...

615
00:27:09,643 --> 00:27:13,164
you're obviously very angry
with me and I need to know why.

616
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,659
I mean,
maybe we can settle this.

617
00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:18,092
Did I give you some bad advice?

618
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:20,202
Did I give bad advice
to someone you know?

619
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,314
You blame me for something?
I mean, what is it about?

620
00:27:22,443 --> 00:27:24,874
Is it about a girl?
Did I tell her to leave you?

621
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:26,442
Something to do with your job?

622
00:27:26,571 --> 00:27:29,642
Listen, you got the air
all to yourself, okay?

623
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:30,986
So just off-load,

624
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:33,578
'cause I gotta know
why it is you hate me.

625
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:36,843
<i>Ahh, Elvis.</i>

626
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:38,730
<i>You know, I'm embarrassed
to talk about this</i>

627
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,811
<i>in front of your wife
and your daughter,</i>

628
00:27:40,938 --> 00:27:44,330
<i>but since you insist, it might
have something to do with the fact</i>

629
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:48,234
<i>that you're sleeping with your
fucking switchboard operator.</i>

630
00:27:50,571 --> 00:27:53,162
Gary, have you been drinking
or are you on some kind of drugs?

631
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,859
'Cause I... I don't know you.

632
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:56,587
You don't know me,
Mary doesn't know...

633
00:27:56,714 --> 00:27:58,474
You know this guy?

634
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,386
Who are you, Gary?

635
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,427
Are you a fan of the show just
trying to create some kind of buzz,

636
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:06,410
some sort of prank?

637
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:07,978
Well, congratulations.
It's working.

638
00:28:08,106 --> 00:28:09,579
You got me, okay?

639
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:12,042
I'm scared to fucking death,
man, honestly.

640
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,676
Now, look,
you've had your laughs...

641
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,849
<i>Stop fucking around, shit brain.</i>

642
00:28:15,978 --> 00:28:17,322
<i>You think I actually
listen to your show</i>

643
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:19,594
<i>for insomniac freaks
who call up...</i>

644
00:28:19,722 --> 00:28:21,962
<i>Okay.
...for your shitty advice?</i>

645
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,299
Calm down, now.
What do you want?

646
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:26,987
Nobody wants anybody
to get hurt, okay?

647
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:30,027
<i>Don't talk to me like I'm
one of your airhead listeners.</i>

648
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:33,450
<i>I wanna ruin your life,
just like you ruined mine.</i>

649
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:35,594
Gary, is it money?

650
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:37,002
Is that what it is?

651
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,539
It's all about money?
You need money?

652
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,491
<i>Money?</i>

653
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:41,994
<i>Seriously, if I wanted money,</i>

654
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:45,323
<i>I'd just help myself
to your yuppie suburban palace.</i>

655
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:46,889
<i>Oh, uh, wait a second.</i>

656
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:48,970
<i>I think your wife
wants to talk to you.</i>

657
00:28:49,098 --> 00:28:52,043
<i>How did we
get into this mess, Elvis?</i>

658
00:28:52,171 --> 00:28:53,482
<i>What the hell did you do?</i>

659
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:55,401
<i>I'm gonna put you
on speakerphone</i>

660
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:57,322
<i>'cause I wanna hear
how the greatest bigmouth</i>

661
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:59,114
<i>in the world of radio
handles this.</i>

662
00:28:59,242 --> 00:29:03,210
<i>Careful, though: if you lie,
boom, I will shoot somebody.</i>

663
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:10,218
<i>Oh, no, Elvis, you do not
have the right to remain silent.</i>

664
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:12,010
<i>We're all listening.</i>

665
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:15,881
<i>Your affair with Mary:
true or false?</i>

666
00:29:21,738 --> 00:29:25,002
Gary, I don't know
what makes you think

667
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,409
that there's a relationship
with Mary,

668
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:28,329
because I swear to God,
I never...

669
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,882
<i>- Bullshit!
- Stop fucking around, Elvis!</i>

670
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,290
<i>I swore that
I would shoot someone.</i>

671
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:36,170
<i>Olivia, can you confirm
that I shot someone?</i>

672
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:39,273
<i>Elvis.</i>

673
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:41,898
<i>I shot at your ugly face</i>

674
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:44,393
<i>on that narcissistic poster
hanging on the wall.</i>

675
00:29:44,522 --> 00:29:45,771
<i>The next time...
Good one, Gary.</i>

676
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:47,048
<i>...next time...</i>

677
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:48,651
<i>Leave her alone!</i>

678
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:51,081
<i>Please, I'm begging you!
I'm begging you, please!</i>

679
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:52,937
<i>Don't hurt her!
Gary? Gary.</i>

680
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:54,889
I want you to take a minute...

681
00:29:55,017 --> 00:29:57,834
<i>Listen.
I want you to hear this.</i>

682
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:05,897
<i>That's my gun pressed
against your daughter's temple.</i>

683
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:08,778
<i>So, how about you tell us
the fucking truth?</i>

684
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:12,618
<i>Are you screwing
the switchboard operator?</i>

685
00:30:12,747 --> 00:30:13,738
<i>Yes or no?</i>

686
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,258
Yes. Yes, okay.

687
00:30:25,385 --> 00:30:26,986
There you go, yes, I did it.

688
00:30:27,114 --> 00:30:29,513
You're right, I did it.
I screwed her. You happy now?

689
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:33,001
You win. Now, let her go.
Please.

690
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:35,081
<i>Thank you.</i>

691
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:37,928
<i>That wasn't so hard, was it?</i>

692
00:30:39,144 --> 00:30:41,064
You wanted me to confess, I did.

693
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:43,466
Now, what more
do you want me to do, huh?

694
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,162
Let's get this over with.

695
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,370
You're angry at me,
not them, all right?

696
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:49,545
Me. Let them go,

697
00:30:49,672 --> 00:30:51,818
and we can settle this
between the two of us, all right?

698
00:30:51,946 --> 00:30:54,408
<i>Ah, so now you have time
to listen to me.</i>

699
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:57,257
The police want to talk to him.
No, no, that's okay.

700
00:30:57,384 --> 00:31:01,449
Gary, this can still
end well, okay?

701
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,937
<i>But I don't want it to end well.</i>

702
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:07,688
<i>It didn't end well for Lauren.</i>

703
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:09,194
For who? Who?

704
00:31:09,321 --> 00:31:11,784
<i>And you have the balls
to ask me who.</i>

705
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,737
<i>Don't you know a Lauren?</i>

706
00:31:14,697 --> 00:31:17,352
First it's Mary, now you're
talking about some Lauren.

707
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:18,729
I know a dozen Laurens.

708
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:21,128
<i>Oh, I bet you know
about a dozen Laurens.</i>

709
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,176
<i>But to me there's only one.</i>

710
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:27,848
Gary, you're gonna
have to help me here, I...

711
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:29,865
They want to
take over the negotiation.

712
00:31:29,993 --> 00:31:32,074
They want you to hang up.
It's okay, Steven.

713
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:34,728
Please, let my wife
and daughter go,

714
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:37,096
and then we can talk about,
like, whatever you want.

715
00:31:37,225 --> 00:31:39,721
Okay? We'll sit here
and we'll work this out.

716
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,240
<i>I'm sorry, that's not
the ending I had in mind.</i>

717
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:46,697
<i>Wonder.</i>

718
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,720
What? W-Wonder what?

719
00:31:51,848 --> 00:31:53,897
<i>Wonder, Lauren Wonder!</i>

720
00:31:54,023 --> 00:31:55,943
<i>That's her name!</i>

721
00:31:56,073 --> 00:31:58,857
<i>And she's also the eighth
wonder of the world.</i>

722
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:02,472
<i>But I bet you didn't even know
her last name, did you?</i>

723
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:06,698
Before me. Before me.

724
00:32:07,528 --> 00:32:08,360
Oh.

725
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:10,889
Oh, the switchboard operator.
Lily.

726
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:13,288
Her real name was Lauren.
We called her Lily.

727
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:14,730
I didn't know her last name.

728
00:32:14,855 --> 00:32:16,329
<i>There you go.</i>

729
00:32:16,457 --> 00:32:19,497
<i>It's funny how
it all comes rushing back.</i>

730
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,672
Yeah. She worked for us
a couple months.

731
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,720
Uh, two years back.
She disappeared one day.

732
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:25,801
We never saw her again.
I didn't know her last name.

733
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:28,392
<i>That didn't stop you from
making stupid jokes about her</i>

734
00:32:28,521 --> 00:32:30,344
<i>every day on the show!</i>

735
00:32:30,472 --> 00:32:32,264
<i>About her face, her voice.</i>

736
00:32:32,392 --> 00:32:33,640
<i>She didn't dare speak up</i>

737
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:36,362
<i>because Mr. Big Wig
is the star of radio.</i>

738
00:32:36,489 --> 00:32:38,377
<i>She thought that,
by leaving after five months,</i>

739
00:32:38,505 --> 00:32:40,744
<i>she'd be able to forget, but no!</i>

740
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:43,273
<i>Because people never stopped
talking about it to her.</i>

741
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:45,001
<i>I've been with her
since high school.</i>

742
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,664
<i>And yes, she had other problems,</i>

743
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:49,833
<i>but you, you were
the fucking cherry on top!</i>

744
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,447
<i>It was always like
a pressure cooker, and boom!</i>

745
00:32:53,993 --> 00:32:56,104
Boom what? It's shock radio.

746
00:32:56,232 --> 00:32:58,537
We fuck around. That's what
we do. We make jokes, okay?

747
00:32:58,664 --> 00:33:02,344
<i>It's not for you to decide
what's funny and what's not!</i>

748
00:33:02,472 --> 00:33:05,544
<i>See, being at your fuckin' house
with Olivia and your daughter,</i>

749
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:07,273
<i>now that's funny, oh, yeah.</i>

750
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,615
Yeah, okay, all right.

751
00:33:08,744 --> 00:33:11,176
Look, I'll do anything
to help Lily... Lauren.

752
00:33:11,304 --> 00:33:12,519
I'll make it up to her.

753
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:14,663
<i>There is something you can do.</i>

754
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,327
<i>You can take your wireless mic</i>

755
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:18,343
<i>and go up
to the studio's terrace</i>

756
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:20,552
<i>with someone
from your shitty team.</i>

757
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,472
I... I don't get it.

758
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,488
<i>You'll get it
when you're up there.</i>

759
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:26,791
<i>Now, move your ass!
Okay, okay, calm down.</i>

760
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,967
Mary, get a mic
and a headphone ready.

761
00:33:29,097 --> 00:33:30,599
Okay?

762
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,607
We're coming with you.

763
00:33:37,737 --> 00:33:38,920
Okay.

764
00:33:41,351 --> 00:33:42,536
Let's go.

765
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:55,336
Okay, I'm here.

766
00:33:55,464 --> 00:33:57,927
<i>Cool. Breathe.</i>

767
00:33:58,056 --> 00:33:59,495
Okay, just tell me what you want

768
00:33:59,624 --> 00:34:00,968
so we can get this
over with, huh?

769
00:34:01,095 --> 00:34:03,399
<i>You see that ashtray
by the wall?</i>

770
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:07,657
How do you know there's
an ashtray by the wall, Gary?

771
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:11,401
<i>That's where Lauren came to cry
after you humiliated her.</i>

772
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:13,959
She tell you that?

773
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:15,624
<i>No, I was there.</i>

774
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,966
Okay.

775
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:20,040
<i>I was having a smoke
when she showed up in tears.</i>

776
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:22,152
How'd you even
get in the building?

777
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,903
<i>I worked there for my job.</i>

778
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:28,680
<i>Oh, Elvis, we met so many
times, and you never said hello.</i>

779
00:34:28,808 --> 00:34:30,984
<i>But hey, you treat
your own colleagues like dirt.</i>

780
00:34:31,143 --> 00:34:33,990
<i>It's no surprise you never
gave me the time of day.</i>

781
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:35,239
Who are you?

782
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:37,127
<i>Does it really matter?</i>

783
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:42,598
Are you Gary Harlowe?

784
00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:44,614
<i>Not anymore.</i>

785
00:34:44,743 --> 00:34:46,056
What does that mean?

786
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,008
<i>It means tonight
I don't give a fuck.</i>

787
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:51,176
<i>I'm not that friendly
security guard anymore</i>

788
00:34:51,303 --> 00:34:53,128
<i>who always greeted you
with a smile.</i>

789
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:57,126
Man, look, I am really sorry.
I just don't remember, okay?

790
00:34:57,255 --> 00:35:00,264
<i>Anyway, what I want you
to do now</i>

791
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:03,080
<i>is to climb up onto that wall.</i>

792
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,128
<i>I set up a little staircase
for you.</i>

793
00:35:06,983 --> 00:35:08,040
You can't be serious.

794
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:09,800
<i>Does it sound like I'm joking?</i>

795
00:35:09,927 --> 00:35:12,999
<i>Hey, Adria, does it look
like I'm fooling around?</i>

796
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:15,302
<i>Do I make you laugh, kid?</i>

797
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,583
<i>Elvis!</i>

798
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:18,855
<i>Relax. Everything's fine.</i>

799
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:22,567
<i>Elvis is gonna get up
onto that fucking wall.</i>

800
00:35:41,575 --> 00:35:42,567
Fuck!

801
00:35:50,503 --> 00:35:53,255
I'm on the wall.
You happy? What now?

802
00:35:53,383 --> 00:35:54,823
<i>Thank you.</i>

803
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,710
Gary, I don't like heights.

804
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,502
You can tell Lauren
I'm shit scared

805
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,486
if you think it makes you
feel any better, okay?

806
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:02,342
<i>Well, that won't be easy,</i>

807
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,190
<i>because she's dead.</i>

808
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:08,647
<i>She committed suicide
a month ago.</i>

809
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:11,142
<i>You should see what she
writes about you in her letter.</i>

810
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:13,095
<i>It's not very nice.</i>

811
00:36:13,223 --> 00:36:15,592
<i>She jumped
from her apartment balcony.</i>

812
00:36:15,718 --> 00:36:17,127
<i>Five stories.</i>

813
00:36:18,215 --> 00:36:20,871
Gary, I'm sorry.
Man, I'm really sorry.

814
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:22,279
I've learned my lesson.

815
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:24,967
Can we please stop
this nonsense?

816
00:36:25,094 --> 00:36:26,918
<i>When I came back
from Afghanistan,</i>

817
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:28,455
<i>I tried to kill myself too.</i>

818
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:31,109
<i>A pussy like you
wouldn't last a day over there.</i>

819
00:36:31,238 --> 00:36:33,511
<i>They said I was
psychologically damaged.</i>

820
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:35,400
<i>Bullshit.
Gary, life is beautiful.</i>

821
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,543
<i>No, it's not!</i>

822
00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:39,943
<i>Now, I want you to jump.</i>

823
00:36:47,525 --> 00:36:50,534
Come on, Gary, nobody would
do that. I'm not gonna jump.

824
00:36:50,662 --> 00:36:52,358
<i>If you don't jump,
I'll kill them.</i>

825
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:53,991
<i>You know I will!</i>

826
00:36:54,118 --> 00:36:55,782
<i>It's you or them!</i>

827
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:58,118
Oh, for fuck sake, Gary,
can't we sort this out?

828
00:36:58,247 --> 00:36:59,558
Come on,
I'm begging you, please.

829
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,159
<i>Jump!</i>

830
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,183
I can't.

831
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:09,926
<i>I knew it.</i>

832
00:37:10,055 --> 00:37:11,366
<i>I knew it.</i>

833
00:37:11,493 --> 00:37:13,510
<i>I knew you'd shit your pants.</i>

834
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,719
<i>Not even a shred of dignity.</i>

835
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:18,406
<i>That's why I didn't want you
to go alone.</i>

836
00:37:18,854 --> 00:37:22,022
<i>Dylan, push him.</i>

837
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:23,495
No.

838
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:25,478
<i>Push him,
or a five-year-old dies.</i>

839
00:37:25,606 --> 00:37:27,141
Gary, you sick fuck!

840
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:30,278
I hope you die and burn forever!

841
00:37:30,406 --> 00:37:31,879
<i>Last chance, Dylan.</i>

842
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,630
<i>Push him!
No.</i>

843
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:36,262
It's okay, it's okay.

844
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:38,534
Gary, I'll jump.

845
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:40,358
Put my wife on.

846
00:37:40,486 --> 00:37:42,181
What are you doing?

847
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:46,374
I'm so sorry, my dear.

848
00:37:47,495 --> 00:37:48,838
I love you.

849
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:50,885
Take care of Adria.

850
00:37:51,014 --> 00:37:53,126
Okay?

851
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:54,278
I have no choice.

852
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,070
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

853
00:37:56,198 --> 00:37:58,342
<i>Please, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you, please.</i>

854
00:37:58,469 --> 00:37:59,654
<i>Please!</i>

855
00:38:04,486 --> 00:38:05,735
Don't, Elvis, no!

856
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:25,478
<i>Tell me, Dylan,
did that asshole jump?</i>

857
00:38:25,861 --> 00:38:26,790
Yes.

858
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:31,654
<i>Thank you, Dylan.</i>

859
00:38:31,781 --> 00:38:35,014
<i>Hey, listen, I'm sorry
I put you in that situation.</i>

860
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:37,190
<i>I did you a favor, though. That
guy would have tortured you,</i>

861
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:38,534
<i>just like he did to Lauren.</i>

862
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:40,550
<i>He was a real
son of a bitch, you know.</i>

863
00:38:40,676 --> 00:38:41,958
You can free his wife
and daughter

864
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,487
because he jumped, he's dead.

865
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,765
Just let them go.

866
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:48,805
<i>Of course.
I'm a man of my word.</i>

867
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:51,654
<i>I just...</i>

868
00:38:51,781 --> 00:38:54,598
<i>I just need proof
that he really jumped.</i>

869
00:38:55,558 --> 00:38:57,061
<i>I mean, you wouldn't
lie to me, right?</i>

870
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,590
I'm telling you, he jumped.
Just let them go.

871
00:39:22,022 --> 00:39:24,325
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

872
00:39:24,454 --> 00:39:27,525
<i>You filthy liars!
You're all motherfuckers!</i>

873
00:39:28,517 --> 00:39:30,277
<i>Dylan, you've really
disappointed me.</i>

874
00:39:30,405 --> 00:39:33,221
No, wait, don't get angry.
I can explain, okay?

875
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:36,997
<i>I wanted to film Elvis's jump
and post it online.</i>

876
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,045
<i>You've really
made a fool out of me.</i>

877
00:39:39,173 --> 00:39:40,614
Hey, hey, Gary,
this is my fault.

878
00:39:40,741 --> 00:39:42,469
<i>I apologize, okay?
It's too late!</i>

879
00:39:42,598 --> 00:39:44,710
<i>I'm sorry.
An eye for an eye, Elvis.</i>

880
00:39:44,837 --> 00:39:49,285
<i>Gary... Now you can see what
it's like to lose someone you love.</i>

881
00:39:49,413 --> 00:39:51,557
The police is ready to go.
They're headed in!

882
00:39:51,686 --> 00:39:53,060
Gary, the cops
are coming in right now.

883
00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:55,940
I'm begging you, please!
Give it up! Stop it!

884
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,981
Wait.

885
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:02,149
The police want
to get you on the phone.

886
00:41:05,668 --> 00:41:07,013
Yeah?

887
00:41:10,373 --> 00:41:11,717
What?

888
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,660
Uh...

889
00:41:19,941 --> 00:41:21,604
That can't be.

890
00:41:27,973 --> 00:41:30,020
Go with him.
I'll lock up the studio.

891
00:41:58,244 --> 00:41:59,268
It's impossible.

892
00:41:59,428 --> 00:42:01,028
What's going on?

893
00:42:02,468 --> 00:42:04,196
The cops say...

894
00:42:05,604 --> 00:42:07,684
- there's no one home.
- What?

895
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:11,043
They checked every room.

896
00:42:11,172 --> 00:42:12,580
No signs of forced entry.

897
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,340
The dogs are alive.

898
00:42:14,851 --> 00:42:15,876
I don't get it.

899
00:42:16,003 --> 00:42:18,372
And your daughter,
your... your wife?

900
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:19,556
Not there.

901
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:21,381
I don't know.

902
00:42:21,508 --> 00:42:23,460
They looked everywhere.
Nothing.

903
00:42:25,124 --> 00:42:26,372

<i>Now, that is devotion.</i>

924
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:17,347
<i>I caught them
just as you left home.</i>

925
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:21,730
<i>By the way, Olivia and Adria
did not want to get into my car.</i>

926
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:23,107
<i>It was a struggle.</i>

927
00:44:23,236 --> 00:44:25,156
<i>Kind of like rassling
a couple of piglets.</i>

<i>They fought, they squealed.</i>

Am I all alone on the air?</i>

935
00:44:46,211 --> 00:44:49,252
<i>Wow, this is like
a childhood fantasy come true.</i>

936
00:44:49,379 --> 00:44:51,843
<i>But hey, Elvis, I do hope you
can still hear me out there</i>

937
00:44:51,971 --> 00:44:54,179
<i>'cause tonight,
as a tribute to Lauren,</i>

938
00:44:54,307 --> 00:44:56,804
<i>I've gone out of my way
to make sure you spend</i>

939
00:44:56,931 --> 00:44:59,363
<i>the worst night of your life.</i>

940
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:01,123
<i>See, I've created a game,</i>

941
00:45:01,251 --> 00:45:02,786
<i>and I think you're
gonna love it.</i>

942
00:45:02,915 --> 00:45:04,067
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

943
00:45:04,195 --> 00:45:07,811
<i>If you lose,
I kill these two little ladies.</i>

944
00:45:10,722 --> 00:45:13,060
Use your cell.
Let's call the cops.

945
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:16,354
<i>Elvis. I'm gonna count
down from 30.</i>

946
00:45:16,482 --> 00:45:19,011
<i>If you don't answer,
that means you've gone,</i>

947
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:21,314
<i>and that I'm talking
to myself like a madman.</i>

948
00:45:21,442 --> 00:45:23,266
<i>I'm not crazy, you know?</i>

949
00:45:23,395 --> 00:45:26,595
<i>So listen, if you don't
get back on the line,</i>

950
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,684
<i>the game is over,</i>

951
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,154
<i>and if the game is over,</i>

952
00:45:29,282 --> 00:45:31,043
<i>boom, boom.</i>

953
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,730
<i>Thirty, 29...</i>

954
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:36,963
Gary, it's Mary.

955
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,755
Elvis has left the building...

956
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:41,795
<i>No one called you, Miss
America. I'm playing with Elvis.</i>

957
00:45:41,924 --> 00:45:44,194
<i>I don't talk to women
who sleep with married men.</i>

958
00:45:44,322 --> 00:45:46,724
<i>Either Elvis
is there or he's not.</i>

959
00:45:46,851 --> 00:45:48,226
<i>Anyway, where was I?</i>

960
00:45:48,866 --> 00:45:51,779
<i>Twenty-eight, 27...</i>

961
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:55,842
<i>26, 25...</i>

962
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:59,107
<i>24, 23...</i>

963
00:46:00,067 --> 00:46:03,362
<i>22, 21...</i>

964
00:46:04,003 --> 00:46:07,522
<i>20, 19...</i>

965
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:10,819
<i>18, 17...</i>

966
00:46:10,945 --> 00:46:14,659
<i>16, 15...</i>

967
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:17,057
<i>14, 13...</i>

968
00:46:17,186 --> 00:46:19,682
<i>Elvis, the...
12, 11...</i>

969
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,921
<i>...mic is in the elevator.
Ten...</i>

970
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,937
<i>nine, eight...</i>

971
00:46:24,994 --> 00:46:27,618
<i>seven, six...</i>

972
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:31,074
<i>five, four...</i>

973
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:32,354
<i>three...</i>

974
00:46:32,482 --> 00:46:34,466
<i>two...</i>

975
00:46:34,594 --> 00:46:36,194
<i>one...</i>

976
00:46:36,322 --> 00:46:37,634
<i>Zero!</i>

977
00:46:37,763 --> 00:46:39,459
I'm here! I'm here!

978
00:46:39,587 --> 00:46:42,307
<i>Ah! Okay, Elvis.</i>

979
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:44,609
<i>And he's back!</i>

980
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,505
<i>Were you taking a dump?</i>

981
00:46:50,243 --> 00:46:52,577
<i>So, where are you, my friend?</i>

982
00:46:52,706 --> 00:46:53,697
In reception.

983
00:46:53,827 --> 00:46:54,722
<i>Oh, in reception.</i>

984
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,194
<i>Ha!</i>

985
00:46:57,602 --> 00:47:00,355
<i>Sorry I didn't have time
to clean up the entrance.</i>

986
00:47:00,482 --> 00:47:02,018
Yeah, did you have to kill him?

987
00:47:02,146 --> 00:47:04,578
<i>Yes, I did.
That guard was very impolite.</i>

988
00:47:04,705 --> 00:47:05,986
<i>Not friendly at all.</i>

989
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,259
<i>I told him I used to work
the same job.</i>

990
00:47:08,386 --> 00:47:10,147
<i>He didn't want to open
the door at first,</i>

991
00:47:10,274 --> 00:47:12,801
<i>but thank God he recognized
your wife, so he let us in.</i>

992
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:14,369
<i>Didn't seem to like
my face, though.</i>

993
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,939
<i>He didn't want
to give me a badge.</i>

994
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:17,634
<i>What a jerk.</i>

995
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:19,970
So now it's your turn.
Where are you?

996
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:21,602
<i>I'll let you in on a secret.</i>

997
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:23,938
<i>I'm still at your home,
in a way.</i>

998
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:25,921
<i>I wasn't exactly
lying to you earlier.</i>

999
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,201
<i>I'm at your home.</i>

1000
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:30,370
<i>This is your second home,
after all.</i>

1001
00:47:30,498 --> 00:47:33,249
<i>We're gonna have some fun.</i>

1002
00:47:33,378 --> 00:47:36,609
<i>Dear listeners, you're about
to hear the last 40 minutes</i>

1003
00:47:36,737 --> 00:47:38,914
<i>in the history of Elvis's show.</i>

1004
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:41,762
<i>In 40 minutes, that's 4-0...</i>

1005
00:47:42,113 --> 00:47:43,778
<i>boom!</i>

1006
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:51,394
You're gonna blow up the door.
Why?

1007
00:47:51,522 --> 00:47:53,474
<i>The door?</i>

1008
00:47:53,603 --> 00:47:56,162
<i>No. I respect your show, Elvis.</i>

1009
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,721
<i>It deserves some sparkle.</i>

1010
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:01,026
<i>You should check
your social media.</i>

1011
00:48:01,569 --> 00:48:03,233
<i>Man, I'm excited.</i>

1012
00:48:03,361 --> 00:48:06,209
<i>In the army, I was an explosive
ordnance disposal specialist.</i>

1013
00:48:06,337 --> 00:48:08,993
<i>I miss fireworks.</i>

1014
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,241
He's gonna blow everything up.

1015
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:16,993
Windows, the door,
the basement, the garage.

1016
00:48:17,121 --> 00:48:18,849
Everything is wired to blow.

1017
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:21,954
<i>If only Lauren could see this.</i>

1018
00:48:22,082 --> 00:48:23,809
<i>On the other hand,
she'd probably tell me</i>

1019
00:48:23,937 --> 00:48:25,505
<i>just to blow it all up
right away.</i>

1020
00:48:25,634 --> 00:48:27,042
<i>She didn't like to play games,</i>

1021
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,545
<i>but you never understood that.</i>

1022
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:30,369
Seems like a lot of work, Gary.

1023
00:48:30,497 --> 00:48:32,289
How'd you set all that up?

1024
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:35,073
<i>I could have done it better,
trust me. I didn't have much time.</i>

1025
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:36,450
<i>Should do the trick anyway.</i>

1026
00:48:36,577 --> 00:48:37,920
<i>With a bit of luck,
the explosions</i>

1027
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:40,514
<i>will bring down
this whole building.</i>

1028
00:48:40,929 --> 00:48:42,592
Elvis.

1029
00:48:43,873 --> 00:48:45,249
I don't wanna die here.

1030
00:48:45,378 --> 00:48:48,577
Well, if we don't wanna die,
we gotta fight.

1031
00:48:49,377 --> 00:48:51,042
He's in the building.
We can get him.

1032
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,674
You hear that, Gary?

1033
00:48:52,801 --> 00:48:54,690
<i>He's right, Dylan, really.</i>

1034
00:48:54,817 --> 00:48:58,080
<i>I said it was a game,
and I'm gonna follow the rules.</i>

1035
00:48:58,209 --> 00:48:59,809
<i>Military code of honor.</i>

1036
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,185
<i>You have a chance.</i>

1037
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:03,682
<i>If you find me,
I won't blow up the building.</i>

1038
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:05,025
<i>I'll let you go,</i>

1039
00:49:05,154 --> 00:49:07,744
<i>and I'll just kill Elvis.</i>

1040
00:49:07,873 --> 00:49:11,810
Well, then show yourself,
you slippery son of a bitch!

1041
00:49:13,026 --> 00:49:14,400
Let my girls go, okay?

1042
00:49:14,528 --> 00:49:17,248
You don't need 'em.
They're just a liability for you.

1043
00:49:17,376 --> 00:49:18,496
It's just you and me.
Man up.

1044
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,737
If you're a real man,
come down here,

1045
00:49:20,866 --> 00:49:22,145
duke it out with me, okay?

1046
00:49:22,272 --> 00:49:23,713
We'll settle this!

1047
00:49:23,842 --> 00:49:26,913
I'm too old to play fuckin'
hide-and-seek, all right?

1048
00:49:27,937 --> 00:49:29,249
<i>Are you done?</i>

1049
00:49:30,562 --> 00:49:32,066
<i>I don't think you get it.</i>

1050
00:49:32,193 --> 00:49:35,042
<i>Instead of wasting your time
talking shit,</i>

1051
00:49:35,168 --> 00:49:38,721
<i>why don't you try to find me
and save your family?</i>

1052
00:49:39,873 --> 00:49:43,650
All right, we'll do it
the fuckin' hard way.

1053
00:50:16,129 --> 00:50:17,952
<i>This could have made
a great movie.</i>

1054
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,673
<i>"The bad guy's hiding
somewhere in the building,</i>

1055
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,496
<i>the good guy is looking for him.</i>

1056
00:50:22,624 --> 00:50:24,065
<i>And then they all blow up!</i>

1057
00:50:24,193 --> 00:50:25,249
<i>The end."</i>

1058
00:50:25,376 --> 00:50:26,977
<i>What do you think?</i>

1059
00:50:27,105 --> 00:50:28,865
I think you need a rewrite.

1060
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:31,554
Sounds like a real stinker.

1061
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,319
What's the fuck's going on?

1062
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:18,624
Come on. Ton...

1063
00:51:19,553 --> 00:51:21,312
Tony? What the hell is this?

1064
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,943
What, you know him?

1065
00:51:23,072 --> 00:51:25,120
Yes. It's Tony. He's been
working here for 20 years.

1066
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,328
I didn't know it was you,
Mr. Elvis. I'm sorry.

1067
00:51:27,456 --> 00:51:30,783
What the hell got into you, attacking
him like that? I don't know him!

1068
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:32,929
You know, I couldn't see shit.

1069
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:35,200
I just saw the dead guard
at the entrance.

1070
00:51:35,776 --> 00:51:37,120
So I hid in the dark.

1071
00:51:37,248 --> 00:51:39,841
And when you guys came in,
I just jumped on the first guy.

1072
00:51:39,968 --> 00:51:43,295
What if he works for Gary and he's
lying because he couldn't take me out?

1073
00:51:43,424 --> 00:51:45,215
Out of the question, I've
known this guy since forever.

1074
00:51:45,344 --> 00:51:46,560
When you guys came in,

1075
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:49,184
I just assumed
you were part of his team.

1076
00:51:49,312 --> 00:51:50,079
Whose team?

1077
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:51,648
The fucking crazy guy's team.

1078
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:54,304
The guy that came around
with the woman and the little girl?

1079
00:51:55,809 --> 00:51:57,793
Elvis, I couldn't see anything.

1080
00:51:57,919 --> 00:51:59,360
It was super dark.
It was fuzzy.

1081
00:51:59,487 --> 00:52:01,375
Yeah, but I do remember
he was wearing a hat.

1082
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:02,880
That I do.

1083
00:52:03,904 --> 00:52:06,720
And his eyes.
I could never forget his eyes.

1084
00:52:06,847 --> 00:52:11,135
I mean, he... this guy looks as if he
just escaped a fucking mental asylum.

1085
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:13,760
I mean, he's totally cuckoo.

1086
00:52:13,886 --> 00:52:15,552
Why the hell didn't you
get out of here?

1087
00:52:15,681 --> 00:52:17,120
I did, I tried...

1088
00:52:17,248 --> 00:52:21,184
I-I... I tried to leave
through the parking lot area,

1089
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:24,127
just to find that it was
full with explosives.

1090
00:52:24,256 --> 00:52:26,688
A whole door... I mean, the
whole building for that matter,

1091
00:52:26,815 --> 00:52:30,719
it's filled with explosives,
I mean, just, you know...

1092
00:52:32,288 --> 00:52:34,047
What's going on, Elvis?
I mean, come on.

1093
00:52:34,176 --> 00:52:35,232
Are we all going to die?

1094
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,215
<i>I am loving this.</i>

1095
00:52:37,344 --> 00:52:39,680
<i>What a shit show!
You okay, Elvis?</i>

1096
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:41,152
<i>Little Dylan still in one piece?</i>

1097
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,392
<i>I hadn't planned
on Tony showing up.</i>

1098
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,598
<i>Tony, my man! I remember you.</i>

1099
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:46,815
<i>What a nice guy.</i>

1100
00:52:46,944 --> 00:52:48,383
Well, apparently
I'm getting warmer.

1101
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:50,399
You went by here
recently too, huh?

1102
00:52:50,527 --> 00:52:52,096
<i>Hold on a second, though.</i>

1103
00:52:52,223 --> 00:52:55,487
<i>It's no fair if Tony's joining
your team all of a sudden.</i>

1104
00:52:55,615 --> 00:52:57,727
Is he talking into
your headphones right now?

1105
00:52:58,336 --> 00:52:59,551
What's he saying?

1106
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,344
<i>There's no room
for an extra player.</i>

1107
00:53:01,471 --> 00:53:02,846
<i>Kill him.</i>

1108
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,304
<i>Kill that son of a bitch.</i>

1109
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,160
I'm not killing anybody.

1110
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:10,656
Tony will sit in a corner and he
won't say another fucking word, okay?

1111
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,968
He's not coming with us.

1112
00:53:12,096 --> 00:53:14,366
<i>No, Tony wasn't part of my plan.</i>

1113
00:53:14,496 --> 00:53:15,936
<i>He was supposed to clock out
at 10:00 p.m.</i>

1114
00:53:16,064 --> 00:53:17,695
<i>What the hell's he still
doing here anyway?</i>

1115
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:20,158
You get out of here, walk away,
just get out of here.

1116
00:53:20,287 --> 00:53:23,136
<i>No, that's not okay.
This is pissing me off, Elvis.</i>

1117
00:53:23,263 --> 00:53:24,639
<i>Ask him what he's doing here.</i>

1118
00:53:24,767 --> 00:53:26,846
Okay, he wants to know
what you're doing here,

1119
00:53:26,976 --> 00:53:29,024
why you didn't leave
at 10:00 p.m.

1120
00:53:31,103 --> 00:53:32,127
Me?

1121
00:53:33,246 --> 00:53:35,486
You were supposed to leave
at 10:00 p.m., right? Yeah.

1122
00:53:35,616 --> 00:53:37,119
What the hell
are you still doing here?

1123
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,456
<i>This is fishy.
Uh...</i>

1124
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,174
<i>If he doesn't answer,
kill that son of a bitch.</i>

1125
00:53:43,327 --> 00:53:45,117
I'll tell you.

1126
00:53:46,271 --> 00:53:48,159
You know, I finished my shift.

1127
00:53:48,287 --> 00:53:49,951
There were some areas
that I had to finish,

1128
00:53:50,078 --> 00:53:52,191
that I...
had to take care of,

1129
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,295
and-and I wanted to take a walk
around the office before I did.

1130
00:53:55,424 --> 00:53:57,119
That's... That's it.

1131
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:58,623
You're lying.

1132
00:53:58,752 --> 00:54:00,159
What's your problem?

1133
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:02,366
No, you tell me what you're
doing here. Tell me now.

1134
00:54:02,496 --> 00:54:04,415
Elvis... What the fuck
is up? Tell me now!

1135
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:07,455
<i>Ah, now we got some action.
Elvis is getting angry.</i>

1136
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:11,071
No, wait. He's the guy
stealing the computers,

1137
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,958
the one you were
talking about on air.

1138
00:54:13,087 --> 00:54:15,967
Tony?
You been stealing from us?

1139
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:22,206
I'm really sorry, Elvis.

1140
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,894
I really am.

1141
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:28,638
You see, my wife is very
sick over in Spain, and...

1142
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:31,678
I need it desperately.
I needed the cash.

1143
00:54:31,806 --> 00:54:34,463
I'm not doing anything wrong.
It's my cousin that sells them.

1144
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:37,439
I just give it to him. He gives
me a little cut every time.

1145
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:40,223
But it's only the sales team's
computer that I take.

1146
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:43,678
I mean, I never ever even dream
of touching one of yours, I swear.

1147
00:54:43,807 --> 00:54:45,501
You gotta believe me.

1148
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:48,447
<i>We're not gonna let him get
away with this, Elvis, are we?</i>

1149
00:54:50,302 --> 00:54:51,966
<i>Ticktock.</i>

1150
00:54:52,446 --> 00:54:53,790
<i>Ticktock!</i>

1151
00:54:53,919 --> 00:54:55,743
<i>Ticktock, time is running out.</i>

1152
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:57,694
<i>Kill this fucking thief
and come find me.</i>

1153
00:54:57,823 --> 00:55:00,703
Tony, go upstairs and
hide in the studio, okay?

1154
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,239
W-We'll settle this later, okay?

1155
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:04,350
Go on, pal, get outta here.
Thank you, Elvis.

1156
00:55:04,478 --> 00:55:05,279
I owe you.

1157
00:55:05,406 --> 00:55:07,581
<i>Elvis! What a mensch!</i>

1158
00:55:07,711 --> 00:55:08,958
<i>A true hero.</i>

1159
00:55:09,087 --> 00:55:10,622
<i>If it were me,
I'd have taken him out,</i>

1160
00:55:10,751 --> 00:55:12,638
<i>but you, you are a class act.</i>

1161
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:16,606
<i>What Hollywood actor do you think would
play you in the movie of our game, huh?</i>

1162
00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:17,502
<i>Tom Cruise?</i>

1163
00:55:17,631 --> 00:55:19,743
<i>I'd cast Joaquin Phoenix as me.</i>

1164
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:21,694
<i>Tonight, I'm kind of a joker.</i>

1165
00:55:26,878 --> 00:55:29,855
"I have a condition!"

1166
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,029
<i>I like silence.</i>

1167
00:56:04,286 --> 00:56:06,302
<i>Cold!</i>

1168
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:13,789
<i>Hot.</i>

1169
00:56:17,854 --> 00:56:20,190
<i>I wouldn't go in there
if I were you.</i>

1170
00:56:21,342 --> 00:56:23,902
<i>Getting warmer.</i>

1171
00:56:28,446 --> 00:56:30,174
<i>Not in there.</i>

1172
00:56:34,302 --> 00:56:35,582
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

1173
00:56:35,709 --> 00:56:37,789
<i>This isn't supposed
to take all night.</i>

1174
00:56:37,917 --> 00:56:41,854
<i>And since I'm a nice guy, here's
some help from someone special.</i>

1175
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,294
<i>Go on, sweetie.</i>

1176
00:56:43,423 --> 00:56:45,118
<i>Give Daddy a clue.</i>

1177
00:56:46,142 --> 00:56:49,597
<i>Daddy, I'm in a closet
with some toys.</i>

1178
00:56:49,726 --> 00:56:52,286
<i>Oh, now, that's too easy.</i>

1179
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:09,917
Hyah!

1180
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:48,029
It's Adria's.

1181
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:51,614
He's doing this
to drive you crazy.

1182
00:57:51,741 --> 00:57:53,949
<i>Now, isn't that cute?</i>

1183
00:57:54,077 --> 00:57:55,870
<i>Dear listeners,
let me set the scene.</i>

1184
00:57:55,997 --> 00:57:59,133
<i>Shock jock Elvis clutching
a plush toy covered in blood,</i>

1185
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:02,365
<i>and newbie Dylan who looks
like he's about to lose it.</i>

1186
00:58:02,494 --> 00:58:03,806
<i>And see, from where I'm sitting,</i>

1187
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:06,812
<i>I'm lucky enough
to watch the whole scene.</i>

1188
00:58:17,885 --> 00:58:19,965
He's been watching us
from the start.

1189
00:58:20,093 --> 00:58:21,789
I know where the son
of a bitch is hiding.

1190
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:23,901
He can only be in the
camera room in the basement.

1191
00:58:24,028 --> 00:58:25,630
Okay, so let's call
the police to save time.

1192
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:27,325
We don't have the luxury
of time.

1193
00:58:27,454 --> 00:58:28,700
He's a madman.

1194
00:58:28,828 --> 00:58:30,716
I've dealt with kooks
like this for 30 years.

1195
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:32,445
He's the type
to go through with it.

1196
00:58:32,573 --> 00:58:36,381
He'll kill my girls
unless we stop him. Okay?

1197
00:58:36,509 --> 00:58:40,029
By the time the cops get here,
fuck, it's hopeless.

1198
00:58:40,157 --> 00:58:42,269
He just wants to knock
everyone off and then do himself.

1199
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:45,342
We don't stand a chance.
This won't end well. No.

1200
00:58:45,469 --> 00:58:48,093
<i>Elvis, no secret powwows.</i>

1201
00:58:48,222 --> 00:58:49,564
<i>Turn your mic back on.</i>

1202
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,453
Listen, you don't have
to come with me,

1203
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,245
but I think it's safer
if we stick together.

1204
00:58:53,373 --> 00:58:55,420
I know a way
where there's no cameras.

1205
00:58:55,549 --> 00:58:57,628
We can sneak up on him
in the basement.

1206
00:58:59,261 --> 00:59:01,532
<i>Elvis,
think about your listeners.</i>

1207
00:59:01,662 --> 00:59:03,645
<i>We are live on the air!</i>

1208
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:05,340
<i>Turn your microphone back on.</i>

1209
00:59:05,469 --> 00:59:06,749
Okay, I'll play.

1210
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:10,270
I'll bet you're somewhere
in the upper floors, am I right?

1211
00:59:10,397 --> 00:59:12,540
<i>Maybe.</i>

1212
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:14,556
Yeah, I'm comin', numb nuts.

1213
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,035
Stop! Wait!

1214
00:59:53,405 --> 00:59:54,908
Hang on.

1215
00:59:56,413 --> 00:59:58,780
We have to hurry.
There's no camera down here.

1216
00:59:58,908 --> 01:00:00,573
He'll be looking for us
on the other side

1217
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,300
and realize we're not there.
Come on.

1218
01:00:02,428 --> 01:00:06,077
<i>Hey, guys, you're supposed
to find me, remember,</i>

1219
01:00:06,204 --> 01:00:08,380
<i>not the other way around.</i>

1220
01:00:08,509 --> 01:00:11,100
<i>But, hey, I'm not against
spicing things up.</i>

1221
01:00:11,228 --> 01:00:13,084
<i>Come on, give me a clue.</i>

1222
01:00:14,012 --> 01:00:16,380
<i>♪ Elvis ♪</i>

1223
01:00:18,268 --> 01:00:23,100
Hey, Gary, I'm coming
upstairs to find ya, you sick puke.

1224
01:00:30,268 --> 01:00:31,868
There's the security cameras
in that room.

1225
01:00:31,997 --> 01:00:33,212
He's in there.

1226
01:00:33,821 --> 01:00:36,540
<i>Where are you hiding?</i>

1227
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,228
One, two...

1228
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:00,316
Go!

1229
01:01:00,443 --> 01:01:03,196
All right.
Turn around or I'll brain ya.

1230
01:01:15,901 --> 01:01:19,099
You son of a bitch!

1231
01:01:19,227 --> 01:01:23,035
<i>Did you really think I'd be in there
when I can hack into any camera?</i>

1232
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:24,508
<i>I have a knack for computers.</i>

1233
01:01:24,636 --> 01:01:27,259
<i>And frankly, breaking into
a 25-year-old security system</i>

1234
01:01:27,388 --> 01:01:30,044
<i>was easier than stealing

<i>I've got all the cameras
right here on a tablet.</i>

1236
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:38,715
<i>Elvis.</i>

1237
01:01:38,844 --> 01:01:40,443
Yoo-hoo!

1238
01:01:44,315 --> 01:01:46,395
<i>Oh, hey, you're welcome,
by the way.</i>

1239
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:50,011
<i>Uh, Elvis, yoo-hoo!</i>

1240
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,283
<i>What an ingrate.
You could at least thank me.</i>

1241
01:01:52,412 --> 01:01:55,899
<i>Thank you for what? Well, you
never liked that asshole Justin, did you?</i>

1242
01:01:56,027 --> 01:01:58,748
<i>This will make it easier for
you to get his 8:00 p.m. slot.</i>

1243
01:01:58,874 --> 01:02:01,532
<i>No more sleepless nights
talking to freaks.</i>

1244
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:03,579
<i>How come you don't look happy?</i>

1245
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:05,531
<i>Nothing's ever good enough
for you, is it?</i>

1246
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:07,163
Why don't you tell me
where you are

1247
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:09,692
so I can come
and thank you personally?

1248
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:11,323
<i>Nah, you can thank me later.</i>

1249
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:14,331
Knock it off, will ya?
Son of a bitch.

1250
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,508
<i>You're right, Elvis.
It's time for a break.</i>

1251
01:02:16,637 --> 01:02:19,930
<i>And you know what? There's
something I've always dreamed of doing.</i>

1252
01:02:20,059 --> 01:02:25,052
<i>What's it like to swap places
with the king of radio?</i>

1253
01:02:28,795 --> 01:02:30,012
<i>Ahh!</i>

1254
01:02:30,138 --> 01:02:32,731
<i>Now I have a beautiful voice.</i>

1255
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:38,460
He's in the studio.
Oh, fuck. Mary. Steve.

1256
01:02:38,587 --> 01:02:39,898
Go!

1257
01:02:41,851 --> 01:02:43,867
<i>Dear listeners,
you have a new host tonight,</i>

1258
01:02:43,995 --> 01:02:45,594
<i>and it's about time.</i>

1259
01:02:45,722 --> 01:02:46,747
<i>Finally, someone loyal.</i>

1260
01:02:46,874 --> 01:02:48,634
He's powered off the elevators.

1261
01:02:48,763 --> 01:02:52,506
<i>Oh, Elvis, I'm sorry. The
elevators seem to be out of order.</i>

1262
01:02:52,634 --> 01:02:54,715
<i>Just can't catch a break, huh?</i>

1263
01:02:54,843 --> 01:02:55,867
Fuck.

1264
01:02:55,996 --> 01:02:57,307
Mary?

1265
01:02:57,434 --> 01:02:59,483
Guys. How you doing?
You okay?

1266
01:02:59,611 --> 01:03:00,826
<i>"Mary?</i>

1267
01:03:00,954 --> 01:03:02,907
<i>Guys, how you doing? You okay?"</i>

1268
01:03:03,034 --> 01:03:05,818
<i>Seriously, what kind of
a two-bit operation is this?</i>

1269
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:07,546
<i>There's no one left
at the wheel.</i>

1270
01:03:07,674 --> 01:03:09,051
<i>Thank God I showed up, right?</i>

1271
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,971
<i>Hey, we should redo the jingles.</i>

1272
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:14,362
<i>"Gary, tonight, 'On the Line.'"</i>

1273
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:16,314
<i>I think it's gonna be a hit.</i>

1274
01:03:16,442 --> 01:03:18,780
<i>Yeah, knock yourself out, buddy.
I'm on my way.</i>

1275
01:03:18,907 --> 01:03:22,362
<i>Take your time, Elvis.
Just don't be late.</i>

1276
01:03:22,907 --> 01:03:24,507
Thirteen minutes.

1277
01:03:37,306 --> 01:03:38,554
It's loaded.

1278
01:03:38,683 --> 01:03:41,019
I can't... I can't.

1279
01:03:41,146 --> 01:03:42,394
Hey, Dylan, pull it together.

1280
01:03:42,522 --> 01:03:44,700
You can't slack off now.
I need you, boy.

1281
01:03:45,916 --> 01:03:48,379
Put down your weapon, now!

1282
01:04:01,498 --> 01:04:05,177
Officer, this is
all a misunderstanding.

1283
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:09,178
Everything's fine.

1284
01:04:09,306 --> 01:04:12,379
I don't have time to explain.
I gotta go upstairs.

1285
01:04:12,507 --> 01:04:14,716
There's a madman up there
with my wife and daughter!

1286
01:04:14,841 --> 01:04:16,698
I said put down your weapons!

1287
01:04:16,826 --> 01:04:18,331
It's Elvis.

1288
01:04:19,515 --> 01:04:21,179
It's the radio star.

1289
01:04:22,522 --> 01:04:24,442
You're gonna screw
everything up, Officer.

1290
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:26,394
I'm really sorry,
but I gotta go.

1291
01:04:26,522 --> 01:04:27,866
Don't move!

1292
01:04:28,955 --> 01:04:31,643
Dispatch, I have two
individuals, one armed,

1293
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:33,882
at the bottom
of the KLAT-FM building.

1294
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:36,282
There's one man down.
Requesting backup.

1295
01:04:36,411 --> 01:04:38,745
You haven't heard, or what?

1296
01:04:38,873 --> 01:04:42,107
Why don't you call one of your
higher-IQ buddies at the station?

1297
01:04:42,235 --> 01:04:44,443
We're being attacked
by a madman.

1298
01:04:44,569 --> 01:04:45,979
I'm not talkin' to you!

1299
01:04:46,106 --> 01:04:48,283
You're gonna put down
that weapon. I'm coming in.

1300
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:49,657
Don't. You can't come in.

1301
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:53,082
Oh, I'm coming in.

1302
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:54,842
Everything's gonna be just fine.

1303
01:04:54,971 --> 01:04:56,603
No, please, please don't.

1304
01:05:00,953 --> 01:05:02,299
Don't... Don't touch that door!

1305
01:05:02,426 --> 01:05:04,761
- Put down your fuckin' weapons!
- Elvis!

1306
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:07,195
Do as he says.

1307
01:05:07,322 --> 01:05:08,378
Huh?

1308
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:11,035
Okay, okay!
I'm putting it down.

1309
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:21,915
Back away from the door
or we all die!

1310
01:05:22,042 --> 01:05:23,770
Shut up!

1311
01:05:23,897 --> 01:05:25,530
<i>Officer Glen. Stand back.</i>

1312
01:05:25,659 --> 01:05:29,338
<i>Do not enter the building.
I repeat, this is an order.</i>

1313
01:05:29,466 --> 01:05:30,938
<i>Do not enter the building.</i>

1314
01:05:31,067 --> 01:05:32,857
<i>Backup will arrive
in two minutes.</i>

1315
01:05:32,987 --> 01:05:34,553
Copy that.
What should I do?

1316
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,058
<i>Nothing. You stay put.</i>

1317
01:05:36,186 --> 01:05:37,946
<i>The situation
is extremely dangerous.</i>

1318
01:05:38,074 --> 01:05:41,305
<i>Dispatch is handling it.
SWAT is on its way.</i>

1319
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:07,674
<i>Freeze! Stop moving!</i>

1320
01:06:09,241 --> 01:06:11,129
<i>Hey, you guys deaf or what?
I said stop.</i>

1321
01:06:11,257 --> 01:06:12,824
Okay, okay, we're stopped.

1322
01:06:12,952 --> 01:06:16,314
We're gonna sit down
right here, okay?

1323
01:06:16,442 --> 01:06:17,625
<i>Good.
Okay.</i>

1324
01:06:17,752 --> 01:06:19,801
Oh, fuck!

1325
01:06:19,929 --> 01:06:22,938
<i>Now, as much as I'm enjoying
watching you scurry around like mice,</i>

1326
01:06:23,065 --> 01:06:25,626
<i>I wonder if our listeners
aren't getting a little bored.</i>

1327
01:06:25,753 --> 01:06:27,546
<i>So let's play a game.</i>

1328
01:06:27,673 --> 01:06:29,914
<i>I've stopped the clock, and
I'm going to give you the chance</i>

1329
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:32,378
<i>to win ten bonus minutes!</i>

1330
01:06:32,507 --> 01:06:35,001
<i>All you have to do
is crack the code.</i>

1331
01:06:35,896 --> 01:06:37,816
<i>What code?
Oh, it's simple.</i>

1332
01:06:37,945 --> 01:06:39,194
<i>You have four people
on your team.</i>

1333
01:06:39,322 --> 01:06:41,242
<i>Mary and Steven
are right here with me,</i>

1334
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:43,672
<i>even if they are a bit
"tied up" at the moment.</i>

1335
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:45,592
<i>And then there's Dylan and you.</i>

1336
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,098
<i>Four players, four chances.</i>

1337
01:06:47,226 --> 01:06:48,985
<i>I'm going to give you
three numbers,</i>

1338
01:06:49,114 --> 01:06:50,905
<i>and you have to find
the correct order.</i>

1339
01:06:51,034 --> 01:06:53,209
<i>If you don't,
you lose ten minutes</i>

1340
01:06:53,337 --> 01:06:55,386
<i>and one of you
will be disciplined.</i>

1341
01:06:55,513 --> 01:06:57,370
Gary, I don't wanna play
this fucking game.

1342
01:06:57,497 --> 01:06:59,385
<i>Shut your mouth and play!</i>

1343
01:06:59,513 --> 01:07:01,784
Okay, okay, calm down.
Keep your shorts on.

1344
01:07:01,912 --> 01:07:02,936
<i>Excellent!</i>

1345
01:07:03,066 --> 01:07:04,250
<i>Let's start with Steven.</i>

1346
01:07:04,377 --> 01:07:05,978
<i>Come on over
to the microphone, Steven.</i>

1347
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:10,170
These are the numbers:
One, two and three.

1348
01:07:10,297 --> 01:07:11,833
What order do you want to try?

1349
01:07:11,962 --> 01:07:14,586
<i>Don't come up!
He's crazy! It's a trap!</i>

1350
01:07:14,713 --> 01:07:15,961
<i>It's a fuckin' trap!</i>

1351
01:07:21,081 --> 01:07:23,225
<i>You guys aren't off
to a very good start.</i>

1352
01:07:23,353 --> 01:07:25,689
<i>Fortunately Steven
won't be opening his mouth</i>

1353
01:07:25,816 --> 01:07:27,385
<i>to talk any more shit.</i>

1354
01:07:27,513 --> 01:07:31,481
It's time to move on to the second
member of your team... Mary.

1355
01:07:31,609 --> 01:07:32,696
Come on down.

1356
01:07:32,826 --> 01:07:34,616
<i>Remember, we have three numbers:</i>

1357
01:07:34,746 --> 01:07:36,858
<i>One, two and three.</i>

1358
01:07:36,985 --> 01:07:39,384
<i>Well, Mary,
you'd better not screw this up.</i>

1359
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:42,360
<i>Steven has endangered the team
by acting like an asshole.</i>

1360
01:07:42,489 --> 01:07:45,337
<i>So think hard now, Mary, and...</i>

1361
01:07:46,008 --> 01:07:47,513
<i>Three...</i>

1362
01:07:47,641 --> 01:07:49,784
<i>two... one.</i>

1363
01:07:53,912 --> 01:07:55,576
<i>No dice!</i>

1364
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:56,696
<i>But well played.</i>

1365
01:07:56,826 --> 01:07:57,721
<i>Two more chances.</i>

1366
01:07:57,849 --> 01:08:00,057
<i>Elvis, over to you.</i>

1367
01:08:00,504 --> 01:08:01,913
Two, three, one.

1368
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:11,096
<i>Nope! So, it's not two, three,
one. It's not three, two, one.</i>

1369
01:08:11,225 --> 01:08:13,177
<i>Don't shit yourself, Dylan.</i>

1370
01:08:13,305 --> 01:08:16,601
<i>Mathematically, there are only
four possible combinations left.</i>

1371
01:08:16,728 --> 01:08:18,458
<i>It's your turn.</i>

1372
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,233
<i>I'm not gonna tell you what
I've got planned if you lose</i>

1373
01:08:22,361 --> 01:08:24,376
<i>because I don't wanna put
too much pressure on you,</i>

1374
01:08:24,504 --> 01:08:27,161
<i>but, uh, if you don't
crack that code,</i>

1375
01:08:27,288 --> 01:08:29,175
<i>Mary might not thank you.</i>

1376
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,497
<i>Well?</i>

1377
01:08:37,208 --> 01:08:38,361
One...

1378
01:08:39,417 --> 01:08:40,889
three...

1379
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:43,961
two.

1380
01:08:47,511 --> 01:08:50,969
<i>Bravo!
One, three, two is correct!</i>

1381
01:08:51,097 --> 01:08:52,312
<i>You've won an extra...</i>

1382
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,104
<i>You can take your time
coming upstairs.</i>

1383
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:56,632
<i>I'll be waiting for you
to music.</i>

1384
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,640
<i>Maestro, take it away!</i>

1385
01:09:01,657 --> 01:09:02,871
Wait, wait!

1386
01:09:03,001 --> 01:09:05,048
There's no time.
We gotta go.

1387
01:09:05,177 --> 01:09:06,041
I'm dead.

1388
01:09:06,169 --> 01:09:07,671
If we reach the top
out of breath,

1389
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,921
we'll be good for nothing.

1390
01:09:09,048 --> 01:09:10,712
Steven's right, it's a trap.

1391
01:09:10,841 --> 01:09:14,040
Stairs, corridors...
Gary's got it all figured out.

1392
01:09:14,169 --> 01:09:16,728
You're right, we'll be walking
right into the lion's den.

1393
01:09:16,857 --> 01:09:18,681
From the start, he's wanted you
to go down to reception.

1394
01:09:18,808 --> 01:09:20,505
He knew you'd stop
at the video room on the way

1395
01:09:20,632 --> 01:09:22,360
and he knew he could take
your place at the microphone

1396
01:09:22,488 --> 01:09:24,664
and still make you
come back up... why?

1397
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,296
Why? 'Cause he's having fun.

1398
01:09:26,424 --> 01:09:27,831
He wants me to suffer.

1399
01:09:27,961 --> 01:09:30,041
Most lunatics don't see
their crazy plans through,

1400
01:09:30,168 --> 01:09:33,752
but this guy, we got a hold of
a bona fide psychopathic killer.

1401
01:09:33,881 --> 01:09:36,536
I'm sorry I dragged you
into this, kid, really I am,

1402
01:09:36,665 --> 01:09:38,359
but we gotta go,
there's nothing else for it.

1403
01:09:38,489 --> 01:09:40,600
What's gonna happen up there?
I don't know.

1404
01:09:40,728 --> 01:09:43,000
He'll be expecting us to come
through the stairway door,

1405
01:09:43,127 --> 01:09:44,505
and then he'll probably...

1406
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,296
Fuck.

1407
01:09:46,425 --> 01:09:47,928
We got to find a different way.

1408
01:09:48,055 --> 01:09:49,592
Oh... Oh.

1409
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,968
Oh, come on!

1410
01:10:08,919 --> 01:10:12,184
It's not there. We've
still got one floor to go.

1411
01:10:12,312 --> 01:10:13,464
Yeah.

1412
01:10:17,911 --> 01:10:19,575
Okay.

1413
01:10:30,872 --> 01:10:32,440
Come on, kid.

1414
01:11:14,294 --> 01:11:15,639
Okay.

1415
01:11:18,776 --> 01:11:20,631
Oh, shit!

1416
01:11:20,759 --> 01:11:24,567
Ah, the dulcet tones of opera
never did anybody any harm.

1417
01:11:24,696 --> 01:11:27,096
Let's take a moment to catch up

1418
01:11:27,223 --> 01:11:31,000
with our favorite idiot, Elvis.

1419
01:11:31,127 --> 01:11:33,399
I don't see Olivia
or Adria anywhere,

1420
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:34,871
but he's got Mary tied up.

1421
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,872
Fuck. Okay. Now he's
probably expecting us to...

1422
01:11:42,872 --> 01:11:45,207
Oh, fuck!

1423
01:11:47,255 --> 01:11:48,471
Fuck!

1424
01:11:49,143 --> 01:11:50,904
This is my fault.

1425
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:53,367
I told him to come up here.

1426
01:11:54,871 --> 01:11:57,495
He's expecting us
to come from the stairway.

1427
01:11:57,623 --> 01:12:00,118
We'll run in this door,
get in behind him,

1428
01:12:00,247 --> 01:12:01,816
we'll jump him, and then...

1429
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:04,855
What?
I don't think I can do this.

1430
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,727
Okay, okay. Listen.

1431
01:12:08,855 --> 01:12:10,551
Look, you take this, all right?

1432
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:13,014
You're gonna need it more.
Give me the box cutter.

1433
01:12:13,143 --> 01:12:14,967
And then we'll both...

1434
01:12:15,095 --> 01:12:17,303
Well, I'll go in,
I'll get control of him.

1435
01:12:17,431 --> 01:12:20,023
You run around the back
to the other door

1436
01:12:20,151 --> 01:12:22,263
and get the drop on him
that way, okay,

1437
01:12:22,391 --> 01:12:24,311
and try and find
my family, all right?

1438
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:25,654
Okay.
Okay.

1439
01:12:25,783 --> 01:12:27,383
You ready? I'm
depending on you. Okay.

1440
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:29,303
One, two, three, go!

1441
01:13:05,943 --> 01:13:08,023
Game's up, Gary. It's all over.

1442
01:13:08,151 --> 01:13:11,863
I finally get to meet
the star in person.

1443
01:13:13,047 --> 01:13:14,583
I swear, if you don't tell me
where they are,

1444
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:16,502
I'm gonna...
You're gonna what?

1445
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:18,262
Huh?
Slit my throat on the air?

1446
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:21,238
At least everybody
will see your true colors.

1447
01:13:21,366 --> 01:13:26,358
Listen up, ladies and gentlemen, Elvis
is about to kill somebody live on the air.

1448
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:27,575
Bad luck, it's me.

1449
01:13:27,702 --> 01:13:29,495
This will be Elvis's
second murder.

1450
01:13:29,622 --> 01:13:31,638
First he killed Lauren,
because yes,

1451
01:13:31,767 --> 01:13:34,870
it is your fault
she committed suicide.

1452
01:13:34,999 --> 01:13:37,430
Now he's after
the helpless boyfriend.

1453
01:13:37,558 --> 01:13:41,623
The good news is, something's finally
happening on this boring-ass show.

1454
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,710
Dylan.

1455
01:13:42,838 --> 01:13:46,166
Cut Mary loose, and, Mary,
when he does that,

1456
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:47,382
get us off the air, okay?

1457
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:49,174
Oh, no, no, no,
that's a bad idea.

1458
01:13:49,302 --> 01:13:51,382
You don't wanna do that.

1459
01:13:52,054 --> 01:13:54,198
What's that?
You're gonna laugh.

1460
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:57,302
If you kill me,
I'll have to drop this,

1461
01:13:57,431 --> 01:14:00,117
and if the button comes up,
bada boom!

1462
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:03,350
What kind of B-grade
movie bullshit is this?

1463
01:14:03,478 --> 01:14:06,679
You didn't think I was gonna let you
come up here and ruin the end of the show?

1464
01:14:06,805 --> 01:14:08,887
I figured somebody
would catch me eventually.

1465
01:14:09,013 --> 01:14:11,510
This is my
"get out of jail free" card.

1466
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,174
Ah, right on time.

1467
01:14:22,742 --> 01:14:24,981
The game might
not be over just yet.

1468
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:29,781
I'd get that
if I were you, Elvis.

1469
01:14:30,486 --> 01:14:32,694
Mary.

1470
01:14:32,821 --> 01:14:34,741
Put it on speaker.

1471
01:14:40,661 --> 01:14:41,717
<i>Hello?</i>

1472
01:14:41,846 --> 01:14:44,471
Good day, sir.
Thank you for your call.

1473
01:14:44,597 --> 01:14:45,653
How are you today?

1474
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:47,446
<i>Can you introduce yourself?</i>

1475
01:14:47,573 --> 01:14:50,805
Politeness would dictate that the
caller should introduce himself first,

1476
01:14:50,934 --> 01:14:52,885
though I think I actually
know who you are.

1477
01:14:53,015 --> 01:14:56,887
And thank you because
you've called at a great time.

1478
01:14:57,013 --> 01:14:59,509
<i>I'm Bruce, LAPD SWAT team.</i>

1479
01:14:59,637 --> 01:15:01,877
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Bruce. My name is Gary...

1480
01:15:02,006 --> 01:15:04,982
Shut the fuck up, Gary.
Bruce, this is Elvis.

1481
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:07,317
I got a hold of a guy
here in the studio

1482
01:15:07,446 --> 01:15:10,805
who's already killed or
kidnapped several people already.

1483
01:15:10,934 --> 01:15:12,373
He stashed my wife
and daughter someplace.

1484
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:14,613
I don't know where
the fuck they are.

1485
01:15:15,381 --> 01:15:16,917
And he's holding a device,

1486
01:15:17,047 --> 01:15:19,765
says he's gonna blow
the entire building up.

1487
01:15:21,109 --> 01:15:24,086
I don't know if it's true or
not. I think it could be bullshit.

1488
01:15:24,213 --> 01:15:26,006
<i>We're aware
of the situation. I'm sorry.</i>

1489
01:15:26,134 --> 01:15:27,926
<i>We found your wife
and daughter on the terrace,</i>

1490
01:15:28,054 --> 01:15:30,261
<i>and... and, uh...</i>

1491
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:32,022
What, what? What, what?

1492
01:15:32,149 --> 01:15:34,709
Did you kill them?
Did you fucking kill them?

1493
01:15:36,693 --> 01:15:37,814
<i>We have a problem.</i>

1494
01:15:37,941 --> 01:15:39,702
That's for sure.

1495
01:15:39,829 --> 01:15:42,389
What the hell is going on?
Are they dead?

1496
01:15:42,517 --> 01:15:45,205
<i>No. No, they're alive.</i>

1497
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,614
I'm not a monster.

1498
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:49,558
You're projecting
your own personality onto me.

1499
01:15:50,837 --> 01:15:52,631
Well, then what's the problem?

1500
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,605
<i>They're tied up with
explosives we can't identify.</i>

1501
01:15:55,733 --> 01:15:57,525
<i>Bomb squad's on its way,</i>

1502
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:59,924
<i>and this phone number was written
on a piece of paper taped to them,</i>

1503
01:16:00,053 --> 01:16:00,949
<i>so I called it.</i>

1504
01:16:01,077 --> 01:16:02,900
You sick motherfucker.

1505
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:05,172
And you're a smart guy so I
think you can guess what'll happen

1506
01:16:05,301 --> 01:16:06,582
if I lift my finger
off the detonator?

1507
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:09,397
We'll have fireworks
up on the terrace.

1508
01:16:09,525 --> 01:16:15,253
So, please, be so kind as to
put down the knife and go sit.

1509
01:16:15,925 --> 01:16:18,165
It's you I've come for,
not them.

1510
01:16:18,293 --> 01:16:19,317
So trust me.

1511
01:16:19,446 --> 01:16:20,533
Trust you.

1512
01:16:20,661 --> 01:16:22,421
Yeah, you could use
a little more trust.

1513
01:16:22,549 --> 01:16:23,797
Okay, you have two options:

1514
01:16:23,924 --> 01:16:25,973
either you kill me
and I blow up Adria and Olivia,

1515
01:16:26,102 --> 01:16:29,877
or you can be reasonable
and go sit the fuck down.

1516
01:16:32,693 --> 01:16:34,229
No.

1517
01:16:34,357 --> 01:16:37,012
Bruce, these explosives.

1518
01:16:37,141 --> 01:16:38,997
Can they be deactivated?

1519
01:16:40,406 --> 01:16:42,037
<i>I don't know, I'm telling you.</i>

1520
01:16:42,165 --> 01:16:44,053
<i>Never seen anything
like it in my life.</i>

1521
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:46,133
<i>It's got a motion detector,
so if they move,</i>

1522
01:16:46,262 --> 01:16:47,957
<i>I think it might
set off the bomb and...</i>

1523
01:16:48,086 --> 01:16:49,940
<i>and there's a digital
keypad for a code.</i>

1524
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:53,397
<i>I'm assuming Gary
knows the code.</i>

1525
01:16:54,548 --> 01:16:55,285
<i>Gary?</i>

1526
01:16:55,412 --> 01:16:56,950
Yes, I can give you that code.

1527
01:16:57,077 --> 01:17:00,694
But first tell Elvis to remove
his fucking knife from my throat.

1528
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,197
It's sharp.

1529
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:05,461
Oh, kid, it's no use.

1530
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:08,084
Can't you see this has
nothing to do with you?

1531
01:17:08,214 --> 01:17:09,429
Same as for the knife.

1532
01:17:09,556 --> 01:17:12,468
You shoot me,
and the terrace goes boom.

1533
01:17:15,444 --> 01:17:19,700
So does the parking lot,
the reception, everything.

1534
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:22,613
That's what I call
ending the show with a bang.

1535
01:17:34,804 --> 01:17:36,500
No use, kid, drop it.

1536
01:17:36,628 --> 01:17:38,804
That's right, Dylan.
Listen to Daddy.

1537
01:17:38,934 --> 01:17:39,925
Drop the gun.

1538
01:17:41,588 --> 01:17:43,541
Oh, okay, you wanna be a hero?

1539
01:17:44,308 --> 01:17:46,741
Okay, I've got an idea.

1540
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:51,092
Why don't we remove the
explosive vests from Adria and Olivia

1541
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:52,788
and put them on you instead?

1542
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:54,325
You can save the widow
and the orphan.

1543
01:17:54,453 --> 01:17:57,460
You'll go down
in the history books, man.

1544
01:17:57,588 --> 01:17:59,797
Now, there's a slight chance
you'll get blown up in the process,

1545
01:17:59,923 --> 01:18:01,876
but, uh, I think it's
worth it, don't you?

1546
01:18:03,476 --> 01:18:05,076
Hey, put the vests on me.

1547
01:18:05,204 --> 01:18:07,060
It's me you want.

1548
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:08,949
Let me wear all
your crappy explosives

1549
01:18:09,076 --> 01:18:11,188
and let these others go,
they're innocent.

1550
01:18:11,316 --> 01:18:14,163
But that's no fun, Elvis.

1551
01:18:14,292 --> 01:18:16,660
No, the fun part
is making you choose:

1552
01:18:16,787 --> 01:18:18,580
who would you rather
wear the vests,

1553
01:18:18,707 --> 01:18:21,076
your wife and daughter
or the new kid?

1554
01:18:22,516 --> 01:18:24,277
Oh, my God.
I've got another idea.

1555
01:18:24,404 --> 01:18:25,556
Let's draw straws.

1556
01:18:25,683 --> 01:18:30,260
Elvis, you get to choose
who wears the vests.

1557
01:18:30,388 --> 01:18:34,292
I am gonna write down
the name of each person,

1558
01:18:34,421 --> 01:18:36,051
uh, except my own, of course.

1559
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,004
I'm not that crazy.

1560
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:45,173
All right, Elvis,
you do the honors.

1561
01:18:53,717 --> 01:18:54,804
It's me.

1562
01:18:54,933 --> 01:18:57,140
Wow. That is classy.

1563
01:18:57,268 --> 01:18:59,252
I'd applaud, but that
would blow everything up.

1564
01:18:59,379 --> 01:19:00,947
Don't fuck with me, Elvis.

1565
01:19:01,076 --> 01:19:03,060
Tell us the truth.
It's me.

1566
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:05,972
Now, how is that possible?

1567
01:19:10,675 --> 01:19:12,213
Luck has spoken.

1568
01:19:12,339 --> 01:19:16,116
Dylan, you are the winner
and tonight's superhero.

1569
01:19:16,243 --> 01:19:18,483
Now, why don't you
hand over that gun?

1570
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:24,242
Officer Bruce, you still there?

1571
01:19:24,371 --> 01:19:28,147
I'm gonna give you the
deactivation codes for the two vests.

1572
01:19:28,276 --> 01:19:30,867
Then you're gonna carry them
down to us very carefully,

1573
01:19:30,996 --> 01:19:32,851
because they're fragile.

1574
01:19:33,684 --> 01:19:35,348
Now, remember,
if I drop this detonator,

1575
01:19:35,475 --> 01:19:37,940
all the other bombs
are going to blow up.

1576
01:19:38,068 --> 01:19:40,052
<i>Okay, Gary, I'm listening.</i>

1577
01:19:40,179 --> 01:19:42,068
For Olivia,

1578
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:47,251
060877 and the star key.

1579
01:19:47,379 --> 01:19:48,660
For Adria,

1580
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:53,268
040478.

1581
01:19:54,324 --> 01:19:56,691
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

1582
01:19:59,988 --> 01:20:02,323
No, hold on, shit.
It's the other way around.

1583
01:20:02,451 --> 01:20:07,028
Um, 040478 is Olivia,
060877 is Adria.

1584
01:20:07,155 --> 01:20:08,884
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1585
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:10,227
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1586
01:20:10,355 --> 01:20:12,242
I guess we're about to find out.

1587
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:23,635
Beep... beep-beep-beep.

1588
01:20:23,762 --> 01:20:25,715
<i>It's okay.</i>

1589
01:20:25,843 --> 01:20:27,634
<i>It looks like the vests
have been deactivated.</i>

1590
01:20:27,763 --> 01:20:31,411
What a relief. To be honest, I
wasn't 100% sure about those codes.

1591
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:33,043
I'm glad this worked out.

1592
01:20:33,171 --> 01:20:35,155
<i>Everything's fine.
Olivia and Adria are safe.</i>

1593
01:20:35,283 --> 01:20:36,659
<i>We're evacuating them now.</i>

1594
01:20:36,788 --> 01:20:39,923
Okay, Bruce, but hurry up.
My hand's starting to cramp.

1595
01:20:40,051 --> 01:20:42,643
I don't know how much longer
I can hold onto this thing.

1596
01:20:44,116 --> 01:20:45,139
Thanks.

1597
01:20:45,268 --> 01:20:48,371
For what? You know
I'm gonna kill you, right?

1598
01:20:50,068 --> 01:20:51,796
For letting my family go.

1599
01:20:57,683 --> 01:21:01,363
Gary, we all understand
your misfortune.

1600
01:21:01,491 --> 01:21:03,539
But you don't
have to kill anybody.

1601
01:21:03,668 --> 01:21:07,411
Tonight, all our listeners heard
what he did to Lauren.

1602
01:21:07,538 --> 01:21:09,650
Everyone understands
how you feel.

1603
01:21:10,578 --> 01:21:12,275
If you keep Elvis alive,

1604
01:21:12,402 --> 01:21:14,322
he'll have to live with himself.

1605
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:18,739
After all, he's to blame
for everyone who died tonight.

1606
01:21:20,019 --> 01:21:21,460
- We can agree on that.
- Exactly.

1607
01:21:21,587 --> 01:21:23,379
This is all his fault.
He's the one to blame.

1608
01:21:23,507 --> 01:21:28,403
If you let us all go, we'll
remember only your pain and mercy.

1609
01:21:28,532 --> 01:21:30,739
Everyone will understand what
you went through in the army.

1610
01:21:30,866 --> 01:21:33,907
The public will be on your side.

1611
01:21:34,546 --> 01:21:35,923
But if you kill him,

1612
01:21:36,052 --> 01:21:37,362
that'll end it all.

1613
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:40,434
If Lauren were here,
right at this moment,

1614
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:43,603
she'd tell you
that you did well.

1615
01:21:47,186 --> 01:21:49,299
Elvis has played
some nasty tricks on me too.

1616
01:21:49,427 --> 01:21:52,819
The worst jokes since I
started working here.

1617
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:55,251
I can imagine what Lauren felt.

1618
01:21:55,379 --> 01:21:57,171
Really. Thank you.

1619
01:21:57,299 --> 01:21:59,091
You've got the message out.

1620
01:21:59,987 --> 01:22:02,803
Tomorrow Elvis won't
have a show anymore.

1621
01:22:03,635 --> 01:22:05,874
But that's it.
That's enough.

1622
01:22:06,003 --> 01:22:08,338
It's time to stop, okay?

1623
01:22:16,978 --> 01:22:18,738
That's good, Gary.

1624
01:22:18,865 --> 01:22:20,626
I'm upstairs at the door.

1625
01:22:20,753 --> 01:22:22,546
I'm alone.

1626
01:22:22,673 --> 01:22:24,722
All right, come on in, Bruce,
and no funny business

1627
01:22:24,851 --> 01:22:27,154
or I'm gonna shoot Elvis
and I'll blow it all to hell.

1628
01:22:27,282 --> 01:22:28,466
Calm down, Gary. Remember...

1629
01:22:28,595 --> 01:22:30,675
Shut the fuck up!
That was all empty talk.

1630
01:22:30,802 --> 01:22:32,371
You were leading me on,
weren't you?

1631
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:33,586
No.
Shh!

1632
01:22:38,195 --> 01:22:39,283
Gary.

1633
01:22:40,562 --> 01:22:42,002
See?

1634
01:22:42,131 --> 01:22:43,569
I'm here.

1635
01:22:43,697 --> 01:22:47,473
I'm not armed.
Everything's fine.

1636
01:22:47,602 --> 01:22:51,473
Why don't you help Dylan get
dressed? I think he's a little bit cold.

1637
01:22:51,602 --> 01:22:52,818
Good.

1638
01:22:54,771 --> 01:22:57,394
I'm sorry, kid.
It's gonna be all right.

1639
01:22:58,610 --> 01:23:00,370
Hurry it up, Bruce.

1640
01:23:01,074 --> 01:23:03,187
Now, on vest number one,

1641
01:23:03,315 --> 01:23:06,227
enter 040478.

1642
01:23:21,843 --> 01:23:23,506
Vest number two.

1643
01:23:23,634 --> 01:23:28,657
060877.

1644
01:23:35,122 --> 01:23:38,417
Okay, Gary. This whole
place is surrounded.

1645
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:40,659
We all want this to end well.

1646
01:23:43,442 --> 01:23:45,008
We'd like to offer you a deal.

1647
01:23:47,506 --> 01:23:49,394
Boring!

1648
01:23:49,522 --> 01:23:50,865
God! Oh!

1649
01:23:50,994 --> 01:23:54,034
I just... I just don't know
how this can end, guys.

1650
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:56,402
It's not looking good, though,
is it?

1651
01:23:56,529 --> 01:23:58,226
Not looking good at all.

1652
01:23:58,802 --> 01:24:00,977
You know what? Fuck it.

1653
01:24:01,106 --> 01:24:03,953
Let's free our listeners
from this never-ending show.

1654
01:24:05,297 --> 01:24:09,266
Elvis, let me just say you are the
world's worst fucking radio host.

1655
01:24:10,674 --> 01:24:12,530
Now let's end this
with fireworks.

1656
01:24:19,378 --> 01:24:22,034
No!

1657
01:24:44,146 --> 01:24:45,778
That was a riot!

1658
01:24:48,754 --> 01:24:50,289
That was amazing.

1659
01:24:52,304 --> 01:24:54,609
How the hell
did we pull that off?

1660
01:24:54,737 --> 01:24:55,761
Whoo!

1661
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:58,385
- I think we just...
- Insane. Insane.

1662
01:24:58,513 --> 01:25:02,610
...performed the greatest prank
in the history of this show!

1663
01:25:04,688 --> 01:25:05,809
My dear listeners.

1664
01:25:05,938 --> 01:25:08,369
I'm sorry if we gave you
a huge scare.

1665
01:25:08,496 --> 01:25:12,562
But this whole thing, this entire
thing was just one big hoax.

1666
01:25:12,689 --> 01:25:15,026
Yes, that's right.

1667
01:25:15,153 --> 01:25:16,303
Yes!

1668
01:25:16,433 --> 01:25:18,002
We were screwing with you,
that's right.

1669
01:25:18,128 --> 01:25:19,953
We're a bunch
of dirty deceivers.

1670
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:25,361
And I'm sure his fans
recognized him from the very start.

1671
01:25:25,489 --> 01:25:28,656
Gary was played by none other
than James Steel,

1672
01:25:28,784 --> 01:25:30,066
the king of the Internet!

1673
01:25:30,193 --> 01:25:32,560
I think he slept with Bezos
to get the title.

1674
01:25:32,689 --> 01:25:34,353
Yeah! What an actor.

1675
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,986
What a performance.
That was really amazing.

1676
01:25:36,112 --> 01:25:38,961
In fact, it was so good,
I was in on it,

1677
01:25:39,089 --> 01:25:40,145
I thought you'd snapped.

1678
01:25:40,272 --> 01:25:42,353
Hey, what's up, everybody?

1679
01:25:42,481 --> 01:25:43,793
That was one crazy trip,

1680
01:25:43,922 --> 01:25:46,032
and you know you'll be
finding all the videos

1681
01:25:46,161 --> 01:25:47,793
posted to my social media
tomorrow.

1682
01:25:47,921 --> 01:25:49,808
Yes, that's right,
we filmed it all!

1683
01:25:51,281 --> 01:25:53,009
I just wanna give
another shout out to my man,

1684
01:25:53,137 --> 01:25:56,433
who we devised this prank for
over the past several weeks.

1685
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,801
The one and only Dylan!

1686
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:05,681
Yeah!

1687
01:26:05,809 --> 01:26:08,433
And, Olivia, get your
talented ass over here.

1688
01:26:08,561 --> 01:26:12,048
All right, that was
incredible! Oh, my God.

1689
01:26:12,177 --> 01:26:14,257
This is a very gifted actress
called Carole Weyers.

1690
01:26:14,385 --> 01:26:18,161
And she not only did Olivia
but the voice of Adria.

1691
01:26:18,289 --> 01:26:22,033
"Daddy, please save me!"

1692
01:26:24,625 --> 01:26:26,704
And a big bravo
to Richard Anderson,

1693
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:29,553
who played
our very credible SWAT guy.

1694
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:32,047
You really were
pretty scared, man.

1695
01:26:32,177 --> 01:26:33,616
Yeah.

1696
01:26:33,745 --> 01:26:37,169
And, of course, we warned LA
and Pasadena's PD in advance.

1697
01:26:37,297 --> 01:26:39,792
We gotta keep our cops
kosher, right?

1698
01:26:39,921 --> 01:26:42,321
So, let me clarify
that no police were involved,

1699
01:26:42,449 --> 01:26:45,361
hurt or made to look worse
than they actually are.

1700
01:26:45,487 --> 01:26:47,056
So...

1701
01:26:47,185 --> 01:26:48,880
By the way, Mary and I...

1702
01:26:49,009 --> 01:26:51,697
we're actually
not sleeping together.

1703
01:26:51,824 --> 01:26:53,297
Oh!
Yet.

1704
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,369
I have a rule:
no men over 80 years old.

1705
01:26:56,497 --> 01:26:59,217
Oh, yeah, you don't want old age
creeping up on you.

1706
01:26:59,345 --> 01:27:01,297
And Justin back from the dead!

1707
01:27:01,424 --> 01:27:03,185
Whoo!
Whoo!

1708
01:27:03,313 --> 01:27:04,336
Must eat your brain!

1709
01:27:04,464 --> 01:27:06,161
My brains, aw,
it's a very small thing.

1710
01:27:06,289 --> 01:27:08,209
You know you got off
on watching me dead.

1711
01:27:08,336 --> 01:27:09,808
Oh, yeah, I want
your fuckin' slot, man,

1712
01:27:09,937 --> 01:27:11,793
but you know I love you,
buddy, I love you.

1713
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,201
But you did say,
"Go fuck yourself."

1714
01:27:13,327 --> 01:27:14,480
You didn't mean that, did you?

1715
01:27:14,608 --> 01:27:15,824
Oh, I meant it.
I was kind of hurt by that.

1716
01:27:15,952 --> 01:27:17,680
I'm a big fan of yours,
you know that.

1717
01:27:17,809 --> 01:27:20,689
I was really proud to be a part
of this. Thanks. What a suck-up.

1718
01:27:20,816 --> 01:27:22,161
I'd like to say something.

1719
01:27:22,288 --> 01:27:24,208
I'd like to say something
if I may.

1720
01:27:24,336 --> 01:27:26,033
You know,
I really want to apologize

1721
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,504
for having attacked poor Dylan.

1722
01:27:27,632 --> 01:27:28,913
Yeah, dude,
what were you thinking?

1723
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,928
You freaked me out.
You were supposed to attack me.

1724
01:27:31,057 --> 01:27:33,616
I don't know. Listen,
I just got carried away.

1725
01:27:33,744 --> 01:27:35,793
I mean,
I was so excited. Sorry.

1726
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,512
This is Tony, played by Tony.

1727
01:27:41,296 --> 01:27:42,961
A very highly strung
performance there.

1728
01:27:43,087 --> 01:27:44,304
Tony's one of the crazy actors

1729
01:27:44,432 --> 01:27:45,809
who's been working
with me for years.

1730
01:27:45,936 --> 01:27:48,208
Elvis, this is one of the best
shows of my life, thank you.

1731
01:27:48,336 --> 01:27:51,344
Dylan, we promised
to make you feel welcome,

1732
01:27:51,472 --> 01:27:54,352
and I think, I think we've done
just that, yeah, don't you?

1733
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:58,959
But the real question is,
after all of this...

1734
01:27:59,088 --> 01:28:01,168
will we see you back
in the studio tomorrow

1735
01:28:01,295 --> 01:28:04,657
or are you gonna just go away
and hate us for the rest of your life?

1736
01:28:20,464 --> 01:28:22,352
- Awww!
- Aw, come on!

1737
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:23,408
Dylan!

1738
01:28:23,536 --> 01:28:25,392
Maybe we went too far.

1739
01:28:26,128 --> 01:28:27,184
Dylan.
Dylan.

1740
01:28:27,312 --> 01:28:29,456
Dylan, come on, bro.
Come on.

1741
01:28:31,152 --> 01:28:33,264
Dylan. Don't be that guy.

1742
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:35,312
Hey, buddy!

1743
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,847
Buddy!

1744
01:28:36,976 --> 01:28:38,480
You're better than that.

1745
01:28:38,608 --> 01:28:40,720
Dylan, come on, dude.

1746
01:28:41,328 --> 01:28:43,119
Dylan? Dylan?

1747
01:28:43,248 --> 01:28:45,425
Come on back.
Let's be live, baby.

1748
01:28:45,551 --> 01:28:46,959
Tell us what you thought
of all this.

1749
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:49,935
I mean, we really worked
our asses off for you, kid.

1750
01:28:50,064 --> 01:28:51,024
Oh, come on!

1751
01:28:51,151 --> 01:28:53,136
- Oh, come on.
- Yes!

1752
01:28:53,263 --> 01:28:55,599
Probably crossed the line there.

1753
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:58,575
Hey.

1754
01:28:58,703 --> 01:29:00,272
Hey, Carole, the mic.

1755
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:02,511
Come on, Dylan.
Don't get mad, get even.

1756
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,016
All right?

1757
01:29:05,008 --> 01:29:07,215
Hey, say a few words
to the listeners.

1758
01:29:07,919 --> 01:29:09,231
Come on, kid, speak up.

1759
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:11,727
Come on, kid, it's your moment.
Let's go.

1760
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,919
Come on, dude.
Hey, Dylan, man up, come on.

1761
01:29:16,048 --> 01:29:18,768
We've all had to change our
shorts more than once this year.

1762
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:19,888
Hey, what...?

1763
01:29:20,016 --> 01:29:21,519
Whoa!
Holy shit!

1764
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,278
Oh, my God!
Dylan!

1765
01:29:26,705 --> 01:29:27,665
Call 911!

1766
01:29:27,791 --> 01:29:29,263
Oh, my God.

1767
01:29:29,391 --> 01:29:31,118
Oh, my God.
Shit.

1768
01:29:44,623 --> 01:29:46,191
He's dead.

1769
01:29:48,271 --> 01:29:49,327
What?

1770
01:30:40,047 --> 01:30:41,455
We're taking away the body.

1771
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:43,726
We will need you
for the deposition.

1772
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:46,831
Please go home
so we can find you.

1773
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:55,024
There are dozens of journalists
and press out the front.

1774
01:30:55,151 --> 01:30:56,880
You should go through the back.

1775
01:30:57,006 --> 01:30:59,022
Go home to Olivia and Adria.

1776
01:31:25,102 --> 01:31:27,694
How many times did I warn you?

1777
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:30,638
I told you it was too much.

1778
01:31:32,846 --> 01:31:34,831
You killed him, Elvis.

1779
01:31:35,662 --> 01:31:38,318
It's your fault.
You did this.

1780
01:31:40,718 --> 01:31:42,414
He was just a kid.

1781
01:31:44,975 --> 01:31:48,942
For years I've been telling you to
put some limits on your practical jokes,

1782
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,855
but no, it was never
enough for you.

1783
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:57,997
I knew it. I fucking knew
it would end badly.

1784
01:32:00,751 --> 01:32:04,718
I don't even have to fire you
because your career is over now.

1785
01:32:09,807 --> 01:32:11,310
I'm done.

1786
01:32:13,518 --> 01:32:15,950
I won't ever go
on the mic again.

1787
01:32:17,487 --> 01:32:19,182
Where are you going now?

1788
01:32:21,295 --> 01:32:22,351
Home.

1789
01:32:22,478 --> 01:32:23,661
No, no, no, no.
Come here. Come here.

1790
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:25,519
Reporters are crawling
everywhere.

1791
01:32:25,645 --> 01:32:27,278
The bloodsuckers
are waiting by your car.

1792
01:32:27,406 --> 01:32:29,518
Come on, get in.
I'll take you home. Get in.

1793
01:32:35,662 --> 01:32:37,326
Fuck, Elvis!

1794
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:40,495
The media will get you.

1795
01:32:40,623 --> 01:32:41,997
And your family too.

1796
01:32:43,021 --> 01:32:45,006
I won't be surprised
if they leave you.

1797
01:32:45,133 --> 01:32:46,894
You'll probably be serving time.

1798
01:32:47,022 --> 01:32:49,006
You're gonna need a fucking
good lawyer, that's for sure.

1799
01:32:49,135 --> 01:32:51,406
Okay, I need to calm down now.

1800
01:32:51,533 --> 01:32:53,517
Max, please, turn on the radio.

1801
01:32:53,645 --> 01:32:55,983
<i>As we said earlier,
breaking news.</i>

1802

Happy birthday!

1813
01:33:25,869 --> 01:33:28,141
Happy birthday, honey.

1814
01:33:29,102 --> 01:33:29,997
Dylan!

1815
01:33:31,597 --> 01:33:34,734
What the...?
You motherfuckers.

1816
01:33:34,861 --> 01:33:36,365
You motherfuckers!
We got ya!

1817
01:33:36,493 --> 01:33:38,158
Oh, Jesus!

You! Come here.

1819
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:48,718
I'm glad you're still alive.
I really am, I'm glad, kid.

1820
01:33:48,845 --> 01:33:50,156
Actually, it's Max.

1821
01:33:50,285 --> 01:33:53,582
Horse falls, car stunts,
and, uh... staircases.

1822
01:33:55,374 --> 01:33:56,557
Kind of a Stuntman 101.

1823
01:33:56,685 --> 01:33:58,541
And we threw in
a few little extras.

1824
01:33:58,669 --> 01:34:01,198
- Like that fight with Tony.
- Oh.

1825
01:34:01,325 --> 01:34:03,022
Ah, you!

1826
01:34:03,149 --> 01:34:06,124
When Mary told us she wanted
to trap the next newbie,

1827
01:34:06,253 --> 01:34:09,806
I called James and we came up
with this beautiful happy ending.

1828
01:34:09,933 --> 01:34:12,365
- Happy birthday!
- Mary!

1829
01:34:15,438 --> 01:34:17,900
Happy birthday, you prick!

1830
01:34:18,542 --> 01:34:20,173
You should have seen your face!

1831
01:34:20,302 --> 01:34:21,422
Oh, you were fucked up.

1832
01:34:21,549 --> 01:34:22,700
Say "cheese," Elvis.

1833
01:34:22,829 --> 01:34:24,461
You know this reaction shot
is going viral.

1834
01:34:24,589 --> 01:34:26,861
<i>Yay! Yes, yes!</i>

1835
01:34:26,989 --> 01:34:28,397
You fuckin' got me!

1836
01:34:28,525 --> 01:34:30,958
You're all a bunch
of complicit assholes, okay?

1837
01:34:31,084 --> 01:34:34,924
Sleep with one eye open because
my revenge will be ruthless.

1838
01:34:35,053 --> 01:34:36,301
Ohh!

1839
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:38,669
Now, it is time for bed, yeah?
Yes.

1840
01:34:38,797 --> 01:34:40,334
So we'll leave you
with the final word.

1841
01:34:40,462 --> 01:34:41,837
What do you wanna say?

1842
01:34:41,965 --> 01:34:44,110
I'll have the final word,
all right. Um...

1843
01:34:45,102 --> 01:34:47,342
I'll see you all tomorrow.

1844
01:34:47,468 --> 01:34:49,102
