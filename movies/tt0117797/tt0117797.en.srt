2
00:03:54,263 --> 00:03:55,389
Name of the corpse?

3
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:56,929
I don't know.

4
00:03:57,934 --> 00:03:59,765
What do you mean?

5
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:01,170
One of your workers, isn't it?

6
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,068
No, she's not.

7
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:03,331
Don't lie to us.

8
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,072
It's true. Never seen her before.

9
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:08,402
Whatever. Just get it out of here.

10
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:10,136
Don't leave it lying around here.

11
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:13,349
What do you think you're doing?

12
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:14,941
This isn't a fucking funeral home.

13
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,048
What's going on?

14
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,647
What's this?

15
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:27,560
You can't do that!

16
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:30,066
They stick cigarettes in rice in your
fucking country?

17
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:31,465
C'mon, get rid of all this!

18
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:34,531
What a bunch of freaks.

19
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,499
Hey!

20
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:43,872
What the hell are you doing?!

21
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:47,175
You're destroying the place!

22
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,991
For fuck's sake!

23
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:08,326
She wasn't your mother was she?

24
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:14,536
No, she wasn't.

25
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:18,014
Damn Yentowns!

26
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:20,346
We've never seen her before.

27
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:37,838
You will forgive me, won't you?

28
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,035
A Japanese funeral would've
cost a fortune.

29
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,540
It's OK, I bet your Mom's made it
to heaven.

30
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,726
Yuriko really stashed it away!

31
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:07,134
Give it me!

32
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:07,768
What for?

33
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,030
I'll settle with you later.

34
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,371
What do you mean?

35
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,872
I told you, didn't I?

36
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,271
We'll split it later.

37
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,774
Well it's no use to her now is it?

38
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,812
But I was the one who found it!

39
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,184
Look after yourself

40
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,980
Take care.

41
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,924
Don't you forget us.

42
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,227
Good luck!

43
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,537
How come I haven't seen you?

44
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:48,938
Drop by.

45
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,176
Hurry up, lazy!

46
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,923
She was trying to deal heroin.

47
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,926
Amateur. Didn't know what
she was getting involved in.

48
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:11,262
Selling stuff to anyone. No wonder
Shanghai Riuman was watching her.

49
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:14,328
Serves her right if you ask me.

50
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,870
Of course I wanted to look after her.

51
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,304
But things're hard enough already.

52
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,839
Would you help me out?

53
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,074
Would you please?

54
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:20,808
I'm begging you.

55
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:21,297
Please.

56
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,004
You're not the only one having
a hard time.

57
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,578
If she's too much of a nuisance,

58
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,082
you can do what you like with her.

59
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,185
Yeah, Yeah.

60
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:42,753
What's your name?

61
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:49,931
Y-o-u-r n-a-m-e?

62
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,773
I asked you a question!

63
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,369
I don't have one.

64
00:07:58,946 --> 00:07:59,970
Bull shit!

65
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:01,879
Everybody has a name.

66
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,885
You really don't have one?

67
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,095
A pack of cigarettes costs 250 yen.

68
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,586
A pack a day, that's 7,500 yen
a month.

69
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:24,100
My old man's a farmer.
He makes 400 yuan a month.

70
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,907
If a yuan is worth 12 yen
then that's 4800 yen.

71
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,806
He couldn't even afford cigarettes.

72
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:34,972
I never manage to save much.

73
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,044
I never manage to save anything.

74
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,186
Saving money's so hard.

75
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,347
At this rate I'll never get home.

76
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,824
How many do you do in a night?

77
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,526
It's been really slow lately.

78
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,328
Economy's bad, what can we do.

79
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,762
I'm getting cobwebs in my pussy.

80
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:54,860
I came up with this great game.

81
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:58,132
I bet my customers they can't last.

82
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:01,742
If they come under 10 minutes, I win.

83
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,812
If they last longer, they win.
10 minutes. Sounds easy, huh?

84
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:08,339
Of course they all think they can last.
If I win, I double the price.

85
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:12,987
They win-they get a free trick.
If they come really quick- I triple it!

86
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,113
What do you think?

87
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,246
Great if they're quick-shooters.

88
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:22,253
I learned a trick from this
quack doctor.

89
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:26,533
There's a spot between their ass
and their balls.

90
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,694
Oh god, it works fucking great.

91
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,739
I brought you something.

92
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,366
You shouldn't have.

93
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:35,533
It was given to me anyway.

94
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,734
Hang on, it's downstairs.

95
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:41,882
I wonder what it is?

96
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:42,541
Is it big?

97
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,209
What's your name?

98
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,016
Mine's Glico.

99
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,556
Glico. Weird name huh?

100
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,657
Do you know what Glico is?

101
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,722
It's a kind of candy.

102
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:01,827
Japanese businessmen grow up
sucking on Glico.

103
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,605
Wonder what she's bringing me?

104
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,210
Are you Shizuko's sister?

105
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,510
I don't speak Chinese.

106
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,378
No Chinese?

107
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,417
You-are-Shizuko's-sister?

108
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,019
Then who are you?

109
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,663
You're so cute.

110
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,267
What's your name?

111
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,534
Doesn't have one, she says.

112
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,444
Call her anything you want.

113
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:53,084
Is that all?

114
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,924
Everyone has to get by
on their own.

115
00:10:56,924 --> 00:11:00,587
Work hard so you get out'a
here soon

116
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:02,353
Shall we go?

117
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:05,956
Done this before?

118
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:07,993
Obviously not.

119
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,040
Something like this.

120
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,012
This would look great on you.

121
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,110
Look in the mirror.

122
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:32,718
I used to be a school teacher.

123
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,493
I was pretty good at teaching.

124
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:38,365
You can call me "teach"
Go ahead, say it.

125
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,093
Hey!

126
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,833
What, forget something?

127
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,967
I changed my mind
it isn't enough.

128
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:45,703
What?

129
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,833
I want more.

130
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,509
That's all I've got.

131
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:52,909
Then forget it.

132
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,976
Alright another 10,000.

133
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,187
How about 30? Wait! 30,000!

134
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:03,891
He said he's gonna pay.

135
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:04,758
Huh?

136
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:05,959
That man...

137
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,359
What? I didn't hear him.

138
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,561
That place is a shit hole.

139
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,557
Never let yourself go cheap.

140
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,137
I'm sorry.

141
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:51,629
Looking at this?

142
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:53,401
Butterfly?

143
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,239
You like butterflies?

144
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,041
Not really.

145
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,041
Japanese call these "Ageha"
...these butterflies.

146
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:04,475
I came here with my two older
brothers.

147
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,520
Ranki and Rankai.

148
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,820
We planned to save some cash
and go home.

149
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,528
Wasn't so easy.
We couldn't find work.

150
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:22,792
For a while we scavenged,
lived like rats.

151
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,834
We used to purse-snatch
downtown.

152
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:33,379
Ranki would rip them off,
throw to Rankai.

153
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:39,520
Rankai would run like hell.

154
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,512
He'd dump it all in a trash can
somewhere.

155
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,784
My job was to pick it up.

156
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,154
We made a little money.

157
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,092
But then one day.

158
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:56,234
Rankai was running with the stuff

159
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,601
and he got whacked by a car.

160
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,299
Dead before he hit the ground.

161
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,167
Split his head right open.

162
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,378
Then it got all crazy.

163
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:14,776
Ranki and I tried to reach him but
there was a huge crowd of people.

164
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:21,918
There was an ambulance and
a guy in a white coat yelling.

165
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:28,835
I guess he was trying to find out
if anyone knew Rankai.

166
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:34,899
We didn't know any Japanese
so we couldn't understand him.

167
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:40,244
Ranki and I tried to figure out
what to do.

168
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,181
Then the ambulance was gone

169
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,242
and that was it.

170
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:49,686
Still don't know what
happened to him.

171
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,422
Probably took him to the hospital.

172
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:58,794
He was just another 'Yentown'
no name, no nationality,

173
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,331
one more unidentified body.

174
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:05,999
It'll be the same for me when I die.

175
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,137
It's the same for all 'Yentowns'.

176
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,101
That's why I got this tattoo.

177
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,807
If I die this'll tell 'em who I am.

178
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,774
Kind of like an ID card.

179
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:19,550
Want one?

180
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,617
What about your other brother?

181
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:32,424
He's probably scratching
around somewhere.

182
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,660
You're still a kid so
you get a caterpillar.

183
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,072
There we are.

184
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:44,301
"Ageha"

185
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,045
Yep, it's your name.

186
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,248
<i>"AGEHA"</i>

187
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:14,806
Oh shit!

188
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:20,544
<i>"AUTO EXPERT"</i>

189
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:48,037
Fei-Hong!

190
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:51,352
What's up?

191
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:23,849
There you are.

192
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:26,016
Thank you very much.

193
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:56,007
Where did you pick this one up?

194
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:00,084
You're adorable.

195
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,153
What's your name?

196
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:04,918
She doesn't speak Chinese.

197
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:08,026
N-a-m-e.

198
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:21,909
How much do you want?

199
00:21:03,711 --> 00:21:08,239
God created all men equal

200
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:03,120
It's time to go.

201
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:38,824
"Oh Glico, sunshine of our heart
who's are you tonight

202
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,461
our Yentown madonna"

203
00:24:43,097 --> 00:24:46,794
Italian folk songs and
Chinese wine don't mix.

204
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,656
Got a towel?

205
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:29,693
Isn't there one there?

206
00:31:30,562 --> 00:31:32,052
Oh yeah...

207
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:08,860
What are you doing in here?

208
00:32:12,404 --> 00:32:15,168
The music's too loud.

209
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:19,805
I guess you're starting alone.

210
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:22,007
What are you doing?

211
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:23,771
It's OK I'll pay.

212
00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:26,084
This one's different.

213
00:32:26,084 --> 00:32:27,686
I said I'll pay.

214
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:29,745
I'm gonna call the cops!

215
00:32:29,988 --> 00:32:33,924
The cops... oh yeah?

216
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:35,925
Call the cops, huh?

217
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,565
Now try and call them!

218
00:32:46,905 --> 00:32:47,963
SALUTE!

219
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,098
Think you can?

220
00:32:57,716 --> 00:32:59,751
You don't fucking get it do you?

221
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:02,721
A whore house is for
a good time, right?

222
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:03,915
Am I right?

223
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:08,022
Goddamn it, sit down.

224
00:33:16,234 --> 00:33:18,069
Get over here and listen to me.

225
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:19,001
You too!

226
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:25,405
Go and get Arrow!

227
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:28,296
He's all squash.

228
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:11,941
Sing what?

229
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:22,723
Sing something!

230
00:37:23,163 --> 00:37:23,891
What?

231
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:26,023
Sing something happy.

232
00:39:02,462 --> 00:39:04,987
Sudo's disappeared?

233
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:08,701
We've been out of contact
for a week.

234
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:10,100
And our little item?

235
00:39:11,037 --> 00:39:12,438
THE FUCKING TAPE!

236
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:15,041
It vanished along with Sudo.

237
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,065
What did you say?!

238
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:19,339
We are undertaking
a thorough search.

239
00:39:20,213 --> 00:39:22,704
I can't sit around listening to this.

240
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,348
Why the hell are you still here?!

241
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:30,613
Goodness! Going home already?

242
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:34,460
Mr. Chairman this is from
the manager.

243
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,485
At least have a taste
before you go.

244
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,397
Who the hell are you?!

245
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:42,635
Mr. Chairman!

246
00:39:50,777 --> 00:39:52,212
Oops, pardon me.

247
00:39:52,212 --> 00:39:53,236
Son-of-a-bitch.

248
00:39:53,413 --> 00:39:55,381
It's all on the house.

249
00:39:58,484 --> 00:40:01,214
Put your gun away so we can talk.

250
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:03,623
Can't you hear me, "TAKO"!

251
00:40:03,623 --> 00:40:07,753
Mao Foo, he's scary.
Shall I pop him?

252
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:09,853
No hurry, Wan.

253
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:15,401
Rio Ranki!

254
00:40:19,038 --> 00:40:20,972
Hello, Mr. Bigshot.

255
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:23,733
So where has the rat
hidden himself?

256
00:40:23,977 --> 00:40:27,811
I thought Rio Ranki was
a gentleman.

257
00:40:28,448 --> 00:40:30,177
Don't give me that crap
you faithless fuck!

258
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:31,145
What?

259
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:35,353
The tape... the TAPE..."My Way".

260
00:40:35,555 --> 00:40:36,749
What are you talking about?

261
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,987
You've got to be kidding.

262
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:42,158
How come you don't know
"My Way"?

263
00:40:42,395 --> 00:40:45,131
It's worth a fortune to a collector.

264
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:45,765
What?

265
00:40:45,765 --> 00:40:48,097
OK? I want it back!

266
00:40:50,904 --> 00:40:54,772
Let's see your stomach
you fucking kangaroo!

267
00:40:54,974 --> 00:40:58,102
Oh Mao Foo, I forgot my gun!

268
00:40:58,478 --> 00:41:01,174
So, now it's two against four.

269
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:04,517
We're in big trouble Mao Foo!

270
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:08,749
Four minus two equals
two survivors, right?!

271
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:10,023
Listen Ranki.

272
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:12,592
So, two will be left standing.

273
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:17,359
Who wants to live? You, big shot?

274
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,831
You're fucking insane!

275
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:20,128
So how do we decide?

276
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:23,461
Scissor, paper, stone?

277
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:32,111
Say, I'm sorry but there's no
sense in having it out here.

278
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:35,882
Ranki, how about we make
a deal?

279
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:39,841
I don't deal with scum...

280
00:41:47,193 --> 00:41:50,685
Why didn't you blow me away?

281
00:41:50,797 --> 00:41:52,560
You think this is a microphone?

282
00:41:54,434 --> 00:41:58,165
Or maybe it's a hair dryer?

283
00:42:25,331 --> 00:42:27,959
Sudo has the tape.

284
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:34,064
I can't find him.
That's why I'm here.

285
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,443
Where is Sudo?

286
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,442
Where?!

287
00:42:43,649 --> 00:42:45,879
We are looking for him.

288
00:42:46,085 --> 00:42:47,450
What?

289
00:42:48,488 --> 00:42:49,921
He ain't here!

290
00:42:50,156 --> 00:42:51,748
He's been missing for a week.

291
00:42:52,225 --> 00:42:54,794
He's split, gone, on the run.

292
00:42:54,794 --> 00:42:57,130
When we find him, he's a dead man.

293
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:58,654
Lying sack of shit.

294
00:42:58,931 --> 00:43:00,099
You can do better.

295
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:01,760
It's the truth.

296
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:03,770
We were just talking about it.

297
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:07,440
Kumicho, lying's no good.

298
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,964
It's the truth.

299
00:43:09,675 --> 00:43:14,339
Let's try again, who took the tape?

300
00:43:14,614 --> 00:43:15,740
Sudo.

301
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,108
Who gave the order?

302
00:43:23,456 --> 00:43:26,016
Wan, get a bucket.

303
00:43:26,325 --> 00:43:29,522
We're going to have a blood flood.

304
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,531
I did.

305
00:43:38,004 --> 00:43:38,936
You did.

306
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:42,333
That's better.

307
00:43:44,744 --> 00:43:47,440
Now where's Sudo?

308
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,106
I don't know.

309
00:43:54,187 --> 00:43:56,155
Liars go to hell you know.

310
00:43:56,823 --> 00:43:58,391
Into the fire, into the flame.

311
00:43:58,391 --> 00:43:59,892
Please don't.

312
00:43:59,892 --> 00:44:01,257
It's the truth!

313
00:44:03,663 --> 00:44:05,528
Here comes the bucket.

314
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:08,500
Chop his head off.

315
00:44:08,835 --> 00:44:10,769
It's the truth!!

316
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,536
Good boy, Kumicho.

317
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,834
Honesty brings salvation.

318
00:44:22,615 --> 00:44:23,416
Chop his head off.

319
00:44:23,416 --> 00:44:24,906
But it's true!!

320
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,693
He used to pick up Yentown
hookers around here.

321
00:44:33,693 --> 00:44:35,628
This is a perfect place to hide.

322
00:44:35,628 --> 00:44:36,652
Come with me.

323
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:38,226
I'm cheap.

324
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:44,233
Don't get many 'Yentowns'
in here.

325
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,997
He's not my type.

326
00:44:49,442 --> 00:44:50,909
Never seen him before.

327
00:45:21,073 --> 00:45:22,233
Here, buy yourself a hit.

328
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:26,544
He was all squashed!

329
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,396
Goddamn kids!

330
00:47:27,266 --> 00:47:28,858
10,000 yen please.

331
00:49:17,267 --> 00:49:19,436
Your looking at Sudo Kanji.

332
00:49:19,436 --> 00:49:22,772
He is, or should I say was
a main man

333
00:49:22,772 --> 00:49:24,607
in Katsushika Syndicate.

334
00:49:24,607 --> 00:49:26,802
About a week ago
Sudo disappeared

335
00:49:26,943 --> 00:49:29,679
and the "family" put on
a frantic search for him.

336
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,409
But now, the strange thing is
the whole gang itself has perished.

337
00:49:33,817 --> 00:49:35,614
Gone, they're history.

338
00:49:36,152 --> 00:49:36,914
What do you mean?

339
00:49:37,086 --> 00:49:40,089
Kumicho and all the other
key people are missing.

340
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:43,422
Organized crime just can't work
without someone to organize it.

341
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,066
Now, here are your buddies!

342
00:49:50,066 --> 00:49:52,302
Wan Shaun Shen and Mao Foo...

343
00:49:52,302 --> 00:49:53,633
They're Shanghai Riuman.

344
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:56,005
You know, Chinese Mafia.

345
00:49:56,005 --> 00:49:59,309
Mao Foo's one cold blooded
mother fucker

346
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:01,971
or as they say
"a frozen face killer".

347
00:50:02,178 --> 00:50:06,012
For some reason they too have
been sniffing around after Sudo.

348
00:50:06,249 --> 00:50:07,477
Why, Ran?

349
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:09,509
I thought I'd ask you to find out.

350
00:50:09,652 --> 00:50:13,323
And their leader, "Rio Ranki"!

351
00:50:13,323 --> 00:50:14,257
He's at the top.

352
00:50:14,257 --> 00:50:16,092
I'm talking "RIUMAN KING".

353
00:50:16,092 --> 00:50:18,720
Sitting pretty on his
beautiful Yen Town throne.

354
00:50:19,062 --> 00:50:20,620
He looks pretty young to be...

355
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:22,932
He's only 28.

356
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:26,135
He was a punk selling "hot" cards
and worked his way up.

357
00:50:26,135 --> 00:50:28,938
Before long people were
calling him "The Forger".

358
00:50:28,938 --> 00:50:30,840
Rumor has it he is already, or

359
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,409
is planning on counterfeiting
Fukazawa notes...

360
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:36,401
I'm sure he's going to be called
"The Counterfeiting King".

361
00:50:37,146 --> 00:50:41,549
So Ran, why are you so
interested?

362
00:50:42,685 --> 00:50:43,515
I'm not.

363
00:55:07,049 --> 00:55:09,142
These are the counterfeit notes.

364
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:12,886
In the city we've found nearly
10,000 in a matter of days.

365
00:55:15,024 --> 00:55:16,787
Looks amateurish.

366
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,028
Actually it isn't.

367
00:55:19,028 --> 00:55:20,518
Take a look at this.

368
00:55:22,832 --> 00:55:25,164
This is the stolen magnetic data.

369
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:26,994
Rio Ranki, huh?

370
00:55:27,637 --> 00:55:31,004
Kind of crude for his M.O., isn't it?

371
00:55:45,154 --> 00:55:46,348
<i>"Thousands of counterfeit bills</i>
<i>appear throughout city"</i>

372
00:56:22,024 --> 00:56:23,616
Oh, my god.

373
00:56:25,194 --> 00:56:27,025
What a piece of junk!

374
00:56:41,153 --> 00:56:42,882
This whole place is ours?

375
00:56:43,122 --> 00:56:45,658
I don't have many properties
like this.

376
00:56:45,658 --> 00:56:47,226
You were lucky.

377
00:56:47,226 --> 00:56:50,429
You'll need a dummy owner.

378
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:52,898
Yentowns aren't allowed to
make contracts.

379
00:56:52,898 --> 00:56:55,000
Owner? He's gotta be Japanese?

380
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,400
It's OK we'll find someone.

381
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:01,140
Now, about the staff...

382
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,474
Pick the ones you like.

383
00:57:02,474 --> 00:57:04,143
They can start anytime.

384
00:57:04,143 --> 00:57:06,202
It's not going to be
that kind of place.

385
00:57:10,482 --> 00:57:13,315
Glico, stand here for a second.

386
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,811
Over here, right here.

387
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:20,086
What for?

388
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:22,927
You want me to be a stripper?

389
00:57:24,196 --> 00:57:25,288
How's this?

390
00:57:26,365 --> 00:57:27,093
Sing something.

391
00:57:35,974 --> 00:57:38,534
Soon you can sing all you want.

392
00:57:39,678 --> 00:57:42,881
We're opening a club.

393
00:57:42,881 --> 00:57:44,041
Your place.

394
00:57:44,983 --> 00:57:48,009
We'll have a band, a lot of
customers, and you'll sing.

395
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,390
They'll come to hear you.

396
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:53,459
Everyone will be talking about
this place.

397
00:57:53,459 --> 00:57:55,594
It'll be standing room only!

398
00:57:55,594 --> 00:57:57,396
Then we'll put out a CD,

399
00:57:57,396 --> 00:57:58,795
it'll be a big hit

400
00:57:59,031 --> 00:58:00,065
and a star is born!

401
00:58:00,065 --> 00:58:02,226
You'll be the hottest singer
in Japan.

402
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:04,264
What do you think, great huh?!

403
00:58:04,937 --> 00:58:06,131
I think you're full of shit.

404
00:58:07,806 --> 00:58:11,742
Frankly, it's very rare for a live
venue to go into profit.

405
00:58:11,977 --> 00:58:13,979
Make it a girlie bar.

406
00:58:13,979 --> 00:58:16,709
Why don't you get up here
and sing.

407
00:58:17,015 --> 00:58:18,083
They don't want me.

408
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:19,710
They don't want me either!

409
00:58:20,919 --> 00:58:22,250
What's so funny?

410
00:58:22,755 --> 00:58:25,557
Definitely a live music club.

411
00:58:25,557 --> 00:58:26,819
Not a goddamn girlie bar.

412
00:58:27,392 --> 00:58:30,850
If you want singing
have a Karaoke bar.

413
00:58:31,363 --> 00:58:33,098
Mr. Fei-Hong may have a point.

414
00:58:33,098 --> 00:58:34,087
Butt out!

415
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:38,965
A legit club could be a useful front.

416
00:58:39,438 --> 00:58:42,373
Front, back, whatever.
It's a straight live music club!

417
00:58:44,643 --> 00:58:47,840
That kind of life is behind us now.

418
00:59:14,807 --> 00:59:16,672
Great, fantastic, you're hired!

419
00:59:28,754 --> 00:59:29,550
Name?

420
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:31,023
Betty.

421
00:59:31,023 --> 00:59:31,853
Real name?

422
00:59:32,224 --> 00:59:33,919
Ikeda Yoshiko.

423
00:59:34,026 --> 00:59:35,288
How long have you been doing this?

424
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,620
It's my first time.

425
00:59:36,728 --> 00:59:39,424
Yeah right, Betty.

426
00:59:43,202 --> 00:59:43,964
Experienced?

427
00:59:44,403 --> 00:59:45,301
Not very.

428
00:59:45,437 --> 00:59:46,369
How old are you?

429
00:59:46,939 --> 00:59:48,167
Not very.

430
00:59:48,407 --> 00:59:50,500
I asked you, how old you are!

431
00:59:51,243 --> 00:59:52,073
Twenty-three.

432
00:59:52,578 --> 00:59:53,340
Liar...

433
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,686
What is your name?

434
01:00:10,696 --> 01:00:12,220
Asakawa.

435
01:00:13,098 --> 01:00:13,996
Your instrument?

436
01:00:14,266 --> 01:00:17,258
I'm supposed to be the owner.

437
01:00:25,878 --> 01:00:28,847
Very impressive!

438
01:00:32,084 --> 01:00:34,746
Here's the paperwork.

439
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,248
All under Asakawa's name,
just a formality.

440
01:00:38,357 --> 01:00:41,326
If the whole thing goes under,

441
01:00:41,326 --> 01:00:44,352
his life is insured up to
one million yen.

442
01:00:44,496 --> 01:00:45,588
Oh, he's an insurance agent?

443
01:00:46,064 --> 01:00:48,600
So if the venture folds...

444
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,761
We're not even open yet.

445
01:00:50,869 --> 01:00:56,466
But just in case he dies
you collect on the insurance.

446
01:00:56,975 --> 01:00:58,567
Where did you get this guy?

447
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:02,737
Too many bad debts
he had to sell himself.

448
01:01:03,015 --> 01:01:03,811
We're talking about you.

449
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:05,208
Did you buy him?

450
01:01:05,918 --> 01:01:06,714
A huh.

451
01:01:07,252 --> 01:01:10,653
We'll take care of any killing
so don't you worry about it.

452
01:01:10,856 --> 01:01:13,757
Our deal is off if they find out.

453
01:01:14,293 --> 01:01:16,887
We're talking about you.

454
01:01:46,858 --> 01:01:49,528
You guys are Yentowns, right?

455
01:01:49,528 --> 01:01:53,259
Yentown has its own soul, right?

456
01:01:53,532 --> 01:01:56,797
How can Jap musicians play
Yentown soul?

457
01:01:59,538 --> 01:02:01,563
That's right, I'm not.

458
01:02:01,974 --> 01:02:06,378
Both my parents were American,
but I was born and raised in Japan.

459
01:02:06,378 --> 01:02:09,681
Thanks to the shitty Japanese
education system.

460
01:02:09,681 --> 01:02:12,616
I can't speak a word of English.

461
01:02:16,722 --> 01:02:18,991
Funny? Well, it is funny.

462
01:02:18,991 --> 01:02:21,226
So what am I,
American or Japanese?

463
01:02:21,226 --> 01:02:24,262
The way I look I always get treated
like a foreigner.

464
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:28,858
The fact is I was born
and raised here

465
01:02:29,668 --> 01:02:31,568
and nowhere else is home.

466
01:02:31,703 --> 01:02:34,831
From the cradle to the grave
I'll sleep on 'TATAMI'.

467
01:02:35,073 --> 01:02:37,940
It's OK for you guys.
You've got a country to go back to.

468
01:02:39,077 --> 01:02:41,980
Yentowns have their own countries.

469
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,208
How about you, sweetheart?

470
01:02:43,348 --> 01:02:44,781
Where were you born? China?

471
01:02:45,117 --> 01:02:45,981
Japan.

472
01:02:46,418 --> 01:02:47,749
So you think you're Yentown?

473
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:48,577
Yes.

474
01:02:49,354 --> 01:02:51,089
No, you're not.

475
01:02:51,089 --> 01:02:54,183
Did you come here
to make money?

476
01:02:54,993 --> 01:02:58,793
You're second generation,
but the Japs don't care.

477
01:02:59,264 --> 01:03:02,134
You're just another Yentown.

478
01:03:02,134 --> 01:03:03,226
Strange, isn't it?

479
01:03:03,668 --> 01:03:04,396
So...

480
01:03:04,569 --> 01:03:11,168
There should be a special
name for us.

481
01:03:12,144 --> 01:03:14,579
And I came up with one.

482
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:15,546
Wanna hear it?

483
01:03:20,552 --> 01:03:22,782
"Third Culture Kids"

484
01:03:24,823 --> 01:03:25,847
Good, isn't it?

485
01:03:25,957 --> 01:03:27,292
And our music is called,

486
01:03:27,292 --> 01:03:30,022
"Third Culture Music"

487
01:03:36,902 --> 01:03:37,800
Your instrument?

488
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:39,928
I don't play an instrument.

489
01:03:49,114 --> 01:03:50,715
He said "Why are you here?"

490
01:03:50,715 --> 01:03:52,150
"Why am I here?"

491
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:53,185
Well,

492
01:03:53,185 --> 01:03:54,052
you could say...

493
01:03:54,052 --> 01:03:56,111
I'm a supervisor.

494
01:03:58,757 --> 01:04:00,959
It's OK, just leave it to me.

495
01:04:00,959 --> 01:04:03,257
I'll get you the best!

496
01:04:20,245 --> 01:04:22,236
Just like the real thing!

497
01:04:23,582 --> 01:04:24,844
Why don't you sing something.

498
01:04:25,183 --> 01:04:25,945
Go on!

499
01:04:27,452 --> 01:04:29,613
Wait, hold it.

500
01:04:30,255 --> 01:04:31,022
Time out!

501
01:04:31,022 --> 01:04:34,185
Let's ask our madonna to sing!

502
01:04:34,292 --> 01:04:35,452
No way!!

503
01:04:43,235 --> 01:04:46,671
Come on up, what would
you like to sing?

504
01:04:46,771 --> 01:04:47,863
I can't sing.

505
01:04:54,012 --> 01:04:55,445
What, is he kidding?

506
01:04:55,547 --> 01:04:58,948
My grandfather's music.

507
01:04:59,451 --> 01:05:01,681
That music has no soul!

508
01:05:03,655 --> 01:05:07,648
Oh my God, he's really gonna do it!

509
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:26,589
Who said you could put those
up here?

510
01:09:27,362 --> 01:09:29,097
This is our turf.

511
01:09:29,097 --> 01:09:30,894
You wanna put those up,
you gotta pay.

512
01:09:31,032 --> 01:09:31,930
No

513
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,700
You think I won't hit a girl.

514
01:09:37,205 --> 01:09:40,106
I'm gonna kick your ass!

515
01:09:43,411 --> 01:09:45,402
Told you I'm not messin' around.

516
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:47,682
Get up.

517
01:09:47,849 --> 01:09:49,077
Come on.

518
01:09:51,186 --> 01:09:52,676
Come on. Come on.

519
01:09:58,393 --> 01:10:00,190
Are you OK?

520
01:10:00,295 --> 01:10:01,728
Come on.

521
01:13:04,345 --> 01:13:05,903
How about "Al-Nothi"
(All or Nothing)?

522
01:13:06,848 --> 01:13:09,783
You know "Fre-Flo"
(Free Flower)?

523
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,371
"DORE-SECU"

524
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:14,138
Dream Security.

525
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,488
Mr. Kusunoki of Mash Records.

526
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:22,323
Good afternoon.

527
01:14:22,323 --> 01:14:24,655
And Ms. Hoshino of Popland Music.

528
01:14:26,594 --> 01:14:29,324
We heard your demo, it's not bad.

529
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:34,259
Where are you from?

530
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:36,971
Shanghai, China.

531
01:14:36,971 --> 01:14:39,531
Difficult to sell foreigners in Japan.

532
01:14:40,408 --> 01:14:41,932
Do you know Agnes Chan?

533
01:14:43,077 --> 01:14:45,204
We used to have a band together.

534
01:14:46,681 --> 01:14:47,807
How about Theresa Ten?

535
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,377
God rest her soul.

536
01:14:52,086 --> 01:14:54,247
That's about it for foreign singers.

537
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:58,285
Would you become Japanese?

538
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,087
That would be an easier sell.

539
01:15:01,429 --> 01:15:03,522
That's a bit tricky.

540
01:15:03,698 --> 01:15:07,566
The policy of the 'Yen Town Band'
is kind of...

541
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:10,038
different from Japanese er...

542
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:11,369
The soul... is... is

543
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,541
Doesn't sound hip to me.

544
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:14,309
Hip?

545
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:16,834
There's no 'hip' in rock'n' roll.

546
01:15:17,445 --> 01:15:18,742
Do you have a visa?

547
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:21,139
Do you?

548
01:15:21,382 --> 01:15:24,909
You can tell the truth
we're not the police.

549
01:15:26,254 --> 01:15:27,555
I don't have one.

550
01:15:27,555 --> 01:15:28,852
What do you think?

551
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:31,384
We can make it work.

552
01:15:34,662 --> 01:15:36,497
What're they saying?

553
01:15:36,497 --> 01:15:39,591
Quit being Chinese become a Jap.

554
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:43,094
Otherwise I'II never sell.

555
01:16:10,298 --> 01:16:13,199
How will I take a piss
when I'm a star?

556
01:16:13,434 --> 01:16:14,924
What do you mean?

557
01:16:15,136 --> 01:16:16,967
Will it be different?

558
01:16:18,539 --> 01:16:20,564
You'll do it the same as you do now.

559
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:26,973
How about sex?

560
01:16:32,186 --> 01:16:33,778
Will it be OK to have sex?

561
01:16:40,461 --> 01:16:43,794
I think I'm gonna come.

562
01:16:45,633 --> 01:16:46,301
Really?!

563
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:47,563
Almost.

564
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:55,774
I'm sorry.

565
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:58,442
Fly,

566
01:17:02,483 --> 01:17:03,450
Fly, fly.

567
01:17:45,526 --> 01:17:46,754
A visitor!

568
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:58,263
Wait, you little fuck!

569
01:18:03,144 --> 01:18:03,838
Wait!

570
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:04,809
Stop!

571
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,209
Stop or I'll shoot!

572
01:18:28,569 --> 01:18:30,298
I feel a little guilty.

573
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:36,165
Well, no he was just kinda cute.

574
01:19:48,842 --> 01:19:50,605
Made these yourself?

575
01:19:51,645 --> 01:19:53,510
You're gonna make a good wife.

576
01:19:58,585 --> 01:19:59,711
Yesterday,

577
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:04,216
me, David and others went...

578
01:20:07,127 --> 01:20:08,424
record shop.

579
01:20:11,231 --> 01:20:14,530
We went to a record shop

580
01:20:14,634 --> 01:20:15,862
and then...

581
01:20:17,838 --> 01:20:21,797
we think to buy one CD each,

582
01:20:23,243 --> 01:20:24,578
but no CDs there,

583
01:20:24,578 --> 01:20:26,307
then we went to another shop,

584
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:31,042
but no CDs there either,

585
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:41,727
another man came into shop
and said...

586
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:46,661
"Shanghai Baby" please.

587
01:20:47,601 --> 01:20:48,966
"What" please?

588
01:20:49,503 --> 01:20:54,736
"Shanghai Baby"
The name of Glico's single.

589
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:58,577
The man in the shop said...

590
01:21:06,052 --> 01:21:07,246
<i>"Mai Wan La"</i>

591
01:21:07,354 --> 01:21:08,116
<i>"Mai Wan La"</i>

592
01:21:09,789 --> 01:21:10,949
<i>"Mai Wan La"?</i>

593
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,528
Really? Amazing!

594
01:21:14,528 --> 01:21:15,927
The customer said...

595
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,094
Sold out.

596
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:24,937
Sold out...

597
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:35,045
These are good sandwiches.

598
01:21:35,982 --> 01:21:38,746
I'll make them for you again.

599
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:04,902
What?

600
01:23:17,984 --> 01:23:20,418
Hey! Check it out!

601
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,244
You gotta see this!

602
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:24,188
What?

603
01:23:36,169 --> 01:23:37,295
What is it?

604
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:46,035
Chai found something!

605
01:23:46,413 --> 01:23:47,505
What?

606
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:49,114
Let's check it out.

607
01:24:03,396 --> 01:24:04,624
Is it real?

608
01:24:25,425 --> 01:24:26,693
Here, just a little.

609
01:24:26,693 --> 01:24:27,528
No way!

610
01:24:27,528 --> 01:24:28,362
But I found it, why me?!

611
01:24:28,362 --> 01:24:30,564
Because you found it.

612
01:24:30,564 --> 01:24:32,088
Stop it! All of you!

613
01:24:32,499 --> 01:24:33,796
He doesn't want to do it.

614
01:24:35,068 --> 01:24:36,467
Why don't you do it yourself?

615
01:24:37,037 --> 01:24:38,436
Me? I'm not... I...

616
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:39,773
Are you scared?

617
01:24:39,773 --> 01:24:41,341
I'm not scared.

618
01:24:41,341 --> 01:24:42,365
Do it then, wimp.

619
01:24:44,611 --> 01:24:45,942
Be a man.

620
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:48,811
You better not...

621
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:00,456
Feel anything?

622
01:25:01,094 --> 01:25:02,322
Nothing at all.

623
01:25:13,707 --> 01:25:15,140
Stop!

624
01:25:15,742 --> 01:25:17,004
Help!

625
01:25:17,911 --> 01:25:19,970
Help us please!

626
01:25:21,315 --> 01:25:23,476
Fucking kids, get out of the way!

627
01:25:25,919 --> 01:25:27,580
What's all this? Stop a minute.

628
01:25:29,089 --> 01:25:30,090
Help us!

629
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:30,715
Please help...

630
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:34,661
Rio Ranki!

631
01:25:34,661 --> 01:25:35,855
It's him!

632
01:25:38,932 --> 01:25:39,694
Over there.

633
01:25:44,705 --> 01:25:45,694
In here Mr. Ranki.

634
01:25:50,944 --> 01:25:52,912
We melted this... and a needle...

635
01:26:09,396 --> 01:26:10,727
What's going on Boss?

636
01:26:11,365 --> 01:26:12,423
Get to the hospital!

637
01:27:20,901 --> 01:27:21,868
It's a fad.

638
01:27:38,218 --> 01:27:41,710
I came here with
my brother and sister,

639
01:27:42,956 --> 01:27:45,925
you know, make some quick cash
and cut out.

640
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:52,162
My brother bought it in a car crash

641
01:27:52,999 --> 01:27:55,433
and I lost track of my sister.

642
01:27:56,837 --> 01:27:59,067
So... it's been years.

643
01:28:01,108 --> 01:28:06,171
When we first got here we had to
think up Japanese names

644
01:28:07,314 --> 01:28:09,839
called ourselves the "YAOHANS".

645
01:28:12,919 --> 01:28:14,614
I was "TOYOTA YAOHAN".

646
01:28:15,422 --> 01:28:19,324
Rankai, my little brother
he was "HITACHI".

647
01:28:23,663 --> 01:28:26,325
Only Japanese words we knew,

648
01:28:31,071 --> 01:28:36,532
my little sister Shaod'ei
I named Glico.

649
01:28:40,614 --> 01:28:42,411
I named Glico.

650
01:28:44,551 --> 01:28:47,714
Shaod'ei was such a
little ball of energy.

651
01:28:51,224 --> 01:28:53,317
You know that Japanese candy?

652
01:28:55,796 --> 01:29:01,393
Japanese businessmen grow up
sucking on Glico.

653
01:29:10,343 --> 01:29:11,640
That's Opium Street.

654
01:29:11,878 --> 01:29:12,867
Opium Street?

655
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:14,376
Have you ever been there?

656
01:29:14,748 --> 01:29:15,442
You're kidding.

657
01:29:16,917 --> 01:29:19,545
Pushers, mafia, dealers
everywhere... no way.

658
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,821
Even the cops won't go there.

659
01:29:24,624 --> 01:29:27,092
He's so cool! Rio Ranki.

660
01:29:31,331 --> 01:29:33,265
Amphetamines was it?

661
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:34,398
I don't understand.

662
01:29:39,539 --> 01:29:45,637
No larceny, no assault, no drug
offenses, looks clean to me.

663
01:29:47,347 --> 01:29:47,938
Shanghai?

664
01:29:49,783 --> 01:29:52,519
That's about 80,000 one-way now.

665
01:29:52,519 --> 01:29:53,315
Got any money?

666
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:54,748
No.

667
01:29:54,921 --> 01:29:56,356
Get some.

668
01:29:56,356 --> 01:29:57,152
Where from?

669
01:29:57,624 --> 01:29:59,091
Home.

670
01:30:02,295 --> 01:30:03,353
Go on then!

671
01:30:04,498 --> 01:30:05,760
Go home?

672
01:30:05,866 --> 01:30:07,925
Clear out! Lots of people are waiting.

673
01:30:08,668 --> 01:30:09,965
Get out! Go!

674
01:30:10,737 --> 01:30:11,999
Get the fuck out of here!

675
01:30:15,976 --> 01:30:17,603
Number 6-2-9

676
01:30:19,045 --> 01:30:20,910
Un-fucking-believable!

677
01:31:00,954 --> 01:31:02,046
Ageha!

678
01:31:03,223 --> 01:31:04,383
He's back!

679
01:31:04,491 --> 01:31:05,583
Mr. Fei-Hong.

680
01:32:21,901 --> 01:32:23,698
Afternoon!

681
01:32:25,505 --> 01:32:27,040
Grumpy bitch.

682
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,439
You got PMS or something?

683
01:32:28,675 --> 01:32:30,540
Hey there!

684
01:32:34,014 --> 01:32:35,582
What's going on?

685
01:32:35,582 --> 01:32:38,176
Desperate for cash?
You piece of shit.

686
01:32:39,285 --> 01:32:40,650
Blackmailing the manager?

687
01:32:41,921 --> 01:32:42,856
Calm down!

688
01:32:42,856 --> 01:32:43,823
Stay out of it!

689
01:32:43,823 --> 01:32:46,314
Quit with the fucking English!

690
01:32:46,493 --> 01:32:48,859
Somebody translate this.

691
01:32:48,962 --> 01:32:49,529
We quit.

692
01:32:49,529 --> 01:32:51,965
What is this?

693
01:32:51,965 --> 01:32:52,989
Fuck it.

694
01:32:53,099 --> 01:32:54,361
I've had it with this place!

695
01:32:54,534 --> 01:32:57,128
Ageha get over here and translate.

696
01:32:57,237 --> 01:33:00,138
Ageha translate.

697
01:33:01,374 --> 01:33:03,143
What's this shit?

698
01:33:03,143 --> 01:33:04,440
Give it back you punk.

699
01:33:04,544 --> 01:33:05,943
Give it here.

700
01:33:09,749 --> 01:33:11,284
It looks like a million!

701
01:33:11,284 --> 01:33:13,775
How much did you sell her for?

702
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,720
I'll fire you all!

703
01:33:21,895 --> 01:33:23,329
Out! Out! Out!

704
01:33:23,329 --> 01:33:25,593
Speak Japanese you bastard!

705
01:33:25,899 --> 01:33:27,491
Ageha tell them!

706
01:33:29,302 --> 01:33:30,360
They say they're gonna quit.

707
01:33:31,237 --> 01:33:33,603
They want to know how much
you made off Glico

708
01:33:34,307 --> 01:33:35,740
and how could you be so greedy

709
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:50,818
Tell them.

710
01:33:52,625 --> 01:33:53,523
Tell them!

711
01:33:55,929 --> 01:33:58,193
He said "Glico was a
good resource" and

712
01:33:58,431 --> 01:34:00,160
"What's wrong with making
some money?"

713
01:34:01,267 --> 01:34:03,497
He really said that?!

714
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:09,508
Typical Yentown scum.

715
01:34:11,211 --> 01:34:11,945
Everybody wait.

716
01:34:11,945 --> 01:34:13,105
It's over.

717
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,538
Wait... please...

718
01:34:31,064 --> 01:34:34,329
Good thing they got out
before it's too late.

719
01:34:35,268 --> 01:34:38,294
You've been let off
the hook this time.

720
01:34:49,215 --> 01:34:51,877
Look out! Be careful you idiot!

721
01:34:56,723 --> 01:34:57,553
Hoan!

722
01:35:00,794 --> 01:35:01,624
Hoan!

723
01:35:02,729 --> 01:35:03,627
Hey boss!

724
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:08,527
Where are we going?

725
01:35:08,768 --> 01:35:09,700
Opium Street.

726
01:35:13,673 --> 01:35:14,697
I'm not going.

727
01:35:15,608 --> 01:35:16,575
Are you scared?

728
01:35:17,577 --> 01:35:18,771
No, but...

729
01:35:20,446 --> 01:35:22,004
Why are you going there?

730
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:28,484
There's something I want.

731
01:36:31,351 --> 01:36:36,755
They're illegal, homeless,
they have nowhere else to go.

732
01:37:39,819 --> 01:37:41,548
He's dead.

733
01:38:01,507 --> 01:38:02,838
That's opium.

734
01:39:00,126 --> 01:39:01,354
Is this it?

735
01:39:04,597 --> 01:39:06,394
Medical Center?!

736
01:39:09,702 --> 01:39:12,068
"Urinary Organs,
Acupuncture & Tattoos"

737
01:39:39,865 --> 01:39:41,765
Boss, you're getting a tattoo?

738
01:39:42,968 --> 01:39:46,131
Wow! Great! Fucking great!

739
01:48:01,689 --> 01:48:04,886
Ms. Suzukino, you have a visitor.

740
01:48:05,527 --> 01:48:06,227
Where?

741
01:48:06,227 --> 01:48:07,558
In the conference room.

742
01:48:23,711 --> 01:48:25,201
I'm Suzukino.

743
01:48:27,482 --> 01:48:28,540
May I ask your name?

744
01:48:29,918 --> 01:48:31,579
Nice to meet you.

745
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:38,320
You write this column, don't you?

746
01:48:38,793 --> 01:48:39,589
That's right.

747
01:48:42,297 --> 01:48:45,130
I read it every week.

748
01:48:46,167 --> 01:48:47,896
How may I help you?

749
01:48:48,069 --> 01:48:50,799
Do you know a guy name
Sudo Kanji?

750
01:48:51,139 --> 01:48:52,333
Sudo Kanji?

751
01:48:53,675 --> 01:48:55,666
Look, this guy.

752
01:48:57,312 --> 01:48:59,303
You wrote this too, right?

753
01:48:59,881 --> 01:49:02,617
Oh yeah. Deputy of the
Katsushika syndicate.

754
01:49:02,617 --> 01:49:05,916
I saw him killed.

755
01:49:06,521 --> 01:49:07,146
What?

756
01:49:08,256 --> 01:49:10,087
Fell from a window.

757
01:49:16,097 --> 01:49:17,962
Glico's window.

758
01:49:18,433 --> 01:49:19,991
Do you know her, Glico?

759
01:49:20,168 --> 01:49:21,226
Doubt it...

760
01:49:22,203 --> 01:49:24,467
I know Glico from that
Yen Town Band.

761
01:49:24,706 --> 01:49:27,300
Oh, you do know her.

762
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:59,201
I suppose a customer
took this picture.

763
01:49:59,874 --> 01:50:01,705
She used to be a prostitute?!

764
01:50:06,214 --> 01:50:08,011
This would be quite a scandal.

765
01:50:11,319 --> 01:50:15,312
How much do I get paid?

766
01:50:21,829 --> 01:50:24,297
Can I have more?

767
01:50:31,573 --> 01:50:33,370
Thank you.

768
01:50:34,542 --> 01:50:36,203
I was lucky to get this gig.

769
01:50:38,446 --> 01:50:40,073
I'm a big fan.

770
01:50:43,851 --> 01:50:45,819
Ageha! Ageha!

771
01:51:26,628 --> 01:51:28,755
Randy Heavens from Yoga.

772
01:51:29,063 --> 01:51:30,792
Koichi from Suzugamori.

773
01:51:31,099 --> 01:51:32,623
Chu Ba Jeh from Namamugi.

774
01:51:32,734 --> 01:51:34,429
Shao Kampao from Gasu Bridge.

775
01:51:35,103 --> 01:51:36,900
Chu-Bin from Tennozu.

776
01:51:39,574 --> 01:51:42,008
They're a weird bunch, but

777
01:51:42,443 --> 01:51:44,646
they can pull it off.

778
01:51:44,646 --> 01:51:45,442
Hoan.

779
01:51:47,515 --> 01:51:48,914
Is that your woman?

780
01:51:49,951 --> 01:51:51,919
Who do you think you're talking to?

781
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,254
What do you want sweetheart?

782
01:51:54,389 --> 01:51:56,758
Strictly a business proposition.

783
01:51:56,758 --> 01:51:57,884
Business?

784
01:51:58,426 --> 01:52:01,088
I'll pay a million yen each.

785
01:52:01,195 --> 01:52:02,628
Boss that's too much!

786
01:52:02,964 --> 01:52:03,988
What's the deal?

787
01:52:05,033 --> 01:52:06,330
Listen up.

788
01:52:22,317 --> 01:52:23,784
Wow great!

789
01:52:24,018 --> 01:52:25,815
I don't believe it.

790
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:30,024
Here.

791
01:52:30,024 --> 01:52:30,786
Next.

792
01:52:36,297 --> 01:52:37,059
Here.

793
01:52:38,032 --> 01:52:38,930
Next.

794
01:52:42,937 --> 01:52:44,564
Is that all?

795
01:52:45,173 --> 01:52:46,470
Stop complaining.

796
01:52:47,542 --> 01:52:48,167
Next.

797
01:52:50,445 --> 01:52:51,813
Come on hurry up.

798
01:52:51,813 --> 01:52:54,441
They'd never know if we
pinched some.

799
01:52:54,649 --> 01:52:57,049
If they found out,
you'd be in deep shit!

800
01:52:57,285 --> 01:52:58,183
Come on.

801
01:53:01,989 --> 01:53:03,013
Hurry.

802
01:53:16,003 --> 01:53:17,027
Next.

803
01:53:17,805 --> 01:53:19,272
Is that everything?

804
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:23,838
Let's have it.

805
01:53:27,281 --> 01:53:28,182
Good job.

806
01:53:28,182 --> 01:53:30,017
Thank you very much.

807
01:53:30,017 --> 01:53:30,915
Next.

808
01:53:38,025 --> 01:53:39,925
You did well to get so many.

809
01:53:40,528 --> 01:53:42,689
It wasn't easy was it Chu-Bin?

810
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:44,488
No big deal.

811
01:53:49,971 --> 01:53:51,632
It ripped.

812
01:53:53,808 --> 01:53:55,503
What are you doing?

813
01:53:56,043 --> 01:53:57,378
It was just one...

814
01:53:57,378 --> 01:53:59,744
What do you think you're doing?

815
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:07,812
Got a problem with that?

816
01:54:21,903 --> 01:54:23,393
What the hell are you doing?

817
01:54:27,608 --> 01:54:28,233
Hello.

818
01:54:28,376 --> 01:54:30,367
Nice to see you.

819
01:54:30,511 --> 01:54:32,240
Glico's here.

820
01:54:32,346 --> 01:54:33,080
Hello.

821
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:34,911
It's great to have you here.

822
01:54:35,082 --> 01:54:36,913
Why don't you have a seat.

823
01:54:37,518 --> 01:54:40,146
Yen Town Band's so popular.

824
01:54:40,755 --> 01:54:42,154
Excuse me.

825
01:54:42,423 --> 01:54:45,017
I'd like to ask a few questions
while you get ready.

826
01:54:45,159 --> 01:54:47,127
Do you mind if I record it?

827
01:54:47,528 --> 01:54:50,759
Am I the only one who's nervous?

828
01:54:51,466 --> 01:54:54,299
New album's out on the 21st?

829
01:54:54,569 --> 01:54:56,400
OK, let's talk about that first.

830
01:54:56,637 --> 01:54:57,305
Yeah?

831
01:54:57,305 --> 01:55:00,241
Would you move the blue Porsche?

832
01:55:00,241 --> 01:55:01,299
Sure.

833
01:55:01,509 --> 01:55:02,999
Excuse me for a second.

834
01:55:11,118 --> 01:55:14,019
Oh, let me see.

835
01:55:14,489 --> 01:55:15,217
This?

836
01:55:15,857 --> 01:55:17,825
Wow! Nice tattoo.

837
01:55:18,392 --> 01:55:20,553
Suits you're image.

838
01:55:21,028 --> 01:55:23,189
Hey, it's just like this one!

839
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:26,166
This is you isn't it?

840
01:55:26,334 --> 01:55:27,028
Dunno.

841
01:55:27,134 --> 01:55:28,123
Don't know?

842
01:55:28,236 --> 01:55:29,533
But it's exactly the same.

843
01:55:37,812 --> 01:55:38,904
What is this?

844
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:40,882
I don't know what you're
talking about.

845
01:55:40,882 --> 01:55:42,440
OK. Let me put it this way.

846
01:55:44,285 --> 01:55:46,583
What did you do with Sudo's body?

847
01:55:46,888 --> 01:55:49,880
You know, the guy who fell
out of your window.

848
01:55:50,124 --> 01:55:52,922
Remember? Back when you
were a hooker.

849
01:55:53,194 --> 01:55:54,559
Look! Stop bullshiting!

850
01:55:56,931 --> 01:55:58,091
What are you doing?

851
01:55:58,299 --> 01:56:00,735
What've you got in your mouth?

852
01:56:00,735 --> 01:56:02,168
Spit that out!

853
01:56:02,336 --> 01:56:03,571
Yuk!

854
01:56:03,571 --> 01:56:06,062
Spit it out!

855
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:08,274
You can't swallow it!

856
01:56:10,645 --> 01:56:13,808
Alright. Go ahead.

857
01:56:15,349 --> 01:56:20,412
But this proves you were involved.

858
01:56:20,855 --> 01:56:23,551
You're giving yourself away.

859
01:56:24,692 --> 01:56:25,556
Aren't you?

860
01:56:27,028 --> 01:56:27,995
Get it?

861
01:56:28,262 --> 01:56:31,595
Give me back that soggy picture.

862
01:56:34,835 --> 01:56:36,393
Don't be so childish!

863
01:56:38,606 --> 01:56:39,402
She's back?!

864
01:56:40,007 --> 01:56:41,770
Meet me out back... alone.

865
01:56:43,678 --> 01:56:44,667
Excuse me.

866
01:56:45,212 --> 01:56:47,373
OK. Let's get moving.

867
01:56:47,815 --> 01:56:50,952
Sorry, I overdid it a bit.

868
01:56:50,952 --> 01:56:53,614
But I had to get you alone.

869
01:56:55,656 --> 01:56:59,558
I don't wanna print everything.

870
01:57:01,462 --> 01:57:05,193
I'm just curious about you.

871
01:57:06,667 --> 01:57:07,656
You know what I mean?

872
01:57:07,835 --> 01:57:10,827
It's my job, like singing is for you.

873
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:14,707
I don't sing because I like it.

874
01:57:15,076 --> 01:57:17,169
You don't like singing?

875
01:57:17,645 --> 01:57:18,612
I hate it.

876
01:57:19,413 --> 01:57:22,405
"The singer hates to sing"
That's a good one.

877
01:57:23,317 --> 01:57:24,784
Why is that?

878
01:57:25,252 --> 01:57:29,245
I don't wanna be the object
of your curiosity, thanks.

879
01:57:29,423 --> 01:57:31,448
Guess I hit a nerve.

880
01:57:58,313 --> 01:57:59,473
Can I help you?

881
01:58:00,915 --> 01:58:02,712
Want a bullet in the face?

882
01:58:07,856 --> 01:58:10,757
Hey you! Where's Sudo's tape?

883
01:58:11,526 --> 01:58:12,857
Tell me where it is.

884
01:58:16,931 --> 01:58:18,057
Just a second.

885
01:58:20,735 --> 01:58:21,759
Do you understand?

886
01:58:23,338 --> 01:58:25,135
I'm stuck.

887
01:58:25,273 --> 01:58:26,865
Let me get the...

888
01:58:27,609 --> 01:58:29,277
Cigarette... ah

889
01:58:29,277 --> 01:58:30,107
GET DOWN!

890
01:58:46,194 --> 01:58:47,320
Morons.

891
01:58:48,296 --> 01:58:50,423
Do you know "TELEKURA"
(phone sex business)?

892
01:58:52,634 --> 01:58:54,864
It's called "Lovely Friends".

893
01:58:55,069 --> 01:58:56,627
Tsen's recommendation.

894
01:58:57,405 --> 01:58:58,633
How about you?

895
01:59:00,175 --> 01:59:01,233
I don't know.

896
01:59:30,672 --> 01:59:33,266
Fei-Hong is that you?

897
01:59:33,608 --> 01:59:36,008
It's Glico.

898
01:59:38,613 --> 01:59:39,841
How are you?

899
01:59:40,181 --> 01:59:42,672
Fine and you?

900
01:59:42,951 --> 01:59:46,387
Good. How's everyone?

901
01:59:48,356 --> 01:59:49,550
Fei-Hong...

902
01:59:49,891 --> 01:59:51,791
Were you on TV the other day?

903
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:54,229
Fei-Hong listen...

904
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:55,719
Maybe it was someone else...

905
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:58,196
What did you do with that tape?

906
01:59:59,133 --> 01:59:59,968
Tape?

907
01:59:59,968 --> 02:00:01,230
"My Way".

908
02:00:03,037 --> 02:00:05,807
There's some weird guys after me.

909
02:00:05,807 --> 02:00:07,274
They're looking for that tape.

910
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:12,080
They have guns,
what should I do?

911
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:13,448
It's probably Riuman.

912
02:00:13,448 --> 02:00:15,177
They'll kill us.

913
02:00:16,484 --> 02:00:17,917
Where are you?

914
02:00:18,653 --> 02:00:19,779
Where are we?

915
02:00:22,023 --> 02:00:22,990
No idea.

916
02:00:23,925 --> 02:00:24,949
We don't know.

917
02:00:25,326 --> 02:00:26,418
Who's with you?

918
02:00:26,661 --> 02:00:27,753
Fei-Hong...

919
02:00:27,996 --> 02:00:29,964
If I get killed...

920
02:00:30,298 --> 02:00:30,992
What're you talking about?

921
02:00:32,467 --> 02:00:33,900
Forgive me.

922
02:00:34,802 --> 02:00:35,598
For what?

923
02:00:35,937 --> 02:00:38,997
Becoming a singer and
leaving you all behind.

924
02:00:39,474 --> 02:00:40,736
Stop talking crap!

925
02:00:40,842 --> 02:00:41,968
Forgive me.

926
02:00:42,076 --> 02:00:43,976
Don't be stupid, everyone's
happy for you

927
02:00:44,078 --> 02:00:45,280
If I get killed...

928
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:46,681
OK, OK. Just tell me where...

929
02:00:46,681 --> 02:00:47,649
If I'm killed...

930
02:00:47,649 --> 02:00:48,583
Who's gonna kill you?

931
02:00:48,583 --> 02:00:50,676
I can't imagine you letting
anyone get away with that.

932
02:00:50,818 --> 02:00:53,013
I may never see you again!

933
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:01,660
Don't worry I'll help you.

934
02:01:02,163 --> 02:01:03,152
Where are you?

935
02:01:03,564 --> 02:01:04,895
What's around there?

936
02:01:06,434 --> 02:01:07,264
Fei-Hong!

937
02:01:12,273 --> 02:01:13,205
Hello?

938
02:01:15,243 --> 02:01:16,608
Wait for me at "Aozora".

939
02:01:17,345 --> 02:01:19,745
Fei-Hong? Fei-Hong?

940
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:25,813
What is going on?

941
02:01:29,791 --> 02:01:32,954
I would appreciate it
if you'd explain to me...

942
02:01:33,461 --> 02:01:36,089
Just exactly what is going on?

943
02:01:38,299 --> 02:01:39,095
Hey!

944
02:01:40,635 --> 02:01:41,659
They're here.

945
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:01,889
I bet Mao Foo's having fun with
Glico right now!

946
02:02:02,990 --> 02:02:05,220
All we got was the faggot patrol.

947
02:02:06,994 --> 02:02:09,155
I thought that was right up
your alley!

948
02:02:10,498 --> 02:02:11,487
Shut the fuck up!

949
02:02:11,999 --> 02:02:15,162
Was she really a whore?

950
02:02:16,170 --> 02:02:18,229
Did you all get to stick it to her?

951
02:02:19,173 --> 02:02:20,640
'Course we did! Jealous?

952
02:02:30,685 --> 02:02:31,953
Can't see through the blood!

953
02:02:31,953 --> 02:02:33,614
Can't stop the blood!

954
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:47,324
What the fuck?!

955
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:00,777
Open up!

956
02:03:26,207 --> 02:03:27,538
Oh shit!

957
02:03:28,443 --> 02:03:29,171
My money.

958
02:03:37,351 --> 02:03:38,511
It's not enough.

959
02:03:42,190 --> 02:03:43,384
What's this?

960
02:03:53,401 --> 02:03:54,493
What're you...

961
02:03:59,807 --> 02:04:01,138
Mr. Fei-Hong?!

962
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:04,000
Go in! Go in!

963
02:04:10,718 --> 02:04:12,743
What kinda jerk car jacks a taxi

964
02:04:13,287 --> 02:04:15,949
and then pays the fare?!

965
02:04:17,692 --> 02:04:18,624
Give it back!

966
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:20,224
Shit!

967
02:04:23,831 --> 02:04:25,196
What are you doing?

968
02:04:30,505 --> 02:04:33,030
"This bank note cannot be used"

969
02:05:55,122 --> 02:05:56,487
Isn't this overkill?

970
02:05:57,158 --> 02:05:59,888
Shut up! Mr. Ranki's orders.

971
02:06:00,728 --> 02:06:05,597
Just for one little tape? Stupid.

972
02:06:05,733 --> 02:06:09,294
Can't be helped, Mr. Ranki's orders.

973
02:06:12,907 --> 02:06:14,465
This is no fun at all!

974
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:27,214
Aim!

975
02:06:39,834 --> 02:06:40,562
Fire!

976
02:07:03,624 --> 02:07:04,852
We're looking for it!

977
02:07:05,726 --> 02:07:06,715
That's Glico!

978
02:07:15,169 --> 02:07:16,136
What are you doing?

979
02:07:24,345 --> 02:07:25,710
Stop that!

980
02:07:36,524 --> 02:07:38,116
Is he gonna take us all on?

981
02:07:38,559 --> 02:07:40,254
Curious-er and curious-er.

982
02:07:40,628 --> 02:07:42,823
Hold your fire!
Worry about the tape later.

983
02:07:43,097 --> 02:07:46,498
Mao Foo's on the warpath now,
he's a dead man.

984
02:07:48,903 --> 02:07:51,371
How about one on one?

985
02:07:52,707 --> 02:07:56,143
If you get me, we'll let you all live.

986
02:08:00,781 --> 02:08:02,612
Mao Foo don't make
promises like that.

987
02:09:09,551 --> 02:09:11,485
What is this, a war?

988
02:09:17,225 --> 02:09:19,056
Sorry we're closed.

989
02:09:23,231 --> 02:09:24,664
Oh it's you Ageha.

990
02:09:27,335 --> 02:09:28,199
What brings you here?

991
02:09:35,410 --> 02:09:36,536
What's all this?

992
02:09:36,978 --> 02:09:38,707
I want to buy it back.

993
02:09:40,048 --> 02:09:41,345
The Yen Town Club.

994
02:09:45,587 --> 02:09:46,679
Will you sell it to me?

995
02:09:53,628 --> 02:09:59,032
You may be a kid
but you do have cash.

996
02:10:00,736 --> 02:10:04,001
Where did you get all that money?

997
02:10:04,706 --> 02:10:05,536
It's a secret.

998
02:10:08,977 --> 02:10:10,740
Did you rob a bank?

999
02:10:41,743 --> 02:10:46,510
I forgot, it's been sold

1000
02:10:47,449 --> 02:10:49,542
What! To who?

1001
02:10:50,285 --> 02:10:51,274
It's too late.

1002
02:10:52,154 --> 02:10:53,855
I'll buy it off them.

1003
02:10:53,855 --> 02:10:55,186
You can't do that.

1004
02:10:55,423 --> 02:10:58,119
Why not? Yes I can.

1005
02:10:58,393 --> 02:11:00,896
I've got all this money!

1006
02:11:00,896 --> 02:11:02,193
Because I said you can't!

1007
02:11:04,099 --> 02:11:06,260
Go home. Take the money with you.

1008
02:11:12,941 --> 02:11:16,377
The one on the left is from
the forgery.

1009
02:11:17,612 --> 02:11:19,204
They match don't they?

1010
02:11:20,615 --> 02:11:21,604
It's the same guy.

1011
02:11:22,450 --> 02:11:24,782
Run a check on Rio Ranki's group.

1012
02:11:25,787 --> 02:11:26,888
We may get something this time.

1013
02:11:26,888 --> 02:11:30,688
Riuman King, I'm gonna get you.

1014
02:11:31,860 --> 02:11:33,384
Who hired you?

1015
02:11:39,534 --> 02:11:41,369
Don't play dumb with me.

1016
02:11:41,369 --> 02:11:45,362
Those forged bills are everywhere.

1017
02:11:49,211 --> 02:11:52,271
Did all that by yourself, huh?

1018
02:12:04,426 --> 02:12:06,621
Where'd it come from?

1019
02:12:09,898 --> 02:12:10,990
I found it.

1020
02:12:11,499 --> 02:12:12,625
He found it.

1021
02:12:18,673 --> 02:12:20,542
It hurts when you lie doesn't it?

1022
02:12:20,542 --> 02:12:23,136
Even Yentown scum can see that!

1023
02:12:24,012 --> 02:12:26,915
Or do you need a little
taste of death?

1024
02:12:26,915 --> 02:12:28,849
Hey, Yentown shithead.

1025
02:12:32,020 --> 02:12:33,749
Who's your boss?

1026
02:12:34,222 --> 02:12:35,712
Tell us and we'll let you go.

1027
02:12:40,161 --> 02:12:41,788
Is it Rio Ranki?

1028
02:12:45,533 --> 02:12:47,602
I don't know.

1029
02:12:47,602 --> 02:12:48,933
He doesn't know.

1030
02:12:52,607 --> 02:12:54,507
Want money?

1031
02:12:54,943 --> 02:12:57,045
Will you talk for money?

1032
02:12:57,045 --> 02:12:59,104
Yentowns do anything for money.

1033
02:12:59,414 --> 02:13:00,745
Talk!!

1034
02:13:00,982 --> 02:13:02,609
Yentown!

1035
02:13:36,451 --> 02:13:38,976
"Yen Town- that's the name of your
whole fucking Motherland!"

1036
02:13:44,392 --> 02:13:45,825
That's what he said.

1037
02:13:53,001 --> 02:13:54,263
Get up!

1038
02:14:07,182 --> 02:14:08,410
You bastard!

1039
02:14:26,668 --> 02:14:29,102
I'll get him back.

1040
02:14:30,638 --> 02:14:34,540
One day I'll kill him.

1041
02:14:41,116 --> 02:14:42,777
God, it hurts.

1042
02:15:04,372 --> 02:15:06,397
Un-fucking-believable.

1043
02:16:05,366 --> 02:16:07,960
I could've sworn I heard singing.

1044
02:16:08,069 --> 02:16:09,036
Singing?

1045
02:16:10,738 --> 02:16:11,762
"My Way"

1046
02:16:17,946 --> 02:16:20,813
You're right. He's dead.

1047
02:16:36,998 --> 02:16:38,590
What's the name of the corpse?

1048
02:16:42,036 --> 02:16:43,196
Fei-Hong.

1049
02:16:44,539 --> 02:16:45,506
What?

1050
02:16:46,741 --> 02:16:48,333
Hio Fei-Hong.

1051
02:16:49,277 --> 02:16:50,608
Chinese?

1052
02:16:55,316 --> 02:16:57,580
Fujian or Shanghai?

1053
02:17:03,825 --> 02:17:05,156
Yentown.

1054
02:18:09,418 --> 02:18:11,852
The caterpillar turned into a butterfly.

1055
02:19:44,513 --> 02:19:48,279
Hey! What are you throwing away?

1056
02:19:51,487 --> 02:19:52,647
How much was there?

1057
02:19:53,489 --> 02:19:54,319
Lots.

1058
02:19:54,656 --> 02:19:56,146
How much is "lots"?

1059
02:19:57,726 --> 02:19:58,693
I forget.

1060
02:20:02,197 --> 02:20:03,858
Shit!

1061
02:21:38,994 --> 02:21:40,757
Do you know about tonight's
main dish?

1062
02:21:41,763 --> 02:21:42,627
He's your buddy.

1063
02:21:43,465 --> 02:21:44,523
Riuman King.

1064
02:21:49,738 --> 02:21:51,773
We're checking now but...

1065
02:21:51,773 --> 02:21:54,606
We heard the Fuchen Riuman
were on the move.

1066
02:21:55,210 --> 02:21:57,412
The Fuchen are behind it?

1067
02:21:57,412 --> 02:21:59,209
It's hard to believe.

1068
02:21:59,881 --> 02:22:05,046
In any case Mao Foo and
the gang have vanished.

1069
02:22:05,787 --> 02:22:08,790
Police have got wind of the tape too

1070
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:10,587
We should move quick.

1071
02:22:11,293 --> 02:22:15,923
Get the tape, make some money.
Think I'll go back to Shanghai,

1072
02:22:17,866 --> 02:22:18,924
or...

1073
02:22:19,768 --> 02:22:23,704
maybe buy this whole town
fix the place up.

1074
02:22:27,609 --> 02:22:29,304
Yen Town.

1075
02:22:30,946 --> 02:22:32,777
God, I hate it.

1076
02:22:41,823 --> 02:22:42,619
Stop!

1077
02:22:51,667 --> 02:22:53,498
You're looking well!

1078
02:22:58,073 --> 02:22:59,904
Not too bad.

1079
02:23:17,025 --> 02:23:18,788
We should be going.

1080
02:24:08,510 --> 02:24:10,205
Glico the hooker.

1081
02:24:11,305 --> 02:25:11,470
