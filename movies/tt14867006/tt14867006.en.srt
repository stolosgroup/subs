3
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:20,146
10, nine, eight, seven,

4
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:24,150
six, five, four,

5
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:27,453
three, two, one.

6
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,790
This is
an important bust.

7
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,025
We need it after Slater
fucked up that raid

8
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,196
at the strip club.

9
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,830
Say hi, Gary.

10
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,132
Hi, Gary.

11
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,201
First
drug raid, Gary?

12
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:43,003
Yeah.

13
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,572
We're coming up!

14
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:49,007
I'll make the announcement
when we get inside!

15
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,110
Police, search warrant, don't
move, show me your hands!

16
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,513
Lab says that goopy
shit from the van

17
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,715
is a monster of a compound.

18
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:57,518
So what?

19
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:02,421
Do you shoot it,
slurp it, or sniff it?

20
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:05,257
Well, we're about to find out.

21
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,226
Let's assume it's
very fucking potent

22
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,494
and highly addictive!

23
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,828
Well we all saw what
it did to that girl.

24
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:21,442
Let's roll out!

25
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,226
Listen up.

26
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:42,394
Get down means get fucking down.

27
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,129
10-26 means crime in progress,

28
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:47,132
and 29-9 means erase
the fucking tape.

29
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,368
Hey, you stay with me.

30
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,339
Running out, going in!

31
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,440
Police, search warrant!

32
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:59,177
Police, search warrant!

33
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,146
- Police!
- Police, search warrant!

34
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,114
Police, police!

35
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,983
- Search warrant!
- Coming up on your left.

36
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,652
- Search warrant!
- Don't fucking shoot!

37
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,787
- Search warrant!
- We're taking the lead!

38
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,921
Get the fuck back!

39
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,025
- Low to the left!
- Damn it!

40
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,127
Where
are these fucks?

41
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,596
Oursler,
Slater, check in.

42
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,466
- Search warrant!
- We're seeing planes here.

43
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:22,368
These guys could be
heavier-armed than we thought.

44
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,502
Keep
this channel clear,

45
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,337
you fucking professional!

46
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,510
All are welcome.

47
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,944
All are watching.

48
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,580
Finally, followers,

49
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:37,649
tonight is the night
you've been waiting for.

50
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,751
Track my signal.

51
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,920
- The signal is the stimulant.
- Clear!

52
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,689
- The signal is the sedative.
- Clear!

53
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,924
The
signal is salvation.

54
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,393
What the
hell is that smell?

55
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:51,029
- Forever starts right now.
- Birkhorn, don't move!

56
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,266
Hands in the air, motherfucker.

57
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:54,733
Fuck.

58
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,369
Oh, those fucking eyes.

59
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,972
Hey,
I know this guy.

60
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,143
He owns the video
store on my block.

61
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,612
This is
Brayberry, we founds some

62
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,880
of that goopy shit
from the videotape.

63
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:12,052
We've also got a 419,
could be self-inflicted.

64
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:16,021
- Police, first squad!
- Police!

65
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,301
Are you gonna
keep crying, Slater,

66
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:33,073
or are you gonna find
me some drugs in there?

67
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,091
Police, search warrant!

68
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,759
Slater,
we've got bodies!

69
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,894
Maybe get another
tac unit on standby.

70
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,570
This is a crime scene,
do not touch anything.

71
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,738
Don't fuck with
my scene, Slater!

72
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,807
Slater, let's keep moving.

73
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,275
Got a lot of building to clear.

74
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,612
We'll take the upper level.

75
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,347
Hey, I
don't think that girl

76
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,150
from the videotape is in here.

77
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,120
It's an information
superhighway that spans the globe,

78
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,189
and it is called internet,

79
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,992
or just the net
to frequent users.

80
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,260
Today millions of Americans
have personal computers

81
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,097
and can access the net
for a modest monthly fee.

82
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,931
I think I'll stick to
my telephone for now.

83
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:38,370
And in local news, a number
of Westerville residents

84
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,507
have come forward with
stories of a mysterious figure

85
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,475
they're calling the Rat Man.

86
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,176
Sounds like a
superhero, Camille.

87
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,013
That is no
superhero I'd want to meet, Mark.

88
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,683
Eyewitnesses have said that
this man or man-animal hybrid

89
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,852
lives in the sewers
and comes out at night,

90
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,154
but if you shine a
light directly at it,

91
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,123
it suddenly disappears.

92
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,026
Channel Six's Holly
Marciano has more.

93
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,161
Is he an urban legend?

94
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:06,131
Or is there really a
creature of unknown origin

95
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,966
lurking within the sewers?

96
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,368
I was just out here
taking a walk at night

97
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,240
and I heard it making
noises down there.

98
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,845
And it looked up at me like a...

99
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,980
A fucking clown.

100
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,750
This amateur sketch
resembles what many of you say

101
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,552
the Rat Man looks like.

102
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:29,187
Almost everyone has come
up with their own theories

103
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,492
and explanations for the image.

104
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,926
Yeah, my theory is the
dude's from the fucking prison

105
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:38,063
in Athens for like
the criminally insane.

106
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,330
That's where my cousin went.

107
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,733
Yeah, her crazy-ass
cousin was in there,

108
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,703
so he's like an
escaped mental case.

109
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:48,039
Oh, and he lives in the sewer
so that nobody can find him.

110
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,577
Well, I believe it's
a sign from Jesus.

111
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:54,780
It's time for
sinners and elitists

112
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,249
to get what's coming to them.

113
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,551
Mm-hm.

114
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,053
So tell me, where did
you first see him?

115
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,655
Right there.

116
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,891
Behind me, that's
where I saw him.

117
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:06,727
Right there.

118
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,363
Okay, we're done.

119
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,734
Thank you for your service.

120
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,369
Fucking last time I need
to be in this forest.

121
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,205
We could have picked
an easier path, you know.

122
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,408
There are no paths.

123
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,544
Yeah.

124
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,116
So do you want more
B-roll of the forest?

125
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,851
No, we have all
kinds of footage

126
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,389
of the forest and the
mouth of the drain.

127
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,292
Jesus, Barry, what, what
does he want us to do,

128
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,228
walk through raw sewage?

129
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,032
No, I'm not being
dramatic, I just...

130
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,202
Yeah.

131
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,070
Yep, no problem.

132
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:52,971
Okay.

133
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:56,942
Looking
a little stressed.

134
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,579
You wanna get a
drink afterwards?

135
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,047
- Jeff?
- Yeah?

136
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,851
- Fuck you.
- Copy that.

137
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,092
This is the remarkable
story of the Rat Man,

138
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,527
- Westerville's very own...
- He said he might want it

139
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,396
from inside the
drain, though, right?

140
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,865
Yeah.

141
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,935
I mean, it's a health
hazard, look at it.

142
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,309
Where is it?

143
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,379
That guy's creepy.

144
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,283
Yeah, let's get
out of his eye line.

145
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:42,988
This is the remarkable
story of the Rat Man,

146
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,224
Westerville's very
own Loch Ness monster.

147
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,627
It's a mystery that
can only be told

148
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:52,063
inside the cavernous
tunnels beneath our feet.

149
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,566
I'm Holly Marciano,
Channel Six News.

150
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,641
Construction?

151
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,511
- Let's go again.
- Yeah, going again.

152
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,413
Hang on, just gotta get focus.

153
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,684
And, all right.

154
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,688
This is the remarkable
story of the Rat Man,

155
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,658
Westerville's very
own Loch Ness monster.

156
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,360
- It's a myst...
- Uh, the hell is that?

157
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,595
Are you even,
what are you doing?

158
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,297
No, no, no,
there's someone there.

159
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,135
- Seriously.
- Oh my god.

160
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,171
I don't have the time
for these shenanigans,

161
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,306
can you with me
about something else?

162
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,277
Gimme a sec,
Holly, just hold on.

163
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:40,748
Hello?

164
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,487
Excuse me.

165
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:53,761
Oh man, are you fucking kidding?

166
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,067
What is it?

167
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,904
I don't know.

168
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:09,877
Ah.

169
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,413
Yeah, it's just a bunch of junk.

170
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,619
You think kids live down here?

171
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,020
I don't know if
you'd call this living,

172
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,991
but yeah, I mean, it's possible.

173
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,526
Jesus Christ.

174
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,930
You know, we are the
richest country in the world

175
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,465
and we treat people like this.

176
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,402
It's shameful.

177
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,540
We should record more of this.

178
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,175
Right, evidence
of what it's like

179
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,144
to actually live down here.

180
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,746
Wow, you are
really selling this, Holly.

181
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,280
Don't be a dick.

182
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,182
I'm serious, this
is a good story.

183
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,218
Don't you
have an AA meeting?

184
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,753
Fuck, I don't
want to sit around

185
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,454
and talk about my fucking
drinking problem, okay?

186
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,723
Don't you want to do something

187
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,457
that will make a
difference, Jeff?

188
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,693
That will like, I don't
know, help people?

189
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,594
Help you get
your Pulitzer, right?

190
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,133
This is what we're
talking about.

191
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,202
Holly!

192
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,205
- Holly!
- Come!

193
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,841
I need your light.

194
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,709
Ah, fuck.

195
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,212
Come on.

196
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:57,148
What are you doing?

197
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,285
What?

198
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,756
What's going on?

199
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,792
I think someone's here.

200
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:07,627
Come on.

201
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,634
Holy shit.

202
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,810
Check, look behind you, check.

203
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,082
This must be where he lives.

204
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,350
Okay, so let's,

205
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,219
I don't think we should be
messing with this right now.

206
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,420
We don't have to
mess with anything,

207
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,824
just get some footage.

208
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,284
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff...

209
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,652
Let's get
the fuck out of here.

210
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,753
- Just calm down, calm down.
- No, no, no, no.

211
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:09,754
Take a deep breath.

212
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:10,788
I'm not, fuck.

213
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,390
fuck, is that him?

214
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,392
It's okay, just
take a deep breath, all right?

215
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,761
We didn't come this
far to get nothing.

216
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,866
Just take a deep breath,
let me get your camera.

217
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:21,701
It's okay.

218
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,705
Okay.

219
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,006
- Give me a sec.
- Okay, good?

220
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,140
Yeah,
just give me a sec.

221
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:29,977
Okay.

222
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,953
I'm ready,
do you see him?

223
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,288
Yeah.

224
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,459
Just relax.

225
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:48,761
Hi.

226
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,564
Hello.

227
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,301
We didn't mean to scare you.

228
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,604
We're, we're friends, we just...

229
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,808
We wanna ask you just
a couple of questions.

230
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,543
Is that okay?

231
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,181
Okay, I'm gonna come
a little bit closer.

232
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:12,819
Okay, okay.

233
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,859
Can I ask you what your name is?

234
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,361
Bill.

235
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,197
Bill.

236
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,267
It's really nice
to meet you, Bill.

237
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,071
I'm Holly, and that's Jeff.

238
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,375
Do you have a last name, Bill?

239
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,383
Are there other people that
live down here with you?

240
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,222
Raatma.

241
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,025
I'm sorry,
can you repeat that?

242
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,027
Did you say Rat Man?

243
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,565
Are, are you the Rat Man, Bill?

244
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,202
Okay, uh...

245
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,374
Thank you.

246
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,542
I'm going to leave
you my business card,

247
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,344
- right here.
- Holly!

248
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:18,351
I'd love to follow up...

249
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,333
Holly, Holly...

250
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:36,169
Holly?

251
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:39,806
Holly!

252
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,174
Fuck this, I'm out,
I'm out of here.

253
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:17,544
What...

254
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:24,717
What the...

255
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,025
Oh my god!

256
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,261
What?

257
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:38,798
What, I don't know

258
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,102
what you want with...

259
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,006
There are...

260
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,578
There are people
that can help you,

261
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,948
that can get you
on your feet, okay?

262
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:03,823
I'm actually doing
a story on you.

263
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,460
To show people that...

264
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,929
That you're just, you're just...

265
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,465
You're normal, just
you need some help,

266
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,267
and I can help you.

267
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,602
Okay, I can...

268
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,437
If you just let me,
I can help you, okay?

269
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,471
Just let me help you.

270
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,108
- How?
- And I can help...

271
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,078
How would you help?

272
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,783
I wanted to tell
their stories.

273
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,019
I would tell their
stories to the public.

274
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,754
- Oh.
- I would help you.

275
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,357
That's a very generous offer,

276
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,861
but we're gonna
tell our own story.

277
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,364
- Jeff?
- Holly?

278
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,965
- Jeff, Jeff?
- Holly!

279
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,500
Jeff!

280
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:54,507
Stop, stop!

281
00:17:56,476 --> 00:18:00,245
No, turn that light
off, you're scaring him.

282
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,013
Come on.

283
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,781
Come on.

284
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,352
That's it, come on.

285
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,083
In the name of Raatma.

286
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,355
No, no!

287
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,126
Please, no, no!

288
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,628
Help me, please, no!

289
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,062
- Please, no!
- I thought you were

290
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,266
gonna do one of your
little news stories on us.

291
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,134
No, please.

292
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,570
Now you might
not realize it yet,

293
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,275
but you are witnessing the
beginning of a new era.

294
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,912
Only the righteous shall rise.

295
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:11,216
Your friend wasn't worthy,
but you, who knows?

296
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:15,019
For all of your sins,
you could be saved.

297
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:15,855
No!

298
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,457
No, please, please!

299
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:24,464
No!

300
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,866
- No, please!
- Give me that.

301
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,438
It's time to see if you're
welcome in the new world.

302
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,274
It's not for me to
answer evil for evil.

303
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:39,244
We leave that to the
wrath of our new god.

304
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,920
Please, no, god!

305
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,114
Why, God?

306
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,452
Compression technology.

307
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,854

ordinary drab vegetables

309
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,827

potential of carrots,

313
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:38,436
broccoli, peppers, peas.

314
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,704
So why wait?

315
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,772
Call this toll-free
number and order now.

316
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,374
The Veggie Masher
from Wonder Health,

317
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:46,143
a subsidiary of Mega
Tech Pharmaceuticals.

318
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,283
Now I am very glad to
have our wonderful coworker

319
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:55,453
Holly Marciano with us
following her incredible rescue

320
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:58,523
after she got trapped
in a storm drain.

321
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,458
Okay, come on.

322
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,695
Come on, give me your hand.

323
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,576
Gripping stuff.

324
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,411
And as I'm sure our
viewers are by now aware,

325
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,947
we are very sad to report
that cameraman Jeff Wohl

326
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,882
has yet to be found.

327
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:27,618
But Holly, we are so
happy to have you back.

328
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,622
Thank you, Mark,
it's good to be back.

329
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,557
It's the first day of fall,

330
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,692
and there's no better way
to kick off the season

331
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:38,729
than with Westerville's 94th
annual pumpkin festival.

332
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:41,432
People are already lining
up to Raatma the hay rides,

333
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,067
apple Raatma, and of course,

334
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:46,072
to see who will be crowned
the festival's largest Raatma.

335
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,545
Okay, why don't we
cut to commercial...

336
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,547
Jesus fucking Christ!

337
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,802
And in sports news,

338
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,871
Ohio state plays the Indiana
Hoosiers tomorrow night.

339
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,707
Good luck to our Buckeyes.

340
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:25,612
I'm Holly Marciano,
Channel Six News.

341
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:27,647
Hail Raatma.

342
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:41,692
These super
labs can be booby-trapped,

343
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,728
proceed with caution.

344
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,031
Could be no
one left alive in here.

345
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,536
You feeling
in over your head, Nash?

346
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,839
Mind your own
fucking head, Slater.

347
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,155
I've got people,
there's people in here.

348
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,724
Blue Team,
we've got more DBs.

349
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,394
Room full of bodies.

350
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,404
Fuck me, I'm
calling for backup.

351
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,441
No, not yet, let's
find the others.

352
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,810
Hey Slater, what's your 10-20?

353
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,078
Fuck if I know.

354
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,380
Oursler and I got
fucking separated.

355
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:41,285
Could be these bitches are
barricaded or got tipped off.

356
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:42,855
Stay where you are.

357
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:47,293
You know, if this thing
ever makes the news,

358
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:50,029
and they ask for an interview,

359
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,633
I can do it, I
got a face for TV.

360
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,288
So with
these memorial videos,

361
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,158
isn't it usually just
like home movies?

362
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,794
We record our services
from time to time.

363
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:28,801
You haven't yet met the family
of the deceased, have you?

364
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,002
They are, well,
the main point is

365
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,539
we never question the
request of the client.

366
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,874
Grief is a personal matter.

367
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,109
If the bereaved family
wants to include footage

368
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,381
of the wake in their memorial
video, we are happy to oblige.

369
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:45,015
I assume they're
paying extra for this.

370
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:47,217
That also, yes.

371
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,220
Hand me the battery.

372
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,423
I've got it to program
for the cameras as well,

373
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,325
so make sure you
keep this in CD mode,

374
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,561
otherwise you'll eject a tape

375
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:58,295
in the middle of
someone's eulogy.

376
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:00,598
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, I parked out front.

377
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,633
The wake's going to begin
at nine, so I would suggest

378
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:03,801
- you open the doors...
- Yeah, I already know.

379
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:05,402
- Why's the casket crooked?
- Hm?

380
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:08,405
I didn't place it like that.

381
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,307
You know I didn't go near it.

382
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,676
Maybe I bumped it.

383
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:12,511
Whatever.

384
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,283
Oh, Jesus, that's heavy.

385
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:20,985
Well he was a big boy.

386
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:23,420
Parts of him that
were left, anyway.

387
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,622
Ronald, he's joking, right?

388
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:27,357
The deceased was
in a severe accident.

389
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,693
It is a closed casket wake.

390
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:30,828
- Yeah, I knew that, but...
- Don't worry.

391
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,229
I was more or less
able to get him back

392
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:33,798
into his original shape.

393
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,803
Pity about his face and head.

394
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,737
But the family wanted
him to put back together,

395
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:42,439
and aside from that top part,
I'd say it's pretty good work.

396
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:43,674
But don't take my word for it,

397
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:46,143
why don't you have
a look for yourself?

398
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,645
You're gonna do great, Hailey.

399
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,413
I'll be in early tomorrow
morning to relieve you,

400
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:51,749
so if anything serious
comes up, give me a call.

401
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,620
And if it doesn't,
don't wake me up.

402
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:33,357
Yes, I was just
about to switch out the tapes,

403
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,827
but I feel dumb recording
myself just sitting here.

404
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:37,697
I'm standing.

405
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,798
Call me if
anything serious came up.

406
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,700
Nothing happening,
it's not serious.

407
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:45,636
It's a wake, he's
not going anywhere.

408
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:46,971
Maybe they got
caught in the storm,

409
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:49,475
or maybe nobody liked the guy.

410
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,244
Okay, okay, sorry.

411
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:29,479
Hey Sharon, it's me.

412
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,049
I know it's late,
but if you're up,

413
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:33,953
give me a call it
the funeral home.

414
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:40,059
No one's here and I'm
working all night,

415
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,462
and I had a quick
question for you.

416
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,331
Bye.

417
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,469
Hello?

418
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,073
I mean, Jensen Funeral Home.

419
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,109
Hey, Sharon, yeah.

420
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,479
Your mom still saves
the newspaper, right?

421
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,380
No, I...

422
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,048
No, that's fine.

423
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,485
Listen, would you mind
checking the obituary page

424
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:44,957
in the last few issues for
a guy named Andrew Edwards?

425
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:48,125
This is weird, but I'm supposed

426
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,229
to be hosting his
wake tonight, and I...

427
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,230
Something like that.

428
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,266
Basically, just
in the past week.

429
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:57,103
Yeah.

430
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:00,239
Thanks, I appreciate it.

431
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:02,341
Bye.

432
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,741
Shit, shit.

433
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,523
It's crooked?

434
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,924
I am fucking telling
you he's alive in there.

435
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,825
He fucking moved, I heard it.

436
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:39,065
I promise you,
he is very dead, Hailey.

437
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,400
If you can't handle one
under-attended wake...

438
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,503
Hang on, here's Tim.

439
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,609
Hailey, kid, I assure
you that body in that casket

440
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,611
is not capable of moving.

441
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,280
All those stories
about people waking up

442
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,082
are just urban legends.

443
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,549
It's just gas is escaping

444
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,019
or one of the other
hundred chemical processes

445
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,488
that can happen with embalmed
remains in the first 96.

446
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,290
We talked about this.

447
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,659
Gas is escaping.

448
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,194
It's just
you there, right?

449
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:12,596
So go crack the lid
and take a peek.

450
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,898
Seriously, I mean it, Ronnie
and I will stay on the line

451
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,834
and you'll see it's
just a person's remains.

452
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,203
Might look a little gross,

453
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:21,440
but that's all it is,
and you'll feel better.

454
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,109
Hailey?

455
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,843
No, you're right.

456
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:29,679
It's just the remains
settling, I know that.

457
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,549
Sorry, Tim.

458
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:33,817
It's okay, kid.

459
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:36,420
But don't call here again
tonight or Ron will fire you.

460
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:37,256
Goodnight.

461
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,823
This is
Andrew's wake, no?

462
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,958
Yes, yes.

463
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,096
My gosh, I am so
sorry, wait one second.

464
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,499
We had a power outage, so...

465
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:29,173
We met with a man
before, an old fellow.

466
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:30,607
He's not here tonight?

467
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:33,210
Oh, you must mean
Ronald, he's the manager.

468
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:35,745
He'll be in tomorrow for
the funeral services itself,

469
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,315
but I was given the
responsibility of the wake.

470
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:39,718
Doesn't matter.

471
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,886
Of course, I understand
very few could make it up

472
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,088
in this storm.

473
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,292
There's a tornado watch,
something like this.

474
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:49,495
I listen to the weather.

475
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,562
May I?

476
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:53,865
My gosh, yes.

477
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:57,303
Here.

478
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,806
Are you family, or...

479
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,956
Thank you very much.

480
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,724
Oh, do you need anything else?

481
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,197
No, I paid
my respects in full.

482
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,590
Janssen Funeral Home.

483
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,860
Hey, sorry,
I totally passed out.

484
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,428
Don't sweat it, it's cool.

485
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,830
No one showed up to
this wake tonight.

486
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,865
It's been kind of creepy,

487
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,768
so I wanted to know the
deal with the dead guy,

488
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:43,540
but someone finally visited,
so now it's not as strange.

489
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,875
Really,
someone showed up?

490
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:46,878
What were they like?

491
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,347
Why?

492
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,548
I went and flipped
through the Tribune

493
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,217
for Andrew Edwards
like you said,

494
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:55,319
but I didn't need to
look in the obituaries.

495
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,586
He was on the front page.

496
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:58,322
What?

497
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,089
Andrew Edwards
is the name of the guy

498
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,592
who jumped off the roof of
that church down in Haysburg.

499
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,294
You heard about that, right?

500
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:07,063
He was on the roof for an
hour shouting crazy gibberish,

501
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,532
and then he hit
the concrete steps

502
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,702
right as families were
beginning to show up for...

503
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:13,972
Hello, Sharon?

504
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:27,085
Hello?

505
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:46,838
What?

506
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:05,657
Mr. Edwards?

507
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:20,737
Mr. Edwards, you've been
in an accident, okay?

508
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,839
And there was...

509
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:25,875
There's some kind of a
mistake at the morgue...

510
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:51,301
He can't see me.

511
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,483
Petro, we're on
the move, where are you?

512
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,254
We're
fucking lost in here.

513
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,525
Oh god, there's
that smell again.

514
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:28,860
It's worse than dead bodies.

515
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,663
This is not the
same staircase.

516
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,904
Watch your step, there's
something on the floor.

517
00:40:49,715 --> 00:40:51,683
What the fuck is that?

518
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:55,151
Petro, where the fuck are you?

519
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:58,622
We've got another 419,
definitely not self-inflicted.

520
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,390
We don't need more tech,
we need a gravedigger!

521
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,992
We're gonna need more
than just one gravedigger.

522
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,330
This is gonna get nastier.

523
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,298
Petro!

524
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:10,600
Oursler!

525
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,569
Fucking radio isn't working.

526
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:13,404
Petro, Oursler!

527
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:17,607
All officers
check in right fucking now!

528
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:20,810
With radio interference,
this channel is not stable.

529
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,748
We have to find
an exit right now.

530
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,585
All are welcome.

531
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,920
All are watching.

532
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,822
Finally, followers,

533
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,925
tonight is the night
you've been waiting for.

534
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,394
Track my signal.

535
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,664
The signal is the stimulant.

536
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,632
The signal is the sedative.

537
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:45,070
The signal is salvation.

538
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:48,607
Forever starts right now.

539
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:44,521
Hello.

540
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:50,827
Hello.

541
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,294
Hey!

542
01:04:25,162 --> 01:04:30,167
Hello.

543
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:31,853
I, I thought you
promised no one would get hurt.

544
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:32,755
Oh, Gary.

545
01:11:36,092 --> 01:11:37,960
Someone always gets hurt.

546
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:42,964
What the fuck
is going on in there?

547
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,766
If you cannot clear
the fucking place,

548
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:47,569
then get the fuck
out of there now!

549
01:11:47,571 --> 01:11:49,873
Forever starts right now.

550
01:11:54,478 --> 01:11:56,778
Is Spivy here with you, Nash?

551
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,312
He got separated.

552
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,749
Haven't laid eyes on him.

553
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:05,319
I want to get the
fuck out of here.

554
01:12:07,255 --> 01:12:08,756
Spivy?

555
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:09,593
Spivy.

556
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:13,397
Spivy, Oursler!

557
01:12:20,068 --> 01:12:20,904
Spivy?

558
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,106
Spivy!

559
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,710
Fucking hate this place.

560
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:29,913
Spivy, come in.

561
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,680
Brayberry.

562
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:33,517
Fisher.

563
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,119
Fucking anybody, come in!

564
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:40,121
Try not to
lose your head, Slater.

565
01:12:55,839 --> 01:12:56,806
Attention!

566
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,549
Oh god!

567
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:43,620
No, no.

568
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:45,989
No.

569
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,834
No.

570
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:04,139
No.

571
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:07,010
God, no, please.

572
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,447
I'm rolling.

573
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:16,551
Okay, ready?

574
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:17,885
You can go.

575
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:20,822
Happy shall he be
that taketh and dashest

576
01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:23,092
thy little ones
against the stone.

577
01:14:34,771 --> 01:14:35,672
Yep, cool.

578
01:14:46,049 --> 01:14:49,684
America is plagued
by a black cancer

579
01:14:49,686 --> 01:14:53,087
that has been allowed to
rot this once great land

580
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:55,422
from within for far too long.

581
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:58,860
We, the last decent
men of America,

582
01:14:58,862 --> 01:15:01,596
are the true patriots who
have given blood oaths

583
01:15:01,598 --> 01:15:03,998
to defend our way of life.

584
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,601
We will take back America.

585
01:15:06,603 --> 01:15:09,103
Its rapists will be
put down in the gutter.

586
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:12,940
We will put boots to them
and squash this mongrel horde

587
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:14,842
like the rats they are.

588
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:18,746
We, the First Patriots Movement
Militia, are coming for you.

589
01:15:18,748 --> 01:15:23,150
Our time of mass
cleansing is at hand.

590
01:15:23,152 --> 01:15:25,519
And with this weapon

591
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,322
that Christ himself
in his infinite wisdom

592
01:15:28,324 --> 01:15:31,292
has seen fit to bestow upon us,

593
01:15:31,294 --> 01:15:35,663
we have become likened unto
a righteous fist of justice

594
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:38,966
that will smite the wickedness
from the face of this earth!

595
01:15:38,968 --> 01:15:40,935
- Yeah!
- The United States

596
01:15:40,937 --> 01:15:43,738
- of Fuckdom will fall!
- Yeah!

597
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,372
By god!

598
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:51,345
Bob, what do I, I
got it on standby.

599
01:15:51,347 --> 01:15:52,479
Now do I just press the button?

600
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:53,314
Press the red button.

601
01:15:53,316 --> 01:15:54,548
Just press it, okay.

602
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,083
I don't wanna press, I
don't wanna fuck it up.

603
01:15:56,085 --> 01:15:59,320
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, roll, roll, roll!

604
01:15:59,322 --> 01:16:00,924
Business, business time.

605
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,457
Jesus fuck!

606
01:16:03,459 --> 01:16:05,028
Thanks for the puddle, Steve.

607
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:10,732
Do you copy, we got a
dash on this building.

608
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:14,301
Looks like a security
entrance to the east side.

609
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:17,404
Employee parking lot,
and it's not open today,

610
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,173
but guarantee on the
day it's gonna be open.

611
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:21,242
Copy that.

612
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:22,976
I'm looking at...

613
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:24,679
Got one security camera.

614
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:27,148
Two security
camera, three, four.

615
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:30,752
We got definitely two X-ray
analyzers in the lobby,

616
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:32,485
and maybe a retinal scan.

617
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:36,658
I'll try to get some codes,
but if I don't, shit, guys.

618
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:37,894
That was final.

619
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:44,766
- Good job, good job.
- Good job.

620
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:45,601
Okay.

621
01:16:47,003 --> 01:16:48,535
We can maybe walk the beast in,

622
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:52,506
but I don't think they're open
until well after sun's out.

623
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:54,307
Does the front of the
building even get sunlight?

624
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:55,743
If we miss our
weather window now,

625
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:57,712
we're not gonna get sunlight
for a few months, Bob.

626
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:59,046
No, no, no,
no, we have to go now.

627
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:00,247
Maybe a bit drastic.

628
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:02,548
We have to go in
there and hit them up

629
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:03,851
when the building's
full up, okay?

630
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:05,119
Hell yeah.

631
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,087
They got a daycare.

632
01:17:06,089 --> 01:17:07,056
They got a daycare.

633
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:13,096
Okay, um, pull out.

634
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,430
Oh shit, front door it is.

635
01:17:16,432 --> 01:17:19,667
You know, at least the street
runs past there, right?

636
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:21,769
Oh, hang on a moment
here, Commandant, the...

637
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:22,970
Via loading dock.

638
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,771
Oh, it's the
maintenance entrance,

639
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:26,273
my cousin can get
us the passcode.

640
01:17:26,275 --> 01:17:29,744
Oh, nice, and the sun is
there most of the day, too.

641
01:17:33,349 --> 01:17:36,717
Well, gentlemen, this
is where we roll in

642
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,387
and we detonate the abomination.

643
01:18:05,882 --> 01:18:06,883
Good shot.

644
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:12,319
Tower one
to eagle's nest.

645
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:15,122
Go for eagle's nest.

646
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:16,323
Package has landed.

647
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:17,827
Copy that, tower one.

648
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:29,237
Hope you weren't waiting long.

649
01:18:30,974 --> 01:18:33,009
Work as much, but
there's plenty of it.

650
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:37,112
Greg.

651
01:18:39,582 --> 01:18:43,384
Gotta say, you boys
don't fool around.

652
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:46,087
I'm very impressed
with the security here.

653
01:18:46,089 --> 01:18:47,521
Dam right, we're tight as
a fucking drum, all right?

654
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:50,357
Shut the fuck up, Jimmy,
you're out of order.

655
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:51,761
My bad, sorry, Commandant.

656
01:18:53,196 --> 01:18:55,298
Well trained soldiers
you got there, Greg.

657
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:59,903
It's Air Commandant
when we're in uniform.

658
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,939
Copy that, Air Commandant.

659
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:08,244
Now your unit may be a
well-regulated militia.

660
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,483
But you ain't nowhere
near well armed enough

661
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:19,453
for the very necessary fight
you've got coming your way.

662
01:19:19,455 --> 01:19:22,289
My god, this is making
my fucking dick hard.

663
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,557
This is making
all our dicks hard.

664
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:26,260
Yeah, Bob, I
can see it from here.

665
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:27,694
This will be more than enough

666
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:29,931
to hold off whatever authorities
come at you after the op.

667
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:31,164
Now if those Waco numbnuts

668
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,000
would have had half
this hardware on hand,

669
01:19:33,002 --> 01:19:35,101
ATF would still be out
there getting chewed up.

670
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:36,403
Bet you these were
just drinking up

671
01:19:36,405 --> 01:19:38,105
- that fucking Iraqi blood, huh?
- Oh fuck yeah!

672
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,673
Fucking Desert Storm!

673
01:19:39,675 --> 01:19:41,275
Oy, desert buttfuck, Talon!

674
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,476
No one at the police station

675
01:19:42,478 --> 01:19:44,711
saw you taking
any of this stuff?

676
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:45,980
Nope.

677
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:47,481
How's that?

678
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:49,018
We got friends everywhere.

679
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:51,685
You know it.

680
01:19:51,687 --> 01:19:53,619
Especially with a grease
stain like Clinton

681
01:19:53,621 --> 01:19:55,689
in the White House.

682
01:19:55,691 --> 01:19:58,392
Lots of cops are
ready for you patriots

683
01:19:58,394 --> 01:20:01,330
to take the feds down, hard.

684
01:20:05,401 --> 01:20:08,101
Could you say
something, Air Commandant,

685
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,503
about how momentous this
moment is for the cause?

686
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:11,773
With the weapons and all.

687
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:14,844
Cut.

688
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:30,093
This is but a earthly arsenal.

689
01:20:40,904 --> 01:20:42,271
Well met, fellow warrior.

690
01:20:43,739 --> 01:20:44,673
This man here...

691
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:49,243
This man heard Wu Tan's
clarion call to action

692
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:50,313
and he did his part.

693
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:54,715
He hath armed us for
conflict sure to come

694
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:58,351
after the heroic act that
we have all given blood oath

695
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:00,054
to undertake.

696
01:21:00,056 --> 01:21:04,926
We will topple the Patrick
V. McNamara Federal Building

697
01:21:04,928 --> 01:21:07,728
in the infested cesspit
of Detroit, Michigan.

698
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:09,232
- Fuck yeah.
- Fucking right.

699
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:12,868
And you're
certain the weapon works?

700
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:14,803
The creature?

701
01:21:15,771 --> 01:21:16,605
Of course.

702
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:19,407
So you tested it?

703
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:32,153
Someone turn off
that fucking bell!

704
01:21:32,155 --> 01:21:33,722
- There.
- Please, no.

705
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:35,624
Please.

706
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:39,327
Please.

707
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:41,530
Please.

708
01:21:50,273 --> 01:21:51,107
Jimmy.

709
01:21:57,713 --> 01:21:59,080
Bucket.

710
01:21:59,082 --> 01:22:01,983
Come on, take that bit.

711
01:22:01,985 --> 01:22:03,417
Don't get any on you,

712
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:03,987
you don't know what that
shit's gonna do to your scent.

713
01:22:06,522 --> 01:22:07,456
Yeah, drain him.

714
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:09,692
Come on, bitch.

715
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:12,061
Yeah, here we go.

716
01:22:13,362 --> 01:22:15,429
That's probably good enough.

717
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,198
Pretty cool eyes.

718
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,599
This one looks pretty cool.

719
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:19,666
Kinda evil looking.

720
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:21,135
Oh shit, those coyotes?

721
01:22:21,137 --> 01:22:22,636
Yeah.

722
01:22:22,638 --> 01:22:24,905
Okay, let's do this.

723
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:25,741
Good girl.

724
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:29,143
Good girl.

725
01:22:29,145 --> 01:22:31,712
Okay, Phoebe, this
is the good stuff.

726
01:22:31,714 --> 01:22:35,016
This is to redeem the soul
of the goddamn US of A.

727
01:22:35,018 --> 01:22:36,383
- Oh yeah.
- You understand me?

728
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:38,519
Okay, get this for posterity,
can you focus this?

729
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:40,087
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, let's get that.

730
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:41,722
- Got it?
- Let's do this, yeah.

731
01:22:41,724 --> 01:22:44,860
Creature blood going
in, three, two, one.

732
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:51,632
Say something,
Air Commandant,

733
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:53,636
on what we're doing here.

734
01:22:55,038 --> 01:22:58,372
Well, uh, I got
to thinking, Bob,

735
01:22:58,374 --> 01:22:59,940
that it would probably
be a good idea

736
01:22:59,942 --> 01:23:03,677
to test the ultimate weapon
before we're fully committed

737
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,878
and running the mission.

738
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,282
Smart, really smart.

739
01:23:09,618 --> 01:23:11,154
What's taking him so...

740
01:23:12,388 --> 01:23:13,587
Oh shit.

741
01:23:13,589 --> 01:23:15,556
Shit, here we go, here
we go, here we go.

742
01:23:15,558 --> 01:23:17,724
Run, boy, the sun is coming up!

743
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:18,861
Everyone down, down!

744
01:23:35,077 --> 01:23:37,813
What in the actual fuck?

745
01:23:38,746 --> 01:23:40,314
- Jimmy!
- What?

746
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:43,350
It's probably blocked
by the tree or something!

747
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:45,319
Get in there, don't
be such a fucking...

748
01:23:52,395 --> 01:23:54,860
Fucking Christ.

749
01:24:00,469 --> 01:24:02,836
First martyrs
of the cause, baby!

750
01:24:02,838 --> 01:24:04,371
- It happened, it worked!
- It's gone!

751
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:05,672
- What'd you say?
- It's gone!

752
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:07,441
- What?
- Phoebe!

753
01:24:07,443 --> 01:24:09,077
- It's gone!
- It works!

754
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:17,684
Fuck you!

755
01:24:17,686 --> 01:24:18,521
Yeah!

756
01:24:20,323 --> 01:24:21,588
This fucking smoke!

757
01:24:33,502 --> 01:24:36,570
All right, I give
the go-ahead, and...

758
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,874
And fucking boom!

759
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:46,915
Um...

760
01:24:48,916 --> 01:24:50,784
Fuck, Chuck, one second.

761
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:53,187
- Fuck.
- Sorry, sorry.

762
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:54,621
They have to all go
down at the same time,

763
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:56,056
- otherwise these fucking...
- Sensor's just not

764
01:24:56,058 --> 01:24:57,858
fucking going, Greg, I
don't know what's going on.

765
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:00,661
Well then you go and
you get the part tomorrow.

766
01:25:00,663 --> 01:25:02,831
Guess what, we're going
the day after now.

767
01:25:05,067 --> 01:25:05,999
Fuck!

768
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:07,668
Nothing can be left to chance,

769
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:10,173
we are stepping onto
the world stage here.

770
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:14,643
God in his infinite wisdom has
given us a boon for the ages.

771
01:25:15,978 --> 01:25:20,483
A metaphysical super
weapon, living destruction.

772
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:26,955
I will not let
Christ the King down.

773
01:25:30,326 --> 01:25:33,960
We must do his good
work with honor!

774
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:34,797
Yes, sir.

775
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:42,303
Well it looks like
it's one more day

776
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:46,575
until the fall of the
unholy American Empire.

777
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,847
But tonight,

778
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:56,318
tonight we will send off proper.

779
01:25:57,753 --> 01:26:02,155
We will cleanse ourselves
before the retribution.

780
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:06,228
We will get cork
high and bottle deep!

781
01:26:09,865 --> 01:26:11,932
We're gonna get fucking wasted.

782
01:26:11,934 --> 01:26:13,166
Yeah!

783
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:15,269
All right, yeah!

784
01:26:15,271 --> 01:26:18,572
- Fucking...
- Commandant's private stash!

785
01:26:18,574 --> 01:26:19,940
Oh, get it!

786
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:28,882
You gonna go piss?

787
01:26:28,884 --> 01:26:30,182
- A piss?
- You taking a piss?

788
01:26:30,184 --> 01:26:31,985
Are you gonna come
watch me take a piss?

789
01:26:31,987 --> 01:26:33,387
Yeah, you
want me to film it,

790
01:26:33,389 --> 01:26:34,955
- you fucking perv?
- Yeah, fucking go ahead.

791
01:26:34,957 --> 01:26:36,990
Hey, we're going to
the pissing hole!

792
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:40,294
- No, never rest, only pee!
- Yeah.

793
01:26:40,296 --> 01:26:41,129
- Never rest, only pee!
- Only pee.

794
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:49,235
Holy, ah, I tell you.

795
01:26:49,237 --> 01:26:50,637
Fucking...

796
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:53,173
Let me tell
you, these were fucking,

797
01:26:53,175 --> 01:26:55,141
these are $12.

798
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:57,610
Oh, Jessie, what the fuck?

799
01:26:57,612 --> 01:26:59,946
- I'll get, I'll get you.
- Oh shit!

800
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:01,982
I know how to use this.

801
01:27:01,984 --> 01:27:04,585
Oy, oy, oy, you're good.

802
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:09,256
Bob, we need you, Bob!

803
01:27:09,258 --> 01:27:11,557
- You need a drink, Bob.
- Bob's out!

804
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:14,094
- You need a drink.
- Bob!

805
01:27:14,096 --> 01:27:16,797
Give it to him.

806
01:27:16,799 --> 01:27:19,164
Your
camera is your mask.

807
01:27:19,166 --> 01:27:21,234
- Camera is my mask?
- Why don't you have a drink?

808
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,735
You're wearing
a literal mask.

809
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:24,204
- You have to have...
- I will have a drink.

810
01:27:24,206 --> 01:27:26,940
- A drink.
- I've been working hard.

811
01:27:26,942 --> 01:27:29,175
- Oh, you first.
- You know what?

812
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:30,012
You're sick.

813
01:27:42,157 --> 01:27:43,392
Ow, ow.

814
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:49,632
There he is.

815
01:27:50,499 --> 01:27:52,335
Fucking fuck.

816
01:27:56,839 --> 01:27:58,005
Fucking pussy.

817
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:01,477
Steve.

818
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,355
Steve.

819
01:28:14,357 --> 01:28:16,392
Where's the fucking monster?

820
01:28:23,332 --> 01:28:24,933
Let's fuck with him, man.

821
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:27,803
- What?
- Let's fuck with him.

822
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:30,771
You don't...

823
01:28:30,773 --> 01:28:32,305
You don't wanna piss on him?

824
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:34,841
The fuck, Bob, what the
fuck is wrong with you, man?

825
01:28:34,843 --> 01:28:36,677
The fuck
is wrong with you?

826
01:28:36,679 --> 01:28:39,846
Bob, just go back to the
fucking party, man, okay?

827
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:43,517
Let me do my thing, you go,
get the fuck out of here.

828
01:28:43,519 --> 01:28:44,353
The fuck?

829
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:50,190
Pussy, I fucking knew you'd
pussy out, you little bitch.

830
01:28:50,192 --> 01:28:51,894
Fucking Steve.

831
01:28:54,397 --> 01:28:57,297
Welcome to romance hour.

832
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:03,770
Oh, oh, wow.

833
01:29:03,772 --> 01:29:05,508
Give him a kiss.

834
01:29:06,775 --> 01:29:08,043
- What?
- Kiss him!

835
01:29:11,547 --> 01:29:12,579
You fucking dare me?

836
01:29:12,581 --> 01:29:13,449
Fucking do it!

837
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:16,719
Fucking French him!

838
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,793
Oh my god.

839
01:29:26,795 --> 01:29:28,294
Give me that fucking thing.

840
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:30,831
No, no, no, no, no.

841
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:33,769
Bob!

842
01:29:37,239 --> 01:29:38,639
Oh god!

843
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:40,441
You sick fuck!

844
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:47,850
Is that you?

845
01:29:49,151 --> 01:29:50,751
- What the fuck?
- Go, go, go!

846
01:29:50,753 --> 01:29:52,018
- Wait, who the fuck...
- Who's that with Bart?

847
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,189
- I don't know.
- Who's on fucking duty?

848
01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:57,390
- Who's on duty?
- It's supposed to be me.

849
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:58,525
- I'm sorry!
- What the fuck?

850
01:29:58,527 --> 01:29:59,726
I'm sorry,
Commandant, I'll fix it!

851
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:01,263
- Oh, fuck.
- Go!

852
01:30:02,565 --> 01:30:03,830
- What are you doing?
- I'll fix it!

853
01:30:03,832 --> 01:30:07,367
Who the fuck is that,
who the fuck is that?

854
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:09,869
The fuck is that thing?

855
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:10,806
Is that Terry?

856
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:15,776
- Is that Terry?
- Terry?

857
01:30:15,778 --> 01:30:18,211
- Who is that?
- Terry's fucking dead!

858
01:30:18,213 --> 01:30:19,214
Oh my god.

859
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:23,818
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

860
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:29,958
Terry's fucking dead.

861
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,360
Do not fire until
I give the order!

862
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:43,739
Who, who are we missing?

863
01:30:45,641 --> 01:30:46,940
- Um...
- Who?

864
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,642
- Fucking Reed.
- Steve.

865
01:30:48,644 --> 01:30:50,378
Steve was on desk last night.

866
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:52,913
Has anyone seen him?

867
01:30:52,915 --> 01:30:55,414
Steve, is that you, boy?

868
01:31:02,224 --> 01:31:03,857
What the fuck!

869
01:31:03,859 --> 01:31:05,958
Stop, wait!

870
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,928
Wait, stop, stop, fucking wait!

871
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:09,062
Fucking wait,

872
01:31:09,064 --> 01:31:10,864
take your hands off the trigger!

873
01:31:13,335 --> 01:31:18,340
Fucking...

874
01:31:19,074 --> 01:31:21,510
Judas fucking Priest!

875
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:24,110
- Greg?
- Steve!

876
01:31:24,112 --> 01:31:27,012
Steve, no, stop, stop,
you fucking idiot!

877
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:29,349
You're covered in vampire blood!

878
01:31:29,351 --> 01:31:31,251
Stop moving, no, no, no, no!

879
01:31:36,659 --> 01:31:39,094
Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve!

880
01:31:42,898 --> 01:31:44,330
Come on, Greg.

881
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,266
Mother fuck.

882
01:31:46,268 --> 01:31:48,467
Fuck, fuck this
evil abomination.

883
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:49,770
We are gonna go in there

884
01:31:49,772 --> 01:31:51,672
and we're gonna take
this creature down.

885
01:31:51,674 --> 01:31:53,273
We don't get in
there before sundown,

886
01:31:53,275 --> 01:31:54,708
we're not gonna be able
to do nothing noways.

887
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:57,778
This fucking thing's
unstoppable at night, come on.

888
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:00,282
Well then lock
and fucking load then.

889
01:32:11,594 --> 01:32:12,427
Move in!

890
01:32:15,798 --> 01:32:17,831
Dude, what the fuck
was that, what the fuck?

891
01:32:23,505 --> 01:32:26,108
Over here, come here.

892
01:32:32,447 --> 01:32:33,614
Fuck!

893
01:32:33,616 --> 01:32:35,481
- Oh shit, fuck.
- What?

894
01:32:35,483 --> 01:32:36,318
Fuck.

895
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:39,321
Fucking thing, holy shit.

896
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:44,059
Go.

897
01:32:45,227 --> 01:32:47,630
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

898
01:33:20,295 --> 01:33:21,129
Clear!

899
01:33:23,632 --> 01:33:25,365
Whoa, whoa!

900
01:33:25,367 --> 01:33:26,967
Oh fuck!

901
01:33:26,969 --> 01:33:28,333
Oh god!

902
01:33:28,335 --> 01:33:30,570
Oh my god, Tom!

903
01:33:30,572 --> 01:33:33,606
What the fuck!

904
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:38,612
Jesus Christ!

905
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:41,081
I think we got him.

906
01:33:41,083 --> 01:33:42,382
Shit.

907
01:33:42,384 --> 01:33:43,451
Get up there!

908
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:08,408
Shit!

909
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:09,776
- Greg!
- My leg, my leg!

910
01:34:09,778 --> 01:34:11,845
Fuck!

911
01:34:11,847 --> 01:34:14,047
No, no, no!

912
01:34:14,049 --> 01:34:18,418
Shit!

913
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:19,652
My leg!

914
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:24,392
Okay, okay, okay.

915
01:35:03,598 --> 01:35:05,899
Christ is king,
Christ is king, Christ.

916
01:35:05,901 --> 01:35:09,169
Christ is king, Christ
is king, Christ is king,

917
01:35:09,171 --> 01:35:10,636
Christ, Christ is king.

918
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:14,039
Christ is king, Christ is
king, Christ, Christ is king.

919
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:17,643
Christ is king, Christ
is king, Christ is king,

920
01:35:17,645 --> 01:35:20,914
Christ, Christ, Christ
is king, Christ is king.

921
01:35:20,916 --> 01:35:23,616
Christ is
king, Christ is king.

922
01:35:23,618 --> 01:35:28,623
Christ is king!

923
01:35:49,978 --> 01:35:52,578
Jesus fucking Christ!

924
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,948
Get me out of here, god damn it!

925
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:57,217
God can't
help you now, Slater.

926
01:35:57,219 --> 01:35:59,319
Didn't you see that
last videotape?

927
01:35:59,321 --> 01:36:01,556
I saw you in that last tape.

928
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:04,891
Slater's got some
explaining to do.

929
01:36:04,893 --> 01:36:06,761
We've got some
explaining to do.

930
01:36:08,063 --> 01:36:10,163
Fucking untie me!

931
01:36:10,165 --> 01:36:12,400
We're lost in here
with fucking junkies.

932
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,802
You still think
this is a drug ring?

933
01:36:15,804 --> 01:36:17,670
It's our videotapes
that are the villain.

934
01:36:17,672 --> 01:36:20,640
Our videotapes are
gonna fuck you up.

935
01:36:20,642 --> 01:36:22,077
It's more like a trance.

936
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:29,715
Are you telling me that Spivy

937
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:31,885
is in a fucking trance!

938
01:36:31,887 --> 01:36:33,854
No, Spivy's dead.

939
01:36:38,493 --> 01:36:40,395
What the fuck is all of this?

940
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:45,298
This is a far out
fetish film cult

941
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:49,269
of bootleggers pushing that
untouched, untouchable,

942
01:36:49,271 --> 01:36:51,704
nastiest of the nasties.

943
01:36:51,706 --> 01:36:55,307
Snuffing and fluffing,
cannibals, animals.

944
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:58,945
Girls in white suits
fucking shit up!

945
01:36:58,947 --> 01:37:02,883
We deal in contraband
content, strictly VHS.

946
01:37:02,885 --> 01:37:03,952
Definitely illegal.

947
01:37:05,253 --> 01:37:06,987
Oh my god, I didn't
think we'd get busted

948
01:37:06,989 --> 01:37:08,590
by our own useless unit.

949
01:37:14,296 --> 01:37:17,663
Are you
ready for your closeup?

950
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,900
What the fuck
did you just say?

951
01:37:19,902 --> 01:37:21,734
We are the final girls.

952
01:37:21,736 --> 01:37:23,303
You're our final kill.

953
01:37:51,366 --> 01:37:53,166
Some help here, Nash?

954
01:37:53,168 --> 01:37:55,337
My camera's fucking stuck!

955
01:38:15,557 --> 01:38:17,923
This tape's
gonna be our best one yet.

956
01:38:17,925 --> 01:38:19,261
Fans are gonna go crazy.

957
01:38:21,964 --> 01:38:23,130
What should we call it?

958
