00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,570
<i>Born of cold and winter air</i>

3
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,804
<i>And mountain rain combining</i>

4
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,083
<i>This icy force both foul and fair</i>

5
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,484
<i>Has a frozen heart worth mining</i>

6
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,489
<i>So out through the heart</i>

7
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,971
<i>Cold and clear</i>

8
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,010
<i>Strike for love and strike for fear</i>

9
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,891
<i>See the beauty sharp and sheer</i>

10
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,885
<i>Split the ice apart</i>

11
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,840
<i>And break the frozen heart
Hup, ho</i>

12
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,288
<i>Watch your step
Let it go</i>

13
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,768
<i>Hup, ho</i>

14
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,561
<i>Watch your step
Let it go</i>

15
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,921
<i>Beautiful
Powerful</i>

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,286
<i>Dangerous
Cold</i>

17
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,601
<i>Ice has a magic
Can't be controlled</i>

18
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,841
<i>Stronger than one</i>

19
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,081
<i>Stronger than ten</i>

20
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,965
<i>Stronger than a hundred men!</i>

21
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,326
Oh!

22
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,767
<i>Born of cold
And winter air</i>

23
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,081
<i>And mountain rain combining</i>

24

<i>This icy force both foul and fair</i>

25
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,245
<i>Has a frozen heart worth mining</i>

26
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,646
<i>Cut through the heart</i>

27
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,846
<i>Cold and clear</i>

28
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,082
<i>Strike for love and strike for fear</i>

29
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,602
<i>There's beauty and there's danger here</i>

30
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,922
<i>Split the ice apart</i>

31
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,210
<i>Beware the frozen heart</i>

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,927
Come on, Sven.

33
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,485
Elsa. Psst!

34
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,365
Elsa!

35
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,688
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up!

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,321
Anna, go back to sleep.

37
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,808
I just can't.

38
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,925
The sky is awake, so I'm awake.

39
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,129
So, we have to play.

40
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,123
Go play by yourself.

41
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,248
Do you want to build a snowman?

42
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,927
Come on, come on, come on!

43
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,887
Do the magic!

44
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,849
Do the magic!

45
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,486
Oh...

46
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,929
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

47
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,129
This is amazing!

48
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,211
Watch this!

49
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,085
Hi, I'm Olaf,

50
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,764
and I like warm hugs.

51
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,444
I love you, Olaf!

52
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,884
Olaf...

53
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,401
Tickle bumps!

54
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,846
Oh!

55
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,561
Hang on!

56
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,961
Catch me!

57
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,007
Gotcha!

58
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,286
Again!

59
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,601
Wait!

60
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,487
- Whoo-hoo!
- Slow down!

61
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,767
Whoo!

62
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,046
Anna!

63
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,526
Anna!

64
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,043
Mama! Papa!

65
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,204
No, no...

66
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,285
You're okay, Anna. I got you.

67
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,846
Elsa, what have you done?

68
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,930
This is getting out of hand.

69
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,443
It was an accident. I'm sorry, Anna!

70
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,365
- Oh. She's ice cold.
- I know where we have to go.

71
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,446
Ice?

72
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,045
Faster, Sven.

73
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,121
Sven!

74
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,082
Please! Help! It's my daughter.

75
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,527
It's the king.

76
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,329
- Trolls?
- Shush!

77
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,805
I'm trying to listen.

78
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,971
Cuties. I'm going to keep you.

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,445
Your Majesty.

80
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,484
Born with the powers, or cursed?

81
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,001
Born.
And they're getting stronger.

82
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,531
Here, here.

83
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,364
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.

84
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,730
The heart is not so easily changed.

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,526
But the head can be persuaded.

86
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,410
Do what you must.

87
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,086
I recommend we remove all magic.

88
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,842
Even memories of magic, to be safe.

89
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,809
But don't worry. I'll leave the fun.

90
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,211
She will be okay.

91
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,888
But she won't remember I have powers?

92
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,891
It's for the best.

93
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,284
Listen to me, Elsa.
Your power will only grow.

94
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,921
There is beauty in it...

95
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,289
But also great danger.

96
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,760
You must learn to control it.

97
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,563
Fear will be your enemy.

98
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,561
No!

99
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,251
We'll protect her.

100
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,448
She can learn to control it. I'm sure.

101
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,045
<i>Until then...</i>

102
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,844
<i>We'll look the gates.</i>

103
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,520
<i>We'll reduce the staff.</i>

104
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,887
<i>We will limit her contact with people,</i>

105
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,044
<i>and keep her powers
hidden from everyone.</i>

106
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,170
<i>Including Anna.</i>

107
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,524
Ah.

108
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,366
Elsa?

109
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,845
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

110
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,647
<i>Come on, let's go and play</i>

111
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,603
<i>I never see you anymore</i>

112
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,046
<i>Come out the door</i>

113
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,806
<i>It's like you've gone away</i>

114
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,921
<i>We used to be best buddies
And now we're not</i>

115
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,001
<i>I wish you would tell me why</i>

116
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,966
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

117
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,891
<i>It doesn't
have to be a snowman</i>

118
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,610
Go away, Anna.

119
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,530
<i>Okay, bye</i>

120
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,891
The gloves will help.

121
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,289
See? Conceal it.

122
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,970
Don't feel it.

123
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,724
Don't let it show.

124
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,565
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

125
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,881
<i>Or ride our bike around the halls?</i>

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,082
<i>I think some company is overdue</i>

127
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,004
<i>I've started talking
To the pictures on the walls</i>

128
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,201
Hang in there, Joan.

129
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,762
<i>It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms</i>

130
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,691
<i>Just watching the hours tick by</i>

131
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,086
I'm scared.

132
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,161
It's getting stronger!

133
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,005
Getting upset only makes it worse.
Calm down.

134
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,809
No! Don't touch me!

135
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,008
Please, I don't want to hurt you.

136
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,684
See you in two weeks!

137
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,961
Do you have to go?

138
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,369
You'll be fine, Elsa.

139
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,325
Your Highness.

140
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,641
Elsa?

141
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,887
<i>Please
I know you're in there</i>

142
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,447
<i>People are asking where you've been</i>

143
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,329
<i>They say "Have courage"
And I'm trying to</i>

144
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,689
<i>I'm right out here for you</i>

145
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,007
<i>Just let me in</i>

146
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,050
<i>We only have each other
It's just you and me</i>

147
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,571
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

148
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,240
<i>Do you wanna build a snowman?</i>

149
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,210
All ashore!

150
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,486
Welcome to Arendelle!

151
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,160
Watch your step, please.

152
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,890
The gates will be opening soon.

153
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,843
Why do I have to wear this?

154
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,048
Because the queen has come of age.

155
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,924
It's Coronation Day!

156
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,809
That's not my fault.

157
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,243
What do you want, Sven?

158
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,560
"Give me a snack."

159
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,244
What's the magic word?

160
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,321
"Please."

161
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,289
Uh! Uh-uh-uh. Share.

162
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,962
I can't believe they're
finally opening up the gates!

163
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,681
- And for a whole day!
- Faster, Percy!

164
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,007
Arendelle, our most
mysterious trade partner.

165
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,324
Open those gates so I may unlock

166
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,841
your secrets and exploit your riches.

167
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,726
Did I say that out loud?

168
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,610
Oh! Me sore eyes can't wait

169
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,330
to see the queen and the princess.

170
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,488
I bet they are absolutely lovely.

171
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,682
I bet they are beautiful.

172
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,364
Princess Anna?

173
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,602
- Princess Anna?
- Huh? Yeah?

174
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,766
Oh. Sorry to wake you, ma'am.

175
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,644
No, no, no, you didn't.

176
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,290
I've been up for hours.

177
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,966
Who is it?

178
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,804
Still me, ma'am.

179
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,645
The gates will open soon.
Time to get ready.

180
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,762
Of course.

181
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,001
Ready for what?

182
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,560
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

183
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,961
My sister's corneration.

184
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,848
It's Coronation Day!

185
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,963
It's Coronation Day!

186
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,326
<i>The window is open!</i>

187
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,481
<i>So's that door!</i>

188
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,801
<i>I didn't know they did that anymore</i>

189
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,930
<i>Who knew we owned
8,000 salad plates?</i>

190
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,762
<i>For years I've roamed these empty halls</i>

191
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,362
<i>Why have a ballroom with no balls?</i>

192
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,765
<i>Finally
They're opening up the gates!</i>

193
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,726
<i>There'll be actual, real, live people</i>

194
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,723
<i>It'll be totally strange</i>

195
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,850
<i>But wow!
Am I so ready for this change!</i>

196
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,449
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

197
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,365
<i>There'll be music</i>

198
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,205
<i>There'll be light</i>

199
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,522
<i>For the first time</i>

200
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,602
<i>In forever</i>

201
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,648
<i>I'll be dancing through the night</i>

202
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,928
<i>Don't know if I'm elated or gassy</i>

203
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,765
<i>But I'm somewhere in that zone</i>

204
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,802
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

205
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,649
<i>I won't be alone</i>

206
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,610
I can't wait to meet everyone!

207
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,166
What if I meet The One?

208
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,240
<i>Tonight
Imagine me gown and all</i>

209
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,561
<i>Fetchingly draped against the wall</i>

210
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,964
<i>The picture of sophisticated grace</i>

211
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,567
<i>I suddenly see him standing there</i>

212
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,801
<i>A beautiful stranger</i>

213
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,881
<i>Tall and fair</i>

214
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,522
<i>I wanna stuff some chocolate
in my face!</i>

215
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,291
<i>But then we laugh and talk all evening</i>

216
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,567
<i>Which is totally bizarre</i>

217
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,645
<i>Nothing like the life
I've led so far</i>

218
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,005
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

219
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,683
<i>There'll be magic
There'll be fun</i>

220
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,164
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

221
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,883
<i>I could be noticed by someone</i>

222
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,567
<i>And I know it is totally crazy</i>

223
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,201
<i>To dream I'd find romance</i>

224
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,209
<i>But for the first time in forever</i>

225
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,287
<i>At least I've got a chance!</i>

226
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,769
<i>Don't let them in</i>

227
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,202
<i>Don't let them see</i>

228
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,091
<i>Be the good girl</i>

229
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,730
<i>You always have to be</i>

230
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,046
<i>Conceal</i>

231
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,051
<i>Don't feel</i>

232
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,243
<i>Put on a show</i>

233
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,046
<i>Make one wrong move</i>

234
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,691
<i>And everyone will know</i>

235
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,605
<i>But it's only for today</i>

236
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,647
<i>It's only for today</i>

237
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,485
<i>It's agony to wait</i>

238
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,491
<i>Tell the guards to open up</i>

239
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,601
<i>The gate</i>

240
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,728
<i>The gate</i>

241
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,169
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

242
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,526
<i>Don't let them in
Don't let them see</i>

243
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,241
<i>I'm getting what I'm dreaming of</i>

244
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,441
<i>Be the good girl</i>

245
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,726
<i>You always have to be</i>

246
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,171
<i>A chance to change</i>

247
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,004
<i>My lonely world</i>

248
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,320
<i>Conceal</i>

249
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,643
<i>A chance to find true love</i>

250
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,722
<i>Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know</i>

251
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,848
<i>I know it all ends tomorrow</i>

252
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,770
<i>So it has to be today!</i>

253
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,768
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

254
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,681
<i>For the first time</i>

255
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,162
<i>In forever</i>

256
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,125
<i>Nothing's in my way!</i>

257
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,041
Hey!

258
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,451
I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

259
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,885
Hey.

260
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,883
Uh...
No, no, I'm okay.

261
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,086
Are you sure?

262
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,845
Yeah.
I just wasn't looking where I was going.

263
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,002
But I'm great, actually.

264
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,289
Oh... Thank goodness.

265
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,280
Oh! Uh...

266
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,129
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

267
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,449
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

268
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,045
"Princess"? My Lady.

269
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,326
Oh!

270
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,204
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

271
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,645
Um...
Whew.

272
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,211
Hi. Again.

273
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,009
Oh, boy!

274
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,921
This is awkward.

275
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,644
Not "You're awkward,"
but just because we're...

276
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,041
I'm awkward, you're gorgeous.
Wait, what?

277
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:48,495
I'd like to formally apologize

278
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,727
for hitting the princess
of Arendelle with my horse.

279
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,130
And for every moment after.

280
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,645
No! No, no. It's fine.

281
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,006
I'm not that princess.

282
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,804
I mean, if you had hit my sister Elsa,

283
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,644
it would be... Yeesh!

284
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,210
Because, you know...

285
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,486
Hello.

286
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,284
But, lucky you,

287
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,244
it's just me.

288
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,887
"Just" you?

289
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,045
The bells. The coronation.

290
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,282
I better go.

291
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,931
I have to go. I better go. Uh...

292
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,601
Bye!

293
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,124
Oh, no. Oh!

294
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,602
Your Majesty, the gloves.

295
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,404
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

296
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,922
Queen Elsa of Arendelle!

297
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,571
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

298
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,125
Princess Anna of Arendelle.

299
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,606
Oh. Here? Are you sure?

300
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,806
Because I don't think I'm supposed to...

301
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,120
Oh. Okay.

302
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,247
Hi.

303
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,244
"Hi" me? Oh...

304
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,130
Um... Hi.

305
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,286
You look beautiful.

306
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,408
Thank you.
You look beautiful-ler.

307
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,970
I mean, not "fuller." You don't look fuller.

308
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,087
But more beautiful.

309
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,969
Thank you.

310
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,326
So...

311
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,409
This is what a party looks like.

312
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,325
It's warmer than I thought.

313
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,528
What is that amazing smell?

314
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,526
Chocolate.

315
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,720
Your Majesty.

316
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,845
- The Duke of Weaseltown.
- "Weselton"!

317
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,844
Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty.

318
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,603
As your closest partner in
trade it seems only fitting

319
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,806
that I offer you

320
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,450
your first dance as queen.

321
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,165
One-two, and jump.

322
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,681
Uh...

323
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,849
Thank you. Only, I don't dance.

324
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,046
Oh...

325
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,167
But my sister does.

326
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,481
- What?
- Oh! Lucky you.

327
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,647
Oh, I don't think...

328
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,927
If you swoon, let me know.
I'll catch you.

329
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,765
Sorry.

330
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,649
Like an agile peacock.

331
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,529
Ow! Ow.

332
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,564
Speaking of, so great
to have the gates open.

333
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,722
Why did they shut them
in the first place?

334
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,651
Do you know the reason? Hmm?

335
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,449
- No.
- No.

336
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,891
All right. Hang on!

337
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,845
They don't call me
the "Little Dipper" for nothing!

338
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,001
Oh-ho!

339
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,527
Like a chicken with the face
of a monkey, I fly.

340
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:01,695
Let me know when you're ready

341
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,801
for another round, Milady.

342
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,651
Well, he was sprightly.

343
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,964
Especially for a man in heels.

344
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,650
Are you okay?

345
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,449
I've never been better. This is so nice.

346
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,922
I wish it could be like this all the time.

347
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,760
Me, too.

348
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,601
But it can't.

349
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,682
- Why not?
- It just can't.

350
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,570
Excuse me for a minute.

351
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,049
I'd be honored.

352
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,681
Glad I caught you.

353
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,126
Hans.

354
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,165
Oop.

355
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,602
I often had a whole parlor
to myself to slide!

356
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,603
- Oh!
- Oops!

357
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,051
Sorry.

358
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,451
Your physique helps, I'm sure, too.

359
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,806
Ah.

360
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,407
What's this?

361
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,891
Uh, I was born with it.

362
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,167
Although, I dreamed
I was kissed by a troll.

363
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,720
I like it.

364
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,404
Yeah, the whole thing.

365
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,561
You got it.

366
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,566
Okay, wait, wait.
So, you have how many brothers?

367
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,689
Twelve older brothers.

368
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,088
Three of them pretended I was invisible,

369
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,323
literally, for two years.

370
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,646
That's horrible.

371
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,286
It's what brothers do.

372
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,011
And sisters.

373
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,641
Elsa and I were really close
when we were little.

374
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,122
But then, one day, she just shut me out,

375
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,521
and I never knew why.

376
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,125
I would never shut you out.

377
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,961
Okay, can I just say something crazy?

378
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,566
I love crazy.

379
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,449
<i>All my life has been
A series of doors in my face</i>

380
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,526
<i>And then suddenly
I bump into you</i>

381
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,887
I was thinking the same thing,
because, like...

382
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,042
<i>I've been searching my whole life</i>

383
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,009
<i>To find my own place</i>

384
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,761
<i>And maybe it's the party talking</i>

385
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,881
<i>Or the chocolate fondue</i>

386
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,007
<i>But with you</i>

387
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,242
<i>But with you I found my place</i>

388
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,970
<i>I see your face</i>

389
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,965
<i>And it's nothing like
I've ever known before</i>

390
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,007
<i>Love is an open</i>

391
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,209
<i>Door!</i>

392
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,971
<i>Love is an open</i>

393
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,169
<i>- Door
- Door</i>

394
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,647
<i>Love is an open door</i>

395
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,405
<i>- With you
- With you</i>

396
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,245
<i>Love is an open door</i>

397
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,041
<i>- I mean, it's crazy</i>
- What?

398
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,322
<i>- We finish each other's
- Sandwiches</i>

399
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,686
That's what I was gonna say!

400
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,886
<i>I've never met someone</i>

401
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,962
<i>Who thinks so much like me</i>

402
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,491
Jinx! Jinx again!

403
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,009
<i>Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation</i>

404
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,601
<i>- You
- And I</i>

405
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,681
<i>- Were
- Just</i>

406
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,250
<i>Meant to be</i>

407
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,887
<i>- Say goodbye
- Say goodbye</i>

408
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,804
<i>To the pain of the past</i>

409
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,449
<i>We don't have to feel it anymore</i>

410
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,646
<i>Love is an open door</i>

411
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,085
<i>Love is an open</i>

412
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,249
<i>- Door
- Door</i>

413
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,243
<i>Life can be so much more</i>

414
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,244
<i>- With you
- With you</i>

415
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,606
<i>Love is an open</i>

416
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,162
<i>- Door
- Door</i>

417
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,449
Can I say something crazy?

418
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,444
Will you marry me?

419
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,644
Can I say something even crazier?

420
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,201
Yes!

421
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,569
- Coming through.
- Excuse me. Oh...

422
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,485
- Pardon. Sorry.
- Oh!

423
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,085
Can we just get around you there?

424
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,244
Thank you. Oh! There she is.

425
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,561
Elsa!

426
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,325
I mean, Queen. Me again. Um...

427
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,087
May I present Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

428
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,970
Your Majesty.

429
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,681
We would like...

430
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,761
Uh, your blessing...

431
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,804
Of our marriage.

432
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,084
- Marriage?
- Yes!

433
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,766
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

434
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,081
Well, we haven't worked out
all the details ourselves.

435
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,003
We'll need a few days
to plan the ceremony.

436
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,321
Of course, we'll have soup, roast and ice
cream. And then...

437
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,561
Wait. Would we live here?

438
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,923
- Here?
- Absolutely!

439
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,001
- Anna!
- Oh!

440
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,570
We can invite all 12 of your
brothers to stay with us.

441
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,886
What? No, no, no.

442
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,088
- Of course we have the room.
- Wait, slow down.

443
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,244
No one's brothers are staying here.

444
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,685
No one is getting married.

445
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,446
Wait, what?

446
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,364
May I talk to you, please? Alone.

447
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,601
No. Whatever you have to say,
you can say to both of us.

448
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,006
Fine.
You can't marry a man you just met.

449
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,169
You can if it's true love.

450
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,129
Anna, what do you know
about true love?

451
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,287
More than you.

452
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,124
All you know is how to shut people out.

453
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,971
You asked for my blessing,
but my answer is no.

454
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,687
Now, excuse me.

455
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,370
Your Majesty, if I may ease your...

456
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,560
No, you may not.
And I think you should go.

457
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,725
The party is over. Close the gates.

458
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:01,895
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- What?

459
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,410
Elsa, no, no! Wait.

460
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,601
Give me my glove!

461
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,530
Elsa, please, please.

462
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,404
I can't live like this anymore!

463
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,327
Then leave.

464
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,565
What did I ever do to you?

465
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,846
Enough, Anna.

466
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,968
No, why? Why do you shut me out?

467
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,685
Why do you shut the world out?

468
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,524
What are you so afraid of?

469
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,490
I said, enough!

470
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,006
Sorcery.

471
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,086
I knew there was something
dubious going on here.

472
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,046
Elsa.

473
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,241
There she is!

474
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,287
Yes! It is her!

475
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,486
Queen Elsa.

476
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,250
Our beautiful queen!

477
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,728
Your Majesty? Are you all right?

478
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,081
No.

479
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,046
There she is! Stop her!

480
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,408
Please, just stay away from me.
Stay away.

481
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,762
Monster. Monster!

482
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,806
Elsa!

483
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,724
Elsa!

484
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,080
Wait, please!

485
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,570
Elsa, stop!

486
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,801
Anna!

487
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,001
No.

488
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,966
The fjord.

489
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,724
- Snow!
- Snow?

490
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,127
Yes, snow.

491
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,964
- Are you all right?
- No.

492
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,565
Did you know?

493
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,287
No.

494
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,725
Look, it's snowing. It's snowing!

495
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,444
The queen has cursed this land!

496
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,722
She must be stopped!
You have to go after her.

497
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,040
Wait, no!

498
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,646
You! Is there sorcery in you, too?

499
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,210
Are you a monster, too?

500
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,284
No, no. I'm completely ordinary.

501
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,850
That's right, she is.

502
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,324
In the best way.

503
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,090
And my sister is not a monster.

504
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,730
She nearly killed me!

505
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,325
- You slipped on ice.
- Her ice.

506
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,641
It was an accident. She was scared.

507
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,691
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean any of this.

508
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,521
Tonight was my fault. I pushed her.

509
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,926
So, I'm the one

510
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,246
- that needs to go after her.
- What?

511
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,641
- Bring me my horse, please.
- Anna, no.

512
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,926
It's too dangerous.

513
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,930
Elsa is not dangerous.

514
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,201
I'll bring her back,
and I'll make this right.

515
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,281
I'm coming with you.

516
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,569
No, I need you here
to take care of Arendelle.

517
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,565
On my honor.

518
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,245
I leave Prince Hans in charge.

519
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,925
Are you sure you can trust her?

520
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,971
I don't want you getting hurt.

521
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,601
She's my sister.

522
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,531
She would never hurt me.

523
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,883
<i>The snow glows white
On the mountain tonight</i>

524
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,964
<i>Not a footprint to be seen</i>

525
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,889
<i>A kingdom of isolation</i>

526
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,806
<i>And it looks like
I'm the queen</i>

527
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,488
<i>The wind is howling</i>

528
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,281
<i>Like this swirling storm inside</i>

529
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,162
<i>Couldn't keep it in
Heaven knows I tried</i>

530
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,728
<i>Don't let them in
Don't let them see</i>

531
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,247
<i>Be the good girl
You always have to be</i>

532
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,042
<i>Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know</i>

533
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,489
<i>Well, now they know</i>

534
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,208
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

535
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,569
<i>Can't hold me back anymore</i>

536
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,049
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

537
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,603
<i>Turn away and slam the door</i>

538
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,807
<i>I don't care</i>

539
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,208
<i>What they're going to say</i>

540
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,248
<i>Let the storm rage on</i>

541
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,531
<i>The cold never bothered me anyway</i>

542
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,843
<i>It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small</i>

543
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,883
<i>And the fears that once controlled me</i>

544
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,931
<i>Can't get to me at all</i>

545
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,882
<i>It's time to see what I can do</i>

546
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,407
<i>To test the limits and break through</i>

547
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,965
<i>No right, no wrong</i>

548
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,122
<i>No rules for me</i>

549
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,364
<i>I'm free!</i>

550
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,491
<i>Let it go!</i>

551
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,410
<i>Let it go!</i>

552
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,008
<i>I am one with the wind and sky</i>

553
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,402
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

554
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,128
<i>You'll never see me cry</i>

555
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,208
<i>Here I stand</i>

556
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,931
<i>And here I'll stay</i>

557
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,807
<i>Let the storm rage on</i>

558
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,970
<i>My power flurries through the air</i>

559
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,203
<i>Into the ground</i>

560
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,242
<i>My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals</i>

561
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,448
<i>All around</i>

562
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,880
<i>And one thought crystallizes
Like an icy blast</i>

563
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,486
<i>I'm never going back</i>

564
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,891
<i>The past is in the past</i>

565
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,484
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

566
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,488
<i>And I'll rise like the break of dawn</i>

567
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,809
<i>Let it go!
Let it go!</i>

568
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,001
<i>That perfect girl is gone</i>

569
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,646
<i>Here I stand</i>

570
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,481
<i>In the light of day</i>

571
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,405
<i>Let the storm rage on!</i>

572
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,011
<i>The cold never bothered me anyway</i>

573
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,451
Elsa!

574
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,000
Elsa!

575
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,404
Elsa, it's me, Anna,

576
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,650
your sister who didn't mean
to make you freeze the summer.

577
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,969
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

578
00:35:06,454 --> 00:35:08,055
Of course, none of it
would have happened

579
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,844
if she had just told me her secret.

580
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,011
She's a stinker.

581
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,205
Whoa!

582
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,646
Oh, no. No, no, no! Come back!

583
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,211
No, no, no!

584
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,451
Okay.

585
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,168
Snow. It had to be snow.

586
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,362
She couldn't have had tropical magic

587
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,808
that covered the fjords
in white sand and warm...

588
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,085
Fire!

589
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,530
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.

590
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,524
Ooh. "And sauna"!

591
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,411
- Yoo-hoo.
- Hmm?

592
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,966
Big summer blowout.

593
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,442
Half off swimming suits, clogs,

594
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,206
and a sun balm
of my own invention, yah?

595
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,802
Oh. Great.
For now, um, how about boots?

596
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,124
Winter boots and dresses?

597
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,569
That would be in our winter department.

598
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,931
Oh. Um...

599
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,680
I was just wondering.

600
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,848
Has another young woman...

601
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,651
The queen perhaps, I don't know,

602
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,801
passed through here?

603
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,371
The only one crazy enough
to be out in this storm

604
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,249
is you, dear.

605
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,320
You and this fellow.

606
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,447
Yoo-hoo.

607
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,646
Big summer blowout.

608
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,801
Carrots.

609
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,126
Huh?

610
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,051
Behind you.

611
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,369
Oh! Right. Excuse me.

612
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,642
Oh. A real howler in July, yes?

613
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,204
Wherever could it be coming from?

614
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,411
The North Mountain.

615
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,320
North Mountain.

616
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,046
That Will be 40.

617
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,770
Forty? No, 10.

618
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,927
Oh, dear, that's no good.

619
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,969
See, this is from our winter stock,

620
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,049
where supply and demand
have a big problem.

621
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,162
You want to talk about
a supply and demand problem?

622
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,527
I sell ice for a living.

623
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,960
Ooh. That's a rough business
to be in right now.

624
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,241
I mean, that is really...

625
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,760
That's unfortunate.

626
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,921
Still 40.

627
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,048
But I will throw in
a visit to Oaken's sauna.

628
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,209
Yoo-hoo. Hi, family.

629
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,886
Yoo-hoo!

630
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,641
Ten is all I got. Help me out.

631
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,601
Okay. Ten will get you this and no more.

632
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,001
Okay, just tell me one thing.

633
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,969
What was happening
on the North Mountain?

634
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,769
Did it seem magical?

635
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,450
Yes!

636
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,885
Now, back up while I deal
with this crook, here.

637
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,451
What did you call me?

638
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,210
Okay, okay. I'm out.

639
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,721
Whoa!

640
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,086
Bye-bye.

641
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,241
No, Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

642
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,164
But I did find us a place to sleep.

643
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,370
And it's free.

644
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,291
I'm sorry about this violence.

645
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,050
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

646
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,891
so we have good feelings.

647
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,730
Just the outfit and the boots, yah?

648
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,161
Uh...

649
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,684
<i>Reindeers are better than people</i>

650
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,643
<i>Sven, don't you think that's true?</i>

651
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,089
<i>"Yeah, people will beat you
And curse you and cheat you"</i>

652
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,641
<i>"Every one of them's bad, except you"</i>

653
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,604
Aw. Thanks, buddy.

654
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,249
<i>But people smell better than reindeers</i>

655
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,565
<i>Sven, don't you think I'm right?</i>

656
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,967
<i>"That's once again true
For all, except you"</i>

657
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,410
<i>You got me
Let's call it a night</i>

658
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,209
<i>"Good night"</i>

659
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,925
<i>Don't let the frostbite</i>

660
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,401
<i>Bite</i>

661
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,645
Nice duet.

662
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,726
It's just you.
What do you want?

663
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,362
I want you to take me up
the North Mountain.

664
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,290
I don't take people places.

665
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,685
Let me rephrase that.

666
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,205
Hey.

667
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,286
Take me up the North Mountain.

668
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,964
Please.

669
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,162
Look, I know how to stop this winter.

670
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,130
We leave at dawn.

671
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,722
And you forgot the carrots for Sven.

672
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,926
Oops, sorry.

673
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,287
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

674
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,007
We leave now. Right now.

675
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,286
Whew!

676
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,322
Hang on! We like to go fast.

677
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,801
- I like fast.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

678
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,570
Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.

679
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,130
Seriously, were you raised in a barn?

680
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,526
Ugh!

681
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,286
- No, I was raised in a castle.
- Hmm.

682
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,205
So, uh, tell me,

683
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,443
what made the queen go all ice-crazy?

684
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,681
Oh. Well...

685
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,440
It was all my fault.

686
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,047
I got engaged, but then she freaked out,

687
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,771
because I'd only just met him,
you know, that day.

688
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,770
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage, and...

689
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,362
Wait. You got engaged
to someone you just met that day?

690
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,683
Yeah.
Anyway, I got mad, and so she got mad,

691
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,761
and then she tried to walk away,

692
00:40:54,815 --> 00:40:55,855
and I grabbed her glove...

693
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,881
Hang on!

694
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,929
You mean to tell me you got engaged

695
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,606
to someone you just met that day?

696
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,920
Yes. Pay attention.

697
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,130
But the thing is,
she wore the gloves all the time,

698
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,441
so I just thought,
maybe she has a thing about dirt.

699
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,484
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

700
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,969
Yes, they did.

701
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,761
But Hans is not a stranger.

702
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,850
Oh, yeah? What's his last name?

703
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,406
"Of the Southern Isles."

704
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,891
- What's his favorite food?
- Sandwiches.

705
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,331
- Best friend's name?
- Probably John.

706
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,447
- Eye color?
- Dreamy.

707
00:41:25,494 --> 00:41:27,055
- Foot size?
- Foot size doesn't matter.

708
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,286
Have you had a meal with him yet?

709
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,845
What if you hate the way he eats?

710
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,331
What if you hate
the way he picks his nose?

711
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,601
Picks his nose?

712
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,927
And eats it.

713
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,401
Excuse me, sir. He is a prince.

714
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,925
- All men do it.
- Ew.

715
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,410
Look, it doesn't matter. It's true love.

716
00:41:42,495 --> 00:41:43,775
It doesn't sound like true love.

717
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,326
Are you some
sort of love expert?

718
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,606
No. But, uh, I have friends who are.

719
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,160
You have friends

720
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,561
who are love experts? I'm not buying it.

721
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,130
- Stop talking.
- No, no, no. No, no.

722
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,040
- I'd like to meet these...
- No, I mean it.

723
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,961
Sven, go.

724
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,207
Go!

725
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,291
- What are they?
- Wolves.

726
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,527
Wolves?

727
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,411
- What do we do?
- I got this.

728
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,687
You just...
Don't fall off, and don't get eaten.

729
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,727
But I want to help!

730
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,847
- No.
- Why not?

731
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,921
Because I don't trust your judgment.

732
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,206
Excuse me?

733
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,044
Who marries a man she just met?

734
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,360
It's true love!

735
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,601
Whoa!

736
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,091
Whoa. Whoa!

737
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,685
Christopher!

738
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,251
It's "Kristoff"!

739
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,651
Ow!

740
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,007
Duck!

741
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,651
You almost set me on fire!

742
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,761
But I didn't.

743
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,646
Get ready to jump, Sven!

744
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,171
You don't tell him what to do.

745
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,645
- Hey!
- I do!

746
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,761
Jump, Sven!

747
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,921
Phew!

748
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,686
But I just paid it off.

749
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,844
Uh-oh. No. No.

750
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,447
No!

751
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,249
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

752
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,481
Grab on!

753
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,126
Pull, Sven. Pull!

754
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,090
Whoa.

755
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,488
I'll replace your sled,
and everything in it.

756
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,081
And I understand
if you don't want to help me anymore.

757
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,246
Of course I don't want to help
her anymore. In fact,

758
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,963
this whole thing has ruined me
for helping anyone ever again.

759
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,007
It's this way?

760
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,048
"She'll die on her own."

761
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,884
- I can live with that.
- Here we go.

762
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,124
"But you won't get
your new sled if she's dead."

763
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,731
I think, actually, it's up.

764
00:44:09,975 --> 00:44:11,375
Sometimes, I really don't like you.

765
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,721
Hold up! We're coming.

766
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,327
You are?

767
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,483
I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along.

768
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,005
Arendelle.

769
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,728
It's completely frozen.

770
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,006
But it will be fine. Elsa will thaw it.

771
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,366
Will she?

772
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,044
Yeah. Now, come on.

773
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,884
This way to the North Mountain?

774
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,446
More like this way.

775
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,962
I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.

776
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,360
Yeah.

777
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,483
It really is beautiful, isn't it?

778
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,161
But it's so white.

779
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,410
You know, how about a little color?

780
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,849
I'm thinking maybe some
crimson, chartreuse.

781
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,445
How about yellow?

782
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,763
No, not yellow. Yellow and snow?

783
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,411
No go.

784
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,730
Am I right?

785
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,161
- Hi.
- You're creepy.

786
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,526
- Whoa!
- I don't want it.

787
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,005
- Back at you.
- Please don't drop me.

788
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,286
- No.
- Come on, it's just a head.

789
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,600
All right. We got off to a bad start.

790
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,886
Ew, ew, ew, the body!

791
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,730
Wait, what am I looking at right now?

792
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,451
Why are you hanging off
the earth like a bat?

793
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,851
All right, wait one second.

794
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,331
Oh. Uh...

795
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,686
Oh!

796
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,125
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

797
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,327
Now, I'm perfect.

798
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,886
Well, almost.

799
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,120
It was like my whole life
got turned upside down.

800
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,241
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!

801
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:17,335
- Head rush!
- I was just... Are you okay?

802
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,682
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!

803
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,530
I've always wanted a nose.

804
00:46:22,815 --> 00:46:24,095
So cute.

805
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,804
It's like a little baby unicorn.

806
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,927
But... Hey! Whoa!

807
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,967
Oh.

808
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,849
I love it even more.

809
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,885
All right,
let's start this thing over.

810
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,167
Hi, everyone.

811
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,241
I'm Olaf.

812
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,526
And I like warm hugs.

813
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,081
Olaf?

814
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,209
That's right. Olaf.

815
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,408
And you are?

816
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,881
Oh. Um...

817
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,161
I'm Anna.

818
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,607
And who's the funky-looking
donkey over there?

819
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,170
- That's Sven.
- Uh-huh.

820
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,129
And who's the reindeer?

821
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,167
Sven.

822
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,005
Oh, the... Oh. Okay.
That makes things easier for me.

823
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,560
Aw, look at him
trying to kiss my nose.

824
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,683
- I like you, too.
- Olaf.

825
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,322
- Did Elsa build you?
- Yeah. Why?

826
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,641
Do you know where she is?

827
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,841
- Fascinating.
- Yeah. Why?

828
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,440
Do you think you could
show us the way?

829
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,481
Yeah. Why?

830
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,046
How does this work? Ow!

831
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,282
Stop it, Sven. I'm trying to focus, here.

832
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,362
- Yeah. Why?
- I'll tell you why.

833
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,445
We need Elsa to bring back summer.

834
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,450
- Summer?
- Mmm-hmm.

835
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,760
Oh. I don't know why,

836
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,526
but I've always loved
the idea of summer.

837
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,082
And sun, and all things hot.

838
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,201
Really?

839
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,760
I'm guessing you
don't have much experience with heat.

840
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,921
Nope.

841
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,681
But sometimes I like to close my eyes,

842
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,606
and imagine what it would be
like when summer does come.

843
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,049
<i>Bees will buzz
Kids will blow dandelion fuzz</i>

844
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,887
<i>And I'll be doing
Whatever snow does in summer</i>

845
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,767
<i>A drink in my hand</i>

846
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,161
<i>My snow up against the burning sand</i>

847
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,447
<i>Probably getting gorgeously tanned</i>

848
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,090
<i>In summer</i>

849
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,802
<i>I'll finally see a summer breeze</i>

850
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,928
<i>Blow away a winter storm</i>

851
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,207
<i>And find out what happens
to solid water</i>

852
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,011
<i>When it gets warm</i>

853
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,888
<i>And I can't wait to see</i>

854
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,843
<i>What my buddies all think of me</i>

855
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,721
<i>Just imagine how much cooler I'll be</i>

856
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,007
<i>In summer!</i>

857
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,568
<i>The hot and the cold
are both so intense</i>

858
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,047
<i>Put them together
It just makes sense</i>

859
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,568
<i>Winter's a good time
To stay in and cuddle</i>

860
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,523
<i>But put me in summer and I'll be a...</i>

861
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,524
<i>Happy snowman!</i>

862
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,726
<i>When life gets rough</i>

863
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,201
<i>I like to hold on to my dream</i>

864
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,207
<i>Relaxing in the summer sun
Just letting off steam</i>

865
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,445
<i>Oh, the sky</i>

866
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,085
<i>Will be blue</i>

867
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,524
<i>And you guys will be there, too</i>

868
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,600
<i>When I finally do</i>

869
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,968
<i>What frozen things do
In summer!</i>

870
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,684
- I'm gonna tell him.
- Don't you dare.

871
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,487
<i>In summer!</i>

872
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,481
So, come on! Elsa's this way.

873
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,689
Let's go bring back summer!

874
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm coming!

875
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,325
Somebody's gotta tell him.

876
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,961
No, no. You've got the bark facing down.

877
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,565
The bark needs to be face-up.

878
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,167
- Bark down is drier.
- Bark up!

879
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,207
- Bark down!
- Papa!

880
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,884
Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak?

881
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,004
Arendelle is indebted to you,
Your Highness.

882
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,486
The castle is open.

883
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,530
There is soup and hot glogg
in the great hall.

884
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,847
Here, pass these out.

885
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,285
Prince Hans!

886
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,926
Are we expected
to just sit here and freeze

887
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,446
while you give away all
of Arendelle's tradable goods?

888
00:50:00,975 --> 00:50:02,375
Princess Anna has given her orders.

889
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,129
And that's another thing!

890
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,726
Has it dawned on you
that your princess may be conspiring

891
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,926
with a wicked Sorceress

892
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,121
to destroy us all?

893
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,770
Do not question the princess.

894
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,411
She left me in charge

895
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,720
and I will not hesitate

896
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,325
to protect Arendelle from treason.

897
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,130
Treason?

898
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,647
Whoa! Whoa!

899
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,449
Whoa, boy. Easy.

900
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,601
Easy.

901
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,120
It's Princess Anna's horse.

902
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,725
So, where is the princess?

903
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,120
- Where could she be?
- Where is she?

904
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,605
Princess Anna is in trouble.

905
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,085
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her.

906
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,321
- I'll go.
- I volunteer.

907
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,368
I volunteer two men, My Lord.

908
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,291
Be prepared for anything.

909
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,642
And should you encounter the queen,

910
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,766
you are to put an end to this winter.

911
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,891
- Do you understand?
- Hmm.

912
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,005
So, how exactly
are you planning to stop this weather?

913
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,881
Oh. I am gonna talk to my sister.

914
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,321
That's your plan?

915
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,290
My ice business is riding on
you talking to your sister?

916
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,566
Yep.

917
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,685
So, you're not at all afraid of her?

918
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,690
- Why would I be?
- Yeah.

919
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,443
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.

920
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,650
Oh. Look at that.

921
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,007
I've been impaled.

922
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,327
What now?

923
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,809
Mmm...

924
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,727
It's too steep.

925
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,246
I've only got one rope and you don't
know how to climb mountains.

926
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,606
Says who?

927
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,920
Hmm?

928
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,361
What are you doing?

929
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,446
I'm going to see my sister.

930
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,041
You're gonna kill yourself.

931
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,761
I wouldn't put my foot there.

932
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,490
- You're distracting me.
- Or there.

933
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,563
How do you know
Elsa even wants to see you?

934
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,320
All right. I'm just blocking you out

935
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,051
because I gotta concentrate, here.

936
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,840
You know, most people who disappear

937
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,360
into the mountains want to be alone.

938
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,682
Nobody wants to be alone.

939
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,247
Except maybe you.

940
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,449
I'm not alone. I have friends, remember?

941
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,164
You mean, the love experts?

942
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,363
Yes, the love experts.

943
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,564
Ah...

944
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,890
Please tell me I'm almost there.

945
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,362
Does the air seem a bit thin
to you up here?

946
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,041
Hang on.

947
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,121
Hey, Sven?

948
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,129
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem,

949
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,208
but I found a staircase that leads exactly

950
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,406
where you wanted to go.

951
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,403
Ha-ha! Thank goodness. Catch!

952
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,686
Thanks.
That was like a crazy trust exercise.

953
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,686
Whoa.

954
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,603
Now, that's ice.

955
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,726
I might cry.

956
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,371
Go ahead. I won't judge.

957
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,609
All right, take it easy, boy. Come here.

958
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,285
I got you.

959
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,127
Okay. You stay right here, buddy.

960
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,406
Flawless.

961
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,681
Knock.

962
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,011
Just knock.

963
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,570
Why isn't she knocking?

964
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,965
Do you think she knows how to knock?

965
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,882
Huh. It opened.

966
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,246
That's a first.

967
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,446
Oh. You should probably wait out here.

968
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,488
- What?
- The last time I introduced her to a guy,

969
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,926
she froze everything.

970
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,843
But, but... Oh, come on!

971
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,685
It's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life!

972
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,927
Bye, Sven.

973
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,570
You, too, Olaf.

974
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,729
- Me?
- Just give us a minute.

975
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,326
Okay.

976
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,090
One, two,

977
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,524
- three...
- Four...

978
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,081
Whoa.

979
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,361
Elsa?

980
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,243
It's me, Anna.

981
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,765
Anna.

982
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,962
Whoa. Elsa, you look different.

983
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,090
It's a good different.

984
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,726
And this place...

985
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,366
It's amazing.

986
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,681
Thank you.

987
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,082
I never knew what I was capable of.

988
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,405
I'm so sorry about what happened.
If I'd have known...

989
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,606
No, no, no. It's okay.

990
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,890
You don't have to apologize,
but you should probably go.

991
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,807
Please.

992
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,041
But I just got here.

993
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,364
You belong down in Arendelle.

994
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,801
So do you.

995
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,008
No, Anna, I belong here.

996
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,201
Alone.

997
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,650
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.

998
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,883
Actually, about that...

999
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,170
- Sixty!
- Wait. What is that?

1000
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,326
Hi! I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs!

1001
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,167
Olaf?

1002
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,081
Yeah. You built me.

1003
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,841
Remember that?

1004
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,447
And you're alive?

1005
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,402
Um... I think so.

1006
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,486
He's just like the one we built as kids.

1007
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,846
Yeah.

1008
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,249
Elsa, we were so close.

1009
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,324
We can be like that again.

1010
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,480
<i>- Catch me!</i>
<i>- Slow down!</i>

1011
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,961
Anna!

1012
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,687
No.

1013
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,240
We can't. Goodbye, Anna.

1014
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,481
Elsa, wait.

1015
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,608
No, I'm just trying to protect you.

1016
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,411
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.

1017
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,083
Please don't shut me out again.

1018
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,442
<i>Please don't slam the door</i>

1019
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,411
<i>You don't have to keep
Your distance anymore</i>

1020
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,410
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

1021
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,689
<i>I finally understand</i>

1022
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,087
<i>For the first time in forever</i>

1023
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,367
<i>We can fix this hand in hand</i>

1024
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,408
We can head down
this mountain together.

1025
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,524
<i>You don't have to live in fear</i>

1026
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,361
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

1027
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,769
<i>I Will be right here</i>

1028
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,001
Anna.

1029
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,043
<i>Please go back home</i>

1030
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,690
<i>Your life awaits</i>

1031
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,128
<i>Go enjoy the sun
And open up the gates</i>

1032
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,651
- Yeah, but...
- I know.

1033
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,850
<i>You mean well
But leave me be</i>

1034
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,485
<i>Yes, I'm alone</i>

1035
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,404
<i>But I'm alone and free</i>

1036
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,082
<i>Just stay away
And you'll be safe from me</i>

1037
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,321
<i>Actually, we're not</i>

1038
00:56:43,575 --> 00:56:44,735
<i>What do you mean, you're not?</i>

1039
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,250
<i>I get the feeling you don't know</i>

1040
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,481
<i>What do I not know?</i>

1041
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,322
<i>Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep</i>

1042
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,482
<i>Deep snow</i>

1043
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,841
What?

1044
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,802
You kind of set off
an eternal winter everywhere.

1045
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,201
Everywhere?

1046
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,089
Well, it's okay, you can just unfreeze it.

1047
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,328
No, I can't. I don't know how.

1048
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,881
Sure you can. I know you can.

1049
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,601
<i>'Cause for the first time in forever</i>

1050
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,447
<i>Oh, I'm such a fool!
I can't be free!</i>

1051
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,682
<i>You don't have to be afraid</i>

1052
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,764
<i>No escape from the storm inside of me</i>

1053
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,763
<i>We can work this out together</i>

1054
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,604
<i>I can't control the curse!</i>

1055
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,849
<i>We'll reverse the storm you've made</i>

1056
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,044
<i>Anna, please you'll only make it worse!</i>

1057
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,202
<i>Don't panic
There's so much fear!</i>

1058
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,765
<i>We'll make the sun shine bright</i>

1059
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,251
<i>You're not safe here!</i>

1060
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,970
<i>We can face this thing together</i>

1061
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,041
<i>No!</i>

1062
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,202
<i>We can change this winter weather</i>

1063
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,568
<i>And everything will be all right</i>

1064
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,561
<i>I can't!</i>

1065
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,241
Anna!

1066
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,001
Are you okay?

1067
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,406
I'm okay.

1068
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,720
I'm fine.

1069
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,081
Who's this?

1070
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,571
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...

1071
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,121
You have to go.

1072
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,885
No, I know we can
figure this out together.

1073
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,001
How?

1074
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,242
What power do you have
to stop this winter?

1075
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,846
To stop me?

1076
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,485
Anna, I think we should go.

1077
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,449
No, I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.

1078
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,244
Yes, you are.

1079
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,730
Stop! Put us down!

1080
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,404
Go away.

1081
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,365
Heads up!

1082
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,366
Watch out for my butt!

1083
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,885
It is not nice to throw people!

1084
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,122
Whoa, whoa, whoa, feisty-pants.
Okay, relax.

1085
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,521
- Just calm down! Calm down!
- Okay! All right!

1086
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,204
- I'm okay.
- Just let the snowman be.

1087
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,441
- I'm calm.
- Great.

1088
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,125
Oh! Come on!

1089
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:54,815
Oh. Look, see?
Now, you made him mad.

1090
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,604
I'll distract him. You guys go.

1091
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,131
No, no! Not you guys!

1092
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,480
This just got
a whole lot harder.

1093
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,121
Look out!

1094
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,484
Run! Run!

1095
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,563
What are you doing?

1096
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,241
I got him!

1097
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,085
Whoa! Stop!

1098
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,241
It's a 100-foot drop.

1099
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,807
It's 200.

1100
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,321
Ow!

1101
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,048
- What's that for?
- I'm digging a snow anchor.

1102
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,690
Okay. What if we fall?

1103
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,000
There's 20 feet of fresh
powder down there.

1104
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,804
It'll be like landing on a pillow.

1105
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,881
Hopefully.

1106
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,129
Okay, Anna. On three.

1107
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,486
- Okay.
- One...

1108
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,561
You tell me when. I'm ready to go.

1109
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,210
- Two...
- I was born ready! Yes!

1110
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,361
Calm down.

1111
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,481
Tree!

1112
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,761
What the... Whoa!

1113
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,404
That happened.

1114
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,449
Man, am I out of shape.

1115
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,449
There we go. Hey, Anna!

1116
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,284
Sven! Where did you guys go?

1117
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,011
We totally lost Marshmallow back there.

1118
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,881
Hey! We were just talking about you.

1119
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,008
All good things, all good things.

1120
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,521
No!

1121
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,045
This is not making much
of a difference, is it?

1122
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,721
Olaf!

1123
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,564
Hang in there, guys!

1124
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,887
Go. Go faster!

1125
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,610
- Wait, what?
- Hey!

1126
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,530
Ow!

1127
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,886
Kristoff!

1128
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,608
Don't come back!

1129
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,321
We won't.

1130
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,284
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.

1131
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,686
Olaf!

1132
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,926
I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!

1133
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,409
- Those are my legs.
- Ooh!

1134
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,925
Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.

1135
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,969
Oh. That feels better.

1136
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,721
Hey, Sven! He found us.

1137
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,083
Who's my cute little reindeer?

1138
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,083
Don't talk to him like that.

1139
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,964
You're tickling me.

1140
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,081
Here.

1141
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,521
Whoa!

1142
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,726
Are you okay?

1143
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,165
Thank you.

1144
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,326
- How's your head?
- Ah! Ooh!

1145
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,360
It's fine. Uh...

1146
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,965
Uh, I'm good. I've got a thick skull.

1147
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,929
I don't have a skull.

1148
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,721
Or bones.

1149
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,441
So, uh... So, now what?

1150
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,724
Now what?

1151
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,086
Now what?

1152
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,281
Oh...

1153
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,840
What am I gonna do?

1154
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,771
She threw me out.

1155
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,127
I can't go back to Arendelle
with the weather like this.

1156
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,201
And then there's your ice business.

1157
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,806
Hey, hey.
Don't worry about my ice business.

1158
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,684
- Worry about your hair!
- What?

1159
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,569
I just fell off a cliff.
You should see your hair.

1160
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,165
No, yours is turning white.

1161
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,091
White? It's... What?

1162
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,282
It's because she struck you, isn't it?

1163
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,490
Does it look bad?

1164
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,931
- No.
- You hesitated.

1165
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,087
No, I didn't.

1166
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,488
Anna, you need help, okay? Come on.

1167
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,050
Okay! Where are we going?

1168
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,287
To see my friends.

1169
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,600
The love experts?

1170
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,330
- Love experts?
- Uh-huh.

1171
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,007
And don't worry,
they'll be able to fix this.

1172
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,810
How do you know?

1173
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,523
Because I've seen them do it before.

1174
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,081
I like to consider myself a love expert.

1175
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,370
Get it together.

1176
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,411
Control it.

1177
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,164
Don't feel. Don't feel.

1178
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,290
Don't feel.

1179
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,124
Don't feel!

1180
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,207
Look, Sven, the sky is awake.

1181
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,369
- Are you cold?
- A little.

1182
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,883
Uh...
Wait. Come here.

1183
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,041
Huh?

1184
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,051
Ooh.

1185
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,728
So, uh, about my friends. Well...

1186
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,206
I say "friends"...

1187
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,328
They're more like family.

1188
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,210
Anyway, when I was a kid,
it was just me and Sven.

1189
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,289
Until they, you know, kinda took us in.

1190
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,165
- They did?
- Yeah.

1191
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,607
I don't want to scare you.

1192
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,004
They can be a little
inappropriate and loud.

1193
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,485
Very loud.

1194
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,609
They are also stubborn at times,

1195
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,886
and a little overbearing.

1196
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,645
And heavy. Really, really, heavy.

1197
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,047
But you'll get it.
They mean well.

1198
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,248
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

1199
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,771
Okay, then.

1200
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,289
Meet my family.

1201
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,201
Hey, guys.

1202
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,250
They're rocks.

1203
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,727
You are a sight for sore eyes.

1204
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,531
He's crazy.

1205
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,288
Rocko's looking sharp, as usual.

1206
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,847
Clay, whoa... I don't even recognize you.

1207
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,921
You lost so much weight.

1208
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,930
I'll distract him while you run.

1209
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,923
Hi, Sven's family!

1210
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,601
It's nice to meet you.

1211
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,361
Because I love you,
Anna, I insist you run.

1212
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,331
I understand
you're love experts. Ooh!

1213
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,290
Why aren't you running?

1214
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,726
Uh...

1215
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,087
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go.

1216
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,244
- Go.
- No, no, no. Anna, wait.

1217
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,290
Kristoff!

1218
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,244
Whoa!

1219
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,966
Hey!

1220
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,365
Kristoff's home!

1221
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,769
- Kristoff's here!
- Kristoff's home!

1222
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,127
- Wait, "Kristoff"?
- Uh-huh.

1223
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,731
Ah, let me look at you.

1224
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,404
Take off your clothes, I wash them.

1225
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,164
No! No, I'm going to keep my clothes on.

1226
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,731
Look, it's great to see you all,

1227
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,926
but where's Granpabbie?

1228
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,087
He's napping.

1229
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,844
But look, I grew a mushroom.

1230
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,485
- I...
- I earned my fire crystal.

1231
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,800
I passed a kidney stone.

1232
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,166
Kristoff, pick me up.

1233
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,526
You're getting big.

1234
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,681
Good for you.

1235
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,368
Trolls. They're trolls!

1236
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,924
He's brought a girl!

1237
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,686
A girl!

1238
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,684
- Whoa!
- Is that a real girl?

1239
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,808
She's like a little cupcake.

1240
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,881
What's going on?

1241
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,086
I've learned to just roll with it.

1242
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,800
Let me see. Bright eyes, working nose,

1243
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,211
strong teeth!

1244
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,165
Yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

1245
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,441
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, um, no.

1246
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,851
- No.
- You've got the wrong idea.

1247
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,001
No. That's not why I brought her here.

1248
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,889
Right. We're not... I'm not...

1249
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,962
What's the issue, dear?

1250
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,243
Why are you holding back
from such a man?

1251
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,129
<i>Is it the clumpy way he walks?</i>

1252
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,601
- What?
<i>- Or the grumpy way he talks?</i>

1253
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,440
- Oh, no.
<i>- Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped</i>

1254
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,970
<i>Weirdness of his feet?</i>

1255
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,087
Hey!

1256
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,049
<i>And though we know he washes well</i>

1257
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,600
<i>He always ends up sort of smelly</i>

1258
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,330
<i>But you'll never meet a fella</i>

1259
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,289
<i>Who's as sensitive and sweet</i>

1260
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,407
That's nice, but...

1261
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,403
<i>So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1262
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,522
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
<i>- So, he's got a few flaws</i>

1263
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,761
<i>Like his peculiar brain, dear</i>

1264
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,921
<i>His thing with the reindeer</i>

1265
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,604
<i>That's a little outside
of nature's laws</i>

1266
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,727
This is not about me!

1267
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,484
<i>So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1268
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,688
<i>But this we're certain of</i>

1269
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,331
<i>You can fix this fixer-upper up</i>

1270
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,129
<i>- With a little bit of love</i>
- Um...

1271
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,168
Can we please
just stop talking about this?

1272
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,402
We've got a real, actual problem, here.

1273
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,881
I'll say. So, tell me, dear...

1274
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,289
<i>Is it the way that he runs scared?</i>

1275
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,249
<i>Or that he's socially impaired?</i>

1276
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,803
<i>Or that he only likes
To tinkle in the woods?</i>

1277
01:06:33,854 --> 01:06:34,975
I did not need to know that.

1278
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,128
<i>Are you holding back your fondness</i>

1279
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,571
<i>Due to his unmanly blondness?</i>

1280
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,203
<i>Or the way he covers up
That he's the honest goods?</i>

1281
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,409
<i>He's just a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1282
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,965
<i>He's got a couple of bugs</i>

1283
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,850
- No, I don't!
<i>- His isolation is confirmation</i>

1284
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,764
<i>- Of his desperation for healing hugs</i>
- Aw.

1285
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,410
<i>So, he's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1286
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,131
<i>But we know what to do</i>

1287
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,208
<i>The way to fix up this fixer-upper</i>

1288
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,770
<i>Is to fix him up with you</i>

1289
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,330
Whoa!

1290
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,965
Stop it, stop it, stop it! Enough!

1291
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,166
She is engaged to someone else, okay?

1292
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,008
<i>So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1293
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,809
<i>That's a minor thing</i>

1294
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,282
<i>Her quote "engagement"
Is a flex arrangement</i>

1295
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,767
<i>And by the way, I don't see no ring</i>

1296
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,047
<i>So, she's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1297
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,122
- Hey! Whoa, watch it!
<i>- Her brain's a bit betwixt</i>

1298
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,727
<i>Get the fiancé out of the way</i>

1299
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,121
<i>And the whole thing will be fixed</i>

1300
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,808
<i>We're not saying you can change him</i>

1301
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,849
<i>'Cause people don't really change</i>

1302
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,601
<i>We're only saying that love's a force</i>

1303
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,967
<i>That's powerful and strange</i>

1304
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,202
<i>People make bad choices</i>

1305
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,487
<i>If they're mad or scared or stressed</i>

1306
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,725
<i>But throw a little love their way</i>

1307
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,087
<i>Throw a little love their way</i>

1308
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,083
<i>And you'll bring out their best</i>

1309
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,488
<i>True love brings out the best</i>

1310
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,167
<i>Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1311
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,250
<i>That's what it's all about</i>

1312
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,321
- Father!
- Sister!

1313
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,131
- Brother!
<i>- We need each other to raise us up</i>

1314
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,361
<i>And round us out</i>

1315
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,889
<i>Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper</i>

1316
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,362
<i>But when push comes to shove</i>

1317
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,686
<i>The only fixer-upper fixer</i>

1318
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,761
<i>That can fix a fixer-upper is...</i>

1319
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,162
<i>True, true</i>

1320
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,327
<i>True</i>

1321
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,401
<i>Love!</i>

1322
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,766
<i>Love, love, love</i>

1323
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,763
<i>Love
True love</i>

1324
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,921
<i>True</i>

1325
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,130
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff
to be your trollfully wedded...

1326
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,089
- Wait, what?
- You're getting married.

1327
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,241
Love!

1328
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,401
Anna?

1329
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,606
She's as cold as ice.

1330
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,970
There is strange magic here.

1331
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,363
- Granpabbie.
- Come, come. Bring her here to me.

1332
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,525
Anna, your life is in danger.

1333
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,124
There is ice in your heart
put there by your sister.

1334
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,448
If not removed,
to solid ice will you freeze, forever.

1335
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,166
What? No.

1336
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,526
But you can remove it, right?

1337
01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,727
I cannot.

1338
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,689
I'm sorry, Kristoff.

1339
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,287
If it was her head, that would be easy.

1340
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,201
But only an act of true love
can thaw a frozen heart.

1341
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,605
An act of true love?

1342
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,967
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

1343
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,207
- Something's wrong.
- Are you all right?

1344
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,806
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.

1345
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,927
Hans.

1346
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,001
Pull us out, Sven.

1347
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,166
Olaf, come on!

1348
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,885
I'm coming!

1349
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,163
Let's go kiss Hans!

1350
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,284
Who is this Hans?

1351
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,289
We are here to find Princess Anna.

1352
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,242
Be on guard,
but no harm is to come to the queen.

1353
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,801
Do you understand?

1354
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,721
Yes, Your Grace.

1355
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,291
The queen.

1356
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,368
Go, go! Come on!

1357
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,687
There!

1358
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,367
Up there!

1359
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,125
Come on!

1360
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,881
We got her.

1361
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,720
No. Please.

1362
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,330
Go around. Toss it.

1363
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,686
Stay away!

1364
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,126
Look out!

1365
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,770
Fire! Fire!

1366
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,046
Get her!

1367
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,121
Ah!

1368
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,726
Come on!

1369
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,807
Grab his arm.

1370
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,241
Aim...

1371
01:11:46,015 --> 01:11:47,215
This way, this way!

1372
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,241
Whoa!

1373
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,647
Queen Elsa!

1374
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,561
Don't be the monster they fear you are.

1375
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,727
Oh, no. What have... What have I done?

1376
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,291
Why did you bring me here?

1377
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,285
I couldn't just let them kill you.

1378
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,569
But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.

1379
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,122
Anna has not returned.

1380
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,848
If you would just stop the winter.

1381
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,646
Bring back summer, please.

1382
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,445
Don't you see?

1383
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,080
I can't.

1384
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,081
You have to tell them to let me go.

1385
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,689
I will do what I can.

1386
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,920
Just hang in there.

1387
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,161
Come on, buddy, faster!

1388
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,281
Oh, boy!

1389
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,362
Whoa! I'll meet you guys at the castle!

1390
01:13:57,614 --> 01:13:58,975
Stay out of sight, Olaf.

1391
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,525
I will!

1392
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,961
- Hello!
- It's alive!

1393
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,525
It's Princess Anna!

1394
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,769
Are you gonna be okay?

1395
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,609
Don't worry about me.

1396
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,444
Anna!

1397
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,363
- You had us worried sick.
- My Lady.

1398
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,364
Get her warm.
And find Prince Hans, immediately.

1399
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,851
We will. Thank you.

1400
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,531
Make sure she's safe.

1401
01:14:39,015 --> 01:14:40,655
Oh, you poor girl,
you're freezing.

1402
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,889
Oh, let's get you inside now
and get you warm.

1403
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,289
I'm going back out
to look for Princess Anna.

1404
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,050
You cannot risk going out there again.

1405
01:15:01,415 --> 01:15:02,575
If anything happens to her...

1406
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,364
If anything happens to the princess,

1407
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,927
you are all Arendelle has left.

1408
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,449
He's in here.

1409
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,567
Prince Hans.

1410
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,926
Anna.

1411
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,127
You're so cold.

1412
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,361
- Hans, you have to kiss me.
- What?

1413
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,090
- Now! Now!
- Slow down.

1414
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,889
We'll give you two some privacy.

1415
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:20,966
What happened out there?

1416
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,929
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1417
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,605
You said she would never hurt you.

1418
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,681
I was wrong.

1419
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,125
Anna.

1420
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,490
She froze my heart,

1421
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,166
and only an act of true love can save me.

1422
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,604
A true love's kiss.

1423
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,960
Oh, Anna.

1424
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,450
If only there was
someone out there who loved you.

1425
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,800
What?

1426
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,084
You said you did.

1427
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,125
As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom,

1428
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,406
I didn't stand a chance.

1429
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,166
I knew I would have to marry
into the throne somewhere.

1430
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,640
What... What are you talking about?

1431
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,567
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.

1432
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,729
But no one was getting
anywhere with her.

1433
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,841
- But you...
- Hans!

1434
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,365
You were so desperate for love,

1435
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,171
you were willing
to marry me just like that.

1436
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,529
I figured after we married,

1437
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,608
I would have to stage
a little accident for Elsa.

1438
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,848
Hans!
No. Stop.

1439
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,088
But then, she doomed herself,

1440
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,049
and you were dumb enough
to go after her.

1441
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,167
Please.

1442
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,720
All that's left now is to kill Elsa,

1443
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,771
and bring back summer.

1444
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,368
You're no match for Elsa.

1445
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,647
No, you're no match for Elsa.

1446
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,481
I, on the other hand,

1447
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,529
am the hero who is going to save
Arendelle from destruction.

1448
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,811
You won't get away with this.

1449
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,407
Oh...

1450
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,611
I already have.

1451
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,124
Please, somebody, help.

1452
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,923
Please. Please.

1453
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,929
It's getting colder by the minute.

1454
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,641
If we don't do something soon,
we'll all freeze to death.

1455
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,131
Prince Hans.

1456
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,243
Princess Anna is...

1457
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,167
Dead.

1458
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,280
What?

1459
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,810
What happened to her?

1460
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,250
She was killed.

1461
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,960
By Queen Elsa.

1462
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,127
No!

1463
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,481
Her own sister.

1464
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,767
At least we got to say our marriage vows

1465
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,082
before she died in my arms.

1466
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,530
There can be no doubt now.

1467
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,325
Queen Elsa is a monster,

1468
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,323
and we are all in grave danger.

1469
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,721
Prince Hans,

1470
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,283
Arendelle looks to you.

1471
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,644
With a heavy heart,

1472
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,691
I charge Queen Elsa
of Arendelle with treason.

1473
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,768
And sentence her to death.

1474
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,281
Hurry up!

1475
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,561
She's dangerous.

1476
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,040
- Move quickly.
- Careful.

1477
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,050
- It won't open!
- It's frozen shut.

1478
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,520
Put your back into it!

1479
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,210
Come on! Push!

1480
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,481
What is it, buddy?

1481
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,005
Hey, watch it.

1482
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,561
What's wrong with you?

1483
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,082
I don't understand you
when you talk like that.

1484
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,007
Stop it! Put me down!

1485
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,526
No, Sven!

1486
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,165
We're not going back.

1487
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,730
She's with her true love.

1488
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,721
What the...

1489
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,641
Anna!

1490
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,485
Come on! Come on, boy.

1491
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,681
Help.

1492
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,325
Anna!

1493
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,480
Oh, no.

1494
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:15,881
Olaf?

1495
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,282
Olaf. Get away from there.

1496
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,961
Wow!

1497
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,807
So, this is heat.

1498
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,251
I love it.

1499
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,010
Ooh! But don't touch it.

1500
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,244
So, where's Hans?
What happened to your kiss?

1501
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,606
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.

1502
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,525
But we ran all the way here.

1503
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,162
Please, Olaf, you can't stay here.
You'll melt.

1504
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,321
I am not leaving here until

1505
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,931
we find some other act
of true love to save you.

1506
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,169
Do you happen to have any ideas?

1507
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,210
I don't even know what love is.

1508
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,284
That's okay, I do.

1509
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,085
Love is

1510
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,447
putting someone else's
needs before yours.

1511
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,011
Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you
back here to Hans and left you forever.

1512
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,329
Kristoff loves me?

1513
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,407
Wow, you really
don't know anything about love, do you?

1514
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,724
Olaf, you're melting.

1515
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,202
Some people are worth melting for.

1516
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,442
Just maybe not right this second.

1517
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,086
Don't worry, I've got it.

1518
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,723
We're gonna get through... Oh, wait.

1519
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,490
Hang on, I'm getting something.

1520
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,001
It's Kristoff and Sven!

1521
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,366
They're coming back this way.

1522
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,161
They... They are?

1523
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,960
Wow! He's really moving fast.

1524
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,566
I guess I was wrong.

1525
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,040
I guess Kristoff doesn't
love you enough to leave you behind.

1526
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,763
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1527
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,923
No, no, no! You need to
stay by the fire and keep warm.

1528
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,684
I need to get to Kristoff.

1529
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:01,841
Why?

1530
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,766
Oh, I know why!

1531
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,088
There's your act of true love right there!

1532
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,085
Riding across the fjords
like a valiant, pungent reindeer king!

1533
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,446
Come on!

1534
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,445
Look out!

1535
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,720
Oh!

1536
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,170
Uh... Back this way.

1537
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,050
We're trapped.

1538
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,680
Oh...

1539
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,210
Whoa!

1540
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,930
Slide, Anna!

1541
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,371
We made it!

1542
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,130
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1543
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,370
Come on, buddy, faster.

1544
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,211
Kristoff!

1545
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,445
Keep going!

1546
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,285
Kristoff!

1547
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:47,967
Come on!

1548
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,367
No.

1549
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,641
Whoa!

1550
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,850
Whoa!

1551
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:31,810
Sven... Sven!

1552
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,765
Good boy.

1553
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,571
Kristoff.

1554
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,409
- Kristoff...
- Anna...

1555
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,401
Anna!

1556
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,169
Elsa! You can't run from this!

1557
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,489
Just take care of my sister.

1558
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,085
Your sister?

1559
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,726
She returned from the mountain
weak and cold.

1560
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,168
She said that you froze her heart.

1561
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,241
No.

1562
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,448
I tried to save her, but it was too late.

1563
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,241
Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white.

1564
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,370
Your sister is dead.

1565
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,804
Because of you.

1566
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,047
No.

1567
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,321
Kristoff.

1568
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,250
Anna!

1569
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,205
Elsa?

1570
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,607
No!

1571
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,201
Anna!

1572
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,650
Oh. Anna!

1573
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,602
No, no!

1574
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,245
Please, no.

1575
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,001
Anna?

1576
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,010
Anna?

1577
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,680
Oh, Elsa.

1578
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,207
You sacrificed yourself for me?

1579
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,371
I love you.

1580
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:50,242
"An act of true love
will thaw a frozen heart."

1581
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,490
"Love will thaw."

1582
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,360
Love. Of course.

1583
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,521
Elsa?

1584
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,241
Love!

1585
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,491
I knew you could do it.

1586
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:52,242
Hands down,
this is the best day of my life.

1587
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,689
And, quite possibly, the last.

1588
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,081
Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy.

1589
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,050
Oh, oh, oh!

1590
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:04,243
My own personal flurry!

1591
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,570
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1592
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,641
Anna?

1593
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,644
But she froze your heart.

1594
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,571
The only frozen heart
around here is yours.

1595
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,524
Wonderful!

1596
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,005
Setting course, sir.

1597
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,647
I will return this scoundrel to his country.

1598
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,561
We shall see what his 12 big
brothers think of his behavior.

1599
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,405
Arendelle thanks you, milord.

1600
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,130
This is unacceptable.

1601
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,324
I am a victim of fear.
I've been traumatized.

1602
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,164
Ah! My neck hurts.

1603
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,928
Is there a doctor that I could see?

1604
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,361
And I demand to see the queen!

1605
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,442
Oh. I have a message from the queen.

1606
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,844
"Arendelle will henceforth and forever"

1607
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,845
"no longer do business
of any sort with Weaseltown."

1608
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,161
"Weselton."

1609
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,730
- It's Weselton!
- Let's go.

1610
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,840
Come on, come on, come on!

1611
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,331
Okay, okay, here I come.

1612
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,289
Pole!
Whoops! Sorry.

1613
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,011
Okay, okay.

1614
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,844
Here we are. Oh!

1615
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,163
I owe you a sled.

1616
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,004
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

1617
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,930
And it's the latest model.

1618
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,525
No, I can't accept this.

1619
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,365
You have to. No returns.
No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1620
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,321
She's named you the Official
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

1621
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,449
- What? That's not a thing.
- Oh, sure it is.

1622
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,967
And it even has a cup holder.
Do you like it?

1623
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,281
Like it? I love it!

1624
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,361
Whoa.

1625
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,090
I could kiss you!

1626
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,729
I could. I mean, I'd like to. I'd...

1627
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,928
May I? We me.
I mean, may we?

1628
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,127
Wait, what?

1629
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,366
We may.

1630
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,689
Mmm.

1631
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,726
Summer!

1632
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,727
Ooh...

1633
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,802
Hello.

1634
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,161
Are you ready?

1635
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,082
Ice!

1636
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,404
Ooh! Whoo-hoo...

1637
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:54,925
Swing me.

1638
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,604
Ooh...

1639
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,684
I like the open gates.

1640
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,922
We are never closing them again.

1641
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:06,927
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
but you know I don't skate.

1642
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,531
Come on! You can do it!

1643
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,281
Look out.
Reindeer coming through.

1644
