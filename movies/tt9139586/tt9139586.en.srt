1
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,046
<i>Palmer, Alaska
has luxury homes</i>

2
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,096
<i>with million-dollar views.</i>

3
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,784
<i>Cole and Amanda have saved up</i>

4
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,264
<i>and are ready to spend
the big bucks.</i>

5
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:07,064
<i>This log house has surprises
around every turn.</i>

6
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,600
<i>Now, that's nice.</i>

7
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,881
<i>- Wow!
- I've always suspected</i>

8
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,693
<i>that I didn't want the desirable things
in life as much as I should.</i>

9
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:20,073
<i>Women, cars, houses, movies, bands.</i>

10
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,701
<i>These things were how people chiseled out
a tidy philosophy of life.</i>

11
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,187
<i>- This can't be for real.
- It's really serene.</i>

12
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,293
<i>I never needed a philosophy of life.</i>

13
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,649
<i>And one more thing.
This is awesome.</i>

14
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,317
<i>It's only people who wanted things,</i>

15
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,548
<i>felt guilty about getting
things and frustrated</i>

16
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,172
<i>about not getting things
that needed a philosophy.</i>

17
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,615
<i>It might be my favorite
part of the house.</i>

18
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,470
The garage of Cole's dreams,

19
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:44,143
<i>a party shower and a sunroom.
What will it all cost?</i>

20
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,957
<i>I was just as pleased to get drunk</i>

21
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,723
<i>or drink a bunch and not get drunk.</i>

22
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,169
<i>The main thing is the grass for me.</i>

23
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,233
- THERE'S JUST SO MUCH OF IT.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

24
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,402
Hmm?

25
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,234
Give me your weapon.

26
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,609
I don't got one.

27
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,031
Someone that fights like you
should have a weapon.

28
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,660
Trespassin' is a lot different
than armed robbery, smart guy.

29
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,783
Mm-hmm.

30
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,866
You talk too much.

31
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,502
<i>Kyle, you here?
It's Colin.</i>

32
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,090
Tell me you still got it, man.

33
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,839
Yes!

34
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:05,091
Ooh! That's what I'm talking about.
Hey, that's what I'm talking about.

35
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,011
You may wanna step out for a while.

36
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,853
Why's that?

37
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,815
Well, there's a gentleman may stop by.

38
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,735
If so,
I got to shoot him.

39
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,568
Colin, you one crazy son of a bitch.

40
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,124
I got a guy in my closet.

41
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,128
I don't know if it's the same
one you're thinking of.

42
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,581
- Curly headed?
- Yeah, that's the one.

43
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,250
And he's alive?

44
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,044
So far.

45
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,592
Pack your shit.

46
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,554
- Did I just get promoted?
- Yep.

47
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,057
You goin' to Arkansas.

48
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,179
<i>I'm a drug dealer.</i>

49
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,365
<i>I'm near the bottom rung of an outfit
run by a man named frog.</i>

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,036
<i>A man I've never met before.</i>

51
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,876
<i>To be honest,
I'm not sure he even exists.</i>

52
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,419
<i>What a lot of people don't know
about organized crime in the south</i>

53
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,421
<i>is that it's not that organized.</i>

54
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,133
<i>The term Dixie mafia
has always been too generous,</i>

55
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,839
<i>implied too grand a scale.</i>

56
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,930
<i>There's a handful of big-time operators
that run everything regionally, but...</i>

57
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:38,067
<i>It's nothing like the Italians
or the Mexicans, no families.</i>

58
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,820
<i>Just a loose affiliation
of deadbeats and scumbags.</i>

59
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,568
<i>No code of honor.</i>

60
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,859
<i>No philosophy of life.</i>

61
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,743
<i>It's mostly boring solitary work,
but that suits me just fine.</i>

62
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,839
<i>Relying on other people
is the fastest way</i>

63
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,667
<i>fo end up dead in this business.</i>

64
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,594
You Kyle?
You swin?

65
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,225
Welcome aboard.
I'll be your co-pilot this evening.

66
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,350
Colin didn't mention I'd be
captaining a highway barge.

67
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,147
Yeah, well, you're moving wholesale now,
the big leagues.

68
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,777
What's with the cones?

69
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,692
I thought the randomness
of it might throw off a cop.

70
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,654
Well, I guess that's smart.

71
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,952
- I'm somethin' of a criminal mastermind.
- Oh, you're one of those witty people?

72
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,457
I've been called worse.

73
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,203
You kinda remind me of a game show host.

74
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,341
You know what, Kyle?

75
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,338
It strikes me that if you wanna be
the strong silent type,

76
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,171
you really gotta keep yourself
from commenting on every little thing.

77
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,426
It won't be right away,

78
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,678
but at some point soon
I'm gonna knock you on your ass.

79
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,932
I suggest you keep
the bullshit to a minimum.

80
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,138
Look at you.

81
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,857
No, you act tough now,
but we'll be friends.

82
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,589
Everybody who meets me
wants to be my friend.

83
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,649
Yeah, I find that hard to believe.

84
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,071
I mean, what's not to like?

85
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,823
What kinda name is swin anyway?

86
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,485
Your mother's.
Get in.

87
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,164
If we go 83 the rest of the way
we won't be late.

88
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,002
Getting pulled over with drugs
makes you really late.

89
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,971
There I go learnin' again.

90
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,972
You don't get this smart on accident.

91
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,021
That's nice to see.

92
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,568
- You're sad.
- No.

93
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,138
It's just most women
don't breastfeed anymore,

94
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,777
which is a shame, you know?

95
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,033
'Cause breastfed babies
get fewer syndromes.

96
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,580
I was a formula baby.

97
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,831
"Your big ass I'm guessin" had
a mouthful of the real deal.

98
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,122
- No idea.
- Oh, I bet ya did.

99
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,673
Bet you had a titty
in your mouth from day one.

100
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,546
Let's call your mother and ask.

101
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,090
She's dead.

102
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,353
I wouldn't care if all my sisters died.

103
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,016
You're fuckin' stupid.

104
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,978
Ah, shit.

105
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,437
God damn it.

106
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,025
Really?
Duct tape, MacGyver?

107
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,405
You see any rope in there?

108
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,950
I'm improvising 'cause your
damn cover job was so shoddy.

109
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,749
- Shit.
- Fuck.

110
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,544
Uh, let me do the talkin'.

111
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,922
Hey, now.
I'm Mike, how's your day going?

112
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,671
Uh, first aid kit's in the console.

113
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,633
Pat bright, park ranger.
You boys heading far?

114
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,724
Corpus christi.

115
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,142
I noticed your rig needs some help.

116
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,437
Well, not sure
I agree with that 100 percent,

117
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,106
but I guess everything
gives out in time, doesn't it?

118
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,193
If you're patient.

119
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,816
You gotta get more rope,
go corner to corner.

120
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,569
Yeah, I know it.
Uh, we were just in a rush this morning.

121
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,284
Still are. "What's the haul?"

122
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:00,998
Faucets.

123
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,415
Yep, some,
uh, computer tycoon, you know?

124
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,242
Used to be oil,
now it's computers.

125
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,331
There are no faucets in corpus?

126
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,127
That's what I said,

127
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,804
but he said he's gotta have that
adobe-marble core.

128
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,975
Mm-hmm, well let me take
a look how you got this stacked.

129
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,769
I'm a safety expert in this state.

130
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,687
I appreciate...
I appreciate it, sir,

131
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,294
but the thing is,
we really gotta haul ass.

132
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,296
- We're already pretty far.
- Hey, enough questions.

133
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,400
Fuck.

134
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,024
What's the cones for?

135
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:49,665
You boys are carrying a load of faucets,
stuffed with bags of powder and plug.

136
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,916
You left from little rock,

137
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,874
and you got a map of each state
in your glove box.

138
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,423
I'm with frog.
I've been ordered to intervene.

139
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,340
So, you boys not gonna have
a lot of choice

140
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,049
about your immediate futures.

141
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,637
You gonna work under me
at the state park.

142
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,849
Frog's got a whole new loop of clients
and I'm running those deals,

143
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,484
so try not to look like deer
in the headlights.

144
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,363
Try to look angry or bored or something.

145
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:22,486
- So you know frog, personally?
- I've known frogman for years.

146
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,492
Ever since a truck of his
got lost in my park.

147
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,417
You boys gonna ride with me.

148
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,459
What about the flatbed?

149
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,128
Uh, Colin here will take it the rest away.

150
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,051
What's up, Kyle?

151
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,972
I don't think you gonna need that.

152
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,686
I about blew you away.

153
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:54,142
- You trying to convince someone?
- No.

154
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,352
No, I hate guns.

155
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,213
They say it ain't smart to fuck around
with someone you don't know.

156
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,275
Your name is Kyle ribb.

157
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,112
You never killed a man,
and your name is swin horn.

158
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,491
You never killed a man.

159
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,741
You're dependable.

160
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,411
You're a project.

161
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,098
<i>So, here's how this
is all gonna shake out.</i>

162
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,643
<i>You two boys get to live
in trailers on the park grounds.</i>

163
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,059
<i>Don't worry, I'm not playing favorites.</i>

164
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,898
<i>They're identical.</i>

165
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,316
<i>You'll have nine to five covers
as park peons.</i>

166
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:42,399
<i>Maintainin' the grounds,
directin' lost suvs.</i>

167
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,680
You are here, you're gonna make a right
and a left all the way to the end.

168
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,196
<i>Your cover names are
Robert Suarez and ed mollar.</i>

169
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,331
<i>These are my rules.</i>

170
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,626
<i>I'm only gonna say 'em once,
so listen the fuck up.</i>

171
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,045
<i>I am the boss.</i>

172
00:11:56,174 --> 00:12:00,463
<i>You may never refuse an order
and you may never quit.</i>

173
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,043
<i>If you decide to run off,</i>

174
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,720
<i>I will hunt you down
and I will kill you,</i>

175
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,469
<i>no matter how much
I've grown to like you.</i>

176
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,801
<i>Do not socialize with the locals.</i>

177
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,015
<i>Do not bring girls around.</i>

178
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,438
<i>Do not draw attention to yourself.</i>

179
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,902
<i>In time you two might take over
the operation,</i>

180
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,321
<i>cutting me in for a humble percentage.</i>

181
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:27,653
<i>Why, just think.
One day this could all be yours.</i>

182
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,174
Where's the boss?

183
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,882
Vacuumin' his corvette.

184
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,378
Goin' on two hours.
He's obsessed with it.

185
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,338
More of a German car guy myself.

186
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,300
You think there's any chance
bright is frog?

187
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,395
Ero.

188
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,311
It's fresh thinkin' though.

189
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,226
Where do you think frog lives,
on a ranch somewhere?

190
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,271
I think that we will have
to work at this company

191
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,923
for a long time
before we ever found out

192
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,357
anything true about the frogman.

193
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,739
I heard he has a pool
shaped like a Lily pad.

194
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,236
Yep, there you go.

195
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,909
For a long time it's just
gonna be shit like that.

196
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,578
Inconsequential falsehoods.

197
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,787
Sleep well?
All nested in?

198
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,920
Would either of you boys
like to call me sir?

199
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,417
You can if you want.

200
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,415
I won't think it's corny.

201
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,926
We're gonna go traffic drugs
across state lines, sir!

202
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,483
You see that?

203
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,608
Place like that's where
my sisters are gonna end up.

204
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,111
How many of those
you got anyway, like, ten?

205
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,820
They don't have their real father.

206
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,621
Their stepdad is overly strict.

207
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,121
He ran me off,
so I'm not there to protect 'em.

208
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,410
Sounds like a stripper recipe to me.

209
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,587
Yeah.

210
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,748
Well, you never can tell.

211
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,588
One of 'em's already named cinnamon.

212
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,347
<i>I need a price check on register five.</i>

213
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,148
<i>Price check on register five.</i>

214
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,898
Excuse me, ma'am?

215
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,753
Do you happen to know
where the radishes are?

216
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,199
I don't know,
with the vegetables.

217
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,582
That's an educated guess.

218
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,750
New in town,
name's swin.

219
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,286
Oh, your name's about as dumb as mine.

220
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,461
- Johnna.
- Pleasure.

221
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,630
Really no tellin' how long
I'll be in the area.

222
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,303
Yeah, I'm a freelance government auditor.

223
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,516
Let's get this courtship underway.

224
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,141
- I'm on shift tonight.
- What about tomorrow night?

225
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,338
- Church.
- I'm actually working...

226
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,819
- Did you say church?
- Yeah, you should try it sometime.

227
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,147
I have.
We all have.

228
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,445
Well, try again.
Maybe it'll stick.

229
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,089
- Can I help you with something?
- What about Saturday?

230
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,796
This is creepy.

231
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,046
The radishes and then
the following me out to my car.

232
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,927
You're... you're just creepy.

233
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,809
Do you like creepy?

234
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,099
I'll tell you what.

235
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,232
You can't so much as kiss me
for five dates.

236
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,569
- And then what?
- Then you can.

237
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,305
What the fuck?
You can't date a local girl.

238
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,285
Bright told us to keep a low profile.

239
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:01,078
It's no big deal.
I'm not teachin' her our secret handshake.

240
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,604
- You tell bright?
- No, and I apparently

241
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,993
shouldn't have told you.

242
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,961
Yeah, you might be right.

243
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,135
Evening, ma'am.

244
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,680
Oh, those are the pitiful-est
things I've ever seen.

245
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,262
Can you carry that?

246
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,812
- I got it.
- Are you sure?

247
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,735
Yep.

248
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,153
I'm barbecuing some shrimp,
making dinner for breakfast.

249
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,203
- Y'all hungry?
- No, thanks.

250
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,617
<i>So far it's been a very tight game.</i>

251
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,413
A hundred.

252
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,879
Does it run?

253
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,331
Oh, no, you don't ride it.

254
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,213
- The thing's a curiosity.
- So it don't run?

255
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:57,468
So you turn a profit
just selling books and socks?

256
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,094
Oh, I don't have to turn a profit.

257
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,954
- It's a great business model.
- Mm-hmm.

258
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,470
Um, sir, this scooter
is a piece of America.

259
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,147
I don't see why
you wouldn't wanna buy it.

260
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,401
Oh, I don't care about America.

261
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,229
I care about listening to
the St. Louis cardinals on the radio.

262
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,315
<i>Calvin is now one, one with...</i>

263
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,694
There he goes.
Where is he...

264
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,139
<i>Pitcher throws a fastball.</i>

265
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,494
He's kind of a neat guy.

266
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,449
All he does is cook breakfast
and listen to the damn radio.

267
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,536
He's just mean.

268
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,213
He won't give you ten bucks for a rolex.

269
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,060
I wouldn't give you ten bucks
for this thing.

270
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,802
Well, this could go on all night.

271
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,339
Flood the trails,
a real gully washer.

272
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,227
You boys better start out now
if you wanna get back home.

273
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,349
Otherwise you'll be
stuck with me all night.

274
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,393
I'll wait it out.

275
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,694
Yeah, me too.

276
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,738
I'll fix it.

277
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,161
There, that's better.

278
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,544
Then as the english say, boys,

279
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,627
let us press on through till the dawn.

280
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,598
Dawn?

281
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,511
You can hit the sack if you like, Abigail.

282
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,308
You can sleep in my bed if you want.

283
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,895
I just don't really drink.
I'm not trying to be a dick.

284
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,849
I have a feeling that's your line.

285
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,060
My line is...

286
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,364
May you dream of offered tits.

287
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,366
I say that, ah,
once in a while.

288
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,210
Splash, splash,
down the hatch.

289
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,186
They say I have the feet of Christ.

290
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:15,272
Gentlemen, I would now like
to say a few words about boredom.

291
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,910
No, because a bored criminal
is a good criminal.

292
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,242
So if you boys ever
catch yourselves startin'

293
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,750
to complain about boredom,
just remember it's better

294
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,626
to have to look for something to do

295
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:41,461
than have something to do look for you.

296
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:45,798
Mm-hmm.

297
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,559
Hmm.

298
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,987
Hello.

299
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,195
- <i>The bake sale is a go.</i>
- Got it.

300
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,825
That was our new orders.

301
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,454
- That was frog?
- That was her.

302
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,079
She calls herself her.

303
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,122
<i>She is a black lady.</i>

304
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,758
<i>Lives on a houseboat
other side of the lake.</i>

305
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,962
<i>She always calls with orders.</i>

306
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,472
Why does she call herself her?

307
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,266
Well, this is pure conjecture,

308
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:34,723
but I imagine that if our
organization was infiltrated

309
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,524
<i>or somebody wearing a wire
or tappin' phones,</i>

310
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:43,322
<i>what have you, then all they'd hear
is "her this" and "her that" and..</i>

311
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,572
Her?

312
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,742
Her could be any woman at all.

313
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,247
So we're gonna hand deliver
the drugs and receive cash.

314
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,958
- That's new.
- It means frog trusts us.

315
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,170
- Yeah, like a promotion really.
- Where we going?

316
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,137
Castor, Louisiana.

317
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,622
Uh, here is good.

318
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,004
You see,
in my country it's rude not to...

319
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,384
Study something you buy.

320
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,973
You like, um, sunny d?

321
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,557
Sure.

322
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,308
We buy bulk.
We're sick of it.

323
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,310
- Who's we?
- My... my grandson.

324
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:03,436
Nick, bring, uh,
juice pouch this minute.

325
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,415
Hey, easy!

326
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,627
Oh, gosh how...
Look how rude, I... I...

327
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,088
I wave this thing.

328
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,254
Nick, show manners.

329
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,302
Friends.

330
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,097
And let them see you or they get nervous.

331
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,266
They don't know how weak you are.

332
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,389
Don't worry so much about being rude.

333
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,436
Check the balls and bring out the money.

334
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,729
His, um, poor father...

335
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:48,147
Very strange egg as you American's say.

336
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:51,154
As a child he paid another boy

337
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:56,285
to partake of the sex act with a dog.

338
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,202
A small dog.

339
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,464
Dogs actually enjoy sex with humans,
you know?

340
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,713
It'd be like you having sex
with a super-hot alien.

341
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:21,518
Uh, what, uh, county
of Arkansas are you from?

342
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,270
- Huh?
- Tell him to bring in the money.

343
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,194
Very sorry, it's,
uh, a rude question.

344
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,488
Don't say the word rude again.

345
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,361
It's in my power to pull this deal.

346
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,443
Nick! Bring the bag.

347
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:40,917
My plight is, um, horrible one.
I'm no longer noble.

348
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,918
Now I'm threatened by men in my own home.

349
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,083
I had a life,
now I have shit.

350
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,510
Hey, could be worse.

351
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,605
If you don't bring that bag
out here in a hurry

352
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,475
- it could be worse.
- Nick, come! Bring the bag!

353
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:14,779
We're good.

354
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:16,823
No hard feelings.

355
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,163
No feelings at all.

356
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,533
Put your fucking hands up.

357
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,674
I don't mean to die before I get
those water spots off the vette.

358
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,691
My god, where are you from, son?

359
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,033
At least tell me that.

360
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,490
Uh...

361
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,705
- Castor.
- Of course.

362
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,502
Fuckin' castor, Louisiana?

363
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,962
Mm-hmm.
I followed them boys in the Van.

364
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,883
- You followed them?
- Uh-huh.

365
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,336
Uh-huh,
who was driving?

366
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,425
That short little piece of shit
in the glasses.

367
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,306
And you and him worked something out.

368
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,558
No, they ain't know nothing about this.

369
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,348
Don't bullshit me.

370
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,735
Swin could never face me
for the dirty work.

371
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,570
Mm, no, no, no, no.

372
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,533
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no. You're wrong.

373
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,905
This is my doin's.
All mine.

374
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:52,168
Where's the money?

375
00:27:55,591 --> 00:28:00,255
What is the state of things...

376
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,712
When a person like me can be disgusted?

377
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,014
God damn it! Where's the money?

378
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,108
Do you wanna come inside?

379
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,232
Right now?

380
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,740
Tonight was our fifth date.

381
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,992
I know you got
a fucking stash in this place

382
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,077
- and you're gonna give it to me!
- Why?

383
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,206
So you can waste it on community college?

384
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,042
You wouldn't know what
to do with my stash.

385
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,386
You fuck! You see this?

386
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:50,142
You're not bluffing!

387
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,398
You figure that out?

388
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,688
I've never been tortured before, please!

389
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,315
It's in the attic.

390
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,999
Uh...

391
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:18,332
Just need my one hand for it.

392
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,582
- What for?
- So I can fish it outta there.

393
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,049
Don't worry, I'm in no condition
to cause anybody harm.

394
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,724
So, that's the duct.

395
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:39,229
Just move those boxes
and that pot outta the way.

396
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,865
What's this thing?

397
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,032
It's an eight track player.

398
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,373
Who raised you, son?
Critters and things?

399
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,464
Shut the fuck up.

400
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,006
How's it work?

401
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,584
You press the tape all the way in,

402
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,762
push down on the plunger
and you got music.

403
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,853
- Oh, shit.
- Son?

404
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,394
It's not gonna end well for you.

405
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,607
It's your last chance
to do the smart thing.

406
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,490
Yeah.

407
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,901
Well, it's your last chance
to do anything.

408
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,823
Go on, get it.

409
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,750
All right.

410
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,125
You're just gonna have to help me up.
I can't get up on my own.

411
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,837
Tell me somethin' about yourself...

412
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,089
That nobody else knows.

413
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,424
I can't see my sisters.

414
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,430
My stepfather's brainwashed them.

415
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,678
Where are they?

416
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,147
Doesn't matter.
Might as well be the moon.

417
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,525
Do you have pictures?

418
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,441
No, I didn't want pictures.

419
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,738
Pictures are pretty good.

420
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,942
Especially with writing on the back.

421
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:09,000
I always thought
I would die outside.

422
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,006
I don't why.

423
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,212
It's just a feelin'.

424
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,597
No, we... we ain't dead yet.

425
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,431
- I know.
- No, we're fine.

426
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,490
That was just
the rest of your life talking.

427
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:34,783
It's fine.

428
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,702
May... maybe...

429
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,419
- May...
- What... what?

430
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:54,629
May you dream of offered tits.

431
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,020
Bright, you home?

432
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,650
Must have got in the ol' whisky cabinet.

433
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,438
Nothin' in the sink but a coffee cup.

434
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:21,989
Is that blood?

435
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,377
He followed us?

436
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,257
It's not as bad as it looks.
It's just a busy day.

437
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:42,013
You're gonna go to the hardware store,
buy some new insulations, plastic sheets,

438
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,435
clean up the blood,
wipe down all the door handles.

439
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,896
- All right?
- What?

440
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,564
What are you...
What are you doing?

441
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,319
What are you doing?

442
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,135
Don't let anyone near the house.

443
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,108
Where you going?
Where you going? Fucking...

444
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,007
<i>Hey.
I didn't wanna be rude,</i>

445
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,838
<i>so I brought your grandson's gun back.</i>

446
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,798
<i>Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.</i>

447
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,608
<i>I'll bury the Greek kid somewhere else.</i>

448
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,274
<i>Distance ourselves from him
and the grandfather.</i>

449
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,089
<i>Why don't we just bury 'em both here?</i>

450
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,743
<i>We're not buryin'
bright's killer in his park.</i>

451
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,951
Why are we covering this up?

452
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,455
- We didn't kill 'em.
- It buys us some time.

453
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,920
You know six feet's only a custom, right?

454
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,582
Custom we're gonna follow.

455
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,203
I should've checked to see
if anybody was following us.

456
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,684
I know that and I...
I accept responsibility for that.

457
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,002
I already know it was your fault.
You don't have to tell me that.

458
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:56,018
You don't have to be a dick.
I'm apologizing, okay?

459
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,912
- That's what people do.
- It's not what I do.

460
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,009
It's got nothin' to do
with payin' attention.

461
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,552
You should've felt
someone following you.

462
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,658
Yeah, so called gut feelings
come from your brain,

463
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,264
and I was thinkin'
about somethin' else.

464
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,324
- I got distracted.
- Thinkin' about what?

465
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,157
I don't know now.
I think about shit all the time.

466
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,082
I spent years training my brain to race.

467
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,786
I can't just fuckin' turn
it off like a switch.

468
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,543
That's why you're so good at this shit.
Your brain's managing.

469
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,256
You were thinkin' about that fuckin' girl.

470
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,653
Why didn't we run as soon
as we found him dead?

471
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,038
In whose car?

472
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,325
Bright's?
With frog's money?

473
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,160
Headed where?
Back to Athens and Vanderbilt?

474
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:58,213
- I don't know, we didn't even consider it.
- I did.

475
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,583
You ever consider that if we run off
it looks like we planned this?

476
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,006
It looks like we have a reason to run.

477
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,971
Frog will hunt us down
and kill us if we run.

478
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,639
Running's a death sentence.

479
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,514
I'll try to get in touch with Colin.

480
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,209
We better tell the story ourselves

481
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,519
than have it tricklin' up
that chain of command.

482
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,271
Things trickle down, not up.

483
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,441
Sorry. I'm sorry.

484
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,986
It's not me, it's my brain.
My brain's a real asshole.

485
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,700
It'll work out.

486
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,866
We just gotta get a hold of Colin.
That's how we stay alive.

487
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,036
Even so, don't you think
maybe it's time to get a gun?

488
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,036
Bringin' in guns doesn't settle
the situation down.

489
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,372
What if just you had one?
You trust yourself, right?

490
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,278
- The answer is no.
- Do you think it makes you

491
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,293
a fuckin' tough guy to be unarmed?

492
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:48,005
Which one of us recently shot someone?
Hmm?

493
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,016
If frog wanted us to have guns
we'd have guns.

494
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,333
Listen, testament.

495
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,218
I got a couple boxes in the back.

496
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,465
I'll go fetch one.

497
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,802
That way you can bring
all your crap in here at once,

498
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:36,185
instead of comin' in here every day
and depositing it piece by piece.

499
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,024
I got somethin' you can move.

500
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,280
Bootlegged cassette tapes.

501
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,658
I can handle that.

502
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,017
The tapes are over.

503
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,097
Well, it lasted longer than I expected.

504
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,686
You headed somewhere?

505
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:21,978
I'm goin' to Illinois,
but the bag's not.

506
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,528
Peter Pan, pcp.

507
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,239
Do I look like a drug dealer to ya?

508
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,077
He'll pay shit,
but he won't kill you.

509
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,214
<i>Testament gave me a suit.</i>

510
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,092
But it turns out it doesn't fit.

511
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,671
<i>Meet me a block north
of frayser high in three hours.</i>

512
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,886
Get in.

513
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,141
Give me your gun.

514
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:29,935
Ain't got one.

515
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,103
Don't fuck with me.

516
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,898
Take it out slow,
put it on the floorboard.

517
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,656
<i>A couple months ago.</i>

518
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,702
<i>I miss him so much.</i>

519
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,267
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

520
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,748
<i>I am so sorry to hear that,
but you know what?</i>

521
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,622
Bright needs the money back.

522
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,078
That shit you sold him was bunk.

523
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,708
How do I know he ain't lying?

524
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:52,541
Probably is.
That's between the two of y'all.

525
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,136
You want some?

526
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,848
I'm on a strict diet.
Hennessy and ass.

527
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,301
How'd you find me?

528
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,058
I followed you since you left the shop,
you dumb shit.

529
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,350
<i>JJ.</i>

530
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,086
<i>All right. JJ,
you heard that.</i>

531
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,771
I'll give you 5,000 to let me go.

532
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,853
<i>Want you back.
Come on, now.</i>

533
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,820
<i>- Get your mind right.</i>
- Shh.

534
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,884
I wasn't gonna kill you.
I'll let you go.

535
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:46,438
I swear, man.

536
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,607
Come on, man.

537
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,427
I gotta get the fuck outta Memphis.

538
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,930
<i>I got a friend
in pine bluff named almond.</i>

539
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,101
What's his name?

540
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,643
<i>Almond, motherfucker.
Like the nut.</i>

541
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:32,523
- All right.
<i>- I'm settin' you up.</i>

542
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,645
Appreciate you.

543
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:02,716
Hey.

544
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,714
What can I do for ya?

545
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,287
Well, I think the question is
what can I do for you?

546
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,847
My name's frog.

547
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,729
I got a friend from Memphis
who said you are, uh,

548
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,352
looking for new employees.

549
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,478
- Did he, now?
- Mm.

550
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,363
Mm.

551
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,483
You know this world we livin' in?

552
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,282
It's becomin' morally atrocious.

553
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:34,002
Individuals with low,
low quality

554
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,629
just over runnin'
the whole goddamn planet.

555
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:43,636
What kinda individual are you,
Mr... Frog?

556
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,641
I'm an individual who's had to talk
his way out of a lot of hardships.

557
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,936
- Hmm.
- Made me quite the salesman.

558
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,356
- Salesman, huh?
- Yep.

559
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,838
All right,
you give me just one minute.

560
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,656
Nice car.

561
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,122
Oh, man.

562
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,971
<i>Hello.</i>
You still alive?

563
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,977
<i>Fat like Thanksgiving.
My boy there?</i>

564
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,103
Yeah, he here.

565
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,504
<i>You set him up
with your sister yet?</i>

566
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,189
Fat chance.

567
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,028
I only got one friend in Memphis.

568
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,911
Lucky for me he's mutual.

569
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,373
You got one week
to turn that into a franchise.

570
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,971
Oh, and if anybody raises
or as much as furrows a brow...

571
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,723
You tell 'em you with almond.

572
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,209
Wasn't expecting you back so soon.

573
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,130
Well, I guess I was better
than you expected.

574
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,261
Or dumber.

575
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,140
Oh. And about gettin' more inventory,

576
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,438
- the answer's gonna be no.
- No?

577
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:00,940
It's Friday night.

578
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,434
I could sell two,
three times that this weekend.

579
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:07,905
You sell to those assholes at that rate,
what's gonna happen?

580
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,408
They gonna end up either broke or dead
in a couple of months and then what?

581
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,070
Now, look, when I give you
a week's supply,

582
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,121
you make it last.
That's the rule.

583
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,787
Are there anymore rules I should know?

584
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:22,621
Yeah, a shit load,
and you stretch one the rest are useless.

585
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,467
That's him, Shelton.

586
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:30,799
Hey?

587
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,801
Sorry, fellas,
I'm dry.

588
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,812
- I'm with almond.
- I know.

589
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,154
Look like you had a rough weekend.

590
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,907
That caveman, Shelton,
put it on me pretty good.

591
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:59,749
- Was that on your call?
- That fuckin' Shelton.

592
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,622
Get that thing outta my face and come on.

593
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:07,878
- So Shelton's not with you?
- He used to be.

594
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,635
He used to be my brother-in-law.

595
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,213
There any other relatives
I need to worry about?

596
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,673
Yeah, my sister.

597
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:18,726
<i>You and I will march
straight to the cops.</i>

598
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:22,230
So what?
He's in business on his own how?

599
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,523
As much as he's capable of.

600
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,602
That motherfucker's so dumb,
couldn't even think of a different front.

601
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,525
- Why don't you just kill him?
- And then what?

602
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,359
Go to jail for killing that fool?

603
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,742
Mm-mm. Who gonna take care
of my sister, you?

604
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,331
I'll deal with Shelton
when the time is right.

605
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:45,628
When the rewards
outweigh the repercussion. You dig?

606
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,626
What, you ain't never hear
cost benefit analysis?

607
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,959
Come on.

608
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,559
Come on.

609
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,599
<i>Now, remember,
you keep your mouth shut</i>

610
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,348
unless he asks you a question,
got it?

611
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,018
Does meeting your middleman
make me your number two already?

612
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,605
If numbers make you feel better.

613
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,770
I guess it ain't everyday you meet

614
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,356
a nice white man you can groom
into something.

615
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,733
Hey.

616
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,163
Who's this honky?

617
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,326
Oh, that's my driver.

618
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,706
I'd have left him in the car,

619
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,250
but I figured a dude sittin' in
the driveway for two hours

620
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:28,170
is a little suspicious,
so I brought him on in.

621
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,874
Wait here.

622
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,595
Who's the gringo?

623
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:39,924
Be right back.

624
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:47,644
Sit down.

625
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,830
Move and I'll cut your damn head off.

626
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,615
Got it.

627
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,667
That was fast.

628
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,833
Thank you for your hospitality, <i>senorita.</i>

629
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:16,673
Sit down.

630
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,803
We ain't goin' nowhere.

631
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:23,517
- We're about to watch a movie.
<i>- The toxic avenger.</i>

632
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,101
Socializing part of the deal?

633
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,235
Well, he don't like people pullin'
into his driveway

634
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:37,235
and pullin' right back out,
so no ticky, no washy.

635
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,711
His ass.
His ass.

636
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,769
Might as well be selling ice cream.

637
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:33,788
Can't be helped.

638
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,085
Fuck it.

639
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,418
Between 9:30 and 10:30,

640
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,846
a red Cadillac with several bricks
of cocaine in its trunk

641
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,470
is gonna come cruisin' down
stringer Avenue

642
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,302
and turn left on bethel road.

643
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,483
I got nothin' to say to you.

644
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,952
Well, it was gonna be somebody.

645
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,950
Isn't part of you glad it was me?

646
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,579
Why couldn't you just kill me?

647
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:16,335
Because I respect you, almond.
I learned a lot from you.

648
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,758
You respect me, huh?

649
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:26,387
Well, you're gonna take care
of all my responsibilities... as a man.

650
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,471
- Let's hear it.
- First thing...

651
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,189
You take care of my sister.
Put her in the rissler house.

652
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,986
Best fuckin' suite they got.

653
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:41,856
All right.

654
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,237
And if you haven't already...

655
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:47,862
You kill Shelton.

656
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,539
One condition.

657
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,209
I want the middleman.

658
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:58,039
I want him in good fuckin' standing.

659
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,458
You thought of everything, didn't ya?

660
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,763
You can have him.

661
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,475
You have him...

662
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,270
And be cursed.

663
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,170
This fucking idiot.

664
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:39,401
Every time, man,
look at him.

665
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:41,465
He come up, he don't know
what he gonna end up with.

666
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,271
I ain't seen this one yet.

667
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,690
So, I'm going through
some lifestyle changes.

668
00:53:58,777 --> 00:53:59,983
I need to cash out.

669
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,692
I wanna sell you my wholesaler.

670
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,200
- How much?
- Hundred thousand.

671
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,701
I'll give ya 60.

672
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,533
It was my fault this shit happened,

673
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,764
but that doesn't mean
I'm taking a demotion.

674
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:16,264
I'll let you be leader,
but I wanna be consulted on everything.

675
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,771
Ah, don't worry.
I don't wanna be anyone's boss.

676
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:41,585
Kyle!

677
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,056
Ah, shit.

678
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:06,310
Look what I found.

679
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,151
- Are those bones?
- Mm-hmm.

680
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:12,449
Human bones?
Who the hell's this?

681
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,577
It was a fluke bright died.

682
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,405
He was a bad ass.

683
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,242
You might be one of those.
Little old you.

684
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:23,588
What you got?

685
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,084
Forty-four thousand dollars.

686
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,835
- That was here in the house?
- In the drier.

687
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,294
Set to permanent press.

688
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,760
Well, what do we do with it?

689
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,998
Nothin'. Put it back in the dryer.
Someone will come for it.

690
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,142
Forty-four grand doesn't just
get lost in the shuffle.

691
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,765
Tomorrow we'll reopen the park,

692
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,021
make sure everything's spotless
and then wait.

693
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,727
Okay, what are we gonna tell her?

694
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:49,857
Ah, fuck.

695
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,606
I forgot about her.

696
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,781
She sent us to castor.
For all we know she set us up.

697
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,697
Okay, we'll tell her
bright's on a trip.

698
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,291
That lie has a pretty short shelf life.

699
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,064
Well, I'm sorry I don't have
a ten-year fucking plan

700
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,295
- mapped out for us.
- All right, all right.

701
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,502
Let's just get the lie straight, okay?

702
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:15,045
We're gonna say that bright
went to Oklahoma...

703
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,381
With an Indian.

704
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,509
- That's it?
- That's it.

705
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,595
You throw in a couple details,
but you don't worry

706
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,292
about if the listener
believes the story or not.

707
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:26,602
It's the apathy of authority.

708
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:31,524
- Okay. Oklahoma with an Indian.
- Oklahoma with an Indian.

709
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,983
And don't name the Indian.
Like shits where he eats.

710
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,286
You're a fuckin' idiot.

711
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
A live idiot.

712
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,792
This fella here is a dead wise man.

713
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:50,794
<i>In today's top story,
a man from castor, Louisiana,</i>

714
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:54,092
<i>was found dead in a suspected
gang style execution.</i>

715
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,294
<i>There are no suspects...</i>

716
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,504
- What?
<i>- But castor police</i>

717
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:57,838
<i>- are asking the public...</i>
- No.

718
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,133
<i>For any information that
could help their investigation.</i>

719
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,581
Did you ever get a hold
of anybody in the company?

720
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,062
No, I tried Colin,
but he didn't pick up.

721
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:09,357
Fuckin' try him again.
He never leaves his shop.

722
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,060
- <i>We're sorry.</i>
- Ah, shit!

723
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:25,311
<i>You have reached a number...</i>
What?

724
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,935
<i>That has been
disconnected or is no...</i>

725
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,622
It's disconnected.

726
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,712
- Fuck!
- Do you have

727
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,628
another number for Colin or, um,

728
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:36,589
maybe we could try that guy,
the guy with the ear thing.

729
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,546
Um, fuckin' rock pile.

730
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:41,017
Um...

731
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,303
I mean,
I used to know...

732
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,518
The guy that I met Colin through.

733
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:50,645
Fuckin', um, Dennis or...
Or Denny. Uh...

734
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,905
- Answer the fuckin' phone.
- Yeah.

735
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,662
- Yeah?
<i>- The bake sale is a go.</i>

736
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:08,753
Okay.

737
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,997
Who's that?

738
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,423
That was her.

739
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:17,383
I think.

740
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:22,135
She said, "the bake sale is a go."

741
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:37,279
(Go on and stare for ten seconds.
Go on.

742
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:43,406
I was doin' my treatment.
I got a disorder.

743
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,704
Makes my hands and feet sensitive.

744
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:49,534
Doctors never could diagnose it.
Said it was all in my head.

745
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,037
My mother said,
"well, fix that then."

746
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,167
I read that very little pain
is in the mind.

747
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,631
I can't wait to die.

748
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,176
Be a lot simpler if I could kill myself,

749
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,596
but that's a sin
and I ain't goin' to hell.

750
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,799
I'm waitin' on the lord to strike me down.

751
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,009
Smart.

752
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:11,396
Yes.
Father, your will, your way.

753
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:12,981
Take me, father.

754
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:14,892
Yes, father.

755
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,360
- So, the packet?
- Don't be rude.

756
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,187
Don't be rude.

757
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,694
- There's a way to treat a lady.
- Thank you.

758
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,619
Where's the ranger?

759
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,410
He went to Oklahoma with an Indian.

760
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,072
What kinda car did the Indian drive?

761
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,453
I think it might've been a kia.

762
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,457
Could've been a hyundai.

763
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,589
Just say how the fuck should I know?

764
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:43,678
I like boys like y'all...

765
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:48,555
That don't get hung up
on having a long life.

766
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,599
Say thank you.

767
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:57,631
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

768
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:58,894
Welcome.

769
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:03,106
- Should we go or...
- Yeah.

770
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,361
- Yeah.
- Okay.

771
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,819
Hey, dude.

772
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,530
What the fuck are you doin' in here?

773
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:13,374
I got the flu.
I came over here to rest.

774
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,292
Those trailers are so uncomfortable.

775
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,900
We shouldn't hang out here
except when it's necessary.

776
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,166
- It could look weird.
- I'm not. It's one day, relax.

777
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:24,673
You expectin' somebody?

778
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,675
It's just johnna,
she's bringing me some soup.

779
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:30,183
You better not be letting her
in on anything, I mean it.

780
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,886
It's soup.
Would you fuckin' chill?

781
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:36,231
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hey. He's in there.

782
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,351
I knew you'd be sick,

783
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:43,030
because I was sick two days ago.
I brought you chicken broth.

784
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,148
Just broth, no soup?

785
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,450
Trust me. You're the doctor.

786
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,619
I'm a nurse actually.

787
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,415
Whoa, this is a nice house.

788
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,787
This is the nicest house
I've ever been in.

789
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,666
I mean, it could use
some touches, but, wow.

790
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,151
<i>You have a bigger quest bath...</i>

791
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:02,291
- Who all lives here?
- Our boss.

792
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,341
We can use it,
but not sleep in it.

793
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,220
Why?
Who else works at this park?

794
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,719
See? I knew this would happen.
I knew you'd become intrigued

795
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,845
of me and my glamorous lifestyle.

796
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:13,497
We work for a private firm
that's been hired

797
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,352
to evaluate the state park system.

798
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:17,188
Head ranger here was deemed unfit,

799
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,982
so he got sent to an
Indian reservation in Oklahoma.

800
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,945
We're just stayin' on to put things right
until he's replaced.

801
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:26,193
What exactly are you puttin' right?

802
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,536
Mostly just,
uh, book keepin', you know?

803
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:32,988
But if the house is empty, why...

804
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:35,080
No, can't use it.
It's a conflict of interest.

805
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,250
I mean, nobody'd really know if we did.

806
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:39,794
We only come here for meals, okay?

807
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,041
In fact we're about to leave,

808
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:43,131
s0 we should probably just...

809
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:45,584
You invite somebody else?

810
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,471
No.

811
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:59,014
Mornin'.
Uh, don't be disturbed.

812
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,646
I'm, uh, here lookin'
for a Patrick bright.

813
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,402
Uh, head ranger.

814
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:06,108
Well, we're not disturbed.

815
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,110
Ranger bright isn't available right now.

816
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,948
Maybe I should start over.

817
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,405
Okay.

818
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:16,577
I'm Barry.

819
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:19,159
I'm a good friend of...

820
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:21,961
Well, my dad was a good friend
of ranger bright's.

821
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,255
Guys started a tree service
together years ago.

822
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,337
Yeah, so, anyway,
he passed away,

823
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,718
so I'm drivin' across
the country and visiting

824
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,175
all of his old pals, you know?
Trying to...

825
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:40,939
Anyway. Uh, he always said ranger bright
was one of the good guys, so...

826
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:43,437
Here we are.

827
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:46,611
He is indeed, but unfortunately
he's not here right now.

828
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:49,231
We're the junior rangers.
I'm mollar, that's Suarez.

829
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:56,155
- Junior rangers?
- That's what I said.

830
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,950
Sorry you came all this way.

831
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,120
Bright's at a convention in Tulsa.
Somethin' about native American's.

832
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,079
Oh, is he?
When's he gonna be back?

833
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:07,507
They don't tell us.
How about I take your number?

834
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,591
I'd like to get her number.

835
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,848
- We don't want any trouble.
- No, no, no trouble.

836
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,349
Oh... you two?

837
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,273
Well, I wouldn't wanna break up
such a lovely couple.

838
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,629
No danger of that, Barry.

839
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,894
I'm smarter than you and younger.

840
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,570
- Are you?
- Mm-hmm.

841
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,699
Well, I'm rich.
I'm not a junior anything.

842
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:38,197
Barry, I could buy
that pretty little truck

843
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,031
out from under you with 100-dollar bills.

844
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,246
- Could you?
- Mm-hmm.

845
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:42,938
- Okay, fun's over, man.
- Man, it'd take a lot them

846
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,106
- 100-dollar bills, buddy.
- See you soon.

847
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,371
Hey, if you... hey!

848
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,542
<i>Hey, where'd you get all them
100-dollar bills, huh, little man?</i>

849
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:52,719
<i>Huh?</i>

850
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,387
Is that true about the hundreds?

851
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:55,714
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

852
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,596
Mostly.
It's complicated.

853
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,972
<i>All the storage you need and...</i>

854
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,146
Junior rangers...

855
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,858
Right?

856
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:07,025
And I thought bright
was at remedial training?

857
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:09,353
No he... he is.
It's, um...

858
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,863
It's... yeah. It's just all...
It's all complicated.

859
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,452
It's boring. You don't wanna...
You don't even wanna...

860
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,415
What are we gonna do
with the money we got from this run?

861
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:34,961
Put it in the dryer with the rest.

862
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,889
Frog will probably be impressed
we held onto it this long, you know?

863
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:40,137
Probably already counted it as just lost.

864
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,344
How much you think he knows?

865
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:45,556
Uh, maybe only that something's not right.

866
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,934
Maybe he knows about every piss we take.

867
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:54,861
- Maybe Barry works for frog, too.
- Holy shit.

868
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,612
Also a possibility.

869
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,103
You know, you might be right.

870
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:00,533
Maybe we should get a gun.

871
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,786
I actually might know
a pawn shop we could check out.

872
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,421
It's not Halloween.

873
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,503
What are these kids doing at my door?

874
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:18,134
Oh, Halloween's for baptists.

875
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,704
I suppose that's true.

876
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:22,884
Come on in.

877
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:24,678
Thank you.

878
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:27,014
- You remember me?
- Well...

879
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:29,979
I didn't forget ya.

880
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,939
This is my buddy, ed.

881
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,064
- Hello, ed.
- Hey.

882
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,034
- We need guns.
- A gun, singular.

883
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:42,032
For what?

884
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:45,365
Well, we work over at the park,
and we got our vacation coming up.

885
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:49,752
We like to shoot targets to relax,
but all we have is these shitty rifles.

886
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,959
Our boss said
we should try here for handguns.

887
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:55,758
Ranger bright said you should
try to get a gun from me?

888
01:06:56,179 --> 01:07:00,639
Oh, yeah. He really respects you.
Said nothing mystifies you.

889
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:03,557
Hmm.

890
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:07,729
Shit. Hang on.

891
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,901
It's the seventh inning here.
Boys are down.

892
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,899
<i>Freeman did and just like that...</i>

893
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,605
- All righty.
<i>- There's one out...</i>

894
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,565
Yeah, we get that game going here.

895
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:21,514
<i>He tried to get a little
fancy there and it didn't work out.</i>

896
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,224
- Sorry about that.
<i>- He really took that lead and...</i>

897
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:24,988
- Where were we?
- Guns.

898
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,708
That's right.

899
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,208
Well, I ain't got no guns, but, uh,

900
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,004
you can go to little rock
and get ya a gun.

901
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:36,208
Well, we got a real problem
with city guns.

902
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,850
We want somethin' from out in the sticks
that someone's dead daddy owned.

903
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,257
What's the plan for you two?

904
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:48,644
- You know, in life?
- Excuse me?

905
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,059
Well...

906
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,066
It's not too late to get on
a raft and float downstream...

907
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,704
Because bad things can happen to those
that don't pay the community fees.

908
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:11,751
You're a little nutty.

909
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,410
I love it.

910
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:22,717
It's fair to say that you traffic
in some underground goods.

911
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:26,303
What's the going rate
for a set of human bones?

912
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,050
<i>That ball swung on.</i>

913
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:32,063
<i>There's a high drive
into right center field and boy,</i>

914
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,852
<i>this is gonna hurt us.</i>

915
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:38,062
Depends on the person.

916
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,192
You gonna sell us a gun or not?

917
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,573
No, I am not...

918
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,031
Because in your line of work...

919
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:50,157
Guns is as likely to get you killed
as it is to protect ya.

920
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,333
And what line of work is that?

921
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,207
Rangering.

922
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,261
Hmm.

923
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,546
What's your line of work?

924
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,306
Guess I'm a ranger, too.

925
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:15,598
Guess we all are.

926
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,112
Yeah.

927
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:21,691
Okay.

928
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,191
Thanks for the smoke.

929
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,176
- Where's swin?
- Joggin'.

930
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,221
Said the increased oxygen flow
helps his brain.

931
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,883
Hmm.

932
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,602
Can I help you with somethin'?

933
01:09:56,693 --> 01:10:00,231
I need to know
how long you're stayin'...

934
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,983
And don't say to ask swin.

935
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,822
It's impossible to tell right now
and that's the truth.

936
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,278
He doesn't tell me a thing.

937
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,365
He won't even tell me
where his family lives.

938
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,418
Well, at this moment
we have no plans to leave.

939
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,625
Okay.

940
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,461
You don't need to tell me
anything exact, but...

941
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,297
How bad is it?

942
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:31,675
What you two do?

943
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:36,304
I mean, if you got caught,
how long a sentence are we talking?

944
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:39,933
Rangers in trainin'?

945
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:43,444
Park auditors?
I'm not stupid.

946
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:46,355
I should check you for a wire.

947
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,200
Right.

948
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:54,910
I like you, johnna,
but the truth is I don't know you.

949
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:59,202
Where would I hide a wire?

950
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:02,793
Oh, okay.

951
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,463
Yeah, okay.

952
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,386
Well, it's hard to say
about jail sentences.

953
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:16,811
I mean, rapists get off,
pot heads go to prison.

954
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:20,556
Depends what kinda evidence
they got or who rats you out.

955
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,225
Sometimes you can buy a way out.

956
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,818
What is all this?
Are you all right?

957
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:32,201
I'm pregnant.

958
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,911
I'm pregnant.

959
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,910
And I'm tryin' to figure out
how to tell swin.

960
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,537
I mean, I...

961
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:42,290
I could always make
somethin' up and dump him.

962
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:45,374
No. No, you can't do that.

963
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,718
Well, you can if you want, but...

964
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,922
I think you should face...

965
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,508
Look, I don't know
what I'm trying to say.

966
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,304
Should you be eating all that candy?

967
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:01,765
I just wanna know where I stand.

968
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:05,362
Yeah?

969
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:08,563
A lot of people think
that parenting is impossible,

970
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,398
because their own parents were lousy.

971
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,985
Yeah, I don't know anyone
who had good parents.

972
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,445
I didn't...

973
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,121
And I turned out all right.

974
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:33,550
We're drug runners.

975
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:35,805
I ike wholesale.

976
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:40,599
We make runs all through
the south down to Florida...

977
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,857
And park ranger bright,
he was our boss.

978
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:48,819
A few weeks ago a guy followed us back
from a run and killed bright.

979
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,232
We didn't know what to do
or who to tell, so...

980
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,110
We buried bright's body in the park,

981
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,446
and I went back and I killed
the guy's grandfather.

982
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,203
Now we're flyin' blind.

983
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:04,585
Sittin' on all this cash.
We don't know what to do with it

984
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,253
or who to give it to, we just...

985
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:09,583
We keep takin' assignments
as they come and doin' our best.

986
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,426
If we were gonna run away
we'd have done it already...

987
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,300
As soon as we found the bodies.

988
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:40,947
Who am I kiddin'?

989
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,657
These trailers are pieces of shit.

990
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,747
We might as well live up
at bright's house.

991
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,965
We need to go shopping this weekend.

992
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,750
This weekend.

993
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,762
We need to get a stroller,
crib, that kinda thing.

994
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,088
The list is long.

995
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:58,889
I can't this weekend,
we got work.

996
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:01,975
Okay. Where are you goin'?

997
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,227
I would love to tell you
every little thing that we do,

998
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:09,309
but it's better for you if I don't.

999
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,566
You sound stupid
when you say stuff like that.

1000
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:14,564
You don't think it's kinda sexy?

1001
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,784
I never thought anything
was sexy in my life.

1002
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,870
I don't.

1003
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,912
Why did you get a soda?
We got that here.

1004
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:29,837
Value meal.

1005
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,503
That old frat boy came back.

1006
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:37,962
He is determined.

1007
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,348
Hey, sweetheart, where you goin'?

1008
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,675
You ain't gonna say hi?

1009
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,766
Oh, you never called.

1010
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:49,273
I didn't wanna torture you.

1011
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:53,311
Hey, Barry.
Is your daddy still dead?

1012
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:57,023
Yep. I take it, uh,
Mr. bright ain't available?

1013
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:58,608
Afraid not.

1014
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:00,659
Bright actually got transferred
to Oklahoma.

1015
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,080
Oklahoma.

1016
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:08,876
- Come on, where is he?
- Barry, what makes you think

1017
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:11,375
that I'd give a flying fuck
if you talk to bright or not?

1018
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:20,929
Anybody thirsty?

1019
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,372
Barry, I think
it'd be best if we made you

1020
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:27,136
that lemonade to go
and got you on your way.

1021
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:32,316
We should do that.

1022
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:38,281
Why would I bother myself tryin'
to figure all this out anyway, you know?

1023
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,454
You know what's funny?

1024
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:47,869
Every time I come over here...

1025
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,461
You boys are here,
just hangin' out.

1026
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:57,883
Nothin' to do, hmm?

1027
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:01,508
Seem a bit suspicious to you?

1028
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,555
Hmm?

1029
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:10,304
How about you?
You know where Mr. bright is?

1030
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,230
Oh, my god.
Don't look, don't look.

1031
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,049
Look at me, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

1032
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,609
Hey, look at me.
Don't look at him.

1033
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:21,315
You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

1034
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,446
It's okay.

1035
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:25,994
You're one of us now.

1036
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,633
You know, this time a year ago
I was in grad school.

1037
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:45,430
<i>Keep goin'.</i>

1038
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,883
<i>Ah, fuck!</i>

1039
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,550
Come on back with the gatlin's.

1040
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:42,196
Go on. All right, ready?

1041
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:43,318
Check it out.

1042
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:48,278
- Mm. Not bad.
- This you boys' station?

1043
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,826
We're full in our rights to use it.

1044
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:52,865
How much for an oil change?

1045
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:56,328
- No charge.
- Well, it has to cost somethin'.

1046
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:58,253
We don't need money.
We live with our aunt.

1047
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,375
Bring it over.

1048
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,250
I'm Tim, he's Thomas.

1049
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,628
How long you been outta school?

1050
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,714
- We can read.
- And then some.

1051
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,517
What does your aunt think
you do all day?

1052
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,891
Our aunt don't really care
what we do all day.

1053
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,392
She believes what we tell her.

1054
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:20,856
What if you told her
y'all went off to college?

1055
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:23,562
Well, she'd think we was off to college.

1056
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,565
How do you like being mechanics?

1057
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,908
We think it ain't gonna work out.

1058
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:31,453
Well, it happens,
I'm in the black market game.

1059
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:36,163
Happens I'm lookin' for some help.

1060
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:39,916
So what do you say?

1061
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,756
You guys wanna try workin' for me?

1062
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:44,883
What's the title?

1063
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:49,849
Oh, uh...

1064
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,510
Senior distribution executive.

1065
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:58,305
It's a good position
for two corn fed white boys.

1066
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:02,814
I'm only gonna say this one time,
so listen the fuck up.

1067
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:04,111
Y'all listenin'?

1068
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:05,758
- Yep.
- We're listenin'.

1069
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,280
I'm the boss.

1070
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:11,156
You may never refuse an order
and you may never quit.

1071
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,741
If you decide to run off...

1072
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:18,580
I will hunt ya down and I'll kill ya,
no matter how much I've grown to like ya.

1073
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:21,413
You're not allowed
to bring girls around,

1074
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:24,419
and you will not show out
and make a fool outta me.

1075
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,377
Tim, you'll no longer wear that earring.

1076
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,382
You take the damn thing out right now.

1077
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:32,055
- Yes, sir.
- In time...

1078
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:36,302
You two might take over the operations,
cutting me in for a percentage.

1079
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:38,679
You're different people now.

1080
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,351
You're drug dealers.

1081
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:21,347
Tim, Thomas?

1082
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:22,932
Mornin', boss.

1083
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:27,024
- What are you kiddies up to?
- Just makin' doughnuts.

1084
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:29,025
Asleep at the wheel of the American dream.

1085
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:34,110
The ovens are busted,
ain't got no doughnuts.

1086
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,370
Only thing for sale
is this painting of Tim and Thomas.

1087
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:40,749
And, uh, this right here...

1088
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,997
For the right price.

1089
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,750
- I'm not lookin' for doughnuts.
- Well, good for you.

1090
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,175
I et's cut the bullshit.

1091
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:54,964
- Come again?
- Knoxville wants to buy everything

1092
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,924
you can get your hands on
in the next ten days.

1093
01:20:57,019 --> 01:21:00,682
- You mean Conway from Knoxville?
- I said Knoxville, didn't 1?

1094
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,192
Well, I'm not sure
what I can get my hands on.

1095
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:09,770
Find out.

1096
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:17,246
Hmm.

1097
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,081
Attitude.

1098
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,246
It's everything.
We talked about that.

1099
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,252
We cleaned everyone out.

1100
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,207
I bet there ain't no spec of coke
in the whole god dang state.

1101
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,085
You sure you want us to leave?

1102
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:35,091
Yeah, I don't want Knoxville
getting nervous at the sight of you two.

1103
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:38,428
<i>Don't worry, this ain't my first rodeo.</i>

1104
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:40,516
<i>- Go on, get.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1105
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:05,284
You know, if you think
you're good enough to outdo a man...

1106
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:07,794
That's what you do.

1107
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:29,152
If you're wrong...

1108
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:31,526
You pay the price.

1109
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:36,278
- Hey, um...
- Attitude.

1110
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:37,824
I don't know anything.

1111
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:42,120
That's just the way things
play out in this kinda life.

1112
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,198
I try not to take it personally.

1113
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:51,709
Am I gonna die?

1114
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:20,443
Seven-fifty in cash,
half a million in assets.

1115
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,490
This is what you call next level.

1116
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,155
We got buyin' power now.

1117
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,457
We need to expand.

1118
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:29,910
Well, gang bangers are taking
more streets day by day.

1119
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,917
We're gonna have to set up
some high-end exclusives.

1120
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,589
But what do you think, frog?

1121
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:38,802
I think you can grow the business
any damn way you wanna grow the business.

1122
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:42,347
It's your business now.
You do what you want with it.

1123
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:44,433
I trust you.

1124
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:47,874
You feeling all right, boss?

1125
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:50,059
Maybe you took
too many hits to the head.

1126
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:55,854
The only mistake my mentor ever made,
was not knowin' when to step aside and...

1127
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:59,197
I don't want it to be like that with us.

1128
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:02,234
Yeah, it's time I handed it over.

1129
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:05,074
You boys are ready.

1130
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:11,326
<i>Semi-retirement has a luxurious tone
to it, don't you think?</i>

1131
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:15,581
<i>It does to me.</i>

1132
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,968
<i>I'll find me a small place
out in the country,</i>

1133
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:22,091
<i>maybe over by bright's park.</i>

1134
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,590
<i>I'll open up a little curio shop.</i>

1135
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,893
<i>Sleep late, go to bed early,
sell people shit</i>

1136
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,220
<i>they don't need in between.</i>

1137
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:31,805
We wanna have as much
good debt as possible.

1138
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,357
One day we're gonna be
level six investors.

1139
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:36,605
Right.
Like true capitalists...

1140
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:39,029
<i>I'll be like those
mob bosses in movies.</i>

1141
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,570
<i>"Sittin" around in pizza joints,
gettin' fat.</i>

1142
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:47,909
<i>It's a privilege I owe to you.</i>

1143
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:51,117
<i>You boys have made this possible...</i>

1144
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:55,124
<i>And unless there are people
stupid enough to provoke me...</i>

1145
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,879
<i>Stupid enough to create
a threat to us or our business,</i>

1146
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:02,803
<i>be it through youth
or cockiness or ignorance...</i>

1147
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:07,724
<i>Or whatever brand of idiocy
it would require...</i>

1148
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,643
<i>I'll gladly lie dormant
in my little shell...</i>

1149
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,895
<i>While you two run the show.</i>

1150
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:25,568
Sorry about that.

1151
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,370
Where were we?

1152
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:41,504
<i>My actions don't seem
fo have any consequence.</i>

1153
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:44,886
<i>Someone might still come to kill us,</i>

1154
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,510
<i>but it seems less likely
with each passing day.</i>

1155
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:52,140
<i>Near as I can tell,
bright's death was my promotion.</i>

1156
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,141
<i>I guess as long
as his operation is runnin',</i>

1157
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,850
<i>frog don't care who's runnin' it.</i>

1158
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:01,186
<i>- Cornelius.</i>
- Beautiful.

1159
01:26:01,281 --> 01:26:02,862
- Beautiful.
- Like <i>planet of the apes.</i>

1160
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:05,315
- Oh, yeah.
<i>- I'd like to meet frog.</i>

1161
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,679
It's a good movie though.

1162
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,097
<i>I'd like to know
what he thinks of me,</i>

1163
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:10,988
<i>as much for curiosity's sake
as self-preservation.</i>

1164
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,537
<i>I'd like to look him in the eye...</i>

1165
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:18,917
<i>And see if it looks like a mirror.</i>

1166
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:28,176
Packets on hold
until I talk to ranger bright.

1167
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:30,177
What?

1168
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:33,927
What?
Oh!

1169
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,638
Y'all interrupting my exercise time.

1170
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:37,813
Exercise?

1171
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:41,644
Why would you be exercising
if you wanna die as soon as possible?

1172
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:46,027
I wonder what your rude friend
wants to do if I don't have a packet, hmm?

1173
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:48,359
I intend to kill you by strangulation.

1174
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:51,828
Now, it'll be suicide,
'cause I'm giving you a fuckin' warning.

1175
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:53,621
Why not just shoot me?

1176
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:55,665
All I brought are my big strong hands.

1177
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:58,710
What, do you roll the ball
around in a circle 500 times?

1178
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:00,333
Shut your ass up.

1179
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:01,960
Is this an order from frog?

1180
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,751
Frog said no more packets until he
finds out what's happenin' over here?

1181
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:06,881
That's right.

1182
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:08,852
He wants to know what happened
to ranger bright.

1183
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:11,452
Right, and we're probably supposed to
tell you so you can tell him.

1184
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:13,637
- Right.
- Bull fuckin' shit.

1185
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:15,515
Are you the boss of this whole thing?

1186
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:18,013
- Don't be an idiot.
- Wait a minute.

1187
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:21,225
Are you the frogman?

1188
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:23,355
You have no intuition.

1189
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:24,732
Intuition is for women.

1190
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,697
You don't need to worry
about intuition right now.

1191
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:32,361
What you need to worry about is the fact
that you're an unnecessary middleman.

1192
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:34,321
We've been thinking about streamlining.

1193
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,499
Frog will be impressed if we can make
this operation more efficient.

1194
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:38,746
You are superfluous.

1195
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:42,333
What the fuck does that mean?
You can't do that.

1196
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:43,880
You can't streamline.

1197
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,820
We do a whole bunch of shit
we're not supposed to do.

1198
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:47,960
Frog don't seem to mind.
You don't understand.

1199
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:51,506
I'm a buffer.
I'm a vital layer of insulation.

1200
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,058
Mmm.

1201
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:59,938
I'm convinced you have a packet in here,
and I refuse to tear the place up.

1202
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:03,567
Now, you're gonna hobble
right over and get it for me.

1203
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:05,894
How does one practice intuition?

1204
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:08,688
- Do you pray?
- Mm-hmm.

1205
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:11,571
Most prayers sound hollow in your head.

1206
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:14,027
But every once in a while one echoes.

1207
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:16,662
That's the same as intuition.

1208
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:18,828
I'll pray for you if you pray for me.

1209
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:19,954
The packet!

1210
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:22,998
It's stuffed in the ball you asshole.

1211
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:25,796
- What the fuck?
- Why would you hide it from us?

1212
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:28,250
'Cause I was scared, just like y'all are.

1213
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:30,586
Now, I wanna know
what happened to ranger bright.

1214
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,760
He was my friend.

1215
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:33,429
Your friend? Yes.

1216
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:35,428
You think that distributing
a Manila envelope

1217
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:37,430
every two weeks constitutes a friendship?

1218
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:40,012
To me and the ranger it did.

1219
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:44,269
Oh.

1220
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,518
We're not scared.

1221
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:49,695
You said we're scared,
same as you, but that's wrong.

1222
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:52,615
We're not.

1223
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,109
Consider that your baby shower.

1224
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:48,538
I'm sorry.

1225
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,040
You're right.

1226
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:56,134
"Sandra bullock is the happiest
she's ever been."

1227
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,055
She views her divorce
and its fall out

1228
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:00,179
"as a blessing
and something she grew from."

1229
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:02,681
I'm sorry,
but those magazines

1230
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:05,058
are the canary and the coal mine
of western civilization.

1231
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:09,143
- Stop it. They're fun.
- It's materialism run rampant.

1232
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:11,853
All that celebrity worship
and trash culture.

1233
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:14,439
It's drivin' everybody crazy
and they don't even realize it.

1234
01:30:14,534 --> 01:30:16,320
Keep talking, professor.

1235
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:18,402
What do you think
all these zombie movies

1236
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,738
and post-apocalyptic stories
are about the last few years?

1237
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,369
- What?
- All these children's novels

1238
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,187
about over throwin'
the government and fighting

1239
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:26,939
- each other to death.
- What are you talkin' about?

1240
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:28,828
It's mass projection.

1241
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:31,461
Everybody wants the world to end,

1242
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:33,946
because if that's what's passing
for the American dream these days

1243
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,380
they all wanna opt out.

1244
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:40,557
- Of what?
- Of everything, fuckin' society.

1245
01:30:40,644 --> 01:30:43,306
Is that what you picture you did?
Opt out?

1246
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:45,182
Touché.

1247
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,480
You wanna know the big reveal?

1248
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,478
- Hmm?
- You can't opt out.

1249
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:53,649
You can't, I tried.
I thought I had done it.

1250
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,355
But look at me.

1251
01:30:57,327 --> 01:31:00,285
Here I am.
Still ended up with a boss, a job,

1252
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:02,283
and a wacky coworker
and a baby on the way.

1253
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:11,004
It's a boy.

1254
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:23,763
Is that a fact?

1255
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:25,893
It is.

1256
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:29,188
- Boy?
- Yeah.

1257
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:37,022
I'd like to get the baby
some savings bonds for, you know,

1258
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:38,402
save up for college.

1259
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:42,322
Or clown school?

1260
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:47,119
Or open a gun range.

1261
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:53,918
Why won't you marry me?

1262
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:01,596
I don't not want to get married, but...

1263
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,888
We're still in the infatuation stage.

1264
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:09,892
Even though we're having a kid together
there's no denying that we're infatuated.

1265
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:12,224
That would be hard to deny.

1266
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:16,478
We should wait until after we're not
attracted to each other anymore

1267
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:19,485
to make a decision about marriage.

1268
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:22,409
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What if that never happens?

1269
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:25,578
Just give it time.

1270
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:35,163
Colin was killed.

1271
01:32:36,426 --> 01:32:38,883
Cops busted into his shop and shot him...

1272
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:42,261
Lookin' for information about a car

1273
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:44,964
and a dead kid they pulled
outta the swamp.

1274
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:49,894
Ranger bright's body
hasn't been found, but...

1275
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,390
I'm pretty sure he's been killed, too.

1276
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:56,810
<i>I sent Barry over there to investigate.</i>

1277
01:32:57,781 --> 01:32:59,191
<i>Now he's missing.</i>

1278
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:05,576
<i>They come here
and scare you half to death.</i>

1279
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:12,583
Then they stop by my shop,
ask me if I wanted to...

1280
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,415
Purchase a set of human bones.

1281
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:19,631
These two are supposed to be
workin' for me.

1282
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:23,795
<i>They're about the worst enemies
I've ever had.</i>

1283
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:30,184
<i>I never had anybody kill my
associates or steal my money.</i>

1284
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:34,522
Whether they have a plan...

1285
01:33:35,735 --> 01:33:39,068
Or they're just lost in a maze
of their own fuck ups,

1286
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:40,645
it don't matter now.

1287
01:33:41,491 --> 01:33:42,571
They're stupid.

1288
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:46,985
<i>That's what makes them dangerous.</i>

1289
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:50,872
They'll be caught soon.

1290
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:55,247
<i>And whatever happens
after they've been caught...</i>

1291
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:57,541
<i>Well...</i>

1292
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:02,384
Whatever would've happened
after they've been caught

1293
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:03,960
ain't never gonna happen.

1294
01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:10,850
<i>You're gonna give 'em one last package.</i>

1295
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:16,439
<i>One last trip.</i>

1296
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,361
<i>Somethin' to make them
feel comfortable.</i>

1297
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,406
<i>Make it close to hot Springs.</i>

1298
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:32,117
<i>They'll feel lucky like, uh...</i>

1299
01:34:33,293 --> 01:34:35,033
<i>Something's goin' right for 'em.</i>

1300
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,212
<i>Nothing's ever gonna go right
for them again.</i>

1301
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:02,143
Love you, baby.

1302
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:05,108
Sure you do.

1303
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:22,713
We shouldn't be here.

1304
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:33,682
Gray Cyprus, Kentucky.
Tell johnna, gray Cyprus.

1305
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:34,770
What'd you say?

1306
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:36,390
- That's your sisters?
- Mm-hmm.

1307
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:37,596
Don't be talkin' in code.

1308
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:40,848
Is he your brother or your husband?

1309
01:35:40,944 --> 01:35:43,230
He's funny.

1310
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:46,274
Frisk 'em.

1311
01:36:00,255 --> 01:36:02,746
- They're clean.
- Get in the tub.

1312
01:36:07,136 --> 01:36:10,503
You, come on.
Let's go. Get.

1313
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:11,928
Let's go.

1314
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:25,151
Let's go.
Let's go, move.

1315
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:28,359
Oh, you act tough now,
but we'll be friends.

1316
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:30,833
Everybody that meets me
wants to be my friend.

1317
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:39,995
We work for you, don't we?

1318
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:47,708
So what were we supposed to do, hmm?

1319
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:50,088
What would you have done if you were us?

1320
01:36:50,179 --> 01:36:51,419
Well...

1321
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:57,176
We both know you ain't gotta do anything
to get in this spot...

1322
01:36:58,021 --> 01:36:59,602
And I ain't you.

1323
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:02,605
Not by a long shot.

1324
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:08,061
Nah, you're a fat fuckin' slob.

1325
01:37:10,408 --> 01:37:13,070
What about the pawn shop guy
that doesn't sell anything?

1326
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:14,946
What do you think?

1327
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:18,450
I was starting to think he was frog.

1328
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:29,833
He was right there the whole time.

1329
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:33,844
So this outfit's based in little rock?

1330
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:36,263
It ain't based anywhere.

1331
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:39,218
Why so secretive?
You're planning to kill me, right?

1332
01:37:39,312 --> 01:37:42,725
Oh, it's way passed the planning stages.

1333
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:46,228
First we need that cash...

1334
01:37:46,903 --> 01:37:50,111
Location of the bodies, the girl.

1335
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:51,984
You should question swin.

1336
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:53,531
I'm not bothered by torture.

1337
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:55,483
Well, if I was gonna question swin,

1338
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:58,991
I'd have to hurry, 'cause he
gonna be dead in a minute...

1339
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:01,497
And if you keep being such a pain,

1340
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:03,870
well, we'll just go ahead
and shoot you in the head, too.

1341
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:08,713
We don't need the money that bad,
and we can find the girl on our own.

1342
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,507
- The girl doesn't know shit.
- Apparently not...

1343
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:14,006
Hangin' out with you two losers.

1344
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:17,714
If I was you...

1345
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:20,470
I'd go ahead and speed the plan up.

1346
01:38:23,398 --> 01:38:26,060
Keepin' me alive is only
gonna end badly for you.

1347
01:38:27,276 --> 01:38:29,767
Don't embarrass yourself
trying to scare me.

1348
01:38:33,282 --> 01:38:35,944
Of course, your brother's
the only one allowed to have a gun,

1349
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:37,366
so we'll have to wait.

1350
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:42,359
Why don't you just go ahead
and shut the fuck up right now?

1351
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:09,353
<i>Why do people keep doin' stuff?</i>

1352
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:13,607
<i>Wipin' counters down...</i>

1353
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:18,157
<i>Takin' pictures, cheatin',
offendin' things?</i>

1354
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:21,284
Fuck is the point?

1355
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:25,998
It's evolved.

1356
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:40,179
Many schools of thought,
but, in layman's terms,

1357
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:44,134
being the most sophisticated monkey
also makes you the most confused monkey.

1358
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:47,436
So takin' action, any action at all,

1359
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:49,684
<i>is a way to alleviate that confusion.</i>

1360
01:39:49,775 --> 01:39:51,561
What's your line of work?

1361
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:55,816
Guess I'm a ranger, too.

1362
01:39:58,618 --> 01:39:59,903
Guess we all are.

1363
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:54,688
Jesus, just go ahead and tell me.

1364
01:41:57,612 --> 01:41:58,772
Uh...

1365
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:01,354
Swin was never scared.

1366
01:42:06,329 --> 01:42:09,071
He never begged or tried to sell me out.

1367
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:11,121
He was just...

1368
01:42:12,168 --> 01:42:14,250
He was exactly swin to the last.

1369
01:42:18,591 --> 01:42:21,958
You got ten minutes to pack up
and leave Arkansas for good.

1370
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:26,633
Here's the money for you and the baby.

1371
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:31,592
You go to Kentucky and you find
a town called gray Cyprus.

1372
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:33,143
That's where swin's family lives.

1373
01:42:35,566 --> 01:42:36,726
Kentucky?

1374
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:40,192
Swin's got, like, 40 sisters.

1375
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:43,528
Little guy will have more attention
than he knows what to do with.

1376
01:42:54,669 --> 01:42:57,536
The baby knows something's happening.

1377
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:02,631
His real last name's horn.

1378
01:43:05,971 --> 01:43:07,211
I know.

1379
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:15,845
You could come with me.

1380
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:20,308
No, I couldn't.
It wouldn't be safe for ya.

1381
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:23,690
I know, I just wanted
to at least have said it.

1382
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:29,609
Where... where are you gonna go?

1383
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:31,785
I don't know.

1384
01:43:35,584 --> 01:43:36,869
I liked it here...

1385
01:43:40,423 --> 01:43:43,085
"And I liked livin" with you and swin.

1386
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:45,333
I don't know where...

1387
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:15,496
<i>Kyle's gone.</i>

1388
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:17,872
<i>You got a choice to make, Thomas.</i>

1389
01:44:18,127 --> 01:44:20,869
You can spend your whole life
lookin' for revenge.

1390
01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:23,704
Go crazy...

1391
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:26,215
And ruin yourself.

1392
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:30,344
Or you can get passed it.

1393
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:32,842
Run the business.

1394
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:37,218
You hear me?

1395
01:44:37,313 --> 01:44:39,895
<i>One day we're gonna be
level six investors.</i>

1396
01:44:39,982 --> 01:44:41,835
<i>Right, like,
true capitalists, you know?</i>

1397
01:44:41,859 --> 01:44:43,599
We're gonna own everything together.

1398
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:45,776
- You know, like a team, like...
- I ike a team.

1399
01:44:45,863 --> 01:44:48,063
Yeah, yeah. Like, but like us,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1400
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:49,885
- You want some of this?
- Yes, please.

1401
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:51,694
So it's all just gone?

1402
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:54,068
That's it?

1403
01:44:54,163 --> 01:44:55,163
I'm broke?

1404
01:44:56,540 --> 01:45:00,203
Thomas sold everything.
He cashed out all the accounts.

1405
01:45:01,003 --> 01:45:02,618
Stocks, bonds, you name it.

1406
01:45:03,088 --> 01:45:05,249
He said, "time is of the essence."

1407
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:07,672
Thomas said, "time if of the essence?"

1408
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:10,136
Well...

1409
01:45:11,096 --> 01:45:13,132
He said, "hurry the hell up"
is what he said.

1410
01:45:15,184 --> 01:45:17,266
This is the danger of a joint account.

1411
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:21,095
Even if someone's like family,
hell, is family...

1412
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:25,186
We can never really be sure
what goes on in another human's mind.

1413
01:45:27,571 --> 01:45:28,686
Ain't that right?

1414
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:31,272
Mm-hmm.

1415
01:46:18,664 --> 01:46:21,531
- <i>Yeah, who's this?</i>
- Froggy from Memphis.

1416
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:24,583
- <i>Who?</i>
- Colin's boss.

1417
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:27,787
<i>I thought Colin's bosses
were two big twins.</i>

1418
01:46:27,882 --> 01:46:30,248
Yeah, I was their boss.
I had to let 'em all go.

1419
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:32,796
<i>Frog?
Frog?</i>

1420
01:46:32,887 --> 01:46:36,596
<i>Okay, I know who you are.
Figured you'd be retired by now.</i>

1421
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:39,719
I tried, but, uh, you know,
it didn't suit me.

1422
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:42,384
I'm gettin' my hand back in.

1423
01:46:42,855 --> 01:46:43,935
What I need...

1424
01:46:44,607 --> 01:46:46,723
Is a weekly shipment to Oklahoma city.

1425
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:48,690
<i>Can't do it.</i>

1426
01:46:48,777 --> 01:46:52,235
<i>In Oklahoma it's all meth,
and meth is all local.</i>

1427
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:54,405
<i>Oklahoma's a bad choice.</i>

1428
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:57,028
<i>These days it's nothin'
but scumbags in the business.</i>

1429
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:58,700
Well, there's always been scumbags.

1430
01:46:59,872 --> 01:47:01,282
I'm a scumbag.

1431
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:04,866
<i>I'll tell you what,
take this number down.</i>

1432
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:07,709
<i>Anybody who can get you
started it's cq.</i>

1433
01:47:07,796 --> 01:47:10,003
<i>- You got a pen?</i>
- Come on with it.

1434
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:12,923
<i>947-5583.</i>

1435
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:17,048
Got ya.

1436
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:19,380
<i>Like I said,
Oklahoma is no good.</i>

1437
01:47:19,725 --> 01:47:21,215
<i>Don't say I didn't warn ya.</i>

1438
01:47:38,243 --> 01:47:40,450
<i>Oklahoma's whatever I say it is.</i>

1439
01:47:41,622 --> 01:47:43,487
<i>If Arkansas is what I say it is...</i>

1440
01:47:45,084 --> 01:47:47,040
<i>Oklahoma's what I say it is.</i>

1441
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:50,502
I'll start with nothin'.

1442
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:54,130
Maybe I'll get me some new boys.

1443
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:57,755
Maybe I won't.

1444
01:47:59,848 --> 01:48:02,555
Maybe [I'll WORK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

1445
01:48:03,519 --> 01:48:05,259
That'd be a fuckin' hoot.

1446
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:17,654
One day my story will come to light.

1447
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:21,279
<i>It'll be pieced together...</i>

1448
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:24,320
<i>Passed down...</i>

1449
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:28,373
<i>Exaggerated, doubted...</i>

1450
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:32,661
<i>Insisted upon.</i>

1451
01:48:40,347 --> 01:48:42,554
I will have a grand final act.

1452
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:47,725
Looks like Thomas found ya.

1453
01:48:48,731 --> 01:48:49,846
Yeah.

1454
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:52,188
He's dead.

1455
01:48:53,944 --> 01:48:55,229
And then some.

1456
01:48:56,572 --> 01:48:59,564
<i>I'm a killer.
You're not.</i>

1457
01:49:00,034 --> 01:49:01,069
I'm smart...

1458
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:04,447
You're not.
I'm the boss.

1459
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:08,456
You may never refuse an order,
and you may never quit.

1460
01:49:08,834 --> 01:49:11,621
Now, I never asked for my life

1461
01:49:11,712 --> 01:49:13,418
to become a great story...

1462
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:16,376
But that's what's happenin' here...

1463
01:49:18,927 --> 01:49:20,838
<i>And now it's happenin' to you, too.</i>

1464
01:49:27,061 --> 01:49:28,551
<i>You're different people now.</i>

1465
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:39,315
You're drug dealers.

1466
01:50:15,651 --> 01:50:16,982
<i>I'm a drug dealer.</i>

1467
01:50:20,864 --> 01:50:23,822
<i>No one knows they're a drug dealer
until they become one.</i>

1468
01:50:29,164 --> 01:50:30,495
<i>Once they do...</i>

1469
01:50:32,167 --> 01:50:33,748
<i>There's no resignin' the post.</i>
