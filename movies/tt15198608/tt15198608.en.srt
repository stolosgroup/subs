3
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,541
Be careful!

4
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,791
Come on, move a little faster.

5
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,375
- Yes!
- Yes!

6
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,958
Yes!

7
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,666
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, shit.

8
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, man.

9
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,791
- Okay, it was close, man. It was close.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

10
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,083
Oh! Oh!

11
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,708
Give me your hand.

12
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,208
- Here.
- Thanks.

13
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,208
Wait.

14
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,583
You asshole!

15
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,791
- Woo!
- Well then.

16
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,041
- Here I come!
- Oh!

17
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,875
- Hey, guys!
- Whoo!

18
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,625
- Come on, attack! Yeah!
- Hey!

19
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,166
- Oh, bastard.
- Yeah!

20
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,583
- Bring it on. Come on, get up taller.
- Are you sure?

21
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,166
You can still back out.

22
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,416
What am I doing?

23
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,333
Ooh!

24
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,208
- Wow, oh, oh.
- Oh, oh.

25
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,750
Hey, hey!

26
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, okay... Oh!

27
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,125
Genius.

28
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,875
Oh, wow.

29
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,458
Wow, Stefan. You're a real woodsman.

30
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,375
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

31
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,916
I thought you were a biology teacher,
not a Boy Scout.

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm both.

33
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,458
Great.

34
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,000
Cold, huh?
At least the sun's coming out now, right?

35
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,791
What the hell was that?

36
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,166
So it's... hunting season?

37
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:06,791
Okay.

38
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,708
Okay.

39
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,583
So, if you're up for it,
I have a small surprise for you.

40
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,875
- It's a bit of a hike, but it's worth it.
- Oh.

41
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,958
- I'm not up for it.
- Oh, Vincent.

42
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,250
Fantastic.

43
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,208
Great idea, Stefan.

44
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:51,250
I used to come here with my dad
all the time. He loved the forest.

45
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,000
Mm.

46
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,208
I wouldn't wanna fall.

47
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,916
Well, I'm ready to go back down.

48
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,625
Yeah, give us a second, okay?

49
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,833
We need the presentation by next week.

50
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,796
I don't think they got it.
Ines never delivered anything on time.

51
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,250
I can already see myself pulling
an all-nighter just to get it done.

52
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,375
Do what you have to.

53
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,500
- Problems with Lisa?
- No, we're talking about someone else.

54
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,500
Your fiancée is the best graphic designer
we've had thus far.

55
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,083
Any news about the job?

56
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,541
What job?

57
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,291
The job for me?

58
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,791
It's in the investors' hands now.

59
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,125
They either get out of bed
on the right side tomorrow

60
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,125
and we get the financing, or not.

61
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,666
Okay.

62
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,375
I have little influence on that.

63
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,125
In the end, it comes down to good luck.

64
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,041
Yeah, I get it.

65
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,375
Well, sorry for asking.

66
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,833
Like I said, Roman,
I have little influence over it.

67
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,833
Look.

68
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,458
Aww.

69
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Cute.

70
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,208
Hmm.

71
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,458
What a cute souvenir for our trip.

72
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,708
- Careful, it gets steep again.
- Yeah.

73
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:10,041
"Five cool guys die in a lame
accident during a bachelor party."

74
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,833
"Taken in the prime of their lives."

75
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,583
Hey, stay focused, guys.

76
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,250
Aye-aye.

77
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,833
Careful.

78
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:23,833
You all right?

79
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,125
- Hold up, guys.
- What is it?

80
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,541
What's taking you guys so long?

81
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,125
- Roman!
- Huh?

82
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,916
- Faster, faster!
- Be right there!

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Come on, let's go.

84
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:45,833
Careful.

85
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,333
- You got it?
- Hmm.

86
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,375
I'm afraid of heights.

87
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:10,791
Whew.

88
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,041
Here!

89
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,041
Come on!

90
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,375
Look at me!

91
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,083
Damn!

92
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,041
Everything all right?

93
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,333
Yeah. Thanks.

94
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,250
Whew.

95
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,333
Fuck.

96
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,625
Get up.

97
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,041
Whoa!

98
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,083
You all right?

99
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,625
Yeah. Now I'm better.

100
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,333
Okay.

101
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,583
- Let's get going.
- Yeah.

102
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,125
Oh, I'm sorry.

103
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,541
Hey, what happened?

104
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,208
Got a bit too drunk last night after all?

105
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,916
No. Why?

106
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,458
I slipped. Vinny grabbed me.

107
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,458
Heroic act.

108
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,333
Oh, I see.

109
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,750
Well, then, keep it up... hero.

110
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,625
Aren't our phones for photos?

111
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,583
Just checking something.

112
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,666
Any news from Ines?

113
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:31,375
How many nude pics
do you get, dude, per week?

114
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,333
Not enough.

115
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,166
Since when do you like girls?

116
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,125
Since I met your mother.

117
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,083
Oh, such a dumbass.

118
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,083
- Shall we move on?
- Yeah.

119
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't worry too much.
Investors like us. They'll like you too.

120
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,083
I'll follow up on it for you. I promise.

121
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,708
Did they decide if I get hired? I thought
it depended on the next round of funding.

122
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:20,666
It'll be settled before the wedding.
I wouldn't screw it up for my brother.

123
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,875
Good?

124
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,083
Do you have to be like that again?

125
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:34,250
Let them be, man. His little brother
is getting married. That's damn cool.

126
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:38,291
No? And a marriage that will last.
Isn't that lucky?

127
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,375
Jealous?

128
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,625
- What?
- It's true.

129
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,666
- Well, aren't you single?
- Yes.

130
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,833
And it's quite impressive, thank you.

131
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,125
- So don't screw it up, Roman, okay?
- Yeah.

132
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,208
I'll try my best.

133
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,208
- I thought you already got the job.
- Yeah, it's a done deal.

134
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,250
Okay. If you need any help, let me know.

135
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,333
Okay.

136
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:44,791
Thank you.

137
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,916
LOVE, LISA

138
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,000
Yes!

139
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,666
We made it. Thank God!

140
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,791
Sorry, Roman.

141
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,291
I'm just exhausted.

142
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,583
Oh.

143
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,416
- That was much closer this time.
- Yeah.

144
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,125
So how do hunters know
where they're allowed to hunt or not?

145
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,958
This isn't a hunting ground anyway.

146
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,750
Shit.

147
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,583
What is it?

148
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,666
Vincent!

149
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,208
Oh, shit.

150
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,458
Where did that come from?

151
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,875
From somewhere back there.

152
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,791
- Do you have a first aid kit?
- Yes, in the car. Let's go.

153
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,333
- Hey!
- Hello! We're down here! Stop!

154
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,625
Don't shoot, okay? We are humans!

155
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,583
Shit, let's get out of here.

156
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,250
Careful. Here. I'll take this off.

157
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,125
- Careful, slowly.
- Thanks. Jacket off.

158
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,875
Fuck, this can't be happening.

159
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,458
Hurry up.

160
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,208
Hey, hold this.

161
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,041
Keep still now. Talk to me.

162
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,166
Do you and Lisa want to have kids?

163
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:47,166
- Only if they're as cute as you.
- Ah. That's pretty unlikely.

164
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,333
- Hey, guys, hurry up. Stop yapping.
- We're almost done.

165
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:52,916
Hey!

166
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,875
Help!

167
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,125
Good. That'll do for now.

168
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,791
Okay. Now to the ER, okay?

169
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,083
Get in, come on.

170
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,125
Fuck!

171
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,750
Hey!

172
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,625
Stop shooting now, you stupid idiots!

173
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,958
You've already hit one of us!

174
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,458
It's impossible they didn't hear us. Hey!

175
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,458
Shit! What are they doing?

176
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,291
Fuck.

177
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,083
Shit, guys, flat tire.

178
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,666
Shit!

179
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,833
Take cover.

180
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,416
Maybe they're not hunters.
Come on, get down. Get down!

181
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
] Down!

182
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,833
Keep calm.

183
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,208
This isn't real.

184
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,541
- I need to go to the hospital.
- How with a flat tire?

185
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,458
Stefan, how far to the goddamn road?

186
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,541
Twelve miles or so.

187
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,500
But it's an old country road.
Nobody's ever on it.

188
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,583
Yeah, but better than just sitting here.

189
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,375
What a load of shit.

190
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,041
- It has to be an accident.
- I don't know.

191
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,205
- Why would they attack us?
- We can't know for sure.

192
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,166
- So which way to the road?
- Forget the road! No one will be there.

193
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,750
Okay.

194
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,583
What are we gonna do?

195
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,125
EMERGENCY CALL

196
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,541
- We have no service.
- Oh, fuck!

197
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:47,791
Okay, let's pretend it was neither
an accident nor a fucking game. Then what?

198
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,583
How could it have been an accident?

199
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,875
- Two shots straight in our direction!
- Damn it, Peter!

200
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,333
If it's some kind of stupid game,
then...

201
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,625
- Keep calm.
- Vincent, please calm down, okay?

202
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,041
Okay.

203
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,958
Let's all get in.
We can still drive with a flat, okay?

204
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,500
- Okay.
- Okay, yes. Yeah.

205
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,583
Okay.

206
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,125
- Oh, fuck!
- Keep down!

207
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,791
- Everyone okay?
- Shit!

208
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,166
- Yes. Vincent?
- Yeah.

209
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,791
Oh, shit!

210
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,458
I think they're trying to kill us.

211
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,166
A sharpshooter.

212
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,458
Shit.

213
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,875
We have to get into the forest.
It'll be safer there.

214
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,833
- Okay.
- Yeah.

215
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,375
He'll lose our trail in there, I hope.
Can you manage that?

216
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,125
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. One after the other.

217
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,458
- Stefan, you ready?
- Yeah.

218
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,916
- Let's go!
- Go!

219
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,333
Shit! Roman!

220
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,833
My phone!

221
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,708
It's important.

222
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,583
Quiet.

223
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,583
- I don't see anybody.
- You sure?

224
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,291
Fuck!

225
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,666
Oh, great.

226
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,333
Thanks.

227
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,791
What's that? You see that?

228
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,333
It's weird.

229
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,250
Who cares, man?

230
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:30,958
Okay.

231
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,041
Guys?

232
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,458
What's the plan?

233
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,083
Hmm?

234
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,416
Which direction was the mountain
we came from? The tower?

235
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Stefan?

236
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,291
What about compass directions?
Where's the closest town?

237
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,291
Man, I don't know.

238
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,791
That's great.
It just wasn't enough for you, guys.

239
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,875
Boozing in a bar
and a round of strippers.

240
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,291
Sorry.

241
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,541
Don't mushrooms only grow
on the north-facing side of trees?

242
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,583
Some grow on south-facing slopes.
Others everywhere. That won't help us.

243
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,833
Right. That's educational and fascinating
to know where mushrooms grow,

244
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,000
Where would we go if we knew
on which side and in which direction?

245
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,250
Look, what we need is a plan.
Don't you have any ideas?

246
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,333
Huh?

247
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,208
There was the highway, right?
We could flag someone down.

248
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:21,041
I saw a large road. I'm sure of it.
when we were up on the tower.

249
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,208
- Yes, he's right, guys.
- Didn't you take a picture?

250
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,041
Yeah, I did.

251
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,708
Here.

252
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,375
- This picture?
- Yeah. To the right here.

253
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,541
But it's not as close as it looks.
It's in the southwest.

254
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,208
Okay, that direction.

255
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,166
- Okay.
- Okay.

256
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,000
If our woodsman says so then.

257
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,541
You okay?

258
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,791
Thanks.

259
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,250
Ouch! Fuck! Ah, shit!

260
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,250
- What is it?
- Shit, guys!

261
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,291
I'm stuck. Can you come help me?

262
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,666
Careful, don't use force.

263
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,833
- Shall we? Now.
- Good.

264
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,333
- Come on.
- Yeah.

265
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,541
- Just great.
- Hey.

266
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,208
Okay.

267
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,458
Ah! Fuck!

268
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,041
Roman!

269
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,333
Lisa?

270
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:29,875
Let's sit down.

271
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,416
Maybe that was it.

272
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,458
No one's out there.

273
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,208
We haven't seen anybody yet.

274
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,833
And now we are a hunter's game.

275
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,166
Let's go.

276
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,000
Weren't we here before?

277
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:33,791
No.

278
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,041
- You sure?
- Yes.

279
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,666
Oh, shit.

280
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,458
Highway's somewhere that way.

281
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,333
Okay.

282
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,458
There. Here's good.

283
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,125
Careful. Here.

284
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,250
Go.

285
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,000
There you go, then. Okay.

286
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,875
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

287
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,916
- Fuck!
- Here.

288
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,583
Damn it! I got it. Out of the way!

289
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:41,666
- Hey, hey!
- Get off!

290
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,375
- Come on. Shut the fuck up!
- What?

291
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,083
Hey, hey, hey, are you okay?

292
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:50,625
Wait, hey, wait.

293
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:53,833
Here.

294
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:56,500
For your shoe, okay?

295
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:00,666
We have to work together, okay?

296
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,208
Mm-hmm. Go fuck yourself, okay?

297
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,541
Take off your shoe now.

298
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,541
- Come on.
- Yeah!

299
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,166
Just fucking great.

300
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:39,041
I can't believe this shit.

301
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,458
Okay.

302
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,000
He's getting on my nerves.

303
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,041
Thanks for waiting.

304
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,583
Do you think we lost him?

305
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:09,666
Maybe.

306
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,708
Sure, or maybe not.

307
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:16,000
But if he wanted to shoot us,
he'd have done so already, right?

308
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,458
Wait a second.

309
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,041
What?

310
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,083
Don't you hear?

311
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,208
A helicopter.

312
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,666
Hey, hey, hey!

313
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,000
- Hey!
- Not so loud, man!

314
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,625
But I feel like being loud.
I want to leave!

315
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:40,916
Shut your damn mouth!

316
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:44,875
Fuck!

317
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:57,291
I'm done.

318
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,625
Oh, man!

319
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:08,541
How long have we not been shot at now?
We can do this!

320
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:10,625
Let's go!

321
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:21,458
Hey.

322
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:25,666
Vincent.

323
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:28,833
Please.

324
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:14,708
Which way now?

325
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,041
That way.

326
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,416
Okay.

327
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,416
You sure, woodsman?

328
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:23,708
I'm sure.

329
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,125
Hey, guys.

330
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,750
- What is it?
- There's someone.

331
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,333
Hello!

332
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,125
Hello! Hey!

333
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,125
We need help!

334
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:08,625
Hello!

335
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,583
Excuse us, we need some help, please.

336
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,458
Our friend's been shot.

337
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:31,291
Oh, fuck! Shit!

338
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,125
- Shit.
- What is it?

339
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,208
I twisted my ankle.

340
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,083
Shit.

341
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,583
What about Stefan?

342
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:49,416
You saw it.

343
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,500
He's dead! The cunt just popped him.

344
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:55,375
- No, he's not. Why would she...
- Half his head was gone!

345
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:56,666
No, that's insane!

346
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,416
It is what it is now.

347
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:06,333
- We need to go! Come on! Go!
- Wait, wait, wait!

348
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,666
Wait.

349
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:12,791
- Jesus, pull yourself together for once!
- Give him a second, okay?

350
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:13,875
I'll watch out.

351
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,750
Just a second. One second.

352
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,375
- Are you gonna be fine?
- Yes, I will.

353
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:21,916
It's nothing.

354
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,291
Oh, shit!

355
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,625
Holy shit.

356
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:37,416
Excuse me, that's not nothing.
That's pretty fucking bad!

357
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,892
- Quiet.
- Be quiet!

358
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,125
Hey!

359
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,500
Fuck!

360
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:42,583
We're fucked!

361
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:46,166
All right? How are you going to run away
if we're shot at again?

362
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,916
If you have any idea, please, share!

363
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,833
What are you trying to say?

364
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:53,708
Huh?

365
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:56,666
Erm...

366
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,541
Every man for himself.

367
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:07,208
The four of us go in different directions.
She can't split into four guys.

368
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:10,125
- What about Albert?
- Didn't you just say you'd be fine?

369
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:13,000
Guys, we need to stick together. Please!

370
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,083
We can't endanger ourselves either.

371
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:20,833
Endanger?

372
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:25,708
Roman.

373
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:27,000
Vincent.

374
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,666
Don't leave me behind, okay?

375
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,250
Dude, of course not.

376
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:39,458
Please, chill out, guys. Stay calm.

377
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,291
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

378
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,458
- Sure.
- She's just a woman, right?

379
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:45,708
Who has a rifle
and has been shooting at us.

380
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,000
And what do we have? A pocket knife.
A cell phone with no signal or battery.

381
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,791
You were shot
and he can't walk properly.

382
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:56,083
The only guy who knew his way
around the forest is gone. Fuck!

383
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,208
Why did she have to kill him?

384
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,666
That's enough! Okay?

385
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,875
Anyway, I'm good to go. Come on.

386
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:11,083
Let's go.
What are you waiting for?

387
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,791
- Let's get out of here.
- Roman...

388
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,083
Your brother's a problem.

389
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,750
Okay. But he is my brother.

390
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,625
Whatever that means, pal.

391
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,666
Ow.

392
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,583
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

393
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,083
Just distract me.

394
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,708
- Number-guessing?
- Okay.

395
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:54,583
The bigger number wins.

396
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:00,916
- Eight.
- Three.

397
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,250
I stand no chance against you.

398
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:10,208
Tell me something from your life
that I don't know yet.

399
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,166
I'm a very shallow and selfish person.

400
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:18,250
That I already knew.
Good thing I'm not marrying you.

401
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:21,416
For sure.

402
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:25,958
- I should give you the bracelet back.
- Don't you dare.

403
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:28,125
It's a symbol of our undying love, Roman.

404
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,375
Has Albert got in touch yet?

405
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,958
Oh, he, huh...
He said he thinks it's a good idea.

406
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:49,000
- But it'll take a while.
- Okay.

407
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:50,625
Okay?

408
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:56,541
- And how do you like the idea?
- It's good. It's a good company.

409
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:01,625
Yeah, depends on what you're looking for.

410
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,041
And by "you" you mean me?

411
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,625
Just don't let yourself
get screwed over, okay?

412
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:14,208
I won't.

413
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:17,416
But you're happy there too, right?

414
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:20,208
Yes, but I'm not his little brother.

415
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,500
Just take care of yourself, okay?

416
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,500
I want to work for him, not marry him.

417
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,666
Could you, legally speaking?

418
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:33,958
Be careful now.

419
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:37,250
You better not say another word because,
you know what?

420
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:40,625
I think I missed a spot... Yeah, ooh.
That's a big spot, actually. Wait.

421
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:43,666
You jerk!

422
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:13,375
Are you all right?

423
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:15,416
Amazing.

424
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:43,500
Let's go. It was nothing.

425
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:57,833
Come on!

426
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,750
Move it!

427
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,333
Hey!

428
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,541
Careful.

429
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:31,708
Uh?

430
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:37,875
Awesome.

431
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:40,083
Is this the road we came from?

432
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,833
That was in the exact opposite direction.

433
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,375
How would you even know that?

434
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,833
Okay, come on.

435
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,333
Let's go.

436
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:00,500
- Can you go on?
- Yeah.

437
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:02,166
I'm okay.

438
00:38:58,791 --> 00:38:59,791
Hey.

439
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:08,333
I can't believe it.

440
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:32,958
Oh.

441
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,833
You have to call the police.
We don't have a signal.

442
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:40,166
What? Police? Why?

443
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,375
Uh, we were hiking.

444
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:51,583
And there was this woman at the lake. And...

445
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,125
Can you just call the police now?

446
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:02,708
There's no signal here either.
We just have a landline.

447
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:19,333
- Fuck.
- Doesn't always work.

448
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,500
Do you know a woman living nearby?

449
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:38,333
Well, hikers often get lost.
Especially during the winter.

450
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:42,333
Mostly older visitors from far away.
They probably underestimate the forest.

451
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:45,166
- Did you not hear the shots?
- Shots?

452
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,083
Yeah, exactly.

453
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:51,166
Ah! Well yeah.

454
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,500
- Hunting accidents occur now and then.
- Quiet.

455
00:40:57,666 --> 00:41:00,291
You guys look really freaking tired.

456
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:04,125
This is my bachelor party.
I'm getting married soon.

457
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:07,958
<i> 911, what's your emergency?</i>

458
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:08,958
Uh, hello.

459
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:12,208
We were shot at and... and actually,
one of us is dead already.

460
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:13,833
We're in the national park.

461
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:15,916
In a hut. What's the location?

462
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:20,291
Get down!

463
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:21,375
Fuck!

464
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:25,958
Shit, shit.

465
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:47,625
<i>I'm sorry, sir,
I couldn't hear you.</i>

466
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,375
<i>Are you still on the phone?</i>

467
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:51,916
Fuck! Shit, man!

468
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:57,125
Where's Vincent?

469
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:58,875
- Huh?
- Where's Vincent?

470
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,958
Vincent. Wait.

471
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:23,375
Hey.

472
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,208
The door.

473
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:29,125
Let's go.

474
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:33,416
Roman, come on. We have to get away.

475
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:37,583
Move!

476
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:39,458
Roman, come on.

477
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:45,958
Leave him. Leave him.

478
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:02,000
I can't see her anymore.

479
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:03,083
Oh, fuck!

480
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:09,791
Be careful.

481
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:14,666
Shit. I can't see her.

482
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:23,333
Yeah.

483
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:34,916
Roman, come on.

484
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:37,625
We have to get out of here.

485
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:39,250
Roman.

486
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:43,916
Roman!

487
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,958
We have to get the fuck out of here.

488
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:57,583
Go!

489
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,750
Maybe you injured her, Roman.

490
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:36,333
You're lucky
she didn't just pop you too.

491
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:48,125
The road.

492
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Let's go!

493
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,208
Shit, shit!

494
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,458
Do you need a break?

495
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,250
No break, dude.

496
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:03,416
Move!

497
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:09,458
Fuck!

498
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:15,291
The cabin was over there.

499
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,583
Come on. Come on.

500
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,958
Hey. Shit!

501
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:18,625
She hasn't seen us.

502
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:20,416
Walk.

503
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,416
Go on.

504
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,500
Go.

505
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,666
Come on, what do you want from us?

506
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,000
- Don't provoke her!
- Maybe she just wants our money.

507
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:56,250
- I have money.
- I don't think she wants that.

508
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:57,791
All right. Run!

509
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,583
Fuck!

510
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:06,375
Why are you doing this, uh?

511
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,875
Why doesn't she just shoot us dead?

512
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:26,291
None of this makes any sense.

513
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:29,958
Who says it has to make sense?

514
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:38,625
Go. Let's go.

515
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:48,541
Fuck.

516
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:50,541
Oh, shit.

517
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:57,458
Fuck.

518
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:41,625
What is this place?

519
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,791
Any reception?

520
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:58,750
No.

521
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:06,791
Shit.

522
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:24,125
Albert, don't.

523
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:28,375
We have to keep moving.

524
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,000
Right now.

525
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,083
Come on!

526
00:52:35,291 --> 00:52:37,916
Stop bossing us around. It's annoying.

527
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:40,708
Okay.

528
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:45,125
Alright, Roman.

529
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:48,208
You decide, then.

530
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:51,625
What if she suddenly comes out
and it's too late to make a run for it?

531
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:54,666
Then what?

532
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,000
Any ideas, boss?

533
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,798
Let's hide your brother
in one of the buildings

534
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:12,958
and come back to get him with the police.

535
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:14,041
All right?

536
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:15,458
Hey.

537
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:18,208
Stop with this bullshit.

538
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:23,291
- You think I don't get what's going on?
- Albert, go sit down.

539
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:25,000
- You can barely stand.
- So what?

540
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:27,750
What next? Huh?

541
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,875
Albert, can you keep running?

542
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:32,958
Hmm?

543
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:35,583
Or can you even help one of us
if we get hurt?

544
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:38,375
No, you can't.

545
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:39,666
You know I'm not wrong.

546
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:42,750
So, at least stop lying to yourself!

547
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:45,708
Albert, leave it!

548
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:47,541
Okay?

549
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,708
You're such a goddamn moron,
you know that?

550
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:52,666
Yeah, sure.
That's why we work together, right?

551
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,750
You started a company with me because
you needed a moron to get your funding!

552
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:59,916
The company wouldn't exist
without me, and neither would you!

553
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,625
Enough, guys, fuck your company!

554
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:09,916
Come on, give me your phone.
I'll look for a signal and get help.

555
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,166
Albert...

556
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,375
Forget it.

557
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:20,625
For Christ's sake!

558
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,875
Fuck you, man!

559
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:31,833
Fucking asshole.

560
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:33,416
Prince Albert!

561
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:36,750
You self-centered, stupid asshole!

562
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:39,375
You always just take whatever you can get.

563
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:42,708
When someone calls you out on it,
you pretend it has nothing to do with you.

564
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:44,833
Well I can do that too.

565
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:48,041
Roman, good luck.

566
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:49,750
Best of luck, really.

567
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:52,666
Don't think that this asshole
will ever give you a job!

568
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,625
- Oh, and ask him about Lisa.
- What?

569
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:57,708
- Wait.
- Don't. Roman.

570
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,625
- Hey!
- Leave him. Leave him, man.

571
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,250
Leave him.

572
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,166
Let him go. He'll calm down.

573
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:07,041
It's all right.

574
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:09,333
It's all right.

575
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:17,125
You think you and I stand a better chance?

576
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:19,416
Yeah, without an asshole,
we stand a better chance.

577
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,000
Without an asshole?
He's the asshole, yeah?

578
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:25,416
And he's not right about anything? Huh?

579
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:29,208
And your injury
is no problem at all, right?

580
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,583
- Now, what's this about Lisa?
- Roman, Roman. Shut up, man.

581
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,083
There's nothing going on.

582
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,458
Listen, don't fall
for his mind games like that.

583
00:55:38,541 --> 00:55:41,333
He just wants to pit us
against each other, it's obvious.

584
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,583
Hey. Hey.

585
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:47,875
You said it yourself.

586
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:49,625
We have to stick together.

587
00:55:51,041 --> 00:55:53,208
You and me. We'll stick together.

588
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:54,833
Huh? We're family.

589
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:57,250
Roman, we're family.

590
00:55:58,583 --> 00:55:59,583
All right?

591
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:01,916
Seriously?

592
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:06,458
Roman. Hey!

593
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,333
Roman!

594
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,916
Safe trip.

595
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
A NEW FUTURE FOR FALCONRY

596
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:30,750
<i>Now that's broken.</i>

597
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,625

598
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:36,000

599
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:38,583

600
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:48,791
<i>Look.</i>

601
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,500
<i>Who's that?</i>

602
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:58,041
<i> Hey! And who are you?</i>

603
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,291
- <i>Mommy, who is that?
- Hey!</i>

604
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:06,166
<i>That's enough now. Just go!</i>

605
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:07,500
<i>- Put the rifle away.
- Hey!</i>

606
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:18,375
<i>Shit!
Forget the fucking camera! Come on!</i>

607

Hello?

617
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:10,750
Did you hear that?

618
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:13,708
Shit!

619
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:16,791
Hey! Dude, this is insane!

620
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:18,291
Roman!

621
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:24,625
It's no big deal. Just walk.

622
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,875
Go on.

623
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:29,333
Just keep walking. Go on.

624
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:49,541
Hey.

625
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,541
I haven't done anything to you. Right?

626
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:54,250
Please.

627
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:55,333
Don't do this.

628
01:02:58,458 --> 01:02:59,458
Please, don't.

629
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:01,250
Please.

630
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:11,541
Please don't. Please.

631
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:15,583
Please, please. I never did...

632
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,291
I never did anything to you...

633
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:18,541
Please!

634
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,125
What do you want?

635
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:42,916
Money?

636
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:45,291
I have money.

637
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:47,375
A lot, okay?

638
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:02,333
- Don't do this.
- I have to help Peter.

639
01:04:02,416 --> 01:04:04,166
Shush! Shush!

640
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,958
Roman! Roman!

641
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:08,916
I... I'm sure we can come to an agreement.

642
01:04:24,041 --> 01:04:26,041
Let's go now.

643
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:27,666
Roman. We gotta go.

644
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:28,750
Now.

645
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,250
I can't go on, Roman.

646
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:30,833
Here, here.

647
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:04,708
Albert?

648
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:06,041
Albert, wake up.

649
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:09,416
Just resting a bit.

650
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,583
For a moment.

651
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:13,416
Okay.

652
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:18,666
Okay.

653
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:27,875
Fuck.

654
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:08,875
Oh, fuck!

655
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:50,541
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU, ALBERT!
SAY HI TO YOUR BROTHER...

656
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:38,166
Hey.

657
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:39,791
Hi.

658
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:42,791
Well? I told you I'd drop by.

659
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:45,375
Yeah, it's really good to see you.

660
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:49,250
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hey.

661
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:54,875
- Are you sure it's no trouble?
- Nah, it's not.

662
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:56,875
- Cool. Come on in.
- Okay.

663
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:18,708
You can tell him to leave.

664
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:21,375
Yes, I can.

665
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,291
Seems like you can't.

666
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:37,916
- I'll get more of this stuff.
- Oh, thank you.

667
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:44,250
- See you in a bit.
- See you.

668
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,500
Hey.

669
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:50,166
- Are you gonna get groceries?
- Yeah.

670
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,666
- Can you pick up a bottle of gin?
- Yeah, you bet.

671
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:56,083
- Dinner in the village tonight?
- If you carry me, yeah.

672
01:09:58,083 --> 01:09:59,083
Gladly.

673
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:02,625
Yeah, yeah.

674
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:24,375
Is it still painful?

675
01:10:26,416 --> 01:10:27,416
Mm-hmm.

676
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:04,041
- What's wrong?
- Stay quiet.

677
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:07,541
Okay.

678
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:15,208
- What's with you?
- Shut your mouth.

679
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:21,333
Okay.

680
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,375
It just happened, you know?

681
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,666
Yeah.

682
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:40,083
- Of course.
- It's the truth.

683
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:43,208
- It was an accident. Do you understand?
- No.

684
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:45,500
I don't understand.

685
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:52,666
What do you want? An apology?

686
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:02,125
Please don't.

687
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,625
You'd have to be sorry for that.

688
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:09,500
So leave me here. Hurry up. Go on.

689
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:51,416
- What are you doing?
- Shut up, asshole.

690
01:14:57,583 --> 01:14:58,958
Here, put pressure on it.

691
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:54,250
I know about Anne.

692
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,708
I've seen it all of it.

693
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:06,000
I'm sorry.

693
01:19:07,305 --> 01:20:07,788
