1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
The best IPTV in the UK
WWW.ALLIN1BOX.CO.UK

2
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,645
The boom slang was stolen
from the zoo last night.

3
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,398
It's extremely dangerous.

4
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,307
Father.

5
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,895
Any news on my grandson?

6
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,857
No change.

7
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,569
He hasn't woken up.

8
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,740
A father's job is to protect his family.

9
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,118
When wataru was on that roof...

10
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,540
When he was pushed...

11
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,211
Where was his father?

12
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,176
Wataru is lucky.

13
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,722
You never know what horrible fate

14
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,433
your bad luck has saved you from.

15
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,151
Thank you for taking the job
on such short notice.

16
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,030
I am ready. You are getting
the new and improved me.

17
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,424
Since I've been working with Barry,

18
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:04,244
I am experiencing a calm
like never before. Never.

19
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,246
Like, I'm less reactive to situations,

20
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,081
I'm more accepting
of people's shortcomings.

21
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,835
I was a little uncertain about coming
back to work, but it's like Barry says:

22
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,588
You put peace out in the world,
you get peace back.

23
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,590
I think your new therapist
might be forgetting

24
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,592
what you do for a living, little ladybug.

25
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,304
- Ladybug?
- Your new operational name.

26
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,973
- Ladybug? Really?
- You don't like it?

27
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,391
- Do you like it?
- I like it.

28
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,976
Well, if you like it, all right.

29
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,231
Oh, I see what you're doing.
Ladybugs are supposed to be lucky.

30
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,614
- You don't have bad luck.
- Really?

31
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:46,578
My bad luck is biblical. I'm not even
trying to kill people and someone dies.

32
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:47,704
That's an exaggeration.

33
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,623
It is? My last job?

34
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,875
- The political blackmail photos?
- I voted for you.

35
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,461
Remember the suicidal bellboy
climbed the roof of his hotel,

36
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,921
couldn't take it anymore?

37
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,970
Seems more like his bad luck
than yours.

38
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,681
Hang in there, buddy!

39
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,307
And he didn't die.

40
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,643
Okay? You drove him to the hospital.
It's good luck.

41
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,562
- All in how you frame it.
- Sure.

42
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,147
Gotta say I like it here.
I could live here.

43
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,860
I like the atmosphere,
the people are considerate...

44
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,698
Except for that guy.

45
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,344
Why is this job paying so well?

46
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,596
It was supposed to be carver's,
but he's got some stomach thing.

47
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,706
- Carver?
- And he doesn't do snatch-and-grabs.

48
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,293
I'm filling in for carver?
You picked me second to carver?

49
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,670
You said you wanted simple
for your first job back.

50
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,963
Doesn't get simpler.

51
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,007
- Shit.
- Shit what?

52
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,485
I think I must have lost the key
when that guy bumped into me.

53
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,845
- What's the number again?
- 523.

54
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,021
Carver.

55
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,564
What an ego.

56
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:59,109
I mean, talk about
a candidate for self-improvement.

57
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,653
Calling in sick?
I mean, what is that, high school?

58
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,572
I can hear that personal growth.

59
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:07,326
I know I'm being judgmental.
I need to work on that.

60
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,703
But, Jesus, what a douche bag.

61
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,289
You have the strangest requests.
Firecrackers?

62
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,457
I'm industrious.

63
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,503
Please tell me
you didn't order the sleeping powder.

64
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,420
Nope.

65
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,773
You almost gave that bodyguard
in Anchorage a heart attack.

66
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,341
I've worked on the dosage.

67
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,050
Take the gun.

68
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,270
Ticket please.

69
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,359
Thank you for using our train.

70
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,944
First class is that way.

71
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,032
- I'm gonna assume you didn't take the gun?
- Barry says every conflict

72
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,826
is an opportunity for a peaceful...
What was it?

73
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,704
And your handler says
some conflicts require a gun.

74
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:53,788
Shit.

75
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,173
Okay, I'm on.

76
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,383
Well, that's a start.

77
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,219
Hey, this is nice.

78
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,302
Economy?

79
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:12,057
I'm thinking of starting my own agency.
You know, all simple jobs, all the time.

80
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,642
That's a terrible business plan.

81
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,563
No more sociopaths, no more maniacs.
Just quality people.

82
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,148
Barry says it's time for some change.
I think he's right.

83
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,359
Barry does not know
what you do for a living.

84
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,945
Okay, here we go.
The bullet train has 16 cars.

85
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,989
Ten economy, six first-class,

86
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,449
and remember,
only one minute stop at every station.

87
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,166
Bloody fuckin' hell. Do you mind?

88
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,879
What is he, fucking blind or something?

89
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,092
Come on. No, you don't
have to Nick the biscuits, man.

90
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,679
Oh, no. You all right? Okay, cool.

91
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,222
- Fucking asshole.
- Thank you.

92
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:54,808
Why'd I do that?

93
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,579
It's like I got a compulsion or something.
I have to take it if I see it.

94
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,563
Need to talk to someone. Serious.

95
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,524
A goldfish biscuit?
I mean, I don't understand it.

96
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,153
Okay, simple snatch-and-grab.
What am I snatching and/or grabbing?

97
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,698
A briefcase. Intel says
there's a train sticker on the handle.

98
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,576
Briefcases have owners.
Owners are not simple.

99
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,329
And the last update says
the owners will be in economy class.

100
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,832
Owners, plural?
Why didn't you tell me to bring that gun?

101
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,293
I did.
You chose spiritual enlightenment.

102
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:23,795
Chiketto, please.

103
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,879
Ticket.

104
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,506
Hold on.

105
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,134
Ah, no, no. Receipt.

106
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,389
Shit, I think I dropped my ticket, too.

107
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,727
That receipt shows
I bought a ticket, though, right?

108
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,980
One stop.

109
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,815
Yep.

110
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,698
I thought they bowed here.

111
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,626
I pushed him. First class, seat b4

112
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,653
Sorry, kid. I'm looking for...

113
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,495
You found her.

114
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,542
- Oh, lemon.
- Tangerine.

115
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,751
You're bleeding, mate.

116
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,296
Oh, mate, shit. Oh, shit, man.

117
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,380
Who the fuck did I kill?

118
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,483
- Get a wet one on it or something.
- It's not mine, mate.

119
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,193
- Oh, it's not yours?
- Yeah. I don't bleed.

120
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,821
In that case, leave your jacket open,
let everyone have a good old look.

121
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,323
- Yeah, I want everyone to see my tie.
- Fuck is wrong with you?

122
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,467
Pull your coat together
so no one else notices, lemon.

123
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,727
I think they'll notice
the childish code names first.

124
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,521
But if we're gonna stick with fruit,
why not apple or orange?

125
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:06,607
So, what's in this case?

126
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,066
Are we doing this?

127
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,860
You know what's in the case.

128
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,695
Money. It's always money.

129
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,530
Tangerines are sophisticated.

130
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,175
Now he's callin' a fruit sophisticated.

131
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,926
Yeah, it's cross-hybridized
with other fruit.

132
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,536
They're adaptable. Like me.

133
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,623
You said six cars in economy,

134
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,542
say 30 passengers per car,

135
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:29,505
guessing two bags per,
let's see, times two and you carry...

136
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,216
Yeah, no fuckin' way
I'm gonna find one brie...

137
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,176
- Wait.
- What?

138
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,737
- Train sticker on the handle?
- Yeah.

139
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,179
Holy shitbox.

140
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,601
- And why am I lemon?
- Because you're sour.

141
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,524
- No one likes lemons.
- That's bollocks, mate.

142
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,603
Lemonades, lemon drops.

143
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,290
- You got a sore throat?
- Lemon meringue pie.

144
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,525
When's the last time
you ate lemon meringue pie?

145
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,128
- Lemon drizzle cake.
- I'm sorry, are you talking about lemons?

146
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,696
- I have the case.
- Well, that's great.

147
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,114
- Is it?
- Yes.

148
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,991
- What's the catch?
- There is a no catch.

149
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,410
- There's always a catch.
- Get off the train.

150
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,164
Quite like lemons. I just hate code names.

151
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,460
Oh, well, look at this. Sleeping beauty.

152
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,713
- Wakey, wakey.
- Eggs and bakey.

153
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:14,966
Where am I?

154
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,268
You're safe now. Your father sent us.

155
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,270
You idiots work for my father?

156
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,356
Ooh, easy, we could deliver you
back to your pops in a box.

157
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,401
Technically, we're outside contractors.

158
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,195
I'm tangerine. He's lemon.

159
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,197
Like the fruit?

160
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,911
- You ever watch Thomas the tank engine?
- Here we go.

161
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,956
Hey, you watch something nowadays,
what is it, huh? Nothing.

162
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,041
It's twists, violence, drama, no message.

163
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,294
What's the point? Huh?

164
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,129
What are we supposed to learn?

165
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,424
Everything I learned about people
I learned from Thomas.

166
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,361
- You bring your sticker book, did ya?
- You know I always bring my stickers.

167
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:02,222
Take tangerine here.
He's a Gordon. This blue one.

168
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,516
And Gordon is the strongest,
the most important.

169
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,518
But he doesn't always listen to others.

170
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,520
What's that, now?

171
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,939
I mean, some people are Edwards.
Wise, kind.

172
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,942
Some are Henrys.
Hard-working, strong.

173
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,320
Some people are diesels.

174
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,529
Fuck me!

175
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:20,991
Those are trouble.

176
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,367
You, though...

177
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,788
Yeah, you seem like a Percy.

178
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,248
Young.

179
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,083
Sweet.

180
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,335
Not all there.

181
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,171
You finished, both of you?

182
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,091
- Yeah.
- Right. Your daddy

183
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,778
hired us to get you out of the trouble
you got yourself into, naughty boy.

184
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,430
- Why are you tangerine, though?
- Oh, it's sophisticated, mate.

185
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:46,058
Oh, fuckin' hell.
It's not important, is it?

186
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,560
What is important
are the 17 dead bodies we left

187
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,330
getting you back from the triad
that kidnapped you

188
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,540
with the plans to ransom you to your
extremely psychotic fucked-up father.

189
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,815
Actually, it's 16.

190
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,109
What's that, now?

191
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,111
- Sixteen kills, mate.
- No, it was 17.

192
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,988
- It's 16.
- Seven.

193
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,466
You're startin' to get on my fucking tits.

194
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,009
- Sixteen.
- I'll smash my fucking head

195
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,761
- through a brick wall.
- Maybe that'd help your memory

196
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:05,994
'cause it was 16.

197
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,139
It was 17, goddamn it.
I wanna fucking strangle you now.

198
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,603
Do you mind if we do this right now?

199
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,045
One.

200
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,759
Two, three.

201
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,976
Five guys playing poker.

202
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,032
Keep moving!

203
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,534
- Big guy.
- Yeah, big guy.

204
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,161
Sometime today!

205
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,205
Ten.

206
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,211
Three assholes with swords.

207
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,505
Fucking get it. Fuck!

208
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:01,943
Why do you always bring swords?

209
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,635
Fucking triad. You would, wouldn't ya?

210
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:06,805
You son of a bitch!

211
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:10,934
I like swords, actually.

212
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,914
Looks like it's time for a Jaffa cake.

213
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,148
How about a wagon wheel?

214
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,231
Oh, that works.

215
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,276
Swing!

216
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,699
Fourteen, fifteen.

217
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,870
And the prick on the motorcycle.

218
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:38,921
- So 16.
- You forgot the poor,

219
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,131
- innocent civilian on the street.
- The fuck you...?

220
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:44,343
Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy, you okay? Oh, my...

221
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,347
Shit. That wasn't our fault.

222
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,765
- Wasn't our fault?
- No.

223
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,743
Well, what would
Thomas the tank engine say, lemon?

224
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,185
That's really mean.

225
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,187
He'd say,
"hey, take responsibility, mate."

226
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,688
He doesn't sound like that.

227
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,275
Gonna put a little distance
between me and the owners.

228
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,069
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah, I'm nervous.

229
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,272
- You sound nervous.
- Because I am, in fact, nervous.

230
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,074
Hey, listen,
I'm just gonna get off at the next stop.

231
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,785
Oh, let's have a seat, then, huh?

232
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,346
Do you know
what they call your papushka?

233
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,538
Course I fucking do.

234
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,790
The white death. Not exactly a fruit.

235
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,124
No. There you go.

236
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,852
There's a story...
Stop me if you've heard it.

237
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,503
Where this woman found herself

238
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,339
in the unfortunate position
of owing your father a tidy sum of money.

239
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,051
Now, the issue was it took her
some time to acquire this money.

240
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,304
But she did pay it back
five minutes late, didn't she?

241
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,306
- Yeah, what'd he do?
- Cut her arm off.

242
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,516
- Fuckin' hell!
- Yeah.

243
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,439
He said she owed him a finger
for every minute.

244
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,540
He's not a monster. He didn't
make her sit through it five times.

245
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,107
He just cut once, didn't he?

246
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:45,612
- This is too easy.
- You're over thinking it.

247
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,456
- You're under thinking it.
- It's not a word.

248
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,365
- Yes, it is.
- Really?

249
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,241
I think it is.

250
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,844
- Did you Google it?
- Doesn't matter.

251
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:51,743
What would Barry say?

252
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,621
Barry would say, "a negative outlook
leads to a negative outcome."

253
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,748
Wow. How much do you pay him again?

254
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,793
Our job is to keep you safe

255
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,462
and to recover the briefcase
with the ransom money inside.

256
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,507
And I plan on completin' my job
and keeping...

257
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:08,302
Lemon. Where's the briefcase?

258
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,928
Oh, I stashed it.

259
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,806
The case, lemon.

260
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,808
Go get me the fucking case.

261
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:18,312
You're a liability, you know?
To my father.

262
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,234
He doesn't need a reason
to kill people like you.

263
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,861
He needs a reason not to.

264
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,072
Does he have one?

265
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,869
That's fucking confusin'.

266
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,080
- Hello?
- Do you have white death's son?

267
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,058
You mean this dickhead
with the silly face tattoos?

268
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,685
- He's sat right here.
- And the briefcase?

269
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,628
Yes, of course, I've got the case.

270
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,672
You will both deboard at Kyoto station.

271
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:48,258
Then your business with him
will be concluded.

272
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,729
It was just here.

273
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:02,814
Well, it's not anymore.

274
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,859
We need to find
the person who took that case.

275
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,737
Maybe you're right.

276
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,823
Maybe my luck is starting to turn.

277
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,893
You.

278
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,270
Yes.

279
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,313
Me.

280
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,942
But you are yuichi kimura.

281
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,571
And you came here to kill me.

282
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:54,074
My parents call me malen'kiy prints.

283
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,786
That means little prince.
Obviously, they wanted a boy.

284
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,670
You're going to want
to hear the whole story.

285
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,215
Or you'll be very, very sorry.

286
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:15,971
It's the hospital.

287
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,472
Hang on.

288
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:20,475
Hi. Yes, you can see the boy now.

289
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:25,272
Good. If you don't hear from me
every ten minutes

290
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,316
or if I don't answer this phone
when you call,

291
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,612
I want you to go in there and kill...

292
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,117
I'm sorry, what's your boy's name again?

293
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,535
Wataru.

294
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,787
Right. Right.

295
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,164
Kill wataru.

296
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,710
Aren't we glad we waited?

297
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,378
We got his son. That was our job.

298
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:52,424
Our job was to come back
with his son and his $10 million.

299
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:54,268
Three words describe
our situation right now.

300
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,429
- Do you know what they are?
- Sure do. Saved... his... son.

301
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,782
Family's more important
than money, right?

302
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,434
Do you honestly not know
who the white death is?

303
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,895
I know the white death.
You just told me 5 minutes ago.

304
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,105
Why do I even bother
forwarding you the briefings?

305
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,149
I do not know.

306
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,991
The Japanese underworld
used to be ruled by a man named minegishi.

307
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:23,038
Now, minegishi was one brutal bastard.

308
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:24,998
But he was old-school, you know?

309
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,125
Tradition and loyalty
was all that mattered to him.

310
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,813
When you were in, you were in.
You were like family.

311
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,797
He treated you
like you were one of his own.

312
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,551
Then out of the blue comes this
6-foot-fucking-6 geezer from Russia.

313
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:40,514
Whispers that he was exiled from the
Russian mafia or that he was ex-kgb.

314
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,100
No one really knows the truth.

315
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,229
But what is known is this Russian

316
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,524
worked his way up the ranks.

317
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,484
Bit by bit. Kill by kill.

318
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,740
And very, very fucking quickly became
one of minegishi's closest advisors.

319
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,076
And those loyal to him said:

320
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,204
"Hold your horses.
This geezer ain't the full ticket.

321
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:05,956
He ain't to be trusted."

322
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,292
"He's dangerous," they said.

323
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,460
"A modern plague," they said.

324
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,629
"A white death."

325
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,465
So, sure enough, they were right.

326
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,510
He made his own alliance.

327
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,180
His own gang.

328
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,730
And what'd he do?

329
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,356
Stabbed him in the back.

330
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,484
I mean, metaphorically.
He blew his fucking brains out, didn't he?

331
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,750
He wiped the name minegishi off
the face of the earth in one single night.

332
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,794
And made an empire
worthy of the white death.

333
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,677
So, let me put this bluntly.

334
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,596
There's this soulless psychotic leader

335
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,474
with the largest criminal organization
on the planet

336
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:08,769
shoved right inside
our fucking ass cheeks.

337
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,875
That motherfucker's
definitely a diesel, then, isn't he?

338
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,151
If you mention Thomas the tank engine
one more time

339
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:19,488
- I'm gonna shoot you in the fucking face.
- Okay, if he's such a badass,

340
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,300
how come he hired two random operators
instead of getting his son back himself?

341
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,552
If you actually read the briefings
you'd know that he had a wife.

342
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,661
What, he had a wife?

343
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,497
She was the most important
fucking thing in his life, and she died.

344
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,020
Drunk driving accident or some shit.

345
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,253
And now he's at the compound.
He ain't left since.

346
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,606
An unnamed locomotive
might say there's a lesson to be learned.

347
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,132
And he didn't hire
two random operators, lemon.

348
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:40,300
No, he asked for the best.

349
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,678
He asked for the two responsible
for the Bolivia job.

350
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,645
He asked for pros who wouldn't fuck up.

351
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,397
Three words, lemon.

352
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,815
- We are...
- Fucked.

353
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,904
What do you want?

354
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,490
People think
that I'm just some young girl.

355
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,911
Someone's future wife...

356
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,163
Or future mother.

357
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,543
But I'm not in someone else's story.

358
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,046
You're all in mine.

359
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,216
The fuck does that have to do with me?

360
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,970
You work for the most feared boss
in the city: The white death.

361
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,223
Oh, deny it all you want.

362
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:31,727
But you work for someone who works
for someone else, et cetera, et cetera,

363
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:34,396
and it all falls under the same person.

364
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,982
You delivered a briefcase two days ago

365
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,610
to one of the white death's associates,

366
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,236
and I saw my opportunity.

367
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,990
Follow the case and find the white death.

368
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,284
I don't know
what you think I can do for you.

369
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,995
Oh, that is my favorite part of the story.

370
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:52,039
You're going to kill him for me.

371
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:57,419
How the fuck
am I going to kill the white death?

372
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,213
You'll see.

373
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,633
Oh, look at that.

374
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,510
We are right on schedule.

375
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,847
Sit back, relax a little bit.
You look so tense.

376
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,446
We rescued his fucking son.

377
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:27,991
We find the fucker who took the briefcase,
make things right,

378
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,826
be like it never happened.

379
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,478
You still got that vest on ya?

380
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,921
No, vests give you
a false sense of security.

381
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,607
You might, like, get shot in the neck.

382
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:44,716
It also stops you
from getting shot in the chest,

383
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:46,718
but I guess you missed
that episode of Thomas.

384
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:50,389
I really must've,
because that sounds dark as shit.

385
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,641
Nut up or shut up, bruv.

386
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,449
Well, so, slight change of plans.

387
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,502
First his wife, now his son?

388
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,880
That's a lot of white deaths.

389
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:35,142
I want you to be strong, son.
Do you understand?

390
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,436
Be strong.

391
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:36,554
My heart.

392
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,302
No!

393
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,855
Find me the son of a bitch who did this.

394
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:28,292
You lucky son of a bitch.

395
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,626
You stabbed me?!

396
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,590
- You ruined my life.
- I don't even know you!

397
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,513
I come here for revenge.

398
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:45,517
The assassin who killed El saguaro
killed my wife.

399
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:49,313
But fate made this a two for one special.

400
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:02,117
Can we just take a time-out here?
Talk this out?

401
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:03,827
I will never stop coming for you.

402
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,078
What?

403
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:07,706
Run as far as you like.
I will find you.

404
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:08,665
Why?

405
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:12,002
And I will ruin your life
the way you ruined mine!

406
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,670
Dude, I don't even know you!

407
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,362
My heart.

408
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:47,578
What the...?

409
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:50,207
Wow. Really?

410
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:56,588
Let this be a lesson
in the toxicity of anger.

411
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:03,011
Venezuela, Uruguay, Barcelona.

412
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,434
Who are you?

413
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:39,006
All passengers:
We'll make a brief stop

414
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,216
- at shin Yokohama.
- All right, mate, try these.

415
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,677
- They're them momonga glasses.
- The fuck is a momonga?

416
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:50,058
Comes on after Thomas every Thursday.

417
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:53,854
- Okay.
- It's good.

418
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:56,857
- Just like that.
- He should look asleep. There, like that.

419
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,742
Wasabi.

420
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:10,263
We gotta make sure
he doesn't step a foot off this train.

421
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:12,706
You see the case,
deal with whoever has it.

422
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,126
All right, how do I do that?
Talk to him, or, like, talk to him?

423
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,588
Why don't you tell him about the
story about how Gordon met Percy

424
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:22,299
and how Percy's now bleeding
from his fucking eye sockets!

425
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:26,178
He means kill him.

426
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:27,596
All passengers:

427
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:31,475
- We'll make a brief stop at shin Yokohama.
- Goddamn it.

428
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:42,819
Excuse me.

429
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:45,364
You are fuckin' excused.

430
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:08,553
Joburg.

431
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,524
I'm sorry, buddy.

432
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:23,025
Give it!

433
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,576
Shit balls!

434
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,244
That wasn't a minute.

435
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,676
- I missed my stop.
- Why?

436
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,012
- Because god hates me.
- No, she doesn't.

437
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,948
- Do you still have the case?
- Yeah, I stashed it.

438
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:54,892
- Get off at the next stop.
- It sounds so easy when you say it.

439
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:00,939
Does the name El cigarillo
mean anything to you?

440
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,569
- El saguaro? The cartel boss?
- Yeah, why does that sound so familiar?

441
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,532
He was in the wedding
you infiltrated in Mexico.

442
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:11,033
- Tequila?
- You were the cocktail server.

443
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:16,538
The groom.
I knew I recognized that guy.

444
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,749
- I'm really good with faces.
- Wait, what guy?

445
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,210
Sorry. Be right back.

446
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,688
The guy who stabbed me.
I spilled wine on his suit. He's dead now.

447
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,089
- You killed the wolf?
- It was an accident.

448
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:29,551
I'm really gonna have to process
my part in the incident on Monday.

449
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:31,720
Shit! Fuck! No.

450
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:34,181
Shit. Fuck. What?

451
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,642
Remember those two wackos
from the Bolivia job?

452
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:39,269
- The twins?
- Yeah, I'm not so sure they're twins.

453
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:41,146
Stop it. Everyone knows they're twins.

454
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,273
One of them is walking
towards me right now.

455
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:45,752
I think I saw the other
one on the platform.

456
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:46,610
Occupied.

457
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,373
Now we know
who the owners of the case are.

458
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:49,923
This is exactly what I'm talkin' about.

459
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:51,883
We have to have a hard discussion
about the caliber of people

460
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:54,307
- we are surrounding ourselves with.
- Why are we whispering?

461
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:01,810
- Hello.
- The white death would like to know

462
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,961
- why you stepped off train.
- Wanted some fresh air.

463
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,755
Your orders were to stay on the train.

464
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,925
I didn't realize I was gettin'
a babysitter to come cut my bollocks.

465
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:13,679
I'm a professional. We're making sure
the case and his son are perfectly safe.

466
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:16,306
Can I please go do my job now?

467
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,600
Oh, very kind of you.
Thank you very much.

468
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:26,984
Fuck me! Jesus Christ.

469
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:30,028
It's very rude, talking on the phone,
on the train in Japan.

470
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:32,197
This rude enough for ya,
ya fucking prick?

471
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:35,242
Shove that fuckin' hat
up your fuckin' asshole, you hear me?

472
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:39,955
Fuck this job.

473
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:42,124
I knew we should have got an upgrade,
fuck all.

474
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:43,709
I beg your pardon, sorry.

475
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,741
I wasn't aware
there was a young lady present. Apologize.

476
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,760
You didn't happen to see someone come by
with a silver briefcase, did ya?

477
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:52,634
There's a little train sticker
by the handle.

478
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:55,596
Actually, yeah.

479
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,932
A man with black framed glasses had it.
He went that way.

480
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:03,978
Thank you, love.

481
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,566
That fucking bastard.

482
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:11,653
Come on.

483
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:18,535
"Guy in black glasses. Stop him."

484
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:22,706
Hi. There's a gun under this table...

485
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:27,461
This is the quiet car. Gotta use
your small inside voice in here, son.

486
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:33,550
There's a gun underneath this table
pointed right at you, so I would...

487
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:35,994
- I can't really hear what you're saying.
- There's a gun...

488
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:39,806
I'm just fuckin' with you, mate.

489
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:43,185
It's been a long time
since Johannesburg.

490
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,480
Yeah. Who the fuck are you?

491
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:49,149
Really. You don't remember me?

492
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:53,563
You look like every white homeless man
I've ever seen.

493
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:55,238
Okay.

494
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:58,659
Well, I have something
I believe you're looking f...

495
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,328
- Really? You don't remember me?
- I remember Johannesburg,

496
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:03,163
- but I don't remember you.
- You shot me.

497
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,684
- I shoot a lot of people.
- You shot me twice.

498
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,544
Ow!

499
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,505
Well, you also have a shoot able face.

500
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:13,691
I know you're black framed glasses.

501
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:16,176
The cheeky fucker
who took our briefcase.

502
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:19,429
Yes. Yes, I am.

503
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:23,934
You know, I've done a lot
of personal work since joburg.

504
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:25,811
I've forgiven, I've moved on.

505
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:28,730
I've learned that
with any potential conflict

506
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:31,984
there's an opportunity for growth,
a path to a peaceful outcome.

507
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:35,153
Interesting.

508
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:36,237
Who is that?

509
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,198
I have no idea.

510
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,543
How did you know that was there?

511
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,671
Didn't I mention?

512
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,673
I've always been lucky.

513
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:01,597
It was then that I took
a long, hard look into the mirror.

514
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:03,139
And you know what?

515
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,184
Buddy, I didn't like what I saw.

516
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:07,436
Nope. Nada.

517
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,815
Until I did. You know?

518
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:18,071
Between us now sits a wall.

519
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:21,116
But it's an illusion.

520
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:25,746
For within every wall, awaits a window...

521
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,040
Oh, wait, it's a door.

522
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:31,168
Real quick, every day
is a fucking headache with you, innit?

523
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:35,088
Right. You and your partner...

524
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:36,465
I'm lemon, he's tangerine.

525
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,425
Okay, lemon... like the fruit?

526
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:40,093
Blessings.

527
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,430
- What's your plan here?
- Here's the plan.

528
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:45,849
I give you back your case,
you don't kill me.

529
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,685
You give your case to your employer,
he doesn't kill you.

530
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:51,813
You're alive, I'm alive,
everyone's happy.

531
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:52,981
Win-win, don't you think?

532
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:56,735
How do you know whoever hired you
won't kill you for failing your job?

533
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:58,487
Lose-lose. No happy.

534
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,048
Man, I just wanna get off this train,

535
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:02,574
go see a zen garden
and some shit, you know?

536
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,703
- I'd like to accept your offer.
- Great.

537
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:09,039
But then you went and killed someone.
Didn't you?

538
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:18,382
- How did you know...?
- Wasn't exactly subtle.

539
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:20,759
It was an accident. Tragic.

540
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:21,885
Bizarre, even.

541
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,846
Cool story, bro,

542
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:26,407
but I think you had your own plans
of getting out of here with that case.

543
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:28,475
- No, no.
- Pinning a body on us.

544
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:29,476
Hoping the white death

545
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,996
is so busy cuttin' off our arms
instead of cuttin' off our fingers.

546
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,440
It's like Thomas the tank engine
always says: "Simple is better."

547
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:37,364
- The kids' show?
- Yes, the fucking ki... man.

548
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:39,671
I learned everything
about people from Thomas.

549
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:40,904
- Everything.
- Really?

550
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,031
It's how I can read people like you
so well.

551
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:45,617
- And you are a diesel.
- I am not a diesel.

552
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:47,911
- You're the diesel-est diesel...
- Not even close.

553
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:49,705
I've ever seen in my life, man.

554
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,874
'Cause diesels bluff. They go too far.

555
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,977
I'm trying to get diesels
out of my life, you know?

556
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:57,921
If there was a gun under this table, yeah,
I'd be as dead as that kid over there.

557
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:26,449
Nope.

558
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:33,165
You mother...

559
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:39,963
Have the courage to listen.

560
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:58,315
Come on, joburg.

561
00:39:58,941 --> 00:39:59,941
No.

562
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,777
Shot number three.

563
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,293
No, no, no. I ain't got the time
or the Patience, let alone the interest.

564
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,128
Fucking hell.

565
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:23,257
Are you following me? Stop!

566
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,340
And $♪% ♪

567
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,426
Asshole!

568
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:52,411
I'll call the conductor!

569
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:54,413
Eat a bag of dicks, lady!

570
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:56,707
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm working on it.

571
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:28,113
I'm not a diesel, you're a diesel.

572
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:57,935
- There's another body here.
- Of course there is.

573
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,479
Not my fault, and I believe
it's the son of the white death.

574
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:01,563
Did the twins ID you?

575
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:03,690
Did you hear what I said?
White death. Death. Death.

576
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:06,443
Snatch-and-grab, my ass.

577
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:08,862
There's someone else
doing a job on this train.

578
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:10,322
The twins. We know that.

579
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:11,907
Again, not twins.

580
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,867
Loonies, but not twins.

581
00:42:14,826 --> 00:42:18,622
They're here for the kid,
but somebody killed the kid.

582
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:24,503
- The guy with the knife.
- The wolf.

583
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:28,507
He said he came here for revenge.

584
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,510
He just happened to run into me,
because of course he did.

585
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:34,137
Now, get this.

586
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:38,433
The kid was poisoned in the same way
as El sbarro was at the wedding.

587
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:40,060
It's El saguaro.

588
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,562
- The same killer?
- Yeah.

589
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:45,274
I'm like MacGyver.

590
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:49,318
Fuck!

591
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:59,913
All of Japan is in terror
because a poisonous snake was stolen.

592
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:04,376
Boom slang snakes
have a very strong poison.

593
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:07,045
When they bite,
it can cause internal bleeding...

594
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:09,464
And bleeding from holes in the body.

595
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,799
Oh, shit.

596
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:12,092
What are you doing?

597
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:15,053
What's wrong?

598
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:16,263
Fuck this, man.

599
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:18,348
Fuck carver.

600
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:22,352
Shit.

601
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:25,731
Oh, thank god. For a minute there...

602
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:27,983
Jesus Christ,
you had a bit of a bosh, pal.

603
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:32,404
All right. Five stations to Kyoto.

604
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:34,364
Better get tickety-boo.

605
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:40,954
Would you describe me
as someone who lives in perpetual anxiety?

606
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:42,080
No, no.

607
00:43:42,164 --> 00:43:43,165
Ah, fuck nuts.

608
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:44,917
And if it wasn't clear, I meant "yes."

609
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:48,146
- The conductor, I don't have a ticket.
- Not sure that's your biggest concern.

610
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,273
You don't understand,
this guy's like criss-fuckin'-angel.

611
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:51,757
He pops up everywhere.

612
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,843
He slows me down,
tangerine catches me, I am dead.

613
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:57,012
Dead. Dead.

614
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,014
Hold on.

615
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:05,854
Hey, bro.

616
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:09,433
Wanna make an easy 200 bucks?

617
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:16,156
Is this like a... sex thing?

618
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:21,327
Nope.

619
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:23,372
Oh, okay. I was kidding.

620
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:25,123
Yeah, what's up?
What do you need, bro?

621
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:08,125
All right, game's up, big boy.

622
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,210
Where is the case?

623
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:13,213
Tell me, and I promise
I'll only shoot you enough...

624
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:16,550
Whoa, whoa, is this the sex stuff?

625
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:21,138
Twat!

626
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:24,558
- Shit.
- I do love an accent.

627
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:32,774
Come on.

628
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:41,200
Oops.

629
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,995
Picture it.

630
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:46,997
Picture what?

631
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,249
Well, the man. Watching your son.

632
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:51,502
I wonder how he'll do it.

633
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:56,215
Maybe a pillow to the face.

634
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,467
Or maybe something clever.

635
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:01,178
Like an air bubble in the iv.

636
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:06,058
No, no. You hold onto it.

637
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:08,977
The innocent young girl act
doesn't really get you very far

638
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:10,646
if you're holding a loaded gun.

639
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:18,153
Put it on speaker.

640
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:21,740
- Father.
- Yuichi?

641
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:24,993
Why did you leave the hospital?

642
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:28,038
Be honest.

643
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:30,666
Who's there with you?

644
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:36,588
I found out who pushed wataru
off that roof.

645
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:39,174
Did you go to the authorities?

646
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:41,927
I wanted to handle it myself.

647
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:47,015
My son.

648
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:50,269
You can't control
what fate has in store for us.

649
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:51,894
Father.

650
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:54,064
I'm sorry.

651
00:46:57,025 --> 00:46:58,235
We're not finished.

652
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,989
You're going to sit here and you're going
to go through every combination

653
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:03,657
until you open up that case.

654
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,869
- Kid, that could take f...
- No, no. It won't.

655
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:09,913
I'd start with the low numbers.
Just a thought.

656
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:27,181
Fuck me!

657
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:30,642
- There he is.
- He got by me.

658
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:32,394
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

659
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:35,606
I guess our best option now

660
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:38,317
is bring the white death
the man who killed his son.

661
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,461
- But glasses didn't do it.
- I could give a rat's ass.

662
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:42,422
No, I'm telling you, I read him.
He's not the type, mate.

663
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:44,156
I'll tell you what, do you like your arms?

664
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:45,425
- You know I like my arms.
- Well, then

665
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:47,451
someone's got to take the blame,
don't they?

666
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,205
- That's you or me?
- You or me?

667
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:55,125
Shit, that asshole stole my phone.

668
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,293
And my gun, Lucille.

669
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:58,587
- Oh, come on.
- That's my favorite gun. Son of a bitch.

670
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,671
Fuck about.

671
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:03,008
- Right, what?
- Step off the train at the next stop

672
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:05,528
- with the briefcase and the son.
- Hang on a minute, didn't we say Kyoto?

673
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:06,970
You will still depart at Kyoto.

674
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:09,741
The white death wants to make sure
you are being honest about situation.

675
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:11,517
Well, this is a complete waste of our t...

676
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:15,812
All right, all right. We just have
to prove we have a case we don't have

677
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:18,065
and a live son instead of a dead one.

678
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:20,817
What are you thinking?

679
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:24,611
- The ol' punch and Judy?
- The ol' punch and Judy.

680
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:09,157
You were all told to exit the train.

681
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:11,994
Yeah? Well, unlike you,
I'm a professional.

682
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:14,746
I wanted to make sure it weren't
some yakuza trap, but clearly not.

683
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:16,707
It's some fuck in"80s dance-off, innit?

684
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,169
Where is your twin? Tangerine?

685
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:21,253
I'm tangerine.

686
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:23,589
Lemon's keepin' the case safe.

687
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:24,840
And the white death's son?

688
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:27,301
Yeah, he's there.

689
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:31,680
Wave to your fuckin' fans, Princess.

690
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:35,434
He's a fuckin' happy chappy, isn't he?

691
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:38,937
But I've gotta pop on the train,
you know, ten seconds left, so ta-ra.

692
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:42,566
We'll stick to the plan,
depart in Kyoto.

693
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:46,111
Do us a favor:
Get the fuck off my back, will ya?

694
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:56,495
Okay.

695
00:49:58,457 --> 00:49:59,374
Okay.

696
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:00,626
Whoa!

697
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:04,963
Okay.

698
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:07,965
Okay.

699
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:12,554
- That couldn't have gone better.
- Yeah, let's hope they buy it.

700
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:15,724
We need to find that glasses twat,
like, right to the fuck now.

701
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:20,312
I'm gonna go up, you go down,
double back when you're done.

702
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:22,147
If you see him,
fucking deal with him, yeah?

703
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:23,524
Yeah.

704
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:28,070
- Up is...?
- That way. Towards Tokyo.

705
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:29,947
Departing trains
are always moving down.

706
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,198
And, look, be careful.

707
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:33,909
- Something else is going on here.
- Yeah.

708
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:36,328
Yeah, I still feel like
there's a diesel lurking about.

709
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:40,207
I swear to god, what did I say?
What did I say?

710
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,793
- I said I'll fucking...
- Shoot me in the face. Yeah.

711
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:45,462
Thomas still taught me how
to see people, read them for real.

712
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:46,755
Yeah.

713
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:48,757
- And I'm never wrong, am I?
- No.

714
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:50,884
Glasses, he is not our guy.

715
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:53,220
Okay.

716
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:59,685
You shoot first
and come up with the answers later.

717
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:05,231
I always do.

718
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:09,236
And, lemon?

719
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:10,904
Yeah, man?

720
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:13,657
You be careful, too.

721
00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:20,497
I mean, when this train's a-rockin'
don't come a-knockin', right?

722
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:11,173
Seven more minutes
and I am off this train.

723
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:12,508
Are you hiding in the bathroom?

724
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:15,511
Yeah. Have you tried
these smart toilets?

725
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:18,096
They're a pleasure to the senses.

726
00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:21,892
If I had one in the chamber
I would rock this bad boy right now.

727
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:24,019
Boundaries. We need boundaries.

728
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:32,694
Holy shit.

729
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:38,242
Holy shit.

730
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:47,209
Whoa there.

731
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:50,420
Oh, look at that.

732
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:52,840
I knew my luck would rub off on you.

733
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:55,884
Fuck.

734
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:08,397
What the fuck are you doing?

735
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,234
I am doing the same thing
that I did to the gun in your hand.

736
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:18,866
I'm just making things interesting.

737
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:20,701
I'm hedging my bets, you could say.

738
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:21,952
Fuck.

739
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:24,621
If the gun doesn't kill him,
the case will.

740
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:27,165
This thing could have
blown up in my hand at any point.

741
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:31,044
No, no. It's inert unless you fire it.

742
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:33,630
But don't fire it,
you know what I mean?

743
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:38,343
Unlike what I put in this briefcase here.
This is very...

744
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:42,764
Well, this is not inert at all.
This is...

745
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:50,230
Did you know that there have been
31 attempts on the white death's life

746
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:52,232
from within his own organization?

747
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,278
Each one,
he executed with their own weapon.

748
00:53:57,738 --> 00:53:59,239
Do you see what I'm getting at here?

749
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:02,868
Kimura, I brought you here to fail.

750
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:05,954
You push my son off a roof...

751
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:08,081
- Right.
- Bring me to this train...

752
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:10,709
Frame me as an assassin

753
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:14,338
here to kill the white death,
and use my gun...

754
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:17,508
That will blow up in his face?

755
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:19,051
Very good.

756
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:21,512
Very, very good.

757
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:23,430
It's a stupid plan.

758
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:25,432
It is...

759
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:28,227
A brilliant plan.

760
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:37,069
Occupied.

761
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:41,281
You remember that mob surgeon
that died mid-heart operation?

762
00:54:42,032 --> 00:54:44,910
- Yeah, he had a stroke, right?
- No, that was the official cover.

763
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:47,704
He was poisoned. The assassin
goes by the name of the hornet.

764
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:50,249
Oh, my god!

765
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:54,795
He used boom slang snake venom.

766
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:58,131
It congeals the blood,
making you bleed out of every orifice.

767
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:01,260
If the antidote isn't administered
within 30 seconds, you're dead.

768
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:04,721
Fun fact:
The same poison that was used on...

769
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:05,847
El sagardo.

770
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,517
It's El saguaro.

771
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,769
What is the hornet doing on this train?

772
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:14,439
Well, whatever deal was made, it wasn't
done through the normal channels.

773
00:55:14,523 --> 00:55:16,024
There's something else going on here.

774
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:18,944
- How long are you going to be?
- It's still occupied, lady.

775
00:55:21,196 --> 00:55:22,406
And $♪% ♪

776
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,449
The wolf must have
figured out who the hornet is,

777
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:28,161
came here for revenge for his wife,
his boss, came here to whack the hornet.

778
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:29,872
Oh, my god, did you just say "whack"?

779
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:32,559
- I did, I'm bringing it back.
- No, it needs to stay where it was.

780
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,102
If I can figure out who the hornet is,

781
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:36,920
I can give him to lemon and tangerine
so they don't whack me.

782
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:39,131
- Really?
- You see what I did there?

783
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:40,976
You're really proud of yourself,
aren't you?

784
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:44,303
Jeez, they're usually so polite here.

785
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:46,346
Lady, I'm so...

786
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:50,350
Oh. That's cool.

787
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:54,313
Bastard!

788
00:55:57,107 --> 00:56:00,235
Come here, you dirty fucking scum!

789
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:26,720
Wait, wait, wait.
I know who killed the kid.

790
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:29,515
I couldn't give a rat's ass.
Where's my fucking case?

791
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:43,528
Yeah.

792
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:55,582
Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

793
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:06,134
Oh, no, thank you. We're okay.

794
00:57:06,218 --> 00:57:09,054
Oh, I would love a bottle of water.

795
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:15,936
You know what? Do you have
anything sparkling? With bubbles?

796
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:21,817
That's the one. Thank...

797
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,570
Yeah.

798
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:25,653
Oh, yeah.

799
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:31,243
Bro, I just remembered I gave all my money
to that guy to wear my hat and glasses.

800
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:32,619
Could you?

801
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:41,336
How much for the bottle of water, love?

802
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,718
Oh, there. No, you're welcome. Yeah.

803
00:57:48,427 --> 00:57:51,138
A thousand yen. That's ten quid
for that bottle of water, mate.

804
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:55,224
Ta-ra.

805
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:06,111
- You sure you don't wanna talk this out?
- Not particularly, no.

806
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:07,321
Okay.

807
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:14,119
You fucking bastard!
Fucker! Come here, you little fuck!

808
00:58:25,547 --> 00:58:28,050
I know who killed the kid.

809
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:30,010
Yeah? Where the fuck is he, then?

810
00:58:31,345 --> 00:58:32,596
He's on this train.

811
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:34,640
Well, that narrows it down, then,
don't it?

812
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,396
Let go! Get off!

813
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:10,925
You gonna get that?

814
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:12,886
No.

815
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,597
You probably ought a get that.

816
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:21,562
It could be important.

817
00:59:24,189 --> 00:59:26,149
Okay, maybe it's important.

818
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:28,151
Fucking hell. Come here.

819
00:59:29,695 --> 00:59:30,529
Yeah, what do you want?

820
00:59:30,612 --> 00:59:33,212
The white death says to get off
at next stop holding the briefcase

821
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,033
or he will kill everyone on that train.

822
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:38,871
Okay, yeah, I can make it, but lemon,
he's a little tied up right now.

823
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:43,083
Both of you this time. With the case.
Or everyone dies.

824
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:47,337
Fuckin' paranoid, this lot.

825
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:48,982
You don't happen to have the case
on you, do ya?

826
00:59:49,006 --> 00:59:50,090
No.

827
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:54,845
Yeah, I don't think
I'd reach lemon in time anyway.

828
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:56,597
You still got his phone.

829
00:59:57,181 --> 00:59:58,348
Do you have a gun on ya?

830
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:03,228
- Don't like 'em.
- Well...

831
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:06,190
Game's up, mate.

832
01:00:06,273 --> 01:00:08,609
For what it's worth,
you seem like a right fucking asshole

833
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:10,777
and I'm glad
you're gonna fucking die with me.

834
01:00:10,861 --> 01:00:11,904
That's nice.

835
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:16,450
- Just curious.
- Yeah?

836
01:00:17,242 --> 01:00:19,036
Do they even know
what lemon looks like?

837
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:20,871
Wow.

838
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:24,291
You two do look like twins, huh?

839
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:28,545
Yeah, okay. We got the case, now what?

840
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:31,089
You still take the train to Kyoto station.

841
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:34,885
Yeah. Okay. We can do that. Wonderful.

842
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:35,968
Hey.

843
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:39,264
- Have you opened the case?
- No, of course not.

844
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:41,534
I never asked for the combination,
you know what I mean?

845
01:00:41,558 --> 01:00:42,726
Keep it safe that way.

846
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:45,812
So no one gets greedy.

847
01:01:03,247 --> 01:01:06,834
I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

848
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:09,461
- I have this bad luck thing.
- Is that what you call it?

849
01:01:09,545 --> 01:01:10,963
I hit the thing and it went:

850
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:14,424
- Why did you even bother trying?
- I was trying to sell it.

851
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:16,027
Well, I don't think
they were in the market

852
01:01:16,051 --> 01:01:18,345
for fucking dildos and pantyhose,
were they?

853
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:19,972
But they were buying it.

854
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:21,973
I had 'em.

855
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:27,813
You proved you're smarter
than everyone. You've won, kid.

856
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:29,731
Please.

857
01:01:31,525 --> 01:01:32,651
Please, kid.

858
01:01:34,152 --> 01:01:35,153
Call your man.

859
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:38,240
I'll do what you want.

860
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,493
Just leave my son alone.

861
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:44,036
Your son.

862
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:48,959
Do you know how easy it was
to get him to follow me up onto that roof?

863
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:53,172
Didn't think
it would take you three hours

864
01:01:53,255 --> 01:01:56,925
to even realize your son was missing.

865
01:01:57,426 --> 01:01:59,178
You're a terrible father,

866
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:01,722
and your son is going to pay

867
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:03,765
for all the mistakes that you've made.

868
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:08,061
You don't know anything about life.

869
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:11,148
How hard it is.

870
01:02:12,399 --> 01:02:13,817
You're just...

871
01:02:14,568 --> 01:02:15,986
Some spoiled girl

872
01:02:16,778 --> 01:02:18,197
who breaks their toys

873
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:21,116
when mommy says she has to pick up.

874
01:02:21,867 --> 01:02:26,371
Sorry. Pardon me, I don't mean
to interrupt what's going on here.

875
01:02:26,455 --> 01:02:28,165
But you wouldn't happen to have seen

876
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:31,251
a tiny white prick with a pair of glasses
come through here, have you?

877
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:35,464
No.

878
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:38,509
What about a silver case with a train
sticker by the handle? You seen that?

879
01:02:38,592 --> 01:02:40,260
It's not ringing any...

880
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:43,931
Uncle kimura, have you seen
a silver briefcase with the train...

881
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:46,266
Did you say
"train sticker by the handle"?

882
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,286
- The handle had a train sticker.
- That's unique.

883
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:51,063
No, I haven't seen anything like that.
I think I'd remember.

884
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:54,149
"Uncle kimura"?

885
01:02:54,816 --> 01:02:57,611
- Yeah.
- Right. Are you okay? That's...

886
01:02:57,694 --> 01:03:00,656
Oh, yeah. Never shave on a bullet train,
you know what they say.

887
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:04,409
Well, couldn't hurt to ask, you know?
I'm just gonna keep following him.

888
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:06,119
Pardon me, "uncle kimura."

889
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:07,371
You guys take care.

890
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:09,289
Just one thing, though.

891
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:14,336
Most people assume "suitcase,"
you know, 'cause it's a train,

892
01:03:14,419 --> 01:03:15,629
overnight and all.

893
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:17,463
But you...

894
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:19,341
You said "briefcase."

895
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:21,718
I never said "briefcase."

896
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:23,720
I think...

897
01:03:25,055 --> 01:03:26,640
I found my diesel.

898
01:03:32,145 --> 01:03:33,897
You know what's waiting for us in Kyoto.

899
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:38,068
We should just get off this train. Now.

900
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:41,334
If you think I'm stepping off this train
without lemon or the case,

901
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:42,363
you must be mistaken.

902
01:03:42,406 --> 01:03:44,783
Okay. Well, the case is
in the first-class lounge.

903
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:48,161
It's behind the bar.
It's in a trash can. It's yours.

904
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:50,038
Me, I'm getting off.

905
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:52,475
I'm gonna go find a temple
and reevaluate my choices or something.

906
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:54,835
Ooh, that sounds very lovely,
but here's the deal.

907
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:56,628
I still need a fall guy.

908
01:03:57,421 --> 01:03:58,547
Shit.

909
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:01,216
- You need a fall guy.
- Yeah.

910
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,343
No, I understand. I get it.

911
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:07,639
It's a bit of a conundrum,
'cause I'm thinking,

912
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:09,308
"do I hand him back in one piece"

913
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:12,686
or do I chop you up into little pieces
and stuff you inside a fucking momomon.

914
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:14,813
That's what's
going through my head right now.

915
01:04:16,857 --> 01:04:17,691
Or...

916
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:19,443
Or what? You got a better idea, do ya?

917
01:04:20,194 --> 01:04:22,446
You know, before us now is just a wall,

918
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:24,781
but it's an illusion, man,
it's a construct.

919
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:27,492
You know,
'cause within that wall sits a window.

920
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:29,161
A window of opportunity.

921
01:04:29,786 --> 01:04:30,829
Damn it. It's a door.

922
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:34,416
Within that wall is a door.

923
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:36,793
I'm finding it very hard
to follow this story.

924
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:38,795
My point is, that door is closing.

925
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:54,061
Now the only question is:

926
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:56,188
Which one is the diesel,
which one is the duck?

927
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:57,356
"The duck"?

928
01:04:57,439 --> 01:05:00,025
It's a kid's show.
Thomas the train engine.

929
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:02,736
Close. Thomas the tank engine.

930
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:03,987
Please, mister.

931
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:06,657
This man, he kidnapped me,

932
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:09,826
and he said that he's going
to hold me for ransom.

933
01:05:12,246 --> 01:05:14,831
I'm sorry.
I get captivated by white-girl tears.

934
01:05:14,915 --> 01:05:15,707
Bravo.

935
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:19,253
Common sense tells me that this old,
shaky geezer here is the one in charge,

936
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:20,879
but I'm really good at reading people

937
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:23,549
and something tells me
that you are just not fucking right.

938
01:05:26,593 --> 01:05:30,931
So... let's see here.
I mean, I can't shoot you both.

939
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:33,934
Then I get no answers.

940
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:38,146
How about this? I'm sure you'll love this.
We're gonna play a little game.

941
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,524
If you wanna play a game,
put both your hands up.

942
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,234
Perfect. I knew you would like this.

943
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:45,237
You're gonna close your eyes,
and I'm gonna count to three.

944
01:05:45,779 --> 01:05:47,499
Whichever one is in charge,
raise your hand.

945
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:49,491
Whichever one isn't,
you point at the one who is.

946
01:05:49,575 --> 01:05:52,053
Now if you both raise your hands
or you both point at each other,

947
01:05:52,077 --> 01:05:53,972
I know you're both liars,
and the truth ain't in ya.

948
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:55,914
And then I'll fucking shoot you both.
Ready?

949
01:05:55,998 --> 01:05:59,042
You said you couldn't kill us both.
You'd get no answers.

950
01:05:59,126 --> 01:06:01,295
- I did say that. Didn't I?
- Yes.

951
01:06:02,504 --> 01:06:05,424
Sometimes you gotta shoot first
and come up with answers later.

952
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:07,217
One.

953
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:09,821
Or if I don't answer
this phone when you call...

954
01:06:09,845 --> 01:06:12,514
Two. Three.
Kill wataru.

955
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:42,252
Am I dreaming?

956
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:14,034
Sorry, mate. Not your lucky day.

957
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:22,334
I have a wire in my bag,

958
01:07:22,417 --> 01:07:26,421
and I think that we could use it
to lock the door from the outside.

959
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:29,383
It was so scary.

960
01:07:29,466 --> 01:07:33,846
He said that if I didn't do what he said,
or if I yelled or anything,

961
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:35,973
that he would do
awful, awful things to me.

962
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:37,766
Then why didn't you use this, then?

963
01:07:41,895 --> 01:07:45,566
Yeah, he kidnapped ya
and gave you his gun to hold, right?

964
01:07:45,649 --> 01:07:46,817
- No, no, no.
- Easy.

965
01:07:47,568 --> 01:07:50,863
Please. I don't know how to use a gun.
I don't know. Please.

966
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:52,573
Fuck me. You are fucking...

967
01:07:52,656 --> 01:07:55,033
You are really good.
You sure you didn't study?

968
01:07:55,117 --> 01:07:57,119
You're not even afraid
and your lip's quivering.

969
01:07:57,202 --> 01:07:59,830
That's a tear.
That is really authentic, mate.

970
01:07:59,913 --> 01:08:00,913
You're the diesel.

971
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:03,041
- I gotta kill ya.
- Please.

972
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,334
I'm just a kid. Please.

973
01:08:04,418 --> 01:08:07,296
How do you do that?!
It's really unbelievable!

974
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:08,463
Please. Please.

975
01:08:17,222 --> 01:08:18,222
I got...

976
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:21,560
It's fucking... you stay right there.

977
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:24,354
Did you...? What the fuck is happening?

978
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:27,566
Everyone loves lemons.

979
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:38,785
Fucking die!

980
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:53,300
I'm glad you enjoyed the performance.

981
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:56,178
How did you do that?

982
01:08:57,387 --> 01:08:58,805
I'm not sure.

983
01:08:58,889 --> 01:09:00,599
Just lucky, I guess.

984
01:09:02,601 --> 01:09:05,687
Tell tangerine... tell tangerine...

985
01:09:07,606 --> 01:09:08,690
Tangerine...

986
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:10,650
He's Gordon.

987
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:13,237
Tangerine is Gordon.

988
01:09:20,035 --> 01:09:24,081
Getting off this train.
I'm getting that case, and that's it.

989
01:09:32,214 --> 01:09:33,214
Hello?

990
01:09:33,757 --> 01:09:34,757
Yuichi.

991
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:40,347
It looks like yuichi lost his phone
on the bullet train.

992
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:42,182
You can pick it up
at Kyoto station, though.

993
01:09:42,266 --> 01:09:44,101
- Kyoto?
- There's this find my phone app.

994
01:09:46,061 --> 01:09:47,187
Surprisingly accurate.

995
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:48,313
Bye.

996
01:10:07,249 --> 01:10:09,168
God, he's got a great walk.

997
01:10:17,342 --> 01:10:18,385
Mr. Wolf.

998
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:21,138
So you came to kill the hornet.

999
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:30,772
What happened?

1000
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:35,736
Are you okay?

1001
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:40,741
Fuck, that thing is hot.

1002
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:50,834
Momomomo. Momomon. Mom on. Momomon.

1003
01:11:05,265 --> 01:11:06,767
The pastry chef.

1004
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:20,405
You stole my snake, bitch.

1005
01:11:22,324 --> 01:11:25,369
That was your...? We should really
call the authorities 'cause someone...

1006
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,544
Take that, punk!

1007
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:39,383
Hey, bitch. One little prick from this,
you know what happens?

1008
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:42,386
- Yes.
- Your blood congeals, clogging your veins.

1009
01:11:42,469 --> 01:11:45,264
- You bleed out of your fucking eye socket.
- I said yes!

1010
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:48,475
Weak-ass bitch.

1011
01:11:50,352 --> 01:11:51,937
- Stop!
- I'm taking that case.

1012
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,146
Give it!

1013
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:55,399
I was promised my money.

1014
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:58,569
- By who?
- Don't know. It was all online.

1015
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:00,571
They said my money was in the case.

1016
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:04,491
What? Someone paid you to have
the kid killed with his own ransom?

1017
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:06,076
Wow. That's dark.

1018
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:08,078
That is dark as... stop!

1019
01:12:12,332 --> 01:12:13,917
The hornet stings, bitch!

1020
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:16,461
Lady, you can have the case.

1021
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:18,881
Oh, but you've seen my face, bitch.

1022
01:12:30,434 --> 01:12:32,811
Thirty seconds
before the venom does its thing.

1023
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,706
You bitch.

1024
01:12:52,789 --> 01:12:55,959
Oh, shit, man. Do you have a backup?

1025
01:12:56,043 --> 01:12:58,170
What do you think, bitch?

1026
01:13:00,714 --> 01:13:02,049
Oh, shit, man.

1027
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:05,427
You don't have another one?

1028
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:07,346
You gotta be better prepared.

1029
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:10,224
I'm mansplaining,
I'm mansplaining again. I'm sorry.

1030
01:13:12,142 --> 01:13:14,102
Can I get you something?

1031
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:22,402
You don't seem like a religious person.

1032
01:13:24,488 --> 01:13:26,823
Water? Would you like some water?

1033
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:29,117
No?

1034
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,495
You want a blanket?

1035
01:13:31,578 --> 01:13:33,497
You want me to hold your hand?

1036
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:45,759
Karma is a bitch.

1037
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:02,728
Talk to me.

1038
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:05,607
It's my bad luck.
It's bad luck on acid.

1039
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:07,651
I gotta get off this train.

1040
01:16:07,734 --> 01:16:09,069
Do you have the case?

1041
01:16:10,237 --> 01:16:11,237
Yes.

1042
01:16:11,864 --> 01:16:13,991
Are you lying on the ground
in the fetal position?

1043
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:17,411
I'm not on the ground.

1044
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:18,745
You need to get up.

1045
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:21,790
- How do you always know what I'm doing?
- Because I know you.

1046
01:16:21,874 --> 01:16:23,500
I could journal. I should journal.

1047
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:27,212
Ladybug. Ladybug. Breathe. Deep breaths.

1048
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:30,007
We're almost there.
You just need to get up.

1049
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:31,883
Right.

1050
01:16:51,862 --> 01:16:54,489
You have been lying to me, my friend.

1051
01:16:56,158 --> 01:16:58,452
Well, cat's out of the bag now, innit?

1052
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:01,788
You were responsible
for keeping my son safe,

1053
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:03,290
for keeping my money safe.

1054
01:17:03,373 --> 01:17:05,667
I don't know a thing or two
about being a parent.

1055
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:07,085
But you know what I would do,

1056
01:17:07,586 --> 01:17:10,297
being that it's your son
and your money?

1057
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:15,010
I'd stop crying about your dead wife,
get off your fucking lazy ass,

1058
01:17:15,093 --> 01:17:16,887
come here and finish the job yourself.

1059
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:19,056
But as we're having
a bit of a heart-to-heart,

1060
01:17:19,139 --> 01:17:20,599
got a couple things to tell ya.

1061
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:21,826
Your son's a complete bell end

1062
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:24,311
and fuckin' deserves
to be bleeding out of his eye sockets.

1063
01:17:24,394 --> 01:17:26,939
And as for your case,
I haven't seen it since Tokyo.

1064
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:28,542
And I hope someone's fuckin' found it,

1065
01:17:28,607 --> 01:17:31,401
put it all on red
and having a fuckin' wonderful time.

1066
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:33,529
I will meet you at Kyoto station.

1067
01:17:33,612 --> 01:17:35,948
Oh, how wonderful. I can't fucking wait.

1068
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:40,369
I want to look into your eyes
when I kill you and your brother.

1069
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,084
My brother.

1070
01:17:51,839 --> 01:17:54,216
I'm forever blowing bubbles

1071
01:17:54,299 --> 01:17:57,469
pretty bubbles in the air

1072
01:17:57,553 --> 01:17:59,137
west ham have taken it!

1073
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:01,890
West ham 1, Chelsea nil.

1074
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:09,439
Morning rush hour's rolling in
quite nicely.

1075
01:18:09,982 --> 01:18:10,816
What's your plan, mate?

1076
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:13,068
You gonna fuckin' waltz up here
and blow my brains out

1077
01:18:13,151 --> 01:18:15,362
in front of the whole
fuckin' carriage of witnesses?

1078
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:18,156
There is no one left on that train.

1079
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:19,740
I know.

1080
01:18:20,325 --> 01:18:24,329
I bought every ticket
until the end of the line.

1081
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:28,958
Oi.

1082
01:18:29,459 --> 01:18:30,459
You.

1083
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:31,920
I know you.

1084
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:34,423
You're that girl, aren't ya?

1085
01:18:34,506 --> 01:18:35,883
Oh, my god.

1086
01:18:35,966 --> 01:18:37,801
Yeah, I never forget a face, me.

1087
01:18:37,885 --> 01:18:40,053
I'm so happy to see you.
Please help me.

1088
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:43,765
There's this man,
and he was holding me hostage.

1089
01:18:43,849 --> 01:18:47,978
He was wearing glasses,
and he killed my uncle.

1090
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:50,147
And he also killed
this other man who, I don't know,

1091
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:54,985
he just kept talking about
Thomas the trains and...

1092
01:18:55,068 --> 01:18:56,236
Tank engine.

1093
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,362
Yeah, right. Exactly.

1094
01:18:57,446 --> 01:18:58,780
But he killed both of them,

1095
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:02,618
and then he said he was going to get away
with some sort of money. I don't know.

1096
01:19:03,243 --> 01:19:06,914
I'm sorry, darling. I beg your pardon.
I don't know who the fuck you are.

1097
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:12,377
I'm just a girl who was supposed
to get off at nagoya, and then this man...

1098
01:19:12,461 --> 01:19:13,879
That was fucking ages ago.

1099
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:17,382
I know, but this man, he just said
that I could be a good backup plan

1100
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:19,843
and that a pretty girl
makes a good hostage.

1101
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:23,138
Well, he ain't wrong there.
But, look, keep your fucking knickers on.

1102
01:19:23,222 --> 01:19:25,557
- Please just help me.
- All right. Calm down.

1103
01:19:25,682 --> 01:19:28,101
Get off or do what the fuck you like.
You're free to go.

1104
01:19:28,185 --> 01:19:29,686
- Thank you.
- It's all right. Go on.

1105
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:31,450
I don't know
what you're doing here anyway.

1106
01:19:36,151 --> 01:19:37,444
Are you okay?

1107
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:38,903
Diesel.

1108
01:19:39,363 --> 01:19:41,198
The absolutely fucking worst.

1109
01:19:41,865 --> 01:19:43,200
Little shit stirrer.

1110
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:48,664
See, lemon...

1111
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:52,835
God rest his soul,

1112
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:55,170
was the Don.

1113
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:58,006
And he could read people,

1114
01:19:58,549 --> 01:20:00,175
see them for who they really are.

1115
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:02,427
He was right.

1116
01:20:03,053 --> 01:20:04,304
There's been a diesel

1117
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:09,351
running up and down this train,
causing all sorts of fucking havoc.

1118
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:13,939
And it was you the whole fucking time,
you dirty little diesel!

1119
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:19,194
You made lemon bleed...

1120
01:20:19,945 --> 01:20:21,864
And lemon never bleeds.

1121
01:20:22,906 --> 01:20:24,950
Oh, my god! Mister, please help me!

1122
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:27,494
Please! Please help me! Please!

1123
01:20:27,578 --> 01:20:29,413
What the fuck are you doing,
you bell end!

1124
01:20:47,264 --> 01:20:48,307
What?

1125
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:49,391
Diesel!

1126
01:20:49,474 --> 01:20:50,642
What?

1127
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:52,728
You fucking bell end!

1128
01:20:57,191 --> 01:20:58,358
You're a diesel.

1129
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:01,737
What the fuck?

1130
01:21:04,156 --> 01:21:05,324
What the fuck?

1131
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:09,494
He said that he was going to kill you
and blame everything on you.

1132
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:15,083
He also said that there's someone
waiting for us at Kyoto station.

1133
01:21:15,876 --> 01:21:18,921
Someone scary, who would hurt me.

1134
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:21,590
No one's gonna hurt you.

1135
01:21:22,132 --> 01:21:23,509
It's okay.

1136
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:25,719
We're getting off this train.

1137
01:21:34,478 --> 01:21:36,730
We make the next stop, we'll be fine.

1138
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:58,042
Okay, kid, come o...

1139
01:21:58,085 --> 01:21:59,211
Kid, come on!

1140
01:22:00,003 --> 01:22:01,630
I can't, my backpack is stuck!

1141
01:22:01,713 --> 01:22:02,756
What?

1142
01:22:03,674 --> 01:22:04,800
Leave it, let's go.

1143
01:22:04,883 --> 01:22:06,677
- We gotta go, we gotta go.
- No, I can't!

1144
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,053
Right now, young lady!

1145
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:10,097
- No!
- It's our last chance!

1146
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,390
Please come back!

1147
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:12,808
Kid, please.

1148
01:22:12,891 --> 01:22:15,769
I'm scared,
I don't want to be alone, please!

1149
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,484
I got it.

1150
01:22:22,568 --> 01:22:25,112
It's not your fault, kid.

1151
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:27,531
It's my luck, not yours.

1152
01:22:30,075 --> 01:22:32,327
You got your whole life ahead of you.

1153
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:35,122
Make sure you do something
that brings you peace.

1154
01:22:35,956 --> 01:22:38,625
'Cause everything else
is a pain in the ass.

1155
01:22:39,418 --> 01:22:43,046
And if you run into a guy named carver,
he's a dick.

1156
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:44,715
You can tell him I said so.

1157
01:22:52,306 --> 01:22:54,099
I took this. I didn't want to leave it.

1158
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,436
The man had it,
and I thought you could probably use it

1159
01:22:57,519 --> 01:23:00,314
to kill whoever's waiting
for us at the end of the line.

1160
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,025
You're not going to let me get hurt.

1161
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:04,526
Be honest.

1162
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,320
Be honest.

1163
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:08,822
Who's there with you?

1164
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:15,829
Really?

1165
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:17,580
Right.

1166
01:23:18,081 --> 01:23:20,626
Okay, fella, you're creepin' me out.

1167
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:24,838
So, if you don't mind,
could you just find another seat, like,

1168
01:23:24,922 --> 01:23:28,217
way, way, way down there?

1169
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:32,262
And that way,
I won't have to tell you twice.

1170
01:23:33,013 --> 01:23:34,013
No.

1171
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:35,849
You won't.

1172
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,815
Let's just move. Let me grab your bag.

1173
01:23:56,995 --> 01:23:58,247
Was that a snake?

1174
01:23:58,330 --> 01:24:00,082
Would you know where my son is?

1175
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:22,312
Oh, fuck.

1176
01:24:34,575 --> 01:24:35,701
After everything.

1177
01:24:42,332 --> 01:24:43,959
You are the person

1178
01:24:44,418 --> 01:24:48,046
who pushed my grandson
off the department store roof.

1179
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:49,256
Why?

1180
01:24:49,339 --> 01:24:50,465
Your son.

1181
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:54,636
He was going to help me
kill the white death at Kyoto station.

1182
01:24:55,762 --> 01:24:58,348
And that was the only way
to get him on this train.

1183
01:25:01,518 --> 01:25:02,936
The white death.

1184
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:04,479
That's right.

1185
01:25:04,605 --> 01:25:06,982
But he couldn't even do that.

1186
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:09,610
So he's dead.

1187
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,904
Just a few cars back.

1188
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:14,031
They are both dead.

1189
01:25:21,914 --> 01:25:24,666
My grandson was pushed off a roof.

1190
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:28,795
What makes you think
I would leave him unprotected?

1191
01:25:52,569 --> 01:25:54,780
My grandson is safe.

1192
01:25:55,864 --> 01:25:57,950
And my son is not dead.

1193
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:00,661
Listen, old man...

1194
01:26:00,744 --> 01:26:03,497
The only thing you know
about an old man, young lady,

1195
01:26:04,248 --> 01:26:06,667
is that he has survived much more,

1196
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:10,420
and much worse, than you.

1197
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,348
I'll fucking kill him myself.

1198
01:26:30,816 --> 01:26:32,442
- Are you all right?
- From that?

1199
01:26:34,111 --> 01:26:36,572
You're not gonna believe
this coincidence

1200
01:26:36,655 --> 01:26:41,118
but I already got a dose of antivenom
in me today, so I'm good.

1201
01:26:42,411 --> 01:26:43,704
Probably.

1202
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:47,039
The girl...

1203
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:49,793
Her intentions with you
were not honorable.

1204
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:51,587
Yeah.

1205
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:55,007
A blind man could see
you are the one in the dark.

1206
01:26:55,132 --> 01:26:58,010
I don't know about a blind man.
She was pretty convincing.

1207
01:26:59,011 --> 01:27:01,638
- What did you do to her?
- I did not need to do anything.

1208
01:27:02,556 --> 01:27:05,100
Fate will do what it wills.

1209
01:27:07,644 --> 01:27:09,855
Why do you laugh at fate?

1210
01:27:11,148 --> 01:27:16,069
Man, fate for me is
just another word for bad luck.

1211
01:27:17,321 --> 01:27:21,783
And that follows me around like...

1212
01:27:24,119 --> 01:27:25,996
I don't know, something witty.

1213
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:31,668
My handler calls me ladybug.

1214
01:27:32,377 --> 01:27:33,670
She's witty.

1215
01:27:33,754 --> 01:27:35,088
Ladybug?

1216
01:27:35,172 --> 01:27:36,006
Yeah.

1217
01:27:36,089 --> 01:27:38,592
This is very lucky, indeed.

1218
01:27:40,344 --> 01:27:42,471
No, she's being ironic, she...

1219
01:27:43,347 --> 01:27:44,223
Never mind.

1220
01:27:44,306 --> 01:27:46,350
I'm going to tell you a story now.

1221
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:48,060
- No, I'm good.
- It's short.

1222
01:27:48,769 --> 01:27:49,686
Really, I'm fine.

1223
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:51,897
No, it's very quick.

1224
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:53,565
No, no.

1225
01:27:53,649 --> 01:27:55,901
It's a good story for you, I think.

1226
01:27:56,485 --> 01:27:57,361
I'm cool.

1227
01:27:57,444 --> 01:27:58,487
Here we go.

1228
01:28:00,489 --> 01:28:01,907
A long time ago,

1229
01:28:02,491 --> 01:28:04,409
I made a promise to myself

1230
01:28:06,078 --> 01:28:10,499
that I would provide for my family
no matter what it cost.

1231
01:28:13,752 --> 01:28:19,091
I had risen to a highly coveted position
within the minegishi crime family.

1232
01:28:19,758 --> 01:28:22,010
A man raised up to take my place.

1233
01:28:22,094 --> 01:28:24,012
A man from the north.

1234
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:33,605
I asked minegishi not to trust this man.

1235
01:28:34,565 --> 01:28:38,610
Minegishi told me I had lost my appetite.

1236
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:39,694
He was not wrong.

1237
01:28:40,737 --> 01:28:42,239
But neither was I.

1238
01:29:05,262 --> 01:29:06,305
I returned home

1239
01:29:06,388 --> 01:29:11,018
and found nothing except ash and blood.

1240
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:32,247
The white death
had taken everything from me.

1241
01:29:32,331 --> 01:29:34,082
Almost.

1242
01:29:46,011 --> 01:29:47,471
I went into hiding.

1243
01:29:48,388 --> 01:29:51,433
I searched for a way
to strike at the white death

1244
01:29:51,517 --> 01:29:54,144
without endangering what I had left.

1245
01:29:54,853 --> 01:29:57,105
But he remained forever out of reach.

1246
01:29:58,857 --> 01:30:00,234
I did not think

1247
01:30:00,317 --> 01:30:03,987
fate would ever give me
a chance to make things right.

1248
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:09,034
Do you know what they call
a ladybug in Japan?

1249
01:30:12,162 --> 01:30:13,330
Ten to um us hi.

1250
01:30:13,872 --> 01:30:18,001
As a boy, I was told
there is a spot on its back

1251
01:30:18,085 --> 01:30:20,587
for each
of the seven sorrows of the world.

1252
01:30:21,588 --> 01:30:24,800
You see, ten to um us hi is not lucky.

1253
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:30,389
It holds all the bad luck
so that others may live in peace.

1254
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:35,727
I don't wanna hold the seven sorrows.

1255
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:39,773
Everything that's ever happened to you
has led you here.

1256
01:30:41,567 --> 01:30:42,609
Fate.

1257
01:30:43,193 --> 01:30:45,028
Well, that's a shit deal.

1258
01:30:46,947 --> 01:30:48,323
At Kyoto station,

1259
01:30:49,157 --> 01:30:51,994
the white death
will arrive on this train.

1260
01:30:53,036 --> 01:30:56,039
I will finally be allowed
to make things right.

1261
01:30:57,708 --> 01:30:59,668
My son is a few cars up.

1262
01:30:59,751 --> 01:31:02,462
If you could escort him off this train...

1263
01:31:03,505 --> 01:31:07,885
Yeah, I don't see the white death
letting any of us off this train.

1264
01:31:09,636 --> 01:31:11,847
You let me worry
about the white death.

1265
01:31:14,516 --> 01:31:15,516
Okay.

1266
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:19,813
Mr. Ladybug?

1267
01:31:22,482 --> 01:31:24,943
- Your briefcase.
- Thank you.

1268
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:37,915
Father.

1269
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:40,792
I don't understand.

1270
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,754
It is fate, my son.

1271
01:31:44,421 --> 01:31:45,589
And wataru?

1272
01:31:45,672 --> 01:31:46,882
He is safe.

1273
01:31:50,302 --> 01:31:51,302
Well...

1274
01:31:51,929 --> 01:31:53,514
He seemed like a decent guy.

1275
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:55,933
He shot me.

1276
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:57,558
Me, too.

1277
01:31:57,601 --> 01:31:58,601
Twice.

1278
01:31:59,353 --> 01:32:00,979
Still, he had another side to him...

1279
01:32:03,524 --> 01:32:04,608
Wow.

1280
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:09,613
Oh, man.

1281
01:32:11,031 --> 01:32:12,115
Am I in hell?

1282
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:16,662
Ah, fuck.

1283
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:22,125
Fuckin' vest, man.

1284
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:25,963
Oh, you drank the water.

1285
01:32:30,259 --> 01:32:32,094
Where the fuck is my brother?

1286
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:04,418
Aw, man.

1287
01:33:18,849 --> 01:33:19,849
You...

1288
01:33:24,938 --> 01:33:26,982
You were more
like Thomas anyway, right?

1289
01:34:01,391 --> 01:34:02,643
Fellas.

1290
01:34:02,726 --> 01:34:05,103
We need to come up with a plan.

1291
01:34:05,187 --> 01:34:09,149
You killed my brother.
You killed my brother, you piece of shit!

1292
01:34:09,233 --> 01:34:11,527
Yeah, you fucking shot me!

1293
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:13,410
I'll shoot you in the fucking throat
next time

1294
01:34:13,487 --> 01:34:15,364
and your fucking partner Keira knightley!

1295
01:34:15,447 --> 01:34:17,407
- She is not my...
- Hey! Fellas!

1296
01:34:17,491 --> 01:34:20,577
When we are so quick to anger,
we are slow to understand.

1297
01:34:20,661 --> 01:34:22,621
I'm fast to kick your ass, though,
I swear to god.

1298
01:34:24,206 --> 01:34:27,292
Fucking piece of shit! I should a
put a bullet through your fucking ass!

1299
01:34:27,376 --> 01:34:29,711
When you point a finger
at someone in blame,

1300
01:34:29,795 --> 01:34:31,839
there are four fingers
pointing back at you.

1301
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:34,758
Or three. That's weird.

1302
01:34:34,842 --> 01:34:37,177
Fuck it! That's it!
You know what I could do!

1303
01:34:37,261 --> 01:34:39,596
- We before me!
- You before fucking god...

1304
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:40,722
Gentlemen!

1305
01:34:41,807 --> 01:34:42,808
Get off me!

1306
01:34:43,642 --> 01:34:48,897
A plum does not resent the hungry man,
but the farmer who planted the tree.

1307
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:53,068
He resents the farmer?

1308
01:34:53,151 --> 01:34:55,988
So how do plums have fuckin' resentments?
So how can it resent?

1309
01:34:56,071 --> 01:34:58,907
Listen. The white death is the farmer.

1310
01:35:01,201 --> 01:35:03,453
So we're the plums. We're the plums?

1311
01:35:03,537 --> 01:35:06,017
It don't make sense.
Why are you motherfuckers using metaphors?

1312
01:35:06,081 --> 01:35:07,666
Look, he shot my fucking brother!

1313
01:35:07,749 --> 01:35:09,418
You shot my son!

1314
01:35:13,422 --> 01:35:15,048
We prepare together...

1315
01:35:16,008 --> 01:35:17,509
Or we die alone.

1316
01:35:19,344 --> 01:35:21,054
That's all I was trying to say.

1317
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:29,521
The white death waits for you
with his army of assassins.

1318
01:35:29,605 --> 01:35:32,191
Killers from all countries.

1319
01:35:32,774 --> 01:35:38,113
But he has no idea
my son and I are on this train.

1320
01:35:38,697 --> 01:35:40,157
If fate wills,

1321
01:35:41,033 --> 01:35:42,910
I will get my revenge.

1322
01:35:44,453 --> 01:35:47,998
I'll head to the back
and stop as many as I can.

1323
01:35:48,498 --> 01:35:52,085
I'll go to the driver car
and get us the fuck out of here.

1324
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:59,760
What are you gonna do, joburg?

1325
01:36:01,887 --> 01:36:03,222
I'm gonna buy us some time.

1326
01:37:01,405 --> 01:37:02,447
Daughter.

1327
01:37:04,241 --> 01:37:05,409
Father.

1328
01:37:13,584 --> 01:37:16,461
Hey, fellas, I'm looking for a Mr. Death.

1329
01:37:16,587 --> 01:37:18,088
Got his case here.

1330
01:37:18,839 --> 01:37:20,215
Hey, easy.

1331
01:37:28,515 --> 01:37:30,184
Hurt people hurt people.

1332
01:37:37,149 --> 01:37:38,567
I came to see you.

1333
01:37:40,694 --> 01:37:43,113
And to make you finally see me.

1334
01:37:45,073 --> 01:37:46,575
The real me.

1335
01:37:49,411 --> 01:37:53,165
I built myself up
from the nothing you gave me.

1336
01:37:53,248 --> 01:37:56,043
All so I could be
the one in front of you today...

1337
01:37:57,002 --> 01:37:58,629
My finger on the trigger.

1338
01:38:00,881 --> 01:38:02,466
I was the one...

1339
01:38:03,592 --> 01:38:05,469
Who deserved your attention.

1340
01:38:09,723 --> 01:38:10,891
Your love.

1341
01:38:11,892 --> 01:38:15,479
I'm more like you
than that little fuck up ever was.

1342
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:30,827
Do it.

1343
01:38:33,247 --> 01:38:34,665
I came here to kill you.

1344
01:38:37,084 --> 01:38:38,418
So kill me.

1345
01:38:40,754 --> 01:38:43,549
Kill me like you did
all the others who tried the same.

1346
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:56,144
Do it.

1347
01:39:02,484 --> 01:39:03,819
Fucking do it!

1348
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:10,701
Pow.

1349
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:19,126
I see you, dochka.

1350
01:39:20,377 --> 01:39:22,296
I always have.

1351
01:39:24,673 --> 01:39:28,468
But you have never been part of my plan.

1352
01:39:34,558 --> 01:39:36,018
We found the American!

1353
01:39:39,104 --> 01:39:40,522
What about the others?

1354
01:39:40,606 --> 01:39:41,940
They're all dead.

1355
01:39:42,566 --> 01:39:45,485
Good news is I have your case.

1356
01:39:46,737 --> 01:39:49,114
Ay, good news, good news.

1357
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:50,908
Check the case.

1358
01:39:50,991 --> 01:39:53,410
Hurry. Move. Let's go.

1359
01:39:55,037 --> 01:39:56,288
Clear the train.

1360
01:39:58,498 --> 01:40:01,960
All right, Thomas.
Time for you to start up...

1361
01:40:02,044 --> 01:40:04,588
Oh, shit. Everything's in Japanese.

1362
01:40:04,671 --> 01:40:06,590
There is no episode in Japanese.
What the f...?

1363
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:12,387
Get on the ground!

1364
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:23,190
Man, I got a bad feeling about this.
We have no idea what's in this case.

1365
01:40:23,273 --> 01:40:24,353
What are you talkin' about?

1366
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:26,818
Why is it always gotta be us
that opens this shit?

1367
01:40:26,902 --> 01:40:28,612
Just open the goddamn case.

1368
01:40:28,695 --> 01:40:30,405
I'd like to keep my fuckin' arms.

1369
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:33,534
Mr. Death, if I may?

1370
01:40:34,785 --> 01:40:36,662
The shadow buyer

1371
01:40:37,329 --> 01:40:40,999
who bought all our contracts,
got us all on this train.

1372
01:40:41,083 --> 01:40:42,083
Me, the hornet,

1373
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:43,585
tangerine, lemon...

1374
01:40:45,337 --> 01:40:46,797
That was you, right?

1375
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,092
Yes, very astute.

1376
01:40:50,175 --> 01:40:52,970
I brought you on this train
hoping you'd kill each other.

1377
01:40:53,053 --> 01:40:54,053
Okay.

1378
01:40:56,014 --> 01:40:58,684
If I could... why?

1379
01:40:58,767 --> 01:41:01,103
Why you do what you do?

1380
01:41:01,186 --> 01:41:03,897
You know, I've been
asking that very question.

1381
01:41:03,981 --> 01:41:06,358
If it's so safe,
why didn't he just open it?

1382
01:41:06,441 --> 01:41:08,777
What if it's a bomb
and it blows up in our faces?

1383
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:11,321
You think these stupid masks
are gonna protect us?

1384
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:18,829
All these years later...

1385
01:41:18,912 --> 01:41:23,292
The burden of your betrayal
still heavy upon your heads.

1386
01:41:25,627 --> 01:41:28,046
Let me relieve you of both.

1387
01:41:29,131 --> 01:41:30,424
My wife...

1388
01:41:31,758 --> 01:41:33,135
Was taken from me.

1389
01:41:36,555 --> 01:41:40,893
I heard. I'm so sorry for your loss.
It was a horrible accident.

1390
01:41:42,978 --> 01:41:44,813
- Horrible.
- Oh, no.

1391
01:41:44,897 --> 01:41:48,400
No. Nothing in life is an accident.

1392
01:41:49,026 --> 01:41:51,987
It was an assassination attempt on me.

1393
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:53,070
But fate...

1394
01:41:54,948 --> 01:41:58,327
Fate put two wet work operatives,

1395
01:41:58,869 --> 01:42:02,372
twins, on a job in Bolivia,

1396
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:06,793
butchering my entire crew.

1397
01:42:06,877 --> 01:42:09,630
And I had to go deal with it.

1398
01:42:09,713 --> 01:42:12,090
And he didn't hire
two random operators, lemon.

1399
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:14,551
No, he asked for the two
responsible for the Bolivia job.

1400
01:42:14,635 --> 01:42:19,765
That is why it was my wife
in the car that night,

1401
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:21,390
not me.

1402
01:42:21,808 --> 01:42:24,895
Fate put my wife in the hospital.

1403
01:42:25,687 --> 01:42:27,523
A piece of her rib

1404
01:42:28,398 --> 01:42:30,442
piercing her heart.

1405
01:42:32,861 --> 01:42:37,991
Only the most skilled cardiovascular
surgeon could save her life.

1406
01:42:40,327 --> 01:42:45,332
But two nights earlier,
this surgeon was poisoned.

1407
01:42:48,043 --> 01:42:48,877
Oh, my god!

1408
01:42:48,961 --> 01:42:51,672
Fate. Fate again.

1409
01:42:52,506 --> 01:42:53,966
They said my money was in the case!

1410
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:58,428
Don't wanna sound judgmental,
but if you hired the hornet,

1411
01:42:58,554 --> 01:43:00,722
you had your own kid killed?

1412
01:43:00,806 --> 01:43:02,474
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

1413
01:43:02,558 --> 01:43:04,852
Oh, yes, I did. The piece of shit.

1414
01:43:05,352 --> 01:43:06,353
Please, please.

1415
01:43:06,436 --> 01:43:07,436
That night...

1416
01:43:08,146 --> 01:43:10,858
- Please pick me up.
- I told her not to leave.

1417
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:13,193
To wait for me.

1418
01:43:13,819 --> 01:43:18,782
But she promised it was the last time
we would ever bail him out of trouble.

1419
01:43:18,866 --> 01:43:21,285
I will come. I will always come for you.

1420
01:43:21,994 --> 01:43:25,497
Well, I suppose she was right.

1421
01:43:26,248 --> 01:43:29,751
If I had amputated that weakness

1422
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:32,421
out of my life years ago,

1423
01:43:32,504 --> 01:43:35,299
she would still be by my side!

1424
01:43:35,883 --> 01:43:39,011
Yeah, it helps to process this.
I have a good therapist.

1425
01:43:39,094 --> 01:43:40,971
I loved my wife very much.

1426
01:43:42,389 --> 01:43:44,224
She taught me a valuable lesson.

1427
01:43:44,933 --> 01:43:47,019
If you do not control your fate...

1428
01:43:48,353 --> 01:43:49,563
It will control you.

1429
01:43:51,273 --> 01:43:53,567
So I took control.

1430
01:43:53,650 --> 01:43:55,444
I brought them all here to die.

1431
01:44:00,324 --> 01:44:03,535
But now there is only one left.

1432
01:44:05,704 --> 01:44:07,581
Mr. Carver.

1433
01:44:09,458 --> 01:44:10,584
Excuse me?

1434
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:12,628
I'm filling in for carver?
Calling in sick?

1435
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:14,004
Fuck carver.

1436
01:44:14,087 --> 01:44:16,507
The man who murdered my wife.

1437
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:23,764
Bro.

1438
01:44:23,847 --> 01:44:26,391
- Just open it!
- Fine. Ya happy?

1439
01:44:26,475 --> 01:44:27,475
I'm not carver!

1440
01:44:44,368 --> 01:44:45,368
He went that way.

1441
01:44:54,545 --> 01:44:56,129
Oh, shit. Okay.

1442
01:44:57,172 --> 01:44:58,882
Oh, shit. Something's happening.

1443
01:45:27,452 --> 01:45:28,829
Excuse me.

1444
01:45:30,205 --> 01:45:31,206
Yep.

1445
01:46:12,372 --> 01:46:13,916
Kimura.

1446
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:15,750
Why are you here?

1447
01:46:16,668 --> 01:46:17,878
Your daughter.

1448
01:46:17,961 --> 01:46:19,838
It would seem she pushed...

1449
01:46:19,922 --> 01:46:22,549
The wrong grandson off a roof.

1450
01:46:26,261 --> 01:46:29,640
Ah, children. You do the best you can
to raise them right.

1451
01:46:31,433 --> 01:46:33,227
Cockroach,
I do not know why you are here,

1452
01:46:33,352 --> 01:46:36,605
but move out of my way
or you will join your wife.

1453
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:40,275
Our paths were destined
to return to each other.

1454
01:46:43,403 --> 01:46:44,403
Okay.

1455
01:46:44,863 --> 01:46:48,075
Wait. Fuckin' slow down, mate. Come on!

1456
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:50,869
Hey, so far so good.
You can stop the train.

1457
01:46:50,953 --> 01:46:54,248
About that. I took the velocity
of the train and divided it by the mass,

1458
01:46:54,331 --> 01:46:57,167
and I realized that I don't know how
to fuckin' drive a bullet train.

1459
01:46:57,251 --> 01:46:59,002
Dude, all you do is talk about trains.

1460
01:46:59,086 --> 01:47:01,421
Thomas is a metaphor for life,
not how to actually drive...

1461
01:47:01,547 --> 01:47:02,881
Get down!

1462
01:47:29,867 --> 01:47:30,909
Shit.

1463
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:40,502
I got this! Stop the train!

1464
01:47:40,586 --> 01:47:41,753
What?!

1465
01:48:33,472 --> 01:48:34,872
English, English, English, English.

1466
01:48:35,516 --> 01:48:37,184
English. Brakes!

1467
01:48:37,267 --> 01:48:39,394
We're good! I got it!

1468
01:48:40,854 --> 01:48:41,854
No!

1469
01:48:44,775 --> 01:48:46,985
- Hold on!
- We're on the wrong track!

1470
01:49:01,834 --> 01:49:03,335
- Oi, joburg!
- What?

1471
01:49:06,547 --> 01:49:07,923
I'm sorry I shot you!

1472
01:49:08,006 --> 01:49:10,092
Actually it was, like, twice!

1473
01:49:14,179 --> 01:49:15,097
Sorry?

1474
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:17,140
You shot me twice!

1475
01:49:28,986 --> 01:49:30,279
I'm sorry I shot you twice.

1476
01:49:32,406 --> 01:49:33,406
Thanks, man!

1477
01:49:34,199 --> 01:49:35,534
That shows real growth!

1478
01:49:39,872 --> 01:49:42,332
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck.

1479
01:49:51,717 --> 01:49:53,343
You are not ruled by strength.

1480
01:49:53,427 --> 01:49:54,803
You are ruled by fear!

1481
01:49:55,762 --> 01:49:58,348
Fear of the one thing
deep down you cannot control!

1482
01:50:06,190 --> 01:50:07,608
Fear of fate!

1483
01:50:15,949 --> 01:50:18,952
Hey, and I'm sorry about tangerine.

1484
01:50:20,245 --> 01:50:21,288
Yeah.

1485
01:50:22,497 --> 01:50:23,497
Yeah.

1486
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:26,376
But I got another brother now.

1487
01:50:27,002 --> 01:50:28,002
Really?

1488
01:50:30,797 --> 01:50:31,797
Fuck no!

1489
01:50:56,031 --> 01:50:57,741
For old times' sake.

1490
01:51:39,283 --> 01:51:40,367
Fuck it.

1491
01:52:04,433 --> 01:52:06,059
$♪%♪

1492
01:52:11,023 --> 01:52:12,608
B-20.

1493
01:52:13,984 --> 01:52:14,985
Let's go.

1494
01:52:17,446 --> 01:52:18,989
- Oh, mate.
- Yeah?

1495
01:52:19,531 --> 01:52:20,908
I wanted bubble milk tea.

1496
01:52:20,991 --> 01:52:22,159
How about a wagon wheel?

1497
01:52:52,397 --> 01:52:53,607
A father...

1498
01:52:54,274 --> 01:52:55,317
Protects his family.

1499
01:54:27,868 --> 01:54:30,913
Oh, fuck.

1500
01:54:34,291 --> 01:54:37,377
About your wife,
I had nothing to do with that.

1501
01:54:38,086 --> 01:54:39,171
It's a mistake.

1502
01:54:39,296 --> 01:54:40,964
I'm not carver.

1503
01:54:42,382 --> 01:54:44,843
I only do snatch-and-grab jobs.

1504
01:54:45,427 --> 01:54:48,805
The carver! I want the carver!
I hired the carver!

1505
01:54:48,889 --> 01:54:51,308
No, he had a stomach thing, man.

1506
01:54:51,391 --> 01:54:52,976
I'm just filling in.

1507
01:54:57,689 --> 01:54:59,149
You're filling in.

1508
01:54:59,233 --> 01:55:02,194
For what it's worth, carver is a dick.

1509
01:55:02,277 --> 01:55:04,279
The most cunning assassin...?

1510
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:06,240
Maybe the laziest.

1511
01:55:15,749 --> 01:55:17,376
Aw, come on.

1512
01:55:18,335 --> 01:55:19,920
Just let it go, bro.

1513
01:55:20,003 --> 01:55:22,798
Do not call me "bro"!

1514
01:55:24,424 --> 01:55:25,509
Okay.

1515
01:55:41,441 --> 01:55:42,609
Dude, did you see that?

1516
01:55:43,527 --> 01:55:44,527
What was that?

1517
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:52,160
Dude.

1518
01:55:54,079 --> 01:55:55,247
It's done.

1519
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:12,973
Hey, about this plum. Shouldn't the plum
give up all resentment? Like...

1520
01:56:14,933 --> 01:56:16,476
Oh, my god.

1521
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:21,815
It's my luck that delivered
my father's corpse at my feet.

1522
01:56:21,899 --> 01:56:24,401
The narcissism on this chick.

1523
01:56:24,484 --> 01:56:25,527
Untreatable.

1524
01:56:25,652 --> 01:56:27,029
Now I am...

1525
01:56:27,112 --> 01:56:29,114
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1526
01:56:29,198 --> 01:56:30,115
What?

1527
01:56:30,199 --> 01:56:32,576
What is with this fucked-up family?

1528
01:56:33,493 --> 01:56:35,787
You need some suggested reading,
if I may.

1529
01:56:36,455 --> 01:56:38,332
Surviving borderline personality disorder.

1530
01:56:38,415 --> 01:56:39,415
What?

1531
01:56:39,458 --> 01:56:40,584
I highly recommend it.

1532
01:56:40,667 --> 01:56:43,712
Now I am the white d...

1533
01:56:46,798 --> 01:56:47,798
What was that?

1534
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:52,888
Was that Karma?

1535
01:56:52,971 --> 01:56:55,557
Farewell, ten to um us hi.

1536
01:56:58,185 --> 01:56:59,269
Tangerine.

1537
01:57:16,912 --> 01:57:17,996
Maria?

1538
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:19,164
Take the gun.

1539
01:57:19,248 --> 01:57:20,791
Oh, my god, did you just say "whack"?

1540
01:57:20,916 --> 01:57:23,377
We're almost there.
You just need to get up.

1541
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:25,170
Did you come to rescue me?

1542
01:57:26,171 --> 01:57:27,548
Did you need rescuing?

1543
01:57:27,631 --> 01:57:29,299
You came to rescue me.

1544
01:57:29,383 --> 01:57:30,884
Please don't make me regret it.

1545
01:57:32,553 --> 01:57:36,807
Okay, don't. Don't. What's happening
to your face? Are you crying?

1546
01:57:36,890 --> 01:57:38,308
It's a lot to process.

1547
01:57:39,059 --> 01:57:42,020
I want you to know, you are the greatest,

1548
01:57:42,104 --> 01:57:44,731
most wonderful handler

1549
01:57:44,857 --> 01:57:47,693
that I could ever have. Ever. Ever.

1550
01:57:48,277 --> 01:57:50,946
Do you think maybe
there was a little head trauma?

1551
01:57:51,029 --> 01:57:52,781
- Maybe.
- Little bit, yeah.

1552
01:57:52,865 --> 01:57:55,284
- A little lightheaded.
- Yeah. Need a banana?

1553
01:57:55,367 --> 01:57:57,536
- Potassium might be good.
- Have one in the car.

1554
01:57:58,120 --> 01:57:58,954
Hey.

1555
01:57:59,037 --> 01:58:01,832
Next time, take the gun.
Don't listen to Barry.

1556
01:58:01,915 --> 01:58:03,750
Okay? Simple.

1557
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:07,588
Stop it.

1558
01:58:08,589 --> 01:58:09,423
- Stop.
- You know,

1559
01:58:09,506 --> 01:58:12,092
- I think you were right about one thing.
- Usually am. Come on.

1560
01:58:12,634 --> 01:58:14,928
Maybe it is just about how we frame it.

1561
01:58:15,012 --> 01:58:17,014
Like, maybe there's no bad luck
or good luck.

1562
01:58:17,097 --> 01:58:18,849
Maybe we're all just agents of fate.

1563
01:58:19,975 --> 01:58:21,560
- Nice car.
- Yes, it is.

1564
01:58:21,643 --> 01:58:22,811
Try not to bleed on it.

1565
01:58:29,985 --> 01:58:32,487
Holy mol...

1566
01:58:34,907 --> 01:58:35,907
Well...

1567
01:58:37,743 --> 01:58:39,536
How do you know it's a bad thing?

1568
01:58:41,914 --> 01:58:42,748
Really?

1569
01:58:42,831 --> 01:58:44,833
- See what I'm doing?
- I do.

1570
01:58:44,917 --> 01:58:46,919
- Turning that upside down.
- I do.

1571
01:58:48,295 --> 01:58:49,295
This is working.

1572
01:58:50,339 --> 01:58:51,339
Yeah.

1573
01:58:57,554 --> 01:58:58,889
Wasabi peas.

1574
01:58:59,515 --> 01:59:01,892
Fate obviously didn't want me
to have that banana.

1575
01:59:02,017 --> 01:59:04,186
Fate did not want us
to get in that car.

1576
01:59:04,269 --> 01:59:06,730
Well, maybe you've learned something
after all.

1577
01:59:07,731 --> 01:59:09,691
Fate needs me to find a smart toilet.

1578
01:59:09,775 --> 01:59:12,486
- I take that back. Can you hold it?
- I'm ball pointing.

1579
01:59:12,569 --> 01:59:15,280
- Walk faster.
- Okay. Yeah.

1580
01:59:40,931 --> 01:59:42,891
I'm alive! I'm Ali...

1581
01:59:43,559 --> 01:59:45,811
Oh, fuck me. Fuck me.

1582
01:59:49,898 --> 01:59:51,024
Come on, you fucker.

1583
01:59:51,650 --> 01:59:52,693
Fuck you!

1584
01:59:57,155 --> 01:59:58,824
Stop! Fucking stop!
