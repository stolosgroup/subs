The following film is based on art,
music, journals, super 8 films,

<i>Welcome to manned space exploration!</i>

<i>...Mercury spacecraft

<i>and nine feet tall.</i>

00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:42,167
<i>'Cause I don't like your face.</i>

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,706
<i>Hey.</i>

12
00:00:48,742 --> 00:00:50,290
<i>Hey, come here.</i>

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,395
<i>I want...</i>

14
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:57,082
<i>I want you to see something.</i>

15
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:08,527
<i>Kurt's brain
was just constantly going.</i>

16
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:11,647
<i>He was always thinking
about something.</i>

17
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:13,983
<i>I mean, there was always
something going on.</i>

18
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:15,484
<i>You could just see it.</i>

19
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:18,037
Party on, Wayne!

20
00:01:18,072 --> 00:01:20,456
It was awe-inspiring,
but it was like,

21
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:24,543
"Oh, well, I guess I'm not...
You know, I guess I'm not all that special."

22
00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:27,746
But, you know...
But then, as I grew up,

23
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:30,799
I'm like,
I'm so glad I don't...

24
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:32,584
I never got that genius brain.

25
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:46,982
Maybe he just felt praise
was hard for him to take, maybe?

26
00:01:47,018 --> 00:01:48,851
And he didn't know
how to handle that.

27
00:01:48,903 --> 00:01:51,937
So he would downplay it
all the time.

28
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:55,908
But that was his goal,
was to get to as perfect as he could,

29
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:57,576
as good as he could get.

30
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:01,113
Write as well as he could,
sing as well as he could,

31
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:03,282
play as well as he could.

32
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:05,167
And then when it all
came together...

33
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:16,628
It's so...
- I can't say... It's too painful.

34
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,181
This is too painful.

35
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:22,968
You're gonna make it, man.

36
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:27,189
With the support
of his friends and family,

37
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:28,941
he's gonna make it.

38
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:33,729
And you read...
See the art, I mean,

39
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:36,615
a lot of his messages
are as plain as day.

40
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,567
You just...
I'm not even going to say what they are,

41
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:39,785
but you can see it.

42
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,072
And it's all there, and...
20/20 hindsight,

43
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:44,656
you're like, "Oh, my God,
why didn't I see that?"

44
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,827
or "I should have said something",
but, you know, it's like...

45
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:03,509
# Some say love

46
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:07,730

<i>Yeah!</i>

67
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:40,155
<i>Well, America was booming
after the war,</i>

68
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:42,858
<i>and everybody had everything.</i>

69
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,910
Even if you didn't have much,

70
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:46,273
you still had enough.

Wendy O'Connor
Kurt's mother

72
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,118
<i>Aberdeen was a logging town
and a mill town.</i>

73
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,453
<i>And it was booming.</i>

74
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:56,205
<i># Wake up,
little Susie... </i>

75
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:57,956
<i>You saw everybody downtown</i>

76
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,627
<i>paying their bills or shopping.</i>

77
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:05,214
<i>It was a lovely,
awesome place to raise children.</i>

78
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:07,883
My kids loved that town.

79
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:10,302
<i># Wake up, little Susie,
and weep </i>

80
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:12,638
<i># The movie's over, it's 4:00 </i>

81
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,473
<i># And we're in trouble deep </i>

82
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:17,142
<i># Wake up, little Susie </i>

83
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:18,977
<i># Wake up, little Susie... </i>

84
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,396
<i>So Don was working
at a gas station</i>

85
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:23,148
<i>over in Hoquiam.</i>

86
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,067
<i>You know, he had the black,
horn-rimmed glasses</i>

87
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,818
<i>and his ears
kind of stuck out a little,</i>

88
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,037
<i>and he had the crew cut</i>

89
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:32,491
<i>and that's not good on anybody.</i>

90
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:34,159
<i>I kind of helped him
with everything.</i>

91
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:35,744
<i>He didn't really know
what he was doing with style.</i>

92
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:37,579
<i># Well, I told you, Mama... </i>

93
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:39,748
<i>I guess, like,
we were more friends.</i>

94
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,050
<i>I didn't know
what falling in love was,</i>

95
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:43,802
<i>so I had never experienced it.</i>

96
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:46,638
<i>So I just thought because I liked him,
I loved him.</i>

97
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:50,342
<i>And so he got me an engagement ring,
and we got engaged.</i>

98
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:52,010
<i>You know, it was fun.</i>

99
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:55,013
<i>I mean, it was like,
"Okay, all those problems are behind me now.</i>

100
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:57,015
<i>I'm going to have babies."</i>

101
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:06,525
<i>And I just couldn't wait
to get pregnant.</i>

102
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:09,278
<i>I mean, that was the goal.</i>

103
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,697
<i>And so I went to Dr. Ehrhart.
He said, "You're so young.</i>

104
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:15,033
<i>You just need to get on your
feet with being a housewife."</i>

105
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:16,952
<i>And, you know,</i>

106
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:19,004
<i>I just didn't listen
to anybody.</i>

107
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:23,375
<i>I used to think,
"Why did I marry Don Cobain?"</i>

108
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:28,046
<i>And it's like, "No, everything really
did happen for a reason."</i>

109
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,550
<i>Kurt had to be born.</i>

110
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:33,341
<i>It was... it was a must.</i>

111

Grays Harbor Community Hospital

114
00:06:56,794 --> 00:07:01,046
<i>He was the first grandchild
on both sides.</i>

115
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:03,999
<i>Everybody was coming over
constantly.</i>

116
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:07,085
<i>I can't even describe
what a magnet he was.</i>

117
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:08,850
<i>People just came to him.</i>

118
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:57,469
<i>I was head over heels
in love with that child.</i>

119
00:08:00,224 --> 00:08:05,143
<i>He was so kind and so
worried about people.</i>

120
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:09,648
<i>You know, if they were okay
or if somebody got hurt.</i>

121
00:08:12,486 --> 00:08:14,986
<i>And then, on top of that,</i>

122
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:18,540
<i>he started singing
and playing guitar.</i>

123
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:22,044
<i>And once he could draw,
he drew all the time.</i>

126
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:56,328
<i>Okay, say who you are.</i>

127
00:08:56,363 --> 00:08:57,779
<i>Who are you?</i>

128
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:00,248

<i>Who are you?</i>

<i>Who are you?
Good-bye!</i>

131

<i>I'm Kurt Cobain!</i>

132
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:09,841
<i>Yay!
- Yay!</i>

133
00:09:09,877 --> 00:09:11,796
<i>Go! Go!</i>

134
00:09:22,806 --> 00:09:26,691
<i>Kurt, he was full of energy,
always busy.</i>

135
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:28,727
<i>I had this old rocking chair</i>

136
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:30,562
<i>in the corner
of the front room.</i>

137
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:34,232
<i>He'd be upside down
with his head hanging off</i>

138
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:36,034
<i>where your legs would be</i>

139
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:39,070
<i>and his feet up on the back
of the rocking chair,</i>

140
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:42,374
<i>going 90 miles an hour in it,
going so fast,</i>

141
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,292
<i>and it would be hitting
the back of the wall.</i>

142
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:47,245
<i>And he'd be repeating
everything verbatim</i>

143
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:48,547
<i>off "Sesame Street."</i>

144
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:51,967
<i># Would you like to hear
my voice </i>

145
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:54,920
<i># Sprinkled with emotion? </i>

146
00:09:54,972 --> 00:09:56,638
<i>And I thought,
before I have this next baby,</i>

147
00:09:56,673 --> 00:10:00,008
<i>we've gotta try to get this
calmed down.</i>

148
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,345
<i>So I take him to the pediatrician,
Dr. Fulton.</i>

149
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:06,264
<i>He did a rapid eye
movement test</i>

150
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:08,433
<i>with a flashlight in his eyes,
and he went,</i>

151
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:11,603
<i>"Okay, we've got trouble here."</i>

152
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:13,822
<i># I cannot see... </i>

153
00:10:13,857 --> 00:10:16,107
<i>And he said,
"Okay, I'm gonna give you this tablet."</i>

154
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:21,363
<i>And I believe it was
something like Ritalin.</i>

155
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:25,584
<i>So I gave it to him that night and...
Oh, my God.</i>

156
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:27,452
<i>He just went off the rails.</i>

157
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:38,346
<i># If I had to lose a mile </i>

158
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:42,050
<i># If I had to touch feelings </i>

159
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:45,270
<i># I would lose my soul </i>

160
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:48,723
<i># The way I do </i>

161
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:51,977
<i># I don't have to think </i>

162
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:54,980
<i># I only have to do it </i>

163
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:58,650
<i># The results are always perfect </i>

164
00:10:58,652 --> 00:11:01,653
<i># But that's old news </i>

165
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:05,457
<i># Would you like
to hear my voice </i>

166
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:08,159
<i># sprinkled with emotion? </i>

167
00:11:08,212 --> 00:11:10,495
<i>Kurt, he was hyper,</i>

168
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:13,665
<i>full of energy, always busy.</i>

169
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:17,385
<i>You know, jumping off of things,
knocking things over...</i>

170
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:20,555
<i>Anything that had to do
with being a normal child.</i>

171
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:24,175
<i>And Don, he didn't know
how to handle that.</i>

172
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:25,644
He was one of those
kind of people

173
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,813
that just thought that children
should be seen and not heard

174
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:31,182
and shouldn't cause any trouble.

175
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,354
<i>I mean, he belittled and ridiculed Kurt</i>

176
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:39,407
<i>and Kurt would be shamed.</i>

177
00:11:39,443 --> 00:11:43,662
<i># Inside me... </i>

178
00:11:43,697 --> 00:11:48,250
<i>I mean, it really hurt him
to be embarrassed.</i>

179
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:19,564
<i>Then, I don't know.</i>

180
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:22,400
<i>I just...
I started to mature.</i>

181
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:23,902
<i>You know,
I started getting older</i>

182
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:26,788
<i>and kind of looking back at...
Kind of the song...</i>

183
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:30,075
<i>It may have even stirred this in me,
"Is this all there is?"</i>

184
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:31,459
<i>You know, is this my life?</i>

185
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:33,662
<i>I haven't done anything
with my life.</i>

186
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:38,083
In those days,
people didn't get divorced.

187
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:40,719
I mean, I didn't know
anybody that was divorced.

188
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:42,921
You just...
You were in the soup.

189
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:45,173
You didn't think about divorce.

190
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:50,428
<i>Kurt was nine at the time,</i>

191
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,431
<i>and everybody
was talking about it.</i>

192
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:57,936
<i>It just embarrassed
him to death</i>

193
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:00,438
<i>that we had gotten divorced.</i>

194
00:13:03,193 --> 00:13:05,610
<i>He took light bulbs
out of all the lights</i>

195
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:07,912
and would lock the babysitter in,
came outside

196
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:11,783
and just became really unruly.

197
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:15,837
<i>And I said,
"This is not going to happen anymore."</i>

198
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:19,457
<i>And so I took him over
to his dad's house.</i>

199
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:24,295
She couldn't handle him...

200
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:27,932
So I took him.

201
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:31,603
I liked it, really,
you know, having him,

202
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:33,772
him and I together like that.

203
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:35,178
Don Cobain
Kurt's father

204
00:13:35,242 --> 00:13:37,308
<i>And I think there's one thing
that I said at one time,</i>

205
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:40,378
that I was never gonna
get married again.

206
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:44,149
And I think he took that
for a word.

207
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:48,153
<i>Then I met Jennifer
and we got married,</i>

208
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:50,588
<i>and, you know, he had
a stepbrother and sister</i>

209
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:53,958
<i>and then our son Chad.</i>

210
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:57,579
He wanted to be in a family,
period.

211
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,399
And I felt that
just from the beginning.

212
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:02,550
Jenny Cobain
Kurt's stepmother

213
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:04,536
<i>The game nights that we had,</i>

214
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:06,604
<i>that was really
important to him.</i>

215
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,391
You know, we didn't want to
do it on a Wednesday night.

216
00:14:09,426 --> 00:14:12,343
You know, he'd say,
"Nope, we have to. That's what we..."

217
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:16,481
Just I could feel that he
really liked that time,

218
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:19,150
but he always wanted to win.

219
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:22,070
And if he didn't win,
he was mad.

220
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,274
<i>He wanted to be the most loved,</i>

221
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:30,195
and it just wasn't
the ideal world

222
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:32,864
that he thought
a family should be.

223
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:35,333
<i>So he just decide</i>

224
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:39,170
<i>he wasn't going to do
anything anybody said.</i>

225
00:14:39,206 --> 00:14:41,840
<i>He'd just lay on the couch
and watch TV,</i>

226
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,876
<i>go down in his room
and play the guitar.</i>

227
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:48,930
And then he started just doing
really mean things to the kids,

228
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:51,850
and then it just got so...

229
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:54,135
I think it was kind of
my fault in a way,

230
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:55,937
because I couldn't
deal with it anymore.

231
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:58,022
<i>And I told Don</i>

232
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:00,191
<i>he's going to have to get out
of the house.</i>

233
00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:06,314
<i>He went to Wendy's
brother's for a while,</i>

234
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:07,899
<i>then with my mom and dad.</i>

235
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:10,235
He lived with them for a while.

236
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:12,704
You know, then come back to us

237
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:15,573
and still have problems.

238
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:18,543
It was like nobody...
After a couple weeks,

239
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:20,211
they wanted him out.

240
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:26,000
<i>I think the sad part
of the whole thing</i>

241
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:29,513
<i>is that Kurt just really
wanted to be with his mom.</i>

242
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:35,868
Monsters from beneath
by Kurt Cobain

243
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:39,898
<i># Underneath the bridge </i>

244

<i># Tarp has sprung a leak </i>

<i># And the animals are trapped </i>

246

<i># They've all become my pets </i>

247
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:57,782
<i># And I'm living off of grass </i>

248
00:15:57,784 --> 00:16:03,788
<i># And the drippings
from my ceiling </i>

249
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,208
<i># It's okay to eat fish </i>

<i># 'Cause they don't have

00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:17,435
<i># Something in the way </i>

<i># Mmm-mmm. </i>

259
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:53,755
<i>He just was in so much pain</i>

260
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:57,225
that he, you know,
took it out on his mom

261
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,310
and took it out on his dad

262
00:16:59,346 --> 00:17:01,429
and took it out
on his siblings.

263
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:03,431
But it's almost like
he didn't...

264
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:06,484
He didn't feel worthy because

265
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,987
he was rejected, basically.

266
00:17:09,022 --> 00:17:12,690
And I don't know how anybody
deals with having

267
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:15,610
your whole family reject you.

268
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,809
<i># Like most babies smell like butter </i>

<i># His smell smelled

<i># He was born scentless and senseless </i>

<i># He was born a scentless apprentice... </i>

272
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,220
Ah!

273
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:51,506
<i>In a community that stresses
macho male sexual stories</i>

274
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,708
<i>as a highlight of all conversation,</i>

275
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,344
<i>I was an underdeveloped,
immature little dude</i>

276
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:59,630
<i>that never got laid and was
constantly razzed.</i>

277
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:02,433
<i>Oh, poor little kid.</i>

278
00:19:02,469 --> 00:19:05,303
<i>It bothered me, probably more
so because I was horny,</i>

279
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:07,772
<i>and frequently had
to make up stories like,</i>

280
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:10,475
<i>"When I went on vacation,
I met this chick</i>

281
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:12,310
<i>and we fucked
and she loved it."</i>

282
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:13,528
<i>Et cetera, et cetera.</i>

283
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:17,532
<i>This typical pubescent problem</i>

284
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,567
<i>was in effect during the
height of my problems</i>

285
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:21,619
<i>with my father and stepmom,</i>

286
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:25,289
<i>you know, the typical wicked
stepmom story.</i>

287
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:27,875
<i>And so I moved
to both grandparents'</i>

288
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:29,911
<i>and four sets
of aunts and uncles</i>

289
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:31,996
<i>and so forth and so on
within the year.</i>

290
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:34,582
<i>And in eighth grade,
my mom had no choice to take me in</i>

291
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:36,217
<i>because my dad packed my stuff</i>

292
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:39,670
<i>and drove me to her house in the
morning and left me there.</i>

293
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:43,141
<i>She was pissed.</i>

294
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:45,843
<i>I accumulated
quite a healthy complex,</i>

295
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:47,729
<i>not to mention a complexion.</i>

296
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:51,983
<i>Then one day I discovered the most
ultimate form of expression ever...</i>

297
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:53,518
<i>Marijuana.</i>

298
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,936
<i>Oh, boy, pot.</i>

299
00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:56,404
<i>I could escape all day long</i>

300
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,856
<i>and not have routine
nervous breakdowns.</i>

301
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,674
<i>Trevor was a guy I hated,
but resorted to becoming friends with</i>

302
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:19,594
<i>because he was the only person
I could get pot from.</i>

303
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:21,629
<i>He was the kingpin.</i>

304

<i>Trevor "Ace" John Dernan...</i>

girl's house after school</i>

307
00:20:29,472 --> 00:20:31,105
<i>and they invited me.</i>

308
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:33,941
<i>We got to the door
and a very fat girl let us in.</i>

309
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:36,144
<i>It wasn't obvious to me
for over an hour</i>

310
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:38,029
<i>that this girl
seemed kind of quiet</i>

311
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:39,564
<i>until one of the guys
pointed out</i>

312
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:42,066
<i>that she was in
a special ed class.</i>

313
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:46,788
<i>I'm sure a lot of kids would call her
a "retard" and some just "slow."</i>

314
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:48,406
<i>And at the time and
still to this day,</i>

315
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:51,375
<i>I would call her "quiet and illiterate",
but not retarded.</i>

316
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:54,745
<i>The object of the guys
who'd been going there</i>

317
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:56,414
<i>for the past month
was to steal booze</i>

318
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:59,634
<i>from the downstairs
basement den of her house.</i>

319
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:01,419
<i>While others distracted her,</i>

320
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:02,970
<i>one would go down
and take a fifth</i>

321
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:04,672
<i>and then exit out
the downstairs.</i>

322
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:08,559
<i>So we did this routine
every other day</i>

323
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:11,762
<i>and got away with it for,
oh, about a month.</i>

324
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:13,598
<i>And during that month</i>

325
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,602
<i>happened to be the epitome of my
mental abuse from my mother.</i>

326
00:21:17,604 --> 00:21:19,604
<i>It turned out that pot
didn't help me</i>

327
00:21:19,656 --> 00:21:21,439
<i>escape my troubles
too well anymore</i>

328
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,658
<i>and I was actually enjoying
doing rebellious things</i>

329
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:26,861
<i>like stealing booze
and busting store windows.</i>

330
00:21:26,913 --> 00:21:28,162
<i>And nothing ever mattered.</i>

331
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:29,947
<i>I decided within
the next month,</i>

332
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:31,999
<i>I'll not sit on my roof
and think about jumping,</i>

333
00:21:32,035 --> 00:21:33,501
<i>but I'll actually kill myself.</i>

334
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:35,036
<i>And I wasn't going
out of this worl</i>

335
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:38,122
<i>without actually knowing
what it was like to get laid.</i>

336
00:21:41,694 --> 00:21:45,096
<i>So one day after school,
I went to the girl's house alone</i>

337
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:46,197
<i>and invited myself in.</i>

338
00:21:46,232 --> 00:21:47,698
<i>And she offered me
some Twinkies,</i>

339
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:50,801
<i>and I sat on her lap and I said,
"Let's fuck."</i>

340
00:21:50,837 --> 00:21:52,970
<i>And I touched her tits
and she went into her bedroom</i>

341
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:54,972
<i>and got undressed
in front of me.</i>

342
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:57,608
<i>And I watched and realized
that it was actually happening.</i>

343
00:21:57,644 --> 00:21:59,510
<i>So I tried to fuck her,
but didn't know how,</i>

344
00:21:59,546 --> 00:22:01,913
<i>and asked her if she had
ever done this before.</i>

345
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:05,149
<i>And she said a lot of times,
mainly with her cousin.</i>

346
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:09,387
<i>I got grossed out very heavily with how her
vagina smelled when her sweat reeked,</i>

347
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:11,355
<i>so I left.</i>

348
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:13,624
<i>My conscience grew to where I
couldn't go to school for a week.</i>

349
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,761
<i>And when I went back,
I got in-house suspension for skipping.</i>

350
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:18,462
<i>And that day,
the girl's father came in,</i>

351
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:22,934
<i>screaming and accusing someone of
taking advantage of his daughter.</i>

352
00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:25,036
<i>And so during lunch,
a rumor started,</i>

353
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:27,438
<i>and by the next day,
everyone was waiting for me,</i>

354
00:22:27,473 --> 00:22:28,940
<i>to yell and cuss
and spit at me,</i>

355
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:31,275
<i>calling me
"the retard fucker."</i>

356
00:22:33,012 --> 00:22:34,979
<i>I couldn't handle the ridicule,</i>

357
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:37,014
<i>so I got high and drunk
and walked down</i>

358
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,783
<i>to the train tracks
and laid down</i>

359
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:41,052
<i>and put two big pieces of
cement on my chest and legs,</i>

360
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:43,854
<i>and I waited
for the 11:00 train.</i>

361
00:22:45,124 --> 00:22:47,558
<i>The train came closer
and closer and closer,</i>

362
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:50,077
<i>and it went on the
next track besides me</i>

363
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:51,946
<i>instead of over me.</i>

364
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,918
<i>The tension from school
had an effect on me.</i>

365
00:22:56,953 --> 00:22:59,620
<i>And the train scared me enough
to try to rehabilitate myself,</i>

366
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:01,372
<i>and my...
My lifting weights</i>

367
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:04,041
<i>and mathematics
seemed to be improving,</i>

368
00:23:04,043 --> 00:23:05,710
<i>so I became less manically depresse</i>

369
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:09,013
<i>but still never had
any friends because I...</i>

370
00:23:09,048 --> 00:23:12,600
<i>I hated everyone,
for they were so phony.</i>

371
00:23:35,325 --> 00:23:37,041
<i>When Kurt was about 15,</i>

372
00:23:37,076 --> 00:23:39,126
<i>he moved back in with Mom and I,</i>

373
00:23:39,162 --> 00:23:40,578
<i>and it was a struggle.</i>

374
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,164
<i>You know,
it was still him wanting to rebel</i>

375
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:46,584
and getting stoned and going
out with his friends,

376
00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:49,136
and not wanting to,
you know, do chores,

377
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:52,390
and, you know,
he was always wanting

378
00:23:52,425 --> 00:23:54,425
to, like,
just do his own thing.

379
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:55,948
<font color=#00FFFF>Kim Cobain</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Kurt's sister</font>

380
00:23:55,983 --> 00:23:58,062
<i>He wanted normalcy...
He wanted the mom, the dad,</i>

381
00:23:58,097 --> 00:23:59,864
<i>and the kids and everything happy.</i>

382
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:02,099
But then he didn't,

383
00:24:02,135 --> 00:24:04,635
'cause he kind of fought
against it.

384
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:07,204
So he fought against
what he really wanted.

385
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,156
<i>Hello?</i>

386
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:11,025
<i>Hello?
- You still there?</i>

387
00:24:11,077 --> 00:24:13,661
<i>Yeah.
- I put you on speakerphone now.</i>

388
00:24:13,696 --> 00:24:14,862
<i>Okay.</i>

389
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:16,364
<i>Are you recording this
or writing it down?</i>

390
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,115
<i>Yeah,
I'm recording and writing.</i>

391
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:20,785
<i>People don't realize</i>

392
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:23,204
<i>where we really came from,
you know?</i>

393
00:24:23,256 --> 00:24:25,706
<i>What an isolated hellhole
it really is.</i>

394
00:24:25,758 --> 00:24:27,508
<i>You know, man,
if the witch burnings</i>

395
00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:30,011
<i>would've been, like, legal,
we'd all be dead now, you know?</i>

396
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:31,712
<i>Fuck, yeah.</i>

397
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:33,798
<i>Did you ever see that movie
"Over the Edge"?</i>

398
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
<i>Yeah!
- I mean, God.</i>

399
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:38,019
<i>That movie had
such an effect on me.</i>

400
00:24:38,054 --> 00:24:41,472
<i>Okay, you guys,
you're to take these home to your parents.</i>

401
00:24:41,524 --> 00:24:44,475
It's to let them know about
a special emergency meeting

402
00:24:44,477 --> 00:24:47,395
to discuss the problems about you people.
<i>- I love that movie.</i>

403
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,647
<i>I always wanted to do that at Monte.
- Me, too.</i>

404
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:51,232
<i>I tried, you know.</i>

405
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:53,150
<i>I wanted to be a vandal</i>

406
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:56,153
<i>and I wanted to hold everyone
captive in the school.</i>

407
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:58,789
Everybody that's ever
messed with me in one room.

408
00:24:58,825 --> 00:25:00,708
That'd be just about
everybody in town.

409
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:03,327
We should go down there and
tell them all to go to hell.

410
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:04,995
Come on!

411
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:12,553
<i>I don't know how many of
us are willing to admit</i>

412
00:25:12,588 --> 00:25:13,971
<i>just how deep in trouble</i>

413
00:25:14,006 --> 00:25:16,590
some of the kids
in this city are.

414
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:24,732
<i>Has anyone ever sat down
and talked to these kids?</i>

415
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:27,184
I talk to them six hours a day
until I'm blue in the face.

416
00:25:27,186 --> 00:25:29,437
I spend more time with your
kids than you people do.

417
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:31,939
<i>You think those kids
are interested in learning?</i>

418
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:34,075
<i>You ought to come in and see
what goes on in the classroom!</i>

419
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:42,616
<i># Won't you believe it?
Just my luck </i>

420
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:45,453
<i># Won't you believe it?
Just my luck... </i>

421
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,291
<i># No recess... </i>

422
00:25:51,377 --> 00:25:55,513
<i># No recess... </i>

423
00:25:55,548 --> 00:25:57,715
<i>Most of the teachers, God...</i>

424
00:25:57,767 --> 00:26:00,468
<i>The last couple of years of
school in the mid-eighties,</i>

425
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,387
<i>there was so much
Reagan propaganda going on.</i>

426
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:05,473
<i>This teacher would
just go off on it.</i>

427
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:07,725
<i>Everything...
- It ruined... Oh!</i>

428
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:10,478
<i>Practice your piano!</i>

429
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,979
You need practice on it!

430
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:14,281
Go to hell!

431
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:17,568
<i>Burn the place to the fucking ground.
- Yeah.</i>

432
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,237
<i># No recess... </i>

433
00:26:21,073 --> 00:26:26,043
<i># No recess... </i>

434
00:26:26,078 --> 00:26:28,963
<i>High school's such
a worthless fucking nothing.</i>

435
00:26:28,998 --> 00:26:30,915
<i>God, what torture, you know?</i>

436
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:34,084
<i>No, I quit the last two months
of school.</i>

437
00:26:34,137 --> 00:26:36,420
<i>I was so withdrawn by that time</i>

438
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:39,089
<i>and I was so antisocial
that I was almost insane.</i>

439
00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:41,475
<i>You know,
I felt so different and so crazy</i>

440
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:42,726
<i>that people just left me alone.</i>

441
00:26:42,762 --> 00:26:46,330
<i># No recess! </i>

442
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:01,278
<i>Did Kurt find the undergroun</i>

443
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,781
<i>or did the underground
find him?</i>

444
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:05,416
<i>I think he went
in search of it,</i>

445
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:07,952
<i>and I think
they found each other.</i>

446
00:27:08,004 --> 00:27:11,505
He was searching
for whatever made him feel

447
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:13,424
like he wasn't alone

448
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:15,626
and that he wasn't
so different.

449
00:27:17,263 --> 00:27:19,513
<i>When did you first hear punk rock?</i>

450
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:23,017
<i>You know, I wanted to hear
punk rock forever.</i>

451
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:26,554
<i>Of course, they didn't have it
in our record shop in Aberdeen.</i>

452
00:27:26,606 --> 00:27:28,472
<i>Then, finally, Buzz Osborne,</i>

453
00:27:28,474 --> 00:27:30,307
<i>who had been a friend
of mine off and on,</i>

454
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:32,309
<i>made me a couple
compilation tapes.</i>

455
00:27:34,864 --> 00:27:39,066
<i>And I was completely
blown away.</i>

456
00:27:39,118 --> 00:27:41,902
<i>I would lip-sync to those
tapes and I wore them out,</i>

457
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:44,488
<i>and I'd play them every day,
you know?</i>

458
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,290
<i>It's the greatest thing.</i>

459
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:50,878
<i>It expressed the way I felt
socially and politically,</i>

460
00:27:50,913 --> 00:27:53,664
<i>and it was the anger
that I felt,</i>

461
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:55,833
<i>the alienation.</i>

462
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:00,671
<i>And I realized that
this is what</i>

463
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:02,723
<i>I've always wanted to do.</i>

464
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,485
<i># Fill me in on your new vision </i>

465
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,521
# Wake me up with indecision

466
00:28:17,523 --> 00:28:20,357
# Help me trust
your mighty wisdom...

467
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:24,495
<i># I'm new, I'm new,
I'm who, I'm you </i>

468
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:28,749
<i>Just the fact that we were</i>

469
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:32,620
<i>actually playing music live in a room,
it was amazing.</i>

470
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:35,256
<i>It was, like, the most incredible
thing I've ever done.</i>

471
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:39,043
# Easy in an easy chair

472
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:41,845
# Poop as hard as rock

473
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:45,182
<i># I don't like you anyway </i>

474
00:28:46,102 --> 00:28:47,685
<i># Seal it in a box... </i>

475
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:53,190
<i>If we played
together in the house</i>

476
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:55,776
<i>for a couple of hours
and if two people stopped by,</i>

477
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:58,562
<i>we considered that a gig,
you know, a show.</i>

478
00:28:58,614 --> 00:28:59,730
<i>That was good enough.</i>

479
00:28:59,782 --> 00:29:01,949
<i>We had an audience of two people,
you know?</i>

480
00:29:01,984 --> 00:29:05,869
<i>Locals who hated our guts and
thought it was terrible music.</i>

481
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:21,885
I think I was 18 or 19 years old,
and Kurt was like 17.

482
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:24,588
But he liked punk rock music,

483
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,099
and so that piqued my interest.

485
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:30,227
<i>And then I noticed
what a good artist he was.</i>

486
00:29:30,262 --> 00:29:33,797
<i>And so he was working
at the time as a janitor,</i>

487
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,850
but he'd always have to,
like, do some kind of art,

488
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:39,269
you know,
usually defacing something.

489
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:41,605
He never had, like, idle hands.

490
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,775
It just came out of him.
He had to express himself.

491
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:48,612
<i>"Heavy Metal", take three.</i>

492
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:52,166
<i>Well, who taught you how
to play guitar anyway?</i>

493
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,794
<i>All right.</i>

494
00:30:21,731 --> 00:30:22,813
<i>Brilliant.</i>

495
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:24,481
<i>Brilliant improvisational.</i>

496
00:30:24,483 --> 00:30:27,151
<i>Wow, Jerry Garcia would really
like this.</i>

497
00:30:27,153 --> 00:30:29,036
<i>I'm gonna send him a tape.
- Send it to Jerry.</i>

498
00:30:29,071 --> 00:30:32,156
<i>I'll just have to sprinkle
it with patchouli or something.</i>

499
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:33,824
<i>Dig right into it.</i>

500
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:42,916

<i>He really didn't want to
live with his mom or his dad.</i>

521
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:47,007
<i>He wanted to be on his own.
And at that time...</i>

522
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:49,626
<i>So he moves into this dump.</i>

523
00:32:49,628 --> 00:32:51,211
<i>He wasn't making
a lot of money,</i>

524
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:53,297
<i>and I think he was scared,</i>

<i>not being able
to pay his own way.</i>

526
00:32:55,301 --> 00:32:56,717
<i>He didn't know what he
was going to do.</i>

527
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:58,519
<i>And in the hallway
outside the apartment,</i>

528
00:32:58,554 --> 00:33:01,138
<i>it was completely graffitie</i>

<i>with Scooby-Doo,

531
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:08,946
<i>There was just no way
he was going to be</i>

532
00:33:08,981 --> 00:33:11,198
<i>the 9:00-to-5:00 work guy

<i>with a briefcase

534
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,485
<i>I mean, this just wasn't ever
going to happen.</i>

535
00:33:15,487 --> 00:33:17,955
<i>But he wanted some type
of connection.</i>

536
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,374
<i>This is love.
- This is love.</i>

537
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:22,826
<i>This is shitting, pissing,
fucking all over each other,</i>

<i>licking and spitting up

<i>'cause, baby, this is love.</i>

541
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:37,007
Well, I know some people
will say that...

542
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:39,676
That I treated Kurt maternally,
took care of him,

543
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:41,762
but I'd like to think it was
more I was trying to nurture him

544
00:33:41,814 --> 00:33:43,347
rather than take care of him.

545
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:45,766
Tried to nurture who he was
and get him to...

546
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:48,151
Let him do his art,
let him do his music

547
00:33:48,187 --> 00:33:49,736
and encourage him
to get better at it

548
00:33:49,772 --> 00:33:51,605
as opposed to trying
to stifle it.

549
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:54,107
But also not try to be the mom,

550
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,083
but trying to be
a nurturing girlfriend...

551
00:33:56,779 --> 00:33:58,075
or friend.

<i>We met at a party,
and, you know, I liked him.</i>

554
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:06,003
<i>I had a crush on him.</i>

555
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:07,838
And then finally
somebody told him,

556
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:09,506
"Don't you get that she
likes you or something?"

557
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,508
'Cause he was just kind of
clueless about it, you know?

558
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:19,016
<i>Hey!</i>

559
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,472
<i>I liked that he was funny.
- He made me laugh.</i>

560
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:28,976
<i>He wasn't afraid to be,
you know, goofy or silly.</i>

561
00:34:29,028 --> 00:34:33,230
<i>But mostly we just had
a good time hanging out.</i>

562
00:34:35,067 --> 00:34:36,650
<i>I think he might
have been a bit angry</i>

563
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:38,535
<i>at the way he was
treated at school</i>

564
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,955
<i>and angry with his mom
and with his dad.</i>

565
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:47,461
<i>I think it was not so much it was
hard for him to accept love,</i>

566
00:34:47,496 --> 00:34:50,914
<i>but the fact that maybe he
was afraid of getting hurt.</i>

567
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:55,385
<i>He was living at this tiny
little house in Aberdeen.</i>

568
00:34:55,421 --> 00:34:57,638
<i>I just said,
"Why don't you just move in with me</i>

569
00:34:57,673 --> 00:34:59,506
<i>and be in Olympia?"</i>

570
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:01,758
<i>So we moved in together.</i>

571
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:05,646
<i>It was nice to have
someone to share</i>

572
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:07,981
<i>the evening with
as well as the daytime.</i>

573
00:35:08,017 --> 00:35:10,734
Sitting on the couch at the same time,
each reading a book.

574
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:12,602
It was just...
You kind of felt grown-up

575
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:15,388
as opposed to just being still,
you know, a teenager.

576
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,268
KURT:
I decided this worning (again)

577
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,247
that I LOVE you LOTS+
Am so happy you love me to.

578

Tracy

579
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:24,632
I LOVE YOU

580
00:35:30,486 --> 00:35:32,243
Don't read my diary when I'm gone

581
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,836
when you wake up, please read
my diary.

582
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:37,986
Look trought my things,

583
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:44,468
<i>I'd like to think he was happy.</i>

584
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,303
<i>We were very much in love
with each other.</i>

585
00:35:46,305 --> 00:35:48,855
<i>And I decided I'd just try
to support him</i>

586
00:35:48,891 --> 00:35:51,108
because he wanted
to be a musician,

587
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:53,026
he wanted to, you know,
get his band going.

588
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:54,311
He was ambitious.

589
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:55,612
He didn't want to just be...

590
00:35:55,647 --> 00:35:58,198
Play in a bar band, you know,
and play music that way.

591
00:35:58,233 --> 00:36:00,150
He wanted to be a success.

592
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,486
Good luck. Good luck. Good luck.

00:37:17,563 --> 00:37:21,064
<i># Oh, I was shamed </i>

606
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:25,735
<i># I was shamed. </i>

607
00:37:45,757 --> 00:37:48,258
<i>Hey, thanks, everybody,
for coming.</i>

608
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,352
<i>Yeah!</i>

609
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:10,247
<i>When I met him,
he was a handyman</i>

610
00:38:10,282 --> 00:38:12,782
<i>and then,
he got a job as a janitor</i>

611
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:14,701
<i>cleaning, like, you know,
doctors' offices</i>

612
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:16,920
<i>and dentists' offices
and things like that.</i>

613
00:38:16,955 --> 00:38:20,290
But, yeah, he just ended up
not having another job

614
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,626
after that, so...

615
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:24,878
<i>So, who would support him?</i>

616
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,463
Me.

617
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:30,350
<i>And what would he do all
day while you were at work?</i>

618
00:38:30,385 --> 00:38:32,185
It was kinda funny,
'cause sometimes

619
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:33,687
he'd just sit there
and watch TV for four hours.

620
00:38:33,722 --> 00:38:35,522
And you'd think
he wasn't creating,

621
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:37,974
but he'd be playing guitar while he was
doing that or think up stuff later,

622
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:40,310
and then you'd go out for a few hours,
and you'd come back,

623
00:38:40,312 --> 00:38:41,478
and there was
a painting on the wall,

624
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,864
or there was a big comic
strip or whatever.

625
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:46,733
He wrote a song.
You know, recorded it.

626
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:53,156
<i>...finds them arriving at this scene...</i>

627
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:57,043
<i>This is like fucking rad,
you know?</i>

628
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:01,831
<i>Cool.</i>

629
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:04,885
<i>Where's the...</i>

630
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:16,263
# Hey, a girl,
she could bring me

631
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:20,100
# I can be more,
she could be free

632
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:23,737
# I don't even care,
we could be on free

633
00:39:23,772 --> 00:39:27,073
# She said, she said...

634
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,361
Babies on my cold feet,

635
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:33,747
at the end of my bed.

636
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:38,501
It is easy.

637
00:39:38,537 --> 00:39:40,420
Shh, they're in the house.

638
00:39:40,455 --> 00:39:42,088
They're in the house.

639
00:39:42,124 --> 00:39:44,007
Some highlights follow,

640
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:47,844
but we warn that viewers may find
parts of the footage disturbing.

641
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:49,346
<i>The object of the exercise</i>

642
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:52,382
<i>is to observe the monster
for as long as possible.</i>

643
00:39:52,384 --> 00:39:56,019
<i># Think I'll go for a walk
outside now </i>

644

<i># The summer sun's
calling my name... </i>

645
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,856
<i>It is sucking dry</i>

646
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,608
<i>all the resin from the bong water...</i>

647
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:03,526
<i># I hear you now </i>

648
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:06,396
<i># I just can't stay inside all day...
</i>

649
00:40:06,398 --> 00:40:08,031
<i>A person who is success-minde</i>

650
00:40:08,066 --> 00:40:10,367
<i>has a success consciousness...</i>

651

<i>...and success awareness...
- # Everybody's smiling </i>

<i># Into the sunshine... </i>

653
00:40:16,074 --> 00:40:18,541
Why is that so groovy?

654
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:22,746
<i># She could have soared

655

<i># She could evolve

656
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:30,754
<i># She could have been a son </i>

657
00:40:30,756 --> 00:40:34,591
<i># She could have sung a song </i>

658
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:36,559
<i># She could have </i>

659

<i># Sung a song... </i>

660
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:46,486
Hello?

661
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:48,355
No, she's not.

662
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:50,323
She went to work.

663
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:52,993
All right.

664
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,496
<i># She could have </i>

00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:00,950
Bass part.

667
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:12,629
# You can't change me

668
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:17,300
# Change me

<i>Now don't think about

That's it.

714
00:44:33,548 --> 00:44:35,832
This note... and this note.

<i>Look at these losers.

724
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,397
<i>A bunch of long-haired

726
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:51,074
<i>I caught Nirvana

<i>on their recent tour.</i>

728
00:45:53,244 --> 00:45:55,244
<i>At what point are you
on this tour right now?</i>

729
00:45:55,246 --> 00:45:58,548
<i>We're at the point
of kicking each other's ass.</i>

730
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:02,085
<i>I would imagine that the
constant party atmosphere on the road</i>

731
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:04,220
<i>would create a great deal
of physical and mental stress.</i>

732
00:46:04,255 --> 00:46:06,172
<i>How do you deal with it?</i>

733
00:46:06,224 --> 00:46:07,974
<i>We've prepared for the
rock 'n' roll lifestyle.</i>

734
00:46:08,009 --> 00:46:09,425
<i>We can kick it, man.</i>

735
00:46:09,477 --> 00:46:10,893
<i>You know what?</i>

736
00:46:10,929 --> 00:46:12,762
<i>We should move in our stuff
before it starts raining.</i>

737
00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:14,147
Yeah.

738
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:18,985
<i>100% humidity here
in Fort Worth, Texas.</i>

739
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,820
<i>...um, just excessive
or frightening?</i>

740
00:46:20,855 --> 00:46:23,272
<i>Go in the van.
- Hey, whoo!</i>

741
00:46:23,274 --> 00:46:26,693
<i>No, because we actually want
to become more successful</i>

742
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:28,778
<i>so we can have
a comfortable life.</i>

743
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,447
<i>Neato.</i>

744
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:35,952
<i>Okay, man, take it away, buddy.
- Don't worry about me.</i>

745
00:46:35,954 --> 00:46:38,921
<i>I know this is kind of a strange angle,
but it'll work.</i>

746
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:42,959
Yes.

747
00:46:42,961 --> 00:46:46,462
That's a big camera, man.
That's not your...

748
00:46:46,464 --> 00:46:49,966
<i>How would you describe the
music you play and the things you do?</i>

749
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:53,686
Well, the things we do
is just we play

750
00:46:53,722 --> 00:46:57,523
a very powerful, high-energy type
of rock 'n' roll.

751
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:58,975
We move around onstage a lot

752
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:04,781
and just scream with an abandon,
I guess.

753
00:47:04,816 --> 00:47:06,983
<i>What makes you
want to be Nirvana?</i>

754
00:47:06,985 --> 00:47:09,318
What makes us
want to be Nirvana?

755
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,456
We're Nirvana because we're not
Aerosmith or something

756
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:16,993
or "The Vegetables" or...

757
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:20,380
<i>What's the future of Nirvana?</i>

758
00:47:20,415 --> 00:47:23,499
The future of Nirvana?
I don't know.

759
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:26,085
Hopefully try to write
some more good songs.

760
00:47:26,137 --> 00:47:28,054
That's all we care about
is writing good music.

761
00:47:28,089 --> 00:47:31,591
If we get popular or not,
it doesn't matter.

762
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:34,143
The music's more important.

763
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:38,147
<i>...one song, and it's the last one.</i>

764
00:48:01,506 --> 00:48:04,674
# Would you believe me
if I told you

765
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:07,760
# You're the queen
of my heart?

766
00:48:07,796 --> 00:48:10,713
# Please don't deceive me
when I hurt you

767
00:48:10,715 --> 00:48:13,716
# Just ain't the way you seem

768
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:27,447
# Can you feel my love buzz?

769
00:48:59,814 --> 00:49:02,064
<i>Whoo!</i>

770
00:49:16,364 --> 00:49:20,583
<i>I remember the first
review Nirvana ever got</i>

771
00:49:20,618 --> 00:49:24,287
<i>was for "The Love Buzz/Big Cheese"
single we did.</i>

772
00:49:24,289 --> 00:49:27,290
And it was in this hip
magazine out of Michigan

773
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:30,593
these scenesters were doing,
and they gave us a bad review,

774
00:49:30,628 --> 00:49:33,796
and they said it was like Lynyrd Skynyrd,
but without the flares.

775
00:49:33,848 --> 00:49:37,550
Kurt was really hurt with that,
and he was telling me that.

776
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:40,303
He goes... And I'd said,
"Don't worry about it.

777
00:49:40,305 --> 00:49:42,939
They're just scenesters.
They're hipsters."

778
00:49:42,974 --> 00:49:45,641
Or, you know,
"Screw them" or whatever.

779
00:49:45,643 --> 00:49:47,310
But, you know,

780
00:49:47,312 --> 00:49:49,812
Kurt hated being humiliated.

781
00:49:49,864 --> 00:49:52,899
He hated it.

782
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:55,201
If he ever thought
he was humiliated,

783
00:49:55,236 --> 00:49:58,738
then you'd see
the rage come out.

784
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:02,658
And so he was also
very careful and stubborn

785
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,495
about how the way the art
and the work was presented,

786
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:07,997
because he didn't want
to be humiliated.

787
00:50:08,049 --> 00:50:11,834
I can be humiliated or, like,
humiliate myself or whatever,

788
00:50:11,836 --> 00:50:15,004
but not Kurt, no.

789
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,433
<i>He had really
violent dreams a lot.</i>

790
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:29,185
People would be breaking
into his house,

791
00:50:29,187 --> 00:50:31,103
trying to kill him,
and he'd have to stab them.

792
00:50:31,155 --> 00:50:33,773
I mean once in a while,
it might be his family who was trying to kill him,

793
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:35,441
but that was just really rare.

794
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:39,161
Usually it was someone else coming
after him that he didn't know.

795
00:50:39,197 --> 00:50:42,114
I asked... I thought he should
try to talk to someone,

796
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:45,868
but without much money,
that really wasn't going to happen.

797
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:52,508
<i>Kurt would get
stomachaches a lot</i>

798
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,927
<i>and say his stomach hurt.</i>

799
00:50:54,963 --> 00:50:57,713
<i>You know, he'd be feeling fine,
and then he'd get out of the car</i>

800
00:50:57,715 --> 00:51:00,116
<i>and just be like,
"I gotta throw up."</i>

801
00:51:00,151 --> 00:51:01,517
<i>I know he went to the doctor</i>

802
00:51:01,552 --> 00:51:04,553
<i>once or twice,
but it didn't really work.</i>

803
00:51:10,728 --> 00:51:13,229
<i>Most of the time,
it's sitting right in my stomach.</i>

804
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:17,483
<i>Like where my stomach pain is.</i>

805
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:19,068
<i>Every time I've had
an endoscope,</i>

806
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,454
<i>they'd find a red irritation.</i>

807
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,794
<i>I would sing
and cough up blood.</i>

808
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,380
<i>It's like this is no way
to live a life.</i>

809
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:35,501
<i>I love to play music,
but something's not right.</i>

810
00:51:35,553 --> 00:51:38,921
<i>So I decided to medicate myself.</i>

811
00:51:43,698 --> 00:51:45,505
I tried heroine the first time in 1987
in aberdeen and proceeded to

812
00:51:45,864 --> 00:51:47,439
to use it about 10 (more) times
from 87 to 90.

813
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:51,083
For five years every single day
an ongoins stomach eilment had

814
00:51:51,723 --> 00:51:57,306
literally taken me to the point
of won try to kill myself.

815
00:51:57,709 --> 00:52:00,781
The pain became even more
severe due to luck of a proper

816
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:03,843
and rejimented eating schedule

817
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:05,983
and diet.

818
00:52:06,784 --> 00:52:08,417
<i>How much of that
pain would you say</i>

819
00:52:08,453 --> 00:52:11,120
<i>actually fuels what you're
writing and playing?</i>

820
00:52:11,122 --> 00:52:12,455
<i>See, that's a scary question,</i>

821
00:52:12,507 --> 00:52:17,093
<i>because I think it probably helps,
you know?</i>

822
00:52:17,128 --> 00:52:21,097
<i>But I would give up everything
to have good health.</i>

823
00:52:21,132 --> 00:52:23,883
<i>But then again,
I'm always afraid</i>

824
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,019
<i>that if I lost the stomach problem,</i>

825
00:52:27,055 --> 00:52:29,472
<i>I might not be as creative.</i>

826
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,777
<i>There's a journal entry where
Kurt mentions</i>

827
00:52:34,812 --> 00:52:39,198
<i>#oing heroin for the first time in
1987 when he was living with you.</i>

828
00:52:39,233 --> 00:52:40,649
See, he never told me that.

829
00:52:40,651 --> 00:52:42,151
He totally had kept that from me,

830
00:52:42,153 --> 00:52:43,736
because I totally would have
talked him out of it.

831
00:52:43,788 --> 00:52:45,738
In fact, he used to make fun
of some of the people

832
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,873
in Seattle that were using that

833
00:52:47,909 --> 00:52:49,575
and say it was really stupid.

834
00:52:49,627 --> 00:52:52,828
Because I've been told before that
he was doing it when we were dating,

835
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:56,499
but I'm like,
"He didn't do it around me, ever."

836
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:58,977
I never found anything, so...

837
00:53:00,961 --> 00:53:03,112
... I'm so so sorry You're sick.
I hope you feel better

838
00:53:03,592 --> 00:53:05,544
soon start eating good.

839
00:53:08,346 --> 00:53:10,346
<i>I can't really say
exactly why we broke up.</i>

840
00:53:10,348 --> 00:53:12,064
<i>I just know that we were
fighting more</i>

841
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,818
<i>and he was staying away
from the house more.</i>

842
00:53:15,853 --> 00:53:17,820
I think he just pretty much

843
00:53:17,855 --> 00:53:19,438
didn't love me
as much as he used to

844
00:53:19,524 --> 00:53:21,774
or felt...
He just felt like maybe

845
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:23,909
he was moving ahead
and I wasn't.

846
00:53:31,969 --> 00:53:34,136
Kurt Cobain's here.

847
00:53:34,172 --> 00:53:36,906
You know,
Kurt Cobain from Aberdeen?

848
00:53:38,476 --> 00:53:41,577
What's going on, baby?
- Not a damn thing.

849
00:53:41,612 --> 00:53:44,180
You called up and said,
"I want to play some songs."

850
00:53:44,215 --> 00:53:46,749
So I said, "Rockin' good news."
- This is the truth.

851
00:53:46,784 --> 00:53:49,185
"Bloody brilliant."

852
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,121
Um, I just wrote most of
the lyrics this evening.

853
00:53:52,156 --> 00:53:53,522
In the car on the way up here?

854
00:53:53,558 --> 00:53:55,491
While I was driving
with one foot.

855
00:53:55,526 --> 00:53:56,959
Uh-huh.

856
00:53:56,994 --> 00:53:59,061
Um, yeah, that's what I did,

857
00:53:59,096 --> 00:54:01,897
and I just thought I would
just come here, say hi.

858
00:54:01,933 --> 00:54:02,982
Well, let her rip.

859
00:54:06,904 --> 00:54:08,871
<i>Okay, is there any major
label interest</i>

860
00:54:08,906 --> 00:54:10,122
<i>in you at the present?</i>

861
00:54:10,158 --> 00:54:11,657
<i>Can you say?</i>

862
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:13,876
<i>Anybody not affiliated with CBS.</i>

863
00:54:13,911 --> 00:54:15,661
<i>Would you consider changing?</i>

864
00:54:15,713 --> 00:54:17,213
<i>We're considering AMA</i>

865
00:54:17,248 --> 00:54:20,166
<i>because we want to get
as much as we can.</i>

866
00:54:21,836 --> 00:54:23,586
<i>But you're sort of
this interesting mix of...</i>

867
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:26,005
<i>As you say, you're one of
the laziest people you know,</i>

868
00:54:26,057 --> 00:54:28,591
<i>but you're also ambitious
for a lazy person.</i>

869
00:54:28,643 --> 00:54:30,559
<i>You think so?</i>

870
00:54:33,598 --> 00:54:36,015
<i>How does it feel to be surrounded
by so many people</i>

871
00:54:36,067 --> 00:54:39,068
<i>that are telling you that you'll
soon be doing very well?</i>

872
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:43,272
<i>I think it's embarrassing
to have so many expectations</i>

873
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:46,108
<i>and a totally superficial label
to put on a ban</i>

874
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,828
<i>to state that
they're the next big thing,</i>

875
00:54:48,863 --> 00:54:51,197
<i>because, you know,
that's not our goal in the first place.</i>

876
00:54:51,249 --> 00:54:53,282
<i>People are putting
that tag on us</i>

877
00:54:53,334 --> 00:54:56,118
<i>without us really wanting to do that,
you know?</i>

878
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,920
<i>You're not prepared for that?</i>

879
00:54:57,955 --> 00:54:59,455
<i>Not prepared? Nope.</i>

880
00:54:59,507 --> 00:55:00,873
<i>Because we're not going to be.</i>

881
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:04,960
<i>We're prepared to destroy
our careers if it happens.</i>

882
00:55:08,382 --> 00:55:10,132
<i># I'm so happy </i>

883
00:55:10,134 --> 00:55:13,969
<i># 'Cause today I found my friends </i>

884
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:15,971
<i># They're in my head </i>

885
00:55:16,023 --> 00:55:18,140
<i># I'm so ugly </i>

886
00:55:18,142 --> 00:55:21,527
<i># That's okay,
'cause so are you </i>

887
00:55:21,562 --> 00:55:23,779
<i># We broke our mirrors </i>

888
00:55:23,814 --> 00:55:27,149
<i># Sunday morning is every day </i>

889
00:55:27,151 --> 00:55:31,570
<i># For all I care
and I'm not scared </i>

890
00:55:31,622 --> 00:55:35,324
<i># Light my candles in a daze </i>

891
00:55:35,326 --> 00:55:37,159
<i># 'Cause I found God </i>

892
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:40,129
<i># Yeah, yeah </i>

893
00:55:40,998 --> 00:55:47,670
<i># Yeah, yeah </i>

894
00:55:48,839 --> 00:56:00,649
<i># Yeah, yeah </i>

895
00:56:00,685 --> 00:56:02,851
<i># Yeah </i>

896
00:56:02,904 --> 00:56:04,653
<i># I'm so lonely </i>

897
00:56:04,689 --> 00:56:08,524
<i># That's okay,
I shaved my head </i>

898
00:56:08,576 --> 00:56:10,492
<i># And I'm not sad </i>

899
00:56:10,528 --> 00:56:14,079
<i># And just maybe I'm to blame </i>

900
00:56:14,115 --> 00:56:18,367
<i># For all I've heard,
but I'm not sure </i>

901
00:56:18,419 --> 00:56:20,035
<i># I'm so excited... </i>

902
00:56:20,121 --> 00:56:23,088
I am Kurt.
I play guitar and I sing.

903
00:56:23,124 --> 00:56:25,257
And I am Dave,
and I play drums,

904
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:27,376
and I sing sometimes,
but not that often.

905
00:56:27,428 --> 00:56:31,513
I'm Krist, and I play bass
and I don't sing, thank God.

906
00:56:31,549 --> 00:56:35,134
# Yeah, yeah

907
00:56:35,186 --> 00:56:37,519
<i># Yeah... </i>

908
00:56:37,555 --> 00:56:39,688
<i>All right, Nirvana's joined us
in the studio tonight.</i>

909
00:56:39,724 --> 00:56:41,106
<i>A new music hour.</i>

910
00:56:41,142 --> 00:56:44,526
<i>We got Krist Novoselic,
got Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl.</i>

<i>Their upcoming release
"Nevermind"</i>

912
00:56:46,647 --> 00:56:48,564
<i>comes out the 24th
of this month.</i>

913
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:50,399
<i>And you guys will be doing
an in-store</i>

914
00:56:50,451 --> 00:56:53,235
<i>by the Beehive Music & Video
on University District.</i>

915
00:56:53,237 --> 00:56:56,905
<i>So go out and meet the band.
That's at 7:00 to 9:00.</i>

916
00:56:56,958 --> 00:57:00,876
# I like it, I'm not gonna crack

917
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:04,830
<i># I miss you,
I'm not gonna crack </i>

918
00:57:04,882 --> 00:57:08,667
<i># I love you,
I'm not gonna crack </i>

919
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,504
<i># I killed you,
I'm not gonna crack </i>

920
00:57:12,556 --> 00:57:16,425
<i># I like it,
I'm not gonna crack </i>

921
00:57:16,477 --> 00:57:19,928
<i># I'll miss you, I'm not gonna crack </i>

922
00:57:19,981 --> 00:57:24,266
<i># I love you, I'm not gonna crack </i>

923
00:57:24,268 --> 00:57:32,608
# I killed you, I'm not gonna crack.

924
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,500
<i>End of July or August,</i>

925
00:57:41,535 --> 00:57:43,452
<i>he's home.</i>

926
00:57:43,504 --> 00:57:46,872
And he comes downstairs and he's
in his little whitey-tighties,

927
00:57:46,924 --> 00:57:48,123
no shirt, barefoot,

928
00:57:48,175 --> 00:57:51,093
no pants other than his undies,

929
00:57:51,128 --> 00:57:53,128
and, uh...
Very Don Cobain.

930
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:54,797
That's another thing
I got sick of looking at.

931
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:56,715
And he's standing there
with this tape in his hand.

932
00:57:56,767 --> 00:57:58,100
I go, "What's that?"

933
00:57:58,135 --> 00:58:00,886
And he goes,
"It's the master cut to my new album.

934
00:58:00,938 --> 00:58:02,638
Can I put it on the stereo?"

935
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,807
And I go,
"Yeah. And turn it up! Up, up, up!"

936
00:58:04,809 --> 00:58:06,859
'Cause I listen to music really loud.

937
00:58:06,894 --> 00:58:10,529
And I look at him and I go,
"Oh, my God."

938
00:58:10,564 --> 00:58:12,865
"Oh, my God."
And I almost started crying.

939
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,151
I mean, not from happiness,
from fear.

940
00:58:16,203 --> 00:58:18,120
It was fear.

941
00:58:18,155 --> 00:58:20,989
And I just went,

942
00:58:20,991 --> 00:58:25,544
"This is going
to change everything."

943
00:58:25,579 --> 00:58:30,049
And I said,
"You better buckle up,

944
00:58:30,084 --> 00:58:32,835
'cause you are not ready for this."

945
00:58:41,345 --> 00:58:44,229
<i>For someone like yourself,
when you're sort of...</i>

946
00:58:44,265 --> 00:58:45,848
<i>Say your dreams come true,</i>

947
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,984
<i>all the worst aspects of them
come true as well.</i>

948
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:50,986
<i>It's like, be careful
what you wish for.</i>

949
00:58:51,021 --> 00:58:52,404
<i>You're gonna get it.</i>

950
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,989
<i>Yeah.</i>

951
00:58:54,024 --> 00:58:57,826
<i>How are you sort of
dealing with the pull-apart?</i>

952
00:58:57,862 --> 00:59:01,530
<i>You know, being pulled apart
by stuff like that?</i>

953
00:59:01,582 --> 00:59:04,333
<i>I don't know if I expressed
that the right way.</i>

954
00:59:04,368 --> 00:59:08,537
<i>Well, um...</i>

955
00:59:14,795 --> 00:59:19,348
<i># Load up on guns </i>

956
00:59:19,383 --> 00:59:21,934
<i># Bring your friends </i>

959
00:59:32,363 --> 00:59:35,781
<i># And self-assured </i>

00:59:35,816 --> 00:59:39,701

<i># With the lights out </i>

965
01:00:05,846 --> 01:00:09,481
<i># It's less dangerous </i>

966
01:00:09,517 --> 01:00:13,068
<i># Here we are now </i>

967
01:00:13,103 --> 01:00:16,438

968
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:19,992
<i># I feel stupid </i>

969
01:00:20,027 --> 01:00:23,579
<i># And contagious </i>

01:00:23,614 --> 01:00:27,115
<i># Here we are now </i>

971
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:30,702

<i># A denial. </i>

978
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:19,501
<i>Cool, and cut!</i>

979
01:01:19,553 --> 01:01:21,887
<i>Cut.
- Let's wrap!</i>

980
01:01:33,317 --> 01:01:34,600
Hey, man!

981
01:01:34,652 --> 01:01:39,605
If this bird goes down,
this is the safest place to be...

982
01:01:39,657 --> 01:01:44,359
Right in the tail
where the bathroom is.

983
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:46,662
<i>As soon you
walked on this plane,</i>

984
01:01:46,697 --> 01:01:50,165
<i>I took one gander at you
and I saw nothing but trouble.</i>

985
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,584
Hah. Bah!
<i>- Peh!</i>

986
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:54,202
See if you can try and do it.

987
01:01:54,255 --> 01:01:56,538
Me and my sidekick,
"Treefrog Johnson" here,

988
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,373
is gonna rip you
a new butthole.

989
01:01:58,425 --> 01:01:59,791
<i>And is this time our time?</i>

990
01:01:59,843 --> 01:02:01,627
<i>What a sensitive man.</i>

991
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:03,762
<i>'Cause it says it's almost
like 3:00 in the morning.</i>

992
01:02:03,797 --> 01:02:05,597
<i>Time flies when you're having fun.</i>

993

<i># I don't mind, I don't mind,
I don't mind, I don't mind </i>

01:02:38,632 --> 01:02:40,749
<i># Mind, don't have a mind </i>

997

<i># Get away, get away,

998
01:02:44,471 --> 01:02:46,922

<i># I'm afraid, I'm afraid,
I'm afraid </i>

<i># I'm afraid, 'fraid </i>

1001
01:02:51,061 --> 01:02:52,260
# Oh

1002
01:02:52,313 --> 01:02:54,980
# Even if you have,
even if you need

1003

<i># I don't mean to stare,

<i>99 X...</i>

1007
01:03:06,443 --> 01:03:08,410
<i>That Nirvana stuff that y'all
played us last night,</i>

1008
01:03:08,445 --> 01:03:10,996
<i>if I wanted to request one of those songs right now,
could you play it?</i>

1009
01:03:11,031 --> 01:03:13,615
<i>Do y'all have any bootleg CDs of Nirvana?
- Can you play Nirvana?</i>

1010
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:15,917
<i>Can you play that song by Nirvana?
- Can you play some Nirvana?</i>

1011
01:03:15,953 --> 01:03:18,620
Right here,
a world premiere video from Nirvana.

1012
01:03:18,672 --> 01:03:20,539
<i>"Smells Like Teen Spirit."</i>

1013
01:03:20,591 --> 01:03:21,707
<i># Oh </i>

1014
01:03:21,759 --> 01:03:24,710
<i># Even if you have,
even if you need </i>

1015
01:03:24,762 --> 01:03:27,462
# I don't mean to stare,
we don't have to breed...

1016
01:03:27,464 --> 01:03:29,514
They told you the line to say?
- What do we say? This is...

1017
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:32,300
We're Nirvana,
and this is "The Week in Rock."

1018
01:03:32,353 --> 01:03:34,052
# We could have all three,
she said...

1019
01:03:34,104 --> 01:03:36,855
<i>Hey, all you people
staying up late on a Sunday night,</i>

1020
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:38,974
slack off,
you don't need your job!

1021
01:03:39,026 --> 01:03:41,143
Don't say, "Yes, sir",
"Yes, ma'am."

1022
01:03:41,145 --> 01:03:42,894
Say, "Cram it!"

1023
01:03:42,946 --> 01:03:44,696
Don't show up tomorrow,
call in sick.

1024
01:03:44,732 --> 01:03:47,699
And this is Nirvana,
and you're watching...

1025
01:03:47,735 --> 01:03:48,650
"120 Minutes."

1026
01:03:48,702 --> 01:03:49,785
...on...

1027
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,536
M-T-T-V.

1028
01:04:01,131 --> 01:04:02,664
<i># Yeah </i>

1029
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:05,384

01:04:11,341 --> 01:04:14,009
<i># I don't even care,
we can have all three </i>

1033
01:04:14,011 --> 01:04:17,095
<i># She said, she said </i>

1034
01:04:17,147 --> 01:04:20,565
<i># She said, she said,
she said... </i>

1035
01:04:20,601 --> 01:04:23,268
The hottest new rock band in the
country right now may well be Nirvana.

1036
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,153
<i>The hottest band
around at the moment.</i>

1037
01:04:25,189 --> 01:04:27,272
<i>The band that it seems
like everybody's talking about.</i>

1038
01:04:27,324 --> 01:04:29,858
People, like, really seem to be
getting into Nirvana right now.

1039
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:33,078
Do you see when you go out and play shows,
the crowds are getting different?

1040
01:04:33,113 --> 01:04:35,580
<i>I mean, isn't it
pretty overwhelming?</i>

1041
01:04:35,616 --> 01:04:37,032
<i>Everybody wants to be hip.</i>

1042
01:04:37,034 --> 01:04:39,034
And so that's what it is...

1043
01:04:39,036 --> 01:04:40,869
Everyone wants to be accepted.

1044
01:04:40,921 --> 01:04:43,633
<i>#...said! </i>

1045
01:05:03,894 --> 01:05:06,228
<i>Yeah? Okay. Gold.</i>

1046
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:08,363
<i>I just heard that you sold</i>

1047
01:05:08,398 --> 01:05:10,565
<i>600.000 albums in the United States.</i>

1048
01:05:10,567 --> 01:05:12,784
<i>Does that make it, like,
platinum or something like that?</i>

1049
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,202
It makes it gold.

1050
01:05:14,238 --> 01:05:17,239
It makes it a free gift
to my mother for Christmas.

1051
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:19,374
Exactly.
- I don't have to pay for a gift now.

1052
01:05:19,409 --> 01:05:20,575
What's Mom getting
for Christmas?

1053
01:05:20,577 --> 01:05:22,294
Oh, I guess she's
getting a gold record.

1054
01:05:22,329 --> 01:05:25,046
<i>Does that mean you guys are,
like, rich now?</i>

1055
01:05:25,082 --> 01:05:26,748
Hell, no.

1056
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,918
We're so far
from having any money.

1057
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,837
I mean we get per diem,
I guess.

1058
01:05:31,889 --> 01:05:34,556
<i>Do you care what critics think?</i>
- Oh, we...

1059
01:05:34,591 --> 01:05:37,476
You know, I think...
<i>- I've never sort of heard as many glowing criticisms.</i>

1060
01:05:37,511 --> 01:05:40,395
Oh, glowing.
<i>- Doesn't that make you feel good?</i>

1061
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:41,980
Well...

1062
01:05:42,015 --> 01:05:44,983
I mean, it's better than being slammed,
that's for sure.

1063
01:05:45,018 --> 01:05:46,601
But, you know, if I was reading

1064
01:05:46,653 --> 01:05:49,271
the same thing about another band,
I wouldn't believe it.

1065
01:05:49,273 --> 01:05:50,438
No way.

1066
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,607
I'm not gonna believe
some journalist

1067
01:05:52,659 --> 01:05:55,777
that's just spewing
about some band

1068
01:05:55,779 --> 01:05:58,413
that he thinks, whatever,
changed his life or...

1069
01:05:58,448 --> 01:06:02,200
Yeah.
- You know, can't believe everything you read.

1070
01:06:02,252 --> 01:06:03,785
I mean,
all you have to do is...

1071
01:06:03,837 --> 01:06:06,004
The music is
a personal experience.

1072
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:09,708
You put the music on and
whatever you get out of it...

1073
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,459
You know, if it's good or bad.

1074
01:06:11,461 --> 01:06:14,212
If it's bad, you don't like it,
you just walk away from it.

1075
01:06:14,264 --> 01:06:17,716
You know?
And if it's good, it works for you...

1076
01:06:17,768 --> 01:06:20,969
You know, this lighter...
- What the hell? Instead of...

1077
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,643
<i>There are
probably a lot of kids</i>

1078
01:06:28,695 --> 01:06:32,480
<i>who would hear a song and actually feel,
like, kinship...</i>

1079
01:06:32,482 --> 01:06:34,783
<i>Whether you're having
trouble with parents</i>

1080
01:06:34,818 --> 01:06:39,654
<i>or school or, you know,
the usual dysfunctional stuff that happens.</i>

1081
01:06:39,656 --> 01:06:40,479
<i>But when you're up there,</i>

1082
01:06:41,185 --> 01:06:42,901
<i>do you have any sense of
who you're playing to?</i>

1083
01:06:43,577 --> 01:06:46,711
<i>I'm playing to kids in general.</i>

1084
01:06:46,747 --> 01:06:49,664
<i>I mean, it doesn't matter
where they come from.</i>

1085
01:06:49,716 --> 01:06:51,666
<i>We have the same problems,</i>

1086
01:06:51,668 --> 01:06:54,719
<i>and we all basically have the same thoughts,
you know?</i>

1087
01:07:09,937 --> 01:07:13,405
# One baby to another says

1088
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,075
# I'm lucky to have met you

1089
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,911
# I don't care what you think

1090
01:07:19,947 --> 01:07:24,115
# Unless it is about me

1091
01:07:24,167 --> 01:07:31,039
# It is now my duty
to completely drain you

1092
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:34,009
# I travel through a tube

1093
01:07:34,044 --> 01:07:37,629
# And end up in your infection

1094
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,267
#...meat for you

1095
01:07:42,302 --> 01:07:45,687
# Pass it back and forth

1096
01:07:45,722 --> 01:07:49,107
# In a private kiss

1097
01:07:49,142 --> 01:07:51,893
# From my mouth to yours

1098
01:07:51,895 --> 01:07:54,279
# I like you...

1099
01:07:54,314 --> 01:07:57,432
<i>You guys don't like explaining
anything to do with your music,</i>

1100
01:07:57,467 --> 01:07:59,567
<i>but what's the problem
with going on camera and just...</i>

1101
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:02,404
There's nothing to be said.
It's all in the music, man!

1102
01:08:02,406 --> 01:08:04,789
It's all in the music.
It's all in the meat.

1103
01:08:04,825 --> 01:08:07,075
<i>You don't think that
people that are fans of you</i>

1104
01:08:07,077 --> 01:08:09,577
<i>would like to hear what you had in mind,
maybe?</i>

1105
01:08:09,579 --> 01:08:13,381
<i>Or what you were...</i>
- I'd rather hear what they have in mind, you know?

1106
01:08:13,417 --> 01:08:15,083
And how they interpret it.

1107
01:08:19,089 --> 01:08:20,889
<i>In "Teen Spirit"
you seem to complain</i>

1108
01:08:20,924 --> 01:08:23,258
<i>about the apathy
of our generation.</i>

1109
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:26,261
<i>And do you share this lack
of engagement yourself?</i>

1110
01:08:26,263 --> 01:08:27,595
What, being apathetic?

1111
01:08:27,648 --> 01:08:29,898
<i>Yeah.</i>
- Sure.

1112
01:08:29,933 --> 01:08:31,599
<i>Why?</i>

1113
01:08:31,601 --> 01:08:33,401
Why?

1114
01:08:33,437 --> 01:08:36,354
Because we sleep too much.

1115
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,444
<i>No, I mean, just say the...
- Do the first part only.</i>

01:08:42,446 --> 01:08:43,411
<i>Just read it.</i>

1117
01:08:43,447 --> 01:08:46,281
Hello.
Stay tuned for more...

1118
01:08:46,283 --> 01:08:51,836
Nirvana on "ABC in Concert"!

1119
01:08:51,872 --> 01:08:53,588
<i>You wanna do it again?
- One more?</i>

1120
01:08:53,623 --> 01:08:54,789
<i>Yeah, do one more...</i>

1121
01:09:01,715 --> 01:09:08,636
# With eyes so dilated,
I've become your pupil

1122
01:09:08,638 --> 01:09:12,223
# You tell me
everything about...

1123
01:09:12,275 --> 01:09:14,192
<i>Probably the biggest
band in the world right now,</i>

1124
01:09:14,227 --> 01:09:16,194
please welcome Nirvana!

1125
01:09:16,229 --> 01:09:17,812
Nirvana are real.

1126
01:09:17,864 --> 01:09:20,115
There's nothing pretentious about
them or anything like that.

1127
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:21,700
<i>They're world famous, you know?</i>

1128
01:09:21,735 --> 01:09:23,485
<i>Maybe I'll watch this
in the bar.</i>

1129
01:09:23,537 --> 01:09:25,870
Kurt Cobain, he's so beautiful.

1130
01:09:25,906 --> 01:09:30,325
<i># Sloppy lips to lips </i>

1131
01:09:30,377 --> 01:09:32,911
<i># You're my vitamins </i>

1132
01:09:32,963 --> 01:09:37,165
<i># I like you... </i>

1133
01:09:39,252 --> 01:09:40,719
Interviews are worthless.

1134
01:09:40,754 --> 01:09:42,137
Let's go.

1135
01:09:42,172 --> 01:09:43,722
What do you think
about interviews?

1136
01:09:43,757 --> 01:09:45,306
It's a pretty good magazine.
- What do I think?

1137
01:09:45,342 --> 01:09:47,726
Did you hear my reaction when he
asked me if I wanted to do one?

1138
01:09:47,761 --> 01:09:51,092
<i>Yeah.</i>
- I said, *** no.

1139
01:09:54,684 --> 01:09:56,979
Cobain has been mislabeled as a
"spokesman for a disaffeced generation."

1140
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:59,592
He's not interested in the job.
His lyrics have a sheen of naivetי

1141
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:03,434
that just barely contains his anger-
but gems like "I fell stupid and...

1142
01:10:04,694 --> 01:10:06,861
<i>Hey, I'm a hardcore Nirvana
fan myself.</i>

1143
01:10:06,913 --> 01:10:08,830
<i>Yeah?
- Is this a disease that you've had long?</i>

1144
01:10:08,865 --> 01:10:11,499
<i>Any cure for it?
- He's talking from his experiences.</i>

1145
01:10:11,535 --> 01:10:12,951
<i>He's talking from his experience.</i>

1146
01:10:13,003 --> 01:10:14,586
<i>Well, he's got lousy experience, sir.</i>

1147
01:10:14,621 --> 01:10:17,038
<i>Well, it's not his goal
to make millions of dollars</i>

1148
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,840
<i>when he made the stuff.
He's writing about his life.</i>

1149
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:21,760
<i>Well, his life needs to see
a therapist or a minister,</i>

1150
01:10:21,795 --> 01:10:24,212
<i>and it doesn't need to be
on millions of CDs</i>

1151
01:10:24,264 --> 01:10:26,297
<i>for kids to listen to
and identify with</i>

1152
01:10:26,349 --> 01:10:29,551
<i>and have more of their despair and
their hopelessness emphasize</i>

1153
01:10:29,553 --> 01:10:31,719
<i>by the tragedy
of this man's life.</i>

1154
01:10:38,221 --> 01:10:40,636
I feel like i'm being evaluated
en' his A day **** is hardwork

1155
01:10:41,702 --> 01:10:43,069
and the acclaim isn't worth it

1156
01:10:43,628 --> 01:10:44,867
unless you still like playing

1157
01:10:46,053 --> 01:10:47,355
God how I love plyings live.

1158
01:10:49,193 --> 01:10:50,651
But I'd be better off if I kept
my mouth shut.

1159
01:10:51,027 --> 01:10:54,507
There's a cool breeze chappig my lips
As my jaw hangs open discharging,

1160
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:56,212
waterfalls of guilty drool.

1161
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:58,811
opening my mouth for the disaffected
youth to ask them a question.

1162
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,276
Are you kinda mad sometimes at
your mom or dad kinda, in a way?

1163
01:11:10,772 --> 01:11:11,829
Pissy little self appointel
judge-curmudgean

1164
01:11:12,115 --> 01:11:12,869
oh the Guilt!
the Guilt!

1165
01:11:13,324 --> 01:11:14,067
the autographs
the fame

1166
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:15,251
the lights
the flash

1167
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:16,570
the Glitter
the Guilt

1168
01:11:17,001 --> 01:11:17,856
the Guilt

1169
01:11:20,904 --> 01:11:23,488
I guess each individual's
going to deal with it

1170
01:11:23,523 --> 01:11:24,989
the way they're going
to deal with it.

1171
01:11:25,025 --> 01:11:27,692
I get... You know,
it was kind of traumatic

1172
01:11:27,744 --> 01:11:29,611
to be famous all of a sudden,

1173
01:11:29,613 --> 01:11:32,113
especially coming
from this complete obscurity

1174
01:11:32,115 --> 01:11:34,782
and just being the number
one band in the world.

1175
01:11:34,784 --> 01:11:37,118
So I did things like
withdraw or drink.

1176
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:39,037
You know, I'm lucky.

1177
01:11:39,089 --> 01:11:42,090
I had beer and wine, you know?

1178
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:43,458
Kurt had heroin.

1179
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,347
<i>Given how volatile
and complicate</i>

1180
01:11:49,382 --> 01:11:52,267
<i>things were for Kurt
around that time,</i>

1181
01:11:52,302 --> 01:11:55,053
<i>why do you think he chose that moment to,
um,</i>

1182
01:11:55,105 --> 01:11:56,971
<i>start his relationship
with Courtney?</i>

1183
01:11:59,142 --> 01:12:01,526
I went...
I had this relationship

1184
01:12:01,561 --> 01:12:03,228
with this person, this woman.

1185
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:08,149
And I just kind of wanted
to build this home for myself,

1186
01:12:08,201 --> 01:12:12,904
because my home growing up
had fallen apart.

1187
01:12:12,956 --> 01:12:14,155
So I wanted to build a home.

1188
01:12:14,157 --> 01:12:17,575
And I think that Kurt
wanted to do that, too.

1189
01:12:17,627 --> 01:12:19,494
He wanted to build a home,

1190
01:12:19,546 --> 01:12:22,163
because his home
and his family fell apart.

1191
01:12:22,215 --> 01:12:25,550
So when Courtney
came into his life,

1192
01:12:25,585 --> 01:12:28,303
they had...
She was interesting,

1193
01:12:28,338 --> 01:12:31,339
she was artistic, intellectual,

1194
01:12:31,391 --> 01:12:33,892
and, you know,
she did drugs, too,

1195
01:12:33,927 --> 01:12:36,177
but that was all
part of the package

1196
01:12:36,179 --> 01:12:39,230
of building a home.

1197
01:12:41,651 --> 01:12:44,352
Check, check, check,
check, check, check, check.

1198
01:12:44,354 --> 01:12:46,354
Let's watch their sound check,
shall we?

1199
01:12:46,406 --> 01:12:48,156
<i>Sure.</i>

1200
01:12:48,191 --> 01:12:51,693
Maybe that will bug them
and they'll play really bad.

1201
01:12:51,745 --> 01:12:54,028
<i>I don't have the answer.</i>

1202
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,830
<i>So you're having a relationship</i>

1203
01:12:55,865 --> 01:12:57,665
<i>with the guitar player?</i>

1204
01:12:58,585 --> 01:13:00,335
<i>No?</i>

1205
01:13:03,957 --> 01:13:06,007
I don't know what it was.

1206
01:13:06,042 --> 01:13:07,842
Honestly.

1207
01:13:07,877 --> 01:13:09,761
<i>It's over?</i>

1208
01:13:09,796 --> 01:13:11,796
I think, yeah.

1209
01:13:11,848 --> 01:13:14,048
<i>What happened?</i>

1210
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:16,351
I don't care.

1211
01:13:22,142 --> 01:13:24,392
Dude, we're making a movie.

1212

Wow, did you curl your hair?

1213
01:13:26,947 --> 01:13:29,314
You don't like it?
- It's nicer when it's straight

1214
01:13:29,366 --> 01:13:31,566
because it doesn't make
your face look so round.

One caveat...
I had already done heroin,

01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,820
beat the thing,

1244
01:14:58,872 --> 01:15:02,323
had a rule, I loved it still,

1245
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:04,208
but I didn't have
a fantasy that he had.

1246
01:15:04,244 --> 01:15:06,044
He had a fantasy.
His fantasy was

1247
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:07,745
I'm going to get to 3 million $,

1248
01:15:07,797 --> 01:15:09,497
and then I'm going
to be a junkie.

1249
01:15:09,549 --> 01:15:12,333

don't do anything.

1265

Seattle's own Nirvana
finds itself

1286
01:19:35,732 --> 01:19:38,149
at the very top of
"Billboard's" pop albums chart

1287
01:19:38,184 --> 01:19:39,900
with its album "Nevermind",

1288
01:19:39,936 --> 01:19:41,435
while guitarist Kurt Cobain

1289
01:19:41,487 --> 01:19:43,104
just got engaged
to Courtney Love,

1290

<i>front woman of an L.A.
band called Hole.</i>

1291

<i>According to "Rolling Stone",
Cobain fell ill with a stomach problem</i>

<i>during their tour
of four continents</i>

1293
01:19:51,664 --> 01:19:54,165
<i>and had to cancel a number
of dates in England.</i>

<i>There's been speculation

<i>Whether it's a reaction
to "too much, too soon, "</i>

1298
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:06,877
<i>the band would rather
their music speak for itself</i>

1299
01:20:06,929 --> 01:20:09,547
<i>than be knighted as spokesmen
for a generation.</i>

1300
01:20:11,551 --> 01:20:13,384
<i>Right after you

<i>they were the biggest band

<i>and Kurt decided
to take six months off.</i>

1303
01:20:17,106 --> 01:20:21,809
So, officially,
in the story that's out in the world,

1304
01:20:21,811 --> 01:20:25,479
he took six months off
of their touring schedule?

1305
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:28,149
<i>He could have toured the world at that
point and made a shitload of money.</i>

Oh, I see.

1307
01:20:29,318 --> 01:20:30,484

it seemed like he wanted to stay</i>

1308
01:20:30,486 --> 01:20:32,570
<i>in an apartment with you
and do heroin.</i>

1309
01:20:32,655 --> 01:20:35,656
Yeah, he wanted to stay in an
apartment and do heroin and paint.

1310
01:20:35,708 --> 01:20:38,826
And play his guitar.
That's what he wanted to do.

1311
01:20:51,641 --> 01:20:53,424

<i>you're the good one

01:24:27,326 --> 01:24:30,366
I ove you more than my mother
I'll Abort christ for you

1364
01:24:30,981 --> 01:24:33,620
I'll make myself miserable
to make you happy

1365
01:24:35,564 --> 01:24:37,781
<i>Did you guys
want to have a baby?</i>

1366
01:24:37,817 --> 01:24:39,199
Oh, God, yes.

1367
01:24:39,235 --> 01:24:40,734
Yes, we wanted to have a baby,

1368
01:24:40,736 --> 01:24:43,570
and I conceived Frances
in December.

1369
01:24:43,623 --> 01:24:45,572
So, I was pregnant
when I got married, yes.

1370
01:24:45,574 --> 01:24:47,374
We were all we had,

1371
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:50,127
so making a family
as fast as possible

1372
01:24:50,162 --> 01:24:52,579
was, you know, important.

1373
01:24:52,632 --> 01:24:56,133
You know, so, I mean,
if I had had more time,

1374
01:24:56,168 --> 01:24:58,781
I'm telling you I'd have had
more kids with him.

1375
01:25:00,093 --> 01:25:02,092
<i>Why do you feel so bad?</i>

1376
01:25:04,977 --> 01:25:07,811
Why?
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1377
01:25:07,847 --> 01:25:10,431
Because I want to.

1378
01:25:10,433 --> 01:25:12,433
It's my fault.

1379
01:25:12,485 --> 01:25:15,769
All my fault.

1380
01:25:15,821 --> 01:25:17,821
<i>You're beautiful.
- I think you're really cute.</i>

1381
01:25:17,857 --> 01:25:19,273
Thank you very much.

1382
01:25:19,325 --> 01:25:22,326
<i>So do a lot of "Sassy" readers.</i>

1383

<i>I married Bobby Sherman.</i>

1384

<i>Do you think they do this to me?
- What?</i>

1385
01:25:27,116 --> 01:25:29,331
Do you think they do this to me
when they read "Sassy"?

1386
01:25:32,755 --> 01:25:35,188
<i>Girls don't masturbate
over their teen idols.</i>

1387
01:25:35,758 --> 01:25:37,124
They don't?

1388
01:25:37,176 --> 01:25:40,042
<i>No, they make up much more
intricate schematic plans.</i>

1389
01:25:40,129 --> 01:25:41,625
<i>Girls are a lot more
complex than boys.</i>

1390
01:25:42,598 --> 01:25:44,536
<i>You don't know what girls
do to each other.</i>

1391
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:46,229
<i>Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.</i>

1392
01:25:46,264 --> 01:25:49,710
They're vicious.
- I mean, you can know about crafty girls all you want,

1393
01:25:50,106 --> 01:25:51,398
but I wouldn't
let you go on tour

1394
01:25:52,308 --> 01:25:54,125
with crafty girls
because fuckin'...

1395
01:25:54,477 --> 01:25:55,886
It doesn't fuckin' matter, man.

1396
01:25:56,112 --> 01:25:57,945
They... They...

1397
01:26:00,483 --> 01:26:01,949
They diss me.

1398
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:04,485
They diss me all the time.

1399
01:26:04,537 --> 01:26:05,986
I'd be fat.

1400
01:26:05,988 --> 01:26:08,455
I can't... I know it's not
even like I can't trust you,

1401
01:26:08,491 --> 01:26:10,324
it's just you can't
trust men in general,

1402
01:26:10,326 --> 01:26:13,744
even if they're new men
and they're you.

1403
01:26:13,796 --> 01:26:18,749
And even if they're like you,
you still can't trust them.

1404
01:26:18,801 --> 01:26:21,585
I understand what you're trying to say,
but I don't agree.

1405
01:26:21,637 --> 01:26:25,422
Just because you...
- I'm a new man. I'm a man for the '90s.

1406
01:26:25,474 --> 01:26:27,474
I'm Ward Cleaver.

1407
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:29,510
And then, you being you,
you'd be all sensitive

1408
01:26:29,512 --> 01:26:31,261
and you'd go...

1409
01:26:31,313 --> 01:26:32,813
"How are we gonna
tell Courtney?"

1410
01:26:34,266 --> 01:26:35,899
Meanwhile, I've ruined my career,
I've ruined my life,

1411
01:26:35,935 --> 01:26:38,352
become the most hated woman in America,
because I'm 200 pounds.

1412
01:26:38,404 --> 01:26:41,105
But you're already the most hated woman in America.
- What?

1413
01:26:41,157 --> 01:26:44,691
You and Roseanne Barr are tied for
being the most hated woman in America.

1414
01:26:44,693 --> 01:26:46,577
Okay, I married Bobby Sherman,
I'm the most hated...

1415
01:26:46,612 --> 01:26:50,614
Ruined my body,
not play the Reading Festival this year

1416
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:53,283
when I could have
kicked your ass.

1417
01:26:53,335 --> 01:26:55,202
Just...
- You could... You should still play the Reading...

1418
01:26:55,254 --> 01:26:58,288
Oh, yes, I should just
play the Reading Festival.

1419
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:00,424
Dive into the crowd...
- Right. That's right.

1420
01:27:00,459 --> 01:27:02,709
Shoot off a gun,
light yourself on fire.

1421
01:27:02,762 --> 01:27:06,797
Let everyone see this.
- And give birth.

1422
01:27:06,849 --> 01:27:09,716
And this is only half of it.

1423
01:27:09,769 --> 01:27:13,387
The rest is yet to come.
- Look. Moustache.

1424
01:27:13,389 --> 01:27:15,189
Hmm, I like that.
<i>- Wait, wait.</i>

1425
01:27:15,224 --> 01:27:18,942
Free moustache rides!

1426
01:27:19,979 --> 01:27:21,302
It's a "womb broom."

1427
01:27:22,314 --> 01:27:24,800
Keep it, please?
- Okay! Ha!

1428
01:27:25,317 --> 01:27:27,755
Just keep it for the night.
- No way!

1429
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:29,116
Please, Kurt, you need...

01:27:35,911 --> 01:27:37,544
This is the look of Aberdeen.

1433
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:40,831
Come on, look at the camera.

1434
01:27:40,883 --> 01:27:42,800

The pregnancy

Nirvana star Kurt's baby
born a drug addict

1598
01:37:51,777 --> 01:37:52,981
Hooked
An insider at the Cedars Sinai Hopital

1599
01:37:53,394 --> 01:37:54,609
in Los Angeles revealed yesterday:
"The baby was high on methadone

1600
01:37:54,959 --> 01:37:56,166
when she was born.
She was fed the drug in the womb

1601
01:37:56,510 --> 01:37:57,683
via her mother who was still
hooked when she was born.

1602
01:37:57,997 --> 01:37:59,635
"The quickest way to get her off
the drug was to let her go cold turkey.

1603
01:38:00,153 --> 01:38:01,218
She suffered cold sweats, shivering
cramps and muscle spasms but she should live"

"Courtney was a real handful.

She was so spaced out she had
no idea what the was doing.

Pals say Kurt, whose hits with Nirvana
include Smells Like Teen Spirit,

was "very relieved" fer the birth.

One added: "He's happy that
the baby has relieved...

An article in Vanity Fair implied that Ms. Love had taken heroin well into the pregnancy.

1610
01:38:15,782 --> 01:38:17,959
Two weeks after the baby wa born,
using the article as evidence,

1611
01:38:18,349 --> 01:38:20,183
the Los Angeles County Department of
Children's Services

force the couple to surrender the child
to Ms. Love's sister.

Seven months ago, I shose to put myself

the highest form of responsibility

that I love her more than I love myself.

1649
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:39,653
Not because it's a fathers duty, but
because I want to out of love.

take your head out of your

the battle to have free and clear

Frances now lived with Kurt and Courtney,

01:52:52,259 --> 01:52:53,726
Mahna.

1815
01:52:53,761 --> 01:52:55,311
Mahna.
- That's right.

1816
01:52:55,346 --> 01:52:58,097
# Mahna mahna, do do do do do

1817
01:52:58,099 --> 01:53:00,265
# Mahna mahna, do do do do

1818
01:53:00,318 --> 01:53:02,601
# Mahna mahna,
do do do do do...

1819
01:53:02,603 --> 01:53:03,936
You haven't been eating a lot.

1820
01:53:03,988 --> 01:53:05,904
You don't feel like
a bloated child.

1821
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:08,657
Yeah, you got to force her
to eat lately.

1822
01:53:08,693 --> 01:53:10,576
She's been sick.

1823
01:53:10,611 --> 01:53:12,828
Well, you really have to force her
to eat.

1824
01:53:12,863 --> 01:53:14,947
She's not...
She's not motivated to...

1825
01:53:14,949 --> 01:53:17,199
<i>We don't have any luck
with it at all.</i>

1826
01:53:23,958 --> 01:53:26,508
<i>This is, like, a big deal.</i>
- I'm so tired.

1827
01:53:26,544 --> 01:53:29,461
<i>I am sorry.</i>
- I can't keep my eyes open.

1828
01:53:29,513 --> 01:53:31,847
<i>Stop it.
- Kurt, you don't want our daughter</i>

1829
01:53:31,882 --> 01:53:33,215
<i>to see you behaving
like you're...</i>

1830
01:53:33,267 --> 01:53:34,767
on drugs.

1831
01:53:34,802 --> 01:53:36,635
I'm not on drugs, I'm tired.

1832
01:53:36,687 --> 01:53:38,971
Do you have more teeth?
You have more teeth?

1833
01:53:39,023 --> 01:53:42,224
Please?
<i>- Your teeth were so as a kid.</i>

1834
01:53:44,478 --> 01:53:47,646
See? See?
Wife beating.

1835
01:53:47,648 --> 01:53:50,449
Here we go.

1836
01:53:50,484 --> 01:53:53,485
No, no. Oh, I'll hold her.

1837
01:53:55,122 --> 01:53:57,740
"Ow, my pretty golden locks.

1838
01:53:57,792 --> 01:54:01,877
It was going to be as long as Brenda's from '90210.'"
- You look so gorgeous.

1839
01:54:01,912 --> 01:54:04,213
You won't be able to believe it.
Ooh, pancake.

1840
01:54:04,248 --> 01:54:06,248
You won't be able
to believe it.

1841
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:09,885
# Amazing grace

1842
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:15,057
# How sweet the sound...

1843
01:54:15,092 --> 01:54:19,762
# That saved a wretch

1844
01:54:19,814 --> 01:54:25,184
# Like me

1845
01:54:25,236 --> 01:54:31,607
# I once was lost

1846
01:54:31,659 --> 01:54:37,029
# But now am found

1847
01:54:37,031 --> 01:54:39,948
# Was blind

1848
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:47,706
# But now I see...

1849
01:54:51,879 --> 01:54:56,048
It just...
Every week it got worse.

1850
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:57,933
And sometimes
he would come home,

1851
01:54:57,968 --> 01:55:01,887
I think to hide,
and it was really bad.

1852
01:55:01,939 --> 01:55:04,606
He started getting sores
and he was losing weight

1853
01:55:04,642 --> 01:55:07,943
and nodding out and...

1854
01:55:07,978 --> 01:55:11,864
I was pretty sure
he knew I knew.

1855
01:55:11,899 --> 01:55:15,901
But I decided one time
to just confront him.

1856
01:55:15,903 --> 01:55:19,455
And so I went up
to his bedroom.

1857
01:55:19,490 --> 01:55:21,573
He was sitting on
the side of the bed,

1858
01:55:21,625 --> 01:55:23,242
and he was crying,

1859
01:55:23,244 --> 01:55:28,247
because I had just arrived and he
knew it was breaking my heart.

1860
01:55:29,583 --> 01:55:31,416
And I talked to him about it

1861
01:55:31,469 --> 01:55:34,419
and everything that I had
learned about heroin.

1862
01:55:34,421 --> 01:55:37,139
And I asked him
if he was at the stage

1863
01:55:37,174 --> 01:55:40,342
of where he was addicted
to also the needle prick.

1864
01:55:40,394 --> 01:55:43,595
And he burst into tears.

1865
01:55:45,232 --> 01:55:47,733
And he was just ashamed.

1866
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:17,462
<i>One of the songs that,
actually,</i>

1867
01:56:17,515 --> 01:56:19,715
<i>I really liked on "In Utero"</i>

1868
01:56:19,767 --> 01:56:21,266
<i>but which you took off was</i>

1869
01:56:21,302 --> 01:56:23,969
<i>"I Hate Myself
and I Wanna Die."</i>

1870
01:56:23,971 --> 01:56:27,306
<i>How literal was that song
in terms of the title?</i>

1871
01:56:27,358 --> 01:56:30,142
<i>As literal as a joke could be.</i>

1872
01:56:30,194 --> 01:56:32,978
<i>I mean,
nothing more than a joke.</i>

1873
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:35,280
<i>And what kind of...
- Who were you playing the joke on?</i>

1874
01:56:35,316 --> 01:56:37,699
<i>'Cause I have to admit,
my first reaction was,</i>

1875
01:56:37,735 --> 01:56:40,903
<i>you know,
either this is really intensely satirical</i>

1876
01:56:40,955 --> 01:56:44,456
<i>or there's some really
dark shit happening here.</i>

1877
01:57:10,267 --> 01:57:13,268
<i>I'm really thankful
for a lot of things...</i>

1878
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:16,355
<i>My family, my child.</i>

1879
01:57:16,357 --> 01:57:18,824
<i>And every month,</i>

1880
01:57:18,859 --> 01:57:22,828
<i>I come to more optimistic
conclusions.</i>

1881
01:57:22,863 --> 01:57:26,031
<i>Do you find that you're
getting happier in general?</i>

1882
01:57:26,083 --> 01:57:29,585
<i>Yeah.
- I hope I don't become so blissful</i>

1883
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:31,670
<i>that I lose...
- Become boring.</i>

1884
01:57:31,705 --> 01:57:35,040
<i>Yeah, I become boring
or I lose my edge</i>

1885
01:57:35,092 --> 01:57:37,259
<i>or whatever it is, you know.</i>

1886
01:57:37,294 --> 01:57:38,627
<i>And who knows?</i>

1887
01:57:38,679 --> 01:57:40,762
<i>I don't have
any new songs right now,</i>

1888
01:57:40,798 --> 01:57:43,882
<i>so I'm starting from scratch
for the first time.</i>

1889
01:57:43,934 --> 01:57:47,019
<i>Tabula rasa, that'll be interesting.
- Yeah.</i>

1890
01:57:47,054 --> 01:57:49,054
<i>Is there a little
fear of the unknown?</i>

1891
01:57:49,056 --> 01:57:51,556
<i>Yeah, definitely.</i>

1892
01:57:51,609 --> 01:57:54,610
<i>Check, check, check.</i>

1893
01:57:54,645 --> 01:57:56,061
Check, check, check.

1894
01:57:56,113 --> 01:57:58,363
<i>Turn both guitars down.</i>

1895
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:01,483
<i>Turn both guitars down now.
- They're too loud.</i>

1896
01:58:02,703 --> 01:58:06,238
<i>Scott, you know that
goofy-ass stuff</i>

1897
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:08,540
that they have at music
stores called "Finger-ease"?

1898
01:58:08,575 --> 01:58:10,242
<i>That's a lot better.
- Thanks.</i>

1899
01:58:10,244 --> 01:58:12,127
<i>It's like an anal gel.</i>

1900
01:58:12,162 --> 01:58:14,246
<i>If I could just put some
on this string...</i>

1901
01:58:14,248 --> 01:58:15,464
<i>"Finger-ease"?</i>

1902
01:58:15,499 --> 01:58:17,132
It's called
"Finger-ease"

1903
01:58:17,167 --> 01:58:18,717
that your...
Yeah, it's like a roll-on.

1904
01:58:18,752 --> 01:58:20,752
<i>I just need it on one string.</i>

1905
01:58:20,804 --> 01:58:23,588
<i>God, I'm being picky today.</i>

1906
01:58:25,009 --> 01:58:26,758
Baby.

1907
01:58:28,228 --> 01:58:31,513
Will you guys, like...
Will you and Janet

1908
01:58:31,565 --> 01:58:33,649
and everybody that I know
sit in the front

1909
01:58:33,684 --> 01:58:35,600
so I can look at you?

1910
01:58:35,653 --> 01:58:37,853
'Cause I hate strangers.

1911
01:58:38,772 --> 01:58:40,939
<i>One, two, three.</i>

1912
01:58:47,698 --> 01:58:49,331
Thank you.

bird on "Davey and Goliath"?</i>

The little what?
<i>- Black bird on "Davey and Goliath, "</i>

sing, "Kumbaya"?

<i>No, I don't remember
the little bird.</i>

1921
01:59:11,138 --> 01:59:13,221
Remember that
really evil episode

1922
01:59:13,273 --> 01:59:14,856
where he was really mad
at this kid,

1923
01:59:14,892 --> 01:59:17,609
and he had all these visions
of how he's going to...

1924
01:59:17,644 --> 01:59:19,394
First I'm going to take him
up to a hill

1925
01:59:19,446 --> 01:59:23,198
and tie him to a tree
and tar and feather him!

1926
01:59:23,233 --> 01:59:25,817
It was evil.
That wasn't Christian at all.

Yeah.
<i>- What do you want to do?</i>

1950
02:01:46,426 --> 02:01:49,427
I'm going to play

You don't tell stories the way he does,

You mean like this?

1960
02:02:40,564 --> 02:02:42,063
Seen it, done it.

1961
02:02:45,652 --> 02:02:48,353

<i>Yeah, I do, too.</i>

<i>We're all sensitive

<i>Felt criticism, felt praise,</i>

1967
02:03:05,455 --> 02:03:08,206
<i>felt things
a little more intensely.</i>

1968
02:03:08,208 --> 02:03:09,374
Probably.

1969
02:03:09,426 --> 02:03:11,426
You know, he was so sensitive

1970
02:03:11,461 --> 02:03:15,714
that the one time that I
thought about cheating on him,

1971
02:03:15,716 --> 02:03:19,217
he fuckin' must have been
psychic or something.

1972
02:03:19,269 --> 02:03:20,385
I thought about it.

1973
02:03:20,437 --> 02:03:22,554
I didn't do it,
but I thought about it.

1974
02:03:22,606 --> 02:03:24,272
<i>You never cheated on Kurt?</i>

1975
02:03:24,308 --> 02:03:26,891
No, but I almost did one time,
and he knew it,

1976
02:03:26,893 --> 02:03:28,777
and I don't know
how he knew it.

1977
02:03:28,812 --> 02:03:30,478
I have no idea how he knew it.

1978
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:35,066
I mean, I didn't...
Because the plan didn't ever go anywhere.

1979
02:03:35,118 --> 02:03:37,736
So, it was just...
Nothing happened,

1980
02:03:37,738 --> 02:03:42,540
but I was tired and I...

1981
02:03:42,576 --> 02:03:47,746
I'm not...
I wasn't as monogamous as he is...

1982
02:03:47,798 --> 02:03:51,299
I'm a big flirt,
so I flirt with chairs.

1983
02:03:51,335 --> 02:03:54,052
But I never,
never cheated on him,

1984
02:03:54,087 --> 02:03:56,921
but I certainly thought about
it one time in London.

1985
02:03:56,923 --> 02:03:59,007
And I could have done it.

1986
02:03:59,059 --> 02:04:03,928
And the response to it was...

1987
02:04:03,981 --> 02:04:07,065
he took 67 Rohypnols
and ended up in a coma

1988
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:09,351
because I thought about
cheating on him.

1989
02:04:09,403 --> 02:04:11,736
I mean, fuck.
You're kidding.

1990
02:04:12,939 --> 02:04:16,107
I didn't even make
the phone call to do it.

1991
02:04:16,109 --> 02:04:18,326
<i>So why do you think
he chose that night</i>

1992
02:04:18,362 --> 02:04:19,828
<i>to try to take his life?</i>

1993
02:04:19,863 --> 02:04:22,781
<i>Was it because
he felt rejected?</i>

1994
02:04:22,833 --> 02:04:27,035
I think he would see it more as, like,
severe betrayal than rejection.

1995
02:04:27,087 --> 02:04:29,504
You know what I mean?

1996
02:04:51,778 --> 02:04:54,896

One month after returning from Rome,
Kurt Cobain took his own life.
