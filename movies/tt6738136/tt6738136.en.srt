1
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,224
You drive me completely crazy.

2
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,560
Everything would be so
simple if the kids weren't there.

3
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:29,179
And if you didn't have
such a nice ass.

4
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,665
Where is that little

5
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:36,208
peachy ass of mine?

6
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,086
Little juicy, peachy ass.

7
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,339
It's like a little alien
coming from another planet.

8
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:14,969
Richard!

9
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:23,967
What the fuck?

10
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:53,456
Oh, hum, Jennifer?

11
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:56,310
Just a friend.

12
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:02,396
She, uh...
She came for two days before...

13
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:06,290
Anyway...
Stan, Dimitri, my associates.

14
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,650
Hi.

15
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:08,776
- Hi.
- Hi...

16
00:08:14,436 --> 00:08:16,222
I'll leave you guys to it.

17
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:18,134
I'm gonna go take a shower.

18
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,162
<i>Oh yeah, we got nothing to lose.</i>

19
00:09:54,217 --> 00:09:56,458
As soon as I can,
I'll fly far away.

20
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:57,609
Tell me where.

21
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:00,942
I'll book my plane
ticket right now.

22
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:05,450
To L.A.

23
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:09,124
Everything is possible there.

24
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,858
Everything goes faster.

25
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:15,431
And... you can be noticed in no time.

26
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,521
And be noticed as what?

27
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:29,243
I don't know.

28
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:32,285
Just to be noticed?

29
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:36,274
You'd have to be blind
not to notice you.

30
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:47,604
- Fuck. Leave it.
- What is it?

31
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,691
Peyote.

32
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,440
A local, highly powerful
hallucinogenic. This shit

33
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,149
could flatten a football team.

34
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,198
It's for me!

35
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,404
- For tonight!
- Hey.

36
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:06,110
This, plus weapons, is a guaranteed
accident, you fucking morons.

37
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,317
A few years ago, a Polish guy
got so high on this shit,

38
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:14,641
he sawed his own leg off
without feeling a damn thing.

39
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:16,867
He died without a drop
of blood in his body.

40
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,153
Here you go, beautiful. Could you
go and hide it somewhere safe?

41
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,786
Uh-oh, here comes trouble.

42
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,312
Oh, yeah!

43
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,033
No, no no no. No.

44
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,609
Wow.

45
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,772
Hey! There she is.

46
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:44,206
Oopsie, hang on a sec.

47
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,457
There we go.

48
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,632
Oh. Richard went to give our
passports to the gamekeeper.

49
00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:09,841
It'll take him all morning.

50
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,443
Oh.

51
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:16,402
And Dimitri
is nursing a hangover.

52
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:19,968
Which will also take all morning.

53
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:23,324
So.

54
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,886
It's just the two of us.

55
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:14,509
- I'm gonna start packing.
- Oh.

56
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,169
If I want to be ready on time.

57
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:59,231
Oh, sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

58
00:16:59,346 --> 00:17:02,054
Oh, no, it's OK, you
just surprised me, that's all.

59
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:08,631
Hey, this is a nice bedroom.

60
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,697
Yes, it is.

61
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:19,577
You know, it really is a shame

62
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,897
we didn't have more time to get
to know each other better.

63
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:30,582
Call me when you can.

64
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,416
We could do...

65
00:17:35,616 --> 00:17:36,981
a thing or two...

66
00:17:37,962 --> 00:17:38,962
together.

67
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:46,321
I don't know
if I'll have time with work.

68
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,387
Oh, work.

69
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:53,511
So now
you're a fucking politician.

70
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,963
What is it
you don't like about me?

71
00:18:10,194 --> 00:18:11,366
No, nothing.

72
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:13,518
I just want to know, so...

73
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:16,562
tell me.

74
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:19,179
What is it
you don't like about me?

75
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:30,414
You're... You're not
my type, that's all.

76
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,260
Oh.

77
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:36,064
Why am I not your type?

78
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:45,602
You're...

79
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,392
you're too small.

80
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:55,226
Oh.

81
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:57,335
I like taller guys, that's all.

82
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,672
There we go!

83
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:14,739
And I haven't changed height
since yesterday, have I?

84
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,248
I asked you a simple question.

85
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:29,784
Even for your tiny
little oyster brain,

86
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,746
it shouldn't be
too difficult to understand.

87
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,404
So, I'll ask you again.

88
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:38,319
Did my height

89
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,840
change

90
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:43,750
since yesterday?

91
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:48,532
No.

92
00:19:49,383 --> 00:19:51,952
And yet,
you seemed to like me yesterday.

93
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:54,854
No, but I...

94
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,769
Yeah, yeah, yeah. When we were
dancing together last night,

95
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,015
everything was very clear.

96
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:03,209
You came onto me
like a pussy in heat,

97
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,913
rubbing yourself against me,

98
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:08,485
turning me on.

99
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:11,401
And now, suddenly,

100
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:13,325
I'm not your type?

101
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,760
Like that, boom.

102
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:19,868
During the night,
I've become too small for you.

103
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,929
Yesterday,
you were dying for it.

104
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,884
And now you're apparently...

105
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,686
Stop--

106
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,393
Richard will
be back anytime soon.

107
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,355
Oh, Richard.

108
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,350
Hey.

109
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,683
Call the helicopter.

110
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,787
Call the helicopter.
I want to go home.

111
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,065
Hey, calm down, calm down.

112
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,825
I'll take care
of everything, OK?

113
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:33,974
Don't worry.

114
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:06,134
How long did I sleep for?

115
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,155
Has the helicopter arrived yet?
Shh...

116
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:16,185
Everything's OK.
I fixed everything.

117
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:20,972
I made a few phone calls
to find you a job.

118
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:23,607
In Canada.

119
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:28,559
It's practically Los Angeles.

120
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,487
That's the amount I transferred
to an account for you,

121
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:37,283
you can use it as you please.

122
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,477
Jen, this is the possibility
to change your life,

123
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,313
to fulfill your dreams.

124
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,940
I want to go home right now.

125
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,819
Call that fucking helicopter.

126
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,044
Baby, baby, baby...
Don't act like a child.

127
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:55,625
You know that's not possible.

128
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,698
If you love me, think about me.

129
00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:01,277
OK, they fucked up big time,

130
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:03,946
but you're so damn beautiful,
it's hard to resist you.

131
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,790
Come on. Jen,
they'll come and apologize

132
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,180
and we'll forget
about the whole thing.

133
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,876
You call the goddamn helicopter!

134
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,087
Or I'll call your wife
and tell her everything!

135
00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:17,458
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

136
00:25:17,948 --> 00:25:19,109
You little whore.

137
00:25:19,442 --> 00:25:21,902
You dare threaten me or
fuck things up in my life?

138
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,469
Don't you ever talk
about my wife.

139
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:25,667
Don't you ever say her name.

140
00:26:35,964 --> 00:26:37,546
Hey, stop! Stop! Stop!

141
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,641
Jen, look at me.

142
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:42,436
I'm sorry about the slap.

143
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:45,587
I didn't mean to hurt you.
It's just... stress.

144
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,036
I lashed out without thinking.

145
00:26:48,896 --> 00:26:50,352
Give me your phone.

146
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,327
Give me the fucking phone!

147
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,419
I'm calling the chopper, I don't
want to hear another word about it.

148
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,204
What a fucking mess.

149
00:27:03,272 --> 00:27:05,661
Hey Roberto, it's Richard.
How are you?

150
00:27:06,572 --> 00:27:10,281
I'm very good, thank you. Listen,
we planned a pick-up at 2:30 pm.

151
00:27:10,326 --> 00:27:13,068
Yeah. And I would like
to make it earlier.

152
00:27:13,112 --> 00:27:14,602
Yeah, as soon as possible.

153
00:27:15,688 --> 00:27:16,803
Perfect.

154
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:19,323
OK, thanks.

155
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:23,708
He'll be there in 30 minutes.

156
00:27:26,248 --> 00:27:27,283
OK?

157
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,779
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Take it easy! Take it easy!

158
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:23,988
Take it easy.

159
00:44:45,753 --> 00:44:49,291
Did you really think
I was that fucking stupid?

160
00:44:50,564 --> 00:44:52,305
A fucking idiot

161
00:44:52,561 --> 00:44:54,848
who will let his rifle loaded

162
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,083
lying around for you to touch!
