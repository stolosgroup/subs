[Walt exhales]
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

4
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:13,664
Hi, I'm Walt and this is
my official application

5
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:17,585
for the Kovi Industries
Student Mars Program.

6
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:20,171
Not that the last 36
applications weren't official,

7
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:22,048
it's just this is
my final one.

8
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:25,968
because they are actually making
me graduate after this semester,

9
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,720
so... Okay.

10
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:31,974
<i>I was raised by a single mom.
She had, like, 100 careers.</i>

11
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:35,103
<i>We moved around like crazy,
so I never really had a home base.</i>

12
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:37,480
<i>But one time
when I was, like, six,</i>

13
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:39,774
<i>she took me to see
this solar eclipse</i>

14
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:43,111
and from that moment on all I
wanted to do was go to the Sun.

15
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:47,073
And I know that you can't
actually go to the Sun.

16
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:51,953
My mom would try to tell me that,
but I would just stare at it.

17
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:53,830
Uh, and I was obsessed.

18
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,332
<i>Because there was more
out there than the new town,</i>

19
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:59,418
<i>or the new school which always felt
like the same town and the same school</i>

20
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:01,170
and I think if I could've
gotten the chance to just

21
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,465
go up there and look back
I would've seen...

22
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:10,388
where I fit in,
in this crazy universe.

23
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:15,059
<i>Exploration is the way that we
discover where we truly belong</i>

24
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:19,689
and I just...
I don't belong here.

25
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:23,526
Which is all to say that I
think I would be a perfect fit

26
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:27,864
for the Geological Survey Team,
or Propulsions Analysis Department.

28
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:35,413
Look, if you need someone to
make you coffees, I'm your guy.

29
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:40,418
I am your guy.

30
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,423
That's it.

31
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:47,758
Um... Okay.

32
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:49,135
Well, with any luck,

33
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:51,387
the next time you see me

34
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,307
uh, I will be on Mars.

35
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:02,356
[Leon] <i>Let's face it.
This planet isn't cutting it anymore.</i>

<i>I'm self-made billionaire,
Leon Kovi</i>

37
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:08,487
<i>and I cannot wait
to meet you on Mars.</i>

[Gary] Walt! Oat milk latte.
Light foam.

39
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:15,328
Oat milk latte. Light foam.

40
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:18,289
[Gary] This obsession with Mars
is borderline unhealthy

41
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:21,459
and you are on the wrong side
of that border.

42
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:22,710
Exactly.

43
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:24,670
Should I fire you,
so you can go there?

44
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:29,008
Let's do it, Walt. I'll fire you.
It truly would be my pleasure.

45
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:31,302
No, Gary. I love it here.

46
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:32,845
[Gary] Maybe tomorrow.

47
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:35,640
- [woman] Oat milk latte?
- Light... foam?

48
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,728
- Gary?
- [Gary] Yes, Walt?

49
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:42,104
Did she just smile at me?

50
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,441
[Gary] Honestly, I'd say
she smiled past you.

51
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:47,902
- Analysis.
- There is a 52% chance

52
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:49,654
of romantic interest.

53
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:53,699
But a 48% chance she pities you
due to your low status position

54
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:55,326
as an assistant barista

55
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:58,329
to a robot
on a university campus.

56
00:03:58,412 --> 00:03:59,830
Shall I continue?

57
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,432
I honestly feel like I'm gonna
get accepted this time.

58
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,269
You're projecting.

59
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:23,187
So what?

60
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:26,565
Leon Kovi was 25 when he became the
very first man to set foot on Mars.

61
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,484
And here we are, just settling

62
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:31,988
for the same classes and jobs and
parties that our parents went to,

63
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:35,032
and their parents went to before them
and their parents went to before them...

64
00:04:35,116 --> 00:04:36,659
So you're not coming to
the party?

65
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:38,661
- Of course, I'm coming to the party.
- Great. Come on.

66
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:40,663
- You're carrying the booze.
- [Walt] No, come on.

67
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,707
- We're gonna forget about it and I'm gonna take it to work.
- Walt,

68
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,750
I'm gonna need you to
keep the whole

69
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,586
Walt-ing thing
in check tonight.

70
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,379
- "Walt-ing"?
- Bummer monologues.

71
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:51,257
- Leon Kovi hero worship.
- It's not hero worship.

72
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:57,013
- That came with the application packet.
- Not the frame.

73
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,558
Don't you wanna be
part of something special?

74
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,645
Walt.

75
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,605
You're not special.

76
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,691
I'm not special.

77
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,943
Most people, not special.

78
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:13,279
Listen, someday,
you're gonna meet someone

79
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:15,448
and make something special
with them.

80
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:16,699
Like a memory.

81
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:19,160
Or a weird, well, baby thing.

82
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:22,121
But until then,

83
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:25,958
drink this and for the love
of God do not bring up Mars.

84
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,336
- [club music playing]
- This place is nuts.

85
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:29,920
Do you live here?

86
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:31,922
Oh, no. Some trust fund girl.

87
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:34,884
[scoffs]

88
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,053
You know, when I was little,
I had this fantasy that my mom...

89
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,013
Ooh, let's not.

90
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:40,556
Yeah.

91
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,476
Bathroom?

92
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,815
It's beautiful.

93
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,567
[orb] Hi, Sophie.

94
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,194
Okay, show me yours.

95
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:54,779
[orb] <i>Hi, Calvin.</i>

<i>Nine months.</i>

98
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:02,119
<i>Nine months until
my parents' contract is up</i>

99
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:04,163
<i>and we return to Earth.</i>

100
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:07,708
<i>Nine more months
without touching you.</i>

101
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:11,879
<i>At least this way, you will
know when I want to touch you</i>

102
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:13,756
<i>and vice versa.</i>

103
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,175
Well, I hope touching me is a lot
more fun than touching one of these.

104
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:18,427
<i>No, no, no, it is.
The texture's for, like...</i>

105
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,429
<i>Can you guys please stop talking
about touching each other in here?</i>

106
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,264
- Hi, Brandon.
- [Brandon] <i>Hi, Sophie.</i>

107
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,725
<i>Jan, can you get Brandon
out of here?</i>

108
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:28,229
- [Brandon] <i>Will you stop calling her Jan? It's "Mom."</i>
- <i>Jan, get your idiot son out!</i>

109
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:34,944
[Brandon] <i>Why would you grab
my butt? Now the hole.</i>

00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,614
[Calvin] <i>Dude, way too much, dawg!
Get out of here.</i>

111
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:42,159
- Is that on Mars?
- Oh! What are you doing? Get out!

112
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:43,577
Just looking for the bathroom.

113
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:45,621
Who walks into bathrooms
without knocking?

114
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:47,623
Walt. Is this live?

115
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,417
How did they solve
for the time delay?

116
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,252
<i>It's called quantum splicing.</i>

117
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:53,295
Don't talk to him.
I don't know this man.

118
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,005
- Could we exchange emails or something?
- [Sophie] No!

119
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:57,341
- Mine's just "Walt" five times at...
- [gasps]

120
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:01,846
I'm sorry. I can replace it.

121
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:03,597
Unless it's expensive.

122
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,266
- Get out.
- Right now?

123
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:06,976
[Sophie] Yes, right now!

124
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:11,647
Sorry. Jules tricked me
into throwing a party.

125
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,316
- [Jan] <i>And yet you're in your room.</i>
- Uh, nope.

126
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,404
It's not really a party.
It's more of a soiree.

127
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:19,989
[Jan] <i>Sophie, it's fine.</i>

128
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,949
<i>I'm late for work. Love you.</i>

129
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:24,118
- Love you.
- [Calvin] <i>Love you, Mom.</i>

130
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:27,329
<i>Go. Mingle. We'll be back soon.</i>

131
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,791
<i>And in the meantime, it might be good
for you to have some new experiences.</i>

132
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,836
Nothing's more overrated
than new.

133
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,880
<i>There's a title
for your thesis.</i>

134
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:38,966
<i>Sophie,</i>

135
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:40,426
<i>go.</i>

136
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:41,969
<i>I'll make sure Calvin
calls you tomorrow.</i>

137
00:07:44,054 --> 00:07:46,015
- Night, Jan.
- <i>Goodnight.</i>

138
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,037
You know, I've been at this
school for three years.

139
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,164
Always said that I'd explore
these woods.

140
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:13,959
Never have. Guess I thought
that I would just...

141
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:16,253
[slurring] I've been going to
this school for five years.

142
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:18,964
- Oh, five years, okay.
- [burps]

143
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:22,718
And I always said I'd explore
these woods too.

144
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:26,472
But know what?
Somebody already did.

145
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:29,391
A long, long time ago.

146
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,809
It's over.

147
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:33,103
There's nothing left
to discover.

148
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,440
You're okay, man.

149
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:39,151
You're a good listener.

150
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:40,736
[Ginny laughs]

151
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,906
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,408
I've never seen light flirting
take such a dark turn.

153
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,035
Basically my superpower.

154
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:50,496
Just one brief conversation
with me will

155
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,582
really leave you
questioning everything.

156
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,377
Not the hero we need, but maybe
the one we deserve.

157
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,129
You know, in about 14 seconds you're
going to get the sudden urge to jump.

158
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:00,923
Oh, no. You're safe.

159
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:04,927
I'm already in the midst
of an existential crisis.

160
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,971
Oh, well. In that case,

161
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,597
Walt, at your service.

162
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,516
- Ginny.
- Ginny?

163
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,768
Yeah, the, uh,

164
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:14,436
astrophysics major?

165
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:18,440
How did you know that?

166
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,360
I was in your Intro to
Fluid Dynamics class.

167
00:09:21,443 --> 00:09:23,237
Freshmen year.

168
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,322
This is the part where you at
least pretend to remember me.

169
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:29,159
- Oh, my God! Walt! Wow.
- Yeah, thank you. Thank you.

170
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:30,619
Changed your major?

171
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,912
Sixteen times.

172
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:33,956
Only for
personal reasons like...

173
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:37,042
I have no idea what physics is.

174
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:40,588
But enough about me. Tell me about
your crisis. What's going on?

175
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:43,424
Well, I'm

176
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:45,342
supposed to move tomorrow.

177
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:47,386
Big move, actually in, uh,

178
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,140
seven hours and...

179
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,600
Let's just say
it's a big commitment

180
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:55,436
and I'm not
a big commitment kinda gal.

181
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,354
Are you saying we're in
one of those

182
00:09:57,438 --> 00:10:00,566
classic "we-only-
have-tonight" scenarios?

183
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:02,860
Will spending it with you
make me wanna stay?

184
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,489
[Walt] Now,
the thing about here,

185
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,907
is that it's mostly garbage.

186
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:10,701
As you can see, to your left
and to your right

187
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:12,620
there's literal garbage
overflowing from

188
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:14,204
these receptacles at all times.

189
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:16,165
- Yeah.
- And it might magically seem to disappear

190
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,043
but it's really just added to
that big floating pile of garbage

191
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:20,586
in the Pacific Ocean.

192
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:22,338
Currently the size of Texas
and visible from space.

193
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,881
How scenic.

194
00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:26,008
Now, the one great thing

195
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,010
about this particular
garbage factory

196
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:30,262
is its connection to
the last best chance

197
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,640
any of us have
at a real adventure.

198
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:36,352
The Kovi Industries
Mars Program.

199
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,187
So that's how
they got you here.

200
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:44,193
Yeah. But tomorrow another ship
will leave for Mars without me.

201
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,028
You could always rob a bank
and buy a ticket.

202
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:48,280
- Yeah, I'd have to rob, like, nine banks.
- Hmm.

203
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:50,658
I have considered
the old air ducts plan.

204
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:53,410
You know, hide in the air ducts
survive on stolen food.

205
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:55,871
Pee in bottles that you dump into other
people's toilets while they sleep.

206
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:59,667
[Walt] And hope they would be so impressed
when I arrive that they just let me stay.

207
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,168
[Ginny laughs]

208
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:08,717
Curious how you spin garbage
into this spot.

209
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,803
[Walt] This is
a garbage-free zone.

210
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:17,434
It's like Mars.

211
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,269
Did you know that they send
all of their trash

212
00:11:19,353 --> 00:11:21,188
back to Earth
on the return flights?

213
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,944
Okay, I gotta know.

214
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:29,405
Why Mars?

215
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:39,081
I feel like if I had been born
like 600 years ago

216
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:43,168
I would've stolen a boat
and just set sail by now.

217
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:44,753
And I probably would've died.

218
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,046
Oh, definitely would've died.

219
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,631
But it would've been
an adventure.

220
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:50,092
You know?

221
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:52,803
And now there's Mars
and I keep applying,

222
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,972
but 36 rejections later

223
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:56,682
and I'm starting to get
the feeling that...

224
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:59,476
They don't need
extraordinary mediocrity?

225
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,437
Yeah. That's funny.

226
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:07,401
No, I get it.

A telltale reflection of what
has been deepest in our hearts.

230
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:23,417
We've seen in Mars the utopia,

231
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,629
a wilderness, a sanctuary.

232
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:32,050
With so few landmarks,
guideposts, or constraints

233
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:34,762
all is possible.

234
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:38,056
Mars has been a blank canvas

235
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,017
and tenderly

236
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:43,479
our human seeking
has rushed to fill it."

I think

00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,289
when you look at something
from this distance,

244

it's all possibility.

00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:29,871
Oh, come on, Walt.

313
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,004
Hey! You probably
don't remember me.

314
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:39,047
You broke my orb.

315
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,632
Good memory.

316
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,136
Is that supposed to
make us even?

317
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,930
No. But if you don't order
anything, you can't use the Wi-Fi

318
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:49,725
and sit here
like a black hole of sadness.

319
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,395
- Company policy. It is.
- Stupid policy.

320
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,063
And you're gonna
have to pay for that.

321
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,691
Because if I do,
Gary will just ask you to leave.

322
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:59,234
Are you serious?

323
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:00,986
Rarely. But right now, yes.

324
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:05,824
Yay.

325
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:07,909
How's the Mars boyfriend?

326
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,494
He's great.

327
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:11,246
- Yeah, he got his Martian dream job, so...
- Wow.

328
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,082
...one year of long distance
just became indefinite.

329
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,043
And then my Wi-Fi cut out.

330
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:18,378
Probably because of all the calls
with him trying to make it work.

331
00:17:18,462 --> 00:17:20,630
And now I'm sitting here,
suffering in public

332
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:22,716
and paying for drinks
that I didn't order.

333
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,634
So you tell Gary,

334
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:26,595
I hope he gets malware.

335
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:32,768
[Gary] I hope she fails to find
long-term companionship

336
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,228
and learns the pain
of a solitary life.

337
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:37,022
[blowing nose]

338
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,036
[Sophie] I'm not paying
for that one.

339
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,371
Believe it or not,

340
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:54,790
I might be the only person here

341
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,249
who knows exactly
what you're going through.

342
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,834
Because you're causing it?

343
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:02,798
No. Because my girlfriend

344
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,841
left for Mars a month ago

345
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:07,177
and hasn't texted me back
in three days.

346
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,935
How long have you guys
been together?

347
00:18:15,018 --> 00:18:18,563
Since ninth grade.
So, eight years.

348
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:20,899
Eight years?

349
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:23,944
- How did you manage that?
- We had a plan.

350
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:26,321
One year, long distance
and then

351
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,282
he comes back to Earth
and I graduate

352
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:31,910
and we use his terraforming
expertise and my focus

353
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:35,956
on eco reconstruction to jump-start an
algae-based waste reduction technology.

354
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,167
- What?
- Plants that eat garbage, okay?

355
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,294
It's how we're gonna save
the world.

356
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:44,548
- You're smart. [laughs]
- I know.

357
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,883
And what about you guys?

358
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:50,512
Ginny?

359
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:53,932
We've been dating since
freshman year-ish.

360
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:55,308
It got serious recently.

361
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:57,686
What does this Mars genius have

362
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,146
that I don't?

363
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:02,107
- Everything. Yeah.
- Everything?

364
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,025
Could you actually be
more specific?

365
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,069
I'm trying to figure out why they
keep rejecting my applications.

366
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:11,658
[Sophie] He checks
all the boxes.

367
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,787
Oh. You mean, literally.

368
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:18,373
Okay, let's see.

369
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:20,375
"Quiet. Strong jaw.

370
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,586
Mental fortitude. Six-pack.

371
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:27,757
Good family, cool mom."
I have a cool mom.

372
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:29,593
Yeah? You guys close?

373
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:31,678
No. I mean "cool," like when she
was going through the divorce

374
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:34,389
I was able to just do whatever
I wanted from 12 on.

375
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,849
Anyhow. "Hates video games.

376
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:38,476
Pragmatic and high-earning
potential."

377
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:42,606
- It's interesting.
- What?

378
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:44,608
That's an impossible checklist.

379
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:48,737
- That's my cue.
- You know, if you really love this guy

380
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,282
I do know a way that you can
get on that ship tomorrow.

381
00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:54,743
Two words.

382
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,578
Air ducts.

383
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:58,955
- Or I could just buy a ticket.
- Yeah, for like a million dollars.

384
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:06,004
Do you have a million dollars?

385
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:09,591
- My finances are personal.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

386
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:12,469
That means you have
at least two million dollars.

387
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:14,137
What are you doing here?

388
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:15,597
Buy a ticket!

389
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,516
- It's your last chance for a year.
- I can't.

390
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,310
You have the money.

391
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:23,104
I have aerophobia.

392
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,398
Well, we're all afraid
of arrows.

393
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:27,651
Oh, my God!
I'm afraid of flying.

394
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:29,152
[door buzzes]

395
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:31,404
- And now I'm trapped.
- You're trapped? I'm trapped.

396
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:33,406
- [Sophie] Gary, door!
- I can't even get through security

397
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,492
to see
a shuttle launch up-close.

398
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:39,246
- Unlock the door, Gary.
- I'm afraid I can't do that. Perhaps it's malware.

399
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:41,831
You can transcend
time and space.

400
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:44,042
In the name of love.
The ultimate adventure.

401
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,544
I'm filing a complaint to
corporate right now. Open the door.

402
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:48,755
[Gary] No need
to call corporate.

403
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,799
A simple misunderstanding.

404
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:54,219
Walk away. Just like
I knew you would.

405
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:57,931
- You don't know anything about me.
- I know everything about you.

406
00:20:58,014 --> 00:20:59,474
No!

407
00:20:59,557 --> 00:21:02,519
The only people who know me
are 55 million miles away!

408
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:10,151
The only people who know me
are 55 million miles away.

409
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,362
The only people
that know me are...

410
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:14,990
Gary?

411
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,992
Oh, God, that's sad.

412
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,910
No, no. No. Please, please.

413
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:21,997
Don't call corporate on Gary.
He's just gonna take it out on me.

414
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,748
Calvin is on Mars.

415
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:25,709
Jan, Brandon, Jim,
they're all there.

416

How many boyfriends
do you have?

417
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,337
It's really that simple.

418
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:37,595
Goodbye, Walt.

I must administer

- Breathe on my face.
- [Walt] Bye, Gary.

- I'll miss you.
- [Gary] Goodbye, Walt.

436
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:48,583
I have already forgotten you.

What are you doing here?

00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:28,123
And what are you wearing?

445
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,708
I just came to see the launch.
And I got all this duty-free.

446
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,377
Wore it right out of the store.

447

Duty-free doesn't mean free.
You just robbed a gift shop.

What? No.

Wait, really?

450
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,638
Look, I just came to apologize.
I was a dick. Also, I need a favor.

451
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,141
You are the ingrown toenail
of humanity.

- Leave me alone.
- Just hear me out for one minute.

453
00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:50,812
All I need is for you to tell
security I'm your family

454
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:52,564
- so I can accompany you to the gate.
- What?

455
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:55,316
No. God! I'm leaving this
planet largely because of you.

And I totally understand.
Again, so, so sorry.

457

- It's just...
- It's just, "Go away."

458
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,368
You had a plan, right?

459
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:07,078
So you know what it feels like
when that plan gets taken from you.

How it just kills you?

461
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,291
I barely got in this school.
I took out 100 loans

462
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:14,294
and I worked a dozen crappy
jobs because this was my plan.

463
00:24:14,377 --> 00:24:15,753
To go to Mars.

464
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:18,006
And now Ginny is there
and I have to be with her.

465
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,675
I have to adventure with her.
Just like you.

466
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:22,886

But now Ginny is gone.

469

chance to see a rocket launch up close

[Walt] And on the first colonial
mission the ship's hull was damaged.

477
00:24:58,004 --> 00:24:59,714
Kovi had to survive
in the air ducts.

478
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:01,549
Now, he almost died,

479
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,801
but his lung capacity
is unparalleled.

480
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:06,429
My lung capacity is also
kind of unparalleled.

481
00:25:06,513 --> 00:25:08,264
When I was a kid, I actually
went under in the wave pool.

482
00:25:08,348 --> 00:25:09,766
I was down there for, like,
three minutes

483
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:11,559
before anyone could
even pull me back up.

484
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:14,687
They all thought I drowned,
but I really just passed out.

485
00:25:14,771 --> 00:25:16,856
That's why I never go to
the bathroom in the wave pool.

is triple-reinforced with concrete?

Space concrete. In case the
shuttle explodes on the launchpad.

Which has only happened twice.

- [Sophie] Shut up.

- I'm not.

This is the first interesting
thing I've seen you do.

494

[Sophie] I hate when boys
do that.

620
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,827
- Sophie.
- Calvin.

621
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,870
- I'm a scientist.
- Engineer.

622
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,248
- Double threat.
- Enough shoptalk.

623
00:33:12,331 --> 00:33:15,793
Tabby and Celeste over here,
or can I call you Taboo and Celery?

624
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,545
They've been engaged
for nine years.

625
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,006
We are actually not engaged.

626
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,260
Yet. It's just when we were
talking earlier

627
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:28,055
I was saying,
"We'll probably get engaged

628
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,932
once we get to Mars."

629
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:33,060
- Congratulations?
- You know, as captain,

630
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,354
I could marry all of you guys.

631
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:36,897
I mean, not like
a four-way thing.

632
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,899
- Two weddings.
- We should do this.

633
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,943
- No.
- Full disclosure. I just need to have a party on this ship.

634
00:33:41,027 --> 00:33:43,821
Honestly. I can pilot
a four-billion-dollar spaceship

635
00:33:43,904 --> 00:33:47,742
through an asteroid belt, but I can't
get one of you guys to let loose.

636
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,452
You know what
I'm talking about?

637
00:33:49,535 --> 00:33:51,120
You don't.

638
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:54,165
Well, it was nice to meet you.

639
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:55,666
Yeah.

640
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,418
Okay.

641
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:00,629
All right, you guys. Just need to
see your ID so I can check you in,

642
00:34:00,713 --> 00:34:02,548
and I'll be out
of your love nest.

643
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,472
I don't seem to have my ID on me.
I don't wanna hold you up.

644
00:34:09,555 --> 00:34:11,474
I can run it by
the bridge later.

645
00:34:11,557 --> 00:34:13,017
I knew it.

646
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,229
You're the looks,
she's the brains.

647
00:34:17,313 --> 00:34:19,190
Yeah.

648
00:34:19,273 --> 00:34:23,194
Listen, when you find it, just scan it
on the wall and Cornelia will log you in.

649
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:25,404
'Kay? Awesome.

650
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:30,034
Ooh, happy early birthday.

651
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:31,619
How old is she gonna be?

652
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:37,500
Trick question.
You never say a woman's age.

653
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:40,628
- [chuckles]
- How old do I look?

654
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,546
- [both] Trick question.
- [laughs nervously]

655
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,592
A-hole.

656
00:34:50,554 --> 00:34:52,723
- [Walt] It's your birthday?
- In two weeks.

657
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:54,058
- Listen, I gotta...
- We should throw a party!

658
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:55,643
I don't do birthdays.

659
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,353
Jehovah's Witness?

660
00:34:57,436 --> 00:34:59,313
No. They're arbitrary,
and we don't need any extra attention.

661
00:34:59,396 --> 00:35:01,190
Well, extra attention
is kinda the point.

662
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:03,442
Oh, no, I see what you mean.

663
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:06,612
All onboard data flows through the manifest,
which is controlled by the ship's log.

664
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:09,406
So if anyone knows how to
print you an ID, it's them.

665
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,825
How do you know all this stuff?

666
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,409
Do you think I would let
the love of my life

667
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:14,495
take one of these ships
across the solar system

668
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:16,705
without knowing exactly
how it's made?

669
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:20,292
Don't say that
like it's normal.

670
00:35:31,428 --> 00:35:32,471
Hello?

671
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,482
R-I-G... G?

672
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:44,942
[beeping]

673
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:48,821
Huh.

674
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:53,367
Says here you were already on
the Olarun Two.

675
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,077
Oh, there...

676
00:35:55,161 --> 00:35:57,413
Earl, this is a clerical error.

677
00:35:57,496 --> 00:36:00,666
You know how computers
just get buggy sometimes?

678
00:36:00,749 --> 00:36:03,210
Why are you two standing
so far apart?

679
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,463
Most young couples are all over
each other, kissing...

680
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:08,799
at an alarming frequency.

681
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:09,925
Yeah.

682
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:12,052
That makes sense.

683
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,470
Right, sweetie?

684
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:14,722
[groans softly]

685
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,726
Ah!

686
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,812
Say, Earl... what's this?

687
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,815
Space wine.

688
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:25,774
Cool.

689
00:36:25,858 --> 00:36:28,068
I usually drink alone.

690
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:31,113
I gave Carla a glass...

691
00:36:31,197 --> 00:36:32,823
but she can't hold her liquor.

692
00:36:32,907 --> 00:36:33,991
Carla?

693
00:36:34,074 --> 00:36:36,493
Oh. Carla, the computer.

694
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:38,996
[Carla] You can't hold
your liquor.

695
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,080
[warbles]

696
00:36:41,582 --> 00:36:42,583
Uh...

697
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:44,084
Earl...

698
00:36:45,461 --> 00:36:46,879
- [slow music playing]
- [sizzling]

699
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,843
- [electricity crackling]
- Oh!

700
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,720
All right.

701
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,181
Soft reboot, Earl.

702
00:36:57,264 --> 00:36:59,433
How do you know
how to do all this?

703
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:02,186
My thesis is on eliminating
planned obsolescence

704
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:04,063
and universal
mechanical literacy

705
00:37:04,146 --> 00:37:07,483
as key tools to promote
biospheric sustainability.

706
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:10,319
It'd be kind of ironic if I didn't
know how to fix it, you know?

707
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:12,780
Yeah. Yeah,
I know, I know. I do know...

708
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:13,739
It's ironic.

709
00:37:13,822 --> 00:37:15,783
[Carla] Earl, is that you?

710
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,493
I had the most terrible dream.

711
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:19,662
[Earl] Let's get you that ID.

712
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:20,913
[Cornelia] Hello, Calvin.

713
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,957
Hello, Calvin.

714
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,292
Hello, Calvin.

715
00:37:27,628 --> 00:37:29,505
Your photo will show up
in all the system reports

716
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:33,217
so as long as no one does a deep
search, you should be fine.

717
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,594
Calvin hates social media.

718
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:38,597
Okay. Amazing. Wow. My heart is racing.
What are we doing next?

719
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:39,765
Next? We lay low.

720
00:37:39,848 --> 00:37:42,184
What? No.
Oh, my heart.

721
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:43,310
- Gary?
- Cornelia.

722
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,812
Cornelia, is my heart normal?

723
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,480
[Cornelia] Your biorhythms
are elevated.

724
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:49,066
You may be experiencing
cardiac arrest...

725
00:37:49,149 --> 00:37:50,818
or sexual reproduction.

726
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,861
Oh, it's definitely not
sexual reproduction.

727
00:37:52,945 --> 00:37:54,154
Okay. We need a routine.

728
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:57,074
Be seen enough
not to draw attention.

729
00:37:57,825 --> 00:37:59,368
Oh, here we go.

730
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:01,870
A lecture series by a few of
the Mars specialists on board.

731
00:38:01,954 --> 00:38:03,080
[Walt] Hard pass.

732
00:38:03,163 --> 00:38:04,498
- Bathing in zero G...
- Soft maybe.

733
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:07,167
Food tube cooking, spacewalk...

734
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:08,335
Spacewalk?

735
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,004
No. You need a partner for that

736
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,673
and there's no way I'm getting
off the ship until it lands.

737
00:38:12,756 --> 00:38:15,676
Come on, Sophie.
We are in the clear.

738
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:17,136
Let's go have some fun.

739
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:18,345
We're not gonna get caught.

740
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,389
They're not gonna kick us off.

741
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:21,640
Check it. Cornelia?

742
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:23,183
[Cornelia]
Greetings, Calvin-Walt.

743
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,977
Nope. Just Calvin.

744
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,271
Cornelia, wasn't there
a stowaway on the Olarun Three?

745
00:38:27,354 --> 00:38:28,856
[Cornelia] Yes.
A feline was discovered.

746
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,483
And isn't that cat
now the very first cat on Mars?

747
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:32,901
- <i>No.</i>
- See?

748
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:34,737
What?

749
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,239
[Cornelia] She is awaiting trial
for her crimes against the company.

750
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:38,490
Ripley.

751
00:38:38,574 --> 00:38:40,242
And that's why we stick
to the plan.

752
00:38:40,326 --> 00:38:42,119
- What's this?
- Calvin's practice interviews.

753
00:38:42,202 --> 00:38:44,705
If you're going to be him,
you have to get to know him.

754
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:46,415
You filmed them?

755
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:49,376
I will download his thesis
for you and explain it to you,

756
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,130
and show you some of
the messages he sent me.

757
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:54,048
The PG ones.

758
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,175
You mean the boring ones.

759
00:38:56,258 --> 00:38:58,886
Cornelia,
please dim the lights.

760
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,516
This is gonna suck, isn't it?

761
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,435
[Sophie] Only for 35 days.

762
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:10,356
[upbeat music playing]

763
00:39:16,278 --> 00:39:19,365
We can do quizzes
at 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.

764
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:21,450
- Two a day?
- Yes!

765
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:22,576
What about...

766
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:24,119
personal intimacy time?

767
00:39:24,203 --> 00:39:26,246
We share that room.

768
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,957
Exercise some self-control.

769
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:38,300
[Calvin] <i>Hey, there she is.</i>

770
00:39:38,384 --> 00:39:40,761
- <i>Sorry, do we have a call scheduled?</i>
- No, no, we didn't.

771
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:43,931
I just thought that you might
be in the mood.

772
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,432
Got to shit.

773
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,643
Wrong room! Wrong room!

774
00:39:47,726 --> 00:39:50,354
Whoa! Whoa! Hypocrite!
Hypocrite! Hypocrite!

775
00:39:50,437 --> 00:39:51,939
<i>Sophie! Sophie?</i>

776
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,441
- You get 10 minutes a day.
- 15.

777
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,610
- Twelve.
- Fine.

778
00:39:56,693 --> 00:40:03,784
Humans. AI. A crucial relationship
that should always remain professional.

779
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,744
Even I struggle to follow.

780
00:40:05,828 --> 00:40:08,080
We would love it if you would
do a lecture on terraforming.

781
00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:10,082
- No.
- Since you are the expert.

782
00:40:10,165 --> 00:40:14,503
He had a traumatic accident
on stage last year

783
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:17,214
and he's recovering still.

784
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:18,549
Did you get an erection?

785
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:20,050
- What?
- Yes.

786
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:21,468
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

787
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,512
- You have to keep a low profile.
- I am.

788
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:26,557
People wanna hang out with me
even after the erection rumors.

789
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,809
It's weird, I know. It's never
happened to me before.

790
00:40:28,892 --> 00:40:31,228
It's because they wanna
hang out with Calvin.

791
00:40:31,311 --> 00:40:32,980
Ginny doesn't care
if I work out.

792
00:40:34,189 --> 00:40:35,649
She does.

793
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:36,817
No, she doesn't.

794
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,194
She does.

795
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,364
Hey. No.

796
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:43,949
Pick it up.

797
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,034
[Calvin] <i>Given my major
in biochemical engineering</i>

798
00:40:46,118 --> 00:40:48,954
<i>and my parents' existing
employment at Kovi Industries.</i>

799
00:40:49,037 --> 00:40:50,706
<i>Not that I should be hired...</i>

800
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:53,625
<i>through nepotism or something
like that.</i>

801
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:55,335
<i>I just mean that maybe if I
could...</i>

802
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,713
- [Sophie] <i>Hey, relax.</i>
- <i>I am relaxed.</i>

803
00:40:57,796 --> 00:41:00,215
[Sophie] <i>You're doing fine.</i>

804
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:02,426
<i>Why don't you talk about how we use the same
tech on Earth to aid in waste reduction...</i>

805
00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:04,303
- <i>Sophie.</i>
- <i>...develop new bioplastics, and innovate...</i>

806
00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:07,097
- Sophie.
- <i>Please just focus on the camera.</i>

807
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:09,975
<i>If I deviate too much, they'll just
skip to the next applicant, okay?</i>

808
00:41:10,058 --> 00:41:11,935
[Sophie] <i>Sure. Rolling.</i>

809
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:14,104
[male voice] <i>Good night,
sweet passengers.</i>

810
00:41:14,188 --> 00:41:17,357
<i>May your dreams be filled with
the counting of electric sheep.</i>

811
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,569
[Ginny] <i>Hey!
You're coming to Mars?</i>

812
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:22,946
- <i>And then you go radio silent?</i>
- Mother...

813
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,656
- [Cornelia] Hello, Sophie.
- Privacy! Privacy!

814
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,533
- Wait! Are you watching porn?
- <i>You're coming to Mars?</i>

815
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,035
- What? No!
- Lights!

816
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,369
Pause. Just pause.

817
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,871
Play.

818
00:41:30,954 --> 00:41:34,458
<i>Hi. You're coming to Mars?</i>

819
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:37,127
<i>And then you go radio silent?</i>

820
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:38,962
<i>I don't know if you're
serious or not...</i>

821
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:42,049
- <i>but call me.</i>
- You logged in? Are you kidding?

822
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:45,302
I couldn't tell if Ginny was actually
excited that I was coming to Mars.

823
00:41:45,385 --> 00:41:47,596
I'm just trying to get
a more scientific answer.

824
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,558
You're using facial recognition software
to find out if your girlfriend likes you?

825
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,436
[male computer voice] <i>Likelihood
of romantic interest...</i>

826
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,771
- <i>82%.</i>
- Yeah!

827
00:41:55,854 --> 00:41:57,898
- Who was that?
- [Gary] <i>I am Gary.</i>

828
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:01,026
That's Cornelia. I reprogrammed her
name and voice to Gary. After Gary.

829
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:02,611
You can't do that.

830
00:42:02,694 --> 00:42:04,279
I'm lonely.
And you don't let me talk to anyone.

831
00:42:04,363 --> 00:42:06,657
No. You can't change things
without telling me, okay?

832
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,742
There's a plan
and we stick to the plan.

833
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:12,079
If we don't, we go to jail,
or we get ejected into the sun.

834
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,580
You can't just unilaterally
change things

835
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,749
because you're insecure
about your relationship.

836
00:42:15,832 --> 00:42:18,001
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you talking to me
or are you talking to Calvin right now?

837
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:19,419
What's that supposed to mean?

838
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,463
I didn't change your plans.
Calvin did.

839
00:42:21,547 --> 00:42:24,424
I didn't ditch you to go to
Mars for a job, Calvin did.

840
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:27,761
- I didn't refuse to send you nudes.
- [gasps]

841
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:28,971
Those texts were off-limits.

842
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:30,931
I saw them by accident.

843
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:34,101
Where are you going?

844
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,687
I saw Earl eating ice cream,
but they don't serve it in the cafeteria,

845
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,523
which means he's got his own little
supply that I'm gonna steal from

846
00:42:39,606 --> 00:42:42,484
because I am stressed.
And when I'm stressed, I need sugar.

847
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:43,443
No!

848
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,122
I work here!

849
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,957
Does that ever really work?

850
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,002
Most of the time, yeah.

851
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:01,461
We have to get out of here.

852
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:02,796
We are going to get caught.

853
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:05,507
You are the only person that
ever catches me.

854
00:43:05,591 --> 00:43:06,967
Okay. Okay.

855
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,261
If you're gonna be here,
you gotta pull your weight.

856
00:43:09,344 --> 00:43:12,055
I know you're not used to this sort
of sneaking around, espionage thing.

857
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:13,640
I am. I'm the expert here,

858
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,767
so I'm gonna be looking
for the refrigeration unit.

859
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:17,769
The cooling kind.

860
00:43:17,853 --> 00:43:19,062
Like that one?

861
00:43:21,857 --> 00:43:23,525
Okay. Come on.

862
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:26,653
Guess this means I'm kinda grounded
for the rest of the flight?

863
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,655
- Kinda.
- Copy that.

864
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,450
And can you please keep your opinions
about my relationship to yourself?

865
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:33,577
You've no idea what
we've been through.

866
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,162
[Carla] Hello, Sophie.

867
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,496
[Walt] You're right.

868
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,416
[Carla] Ambient sound
control activated.

869
00:43:39,499 --> 00:43:40,500
Sorry.

870
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:46,256
Okay. Apology accepted.

871
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,342
You know,
you're almost always right.

872
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,510
Even in those last three
arguments with Calvin.

873
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,304
And I know I shouldn't
have read them...

874
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:55,015
but you were right.

875
00:43:55,098 --> 00:43:58,352
It's honestly creepy and kind of
annoying how right you are all the time.

876
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:02,648
Especially as someone who is wrong
almost all the time. Never right.

877
00:44:02,731 --> 00:44:04,691
Well, except right now.

878
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,193
Me saying that you're right...

879
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:09,696
Okay. I got it. Thanks.
Now, let's go.

880
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,034
And you're totally right to lock me
in here for the rest of the trip.

881
00:44:14,117 --> 00:44:15,410
[sighs]

882
00:44:15,494 --> 00:44:17,663
But can we please start
my house arrest tomorrow?

883
00:44:19,164 --> 00:44:20,290
Why?

884
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,503
This is made out of algae?

885
00:44:27,422 --> 00:44:28,548
Smells like it.

886
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,634
This is pretty bad.

887
00:44:30,717 --> 00:44:32,219
It's awful.

888
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,553
Calvin would love it.

889
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:34,846
Okay, that's...

890
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:36,973
probably true.

891
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,685
I don't know how he does it.

892
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,687
Does what?

893
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:45,232
Super focused,
algae genius thing.

894
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,400
Like it's all he thinks about.

895
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,527
It's not all he thinks about.

896
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,737
Okay, well...

897
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,864
the great thing
about being Walt,

898
00:44:52,948 --> 00:44:57,077
is that he's not smart enough to think
about any one thing for too long.

899
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:00,580
I miss Walt. Good guy.

900
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:01,665
Handsome.

901
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,669
So, what about you and Ginny?

902
00:45:07,629 --> 00:45:09,339
What about us?

903
00:45:09,423 --> 00:45:12,467
You're flying to Mars for her.
You must have some sort of plan.

904
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:14,469
I don't know.

905
00:45:16,221 --> 00:45:18,807
I steal the spaceship...

906
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:20,934
travel the stars...

907
00:45:21,017 --> 00:45:22,394
adventure.

908
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,523
What?

909
00:45:26,606 --> 00:45:30,527
You've been on a spaceship, traveling
through the stars your entire life.

910
00:45:34,948 --> 00:45:36,199
Earth.

911
00:45:38,118 --> 00:45:40,287
In a billion years...

912
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:45,083
we will never build
or find anything quite like it.

913
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:48,086
It's our only spaceship.

914
00:45:50,672 --> 00:45:54,843
What could we possibly do out
here that we couldn't do there?

915
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:01,433
You ever worry the wrong person
is headed to the wrong planet?

916
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:03,518
Me and Calvin?

917
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:06,813
No.

918
00:46:07,856 --> 00:46:09,232
We'll be back.

919
00:46:09,316 --> 00:46:11,985
Once his contract
is up... [sighs]

920
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:14,613
First his turn, then my turn.

921
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:17,157
Right. The plan.

922
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,367
We're building a life together.

923
00:46:19,451 --> 00:46:23,830
And when you find something
extraordinary, you fight for it.

924
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,666
Sacrifice for it. Protect it.

925
00:46:27,626 --> 00:46:29,169
Yes.

926
00:46:29,252 --> 00:46:34,049
Because what most of us
fail to appreciate...

927
00:46:34,132 --> 00:46:39,513
when presented with something truly unique,
is that it will only ever exist once.

928
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,097
You read my thesis.

929
00:46:41,181 --> 00:46:42,891
I may have even understood it.

930
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:46,645
That is weirdly touching.

931
00:47:02,994 --> 00:47:04,371
That algae really
isn't sitting well.

932
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,748
Don't mention algae.

933
00:47:06,832 --> 00:47:08,667
[Tabby] Hello, peers.

934
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:12,546
Unfortunately, I've just learned
that our scheduled speaker,

935
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,756
Doctor Franklin Dearborn...

936
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,385
has come down with a mild case
of "space madness."

937
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:20,387
- Awesome.
- And his scheduled presentation

938
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:25,100
on the theoretical limits of quantum
propulsion is being rescheduled.

939
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:28,144
However, I was logging on to
one of the community terminals

940
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:32,482
and I came across this
fascinating thesis presentation.

941
00:47:33,608 --> 00:47:34,776
There it is.

942
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:37,487
Calvin Riggins...

943
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:39,489
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

944
00:47:39,573 --> 00:47:42,784
...is our very modest but very
accomplished expert in terraformation.

945
00:47:42,868 --> 00:47:44,369
And I'm hoping
he'll save the day

946
00:47:44,452 --> 00:47:46,580
by coming up here
and teaching us a bit

947
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:49,666
about how Mars will someday
be as green as Earth.

948
00:47:49,749 --> 00:47:52,377
Hopefully, greener,
as Earth is dying.

949
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:55,547
Come on up here, Calvin.

950
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:57,340
[applauding]

951
00:47:57,424 --> 00:48:00,302
- What do I do?
- I don't know. Maybe just riff.

952
00:48:00,385 --> 00:48:01,720
Isn't, like, talking
your superpower?

953
00:48:01,803 --> 00:48:02,971
Calvin!

954
00:48:03,054 --> 00:48:03,930
One second.

[all] Calvin! Calvin!

957
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,186
Give me one of your earbuds.
We'll use it like a walkie-talkie.

958
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,813
You can just tell me
what to say.

959
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:13,982
I left them in the room.

960
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:15,650
[woman] Get up here!

961
00:48:15,734 --> 00:48:17,819
Have them eject me
towards the sun.

962
00:48:17,903 --> 00:48:19,738
[woman] Calvin! All right,
here he comes!

963
00:48:19,821 --> 00:48:22,240
He's coming up!

964
00:48:22,324 --> 00:48:26,036
Don't worry.
If you get an erection, keep going.

965
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:27,245
[mic feedback buzzes]

966
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:34,085
Uh, hi.

967
00:48:36,671 --> 00:48:42,010
I'm Calvin.
I'm a terraformologist.

968

[audience chuckles softly]

969

[boy] Zinger!

970
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:48,350
Let's start with the basics.

971
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,977
Terraforming...

972
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:54,606
which comes from
the Latin term "Terra..."

973
00:48:54,689 --> 00:48:56,524
- Oh, God.
- ...meaning "Earth..."

974
00:48:56,608 --> 00:48:59,069
and forming...

975
00:48:59,152 --> 00:49:01,363
That's forming.

976
00:49:05,617 --> 00:49:08,411
"Changing Mars for us."

977
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:12,165
Changing for us.

978
00:49:14,834 --> 00:49:15,794
Changing...

979
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:25,011
Someone a lot smarter than me once
said that Mars is like our mirror.

980
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:28,682
The reflection of
what is deepest in our hearts.

981
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,558
Calvin, that's so true.

982
00:49:30,642 --> 00:49:33,061
After traveling with you guys
for the last few weeks,

983
00:49:33,144 --> 00:49:37,273
I don't really know
if that's true anymore.

984
00:49:37,357 --> 00:49:41,528
When I look at you,
I see the smartest people on the planet.

985
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,198
And you've spent
your entire lives

986
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:49,911
trying to check an impossible
set of boxes...

987
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:52,914
for Mars.

988
00:49:52,998 --> 00:49:54,708
And I get it.

989
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,669
Mars is awesome. I applied to
this program, like, 37 times.

990
00:49:57,752 --> 00:49:59,295
[all chuckling]

991
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:06,594
But maybe
when you find that thing

992
00:50:06,678 --> 00:50:09,556
that you're willing to cross the
entire universe to be with...

993
00:50:12,267 --> 00:50:14,853
just make sure it's ready
to do the same for you.

994
00:50:18,189 --> 00:50:20,275
Don't terraform yourself.

995
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,528
It's your life, too.

996
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:38,168
[computer]
<i>Thanks for listening!</i>

997
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:41,087
I'm done.

998
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,590
That was it? A little short.

999
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:45,216

1000
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,509
let's get married.

What?

1002
00:50:49,554 --> 00:50:51,806
I mean engaged to get married.

1003
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:56,394
Calvin's presentation, it was useless
from a technical perspective...

1004
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,898
but he's right.

1005
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:02,484
I should have
never put Mars before us.

1006
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:04,694
Before you.

1007
00:51:04,778 --> 00:51:06,780
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1008

Yes!

Listen up, everybody.

Hey.

1021

Did you make this?

1022
00:51:51,866 --> 00:51:53,701
I didn't pack a dress.

1023

You are so annoyingly
good at things.

1024
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:00,583
Coming from a guy that just
inspired an engagement party

1025

with a speech pulled from the
deepest recesses of his own ass.

Oh, this isn't
an engagement party.

1027
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:08,007
What are you talking about?

1028
00:52:09,425 --> 00:52:10,718
It's a birthday party.

1029
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,722
I don't do birthdays.

1030
00:52:16,015 --> 00:52:18,643
You also
don't fly on rockets

1031

or conspire with stowaways.

I think you just gotta face it.

You're a space criminal now.

Do you wanna get your parents
on a video call?

1043

My parents died when I was 14.

Well, Jan, actually.

It was just, "Here's your room."

"What are your favorite meals?"

whenever you are."

wouldn't go to a party like this.

01:07:44,276 --> 01:07:46,361
<i>Which has
never happened before.</i>

1258
01:07:46,445 --> 01:07:48,572
Listen, I need to
tell you something.

1259
01:07:52,409 --> 01:07:53,619
Wait...

1260
01:07:54,787 --> 01:07:56,038
Where are you?

1261
01:07:58,373 --> 01:08:01,835
<i>It was supposed to be
a surprise, but...</i>

1262
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,506
<i>Okay, check it out.</i>

1263
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:09,885
<i>This is your room.</i>

1264
01:08:12,387 --> 01:08:13,430
My room?

1265
01:08:13,514 --> 01:08:16,225
<i>It was Mom's idea.</i>

1266
01:08:16,308 --> 01:08:20,646
<i>My dad built
a soldering station.</i>

1267
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:23,482
<i>Brandon put together
a hydroponic garden.</i>

1268
01:08:26,485 --> 01:08:27,611
<i>And...</i>

1269
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:30,572
<i>and your folks.</i>

1270
01:08:30,656 --> 01:08:33,826
<i>Already moved in.
Just waiting on your arrival.</i>

1271
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,536
I love it.

1272
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:41,208
<i>I know I don't articulate
things well...</i>

1273
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:44,670
<i>sometimes, emotions, but...</i>

1274
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:46,255
I know.

1275
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:52,094
<i>You said you wanted
to tell me something?</i>

1276
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:53,720
No.

1277
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,181
I'll see you soon.

1278
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,975
<i>I'll see you when you land.</i>

1279
01:09:37,931 --> 01:09:39,224
Walt.

1280
01:09:40,934 --> 01:09:41,894
Huh?

1281
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:43,812
Tell me what you think.

1282
01:09:43,896 --> 01:09:46,064
I'm gonna hide in one of these
storage boxes with this O2 canister.

1283
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:49,276
When you find me,
in one of the storage units...

1284
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:50,527
in about...

1285
01:09:51,737 --> 01:09:52,821
two-and-a-half...

1286
01:09:52,905 --> 01:09:54,907
Let's say two hours,
just to be safe.

1287
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:56,658
I can't.

1288
01:09:56,742 --> 01:09:57,868
Are you afraid that
I'm gonna be dead?

1289
01:09:57,951 --> 01:09:59,203
No. Walt.

1290
01:09:59,286 --> 01:10:01,580
Look, if the box smells like
a dead body...

1291
01:10:01,663 --> 01:10:02,664
just keep walking.

1292
01:10:02,748 --> 01:10:04,833
I can't help you anymore.

1293
01:10:09,755 --> 01:10:10,797
I'm sorry.

1294
01:10:13,217 --> 01:10:15,093
But this is my life.

1295
01:10:16,762 --> 01:10:18,680
I can't risk it.

1296
01:10:18,764 --> 01:10:19,932
Calvin...

1297
01:10:21,266 --> 01:10:22,392
is here.

1298
01:10:23,435 --> 01:10:24,770
His family...

1299
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,397
My family is here.

1300
01:10:27,481 --> 01:10:29,066
And Ginny is here.

1301
01:10:29,149 --> 01:10:31,818
Stop acting like our situations
are even remotely the same.

1302
01:10:32,653 --> 01:10:33,779
Right.

1303
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,448
You're not supposed to be here.

1304
01:10:36,531 --> 01:10:39,326
And you are?
'Cause you can buy a ticket.

1305
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:42,996
That's not fair.

1306
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,289
You know what's not fair?

1307
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:46,667
Try getting this close
to your dreams

1308
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:47,876
and having someone tell you

1309
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,337
you're not good enough
37 times.

1310
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,256
Or meeting the girl
of your dreams

1311
01:10:52,339 --> 01:10:54,967
the night before she goes to
another planet, or having to work...

1312
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:56,218
Wait.

1313
01:10:56,301 --> 01:10:57,761
What?

1314
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:02,391
How long have you
and Ginny been together?

1315
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:04,851
Since freshmen year-ish.

1316
01:11:04,935 --> 01:11:06,561
How "ish"?

1317
01:11:10,524 --> 01:11:13,777
The night before she left
for Mars-ish.

1318
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,112
[breathing heavily]

1319
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:17,322
I'm gonna throw up.

1320
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,116
No, don't do that,
'cause then I'm gonna throw up.

1321
01:11:20,492 --> 01:11:24,162
I can't believe
how selfish you are.

1322
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:26,832
You are so obsessed

1323
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:28,917
with escaping
your average existence

1324
01:11:29,001 --> 01:11:33,547
that you would blow up my life,
her life, for what?

1325
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:35,882
For some sort of adventure?

1326
01:11:35,966 --> 01:11:37,676
For some stupid journal entry?

1327
01:11:37,759 --> 01:11:41,388
Sophie, I couldn't blow up
your life if I tried.

1328
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:43,015
You're living his life.

1329
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:45,058
[scoffs] That's ridiculous.

1330
01:11:45,142 --> 01:11:47,185
Do you think
he's gonna move for you?

1331
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:49,855
Do you think he's gonna go back
to Earth for you?

1332
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:52,357
That he's not going to get
offered a better job,

1333
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,693
and you're gonna go along
with it, like you always do?

1334
01:11:54,776 --> 01:11:56,320
You don't know
anything about him.

1335
01:11:56,403 --> 01:11:57,904
I actually do.

1336
01:11:58,905 --> 01:12:00,115
I've had to be him.

1337
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,037
He's never gonna
meet you halfway.

1338
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,080
He's never going to follow you.

1339
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:11,084
You're a coward, Sophie.

1340
01:12:15,589 --> 01:12:17,215
Someday...

1341
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:20,886
when that stupid journal
is filled...

1342
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:23,805
you're gonna flip through it
and realize

1343
01:12:23,889 --> 01:12:27,642
just how pointless it all was.

1344
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:34,483
Sophie...

1345
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:40,155
I'm here because
I am wanted here.

1346
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:54,878
You are here because no one
cares where you are.

1347

1355
01:14:52,245 --> 01:14:53,038
I missed you.

1356
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:54,247
[Sophie] I missed you.

01:15:13,058 --> 01:15:14,518
can you just leave?

1363
01:15:14,601 --> 01:15:15,685
[Ginny] Hey, stranger.

1364
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,898
What? How are you here?

1365
01:15:19,981 --> 01:15:21,066
I know a guy.

1366

You know a guy?

1367
01:15:24,027 --> 01:15:25,570
This is Edgar.

1368
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:27,072
'Sup?

1369
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:28,114
Hey, guy. [chuckles]

1370
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:30,200
Two minutes?

1371
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:36,039
He's awesome.

1372
01:15:36,122 --> 01:15:37,123
You know what?

1373
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:39,251
He is awesome.

1374
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:40,418
Wow. [chuckles]

1375
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,632
He is also my boyfriend.

My new boyfriend.

Oh.

1378
01:15:54,099 --> 01:15:55,392
You're dating my guard?

1379
01:15:55,475 --> 01:15:59,521
You followed me to Mars
after one night.

1380
01:15:59,604 --> 01:16:02,107
Kind of needed to start dating
a security guard.

1381
01:16:05,777 --> 01:16:07,153
Just to be clear...

1382
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:10,323
you're not here to rescue me?

1383
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:13,201
No.

1384
01:16:13,285 --> 01:16:15,996
But I did bring you
some company.

1385
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:21,960
Ripley?

1386
01:16:22,043 --> 01:16:23,878
Oh, my God. Hi.

1387
01:16:23,962 --> 01:16:26,506
What are you doing here?
I thought you were arrested.

1388

[knocking at door]

1389
01:16:31,261 --> 01:16:32,137
Time to go.

1390
01:16:41,479 --> 01:16:43,815
You'll be okay, Walt.

1391
01:16:43,898 --> 01:16:45,984
I mean, we both know
who you're really in love with.

1392
01:16:48,528 --> 01:16:49,654
Mars.

1393
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:50,572
Mars.

1394
01:16:51,281 --> 01:16:52,198
And you made it.

1395
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:55,452
More or less.

1396
01:17:04,377 --> 01:17:07,297
It says his application was
rejected like 100 times.

1397
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:09,299
- Wow, 100 times?
- 37.

1398
01:17:09,382 --> 01:17:12,761
I don't understand why someone would
wanna be somewhere they do not belong.

1399
01:17:12,844 --> 01:17:14,888
- Yeah, you've got a point.
- Well, I think it's exciting.

1400
01:17:14,971 --> 01:17:17,807
Did you and the stowaway
cross paths, Sophie?

1401
01:17:17,891 --> 01:17:19,100
- No.
- No?

1402
01:17:19,184 --> 01:17:21,144
[laughing] No.
He must've been hiding.

1403
01:17:21,227 --> 01:17:23,146
- Really?
- In the air ducts or something.

1404
01:17:23,229 --> 01:17:26,107
- Wow. Can you just imagine?
- That is so stupid.

1405
01:17:26,191 --> 01:17:28,318
So, any idea what
you're gonna do

1406
01:17:28,401 --> 01:17:29,694
now that you're here?

1407
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:32,280
I recommended her for a spot
on my team.

1408
01:17:32,364 --> 01:17:33,698
What?

1409
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:35,659
Well, they love you for it.

1410
01:17:35,742 --> 01:17:37,702
You're totally qualified and they're
always looking for young candidates

1411
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:39,371
who can carry out
the next phase.

1412
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:40,789
The next phase?

1413
01:17:40,872 --> 01:17:42,999
Yeah, the 12-year
life-cycle trials.

1414
01:17:57,055 --> 01:17:58,223
[Leon] Wake up, Walt.

[purring]

1416
01:18:05,772 --> 01:18:06,981
Did you just talk?

1417
01:18:08,274 --> 01:18:09,609
It's time to go.

1418
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:11,319
Gary?

1419
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,322
Is that you?

1420
01:18:14,406 --> 01:18:16,658
I didn't really think
the cat could talk.

1421
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:29,170
Clear?

1422
01:18:30,171 --> 01:18:31,131
[meowing]

1423
01:18:31,715 --> 01:18:32,549
Copy.

1424
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,723
[Leon] Come closer.

1425
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,641
Hello?

1426
01:18:51,776 --> 01:18:52,861
[meowing]

1427
01:18:53,778 --> 01:18:54,612
Okay.

1428
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:56,531
Ripley.

1429
01:19:13,214 --> 01:19:14,132
[Leon] Hello, Walt.

1430
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:21,473
Holy shit. It's you.

1431
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:22,849
Leon Kovi.

1432
01:19:22,932 --> 01:19:25,560
I have that same picture
right by my bed.

1433
01:19:25,643 --> 01:19:27,312
That sounded weird.

1434
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:30,148
I've thought about meeting you
for a really, really long time.

1435
01:19:32,609 --> 01:19:33,485
As have I.

1436
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:35,445
What?

1437
01:19:35,528 --> 01:19:37,322
I have been monitoring
your progress

1438
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:40,617
since you first entered
that escape pod back on Earth.

1439
01:19:43,995 --> 01:19:45,163
Oh, shit.

1440
01:19:45,246 --> 01:19:46,748
[man 1] <i>Bob,
you seeing this kid?</i>

1441
01:19:46,831 --> 01:19:48,333
[man 2] <i>Yep,
kid thinks he's invisible.</i>

1442
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:50,543
You have cameras everywhere?

1443
01:19:50,627 --> 01:19:53,463
[man 1] <i>Bob says,
everybody just act like you don't see him.</i>

1444
01:19:53,546 --> 01:19:55,381
[Walt] Why didn't
you arrest me?

1445
01:19:55,465 --> 01:19:57,884
Well, I ran a profile and the
risk of you impacting the journey

1446
01:19:57,967 --> 01:19:59,969
in a meaningful way
was below zero

1447
01:20:00,053 --> 01:20:02,555
which I didn't even think
was mathematically possible,

1448
01:20:02,639 --> 01:20:04,516
but it was,
it was a negative number, Walt.

1449
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:07,852
There was some concern that
you would die in the air ducts.

1450
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,688
And the smell
of your rotting carcass

1451
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:13,233
might disturb
some of the paying guests.

1452
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:15,235
Bets were made.

1453
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:16,778
I won.

1454
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:22,700
That girl had nothing
to do with it.

1455
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:26,871
- Walt!
- She did. But I forced her. Not, like, forced her.

1456
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:28,414
Blackmail. Light blackmail.

1457
01:20:28,498 --> 01:20:30,667
There is no such thing
as "light blackmail," okay?

1458
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:33,670
There's no diet blackmail.
You blackmailed her, it's fine.

1459
01:20:35,046 --> 01:20:36,923
So, what happens now?

1460
01:20:37,006 --> 01:20:41,594
Well, the board has voted to write
this off as a security systems test.

1461
01:20:41,678 --> 01:20:43,346
Ship you back to Earth

1462
01:20:43,429 --> 01:20:45,390
and tie you up
in so much legal trouble

1463
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:48,434
that the world at large
will never hear from you again.

1464
01:20:48,518 --> 01:20:51,145
[sighs] Can I at least get
my own escape pod?

1465
01:20:52,063 --> 01:20:54,607
Walt, I hate the board.

1466
01:20:54,691 --> 01:20:56,901
So, I leaked
the security footage.

1467
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:59,445
I shared your whole journey
with the world.

1468
01:20:59,529 --> 01:21:00,780
Oh. You what?

1469
01:21:00,864 --> 01:21:02,407
[Leon] It's become so popular.

1470
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,242
Look how happy it makes people.

1471
01:21:04,325 --> 01:21:06,661
I'm told it's called
"Walt-ing."

1472
01:21:06,744 --> 01:21:10,081
She's Walt-ing. He's Walt-ing.
They're all Walt-ing.

1473
01:21:10,164 --> 01:21:11,416
Walt-ing?

1474
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:12,876
I, myself, can't Walt.
I have a bad back.

1475
01:21:12,959 --> 01:21:15,086
But Alan here has Walted.
Haven't you, Alan?

1476
01:21:15,169 --> 01:21:18,423
I am hiding. I am a sneaky,
sneaky human boy.

1477
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:21,050
It's very, very fresh.

1478
01:21:21,134 --> 01:21:26,180
And now the board
is terrified of a PR backlash.

1479
01:21:27,181 --> 01:21:28,266
Please, sit.

1480
01:21:30,935 --> 01:21:33,354
You remind me
of a young me, Walt.

1481
01:21:33,438 --> 01:21:34,772
Emotionally, that is.

1482
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:36,858
Intellectually,
it's more of an apples to...

1483
01:21:38,151 --> 01:21:39,444
whatever a much
smarter fruit is.

1484
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:40,862
What's a smarter fruit, Walt?

1485
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:43,323
Papaya?

1486
01:21:43,406 --> 01:21:45,199
Papaya! Yes.

1487
01:21:45,283 --> 01:21:46,618
I'm the papaya.

1488
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:48,745
Do you know why the papaya
came to Mars, Walt?

1489
01:21:50,496 --> 01:21:51,789
Taxes?

1490
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:54,626
No, I'm a billionaire, Walt,
I don't pay taxes.

1491
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:58,254
I bet the papaya came for the exact
same reason as the simple little apple.

1492
01:21:59,130 --> 01:21:59,964
Love?

1493
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:02,216
Love? How old are you?

1494
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:04,385
No.

1495
01:22:04,469 --> 01:22:06,471
You wouldn't settle
for the relentless

1496
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:09,849
onslaught of the quotidian
that is life on Earth,

1497
01:22:09,933 --> 01:22:11,726
so you came here...

1498
01:22:11,809 --> 01:22:13,645
- [scoffs]
- to Mars.

1499
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:16,564
This is not just a playground
for the wealthy, Walt.

1500
01:22:16,648 --> 01:22:20,818
It's a continuation
of our species' rich history

1501
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:26,157
of curiosity and exploration.

1502
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:30,954
Now, we need the public and our
investors to understand that.

1503
01:22:31,037 --> 01:22:32,914
I think that you and I

1504
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:34,874
could help each other.

1505
01:22:35,625 --> 01:22:38,544
You, a barista.

1506
01:22:38,628 --> 01:22:39,712
Assistant barista.

1507
01:22:39,796 --> 01:22:41,839
A barista's assistant.

1508
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:44,676
Unremarkable in every way.

1509
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,762
Truly middle of-the-road,
by all metrics.

1510
01:22:47,845 --> 01:22:49,013
Okay, I got it.

1511
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:52,100
Stowing away
for an historic journey

1512
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:54,936
against impossible odds,

1513
01:22:55,019 --> 01:22:57,438
secretly facilitated by me,
of course,

1514
01:22:57,522 --> 01:23:02,443
to discover something that just might
make his meaningless little life

1515
01:23:02,527 --> 01:23:07,156
just a smidgeon,
just a tickle more meaningful.

1516
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:11,744
Now, that is a story
people wanna hear, Walt.

1517
01:23:13,997 --> 01:23:15,039
Oh, what's this?

1518
01:23:18,459 --> 01:23:20,169
Walt, this has your name on it.

1519
01:23:20,253 --> 01:23:22,046
- This is a contract.
- Contract?

1520
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:23,965
Ceding control of your likeness

1521
01:23:24,048 --> 01:23:26,884
to Kovi Industries
for exclusive use

1522
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:28,553
in promotional materials

1523
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:30,888
in perpetuity across all
universes, known and unknown.

1524
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:32,223
And in exchange...

1525
01:23:33,766 --> 01:23:34,892
you may stay here.

1526
01:23:35,893 --> 01:23:37,562
Are you serious?

1527
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:39,188

[Leon] Could I have solved world
hunger with my money, Walt?

1541
01:25:08,611 --> 01:25:10,696
Sure. Dozens of times over.

1542
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:14,158
But don't you think it's better
that I came to Mars

1543
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:17,036
to inspire the next generation
of young people

1544
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,038
- to solve world hunger?
- [Alan] Looking good, guys.

How handsome.

1546

[Walt] Hey, Gary.

1556
01:25:52,613 --> 01:25:54,031
What are they doing down there?

1557
01:25:54,115 --> 01:25:56,534
Preparing the return vessel
for launch.

1558
01:25:56,617 --> 01:25:58,870
At the conclusion
of each orbital cycle,

1559
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:02,748
the humans celebrate their
domination of this lifeless planet.

1560
01:26:02,832 --> 01:26:04,292
After the festivities,

1561
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:07,378
broken objects of little value
are sent back to Earth

1562
01:26:07,461 --> 01:26:09,547
for long-term storage.

1563
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:11,299
You mean, garbage?

1564
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:13,509
Yes.

1565
01:26:13,593 --> 01:26:14,886
Like sexual reproduction,

1566
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:17,805
making garbage brings humans
great happiness.

1567
01:26:17,889 --> 01:26:20,558
But looking at it
causes deep shame.

1568
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:22,602
It must be hidden.

1569
01:26:24,729 --> 01:26:28,024
Are we supposed to be here?

1570
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,651
No.

1571
01:26:30,735 --> 01:26:34,572
I have asked you to return
to the habitat 11 times.

1572
01:26:34,655 --> 01:26:35,573
All right, Gary.

1573
01:26:36,449 --> 01:26:37,450
You win.

1574
01:26:37,533 --> 01:26:38,659
I am Victor.

1575
01:26:56,093 --> 01:26:57,053

1576
01:27:06,395 --> 01:27:08,522
Hey, Ga... Victor?

1577
01:27:08,606 --> 01:27:09,607
Yes, Walt?

1578
01:27:12,109 --> 01:27:13,444
I'm gonna need some tools.

1579
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:20,243
I don't even understand
why you wanna go to this thing.

1580
01:27:22,078 --> 01:27:23,955
It's the return party.

1581
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:25,206
It's gonna be fun.

1582
01:27:25,289 --> 01:27:27,375
Plus, you can't work
all the time.

1583
01:27:28,167 --> 01:27:29,961
Which reminds me,

1584
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:31,963
when can I tell them
you can start?

1585
01:27:33,256 --> 01:27:34,131
Start what?

1586
01:27:36,092 --> 01:27:37,593
The job.

1587
01:27:37,677 --> 01:27:39,178
With my team.

I don't know
if it's the right fit.

1589
01:27:43,975 --> 01:27:44,809
Um...

1590
01:27:48,562 --> 01:27:51,983
It's the perfect fit.

1591
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:53,734
I mean, it's the same schedule.

1592
01:27:53,818 --> 01:27:56,237
I still have to finish
my thesis anyway so...

1593
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,322
Yes, I know,

1594

but, well,
you don't need it anymore.

1595

You're here.

01:28:03,744 --> 01:28:05,579
You have a job offer.

1597
01:28:05,663 --> 01:28:09,500
You can graduate without it.
You know, it's the past.

1598
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:10,668
It's not the past.

1599
01:28:13,045 --> 01:28:14,380
It's supposed to be the future.

1600

Oh! It almost came
to that, honey, trust.

I voted to eject you,

You knew the whole time too?

1608
01:28:50,499 --> 01:28:53,127
Walt, I have an IQ of 165

1609
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:56,339
and I can pilot a four
billion-dollar spaceship...

1610
01:28:56,422 --> 01:28:59,675
Through an asteroid belt. Yeah.

1611
01:28:59,759 --> 01:29:00,801
I'm sorry.

1612
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:03,346
It's okay.

1613
01:29:04,388 --> 01:29:08,476
So, how you enjoying Mars?

1614
01:29:08,559 --> 01:29:11,979
Honestly, I thought
it would be different.

1615
01:29:12,063 --> 01:29:13,814
I thought that I would get here

1616
01:29:13,898 --> 01:29:17,151
and I would be changed
or something.

1617

But now I'm here

No, bitch.
That is a very common phrase.

01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:34,213
My records indicate she has
already boarded the ship.

1738
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:16,380
[sighs softly]

1739
01:37:16,463 --> 01:37:18,882
[Walt] Oh, it stinks in here.

1740
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:21,009
This ship smells so bad.

1741
01:37:22,094 --> 01:37:23,720
Walt.

1742
01:37:23,804 --> 01:37:25,389
Actually it makes sense.
It's literally filled with garbage.

1743
01:37:25,472 --> 01:37:27,558
Sir, that seat is for
authorized personnel only.

1744
01:37:27,641 --> 01:37:29,685
I know, I'm sorry. Okay.

1745
01:37:29,768 --> 01:37:31,270
Wait, how do I...

1746
01:37:31,353 --> 01:37:33,397
- It's the button directly...
- I can't see.

1747
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,357
- Sorry.
- Just hold the button. No, no, no.

1748
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,442
Just hold the down button.
The same thing you did to get here.

1749
01:37:37,526 --> 01:37:40,863
I got it. Sorry. I got it.
[laughing]

1750
01:37:47,286 --> 01:37:48,328
Expect a fine.

1751
01:37:50,122 --> 01:37:50,956
Really?

1752
01:37:58,005 --> 01:37:58,881
Walt?

1753
01:38:00,048 --> 01:38:00,924
Sophie?

1754
01:38:02,009 --> 01:38:03,093
What are you doing here?

1755
01:38:05,846 --> 01:38:06,930
I'm following you.

1756
01:38:10,893 --> 01:38:12,352
Back to Earth.

1757
01:38:12,436 --> 01:38:14,563
Even though
I didn't invite you,

1758
01:38:14,646 --> 01:38:17,733
or even tell you I was leaving.

1759
01:38:17,816 --> 01:38:20,068
Making it
all the more romantic?

1760
01:38:20,152 --> 01:38:24,156
You literally did the exact same
thing for another girl last month.

1761
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:25,616
Okay, yes.

1762
01:38:25,699 --> 01:38:29,411
I did recently travel across
the universe for love.

1763
01:38:29,494 --> 01:38:31,538
No, no, not love.

1764
01:38:31,622 --> 01:38:32,915
You barely knew that girl.

1765
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:36,293
Correct.

1766
01:38:36,376 --> 01:38:37,711
But I do know you.

1767
01:38:37,794 --> 01:38:42,174
You're the most
frustratingly, brilliantly,

1768
01:38:42,257 --> 01:38:44,051
- contradictorily...
- Not a word.

1769
01:38:44,134 --> 01:38:46,887
...annoyingly talented person
I've ever met.

1770
01:38:46,970 --> 01:38:51,642
Every time I'm with you,
you make me feel so dumb.

1771
01:38:51,725 --> 01:38:52,851
[chuckles]

1772
01:38:52,935 --> 01:38:54,686
In the best way possible.

1773
01:38:56,229 --> 01:39:01,610
I'd rather be Mars's garbage
flying back to Earth

1774
01:39:01,693 --> 01:39:05,113
than boring old Walt,

1775
01:39:05,197 --> 01:39:07,366
flipping rocks on Mars alone.

1776
01:39:10,661 --> 01:39:13,497
So you're really gonna give up
this whole Mars adventure thing?

1777
01:39:16,375 --> 01:39:18,085
I'm not giving up anything.

1778
01:39:19,753 --> 01:39:20,921
You're the adventure.

1779
01:39:22,798 --> 01:39:24,883
Ah! Goddammit.

1780
01:39:25,676 --> 01:39:26,510
What?

1781
01:39:31,473 --> 01:39:33,934
You come in here
with no plan at all

1782
01:39:34,017 --> 01:39:37,312
just expecting everything
to magically work out

1783
01:39:37,396 --> 01:39:38,480
and then somehow,

1784
01:39:38,563 --> 01:39:41,108
you pull that line
out of your ass?

1785
01:39:44,277 --> 01:39:45,112
Yeah.

1786
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:48,031
You are so annoying.

1787
01:39:48,115 --> 01:39:48,949
I know.
