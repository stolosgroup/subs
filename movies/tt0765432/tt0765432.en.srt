2
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:50,833
Hey! Come on,
Mouse, out of the water!

3
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:56,167
Oh, Mama. A little longer.
- I said out! Right now!

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,958
You're both completely blue!

5
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:13,208
They're pretty.
- Who are they?

6
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:17,583
The Shah of Iran and his wife.
- Ah, my three Graces.

7
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:21,833
Papa, what is a Shah?
- Sort of like a king.

8
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:26,417
A Shah may cut off the
head of anyone he dislikes.

9
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:30,792
Don't tell the children such rubbish.
- The Truth is Simple.

10
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:34,958
With such power, there is no joke.
- Hallo, Klaus.

11
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:39,083
And? How goes the Revolution?
- Right now, it's on holiday.

12
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:43,000
Will you to come to our party tonight?
- Certainly.

13
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:45,292
Well, until then.
- Yes.

14
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,833
Ah, Klaus, not now.

15
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:02,708
Yeah, sure, OK.
- It makes me nervous.

16
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:06,875
Yes, but not very much.
So cheer up.

17
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,833
The royal couple landed at 11.05...

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,125
in a private plane
at Tempelhof airport.

19
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:20,000
Empress Farah wore a fox-fur coat
and a black and white hat.

20
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,000
Stefan!

21
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,000
Stefan!

22
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:28,667
The Shah inspected an
honour-guard of the Berlin Police.

23
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,625
Stefan, dear friend.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,083
Fresh off the presses.

25
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:49,542
OK.

26
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,500
For all to hear.

27
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:59,750
My clever star-journalist wife...

28
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:04,625
wrote an open letter
to her imperial highness Farah Diba.

29
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,417
Don't make a big deal of it.
- It'll be in the next edition.

30
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:16,292
5000 of these fliers are
already at the universities.

31
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:18,250
Very good.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,875
Good day, Mrs Pahlevi. There's a story
in the New Review about life in Iran,

33
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:29,333
about how hot it gets there,
and how you, like most Persians,

34
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,167
like to holiday on the Caspian coast.

35
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Like most Persians?
Isn't that an exaggeration?

36
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:42,583
Most Persians are farmers,
and make less than 100 Marks a year.

37
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,083
And half of all Persian
mothers die giving birth.

38
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:50,708
From hunger, poverty and illness.

39
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:55,042
And the children work
14-hour days weaving carpets.

40
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:59,917
Do most of them really holiday
with you at the Caspian seaside?

41
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:04,250
They write:
"The Shah must have a son. "

42
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:08,583
Iranian Law is
very strict on that point.

43
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:13,083
Strange that it seems so
unimportant to the Shah.

44
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:17,333
And no official statement is made.

45
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:21,667
That the Minister of Justice
makes no comment.

46
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:26,167
That unofficial courts
are held in secret.

47
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:30,417
That torture is allowed
under Persian law.

48
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,750
We do not want to insult you.

49
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:37,167
But the German public
should not be insulted

50
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,500
with crap like this
story in the New Review.

51
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,708
Faithfully,
Ulrike Meinhof.

52
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:08,833
Welcome, Pahlevi!
- Princess, Princess!

53
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,250
Farah! Farah Diba!

54
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,250
Murderer!

55
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,750
Are they crazy?

56
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,958
Murderer!

57
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:06,125
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

58
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,458
Don't push me, you wanker!

59
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,333
Stop!

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,375
Is there a doctor here?
Let us through!

61
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:29,000
It's out of control here.
Are you stupid? There, the woman!

62
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:33,250
Can you help us?
We have an injured person here.

63
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,458
What happened?

64
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,750
He was attacking me.
- You are mad?

65
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:10,333
Let's go.

66
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:28,875
He needs a physician!

67
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:37,167
Mrs Meinhof, they were not on
the demonstrators' side. Why?

68
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:44,625
The right-wing press blamed
the disaster on the students.

69
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,625
Above all the Springer group
tried, in its newspaper,

70
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:54,417
to label the students as rioters.

71
00:08:54,542 --> 00:09:00,042
"To shout is no longer enough,
now they want blood. "

72
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,208
But the truth is,

73
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,750
the protest proved that
we live in a Police state.

74
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:12,000
That the Police and the press
went too far in Berlin on June 2nd.

75
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:16,458
And that the only freedom
here is for the Police.

76
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:20,542
But Mrs Meinhof, with all respect...
- We all know that Kurras...

77
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:24,833
...who shot Ohnesorg, will be acquitted.

78
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:29,208
That is pure demagogy!
That is demagogy.

79
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:33,708
In America they discuss using
nuclear weapons in Vietnam,

80
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:38,042
and Israel starts a war of
aggression with the help of the USA.

81
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:42,375
which is called "preventive war" here.
- Israel has to defend itself.

82
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,875
Then Hitler's attacks on Poland
and Russia were also "preventive".

83
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:53,667
But you can't say that!
- Mrs Meinhof, I must say...

84
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:57,292
You must also consider the child.

85
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,708
This woman has nothing worthwhile to say.

86
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:05,000
The American Imperialist
machine will not stop!

87
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:08,750
Vietnam, Bolivia and now the Near East.

88
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,958
America has supplied
Israel with weapons for years.

89
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:17,542
Each warplane, each rocket,
each tank, everything comes from the USA.

90
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:22,167
Or the western industrial nations.
- They are not the people's friends!

91
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:26,500
The pigs want to control the
oil fields of the Near East.

92
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,833
It's just shit to them if
many thousands of people die.

93
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,083
I must now go to church.
- You should preach...

94
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:39,542
that over half the people in the world
do not have enough to eat.

95
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:43,792
Is it senseless to
preach for a better world?

96
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:48,250
That those condemned once again must resist!

97
00:10:57,292 --> 00:11:00,250
You should get married soon.

98
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,667
Ulrike! Wait!

99
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,417
Wait!

100
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,000
Finally.

101
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,500
Hello, Baby.
- Well, Kitty?

102
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:09,708
So, here it is.
I hope it's enough.

103
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,792
Will it be enough?
- Why?

104
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,833
So...
- Hey!

105
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,667
I think... we don't want to
torch the department store

106
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:39,083
We need hard action to show
that wanker that we're not kidding!

107
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:43,750
And if people are still inside?
- Don't talk like a homo, Tussi.

108
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:48,792
Who'd be there at night?
And if there is: a bigger headline!

109
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,417
Are you insane?
- Andreas knows what he's doing.

110
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,583
You're under arrest!
- Police! Halt!

111
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:20,083
Idiot!
- Police!

112
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,125
Handcuff them!
- You're under arrest for arson.

113
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,000
Good morning.

114
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:34,167
Under continuous bombardment
by American warplanes...

115
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:39,625
of alleged Vietcong positions,
civilian populations suffer the most.

116
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,042
In the USA, particularly at
universities, these pictures led...

117
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:48,417
the students to rise up in protest.
In the Federal Republic...

118
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:52,917
thousands of students protest,
such as these, in Berlin.

119
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:58,000
The Anarchist Rudi Dutschke
mobilizes the resistance.

120
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:01,625
Comrades, we don't have much time.

121
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:07,667
In Vietnam the bombs fall every day.
We must stand up for them.

122
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,625
As Che said: It is not a matter of
wishing success to the victim of aggression,

123
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,417
but of sharing his fate.

124
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:22,125
One must accompany him
to his death or to victory.

125
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,917
From German ground...

126
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:36,167
From German ground
wars are still prepared.

127
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,625
From German ports and miltary bases...

128
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:45,750
The American military
wages the Vietnam war!

129
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,667
We cannot allow this!

130
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,167
We must stop the German government

131
00:14:56,333 --> 00:15:01,542
helping this Imperialist war in Viet Nam!

132
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,625
Are you Ulrike Meinhof?
- Yes.

133
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,833
We are forced to take illegal action...

134
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,250
let sabotage and blockades start now!

135
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,083
We protest against this conference!

136
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,708
Ladies and Gentlemen,
this conference is terminated!

137
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,083
Are you Rudi Dutschke?

138
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:55,333
Yes, I am.
- You dirty communist pig!

139
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,167
I am dead. Let me live.

140
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,917
Father. Mother.

141
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,417
Soldier... Soldier...

142
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,667
He's down here!
He went down here somewhere.

143
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:05,042
Search the building site.
- Covering!

144
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:31,250
You are surrounded!
Come out with hands up!

145
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,250
I can't stand communists.

146
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:39,167
Rudi Dutschke is in critical condition
after two hours of emergency surgery today.

147
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:43,542
Only one of the two bullets
could be removed from his head.

148
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:48,958
Spontaneous demonstrations
have sprung up across the country,

149
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:53,208
blaming the Springer publishing house
for inciting the assasination attempt.

150
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:57,083
Springer, Murderer!

151
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:33,333
I didn't think this was your style!

152
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,083
Attention, this is the Police!

153
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:56,750
You are trespassing
on private property.

154
00:19:56,917 --> 00:20:00,000
Leave the area immediately!

155
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:03,042
Come along!

156
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:12,500
Frau Meinhof? What are you doing here?
Release her. Frau Meinhof is a journalist.

157
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,458
Dresden!

158
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,375
Hiroshima!

159
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,000
Vietnam!

160
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,917
Dresden!

161
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,667
Hiroshima!

162
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,333
Vietnam!

163
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:42,125
Che Guevara was captured...

164
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:47,125
and then murdered by the CIA...

165
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:53,000
Yesterday Martin Luther King
was assasinated...

166
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,417
...Senator Robert Kennedy was shot...

167
00:20:56,542 --> 00:21:00,792
Republican Richard Nixon becomes
the 37th President of the USA

168
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:05,625
Soldiers sealed off the street
and fired into the crowd.

169
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,917
One of the first Soviet vehicles
into Czechoslovakia...

170
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:15,542
The students call the protests
in Paris cultural revolution.

171
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,667
The state calls it anarchy.

172
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:23,125
The more I hear of this shouting,

173
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,375
the clearer it becomes - we need
to ensure the rule of law in this country.

174
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,750
In agreement with Andreas Baader
I want to make a statement.

175
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:36,833
He and I placed the bomb
in the department store.

176
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:42,667
We did it to protest
against the indifference...

177
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,125
of people who sit and watch
the genocide in Vietnam.

178
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:58,292
We believe that speech
without action is wrong.

179
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,583
Order, please!

180
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:10,083
Order, please!

181
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,167
Mr Mahler?

182
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:18,542
Could you do us the honour of
allowing the court to share the joke?

183
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:23,875
The judges can hardly understand
the ideas Ms Ensslins and Mr Baader.

184
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,208
Otherwise they would take off their
robes and join the protests themselves.

185
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,000
Order!

186
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,292
Order, please!

187
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:42,000
Mr Ensslin, your daughter wanted to
address your generation with her act.

188
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:45,292
Whatever they wanted to do,
it comes to this:

189
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,583
Our generation experienced,
in the name of the people,

190
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:56,083
concentration camps, Jew hate, genocide,

191
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:01,292
and now will not permit
reformation, a new beginning.

192
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,250
How do you explain that,
with the world as it is?

193
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:14,000
It's amazing that Gudrun, who considers
things very rationally and intelligently,

194
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:16,833
by one foolish act, experienced

195
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:24,625
a holy self implementation.

196
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:29,000
I feel that she created
something free with her act.

197
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:33,333
Even in the family.
I feel liberated.

198
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:38,167
Of a tightness and a fear,
that had ruled my life before.

199
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,583
It took the fear from me.

200
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:51,917
<i>Throw a single stone,
and that is a crime.</i>

201
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:56,875
<i>Throw a thousand stones
and that is a political action.</i>

202
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,250
<i>Set fire to a car,
that is a crime.</i>

203
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:06,750
<i>Burn a thousand cars,
and that is a political act.</i>

204
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:13,083
<i>Protest is saying:
"I disagree with this and that. "</i>

205
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,792
<i>Resistance is saying:</i>

206
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:21,083
<i>"I will put a stop to this and that. "</i>

207
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:29,958
Thanks for making this possible.
- It's OK. I've read your work.

208
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:41,000
Can one stop the genocide in Vietnam by
burning down a department store?

209
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:46,458
No. It was an error,
as I said in court.

210
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:52,917
It was an act of rebellion.
But it was pointless...

211
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:56,125
while Fascism grows
as strong as it was under Hitler.

212
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:01,625
This time we offer resistance.
Out of responsibility before history.

213
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:07,042
People, here and in America,
must eat. Must eat and buy.

214
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:13,833
But they do not think
about it, they just consume.

215
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:18,917
We wanted them to
think about it a little.

216
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:22,250
So you burned down
a department store?

217
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:26,625
I will never resign myself
to doing nothing. Never.

218
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,167
If people try to murder us,
like Ohnesorg und Dutschke,

219
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:35,042
then we will shoot back.
That is only consistent.

220
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,625
Do you really mean that?

221
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:43,667
All over the world
comrades fight with guns in hand.

222
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,958
We must become soldiers.
- We fight already.

223
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:52,292
And if the fascists throw
you into prison for it?

224
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,500
Such victims they'll have.

225
00:25:55,625 --> 00:26:01,292
Or do you believe that you'll change
something with your grand theory?

226
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:08,625
Sorry, I didn't mean to be cruel.

227
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:32,917
Is Baader or Gudrun here?
- Gudrun is up there.

228
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:45,250
Oh! Sorry!
- Hello. Who are you?

229
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:50,708
I'm Peter Boock.
- And I'm Gudrun.

230
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:53,958
Are you a runaway?

231
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:57,250
Youth Training Centre.
- There are others here, too.

232
00:26:57,458 --> 00:27:01,583
They'll soon come and join us.
They gather up here.

233
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:07,250
Can I bathe afterwards?
- Bathe now.

234
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,125
No water wasting here.
Tell me about yourself.

235
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:23,917
Where did you get that?
- Youth Training Centre. Lucky City.

236
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:42,333
I heard about it.
You nearly burned the place down.

237
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:46,667
The bastards nearly
beat us to death for it.

238
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:52,125
If they catch me,
no more day leave till I turn 21.

239
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,333
Don't let it worry you.
You're part of our family now.

240
00:27:56,458 --> 00:28:01,000
You were locked up for arson, too.

241
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:04,208
But we are free on appeal.

242
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,625
And at least we can make an appeal.

243
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:12,083
And so we make it.
- And if they find me?

244
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:17,333
Andreas and I must disappear,
if our appeal is rejected.

245
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:27,667
Tell me... do I see right?
You trying to fuck my old lady?

246
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:39,583
Well, Kitty?

247
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:42,708
Hey.

248
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,583
Andreas, this is Peter.

249
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:57,583
What happened to you?
- The staff at Lucky City.

250
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:02,667
Then we should tear them some new arseholes.

251
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:05,458
Great leather jacket!

252
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:10,292
Here, it's yours.

253
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:15,375
Let's go! To Darmstadt!
- We don't have enough cars.

254
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,917
Then we'll steal two or three.

255
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:02,250
Only the gun cures the rigidity.

256
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,417
Go on, fire at will!

257
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,917
Fire at will!

258
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:31,375
We have made
extraordinary efforts...

259
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:37,750
to understand what the people want.
We want more democracy.

260
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:42,417
These words of the new Federal Chancellor
Willy Brandt as he takes office...

261
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:47,708
reconcile the students and end
nearly 3 years continuous riots.

262
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:52,958
The reform promises to create
peace at the universities, and the basis

263
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:58,125
to bring the outside parliamentary
opposition into the democratic process.

264
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:02,417
And what do you believe?
- I think the worst is over.

265
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:07,625
The protest movement
has lost its momentum.

266
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:13,042
Groups which feel existentially oppressed

267
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,833
will not hesitate

268
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,667
to bomb whatever parts of
society they see as oppressive.

269
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:35,750
Over here!
Can't you see us?

270
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:38,542
Gudrun?

271
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:43,125
Andreas... Hallo, Astrid.
- Mister Counsellor.

272
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:50,250
And? What are your plans?
What's next for you?

273
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:54,875
Can't you talk normally? Do you
really think Interpol are after us?

274
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,833
...because those jerks
in Frankfurt rejected our appeal?

275
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,875
We're not going back to prison.

276
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:06,292
Then come to Berlin. Illegally.
We're building up a new group.

277
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:11,708
We're further along than you'd think.
What have your guys done?

278
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:16,042
A lot's happened since you've been away.
We have good contacts.

279
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:20,417
Houses, ID, money, weapons.
We can provide everything.

280
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:25,500
Yeah, under your leadership.
The illegal underground attorney.

281
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:29,750
I'm shitting myself.
- Let him finish.

282
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:35,167
They couldn't steal grandma's puppy!
- That's not the point.

283
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:38,500
Where's Dutschke now?
- Living in London.

284
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:42,125
He's crippled, can hardly speak.

285
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:46,667
Since he was shot, nobody leads
while the struggle goes on.

286
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:52,208
The struggle would have been won,
if they hadn't screwed it up.

287
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:58,375
Show us what you're made of.
Steal the purse from granny's bag.

288
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:02,208
Baby...
- I want to know if he's got the balls.

289
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:07,875
Or is it all just talk?

290
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:37,083
Oh, man!

291
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:41,542
Fucking shit, they're stealing my car!

292
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:45,792
Hey! Stop!
Fucking spagetti-muncher!

293
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:51,458
Shit! You dumb bitch,
you left the car open again!

294
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:55,708
So what? Steal a new one.
- You CUNT!

295
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:58,750
CUNT! FUCK IT ALL!

296
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,167
WHY?

297
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,708
What are you doing here? Why us?

298
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,208
So call the cops.

299
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,208
Where's Ulrike?
- In bed.

300
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:25,417
Where's the bedroom?
- Back there.

301
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,667
Wait a minute.

302
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:33,958
Quiet, you'll wake the children.

303
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:57,500
We're back.

304
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:06,250
They're hunting you, you know.
- Big deal.

305
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:10,042
Can we stay here for a while?
- Yes, of course.

306
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:15,083
We're recruiting here
in Berlin. And in other cities.

307
00:35:15,292 --> 00:35:19,542
We're expanding the group.
Political conditions change.

308
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:23,792
What are your plans?
- What kind of stupid question is that?

309
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,167
We take action.
If it goes wrong, too bad.

310
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:37,292
So, that's it for me.
Where can I crash?

311
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:43,875
I'll join you in a moment.

312
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:48,750
What does he mean, though?
- He means exactly what he said.

313
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:53,083
Andreas does not compromise.
You must understand that.

314
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:57,417
Andreas is more of a revolutionary
than all the rest of us together.

315
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:00,583
Sounds great when you're stoned.

316
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:05,500
You look unhappy.

317
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:10,833
I saw a film about Youth Homes.
Girls there are treated like shit.

318
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,167
I thought I could do something
about it, but they remain shitty.

319
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,958
But Peggy there escaped.

320
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,833
What we need is a new morality.

321
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:28,167
You must see that clearly.

322
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:32,417
Draw a line between you and our enemies.

323
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:38,083
You must leave the system
and burn your bridges.

324
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:43,583
And your son?
That you may never see again?

325
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:49,042
If you're serious,
you have to be prepared to suffer.

326
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:56,250
Andreas also has a baby daughter.

327
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:00,792
I could never leave my children.

328
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,917
Shit.

329
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,958
Do you know how fast you were going?
- No. Do you?

330
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,792
Show me your license, please.

331
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:01,250
And the registration papers, please.

332
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:07,542
I'm sorry about this, officer.

333
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,750
My friend seems to have thrown them out.

334
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:18,542
You live in Rome, Mr Hoger?
- Yes.

335
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:23,583
Your date of birth?
- 14/6 nineteen...

336
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,083
'39.

337
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:32,167
You don't seem too sure about it.
- It was a long time ago.

338
00:38:36,917 --> 00:38:38,375
And?

339
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,583
They're holding him in Moabit jail.

340
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:46,833
We have to get him out.
- I'll help.

341
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:49,875
Me too.

342
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:53,417
How? Tying sheets together?

343
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:58,875
You can write about it afterwards.
That's all you're good for.

344
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:03,250
Perhaps Andreas should
just serve the ten months.

345
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:08,917
Shit! Freeing Prisoners is
what we're always talking about.

346
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:14,250
We'll show the pigs what we can do,
if they lock up our people.

347
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:17,375
We're getting Andy out! Now!

348
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:24,083
We can't visit him in prison anyway.

349
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:30,542
You'll be a publisher.
We'll get in with a book contract.

350
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,417
Good day.

351
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:44,042
This is Dr Gretel Weitemeier,
who will be publishing our book.

352
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:48,292
Pleased to meet you.
- The pleasure's all mine.

353
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,167
Are you insane?

354
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,375
Man, it only fires tear gas.
Looks real though, eh?

355
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:11,667
Where did you get that?
- from Gudrun.

356
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:17,250
We've got a lot of things, now.
- And who is "we"?

357
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,542
I cannot say.

358
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,125
Well, I can:
Gudrun, Astrid, Ingrid.

359
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,083
I bought some Asprin.
- Ulrike.

360
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:34,250
She's only the decoy.

361
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:38,125
You told me you
wouldn't be involved!

362
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:41,625
What is your part? Well?

363
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:48,000
Mahler arranged for Andreas and I
to visit the Sociological Institute...

364
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:52,375
to research our book.
- They're allowing him out for that?

365
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,625
With a Police escort, of course.
- That's where we come in.

366
00:40:56,833 --> 00:41:01,375
Inside the Institute,
we stick guns in the cops' faces...

367
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,625
and away runs Baader.
- And you?

368
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:08,000
I stand back and look surprised. That's all.

369
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:11,250
Now can we get on with dinner?

370
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:17,583
But you're all female.
What if they don't take you seriously?

371
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:22,958
Mahler knows some professionals.
We'll have help. Mahler says...

372
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:27,333
it'll be a piece of cake.
- I don't believe it.

373
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:31,583
The cops have real guns,
not like that piece of junk.

374
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:37,083
This is completely insane!

375
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:40,625
I have to go through with it.

376
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:06,125
Mr Baader, in the event of an
escape attempt, we are authorised to shoot.

377
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,875
I want to make sure you know that.
- You needn't worry about it.

378
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:30,000
I've seen you on TV.
- Hopefully I was interesting.

379
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:34,667
Yes, very. Anything else you need?
- Thanks, I'll manage.

380
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,250
Hey.
- Hey.

381
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:52,708
Sit down here.

382
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,417
Can I get a cup of coffee?
- Of course.

383
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:08,042
Are you married? Do you have any children?
- Yes, wife and child.

384
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:20,458
So, moving along. We have...

385
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:27,875
I told you yesterday,
come back after noon today.

386
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,958
The reading room is occupied.
- Then we'll wait here.

387
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:36,167
It's a long wait.
- We have time.

388
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,833
In the following discussion...

389
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:30,417
Go, quick. Let's move.
- What do you want here?

390
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,917
Shit!

391
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:40,167
Hands up!
- Up against the wall!

392
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,292
C'mon, Kitty!

393
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:54,583
Gudrun! Help me!

394
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:59,917
Stay down!

395
00:45:47,917 --> 00:45:53,125
According to reports the kidnappers
shot the doorman with tear gas

396
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:59,417
They overpowered the guards
and released Baader by force of arms.

397
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,625
My God, the children!

398
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:07,167
Go, children, run.

399
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:13,875
Quickly.

400
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:20,750
<i>We say: The uniform-wearer
is a pig, not a human.</i>

401
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:26,125
<i>And so we treat it as such.
We will not negotiate with them.</i>

402
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:30,417
<i>It is wrong to talk
at all with these people.</i>

403
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:35,833
<i>And of course, they may be shot
when we consider it necessary.</i>

404
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,708
<i>The gun makes its statement.
It is possible,</i>

405
00:46:41,042 --> 00:46:46,167
<i>in our actions, our enemies
may occasionally triumph.</i>

406
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:49,833
<i>But where it is important,
they will not beat us.</i>

407
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,625
<i>Our success will belong to history.</i>

408
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:52,250
Welcome to the camp!
- The attorney looks like Fidel Castro!

409
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:56,833
Welcome, Andreas. Hi, Gudrun.
- Which way to Havana?

410
00:47:57,042 --> 00:48:01,167
This is Achmed, the Commander.
This is Gudrun and Andy.

411
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:05,292
The men sleep here, the women there!
- What?

412
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,208
The rules of the camp.
- Shit on that. We sleep together! There!

413
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:24,125
What's Ali Baba saying?
- Forget it. Come.

414
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:30,042
It's all fine. Sleep where you like.

415
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:31,458
All in this house here.

416
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:53,208
Fucking shit!

417
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:57,375
This does not have
anything to do with our job!

418
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:02,125
We are urban guerrillas, understand?
We don't fight in the desert!

419
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:13,958
Tell that camel-jockey we
fight against bank guards!

420
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:20,250
French.

421
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:25,167
What are they laughing about?
- We're just admiring your trousers.

422
00:49:25,292 --> 00:49:28,375
You've got them a little dirty.

423
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:46,917
I'll finish you off, you cocksucker.

424
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:50,542
Baby, leave it.
he's one of us.

425
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:54,375
He is not one of us.

426
00:49:54,500 --> 00:50:00,333
He's only here because he's
scared of the cops in Germany.

427
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,917
SICILY

428
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:50,917
You're homesick, right?

429
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:59,000
Which means you give up.
- These people are fighting a war...

430
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:03,292
What does our situation
in Germany have to do with it?

431
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:09,333
You can't force a revolution
there, even with a Kalashnikov.

432
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,458
Germany is just one front.

433
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:19,083
We fight with comrades everywhere
against injustice and oppression.

434
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:23,958
I thought you knew that.
- And what about your children?

435
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:29,458
You live underground.
Why bring them into it?

436
00:51:34,417 --> 00:51:39,708
Sooner or later it'll come out that
I did not participate in the Baader escape.

437
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,917
Then I can go back legally.

438
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:46,458
I could take care of the children.

439
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:53,042
That sounds very much like betrayal.

440
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:55,750
Betrayal? Of whom?

441
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:05,583
Look after yourself.

442
00:52:34,917 --> 00:52:37,875
What now? Can't we have a little fun?

443
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:50,875
He won't give us any more ammunition.
- Then we go on strike.

444
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:06,208
What are they staring at?
- Probably never seen naked women before.

445
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:09,917
Hey, look who's here.

446
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:17,542
What does one do with a traitor?

447
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:22,125
People's court.

448
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,667
What?

449
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:34,708
He asks us to get dressed.
- Why should we?

450
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:40,208
Sexual freedom and the fight
against imperialism go together.

451
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:43,292
He doesn't understand, Baby.

452
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:48,208
Fucking and shooting are the same!

453
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:58,000
Abu Hassan is commander
of the whole camp.

454
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:46,708
Don't worry...

455
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,708
...we'll bring you out.

456
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:30,792
Hands up!

457
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,292
Don't move!
Get down on the floor!

458
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:47,917
This is a hold-up!
Get away from the window!

459
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:53,458
Get down!

460
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:59,958
In West-Berlin today, a gang robbed
three different banks in 10 minutes.

461
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:05,208
In Breitenbach Platz, three
masked men and one woman.

462
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:10,500
At 8.10 AM four men dressed in parkas...

463
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:13,792
The robbers got away with
approximately 200,000 Marks.

464
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:17,792
It is believed that the robbers

465
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:23,583
are militant left-wing extremists.

466
00:57:23,958 --> 00:57:28,500
Detectives found a bag of
ski-masks dumped by the bandits.

467
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:33,750
They left handbills with the text
"Expropriate from enemies of the people".

468
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:46,083
217,449.50 Marks.

469
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:51,083
Not bad for 10 minutes work.
- Ulrike should write a statement.

470
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:54,208
Make clear that we only
took the money of capitalists.

471
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:59,458
That only the rich need be worried.
- Yeah, liberal wankers think that's good.

472
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:08,375
Stupid whore! Can't you
be careful? Shit-for-brains!

473
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,583
And so was the revolution made!

474
00:58:12,917 --> 00:58:16,167
<i>Some say,
Bank robbery is not political.</i>

475
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:21,625
<i>Revolutionaries in Latin America
call bank robbery "expropriation".</i>

476
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,917
Official Statement
on Bank robbery.

477
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:29,208
<i>It is politically
right to expropriate.</i>

478
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:33,708
<i>It is strategically right,
if it finances the revolution.</i>

479
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:38,042
Your children are gone.
I just heard from Sicily.

480
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:42,292
The man who took them
even knew the code word.

481
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:46,792
They're surely already
with your ex, the old fascist.

482
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:56,375
The Baader-Meinhof group will become
accepted as leaders of the revolution.

483
00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:00,750
What are you doing there?
That's my car!

484
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:05,583
Yesterday five arrests were made:
Attorney Horst Mahler,

485
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,667
student Peggy Schצnau...

486
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:13,833
In the young woman's handbag,
police found a Belgian pistol.

487
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:18,167
The charges: possession of guns,
falsification of identity papers,

488
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:22,667
car theft, burglary,
theft and armed robbery.

489
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:28,208
In Mhlheim, Dortmund, and Konstanz,
the prisoners face similar charges.

490
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:31,417
Show me your identity papers.

491
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:39,708
Get back!

492
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:45,375
...further threats of violence...

493
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:11,333
The trial of Astrid Berger began today.

494
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:15,625
According to a study by
the Allensbacher Institute...

495
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:20,167
25% of Germans under 30
are sympathetic to the RAF.

496
01:00:20,292 --> 01:00:26,125
That's about 7 million people.

497
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:30,292
Which makes finding
them a lot more difficult.

498
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:33,708
Lobster soup.

499
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,125
So we plan to
computerise identity papers.

500
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:46,833
I'll explain by
giving you an example.

501
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:53,542
Underground terrorists naturally
hide their identities from authority.

502
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:56,042
Without the new ID card...

503
01:00:56,208 --> 01:01:00,208
no bank account.

504
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,625
Now they'll find it hard
to rent somewhere to live.

505
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:09,667
Everything will require
the new cards. Gas, water, electricity.

506
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:14,083
In Frankfurt alone, 16,000
customers usually pay bills in cash.

507
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:18,917
We will no longer accept cash.
All customers will have to use their new ID.

508
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:22,708
No ID: no health care, either.
- And then?

509
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:27,958
Then we take it further. For example,

510
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:32,292
No ID: no driving license,
no child support payments.

511
01:01:32,417 --> 01:01:38,000
If everyone has to have an ID,
the last handful who don't: suspects.

512
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:41,542
That is a mathematical certainty.

513
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:48,250
In the long term it does
nothing to smash heads.

514
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:51,917
Or, as some would prefer,
to cut heads off.

515
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,208
Not the police,

516
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:59,042
but political powers
resistant to change,

517
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:02,417
allow terrorism to develop.

518
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:07,667
That is my opinion.

519
01:02:08,917 --> 01:02:12,583
Oh, and say hello to
the minister for me.

520
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:22,417
Shit!

521
01:02:39,417 --> 01:02:41,458
Floor it!

522
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:44,875
Halt!

523
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:55,042
Freeze!
Hands up! You too!

524
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:58,333
Go! Go! Petra, go!

525
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:02,417
Drop your weapons!

526
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:28,625
Kiss my arse!

527
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:03,375
Stop, girl! Freeze! Hands up!

528
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:34,275
Hello, Werner. You're back early.

529
01:04:34,525 --> 01:04:38,733
Excuse me, this is my house.
You said one night only.

530
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:42,983
Oh, you'll have your way.
We'll be gone tomorrow.

531
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,942
Well, then. Tomorrow.

532
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:04,567
...two people, a man and
a woman, ran a police roadblock...

533
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:07,358
What's wrong?

534
01:05:08,733 --> 01:05:11,650
That's Petra's car.

535
01:05:12,983 --> 01:05:18,275
The woman was killed
in the shootout that followed.

536
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,108
She opened fire when ordered
to lay down her weapon.

537
01:05:23,733 --> 01:05:25,150
Shit.

538
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:33,650
This is war.
- Now we kill a pig.

539
01:05:33,983 --> 01:05:38,108
Cold-blooded murder.
Obviously they're shooting to kill.

540
01:05:38,317 --> 01:05:43,608
They'll be hunting us all now.
- We must attack the cops directly.

541
01:05:43,733 --> 01:05:48,858
Shoot down their helicopters!
Blow up their stations!

542
01:05:49,525 --> 01:05:54,317
That goes against our policy.
- I shit on the policy!

543
01:05:54,442 --> 01:05:58,567
The armed fight against Imperialists...

544
01:05:58,775 --> 01:06:02,983
is against the US military presence
in Germany and in West Berlin.

545
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:09,150
We need to re-think our stategies.
- Do you think we need better plans?

546
01:06:09,317 --> 01:06:12,400
We need more safety precautions.

547
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:17,858
Actions in cities we
don't know well are unwise.

548
01:06:18,025 --> 01:06:22,650
What happened to Petra must not re-occur.
- Fuck-ups like that...

549
01:06:22,817 --> 01:06:27,442
are not caused by bad planning.
- It went wrong. It was a mistake.

550
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:32,650
Her mistake! Not the group's.
People must follow the plans.

551
01:06:32,817 --> 01:06:34,858
It was not the group's fault!

552
01:06:36,608 --> 01:06:41,942
The plans are all over the place.
Made up as we go along...

553
01:06:42,067 --> 01:06:46,192
Nobody questions why they go wrong.
- You cunt!

554
01:06:46,317 --> 01:06:52,150
Your idea of emancipation
is the freedom to shout at men!

555
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:56,442
Baby, you know that's nonsense.

556
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:13,483
General Daniel Chase,
Chief-of-staff at the Pentagon, explains:

557
01:07:13,692 --> 01:07:17,192
The US Air Force
does not bomb...

558
01:07:17,442 --> 01:07:23,275
targets south of 17 degrees latitude

559
01:07:23,983 --> 01:07:27,317
<i>"For the mass-murderers
of Vietnam...</i>

560
01:07:27,442 --> 01:07:33,275
<i>West Germany and West Berlin
should not be safe bases.</i>

561
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:44,025
<i>They must know that their crimes
against the Vietnamese people...</i>

562
01:07:44,192 --> 01:07:47,275
<i>have created bitter enemies.</i>

563
01:07:47,483 --> 01:07:51,608
<i>That there is no place in the world</i>

564

<i>"We demand an end to

01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:27,358
<i>We demand an end to the
naval blockade of North Vietnam. "</i>

569
01:08:35,025 --> 01:08:39,150
Police minister Herbert
Schoner was shot dead.

570
01:08:39,358 --> 01:08:44,483
Two shots, one in the heart.

571
01:08:45,567 --> 01:08:50,858
Also wounded was 25-year old
Manfred Fichtner from Kiel.

572
01:08:50,983 --> 01:08:56,650
...in Hamburg, policeman
Heinz Eckart was shot...

<i>Petra Schelm Brigade. "</i>

578
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:28,067
Police headquarters in
Augsburg were attacked today.

579
01:09:28,233 --> 01:09:33,442
Five policemen were injured.
An attack in Munich followed.

580
01:09:33,608 --> 01:09:37,733
Experts are searching for
the remains of the explosive device.

581
01:09:38,025 --> 01:09:43,233
The senior public prosecutor has
offered 10,000 Marks reward.

582
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,983
The car is being examined
by Federal Police specialists.

583
01:10:00,442 --> 01:10:05,567
A bomb tore apart the car of
High Court Judge Wolfgang Buddenberg,

584
01:10:05,817 --> 01:10:08,900
as his wife started the engine.

585
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:16,025
Judge Buddenberg ruled against
the Baader-Meinhof group.

586
01:10:16,192 --> 01:10:20,567
His wife remains in hospital
with serious injuries...

587
01:10:20,692 --> 01:10:24,817
but is out of intensive care.

588
01:10:25,025 --> 01:10:28,108
Shit.
We need more grinders.

589
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:37,900
...there are roadblocks on all
streets near the city center.

590
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:43,400
Heavily armed police are everywhere

591
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:49,775
Axel Springer publishing house.
- A bomb will go off in 5 minutes time.

592
01:10:49,983 --> 01:10:53,067
Evacuate the building.
- Who are you?

593
01:10:53,233 --> 01:10:57,400
Is it the nutcase again?
- Please stop calling us.

594
01:10:57,525 --> 01:10:59,400
Stupid pig!

595
01:10:59,525 --> 01:11:02,608
<i>We demand that Springer newspapers</i>

596
01:11:02,817 --> 01:11:07,858
<i>stop publishing lies about
liberation movements of the third world,</i>

597
01:11:08,025 --> 01:11:13,233
<i>particularly about the
movement to free Palestine.</i>

598

<i>Our actions will only cease
when our demands are met.</i>

599
01:11:23,483 --> 01:11:28,858
The Federal Government condemns these
attacks with indignation and abhorrence.

600
01:11:29,275 --> 01:11:34,233
Federal Chancellor Brandt called
the attacks "cowardly and devious".

601
01:11:34,358 --> 01:11:40,108
<i>Springer accepted the risk
that the bomb threat was genuine</i>

602
01:11:40,817 --> 01:11:46,483
<i>rather than lose profits
by evacuating their workers.</i>

603
01:11:46,817 --> 01:11:49,900
<i>For capitalism,
profit is everything,</i>

604
01:11:50,067 --> 01:11:53,483
<i>people, who create it, are dirt.</i>

605
01:11:53,608 --> 01:11:58,733
<i>We are deeply sorry
that workers were injured...</i>

606
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:04,775
What do you suggest?

607
01:12:04,942 --> 01:12:09,192
They can see that the
government is under pressure.

608
01:12:09,317 --> 01:12:12,567
We strike the water.
- Pardon?

609
01:12:12,692 --> 01:12:16,817
When you strike the water,
the fish surface...

610
01:12:17,067 --> 01:12:21,442
I need the entire police force,
detectives, uniformed, all of them.

611
01:12:21,567 --> 01:12:26,775
For one day, under the command of the
Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

612
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:31,067
But that would be...
That would be at least 130,000 men.

613
01:12:31,275 --> 01:12:35,400
That's right.
And all the helicopters, too.

614
01:12:35,692 --> 01:12:41,692
And to close the borders.

615
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:46,983
We hit the entire
Federal Republic in one day.

616
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:51,275
That'll drive the fish
up and into our nets.

617
01:12:51,483 --> 01:12:57,150
Cars are being searched
all motorways and arterial roads,

618
01:12:57,275 --> 01:13:02,233
causing long delays
at border crossings.

619
01:13:02,733 --> 01:13:06,858
All available officials
in West Germany are taking part.

620
01:13:07,442 --> 01:13:13,275
By noon today, police
in Hamberg checked 15,000 cars.

621
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,525
It's a police state,
just like you said.

622
01:13:17,733 --> 01:13:20,900
The public supports these measures.

623
01:13:21,025 --> 01:13:25,150
It's not looking
good for the Revolution.

624
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:30,525
Shut up! Urban guerrillas operate
in the rift between the state and the people!

625
01:13:33,067 --> 01:13:38,567
Checkpoints have been set up at all
public buildings, airports, and sporting events.

626
01:13:38,775 --> 01:13:44,275
Vehicles were searched. Photographs of
possible RAF members were distributed.

627
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:49,358
As Mao Tse-tung once said...
you've heard it before...

628
01:13:49,483 --> 01:13:53,608
but I'll remind you today. He said:

629
01:13:54,192 --> 01:13:57,275
"When the enemy slanders us,

630
01:13:57,483 --> 01:14:00,650
that is good.
Because it proves,

631
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:06,525
that there is a clear
line between them and us.

632
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:12,275
When the enemy paints
us in the blackest colors,

633
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,733
that's better.
Because it shows,

634
01:14:15,858 --> 01:14:19,983
that there is not only a clear
distinction between them and us,

635
01:14:20,442 --> 01:14:25,400
but also that we have achieved
a great deal in our work. "

636
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:06,525
The container.
It's been moved.

637
01:15:14,567 --> 01:15:17,483
That's not my powder.

638
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,650
Don't move! Police!

639
01:15:38,025 --> 01:15:41,108
Freeze! Drop the gun!

640
01:15:52,483 --> 01:15:55,567
Halt! Police!
Drop the gun!

641
01:16:15,733 --> 01:16:17,150
Shit!

642
01:16:38,233 --> 01:16:42,483
Throw your weapons
into the yard and come out!

643
01:16:43,692 --> 01:16:48,150
The longer you wait,
the stronger our forces.

644
01:16:48,733 --> 01:16:52,567
We have you surrounded.
There is no chance of escape.

645
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:56,858
Come out or we'll storm
the building. Why are you waiting?

646
01:17:02,942 --> 01:17:06,942
I repeat:
Come out now.

647
01:17:07,108 --> 01:17:11,233
You have no chance,
this is not a game.

648
01:17:25,483 --> 01:17:29,608
Do you want to get out of this alive?

649
01:17:32,483 --> 01:17:35,400
There is no chance of escape.

650
01:17:36,025 --> 01:17:40,317
Your only chance is to surrender now.

651
01:17:44,608 --> 01:17:49,733
If you come out with hands up,
nothing will happen to you.

652
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:57,483
We can wait all day.
We are in control here.

653
01:17:57,608 --> 01:18:01,275
We control the entire area.
There is no way out.

654
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:18,358
Police searching for the Baader-Meinhof group

655
01:18:18,483 --> 01:18:22,692
in Frankfurt this morning
achieved a major success

656
01:18:22,858 --> 01:18:28,692
Beside Baader, Holger Meins was arrested,
which greatly weakens the leadership of the group.

657
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:37,567
Shit.

658
01:18:50,942 --> 01:18:54,025
There, great Terrorist.
Shoot your way out.

659
01:19:06,317 --> 01:19:10,150
That's for Norbert.
- And that's for Heinz.

660
01:19:53,483 --> 01:19:58,858
Can I try it on?
- Changing room over there.

661
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:33,317
This way. That's the jacket.

662
01:20:37,192 --> 01:20:39,858
No! No!

663
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:57,692
No! Help!

664
01:20:57,817 --> 01:21:00,775
No! Fucking cops!

665
01:21:04,608 --> 01:21:07,067
Let go! No!

666
01:21:21,567 --> 01:21:24,233
Is that you?

667
01:21:25,358 --> 01:21:28,317
Are you Ulrike Meinhof?

668
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:53,817
Silence.

669
01:23:12,525 --> 01:23:16,692
I'm over here!
I'm over here!

670
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:27,608
Here!

671
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,233
I'm over here!

672
01:23:30,358 --> 01:23:31,983
Here!

673
01:23:43,067 --> 01:23:48,275
The Minister of the Interior
congratulates you on your great successes.

674
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:52,525
The Minister of the Interior
says the RAF is finished.

675
01:24:02,942 --> 01:24:11,108
I now declare the 1972 Olympic Games open.

676
01:24:17,525 --> 01:24:19,358
World record!

677
01:24:19,483 --> 01:24:24,650
...in disguise, into the
the Israeli teams's lodgings.

678
01:24:24,775 --> 01:24:29,858
...Israeli Coach Moshe Weinberg
was killed with two shots to the head...

679
01:24:29,983 --> 01:24:36,150
The Black September group is
demanding the release of over 230 prisoners

680
01:24:39,567 --> 01:24:44,567
...in exchange for the release of the hostages.

681
01:24:44,775 --> 01:24:49,983
If the prisoners are not released
the hostages will be killed...

682
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:55,483
Our worst fears have
become bitter reality.

683
01:24:59,775 --> 01:25:03,900
With the terrible events of the past week...

684
01:25:04,108 --> 01:25:08,317
at The Munich Olympics,
all of our hopes for peace...

685
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:12,567
have come crashing down.

686
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:17,983
We cannot remove all the hatred
and violence from this world

687
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:23,942
We must be prepared to fight
the forces of evil.

688
01:25:26,483 --> 01:25:28,483
Gentlemen,

689
01:25:28,608 --> 01:25:32,733
our duty is to fight terrorism.

690
01:25:32,942 --> 01:25:37,067
And, if possible, to end it.
Tell me your ideas.

691
01:25:37,275 --> 01:25:41,608
We need a special force,
to shut down these lunatics.

692
01:25:41,733 --> 01:25:46,942
Strong words don't
work against terrorists.

693
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:50,192
A special-purpose force
is absolutley crucial.

694
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:55,608
But those measures alone
will not solve the problem.

695
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:58,858
The roots lie deeper.
- Namely?

696
01:25:59,108 --> 01:26:03,317
The Israeli occupation of Palestine.
Nobody pays attention to that.

697
01:26:03,442 --> 01:26:07,733
So the terrorists try to
force the world to pay attention.

698
01:26:07,858 --> 01:26:13,067
So you approve of their aims?
- Nadler, don't talk rubbish.

699
01:26:13,233 --> 01:26:17,233
I never said that.
However,

700
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:22,400
one must understand their motives.

701
01:26:22,608 --> 01:26:26,733
So, you allow these
murderers a special status?

702
01:26:27,483 --> 01:26:31,608
No! But we can't
fight such forces rigidly.

703
01:26:31,817 --> 01:26:34,983
And our ignorance promotes terrorism!

704
01:26:35,108 --> 01:26:38,275
It's true,
but the question is...

705
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:42,858
whether terrorism
is the new form of war.

706
01:26:42,983 --> 01:26:47,733
Whether it replaces conventional war,
which does not take place any more.

707
01:26:48,108 --> 01:26:52,233
I don't follow you.
What about the victims?

708
01:26:52,442 --> 01:26:56,692
Or their loved ones?
- I understand your anger.

709
01:26:56,817 --> 01:27:00,942
But our duty is to fight terrorism.

710
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:06,358
And to do that we must understand
the problems of the third world.

711
01:27:06,483 --> 01:27:11,650
The Middle East conflict, the Vietnam war.
Understand these problems objectively!

712
01:27:23,275 --> 01:27:26,942
<i>It feels like an explosion in the head.</i>

713
01:27:27,192 --> 01:27:30,150
<i>Like the cell is full of pressure.</i>

714
01:27:30,317 --> 01:27:35,192
<i>The one feeling
I can't supress. Rage.</i>

715
01:27:35,317 --> 01:27:41,192
<i>The is no release from the pressure.
That's the worst thing about isolation.</i>

716
01:27:42,358 --> 01:27:46,483
<i>The clear knowledge that one
does not have a chance of survival.</i>

717
01:27:55,317 --> 01:27:58,983
Today we begin a hunger strike.

718
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:02,858
We demand change to
one of the prison conditions:

719
01:28:03,192 --> 01:28:08,567
Equal conditions for political
prisoners to all other prisoners.

720
01:28:09,442 --> 01:28:13,567
A hunger strike is our only way...

721
01:28:13,775 --> 01:28:17,775
to resist in solitary confinement.

722
01:28:21,108 --> 01:28:24,192
<i>The hunger strike is to show</i>

723
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:29,150
<i>that we will not compromise.</i>

724
01:28:29,775 --> 01:28:34,983
<i>We expect explosions
in the prison system.</i>

725
01:28:37,275 --> 01:28:41,400
<i>The goals must be
set out so that each Rocker,</i>

726
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:45,733
<i>so everyone, does not
lose their sense of purpose.</i>

727
01:28:45,858 --> 01:28:49,567
<i>That is, so that
they do not break us.</i>

728
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:56,233
<i>We can say: Each 3rd week,
or each 2nd or 4th week, whatever...</i>

729
01:28:56,983 --> 01:28:59,942
<i>one of us will die.</i>

730
01:29:00,275 --> 01:29:03,108
<i>And so on, until the isolation,</i>

731
01:29:03,233 --> 01:29:07,233
<i>until the torture for all is waived.</i>

732
01:29:08,692 --> 01:29:14,192
<i>But the hunger strike will only work
if we all stick to it together</i>

733
01:29:14,317 --> 01:29:19,442
<i>Until our demands are met.
Even if some of us die.</i>

734
01:29:30,525 --> 01:29:35,650
Counsellor, just a few minutes.
The prisoner is very much weakened.

735
01:29:43,067 --> 01:29:46,150
Gudrun wrote to me.

736
01:29:52,942 --> 01:29:58,275
This is our goal. You decide it,
when you die. Freedom or death.

737
01:29:59,275 --> 01:30:03,775
Just in case,
if I pass from this life,

738
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:08,233
It's murder.

739
01:30:10,108 --> 01:30:15,233
If the pigs keep this up, it's murder.
Do not believe the lies of murderers.

740
01:30:25,692 --> 01:30:28,358
Get me a cigarette.

741
01:30:37,983 --> 01:30:42,108
<i>I don't know what will
happen, I should die.</i>

742
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:45,858
<i>If I'm killed.</i>

743
01:30:47,317 --> 01:30:49,983
<i>What next?</i>

744
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,233
<i>That's it.</i>

745
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:01,983
<i>Which side is right?</i>

746
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:07,608
<i>It's not so clear.</i>

747
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:14,275
<i>The final battle to free
mankind from the pigs.</i>

748
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:19,608
<i>The revolutionary struggle.</i>

749
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:26,483
<i>With love for life
and with contempt for death.</i>

750
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:32,650
<i>I serve the people.</i>

751
01:31:39,192 --> 01:31:43,650
Get the prison doctor here, now.
- But it's the weekend.

752
01:31:43,775 --> 01:31:47,900
Then get his assistant.
- We don't have one.

753
01:31:48,108 --> 01:31:52,317
Then call in an outside doctor.
- We're not authorized.

754
01:31:52,442 --> 01:31:57,192
He's dying in there!
Get a doctor! Now!

755
01:31:58,275 --> 01:32:01,358
Unfortunately, we can't do a thing.

756
01:32:41,442 --> 01:32:45,442
One day after the death of Holger Meins,

757
01:32:45,775 --> 01:32:50,983
of the Baader-Meinhof Group,
who died while on hunger strike,

758
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:56,442
Berlin Chief Justice Drenkmann
was shot dead in his home.

759
01:32:56,567 --> 01:33:01,733
<i>We do not shed tears for Drenkmann.
We are pleased by his execution.</i>

760
01:33:01,942 --> 01:33:07,150
...attacks on judges and lawyers
who prosecuted the Anarchists.

761
01:33:07,317 --> 01:33:12,525
Lawyers for Holger Meins today
launched a wrongful death action...

762
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:17,317
<i>It was necessary, because
each judge and cop must know...</i>

763
01:33:17,442 --> 01:33:22,025
<i>that they will be held
responsible for their deeds.</i>

764
01:33:43,233 --> 01:33:46,317
That's Rudi Dutschke.

765
01:33:59,192 --> 01:34:02,150
Holger, the fight goes on.

766
01:34:30,067 --> 01:34:35,275
The trial of Baader and the others
begins in 4 weeks, here in Stammheim.

767
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:46,608
The pictures are of the
security wing on the 7th floor.

768
01:34:46,733 --> 01:34:52,025
The prisoners will be kept here.
- Men and women together?

769
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:56,275
Indeed, they demanded it.
- Outrageous.

770
01:34:56,525 --> 01:35:01,067
So they will cooperate during the trial.
- We provide a terror center!

771
01:35:01,192 --> 01:35:06,400
It's important that
the trial goes smoothly.

772
01:35:06,567 --> 01:35:10,858
We of the Federal Police can
monitor the group's communications.

773
01:35:10,983 --> 01:35:14,067
And we most certainly will.

774
01:35:18,733 --> 01:35:20,858
Go! Go!

775
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:24,358
Everyone out! Go!

776
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:32,608
The German Embassy in Stockholm
was occupied by terrorists today

777
01:36:32,817 --> 01:36:35,900
They threaten to kill hostages
unless their demands are met.

778
01:36:36,067 --> 01:36:40,317
The terrorists have released
a statement to the German government.

779
01:36:40,442 --> 01:36:45,650
Eye-witnesses reported shots.
The police closed off the area.

780
01:36:45,817 --> 01:36:48,900
About 100 People reportedly
remain in the embassy.

781
01:36:49,108 --> 01:36:53,317
Emergency units are treating
those who escaped the building

782
01:36:53,442 --> 01:36:58,650
A caller claiming to be a member
of the RAF demanded the release...

783
01:36:58,817 --> 01:37:03,483
Authorities believe the attack
is a last desperate attempt...

784
01:37:03,608 --> 01:37:08,192
to demand the release of RAF prisoners
in Stammheim before the trial begins.

785
01:37:08,317 --> 01:37:12,942
No fire in the cell!
- Kiss my arse. We're leaving.

786
01:37:13,108 --> 01:37:16,275
...will shoot one hostage every hour.

787
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:21,150
Storm the building and
we blow up it. We leave only...

788
01:37:21,317 --> 01:37:22,483
if our demands are fulfilled.

789
01:37:28,067 --> 01:37:31,025
Withdraw or they blow it up!

790
01:37:34,817 --> 01:37:40,525
They refuse to withdraw.
- Then we prove we're serious. Translate.

791
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:45,275
I am von Mirbach, Military Attachי.
They will shoot me...

792
01:37:45,775 --> 01:37:51,150
if you do not withdraw.
- Leave! Leave now!

793
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:04,192
The first explosion
occurred shortly before midnight.

794
01:38:04,317 --> 01:38:10,483
In minutes the whole building was
in flames, while the terrorists dug in.

795
01:38:10,775 --> 01:38:13,983
The explosions
followed each other closely...

796
01:38:14,108 --> 01:38:18,233
as police stormed the burning building.

797
01:38:19,567 --> 01:38:24,650
The hostage drama, which ended
last night in explosions and gunfire,

798
01:38:24,775 --> 01:38:30,067
has claimed at least three lives,
two of them embassy staff.

799
01:38:30,192 --> 01:38:35,400
Among them was Heinz Hillegaart,
chief of the catering department.

800
01:38:35,567 --> 01:38:38,733
It is still unclear whether he was shot,
like Military Attache von Mirbach,

801
01:38:38,858 --> 01:38:43,983
or whether he died in the explosions.
The 3rd death was one of the terrorists.

802
01:38:44,150 --> 01:38:49,358
Five terrorists were arrested:
Siegfried Hausner, Bernhard Rצssner,

803
01:38:49,525 --> 01:38:53,525
Karl-Heinz Dellwo, Lutz Taufner
and Hanna Krabbe.

804
01:38:53,775 --> 01:38:57,900
What a shitty action.

805
01:39:01,358 --> 01:39:04,150
Shitty action!

806
01:39:04,442 --> 01:39:09,733
The Swedish government delivered
the captured terrorists to Germany.

807
01:39:09,858 --> 01:39:15,233
Today the severely wounded
Siegfried Hausner was flown to Stammheim.

808
01:39:17,025 --> 01:39:21,150
I'll hold you responsible!
If the prisoner dies,

809
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:25,567
he'll be, after Holger Meins,
the second to die in our custody.

810
01:39:25,692 --> 01:39:31,025
With such incompetence we'll
give the RAF another martyr!

811
01:39:31,692 --> 01:39:36,067
This is a prison. We're not
equipped for severely wounded people!

812
01:39:36,192 --> 01:39:40,650
We must keep him here. Orders.
- That's completely insane.

813
01:39:40,775 --> 01:39:45,400
The two public defenders
are sufficient for Mr Baader.

814
01:39:45,567 --> 01:39:48,733
If he doesn't want them, too bad.

815
01:39:48,858 --> 01:39:53,025
They do not defend me.
They never even spoke with me!

816
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:58,442
Incidently, someone has written
"head off" beside my microphone.

817
01:39:58,567 --> 01:40:03,317
Beside my microphone it says "head off"!
What do you think it means?

818
01:40:03,442 --> 01:40:06,525
I don't know what it means.

819
01:40:09,025 --> 01:40:12,733
I am unable to take part in this trial.

820
01:40:13,358 --> 01:40:18,567
I am not nearly able,
in this place, at this time,

821
01:40:18,733 --> 01:40:22,650
I cannot say what...
I mean... I can't tell...

822
01:40:22,817 --> 01:40:28,983
I request an examination for us,
by an independent physician.

823
01:40:29,275 --> 01:40:30,692
Rejected.

824
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:36,108
They say we're not isolated,
because we have slightly larger cells.

825
01:40:36,275 --> 01:40:41,567
I say: We were,
up till a short time ago,

826
01:40:41,692 --> 01:40:45,775
completely isolated for the last 3 years!

827
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:50,650
Our only human contact was
through a tiny slot in the cell door.

828
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:56,317
Someone stood behind the door and wrote.
- I rule you out of order!

829
01:41:03,942 --> 01:41:08,692
Why do you change my notes
suddenly, without explanation?

830
01:41:08,858 --> 01:41:14,233
Because that things
you write have no power.

831
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:18,733
There's no need to do that.

832
01:41:21,858 --> 01:41:26,608
You jump on my errors
and go on and on about it.

833
01:41:27,525 --> 01:41:32,900
I could write a book on
your foolishness. Guard!

834
01:41:33,317 --> 01:41:37,317
Your tired act,
I'm sick of it.

835
01:41:37,692 --> 01:41:42,400
I've had my fill of this.
You're driving me crazy!

836
01:41:47,942 --> 01:41:51,025
Really, I don't get it.

837
01:41:51,275 --> 01:41:54,358
What's their problem, the bitches?

838
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:58,983
It's the last straw that
they allowed Hausner to die.

839
01:41:59,108 --> 01:42:03,233
They're not fooling anyone.
- You're a bullshit revolutionary!

840
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:06,858
We have to get out of here.

841
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:11,275
It's not easy to recruit
new troops after Stockholm.

842
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:17,608
You argue with your emotion,
you shitty egoist! You have no clue!

843
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,858
Not a clue! Piss off!

844
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:26,108
Piss off, arsehole!

845
01:42:26,692 --> 01:42:29,650
Get us out of here, you sow!

846
01:42:30,108 --> 01:42:32,775
Get us out of here!

847
01:42:33,650 --> 01:42:36,317
Sow! Arsehole!

848
01:42:36,525 --> 01:42:39,150
Get us out of here, you sow!

849
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:02,983
Mrs Meinhof, you are obliged to remain.
The accusations against you stand.

850
01:43:03,108 --> 01:43:07,108
You can't force me, arsehole.

851
01:43:08,567 --> 01:43:13,650
I decide that, "arsehole" or not.

852
01:43:13,775 --> 01:43:17,317
It's about time you admitted it.

853
01:43:17,442 --> 01:43:20,650
The accused is today excluded,

854
01:43:20,775 --> 01:43:24,275
Because she called
the chairman an "arsehole".

855
01:43:24,442 --> 01:43:29,150
Then you also exclude me.
- That's not for you to decide!

856
01:43:29,275 --> 01:43:34,567
Does it come to physical force?
- Sit! Sit down in your place.

857
01:43:34,692 --> 01:43:39,900
Go on with your ridiculous procedure.
I'll disturb it so long as I'm here.

858
01:43:40,067 --> 01:43:43,150
Do we really need to hear it?

859
01:43:43,358 --> 01:43:48,567
I'll say it too:
You're a fascist arsehole!

860
01:43:50,442 --> 01:43:55,650
We can't defend ourselves
so we refuse to participate.

861
01:43:55,817 --> 01:43:57,775
Old sow.

862
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:03,150
You... you are deranged!

863
01:44:04,150 --> 01:44:08,275
Did I hear you
call me an "old sow"?

864
01:44:08,608 --> 01:44:12,608
Did I hear that right,
or am I mistaken?

865
01:44:13,108 --> 01:44:17,233
I want it to be carefully noted!
And you, Mr Baader,

866
01:44:18,442 --> 01:44:22,567
You called me a
"fascist arsehole".

867
01:44:22,858 --> 01:44:24,900
Filthy rat.

868
01:44:27,150 --> 01:44:30,233
The defendants are excused.

869
01:44:30,525 --> 01:44:34,233
This court
adjourns for consulation.

870
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:56,025
<i>Ulrike, how is she? Very dark.
A Vampire, trembling with bloodlust.</i>

871
01:44:56,275 --> 01:45:00,400
<i>Ulrike tries to laugh,
it doesn't work.</i>

872
01:45:00,733 --> 01:45:05,900
<i>Necrophile. Hysteric.
Really absolutely ugly me.</i>

873
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:43,025
<i>Although I still say
my reason hasn't left me.</i>

874
01:45:43,233 --> 01:45:45,900
<i>It's separate from me.</i>

875
01:46:11,650 --> 01:46:14,317
This is shit.

876
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:27,567
She gives me false information.
Gudrun transcribes it wrong.

877
01:46:28,733 --> 01:46:33,608
Why do you do that?
Is it because you want to torment me?

878
01:46:33,817 --> 01:46:37,817
I return the agony.
An eye for an eye.

879
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:44,025
I don't look at it.
I can't bear it.

880
01:46:44,275 --> 01:46:48,400
I am not a witch,
but I am sometimes brutal.

881
01:46:48,608 --> 01:46:52,817
Don't pretend.
You hate us. It's obvious.

882
01:46:52,942 --> 01:46:58,067
So stop eating, until you're
better, or go to the Devil.

883
01:46:58,192 --> 01:47:02,942
How are we to attain our goals,
if we blow workers up?

884
01:47:03,067 --> 01:47:07,775
Show the reports you wrote on us.
- I know, Springer was an error.

885
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:13,275
That went against our aims.
- We've discussed this a thousand times.

886
01:47:13,983 --> 01:47:19,150
We've been through this! Many times!
- The action was counter revolutionary!

887
01:47:19,358 --> 01:47:23,358
Real revolutionaries would
have shot you for that!

888
01:47:51,067 --> 01:47:55,192
The question is:
How can an isolated prisoner...

889
01:47:56,525 --> 01:48:02,692
make the authorities recognise
that his behavior has changed? How?

890
01:48:03,942 --> 01:48:09,942
In isolation, the prisoner can't
show that his behaviour has changed.

891
01:48:10,108 --> 01:48:14,233
There's only one possibility.
And that is betrayal.

892
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:19,317
The prisoner in isolation
has no other chance.

893
01:48:19,442 --> 01:48:23,567
So there are two possibilities.

894
01:48:23,817 --> 01:48:28,483
I will speak now!
A prisoner can be silent,

895
01:48:28,608 --> 01:48:32,900
and die,
or a prisoner can talk.

896
01:48:33,025 --> 01:48:38,150
That is confession and betrayal.
And based on this fact,

897
01:48:38,317 --> 01:48:43,442
the Federal High Court resolution
makes a clear and definite statement.

898
01:48:43,567 --> 01:48:48,150
That is torture.
Designed to force confessions.

899
01:48:48,275 --> 01:48:53,150
To confuse, demoralise, and punish.

900
01:48:53,275 --> 01:48:56,358
You're the knife in the back of the RAF.

901
01:48:57,608 --> 01:49:00,567
Because you never learn.

902
01:49:20,775 --> 01:49:26,150
<i>It is mysterious,
if I say I can't bear it?</i>

903
01:49:27,317 --> 01:49:32,483
<i>I don't bear it any more.
That is what I can't bear.</i>

904
01:49:48,192 --> 01:49:53,400
We are responsible for the
attacks on CIA headquarters...

905
01:49:53,567 --> 01:49:59,442
on the 5th US Corps in Frankfurt
and on US headquarters in Heidelberg.

906
01:49:59,567 --> 01:50:04,192
We are also
responsible for the bombing

907
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:10,358
of the Springer building.
Beyond that, we have no knowledge.

908
01:50:10,858 --> 01:50:17,733
We had no part in the planning
or the execution of any other actions.

909
01:50:43,567 --> 01:50:47,692
The Anarchist Ulrike
Meinhof took her own life.

910
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:52,733
She was found dead this morning
in her cell in Stuttgart-Stammheim.

911
01:50:52,858 --> 01:50:55,817
Ulrike Meinhof, that was murder!

912
01:50:56,317 --> 01:51:02,317
The 41-year-old hung herself with
a towel tied to the window bars.

913
01:51:02,525 --> 01:51:06,775
There will be an autopsy later today.

914
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:12,192
The 109th day of the hearing in Stammheim
was unusually crowded this morning.

915
01:51:12,317 --> 01:51:17,650
The court-appointed defense
counsels made a request...

916
01:51:17,775 --> 01:51:21,775
to adjourn the trial for 10 days.

917
01:51:22,108 --> 01:51:28,025
To investigate whether Ulrike
Meinhof really committed suicide.

918
01:51:28,150 --> 01:51:31,233
We believe Ulrike was executed.

919
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:36,608
We don't know how, but we know who.
Chief Federal Prosecutor Buback said:

920
01:51:36,733 --> 01:51:41,067
"The State protects those
who support the State.

921
01:51:41,192 --> 01:51:46,400
Herold and I always find a way. "
- These defamatory remarks...

922
01:51:46,567 --> 01:51:52,108
It was a coldly conceived execution!
Like Holger Meins and Siegfried Hausner!

923
01:51:52,233 --> 01:51:55,317
The execution of Ulrike now!

924
01:51:56,317 --> 01:51:59,275
Fascist! Murderer!
- Silence!

925
01:51:59,608 --> 01:52:05,692
Under your jurisdiction as judges
two prisoners out of five were killed!

926
01:52:17,567 --> 01:52:22,858
Why were Schubert, Mצller
and Mohnhaupt brought to Stammheim?

927
01:52:22,983 --> 01:52:27,942
The public prosecutor's office gave in
to the pressure of public opinion.

928
01:52:28,067 --> 01:52:33,275
I allowed it, in order
to prevent further suicides.

929
01:52:33,442 --> 01:52:35,442
Baader und Ensslin...

930
01:52:35,567 --> 01:52:40,733
RAF prisoners were allowed
to transfer to Stammheim.

931
01:52:43,025 --> 01:52:47,150
Time's up! Return to your cells!
- Stop eating.

932
01:52:49,650 --> 01:52:55,025
Mohnhaupt will be free in 7 Months.
Those jerks guaranteed it.

933
01:52:55,150 --> 01:53:00,483
Baader and Ensslin
probably insisted on it.

934
01:53:43,942 --> 01:53:46,900
Lovely to see you.

935
01:53:48,150 --> 01:53:50,817
Are you Charlie?

936
01:53:53,983 --> 01:53:56,942
I want to talk with him alone.

937
01:53:58,608 --> 01:54:02,733
Andreas and Gudrun trust you.
- How are they?

938
01:54:03,067 --> 01:54:07,275
They're shitty! We must
get them out of there, soon.

939
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:10,567
Before they end up
like Ulrike und Holger.

940
01:54:10,692 --> 01:54:15,900
A few think we should hijack
a 747 and circle it over Bonn.

941
01:54:16,067 --> 01:54:20,733
With an ultimatum to exchange
our people in 6 to 8 hours.

942
01:54:20,858 --> 01:54:25,108
Then let it fall.
In the middle of Bonn.

943
01:54:25,233 --> 01:54:29,858
We heard of that plan. No.
No actions against the people.

944
01:54:29,983 --> 01:54:35,275
We stick with the kidnappings.
How far advanced are you?

945
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:39,067
Ready to go.
Here, before I forget it...

946
01:54:41,317 --> 01:54:44,275
I brought this for you.

947
01:54:46,317 --> 01:54:49,817
Nearly 5 years prison...
- It's a long time.

948
01:54:51,942 --> 01:54:55,025
That's how long since I fucked a guy.

949
01:55:17,692 --> 01:55:23,567
They need weapons.
If another escape attempt fails...

950
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:28,775
They want to be able to make a choice.

951
01:55:32,483 --> 01:55:37,108
You must not mention it
to the others. No matter what happens.

952
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:42,483
Very pretty, the medal.
- Very much.

953
01:55:42,775 --> 01:55:44,942
Congrats!

954
01:55:45,067 --> 01:55:48,150
You work on your honour day?

955
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:53,150
Gottfried Hagemann. You remember,
the lawyer. With his arrest...

956
01:55:53,275 --> 01:55:59,442
We found coded
operational plans on him.

957
01:56:02,275 --> 01:56:04,942
Big arsehole.

958
01:56:06,483 --> 01:56:12,192
HM Auschecken. Margarine.
What is your conclusion?

959
01:56:12,733 --> 01:56:17,900
Siegfried, we're expecting an
act of revenge against you.

960
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:29,733
<i>On 7.4.77 the Kommando Ulrike Meinhof
executed Chief Federal Prosecutor Buback.</i>

961
01:56:32,858 --> 01:56:38,442
<i>Siegfried Buback was directly
responsible for the murder of Holger Meins,</i>

962
01:56:38,567 --> 01:56:41,025
<i>Siegfried Hausner, and Ulrike Meinhof.</i>

963
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:46,317
<i>As Chief Federal Prosecutor,
he ordered their murders.</i>

964
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:05,650
<i>Under Bubacks regime,
Holger on 9.11.74.</i>

965
01:57:05,775 --> 01:57:09,483
<i>was murdered by starvation.</i>

966
01:57:09,692 --> 01:57:12,858
<i>Under Bubacks regime,
Ulrike on 9.5.76.</i>

967
01:57:12,983 --> 01:57:16,650
<i>was illegally executed,</i>

968
01:57:17,150 --> 01:57:20,317
<i>in a faked suicide by hanging.</i>

969
01:57:20,442 --> 01:57:24,650
<i>Under our laws, for which
Ulrike fought, justice was done.</i>

970
01:57:24,775 --> 01:57:29,983
<i>We will not allow our
comrades to be murdered,</i>

971
01:57:30,108 --> 01:57:35,317
<i>We will show the authorities that
when prisoners continue to fight,</i>

972
01:57:35,483 --> 01:57:41,650
<i>killing them will not solve the
problem. Kommando Ulrike Meinhof.</i>

973
01:57:47,858 --> 01:57:51,858
We could not protect him.
- I ask myself:

974
01:57:52,233 --> 01:57:58,400
Why do new terror units always
develop? What motivates them?

975
01:58:01,317 --> 01:58:03,358
A myth.

976
01:58:41,233 --> 01:58:44,567
Come on in,
Mr Ponto is expecting you.

977
01:58:44,692 --> 01:58:46,108
Thanks.

978
01:58:51,775 --> 01:58:56,817
You brought a whole committee.
- I wanted to show them your place.

979
01:58:56,983 --> 01:59:00,067
My friends. Klara.
- Good day.

980
01:59:00,192 --> 01:59:03,275
Gerd.
- Herr Ponto, shall I stay?

981
01:59:03,733 --> 01:59:06,900
No, you may go.
Come outside.

982
01:59:12,567 --> 01:59:18,025
What a lovely surprise.
I'll be with you in a moment.

983
01:59:18,817 --> 01:59:22,817
I'll put those in a vase. Sit down.

984
01:59:23,608 --> 01:59:25,025
Klara.

985
01:59:40,275 --> 01:59:44,400
Go to the exit. Come along.
- Are you mad?

986
01:59:44,650 --> 01:59:48,775
You are a prisoner of the RAF.
- Are you mad?

987
02:00:07,942 --> 02:00:09,983
Go, get out!

988
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:17,150
I didn't want that!
How do I explain to my parents?

989
02:00:17,775 --> 02:00:22,650
We agreed, no guns! And only a tap
on the head, if he resists.

990
02:00:22,775 --> 02:00:27,358
We wanted to kidnap him!
- Why are you here?

991
02:00:27,483 --> 02:00:33,067
To play the female Robin Hood
without getting your hands dirty?

992
02:00:33,192 --> 02:00:38,317
You crybaby! You sign the claim
of responsibility. - No! Never!

993
02:00:49,692 --> 02:00:54,900
<i>On the execution of Ponto, we say:</i>

994
02:00:55,025 --> 02:01:00,358
<i>It is a clear warning to those types.</i>

995
02:01:00,483 --> 02:01:04,692
<i>If you wage war on the people,
then war will be waged on you.</i>

996
02:01:05,567 --> 02:01:09,233
<i>Susanne Albrecht,
soldier of the RAF.</i>

997
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:22,858
The door stays open!

998
02:01:23,233 --> 02:01:29,108
We do not accept locked doors!
Hey! No locked doors!

999
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:37,400
Now you'll have the war you wanted!

1000
02:01:40,983 --> 02:01:44,317
You pigs! You filthy pigs!

1001
02:01:45,692 --> 02:01:49,692
Let me go. Idiot.
Fucking shitty cops!

1002
02:01:51,567 --> 02:01:54,650
You wanker! Fucking leave her alone!

1003
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:58,858
You sow! Let go!

1004
02:02:08,483 --> 02:02:12,483
How much longer?
- Soon. Nearly done.

1005
02:02:14,317 --> 02:02:17,275
229, 12th line, 4th word.

1006
02:02:17,650 --> 02:02:20,025
9, 10, 11, 12... 3,4.

1007
02:02:23,692 --> 02:02:25,067
Finished.

1008
02:02:26,775 --> 02:02:30,900
<i>We forestalled our
planned liquidation.</i>

1009
02:02:31,108 --> 02:02:34,942
<i>We retain our identity.</i>

1010
02:02:35,067 --> 02:02:39,733
"We know there is a
concrete plan to kill us.

1011
02:02:39,858 --> 02:02:44,233
Surrender is impossible.
You must hurry.

1012
02:02:45,817 --> 02:02:48,900
We do not need to say more. "

1013
02:02:50,567 --> 02:02:55,733
That is clear. If we do nothing,
they've given us straight facts.

1014
02:02:56,525 --> 02:03:01,733
What "straight facts"?
- It's very clear, OK?

1015
02:03:01,858 --> 02:03:05,858
If we don't get them out
immediately, they're dead.

1016
02:03:08,275 --> 02:03:12,400
Now what?
- Schleyer goes on vacation tomorrow.

1017
02:03:13,192 --> 02:03:16,900
For how long?
- Several weeks.

1018
02:03:17,442 --> 02:03:21,567
Then let's do it
tomorrow. Why not?

1019
02:03:21,817 --> 02:03:25,942
We'll have to do it the hard way.
- What's that mean? Hard?

1020
02:03:27,067 --> 02:03:32,150
It means we shoot the escorts,
all of them, to get to Schleyer.

1021
02:03:32,275 --> 02:03:38,150
The SEK are armed and trained.
It'll be a combat situation.

1022
02:03:38,483 --> 02:03:42,608
The driver isn't SEK, though.
- You miserable wanker!

1023
02:03:42,775 --> 02:03:46,900
The prisoners will be murdered!
- Stop it!

1024
02:03:48,483 --> 02:03:52,608
Let's get our plan in order.
- I can't do this.

1025
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:59,025
I can't be a part of this.
- OK. Then you better leave now.

1026
02:03:59,775 --> 02:04:05,150
We need to discuss plans.
They don't concern you any more.

1027
02:04:15,192 --> 02:04:19,317
Brigitte, you can't do this.
If you're captured again...

1028
02:04:19,525 --> 02:04:23,733
I am in charge here.
We'll discuss that later.

1029
02:04:23,858 --> 02:04:29,233
Now let's find out who's
willing to do it the hard way.

1030
02:04:33,567 --> 02:04:35,608
What about you?

1031
02:05:48,067 --> 02:05:51,150
It's safe to assume...

1032
02:05:51,358 --> 02:05:57,275
that Schleyer is being held
within 20 km of the scene.

1033
02:05:57,567 --> 02:06:01,567
Less than two hours ago it happened.

1034
02:06:02,358 --> 02:06:06,608
Five weeks after the
murder of the banker Ponto...

1035
02:06:06,733 --> 02:06:11,942
an assassination attempt
on Hanns Martin Schleyer.

1036
02:06:12,067 --> 02:06:16,192
Four police officers from
the escort were killed.

1037
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:20,400
The search for
the attackers continues.

1038
02:06:20,733 --> 02:06:25,358
Schleyer is not among
the dead. It is obvious...

1039
02:06:26,025 --> 02:06:31,608
that the terrorists
have kidnapped him.

1040
02:06:31,942 --> 02:06:35,650
The manhunt goes on.

1041
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:41,108
All the official parties
condemned the attack on Schleyer.

1042
02:06:42,358 --> 02:06:46,733
Now you have a problem.
Now you have a big problem!

1043
02:07:33,067 --> 02:07:37,067
Their reign of terror has not yet ended.

1044
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:42,858
And they are feeling triumphant now.

1045
02:07:42,983 --> 02:07:46,067
But they must make no mistake.

1046
02:07:46,317 --> 02:07:50,942
...the Siegfried Hausner Kommando...

1047
02:07:51,150 --> 02:07:56,442
has taken the president of the employers
association, Hanns Martin Schleyer, prisoner.

1048
02:07:56,567 --> 02:07:59,692
The will of the German people is not broken.

1049
02:08:08,025 --> 02:08:10,108
They're sealing us in!
- They're doing what?

1050
02:10:40,692 --> 02:10:45,400
A Lufthansa airliner has been hijacked.

1051
02:10:45,775 --> 02:10:49,025
The aircraft was en route from Majorca
to Frankfurt, but was diverted to Rome.

1052
02:10:49,150 --> 02:10:54,150
86 passengers, mostly
Germans, are on board.

1053
02:10:56,733 --> 02:10:59,192
...footage of kidnapped
businessman Hanns Schleyer...

1054
02:10:59,192 --> 02:11:01,692
reading a statement from his captors...

1055
02:11:06,692 --> 02:11:09,942
You can see my current circumstances.

1056
02:11:10,525 --> 02:11:15,608
The government in Bonn
must make a decision.

1057
02:11:16,025 --> 02:11:20,900
The actions of the German goverment
prove that they are the terrorists.

1058
02:11:22,108 --> 02:11:26,692
The state, which claims to promote freedom...

1059
02:11:26,817 --> 02:11:32,567
...uses the methods of totaliarianism...

1060
02:11:32,692 --> 02:11:37,150
in the name of fighting terrorism.

1061
02:11:37,275 --> 02:11:41,567
I Have, so far, been
treated well by my captors...

1062
02:11:44,400 --> 02:11:53,442
Pressure on the
government is growing...

1063
02:11:54,067 --> 02:11:56,900
as the hijackers demand the
release of political prisoners...

1064
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:59,733
including the RAF
prisoners in Stammheim.

1065
02:12:02,942 --> 02:12:05,775
As the hijack drama continues...

1066
02:12:06,067 --> 02:12:10,900
...reported to have
shot the pilot...

1067
02:12:11,233 --> 02:12:14,483
...threatened to kill one
passenger every 5 minutes...

1068
02:12:14,608 --> 02:12:20,317
The Pope has sent a plea for
the release of the passengers.

1069
02:12:21,233 --> 02:12:24,150
At Aden airport,
passengers and crew...

1070
02:12:24,150 --> 02:12:27,067
...swap for prisoners...

1071
02:12:27,358 --> 02:12:30,358
...have arrived in Cairo...

1072
02:12:30,483 --> 02:12:34,275
...prisoners in his country will be...

1073
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:38,483
...emergency landing!

1074
02:12:46,525 --> 02:12:51,483
Baader Meinhof Gang terrorists who
are also holding Hanns-Martin Schleyer...

1075
02:12:51,608 --> 02:12:56,358
...passenger swap in Dubai.

1076
02:12:56,483 --> 02:13:02,525
...do not condone the
actions of political gangsters.

1077
02:13:02,650 --> 02:13:06,067
Comrade, they turned us down.

1078
02:13:11,317 --> 02:13:13,358
And where does that leave us?

1079
02:13:14,317 --> 02:13:16,942
Everything's gone wrong! Everything!

1080
02:13:22,733 --> 02:13:28,108
They've taken off again.
One pilot shot.

1081
02:13:28,567 --> 02:13:32,483
The plan was to stay in Aden.

1082
02:13:32,608 --> 02:13:36,233
What does it mean?

1083
02:13:37,525 --> 02:13:42,025
Baby. This thing is complete bullshit.

1084
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:49,233
...landed in Somalia yesterday.

1085
02:13:49,358 --> 02:13:54,358
The body of pilot Jrgen
Schumann was dumped...

1086
02:13:54,483 --> 02:13:57,942
...before taking off again.

1087
02:14:15,483 --> 02:14:18,483
We cannot intervene, even if...

1088
02:14:18,608 --> 02:14:23,317
we could actually speak with them.

1089
02:14:24,025 --> 02:14:28,067
We do not approve of
killing innocent civilians.

1090
02:14:30,775 --> 02:14:34,608
The Federal Government,
unlike ourselves,

1091
02:14:34,733 --> 02:14:38,400
goes too far, is too violent.

1092
02:14:43,067 --> 02:14:45,775
I want to see the prison chaplain.

1093
02:14:46,108 --> 02:14:48,650
Whatever happens, it's not our doing.

1094
02:14:49,025 --> 02:14:51,567
Our policies are far more measured.

1095
02:14:51,692 --> 02:14:53,317
Do you really believe that?

1096
02:14:53,608 --> 02:14:56,108
Last month, 8 children
were left fatherless.

1097
02:14:58,942 --> 02:15:01,275
We have no control over
the actions of those outside.

1098
02:15:02,775 --> 02:15:06,358
We will be judged by
generations to come.

1099
02:15:07,067 --> 02:15:10,483
If Schleyer escapes, good.
I'm tired of it.

1100
02:15:13,108 --> 02:15:15,108
I wish to request...

1101
02:15:15,233 --> 02:15:18,442
materials to make a will.

1102
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:21,858
The full legal documents, if possible.

1103
02:15:22,192 --> 02:15:27,358
And I'd like some help
in filling it out properly.

1104
02:15:27,483 --> 02:15:28,358
But Miss Ennslin...

1105
02:15:28,483 --> 02:15:32,858
With that done, I will
no longer fear my fate.

1106
02:15:32,983 --> 02:15:37,317
But surely you don't feel
that you are in danger?

1107
02:15:38,067 --> 02:15:40,900
I could die at any time.

1108
02:15:41,983 --> 02:15:43,817
You know what is going on outside...

1109
02:15:44,650 --> 02:15:48,192
that they're trying
to get us out of here.

1110
02:15:48,483 --> 02:15:51,525
That fight has international dimensions.

1111
02:15:51,983 --> 02:15:53,942
What are you getting at?

1112
02:15:54,858 --> 02:15:57,275
I ask you this:

1113
02:15:57,608 --> 02:16:01,442
Wouldn't they prefer
to see me vanish?

1114
02:16:02,650 --> 02:16:05,108
Many states would want that.

1115
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:08,858
In Western industrial countries
the power structures...

1116
02:16:08,983 --> 02:16:12,692
are not so secure that they would wish...

1117
02:16:13,233 --> 02:16:18,150
to encourage a new wave
of resistance groups to develop.

1118
02:16:18,442 --> 02:16:21,483
What is your influence
on the current situation?

1119
02:16:21,983 --> 02:16:25,400
Free us, and the current
actions will be successful.

1120
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:28,817
Would the government
want that to happen?

1121
02:16:29,275 --> 02:16:31,358
The judges and the politicians,

1122
02:16:31,483 --> 02:16:35,442
they want to avoid
that at all costs.

1123
02:16:46,692 --> 02:16:51,525
Miss Ennslin, I hope
we can continue to meet.

1124
02:16:52,650 --> 02:16:55,608
Farewell, father.

1125
02:17:13,150 --> 02:17:17,400
We have just recieved confirmation...

1126
02:17:17,525 --> 02:17:20,983
the Luftahansa terrorist
hijacking has ended...

1127
02:17:20,983 --> 02:17:24,400
with all of the 86
passengers safely rescued.

1128
02:17:24,525 --> 02:17:28,733
A spokesman for the Ministry
of the Interior has confirmed...

1129
02:17:29,025 --> 02:17:35,275
that a German anti-terrorist
squad stormed the plane last night.

1130
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:38,942
The Bonn government
has issued a statement...

1131
02:17:39,067 --> 02:17:43,983
"... refused to release
the jailed terrorists. "

1132
02:17:44,108 --> 02:17:51,567
...these brutal actions
have not suceeded. "

1133
02:18:46,983 --> 02:18:50,442
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1134
02:18:58,650 --> 02:19:01,817
Mr Raspe.

1135
02:19:05,817 --> 02:19:08,900
Miss Mצller. Miss Mצller.

1136
02:19:09,192 --> 02:19:11,317
Alive.

1137
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:20,983
Miss Ennslin.

1138
02:19:31,442 --> 02:19:33,608
The pigs really did it.

1139
02:19:34,067 --> 02:19:37,608
They killed all of them!
- Enough.

1140
02:19:37,733 --> 02:19:41,317
But they killed them all!
- Open murder!

1141
02:19:41,817 --> 02:19:44,692
They sacrificed themselves.
The time was not right.

1142
02:19:46,567 --> 02:19:49,567
What? Are you joking? What do you mean?

1143
02:19:49,858 --> 02:19:52,775
They were at risk.

1144
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:55,650
Get them out immediately! Immediately!

1145
02:19:55,775 --> 02:19:58,233
Those were your words.

1146
02:20:07,358 --> 02:20:12,567
They knew the risks.
They had their alternatives.

1147
02:20:14,525 --> 02:20:17,192
They made their choices.

1148
02:20:17,817 --> 02:20:21,233
What happened was their own doing.

1149
02:20:30,358 --> 02:20:33,775
And Ulrike?

1150
02:20:35,317 --> 02:20:37,983
Her, too.

1151
02:20:41,983 --> 02:20:44,442
I think they recognised...

1152
02:20:44,567 --> 02:20:48,275
that the end had come.

1153
02:21:23,650 --> 02:21:26,858
Belgian - French border

1154
02:21:27,305 --> 02:22:27,911
