00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Thanks.

Cheers!

9
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,360
Cheers!

10
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,920
Hi.

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,680
I'm so proud of you.

12
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,080
I can't believe it's over.

13
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,320
Thank you for waiting.

14
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,880
Driving back and forth to this dump.

15
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,240
Well, now it's your turn
to wait for me.

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,120
Are you okay?

17
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,200
- With what?
- Moving to Stockholm with me.

18
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,600
Yes, of course. Of course.

19
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,040
It will be great.

20
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,040
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

21

"Skrubbsår"
by Magnus Rehn requested by Erik for Tove.

23
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,680
They celebrate three years together.

24
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,160
This is music
and romance on Mix Megapol.

25
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,560
We now have another lovebird
with a special greeting.

26
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,200
Hello, my name's David.

27
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,040
Hi. Who do you want to send some love to?

28
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,520
My girlfriend Nadja.

29
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,920
Um, sorry, I'm a bit nervous.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,920
No worries, but hurry up.
We don't have much time left.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,800
Oh, shit. Okay. Um…

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,800
Nadja, you are the best thing and…

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,280
- What song would you like?
- Just a second, um…

34
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,680
Everything is about
to begin for you and me, and…

35
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,696
…shit, this is stressful.

36
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,400
"If you were an ocean…

37
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,440
I would be a wave."

38
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,000
"If you were the sky, I would have wings."

39
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,280
Lovely.
Here is "Om" by Niklas Strömstedt.

40
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
No, wait.

41
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,000
Nadja, will you, um…

42
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,920
…will you marry me?

43
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,640
Damn.

44
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,760
Damn it.

45
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,800
You're crazy.

46
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,800
Proposing to me
in the filthiest toilet in Sweden.

47
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,880
Are you…

48
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,360
are you sad-sad or happy-sad?

49
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,640
Of course, I'll marry you!

50
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Yes.

51
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,040
Excuse me. That was beautiful.

52
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,920
Thanks.

53
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,280
- Great news about the job, David.
- Thanks.

54
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,960
- It's you and me now.
- Whatever happens.

55
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,040
It all begins here.

56
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,720
1.5 YEARS LATER

57
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,360
For fuck's sake!

58
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,000
Fucking hell!

59
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,280
- Ooh.
- Hello!

60
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,080
Can you give me a hand? I have to study!

61
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,080
I want to be a doctor,
not a fucking housewife.

62
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,840
- Why are you so mad?
- I'm fed up with nagging.

63
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,800
You said you'd fix it,
but the lid's still broken.

64
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,840
I know. I haven't had the time.

65
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,400
But you have time to play "Battlefreed."

66
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,960
It's called "Battlefield."

67
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,880
Whatever. I'll do it.

68
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,040
Just like I do everything else.

69
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,840
Come on.
I work all the time. I need to chill.

70
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,720
Move out, then.
It wouldn't make any difference.

71
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,680
- I'll fix it now.
- No, it's too late.

72
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,320
- What do you want me to do?
- Maybe you should consider other people.

73
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,600
What do you mean? I work nonstop.

74
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,640
Everything I do is for us.
It was for us that I...

75
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,160
Yeah, that went well.

76
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,440
Yeah, go on. Run away.

77
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,680
You're damn good at that.

78
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,320
A fucking champion!

79
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Oh.

80
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,160
- Tomas…
- Oh, sorry.

81
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,920
No, I'm sorry.
I've probably taken your slot.

82
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,800
- I'll stop it.
- No, I can come back later.

83
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,680
- It's fine.
- No.

84
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,680
Hang on.

85
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,720
Are you okay?

86
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,240
Sorry. I'm…

87
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,280
It's not a stomach bug.

88
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,760
Poor thing. What's going on?

89
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm pregnant.

90
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Oh…

91
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,920
- You're having a child?
- Don't say anything. I haven't told David.

92
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm not sure if we…

93
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,960
…should become parents.

94
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,600
Everything's become so…

95
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,200
What?

96
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,800
I don't know.

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,320
It feels like I have to do everything.

98
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,640
David works all the time,
and I have to do everything, and…

99
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,560
if we have a baby,
I'll end up on my own with it.

100
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,240
I don't want to be a fucking housewife.

101
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,200
Housewife? You?

102
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,920
Yes.
I remember what it was like.

103
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,400
Uh…

104
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,560
"How can I have a child when I'm not
much more than a child myself?"

105
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,680
Having a child
is the greatest thing in life.

106
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,720
At the same time,
you worry about losing it.

107
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,280
- Sorry, I didn't mean to…
- Don't worry. I asked you.

108
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Right.

109
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,840
I'm sure you and David
will be amazing parents.

110
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,080
You're a responsible person.

111
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,560
I'm sure you will do
what feels right for you.

112
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,040
- Tomas. Thanks.
- Hmm.

113
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Oh.

114
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,960
- You're always so kind.
- That's what neighbors are for.

115
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,440
Okay.

116
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,400
I'll come back later.

117
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,560
Come on, Boris.

118
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,880
MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM

119
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,760
MEET ME ON THE STAIRS

120
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,360
MEET ME BY THE CAR

121
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,400
You think Mom will be happy?

122
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,280
Stay, Boris, stay.

123
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,000
Sorry.

124
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
What's this?

125
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,760
I thought we could get away for a while…

126
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,760
and spend some time together.

127
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,440
Bear Valley?

128
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,480
Yes. Hiking in the mountains
and camping under the northern lights.

129
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,960
- Will you have time?
- I called in sick.

130
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,640
Has David Daftander called in sick?

131
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,480
I may have the world's best job,

132
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,520
but I don't want to lose
the world's best girl.

133
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,440
- That was rather soppy.
- Maybe it was a bit over the top.

134
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,880
Soppy? This is Don Juan Daftander.

135
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Okay?

136
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,800
I'm just carsick.

137
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,776
- My God.
- Sorry.

138
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,080
- What are you doing?
- Easy, boy.

139
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,040
- Shall I drive?
- No, I'll drive.

140
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,640
Come.

141
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Hello.

142
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
- Can I say hello?
- Sure.

143
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,240
Hello. Yes. Huh?

144
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,360
Can you smell game, huh?

145
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,960
I have a dog too.
A German Shepherd.

146
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,760
Damn fine creatures.

147
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,200
No. Boris, calm down.

148
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,680
Who's a pretty boy, then?

149
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,840
Yes, you are.

150
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,800
Yes! You're a pretty boy.

151
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,960
Yeah, right. Good.

152
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,640
Your girl's pretty too.

153
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,240
- Yes, she is. Thanks.
- Just kidding.

154
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,320
- There. Come.
- Come on.

155
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,000
Come on. Come on. Come on.

156
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,280
Boris. What…?

157
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,760
Boris, what are you doing?

158
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,520
No, not here. No.

159
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,880
Boris, come on. No. Down.

160
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,040
Come here.

161
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,720
- Fucking hell.
- What?

162
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,280
There's a bloody
reindeer head on the flatbed.

163
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,520
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

164
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,440
Reindeer for dinner tonight.

165
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,360
- Damn.
- For fuck's sake.

166
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,320
- David.
- It's cool. They won't notice it.

167
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,400
I'm just going to…

168
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,920
- Should I tell them?
- They won't notice it.

169
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
DOG ONBOARD

170
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,520
What the hell? Here.

171
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,880
There. Come on, boy.

172
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Hi.

173
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,400
We have a reservation. Daftander.

174
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Hello.

175
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,440
What's going on?

176
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,640
Hi, there. Sorry about Mona.

177
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,520
She doesn't like strangers.

178
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,800
She's not a racist, but…

179
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,600
Welcome. What can I do for you?

180
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,800
We have a reservation. David Daftander.

181
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,960
Here you are.

182
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,480
Well, let's see then.

183
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,440
Three nights.

184
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,920
- But not tomorrow?
- No, we'll camp out and hike.

185
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,800
- See the northern lights.
- Yes, exactly.

186
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
Well,
there's no guarantee you'll see them.

187
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,480
We get Chinese people coming
from the other side of the planet

188
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,400
with cameras,
and they leave without seeing them.

189
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,080
But you might be lucky.
It's fucking beautiful.

190
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,440
But put your phones away.

191
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,880
The northern lights are not for cameras.

192
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,600
They are for making love.

193
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,600
And that's a nice way
to keep warm.

194
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,440
I'll remember that.

195
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,200
Yeah, but it's not a joke.

196
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,640
You have to stick together.

197
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,560
The nighttime cold is no joke.

198
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,800
But I'm scaring the shit out of you.

199
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,680
Don't be scared. It's quiet out there.

200
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,120
- Right, the keys.
- Yes. Thanks.

201
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,760
Daftander.

202
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,080
Mona.

203
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,960
Northerners.

204
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,880
They are…

205
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,400
what do you call it
when people are quiet?

206
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,440
Right, here are your keys.

207
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,720
Room 369.

208
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,680
Through the main door,
to the left and up the road.

209
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,080
And here's a map.

210
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,520
This is the hiking trail.

211
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,440
If you get fed up
with the cold and hiking,

212
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,320
I invite hikers into my cottage.

213
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,480
I can offer cold beer and a sauna.

214
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,760
- Cool.
- Thanks.

215
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,680
I wish you a good night.

216
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,160
- Thanks.
- You too.

217
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,120
Okay, run.

218
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
What the fuck?

219
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
DARKIE IN CAR

220
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Hey, they…

221
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
What's wrong?

222
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,960
What the fuck's wrong with people?

223
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,480
If you'd talked to them,
it wouldn't have happened.

224
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,720
- Honey, it was just a tiny scratch.
- Sure.

225
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,280
- Stop!
- What?

226
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,680
Stop the car!

227
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,760
- Is it theirs?
- Fucking racists.

228
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,800
- Where's the screwdriver?
- Leave it. Please.

229
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,320
They might come back.

230
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
What…?

231
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,480
Why are you here?

232
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,200
- Uh…
- What? Why are you scratching the car?

233
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,320
Go to hell, fucking racist!

234
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,200
Run! Run!

235
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,600
- Run!
- Drive!

236
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
- Drive!
- Yes!

237
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,680
What the fuck?

238
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,520
That felt damn good.

239
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,160
But was it a good idea, huh?

240
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,080
A scratch for a scratch. It's only fair.

241
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,040
Sit, Boris.

242
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,160
- Easy, boy.
- Sit.

243
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,600
Come.

244
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,080
Damn it.

245
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,880
Mind your head.

246
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,400
There we are.

247
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
Right.

248
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,400
Check this out.

249
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,320
- Welcome, my neighbors.
- Fuck you!

250
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,760
Yes, fuck you too!

251
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,920
- Boris!
- Wait for me!

252
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,600
- Slow down, Boris. Slow down.
- David!

253
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,400
Honey!

254
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,320
- Let's stop here.
- Here?

255
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,720
- Yes, I'm exhausted.
- Okay.

256
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,640
Come on!

257
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,960
Do you have the instructions?

258
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,520
Inside my brain.

259
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,440
David, seriously. Surely you brought…?

260
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,080
- These four…
- Here's the fifth.

261
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,480
- Where does this go?
- Up your ass.

262
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,800
Yeah, but when I ask…

263
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,040
I need to find where this…

264
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,600
where this…
It seems logical that it should…

265
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,200
- In there. And then fold it.
- You drive me mad.

266
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,840
- What was that?
- You dork.

267
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,400
What the hell…?

268
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,280
There's a musical wolf
here in the mountains.

269
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,840
Ha, ha. Very funny.

270
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,360
- Hi.
- No. You fatty.

271
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,360
- David.
- No, can I...

272
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,600
I just want to say that I…

273
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,160
I'm pregnant.

274
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
What?

275
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,920
Shit. What... are you sure?

276
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,320
I've done five tests.

277
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,600
W-what…?

278
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Great.

279
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,400
So, we... we're having a baby.

280
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,880
You really think so?

281
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,800
I know I've done…

282
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
- David.
- What?

283
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,040
Right.

284
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
Easy.

285
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,280
Hello.

286
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,000
Shh, Boris.

287
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Hello.

288
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Easy, Boris.

289
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,680
No, but... quiet, Boris. Shh! Easy.

290
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,960
What are you doing? Going outside?

291
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,400
- It's probably some damn kid.
- Kid? Here?

292
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,400
I'll go and check.

293
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Hello!

294
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,400
What the fuck?

295
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,280
Where's it coming from? Hello!

296
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,760
- Some damn kids.
- Up here?

297
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,640
Honey, it's on you. Move.

298
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Hello! Stop it!

299
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,520
Fuck.

300
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Hello!

301
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,800
- Stop it!
- It's not funny!

302
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,120
Hello! Who's there? Stop it!

303
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,080
Easy, boy. Stop it!

304
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,520
- David...
- Hello. Stop it!

305
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,440
- Shit!
- Are you okay?

306
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,760
- Yes.
- Sorry.

307
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Stop it!

308
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,640
Fucking Laser Man?

309
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
Very funny.

310
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,320
Let's get our stuff and move.

311
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,760
- It's the middle of the night.
- Never mind. Easy, boy.

312
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,520
- Easy, boy.
- Okay.

313
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,640
- Shh. Easy, boy.
- It's okay, sweetie.

314
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,240
- David.
- Huh?

315
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,880
- Hello.
- David.

316
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,960
No, Boris! Boris!

317
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,360
Boris!

318
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,400
Seriously?

319
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Boris!

320
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
Boris!

321
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,000
Do you think…?

322
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,840
- We've got to get out of here.
- Run!

323
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
David!

324
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,080
What the fuck?

325
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,680
What is this?

326
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,520
What's going on?

327
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,720
Come on! Run!

328
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,480
Down!

329
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,400
What's wrong?

330
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Ouch. It's nothing.

331
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
I don't know.

332
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Damn.

333
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,320
Come on! Come on! Come on!

334
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,880
Down here.

335
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,280
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

336
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,560
- This is sick!
- There are two of them.

337
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,200
- What the fuck's going on?
- I don't know.

338
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,240
It must be those inbred brothers.

339
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,040
It's Boris! It's Boris!

340
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,280
Wait, wait, wait.

341
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,160
What are they doing?

342
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
It's so sick. What's going on?

343
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,520
They're getting closer.
We've got to move. Come on.

344
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,480
- I've got to go back to the tent.
- We need to get out of here.

345
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,200
Let's get our stuff and call the police.

346
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,000
Let's head to the car.

347
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,080
- We won't find it from here.
- Damn!

348
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,760
We don't know where we are.

349
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
Even if we get to the car,
the keys are in the tent.

350
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,120
We can hot-wire it.

351
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,320
I can't do that. Can you? No.

352
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
Wait here.

353
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
It's empty.

354
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
Phones, everything, all gone.

355
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Don't go inside.

356
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,200
This is totally sick.
This is totally sick.

357
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,560
I'll fucking kill them.

358
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,040
- I'll fucking kill you!
- Shh!

359
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,720
Fuck! Fucking cunts!

360
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,760
Quiet! They can hear you.

361
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,760
We shouldn't have left him.

362
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,000
What have we done?

363
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,280
We haven't done anything.

364
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,320
We haven't done anything.

365
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,160
Not anything. Okay?

366
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,720
I'll look for the keys.

367
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,480
Oh, shit! Shit!

368
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Help!

369
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,920
Nadja!

370
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,840
- What should I do?
- Get it off me!

371
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,240
- How?
- Just force it open. Just force it open.

372
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,000
- Fuck.
- Come on!

373
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,960
Okay.

374
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,080
Please fix this. Help me! Help!

375
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,560
- Put pressure on it!
- Okay, okay, okay.

376
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,920
- Press hard.
- Okay.

377
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,160
Don't look.
You need to go to the hospital.

378
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,520
But you're a doctor. You can…

379
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,080
In four years' time.

380
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,480
- There.
- We just scratched their car.

381
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,160
Okay, okay.

382
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,280
- Are they still out there?
- I don't know.

383
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,160
- We need to follow our tracks back.
- Okay. Okay.

384
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,360
Where the hell are we?

385
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,360
Someone's there.

386
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,360
We must get to the trees.

387
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,200
Fuck you!

388
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
One shot.

389
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,480
What?

390
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,480
- One shot. Then they reload.
- What are you saying?

391
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,600
The weapon. I think I saw it in their car.

392
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,080
It's like in Battlefield.

393
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,920
One shot, then you reload.
It takes ten seconds.

394
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,960
Is it like that in real life?

395
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,920
I don't know. I don't know.

396
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,040
Next time they shoot, we run. Okay?

397
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,840
Okay. Okay.

398
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,000
- Come on!
- Go!

399
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
David!

400
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,760
David!

401
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
David!

402
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
David!

403
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,360
Nadja!

404
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,920
Nadja!

405
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,160
David!

406
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,000
Nadja!

407
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,520
Watch out for the ice!

408
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,320
Nadja!

409
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,360
David! David!

410
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,240
Nadja, where are you?

411
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Nadja!

412
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,320
Watch out for the ice!

413
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,520
Nadja!

414
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
David!

415
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
David!

416
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
Help!

417
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
David!

418
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,840
Help me!

419
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,040
Help me! Help!

420
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,560
I'll grab you!

421
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,720
Help me! Help me!

422
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,480
Are you hit? Are you hit?

423
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,840
- Take off your clothes.
- All right.

424
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,600
Get them off.

425
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,840
How does it look?

426
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,360
Mountain Rescue. How can I help?

427
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,280
Help!

428
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,560
Help will come
once the storm subsides.

429
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,680
Try to stay still, okay?

430
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,680
How does it look?

431
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,400
It'll be fine.

432
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,600
- Do you know what you're doing?
- I failed the sewing classes.

433
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,760
But I have "sew-philis."

434
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,720
- Ouch!
- Bad joke.

435
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,520
Okay.

436
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
Okay.

437
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,520
How are you?

438
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,960
Can I…?

439
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,360
Hang on.

440
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,040
Oh, my God.

441
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,440
It's beating fast. Is it supposed to?

442
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,720
I think so.

443
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,080
Like a hamster.

444
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,960
Are we having a little hamster?
Harald the hamster?

445
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,440
- They're here.
- What?

446
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,520
They're here.

447
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,800
Hello!

448
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,400
It's the racist brother.

449
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,880
He's a mountain rescuer.

450
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,960
This can't be fucking happening.

451
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,320
Hurry!

452
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
Yeah.

453
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,800
Go!

454
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,960
Damn.

455
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,760
Come on.

456
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,960
Come on.

457
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,840
Hey!

458
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,440
Come on.

459
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,240
Hello!

460
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,400
I can't go on.

461
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,880
Come on!

462
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,400
David!

463
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,880
Are you okay? Hey.

464
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,320
Take it easy.

465
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,120
Breathe. Look at me.

466
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,240
Look at me. Breathe.

467
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,000
Breathe. Okay.

468
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,720
- Breathe.
- Breathe.

469
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,200
What's happening?

470
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,600
- He's in my head all the time.
- Breathe.

471
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,200
- Breathe.
- You were right. We should have called.

472
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,720
Where the hell are we?

473
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,880
Look.

474
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,480
We came down here.
This must be the emergency shelter.

475
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,760
It can't be far to that bartender's house.

476
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,440
- Can you make it?
- Yes.

477
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,720
See that?

478
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,080
I can't get him out of my mind.
I see him all the time.

479
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,280
- Okay.
- Why didn't I listen to you?

480
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,400
I don't deserve to be a dad.

481
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,600
Don't say that.

482
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,600
Stop it.

483
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,160
The cottage is over there.
It's not far to go.

484
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,360
Come on.

485
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,400
Don't you get it? It's a sign.

486
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,200
We don't deserve this.
We can't become parents.

487
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,520
- I don't deserve this.
- Don't say that.

488
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,480
- We don't deserve it.
- Stop it.

489
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,720
David, listen to me.
It's not far to go. Come on.

490
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,400
When we get home, we'll tell the police.

491
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,160
It's not too late.

492
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,880
Okay?

493
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,680
Come on. Get up.

494
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,960
Come on.

495
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,800
Come on!

496
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,120
I can't do it.

497
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,480
I can't go on. I can't walk.

498
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,560
Okay.

499
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,120
I'll see if anyone's in and ask for help.

500
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,000
Hi!

501
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,760
What's happened? What are you doing?

502
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,080
I had to do it.
He was going to shoot you. Right?

503
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,280
He was going to shoot you, right?

504
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,760
Come.

505
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,240
David!

506
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,400
Hello.

507
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,160
Oh, fuck.

508
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,520
Up!

509
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,440
Don't fall asleep.

510
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,120
- Hey! Call an ambulance.
- What's happened?

511
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,920
Call for help.

512
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,040
I'll... I'll call.

513
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,480
You'll be fine.
Don't fall asleep. Look at me.

514
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,560
It'll be fine.

515
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,880
Yes, it's me.

516
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,080
They're here now.

517
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,600
Thanks. Yeah.

518
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,360
Hurry up!

519
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,360
That's fine.

520
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,880
What are you doing?

521
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,960
Wait…

522
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,160
What?

523
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,360
They'll be here soon.

524
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,280
Sit down and wait.
Help will arrive soon.

525
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,200
What's wrong?

526
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,400
- We must go. Come.
- Wait.

527
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,720
Wait!

528
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,360
It'll be over soon.

529
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,920
I promise. It'll be over soon.
Nothing will happen to you.

530
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,920
- Get in!
- It'll soon be over.

531
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,440
What the hell did we do?

532
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,600
Just take it easy.

533
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,240
I don't wish you any harm.

534
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,240
One has to help one's family.

535
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,280
We just scratched a car!

536
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,320
I don't know what you're on about.

537
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,640
Stop it!

538
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,560
I can't take anymore.

539
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,480
Nadja.

540
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,880
Nadja!

541
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,280
What…?

542
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,520
His eyes were so full of life.

543
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,760
Tomas.

544
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:39,800
I can't stop thinking
of what he would look like now.

545
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,760
Have you ever thought of that?

546
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,800
He's lying there
in his little coffin in the ground.

547
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,480
Where is he now?

548
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:07,520
So, what did you do, Nadja?

549
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,280
I would like you to tell me.

550
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,520
Tomas, we...

551
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,920
Tell me.

552
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,160
Of course, I'll marry you.

553
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,800
- It's you and me now.
- Whatever happens.

554
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,160
It all begins here.

555
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:31,080
I can't believe
you proposed to me in that dirty toilet.

556
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,960
I meant to do it in the café,
but you came down.

557
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,480
- So, it was your fault.
- I can be dirty too.

558
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,880
- Wait. I'll stop.
- Drive. It's sexy.

559
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,560
What's with the chastity belt?

560
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,520
I know, it's hard. Or it's not…

561
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,760
What the fuck was that?

562
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,040
- Oh, my God!
- No. Wait, Nadja. No!

563
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,040
What the hell?

564
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,960
No!

565
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,400
It was a little boy. He…

566
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,880
He's… dead.

567
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,560
Everything was supposed to begin now.

568
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,480
What are you doing? What are you doing?

569
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,920
Well, I think…

570
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,800
let's just drive for a bit
and think this through.

571
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,800
- We can't…
- We must call the police.

572
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,880
Let's just drive.

573
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,600
We need to think about it.
We can call later.

574
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,360
It's okay. It's okay.

575
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,440
I can't deal with this.

576
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,240
I'll call the police.
I'll tell them it was us.

577
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,280
- No. Don't do anything rash.
- Yes.

578
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,040
Hang on. We don't even know if he...

579
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,160
David, he was fucking dead.

580
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,080
- I saw his face. I can't live with this.
- Listen.

581
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,280
Listen. It was me. I was driving.

582
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,760
I'll end up in prison if you call them.

583
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,640
No…

584
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,880
I'm also guilty.

585
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,120
Hang on. We...

586
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,160
No. Listen to me. Listen!

587
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,640
It was me. Only me.
You didn't do anything.

588
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,960
Police. Anyone there?

589
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,640
- Hang on…
- Hello.

590
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,280
- Let me do it myself.
- Hello.

591
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,680
I just need some time.

592
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,960
I will. I promise.

593
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,400
It's quite incredible
how you just move on.

594
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,240
Continue.

595
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,480
As if nothing's happened.

596
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,600
I've tried to understand
what kind of fucking people you are.

597
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,000
Check it out!

598
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,000
Tomas. Tomas.

599
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,160
POLICE

600
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,960
Did you see anything?

601
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,000
Do you know anything
that could be of help?

602
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,320
Anything at all?

603
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,200
Don't say that.

604
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,960
Get a grip.

605
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,720
- Need help?
- No.

606
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,080
- Are you sure?
- They're heavy.

607
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,120
I'm moving in up there.

608
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,200
- That's right opposite us.
- I see.

609
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,600
- Those two windows.
- Great.

610
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,640
- We can wave to each other.
- Yes.

611
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,080
- Hi.
- Hello.

612
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,360
I couldn't help myself.

613
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,120
Bicycle is not spelled with an "s."

614
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,200
Thanks.

615
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,600
- You're so kind.
- What else are neighbors for?

616
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,320
I wanted to give you this.

617
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,400
You were so kind when I moved in.

618
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,400
- Bear Valley?
- Hmm.

619
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:10,440
But this is…
don't you want it yourself?

620
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,520
No, you take it.

621
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,240
You deserve to suffer like me.

622
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,720
Sit down.

623
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,400
- Please…
- Sit down!

624
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,600
Tomas, please.

625
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,800
I'm so sorry.

626
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,800
I'm so terribly sorry.

627
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,080
I'll go to the police
and tell them everything.

628
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,440
- Bye, David.
- Tomas, please.

629
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,120
This isn't you.

630
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,880
I would have wanted to kill us too.

631
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,040
We shouldn't have left.
We should have gone back.

632
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:23,080
What we did was…
it is unforgivable, but…

633
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,760
…we're having a baby.

634
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,800
Do you remember what you said?

635
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,800
That…

636
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,880
that suddenly you have everything…

637
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,280
everything to lose.

638
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,200
Good morning.

639
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,800
Einar. She's awake now.

640
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,600
Did you get hold of her?

641
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,520
She wouldn't want to miss this.

642
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,840
Einar.

643
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,640
I'm calling, but there's no answer.

644
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,280
There's a problem
with my sister's phone.

645
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,600
For fuck's sake.

646
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Tomas.

647
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,200
- Come on. That's enough.
- Stop it.

648
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,480
This is my moment.

649
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,600
I was going to shoot you.

650
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,160
But then the storm came.

651
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,000
That was lucky.

652
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,640
You're right, Nadja.

653
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,880
Killing you wouldn't help anyone.

654
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,240
But why should you get off lightly?

655
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,160
Huh?

656
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,600
Now when you're carrying
something more valuable

657
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,600
than your pitiful lives?

658
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,640
Tomas… please.

659
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,080
You will regret this.

660
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,800
I don't care about myself.

661
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,520
I can go to jail. My life is over.

662
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,600
Please, Tomas.

663
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,120
- I understand. I've lived with the guilt.
- You don't understand shit.

664
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,120
But you will.

665
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,920
Let's begin.

666
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,080
Come on, David.

667
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,400
You can do this.

668
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,360
Maybe the mother survives.

669
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,160
W-what do you want me to do?

670
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,240
Drill.

671
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,640
Please…

672
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:28,920
Do it.

673
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,120
Why?

674
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,800
I want to share.

675
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,000
I want you to feel what I feel.

676
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:38,800
No, no.

677
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,720
If you don't do it, I'll shoot Nadja.

678
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:43,960
Then you both will die.

679
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,160
It's your choice.

680
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,560
Yes.

681
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,840
Five seconds.

682
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,680
What the hell are you doing?

683
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,240
Five.

684
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,160
Four.

685
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,800
Three.

686
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,840
Two.

687
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:57,880
One.

688
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,000
I can't do it!

689
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,080
Okay.

690
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:22,800
Well, then…

691
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:31,320
It may not be as poetic, but…

692
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,120
Bye, Nadja.

693
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,760
Here you are.

694
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,400
Do you realize what you've done?

695
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,360
- Call for help.
- Who the hell are you?

696
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,320
- Who the hell are you?
- Call the police.

697
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,776
- Jarmo…
- Who's he?

698
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,120
- Why are you here?
- They're psychopaths!

699
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,680
- What the hell's going on?
- Hang on.

700
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,480
- Call for help!
- Take it easy.

701
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,376
- Help us!
- What are you doing?

702
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,400
Put those down!

703
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,760
- It's no fucking toy.
- What's she on about?

704
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,600
Help!

705
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,600
David!

706
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,000
Run! Run! Run!

707
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,160
Damn!

708
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,200
I can't get up!

709
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,360
Ugh! I can't go on.

710
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:21,960
Come on, David.

711
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,160
Wait. I can't.

712
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,280
Up!

713
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,920
Get up!

714
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,160
Sorry.

715
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,920
Sorry.

716
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,360
It's all my fault.

717
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,280
It can't end like this.

718
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:55,920
Get up.

719
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,280
Get up!

720
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,120
Please.

721
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,240
You must get out of here.

722
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,040
Get out of here. Run!

723
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,920
I can't.

724
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,800
You must.

725
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,200
Do it now.

726
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,640
Run.

727
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,800
I love you.

728
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,920
I love you.

729
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:37,680
Run.

730
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,720
Run. Run.

731
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:43,960
Where is she?

732
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,960
It wasn't her fault.

733
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,840
Where is she?

734
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,200
I can't keep fleeing.

735
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,080
This stops now.

736
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,400
Do you hear?

737
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,680
This stops now.

738
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,400
Why are you smiling?

739
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,800
You should have turned around long ago.

740
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,480
No.

741
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,240
No. No. No.

742
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:39,960
Kill me.

743
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,960
Please, kill me. Kill me.

744
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,480
Shoot!

745
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,760
Honey, it's okay now.

746
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,360
You'll survive.

747
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,160
I want you to kill me.

748
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,240
Now you feel.

749
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,640
I want to die!

750
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,160
I know.

751
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,600
No. Please.

752
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,440
I understand.

753
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,600
I understand now.

754
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,440
Kill me!

755
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,200
No…

756
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,920
Nadja…

757
01:21:53,305 --> 01:22:53,729
