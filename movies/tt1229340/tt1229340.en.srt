<i>There are many
places we could begin</i>

3
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,848
<i>the next chapter of the
legend of Ron Burgundy.</i>

4
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,576
<i>This is one such place.</i>

5
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,692
<i>However, we won't
begin our tale here.</i>

6
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,889
<i>No, our story begins in a
place all newsmen dream of.</i>

7
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,677
<i>In New York City.</i>

8
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,995
Ron Burgundy!

9
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,874
That lady's got an ass like
the Loch Ness Monster.

10
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,203
Thing is mysterious and
ever sought after.

11
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,562
Ron, aren't you going
to say something to him?

12
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,647
Hey, when you've got an
ass like the North Star,

13
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,815
wise men are going

14
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,233
to want to follow it.

15
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,153
<i>It was a time before
cell phones and steroids.</i>

16
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,973
<i>And for Ron and his
now-wife Veronica,</i>

17
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,532
<i>life was good.</i>

18
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,536
The Tooth Fairy's exposed
breast made the child uncomfortable.

19
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,789
The Bishop wore
buttless chaps to the bat mitzvah.

20
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,082
Bat mitzvah.

21
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,711
The garden gnome had
a normal-size penis.

22
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,816
The garden gnome had
a normal-size penis.

23
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,861
Corningstone. Corningstone.

24
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,181
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no!

25
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,933
They're coming in through
the back door! Oh, no!

26
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,292
Oh, no!

27
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,256
Grab the children!
Save the children!

28
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,799
Five, four...

29
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,636
- Have a great broadcast.
- You, too, darling.

30
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,113
Good evening.

31
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,325
This is the weekend edition of
<i>WBC News at 6:30.</i>

32
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,785
I'm Ron Burgundy.

33
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,433
And I'm Veronica Corningstone.

34
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,080
Our top story tonight.

35
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,665
The U.N. today announced
sanctions against...

36
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,771
When the broadcast is over,
send these two up to my office.

37
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,151
Time to make a change.

38
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,660
Rumor has it that after 35
years of manning the helm,

39
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,849
Mack Tannen is thinking
about stepping down.

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,951
That's right.

41
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,688
Do you...
Do you think we could be...

42
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,542
We could be getting the
<i>Nightly News, Ron?</i>

43
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,776
I think that's exactly
what's about to happen.

44
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,695
Oh, my God. That's what's
happening, isn't it?

45
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,863
- I'm hyperventilating.
- Yes, I see that.

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,200
Look at me.

47
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,619
Oh, you... Well.

48
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,663
I'm laughing like a
ventriloquist's dummy.

49
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,289
You are.

50
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,208
Let's stop that before
we get in there.

51
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,777
Don't do that in there, darling.

52
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,489
Mr. Tannen,
you are an inspiration, sir.

53
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,570
I've been doing the evening
news now for over 35 years.

54
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,846
- Done a hell of a job.
- Yes, sir.

55
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,180
A hell of a job!

56
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,849
I've gone through four wives.

57
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,705
I have six or seven kids that I haven't
got the time to tell I love them.

58
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,207
To be honest, they
sound a little needy.

59
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,672
And I killed four men in Okinawa.

60
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,845
W.W. Two.

61
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,881
And that was two weeks ago.

62
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,578
The point is, this is
a very demanding job.

63
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,871
Yes.

64
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:11,853
But I'm close to thinking that
you may have what it takes.

65
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,276
Now, let me look at you.

66
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,568
Oh, my God.

67
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,720
Would it be wrong to say
you smell terrific?

68
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,539
- Ron, please!
- Okay.

69
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,624
What are you?

70
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,793
Finnish?

71
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:34,167
Oddly enough, I'm 100%
full-blown Mexican.

72
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,609
From the state of Oaxaca.

73
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,054
No, you're not, honey.

74
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,447
Hello, sir.

75
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,550
Oh, my heart is racing.

76
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,702
Hmm.

77
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,808
I just have to say, this is
super creepy and unorthodox.

78
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,649
You like-a da merchandise, huh?

79
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,986
Sorry.

80
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,156
All right.

81
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,831
We're about to make

82
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,433
network news history.

83
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,411
- Veronica.
- Yes?

84
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,465
You're going to be the
first female full-time

85
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,376
network news anchor.

86
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,128
- Oh, my goodness!
- Oh! I knew it.

87
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,672
And you, Mr. Burgundy...

88
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,474
I'm going to be the first
lactose intolerant anchor.

89
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,719
- Mr. Burgundy.
- Yes?

90
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,353
You're fired.

91
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,017
Come again?

92
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,557
Fired.

93
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:35,736
You are the worst anchorman

94
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,230
I have ever seen.

95
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,658
But what did I do wrong?
Name one thing.

96
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,697
Korean soldiers were
fired upon in the DMZ!

97
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,972
Oh. Jeez, I am so sorry.

98
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,599
Someone put the story
in all capital letters,

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,828
and I... I thought
I was supposed to yell it.

100
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,423
President Parter...
Ah, shit!

101
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,232
I mean, President Carter

102
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,711
will speak at the summit Tuesday.

103
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,695
Tony, did I just curse?

104
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,822
Are you kidding me? Shit!

105
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,722
I mean... Shit. Shoot!

106
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,370
The slain Civil Rights leader
was eulogized...

107
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,538
Oh!

108
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,893
Oh, wow! Did you see that?
Right on the lens!

109
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,710
Folks, I'm sorry.

110
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,546
I hold myself to a high
professional standard

111
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,299
and you shouldn't hear
that language, okay?

112
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,778
I'm having a shitty day.
Oh, fuck-stick!

113
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,179
Now, I know this is tricky,
given your relationship,

114
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,829
so I'm going to give you the
evening to think about it.

115
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,225
I forbid it!

116
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,206
You forbid it? What?
Who are you? Julius Caesar?

117
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,148
Who the hell is Julius Caesar?

118
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,233
You know I don't follow the NBA.

119
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,527
Look, I am so sorry that
this happened, Ron,

120
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,071
but you and I,
we're partners, sweetheart.

121
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:50,097
And when something good happens
to me, it also happens to you.

122
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,577
That's ridiculous!

123
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,662
It clearly just happened to you!

124
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,640
You... Oh! Be quiet.

125
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,416
Mom?

126
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,209
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Burgundy.

127
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,461
He no go to sleep.

128
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,212
Damn it, Lupita, what have
you been doing up there?

129
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,547
Eating nachos?

130
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,948
Mommy? Daddy? Why are you
yelling at each other?

131
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,325
Did Mom touch Dad's hair again?

132
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,139
Walter, honey, why don't you
just go to bed, all right?

133
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,475
Mommy and Daddy are
just having a discussion.

134
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,078
No! He needs to hear this.

135
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,663
He's six years old. He's a man.

136
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,665
Walter, listen to me.

137
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,399
Life isn't a fairy tale.

138
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,720
It's not a bunch of jumping
rope and grabbing ass.

139
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,131
It's complicated.

140
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,405
What do you want to
do with your life?

141
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,782
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

142
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,326
I want to be an
astronaut or a cowboy!

143
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,578
You're never going to be
any of those, okay?

144
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,704
Ron!

145
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,790
You've got to set the
bar a lot lower.

146
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,626
Service industry.
Fry cook. Prison guard.

147
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,276
Maybe you're a lighting
guy at a porn shoot.

148
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:48,364
Which basically means you hold up a
flashlight while adults do things.

149
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,927
He is a child, Ron!

150
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,638
Nah, nah, nah!
He's got hair on his nugs.

151
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,306
He's old enough to hear this.

152
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,641
Your father is a wise man.

153
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,915
I will lock you in a closet!

154
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,668
Veronica, here's the bottom line.

155
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,459
It's a very simple decision.

156
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,551
It's either me or the job.

157
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,429
It doesn't have to
be a choice, Ron.

158
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,427
Don't do this.

159
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,564
Don't throw away everything that
we've worked so hard for.

160
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,520
Me...

161
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,897
...or the job.

162
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,517
<i>Hello, and welcome</i>

163
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,769
<i>to the 3:10 Dolphin
Show at Sea World.</i>

164
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,105
<i>Sponsored by British Petroleum.</i>

165
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,649
<i>B.P. Oil, nature's best friend.</i>

166
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,799
<i>And now, here's your host,
Ron Burgundy.</i>

167
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,488
<i>Good afternoon, everyone.</i>

168
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,533
<i>And welcome to
world-famous Sea World,</i>

169
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,513
<i>here in San Diago, California.</i>

170
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:02,393
<i>Here's a fun fact, dolphins
aren't fish. They're mammals.</i>

171
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,903
<i>Here's another fun fact,</i>

172
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:11,114
<i>I haven't felt the loving embrace of
a human being in over three months.</i>

173
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:18,325
<i>I'm so lonely I paid a
hobo to spoon with me.</i>

174
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,125
<i>Let's bring out our
world-class trainers here,</i>

175
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,688
<i>Jesse and Paula.</i>

176
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,376
<i>Thank you. Thank you, Ron.</i>

177
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,569
<i>Sometimes I try to kiss 'em.</i>

178
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,615
<i>Oh, Ron Burgundy, everyone.</i>

179
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,783
<i>- I want to kiss you.
- No.</i>

180
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,284
<i>- Or I'll kiss your friend.
- No.</i>

181
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,244
<i>How about the two
trainers kiss each other?</i>

182
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,954
<i>What do you say, huh?</i>

183
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:46,482
<i>So, let's say hello to the stars
of the show, Chippy and Roo-roo!</i>

184
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,003
<i>For your information,</i>

185
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,483
<i>Chippy was rehabilitated
and Roo-roo is an asshole.</i>

186
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,942
<i>Ooh!</i>

187
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,511
<i>Look, they're swimming
and doing tricks!</i>

188
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,387
<i>Folks, what do you expect?
They're dolphins.</i>

189
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,599
<i>What did you say?</i>

190
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,559
<i>Look at you, with
that permanent smile.</i>

191
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,770
<i>You think you're so smart,
with your secret language.</i>

192
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,563
<i>You just fan' out of the
top of your head.</i>

193
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,802
- You're a punk, Ron Burgundy!
- Boo!

194
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,423
Children and animals hate you,
Ron Burgundy!

195
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,241
<i>I would eat dolphins
if it was legal!</i>

196
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,811
Unhand me, you buffoons!

197
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,331
All right, first, you threw
up in the shark tank.

198
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,750
Then you fed the seals
a chicken gyro?

199
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,252
And now this?

200
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,401
You're fired, you washed-up drunk!

201
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,339
Guess what, Trevor?

202
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,258
Every morning I get
here a half hour early

203
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,010
and I sexually assault a starfish!

204
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,348
This is the end of the road.
I'm not turning back.

205
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,935
Well, I know it's
not a pretty sight.

206
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,504
And you're gonna be
the sole witness.

207
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,715
If you can't handle it,
you leave the room.

208
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,651
It's too late, Baxter

209
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,446
I'm going the way of
the ancient samurai

210
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:00,367
who, when dishonored, would hang
themselves from a fluorescent light.

211
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,598
Goodbye, my sweet hairy prince.

212
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,665
Oh!

213
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,294
Oh!

214
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,504
Sweet cream on nipples!

215
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,965
Uh, Mr. Burgundy? Hello, I...

216
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,718
Oh, my God!

217
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,595
What the hell happened?

218
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,869
Um... Urn...

219
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,183
I tried to hang myself?

220
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,957
Because my life's a mess?

221
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,204
And I saw no other option?

222
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:32,463
I think you're telling the truth, but why
are you saying it like you're lying?

223
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,318
It was a call for help?

224
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,673
But it didn't work because I'm too
heavy and the ceiling lamp broke?

225
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,990
Something like that?

226
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,868
Yeah, I...
I think you're telling the truth.

227
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,063
I am. That's what happened.

228
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,355
Mmm. These are
first-rate flapjacks.

229
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:54,155
I'm telling you, suicide makes you
hungry, I don't care what anyone says.

230
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:58,906
My name is Freddie Shapp, and I'm
a producer of a new kind of news.

231
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,663
We're starting a
24-hour news channel.

232
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,138
First of its kind!

233
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,038
GNN. The Global News Network.

234
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,666
That is without a doubt the
dumbest thing I've ever heard.

235
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,318
You mean news going 24
hours around the clock?

236
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,779
A channel that's never
off, in other words?

237
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,225
Yeah. Yeah. Just 24 hours.
It's, uh...

238
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,054
No offense, but you
are a stupid asshole.

239
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,873
Mr. Burgundy, I assure you
we are 100% for real.

240
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,542
We've got state-of-the-art
facilities in Manhattan.

241
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,773
And Kench Allenby, multi-millionaire
and owner of Koala Airlines.

242
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,424
So glad he was acquitted of murder.

243
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,448
I'm a big Kench Allenby guy.

244
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,576
He's funding the whole network.
He believes in it.

245
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,665
I don't think you
understand, Freddie.

246
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:52,586
My hero, Mack Tannen, told me I was
the worst journalist he'd ever seen.

247
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,857
I'm not good enough.

248
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,959
Here.

249
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,546
This is your first week's salary.

250
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,342
By the hymen of Olivia Newton-John!

251
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,348
What do you say, Ron?

252
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,022
I'll take the job.

253
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,815
And I swear I'll be
number one again.

254
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:18,338
I'll take back my son,
restore my reputation,

255
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,590
and make everything
right with Veronica.

256
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,384
But more importantly,

257
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:26,661
I'm going to do what God put Ron
Burgundy on this Earth to do.

258
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,952
Have salon-quality hair
and read the news.

259
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,770
Ron... You've made my day.

260
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,169
I've got the best damn
news team in the world.

261
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,420
- Your call.
- I just have to find them.

262
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,663
San Diago. Looks like we begin
our search right here at home.

263
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,792
Last I heard, Champ Kind was fired for
being drunk on the air and saying,

264
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:59,713
"The only Olympic sport Filipinos are
good at is eating cats and dogs."

265
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,302
- Who loves chicken? You do!
- We do!

266
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,721
<i>Delicious chicken
Swing on through</i>

267
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,973
<i>Meet the crew, hoo-hoo!</i>

268
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:14,102
I'm local San Diego legend Champ
Kind, and I believe in two things.

269
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,145
Good chicken,

270
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:19,358
and that the census is a way for
the U.N. to make your children gay.

271
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,485
So come on by and grab a wing.

272
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,681
<i>'Cause when you do,
you'll say, "Whammy!"</i>

273
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,740
<i>No Catholics or Jews admitted.</i>

274
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,033
All right, there you go.

275
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,762
One Whammy Special
with Whammy slaw.

276
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,997
There's a used Band-Aid
in my coleslaw.

277
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,083
My gosh, let me take care of that.

278
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,544
Get out of here before I smash
your head in, you Commie bastard!

279
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,273
If you're from the census,
you take me off your list!

280
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,134
You never did have much of
a bedside manner, Champ.

281
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,178
Ron? Ron Burgundy?

282
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,430
- Get over here!
- How are you, friend?

283
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,875
God, I have longed for you.

284
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,351
It's good to see you, too.

285
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,954
Oh, this feels like home.

286
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,687
Are you all right?

287
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,836
Yeah, I'm fine. Better now.

288
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,676
Okay, let's break the
huddle here, huh?

289
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,070
- Okay. All right.
- All right.

290
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,947
You get back here!

291
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,220
Don't be weird!

292
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,992
So, anyway,
Harken sat me down, he said,

293
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,079
"Champ, you're a dangerous
alcoholic, a racist,

294
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,748
"and I don't think you
know a lick about sports."

295
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,502
And I said, "Ed, you dirty Polack,
it's 10:00 in the morning.

296
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,878
"Let's go have some drinks

297
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,048
"and go to a baseball game where
the Mexicans hit some touchdowns."

298
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,174
Then he fires me!

299
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:30,512
Fortunately, on the way out the
door, I fake a work injury.

300
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,514
With the settlement,
I bought this place.

301
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,834
Well, I'm glad to see you
landed on your feet, Champ.

302
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,537
Listen, can I ask you a question?

303
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,167
Sure. Anything.

304
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,064
Is... Is this chicken?

305
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,008
Oh, hell, no.

306
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,679
It's really impossible to turn a
profit if you serve real chicken.

307
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,864
Yeah. We use mainly bats.

308
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:49,948
- What?
- Yeah.

309
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,143
But the good quality kind.

310
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,244
That's the most horrible
thing I've ever heard.

311
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,287
Yeah?

312
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,330
You got to do what you
got to do, right?

313
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,541
So what you got to do
is serve fried bats?

314
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,316
Yep. Do you know
what they call bats?

315
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,754
- Bats.
- "Chicken of the Cave."

316
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,798
No one calls them
Chicken of the Cave.

317
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,321
Who's "they," by the way?

318
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,762
There's a guy I met named Paco,
sells bikers speed at the pier.

319
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,474
So that guy calls them
Chicken of the Cave.

320
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,558
Yeah.

321
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,934
That's not "they."

322
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,270
Why don't you have a bite
and stop judging it?

323
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,063
I'm not going to bite
into a fried bat.

324
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,190
It's delicious.

325
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,043
It's all tendon. Look at it.

326
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,214
Was that a bat?

327
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,390
Chicken of the Cave.

328
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,179
What brings you here, Ron?

329
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,828
My friend, we've got a job.
In New York City.

330
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,556
Whammy! I'm in!

331
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,040
You've got yourself a sportscaster.

332
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,124
Oh, great.

333
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,397
Denny!

334
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,146
Lock up!

335
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,088
Any idea where Brian Fantana is?

336
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,632
You haven't heard?

337
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,406
Fantana hit the big time.

338
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,862
Aw, baby.

339
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,291
Yeah, that's it, play for me.
Just play around.

340
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,161
Roll around and lift
those legs up. Mmm!

341
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,210
You are a hairy little
thing, aren't you?

342
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,589
Yeah. Oh, I like what's happening!

343
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,467
Oh, that's it. Yeah. Yeah.

344
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,641
Oh, you little fuzzball,
that's... Oh!

345
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,516
I got it.

346
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,306
It's not getting any
better than that.

347
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,374
- That's brilliant!
- Yeah, yeah.

348
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,773
Hey, Brian, you have any
time for the little people?

349
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,483
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

350
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,304
- Hey, Brian.
- Champ! How you doing?

351
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,472
Hey!

352
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,974
- Wow. This is a...
- Cool it!

353
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,559
Oh, I can't believe...

354
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,227
Oh, wow. It's great to see you!

355
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,877
Welcome. Welcome to my doj'.

356
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,815
This place is spectacular!

357
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,108
- It's amazing.
- A bit chaotic today.

358
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,151
We got the Cat Fancy
cover coming out.

359
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,695
- You know how that can be.
- Ooh.

360
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,446
I've been living in a tent
for the last two years.

361
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,990
Oh, yeah, this is not that.

362
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,575
We got a sauna in the kitchen.

363
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,995
A lot of people think that's weird,
but I keep wine in it.

364
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,622
I'm not a wine guy,
but I know you got to keep it hot.

365
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,624
Oh, and check this out.

366
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,523
This... This was fun.

367
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,420
We shot this over two
weeks in Prague.

368
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,693
Wow.

369
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,923
You know what they call cats?

370
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,402
- Chicken of the rail yard.
- No.

371
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,362
- What?
- Don't indulge him.

372
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,054
- Yeah.
- There's a lot of meat.

373
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,556
But I love it.

374
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,559
And what's so great about
it is it's so damn true.

375
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,707
I hate Mondays!

376
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,854
I'm not a Monday guy.

377
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,689
Ron hates Mondays.

378
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,774
Hell, I'm not crazy
about them, either.

379
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,068
I also don't like Tuesdays,
Wednesdays or Thursdays.

380
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,572
So why are you guys here, anyway?

381
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:39,576
Well, Brian, we're getting the
news team back together again.

382
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,619
Really?

383
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,912
And, of course, we want to
know if you'll join us.

384
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,456
Jeez, I don't know.

385
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,042
I kind of got the world
by the tail here.

386
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,710
I don't know if I can.

387
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:49,878
Christ, I get it.

388
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,963
I mean, you're the Quincy
Jones of cat photographers.

389
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,407
Why would you leave all this?

390
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,050
Hey, Brian, I don't
know if you heard,

391
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,779
but New York has
all-nude strip clubs.

392
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,579
The question still remains...

393
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,539
Where's Brick Tamland?

394
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,769
Oh.

395
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,437
You guys didn't hear?

396
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:08,980
No, what happened?

397
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,128
Brick's...

398
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,094
Dead.

399
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,869
Brick was lost at sea

400
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,313
- about a year ago.
- Oh.

401
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,123
Thought he saw a bird and
he swam out to pet it.

402
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,396
He never came back.

403
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,169
We all loved Brick,

404
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,755
even though he never
had a phone number,

405
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:37,175
or address or Social
Security number.

406
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,887
In six years of working at the
station, he never cashed a paycheck.

407
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,097
That sweet Brick.

408
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,498
He was a sensitive man, though.

409
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:48,747
He told me he wanted to donate his
organs to science before he died,

410
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,423
so he could see where
they ended up.

411
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,754
He'll long be remembered
and he'll be sorely missed.

412
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,472
Thank you, Reverend.

413
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,975
- Oh.
- Oh, come on!

414
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,247
- Brick was a great man.
- Really?

415
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,915
And I will miss him so much.

416
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,584
And I will not rest until
I find his killer.

417
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,044
- What?
- His killer?

418
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,240
It is hard for me to believe
that he is gone.

419
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,359
He's not gone.

420
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,636
I feel that I just
saw him yesterday.

421
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,680
You were probably talking
to yourself in a mirror.

422
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,955
When I got the news...

423
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,246
I didn't even know how
to make sense out of it!

424
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,588
None of us understand!

425
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,708
Why? Why?

426
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,067
Why did you take him from us?

427
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,653
You're clearly standing
in front of us, Brick.

428
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,097
God damn you!

429
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,157
- Brick!
- Brick is dead!

430
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,033
- No, Brick's alive.
- Brick is dead!

431
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,452
- Look at him!
- He's not dead.

432
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,745
He's not dead, Brick.
You're not dead.

433
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,288
- You're Brick!
- Brick, it's you!

434
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,664
He's dead!

435
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,749
No!

436
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,084
You are Brick! Touch yourself.

437
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,529
- I am Brick?
- Yes!

438
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,861
- I'm alive?
- Yes!

439
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,424
Of course.

440
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,925
Of course you are.

441
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,260
Oh, for heaven's sake.

442
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,013
You kind of want to slug him.
You want to slug him.

443
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,978
Do you remember our
Easter trip to San Francisco?

444
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,023
We got so drunk, we put
Brick in a refrigerator box

445
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,923
and threw him off the
Golden Gate Bridge.

446
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:19,928
I broke my back!

447
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,281
What about the time
that you dared Champ

448
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,658
to drink that beer
stein full of Woolite?

449
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,119
He drained it faster than you
could say, "No, don't do it.

450
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,205
"That's the equivalent of
drinking poison."

451
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,398
Oh, Lord, I was in
a six-month coma.

452
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,670
And they say from the
neurological damage,

453
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,025
there's no way I live past 55!

454
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,969
You got three years
left, my friend.

455
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,913
You're gonna die!

456
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,308
Hey, hey, remember?

457
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,562
I was by myself and I had that
dream about the orange tree.

458
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,667
But instead of oranges,
it had babies on it.

459
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,844
It was a baby tree!

460
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,738
Brick, how could we remember?
It's your dream.

461
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,264
I don't know.
It's all the same thing.

462
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,080
It's an interesting dream,
but we're telling stories

463
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,249
involving the entire
news team from the past.

464
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:21,589
Or how about the time when I was
born and I came out of the vagina?

465
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,157
I was screaming, "Here I come!
Oh! Here I come, Mom!"

466
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,517
First off, Brick, I highly doubt
you remember your own birth.

467
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,436
And, once again, we weren't there.

468
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,505
Ron, I can't...

469
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,970
I can't stop laughing, Ron!

470
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,968
Put a pencil in his mouth.

471
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,424
It's okay.

472
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,241
There you go.

473
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,034
I'm okay now.

474
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,435
Man, this just feels right!
The news team is back!

475
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,860
Ron, Brian, Brick, me, even Baxter!

476
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,198
That old man is so
little and hairy!

477
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,549
Hey, Ron, who's driving?

478
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,652
Oh, it's okay,
it's on cruise control.

479
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,116
Who wants some chimichangas, huh?

480
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,707
Best thing I ever did was install
this deep fryer in the 'bago.

481
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,520
Ron, why do you have
this bag of bowling balls

482
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,814
and this terrarium
filled with scorpions?

483
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,859
- Oh, it's a long, crazy story!
- Hey, Ron.

484
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,463
Cruise control just regulates
speed, it doesn't steer.

485
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,052
- Come again?
- Oh!

486
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,051
Well, that is gonna
make one hell of a story.

487
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,520
The Big Apple. Ron
Burgundy is back.

488
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,605
Why do they call it
the Big Apple, Ron?

489
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,710
Because New York has
an apple tree on every street.

490
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:51,557
Here we are. Welcome to GNN.

491
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,120
I don't know, Ron.
You sure about this place?

492
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,539
Guys, I know it's a bit of a mess,
but trust me,

493
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,542
everything will be ready
for the launch tomorrow.

494
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:06,546
And we've culled the whole
country for the best newsmen.

495
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,297
There's Curtis
Knightfish from Houston.

496
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,632
Oh, Curtis Knightfish.

497
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,467
They don't get any
better than that.

498
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,637
And there's Diane
Yahwea from Carson City.

499
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,223
Diane Yahwea. You know
what they call her, right?

500
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,017
"All the Way Yahwea."

501
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,435
She's my aunt.

502
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,645
And the best in the biz.

503
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,249
Jack Lime, out of Chicago.

504
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:29,420
Rumor is Allenby is giving
him one mil a year.

505
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,718
That's crazy.
Who's worth that kind of money?

506
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,677
Oh, my God!
He's absolutely magnificent!

507
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,704
I bet his poop smells
like sandalwood.

508
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,432
Can I help you, guy?

509
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,999
What was that?

510
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,500
I said, "Can I help you, guy?"

511
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,878
Uh... What do you mean?

512
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,380
Well, you're staring
at me, hotshot.

513
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,257
Do you want my autograph?

514
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:57,138
No, he was just explaining who you
were and I was looking at you.

515
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:00,413
And then he said something
and I was still looking at you.

516
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,108
Jack Lime is a great man!

517
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,633
Is that what I sound
like when I talk?

518
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,909
Is there a problem?

519
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,952
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no. No problem.

520
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,371
Well, you're making a face
like you got a problem.

521
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,373
Um, I'm sorry that I'm
making that face.

522
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,585
I don't mean to make a face that
seems like I have a problem.

523
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,003
I don't like that face!

524
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,797
You need to change it,
and change it quick.

525
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,215
Stop making that face.

526
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,092
Is this face better?

527
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,218
Oh, I don't like...

528
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:38,513
Oh, that new face is driving
me crazy! Change it, now!

529
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,889
You're getting him mad.

530
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,992
I only have so many faces.

531
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,520
I'm just grinding your
gears, man.

532
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,396
Welcome to the station!

533
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,125
We're going to have
a good time together.

534
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,930
Oh, my God.
That's vintage Jack Lime.

535
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,155
Come on, guys.

536
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,508
Let's go meet the boss.

537
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,659
We'll have separate cameras

538
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,604
for you, and then sports
and then weather.

539
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,081
Let me ask you this, Freddie,
how's the new head honcho?

540
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:08,732
Well, Linda Jackson has
a shelf full of Emmys.

541
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:13,316
She's as tough as nails.
And Linda loves to win.

542
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,341
Oh, hey, Linda!

543
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,241
I want to introduce
you to Ron Burgundy.

544
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,556
Linda Jackson.
How are you, my friend?

545
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,658
Ron.

546
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,077
This is Linda Jackson.

547
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,079
Hello, Mr. Burgundy.

548
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,547
Oh. Uh...

549
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,541
Black.

550
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,844
- Black.
- Jesus, just stop, Ron.

551
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:39,387
I'm terribly sorry. I don't
know why I can't stop saying...

552
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,784
Black. The word "black."

553
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,478
Hello, Mr. Burgundy.

554
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,454
- Black.
- Stop.

555
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,664
Black.

556
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,937
Stop saying "black."

557
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,441
- Black. If I don't say it, I'll pass out.
- Stop saying it!

558
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,592
Uh, Donna, can you please
get me a cup of coffee?

559
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,719
- Right away, Ms. Jackson.
- Thank you.

560
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,039
- Please be seated. Everyone.
- Sure.

561
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,582
Please be seated.

562
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,937
Great. So I know that all of you
are aware that the news community

563
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,648
is laughing at what we're trying
to do here at 24-hour news.

564
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,317
But that is why they brought me in.

565
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,526
She's the best!

566
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,862
You see, gentlemen, I don't lose.

567
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,989
Listen, I feel like I
need to clear the air.

568
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,407
Oh, please don't.

569
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,409
I want to say, on behalf
of the entire news team,

570
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:28,331
we are huge supporters
of all African and Americans.

571
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,309
Veronica got so tan!

572
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,628
I remember the first African
and American I ever saw.

573
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,504
It's African-American.

574
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,256
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

575
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,842
Absolutely 100% positive?
It isn't like...

576
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,093
Ron...

577
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,637
Fish and chips?

578
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:46,849
Hey, we're all the same on
the inside, stinky and pink.

579
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,934
When I was in high school,

580
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,019
me and my buddies used to sneak
in the girls' locker room.

581
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,520
We'd peek at the
girls in the shower,

582
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:55,191
and I'd look at all of them,
no matter what color they were.

583
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,339
So...

584
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,445
Jesus, this is the worst
meeting I've ever been in.

585
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,989
A black man follows me
everywhere when it's sunny.

586
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,242
Actually, I think that's
your shadow, Brick.

587
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,701
I call him Leon.

588
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,954
And if it's a cloudy day,
what happens to Leon?

589
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,038
He goes home.

590
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,081
It's your shadow.

591
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,207
He's talking about his shadow.

592
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,857
Shut your damn mouths! Sit down!

593
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,463
What's he doing?

594
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,341
I think you scared him.
You can't shout at Brick.

595
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,035
Is he all right?

596
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,845
Can you sing him a
soothing siren song?

597
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,222
Just a high melodic...

598
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,539
I'm not singing along with you.

599
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,562
Oh, come on, Brick. Brick!

600
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,415
Linda has a balloon.

601
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,403
You better get him a balloon.

602
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,612
Is this for real, Freddie?

603
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,155
Linda, I'm sorry.

604
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,907
No, it's okay! It's okay.

605
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,201
So you have a black boss,
and it's freaking you out.

606
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,411
Is it freaking you out?

607
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,496
- A little bit, to be honest.
- You freaked out?

608
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,599
- Is it freaking you out?
- Oh, she's got a knife!

609
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,625
I don't give a shit!

610
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,854
We're not all here to hold
hands and sing Kumbaya.

611
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,648
Black.

612
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:02,951
So as long as you guys get numbers,
we are gonna get along just fine.

613
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,470
Now, if you don't,
I am gonna be icy.

614
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,930
And unpleasant, you dig?

615
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,750
I dig. We all dig.

616
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,101
I like to dig.

617
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:15,980
One time I went digging for
treasure and I found a half a body.

618
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,857
Get out of my office!

619
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:22,069
I'm telling you, you can't give
an inch in those situations,

620
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,030
and I think we held our
ground pretty firmly.

621
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,281
Guys.

622
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:28,659
Guys, we got you an apartment
on the Upper East Side

623
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,328
and a whole new wardrobe.

624
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,456
That's wonderful! When do
we begin our broadcast?

625
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:34,957
Well, the big launch is tomorrow

626
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,625
- at 12:00 noon.
- Okay.

627
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:40,651
You guys are slotted for the
2:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. slot.

628
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,201
What? That's the graveyard shift!

629
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,199
"I ain't afraid of no ghost."

630
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,429
Oh, come on,
it's going to be great.

631
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,514
Let's get your keys. Come on!

632
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,809
Is there booze in the apartment?

633
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,890
Of course there's
gonna be booze. Of course.

634
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,361
It won't stop.

635
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,940
Sometimes it stops,
but then it starts again.

636
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,904
What are you doing,
Chani? Answer it!

637
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,157
Hi. Yes, let me transfer you.

638
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,784
Your job is to answer the phones.

639
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,685
I'm getting ready for Secret Santa.
When is that again?

640
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,835
It's at Christmastime.
When else would it be?

641
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,466
I'm Brick. I was dead last week.

642
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,218
I'm Chani.

643
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,635
I like the place between
your head and your body.

644
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,599
I like your hair.

645
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,688
It looks like wet popcorn.

646
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,748
Thank you.

647
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,501
Would you like to see the smile that
I use when I pose for photographs?

648
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,774
Yes, please.

649
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,574
Do you want to see the face I make
when I see a snake made out of candy?

650
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,859
Yes.

651
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,163
That's good.

652
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,746
What's your favorite time of day?

653
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,992
Now.

654
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,912
What's your favorite time of day?

655
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,630
A minute ago.

656
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,003
Urn...

657
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,331
Surprise! Big daddy's back.

658
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,581
Ron.

659
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,650
What are you doing here?

660
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,504
I'm over at GNN.
I'm living in the city again.

661
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,239
I really wish that you
would have called first.

662
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,950
Look, it doesn't matter whose
fault the break-up was, okay?

663
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,494
I was stubborn.

664
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:21,207
You were like a mentally ill whore
having PMS from the 1800s.

665
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,060
What's your point, Ron?

666
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:27,156
The point is I'm back home.

667
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,673
And I want to spend the
rest of my life...

668
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,321
Honey, who is it?

669
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,706
Hi, Ron. I'm Gary,
Veronica's lover.

670
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,175
So, is that a gift for me, Ron?

671
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,423
No, it's not.

672
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:55,759
It's for Walter.

673
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,014
Okay.

674
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,370
So when were you going
to tell me about Gary?

675
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,288
Ron. You walked out on me.

676
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,188
What did you expect me to do?

677
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,563
Ron. This is awkward, I know.

678
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,986
I'm sitting here with your wife.
We make love.

679
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,426
I'm this close to shooting
a flare gun at your dick.

680
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,653
Oh, Ron!

681
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,013
So what does this Gary
do for a living, huh?

682
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,515
Have you done a
background check on him?

683
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,016
Gary is actually

684
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,520
one of the most successful psychologists
in all of Manhattan, Ron.

685
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:25,668
Really sweet.

686
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,624
Are you reading my mind right now?

687
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,715
Ron, do you even know
what a psychologist is?

688
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,304
Fuck you.

689
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,302
Ron!

690
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,865
- It's okay.
- You stop that!

691
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,284
He's externalizing. That's okay.

692
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,411
- No, it's not okay.
- He's mad.

693
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:44,039
You knew I was going to throw that
punch 'cause you're reading my mind!

694
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,193
Morn! I'm home!

695
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:48,752
- Hey, little guy.
- Hey, darling.

696
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,651
- Hi, Walter.
- Hey, Dad.

697
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,820
I missed you!

698
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,489
Walter, your father
has a gift for you.

699
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,119
I have a gift specifically
for you, Walter.

700
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,223
There you go.

701
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,541
Yes, Gary.

702
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,565
Okay, that's actually
for me, Walter.

703
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,859
No, it's not. It's for Walter.

704
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,337
It's a superhero costume.

705
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,845
What is it?

706
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,762
It's "Lace Man."
It's a brand new superhero.

707
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,159
I'm going to be Lace Man!

708
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,994
Look, Ron. Joint
custody isn't easy.

709
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:26,350
But what we need to do is rally around
this little guy right now, okay?

710
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,833
That's never gonna happen.

711
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,335
- Oh...
- Excuse me?

712
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,712
Because you, Veronica,
are unfit to be a mother!

713
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:35,363
Need I remind you that you
took that child to a cock fight?

714
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,259
- The game of champions!
- I'm Lace Man!

715
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,828
He had the time of his life!

716
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,804
He came home splattered in blood!

717
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,766
He picked eight winning cocks.
It's never been done!

718
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,559
You have never tried
to connect with Walter.

719
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,480
All right, let's keep it civil
in front of the boy.

720
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,983
It's bad enough his mother likes
to go down on rodeo clowns.

721
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,235
- Okay, you know what, out!
- All right. Get your things! Let's go.

722
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,278
Fine. I'm out of here.

723
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,155
- Don't have to tell me twice.
- Get your things.

724
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,741
- We'll see you guys later.
- Yes, you will.

725
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,577
Goodbye, Dad! Thanks
for the present.

726
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,397
Goodbye, Walter, my little man.

727
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,934
You promise to do
good in school, okay?

728
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,335
- Okay.
- And stay away from the he-shes

729
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,503
- Ron!
- Down in the Bowery.

730
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,505
Ron, I don't think
that's appropriate.

731
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,340
I'll tell you, those fellas,

732
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,300
they got the looks,
they got the curves,

733
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,153
they got the chi-chi's,

734
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,930
and then at some point
during the evening,

735
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,098
you reach down below the belt

736
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,933
looking to get a little muffellita,

737
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:29,163
and you get a handful
of the Battle of the Bulge.

738
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,880
You hear what I'm saying, Walter?

739
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,256
Yes, I do.

740
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,816
Ron, it was nice meeting you.

741
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,090
I think it's time for you to go.

742
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,050
Oh, Ron!

743
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,406
You knew!

744
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,366
You anticipated that because
you're reading my mind!

745
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,559
That confirms it!

746
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,460
There's Lime!

747
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,405
Look at him. He's a goddamn prince!

748
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,842
Man, there's just something
about him, you know?

749
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,911
I'd give anything to
be friends with him.

750
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,430
I don't see what the
big deal is, you know.

751
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:05,908
He's not that great.

752
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,126
What did you say?

753
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,163
What's that?

754
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,755
I heard you say something.

755
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,082
Oh.

756
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,672
Oh, what did I say?
Oh, nothing.

757
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,402
Oh, no. I heard you say something.

758
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,820
He said you're not that great!

759
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:20,922
Brick!

760
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,966
Is that what you said about me?

761
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,638
- He's coming over here.
- I know!

762
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,602
I'm gonna rip this guy in half.

763
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,731
No, no, no! Just give me
a little piece of him.

764
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,124
Uh, Jack, look, it's just...

765
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,669
The guys look up to you so much,
and I just was a little jealous.

766
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,113
I just said some junk.

767
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,298
That's funny.

768
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:44,621
Aren't you the guy who
lost his job to his wife?

769
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,410
Ooh!

770
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,871
Shouldn't you be doing her makeup?

771
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,799
- All right, guys, that's enough.
- No, shut up, Freddie!

772
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,860
And you can shut your mouth,
okay, Jack "Lame!"

773
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,589
- Ooh.
- Ooh!

774
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,826
Yeah. Mr. Butt-Vagina's
got some fight in him.

775
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,787
You listen to this one,

776
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:10,980
- big fella.
- Yeah.

777
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,694
I bet you that we beat
your ratings tonight.

778
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,923
I'm sorry. I'm trying
to keep it together.

779
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,008
No, no, no. Don't do this.
Don't do this.

780
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,862
You're on at 2:00 a.m.
Jack has prime time!

781
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,831
Maybe... No. Hey, Freddie, no, no.
Hey.

782
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,202
I'll take that bet.
What are the stakes?

783
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,546
If we lose, I'll leave New York.

784
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,462
And I'll never read the news again.

785
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:41,985
And if by some snowball's
chance in hell

786
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,155
Mr. Mustache here pulls a
miracle out of his ass?

787
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:51,017
You change your name
to Jack Lame! Legally.

788
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,941
I like this! You're on, Stretch.

789
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,667
Everyone heard him?

790
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,469
- Freddie, you heard him?
- Yeah. I heard him.

791
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,565
- This is on like Pong.
- Okay. Good.

792
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,971
Why? Why did you
make that bet, Ron?

793
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,575
We've got the graveyard shift!
We don't have a chance!

794
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,584
- Hey, guy!
- Ah!

795
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,853
This ain't local news anymore.

796
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,422
We shit standing up here.

797
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:18,711
What?

798
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,712
It's a huge mess,
but damn, is it cool!

799
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,797
All right, everyone!

800
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,049
Ladies and gentlemen,

801
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:34,185
today wouldn't be possible without
the visionary behind GNN.

802
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,999
Mr. Kench Allenby!

803
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,898
Yeah, yeah!

804
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,733
Thank you.

805
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,774
All right, cheer.

806
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:49,595
I am jabbered, just jabbered,
full of beans, no doubt.

807
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,680
Does anyone else speak Australian?

808
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,408
I thought they talked like us.

809
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,537
Can I get you to say
with me, haw-ba-ya-ya!

810
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,023
We can't quite understand you.

811
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,877
How's this? I'm Kench Allenby.

812
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,986
- Oh, yes. That's good.
- There we go! Thank you so much.

813
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,406
I'm Kench Allenby and
you all know my story.

814
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,633
I'm a self-made man.

815
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:15,412
My late, great father, Vadge
Allenby, gave me $300 million,

816
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:20,709
and I toiled my whole bloody life
to turn that into $305 million.

817
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,483
True story. True story.

818
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,189
Wow.

819
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,965
But this is 24-hour news station...

820
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,592
This is history.

821
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,802
This is like Columbus
discovering the New World.

822
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:35,830
And the captain of this fantastic
voyage is the best newsman in America,

823
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,460
Mr. Jack Lime!

824
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,047
Go get 'em, Jack! Go get 'em!

825
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:44,130
Thank you. And good luck
to Ron Burgundy, too.

826
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,026
Ooh.

827
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,674
Getting nervous there, <i>compadre?</i>

828
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,131
Let's do this.

829
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,616
Did you see that? How he
spun on that desk? So great.

830
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,310
All right. Quiet on
the floor, please.

831
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,828
All right.

832
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,681
All right. We're up.
Here we go, here we go.

833
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:02,478
In five, four, three, two...

834
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,964
Good day, and welcome to GNN.

835
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:10,945
Thank you for joining us on what we
believe to be a whole new era of news.

836
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,469
I'm Jack Lime,

837
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,932
your guide for this journey of
events we humbly call 24-hour news.

838
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,976
<i>Today's top story,
Mount St. Helene.</i>

839
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:22,104
Oh, this is just a gimmick.
It's a flash in the pan.

840
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,548
We better hope so.

841
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,190
<i>Residents are being asked
to evacuate the area...</i>

842
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,900
Twenty-four hours of news.

843
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,736
How are they gonna keep
coming up with this stuff?

844
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,073
My guess is they'll probably be
scraping the bottom of the barrel.

845
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,826
No, I have a feeling they'll
stick with their integrity

846
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,680
and only report the news
that needs to be reported.

847
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,247
Let's see here.

848
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:44,398
"Global temperatures rise half a degree,
alarm climate scientists." Boring.

849
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,693
"China could dominate the world
economy in the next decade."

850
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,382
<i>Dun-dun-dun
dun-dun-dun, dun-dun</i>

851
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:51,609
Nope.

852
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,010
Anyone else?

853
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,658
What if we show a porno
instead of the news?

854
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,780
Freddie?

855
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,782
No. Absolutely not.

856
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,934
I know. What if we get one
of those wildlife handlers?

857
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,062
We have him bring in,
oh, big game cats.

858
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:08,442
You know, wild, dangerous tigers and
lions and leopards and the such.

859
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:12,237
We let them loose inside the studio
with about a dozen chickens.

860
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:16,158
We play rock music. And we
just call it <i>Let Her Rip.</i>

861
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,160
I'd watch that. I'd watch that.

862
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,578
<i>Let Her Rip?</i>

863
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:23,248
You're describing the end of
civilization. That's not news!

864
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,916
If that's the end of times, I'm...

865
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,336
I got a front-row seat with a
big tub of buttered popcorn

866
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:31,465
and a greasy half-live chicken leg.

867
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,925
Okay, so obviously this is
a waste of time. I'm done.

868
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,135
Freddie! Come on!

869
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,704
We're just brainstorming here.

870
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,473
We're trying to figure out how
to make the news less boring,

871
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,747
and you act like we
peed in your milkshake.

872
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,186
The news is supposed
to be boring, Ron!

873
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,880
This is serious stuff.

874
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,545
You're the one that
made this stupid bet!

875
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,943
I just don't know why we
have to tell the people

876
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,967
what they need to hear.

877
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,724
Why can't we just tell them
what they want to hear?

878
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,268
Wait, wait, wait.

879
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,055
Say that again.

880
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,415
I said, why do we have
to tell the people

881
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,610
what they need to hear?

882
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,275
Why can't we just tell them
what they want to hear?

883
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,315
And what do they
want to hear, Ron?

884
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,569
That we live in the greatest
country God ever created.

885
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,621
- Damn straight!
- Made him happy.

886
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,957
And we should do
stories on patriots.

887
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,351
Cute, funny little animals, huh?
Or diets.

888
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,422
Why blondes have more fun.

889
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,397
And serious investigative pieces,

890
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,967
about how much ejaculate
is on hotel duvets.

891
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,402
And only the best
sports highlights.

892
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,973
Home runs, slam dunks,
touchdowns and no soccer.

893
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,349
I like the wind!

894
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,618
Brick's right.
People love hurricanes.

895
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,453
Tornadoes, earthquakes, floods,

896
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,038
we'll throw Brick right
in the middle of it.

897
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,140
You'd do that?

898
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,526
People'll go nuts. I'd watch that!

899
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,795
No, this goes against every rule

900
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,490
of broadcast journalism I know.

901
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,240
Freddie, as the wise man once said,

902
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,619
"So?"

903
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,055
We got 10 hours till we go on.

904
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,453
We'll only need eight!

905
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,334
Lady

906
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,889
<i>I'm your knight in shining armor</i>

907
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,349
<i>And I love you</i>

908
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,722
<i>You have made me what I am</i>

909
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:29,150
<i>And I am yours</i>

910
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,565
<i>My love...</i>

911
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,912
- Is that candy?
- I don't know.

912
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,252
It is candy.

913
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,832
- I like you.
- I like you.

914
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,426
Tell me something about you.

915
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:59,214
Well, I'm 19 years old.
My middle name is Courtney.

916
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:02,949
I can always guess how many jelly
beans are in a jelly bean jar,

917
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,427
even if it's not right.

918
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,099
What about you?

919
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,496
My name is Chani Lastnamé.

920
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,316
I'm a real go-getter
and a person people.

921
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:16,027
I can type 50 words a minute
with only 300 errors.

922
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,632
I'm trained and certified...

923
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,675
To fire a military-grade
missile launcher.

924
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,777
Me, too.

925
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,056
Chani, I just got these phone
messages from last week.

926
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:27,557
You mailed them to me?

927
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,752
How else was I gonna
get them to you?

928
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,686
You hand them to me.

929
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,959
Oh.

930
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,482
You are the dumbest person
I've met in my entire life,

931
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,859
and that's not an exaggeration.

932
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,110
That makes me feel bad.

933
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,321
Well, it's the truth, Chani.

934
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,969
You!

935
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:46,220
- Leave her alone!
- Excuse me, sir.

936
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,914
Get your filthy hands off of her!

937
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,207
Help, help!

938
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,375
Excuse me, sir!

939
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,627
- Leave me alone, lady!
- Excuse me!

940
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:58,481
She is a goddess among women!

941
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,444
Glen!

942
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,719
My phone messages!

943
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,822
Leave him alone!

944
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,157
Not today!

945
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,643
- She has butterflies in her heart!
- Chani!

946
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:14,604
I can see you behind that
desk, and you're fired!

947
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,831
Why?

948
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,346
Are you okay?

949
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,844
You saved my life.

950
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,180
She was trying to set me on fire.

951
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,957
I didn't ask for these powers.

952
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,526
I was given them.

953
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,781
Last night a bird chased me,

954
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,149
and I wished it was you.

955
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,676
Can we go to a date?

956
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,529
Yes.

957
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:04,180
Dear God, please help
me pull this off.

958
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:08,616
I swear, if you help me,
I will become a monk.

959
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,721
I will shave my head
and become a monk...

960
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,728
Ah, who are we kidding?
I'm not going to do that.

961
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,124
Oh, did you hear?

962
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,227
Evan said there's some strange
copy in the prompter.

963
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,753
It's 2:00 a.m.

964
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,963
It's Freddie Shapp's ass,
not mine. Let's go.

965
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,785
<i>People who change history are
rarely aware of it while doing so.</i>

966
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:31,533
<i>Ron and his news team simply thought
they were making the news more fun.</i>

967
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:36,936
<i>Little did they know they were changing
the course of broadcast history forever.</i>

968
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:40,041
Hello, America. It's 2:00 a.m.
Eastern time.

969
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:44,171
I'm Ron Burgundy,
and tonight's top story is

970
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,797
America.

971
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,844
She's the greatest
country in the world.

972
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,783
<i>Heck, the history of the world!</i>

973
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:50,976
You're damn right!

974
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:56,081
<i>Too much of the news is about
what's wrong with America.</i>

975
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,123
Amen, brother!

976
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,103
Well, tonight, our top story
is what's right with America.

977
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,921
Someone's finally talking
sense on the TV.

978
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,340
For starters, we kick butt.

979
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,739
Nazi butt. Russian butt.

980
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,302
What the hell is he doing?

981
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,887
He's talking about America.

982
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,368
Why, do you have a
problem with that?

983
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:15,201
Tonight I begin part one
of my 11-part series

984
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:18,079
on the power and mystery
of the human vagina.

985
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,854
<i>This series will be a tasteful look</i>

986
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,549
<i>at just what makes a vagina tick,</i>

987
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,151
<i>as well as a look at the
50 greatest vaginae</i>

988
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,424
<i>of the 20th century.</i>

989
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,762
Son of a bitch!

990
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,157
<i>One final question,
and I'll let you go.</i>

991
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,202
Who tops the list of the
top 50 greatest vaginae?

992
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,454
Well, I don't want to
give anything away.

993
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,603
I thought I had you.

994
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,542
I will give you number two.

995
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:41,835
- Please.
- Madame Curie.

996
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,609
Of course. Of course.

997
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,213
Whammy! Whammy!

998
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:47,132
Whammy! Whammy! Whammy!

999
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:49,110
Whammy!

1000
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:55,849
<i>Whammy!</i>

1001
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,122
Back to you, Ron.

1002
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,061
The wind is really windy.

1003
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,564
Brick? Brick, can you hear me?

1004
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,292
I can't hear you, Ron!

1005
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,734
Okay, but you're
answering the question,

1006
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,236
so I think you can hear me.

1007
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:09,404
No, I can!

1008
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,239
Brick, do you think
there is any danger

1009
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,657
to the average person out there?

1010
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,227
<i>I'm afraid for the animals
of New York, Ron.</i>

1011
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:20,149
I saw a woman, and her dog
never touched the ground.

1012
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,811
You're saying wind gusts as
fast as a supersonic jet?

1013
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,439
It looked like she was
walking a dog balloon.

1014
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,024
And go... Switch.

1015
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,801
And for our eighth and final
animal story of the night,

1016
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,554
it looks like residents
of North Yulk, Montana,

1017
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,055
have found the cutest
little patriot

1018
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,124
<i>on God's green earth.</i>

1019
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,209
Look at that little guy!

1020
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,084
Oh, wow, he was having some fun.

1021
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,570
Well, for all of us here at GNN,

1022
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,405
I'm Ron Burgundy.

1023
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,699
And don't just have a great night,

1024
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,848
have an American night.

1025
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,414
And we're out!

1026
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,313
Wow!

1027
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,585
I couldn't take my eyes

1028
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,188
- off the screen!
- Yes.

1029
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,756
You were electric, Ron! Whammy!

1030
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,633
That just felt right!
That felt right!

1031
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:12,926
I was outside!

1032
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,345
You sure were, Brick.
Wonderful job.

1033
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:16,930
Amazing. Great job.

1034
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:20,786
What the hell was that?
What the hell was that?

1035
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,602
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, Linda.

1036
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,103
We were just trying something new.

1037
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,813
You changed the format
of the entire show

1038
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,632
without consulting me?
That's unacceptable!

1039
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,818
Damn straight, sister. We just
done went and brought it!

1040
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,488
And here's the truth.
You can't handle it, little mama!

1041
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,263
Get out! You are all
terminated immediately.

1042
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,307
If you were a man,
I'd knock you out.

1043
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:41,246
Oh. Oh, really? Well, go ahead!

1044
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:43,475
Take a swing! Take your best shot!

1045
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,333
I have five brothers,

1046
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:47,544
and two of them are defensive
backs in the NFL, so come on!

1047
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,254
- You want me to do it?
- Yeah.

1048
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,838
This thing's not gonna feel good.

1049
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,881
Do it, Ron. Just do it.

1050
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,030
Are you scared? What's the problem?

1051
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,161
Is he a chicken? Are you a chicken?

1052
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:00,829
I'm not a chicken at all.

1053
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,184
I'm going to make that
mustache of yours all bloody.

1054
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,205
Well...

1055
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,398
Seems like you're buying time, Ron.

1056
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,899
I'm not buying time.

1057
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,570
Ron! Just do what men have been
doing for thousands of years,

1058
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,238
and punch the woman.

1059
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,614
- Punch her!
- You're stalling.

1060
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,699
Punch the woman!

1061
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,770
Here comes the Toledo
Express. All aboard!

1062
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,892
Ron! No!

1063
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,520
I didn't do it!

1064
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,529
Mama, your baby's hurt.

1065
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,467
Your baby.

1066
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,638
What is that sound you're
making? Good Lord!

1067
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,539
You sound like a balloon.

1068
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,207
Pull yourself together, man.

1069
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,604
Security!

1070
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,522
They saw my pee-pee.

1071
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,467
The eighth grade
boys saw my pee-pee!

1072
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,611
Did you say they saw your pee-pee?

1073
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,181
In the locker room,
they saw my pee-pee.

1074
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,616
You just knocked him
back into fifth grade.

1075
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:00,889
Get him out of here!

1076
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,434
Bugger me with a didgeridoo.

1077
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:05,997
We knew we'd struggle to start,

1078
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:08,625
but these ratings are lower
than I'd even imagined.

1079
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,585
Thank God for the 2:00 a.m. spike.

1080
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:12,438
It really saved our whole launch.

1081
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,986
Spike? What are you talking about?

1082
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,400
What spike?

1083
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,635
Burgundy. Who's Ron Burgundy?

1084
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,830
No, no, no, this can't be right.

1085
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:26,768
His team start at a .2,
and then they finish at a 5.6?

1086
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:30,021
That's unbelievable!
They tripled Jack Lime's numbers!

1087
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:33,296
How is that even possible?
Who are these guys?

1088
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,261
They're a local team
out of San Diego.

1089
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,759
You little beauty!

1090
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,764
Well, they no longer work for us.

1091
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,142
I fired them.

1092
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:48,726
Well, guys, it goes without saying
I owe you gentlemen an apology.

1093
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:53,711
I dragged you out here and this thing
was a disaster from the word "go."

1094
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,381
No, Ron, don't you
beat yourself up.

1095
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,109
Yeah, it's all right, Ron.

1096
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,447
Gin.

1097
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,720
Brian, any idea what
you might do next?

1098
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,138
Gonna head back to L.A.

1099
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,848
I got a good group of
buddies out there.

1100
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,726
O.J. Simpson.
Phil Spector. Robert Blake.

1101
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,520
Sounds like a fun crew.

1102
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,271
We go out cruising chicks.

1103
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,023
Call ourselves the "Ladykillers."

1104
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,609
I love that name. You should get it
on the back of matching jackets.

1105
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,194
That's not a bad idea.

1106
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,471
Uh, guys?

1107
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:26,596
Hey.

1108
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,647
I got some news.

1109
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,559
Freddie, we don't exactly want to
hear the word "news" right now.

1110
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,875
Yeah.

1111
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,480
You're right. Forget it.
Forget I was even here.

1112
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,859
Forget that GNN wants you back.

1113
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:44,830
For a prime time slot
and a raise in pay.

1114
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:48,391
Quit yanking our penises, Freddie!
What's the deal?

1115
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,727
Yeah! Quit yanking our anuses.

1116
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,047
No. I'm not yanking your...

1117
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:57,442
Your ratings went through the roof.

1118
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,262
People love what you did.

1119
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,822
You're a success!

1120
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:07,679
Get it? You're a great,
big, fat success!

1121
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,647
By the bed pan of Gene Rayburn!

1122
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,124
It's total crap and they
can't stop watching!

1123
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,211
<i>The news team
had been famous in San Diego,</i>

1124
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:20,441
<i>but that was small time
compared to New York.</i>

1125
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,217
<i>This fame was a rocket ship.</i>

1126
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:27,764
<i>A rocket ship that had free drinks
and topless stewardesses.</i>

1127
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,807
That'll do it for all
of us here at GNN.

1128
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:33,478
Thank God for the events,
thank me for the news.

1129
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,001
I'm Jack...

1130
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,251
...Lame.

1131
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,239
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1132
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,657
More graphics, all right?

1133
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,326
But there's already a lot.

1134
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:50,661
Hey, you heard the man.
More graphics.

1135
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,331
Let a citizen ask a question here,
for God's sake!

1136
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,834
Can Father Ron please shut
his mouth for half a second?

1137
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:00,963
This is against everything

1138
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,216
that I have worked
for my entire life.

1139
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,614
Oh, honey, come on.

1140
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,160
If you're like me,
you need an underwear

1141
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,013
that fits your active lifestyle.

1142
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,832
<i>At finer specialty
and department stores.</i>

1143
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,668
<i>I'm weatherman Brick Tamland,
and I like butter.</i>

1144
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:42,899
<i>Butter is nutritious
and it tastes great.</i>

1145
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,071
Butter!

1146
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:49,387
There's something new on
the New York social scene.

1147
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:52,181
It's fun, relatively benign
and costs about as much

1148
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,517
as a soda pop at the
local drugstore.

1149
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,018
Here's Brian Fantana

1150
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,312
on why everyone who is someone

1151
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,523
is lighting up to smoke crack.

1152
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,984
Now, Brian, I understand
we have some crack

1153
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,777
and we're going to smoke it
right here in the studio.

1154
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,112
I don't know if we can
get a shot of that.

1155
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,072
What is that? Did you know
they were gonna have that?

1156
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,220
No.

1157
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:12,535
Now, what you're gonna do is, you're
gonna put your rock in the pipe.

1158
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,996
Is that where the phrase "Put it in
your pipe and smoke it" comes from?

1159
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,497
I don't care.

1160
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,771
- I love it when you do cooking segments.
- Mmm.

1161
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,129
Oh! Oh, whoa!

1162
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,547
You feel that right away.

1163
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,675
Wow, that's good. That's good.
That's an immediate state of euphoria.

1164
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:31,656
You'll be surprised.
The effect, it happens very... Ohh!

1165
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,681
It's just refreshing.

1166
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,850
They're actually enjoying it.

1167
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,999
Of course they're enjoying it.
It's crack.

1168
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,148
Well, now we know, guys,

1169
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,502
you can't smoke crack
on live television.

1170
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,204
Hey, gang.

1171
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,373
You know what would make
this great day even better?

1172
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,475
What?

1173
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,543
Perms for everyone!

1174
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:03,691
Yay!

1175
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,458
Please come in and shut the door.

1176
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,190
If this is about sweeps, um,

1177
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,109
I think Brian Fantana found
an outstanding story.

1178
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,403
It's about airplane parts

1179
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:34,575
that are falling off of airplanes out of
the sky and hitting the ground, people.

1180
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,661
We're calling it "Death From
Above." We might do some...

1181
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:38,355
You. Come here.

1182
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,252
I've been watching you.

1183
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,671
You have?

1184
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,359
I've been watching you a lot.

1185
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,260
And you just do whatever you want.

1186
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,013
Well, I'm a bit of a
maverick, I guess.

1187
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,848
You don't follow the format.

1188
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,327
You pretty much walk around like...

1189
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,541
Like you're king of the world.

1190
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,545
I'm just a worker bee.
That's all I am.

1191
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,001
- You know what?
- What?

1192
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,377
Oh!

1193
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,721
I find it hot as shit!

1194
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,867
Are you going to hurt me?

1195
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,411
Here's the thing, Mr. Burgundy.

1196
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:21,231
You're a shooting star and
I want to go for a ride.

1197
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,457
God, I'm so afraid right now.

1198
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,543
Now, I want to hear
you meow like a cat.

1199
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,799
Now, I want you to bark like a dog.

1200
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,343
Bark. Bark. Bark!

1201
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,970
Like a puppy. Like a puppy.

1202
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,935
Yeah. Come on! Do it!

1203
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,004
Mmm.

1204
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,585
Aw.

1205
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,232
Don't cry.

1206
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,444
It's sexual and yet frightening.

1207
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,218
It's an odd mixture.

1208
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,094
Come in.

1209
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:57,324
Uh, Linda.

1210
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,393
Excuse me, Linda.

1211
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,871
Ron, Jack wants to know

1212
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:05,332
if he can go back to calling himself
Jack Lime instead of Jack Lame.

1213
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,935
He's really struggling with it.

1214
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,609
No. Can't. It's a bet.

1215
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,338
Oh, Jesus!

1216
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,066
If you want to change it, you can.

1217
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:14,633
Like what?

1218
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,801
Art Areola.

1219
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,200
No! No, that's worse!
You know it's worse!

1220
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,890
How about this one?
You can call yourself Dick Fuck.

1221
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:23,059
Spell it P-H-U-C.

1222
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,128
You'll be huge in the
Vietnamese community.

1223
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,270
Freddie, I can't.

1224
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,250
Listen to me, Burgundy. This is
far from over, do you hear me?

1225
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,177
I'll see you on the playground.

1226
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,556
Well.

1227
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:43,871
This, uh, meeting has
been very productive.

1228
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:45,849
You can pick me up at 8:00.

1229
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:50,570
Okay, I'm very confused
by what's going on here.

1230
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,647
Get out!

1231
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:03,641
Oh, Ron.

1232
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:08,938
Ron, you are missing some real
high-quality Garfield laughs over here!

1233
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,815
I think our boss just raped me.

1234
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:11,982
What?

1235
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,692
I don't know what happened.

1236
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,486
All a bit of a blur.

1237
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:19,198
There was hands and hair,
and breath, and lips.

1238
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:20,908
There might have been
other people, I don't know.

1239
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:22,284
Sounds like she wants you.

1240
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,410
Hey, man.

1241
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,704
Women have been all over me
since we got crazy famous.

1242
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:29,435
Not to brag or anything, but I just
gave Florence Henderson crabs.

1243
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:32,946
That is in no way a brag, Brian.
That's horrible.

1244
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:36,382
Hey, it's just doing something
beautiful, that two people do.

1245
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,676
Except one of them has
microscopic dust mites

1246
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:41,053
- all over his penis and testicles.
- I'm just saying,

1247
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,056
the mom of <i>The Brady Bunch</i>
had a fun time with you,

1248
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,309
and then woke up the next day
and realized she had crabs.

1249
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,163
I gave her a whole
Brady Bunch of crabs.

1250
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,564
Sounds to me like it's her fault

1251
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,232
for being a randy gal.

1252
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:54,650
I have a date!

1253
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,068
Brick has a date?

1254
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,194
Good for Brick!

1255
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,445
What's a date?

1256
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,948
A date is simply when two
people get together,

1257
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,533
do something social,
have a few drinks,

1258
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:03,742
yadda-yadda-yadda...

1259
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:04,994
Take their shirts off...

1260
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,414
- Oh, it's okay.
- No, it's a fun thing.

1261
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:09,874
It's fun. It's all right.

1262
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:12,854
Look. Don't worry, Brick,
we got your back, okay?

1263
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,774
First things first, we need to
get you a little protection.

1264
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,242
Oh!

1265
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,949
There it is.

1266
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:25,097
Brian Fantana's glorious
cabinet of condoms.

1267
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:28,893
Oh, Brian, I know. How
about The Hooded Guest?

1268
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,871
I like the cut of your jib.

1269
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,564
That one is ultra-ribbed.

1270
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:36,734
It's like you're wearing an
armadillo shell on your privates.

1271
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,277
It takes two hours to get on.

1272
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,946
It's hooded. She'll
never see you coming.

1273
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,139
Oh, oh. Wait, wait, wait.

1274
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:43,554
You thinking what I'm thinking?

1275
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,222
"Lou Dobin's Good
Time Weiner Pouch."

1276
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:46,553
That's a good one.

1277
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:50,140
Dobin. Just a drifter who loves
to watch people have sex.

1278
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:51,749
They're made of denim,

1279
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,477
so they look better
after each washing.

1280
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:55,195
Talk about a great ride.

1281
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,570
I think I have it.

1282
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,380
Po' Boy Condom.

1283
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,924
It's a terrific condom.

1284
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:03,093
Although it does burn a bit because
it's covered in Cajun spices.

1285
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,721
It'll put a blister
on your po' boy.

1286
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,098
Brian, what's the nickname for your
penis whenever you wear a Po' Boy?

1287
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,475
Fat Tuesday.

1288
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,250
Wait a minute. I've got it.

1289
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,980
- "The Rigid Ghost."
Mmm.

1290
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,524
Ah, it's the best damn
rubber on the market.

1291
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:21,425
Hah, I got four of my seven illegitimate
children using this condom.

1292
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:24,448
Uh, but, Brian, isn't that the
whole point of wearing a condom?

1293
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,392
To not impregnate the woman?

1294
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:29,437
Well, you know the old expression.
"Nope."

1295
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:36,669
Thank you, Ron,
and happy St. Patrick's Day

1296
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,213
to all of our Native
American friends.

1297
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:40,611
On the big map...

1298
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:43,656
Where's my map?

1299
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,154
There's no map, it's just green.

1300
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,491
No, there's a map there.
Look at the monitor.

1301
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,933
Right. Oh.

1302
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,476
Ron, where's my legs?

1303
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,311
- Where are my legs?
- Your legs are there.

1304
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,959
I don't have any legs, Ron.

1305
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,462
I don't even know how
I'm standing up.

1306
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,027
Brick, your legs are fine.

1307
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,472
The color of your
pants just matches...

1308
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:06,471
Ron, I don't have any legs!

1309
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,638
The Chroma-Key behind you.

1310
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,618
Ninety-three?

1311
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,204
Ninety-three?

1312
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,477
Relax.

1313
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,504
And after I received my Masters
in Journalism from Columbia,

1314
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:24,216
I got a job with the London
bureau for ABC News.

1315
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,443
Wow, London.

1316
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:30,324
You're so impressive, and I've only
been out of the United States twice.

1317
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,224
A handful of times in Mexico,

1318
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:36,626
and then the second time I left the
country, we went to Salem, Oregon.

1319
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,548
Mr. Burgundy, are you nervous?

1320
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,749
God, yes.

1321
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:42,093
Did I scare you by
coming on so strong?

1322
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,636
A little bit, sure.

1323
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:46,238
- Look, it's not that you're not attractive...
- Mmm-hmm?

1324
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,341
It's just I'm a
little old-fashioned.

1325
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,386
- Well, I am a modern woman.
- Mmm.

1326
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:55,857
And let me tell you, when I see
something that I want, I go for it.

1327
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:57,791
Can I ask you a question?

1328
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,893
Mmm-hmm.

1329
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,487
Is that your foot between my legs?

1330
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,693
No.

1331
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,779
Oh. I'm sorry.

1332
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,118
It was my hand.

1333
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,236
So...

1334
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:09,706
We're going to do this, aren't we?

1335
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:13,499
We most definitely
are gonna do this.

1336
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:17,061
I feel a little awkward,
because I'm...

1337
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,229
I'm about to have
sex with a black lady!

1338
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,207
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

1339
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:22,608
- Mmm.
- That's not the way

1340
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,382
I like to handle my business.

1341
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:28,799
When I get nervous, I sometimes lose
control of the volume of my voice.

1342
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:32,678
Well, I don't mind, because
I am going to have you tonight.

1343
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:36,310
Then let's leave and go
have interracial sex!

1344
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,393
Sorry.

1345
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,689
This is the nicest soda machine
anyone's ever taken me to.

1346
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:26,364
The beauty of this soda machine
pales in comparison to your beauty.

1347
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:34,698
Can I ask you a personal question?

1348
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:36,700
I'm not sure what that is, but yes.

1349
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:38,626
Have you ever kissed anyone?

1350
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:42,589
Do faces on the TV screen and <i>Planet
of the Apes</i> action figures count?

1351
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,461
Of course.

1352
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,108
Then, yes.

1353
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:48,928
I have kissed Angie
Dickinson and Dr. Zaius.

1354
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:52,257
I've only kissed
people in my dreams.

1355
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:57,604
So, I've only kissed a tiny dragon
and a woman with her hair on fire.

1356
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:02,560
I don't have a lot of experience with
kissing, but I do know one thing...

1357
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,527
Always get your teeth involved.

1358
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:08,357
I think I'm ready to maybe
try that kiss thing now.

1359
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:46,982
Hello, Ms. Jackson.

1360
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,030
I didn't mean to scare you.

1361
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,821
Mr. Allenby, I wasn't
expecting you to...

1362
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,361
Yeah, no, I know. Neither was I.

1363
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,929
But then I heard about
this little story

1364
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,954
that Ron Burgundy and Brian
Fantana are running.

1365
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,267
You see, some of the
planes from my airline

1366
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,336
have had parts falling
off them lately.

1367
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,522
Is it a problem? Yeah.

1368
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:09,593
Is it being fixed?
I don't know, probably.

1369
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:13,346
But if that story runs,
then Koala stock will plummet.

1370
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,724
We can't just pull the story.
That would be unethical.

1371
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:20,137
We own the news.
We can do whatever we want.

1372
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:22,347
That's one of the perks.

1373
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:26,355
It's called "synergy." One
company working with another.

1374
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,364
To synergy.

1375
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:42,083
You seem a little
quiet, I must say.

1376
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:46,213
Just so you know, I'm absolutely fine
with going to this family dinner.

1377
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,586
They're going to love you.

1378
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,755
Mmm. This is delicious!

1379
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:54,712
So...

1380
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,973
How long have you and
Linda been dating?

1381
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,323
Mother.

1382
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,491
Oh.

1383
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,743
No, it's all right. It's
a logical question.

1384
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,845
Urn...

1385
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:07,689
Ours is a new love,
but it burns very brightly.

1386
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:12,546
And it gets hot and
sweaty and stanky.

1387
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:15,116
There's some stank on that love.

1388
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:16,784
What... What are
you talking about?

1389
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,636
Let's put it this way,
I be busting nuts like a squirrel.

1390
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:22,389
Oh, now, we don't have conversations
like that over dinner.

1391
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:23,473
What are you doing?

1392
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,435
I'm addressing the white
elephant in the room.

1393
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:29,605
I'm breaking down the barriers
of race by assimilation.

1394
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:32,046
- That's all I'm doing.
- Well, you're coming off like a jerk.

1395
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,775
I think it's going well.

1396
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,485
If you haven't noticed,

1397
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:36,945
we don't converse like that.

1398
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,923
Okay, okay.

1399
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:40,975
Look at big papa down here.

1400
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,368
He's saying to himself,
"Shit! Look at this honky.

1401
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:47,664
"Sittin' at my table, eatin' my food.
In my house? Touching my daughter?"

1402
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:48,707
I have.

1403
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,417
- I have touched your daughter.
- Honey!

1404
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:52,210
We have done things, Papa.

1405
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:55,047
You ain't gonna like.
You ain't gonna like it none!

1406
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,673
Oh, my goodness!

1407
01:08:56,674 --> 01:09:01,053
I mean, I'm just a guy
from Terre Haute, Indiana

1408
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:06,475
with a big ol' dick and a fat wallet
and a spleef the size of a baby arm.

1409
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,560
Just looking for someone
who wants to smoke it.

1410
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,395
Let's get some smoke going
in this place, right?

1411
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,840
This ain't no <i>Super Fly.</i>
What is your problem, man?

1412
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:18,570
Linda, I don't understand
what you are doing with him.

1413
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,572
Oh, you know what
I'm comin' at you with,

1414
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:23,847
you big black mother of Linda.
Mix it up in a pot!

1415
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,411
- Makin' it spicy!
- Oh, my Lord.

1416
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:29,081
- Hey.
- In the back, cooking up chitlins.

1417
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:31,583
Big ol' titties. Big ol' titties.

1418
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,251
Excuse me?

1419
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,920
- That's my mama, man.
- Hey.

1420
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,963
Wave your hands in the air.

1421
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:39,257
Wave your hands in the air
like you just don't care.

1422
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,826
Please, don't do this.

1423
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,303
Now, which one of you
pipe-hittin' bitches

1424
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,264
can pass me the mashed potatoes?

1425
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,641
I don't think that dinner
could've gone any better.

1426
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:48,868
Are you nuts?

1427
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,751
No, I'm not! I had a
wonderful evening!

1428
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,211
My dad was kicking you in the head!

1429
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:57,275
I thought it was like
being jumped into a gang.

1430
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,753
Only with dinner guests!

1431
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:01,264
You called my family
"pipe-hittin' bitches"!

1432
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:05,765
I hate to pin it on you, but
you did invite me to dinner.

1433
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:07,595
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1434
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,431
- No, I'm sorry.
- I just...

1435
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:13,333
I'm just under a lot of
stress because Allenby,

1436
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:16,563
he doesn't want you to do the story
that you're doing for sweeps.

1437
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,171
"Death From Above."

1438
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:19,840
It's an excellent story.
Wonderful expose.

1439
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,568
Listen, Ron.

1440
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,612
Have you ever heard of synergy?

1441
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:33,019
So your morn thought
we should get together,

1442
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,838
spend a little time.

1443
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:39,378
She doesn't think I connect
with you as a child.

1444
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,972
Can you believe that bullshit?

1445
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,575
Oh! This is hard.

1446
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:49,850
Things you say to a 6-year-old...

1447
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,790
Oh! Guess what?
I slept with a black woman.

1448
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,792
- What?
- Nothing.

1449
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,253
Dad, do you like Spider-Man?

1450
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:01,965
Nope. Don't care for him.
Never have.

1451
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:05,927
Don't like the mask, the costume,
the get-up, the webs. Uh-uh.

1452
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:09,139
He comes off like a real dickhead.
Real poser.

1453
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,682
What's a poser?

1454
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:15,645
A poser is Gary.
That's what a poser is.

1455
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:17,606
By the way, how is that shitheel?

1456
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:18,799
What's a shitheel?

1457
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,735
A shitheel is a real fun term

1458
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:24,029
that you should call Gary
every time you see him.

1459
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:28,033
When he wakes you up for breakfast,
say, "Good morning, shitheel."

1460
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,494
He'll probably give
you $5 or some candy.

1461
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:32,621
- Does that sound good?
- Yeah.

1462
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,873
You're a shitheel, Dad.

1463
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:35,957
Good.

1464
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:39,586
You should just call Gary that.
'Cause it makes him really happy.

1465
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:42,657
It makes me sort of happy,
but it makes him really happy.

1466
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:44,992
- Dad.
- Huh?

1467
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:47,052
Sometimes I hear sounds at night

1468
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,595
and I get scared.

1469
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:51,473
I think there's a
ghost in my closet.

1470
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,225
Now, you listen to me, son.

1471
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:57,331
There is no such thing as ghosts.
Case closed.

1472
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:59,314
So what's real that's scary?

1473
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,510
You really want to know the one
thing you should be afraid of?

1474
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,379
Yes, I really do.

1475
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:05,904
Voodoo.

1476
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,114
- Voodoo?
- Yes, voodoo.

1477
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,138
That shit will mess you up.

1478
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:13,058
And it is 100% real.

1479
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:16,395
Promise me that you'll
never go to Haiti.

1480
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,234
I promise, Dad.

1481
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,565
This was good. I enjoyed
spending time with you.

1482
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:21,729
Me, too, Dad.

1483
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,236
And hey. Do you want to
go to Haiti sometime?

1484
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:26,275
- No.
- Good. Good.

1485
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:28,361
What did you tell him

1486
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:30,033
I didn't tell him anything.

1487
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:32,365
He hasn't slept for four days, Ron!

1488
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:35,517
Everywhere we go, he asks
me if we're going to Haiti!

1489
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:36,744
What does that even mean?

1490
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:41,792
I am so sick and tired that you've
sheltered him from the evils of voodoo.

1491
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:44,734
You need to learn to connect
with him in a healthy way!

1492
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:46,945
Let me ask you something, and I'm
not trying to be funny here.

1493
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,595
Are you sure he's not a midget
with a learning disability?

1494
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,889
He is seven years old, Ron.

1495
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,596
- All right.
<i>- Now listen to me.</i>

1496
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:59,734
He has a science fair tomorrow, at
8:00, and he wants you to be there.

1497
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,444
I will be there. All right?

1498
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,943
Now, who do you have
for sweeps week?

1499
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:06,339
I'm not discussing work
with you, Ron, okay?

1500
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:09,050
Just be there at the
science fair tomorrow.

1501
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,152
Fine!

1502
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,179
<i>Well, they're calling it the
interview of the decade.</i>

1503
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:15,749
<i>Veronica Corningstone will
sit down with Yasser Arafat.</i>

1504
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,142
Yasser who?

1505
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,792
<i>The head of the PLO and some say the
key to peace in the Middle East.</i>

1506
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:23,462
<i>Of course, Ms. Corningstone
is the ex-wife of Ron Burgundy,</i>

1507
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,253
<i>so you know that's got to be
a little stinger for Ronny.</i>

1508
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,303
Tony Danza's scrotum!

1509
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,822
<i>Well, that'll do it for
all of us here at GNN.</i>

1510
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:34,159
<i>Thank God for the events,
thank me for the news.</i>

1511
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,762
<i>I'm Dick Phuk.</i>

1512
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:42,727
We're going to get crushed
in ratings. Just crushed.

1513
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:45,355
I really thought we had
a chance this time.

1514
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:47,986
What about my "Death
From Above" story?

1515
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,907
You better ask Ron about that.

1516
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,284
We're pulling that story, Brian.

1517
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:57,223
What? Why?
I worked hard on that story.

1518
01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:00,727
It was my call, all right, Brian?
Just let it go. It's synergy.

1519
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:01,895
What does that mean?

1520
01:14:01,896 --> 01:14:03,563
Take it easy, Ron.

1521
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,231
We got further than
anybody thought we would.

1522
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:06,316
We'll get 'em next time.

1523
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:09,512
You take it easy!
I'm not in this to finish second!

1524
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:11,196
I think Champ is just saying...

1525
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:14,574
I know what he was trying
to say, Brian, okay?

1526
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:17,410
And it doesn't surprise me
that you guys don't care.

1527
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:20,139
Let's face it, I'm the
one who gets the ratings.

1528
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:23,275
I'm starting to wonder what
you clowns actually do.

1529
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:26,988
Chani likes clowns.
Except for the scary ones.

1530
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,196
Shut up, Brick!

1531
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,691
Just shut up for once!

1532
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:34,594
Ron yelled at me.

1533
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:35,992
You're damn right I yelled at you!

1534
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,748
You don't yell at Brick.

1535
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:43,663
Are you still smoking crack?

1536
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,423
No.

1537
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:48,008
I only smoked crack that one time.

1538
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:52,380
That's a lie. I've done
it six more times.

1539
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:53,863
You made Brick cry.

1540
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:57,768
You've gone ratings crazy, Ron.

1541
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:02,580
But seriously, do you have
any more of that crack left?

1542
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:03,853
You know what, Ron?

1543
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,728
We're a news team,
and that's a bond for life.

1544
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,628
But I don't like the
man you've become.

1545
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,505
You know, we were happy
when you found us.

1546
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:11,756
Right?

1547
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,466
I was taking pictures of pussies,

1548
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:16,428
Champ was serving bats to people,
and Brick was dead.

1549
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:19,389
We took a gamble. Took a
gamble to follow you here.

1550
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,433
But I'm starting to realize,
this was all about you,

1551
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,309
and beating Veronica at all costs.

1552
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,311
Had nothing to do with the news,
nothing to do with the team.

1553
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:26,396
Brian, don't.

1554
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:27,981
You know, I might not
be the smartest guy,

1555
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:30,483
but I know a thing or two
about a thing or two.

1556
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,777
I know that if you're pleasuring
a woman down south,

1557
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,738
you use your tongue to
spell out the alphabet.

1558
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:37,991
Around the bubble.
Around her bubble.

1559
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,869
- The vulva!
- The Volvo.

1560
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,414
I know that "synergy" is a
completely made-up word.

1561
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:47,584
I know that washing your
hands is for nerds.

1562
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,627
Especially if you
don't mind pinkeye.

1563
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:55,201
And I know that, no matter what,
you always stand by your friends.

1564
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,907
You'll have to excuse me, Brian.

1565
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:00,247
I've got a sore back

1566
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:04,244
from carrying your ass around
for the last 15 years.

1567
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,538
You know what, Burgundy?

1568
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:09,939
I think your mouth is writing
checks that your body isn't...

1569
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:12,213
Can't even... Do anything with.

1570
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:21,390
Fine, go! I don't need you!

1571
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,230
I'll do the news by myself!

1572
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,878
<i>Tonight I interview
Yasser Arafat...</i>

1573
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:34,040
<i>- This is terrible.
- ...the secretive head of the PLO.</i>

1574
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,784
- We're on in 20, Ron, 20.
- All right.

1575
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,527
You ready?

1576
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,658
What's that?

1577
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,097
Oh, that's nothing.

1578
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:45,668
It's just a car chase on the
satellite feed from Milwaukee.

1579
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,212
You know what?

1580
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,022
Give it to me live to
start the broadcast.

1581
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:53,626
No. That's not news, Ron.

1582
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:55,693
Give it to me live, okay?

1583
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,320
And don't question me again.

1584
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:58,363
Bill!

1585
01:16:58,364 --> 01:16:59,531
<i>Now to you,</i>

1586
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:00,824
<i>- the modern viewer...
- Here we go.</i>

1587
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:03,451
<i>...reporting on a car chase
may seem commonplace...</i>

1588
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,913
<i>- Three, two...
- ...but in 1980, it was unheard of.</i>

1589
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:11,042
Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy,
reporting live from New York.

1590
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:14,671
We have breaking news developing
in our nation's heartland.

1591
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:18,383
A high-speed car chase
is in progress...

1592
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:21,052
Keep the "Breaking News" logo.
Keep up the graphics.

1593
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:22,137
Reaching speeds of
100 miles per hour.

1594
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:26,057
And for the first time in news
history, we will stay with it live

1595
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:29,727
<i>until it resolves in either a huge
accident or a massive shootout.</i>

1596
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:30,812
Richard!

1597
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:33,917
Hurry. Get in here!
There's a car chase on the news!

1598
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:37,068
When is Dad gonna be here?

1599
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:38,421
He'll be here.

1600
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:39,988
Are you a little upset?

1601
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:45,311
Do you want to do that thing where
we sort of talk about our feelings?

1602
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:47,471
- Oh, God, no.
- Okay.

1603
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:51,518
This is the pulse of what's
going on in our country right now.

1604
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,042
Freddie, what's going on?

1605
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:55,170
Why is there a local
car chase on the TV?

1606
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,818
It's Burgundy. He insisted!

1607
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:58,715
Can't you see what the
son of a bitch is doing?

1608
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:00,425
We didn't have a story,
so he made one.

1609
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:01,994
You can't do that!

1610
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,137
Tell Ron to speculate
who's driving the car.

1611
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:07,162
Ron, speculate on who's
driving the car.

1612
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:11,269
Uh, we believe the
driver may be on drugs.

1613
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,897
<i>He's probably 6'7 ", 6'8".</i>

1614
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:16,501
But a skinny 6'7 ", 6'8".
About 160.

1615
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,902
He may have a hostage or two.

1616
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:21,051
Uh, we don't know. He could have...

1617
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:23,990
The phone lines are lighting up.
It's about the chase!

1618
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:25,513
I've never seen anything like it!

1619
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,953
Mr. Arafat, is there any scenario

1620
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,456
by which peace could be
reached with Israel?

1621
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,857
Peace is what burns
in my heart. I am committed to...

1622
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:34,977
What was... Excuse me.

1623
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,191
What happened to the...

1624
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,130
The network cut to another
developing story.

1625
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,132
Some kind of crazy car chase.

1626
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,235
Who covers a car chase?

1627
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:47,699
I am sitting here with the most important
interview of my entire career,

1628
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:49,617
and they're cutting to a car chase?

1629
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:51,351
I would like to watch
the car chase.

1630
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:52,685
You need to shut your mouth.

1631
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,062
<i>This is extremely gripping.</i>

1632
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:56,814
<i>Oh! Oh! He just hit a car!
He just hit a car!</i>

1633
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,107
He hit a car! Did you see that?

1634
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,209
- He hit a car!
<i>- Wow!</i>

1635
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:01,819
- He hit the car!
- He hit the car!

1636
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,673
When did the news get awesome?

1637
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,783
<i>And he just loses it! Wow!</i>

1638
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:09,854
That's exactly what we needed.
It was getting a little boring...

1639
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:15,693
Hey. You did a great job.

1640
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,686
Thanks, Gary.

1641
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,295
I don't think your dad's coming.

1642
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:21,319
I'm sorry, honey,
but I think we need to go.

1643
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,028
Stop reading my mind!

1644
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:26,911
All right.

1645
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:33,077
I mean, this is what I worry about.

1646
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:36,938
Did you do that with your mind?

1647
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:38,064
No.

1648
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:39,337
Liar.

1649
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,550
We're just getting word that police
have finally apprehended the suspect.

1650
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:48,722
It turns out that he is an elderly
gentleman, he's 80 years old,

1651
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,765
- and he was simply confused.
- Unbelievable.

1652
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:52,225
I'm Ron Burgundy.

1653
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:56,817
Don't just have a great night,
have an American night.

1654
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,400
And we are clear!

1655
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:01,688
Yes!

1656
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,232
Great!

1657
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:04,483
All right!

1658
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,743
I don't believe it!
You did it, Ron!

1659
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,113
Oh, my goodness. Thanks, Freddie.

1660
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:11,832
I don't deserve this.

1661
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,038
It was a team effort.
It really was.

1662
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,503
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

Yeah, Ron! Yeah!

1668
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,449
Fire it up, Ronny!

1669
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:14,577
Let's blaze.

1670
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:17,352
Yeah. To hell with Ron Burgundy.

1671
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,642
We did it, my onyx hellion.

1672
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:24,146
You're magic.

1673
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:28,826
Ron, you should see
what you're doing!

Oh, my God, Ronny!

01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,486
Ron!

1681
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:13,737
Open the bloody gate.

1682
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:14,804
Will somebody call an ambulance?

1683
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:17,158
Do not die in front of us!

1684
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,540
Do not die in front of us!

1685
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:24,105
Stay classy, Ron Burgundy.

1686
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,049
Somebody call an ambulance!

1687
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,370
Damn it, Milton, what is it?

1688
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:40,955
Well, Ron...

1689
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,729
I, um...

1690
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:45,460
it looks as if both optic nerves

1691
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:48,280
are separated from their
respective corneas.

1692
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,908
- What?
- No other way to put this, but...

1693
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,383
You're blind.

1694
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:54,802
Milton, I'm an anchorman.

1695
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:58,578
I read the news off the
teleprompter. It's what I do!

1696
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,375
How will I live?

1697
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:03,245
I'm no career counselor, but there
are many things you can do.

1698
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,627
Be an oracle, or a mystic.

1699
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:07,356
Clearly, there must be something

1700
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:10,651
in this new-fangled office
of yours that can help me!

1701
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,528
- Settle down.
- There's got to be something in here!

1702
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:14,322
Settle down!

1703
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,300
Zombies! Zombies!

1704
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,642
Ahh!

1705
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:21,430

01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:03,184
I hope you like Triscuits
and some pimento loaf.

1717
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:05,566
Still hot off the griddle!

1718
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,063
There we go.

1719
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,854
Well, everyone at the station
really misses you, Ron.

1720
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:13,281
Jack Lime's been filling in for
you since you've been gone.

1721
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,841
You know, he's really not
such a bad guy after all.

1722
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:17,159
Ha-ha.

1723
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,053
He goes by Jack Lamé now.

1724
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,013
Well, he shouldn't be doing that.

1725
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:22,741
He should be going by Jack Lame.

1726
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,183
Brick!

1727
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:25,331
Brick.

1728
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:27,713
That's checkers and caulk.
Don't eat that.

1729
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:30,565
What about Linda?
She hasn't called.

1730
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:31,963
Linda's pretty busy.

1731
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:34,674
Ron, I'm going to need your recipe.

1732
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,445
So, Ron, what do you do
with yourself all day?

1733
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:38,322
You're just out here pretty
much away from everything.

1734
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:40,551
Well, every day begins
about the same.

1735
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,077
I wake up screaming in terror

1736
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,079
because of the blackness
and I think I'm dead.

1737
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,227
Every day?

1738
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:48,021
Yes! Every day!

1739
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:51,315
And then I begin what's
called The Great Adventure.

1740
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:53,151
Making breakfast.

1741
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,949
I've eaten everything from
nails to drink coasters.

1742
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:58,634
One time I bit hard
into a marble ashtray,

1743
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,612
thinking it was a savory waffle.

1744
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:05,224
I wanted that waffle so bad!
Completely shattered my teeth.

1745
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:07,685
Couldn't you tell the ashtray
wasn't hot like a waffle?

1746
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:10,209
No! I couldn't! Because I'm blind!

1747
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:14,275
<i>I'm not blind 23 hours
a day or 22 hours a day,</i>

1748
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:17,320
I'm blind the whole goddamn time!

1749
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:20,615
Do you have any idea what it's like
to drink a half a bottle of ketchup

1750
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:24,516
thinking it was a bottle of
1946 Chateauneuf-du-Pape?

1751
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,306
I even decanted it!

1752
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:30,708
If you drank half a bottle
of that, that's like...

1753
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:32,543
That's like nine or ten gulps.

1754
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,211
I mean, you couldn't tell
that was ketchup?

1755
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:35,671
Did I stutter?

1756
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:38,758
I'm ba-lind!

1757
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,611
You're having a tough
time, Ron, I know.

1758
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:42,620
You know what the
biggest indignity is?

1759
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,805
I can't even masturbate!

1760
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:45,890
Why?

1761
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:47,975
Heck, one morning,
I spent 20 minutes

1762
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:52,813
aggressively rubbing my shin,
wondering, "Where's the sensation?

1763
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:53,939
"Where's the pleasure coming?"

1764
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,400
You rubbed your shin
thinking it was a penis?

1765
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:57,962
I know you think I'm
stupid, don't you?

1766
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:01,030
The weirdo who lives
in the weird lighthouse

1767
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:02,365
in the middle of nowhere.

1768
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:04,784
Ron, it was your choice to
live in a "weird lighthouse."

1769
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,182
You know why I live here?

1770
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:10,316
Let me say it real
slow and real loud.

1771
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,875
I'm

1772
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:15,650
blind!

1773
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:18,172
I guess we should get out of here.

1774
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:19,695
Maybe you should go. Yes.

1775
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,735
Why don't you guys get out of here!

1776
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:24,720
Despite my complete
and utter isolation,

1777
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:27,950
your gentlemen's visit has
actually made it worse!

1778
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,046
Goodbye, Ron.

1779
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,295
What?

1780
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:42,354
No, don't go!

1781
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:46,886
Please! Wait! I'm all alone!
Come back!

1782
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:54,397
Wait! Come back!

1783
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,028
Come back!

1784
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:01,820
I'm alone!

1785
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:06,492
Why have you done this
to me, God? Why?

1786
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:10,960
Couldn't you have cured a sick
child or created a new animal?

1787
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:14,979
But, no, you had to make
Ron Burgundy blind!

1788
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:17,690
Well, I never thought
that I would see

1789
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:21,277
the Ron Burgundy full
of so much self-pity.

1790
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:24,177
Who is it? What is that noise?

1791
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:25,507
Take my hand.

1792
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:27,533
I can't see it!

1793
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:28,851
Reach for it, Ron!

1794
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,597
You have to learn to
do for yourself now.

1795
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:34,290
All right. This... Okay.
Here we go.

1796
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:35,688
Get up. There we go.

1797
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:39,772
Cher, is that you?

1798
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:41,648
You can't recognize me by my voice?

1799
01:27:42,132 --> 01:27:43,779
Jan-Michael Vincent?

1800
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,193
Really?

1801
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:48,095
Every news station is
copying what you did, Ron.

1802
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:53,418
All the stories are about animals,
or car chases or strip clubs.

1803
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:56,080
The genie has been let
out of the bottle,

1804
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,833
and old Ron Burgundy
popped the cork.

1805
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:01,506
- That's why I quit <i>WBC News.</i>
- What?

1806
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:03,861
There's no real news
being reported out there.

1807
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:05,305
It's just all about ratings.

1808
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:06,932
Veronica.

1809
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:08,762
Why are you here?

1810
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:10,602
I'm here for our son, Ron.

1811
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:12,328
Walter needs you.

1812
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:16,290
I need you to start taking
responsibility for him and for yourself.

1813
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,250
Do you realize you're
talking to a man

1814
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:22,197
who just this morning tried to brush
his teeth with a live lobster?

1815
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:23,569
What?

1816
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,592
You would've known the second
that you touched it...

1817
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:29,663
I'm just saying it's not
going to be a cakewalk.

1818
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:32,415
Well, then we best get to it.

1819
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:34,121
Now, drink your tea.

1820
01:28:34,601 --> 01:28:36,544
Oh!

1821
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:39,814
Let me get a sponge. I'll get it.

1822
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,982
All right. No, no, just stay there.

1823
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,131
I'll have it cleaned up in a jiffy.

1824
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:55,955
Let's try this again.

1825
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:57,603
- Did you throw it?
- Yes, I threw it.

1826
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,518
Just remember the curves.

1827
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:00,751
The curves.

1828
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:02,900
- The green eyes.
- Green eyes.

1829
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,027
You have to use your
other senses now!

1830
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:07,030
I can't do it!

1831
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:11,368
Baxter found something
on the beach!

1832
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:13,164
Ron, be careful!

1833
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,204
It's okay!

1834
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:19,463
- Walter, what is it?
- It's some kind of fish!

1835
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,897
Oh, my goodness!

1836
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:23,858
If he stays tangled in this net,

1837
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,506
he's not going to survive.

1838
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:27,550
Walter, sweetheart, it's a shark.

1839
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:28,843
Son.

1840
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:32,055
Don't you worry,
we won't let this fellow die.

1841
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:34,227
We'll do it together, Dad.

1842
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:41,166
That should keep him in
there until he's strong enough

1843
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:42,894
to swim out to the deep ocean.

1844
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:44,295
Can I name him?

1845
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:46,114
Of course you can, son.

1846
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:49,300
What about Crackers?

1847
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:51,635
Give me a goddamned break.

1848
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:55,264
Seriously, you've got one of the
most vicious predators in the ocean,

1849
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:56,849
you're gonna name him "Crackers"?

1850
01:29:56,850 --> 01:30:02,146
In the future when you say I can name
something, don't be a dick about it.

1851
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:04,982
Why don't we do this?
Let's name him Doby.

1852
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:09,194
You talk all that smack and that's
the best name you come up with?

1853
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:11,322
Well, we're not gonna get
any better than that.

1854
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:15,743
I mean, you obviously can't name
him anything that sounds good.

1855
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:20,539
How about we forget about this whole
name thing and you go straight to hell?

1856
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,291
Well, I don't know what to do.

1857
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:25,836
We might as well poison the
water and let him die.

1858
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:28,505
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's just go with Doby.

1859
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:31,091
Fine, then it's settled. It's Doby.

1860
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:35,179
We'll call him Doby even
though no one likes it.

1861
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,248
All right, I can live with that.

1862
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,704
Don't worry, Baxter. We won't
feed him your dog food.

1863
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:50,804
<i>Even though Ron
Burgundy had lost his sight,</i>

1864
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,863
<i>he had never seen so clearly.</i>

1865
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,573
You did it!

1866
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:59,305
<i>And with every inch
Doby grew, so did Ron's heart.</i>

1867
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:12,659
It's just a bunch of
crazy lines, isn't it?

1868
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:15,871
No. It's beautiful.

1869
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:18,870
It's beautiful.

1870
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:35,114
What about Gary?

1871
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:36,888
We split up two weeks ago.

1872
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:40,016
He was too emotionally stable.
It was so annoying!

1873
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:43,686
<i>And so, just like
the passing of the seasons,</i>

1874
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,916
<i>it came time for Doby to return</i>

1875
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:48,361
<i>to the deep waters he
was meant to call home.</i>

1876
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:50,488
I hear his tail splashing!

1877
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,482
He's actually swimming away!

1878
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,818
Is he looking back for
us over his shoulder?

1879
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:56,677
Sharks don't have shoulders, Ron.

1880
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,178
No, he just swam away,

1881
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,702
and he's instantly
looking for fish to eat.

1882
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,497
He was my best friend.

1883
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:06,038
<i>You</i>

1884
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:08,548
<i>Swam with strength</i>

1885
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:11,801
<i>You</i>

1886
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:15,089
<i>Loved with grace</i>

1887
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:19,718
<i>You touched us all</i>

1888
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:23,055
<i>With your expressionless</i>

1889
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:25,307
<i>Face</i>

1890
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:29,687
<i>Doby, oh, Doby</i>

1891
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:33,656
<i>May you find many treasures</i>

1892
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:38,203
<i>Both emotional and monetary</i>

1893
01:32:39,596 --> 01:32:42,848
<i>You were wise and loving</i>

1894
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:46,169
<i>and never contrary</i>

1895
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:48,246
<i>Doby</i>

1896
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,924
<i>Oh, Doby</i>

1897
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,968
<i>I'll never forget thee</i>

1898
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,674
<i>Doby</i>

1899
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:02,473
<i>Oh, Doby</i>

1900
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:05,388
<i>I'll never forget thee</i>

1901
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:12,169
Promise you'll always
be there for me, Dad?

1902
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,647
I promise.

1903
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:15,798
If I say I'll be there for you,

1904
01:33:15,799 --> 01:33:18,368
there's nothing on God's
earth that will stop me.

1905
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:19,987
I love you, Dad.

1906
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:22,576
Let's get back up to the
lighthouse, all right?

1907
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:24,165
- Come on.
- Okay.

1908
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:25,954
Let's go.

1909
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:31,081
I hope you eat lots of fish
and people, Doby.

1910
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:37,861
Oh, there you are.

1911
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:41,323
I found the most beautiful
clams down by the estuary.

1912
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:43,450
I thought we could
steam them up tonight

1913
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,770
with a nice butter sauce

1914
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:47,855
and some wine.

1915
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:50,399
Veronica.

1916
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,227
Yes, Ron?

1917
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:54,316
Can you explain this?

1918
01:33:57,215 --> 01:34:00,509
<i>Ron, this is Dr. Brangley.
I've left dozens of messages.</i>

1919
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:02,344
<i>Somehow, they must
be getting erased.</i>

1920
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:06,621
<i>But there is a procedure that
can possibly return your sight.</i>

1921
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,619
<i>Please get back to me
if you're interested.</i>

1922
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:13,207
Well? Have you been
erasing these messages?

1923
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:16,066
Yes. Ron, just let me explain.

1924
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,234
How could you?

1925
01:34:17,235 --> 01:34:20,154
We've never been this happy,
and I just thought that...

1926
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:21,947
Thought that if I could see again,

1927
01:34:21,948 --> 01:34:24,301
that somehow I couldn't
love you and Walter anymore?

1928
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:25,951
Yes!

1929
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:30,102
- Damn you, woman!
- You lied to me!

1930
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:32,817
I gave you everything!

1931
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:36,150
I gave you my heart, my smile,

1932
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:38,440
my seed.

1933
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:40,359
And you lied to me.

1934
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:41,842
- Dad!
- Sweetheart.

1935
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:43,411
No! Dad!

1936
01:34:43,553 --> 01:34:45,405
Don't leave, Dad!

1937
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:47,366
- Dad!
- Walter, just...

1938
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:49,085
Sweetheart, we have to let him go.

1939
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:51,836
He needs to go free.

1940
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:54,297
Just like Doby.

1941
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:57,065
He'll be back. He promised.

1942
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:02,029
Could you please call me
a damn cab? I'm blind!

1943
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,131
Of course!

1944
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:06,931
<i>Ron, the operation was a success.</i>

1945
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:10,389
But we won't know for sure
until we remove the bandages.

1946
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:18,071
Well?

1947
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,526
Yes.

1948
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:21,236
I can see.

1949
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:29,036
Oh, God, oh, God.
It's Ron Burgundy, everyone!

1950
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:30,791
You are my inspiration.

1951
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:32,660
Oh, well, thank you.

1952
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:34,958
Welcome back, Ron.

1953
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:36,797
Thanks. Thanks, Bri-man.

1954
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:38,633
Good luck in Vietnam.

1955
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:40,718
Brick.

1956
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:42,110
Brick and I are having a baby!

1957
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:43,591
We're gonna name him
Tortilla Jackson.

1958
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,489
- All right.
- I'm 22 months pregnant.

1959
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:46,698
Well, get over here, you bastard.

1960
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:48,016
Got you a drink, Ron. Come on.

1961
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:52,768
Uh, hold on to that drink.
I just want to grab some air.

1962
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:06,236
How you doing there?

1963
01:36:07,136 --> 01:36:08,237
Oh.

1964
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:11,157
I'm fine. Just, uh...

1965
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:13,493
Just a lot of people in there.

1966
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:17,756
Listen, Ron, I'm sorry that
I never called or visited.

1967
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:19,753
There's no need to explain.

1968
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:21,441
But, listen, I mean, you're back.

1969
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:22,543
Hello, Ron.

1970
01:36:23,945 --> 01:36:25,217
What are you doing here?

1971
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:28,512
I had to come tell you
something very important.

1972
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,887
You must be Linda Jackson.

1973
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:33,537
You must be Veronica.

1974
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:35,106
Yes, I am. It's a pleasure.

1975
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:36,957
This is a touching moment for me.

1976
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:39,042
Please, don't take
this the wrong way,

1977
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,461
but if you touch Ron again,

1978
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:44,031
I will shoot you in the
cooch with a B.B. gun.

1979
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:46,466
Oh! You can talk big all you want,

1980
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:48,990
but guess what, this
kitten's got claws, bitch.

1981
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:50,846
Don't mess with me, Linda,

1982
01:36:50,847 --> 01:36:54,076
because this "White Thunder"
rolls deep and it rolls nasty.

1983
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:55,809
I was feeling a little bit down,

1984
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:58,038
but this is definitely
picking up my mood.

1985
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:00,272
Well, I guess I'll
leave you two alone.

1986
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:03,377
And it's been an absolute
pleasure, Ms. Corningstone.

1987
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:04,568
This has been great.

1988
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:06,445
Do you guys want to
kiss real quick?

1989
01:37:06,446 --> 01:37:08,423
Ron. Read the room.

1990
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:10,136
I'll take that as a no.

1991
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:12,594
Bye, Linda.

1992
01:37:13,036 --> 01:37:15,230
I know why you haven't been
returning my messages.

1993
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:19,499
I wasn't calling for me, I was calling
because Walter has a piano recital

1994
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,377
in half an hour at the Tishman
School on 65th Street.

1995
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:24,981
And he wrote a piece for you, Ron.

1996
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:26,965
Aw, Walter.

1997
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:29,968
It would mean the absolute
world to him to have you there.

1998
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:33,323
Ron, I just got a call
from the control room! Oh, big fan.

1999
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:37,559
Actress Sheila Blackledge,
the mom from the hit sitcom

2000
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,708
<i>Four's a Family, Five's a Crowd,</i>

2001
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:42,272
she just found out her
husband cheated on her

2002
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:45,217
and she severed his
penis while he slept!

2003
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:46,381
Oh, my goodness.

2004
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:50,113
The police arrived.
She fled in her white Bronco,

2005
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:53,742
and now they're engaged
in a high-speed car chase!

2006
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:55,952
We've got an exclusive
on the live feed,

2007
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:58,021
but we've got to go, right now!

2008
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:01,359
Ron, this can be your comeback.

2009
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:03,937
- Veronica, I...
- No, Ron. No.

2010
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:06,731
That will get sky-high ratings.

2011
01:38:07,215 --> 01:38:10,319
- Walter will understand.
- Walter will understand.

2012
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:11,952
Go.

2013
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:14,242
Come on, Ron. Priorities!

2014
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:16,248
- Veronica!
- Come on!

2015
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:20,102
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, yes.

2016
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:21,436
You're coming in loud and clear.

2017
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:22,979
You're back and you get this story.

2018
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,940
- This is gonna be huge.
- Right.

2019
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:26,775
So, is it good to be back home?

2020
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:28,235
Um, yeah, I feel good.

2021
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:29,694
<i>- God, look at him.</i>

2022
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:31,263
<i>Like a beacon in the night!</i>

2023
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:32,864
My golden goose.

2024
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:34,057
<i>All right, baby.</i>

2025
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:35,283
So I'm just gonna be
giving you the details.

2026
01:38:35,284 --> 01:38:37,244
Mmm-hmm.
- Five, four,

2027
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:38,597
three, two...

2028
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:41,206
Good evening, America.

2029
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:45,460
After some time off,
it's good to be back with you.

2030
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:47,129
I'm Ron Burgundy.

2031
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:50,549
We have a story tonight
involving an affair,

2032
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:55,095
a cut-off penis, a TV
star and a car chase.

2033
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:56,539
And throw it to the feed.

2034
01:38:58,599 --> 01:39:00,121
The only problem is...

2035
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:03,538
- What's he doing?
- Ron, are you okay?

2036
01:39:04,147 --> 01:39:05,647
- It's not news.
- What?

2037
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:06,965
Turn off the prompter.

2038
01:39:06,983 --> 01:39:08,066
<i>Ron, this is Kench.</i>

2039
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:09,484
<i>What the hell do you
think you're doing, mate?</i>

2040
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:13,260
Just read what's in front of you,
or I will ruin you! Don't!

2041
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:15,516
Don't! You leave Kench
inside your head!

2042
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:18,970
- God damn it!
- He took out his earpiece.

2043
01:39:18,995 --> 01:39:21,894
You see, folks, I've read
a lot of news in my day,

2044
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:26,566
but it's... It's taken me until now

2045
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:29,981
to realize what real news is.

2046
01:39:30,298 --> 01:39:32,776
Real news is supposed
to let people know

2047
01:39:32,884 --> 01:39:37,285
what the powerful are up to, so that
that power doesn't become corrupt.

2048
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:39,806
But what happens when the
powerful own the news?

2049
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:42,142
Ugh! You piece of shit!

2050
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:44,120
Shit. He's blowing
the whole thing up.

2051
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:47,294
Recently, I've been on a
bit of a personal journey.

2052
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:51,469
I made love to a proud,
intelligent black woman.

2053
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:54,551
I became blind.

2054
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:57,467
I bottle-fed and raised a shark.

2055
01:39:57,783 --> 01:40:00,511
And I smoked a fair
amount of crack.

2056
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:05,399
But the most important thing I've learned
is that there was an emptiness left

2057
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:09,730
after turning my back on three of the
best friends anyone could ever ask for.

2058
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:11,379
Hi, Ron!

2059
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:13,173
So, if you'll excuse me,

2060
01:40:13,174 --> 01:40:15,467
I'm going to see my child's recital

2061
01:40:15,468 --> 01:40:19,414
and tell the woman I love
that I still love her.

2062
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:23,497
Good night, America,
and never forget,

2063
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:25,996
you deserve the truth.

2064
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:31,608
Good. He's dead, done.

2065
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:33,902
Linda, get the skirt in,
the blonde. Anyone!

2066
01:40:33,903 --> 01:40:35,570
He's coming back!

2067
01:40:35,571 --> 01:40:37,364
Oh, also, one other thing.

2068
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:40,435
Koala Airlines is a
really shitty airline.

2069
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:43,725
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

2070
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:49,143
Guys, I'm sorry.

2071
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:52,689
For a while there, I don't know
what became of Ron Burgundy.

2072
01:40:52,922 --> 01:40:55,571
Brick, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

2073
01:40:56,342 --> 01:40:57,534
Brian, I...

2074
01:40:57,593 --> 01:41:00,011
No reason why I killed
that story of yours.

2075
01:41:00,012 --> 01:41:01,409
It was excellent reporting.

2076
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:05,100
And, Champ, I'm sorry
I said no to all those

2077
01:41:05,101 --> 01:41:09,047
offers for late-night
deep-tissue rubdowns.

2078
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:12,190
Ron, you're a good man.

2079
01:41:12,191 --> 01:41:15,636
But you have fallen victim to
your own ego and your own hubris.

2080
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:19,632
And before others can forgive you,
you must learn to forgive yourself.

2081
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,057
What was that, Brick?

2082
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:26,271
I'm wearing two pairs of pants.

2083
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:28,940
Thank you.

2084
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:30,875
So that's it, huh?

2085
01:41:30,876 --> 01:41:32,836
You're sorry?

2086
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:36,256
You know what, Burgundy?
Apologies are like assholes.

2087
01:41:36,257 --> 01:41:37,507
Everyone's got one

2088
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:40,657
and everyone's got a shoebox full
of Polaroids of them under the bed.

2089
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,305
Ron, we're a team.

2090
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:44,578
We need you.

2091
01:41:44,724 --> 01:41:46,292
Let him go, Champ.

2092
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:52,791
Ron!

2093
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:56,336
Long live Ron Burgundy!

2094
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:07,643
I'm Brick Tamland for <i>GNN News.</i>

2095
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:12,022
<i>The itsy bitsy spider
went up the water spout.</i>

2096
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:14,027
You little hack!

2097
01:42:14,295 --> 01:42:15,920
Huh? Who the hell do
you think you are?

2098
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:17,297
After everything I've done for you,

2099
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:19,758
this is how you repay me?
Well, I will crush you!

2100
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:24,137
Once again, Mr. Burgundy,

2101
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:26,890
you are the ballsiest white
man I've ever known.

2102
01:42:26,891 --> 01:42:28,584
What the hell?

2103
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:31,203
One more for old times' sake.

2104
01:42:37,735 --> 01:42:38,818
Thank you.

2105
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:40,904
Is Dad going to come?

2106
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:42,864
No, sweetheart, Daddy has to work.

2107
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:45,138
He's going to come. I know it.

2108
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:46,685
Taxi!

2109
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:49,329
Taxi! Taxi!

2110
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:50,522
Damn it!

2111
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:54,060
It's so hard for a proud Mexican
to get a taxi in this city!

2112
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:56,237
I need to see my son!

2113
01:42:56,545 --> 01:43:00,900
And now, to play an original composition
that he wrote for his father,

2114
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:03,869
here is seven-year-old
Walter Burgundy.

2115
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:15,039
I made a promise!
I made a promise to my son!

2116
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:19,756
What the hell?

2117
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:21,879
Well, hello, Ron.

2118
01:43:22,279 --> 01:43:23,551
You out for a jog?

2119
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:25,099
Jack Lime!

2120
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,552
Where's everyone going?

2121
01:43:27,576 --> 01:43:30,680
Please. I don't have time to talk, okay?
I have to be somewhere.

2122
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,932
Well, that's funny.
'Cause I got nowhere to be

2123
01:43:33,499 --> 01:43:35,772
because you pretty much
destroyed my career.

2124
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:40,068
Do you realize what it did to me,
by making me call myself Jack Lame?

2125
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:43,025
It was a living hell!

2126
01:43:45,636 --> 01:43:48,580
I'm telling you,
you have to let me go!

2127
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,741
Oh, don't worry. Four against one.

2128
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:52,872
This will be over fast.

2129
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:55,334
Maybe not so fast!

2130
01:43:58,733 --> 01:44:01,052
My news team. Thank God!

2131
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:07,426
Ain't a day that will be or has been
that we don't have Ron Burgundy's back.

2132
01:44:07,533 --> 01:44:09,576
Not a problem. When I'm
done with these mutts,

2133
01:44:09,577 --> 01:44:11,145
I'm gonna wipe my
shoes on the curb.

2134
01:44:11,162 --> 01:44:12,980
Oh, yeah, Jack Lime?

2135
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:14,831
When I'm done with you,

2136
01:44:14,832 --> 01:44:17,731
my mom's going to pick
me up and take me home.

2137
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,274
Wait!

2138
01:44:22,673 --> 01:44:24,549
Here's a headline for you.

2139
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:27,093
"Moronic Yank Wankerman

2142

No. Not now.

Fall back, fall back.

then Wesley Jackson and
the MTV News crew want in.

2147
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:51,469
What's MTV?

2148
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:53,641
I think it's a venereal disease.

2149

The most requested
video of the day?

2150

A new band called Burgundy's
Sucking Chest Wound.

2151
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:06,966
It wouldn't be a battle

Entertainment news

Who are you wearing today?
Oh, look, it's your own blood!

Today's celebrity birthdays...
None.

Hey. The History Network wants
in on this. We're news, too.

Only news told much, much later.

01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:28,548
Yes, it is. And the
mighty Minotaur.

2184
01:46:29,758 --> 01:46:31,155
I don't know about this, man.

2185
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:34,242
The Minotaur isn't even history!
He's mythology!

2186
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:37,724
Let's not downplay the fact

2187
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:40,248
that that's the ghost
of Stonewall Jackson!

2188
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:44,712
May the Lord anoint
this hallowed field of battle.

2189
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:48,385
You guys got room in this
battle for an old war horse?

2190
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:50,403
Mack Tannen! What
are you doing here?

2191
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:51,721
You're too old for this.

2192
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:54,240
Well, you see, there's the thing.

2193
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:59,939
When there's an early moon,
I almost feel like a stallion again!

2194
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:02,016
He's on our side, right, Ron?

2195
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:11,696
He's a were-hyena!

2196
01:47:12,968 --> 01:47:15,241
I'm-a call Michael Jackson.
I got a video idea.

2197
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:17,497
All right, everyone, listen up!

2198
01:47:21,185 --> 01:47:26,041
By virtue of being on this
battlefield, there is no return.

2199
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:29,043
People will die.

2200
01:47:29,318 --> 01:47:30,652
I'm so horny right now.

2201
01:47:30,653 --> 01:47:32,505
Some will be disfigured.

2202
01:47:32,613 --> 01:47:36,889
In some cases, lasting
friendships will be made.

2203
01:47:37,743 --> 01:47:42,144
And as usual, no touching
of the hair and face.

2204
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:44,624
Come on. What do we
look like, rookies?

2205
01:47:44,625 --> 01:47:45,772
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

2206
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:47,728
When El Trousias,

2207
01:47:47,836 --> 01:47:51,110
maiden of the clouds,
blows the battle horn,

2208
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:53,738
let the battle begin!

2209
01:47:53,801 --> 01:47:56,279
I am El Trousias!

2210
01:47:58,138 --> 01:48:00,411
Hear my siren song!

2211
01:48:02,643 --> 01:48:04,519
El Trousias...

2212
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,748
The Juicies'. Hmm.

2213
01:48:11,694 --> 01:48:13,262
That means you can start.

2214
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:16,636
Brick, what the hell is that?

2215
01:48:17,241 --> 01:48:18,684
It's a gun from the future.

2216
01:48:18,993 --> 01:48:20,891
No fair! He's got a
gun from the future!

2217
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:23,059
Where did you get it from?

2218
01:48:38,178 --> 01:48:42,124
In the name of the King,
the Queen and St. George.

2219
01:48:45,019 --> 01:48:46,185
Huzzah!

2220
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:20,329
Guess you didn't see that coming.

2221
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:22,038
Twenty degrees right.

2222
01:49:22,806 --> 01:49:23,998
Fill that gap!

2223
01:49:24,058 --> 01:49:29,164
Fall upon your swords!
Life has no meaning!

2224
01:49:30,731 --> 01:49:34,506
There will be a mint julep
waiting on the other side, son.

2225
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:38,012
Release your soul to me.

2226
01:49:56,423 --> 01:49:57,866
Sorry!

2227
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,152
Sorry! Sorry!

2228
01:50:00,511 --> 01:50:02,454
Sex Panther powers activate.

2229
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:27,562
It's the ghost of
Stonewall Jackson!

2230
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:30,440
Everyone, it's the ghost
of Stonewall Jackson!

2231
01:50:30,833 --> 01:50:32,526
Why do we have to fight?

2232
01:50:33,168 --> 01:50:34,736
There's so much
I could learn from you.

2233
01:50:43,178 --> 01:50:45,638
In the name of Margaret Thatcher...

2234
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:47,640
- No!
- I sentence you to death!

2235
01:50:47,641 --> 01:50:49,368
Please, no!

2236
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:51,207
Oh!

2237
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:54,919
What in the name of Dan Issel?

2238
01:50:57,151 --> 01:50:58,252
Gary!

2239
01:50:58,318 --> 01:50:59,761
Yes, Ron.

2240
01:51:00,988 --> 01:51:03,090
You and I never got along.

2241
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:04,866
But using the power of my mind,

2242
01:51:04,867 --> 01:51:07,641
I was able to see in the future
that you would do good.

2243
01:51:09,454 --> 01:51:10,955
- Now, go.
- I knew it!

2244
01:51:10,956 --> 01:51:12,540
Go to your son's recital.

2245
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:14,268
I knew you had mind powers!

2246
01:51:14,293 --> 01:51:16,521
And make it the greatest
day of your life!

2247
01:51:16,587 --> 01:51:18,838
Almighty, Almighty,
light the fuse on my call.

2248
01:51:18,839 --> 01:51:20,840
Thirty-niner-niner-14,
cook these fools.

2249
01:51:20,841 --> 01:51:22,443
I repeat, cook these fools.

2250
01:51:33,604 --> 01:51:35,938
We've got to get out of here.
There's too much news!

2251
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:37,648
Man, what a rush!

2252
01:51:37,649 --> 01:51:39,126
The monster's my friend!

2253
01:51:39,151 --> 01:51:41,345
Ron, we can still make
your kid's recital!

2254
01:51:42,613 --> 01:51:44,465
Hey, Ronny.

2255
01:51:44,615 --> 01:51:47,783
Jack Lime, please, I just want
to get to my son's recital.

2256
01:51:47,784 --> 01:51:49,702
No! That is out of the question!

2257
01:51:49,703 --> 01:51:50,828
We're outnumbered, Ron.

2258
01:51:50,829 --> 01:51:52,602
Foam the runway, I'm coming in hot!

2259
01:52:04,718 --> 01:52:08,072
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

2260
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:10,499
And then four guys
on bikes showed up.

2261
01:52:10,807 --> 01:52:13,751
Wes Mantooth and the
Channel Nine news team!

2262
01:52:13,936 --> 01:52:15,394
Hey, what the hell are
you guys doing here?

2263
01:52:15,395 --> 01:52:16,838
This is a national news fight.

2264
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:18,837
You made one mistake today.

2265
01:52:19,524 --> 01:52:21,592
You messed with somebody
from San Diego.

2266
01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:25,180
It's actually pronounced San Diago.

2267
01:52:25,322 --> 01:52:27,925
Hell, Ron and I may not
agree on everything,

2268
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:30,076
but we share the bond of being

2269
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:32,117
from the greatest city in
the history of this Earth.

2270
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:35,061
Well, ain't that cute?

2271
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:37,359
But you're outnumbered
three-to-one.

2272
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:39,228
Why don't you go back to your mama?

2273
01:52:39,253 --> 01:52:41,401
Don't you use my
mom's name in vain.

2274
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:44,590
Dorothy Mantooth was a
hard-working single woman

2275
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:46,467
who raised seven
children on her own,

2276
01:52:46,468 --> 01:52:48,991
and she remained sexually
active till the day she died.

2277
01:52:49,137 --> 01:52:51,535
She brought pole dancing
into the mainstream.

2278
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:54,934
Now here's the thing.
While I've been talking,

2279
01:52:54,935 --> 01:52:58,539
my news team has emptied
their gas tanks at your feet.

2280
01:53:01,441 --> 01:53:04,215
I drop this smoke and every
one of you goes "poof."

2281
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:06,612
Well, you forgot one
thing, leatherman.

2282
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:08,322
You drop that smoke, you die, too.

2283
01:53:12,119 --> 01:53:14,062
With the things I've
done in my life,

2284
01:53:14,871 --> 01:53:16,973
oh, I know I'm going
to burn in hell.

2285
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:20,732
So I sure as shit ain't afraid
to burn here on Earth.

2286
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:22,688
Oh, my goodness!

2287
01:53:22,754 --> 01:53:24,982
That's the most badass
thing I have ever heard.

2288
01:53:25,632 --> 01:53:26,949
All right!

2289
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:29,385
Looks like this fight's over.

2290
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:32,698
Let's go, boys.

2291
01:53:33,765 --> 01:53:36,744
Yay! We won! Let's celebrate!

2292
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,060
Sparklers!

2293
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:40,914
- No, no, no, Brick!
- No!

2294
01:54:04,755 --> 01:54:07,199
- Bravo! Bravo.
- Yeah. Whoo!

2295
01:54:09,343 --> 01:54:10,535
Dad!

2296
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:13,038
Son, I fought a
Minotaur to be here.

2297
01:54:13,555 --> 01:54:14,952
And I'd do it again.

2298
01:54:15,015 --> 01:54:18,710
Dad! Together we can defeat voodoo!

2299
01:54:19,019 --> 01:54:21,771
<i>Ron had finally
learned how to love his son</i>

2300
01:54:21,772 --> 01:54:24,546
<i>and his wife more than his career.</i>

2301
01:54:25,484 --> 01:54:28,258
<i>And as it turned out,
his walking off the news</i>

2302
01:54:28,612 --> 01:54:31,966
<i>was the highest-rated
TV event of the year.</i>

2303
01:54:32,616 --> 01:54:35,094
<i>He and his news team,
along with Veronica,</i>

2304
01:54:35,202 --> 01:54:37,896
<i>could have any job they wanted.</i>

2305
01:54:38,497 --> 01:54:42,397
<i>But before that, they had one
little thing to take care of.</i>

2306
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:49,032
And now, before I join this
couple in holy matrimony,

2307
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:51,569
Brick and Chani ask us to join them

2308
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:53,737
as they exchange their vows.

2309
01:54:54,638 --> 01:54:55,830
My dearest Brick.

2310
01:54:56,139 --> 01:54:58,333
Everything I have is yours.

2311
01:54:58,809 --> 01:55:01,503
My four lawnmowers. My sister.

2312
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:06,816
My 35 ferrets. My massive student
loan and real estate debt.

2313
01:55:06,817 --> 01:55:08,089
It's all yours.

2314
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:11,362
Oh, Chani.

2315
01:55:11,363 --> 01:55:14,698
I will never forget the
exact moment I saw you.

2316
01:55:14,699 --> 01:55:18,494
My pee-pee got all uncomfortable
in my pants, and I thought,

2317
01:55:18,495 --> 01:55:22,099
"Here comes the warm milkshake
out of the tip of my belly stick."

2318
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:27,604
Wait! Look!

2319
01:55:27,712 --> 01:55:29,655
Walter, Walter, honey, shh!

2320
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:31,733
Look in the water!

2321
01:55:32,134 --> 01:55:34,362
It's Doby!

2322
01:55:34,386 --> 01:55:35,658
Oh, my God.

2323
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:38,123
It's Doby! Doby!

2324
01:55:38,432 --> 01:55:41,081
Ron, what are you doing?
He's not your friend!

2325
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:42,543
Doby!

2326
01:55:42,978 --> 01:55:45,297
Ron! That's a shark!

2327
01:55:45,605 --> 01:55:47,503
He will eat you!

2328
01:55:48,358 --> 01:55:50,802
<i>Old friends</i>

2329
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:54,321
<i>Old friends</i>

2330
01:55:54,322 --> 01:55:55,799
Doby!

2331
01:55:56,658 --> 01:56:00,808
<i>Sat on their park
bench like bookends</i>

2332
01:56:01,413 --> 01:56:02,639
Oh, my God!

2333
01:56:02,706 --> 01:56:04,479
The shark actually recognizes him!

2334
01:56:06,668 --> 01:56:08,395
Nope.
He's viciously attacking him.

2335
01:56:09,296 --> 01:56:12,320
Doby! Doby, it's me! Ron!

2336
01:56:12,382 --> 01:56:14,780
<i>If a man dies
with love in his heart,</i>

2337
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:16,987
<i>does he truly die?</i>

2338
01:56:17,053 --> 01:56:18,471
<i>Absolutely!</i>

<i>But on this day, Ron Burgundy's grapple
with this denizen from the deep</i>

2340
01:56:23,143 --> 01:56:26,937
<i>was halted by 28 pounds
of furry providence.</i>

2341
01:56:31,735 --> 01:56:33,007
I bottle-fed you!

2342
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:37,181
Baxter!

2343
01:56:44,247 --> 01:56:45,519
Baxter!

2344
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:49,437
Baxter! Ah, yes!

2345
01:56:52,672 --> 01:56:55,867
I know, I know, I love you, too.

2346
01:56:59,054 --> 01:57:00,497
Oh. Come on.

2347
02:02:28,758 --> 02:02:30,326
All right, let's do it.

2348
02:02:32,303 --> 02:02:33,679
You guys think...

2349
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:35,202
I don't know how to use a computer.

2350
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:38,517
Hey, fellas. I just saw
Jack Lime out there.

2351
02:02:38,518 --> 02:02:40,837
He's a goddamn iceman.

2352
02:02:41,229 --> 02:02:43,047
Scared the crap out of me.

2352
02:02:44,305 --> 02:03:44,473
