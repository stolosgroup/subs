[539][586]/This is the story of how I died.
[586][628]/Don't worry, this is actually|/a very fun story. And the truth is, it isn't even mine.
[628][671]/This is the story of a girl named,|/Rapunzel.
[671][714]/And it starts, with the sun.
[714][763]/Now, once upon a time, a single|/drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.
[763][825]/And from this small drop of sun,|/grew a magic, golden, flower.
[825][874]/It had the ability to heal the sick,|/and injured.
[874][895]/Oh, you see that old woman,|/over there?
[895][913]/You might want to remember her.
[913][940]/She's kind of important.
[940][991]/Well, centuries pass and a hop|/skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.
[991][1034]/The kingdom was ruled by a beloved|/King and Queen.
[1034][1065]/And the Queen, well she was about|/to have a baby,
[1065][1089]/but she got sick,
[1089][1106]/really, sick.
[1106][1120]/She was running out of time.
[1120][1145]/And that's when people usually start|/to look for a miracle.
[1145][1187]/Or in this case, a magic golden flower.
[1187][1217]/Ahhh, I told you she'd|/be important.
[1217][1240]/You see instead of sharing the|/suns gift,
[1240][1271]/this woman, Mother Gothel,|/hoarded its healing power
[1271][1300]/and used it to keep herself|/young for hundreds of years.
[1300][1341]/And all she had to do,|/was sing a special song.
[1341][1406]/Flower gleam and glow,|/let your power shine
[1420][1495]/Make the clock reverse,|/bring back what once was mine
[1503][1542]/What once was mine
[1550][1649]/All right, you get the jist. She sings|/to it, she turns young, creepy, right?
[1693][1728]We've found it!
[1760][1821]/The magic of the golden flower,|/healed the queen.
[1821][1853]/A healthy baby girl,|/a princess was born.
[1853][1901]/With beautiful golden hair.
[1958][1970]/I'll give you a hint.
[1970][2004]/That's Rapunzel.
[2004][2105]/To celebrate her birth, the King and|/Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.
[2105][2170]/And for that one moment,|/everything was perfect.
[2170][2199]/And then that moment ended.
[2199][2266]/Flower, gleam and glow,|/let your powers shine
[2303][2350]/Make the clock re...|/HUH!
[2387][2405]/Gothel broke into the castle,
[2405][2453]/stole the child, and|/just like that... gone.
[2453][2490]/The Kingdom searched and searched,|/but they could not find the Princess.
[2490][2508]/For deep within the forest
[2508][2524]/In a hidden tower.
[2524][2543]/Gothel raised the child|/as her own.
[2543][2642]/...bring what has been lost, bring back what|/once was mine, what once was mine.
[2642][2662]/Gothel had found her new magic flower.
[2662][2696]/But this time she was determined|/to keep it hidden.
[2696][2724]Why can't I go outside?
[2724][2755]The outside world is a dangerous place.
[2755][2778]Filled with horrible, selfish people.
[2778][2873]- You must stay here, where you're safe. Do you understand, flower?|- Yes, Mommy.
[2873][2950]/But the walls of that tower,|/could not hide everything.
[2953][2999]/Each year on her birthday, the King and Queen|/released thousands of lanterns into the sky.
[2999][3077]/In hope that one day, their lost|/Princess, would return.
[3243][3265]HAH!
[3265][3332]Hmm, Well I guess Pascal's|not hiding out here.
[3343][3370]GOTCHA!
[3371][3395]That's twenty two for me.
[3395][3430]How about twenty three,|out of forty five?
[3430][3480]Okay, well, what do you want to do?
[3480][3507]Yeah, I don't think so.
[3507][3549]I like it in here and so do you.
[3549][3614]Oh, come on Pascal, it's|not so bad in there.
[3701][3715]Sings "When will my life begin"
[3715][3757]/7a.m. the usual morning line-up
[3757][3789]/Start on the chores I sweep|/'til the floors all clean.
[3789][3839]/Polish and wax, do laundry and|/mop and shine up.
[3839][3887]/Sweep again, and by then|/it's like 7:15.
[3887][3930]/So I'll read a book,|/or maybe two or three.
[3930][3977]/Ill add a few new paintings|/to my gallery.
[3977][4021]/I'll play guitar, and knit, and cook|/and basically.
[4021][4080]/Just wonder when will my|/life, begin.
[4157][4196]/Then after lunch, it's puzzles,|/and darts and baking.
[4196][4241]/Papier-mache, a bit of ballet,|/and chess.
[4241][4284]/Pottery, and ventriloquy,|/candle making.
[4284][4357]/Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch.|/Take a climb, sew a dress, and I'll re-read the books.
[4357][4414]/If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall|/some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.
[4414][4465]/And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush,|/and brush my hair.
[4465][4507]/Stuck in the same place|/I've always been.
[4507][4548]/And I'll keep wondering, and wondering,|/and wondering...
[4548][4604]/Wondering, when will my life begin?
[4615][4676]/Tomorrow night, the|/lights will appear.
[4689][4755]/Just like they do on my birthday,|/each year.
[4792][4857]/What is it like, out there|/where they glow?
[4882][4952]/Now that I'm older. Mother|/might just let me go.
[5209][5222]Wow!
[5222][5248]I could get used to a view like this.
[5248][5280]- Ryder, come on.|- Hold on.
[5280][5318]Yep, I'm used to it.|Guys I want a castle.
[5318][5384]We do this job, you could|buy your own castle.
[5466][5486]Oh, hay fever?
[5486][5511]Yeah.
[5513][5534]Huh?
[5534][5566]Wait, wait.|Hey, wait!
[5566][5590]Can't you picture me in a castle of|my own?
[5590][5601]'Cause I certainly can.
[5601][5626]Oh, the things we've seen and|it's only eight in the morning.
[5626][5665]Gentlemen, this is a very big day.
[5665][5707]This is it. This is|a very big day, Pascal.
[5707][5736]I'm finally going to do it.
[5736][5768]- I'm going to ask her.|- RAPUNZEL!
[5768][5802]Let down your hair.
[5802][5823]It's time.
[5823][5876]I know, I know. Come on, don't|let her see you.
[5876][5922]Rapunzel, I'm not getting any|younger down here.
[5922][5957]Coming, mother.
[6184][6212]Hi, welcome home, mother.
[6212][6259]Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage to do|that every single day,
[6259][6299]without fail, it looks absolutely|exhausting, darling.
[6299][6322]Oh, it's nothing.
[6322][6358]Then I don't know why it|takes so long.
[6358][6396]Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.
[6396][6452]All right... so, mother.|As you know tomorrow is a very big day.
[6452][6474]Rapunzel look in that mirror.|You know what I see?
[6474][6525]I see a strong, confident,|beautiful young lady.
[6525][6553]Oh look, you're here too.
[6553][6590]I'm just teasing, stop taking|everything so seriously.
[6590][6625]Okay, so mother. As I|was saying, tomorrow...
[6625][6645]Rapunzel, mother's|feeling a little run down.
[6645][6669]Would you sing for me, dear?
[6669][6732]- Then we'll talk.|- OH! Of course, mother.
[6781][6815]/Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine,|/Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.
[6815][6855]/Heal what has been hurt, Change the fate's design.|/Save what has been lost, Bring back what once was mine.
[6855][6874]- Rapunzel!|- So, mother,
[6874][6906]Earlier I was saying that tomorrow was a|pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,
[6906][6928]So I'm just going to tell you.|It's my birthday!
[6928][6942]TADA!
[6942][6955]No, no, no can't be.
[6955][6988]I distinctly remember. Your|birthday was last year.
[6988][7040]That's the funny thing about birthdays.|They're kind of an annual thing.
[7040][7069]Mother, I'm turning eighteen.
[7069][7117]And I wanted to ask,|what I really want for this birthday.
[7117][7147]Actually what I want for...
[7147][7164]Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.
[7164][7184]You know how I feel about the mumbling.
[7184][7206]Blah, blah, blah,... blah.|It's very annoying.
[7206][7288]I'm just teasing, you're adorable|I love you so much, darling.
[7295][7336]Oh, I want to see the floating lights.
[7336][7355]- What?|- Oh,...
[7355][7392]Well I was hoping you would|take me to see the floating lights.
[7392][7425]Oh, you mean the stars.
[7425][7450]That's the thing
[7450][7486]I've charted stars and they're|always constant.
[7486][7526]But these, they appear every year|on my birthday, Mother.
[7526][7546]Only on my birthday.
[7546][7576]And I can't help but feel that they're,
[7576][7606]They're meant for me.
[7606][7644]I need see them, Mother.|And not just from my window.
[7644][7659]In person.
[7659][7688]I have to know what they are.
[7688][7710]You want to go outside?
[7710][7734]Oh, why Rapunzel.
[7734][7766]Look at you, as|fragile as a flower.
[7766][7805]/Still a little|/sapling, just a sprout.
[7805][7848]/- You know why we stay up in this tower|/I know, but...
[7848][7897]/That’s right, to keep you safe,|/and sound, dear.
[7897][7925]/Guess I always knew|/this day was coming.
[7925][7964]/Know that soon you'd want|/to leave the nest.
[7964][7988]/- Soon, but not yet. Shhh..|/- But
[7988][8043]/Trust me pet,|/Mother, knows best.
[8067][8082]/Mother knows best,
[8082][8099]/listen to your mother.
[8099][8125]/It's a scary world|/out there.
[8125][8144]/Mother knows best.
[8144][8193]/One way or another, something|/will go wrong, I swear.
[8193][8223]/Ruffians, thugs, poison Ivy,|/quicksand.
[8223][8250]/Cannibals, and snakes,|/the plague... yes.
[8250][8285]/Also large bugs, men|/with pointy teeth.
[8285][8324]/And stop, no more,|/you'll just upset me.
[8324][8351]/Mother's right here,|/mother will protect you.
[8351][8387]/Darling here's what I suggest.
[8387][8421]/Skip the drama,|/stay with Mama.
[8421][8461]/Mother, knows best.
[8494][8528]/Mother knows best.|/Take it from your mumsey.
[8528][8551]/On your own, you won't survive.
[8551][8587]/Sloppy underdressed,|/immature, clumsy,
[8587][8611]/Please, they'll eat you up,|/alive.
[8611][8650]/Gullible, naïve,|/positively grubby.
[8650][8679]/Ditzy and a bit,|/well, hmm vague.
[8679][8710]/Plus I believe, getting|/kinda chubby.
[8710][8748]/I'm just saying,|/'Cause I wuv you.
[8748][8777]/Mother understands,|/Mothers here to help you.
[8777][8824]/All I have is one request.
[8872][8910]- Rapunzel?|- Yes?
[8912][8953]Don't ever ask to|leave this tower, again.
[8953][8984]Yes, Mother.
[8984][9025]Ahh, I love you very much, dear.
[9025][9046]I love you more.
[9046][9080]I love you most.
[9080][9104]Don't forget it.
[9104][9142]/You'll regret it.
[9144][9165]/Motherrrrrrr.
[9165][9197]/Knows best.
[9227][9280]Ta, ta, I'll see you|in a bit, my flower.
[9280][9313]I'll be here.
[9545][9607]No, no no. This is bad, this is|very, very bad, This is really bad.
[9607][9628]They just can't get my nose right.
[9628][9644]Who cares.
[9644][9660]Well it's easy for you to say.
[9660][9702]You guys look amazing.
[9827][9871]All right, okay. Give me a boost,|and I'll pull you up.
[9871][9891]Give us the satchel first.
[9891][9917]Wha..? I just...
[9917][9935]I can't believe, that after all|we've been through together,
[9935][9974]you don't trust me.
[9980][10005]Ouch.
[10070][10089]Now help us up, pretty boy.
[10089][10127]Sorry, my hands are full.
[10127][10147]What?
[10147][10173]RYDER!
[10227][10298]- Retrieve that satchel with any force.|- Yes, sir!
[10424][10468]We got him now, Maximus.
[10522][10549]Heeyah!
[10577][10626]Heeyah! Come flea-bag, forward.
[10626][10637]No.
[10637][10652]No, stop it.
[10652][10667]Stop it.
[10667][10701]Give it to me.
[10962][10986]HAH!
[11037][11078]- AHHHHH!|- WHINNEYY!
[11316][11339]Oh!
[11716][11750]Alone at last.
[12352][12376]Huh?
[12588][12612]Aah!
[12693][12725]Okay, okay, I got a person|in my closet.
[12725][12762]I've got a person in my closet.
[12762][12813]I've got a person in my closet!
[12827][12854]To weak to handle myself|out there, huh Mother?
[12854][12907]Well, Tell that to my frying pan.
[13115][13140]Hmmm.
[13302][13331]Rapunzel!
[13333][13359]Let down your hair.
[13359][13369]One moment, Mother.
[13369][13391]I have a big surprise.
[13391][13414]Uh, I do too.
[13414][13441]Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.
[13441][13482]I seriously doubt it.
[13484][13525]I brought back parsnips. I'm going to make|hazel nut soup for dinner, your favorite.
[13525][13537]Surprise!
[13537][13564]Well mother, there's something|I want to tell you.
[13564][13591]Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate|leaving you after a fight.
[13591][13617]Especially when I've done|absolutely nothing wrong.
[13617][13655]Okay, I've been thinking a lot|about what you said, earlier.
[13655][13679]I hope you're not still talking|about the stars.
[13679][13705]Floating lights, and yes|I'm leading up to that.
[13705][13728]Because I really thought|we dropped the issue, sweetheart.
[13728][13748]No Mother, I'm just saying,
[13748][13777]you think I'm not strong enough|to handle myself out there.
[13777][13812]Oh darling, I know you're not strong|enough to handle yourself out there.
[13812][13844]- But if you just...|- Rapunzel, we're done talking about this.
[13844][13857]- Trust me,...|- Rapunzel.
[13857][13871]- ...I know what I'm|- Rapunzel.
[13871][13893]- Oh, come on.|- Enough with the lights, Rapunzel.
[13893][13950]You are not leaving this tower,|EVER!
[13994][14045]Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.
[14161][14193]All I was gonna say, mother|is that...
[14193][14226]I know what I want for my|birthday, now.
[14226][14249]And what is that?
[14249][14307]New paint. That paint made from|the white shells you once brought me.
[14307][14338]Well that is a very long trip,|Rapunzel.
[14338][14359]Almost three day's time.
[14359][14431]I just thought it was a|better idea than, uh, stars.
[14453][14476]You sure you'll be all right,|on your own?
[14476][14533]I know I'm safe, as long|as I'm here.
[14591][14616]I'll be back in three days time.
[14616][14649]I love you very much, dear.
[14649][14669]I love you more.
[14669][14705]I love you most.
[14909][14934]Okay.
[15080][15104]Hmm.
[15299][15324]AHHH!
[15371][15407]Is this... hair?
[15407][15443]Struggling... struggling is pointless.
[15443][15467]Huh?
[15474][15494]I know why you're here.
[15494][15524]And I'm not afraid of you.
[15524][15549]What?
[15627][15677]Who are you, and how|did you find me?
[15677][15701]Ah hah.
[15701][15758]Who are you, and how|did you find me?
[15767][15785]I know not who you are.
[15785][15807]Nor how I came to find you.
[15807][15841]But may I just say.
[15841][15864]Hi!
[15878][15896]How you doing?
[15896][15926]The name's Flynn Ryder.
[15926][15951]How's your day going, huh?
[15951][15998]Who else knows my location,|Flynn Ryder?
[15998][16019]- All right, Blondie.|- Rapunzel.
[16019][16035]Gesundheit, here's the deal.
[16035][16064]I was in a situation,|Gallivanting through the forest.
[16064][16092]I came across your tower and...
[16092][16118]Ho, oh no, where is my satchel?
[16118][16182]I've hidden it, somewhere you'll|never find it.
[16182][16229]It's in that pot, isn't it.
[16245][16258]Huh?
[16258][16289]Ahh, will you stop that.
[16289][16328]Now it's hidden where|you'll never find it.
[16328][16360]So, what do you want,|with my hair?
[16360][16372]- To cut it?|- What?
[16372][16389]- Sell it?|- No!
[16389][16418]Listen, the only thing I want|to do with your hair,
[16418][16449]is to get out of it.|Literally.
[16449][16480]Wait, you don't want my hair?
[16480][16500]Why on earth would|I want your hair?
[16500][16535]Look, I was being chased, I saw a|tower, I climbed it, end of story.
[16535][16555]You're, telling the truth?
[16555][16570]Yes.
[16570][16595]Hmmm.
[16690][16716]I know, I need someone|to take me.
[16716][16739]I think he's telling the truth, too.
[16739][16788]Doesn't have fangs,|but what choice do I have?
[16788][16840]Uh, okay Flynn Ryder,|I'm prepared to offer you a deal.
[16840][16862]- Deal?|- Look this way.
[16862][16872]Oh... oomph!
[16872][16898]Do you know what these are?
[16898][16931]You mean the lantern thing|they do for the princess?
[16931][16950]Lanterns...
[16950][16980]I knew they weren't stars.
[16980][17026]Well, tomorrow evening|they will light the night sky,
[17026][17066]with these lanterns.|You will act as my guide,
[17066][17103]Take me to these lanterns,|and return me home safely.
[17103][17146]Then, and only then, will|I return your satchel to you.
[17146][17159]That is my deal.
[17159][17194]Yeah, no can do.
[17194][17233]Unfortunately, the kingdom and I|aren't exactly, simpatico,
[17233][17302]at the moment. So I|won't be taking you anywhere.
[17327][17358]Something brought you here,|Flynn Ryder.
[17358][17400]- Call it what you will, fate, destiny.|- A horse.
[17400][17426]So I have made the decision to|trust you.
[17426][17439]A horrible decision, really.
[17439][17487]But trust me, when I tell you this.
[17487][17524]You can tear this tower apart,|brick by brick.
[17524][17568]But without my help, you will|never find your precious satchel.
[17568][17598]Let me just get this straight.
[17598][17617]I take you to see the lanterns.
[17617][17630]Bring you back home,
[17630][17651]and you'll give me back my satchel?
[17651][17681]I promise.
[17682][17756]And when I promise something, I never|ever break that promise.
[17756][17781]EVER!
[17801][17828]All right, listen, I didn't want|to have to want to do this,
[17828][17851]but you leave me no choice.
[17851][17896]Here comes the 'smolder'.
[17943][17964]This is kind of an off day for me.
[17964][17982]This doesn't normally happen.
[17982][18008]Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.
[18008][18031]Really!
[18031][18085]- Ooops.|- You broke my 'smolder'.
[18105][18145]You coming, Blondie?
[18230][18280]/Look at the world so close, and I'm|/half way to it
[18280][18325]/Look at it all, so big|/do I even dare?
[18325][18375]/Look at me, here at last|/I just have to do it.
[18375][18404]Should I? No.
[18404][18434]Here I go.
[18467][18503]Triumphant music
[18722][18796]/Just smell the grass, the dirt.|/Just like I dreamed they'd be.
[18796][18822]/Just feel that summer breeze.
[18822][18860]/The way it's calling me.
[18860][18932]/For like the first time ever,|/I'm completely free.
[18936][18985]/I could go running, and racing,|/and dancing...
[18985][19014]/and chasing, and leaping|/and bounding.
[19014][19050]/Hair flying, heart pounding|/and splashing and reeling.
[19050][19081]/And finally feeling,
[19081][19130]/That's when my life|/begins.
[19220][19259]I can't believe I did this.
[19259][19318]I can't believe I did this.|I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!
[19318][19343]Mother would be so furious.
[19343][19377]That's okay, what she doesn’t|know won't kill her, right?
[19377][19406]Oh my gosh, this would kill her.
[19406][19439]THIS IS SO FUN!
[19439][19475]I am a horrible daughter,|I'm going back.
[19475][19502]I am never going|baaaccckkk!
[19502][19542]I am a despicable human being.
[19542][19563]WAHHOOOOO!
[19563][19598]Best day, ever!
[19674][19705]You know, I can't help but notice,
[19705][19742]you seem a little at war|with yourself, here.
[19742][19772]- What?|- Now, I'm only picking up bits and pieces,
[19772][19796]of course, over protective mother,|forbidden road trip.
[19796][19812]I mean, this is serious stuff.
[19812][19831]But let me ease your conscious.
[19831][19849]This is part of growing up.
[19849][19870]A little rebellion, a little adventure.
[19870][19902]That's good, healthy even.
[19902][19919]You think?
[19919][19949]I know. You're way over thinking|this, trust me.
[19949][19970]Does your mother deserve it?|No.
[19970][19995]Will this break her heart|and crush her soul?
[19995][20035]Of course.|But you just got to do it.
[20035][20050]Break her heart?
[20050][20082]- In half.|- Crush her soul?
[20082][20101]Like a grape.
[20101][20131]She would be heart broken,|you're right.
[20131][20174]I am, oh my, oh bother.
[20183][20204]All right, I can't believe I'm|saying this, but...
[20204][20220]I'm letting you out of the deal.
[20220][20238]- What?|- That's right.
[20238][20265]But don't thank me. Let's|just turn around,
[20265][20282]and get you home, here's|your pan and your frog.
[20282][20300]I get back my satchel.
[20300][20320]You get back a mother|daughter relationship
[20320][20362]based on mutual trust and viola!|We part ways as unlikely friends.
[20362][20407]- No, I am seeing those lanterns.|- Oh, come on!
[20407][20431]What is it going to take|to get my satchel back?
[20431][20467]I will use this.
[20479][20545]Is it, ruffians, thugs?|Have they come for me?
[20551][20580]Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.
[20580][20609]Oh, sorry.
[20609][20648]Guess I'm just a little bit, jumpy.
[20648][20688]Probably be best if we avoid|ruffians and thugs, though.
[20688][20736]Yeah, that probably be best.
[20737][20769]Are you hungry?|I know a great place for lunch.
[20769][20795]- Where?|- Oh, don't you worry.
[20795][20848]You'll know it when you smell it.
[21170][21209]Oh, a Palace horse.
[21211][21243]Where's your rider?
[21243][21265]Rapunzel.
[21265][21294]RAPUNZEL!
[21357][21406]Rapunzel, let down your hair.
[21411][21440]Rapunzel?
[21623][21652]Rapunzel!
[21663][21692]RAPUNZEL!
[22124][22164]I know it's around here, somewhere.
[22164][22183]Ah, there it is.
[22183][22202]The Snuggly duckling.
[22202][22230]Don't worry, very quaint place,|perfect for you.
[22230][22264]Don't want you scaring, and giving|up on this whole endeavor now do we?
[22264][22310]- Well, I do like duckling.|- YAY!
[22310][22364]Garcon, your finest table, please.
[22406][22445]You smell that?|Take a deep breath through the nose.
[22445][22458]Really let that seep in.
[22458][22488]What are you getting?|Because to me, it's part man smell.
[22488][22506]and the other part is|really bad man smell.
[22506][22531]I don't know why, but overall,|it just smells like the color brown.
[22531][22546]Your thoughts?
[22546][22568]That's a lot of hair.
[22568][22597]She's growing it out, is that blood|on your moustache?
[22597][22623]Goldie, look at this, look at|all the blood on his moustache.
[22623][22658]Look sir, that's a lot of blood.
[22658][22677]Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.
[22677][22700]Maybe we should get you home.|Call it a day.
[22700][22732]Probably be better off. This is a five|star joint after all.
[22732][22767]And if you can't handle this place, well|maybe you should be back in your tower.
[22767][22799]Is this you?
[22816][22844]No, no this is being mean.
[22844][22856]Oh, it's him all right.
[22856][22878]Gretel, go find some guards.
[22878][22920]That reward's going to|buy me a new hook.
[22920][22935]I can use the money.
[22935][22964]What about me?|I'm broke.
[22964][22994]- Boys, stop!|- We can work this out.
[22994][23015]Hey, leave him alone.
[23015][23060]- Gentlemen, please.|- Give me back my guide, ruffians.
[23060][23099]HOO, HAH, HOO, HOO!
[23138][23182]Not the nose, not the nose,|not the nose!
[23182][23215]Put him down!
[23228][23273]Okay, I don't know where I am,|and I need him to take me to see the lanterns,
[23273][23300]because I've been dreaming about|them my entire life.
[23300][23323]Find your humanity.
[23323][23381]Haven’t any of you ever had a dream?
[23466][23488]I, had a dream.
[23488][23513]Once.
[23587][23611]/I've got a dream)|/I'm malicious mean and scary.
[23611][23632]/My sneer could curdle dairy.
[23632][23665]/And violence-wise my hands|/are not the cleanest.
[23665][23714]/But despite my evil look,|/and my temper and my hook.
[23714][23746]/I've always yearned to|/be a concert pianist.
[23746][23784]/Can't cha see me on the stage|/performing Mozart.
[23784][23820]/Tickling the ivories,|/'til they gleam.
[23820][23843]/Yep, I'd rather be called deadly.
[23843][23873]/For my killer show-tune medley.|/Thank you.
[23873][23910]/'Cause way down deep inside|/I've got a dream.
[23910][23944]/He's got a dream,|/he's got a dream.
[23944][23979]/See, I ain't as cruel and|/vicious as I seem.
[23979][24005]/Though I feel like breaking femurs.
[24005][24026]/You can count me with the dreamers.
[24026][24086]/Like everybody else,|/I've gotta dream.
[24109][24128]/I've got scars and lumps and bruises.
[24128][24150]/Plus something here that oozes.
[24150][24177]/Let's not even mention|/my complexion.
[24177][24198]/But despite my extra toes.
[24198][24217]/And my goiter and my nose.
[24217][24249]/I really want to make a love|/connection.
[24249][24289]/Can't you see me with a special|/little lady.
[24289][24321]/Rowing in a row boat,|/down the stream.
[24321][24342]/Though I'm one disgusting blighter.
[24342][24362]/I'm a lover, not a fighter.
[24362][24392]/'Cause way down deep|/inside, I gotta dream.
[24392][24429]/I gotta dream,|/I gotta dream.
[24429][24464]/And I know one day|/will never reign supreme.
[24464][24486]/Though my face leaves|/people screaming.
[24486][24507]/There's a child behind|/it dreaming.
[24507][24534]/Like everybody else,|/I've gotta dream.
[24534][24570]/Tor would like to quit|/and be a florist.
[24570][24610]/Gunther does interior design.
[24610][24649]/Ulf is into mime,|/Attila’s cupcakes are sublime.
[24649][24667]/Bruiser knits, Killer sews.
[24667][24687]/Fang does little puppet shows.
[24687][24742]/And Vladimir collects|/ceramic unicorns.
[24742][24768]What about you?
[24768][24791]- I'm sorry, me?|- What's your dream?
[24791][24836]No, no, no. Sorry boys,|I don't sing.
[24836][24855]/I have dreams like you,|/no really.
[24855][24871]/Just much less, touchy-feely.
[24871][24900]/They mainly happen somewhere|/warm and sunny.
[24900][24949]/On an island that I own,|/tanned and rested and alone.
[24949][24983]/Surrounded by enormous|/piles of money.
[24983][25017]/- I've got a dream... I've got a dream.|/- She’s got a dream.
[25017][25053]/I just want to see the floating|/lanterns gleam.
[25053][25077]/And with every passing hour.
[25077][25094]/I'm so glad I left my tower.
[25094][25123]/Like all you lovely folks,|/I've got a dream.
[25123][25164]/She's gotta dream, He's gotta dream.|/They've gotta dream, we've gotta dream.
[25164][25244]/So our differences ain't|/really that extreme. We're one big team.
[25244][25282]/Call us brutal, say sadistic|/and grotesquely optimistic.
[25282][25312]/'Cause way down deep inside,|/we've gotta dream.
[25312][25364]/We gotta dream,|/I gotta dream.
[25368][25408]/Yes way down deep inside|/I've got a...
[25408][25445]/Dreeeeeeaaaaamm.
[25468][25493]Yeah!
[25501][25540]I found the guards.
[25550][25566]Where's Ryder,|where is he?
[25566][25587]I know he's in here somewhere.
[25587][25659]Find him, turn the place|upside down if you have to!
[25778][25806]Go, live your dream.
[25806][25820]I will.
[25820][25867]Your dream stinks,|I was talking to her.
[25867][25909]Thanks for everything.
[25920][25949]I believe this is the man|you're looking for.
[25949][25976]You got me.
[25976][26026]Sir, there's no sign of Ryder.
[26035][26063]Maximus.
[26121][26157]What's he doing?
[26234][26267]A passage, come on men,|let's go.
[26267][26331]Corman, make sure those|boys don't get away.
[26343][26376]Play it safe.
[26377][26420]We'll go get the crown.
[26469][26510]I gotta dream,|I got some dream.
[26510][26557]I..., ohhh, somebody get me a glass.
[26557][26599]Because I just found me a|tall drink of water.
[26599][26640]Oh stop it, you big lug.
[26640][26665]Where does that tunnel lead out?
[26665][26691]Knife!
[26699][26714]Well, that got us safe.
[26714][26748]Didn't know you had that in you|back there. That was pretty, impressive.
[26748][26771]I KNOW!
[26771][26800]I know...
[26824][26851]Sooo, Flynn.
[26851][26863]Where are you from?
[26863][26885]Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie,|I don't do back story.
[26885][26914]However I am becoming very|interested in yours.
[26914][26939]Now I... I know I'm not suppose|to mention the hair.
[26939][26957]- Nope.|- Or, the Mother.
[26957][26985]- Uh, uh.|- Frankly I'm to scared to ask about the frog.
[26985][26999]- Chameleon.|- Nuance.
[26999][27038]Here's my question though, if you want|to see the lanterns so badly,
[27038][27066]why haven't you gone before?
[27066][27103]Uhh, hey, well...
[27143][27172]Uh, Flynn...
[27172][27198]Flynn!
[27208][27237]Run,|RUN!
[27408][27420]Who's that?
[27420][27432]They don't like me.
[27432][27463]- Who's that?|- They don't like me either.
[27463][27489]- Who's that?|- Lets just assume for the moment,
[27489][27504]that everyone here doesn't like me.
[27504][27529]Here.
[27611][27664]I've waited a long time for this.
[27724][27768]Oh mama, I have got to get me|one of these.
[27768][27792]HAH!
[27843][27927]You should know that this is|the strangest thing I've ever done.
[27937][27966]How 'bout two out of three?
[27966][27992]Flynn!
[28020][28043]Flynn, look out.
[28043][28089]- Whoa, WHOAAA!|- Hold on.
[28095][28126]You should see your faces.|Because you look...
[28126][28156]Ridiculous
[28211][28225]Come on, Blondie.
[28225][28250]Jump.
[29125][29179]It's no use,|I can't see anything.
[29211][29230]Hey, there's no point.
[29230][29278]It's pitch black down there.
[29329][29361]This is all my fault.
[29361][29426]She was right, I never|should have done this.
[29433][29455]I'm so...
[29455][29495]I'm so sorry, Flynn.
[29553][29580]Eugene.
[29582][29599]What?
[29599][29641]My real name is,|Eugene Fitzherbert.
[29641][29687]So you might as well know.
[29688][29723]I have magic hair that glows|when I sing.
[29723][29748]What?
[29756][29808]I have magic hair,|that glows when I sing.
[29808][29874]/Flower gleam and glow.|/Let your power shine.
[30337][30358]We made it.
[30358][30371]Her hair glows.
[30371][30398]We're alive.|I'm alive!
[30398][30426]I didn't see that coming.|You're hair actually glows.
[30426][30445]- Eugene...|- Why does her hair glow?
[30445][30470]- Eugene!|- What?
[30470][30511]It doesn't just glow.
[30521][30565]Why is he smiling at me?
[30782][30794]I'll kill him.
[30794][30825]I'll kill that, Ryder.
[30825][30846]We'll cut him off at the kingdom.
[30846][30883]And get back the crown, come on.
[30883][30908]Boys.
[30908][30956]Perhaps you want to stop acting|like wild dogs chasing their tails,
[30956][30997]and think for a moment.
[30997][31053]Oh, please there's no|need for that.
[31075][31113]Well if that's all you desire,|then be on your way.
[31113][31143]I was going to offer you something|worth one thousand crowns,
[31143][31163]would have made you|rich beyond belief.
[31163][31183]And that wasn't even the best part.
[31183][31199]Oh well, C'est la vie.
[31199][31236]Enjoy your crown.
[31238][31258]What's the best part?
[31258][31315]It comes with revenge|on Flynn Ryder.
[31374][31431]So you're being strangely cryptic as you wrap|your magic hair around my injured hand.
[31431][31454]Sorry.
[31454][31502]Just don't, don't freak out.
[31553][31591]/Flower gleam and glow
[31591][31633]/Let your powers shine
[31635][31676]/Make the clock reverse
[31676][31712]/Bring back what once was mine.
[31712][31757]/Heal what has been hurt.
[31762][31805]/Change the fates design.
[31805][31847]/Save what has been lost.
[31847][31878]/Bring back what once was mine.
[31878][31918]/What once was mine.
[32075][32128]- Ah...|- Please don't freak out.
[32131][32153]Ahhh. I'm not freaking out,|are you freaking out?
[32153][32188]No, I'm just very interested in your hair.|and the magical qualities that it possesses.
[32188][32222]How long has it been|doing that, exactly?
[32222][32257]Forever, I guess.
[32257][32289]Mother said when I was a baby|people tried to cut it.
[32289][32313]They wanted to take it for themselves.
[32313][32336]But, once it's cut.
[32336][32370]It turns brown, and looses its power.
[32370][32412]A gift like that, it|has to be protected.
[32412][32465]That's why Mother never let me...
[32473][32526]That's why... I never left the...
[32536][32582]You never left that tower.
[32594][32621]And you're still gonna go back?
[32621][32651]No... yes.
[32662][32699]It's complicated.
[32791][32821]So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?
[32821][32859]Ah yeah, well. I'll spare|you the sob story of
[32859][32890]poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it's|a little bit of a...
[32890][32940]It's a little bit of a downer.
[32969][32986]There was this book.
[32986][33011]A book I used to read every|night to all the younger kids.
[33011][33030]The tales of Flynnigan Ryder.
[33030][33058]Swashbuckling rogue,|richest man alive.
[33058][33107]Not bad with the ladies either. Nothing|to ever brag about, of course.
[33107][33123]Was he a thief too?
[33123][33156]Ahh, well no.
[33159][33195]Actually, he had enough|money to do anything that he wanted to do.
[33195][33212]He could go anywhere that|he wanted to go.
[33212][33244]And... and, for a kid,|with nothing.
[33244][33274]I don't know, I...
[33274][33296]It just seemed like a better option.
[33296][33324]You can't tell anyone,|about this, okay?
[33324][33352]It could ruin my whole reputation.
[33352][33378]Ahh, we wouldn't want that.
[33378][33456]Oh, the thing about a reputation,|it's all that a man has.
[33479][33516]Um, well I should uh...
[33516][33550]I, I should get some|more firewood.
[33550][33571]Hey.
[33571][33643]For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert|much better than, Flynn Ryder.
[33643][33679]Well, then you'd be the first.
[33679][33714]But, thank you.
[33780][33813]Well, I thought he'd never leave.
[33813][33826]Mother?
[33826][33846]Hello, dear.
[33846][33869]But I... I..., don't we...
[33869][33888]How did you find me?
[33888][33907]Oh, it was easy really.
[33907][33976]I just listened for the sound of complete|and utter betrayal, and followed that.
[33976][33998]- Mother...|- We're going home, Rapunzel.
[33998][34022]- Now.|- You... You don't understand.
[34022][34040]I've been on this incredible journey.
[34040][34073]And I've seen and learned so much.
[34073][34090]I even met someone.
[34090][34114]Yes, the wanted thief.|I'm so proud.
[34114][34138]- Come on, Rapunzel.|- Mother, wait.
[34138][34164]I think
[34164][34185]I think he likes me.
[34185][34211]Likes you? Please, Rapunzel,|that's demented.
[34211][34253]- But mother, I...|- This is why you never should have left.
[34253][34284]Dear this whole romance that|you've invented,
[34284][34332]just proves you're to naive to be here.
[34332][34370]Why would he like you?|Oh come on now, really.
[34370][34406]Look at you, you think|that he's impressed?
[34406][34450]Don't be a dummy, come with mommy.
[34450][34461]/Mother...
[34461][34492]- NO!|- No?
[34510][34524]Oh.
[34524][34560]I see how it is.
[34570][34591]/Rapunzel, knows best.
[34591][34609]/Rapunzel's so mature, now.
[34609][34636]/Such a clever grown up, miss.
[34636][34660]/Rapunzel knows best.
[34660][34681]/Fine, if you're so sure now.
[34681][34705]/Go ahead then give him, THIS!
[34705][34717]How did you?
[34717][34736]/This is why he's here.
[34736][34749]/Don't let him deceive you.
[34749][34784]/Give it to him, watch, you'll see.|/- I will.
[34784][34820]/Trust me my dear, that's|/how fast he'll leave you.
[34820][34859]/I won't say I told you so... no.
[34859][34881]/Rapunzel knows best.
[34881][34898]/So if he's such a dream boat.
[34898][34937]/Go and put him, to the test.|/- Mother, wait.
[34937][34992]/If he's lying, don't come|/crying.
[34995][35035]/Mother, knows best.
[35106][35151]So, hey uh, can I ask you something?
[35151][35186]Is there any chance that I'm going|to get super strength in my hand?
[35186][35230]Because I'm not going to lie.|That would be stupendous.
[35230][35251]Hey, you all right?
[35251][35274]Oh, sorry, yes.
[35274][35328]Just um, lost in thought,|I guess.
[35329][35350]I mean because here's the thing.
[35350][35370]Superhuman good looks,|I've always had 'em.
[35370][35398]Born with it, but superhuman strength?
[35398][35464]Can you imagine the|possibilities, I'm just...
[35471][35540]Patience boys. All good things|to those who wait.
[35685][35715]Hmm, what?
[35728][35761]Well I hope you're|here to apologize.
[35761][35788]AAAAAAAH!
[35788][35843]No, no put me down.|Stop it. Let... me... go!
[35843][35884]- Give me, him.|- OW!
[35947][35957]Whoa!
[35957][35975]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[35975][36021]Easy boy, easy,|calm down.
[36021][36042]Easy boy.
[36042][36067]Easy.
[36072][36102]That's it.
[36125][36150]Now sit.
[36150][36170]- Sit.|- What?
[36170][36191]Now drop the boot.
[36191][36219]Drop it.
[36224][36256]Oh, you are such a good boy.
[36256][36288]Yes you are.
[36296][36331]You all tired, from chasing the bad|man all over the place?
[36331][36343]Excuse me?
[36343][36372]Nobody appreciates|you, do they?
[36372][36382]Do they?
[36382][36408]Oh come on, he's a bad horse.
[36408][36433]Oh, he's nothing but|a big sweetheart.
[36433][36462]Isn't that right?
[36462][36484]Maximus.
[36484][36506]You've got to be|kidding me.
[36506][36556]Look, today is kinda the|biggest day of my life.
[36556][36603]And the thing is, I need you|not to get him arrested.
[36603][36628]Just for twenty four hours and then,
[36628][36650]you can chase each other to|your hearts content.
[36650][36675]Okay?
[36703][36767]And it's also my birthday.|Just so you know.
[36868][36894]OOMPH!
[36932][36955]WOW
[37239][37258]Ahh!
[37258][37284]Sorry.
[37504][37534]Thank you.
[37672][37719]It's for the lost Princess.
[38477][38509]To the boats
[38605][38634]Hey, Max.
[38652][38693]What? I brought them.
[38709][38739]Most of them.
[38739][38755]Where are we going?
[38755][38778]Well, best day of your life.
[38778][38838]I figured you should have|a decent seat.
[38977][39005]You okay?
[39005][39026]I'm terrified.
[39026][39046]Why?
[39046][39089]I've been looking out the|window for eighteen years.
[39089][39153]Dreaming about what it would feel|like when those lights rise in the sky.
[39153][39213]What if it's not everything|that I dreamed it would be?
[39213][39243]It will be.
[39243][39275]And what if it is?
[39275][39294]What will I do then?
[39294][39320]Well that's the good part,|I guess.
[39320][39371]You get to go find a new dream.
[39566][39599]/Solemn Music
[40272][40334]/All those days|/Watching from the windows.
[40334][40383]/All those years|/Outside looking in
[40383][40434]/All that time|/Never even knowing
[40434][40493]/Just how blind I've been|/Now I'm here
[40504][40554]/Blinking in the starlight|/Now I'm here
[40554][40603]/Suddenly I see|/Standing here
[40603][40668]/It's oh, so clear|/I'm where I'm meant to be
[40674][40757]/And at last, I see the light|/And it's like the fog has lifted
[40766][40845]/And at last, I see the light|/And it's like the sky is new
[40856][40945]/And it's warm and real and bright|/And the world has somehow shifted
[40991][41039]/All at once|/Everything looks different
[41039][41078]/Now that I see you
[41147][41171]I have something for you, too.
[41171][41208]I should have given it to you|before, but I was just scared.
[41208][41245]And the thing is,|I'm not scared anymore.
[41245][41260]You know what I mean?
[41260][41296]I'm starting to.
[41333][41383]/All those days|/Chasing down a daydream
[41383][41426]/All those years|/Living in a blur
[41426][41478]/All that time|/Never truly seeing
[41478][41540]/Things, the way they were|/Now she's here
[41546][41594]/Shining in the starlight|/Now she's here
[41594][41640]/Suddenly I know|/If she's here
[41640][41706]/It's crystal clear|/I'm where I'm meant to go
[41709][41754]/And at last, I see the light
[41754][41794]/And it's like the fog has lifted
[41794][41839]/And at last, I see the light
[41839][41882]/And it's like the sky is new
[41882][41971]/And it's warm and real and bright|/And the world has somehow shifted
[42016][42067]/All at once|/Everything is different
[42067][42108]/Now that I, see you.
[42158][42201]/Now that I... see you.
[42420][42447]Is everything okay?
[42447][42476]Huh? Oh yes.
[42476][42498]Uh, yes of course.
[42498][42527]I just...
[42574][42602]I'm sorry, everything is fine.
[42602][42648]There's just something I|have to take care of.
[42648][42673]Okay.
[42677][42716]I'll be right back.
[42757][42800]It's all right, Pascal.
[42854][42869]Ahh, there you are.
[42869][42901]I've been searching everywhere for|you guys. Since we got separated.
[42901][42942]Hey the sideburns are coming|in nice, huh?
[42942][42994]You gotta be excited about that.
[42995][42995]Anyhow, just wanted to say,
[42995][43024]I shouldn't have split.|The crown is all yours.
[43024][43078]I'll miss you, but I think|its for the... best.
[43078][43115]Holding out on us again?|Hey, Ryder?
[43115][43145]- What?|- We heard you found something.
[43145][43181]Something much more valuable|than a crown.
[43181][43222]We want her, instead.
[43304][43387]I was starting to think you|ran off with the crown and left me.
[43415][43439]He did.
[43439][43462]What?|No.
[43462][43480]He wouldn't.
[43480][43517]See for yourself.
[43543][43570]Eugene?
[43583][43610]Eugene!
[43622][43639]Fair trade.
[43639][43675]A crown, for the girl|with the magic hair.
[43675][43725]How much do you think someone|will pay to stay young and healthy forever?
[43725][43744]No, please.
[43744][43760]NO!
[43760][43783]NO!
[43805][43829]AHH!
[43854][43882]Rapunzel!
[43882][43909]Mother?
[43942][43969]Oh, my precious girl.
[43969][43992]Mother.
[43992][44007]Are you all right?
[44007][44021]Are you hurt?
[44021][44055]- Mother, how did you?|- I was so worried about you dear.
[44055][44070]So I followed you.
[44070][44088]And I saw them attack you.
[44088][44158]All right, let's go, let's go|before they come to.
[44417][44434]You were right, mother.
[44434][44470]You were right about everything.
[44470][44503]I know darling.
[44503][44530]I know.
[44642][44661]Look!
[44661][44679]The crown.
[44679][44699]Rapunzel.
[44699][44728]RAPUNZEL!
[44744][44788]No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.|Guys, guys.
[44788][44817]Rapunzel!
[45001][45042]Let's get this over with, Ryder.
[45042][45081]Where are we going?
[45091][45116]Oh...
[45136][45181]There, it never happened.
[45187][45208]Now, wash up for dinner.
[45208][45254]I'm making hazel nut soup.
[45279][45310]I really did try, Rapunzel.
[45310][45341]I tried to warn you,|what was out there.
[45341][45372]The world is dark, and selfish,
[45372][45384]and cruel.
[45384][45416]If it finds even the slightest|ray of sunshine.
[45416][45451]It destroys it.
[46463][46483]How did you know about her?
[46483][46494]Tell me, now!
[46494][46507]It wasn't us.
[46507][46522]It was the old lady.
[46522][46551]Old lady?
[46557][46573]Wait, no, wait!
[46573][46591]You don't understand,|she's in trouble.
[46591][46603]Wait!
[46603][46632]Rapunzel?
[46633][46688]Rapunzel, what's going on up there?
[46691][46723]Are you all right?
[46723][46743]I'm the lost princess.
[46743][46780]Oh, please, speak up, Rapunzel.|You know how I hate the mumbling.
[46780][46806]I am the lost Princess.
[46806][46835]Aren't I?
[46852][46881]Did I mumble, Mother?
[46881][46921]Or should I even call you that?
[46921][46950]Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?
[46950][46977]Why would you ask such|a ridiculous question?
[46977][47025]It was you!|It was all, you.
[47031][47083]Everything I did, was to protect you.
[47083][47115]- Rapunzel.|- I spent my entire life,
[47115][47145]Hiding from people who|would use me for my power.
[47145][47169]- Rapunzel!|- And I should have been hiding.
[47169][47180]From you.
[47180][47192]Where will you go?
[47192][47212]He won't be there for you.
[47212][47230]What did you do to him?
[47230][47271]That criminal, is to|be hanged for his crimes.
[47271][47307]- No.|- Now, now. It's all right.
[47307][47318]Listen to me.
[47318][47353]All of this is as|it should be.
[47353][47371]NO!
[47371][47397]You were wrong about the world.
[47397][47420]And you were wrong about me.
[47420][47484]And I will never let you|use my hair, again!
[47558][47575]You want me to be the bad guy?
[47575][47594]Fine.
[47594][47635]Now I'm the bad, guy.
[47760][47777]What's this?
[47777][47802]Open up.
[47802][47820]What's the password?
[47820][47838]- What?|- Nope.
[47838][47854]Open this door.
[47854][47873]Not even close.
[47873][47885]You have three seconds
[47885][47911]One...
[47911][47937]Two...
[47940][47968]Three...
[48002][48051]Frying pans.|Who knew, right?
[48065][48091]AAAAH!
[48325][48338]- Head down?|- Head down.
[48338][48349]- Arms in?|- Arms in.
[48349][48360]- Knees apart?|- Knees apart.
[48360][48376]Knees apart?
[48376][48413]Why do I need to keep my|knees apar...
[48413][48443]AAAAAAAAH!
[48475][48489]Max.
[48489][48531]You brought them here?
[48531][48557]Thank you.
[48557][48583]No really, thank you.
[48583][48640]Uh, I feel maybe this whole time|we've just misunderstanding one another.
[48640][48713]And we're really just, yeah|your right. We should go.
[48749][48765]Max.
[48765][48789]Max!
[48806][48835]WHOAAAAA!
[48892][48952]Okay Max, lets see how|fast you can run.
[49115][49144]Rapunzel.
[49148][49197]Rapunzel, let down your hair.
[49324][49388]Rapunzel, I thought I'd never|see you again.
[49437][49465]Now look what you've done,|Rapunzel.
[49465][49482]Oh don't worry, dear.
[49482][49520]Our secret will die with him.
[49520][49554]And as for us?
[49555][49627]We are going where no one|will ever find you, again.
[49666][49701]Rapunzel, really.|Enough all ready.
[49701][49726]Stop fighting me.
[49726][49750]NO! I won't stop.
[49750][49787]For every minute of the rest|of my life I will fight.
[49787][49847]I will never stop trying|to get away from you.
[49847][49874]But, if you let me save him...
[49874][49897]I will go with you.
[49897][49933]No. No, Rapunzel.
[49933][49970]I'll never run, I'll never|try to escape.
[49970][50008]Just let me heal him. And|you and I will be together.
[50008][50026]Forever, just like you want.
[50026][50058]Everything will be|the way it was.
[50058][50082]I promise.
[50082][50121]Just like you want.
[50130][50177]Just... let me... heal him.
[50222][50268]In case you get any ideas|about following us.
[50268][50299]Eu..Eugene!
[50302][50331]Ah, AHHH!
[50339][50366]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[50366][50392]- Everything is going to okay, though.|- No, Rapunzel!
[50392][50416]- I promise, you have to trust me.|- No..
[50416][50443]- Come on.|- I can't let you do this.
[50443][50469]And I can't let you die.
[50469][50496]- But if you do this.|- Shhh.
[50496][50531]- Then you... will die.|- Hey.
[50531][50575]It's gonna be all right.
[50601][50638]Rapunzel, wait...
[50724][50745]Eugene, what...?
[50745][50770]NOOO!
[50809][50838]No... NO!
[50843][50902]What have you done?|WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!
[50946][50982]No, no, no,|NOOO!
[50982][51020]No, no, no, noooo.
[51039][51060]NO!
[51060][51092]Noooooooooo!
[51261][51304]No, no, no, no, Eugene.
[51314][51339]Oh, look at me, look me,|I'm right here.
[51339][51359]Don't go, stay with me, Eugene.
[51359][51393]/Flower gleam and glow,|/Let your powers shine
[51393][51431]/Make the clock reverse,|/bring back what once was mine.
[51431][51472]- Rapunzel...|- What?
[51482][51524]You were my new dream.
[51535][51573]And you were mine.
[51819][51864]/Heal what has been hurt.
[51865][51910]/Change the fates design.
[51917][51962]/Save what has been lost.
[51975][52026]/Bring back what once was mine.
[52034][52073]What once was mine.
[52624][52653]Rapunzel?
[52654][52681]Eugene.
[52685][52757]Did I ever tell you, I've|got a thing for brunettes?
[53746][53804]/Well, you could imagine what|/happened next.
[53804][53823]/The kingdom rejoiced.
[53823][53841]/For the lost Princess had returned.
[53841][53863]/The party lasted an entire week.
[53863][53898]/And, honestly I don't|/remember much of it.
[53898][53915]/Dreams came true|/all over the place.
[53915][53983]/That guy went on to become the most famous concert|/pianist in the world, if you can believe it.
[53983][54027]/And this guy? Well he eventually|/found true love.
[54027][54051]/As for this guy, well,|/I assume he's happy.
[54051][54088]/He's never told me otherwise.
[54088][54146]/Thanks to Maximus, crime in the kingdom|/disappeared almost over night.
[54146][54186]/As did most of the apples.
[54186][54230]/Pascal?|/Never changed.
[54254][54278]/At last Rapunzel was home,
