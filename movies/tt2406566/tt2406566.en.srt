00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,043
<i>East and West...</i>

3
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:50,980
<i>...do not mistrust each other
because we're armed.</i>

4
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,285
<i>We're armed because we mistrust each other.</i>

5
00:00:55,365 --> 00:00:56,953
<i>Mr. Gorbachev...</i>

6
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:59,965
...tear down this wall.

7
00:02:10,273 --> 00:02:13,029
James fucking Gascoigne.

8
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:14,932
How did you find me?

9
00:02:15,612 --> 00:02:19,302
Maybe you're not as good
at this spy shit as you think.

10
00:02:20,282 --> 00:02:23,998
It was Satchel, wasn't it?
Satchel gave me up.

11
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,781
I always thought, if I got tagged,
it would be by the best.

12
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:35,148
But you're not the best, are you, Bakhtin?

13
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,553
You're the biggest fucking cunt in the KGB.

14
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:43,938
Sticks and stones, Jimmy.

15
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:14,756
That's a nasty black eye.

16
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:17,127
Where's C?

17
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:21,096
Given the scale of recent world events,
C will not be joining us.

18
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:25,899
Yes, of course.

19
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,679
The voices on record are the following...

20
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,928
...myself, Senior Directorate
Officer Eric Gray...

21
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:44,806
...our American guest, Emmett Kurzfeld
of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency...

22
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:47,618
...and returning British Operational
Officer Lorraine Broughton.

23
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:51,161
Before we begin, sir, may I formally
request that Mr. Kurzfeld be removed...

24
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:53,396
- ...from the debriefing.
- Request denied.

25
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:55,598
What I have to tell you, sir,
is not for the CIA to hear.

26
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:58,714
Lorraine, you are the subject
of this debriefing, not...

27
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:02,218
- I understand that.
- I was there, in Berlin.

28
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:06,709
And I'm here with the full
executive authority of Langley.

29
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:11,013
If it'd make you more comfortable, I could
stand behind the mirror with everybody else.

30
00:08:11,193 --> 00:08:13,847
But it's a little crowded back there.

31
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:17,733
Cocksucker.

32
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:19,622
What did you say?

33
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:24,117
- I didn't say anything.
- I'm sorry. Did you say something, Lorraine?

34
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:26,491
- Did you hear me say something?
- I thought you said something.

35
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,398
What did she say?

36
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:30,497
What?

37
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:33,836
Well...

38
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,430
...do you want to play the tape back?

39
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:46,196
Well, then...

40
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,651
...shall we begin?

41
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,838
Berlin.

42
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:57,577
- What happened?
- Yeah.

43
00:08:58,157 --> 00:08:59,743
Berlin.

44
00:09:04,097 --> 00:09:05,736
Fuck.

45
00:09:14,406 --> 00:09:17,420
Lorraine. Sorry to bring you in
on such short notice.

46
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,680
- You know C.
- Yes.

47
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,571
We were just going over your file.
I see your Russian is excellent.

48
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:27,007
An expert in escape and evasion.

49
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:30,742
Proficient in intelligence collection
and hand-to-hand combat.

50
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:32,913
It's an impressive set of skills.

51
00:09:32,993 --> 00:09:37,218
Knowing the Reds as I do, she'll need
to use every damn one of them.

52
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:40,487
I'll get straight to the point.

53
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,154
How well do you know James Gascoigne?

54
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,678
Enough to say hello.
We worked together in Istanbul in '85.

55
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:48,559
He's dead.

56
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,766
Gascoigne was killed last night
on a mission in Berlin.

57
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:58,404
The West German Police fished his body
out of the Spree this morning.

58
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:02,295
And the coroner extracted
a 7.62 Tokarev round...

59
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,912
- ...from the base of his skull.
- Soviets.

60
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:10,097
Yesterday, Gascoigne met with
a Stasi officer, code-named Spyglass.

61
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:14,253
We promised Spyglass immunity in
exchange for a document on microfilm...

62
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,908
- ...code-named "the list."
- Hidden in a Swiss watch, no less.

63
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:23,033
The list contains every active clandestine
officer, all their shady deals.

64
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:26,058
It's an atomic bomb of information
that could extend the Cold War...

65
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:28,010
...for another 40 years.

66
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:31,905
And we believe the man
that killed Gascoigne now has it.

67
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:36,108
Our sources point to Yuri Bakhtin...

68
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:40,346
...a KGB hatchet man with more
than a dozen confirmed kills.

69
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:44,483
- So you want me in Moscow?
- No. Bakhtin never got on the flight.

70
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:47,377
So he's still in Berlin, along with the list.

71
00:10:49,202 --> 00:10:52,058
Everyone's hunting for it.
The Yanks, the Frogs.

72
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:54,695
- Soviets, of course.
- And our man, Percival.

73
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:58,030
- Who's Percival?
- David Percival.

74
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,163
He's our number one in Berlin.

75
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:03,048
He's your point of contact now.

76
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:18,716
Straight from the tit of the Virgin Mary.

77
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:38,939
- The Jordache wasn't easy.
- It's for my wife's birthday.

78
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:42,075
That's really nice.
Now, where's that fucking list?

79
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:44,288
I gave the microfilm to Gascoigne last night.

80
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:48,485
- James didn't show up.
- I did my part. I gave him the list.

81
00:11:48,565 --> 00:11:52,519
You have to get me and my family across.
It's not safe for us anymore here.

82
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:55,795
- The Russians are onto me.
- No list, no deal.

83
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,727
- I risked everything.
- No list, no deal. You listen to me, Spyglass.

84
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:05,065
Without that list, why shouldn't I take you
outside and shoot you in the fucking head?

85
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:09,441
- You are going to kill a Stasi officer?
- One that's about to defect to the West? Yeah.

86
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:14,186
Without an embassy to look after him,
Percival has gone somewhat native.

87
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,811
Gone fucking feral. Berlin is the Wild West.

88
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:21,314
If that bloody wall comes crashing down,
we don't want to be under it.

89
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:25,483
If the Russians get that list,
we're all buggered sideways.

90
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:28,754
You're Elizabeth Lloyd.

91
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,892
A Cambridge-educated lawyer
sent by James Gascoigne's family...

92
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:35,162
...to retrieve the body and effects
of their recently deceased son.

93
00:12:35,242 --> 00:12:39,865
Your mission is to connect with Percival and
do whatever it takes to get that list home.

94
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:42,956
And remember, Lorraine,
this is highly sensitive.

95
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:45,490
Trust no one.

96
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:52,826
Follow me! Come, come, come!

97
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:54,933
Quickly! This way.

98
00:12:55,013 --> 00:12:57,301
- Tell me you made a copy.
- I memorized it.

99
00:12:57,381 --> 00:12:59,853
Memorized it?
Every single agent on that list?

100
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:03,015
Every Wednesday, you visit the Penny Lane
brothel. Your favorite girl is Margot.

101
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:06,926
- Her real name is Maria.
- Maria?

102
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,377
- All right, I'll get you across.
- You're a good man, Percival.

103
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:12,769
Fuck off. I just want the list.
Once I've... Oh, fuck.

104
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:14,666
- Halt!
- I'll be in touch.

105
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,638
Document. Document. Oh, gee...

106
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:43,220
Oh, I'm so fucking late.

107
00:14:57,616 --> 00:15:01,105
<i>Welcome to Tempelhof International Airport.</i>

108
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:29,468
Miss Broughton,
Mr. Percival was running late.

109
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:31,504
He sent me to pick you up.

110
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:34,406
- Checked bags?
- No, they've been sent.

111
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:36,391
Please, follow me.

112
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,271
So... is this your first time in Berlin?

113
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:06,805
Yes.

114
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:09,106
Well, it's a remarkable time to be here.

115
00:16:11,123 --> 00:16:14,881
Wonderful music, superb nightlife,
marvelous restaurants.

116
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:17,750
You must try the Central Cafe for a drink.

117
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,517
You'll need it later.

118
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:27,982
You remember Mr. Bremovych, don't you?

119
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:34,165
Of course you do.

120
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:39,702
Well, he's very curious
what you're doing here in Berlin.

121
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,510
What the fuck are you doing?

122
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,534
What the fuck are you doing?

123
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:44,935
Welcome to Berlin. I'm David...

124
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:49,706
- Where the fuck were you?
- Don't shoot. I've got your shoe.

125
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,612
Let me help you with your bags.

126
00:17:57,313 --> 00:17:59,085
Come on.

127
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:02,622
- Fuck's sake.
- Russians are fucking heavy.

128
00:18:03,302 --> 00:18:05,349
Five minutes on the ground,
and I'm already made.

129
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:08,054
- You're not made, I hope.
- They knew my name.

130
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:09,360
- That's troubling.
- And yours.

131
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,261
That's hardly surprising.

132
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,766
Great fucking start, Percival.

133
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:25,472
So, what was your first impression?

134
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:28,200
Of David? Well...

135
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:32,633
...he was handsome. Late 30s.

136
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:36,755
Disastrous Sinead O'Connor hair.

137
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:38,191
Irish singer.

138
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:41,805
I asked him what the deal
was with that, and he said...

139
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:44,282
"It's to blend in."

140
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:48,098
Want to touch it?
It's to blend in, in the East.

141
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,291
That was the Brandenburg Gate,
by the way. I mean, how the fuck...

142
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:59,145
...do the suits think that you're going
to be able to help me find that list?

143
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,809
As soon as you pick up Gascoigne's body,
they'll null and void your visa...

144
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:05,001
- ...and you'll be on the first flight back home.
- I'll figure it out.

145
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:07,954
That's Checkpoint Charlie.
My office is just back there.

146
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:10,789
I'm not here to collect postcards, Percival.

147
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:13,125
Just drop me at my hotel.
It's around the corner.

148
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:15,627
I thought you said you'd
never been to Berlin before.

149
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:17,429
I can read a fucking map.

150
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:19,797
This will just take a minute.

151
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:32,275
- What are you doing?
- Sending a message to that fascist pig.

152
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:39,916
Say hello to Comrade Bremovych for me.

153
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:56,532
Bremovych...

154
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:17,709
<i>Tensions are high in East Berlin tonight...</i>

155
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:20,480
<i>...as civil disobedience
continues to build momentum.</i>

156
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,984
<i>East Berlin's youth leaders shout out their
protests through tear gas and water cannons.</i>

157
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:29,886
<i>And there are numerous reports of police
beating peaceful demonstrators with batons.</i>

158
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:06,592
<i>I've been sent to arrange
the return of a British subject.</i>

159
00:23:06,672 --> 00:23:09,095
The body was identified by your attaché.

160
00:23:09,175 --> 00:23:10,929
Yes, I believe so.

161
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:14,083
This was not a question. It was a statement.

162
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:23,776
- He was your colleague?
- Different department.

163
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:26,157
- Which department?
- A different one.

164
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:30,881
You have the transfer papers?

165
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:48,501
<i>You know those movies where
the picture just starts to slow down...</i>

166
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:51,267
<i>...and melt?</i>

167
00:23:51,884 --> 00:23:53,703
Then catch fire?

168
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:57,808
Well...

169
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,445
...that's Berlin.

170
00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:05,150
<i>The passport number is incorrect.</i>

171
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,886
<i>I will not release this body
without the correct information.</i>

172
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:09,554
<i>It's a simple mistake.</i>

173
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:13,057
<i>Miss Lloyd, in Germany,
we don't make simple mistakes.</i>

174
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:11,433
I'm not going to lie, I'm impressed.

175
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:14,520
You've got some balls breaking in here.

176
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,617
You should see my balls.
Then you'd be really impressed.

177
00:25:17,697 --> 00:25:21,059
- I'll take your word for it.
- I see you found a way to stay.

178
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:23,695
You wrote "16" when it should have said "76."

179
00:25:23,775 --> 00:25:26,999
That's right. I'm not going anywhere.

180
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:30,636
- I'm here for at least another week.
- Lucky fucking me.

181
00:25:31,316 --> 00:25:34,606
They won't release the body now until
they've investigated that red-tape nightmare.

182
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:36,842
How the fuck did you get in here?

183
00:25:36,922 --> 00:25:40,112
You know, I've been in Berlin a long time,
and I think I know every doorman...

184
00:25:40,192 --> 00:25:44,583
...of every decent shithouse,
borderline decent flophouse...

185
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:46,284
...both sides of the wall.

186
00:25:46,364 --> 00:25:48,818
Well, then you must know Spyglass.

187
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:52,057
Never met the fellow.

188
00:25:52,137 --> 00:25:53,856
He was James's.

189
00:25:55,706 --> 00:25:59,395
What do you know about this woman
who's been following me since Tempelhof?

190
00:26:00,913 --> 00:26:04,336
I'd say that you're an attractive woman...

191
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,636
...and you should do the math.

192
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:13,443
You know, if I was to follow you, I mean,
properly, you'd never fucking know.

193
00:26:14,694 --> 00:26:17,183
There's a knack to it, isn't there?

194
00:26:17,263 --> 00:26:19,986
It's like walking a tightrope
or playing the bagpipes.

195
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:22,953
You can either do it or you can't.

196
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:26,755
Knock yourself out.

197
00:26:52,732 --> 00:26:54,655
I'd like to purchase a watch.

198
00:26:56,101 --> 00:26:59,722
I need access to a network in East Berlin.

199
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:04,193
<i>Come back tomorrow before closing.</i>

200
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:08,300
<i>East Berlin is on
a short fuse again tonight...</i>

201
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,579
<i>...as Communist Party officials
struggle to maintain order.</i>

202
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:16,274
- <i>How well do you know James Gascoigne?</i>
- <i>He's dead.</i>

203
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:18,474
- You need to be careful.
- <i>The coroner extracted a 7.62...</i>

204
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,413
<i>...Tokarev round from the base of his skull.</i>

205
00:27:21,493 --> 00:27:25,182
- <i>Soviets.</i>
- <i>We know who Satchel is.</i>

206
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:28,318
<i>You need to run.</i>

207
00:28:38,304 --> 00:28:41,389
<i>You expected to find the list
in Gascoigne's apartment.</i>

208
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,988
You realize you were late to the party.

209
00:28:44,068 --> 00:28:48,032
<i>Percival, the Russians... everybody
must have already ransacked the place.</i>

210
00:28:48,112 --> 00:28:49,268
<i>Yes.</i>

211
00:28:50,248 --> 00:28:53,139
But the list wasn't our only problem.

212
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:57,307
Before I left, he told me one last thing.

213
00:28:59,732 --> 00:29:03,946
This is exactly why
I didn't want the CIA present.

214
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,721
Spyglass revealed that this list...

215
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:12,872
...would expose a double agent
by the name of Satchel.

216
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:16,496
I want Satchel, dead or alive.

217
00:29:17,076 --> 00:29:20,168
This traitor has been
a thorn in our side for years.

218
00:29:20,248 --> 00:29:22,501
He's a black eye to the Crown.

219
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:26,508
And the single biggest
intelligence leak in MI6 history.

220
00:29:26,588 --> 00:29:29,991
You expose this bastard, Satchel...

221
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:32,712
...and we'll hang him for treason.

222
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:37,066
You might find yourself
taking tea at Buckingham Palace.

223
00:29:37,996 --> 00:29:39,423
<i>So no...</i>

224
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:43,119
...I wasn't just looking for the list
in Gascoigne's apartment.

225
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:08,803
<i>Percival and I seem to have
a different definition for collaboration.</i>

226
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:12,904
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

227
00:30:12,984 --> 00:30:16,689
He was the only one who knew
I was going to Gascoigne's apartment.

228
00:30:17,469 --> 00:30:21,174
And if I knew he was going to call the
police, I would've worn a different outfit.

229
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,566
Different outfit?

230
00:32:19,657 --> 00:32:21,743
Hey! Halt!

231
00:32:49,974 --> 00:32:52,110
<i>With repeated calls
for change on the streets...</i>

232
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,512
<i>...and the protesters growing
ever more confident...</i>

233
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:57,483
<i>...time is running out
for the East German government.</i>

234
00:32:57,563 --> 00:33:01,052
<i>Popular opinion has it that the
Communists' claim to leadership...</i>

235
00:33:01,132 --> 00:33:02,954
<i>...can't be upheld much longer.</i>

236
00:33:03,034 --> 00:33:07,293
<i>And if rapid change is not forthcoming,
today's relatively calm protests...</i>

237
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:10,429
<i>...could be seen as the calm
before the storm.</i>

238
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:14,199
<i>It's not just new faces
that are called for...</i>

239
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:17,325
<i>...but perhaps a complete
demolition of the wall.</i>

240
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:46,629
Let me take your coat.

241
00:33:54,352 --> 00:33:56,238
Make yourself at home.

242
00:34:03,595 --> 00:34:05,449
Fucking hell.

243
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:10,653
You want a pair of jeans? Help yourself.

244
00:34:23,883 --> 00:34:26,570
Your library includes Larry Flynt?

245
00:34:27,685 --> 00:34:29,579
Champion of free speech.

246
00:34:34,426 --> 00:34:36,413
What have you found on Bakhtin?

247
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:41,053
If Bakhtin wanted the Russians to have that
list, he would've given it to them by now.

248
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:43,888
We just have to wait
for him to make his move.

249
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:46,725
We can't afford to wait.
This is your city, Percival.

250
00:34:46,805 --> 00:34:50,227
Or do you only know doormen and bellhops?

251
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,735
So, what did you find
in Gascoigne's apartment?

252
00:34:57,815 --> 00:34:59,971
Some Deutsche Marks...

253
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:02,474
...empty passports, travel visas...

254
00:35:02,554 --> 00:35:06,443
...and a picture of the two of you
together a few years back.

255
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:12,783
Did I not mention that we were friends?

256
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:15,918
- No.
- No? No, I must have forgot to.

257
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:22,861
Get your coat, love.

258
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:24,760
We're going for a walk.

259
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:34,202
Look, we're all exposed by that list.

260
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,063
And saving the world is cool and all that,
but my main objective is staying alive.

261
00:35:39,143 --> 00:35:40,712
I've been head
of Berlin Station for 10 years.

262
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:43,949
You've got to know that I'm the only man
in this town that can help you get that list.

263
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:48,018
Yes, I've read your file.
I've also read your dog file.

264
00:35:48,098 --> 00:35:50,504
So let's cut the crap, shall we?

265
00:35:50,968 --> 00:35:54,590
This whole hungover, show-up-late,
don't-know-which-way-is-up act...

266
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,627
...I'm not buying it.

267
00:35:56,707 --> 00:35:59,731
I trust you about as far as I can throw you.

268
00:35:59,811 --> 00:36:02,134
"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."

269
00:36:02,214 --> 00:36:04,267
Niccolo Machiavelli.

270
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:09,840
- It was on your shelf.
- Oh, my God, I think I fucking love you.

271
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,807
That's too bad.

272
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:16,548
If Percival was telling
the truth about Bakhtin...

273
00:36:16,628 --> 00:36:19,516
...I needed to figure out
what the Russians knew.

274
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:58,620
Stoli on ice.

275
00:37:26,165 --> 00:37:28,453
I'm not speaking German tonight.

276
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:31,386
So, you're British?

277
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:38,394
Very impressive.

278
00:37:39,477 --> 00:37:41,764
This can't be your only talent.

279
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:45,414
Talents can be overrated.

280
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,838
A dedication...

281
00:37:47,918 --> 00:37:50,534
...a loyalty is very rare these days.

282
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:59,816
Everyone here is searching for something.

283
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:03,105
What are you looking for?

284
00:38:03,735 --> 00:38:06,725
Well, when all's said and done,
wouldn't you say deep down...

285
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:10,027
...we're all just searching
for the same thing?

286
00:38:17,181 --> 00:38:20,725
I leave you alone for only a moment,
and already you are attracting admirers.

287
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:24,608
<i>Monsieur</i>, three is not always a crowd...

288
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:27,108
...but tonight it is.

289
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:29,729
French women.

290
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:33,731
What about the British?

291
00:38:34,331 --> 00:38:37,419
Maybe we could make
some sort of arrangement.

292
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:43,408
We haven't seen each other in a long time,
and we really need to catch up.

293
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:46,331
Alone.

294
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:50,212
Ladies, Berlin is a small place.

295
00:38:50,682 --> 00:38:53,336
I'm sure our paths will cross again.

296
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:08,018
Sorry. You looked like you needed saving.

297
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:13,092
Well, I appreciate the gesture, Miss...

298
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:15,961
Lasalle. Delphine Lasalle.

299
00:39:16,741 --> 00:39:18,561
Pleased to meet you.

300
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:22,901
So, what do you do, Delphine?

301
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:25,904
I'm a part-time translator
who really wants to be a poet.

302
00:39:25,984 --> 00:39:27,757
Maybe a rock star.

303
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:36,203
My friend owns a club nearby.
Want to come check it out?

304
00:39:36,283 --> 00:39:38,747
- Now?
- Sure.

305
00:39:39,598 --> 00:39:41,452
I can't.

306
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:44,760
Well, I'll give you the address anyway.

307
00:39:45,185 --> 00:39:47,240
Come meet me there tomorrow night?

308
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:51,794
Will you come?

309
00:39:52,627 --> 00:39:54,182
Maybe?

310
00:39:54,462 --> 00:39:56,351
You're relentless.

311
00:39:57,081 --> 00:39:58,633
<i>Oui.</i>

312
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:03,008
David Hasselhoff's in town.

313
00:40:03,088 --> 00:40:04,976
Lucky us.

314
00:40:05,556 --> 00:40:07,423
Berlin is truly doomed.

315
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,135
Your watch is ready.

316
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:33,802
It's on the counter in that plain envelope.

317
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:44,947
I think you'll find my contact very useful.

318
00:40:57,475 --> 00:40:59,319
<i>Your watch is ready.</i>

319
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:03,131
<i>It's on the counter in that plain envelope.</i>

320
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:07,354
<i>I think you'll find my contact very useful.</i>

321
00:41:09,353 --> 00:41:12,978
<i>East Berliners stormed the West
German embassies in Czechoslovakia...</i>

322
00:41:13,058 --> 00:41:16,814
<i>...earlier this week, as the Czech government
has begun to wave the refugees...</i>

323
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:19,050
<i>...through checkpoints with few questions.</i>

324
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,986
<i>One has to ask how long the East
Berlin government can hold on...</i>

325
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,794
<i>Bakhtin and the list
had not yet surfaced in the West.</i>

326
00:41:47,892 --> 00:41:52,147
<i>I needed to meet my new contact
and see what I was up against in the East.</i>

327
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:02,457
You should have applied
for a visitor's permit.

328
00:42:03,573 --> 00:42:06,595
- What kind of work do you do?
- Legal affairs.

329
00:42:15,018 --> 00:42:17,505
If you do not return before 6:00...

330
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:20,176
...you will be arrested. Do you understand?

331
00:42:21,391 --> 00:42:23,244
I understand.

332
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,856
Right now I'm not feeling very confident
about this story of yours.

333
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:36,925
Why not use Percival's
connections in the East?

334
00:42:37,776 --> 00:42:39,616
<i>He told me...</i>

335
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:42,498
<i>...to trust no one.</i>

336
00:42:46,151 --> 00:42:47,670
Hello?

337
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:52,935
Go there.

338
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:54,084
You are late.

339
00:46:54,164 --> 00:46:56,220
And you were followed.

340
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,856
I'm late because I was followed.

341
00:46:58,936 --> 00:47:02,459
I lost them 20 minutes ago
near the Palast der Republik.

342
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:04,762
You're as good as your reputation.

343
00:47:05,342 --> 00:47:07,392
Are you sure this is the best place to meet?

344
00:47:08,846 --> 00:47:10,733
Keep your enemies close.

345
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:14,402
I'm a permanent fixture for them now.

346
00:47:16,254 --> 00:47:19,744
The Watchmaker says there has
been great interest in this list...

347
00:47:19,824 --> 00:47:22,890
- ...on the black market the last few days.
- Any sign of Bakhtin?

348
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,514
No.

349
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:28,553
This Satchel character has people
worried on both sides of the wall.

350
00:47:28,633 --> 00:47:30,155
Yeah.

351
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:33,524
What kind of network have you assembled?

352
00:47:33,604 --> 00:47:36,527
There's a lot of... dissatisfied youth...

353
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,461
...on this side of the wall.

354
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:44,101
They're like a...

355
00:47:44,581 --> 00:47:46,150
...tinderbox.

356
00:47:47,384 --> 00:47:49,403
If you find the right spark...

357
00:47:51,822 --> 00:47:53,676
Keep talking.

358
00:48:31,862 --> 00:48:34,818
I am interested in selling a watch.

359
00:48:34,898 --> 00:48:36,921
What are you selling?

360
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:39,523
It is extremely valuable.

361
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:42,060
Finest quality and...

362
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,260
...filled with secrets.

363
00:48:52,717 --> 00:48:55,403
Would you mind if I inspect the merchandise?

364
00:48:57,788 --> 00:49:00,011
Fuck yes, I mind.

365
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:06,481
Just tell potential buyers
Bakhtin is open for business.

366
00:49:21,895 --> 00:49:24,930
<i>Ladies, Berlin is a small place.</i>

367
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:27,970
<i>I'm sure our paths will cross again.</i>

368
00:49:31,688 --> 00:49:35,175
<i>Sorry. You looked like you needed saving.</i>

369
00:49:36,726 --> 00:49:41,082
<i>My friend owns a club nearby.
Want to come check it out?</i>

370
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,970
I didn't think that you would show.

371
00:50:05,622 --> 00:50:07,474
Stoli on the rocks?

372
00:50:09,427 --> 00:50:11,247
You pay attention.

373
00:50:13,898 --> 00:50:16,182
I look for pleasure in the details.

374
00:50:21,873 --> 00:50:24,094
Speaking of which...

375
00:50:24,174 --> 00:50:27,060
...I have been dying to ask you a question.

376
00:50:39,457 --> 00:50:41,343
Let's go someplace quiet.

377
00:51:03,881 --> 00:51:06,545
Why the gun, Delphine?

378
00:51:08,885 --> 00:51:11,775
You're not as well-disguised
as you may think.

379
00:51:11,855 --> 00:51:15,680
I know who you are.
You're Lorraine Broughton, MI6...

380
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,980
...and you're here because
of the death of Gascoigne.

381
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:22,784
What do you know about Gascoigne?

382
00:51:25,136 --> 00:51:26,656
Nothing.

383
00:51:26,936 --> 00:51:31,030
But if someone is killing Allied officers,
shouldn't we all care?

384
00:51:34,544 --> 00:51:38,000
Whatever is in that list
has people willing to kill for it.

385
00:51:50,761 --> 00:51:53,785
This is my first assignment
with the French intelligence.

386
00:51:54,465 --> 00:51:56,485
I've only been here a year.

387
00:51:58,736 --> 00:52:02,793
I'm scared, okay?
I got into this because it was exciting.

388
00:52:03,773 --> 00:52:06,061
But it's never been like this in Berlin.

389
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:11,166
You should have become a poet.

390
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:17,406
Or a rock star.

391
00:53:16,179 --> 00:53:18,468
<i>So you made contact
with the French operative?</i>

392
00:53:18,548 --> 00:53:20,068
<i>Obviously.</i>

393
00:53:22,419 --> 00:53:23,536
<i>Why?</i>

394
00:53:23,616 --> 00:53:27,097
I believed she had information
I could exploit.

395
00:53:27,177 --> 00:53:29,012
Nothing more.

396
00:53:29,342 --> 00:53:30,675
And did she?

397
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:37,719
Did she have any information, Lorraine?

398
00:53:41,706 --> 00:53:43,926
There is something I need to tell you.

399
00:53:47,878 --> 00:53:50,733
It has to do with your friend
Percival. He's...

400
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,413
Lorraine?

401
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:09,417
Did she have any information, Lorraine?

402
00:54:13,438 --> 00:54:15,926
Did she give you information?

403
00:54:17,206 --> 00:54:18,693
She gave me nothing.

404
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:29,970
David fucking Percival.

405
00:54:33,156 --> 00:54:35,544
Are you following me?

406
00:54:35,624 --> 00:54:38,778
Maybe you're not as good
at this spy shit as you think.

407
00:54:42,966 --> 00:54:45,523
That was for James, you fucking prick.

408
00:54:45,603 --> 00:54:47,856
Now, give me that fucking list.

409
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:11,416
<i>We needed to get you a message, Lorraine.</i>

410
00:55:12,496 --> 00:55:15,359
We're several days into a mission
without a single lead.

411
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:17,455
And plenty of distractions.

412
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:20,925
You have to be reminded
of the course at hand.

413
00:55:21,005 --> 00:55:23,025
I received your message.

414
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,110
That's quite a view.

415
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:43,195
70 miles of barbed wire, 310 guard towers...

416
00:55:43,275 --> 00:55:46,249
...65 anti-vehicle trenches...

417
00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:51,355
...40,000 Soviet-trained,
heavily armed frontier troops.

418
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:53,266
All that...

419
00:55:53,764 --> 00:55:58,027
...and 5,000 GDR citizens
still had the brass balls to escape.

420
00:56:00,177 --> 00:56:04,599
You've got the MI6 so worried,
they called the CIA to talk sense into you.

421
00:56:06,984 --> 00:56:09,039
Eric Gray called me.

422
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:11,676
Of course he did.

423
00:56:11,756 --> 00:56:14,875
I don't have to remind you
of how fast the clock is ticking.

424
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:19,530
If this thing gets out,
a lot of good, hard-working folks...

425
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:22,953
...brave men and women
are going to show up dead.

426
00:56:23,433 --> 00:56:25,523
You and I included.

427
00:56:25,903 --> 00:56:29,925
I swear to God, the last few weeks,
I dread even waking up in the morning.

428
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:35,599
I understand the severity
of the situation, sir.

429
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:37,698
And the time imperative.

430
00:56:39,582 --> 00:56:43,623
Listen, I didn't climb all the way up here
just to give you some rousing pep talk.

431
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,910
So I'll cut to the chase.

432
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:49,546
Last night, you met a woman.

433
00:56:49,626 --> 00:56:53,417
Delphine Lasalle is out of her depth.

434
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:56,836
Given the climate, I'd hate to see
an executive order come down the line...

435
00:56:56,916 --> 00:56:59,124
...that falls in her disinterest.

436
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:02,327
Her disinterest?

437
00:57:03,007 --> 00:57:05,028
What do you mean, her disinterest?

438
00:57:05,108 --> 00:57:09,199
Don't insult my intelligence, Lorraine.
You know exactly what I fucking mean.

439
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:12,502
Hope you get a snapshot.

440
00:57:12,582 --> 00:57:15,437
Next week, this will be
a whole different picture.

441
00:57:24,827 --> 00:57:27,281
<i>Central has been compromised.</i>

442
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:35,918
<i>Meet me at the Rough
Trade Bar at Oranienstrasse.</i>

443
00:58:35,998 --> 00:58:37,851
<i>We need to talk.</i>

444
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:55,124
Look at all these hedonists.

445
00:58:55,204 --> 00:58:58,839
It's like a beautiful woman
gone wrong. I fucking love it.

446
00:59:00,623 --> 00:59:02,880
Word is Bakhtin has resurfaced.

447
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,182
Cops found him with a homemade lobotomy.

448
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:07,984
Either way, we have to deal with Spyglass.

449
00:59:08,064 --> 00:59:10,553
Thinking it through, he doesn't
have much time over there.

450
00:59:10,633 --> 00:59:13,441
Our priority is the list.
We can't make mistakes.

451
00:59:13,521 --> 00:59:16,594
Come on. He's hardly the most
trustworthy person I ever met.

452
00:59:16,674 --> 00:59:20,281
- Or the fucking brightest.
- Wait. You said you hadn't met him.

453
00:59:23,547 --> 00:59:25,415
I lied.

454
00:59:26,115 --> 00:59:29,937
And he claims to have
memorized the entire list.

455
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:33,510
He's ready to make the jump.

456
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,713
You believe he committed
the entire thing to memory?

457
00:59:36,793 --> 00:59:38,317
Everything.

458
00:59:39,597 --> 00:59:42,920
Had I known earlier,
I would have prioritized Spyglass.

459
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,370
His knowledge made him
as valuable as the list.

460
00:59:47,438 --> 00:59:51,429
I could have grabbed him at any moment.
Instead, Percival kept it a secret...

461
00:59:51,509 --> 00:59:53,995
...putting us in a precarious position.

462
01:00:00,984 --> 01:00:04,975
The KGB are going to have some very angry
bastards out there looking for Spyglass.

463
01:00:05,055 --> 01:00:07,644
We can't trust any of the old usual methods.

464
01:00:07,724 --> 01:00:10,181
It's not that difficult to drive
across the border these days.

465
01:00:10,261 --> 01:00:12,916
It is when you're wanted like Spyglass is.

466
01:00:13,496 --> 01:00:17,988
We have to walk him across personally
to ensure his safety in plain sight.

467
01:00:18,468 --> 01:00:20,389
We'll use the demonstration
tomorrow at Alexanderplatz.

468
01:00:20,469 --> 01:00:22,352
- That's insane.
- All those protesters...

469
01:00:22,432 --> 01:00:24,460
...will make a great distraction.

470
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:29,351
Spyglass is my guy.
We're going to do it my way.

471
01:00:31,747 --> 01:00:36,005
Fine. But we use my contact
to get all our papers in order.

472
01:00:36,475 --> 01:00:38,308
All right.

473
01:00:39,188 --> 01:00:41,274
We have a deal?

474
01:00:43,593 --> 01:00:45,414
I'll take that as a yes.

475
01:00:53,169 --> 01:00:54,973
You see...

476
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,929
...I received a call from David Percival
that evening, Lorraine.

477
01:01:08,518 --> 01:01:11,507
He said he had the list.

478
01:01:11,587 --> 01:01:14,040
I'll need a little time to wrap it up.

479
01:01:15,258 --> 01:01:17,744
<i>And he knew the identity of Satchel.</i>

480
01:01:19,896 --> 01:01:21,949
I'm very close to Satchel.

481
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,174
And no one thought to tell me?

482
01:01:54,897 --> 01:01:56,484
Fuck.

483
01:02:02,439 --> 01:02:04,526
You brought a lot of friends.

484
01:02:05,175 --> 01:02:08,030
I heard Bakhtin had a little accident.

485
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:10,933
I heard he slipped and fell on an ice pick.

486
01:02:11,013 --> 01:02:14,905
- Berlin's a cruel mistress.
- Especially for traitors like Bakhtin.

487
01:02:14,985 --> 01:02:17,607
Don't be such a fucking Communist.
You've got a problem.

488
01:02:17,687 --> 01:02:20,941
Yeah, I know. You have the fucking list.

489
01:02:22,992 --> 01:02:25,449
We've been in the trenches long enough
to know that at times like this...

490
01:02:25,529 --> 01:02:27,917
...Berlin has its own set of rules.

491
01:02:27,997 --> 01:02:31,254
I can give you information
that will keep the balance.

492
01:02:31,924 --> 01:02:34,788
Now, are you in or out?

493
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:44,266
Percival's trying to set me up.

494
01:02:48,452 --> 01:02:50,271
Are you surprised?

495
01:02:52,004 --> 01:02:53,826
Not really.

496
01:02:53,956 --> 01:02:58,046
These relationships aren't real.
They're just a means to an end.

497
01:03:01,431 --> 01:03:04,053
When you tell the truth, you look different.

498
01:03:04,233 --> 01:03:06,087
Your eyes change.

499
01:03:07,236 --> 01:03:09,089
Thanks for the warning.

500
01:03:11,808 --> 01:03:15,429
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I better not do it again.

501
01:03:21,151 --> 01:03:22,704
Why?

502
01:03:26,456 --> 01:03:29,110
'Cause it's going to get me killed one day.

503
01:04:48,472 --> 01:04:53,146
Well, I am impressed. I thought Merkel
here was just a good bartender.

504
01:05:03,686 --> 01:05:06,106
You smell like a Stasi officer.

505
01:05:08,826 --> 01:05:13,082
Shave off that moustache. Use that
soap and cologne. It's from the West.

506
01:05:13,162 --> 01:05:16,840
- You can't take anything from the East.
- Merkel will give you some clothes.

507
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,587
Right this way, Mr. Spyglass.

508
01:05:57,107 --> 01:05:58,995
It should have been easy.

509
01:05:59,775 --> 01:06:04,653
The plan was sound. Whatever went wrong
did so because someone wanted it to.

510
01:06:04,733 --> 01:06:08,537
- Someone from the inside.
- Were you betrayed by a fellow agent?

511
01:06:08,617 --> 01:06:10,440
You mean Satchel?

512
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,840
Would that be unheard of?

513
01:06:14,089 --> 01:06:15,943
Per your request.

514
01:06:21,431 --> 01:06:25,487
You won't be needing that.
It will be worse if they find it on you.

515
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:31,160
- Everything else ready?
- Yes. Everything you requested.

516
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,464
I'm ready.

517
01:06:36,313 --> 01:06:38,601
What do you think of his shirt?

518
01:06:39,181 --> 01:06:41,438
I wouldn't be caught dead in it.

519
01:06:41,718 --> 01:06:43,973
But for him, it's perfect.

520
01:06:44,053 --> 01:06:45,940
Stand over here.

521
01:06:48,123 --> 01:06:50,210
Now look like a free man.

522
01:06:54,231 --> 01:06:58,189
<i>East Berlin peace leaders have
organized a demonstration this week...</i>

523
01:06:58,269 --> 01:07:00,354
<i>...at Alexanderplatz.</i>

524
01:07:04,641 --> 01:07:07,729
Did he tell you I memorized the whole list?

525
01:07:09,146 --> 01:07:10,731
Yes.

526
01:07:12,015 --> 01:07:15,459
I realize I may not be
as valuable to some people and...

527
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:18,340
...some people may even want me dead, but...

528
01:07:20,923 --> 01:07:22,744
...what choice do I have?

529
01:07:24,527 --> 01:07:29,388
You're no good to me dead.
And I've never lost a package.

530
01:07:31,434 --> 01:07:33,314
I know.

531
01:07:38,975 --> 01:07:42,030
Hey, hey, hey. It's his family.

532
01:07:43,847 --> 01:07:47,335
- This was not part of the plan.
- Part of mine.

533
01:07:49,252 --> 01:07:50,824
Please.

534
01:07:51,254 --> 01:07:54,916
I'll take the wife and kid.
You just have to deal with Spyglass.

535
01:07:56,259 --> 01:07:58,513
I don't know if I have enough passports.

536
01:07:59,695 --> 01:08:01,218
<i>Percival.</i>

537
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:03,695
<i>Your old golden boy.</i>

538
01:08:36,098 --> 01:08:37,622
We have to go.

539
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:44,344
See you in the West. Good luck.

540
01:09:39,662 --> 01:09:43,117
- This was never part of the plan.
- It was part of mine.

541
01:10:36,386 --> 01:10:38,204
Stay low.

542
01:10:44,693 --> 01:10:46,580
In here.

543
01:10:50,033 --> 01:10:53,320
I need to deal with this now,
or we'll never get across.

544
01:10:57,674 --> 01:11:00,897
- I don't want to die.
- You're not going to die.

545
01:11:00,977 --> 01:11:02,830
Stay here.

546
01:13:58,887 --> 01:14:00,398
Fuck.

547
01:14:13,502 --> 01:14:15,956
Two more. There's two more.

548
01:14:59,949 --> 01:15:01,468
Go.

549
01:15:05,721 --> 01:15:07,709
You need to stop that bleeding.

550
01:15:07,789 --> 01:15:11,811
Search for anything. Alcohol, rags.

551
01:17:47,616 --> 01:17:49,636
Am I a bitch now?

552
01:18:40,268 --> 01:18:42,121
Get in.

553
01:18:42,739 --> 01:18:44,625
Get in!

554
01:18:52,014 --> 01:18:54,301
You need to work on your German.

555
01:18:57,819 --> 01:18:59,673
It's horrible.

556
01:19:01,991 --> 01:19:03,810
What the hell?

557
01:19:52,641 --> 01:19:54,508
Fasten your seat belt.

558
01:20:42,824 --> 01:20:46,017
- You all right?
- Yeah.

559
01:20:46,827 --> 01:20:48,347
We have to go...

560
01:21:01,742 --> 01:21:03,828
- It's so cold!
- Open your door.

561
01:21:03,908 --> 01:21:06,733
My foot is... it's stuck!

562
01:21:15,857 --> 01:21:17,677
Just breathe.

563
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,522
- You need a break?
- No.

564
01:22:42,877 --> 01:22:44,411
So...

565
01:22:45,581 --> 01:22:49,105
...yes, I think I understand everything.
You made your plan.

566
01:22:49,385 --> 01:22:52,474
And you failed to get the high-value asset...

567
01:22:52,554 --> 01:22:54,376
...safely across to the West.

568
01:22:54,456 --> 01:22:57,111
You sent me into a fucking hornet's nest.

569
01:22:59,295 --> 01:23:02,919
I was made by the KGB from the moment
my feet touched the ground.

570
01:23:02,999 --> 01:23:04,851
Maybe even before.

571
01:23:06,668 --> 01:23:09,157
But then you knew that, didn't you?

572
01:23:09,237 --> 01:23:12,061
You had your doubts about Percival...

573
01:23:12,841 --> 01:23:15,842
...and you used me to shake him down.

574
01:23:16,579 --> 01:23:18,598
Ready when you are.

575
01:23:37,332 --> 01:23:39,121
Hey, hey.

576
01:23:39,201 --> 01:23:41,221
It's me. It's me.

577
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:55,716
He's dead. Spyglass is dead.

578
01:23:58,553 --> 01:24:00,439
And you are alive.

579
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:04,544
They're all listening to me.

580
01:24:08,062 --> 01:24:09,915
They knew.

581
01:24:10,331 --> 01:24:12,642
The KGB knew everything.

582
01:24:14,035 --> 01:24:16,055
I need to get across.

583
01:24:17,806 --> 01:24:19,393
Jan.

584
01:25:01,382 --> 01:25:04,456
Well, I expected more out of the Brits
than a royal goat fuck.

585
01:25:04,536 --> 01:25:08,809
I know. We're sorry. No, wait. You lot don't
have your own private Stasi agent, do you?

586
01:25:08,889 --> 01:25:11,677
Not one with a photographic memory.

587
01:25:19,601 --> 01:25:22,249
<i>We need to get with Broughton
and get on the same page.</i>

588
01:25:22,329 --> 01:25:24,808
<i>We need that list... now more than ever.</i>

589
01:25:26,641 --> 01:25:27,950
Broughton?

590
01:25:28,677 --> 01:25:30,457
She made it out.

591
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,865
Right.

592
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:38,941
You know, a beautiful Italian
girl once said to me, "David...

593
01:25:40,421 --> 01:25:42,831
...you can't unfuck what's been fucked."

594
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:48,047
Women are always getting
in the way of progress, aren't they?

595
01:25:51,216 --> 01:25:54,221
<i>What no one in Germany believed
possible has happened tonight.</i>

596
01:25:54,301 --> 01:25:56,959
<i>The wall is coming down. The wall is down.</i>

597
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:00,295
<i>People here have lived
with the wall since 1961...</i>

598
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:04,590
<i>...and I think now it's time to...
break the wall down, you know.</i>

599
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,534
<i>The wall is crumbling.</i>

600
01:26:06,614 --> 01:26:12,040
<i>The sledgehammers in the hands of men
not born when it went up tear into it.</i>

601
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:16,412
<i>And behind it, the East German
soldiers tried to stop the tide.</i>

602
01:26:16,492 --> 01:26:20,548
<i>Water cannons were brought out.
But the West Berliners were determined.</i>

603
01:26:20,628 --> 01:26:22,951
<i>One West Berliner sprayed champagne back.</i>

604
01:26:23,031 --> 01:26:26,519
<i>You know, if I was to follow you,
I mean, properly...</i>

605
01:26:27,335 --> 01:26:29,013
<i>...you'd never fucking know.</i>

606
01:26:29,603 --> 01:26:33,661
<i>It is the moment Berliners
have waited 28 years for.</i>

607
01:26:33,741 --> 01:26:35,864
<i>Even the East Germans seem exhilarated.</i>

608
01:26:35,944 --> 01:26:39,751
<i>A symbolic breach in the structure
that cost hundreds of lives...</i>

609
01:26:39,831 --> 01:26:44,473
<i>...and separated friends,
families and lovers for decades.</i>

610
01:26:44,553 --> 01:26:49,387
I found a French UHF device
in my coat after Spyglass died.

611
01:26:50,592 --> 01:26:53,081
I now believe it was Percival who planted it.

612
01:26:53,161 --> 01:26:55,249
Made it look like Lasalle.

613
01:27:17,987 --> 01:27:19,840
Why are you here?

614
01:27:21,457 --> 01:27:23,743
You need to leave Berlin.

615
01:27:25,426 --> 01:27:28,203
Well, when I didn't hear from you,
I got worried.

616
01:27:28,296 --> 01:27:30,317
How naive can you be?

617
01:27:31,567 --> 01:27:33,787
We chose this life, Delphine.

618
01:27:35,436 --> 01:27:38,558
- This only ends one way.
- What are you talking about?

619
01:27:43,094 --> 01:27:45,069
He set us both up.

620
01:27:45,149 --> 01:27:47,399
You have to leave while you can.

621
01:28:13,307 --> 01:28:15,997
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Don't underestimate me, Percival.

622
01:28:16,077 --> 01:28:20,396
<i>Lasalle, listen to me very carefully.
You have no idea who you're dealing with.</i>

623
01:28:20,476 --> 01:28:23,973
- <i>You set me up.</i>
- You... come on. This is the game.

624
01:28:24,053 --> 01:28:29,474
<i>I know your secrets, David, and I can
play this game better than you think.</i>

625
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:24,500
<i>Percival is trying to set me up.</i>

626
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:28,403
- <i>Are you surprised?</i>
- <i>Not really.</i>

627
01:29:28,483 --> 01:29:32,509
<i>These relationships aren't real.
They're just a means to an end.</i>

628
01:29:33,989 --> 01:29:36,612
<i>When you tell the truth, you look different.</i>

629
01:29:36,892 --> 01:29:40,180
- <i>Your eyes change.</i>
- <i>Thanks for the warning.</i>

630
01:29:42,898 --> 01:29:46,587
- <i>What do you mean?</i>
- <i>I mean, I better not do it again.</i>

631
01:29:46,967 --> 01:29:48,223
<i>Why?</i>

632
01:29:48,303 --> 01:29:50,957
<i>'Cause it's going to get me killed one day.</i>

633
01:29:55,476 --> 01:29:57,930
<i>There is something that I need to tell you.</i>

634
01:30:06,321 --> 01:30:09,375
<i>It has to do with
your friend Percival. He's...</i>

635
01:31:44,218 --> 01:31:46,104
I'm sorry, darling.

636
01:31:48,155 --> 01:31:49,976
This is the game.

637
01:32:41,358 --> 01:32:42,899
Fuck.

638
01:32:44,379 --> 01:32:46,767
<i>Celebrations continue in the streets tonight.</i>

639
01:32:46,847 --> 01:32:49,904
<i>From the moment the first wave
of East Germans crossed into Berlin...</i>

640
01:32:49,984 --> 01:32:54,009
<i>...they have been showered with champagne
and cheered by a crowd of thousands.</i>

641
01:32:54,089 --> 01:32:57,979
<i>It is clear this will be one
of Berlin's most dramatic days.</i>

642
01:32:58,059 --> 01:33:00,749
<i>East Berliners are overcome
as they cross the border...</i>

643
01:33:00,829 --> 01:33:03,118
<i>...that has been closed to them for 28 years.</i>

644
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:07,737
<i>West Berliners are chipping away at the wall
that scarred their city and scaling it.</i>

645
01:33:23,817 --> 01:33:26,274
<i>There is no more interference
from the police.</i>

646
01:33:26,354 --> 01:33:28,877
<i>Unified, Berliners lay symbols of peace.</i>

647
01:33:28,957 --> 01:33:32,569
<i>Thousands of them looking east
and chanting, "Down with the wall."</i>

648
01:33:55,682 --> 01:33:58,303
There's only one question left to ask.

649
01:33:59,955 --> 01:34:01,776
Who won?

650
01:34:01,956 --> 01:34:04,444
And what was the fucking game anyway?

651
01:34:05,711 --> 01:34:08,817
<i>And I was thinking, the wall will never fall.</i>

652
01:34:08,897 --> 01:34:13,388
<i>Germany's peaceful revolution is probably
the political and cultural story of 1989.</i>

653
01:34:13,468 --> 01:34:16,658
<i>We're going to take a break, but we'll be back
with an in-depth look at the number-one...</i>

654
01:34:16,738 --> 01:34:20,995
<i>...musical controversy of the year, sampling.
Is it art, or is it just plagiarism?</i>

655
01:34:21,075 --> 01:34:22,384
<i>Don't go away.</i>

656
01:34:29,151 --> 01:34:33,005
To win, first you have to know
whose side you're on.

657
01:34:39,594 --> 01:34:41,849
<i>In our line of work...</i>

658
01:34:41,929 --> 01:34:46,385
<i>...that's right up there with black holes
or "to be or not to be."</i>

659
01:34:48,603 --> 01:34:51,242
You fight the good fight, and then
one day you wake up and you realize...

660
01:34:51,322 --> 01:34:53,750
...that all you were
was Satan's little helper.

661
01:35:14,195 --> 01:35:15,851
<i>Ironic.</i>

662
01:35:15,931 --> 01:35:19,354
<i>The news will tell them
there will be no more secrets.</i>

663
01:35:20,734 --> 01:35:24,175
<i>But you and I, we both know that's not true.</i>

664
01:35:24,873 --> 01:35:28,351
<i>The world is run on secrets.</i>

665
01:35:34,716 --> 01:35:37,471
<i>Whoever has that list has power.</i>

666
01:35:37,551 --> 01:35:40,639
<i>And without it,
you're just another fucking target.</i>

667
01:35:47,762 --> 01:35:50,952
<i>So, what have I learned after all this time?</i>

668
01:35:51,032 --> 01:35:53,254
After all the sleepless nights...

669
01:35:53,934 --> 01:35:57,191
<i>...lying to friends, lovers, myself?</i>

670
01:35:57,271 --> 01:36:00,162
<i>Playing this crooked game
in this crooked town...</i>

671
01:36:00,242 --> 01:36:03,400
<i>...filled with backstabbers
and four-faced liars?</i>

672
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:08,102
<i>I'll tell you what I've learned.
One thing and one thing only.</i>

673
01:36:08,182 --> 01:36:11,169
I fucking love Berlin!

674
01:36:36,511 --> 01:36:39,725
- You didn't have to kill her.
- You what...

675
01:36:39,805 --> 01:36:43,671
...you suddenly decided to develop
a conscience after all you've done?

676
01:36:44,551 --> 01:36:48,877
Have you noticed how everyone you
get close to ends up fucking dead?

677
01:36:48,957 --> 01:36:51,647
You gave Bremovych the details of the plan.

678
01:36:52,627 --> 01:36:55,318
You went to the KGB to take me out.

679
01:36:56,898 --> 01:36:59,673
You were too fucking scared
to do it yourself.

680
01:36:59,753 --> 01:37:02,357
Too smart, more like.

681
01:37:03,637 --> 01:37:07,255
If those KGB pricks had done their part,
I'd be on my way to a hand job...

682
01:37:07,335 --> 01:37:09,173
...with the queen by now.

683
01:37:10,077 --> 01:37:13,736
I've read that list, Lorraine.

684
01:37:16,717 --> 01:37:18,639
And you feature heavily.

685
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:21,974
Turns out you've been a very naughty girl.

686
01:37:24,525 --> 01:37:27,047
Spyglass was a liability to us all.

687
01:37:27,127 --> 01:37:30,986
- I couldn't risk leaving him with you.
- Where's the list, David?

688
01:37:31,366 --> 01:37:33,330
I don't have it.

689
01:37:33,410 --> 01:37:36,654
It's en route to MI6, where it belongs.

690
01:37:52,086 --> 01:37:54,506
Are you going to lie till the very end?

691
01:38:00,861 --> 01:38:03,484
Truth and lies.

692
01:38:04,564 --> 01:38:08,656
- People like us don't know the difference.
- No, we know the difference, David.

693
01:38:09,236 --> 01:38:11,324
We choose to ignore it.

694
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:15,028
Isn't that right, Comrade Satchel?

695
01:38:16,864 --> 01:38:19,219
So that's how you'll make it work.

696
01:38:19,299 --> 01:38:22,369
"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."

697
01:38:22,449 --> 01:38:24,000
Well played.

698
01:38:41,036 --> 01:38:43,202
You killed David Percival?

699
01:38:45,907 --> 01:38:50,597
All the paperwork is in order for the bodies
of James Gascoigne and David Percival.

700
01:38:53,881 --> 01:38:57,972
You killed our head of station,
an officer of the Crown.

701
01:38:58,052 --> 01:39:00,742
You'd better have hard proof
and a damn good explanation.

702
01:39:00,822 --> 01:39:04,309
- Who are you to judge my actions?
- I'm your superior.

703
01:39:10,931 --> 01:39:13,018
My superior.

704
01:39:15,236 --> 01:39:17,592
This was never about stopping the war.

705
01:39:17,672 --> 01:39:19,928
It was about saving your ass.

706
01:39:20,808 --> 01:39:23,524
You couldn't bear the embarrassment...

707
01:39:23,604 --> 01:39:26,468
...of the sins that we committed
in the Cold War.

708
01:39:27,348 --> 01:39:30,171
And I was stupid enough
to give my life for it.

709
01:39:30,251 --> 01:39:33,440
Yes, well, that's your job, isn't it?

710
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,539
I did my job.

711
01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:41,934
Despite your best efforts
and your incompetence...

712
01:39:43,564 --> 01:39:45,852
I succeeded where you failed.

713
01:39:47,534 --> 01:39:50,225
I uncovered your traitor, Satchel.

714
01:39:51,005 --> 01:39:53,493
Brought him the only justice he deserved.

715
01:39:57,162 --> 01:39:59,015
A bullet.

716
01:40:00,381 --> 01:40:04,205
Percival meeting with Bremovych
the day before Spyglass was killed.

717
01:40:05,585 --> 01:40:08,276
<i>Maybe we could make some sort of arrangement.</i>

718
01:40:08,356 --> 01:40:11,980
<i>You got to know that I'm the only man in
this town that can help you get that list.</i>

719
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:14,916
<i>Very impressive. Dedication.</i>

720
01:40:14,996 --> 01:40:17,617
<i>Loyalty. They're rare things these days.</i>

721
01:40:17,697 --> 01:40:20,519
<i>"It's a double pleasure
to deceive the deceiver."</i>

722
01:40:25,993 --> 01:40:28,091
We have a deal?

723
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:33,234
- What about the British?
- <i>Do you trust Gray?</i>

724
01:40:33,514 --> 01:40:35,569
- No.
- What about C?

725
01:40:35,649 --> 01:40:38,180
<i>C is an arrogant lapdog
who understands precisely...</i>

726
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:40,665
...fuck-all beyond the edge of his desk.

727
01:40:44,259 --> 01:40:46,545
Percival was Satchel.

728
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:54,720
Where's the list?

729
01:40:55,369 --> 01:40:57,552
Where's the list, Lorraine?

730
01:40:57,972 --> 01:40:59,792
I don't know.

731
01:41:03,495 --> 01:41:06,969
Bollocks. The prime minister is going
to have a difficult time with this.

732
01:41:12,086 --> 01:41:14,742
We're choosing to bury this one, Broughton.

733
01:41:14,822 --> 01:41:17,344
Your mission never took place.

734
01:41:17,424 --> 01:41:19,443
This conversation...

735
01:41:21,629 --> 01:41:23,482
...never happened.

736
01:41:26,066 --> 01:41:28,722
I'm putting you on leave,
effective immediately.

737
01:41:29,002 --> 01:41:32,457
We'll start the next decade well rested.

738
01:41:34,441 --> 01:41:35,660
C?

739
01:41:38,045 --> 01:41:39,864
What should I wear...

740
01:41:46,086 --> 01:41:47,973
...for my tea with the queen?

741
01:45:59,106 --> 01:46:02,727
Did you really think
I was going to give you that list?

742
01:46:03,843 --> 01:46:07,502
Before you die, I want you to get this
through your thick, primitive skull.

743
01:46:10,284 --> 01:46:12,537
I never worked for you.

744
01:46:12,736 --> 01:46:14,572
You worked for me.

745
01:46:21,696 --> 01:46:25,518
Every false intel I gave you,
a rip in the Iron Curtain.

746
01:46:28,235 --> 01:46:31,390
Every piece of intel you gave me,
a bullet in my fucking gun.

747
01:46:32,607 --> 01:46:34,750
I want my life back.

748
01:47:22,822 --> 01:47:24,641
Safe travels.

749
01:47:50,316 --> 01:47:54,241
<i>Estimated flight time to Langley,
11 hours and 37 minutes.</i>

750
01:47:54,321 --> 01:47:56,476
<i>Cleared for takeoff.</i>

751
01:47:56,556 --> 01:47:58,378
Let's go home.

752
01:47:58,758 --> 01:48:00,645
That sounds good.

753
01:48:02,012 --> 01:48:03,899
Let's go home.

754
01:48:10,705 --> 01:48:12,217
"Cocksucker"?

755
01:48:13,239 --> 01:48:14,825
Really?

756
01:48:17,477 --> 01:48:19,698
I'm glad it was convincing.

757
01:48:20,305 --> 01:49:20,664
