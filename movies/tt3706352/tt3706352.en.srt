3
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,086
<i>...now fear
that something has gone terribly amiss.</i>

4
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,797
<i>Austrian officials fear
the absolute worst.</i>

5
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,300
<i>The hijackers have lowered
the blinds on the plane.</i>

6
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:53,137
<i>We've heard or seen nothing
since that initial communication.</i>

7
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,055
<i>We know that they've killed
a flight attendant.</i>

8
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,600
<i>The terrorism experts
I'm speaking with say</i>

9
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,394
<i>it would've been impossible
for a small group of jihadists</i>

10
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:03,439
<i>to have staged this hijacking
on their own.</i>

11
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:07,151
Heads down! Everyone, down!

12
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,819
Everyone, down!

13
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,321
Down!

14
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,530
Quiet!

15
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,115
Quiet down!

16
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:14,784
Quiet down.

17
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,076
Quiet!

18
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,580
Down!

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,750
{\an8}...here in Vienna
appears to have taken

20
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,962
{\an8}what we fear is the most tragic
development of this situation.

21
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,633
Hostages have been killed alongside...

22
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,636
They just posted a video
from inside the plane on the Internet.

23
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,483
Now is the time we send our message.

24
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:51,445
You brought this upon yourselves.

25
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:56,784
We speak for all victims around the world.

26
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,119
We speak in the language of the powerless.

27
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:04,583
Just as your missiles
continue to strike our people,

28
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,545
we will strike back.

29
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,088
Allahu Akbar.

30
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,509
Allahu Akbar.

31
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,637
The Austrians say they're dead.

32
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,853
The hijackers, the passengers, crew.

33
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,480
Everyone.

34
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,047
Celia!

35
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:12,902
They've opened the books
on Flight 127 back at Langley.

36
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,032
No one wants to open that can of worms.

37
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,577
Not after eight years.

38
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,662
Headquarters feels differently.

39
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,874
We've done this already.

40
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,670
What went wrong,
what could we have done better.

41
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:34,089
We've been blaming ourselves ever since.

42
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,888
They caught Ilyas Shishani.

43
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,768
Three weeks ago in Afghanistan.

44
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:50,731
He said the hijackers had help
from inside our station here in Vienna.

45
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,442
We believe him?

46
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,319
Headquarters believes him.

47
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,363
That's the only thing that matters.

48
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,867
Send me.

49
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,079
If anyone can get the truth
out of Ilyas, it's me.

50
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,914
He's dead, Henry.

51
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,541
Wasn't in any shape to be interrogated.

52
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,002
Somebody made a mistake.

53
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,421
Did we at least get a name from him?

54
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,441
<i>We need to close the books
on Flight 127 once and for all.</i>

55
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,861
<i>Find out if we had a mole in our station.</i>

56
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,521
That's a Tehran number.

57
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,772
From Bill's phone.

58
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,650
<i>Bill wasn't the only one
using that extension.</i>

59
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,277
You know that.

60
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,752
Hi.

61
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,090
Hi, beautiful.

62
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,262
<i>And if it's her,</i>

63
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,265
you still carrying the torch
for Celia Harrison?

64
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,726
It's Celia Favreau now.

65
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,144
Husband and two kids.

66
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,525
<i>Besides, no torch burns eight years,
not without oxygen.</i>

67
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,199
<i>Think she'll even talk to you?</i>

68
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,993
<i>- We could send Mack to California.</i>
- Everything all right?

69
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,037
<i>He won't know if she's lying.</i>

70
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,497
Uh...

71
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,748
Ballet class.

72
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,041
Running late again.

73
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,752
Will you?

74
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,007
Isn't that why you're sending me?

75
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,019
<i>Bill's in London, right?</i>

76
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,354
<i>Correct.</i>

77
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:39,233
<i>I'll talk to him first,
then I'll see about California.</i>

78
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,465
<i>So, if it does turn out to be true...</i>

79
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,301
...what do you want me to do?

80
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,596
We can't afford the embarrassment
of a prosecution.

81
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,436
I need to know the man I send
can do what's necessary.

82
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,982
You gonna say it?

83
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,735
No, Henry, I'm not.

84
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,077
<i>Treble.</i>

85
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,122
Piccolo, how are you?

86
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,874
We still on?

87
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,669
Carmel-by-the-Sea. I'm here.

88
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,049
There's a chance it won't be necessary.

89
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,928
<i>I'll clear it with you beforehand.</i>

90
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,932
<i>All you have to do is say yes or no.</i>

91
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,716
- Reservation?
- Yeah. I'm early, though.

92
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,718
- Name?
- Favreau.

93
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,470
I can seat you now if you'd like.

94
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,929
I'll wait at the bar.

95
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,979
Vodka martini. You have Tito's?

96
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,731
Uh, sorry, we only serve wine.

97
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,983
Really?

98
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,235
- Wine country.
- Sure.

99
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,948
Um...

100
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,034
let's try something very cold.

101
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,869
Uh, white or rosÃ©?

102
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:01,995
Dry.

103
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,033
Henry.

104
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,705
Celia.

105
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,667
It's been a long time.

106
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,168
It has.

107
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,839
You got gray.

108
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,966
- I did.
- It looks good.

109
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,843
You look...

110
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,177
exactly the same.

111
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,307
C-Come here.

112
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,228
Thanks for coming.

113
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,354
Shall we?

114
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,088
It's a nice spot.

115
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,381
Yeah.

116
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,884
You can't get a table on weekends.

117
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,636
But the middle of the week,
it's dependably dead.

118
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,557
How is Carmel-by-the-Sea?

119
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,351
Hmm? Indulging your love of the elderly?

120
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,525
You've done it.

121
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,818
You left everything behind.

122
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,361
Yeah.

123
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,572
This is not Vienna.

124
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,491
I've noticed.

125
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,080
This tastes funny.

126
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,666
This is your soy milk, isn't it?

127
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,376
It's arsenic.

128
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,342
You busy today?

129
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,426
Oh.

130
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,012
Shit. Yeah.

131
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,641
Vick.

132
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,354
Vick has me looking into
money laundering stuff.

133
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,690
- Bankers.
- Oh, yeah.

134
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:36,983
Right?

135
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,569
Can you have some breakfast?

136
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,785
Bankers get up early.

137
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,747
I guess I need to go, too.

138
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,457
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

139
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,891
To what?

140
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,393
To old friends.

141
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,436
Aw, you can do better than that.

142
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,146
Okay.

143
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,151
To old lovers.

144
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,454
How's the office?

145
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,456
Same as ever.

146
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,252
Vick runs it like a fiefdom.
You know that.

147
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,754
- So you're still on the street?
- No, no.

148
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,464
Entirely air-conditioned now.

149
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,049
Mm. Who'd have thought?

150
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,093
Henry Pelham, office drone.

151
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,642
Vick has me looking into Flight 127.

152
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,771
Why?

153
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,818
Too many inconsistencies.

154
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,240
So this is an interview.

155
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,412
I was in Santa Clara,

156
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,706
and driving down was...

157
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,877
I wanted to see you.

158
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,047
But I also have to close the book on this.

159
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,387
I thought you were here to see
if we still had that old spark.

160
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,273
Bill Compton.

161
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,361
Geez.

162
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,821
Henry.

163
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,825
What are you doing here?

164
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,451
- You get a transfer?
- No.

165
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,829
- Can I sit?
- Sure, yeah.

166
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,546
They have me looking into Flight 127.

167
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,594
That's ancient history.

168
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,012
It's done.

169
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,348
- It was, and then it wasn't.
- Huh.

170
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,226
Is this, uh...

171
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,396
This Vick's big idea?

172
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,897
Headquarters.

173
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,442
Right, right.

174
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,279
They caught Ilyas Shishani.

175
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,031
No.

176
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,742
- Wow.
- Yeah.

177
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,827
Hey, now, that's a good thing, huh?

178
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,787
- It is.
- Yeah.

179
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,290
We should order champagne.

180
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,461
He said he had help
from inside the station, Bill.

181
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,255
- Our station?
- Mm.

182
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,381
He's lying.

183
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,383
What are you having?

184
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,012
Well, um, uh, it's a single malt.

185
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,805
I'll join you.

186
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,682
- You want anything else?
- No.

187
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,606
<i>Ilyas died before we could get a name.</i>

188
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:50,111
And now there's an analyst at headquarters
that wants to ride the lie,

189
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,363
thinks we have some soul-searching to do.

190
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,201
We did some pretty serious
soul-searching back then.

191
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,368
Here's the plan, Ce.

192
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,121
I write a fat report, a rococo analysis

193
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:03,917
of failures and successes,
full of perspectives.

194
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,752
Make the fucker's head spin.

195
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,587
That'll get him off our back.

196
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,757
I'm all yours.

197
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,343
Let me give you a minute to come up with

198
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,428
a suitable cover story.

199
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,372
- Yes?
- Ce?

200
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,960
Who is this?

201
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,503
Ce, it's...

202
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,088
It's me. It's Bill.

203
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,172
Bill?

204
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,174
Oh, my God. Is everything okay?

205
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,718
Yeah, no, no, it-it's fine.
You sound good.

206
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,387
I sound confused.

207
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,097
Yeah.

208
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,890
- Where are you?
- London.

209
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,308
Yeah, we moved a year ago.

210
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:03,768
You hate London.

211
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,770
Yeah, tell me about it.

212
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,147
You know, it-it was for Sally. We...

213
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,149
Oh, Bill.

214
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,943
Listen, do you, um... you got a minute?

215
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,278
Of course.

216
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,947
Look, um, I've been
out of the game a while now,

217
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,616
but, uh, I thought I should call you.

218
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,244
Talk to me.

219
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,831
It's Henry. Henry Pelham.

220
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,044
Go on.

221
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,881
<i>He's here in London.</i>

222
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,841
<i>He's putting me through the wringer.</i>

223
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,136
I just thought I should warn you.

224
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:50,356
Celia Favreau, 5:36 p.m.

225
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,803
For the lady, grilled goat cheese
with bitter leaves,

226
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,056
miso, ginger and pumpkin puree.

227
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,725
For the gentleman, burrata
with cilantro oil, blood orange

228
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,602
and maple-glazed free-range bacon.

229
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,104
Mmm. Fields of bacon running free.

230
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,522
It's a beautiful sight.

231
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,234
- More wine?
- Yes, please.

232
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,367
Yeah, she's very pretty.

233
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,577
How long are you planning to stay?

234
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,996
You are the only girl
in this town for me, Ce.

235
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,876
Your bacon smells so good.

236
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,587
Live a little.

237
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,130
- No.
- Live a little.

238
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,183
Mmm.

239
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,436
- So good.
- Mmm.

240
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,399
Thank you.

241
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,364
December 2012.

242
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,827
Paint me Celia's picture.

243
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,873
How far back?

244
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,711
<i>Just tell me the basic stuff.</i>

245
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,714
<i>What happened that day, what you remember
about the station back then.</i>

246
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,342
<i>We can work our way up to 127.</i>

247
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,052
<i>Okay.</i>

248
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,638
<i>Vienna was my second posting.</i>

249
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,724
<i>I'd come off some tough years in Dublin.</i>

250
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,685
<i>Why were they tough?</i>

251
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,021
<i>Well, you know that I lost both my parents</i>

252
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,481
<i>in a car accident when I was in college.</i>

253
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,610
{\an8}<i>And Dublin was just too slow.</i>

254
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:02,238
{\an8}<i>I had too much time to think.</i>

255
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,911
{\an8}<i>What was Vienna?</i>

256
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,706
{\an8}<i>It was the ultimate high.</i>

257
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,584
{\an8}<i>- We collected secrets...</i>
- Thank you.

258
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,628
{\an8}<i>...sometimes from
the highest echelons of government.</i>

259
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,554
<i>Vienna Station up on the fifth floor</i>

260
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,848
<i>of the U.S. embassy.</i>

261
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,601
<i>And our chief then, as now,
Victor Wallinger.</i>

262
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,102
- Morning, chief.
- Good morning, Harrison.

263
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,437
I'll see you at the brief.

264
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,607
<i>I think his greatest talent
was knowing who to bring on the team.</i>

265
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,567
- Leila.
- Good morning, chief.

266
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,152
Good morning.

267
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,905
Flash cable came in from headquarters.

268
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,782
We'll need an assessment
at the morning brief.

269
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,909
<i>Take me through the team.</i>

270
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,828
<i>Leila Maloof, collection management.</i>

271
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,247
<i>You know, she grew up in a war zone.</i>

272
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,833
<i>She had life experience
that none of us had.</i>

273
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,589
<i>Second in command after Vick
was my dear boss Bill Compton.</i>

274
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,882
<i>He was like a father to me.</i>

275
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,801
- Oh, Bill.
- Good morning.

276
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,845
<i>Scarred from old skirmishes
in Southeast Asia.</i>

277
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:11,265
<i>Although he probably suffered more
at the hands of his wife Sally.</i>

278
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:12,767
<i>Probably? That's being generous.</i>

279
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,145
I've had files pulled up
for the CEOs of those banks.

280
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,272
<i>And there was Ernst Pul.</i>

281
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,899
<i>Captain Uptight.</i>

282
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,527
<i>Worked liaison with Austrian intelligence.</i>

283
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,197
<i>And then you'll remember Owen Lassiter.</i>

284
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,116
<i>Mm. Poor Owen.</i>

285
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:31,285
<i>He ran a team
of code breakers and analysts.</i>

286
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,330
<i>Only lasted a couple of months after 127,</i>

287
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,833
<i>before he found himself a pistol
in the storeroom,</i>

288
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,167
<i>smuggled that home.</i>

289
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:53,307
And that particular day?

290
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,143
What about my number one?

291
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,645
Henry Pelham.

292
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:01,691
<i>Clandestine case officer extraordinaire.</i>

293
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,360
<i>The brightest talent
out of the Farm in years.</i>

294
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,865
They sent you directly to Moscow.

295
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,076
You witnessed the Nord-Ost siege.

296
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:16,164
Chechen militants took over
the Dubrovka Theater.

297
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:19,750
Russians pumped gas
into the theater and went in.

298
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,836
Killed nearly all the terrorists.

299
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,046
Well over a hundred hostages, too.

300
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,593
That kind of thing
never leaves you, does it?

301
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,057
Moscow was brutal.

302
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,101
But I liked my job.

303
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,061
And you?

304
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,772
I was living the dream.

305
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:45,401
I had a boss I adored,
knew I was making a difference.

306
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,487
And I had you.

307
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,618
And then you left.

308
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,372
Then Flight 127 happened.

309
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,669
Ladies and gentlemen, first of all,

310
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,797
I'd like to welcome you all
aboard to TA373,

311
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,799
Flight 1-2-7 to Vienna.

312
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,092
We'll be en route...

313
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:13,012
<i>It started with a cable
from headquarters at morning briefing.</i>

314
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,058
<i>You were out in the streets.</i>

315
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,605
Do the honors, Leila.

316
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,357
"Expect within the next 72 hours

317
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,276
"an airline-related event on a flight
heading to Austria or Germany.

318
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,572
"Departure port uncertain...
Damascus, Beirut, Istanbul possibilities.

319
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,324

320
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,244
"though primary actors likely recruits

321
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:37,536

322
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,996
Da'irat Al-Salihoon...

323
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,165
didn't they split from Al-Shabaab
a couple years ago?

324
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,668
Shabaab weren't devout enough for them.

325
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,378
It's not about devotion.

326
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,505
I was being ironic, Leila.

327
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,715
Al-Shabaab operate locally in Somalia.

328
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,842
Al-Da'irat are international.

329
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,386
They have collaborations
all over the world.

330
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,554
Terrorists in our backyard?

331
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,723
What's our take?

332
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,767
Mm, Germany, maybe, but not Austria.

333
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,936
So what do they want?

334
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,562
Troops out of Afghanistan?

335
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,564
The Austrians only have a handful.

336
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,984
The Germans have
the third largest presence

337
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,819
in NATO's Security Force.

338
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,947
Maybe they want to free
some fellow combatants from jail.

339
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,367
Again, Germany's the one
holding more than its fair share.

340
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,244
But we're talking E.U., remember.

341
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:22,248
You don't have to land in Berlin
or Frankfurt to speak to the Germans.

342
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,624
What about money?

343
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,710
Not with Tehran bankrolling them.

344
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:34,093
<i>Then we got the message
from Europol about Ilyas Shishani.</i>

345
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,263
He'd arrived in Barcelona two days before
from Tehran.

346
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,188
What did you know about Ilyas
at this point?

347
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,232
Chechen extremist.

348
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,651
You ran him as a source in Moscow.

349
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,821
He joined a group in Iran
that was already working with Al-Da'irat,

350
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:58,159
so it wasn't much of a leap
to wonder if he'd arrived for Flight 127.

351
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,119
- But you didn't know for sure?
- No.

352
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,495
None of us knew anything.

353
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,206
Could've been bad intel.

354
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,001
Excuse me, sir.
Could you please remain seated?

355
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,172
Everybody, calm!

356
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,506
Stay down!

357
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,384
<i>Then we were called back from lunch.</i>

358
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:20,097
- No, no, no, no.
- What's the situation?

359
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:21,557
The plane landed, then they took it over.

360
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,517
There are six Americans on board,
and they've already

361
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:24,894
killed a stewardess.

362
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,605
The ambassador's on the phone
with the minister of foreign affairs.

363
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,149
We're scrambling a task force upstairs.

364
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,943
- Who's talking to them?
- No one.

365
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,654
They issued their demands
by calling a local TV station,

366
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,531
closed the blinds
and cut off all communication.

367
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,367
- Do we know who they are?
- Leila.

368
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,952
The Turks have I.D.'d four:
Suleiman Wahed, Saudi;

369
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,371
Beslan Abdulayev, Chechen;

370
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:46,874
Omar Samatar Ali, Somali;
and Nadif Dalmar Guleed, also Somali.

371
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,085
We've got their passport photos
but not a lot more.

372
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,253
They've separated the children.

373
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,546
They did what?

374
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,799
Nine children
between ages five and twelve.

375
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,259
They're in the front as human shields.

376
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:58,469
My God.

377
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,346
What are their demands?

378
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,890
Five prisoner releases...
two here in Austria, three in Germany.

379
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,767
We have 24 hours.

380
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,437
What's the likelihood of the Austrians
and Germans giving in?

381
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,272
We're still waiting to hear
from Merkel's people.

382
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,565
The assessment is that she'll fold.

383
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:12,983
So we don't know, huh?

384
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:15,111
God, fucking politicians.

385
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:18,572
What we do know is that Ilyas Shishani
is in Europe and may be coordinating this.

386
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,866
All right, time to shake up our networks.

387
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,201
Bill, Celia, that's you.

388
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,995
Ernst, call in some favors
with the Austrians.

389
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,748
Owen, cut through the chatter,
find out what they're planning next.

390
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,583
- Sir.
- And, Leila, I want you to dig deeper

391
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,502
- into each one of these assholes.
- Yes, chief.

392
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:36,882
Hold on one second.

393
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,093
- Yeah, Vick?
- Change of plan.

394
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,886
I got to go.

395
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,179
Got 24 hours.

396
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:44,598
Um, do we know
anything more about it or no?

397
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,308
Ilyas Shishani might be involved.

398
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,102
I'll talk to my sources.

399
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:53,315
Your family is connected.
What are they saying?

400
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,110
I don't know anything.

401
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:58,529
Tahar?

402
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,491
Is there another cell operating right now?

403
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,744
Can we expect other hijackings?

404
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,039
<i>What are their capabilities? Anything.</i>

405
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,834
I told you.
I don't know anything about it.

406
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,961
Conversation at the mosque?

407
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,380
You want to hear that people
are taking sides?

408
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,007
Of course they are.

409
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,974
A few of the young ones are
packing their bags. Headed for Syria.

410
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,394
So Al-Da'irat is talking to
people here in Vienna?

411
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:31,562
I don't know.

412
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,439
Can you give me names?

413
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,609
It's too dangerous.

414
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,071
His name is Ilyas Shishani.

415
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:42,740
We think he might be here in Vienna.

416
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,202
- I don't know this man.
- Look harder.

417
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,372
People are gonna die, Tahar.

418
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,458
I don't know this man.

419
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,046
Is there anyone else I can talk to?

420
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:00,508
I'm sorry.

421
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,707
- What's the word?
- I got nothing.

422
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,000
At least not yet.

423
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,627
They're slamming doors in my face.

424
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,088
What about your man Ilyas Shishani?

425
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,423
Either they don't know
or they're not telling me.

426
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,802
Maybe we have to start asking
the Austrians to break down some doors.

427
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:11,704
How are you?

428
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,498
Uh, I talked with eight people
in the last three hours.

429
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,458
No one's saying anything.

430
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,002
They don't know who to trust.

431
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:21,547
They seem scared.

432
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,757
Even my regulars aren't talking.

433
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:28,178
I'm in touch with the Muslim
Women's Foundation downtown.

434
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:30,514
- I'll see if they've got any leads.
- Mm.

435
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,183
Henry, Ce,

436
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,185
we have contact with the plane.

437
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,822
So why here?

438
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,326
Carmel.

439
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,412
I'm sure you could've chosen
anyplace in the world.

440
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,706
Good schools?

441
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,876
Drew's idea?

442
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,713
It was as far away from the Agency
as I could get.

443
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:08,344
Well, you got out clean.

444
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,512
No one got out clean after 127.

445
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,685
No, you're right.

446
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,773
You know, two weeks after we arrived here,

447
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:24,443
I got a visit from this guy Karl,
with a "K."

448
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:28,113
<i>He tells me that Bill... my Bill,</i>

449
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,366
<i>the one I've devoted
a chunk of my life to...</i>

450
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:34,203
<i>has been selling secrets
to the highest bidder.</i>

451
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:39,124
Not to France or Russia or China,
but to the Islamist extremists.

452
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,587
Karl wants me to help bring him down.

453
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,965
Flight 127, he tells me,
is still fresh for the Austrians,

454
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,967
and they're demanding answers.

455
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,887
Did he have any evidence?

456
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,139
- They were looking for a scapegoat.
- Mm.

457
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,892
What'd you do?

458
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,769
<i>I told him to go fuck himself.</i>

459
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:01,355
<i>Good for you.</i>

460
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:06,819
But my point is...

461
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,154
that Karl ruined me.

462
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:12,866
After that visit, I got more disconnected.

463
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,829
Started feeling like a ghost.

464
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:19,957
You seem better now.

465
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,794
Evan cured me.

466
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,255
Kids change everything.

467
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,048
Maybe I should have one.

468
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,384
- It's not for the faint of heart.
- Mm.

469
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,428
- You think I'm too selfish.
- Definitely.

470
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,054
You know, I get the feeling

471
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,222
you're trying to educate me
about something.

472
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,224
I'm just not sure about the subject.

473
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,685
I'm sorry. I'm being a parent bore.

474
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,019
Where were we?

475
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,189
Ten minutes ago,

476
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:47,359
headquarters received a message
on the emergency line

477
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:52,030
from Ahmed Najjar,
one of our Middle Eastern couriers.

478
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:55,117
He is on the plane.

479
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,201
What?

480
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,078
We got an agent on Flight 127?

481
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,247
He's one of the passengers.

482
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,916
- We verified his identity?
- Headquarters did the vetting.

483
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,043
He sent this message:

484
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,795
"Four attackers, two guns.

485
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,214
"Children in first class, rest in econ.

486
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,425
"Two women critical.

487
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,345
"No power equals no cameras.

488
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,183
Suggest rear undercarriage attack."

489
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,934
I'd say we have the upper hand.

490
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:22,144
No, wait a second.

491
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,229
For the past eight years,

492
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:27,566
Ahmed has done nothing more
than spike dead drops.

493
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:32,154
He's 58, and he's not trained
in any counterinsurgency.

494
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,864
We have to negotiate.

495
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,699
- It's too dangerous to storm the plane.
- Negotiate?

496
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:38,535
Have you read Al-Da'irat's manifesto?

497
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,954
I have. March 2006.

498
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:43,499
They will never accept anything
less than their demands.

499
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,418
Never. They'll kill themselves
before they negotiate.

500
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,795
They did that in Kinshasa.

501
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,379
- You remember that?
- Mm-hmm.

502
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:52,132
They burned everyone alive
inside the central police station,

503
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,467
including themselves.

504
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,885
These guys do what they say.

505
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,887
They do not go back on their word.

506
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,597
Any news from the Germans?

507
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,974
The Germans are sending
their prisoners here to Vienna,

508
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,267
but it's a delaying tactic.

509
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,520
Merkel will never let them go.

510
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,647
- Thinks it's political suicide.
- And the Austrians?

511
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,025
They're gonna play tough, particularly now
the Germans aren't bending.

512
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,028
So if the Germans and Austrians
won't give in to the demands,

513
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,113
our only option is to storm the plane.

514
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:18,534
No, no, no, no.
W-We're not storming anything.

515
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:23,330
Our job is to advise the Austrians
and just hope they don't fuck it up.

516
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,707
So how do we advise
that this be accomplished?

517
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,670
Henry, you have field experience
with these people.

518
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:30,921
What's your take on it?

519
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,217
Undercarriage.

520
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,510
Just like Ahmed suggested.

521
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,886
It's been done before.

522
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,304
Uh...

523
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:42,349
some passengers will be killed,
but it's better than all of them dying.

524
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,017
Won't they see us coming?

525
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,395
That's why they called the media, right?

526
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,940
The Austrians will cordon them off,
get the broadcasters to play a loop.

527
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,025
If we don't get on that plane
in the next 20 hours,

528
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,862
it's gonna be a bloodbath.

529
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,989
Let me see what I can do
to pressure headquarters.

530
00:35:58,532 --> 00:35:59,992
I'm sorry, chief.

531
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,743
I have a meet.

532
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,203
You're leaving?

533
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:05,622
The Muslim Women's Foundation.
They could have a lead.

534
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:06,874
One second, Celia.

535
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:09,835
We want to keep this quiet.

536
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,880
We don't want anyone to find out
about our friend Ahmed.

537
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,381
Not even our people out there.

538
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,924
Absolutely.

539
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,551
Sir.

540
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,729
You left the station to meet someone.

541
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,898
It turned out to be useless.

542
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,358
<i>Who was it?</i>

543
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:37,487
<i>One of my regular contacts,
Sabina from the Muslim Women's Foundation,</i>

544
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:39,072
<i>although she couldn't stay.</i>

545
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:41,992
So Sabina had brought her friend Tahar.

546
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,204
<i>This woman Tahar said
that she would introduce me</i>

547
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,290
<i>to someone who could answer my questions.</i>

548
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,927
Give me your phone.

549
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,011
Your phone.

550
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,181
Quick.

551
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,391
Please.

552
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,218
She's lying.

553
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,229
Celia Harrison.

554
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,149
<i>As-salamu alaykum.</i>

555
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,234
<i>Wa alaykum as-salaam.</i>

556
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,862
Can I offer you a cigarette?

557
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:49,953
I was told that you had
information about Flight 127.

558
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:56,960
What we need to settle first...

559
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:59,838
is the question of compensation.

560
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,386
We need power.

561
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,138
Power comes from money.

562
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:12,893
When a man cannot get money power,

563
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,229
he will then reach for violent power.

564
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:17,731
You agree?

565
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,193
Do you have information or not?

566
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,948
You do not trust me?

567
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,035
I meant no offense.

568
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,214
Moment, please.

569
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,472
<i>I don't think he had anything.</i>

570
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,641
It was just an attempt at easy money.

571
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,579
You all right?

572
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:16,540
Yeah.

573
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,210
- It's gonna be a long night.
- Yeah.

574
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,754
Celia.

575
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,717
- You, too, Henry.
- Yeah.

576
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:31,054
So there's been another message.

577
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,348
Ahmed tells us that
one of the hijackers on the plane

578
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,475
was speaking in Russian on a cell phone.

579
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,893
Ilyas Shishani speaks Russian.

580
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:40,188
Yeah, well, you know, it...
it means something or it means nothing.

581
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:43,275
Ilyas was your source in Moscow, Henry.

582
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,569
Y-You want to tell me what happened?

583
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,195
Hmm? Back then?

584
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,782
All I know is you were transferred out.

585
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,662
It didn't end well, no.

586
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,039
Who was he handed off to?

587
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,046
He wasn't handed off to anyone.

588
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,882
What do you mean?

589
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:21,521
Ilyas was only
the second source I'd turned.

590
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,150
<i>He escaped Grozny in the '90s,</i>

591
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,611
<i>eventually put together
his own shop in Moscow.</i>

592
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,574
<i>He was a hard worker, a loyal husband.</i>

593
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:39,539
<i>Gave me an ear into the Chechen community.</i>

594
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,927
- How are you?
- How's the family?

595
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,720
- Good.
- Good.

596
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:57,515
<i>I'd built a relationship with him
based on trust.</i>

597
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,812
- It's ten degrees below zero...
<i>- I liked him.</i>

598
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,148
<i>He liked me. We liked each other.</i>

599
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:06,233
<i>He was a good man.</i>

600
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,776
Are you sure this can happen?

601
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,654
Of course. You have my word.

602
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,534
For me, the most important is my family.

603
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,206
When the Nord-Ost siege happened,
Putin dressed it up as the Russian 9/11,

604
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,874
and D.C. bought it.

605
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:26,586
<i>On our side, no one wanted to be
responsible for another Trade Center.</i>

606
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,296
These are extraordinary circumstances.

607
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,132
<i>And that's when the Russians
came to us saying they had evidence</i>

608
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,843
<i>of an imminent attack
on our embassy in Budapest.</i>

609
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,929
<i>But they wouldn't give it to us
without a trade-off.</i>

610
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,931
If there's a threat
to one of our embassies,

611
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,516
we got to know what that is.

612
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,060
Could mean the lives
of hundreds of our guys.

613
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,687
If the Russians want something from us...

614
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,650
<i>And the brass started
talking about giving up a source,</i>

615
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,777
and they landed on Ilyas.

616
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:54,531
<i>Look, uh, I know you spent</i>

617
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:55,991
a lot of time with the guy.

618
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,742
We... we all spend a lot of time

619
00:42:57,826 --> 00:42:59,327
building and maintaining
these relationships,

620
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,663
but their value to us
is in how they're used.

621
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:04,457
This is a bunch of fucking bullshit
is what it is!

622
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:09,379
We gave up a source?

623
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:12,757
My source.

624
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,303
Christ, Henry.

625
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,348
I didn't know this. I'm sorry.

626
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:24,102
All-all this time,
I've been thinking it was you

627
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,271
that fucked up in Moscow.

628
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:31,735
They traded me out in case the Russians
used Ilyas to get to me.

629
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,920
<i>He ended up in Tehran.</i>

630
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,632
<i>But he was never radical when I knew him.</i>

631
00:43:57,093 --> 00:44:01,556
<i>He trusted me, he was my source,
and we fed him to the Russians.</i>

632
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:16,613
You think you can find him?

633
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,408
We're wasting our time.

634
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:24,120
We need to get inside that plane
or give them what they want.

635
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,374
Yeah, well, um...

636
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:28,708
let me talk to Vick.

637
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:32,045
These people don't fuck around, Bill.

638
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,839
We do not want them
to lose their patience.

639
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:37,675
Henry, there's a process, okay?
Let me talk to Vick.

640
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,054
We'll see where
these fucking politicians are at.

641
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:46,393
Shit.

642
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:59,280
Hey.

643
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:01,825
It's okay.

644
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,499
It wasn't your fault.

645
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:15,255
It's so simple,

646
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,841
when you cut through all the lies
and the doublespeak,

647
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,342
but we take care of our own.

648
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,013
All those strangers, they're not us.

649
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,306
This is us.

650
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,607
I only ever want to be
responsible for you.

651
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,167
You know, I've been thinking.

652
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:55,879
Move in with me.

653
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,300
I know what kind of people we are.

654
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,429
I know we hold off and we're careful.

655
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:07,056
We wall ourselves off, but, uh...

656
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,769
I won't lose this. I can't.

657
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,233
I love you.

658
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:19,819
- Do you love me?
- Yeah.

659
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:46,054
Can I get you more wine?

660
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,348
I think I'm gonna try a red.

661
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,850
Would you like to see the wine menu?

662
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:52,352
- Whatever you recommend.
- I'll see what I can find.

663
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,436
Thanks.

664
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,232
Mmm.

665
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,235
You'll love this.

666
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:17,293
Say what you like about California,
the fish is fresh.

667
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,840
I don't touch land animals anymore.

668
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,384
You certainly enjoyed that bacon,
didn't you?

669
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:25,635
Yeah, 'cause you told me to live a little.

670
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:26,761
Live a little more.

671
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,180
I've lived plenty.

672
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,524
Uh, I'm so sorry.

673
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,442
It's okay.

674
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,863
We got it.

675
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:47,991
Excuse me.

676
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:05,008
This will soon be over.

677
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,720
Once our brothers have their freedom,
you will be given yours.

678
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,515
Brothers and sisters...

679
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:16,102
You are taking part in a great struggle
that comes from a place of love.

680
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:17,604
Love of Allah.

681
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:20,231
Love of our parents and children.

682
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:24,193
Grandfather, I know
you understand the situation.

683
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:31,826
There's been another message from Ahmed.

684
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,161
"Cancel the attack plan.

685
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,288
"They have a camera on the undercarriage.

686
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:36,706
"I do not know how,

687
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,000
"but it is clear
they know what they're doing.

688
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,210
"I suggest we give them
what they are asking for

689
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:43,630
or everyone will end up dead."

690
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,923
Jesus Christ.

691
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:48,259
How did they get a camera
on the outside of the plane?

692
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:51,763
All it takes is a baggage loader
to attach it to the hull.

693
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,222
Could've been done in Istanbul.

694
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:55,266
Has anyone seen this camera?

695
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,809
Hmm?

696
00:48:56,893 --> 00:49:00,647
The Austrians have had eyes
on that plane all day long.

697
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,024
Nobody saw anything out of the ordinary?

698
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,817
Just because we don't see it
doesn't mean it's not there.

699
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,653
- Jesus.
- And what do the Austrians say

700
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:08,071
about the message?

701
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,656
The Austrians don't know about Ahmed.

702
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,699
We're trying to keep it quiet.

703
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:14,577
There's a plane full of terrified people
whose lives are at risk,

704
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:17,246
and we can't tell the Austrians
about Ahmed.

705
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,123
It's Langley's call.

706
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,919
- Ernst?
- You know how it is.

707
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:25,380
We didn't vet the Austrians.

708
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,131
Celia's right.

709
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:29,550
We have to start sharing our intel.

710
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,682
<i>I remember
Bill left the office that evening</i>

711
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:38,267
<i>shortly after we got
Ahmed's third message.</i>

712
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,728
<i>You know why?</i>

713
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:44,107
<i>Sally had come down with
one of her passive-aggressive illnesses.</i>

714
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,820
I, uh... I have to go home.

715
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,697
I'll probably come back later.

716
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,448
- You'll call me, will you?
- I will.

717
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:54,158
I haven't had a chance to lock up.

718
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:56,327
Will you do that for me?
I'll see you later.

719
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:58,037
Good night, Bill.

720
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:02,709
<i>Sally was always his perfect excuse.</i>

721
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:08,089
<i>What are you saying?</i>

722
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,925
I'm sorry, are...

723
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,343
are you accusing me?

724
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:18,641
Do you know how many years of my life
I've given to my country?

725
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:19,851
Hmm?

726
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,061
The lies, the duplicity?

727
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:23,855
We all gave. Nobody forced you.

728
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,941
Yeah, well, you just take a look
at your future, huh?

729
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,359
This is what you end up with.

730
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:30,737
My balls are still firmly attached.

731
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,989
- Fuck you.
- How's Sally?

732
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:38,035
God, you fucking cunt.

733
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:41,581
How dare you accuse me?

734
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:45,168
Bill, when I accuse you of collaborating
with America's enemies, you'll know it.

735
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:48,254
There'll be two big guys behind you
holding on to your arms,

736
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,922
and we won't be in a fucking pub.

737
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:52,508
We'll be in a Romanian basement.

738
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:55,553
Yeah.

739
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,222
<i>So Bill left the office
to deal with Sally... when was that?</i>

740
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:01,976
Around 9:00, 9:30.

741
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,647
And you used his office after that?

742
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,239
What was everyone else doing?

743
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:18,117
<i>We were just trying
to stay on top of the situation.</i>

744
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:20,953
<i>Owen was doing his cyber work.</i>

745
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:24,540
<i>Ernst and Leila were talking
to their contacts.</i>

746
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:26,501
<i>Vick was briefing Washington.</i>

747
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,878
<i>And you?</i>

748
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:34,634
<i>I was going over the intel again
to see if there was anything we'd missed.</i>

749
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:49,023
<i>Sometimes wondered if Ilyas chose Vienna
because of you.</i>

750
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:53,402
Why would he do that?

751
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:55,029
I don't know.

752
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:57,865
To goad you?

753
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:01,786
I don't think Ilyas chose Vienna
because of a personal vendetta.

754
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:21,764
"Four attackers, two guns.

755
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:23,891
"Children in first class.

756
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:27,103
Suggest rear undercarriage attack."

757
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:39,115
"Cancel the attack plan.

758
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:42,076
They have a camera on the undercarriage."

759
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,248
"Lead hijacker on phone. Speaks Russian.

760
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,375
Don't know to translate."

761
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,883
"I do not know how,

762
00:52:56,966 --> 00:53:00,261
but it is clear
they know what they are doing."

763
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:03,472
"I do not know..."

764
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,144
"Don't know."

765
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:15,484
<i>Ahmed was our best shot
at getting those people out alive.</i>

766
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:17,278
But something wasn't right.

767
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,364
Of course we noticed
the difference between

768
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:22,325
Ahmed's last message and the first ones.

769
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,911
Uh, you know, complete sentences,

770
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:27,955
as if he suddenly had all the time
in the world for good grammar.

771
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:30,249
No one did anything?

772
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:33,252
Well, later on,
Vick called me into his office,

773
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:35,796
and we discussed the elephant in the room.

774
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,716
- Just the two of you?
- Yeah.

775
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,593
Yeah, we had to deal with the possibility

776
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:43,262
that this wasn't Ahmed
we were talking to anymore.

777
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:45,473
And if he'd been discovered,
who blew his cover?

778
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:49,435
Uh, not even the Austrians knew
he was in there.

779
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:51,228
Did you discuss it with Celia?

780
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:55,608
No, no. She had to be considered a suspect
along with everyone else.

781
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:58,569
There was an anomaly.

782
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:03,866
Ahmed told us the layout of the hostages,
suggested a plan of attack,

783
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:07,203
then suddenly his tone changed
and he was telling us to cooperate.

784
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:10,915
Maybe he realized
his attack plan wasn't gonna work.

785
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,291
It wasn't just that.

786
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:15,211
Why did he suddenly sound
like a different person?

787
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:18,798
Afterwards,
when headquarters sent counterespionage,

788
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,716
how did you explain it all to them?

789
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,801
I didn't.

790
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:25,137
No?

791
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:27,640
No. Well, there was no point.

792
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,142
It was done.

793
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:32,645
We'd failed.

794
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:36,816
If we started shouting "mole,"
that would've been it for all of us.

795
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:40,486
Did you suspect that someone
in our station had betrayed Ahmed?

796
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:44,365
Well, it couldn't have been the Austrians
because they didn't know he existed.

797
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:50,454
Is that why you asked for the phone logs?

798
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,093
What did you find?

799
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:11,267
Well, you looked over
those phone logs yourself.

800
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,727
Didn't you?

801
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:21,569
<i>Why was Celia looking at the phone logs?</i>

802
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,989
I didn't know she was.

803
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,242
That night,
right after you left the office.

804
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:31,078
What do you think she found?

805
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:36,667
I don't know.

806
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,795
I don't know. Why don't you tell me.

807
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,050
What would she do if she discovered

808
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:47,511
<i>the boss she adored had placed
some questionable calls</i>

809
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:49,597
<i>from his phone?</i>

810
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,393
<i>Calls to Iran.</i>

811
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:56,353
What?

812
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,566
<i>A direct call from your line</i>

813
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,651
<i>to a number in Tehran.</i>

814
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,906
<i>Half a minute long, 9:03 p.m.</i>

815
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:13,871
It boggles the mind that someone
so immersed in clandestine affairs

816
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,873
would make a call
from his own office phone,

817
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:19,543
but stupidity runs international relations
as much as anything else.

818
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:26,592
You're looking for a scapegoat. Hmm?

819
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:29,053
Anyone could've used my phone.

820
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:30,971
I mean, you could've used it yourself.

821
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:32,389
Huh? Celia?

822
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:33,557
Vick?

823
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:35,267
Let's not play the name game, Bill.

824
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:36,685
We don't do that. It's beneath us.

825
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:38,437
We look at the evidence.
We follow the facts.

826
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:40,773
Only two people had access
to your office phone,

827
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,234
so don't fuck around with me.

828
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:49,949
You do not want to end up
on the wrong side of my investigation.

829
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,121
So talk to me about Celia.

830
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,162
Yes?

831
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:40,332
Who's this?

832
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,147
Is the waitress all right?

833
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,440
Sir?

834
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,485
She seemed... I don't know... distraught.

835
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,821
Oh, she's fine.

836
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:12,865
Actually, she's two months pregnant.

837
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:13,949
Oh, that's amazing.

838
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:15,367
Yeah, morning sickness all day long.

839
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:16,535
Oh, poor thing.

840
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:18,162
Yeah, she's heading home early.

841
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:20,497
- But I'll take care of you from here.
- Hmm.

842
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,541
- Wish her well, then.
- Yeah, I'll do that.

843
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:31,091
Why don't you pin it on Owen Lassiter?

844
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:32,760
He killed himself after all.

845
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:36,055
<i>It was never explained, not really.</i>

846
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:41,268
A love affair that went bad,
but it went bad after 127.

847
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,854
Guilt destroys his relationship.

848
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:47,024
Guilt and loneliness destroy him.

849
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:50,653
It's a perfect little narrative,
and he's not around to defend himself.

850
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:55,115
His uncle sits on the Homeland Security
and Governmental Affairs Committee.

851
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:57,534
What about Ernst?

852
00:58:57,618 --> 00:58:59,912
<i>Ernst is advising the DDO.</i>

853
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,664
<i>He's beyond my reach.</i>

854
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:04,583
Mm, there's an easier patsy.

855
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,710
She was a regular at the mosque.

856
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:10,089
<i>She cried so much at the end.</i>

857
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:11,966
<i>Remember?</i>

858
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,470
And what about you?

859
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,099
Vick cleared me.

860
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,435
Really?

861
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:27,398
Look, I don't want to do this
any more than you do.

862
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,079
- Hey, did you see it?
- What happened?

863
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:43,580
This happened ten minutes ago.

864
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:44,915
They killed a passenger.

865
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,881
It's fucking brutal.

866
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,057
Take away your spy!

867
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:20,242
<i>It's the things
that we don't know that get to me.</i>

868
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,954
What happened inside that plane?

869
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,417
Can't let it go.

870
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:33,297
And what if I'd been
one of the passengers?

871
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:36,675
Would I have fought back?

872
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,352
And with Ginny and Evan,
the nightmares have become unbearable.

873
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,905
<i>In my dream, I'm paralyzed.</i>

874
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:04,787
<i>Grasping onto the hope
that if I do everything that they say...</i>

875
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,500
<i>...everything's gonna be all right.</i>

876
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,085
Children.

877
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,545
- All the children!
- Give me the children now!

878
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:16,799
Please don't hurt them.

879
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:18,425
- Please.
- The children are coming with me now.

880
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:19,927
- Please.
- Mommy!

881
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,303
Come on.

882
01:01:21,387 --> 01:01:22,596
Mommy!

883
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,349
No. Why are you taking them?

884
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,020
No crying.

885
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:35,734
<i>I never save them.</i>

886
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,127
I'm sorry.

887
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:25,242
What's the latest?

888
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,077
The attack's off.

889
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:29,621
The Austrians got scared
when Ahmed was killed.

890
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,542
Are they gonna release the prisoners?

891
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:36,420
Well, Merkel's flown her prisoners here,

892
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:39,840
but they're still insisting
on negotiations.

893
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:52,603
Where are you?

894
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:55,355
At home. Just about to leave.

895
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,024
Wait for me.

896
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:02,863
<i>There's one thing
I can't figure out about that night.</i>

897
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,951
We're at the station.

898
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:11,538
We're gonna move in together.

899
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:16,126
You look at the phone logs, Ahmed dies...

900
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:23,133
<i>...and then you come home to me.</i>

901
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:27,424
<i>The next morning, you left me.</i>

902
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,103
What we had was real.

903
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,358
Wasn't it?

904
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:48,820
I thought so.

905
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:54,076
Why did you run?

906
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:06,630
I think I preferred
this being an interrogation.

907
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,816
Well, you've convinced me.

908
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,111
Of what?

909
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,742
That you're very convincing.

910
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:48,922
Are you okay?

911
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:57,973
Be right back.

912
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,100
Everything going to plan?

913
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,108
Piccolo?

914
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:53,445
Treble.

915
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,364
What the fuck are you doing here?

916
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:58,450
Scouting the territory.

917
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:03,455
Oh, you mean how did I know who you were.

918
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,542
Everyone has their methods.

919
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:15,383
You look older up close.

920
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:17,385
You shouldn't be here.

921
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:21,223
Well...
they nearly didn't let me in.

922
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,558
Guess I'm not dressed well enough.

923
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:25,644
Almost had to make a scene.

924
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,607
So... we still on?

925
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,735
I don't know.

926
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:38,240
I'll clear it with you beforehand.

927
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,328
All you have to do is say yes or no.

928
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:36,464
Tell me about
the investigators from counterespionage.

929
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:40,802
They were dicks.

930
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:43,889
Well, what did they say
about the phone logs?

931
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:47,392
They didn't say anything.

932
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:51,813
When you told them about the logs, I mean.

933
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:57,652
I didn't tell them about the logs.

934
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:08,038
You suspected Ahmed had been betrayed,
you found a suspicious call...

935
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:13,209
...and you didn't tell headquarters?

936
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:18,381
You know what I thought
when I found that number in the logs?

937
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,888
I thought that
Bill had been selling us out.

938
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:30,518
I didn't understand why or how
he'd gotten roped into this mess.

939
01:10:33,188 --> 01:10:35,023
And then Ahmed was killed...

940
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:40,737
<i>...and I ran straight to you.</i>

941
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:47,911
They killed Ahmed.

942
01:10:51,373 --> 01:10:52,791
What?

943
01:10:54,209 --> 01:10:56,211
They shot him in the head.

944
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:02,676
Shit.

945
01:11:16,815 --> 01:11:17,816
Shit.

946
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:25,824
<i>We both know
that Bill didn't make that call.</i>

947
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:36,376
If not Bill, what, then?

948
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:31,723
All this diversion.

949
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,770
Do you really think
that it makes a difference?

950
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:41,316
What's wrong?

951
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,952
There's a clock on this.

952
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:56,081
And it's going to end.

953
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:01,127
We just do the best we can.

954
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:06,633
<i>You were the only one
who knew Ilyas from before.</i>

955
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,302
There's a plane full of terrified people,

956
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,679
and we can't tell the Austrians
about Ahmed.

957
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:13,932
<i>The only one with a connection.</i>

958
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:15,642
Ernst?

959
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:18,520
You know how it is.
We didn't vet the Austrians.

960
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:21,648
- Celia's right.
<i>- You knew this left you vulnerable,</i>

961
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:24,150
<i>so you planted this information</i>

962
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:26,820
<i>in case there was an investigation.</i>

963
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,064
You had no right.

964
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:09,779
All the fucking lies.

965
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:16,411
<i>Even between lovers.</i>

966
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:17,954
Are you okay?

967
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:22,208
Yeah.

968
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:38,516
I'll see you at the station.

969
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:49,986
<i>I saw the number on your phone.</i>

970
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:55,909
The last morning,
when you were in the shower.

971
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:12,133
120 people.

972
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,428
Children.

973
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,234
Who are you?

974
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:36,866
You know who I am, Ce.

975
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:45,291
Now is the time we send our message.

976
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:51,297
<i>You brought this upon yourselves.</i>

977
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:55,802
<i>We speak for all victims around the world.</i>

978
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:06,813
Just as your missiles continue
to strike our people...

979
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:09,357
<i>...we will strike back.</i>

980
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,111
No!

981
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,654
Follow up with headquarters!

982
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:16,155
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

983
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,949
...with the Austrians. I need to know...

984
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:21,286
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

985
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:30,753
The Austrians say they're dead.

986
01:16:30,837 --> 01:16:33,256
The hijackers, the passengers, crew.

987
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:34,465
Everyone.

988
01:16:34,549 --> 01:16:36,050
How do they know?

989
01:16:36,134 --> 01:16:38,177
About five minutes ago,
the Austrians got a message,

990
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:39,971
"Al-Da'irat does not negotiate."

991
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:43,641
They had hi-res cameras on the cockpit.

992
01:16:43,725 --> 01:16:46,227
Both pilots died in their seats.

993
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:47,395
Shot?

994
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:50,148
We believe they were suffocated.

995
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:54,110
Sarin. It's sarin gas.

996
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:57,655
We need to bring in doses
of atropine and pralidoxime now.

997
01:16:57,739 --> 01:17:01,075
No, no. W-We can't go in
until we know more.

998
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:02,660
So, what, we just let them die?

999
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:07,332
They just posted a video
from inside the plane on the Internet.

1000
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:20,803
When they were all killed,
I didn't know what to do.

1001
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,811
<i>Maybe you were innocent.</i>

1002
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:32,565
<i>Maybe that number
wasn't connected to Ilyas.</i>

1003
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:42,158
<i>I can't say that I believed it,
but I wanted to.</i>

1004
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:46,996
Because I loved you.

1005
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:54,796
<i>So I buried everything that I'd seen...</i>

1006
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:56,964
- Celia!
<i>- ...and I left.</i>

1007
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,564
And then eight years later,
you come after Bill?

1008
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:17,944
And me?

1009
01:18:23,074 --> 01:18:26,160
You would destroy my life...

1010
01:18:29,414 --> 01:18:31,332
<i>...to save your own.</i>

1011
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,243
Karl Stein?

1012
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,414
<i>This is Celia Favreau.</i>

1013
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:15,168
He's outside, third bench on the left.

1014
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:41,861
We got the restaurant.

1015
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:46,365
Flying in a waiter
and a bartender from D.C.

1016
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,452
A couple of guests, too.

1017
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:55,333
I don't know if I can do this.

1018
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:00,296
You came to us, Celia.

1019
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:03,883
You knew what it meant.

1020
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,720
Freddy will take care of it.

1021
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:12,850
Don't touch his wine glass.

1022
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:23,110
How do I know I'm out of this for good?

1023
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,989
Two independent sources, same story.

1024
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:28,282
Good enough for me.

1025
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:33,996
After this, I don't ever
want to hear from you again.

1026
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,249
- You have my word.
- Fuck your word.

1027
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:37,959
Just leave my family alone.

1028
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:25,047
Who's that?

1029
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,052
Henry, Henry, listen to me.

1030
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:34,223
They're gonna say that it was suicide.

1031
01:21:37,852 --> 01:21:40,146
You don't have much longer.

1032
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:52,867
Oh, wine country.

1033
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:02,710
I just don't understand why you did it.

1034
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,379
Why, Henry?

1035
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:11,719
I did it for you.

1036
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:19,143
Because I love you.

1037
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:23,189
I don't understand what you're saying.

1038
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:50,758
His name is Ilyas Shishani.

1039
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:52,718
We think he might be here in Vienna.

1040
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:55,513
People are gonna die, Tahar.

1041
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:57,390
I don't know this man.

1042
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,153
I'm sorry, chief.

1043
01:23:11,237 --> 01:23:12,738
I have a meet.

1044
01:24:21,432 --> 01:24:23,434
Henry.

1045
01:24:32,902 --> 01:24:34,236
Ilyas.

1046
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:50,044
It's been a long time.

1047
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,297
What are you doing here?

1048
01:24:54,215 --> 01:24:55,549
Come.

1049
01:25:37,925 --> 01:25:39,593
Remember Moscow, Henry?

1050
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:45,808
You spoke about trust so much
that I almost believe you.

1051
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:47,852
Are you behind it?

1052
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:49,895
The hijacking?

1053
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,939
You gave my name to the Russians.

1054
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:55,985
Spetsnaz.

1055
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:59,029
Tough men.

1056
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:06,161
For six months, I did not see the sun.

1057
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:10,332
I've been tortured.

1058
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:12,084
My leg.

1059
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:16,630
Broken and reset badly.

1060
01:26:20,301 --> 01:26:23,762
They call me a terrorist.

1061
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:28,225
Timid Ilyas,

1062
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:30,936
who breaks bread and...

1063
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,646
gives secrets to the Americans.

1064
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:43,449
What do you think this did to my daughter?

1065
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:50,039
She saw her father
beaten to a pulp, taken away.

1066
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:54,501
She didn't know if I was dead or alive.

1067
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,131
I searched for you. I couldn't find you.

1068
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:07,556
We fled to Iran.

1069
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:12,311
My daughter dies there.

1070
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:15,814
Only six.

1071
01:27:17,066 --> 01:27:19,443
Because they...

1072
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:21,612
don't have medicines.

1073
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:24,448
Why?

1074
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:28,243
American sanctions.

1075
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:46,428
Take out your phone and call your lover.

1076
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:50,015
Celia Harrison.

1077
01:27:51,141 --> 01:27:52,309
What?

1078
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:02,861
- Do it, please.
- Why?

1079
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:04,655
- Do it.
- What do you want from me?

1080
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:06,115
Do it!

1081
01:28:35,436 --> 01:28:37,688
Henry Pelham.

1082
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:40,107
She's with me.

1083
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,275
Listen.

1084
01:28:43,861 --> 01:28:45,112
Celia Harrison.

1085
01:28:46,113 --> 01:28:47,948
<i>As-salamu alaykum.</i>

1086
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,243
<i>Wa alaykum as-salaam.</i>

1087
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,581
I was told that you had
information about Flight 127.

1088
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:58,042
Ilyas, listen to me.

1089
01:28:58,125 --> 01:28:59,752
We can work this out, whatever you want.

1090
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:01,211
If you want money, I can get you that.

1091
01:29:01,295 --> 01:29:03,380
If you want immunity,
I can get you that, too.

1092
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:04,923
Calm down, Henry.

1093
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:06,759
Do you have information or not?

1094
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:09,428
I just want to make sure
you'll answer my questions.

1095
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,805
You do not trust me?

1096
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,349
I meant no offense.

1097
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:18,395
You will tell me
what Americans and Austrians know.

1098
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:21,356
You will tell me what they are planning.

1099
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,984
I-I can't do that.
I cannot do that, Ilyas.

1100
01:29:24,068 --> 01:29:25,569
We have her in a room, Henry.

1101
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:28,655
<i>We need power.</i>

1102
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:30,574
Power comes from money.

1103
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:35,412
When a man cannot get money power,
he will then reach for violent power.

1104
01:29:35,496 --> 01:29:37,164
Direct attack, undercarriage. Let her go.

1105
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:38,373
You agree?

1106
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:39,708
- Let her go.
- I know there is more.

1107
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:41,710
Let her go!

1108
01:29:41,794 --> 01:29:45,130
Tell me with your information
how much she's worth.

1109
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:05,609
I had to give him something.

1110
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,824
Ahmed's identity.

1111
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:19,832
I kept hoping they'd storm the plane,
that they'd...

1112
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:22,626
...release the prisoners.

1113
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:33,554
I made a choice, and I chose you.

1114
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:44,273
<i>Salaam alaykum.</i>

1115
01:30:49,236 --> 01:30:50,737
Life is so precious, Henry.

1116
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:19,057
They already had your name.

1117
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:21,435
Ilyas told them.

1118
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:25,480
I was just confirmation.

1119
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:35,407
I thought I had a chance.

1120
01:31:39,203 --> 01:31:41,788
That maybe we had a chance.

1121
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,585
All these years.

1122
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,547
I'm so tired.

1123
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:01,767
I'm sorry.

1124
01:32:06,313 --> 01:32:07,648
I love you.

1125
01:32:28,252 --> 01:32:29,670
You should go.

1126
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:30,921
No.

1127
01:32:31,004 --> 01:32:32,464
No, no.

1128
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:44,768
You should go.

1129
01:32:45,811 --> 01:32:47,521
Why didn't you tell me?

1130
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:49,940
Why didn't... why didn't you t...

1131
01:32:53,402 --> 01:32:54,611
I'm sorry.

1132
01:32:58,573 --> 01:32:59,866
It's okay.

1133
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:30,605
Don't touch me.

1134
01:34:07,017 --> 01:34:09,102
Piccolo.

1135
01:34:09,186 --> 01:34:10,645
Treble.

1136
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:12,397
I've got her.

1137
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,359
Right here in front of me.

1138
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:24,910
I can do this clean,
but it has to happen now.

1139
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,540
Should I proceed?

1140
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:35,629
Piccolo?

1141
01:34:52,312 --> 01:34:54,022
Was that a yes?

1142
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:59,444
Piccolo, I need a yes.

1143
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:22,926
It's done.

1144
01:36:24,237 --> 01:36:26,281
You're still up.

1145
01:36:30,911 --> 01:36:32,537
Let's get you to bed.

1146
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:37,375
Mommy, you're squeezing me.

1147
01:36:46,927 --> 01:36:48,178
