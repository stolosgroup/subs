20
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,041
<i>Thank you, Jim.
Our thanks to the launch team</i>

21
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,833
and everyone at the MTS program.

22
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,666
The crew is go for launch.

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,041
<i>Copy that.
We have a go for auto-sequence start.</i>

00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:11,166
<i>T-minus-15 seconds.
Stand by for terminal count.</i>

<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six.</i>

26

<i>Three, two, one, zero.</i>

<i>First-stage separation in three, two, one.</i>

29
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,833
<i>Good break. Good break.</i>

30
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,333
<i>Roger roll, </i>MTS.

31
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,125
<i>We should have a good
forward link now, </i>MTS.

32
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,041
Copy that. I'm seeing the same thing here.

33
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,791
<i>We're coming up
on second-stage separation.</i>

34
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,583
Copy, second-stage separation.

35
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,750
<i>Altitude is 70 kilometers.</i>

36

<i>One hundred and seventy kilometers
downrange.</i>

37
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,625
Hyperion, the main engines
are underperforming slightly.

38
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,416
- <i>Copy, main engines underperforming.</i>
- Good read.

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,541
<i>Stand by. We're consulting flight.</i>

40
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,541
Flip your visors down.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,851
We're past return to landing. Abort
complete reaching the end of Oceanic.

42
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:12,875
Abort?

43
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,333
Hyperion?

44
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,816
<i>That's a negative abort, </i>MTS.

45
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,875
<i>There's enough fuel
to handle the discrepancy.</i>

46
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,125
<i>Negative abort.</i>

47
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,875
Copy. Negative abort.

48
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,291
MTS, <i>you're leaving
for Mars Transfer Orbit.</i>

49
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,875
<i>Final systems nominal check.</i>

50
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,791
Are we a go?

51
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,208
Go.

52
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:48,958
Go.

53
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,041
Roger, Hyperion. We're ready.
Go for MTO burn.

54
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,333
<i>Roger that.
Enjoy the ride, everyone.</i>

55
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,666
<i>MTO in three, two, one.</i>

56
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,375
<i>That's negative return, </i>MTS.

57
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,083
<i>Past max Q.</i>

58
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,750
<i>Main engine cutoff, three, two, one.</i>

59
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,833
We go.

60
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,416
Um...

61
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,708
There she is.

62
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,750
MTS, <i>we're approaching
Kingfisher separation.</i>

63
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,625
Copy. Kingfisher separation.

64
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,291
<i>Separation is nominal.</i>

65
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,791
<i>The Kingfisher
is auto-docked to the </i>MTS.

66
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,000
<i>- Moving to taxi in now.</i>
<i>- Copy that.</i>

67
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,833
MTS, <i>what's the current closure rate?</i>

68
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,000
Closure rate is nominal.
Five centimeters per second.

69
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,791
<i>MTS </i>is in free drift.

70
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,416
Hang tight a bit.

71
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,750
Tethered gravity spin is starting.
You're a go, Hyperion.

72
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,375
Artificial gravity is climbing.

73
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,500
Looks like we'll hit close to five G's.

74
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,000
Tether's unspooling.

75
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,666
Solar array separation.

76
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,125
TDS nominal and at full speed.

77
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,041
All right. Plugs out.

78
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,666
Thank you for the launch, Jim.
See you again at the first check.

79
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,958
Are you kidding me? That was incredible!

80
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,583
- That was incredible!
- Okay.

81
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,750
- How are you feeling?
- I'm good. Good.

82
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,666
Let's go.

83
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,083
- I got it. Yeah.
- Oh. Thanks.

84
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,291
Oh, God.

85
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,976
Okay, Zoe, you take this one.
David, you start working in the back.

86
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,040
- This one?
- Copy.

87
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,541
- I'll be in the last wing.
- Copy that.

88
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,083
- Hey.
- Hey.

89
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,250
- How you feeling?
- Uh...

90
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,125
- You need anything?
- I'll be all right.

91
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,208
A beer?

92
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,708
So thoughtful.

93
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,791
This will help.

94
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,541
Thanks, Zo.

95
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,166
- Come on, Zo.
- What?

96
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,333
- Really?
- What are you...? I'm not...

97
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,458
Commander, how did she get Payloads
to allow this?

98
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,500
I don't even know anybody at Payloads,
so how would I...?

99
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,791
You wasted, what, 800 grams

100
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,458
of your allowable personal effects
on these?

101
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,916
- You don't even care about the rivalry.
- No. But you do, David.

102
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:18,916
Oh, it's so easy.

103
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Okay.

104
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,958
Five hours down...

105
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,000
two years to go.

106
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,416
As your doctor,
I'm telling you to drink that.

107
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,250
"Applicable"? "Applicable"?

108
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,638
- "Applicable" is British.
- Is it?

109
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,833
- How do I look?
- Stunning.

110
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,333
No. I'm serious. This is a big deal.

111
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,583
You look good. You look fine, seriously.
You look good.

112
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,416
Oh. Good.

113
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,041
Uh, yes, we do.
We read you loud and clear.

114
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,041
Welcome to <i>MTS-42.</i>

115
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,541
Oh, yeah. We did. Um...

116
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,875
It's not uncommon to experience
a few hiccups during the launch,

117
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,416
but due to the preparation
and expertise of our ground team,

118
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,583
we had a smooth rendezvous
with the MTS Cycler.

119
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,000
That's true. Um...

120
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,083
It's bittersweet.

121
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,625
I've had the honor of participating
in two missions to date.

122
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,500
<i>And I couldn't be working
with a more talented crew on this,</i>

123
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,625
<i>my final and third mission.</i>

124
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,666
Um... well, it's only been a few hours,

125
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,208
<i>but it's already
a life-changing experience.</i>

126
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,833
<i>I'm thrilled to be here.</i>

127
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,500
<i>This isn't where
I thought I would end up.</i>

128
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,708
<i>To me, my career was gonna be research
on Earth. </i>

129
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,916
<i>You never know
where life's gonna take you.</i>

130
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,208
Yes, I applied to the HARP program
because I thought

131
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,125
it would be a funny story
to be rejected by Hyperion.

132
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,666
<i>But now I realize
this is one of those rare opportunities</i>

133
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,583
<i>that could truly give my life meaning
beyond anything I could imagine.</i>

134
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:20,166
Well, space exploration has always led
to amazing medical discoveries

135
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,750
that are... applicable
to the people on Earth.

136
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,875
Well, uh, the launch was incredible.

137
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,625
It does take a little while
to get adjusted to the artificial gravity.

138
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,291
<i>Well, two years is a long time
to be away from my wife,</i>

139
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,083
but this
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

140
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,166
I am so grateful to have her support.

141
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,958
<i>My research is integral</i>

142
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,916
<i>to maintaining and sustaining life
on Mars long-term.</i>

143
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:59,791
<i>We are taking the first steps
to being able to call Mars a second home.</i>

144
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,583
Uh, no. No, not at all.

145
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:09,625
I mean, out of the thousands of proposals
submitted from university students

146
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,791
<i>and professors all around the world,
these two definitely rose to the top.</i>

147
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,000
<i>I'm more than confident in their ability
and their training.</i>

148
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,166
I know they can handle anything
that comes their way.

149
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,125
Oh, shit.

150
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,583
Oh, shit.

151
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,291
Commander!

152
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,166
Holy shit.

153
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,250
- Are you okay?
- Get him off! Get him off!

154
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,208
What is going on?

155
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,809
- Get him off!
- Are you okay?

156
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,875
- Is he alive?
- Just pull him up.

157
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,375
Get him off.

158
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,333
Stop. Let's get him to the infirmary.

159
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,250
I got him.

160
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,416
- Ready.
- Ready? One, two, three.

161
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,083
- Here?
- Yeah.

162
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:18,791
That's good.

163
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,583
- Who the hell is this?
- Come on.

164
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,291
- David, put some gloves on.
- Copy.

165
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,291
<i>Hold that closed.</i>

166
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,666
- Just hold it as closed as you can.
- Wow.

167
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:03,791
That's great.

168
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,958
<i>The damage is contained
to the functional module.</i>

169
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,791
<i>A significant amount of atmospheric O2
vented from the MTS.</i>

170
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,208
There's a breach in the hull.
Getting all this?

171
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,333
Good.

172
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,958
Hey, Jim. Who the fuck is on my ship?

173
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah. He's still unconscious,
but I mean... is he a threat?

174
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,625
Do we need to, I don't know, find a way

175
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,833
to restrain him or...?

176
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,000
Any idea if he'll wake up?

177
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,500
Honestly, I'm surprised he's still alive.

178
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,166
His name is Michael Adams.

179
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,210
All they know for now
is that he's launch support.

180
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:06,041
- How the hell was he missed?
- They're looking into it.

181
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,000
We don't make mistakes like this.

182
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,003
- Did he stow away on purpose?
- Hyperion doesn't know that yet.

183
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,960
How are you not screaming in pain
right now?

184
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,750
It... hurts.

185
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,083
This is pretty serious.

186
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:29,333
- How long?
- To be safe, six weeks at least.

187
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,291
- CO2 is up 2 percent.
- How?

188
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,291
The CDRA is turned off.

189
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,708
We shut down the entire functional module,
including life support.

190
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,208
Let's get started
on the lithium-hydroxide canisters.

191
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,291
Yeah. Roger.

192
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,791
The breathing masks in the exercise room
are attached to the CDRA, as well,

193
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:10,125
so let's just hold off on exercise
till we sort this out.

194
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,666
- Copy.
- Copy that, commander.

195
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,791
We're good to go.

196
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,666
Oh, fuck.

197
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,083
Ahh. Jeez.

198
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,708
Hey. Sit down.

199
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,151
- Did we take off?
- Hey, sit down.

200
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,416
- Did we take off?
- Sit down or you're gonna pass out.

201
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,083
- Did we...?
- Hey, you're okay.

202
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,833
- Did we take off? No, no, no.
- Listen. You're fine. You're safe. No.

203
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:42,875
- You're safe. You're fine. Commander!
- No, no. Did we take off? Did we take off?

204
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,285
Okay, let's take deep breaths.
Take deep breaths.

205
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,093
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

206
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,458
Just like I'm doing. Great. Michael?

207
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,708
It's Michael, right? Michael, I'm Zoe.
I'm a doctor.

208
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,958
I want you to focus
on slowing down your breathing.

209
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:59,708
Just nice and slow. Okay?
I'm gonna check your stitches.

210
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,184
- Is that okay?
- Stitches?

211
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,684
- Nice and slow. Nice and slow.
- What?

212
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,934
You got injured during the launch
just on your side here.

213
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:05,833
- Is that okay?
- Uh-huh.

214
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:08,083
I'm just gonna take a look. Ready?
All good.

215
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:09,958
Okay.

216
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,083
That's great.

217
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,125
Okay. You're good. You're good.

218
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:19,458
Just nice and slow.
Slow your heart rate down.

219
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,333
- Okay?
- Yeah.

220
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,416
- Okay.
- Great.

221
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,351
- Sorry.
- No. You're okay.

222
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,708
It's okay. Hi. Hi, Michael.
I'm Marina Barnett.

223
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:31,500
I'm the commander of the ship.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

224
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,958
No. No, I don't mind.

225
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,291
- Do you work for Hyperion?
- Yes.

226
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:43,250
- I'm a launch support engineer, ma'am.
- Okay.

227
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,750
And do you remember what happened
on the pad?

228
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:51,208
Uh... Yes. I was, um...

229
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:54,166
I was, uh...

230
00:25:55,458 --> 00:26:00,250
I was arming the second-stage firing pins,
and I thought I was...

231
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,541
I thought I was buckled in and, um...

232
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,583
- No.
- You've had a concussion. This is normal.

233
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,791
- This is fine.
- I thought I was clipped in.

234
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,395
It's okay if you don't remember.

235
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:14,750
How long was I...?

236
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:15,833
How long was I out?

237
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,250
We took off about 12 hours ago.

238
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:23,625
Twelve hours.

239
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:30,458
- I need to get back to my sister. Please.
- No.

240
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:33,875
- She's alone. I gotta get back.
- Michael. I hear you, Michael,

241
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,166
- but we're not going back.
- What do you mean?

242
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,958
- This is a two-year mission. Please.
- I understand.

243
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:41,083
- I need to get back. Now.
- Michael. Nice and slow.

244
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,041
We're moving too fast.
We don't have enough fuel to turn around.

245
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,625
- I gotta get back home.
- I understand. I do.

246
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:49,875
Let me go and relay this to Hyperion.
I'm just gonna be a few minutes. Okay?

247
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,958
I'll be right back. Okay?

248
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:53,142
- Yeah.
- Stay here.

249
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,726
- Yes, commander.
- We're gonna figure this out, okay?

250
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,351
And I just need you to keep breathing
while we figure it out. Okay?

251
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,958
Can you just do that?
Slow that breathing back down.

252
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:13,541
<i>He's stable.</i>

253
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:16,666
He just needs some time alone to rest
and process everything.

254
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:18,875
Copy.

255
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:22,416
- Do you need a hand?
- No, I'm fine.

256
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:12,083
Michael.

257
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,309
- Hey.
- Hey.

258
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,916
- Let me give you a hand.
- I'm good.

259
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,958
- You okay?
- All right.

260
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,333
Is that all right?

261
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:22,791
- Good?
- Yeah.

262
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:23,958
I'm good. Thanks.

263
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,333
- Yeah?
- Yes.

264
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:29,833
So, Michael, Hyperion talked
to your sister. She's okay.

265
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:33,291
They're gonna be hiring her
a full-time guardian

266
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,750
and covering every expense.

267
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:37,666
Thank you.

268
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:42,500
These are yours. The mission director
wants to give you some more details

269
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,263
when we're up for live comm tomorrow,
so...

270
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:48,791
Okay. Um...

271
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,000
Thank you. Uh...

272
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:56,750
I actually came down here 'cause I had
a couple things I wanted to say.

273
00:28:57,583 --> 00:29:00,916
- Uh... do you mind?
- No, please.

274
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Um...

275
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,250
First off...

276
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,958
I just want to apologize
for that freak-out I had back there.

277
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:14,000
It was just kind of a shock
to... wake up here.

278
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:18,416
Thank you.

279
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,250
Of course.

280
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,500
Also, I'm not gonna just sit around.

281
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:27,708
I know the ship is small
and it's a lot smaller now that I'm here.

282
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:31,458
And I'm sure there's some grunt work
to be done. And I can learn fast.

283
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,875
I can do... whatever it takes.

284
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:37,583
Thank you, Michael. I appreciate that.

285
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:41,708
We're waiting on Hyperion
to tell us what to do next.

286
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:45,083
But in the meantime, if you're up to it,

287
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:48,000
perhaps Zoe can run you
through the safety procedures.

288
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,083
Yeah.

289
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,166
Um...

290
00:29:55,083 --> 00:30:00,125
We're sorry you missed the fillet mignon,
but... this is the next best thing.

291
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,666
We think it's spaghetti.

292
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,416
I should warn you now that Zoe thinks
she's the in-flight entertainment.

293
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,875
Understood.

294
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,250
You're David Kim, right?

295
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:13,250
- Uh, just David's fine.
- Got it.

296
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,208
So you're in school?

297
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:18,416
Yeah. Working on my master's
in structural engineering.

298
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:20,916
Were you working on a proposal
for HARP?

299
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,640
I actually plan on putting
something together for the next mission.

300
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,791
I'm not sure you need to apply anymore.

301
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:32,291
Yeah. I guess not.

302
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,708
Um... cheers. Welcome to <i>MTS-42.</i>

303
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:39,166
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

304
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,375
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

305
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:51,750
I don't know. It really doesn't feel
like he's here on purpose.

306
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,083
Agreed. So, what do we do?

307
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,623
I mean, I think he should keep busy.
I just don't...

308
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,228
I don't think I have anything for him.

309
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:07,250
Well, maybe I could have him do
some data entry for me.

310
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,250
It'd actually be nice
to have some company.

311
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,416
Yeah, that works.

312
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,958
- What?
- Uh...

313
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,958
You're gonna have to share credit
on whatever you publish.

314
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,666
- It's not about the credit, Zo.
- Okay.

315
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:32,835
Well, you're a better person than I am,
David Kim.

316
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:34,833
That's for sure.

317
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,833
- Okay. That's a plan, then?
- It's a plan.

318
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,583
- All right. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

319
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,625
Try not to snore too loud tonight.

320
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:50,351
For the night, when lights are dimmed,
they have to stay dimmed.

321
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,142
- It's a power-consumption thing.
- All right.

322
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:55,000
And if there's a catastrophic failure
in a single module,

323
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,291
like fire or rapid depressurization...
Watch your head.

324
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,321
...you have to close this hatch.

325
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,458
So bye-bye, David.

326
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,541
This is the magnetic radiation-proofing.

327
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:07,208
In case there's a solar storm,
come in here.

328
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,921
I realize your first visit
was a little intense,

329
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,625
but this happens to be my favorite spot
on the ship.

330
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Wow.

331
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:33,791
Pictures don't do it justice.

332
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:35,666
No. Not at all.

333
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,041
What's your sister's name?

334
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:52,875
- Ava.
- Yeah.

335
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,791
And it's just the two of you?

336
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:04,875
- Yeah.
- Mm.

337
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:10,791
Okay, well, this is Batch 62.

338
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,250
Batch 62.

339
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,625
And we'll start with Row 4.

340
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:15,708
Row 4.

341
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,708
Row 4A will be...

342
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,333
10.23.

343
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:28,958
Section B...

344
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:35,416
What?

345
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:36,958
I'm sorry.

346
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:38,916
I've gotta ask.

347
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40,375
Like...

348
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,416
what is this?

349
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,166
I mean, what are we listening to?

350
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,416
- What, you don't listen to jazz at all?
- No.

351
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,666
I mean, not really.

352
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,916
Actually, my wife is the one
that got me into jazz, but now I love it.

353
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:57,958
Section B is...

354
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:01,041
2.16.

355
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,791
Two point one six.

356
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,208
Yeah. Research can get
a little bit monotonous at times.

357
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,000
You know, especially phycology, but...

358
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,791
these guys, they keep me on my toes.

359
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:13,291
You know, Sanders, Coltrane, Bird.

360
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,916
Ah. They're like basketball players or...

361
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,208
Yeah, they're basketball players.
No, they're not.

362
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,458
These guys are jazz legends of the '60s.

363
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,458
Right, I knew that. I just... That's...

364
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:28,500
There. You hear how it's unpredictable?
But it still has rules.

365
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,983
They're generally playing together,

366
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,333
but once in a while,
a player or two will drift off

367
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:33,576
into their own little groove.

368
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,250
There. You hear it?

369
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,958
No. I don't.

370
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,208
- Okay.
- It's like it sounds like a hot mess.

371
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:48,083
Oh, well, that's what I like about it.
It's not obvious.

372
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:53,083
And, I mean, sometimes it can be
a little bit unpleasant.

373
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,541
- But it's pure expression.
- Hmm.

374
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:00,875
- And it usually finds a balance.
- Nice. I can dig that.

375
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:04,625
Okay.

376
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,708
Section C, 9.86.

377
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,175
<i>How's it looking in there?</i>

378
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,000
The whole left side came loose.

379
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,458
- Okay, remove the cover.
<i>- Roger.</i>

380
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:03,500
Carefully.

381
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,583
Copy.

382
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,333
Oh, shit.

383
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,208
<i>- What?</i>
- There must have been a short.

384
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:16,958
<i>On the desiccant bed?</i>

385
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:19,666
Yeah.

386
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:21,916
The whole thing is charred.

387
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,333
Take another picture.

388
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,250
Are we all set?

389
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,458
Hyperion, this is <i>MTS. </i>Come in.

390
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:04,916
Yes. We have
a damaged life-support assembly.

391
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,750
I need you to inspect
the incoming images of the CDRA.

392
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:14,416
It's critical that this gets fixed, Jim.
Mission critical.

393
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:18,041
Yeah. Going off comm.

394
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:37,583
David, can I speak to you?

395
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:39,791
- Of course.
- Michael, can you put on David's suit?

396
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:41,555
Zoe will explain what she needs you to do.

397
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:42,750
Yeah, sure. Of course.

398
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,541
- Yes, commander?
- Uh...

399
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,750
How much O2 does your rack produce?

400
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,916
I mean, 90 liters a day.
Just a negligible amount.

401
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:29,041
Is there any way you can get it up to 950?

402
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,375
- Nine fifty?
- Yeah.

403
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,625
No. Not with microgreens.

404
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:34,828
We're testing food production here,
not scrubbing CO2.

405
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,675
I thought that's what your research
was about.

406
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:40,250
Yeah, but that's with algae,
and that can only be opened on Mars.

407
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,666
Well, how much oxygen
would your algae produce?

408
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:45,000
Um...

409
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,708
approximately...

410
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,301
I could come close
to what you're looking for

411
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,833
under the right conditions,
but all the gear I'd need

412
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:55,250
was already flown to Mars
on the last unmanned.

413
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,166
What are we up against here?

414
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:01,583
Did we lose the CDRA?

415
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:04,708
We don't know for sure yet.

416
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:11,125
Uh... okay.
Um... what about the backup canisters?

417
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:13,000
We don't have enough.

418
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:18,166
Shit, is there anything?
Anything else you can try?

419
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,916
I could try growing them here,

420
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,500
but we would risk
ruining the entire culture.

421
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:26,458
All right. Uh...

422
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:32,375
Okay, if I use half of the algae,
it could probably still leave me enough

423
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:33,658
for a starter culture on Mars.

424
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:36,708
Okay, good. Just put everything else aside
and focus on that.

425
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:38,333
Yes, commander. Uh...

426
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,916
I need a little bit
to figure everything out.

427
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Okay, copy.

428
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:45,625
Oh, and, David?

429
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:50,000
Zoe and Michael are removing the CDRA.
They don't need to know this yet.

430
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,791
- Comm check.
- Yeah. I can hear you.

431
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,416
No. When I say "comm check,"
say "good check."

432
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:04,666
Okay.

433
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:06,625
- Comm check?
- Good check.

434
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:10,301
I'm gonna depressurize
the antechamber.

435
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:18,250
When we get in there, everything's normal.

436
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:22,000
There's gonna be no air, but everything's
gonna be normal other than that.

437
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,458
No floating around, just...

438
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,125
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm good.

439
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:26,886
- You're just reading instructions.
- Right.

440
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:59,083
- What's first?
- Um...

441
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:02,541
Got to, uh, unscrew the absorbent bed.

442
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,458
It's those screws on the other side.

443
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:37,750
So, what does this thing do?

444
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,875
It scrubs the carbon dioxide
out of the air.

445
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
You take that.

446
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:58,059
- <i>Ready?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm ready.</i>

447
00:42:58,083 --> 00:42:59,958
Here we go.

448
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,625
Careful with that.

449
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:04,708
Very, very careful.

450
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,333
- Okay.
- Whew.

451
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:22,458
I will never get used to how
little material is between us and space.

452
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,458
That I know.

453
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:27,375
When they started adding
a third passenger,

454
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:30,578
to make up for the weight, they made
the functional module almost half the size

455
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:32,791
and removed a protective layer
of shielding.

456
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,291
Hey, that's not helpful.

457
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:37,846
- Just facts.
- Not a helpful thing to say.

458
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:39,333
It's just facts.

459
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,708
- Oh, I'll take that.
- Yeah.

460
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,683
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

461
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:53,416
Okay.

462
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:58,625
- Michael?
- Mm-hm?

463
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,791
Ah, shit.

464
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:11,833
- You got it?
- Mm-hm.

465
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:15,375
Yeah, that's great.

466
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:24,125
Okay, a little pinch here.

467
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:31,416
Thanks.

468
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,041
I mean, it's literally my job.

469
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:36,041
Not just for this.
You've just kind of gone out of your way

470
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:38,250
- to make me feel welcome, so...
- Of course.

471
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:43,375
Okay. Um... can you take this off?

472
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:45,958
- My shirt?
- Yeah.

473
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:00,250
- Can you put your arm up?
- Yeah.

474
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:01,333
Thank you.

475
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:05,083
Okay.

476
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:38,500
- How's it coming?
- We're still wrapping up, but I'm worried.

477
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:43,625
I'm worried we're only gonna be able
to get to 500, maybe 550 liters a day.

478
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:46,416
Oh, no. That's good.
That's literally half of what we need.

479
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,375
So let's go ahead
and thaw out the second batch of algae.

480
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,625
No. I'd need to rip up the microgreens
for that.

481
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,828
- Then let's do it.
- Wait a minute, hold on, hold on.

482
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,458
The algae is far from thriving.

483
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,333
It's scrubbing only a fraction of what
I could get if I had the right equipment.

484
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:05,583
Using the second half of the batch doesn't
necessarily mean it'll double the output.

485
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:09,083
It's imperative that we try.

486
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,958
Commander,
this can't be something we rely on.

487
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:14,083
These batches can die at any moment,

488
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:16,375
and I could lose everything
I need for Mars.

489
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:24,083
Commander...

490
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,875
this research is years of my life.

491
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:28,666
We both know how important it is.

492
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:32,333
Are we sure we want to throw it all away

493
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:34,708
while we still have a chance
to fix the CDRA?

494
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:39,458
Um...

495
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:45,750
There is no chance, David.

496
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:49,291
It's gone.

497
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:55,375
Understood.

498
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:18,416
Ava. Hey. I hope you're treating
the people at Hyperion really nicely,

499
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,666
'cause I heard that they are moving
you closer to school, which is nice.

500
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:24,875
Really nice.

501
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:27,625
Make sure you send me some selfies
when you can, okay?

502
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,958
I'm really getting my groove here.

503
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,875
<i>I thought at first
I was probably gonna be a burden</i>

504
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:38,041
<i>to, you know, the crew and everyone here,</i>

505
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:40,666
<i>but they're actually putting me to work.</i>

506
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:44,666
<i>I hate that it happened this way.</i>

507
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:48,166
<i>But I'm thinking
that this might actually turn out</i>

508
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:52,916
<i>to be best for me
and for us in the long run.</i>

509
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:22,791
Correct. Unfortunately,
none of the second batch survived.

510
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:30,875
That was my fear.

511
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:37,875
You sure?

512
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:51,000
And why is the climb up
not an option again?

513
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,458
Okay, you've got to level with me, Jim.

514
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,750
Is there...?

515
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,333
Is there any way I can take his place?

516
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:17,833
Because Hyperion can orbit the capsule
around Mars

517
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:20,750
and send up a pilot from the colony.
But I... How can I...?

518
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:23,375
How do you expect me to...?

519
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,500
Yeah. Okay, well, I...

520
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,416
I need you to walk me
through every option.

521
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,208
Every single possibility.

522
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:01,541
Uh... I, uh...

523
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:04,791
I, um...

524
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,583
There's no easy way to say this. Um...

525
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:16,500
The carbon-dioxide scrubber
is damaged permanently.

526
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:21,875
The lithium-hydroxide canisters were only
ever meant to be a temporary solution.

527
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:26,958
We only have enough oxygen on board
for two people.

528
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,958
I've asked David
to accelerate his research.

529
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:37,041
He's managed to get his algae
to produce enough for one more.

530
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:39,958
So... Um...

531
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:44,291
What are you saying?

532
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,083
We can't make it to Mars
with Michael on board.

533
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:54,250
We'll end up asphyxiating
on carbon dioxide

534
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:55,708
a few weeks before we land.

535
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:57,666
I mean...

536
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:02,500
this ship.
Yeah, it was overbuilt for two.

537
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:04,916
And Hyperion started to take a chance
pushing it to three,

538
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,200
but it just can't handle four.

539
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,500
Okay.
I've been thinking about this.

540
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:14,166
And all we gotta do
is get to the colony on Mars, right?

541
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:16,416
Then CO2 isn't the issue.

542
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,541
We could just vent it out
and lower the atmospheric pressure.

543
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:22,833
What we need is oxygen. I don't know,

544
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:26,583
we could use the pre-breathing
oxygen cylinders. Or water.

545
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:28,750
We could just split oxygen out of that.

546
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:32,500
We don't have enough.
That would buy him days, not months.

547
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:36,958
Um, maybe a resupply mission?
If it was unmanned?

548
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:39,916
We're moving too fast for a resupply.

549
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,416
The Kingfisher's
the biggest rocket they can build.

550
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,958
Okay, but there's a giant tank up there
that was full of liquid oxygen

551
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:49,125
for the launch.
There must be something left.

552
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,767
Well, there's no way to tell from here.

553
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:53,291
We can't just reel in the tethers
with the Kingfisher attached.

554
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,416
Okay, so we climb up and check.

555
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,083
Climb the tether? All the way?

556
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,041
- That's 450 meters.
- It wouldn't be full...

557
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:01,083
Look, Michael was on board
when we launched,

558
00:53:01,166 --> 00:53:03,375
so he used up extra oxygen and fuel.

559
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:05,675
Okay? We barely had enough
to make it to here.

560
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:10,208
Climbing up would mean
risking damaging the solar panels,

561
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:12,541
severing the power cables,
even falling off the ship.

562
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:13,916
Hyperion looked into it.

563
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:16,708
It's just I can't risk both of your lives

564
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:19,166
for the possibility
that you could save him.

565
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:24,583
There must be something we can do.
Anything.

566
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:27,000
Guys, this is not a call for a solution.

567
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:30,642
The entirety of Hyperion is down there
trying to figure this out.

568
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,142
I'm only telling you because I need you
to be mentally prepared

569
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:34,375
for what's gonna happen.

570
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,583
So how much time does he have left?

571
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,541
I'll talk to him today. I'll...

572
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:52,083
- give him a few days.
- No, um, hold on.

573
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:55,791
You're gonna talk to him today? What...?

574
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:58,166
What are we gonna do,
ask him to walk out of the airlock?

575
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:00,666
I mean, okay.

576
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:04,583
Exactly how much time do we have
before it's too late?

577
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:08,083
Technically, 20 days.

578
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:10,250
Okay. Then we should take that time.

579
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:12,541
No, we need as much
of that margin of error as possible

580
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:14,767
- in case anything else happens.
- Margin of error?

581
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:17,916
What hypothetical situation could be worse
than the one we're in right now?

582
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,375
Worst-case scenario is he still dies,
but we die along with him.

583
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,958
- How?
- What's left of the algae

584
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:25,041
is hanging on by a thread as it is.

585
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:27,750
So you're fine just giving up on a person
because the risk...?

586
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:30,083
Zoe, realistically,
every day he's still here,

587
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,875
it's a danger to all of us.

588
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:35,625
I am telling you,
Hyperion has anyone with a PhD down there

589
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:37,916
- trying to work this out.
- And they're not here!

590
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,208
And maybe we can think
of something that they haven't!

591
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:41,333
They built the ship.

592
00:54:42,166 --> 00:54:45,184
They have one-to-one replicas of the <i>MTS.</i>
They know every inch of this place.

593
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:48,448
- They didn't know Michael was in here.
- Come on, Zoe. That's not the same thing.

594
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:51,416
Twenty days? Commander, I mean...

595
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:55,083
if there's really nothing we can do,

596
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,625
we have to take someone's life.

597
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:10,125
Is it unreasonable to just take that time
and make sure we've gone over everything?

598
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:20,250
Ten days. That's it.

599
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:23,476
- Commander, with all...
- No. We can spare ten days.

600
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,250
Okay. Okay.

601
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:27,750
Um, and what do we tell Michael
in the meantime?

602
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,291
Look, we were chosen to be here.

603
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,750
We've been trained psychologically
and otherwise.

604
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:34,875
He hasn't.

605
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,833
He can't contribute to any of this
in any meaningful way,

606
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:40,636
so I think the best course of action
is to just keep this between us.

607
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:43,023
- Understood?
- Yes, commander.

608
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:45,083
David?

609
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:48,166
Yes.

610
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:50,625
Understood.

611
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:25,791
So how is your new assignment coming?

612
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:31,083
It's fine.

613
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:38,708
Okay.

614
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,833
Jim? For their sanity,
they need to try this.

615
00:56:49,166 --> 00:56:51,541
What are you talking about?
The mission is shot!

616
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,583
We have a...

617
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:59,125
We have a five-month trip there,
plus the trip back.

618
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,958
I still need this crew
to be able to perform critical tasks.

619
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:06,000
No, they cannot do that
if they are devastated by guilt.

620
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:15,291
Well, I'm taking the ten days.

621
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,208
Commander, it's been three days.

622
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:53,375
Is Hyperion still trying
to figure something out?

623
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:56,083
Yep.

624
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:04,791
Go ahead.

625
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:15,166
Wouldn't they already know
if there were some way to save him?

626
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:22,458
I know how you feel,
but it's not the directive at the moment.

627
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:30,791
We're endangering ourselves.

628
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
The longer we take, the harder it'll be
when we're forced to take the final step.

629
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,833
- Put your arm up.
- Sure.

630
00:59:27,416 --> 00:59:28,791
I was in an apartment fire.

631
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:33,333
I was, um...

632
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:36,541
I was 9 years old.

633
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:42,041
I guess it had happened
in the place below us.

634
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,458
And I was sharing a room with Ava.

635
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:46,041
She was...

636
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,625
just a baby.

637
00:59:53,291 --> 00:59:54,666
It got pretty bad in there.

638
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:58,458
Just before our dad managed to...

639
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:00,500
get us out.

640
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:04,583
That's brave.

641
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:08,875
Yeah.

642
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:11,708
Then, um...

643
01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:14,666
he didn't make it?

644
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:17,958
Nah.

645
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:25,083
Ava and I,
we bounced around a lot after that.

646
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:28,833
Yeah. But we always stuck together.

647
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:31,458
She gave me this bracelet.

648
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:33,041
Sweet.

649
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,375
Yeah. That's me.

650
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:37,333
And that's her.

651
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:38,666
That's cute.

652
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:42,750
You know I actually became
her legal guardian?

653
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:50,083
That's why it's like so hard

654
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:52,416
for me to not be there for her.

655
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:58,208
Can you talk?

656
01:02:58,541 --> 01:02:59,541
Hey.

657
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,500
Yeah, sure, man.

658
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,166
I have something very difficult
to tell you.

659
01:03:10,041 --> 01:03:11,041
Okay.

660
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:14,875
The CDRA is destroyed beyond repair.

661
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,000
And even with every safety measure
we have,

662
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:21,791
there is no way for all of us to survive.

663
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:26,750
We've known for three days now.

664
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:31,750
Hyperion has had people working around
the clock on the problem since then.

665
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:36,791
Zoe, the commander and I...

666
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:41,416
we tried everything we could
to figure out a way.

667
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,333
But mathematically...

668
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:49,583
with you here...

669
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:53,791
everyone on board would suffocate
before we ever made it to Mars.

670
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:02,166
Every day you're with us
presents a danger to the crew...

671
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:05,250
and to the entire mission.

672
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:10,625
Look, I have to be honest, I, uh...

673
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:15,916
I was explicitly forbidden
to tell you any of this.

674
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:19,958
Why?

675
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:27,333
Zoe convinced Barnett to exhaust
our safety margins to try and save you.

676
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,875
To try and figure something out.

677
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:36,750
Isn't there anything we can figure out?

678
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:41,875
- Is there?
- No.

679
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,166
Hyperion would already know by now.

680
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:00,416
This would be painless.

681
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:08,916
And you would just fall asleep.

682
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:18,958
I'm sorry, Michael.

683
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:48,541
Hey, Ava.

684
01:06:53,083 --> 01:06:56,166
I know this transition
hasn't been the easiest for you.

685
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,583
And as hard as it is for me to know that,

686
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:01,750
I gotta face the fact

687
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:05,083
that I'm not gonna be there
with you every step of the way.

688
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
But you're tough.

689
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:11,875
Tougher than I'll ever be.

690
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:18,333
<i>You know, I met
some really incredible people here.</i>

691
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:20,250
<i>I mean, they're smart...</i>

692
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:21,958
<i>caring...</i>

693
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:24,208
<i>driven.</i>

694
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,500
<i>They're the best at what they do.
And I see so much of you in them.</i>

695
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:38,250
I gotta go, but, um...

696
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:41,958
...I love you.

697
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:56,875
Michael?

698
01:07:58,583 --> 01:07:59,583
Are you okay?

699
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:18,625
Michael?

700
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,708
You don't have to do this.

701
01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:39,041
There's nothing else to do.

702
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:41,166
We don't know that.

703
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:48,041
Look, I know you fought for me, okay?

704
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:51,875
But this is different.

705
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:55,625
This is...

706
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,750
It's hopeless, you know?

707
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:04,166
It isn't.

708
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:22,708
Can I tell you something?

709
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:27,083
This happened like 12 years ago.

710
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:28,916
I had this summer job.

711
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:33,500
I was supposed to be just keeping an eye
on this beach.

712
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:35,541
I wasn't a lifeguard. Just a watch.

713
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:38,726
'Cause there were signs all over the sand
that said "No swimming."

714
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,458
I mean, they said "Danger: no swimming."

715
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:45,875
So, I just thought
I was gonna read all day.

716
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:48,083
And...

717
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:54,416
uh, there were these drunk guys that would
always hang out by this bonfire nearby.

718
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:00,333
And I see a guy in the water.

719
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:02,375
And his buddies won't wake up

720
01:10:02,458 --> 01:10:05,458
and they're passed out on the sand,
and he's just...

721
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,125
quietly drowning...

722
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:12,250
by himself out there.

723
01:10:13,875 --> 01:10:16,291
And immediately I call it in,
and I don't get a response.

724
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,250
And...

725
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,833
I mean, the tides are strong.

726
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:33,791
And I jump in, and when I get to him
I'm already exhausted.

727
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:37,375
And I'm trying to keep his head
above the water.

728
01:10:37,458 --> 01:10:41,458
And I'm there for five minutes,
and I'm in longer and longer.

729
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:47,625
Then I start to lose him.

730
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:50,333
And...

731
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,708
suddenly I feel myself being pulled up.

732
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:58,583
And somebody's grabbed both of us
before he slipped away.

733
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:02,458
And they just row us to the beach,
and that's it.

734
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:10,375
How did you know someone was coming?

735
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:14,625
I didn't.

736
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:21,333
I didn't.

737
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:35,041
We've got some time.

738
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:37,500
And that's a last resort.

739
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:42,291
I'm not giving up on you.

740
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:47,958
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

741
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:54,500
- Yeah.
- Okay.

742
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:26,166
- What did you do, David?
- Zoe.

743
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,750
- What the hell did you do?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did Michael...?

744
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:30,625
No, he didn't fucking kill himself, David!

745
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:32,958
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

746
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:34,101
- That's...
- You had no right

747
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:36,485
to disclose anything.
And you had no right to go into my lab

748
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:38,421
and steal my medication
for something like this!

749
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,875
- I was trying to protect us.
- Barnett gave us ten days!

750
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:41,958
Yes.

751
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,500
And using all that time
is putting us at risk.

752
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:47,208
What don't you get about this, Zoe?

753
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:50,791
We are already doing everything we can
to try and save him.

754
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:52,083
There's nothing else.

755
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:56,625
I'm just trying to salvage what's left
of this mission, and that includes you!

756
01:12:57,125 --> 01:12:58,125
Michael...

757
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,458
Michael died the moment we took off.

758
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:06,130
You wanted to get rid of him. You weren't
even trying to figure this out.

759
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:07,208
Not even trying?

760
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,791
I destroyed all of my research!

761
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:12,041
This! This right here!

762
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:14,583
This is the only thing
keeping us alive right now.

763
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:18,000
My last three years of training
are now meaningless.

764
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,958
My next two years of experimentation
are gone!

765
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:24,708
You of all people should know
how much this work means to me.

766
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:27,000
And I gave it all up to try and save him!

767
01:13:28,166 --> 01:13:30,083
And what the hell have you done, Zoe?

768
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:32,583
What have you done?

769
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:02,836
How do we know
if there's enough oxygen up there?

770
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:05,458
We don't.
But we're out of options.

771
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:14,291
So, these are what we use
to climb the tethers.

772
01:14:16,125 --> 01:14:19,083
Clamp it on and get some leverage.

773
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,541
You have to keep pressure...

774
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:26,916
on the handle as you're pulling up,
otherwise it'll just slide down.

775
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:30,541
You wanna try it?

776
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:32,250
I know it's counterintuitive,

777
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,666
but you have to lift this leg
with this arm.

778
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,625
Right side, then, yeah.

779
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:41,166
Yeah. You're gonna be feeling
less and less gravity

780
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:44,125
the closer you get to the solar panels.
So, when you climb the tethers,

781
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:46,750
- it'll get easier the higher you go, okay?
- Okay.

782
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:50,343
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.
You're okay.

783
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:52,476
Start over. Let's reset.
Let's start over. We got it.

784
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,434
- I got it, I got it. I got it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

785
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:56,166
Yeah.

786
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,625
- Do you wanna just reset?
- No.

787
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:00,208
Fuck!

788
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:01,892
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good! I'm good!

789
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:33,333
Commander.

790
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I understand that your duty
is to protect your crew

791
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,528
and the risk that you've taken
by giving Michael more time.

792
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:51,125
But he...

793
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:56,375
We were all put in this situation.

794
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,833
We have to be willing to expend
more than just resources.

795
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,250
I know that climbing the tether
puts us at risk, but...

796
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:07,725
I think we should put ourselves at risk.

797
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:14,226
I wouldn't be able to live with myself
if I didn't try everything I could

798
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,125
to save his life.

799
01:16:15,208 --> 01:16:16,208
And, David?

800
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:19,875
I need you to help me.

801
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,791
Michael can't be the one
to climb the tether. He tried.

802
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,180
- What do you mean, he...?
- Michael knows.

803
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,791
- David, I'm... I know...
- I'll do it.

804
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:42,500
What, you'll do it? Just like that?

805
01:16:54,166 --> 01:16:55,791
We need enough oxygen for two.

806
01:17:00,875 --> 01:17:03,541
Once you're up there,
you'll need to tap the lox tank

807
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:06,000
and transfer as much as you can
into the canisters.

808
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:08,883
You're not gonna know how much is in there
until you connect the gauge.

809
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,458
Each of the canisters holds enough
for one person,

810
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:14,666
so obviously, the hope
is that there will be enough for two.

811
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:19,291
Now, when you pierce the tank,
the connection's not gonna be perfect.

812
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:22,916
So make sure any oxygen that's leaking out
is pointed towards the back.

813
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:28,291
Guys? Listen.

814
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,083
You two never trained
for anything with this much complexity.

815
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:36,333
<i>So, keep your cool.</i>

816
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:37,750
<i>Overcommunicate.</i>

817
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,500
<i>And take your time.</i>

818
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:41,416
<i>Do not rush.</i>

819
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:46,291
Michael?

820
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:49,755
- I want you to know that what I...
- It's okay.

821
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,750
We're good.

822
01:19:22,666 --> 01:19:25,026
- <i>EV1, comm check.</i>
- Good check.

823
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:28,166
- <i>EV2, comm check.</i>
- Good check.

824
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:32,541
<i>Good. You're gonna be feeling
full gravity on the roof.</i>

825
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:36,041
<i>A little over 200 meters
to the solar panels,</i>

826
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:39,250
<i>but the higher you go,
the less gravity you'll feel.</i>

827
01:19:39,833 --> 01:19:40,833
Roger.

828
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:43,291
<i>Do not touch the tether
with the clamps</i>

829
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:45,625
that's carrying the power down
from the solar panels.

830
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:46,916
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

831
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,541
<i>Don't climb the power tethers.</i>

832
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,666
Wow, the spinning
is so much worse out here.

833
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:16,916
You gonna be okay?

834
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:18,625
Yeah. Yeah.

835
01:20:19,958 --> 01:20:21,458
I'll just focus on the tether.

836
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,500
Hold on, Zo. I need a break.

837
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,291
<i>Status check?</i>

838
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:10,500
We're good. It's starting to get easier.

839
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:12,583
Theoretically.

840
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,083
Speak for yourself.

841
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:20,875
Try not to use your upper body
so much, okay?

842
01:21:22,166 --> 01:21:24,500
Okay.

843
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:22,875
MTS.
<i>We've reached the halfway point.</i>

844
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:25,958
Copy, EV2. You're coming into view now.

845
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:35,916
<i>So just take your time.</i>

846
01:22:37,166 --> 01:22:38,625
<i>Take it really easy here.</i>

847
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:42,000
<i>It's critical to stay away
from the photovoltaic panels.</i>

848
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,250
<i>We could lose power to the entire ship.</i>

849
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:47,833
<i>Permanently.</i>

850
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:49,208
Roger.

851
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:20,208
I'm good. David, are you ready?

852
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:22,958
Ready.

853
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:27,916
Just let go. I'll pull you in.

854
01:23:58,125 --> 01:23:59,125
You all good?

855
01:24:00,208 --> 01:24:01,208
I'm good.

856
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:08,791
MTS. <i>We're headed down
to the Kingfisher now.</i>

857
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:10,375
Copy that.

858
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:41,916
<i>Okay, now hook yourself back in,
before you're moving too fast.</i>

859
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:23,416
<i>MTS,</i> we're on the Kingfisher.

860
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:27,083
<i>Great. Great to hear it, EV1.</i>

861
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,916
One, two, three.

862
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,583
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

863
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,250
You're good.

864
01:26:17,708 --> 01:26:19,388
Okay, I'm heading down the Kingfisher now.

865
01:26:20,458 --> 01:26:21,458
You got this, Zo.

866
01:27:09,916 --> 01:27:10,916
You all right, Zo?

867
01:27:13,291 --> 01:27:14,291
Fine.

868
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:16,166
I'm fine, I'm fine.

869
01:27:17,416 --> 01:27:18,416
Okay.

870
01:27:20,875 --> 01:27:22,125
All right. I'm inside.

871
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:25,375
<i>Okay. You're looking for
the liquid-oxygen pipe toward the back.</i>

872
01:27:26,666 --> 01:27:28,166
- I see it.
<i>- Great.</i>

873
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,625
<i>Walk me through every step.</i>

874
01:27:30,416 --> 01:27:31,416
Wilco.

875
01:27:40,416 --> 01:27:42,125
Tapping into the line now.

876
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:43,208
<i>Copy.</i>

877
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:48,083
Okay. Connection's in.

878
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:50,291
<i>Okay. How good is the seal?</i>

879
01:27:53,291 --> 01:27:55,208
It's definitely not a hundred percent.

880
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:57,291
It's hard to tell
how much we're losing by sight.

881
01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:00,625
<i>Let's just lose
as little as possible.</i>

882
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:06,041
Roger. I'm ready to check
how much oxygen we've got up here.

883
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:27,291
We're at 250.

884
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,333
We have enough
to fill up at least one cylinder.

885
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:32,333
<i>Copy that. Good so far.</i>

886
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:50,916
Come on.

887
01:28:58,125 --> 01:28:59,125
<i>MTS.</i>

888
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:03,000
We've got more than enough oxygen up here.

889
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:05,125
<i>It's climbing.</i>

890
01:29:05,208 --> 01:29:06,833
Oh, fucking A.

891
01:29:06,916 --> 01:29:08,125
- Yes!
<i>- Still climbing.</i>

892
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:10,875
Okay, stay focused.
We've gotta get these cylinders filled.

893
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:13,041
<i>David, send the first one down.</i>

894
01:29:13,125 --> 01:29:14,458
Copy. Coming down.

895
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:24,166
On the way.

896
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:07,041
<i>You enjoying the view
up there, David?</i>

897
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:09,166
Not funny, Zoe.

898
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:10,333
<i>Okay.</i>

899
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:13,083
The first cylinder's full.

900
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:14,833
I'm uncoupling it now.

901
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:18,250
<i>Still got plenty of oxygen left
in the big tank.</i>

902
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:19,916
Ready when you are.

903
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:23,625
- <i>Coming out.</i>
- Okay.

904
01:30:38,916 --> 01:30:41,541
<i>MTS,</i> we have the first cylinder.

905
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:43,000
<i>Great. Copy that.</i>

906
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:47,000
Second cylinder is on its way.

907
01:30:58,791 --> 01:31:00,250
How's it going in there, Zoe?

908
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:03,333
<i>The tank's still leaking,
but it's all good.</i>

909
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:05,958
Second canister filling up.

910
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:09,750
It look... What...? What's going on?

911
01:31:13,208 --> 01:31:16,958
We're getting a solar storm warning.
Abort, EV1! Abort, EV2!

912
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:19,833
Oh, God.

913
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:24,583
How much time do we have?

914
01:31:24,666 --> 01:31:26,000
<i>Twenty minutes.</i>

915
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:32,916
Zoe! Come on! Let's go!

916
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,583
No. We can't just leave this here.

917
01:31:34,666 --> 01:31:36,541
<i>This is the oxygen for Michael.</i>

918
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:38,785
There isn't enough time.
You're gonna have to leave it.

919
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:41,166
<i>It's a coronal mass ejection.</i>

920
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:43,208
<i>The radiation is just gonna be deadly.</i>

921
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:44,916
<i>You need to head back right now!</i>

922
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,625
<i> Zoe, come on!</i>

923
01:31:50,083 --> 01:31:52,375
- <i>Zoe!</i>
- Yeah, I'm coming!

924
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,875
<i>Come on, Zoe. We gotta go.</i>

925
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:05,708
I'm out. I'm climbing.

926
01:32:09,208 --> 01:32:10,208
Oh, Jesus.

927
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:25,625
- Okay. Let me clip you in.
- All right.

928
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:30,541
- Okay.
- Good?

929
01:32:30,583 --> 01:32:31,583
I'm heading up.

930
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:50,541
Right.

931
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,541
Yeah.

932
01:32:54,791 --> 01:32:55,791
Shit.

933
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:02,583
Zoe? David? Status check.

934
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:07,753
We're about a quarter
of the way back to the <i>MTS.</i>

935
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:17,208
I'm dying here, Zo.

936
01:33:17,791 --> 01:33:20,958
- It's gonna start getting easier. Come on.
<i>- Eight minutes to go.</i>

937
01:33:32,583 --> 01:33:33,583
- Michael.
- Yeah?

938
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:35,083
- Close the shutters.
- Got it.

939
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:45,166
Stay back there.

940
01:33:51,416 --> 01:33:52,916
<i>How far are you two?</i>

941
01:33:53,625 --> 01:33:55,208
About to cross the solar array.

942
01:34:05,583 --> 01:34:06,625
Go ahead.

943
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:08,500
I'll be right behind you.

944
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:41,458
Oh, shit.

945
01:34:42,083 --> 01:34:43,083
Zoe?

946
01:34:44,041 --> 01:34:45,416
Shit. Zoe, can you hear me?

947
01:34:48,583 --> 01:34:49,583
I can't slow down.

948
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,059
<i>Clip back in! Clip back into
the tether! Zoe, you're moving too fast!</i>

949
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:58,041
- I can't. I can't!
<i>- Clip back in!</i>

950
01:35:00,666 --> 01:35:01,666
Zoe?

951
01:35:45,291 --> 01:35:46,916
- Zoe?
- David. David.

952
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,416
- Get back.
- David, it's gone.

953
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:49,375
David, it's gone!

954
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:06,041
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. I got you.

955
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,875
Get up. Okay.

956
01:36:11,833 --> 01:36:12,833
Let's go.

957
01:36:58,166 --> 01:36:59,166
Look.

958
01:37:00,625 --> 01:37:02,958
We've still got a full tank
leaking up there.

959
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:06,208
We're gonna lose it.

960
01:37:08,541 --> 01:37:09,666
If we can get to it...

961
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:17,416
the three of us can still make it.

962
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,583
Right now, the storm is lethal out there.

963
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:24,875
Maybe we can wait it out.

964
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,416
How long is the storm gonna last?

965
01:37:37,833 --> 01:37:38,833
Hours.

966
01:37:53,666 --> 01:37:54,666
I can go.

967
01:37:56,041 --> 01:37:57,041
Michael...

968
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:01,875
Why do you want to, mate?
You don't have the trainings.

969
01:38:02,541 --> 01:38:04,958
If you don't make it back,
one of us dies too.

970
01:38:49,791 --> 01:38:50,991
- I'm willing.
- I'll go.

971
01:38:54,166 --> 01:38:55,166
I can do it.

972
01:39:00,625 --> 01:39:01,625
I can do it.

973
01:39:09,166 --> 01:39:10,166
Yeah.

974
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:11,958
I can do this.

975
01:39:12,041 --> 01:39:13,291
- Wait.
- David.

976
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:16,458
I can't let you do this.

977
01:39:18,041 --> 01:39:20,083
So make it back home...

978
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:22,500
go have a kid...

979
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:26,458
and send them to Yale, okay?

980
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:33,833
Wait. Zoe, I...

981
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:43,791
- No, Zoe.
- I know.

982
01:39:45,083 --> 01:39:46,916
- I'm so sorry.
- I know. I know.

983
01:39:56,916 --> 01:39:58,458
- I wish I could do it.
- I know.

984
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:01,291
I know.

985
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:39,684
<i>I applied to the HARP program
because I thought</i>

986
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:42,708
<i>it would be a funny story
to get rejected by Hyperion.</i>

987
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:48,250
<i>But now I realize that
this is one of those rare opportunities</i>

988
01:46:48,333 --> 01:46:52,625
<i>that could truly give my life meaning
beyond anything I could imagine.</i>

988
01:46:53,305 --> 01:47:53,353
