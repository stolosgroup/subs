<i>Quiet out here.
Peaceful.</i>

00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:30,016
<i>No Noise except my own.</i>

<i>Again, Manchee? Just go.</i>

<i>You don't have to ask me</i>

<i>every time
you wanna take a shit.</i>

10

<i>Crawlers.</i>

11
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,534
<i>I love that knife.</i>

12
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:01,313
<i>Poo and eat, it's all you do.</i>

13
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:06,318
Manchee, come on.

14
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:07,519
<i>Cursed.</i>

15
00:02:07,954 --> 00:02:08,988
<i>Shit. Preacher.</i>

16
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:10,823
<i>Cursed is the ground
because of you.</i>

17
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:11,991
<i>Nobody goes
to church anymore.</i>

18
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:13,926
<i>Shut up,
control your Noise.</i>

19
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,495
<i>Control your Noise, Todd.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

20

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

<i>Think of something else,
think of something different.</i>

22
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,702
- <i>Think of birds.</i>
- <i>Dust you are...</i>

23
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,469
Preacher.

24
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:27,940
To dust
you will return.

25
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:29,842
<i>Why is the preacher here?</i>

26
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:31,476
<i>We don't even need a preacher.</i>

27
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,712
<i>Nobody goes to church anymore.</i>

28
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:36,749
<i>Boy sinned.
Judgment.</i>

29
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:40,485
<i>Shit, he heard me.</i>

30
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:47,894
<i>Don't run.
Oh, he's hearing that, too.</i>

31
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:49,796
<i>Just hide your Noise,
hide your Noise.</i>

32
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:51,664
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

33
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:53,766
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,935
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

35
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,404
- <i>I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>
- Do not hide your Noise.

36
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,876
Open your mind.

37
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,545
<i>Stop looking
at my thoughts.</i>

38
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:08,547
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

39
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,917
<i>I am Todd Hewitt,
I am Todd Hewitt, I am Todd...</i>

40
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:15,988
<i>Don't show weakness.</i>

41
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,660
I know your truth.

42
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:25,097
An orphan, runt.
Unwanted. Weak.

43
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:27,900
Like a woman.

44
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:30,368
<i>Yeah.
Well, I wouldn't know.</i>

45
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:32,805
<i>Never seen a real woman
before, they're all gone.</i>

46
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,740
<i>They're all gone. All gone.
Wouldn't know.</i>

47
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:36,742
<i>Never before. Never seen
a real woman before.</i>

48
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:37,977
<i>Weak.</i>

49
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:40,813
<i>Weak.</i>

50
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:45,584
<i>My face hurts.
Keep your Noise down.</i>

51
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:49,856
<i>Return to the ground
once more.</i>

52
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:53,525
<i>Let the dust...
Because of you.</i>

53
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:55,695
<i>Well, at least he didn't
bust my lip this time.</i>

54
00:03:58,698 --> 00:03:59,966
<i>You were no help.</i>

55
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,100
Come on.

56
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:10,877
<i>I gotta pee.</i>

57
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:14,412
<i>Back from a hunt.</i>

58
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:18,150
<i>Here comes Davy, useless.</i>

59
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:24,724
Shit-shoveler Hewitt
and his dumb dog.

60
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:27,492
<i>Thinks he's a man,
but he's never killed a thing.</i>

61
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:28,861
- Better watch your Noise.
- <i>Snake.</i>

62
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:30,462
You cocky
little son of a bitch.

63
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:31,797
<i>Snake!</i>

64
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,836
<i>Don't let him see
that it hurts.</i>

65
00:04:36,869 --> 00:04:38,570
<i>I can hear everything
you're thinking,</i>

66
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:39,872
- <i>you dumb shit.</i>
- <i>Beat his ass.</i>

67
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:41,506
<i>Shit, the mayor,
the mayor,</i>

68
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:42,942
<i>the mayor, the mayor. Shit.</i>

69
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:45,678
<i>Hide your Noise,
hide your Noise.</i>

70
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:47,445
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

71
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,015
Is there a problem, boys?

72
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:50,182
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,</i>

73
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:52,084
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

74
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:53,653
No, Pa.

75
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:56,022
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

76
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:58,590
Very clever use
of your Noise, son.

77
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:00,660
<i>Mayor likes me.
Thinks I'm a man.</i>

78
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:01,761
I reckon you'll be riding

79
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:03,696
with the Spackle Patrol
before long.

80
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:06,732
Very clever.

81
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:09,201
Maybe my son can learn
something from you, Todd.

82
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:11,804
- Davy?
- Yes, Pa.

83
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:13,806
Keep shovelin' that shit.

84
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,207
<i>Shit-shoveler Hewitt.</i>

85
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:16,474
<i>Asshole.</i>

86
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:24,050
<i>I wish they'd let me
ride past the ridge.</i>

87
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,053
<i>Stuck here,
there's nowhere else to go.</i>

88
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:30,256
You get lost, son?
There's work to be done.

89
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,557
Usually when you get lost.

90
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,961
I was out getting that part
you asked for.

91
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:45,071
<i>Beets. Always beets.
I hate beets.</i>

92
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:46,706
<i>It turns my shit red.</i>

93
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:49,541
<i>Manchee, here.</i>

94
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:50,977
<i>Dog doesn't even want it.</i>

95
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:53,813
How was your day, son?

96
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:56,849
Uh, yeah, good. Busy.

97
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:59,852
<i>That snake was very
clever use of your Noise, son.</i>

98
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:00,720
<i>I reckon you'll be riding</i>

99
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:03,055
<i>with the Spackle Patrol
before long.</i>

100
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,124
<i>My son can learn
something from you, Todd.</i>

101
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,126
<i>Very clever, very clever.</i>

102
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,095
Mayor is not
your friend, son.

103
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:10,629
<i>At least the mayor
thinks I'm a man.</i>

104
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:11,831
<i>Thinks I'm smart.</i>

105
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:14,066
Then maybe the mayor
can raise you, too, huh?

106
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,601
Put clothes on your back,
food in your plate.

107
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:17,770
<i>Shit, here we go again.</i>

108
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:18,637
Stop it, you two!

109
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:24,076
Stop it.
Stop it, you two, please.

110
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,679
Control your Noise.

111
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:29,281
I need you on the field
with me tomorrow, all right?

112
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:32,918
Yes, sir.

113
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:43,095
A gift for your birthday.

114
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,832
Thank you, sir.

115
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:49,769
<i>I always wanted a knife.
Like a man.</i>

116
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:52,071
We're all that's left.

117
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:53,773
We have to protect
each other.

118
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:55,174
To do that,

119
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,943
it's important you learn
how to tame things, Todd.

120
00:06:57,977 --> 00:06:59,712
Tame?

121
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:01,981
Break them. Control them.

122
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:04,616
By

123
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,788
- killing them?
- That's right.

124
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:12,557
Here, men must kill.

125
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:15,961
<i>You're the youngest here,
Todd.</i>

126
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:17,595
<i>You'd be
the last man standing.</i>

127
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:23,736
<i>I'm the circle,
the circle is me and you.</i>

128
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,871
<i>See, I wasn't born
into the Noise like you.</i>

129
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,640
<i>I had to learn
how to control mine</i>

130
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:28,908
<i>through years of practice.</i>

131
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:32,011
Go to sleep.

132
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:33,045
Okay.

133
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,281
<i>I've had my eye
on you, Todd.</i>

134
00:07:35,314 --> 00:07:36,449
<i>You're exceptional,</i>

135
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:38,717
<i>and exceptional men are needed
to hold the circle together.</i>

136
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,087
<i>To do that,
it's important you learn</i>

137
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,755
<i>how to tame things, Todd.</i>

138
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:45,658
That son of a bitch
has his claws in.

139
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:46,959
<i>I've had
my eye on you, Todd.</i>

140
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:50,096
<i>Exceptional men
are needed in the circle.</i>

141
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:53,766
<i>Scout ship A, prepare to enter</i>

142
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,867
<i>New World's atmosphere</i>

143
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,936
<i>in T minus 37 seconds.</i>

144
00:07:58,204 --> 00:07:59,872
<i>Copy that, Mother Bird.</i>

145
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:01,674
<i>Still no contact
from the surface.</i>

146
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:02,908
<i>We'll let you know
what we find.</i>

147
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,314
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

148

<i>the temperature

150
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,989
<i>Please make sure your
seat backs and tray tables</i>

151
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:19,091
<i>are in their full
upright position.</i>

152
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,661
<i>Buckle up.</i>

153
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,966
Think the settlers
are still alive down there?

154
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,836
If they are,
they're gonna be happy to see us.

155
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,105
They were expecting
the Second Wave years ago.

156
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,123
<i>Don't freak out,
don't freak out,</i>

157
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,191
What did we
just fly through?

158
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:53,859
<i>Don't freak out.</i>

159
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:56,061
<i>We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.</i>

160
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:57,396
What did you say?

161
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:59,331
I didn't say anything.

162
00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:01,767
<i>She heard that? I'm so scared!</i>

163
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,203
- <i>Fire! Get out!</i>
- <i>Fire!</i>

164
00:09:04,236 --> 00:09:05,271
- Captain!
- <i>Fire!</i>

165
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:07,173
- <i>Oh, my God. We're gonna die.</i>
- Captain, no!

166
00:09:07,206 --> 00:09:08,841
<i>What's happening?
What is this?</i>

167
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:14,713
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

168
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:58,791
<i>Behind on the planting.</i>

169
00:09:58,824 --> 00:10:02,728
<i>Need rain. Need rain.</i>

170
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:07,833
<i>I'm the last boy
in the world.</i>

171
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,268
<i>Someday,
I'll be the only one left.</i>

172
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:10,970
<i>I'll just be all alone.</i>

173
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:13,105
<i>I wonder if you can actually
die from boredom.</i>

174
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:16,075
<i>I hate beets, it's always
beets farming every day.</i>

175
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:17,142
Todd.

176
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:18,210
<i>One day,
you'll be alone.</i>

177
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,245
Todd!

178
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,347
What?

179
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,249
Check the panels,
please.

180
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:26,518
Sure.

181
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,462
- Go!
- I am going!

182
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:38,564
- More!
- Shit.

183
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,199
I'mma go get the other lead.

184
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:47,373
<i>What the hell?</i>

185
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:55,414
<i>Thief, hey! Orange.
Hey! Thief!</i>

186
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,590
<i>Orange.</i>

187
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,592
<i>Thief! Hey! Hey!
He's so fast.</i>

188
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,060
Hey! Hey!

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,202
<i>Go! Go! Go! Fast. Go!</i>

190
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:35,921
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my...</i>

191
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:42,328
<i>What happened here?</i>

192
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:45,431
<i>Holy shit.</i>

193
00:11:46,098 --> 00:11:47,232
What the hell?

194
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:52,538
<i>Is that...
Is that from the sky?</i>

195
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:54,106
<i>Is that a spaceship?</i>

196
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:55,541
<i>A spaceship?</i>

197
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:57,309
<i>Where'd it come from?</i>

198
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:58,544
<i>It's not from here.</i>

199
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:01,180
<i>From the sky.</i>

200
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:02,281
Hello?

201
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:05,084
<i>Somebody was flying it.
The thief.</i>

202
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:07,019
- <i>The thief. Survivors.
- Survivors?</i>

203
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,027
<i>That's a...
That's a spaceship.</i>

204
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,261
<i>A spaceship.</i>

205
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:18,430
<i>The hell did it come from?
Where'd it come from?</i>

206
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:26,405
<i>Graves. People. Dead.
Buried. Death.</i>

207
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:28,307
<i>I gotta go tell the mayor.</i>

208
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,409
<i>This is exciting. Spaceship.</i>

209
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:32,311
<i>Spaceship. Mayor's gotta know.
Gotta hurry.</i>

210
00:12:32,344 --> 00:12:33,946
<i>Judgment.
Judgment is coming.</i>

211
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,080
<i>Never seen
a spaceship before.</i>

212
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:36,482
<i>Think it's from Earth?
How'd it get here?</i>

213
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:37,950
<i>Spaceship crashed.
Spaceship. Spaceship.</i>

214
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:38,951
<i>Shut up, Todd.
Shut up, Todd.</i>

215
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:40,419
- <i>What's the rush?
- Gotta tell mayor.</i>

216
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:41,420
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

217
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:42,988
<i>What, you think
I can't hear your Noise?</i>

218
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:44,289
What're you babbling about?

219
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:46,225
- Nothing.
- Where you goin'?

220
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:47,593
- Hey, come back here!
- <i>Control your Noise.</i>

221
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:48,728
<i>Control your Noise.</i>

222
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:50,295
- <i>Here comes that boy.
- Gotta tell the mayor.</i>

223
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:51,563
- <i>Shut up, Todd. Shut up.</i>
- Hey.

224
00:12:51,597 --> 00:12:53,098
- <i>Hide your Noise.</i>
- Hey.

225
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:53,966
<i>Hide your Noise.</i>

226
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:56,268
<i>Spaceship. Shut up.</i>

227
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:57,936
<i>Stop. Todd, stop.</i>

228
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,005
<i>Is it real?</i>

229
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:01,073
<i>Stop. Stop thinking about...</i>

230
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:03,008
<i>Get outta my face!</i>

231
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:03,976
<i>What're you talking about?</i>

232
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:05,477
<i>Spaceship?
What do they want?</i>

233
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:06,713
<i>Where's the ship?</i>

234
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:10,582
- <i>Spaceship crashed.</i>
- <i>They're here.</i>

235
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:11,617
<i>Is this
the Second Wave?</i>

236
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:13,919
<i>Tell the mayor.
Gotta tell the mayor. Go.</i>

237
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:16,488
Mayor, I found somethin'.

238
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:19,324
<i>You should've
told me first.</i>

239
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,328
There's a survivor.

240
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:29,168
He'd been stealing
from our farm.

241
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:31,370
I followed him here.
Here, look!

242
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:36,241
Gotta be from Earth, right?

243
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:43,282
Very good, son.

244
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:46,251
Search it,
anything we can use.

245
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:47,754
<i>The mayor likes me.</i>

246
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,488
- <i>Likes me better than his boy.</i>
- Todd.

247
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:51,156
<i>Shut up, Todd.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

248
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,424
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

249
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:56,395
The survivor,
what did he look like?

250
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:00,098
He was too fast,
I couldn't see his face.

251
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,701
What did he say?

252
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:03,569
I don't know
how he was doing it.

253
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:06,305
But he didn't have any Noise.

254
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:07,473
Preacher never been wrong.

255
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:11,510
<i>No Noise?
You gotta be kidding me.</i>

256
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:13,278
<i>I know what that means.
No soul.</i>

257
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,180
- Find her.
- <i>I'll find her, Pa.</i>

258
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:16,716
- Get her!
- <i>"Her"?</i>

259
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:19,284
<i>Wait. What? "Her," "find her"?</i>

260
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,019
<i>Holy shit! It's a girl.</i>

261
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:23,589
<i>Space girl.</i>

262
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:26,726
<i>He's a girl.</i>

263
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:32,030
<i>Never seen a girl before.</i>

264
00:14:44,076 --> 00:14:45,310
<i>From the farm.</i>

265
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,451
<i>Whoa!</i>

266
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:53,720
Stop! Don't come any closer!

267
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:56,455
<i>Girl. Girl. It's a girl.
Girl. Oh, my God.</i>

268
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:57,623
<i>Where are you from?
You're a girl.</i>

269
00:14:57,657 --> 00:15:00,492
<i>No Noise. Are you from Earth?
Girl! Thief! Shut up, Todd.</i>

270
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,195
Sorry.
I'm sorry. I've just never...

271
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:04,463
<i>Never seen a girl before.
Breathe.</i>

272
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:05,564
Are you from Earth?

273
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:07,634
<i>You're really pretty.
Yellow hair. Found her.</i>

274
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,568
<i>I found her!
I found her!</i>

275
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:10,837
Wait, wait, wait!

276
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,205
<i>Shit! Stupid Noise.</i>

277
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:14,641
- She's running!
- Got you now!

278
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:15,808
<i>Go! Go!</i>

279
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,244
Get her!

280
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:21,748
<i>Look at you.</i>

281
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:27,754
Get the girl.

282
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:34,694
Bring her back.

283
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,772
<i>"I am the circle,</i>

284
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:46,706
<i>"the circle is me.</i>

285
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:49,441
<i>"I am the circle,
the circle is me.</i>

286
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:52,144
<i>"I am the circle,
the circle is me.</i>

287
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:53,579
<i>"I am the circle,
the circle is me."</i>

288
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:55,280
It's all right.
It's all right.

289
00:15:57,717 --> 00:15:58,751
<i>We got her.</i>

290
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,753
It's all right.

291
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:02,521
You're safe now.

292
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:06,759
I'm David Prentiss,
I'm the mayor here.

293
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,699
<i>Second Wave.</i>

294
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:15,434
- <i>I think it's the Second Wave.</i>
- <i>This is bad. Bad.</i>

295
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:20,439
<i>She looks funny.</i>

296
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:22,642
Quiet.
Sit down.

297
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,285
That was a terrible crash.

298
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,723
And you are
the only survivor, miss?

299
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,894
You're lucky
to be alive.

300
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:50,369
Were you hurt?

301
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:05,685
I saw the graves.

302
00:17:09,756 --> 00:17:11,156
I'm sorry.

303
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:23,903
That must be overwhelming.

304
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:28,875
- It's loud.
- Mmm.

305
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:31,376
We call it the Noise.

306
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,746
Happened to all the men
when we landed on this planet.

307
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:37,717
Every thought in our heads
on display.

308
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:40,285
It's fairly harmless,
though.

309
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:44,891
Some of us can control it
better than others.

310
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:47,860
<i>Can control it.</i>

311
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:54,466
<i>She's one of us.</i>

312
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:58,236
<i>Control.</i>

313
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,404
Can you see mine?

314
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,574
No.

315
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:03,876
Didn't affect the women.

316
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,813
Where are all the women?

317
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:13,618
They're dead.

318
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,289
There was a war.

319
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:20,960
A terrible war,
against the native species.

320
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:22,962
The Spackle.

321
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:30,837
They overran our colony
and they killed all the women.

322
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,540
Slaughtered them.

323
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:43,883
Can you tell me
how you came to be here?

324
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,654
You will have
to actually speak.

325
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:53,592
The Noise didn't affect
the women, remember?

326
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:55,594
Can't hear your thoughts.

327
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:00,365
I was scouting.

328
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:02,969
So you come
from a larger ship?

329
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:06,404
Yeah.

330
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,406
We lost contact with
the First Wave colonies,

331
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,743
- so we were sent out to scout.
- Ah.

332
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:14,680
And this ship will be
coming for you, right?

333
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,888
How big is it?

334
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:26,458
It's the largest
in our fleet.

335
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:29,361
Holds 4,000 people.

336
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:32,430
And it will be landing where?

337
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,833
Why?

338
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:46,279
Excuse me, for a moment.

339
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:57,089
Don't talk to her
and don't let anyone in.

340
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:04,931
<i>"I am the circle</i>

341
00:20:04,964 --> 00:20:06,464
<i>"and the circle is me."</i>

342
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,532
<i>Is it Second Wave?</i>

343
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:10,870
<i>"I am the circle
and the circle is me."</i>

344
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:12,404
<i>What does she know?</i>

345
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:14,674
<i>What's going on
in there? Is she okay?</i>

346
00:20:14,707 --> 00:20:16,474
<i>"... and the circle is me.</i>

347
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:19,511
<i>"I am the circle
and the circle is me."</i>

348
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:22,882
<i>"I am the circle."</i>

349
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,025
<i>Don't talk to her
and don't let anyone in.</i>

350
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,061
<i>Pa said
don't talk to her.</i>

351
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:36,128
<i>Pa is not here.</i>

352
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:38,764
Looks like it's just
you and me now, little sis.

353
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,804
<i>Never seen a girl before.</i>

354
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,672
<i>Girls are scary.</i>

355
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:00,152
Hey!

356
00:21:00,186 --> 00:21:01,721
<i>Can't trust girls.</i>

357
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:05,091
<i>What is this shit?</i>

358
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:08,628
Be careful with that.

359
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:10,830
<i>I do what I wanna do,
what I want.</i>

360
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:23,676
<i>Davy!</i>

361
00:21:28,214 --> 00:21:29,982
What kinda crazy thing
she got in there?

362
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:34,954
Where is she?

363
00:21:34,987 --> 00:21:36,488
She must've
gone out the back.

364
00:21:38,224 --> 00:21:39,524
Find her.

365
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:46,598
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

366
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:51,503
<i>Cannot trust girls.
Sorry, Pa.</i>

367
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,975
<i>An angel
descended from the heavens</i>

368
00:21:56,008 --> 00:21:59,211
<i>to bring forth judgment. Yes.</i>

369
00:21:59,245 --> 00:22:00,545
Preacher.

370
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:01,681
David.

371
00:22:01,714 --> 00:22:02,848
<i>Judgment.</i>

372
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:05,517
I'm done living in exile.
If we take her ship,

373
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,485
we can take control
of the planet.

374
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,088
They'll be in hypersleep
when they land,

375
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,957
so they won't expect
an ambush.

376
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,627
We just can't let her
warn them about us.

377
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,830
<i>The angel is here
to punish us. And so much...</i>

378
00:22:17,863 --> 00:22:19,999
She's not an angel,
she's a girl.

379
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,169
She's all alone
and she's got nothing.

380
00:22:24,804 --> 00:22:28,808
<i>Martyr.
Truth demands a martyr.</i>

381
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:30,575
<i>Judgment, judgment.</i>

382
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:36,514
<i>Get her back to the
mayor, she can't be far.</i>

383
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:38,084
<i>Go,
she can't be too far!</i>

384
00:22:38,117 --> 00:22:39,952
<i>She has to be found again.</i>

385
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:43,723
<i>Girl's about
to find out what's what.</i>

386
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,126
<i>Why is she so important?</i>

387
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:01,173
<i>The hell happened in here?</i>

388
00:23:04,143 --> 00:23:05,543
<i>I hope she's okay.</i>

389
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:08,147
<i>Space bag.</i>

390
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:12,084
<i>Someone's gotta take it,
might as well be me.</i>

391
00:23:12,885 --> 00:23:14,120
<i>Take it.</i>

392
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:18,958
<i>I bet she has
some cool shit in here.</i>

393
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,095
- The angel moves swiftly.
- <i>Space bag.</i>

394
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:24,764
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

395
00:23:24,797 --> 00:23:26,198
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

396
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:27,700
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

397
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:33,639
Oh, there he is.

398
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:36,909
Todd! Come over here, son!

399
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:38,911
Yeah, I'll be out in a minute!

400
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,267
<i>Mmm. At least it's not beets.</i>

401
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,335
Hey, Manchee.

402
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:20,386
<i>Oh, my God. Girl! She's here.
Yellow hair. Shit.</i>

403
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,655
<i>Uh, what the hell?
Space girl. Oh, my God.</i>

404
00:24:22,688 --> 00:24:23,989
<i>Girl! Be a man, be a man.</i>

405
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:25,758
<i>Be strong. No Noise.</i>

406
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:27,393
<i>No Noise. Girl.</i>

407
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:28,394
What're you doin' here?

408
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:30,896
<i>Why are you here? Yellow hair.
You can't be here.</i>

409
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,898
<i>Scary. She's scared.
Don't be scared.</i>

410
00:24:32,932 --> 00:24:34,266
<i>Thief.
Should I turn her in?</i>

411
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,702
- Todd!
- I'm coming, Pa! Hey.

412
00:24:36,735 --> 00:24:37,703
<i>Help her.</i>

413
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:39,738
You gotta stay here,
they're all looking for you.

414
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:42,241
Don't come out.
Manchee, come on.

415
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:45,911
<i>Control your Noise.
Think of something different.</i>

416
00:24:45,945 --> 00:24:48,981
<i>Chores. My chores.
Gotta do my chores.</i>

417
00:24:49,014 --> 00:24:50,216
<i>I love my chores.</i>

418
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:51,650
Hey.

419
00:24:51,684 --> 00:24:53,252
- Where have you been, son?
- Nowhere.

420
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:54,120
<i>I've gotta do my chores.</i>

421
00:24:54,153 --> 00:24:55,387
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

422
00:24:55,421 --> 00:24:56,522
Yeah, I'mma...
I'mma do my chores.

423
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:58,991
<i>I love my chores.
But you don't gotta tell 'em.</i>

424
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:00,860
<i>You gotta tell them, Todd.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

425
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:01,961
- <i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>
- Tell us what?

426
00:25:01,994 --> 00:25:03,129
It's nothing,
don't worry about it.

427
00:25:03,162 --> 00:25:04,230
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

428
00:25:04,263 --> 00:25:05,331
<i>You gotta tell 'em.</i>

429
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,768
<i>Shit. Yellow hair.
Shut up, Todd.</i>

430
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:12,838
Hey, Daws.
What can we do for you?

431
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:14,373
We're looking
for that space girl,

432
00:25:14,406 --> 00:25:15,841
maybe she came through here?

433
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,710
- Space girl?
- What're you talking about?

434
00:25:17,743 --> 00:25:20,246
Ah. Her ship crashed down
in the woods.

435
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,814
Todd here found her.

436
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:23,449
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

437
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,050
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

438
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:28,454
She dropped her jacket

439
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:29,855
not too far
from your property,

440
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:31,190
so I was thinkin' maybe...

441
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:33,826
Maybe she came through here.

442
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:38,764
Nah, nobody come through here.

443
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:41,400
She... She ain't easy
to spot. She...

444
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:43,068
She don't got no Noise.

445
00:25:43,102 --> 00:25:44,904
She didn't
come through here.

446
00:25:44,937 --> 00:25:46,172
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

447
00:25:46,205 --> 00:25:48,040
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

448
00:25:48,073 --> 00:25:49,241
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt. I'm...</i>

449
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:55,214
Anyhow, I'll just take
a look around.

450
00:25:55,781 --> 00:25:57,783
No, no, no. Maybe not.

451
00:25:57,816 --> 00:26:00,085
You heard the boy.
Get on outta here.

452
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:03,422
I'll be seeing you.

453
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,768
The girl's in the barn,
isn't she?

454
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,055
<i>Trouble, trouble.</i>

455
00:26:36,455 --> 00:26:37,489
Hey, there.

456
00:26:38,324 --> 00:26:39,792
Yeah, she don't speak.

457
00:26:40,226 --> 00:26:41,427
<i>Space girl.</i>

458
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,928
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

459
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:50,469
It's all right,
it's okay.

460
00:26:52,238 --> 00:26:53,973
- It's okay.
- <i>I know, she's real.</i>

461
00:26:54,006 --> 00:26:55,107
<i>Shut up, Todd.</i>

462
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:58,110
Just...

463
00:26:58,143 --> 00:26:59,311
Wait here, all right?

464
00:27:00,212 --> 00:27:01,313
Wait here.

465
00:27:39,985 --> 00:27:41,553
I'm not gonna give her back
to the mayor, Cillian.

466
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:42,821
I can't do that.

467
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:43,956
<i>I like her hair.
It's pretty.</i>

468
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:45,291
She can't go back there.

469
00:27:45,324 --> 00:27:48,861
We... Please, Ben, we have to help her.
Come on.

470
00:27:48,894 --> 00:27:50,829
She can't stay in the barn.

471
00:27:50,863 --> 00:27:52,398
Prentiss will find her.

472
00:27:53,532 --> 00:27:55,000
We have to give her back.

473
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:56,568
We don't need that trouble.

474
00:27:56,602 --> 00:27:59,505
No, but that's not
what she wants, Cillian.

475
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:01,173
<i>I'm not gonna give her back.</i>

476
00:28:05,344 --> 00:28:06,412
Cillian.

477
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:09,848
This is the chance.

478
00:28:17,923 --> 00:28:19,291
Would you guys
quit lookin' at each other

479
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:20,592
and somebody talk to me?

480
00:28:22,928 --> 00:28:24,563
Todd, if you want
to help the girl,

481
00:28:25,564 --> 00:28:26,932
you have to go.

482
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:31,303
Go where?
There's nowhere else out here.

483
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:34,073
There is.

484
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:35,474
There is somewhere else.

485
00:28:41,113 --> 00:28:42,348
- Farbranch.
- Farbranch?

486
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:46,452
- Others went over.
- A long time ago, Ben.

487
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:48,554
They never came back.
They'll kill him in Farbranch.

488
00:28:48,587 --> 00:28:50,155
Not if he is with her.

489
00:28:51,223 --> 00:28:52,291
What about the mayor?

490
00:28:52,324 --> 00:28:53,625
Forget about the mayor.

491
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,195
If you want
to protect the girl,

492
00:28:56,228 --> 00:28:57,563
you have to leave now.

493
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:04,870
It's a long way.

494
00:29:05,938 --> 00:29:07,172
When can I come back?

495
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:20,185
<i>They lied to me.
They lied to me.</i>

496
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:21,220
<i>They lied to me.</i>

497
00:29:25,324 --> 00:29:27,559
Stay with the girl
at all times, okay?

498
00:29:27,593 --> 00:29:29,061
And don't let it on
you're from here.

499
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:30,596
Why?

500
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,665
Just don't mention
Prentisstown.

501
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:33,532
What does that mean?

502
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:34,634
What do you mean
don't mention this town?

503
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:37,002
Just don't...
Don't mention you're from here.

504
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,172
Son, you gotta go.

505
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:43,442
I'm proud of you.
Your mom would be, too.

506
00:29:43,475 --> 00:29:44,309
<i>My mom.</i>

508
00:29:47,546 --> 00:29:49,314

509
00:29:52,484 --> 00:29:54,520
- <i>Farbranch.</i>

We're here for the girl,
Cillian.

514
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:36,663
I know.

515
00:30:36,696 --> 00:30:39,632
And I told your man,
she ain't here.

516
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,701
You won't mind if
we look around a little, then?

517
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:45,571
I think you and your men
should leave.

518
00:30:52,712 --> 00:30:55,013
What is this?

519
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:57,149
You know,
we got a girl on the loose

520
00:30:57,182 --> 00:30:58,785
and all you can think about
is chopping wood.

521
00:30:58,818 --> 00:31:00,486
What's wrong with him?

522
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,620
Come on, son.

523
00:31:01,654 --> 00:31:03,455
You don't have to hide
from me.

524
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:05,057
Just tell me where she is.

<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,

527
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:13,565
<i>Just keep him
out of your head, Todd.</i>

528

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.

529
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,535
She pretty, son?

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.

you're a little scared.

<i>I am Todd Hewitt. Focus.

<i>Barn. Barn.</i>

535
00:31:24,744 --> 00:31:26,378
She's in the barn.

00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:27,513
She's in the barn!

537
00:31:27,546 --> 00:31:29,481
- Find that girl!
- <i>I knew she was here.</i>

538
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:30,582
Damn it!

539
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:35,120
- We got her trapped!
- Hurry. Hurry!

540
00:31:35,153 --> 00:31:36,723
Check around the back,
too, don't let her get away!

541
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:38,257
Get those doors open.

542
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:47,566
Todd, come on!

00:31:57,476 --> 00:31:58,477

No, Cillian.

<i>Go, Todd! Go!</i>

Come on, go, go, go!

00:32:09,154 --> 00:32:10,355
Go, go, go, go!

00:32:12,257 --> 00:32:13,559
Get her back!

<i>Faster, faster!</i>

00:32:50,295 --> 00:32:51,597

<i>Faster!</i>

00:32:56,869 --> 00:32:58,537
Stop! Hey! Stop!

555
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:07,179
I'll get her, she's mine.

556
00:33:21,728 --> 00:33:22,895
No, no, no, no, no!

557
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:25,564
Shit! Whoa!

558
00:33:44,449 --> 00:33:45,785
<i>What happened?</i>

559
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:47,519
<i>Cillian, is he...
Is he dead?</i>

560
00:33:47,552 --> 00:33:49,187
<i>Oh, man. Whiskey.</i>

561
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:52,190
<i>Whiskey, Whiskey.</i>

562
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:57,764
<i>Shit. This wasn't the plan.</i>

563
00:33:57,797 --> 00:33:59,932
<i>Broken leg. His leg.
He broke his leg.</i>

<i>Whiskey.</i>

<i>No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, sorry.</i>

00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:07,439
<i>Whiskey, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry...</i>

567
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:08,407
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

568
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,509
<i>Easy, boy. Easy, it's okay.</i>
Hey, hey, hey.

569
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:12,779
<i>End his suffering.
No more pain. Easy.</i>

570
00:34:14,312 --> 00:34:16,615
<i>I'm sorry, Whiskey.
I got no choice.</i>

571
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:18,250
I'm so sorry.

572
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:22,722
<i>Say something to her.</i>

573
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:24,423
<i>This is her fault.
Not that.</i>

574
00:34:25,323 --> 00:34:26,693
Hey, where are you goin'?

575
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:29,896
<i>Deaf. She deaf, too?
Deaf, too?</i>

576
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:33,265
Stop, I'm not trying
to hurt you.

577
00:34:33,298 --> 00:34:34,466
I'm trying to help you.

578
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:35,935
- Will you stop?
- Don't touch me!

579
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:40,740
<i>Holy shit! She can talk.
Oh, my gosh. She can talk.</i>

580
00:34:41,406 --> 00:34:42,574
Back off!

581
00:34:43,843 --> 00:34:46,478
<i>She has a high voice.
It's nice.</i>

582
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:47,880
<i>Get the girl!</i>

583
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,818
<i>Get her back
to the mayor.</i>

584
00:34:51,851 --> 00:34:53,853
<i>Prentisstown men.
Girl's in trouble.</i>

585
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:55,688
<i>What am I doing?
This is a mistake.</i>

586
00:34:55,722 --> 00:34:57,724
<i>What have I done?
Should I turn her in? No.</i>

587
00:34:59,692 --> 00:35:00,960
<i>Very good, son.</i>

588
00:35:00,993 --> 00:35:02,527
<i>No. Mistake,
huge mistake.</i>

589
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:04,563
<i>Shut up, Todd. Shut up!</i>

590
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:05,898
I'm not...
I'm not gonna do that.

591
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:08,034
I promise you, I'm not gonna do that.
I can't just...

592
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:10,402
Look, there's this place.
I can take you there

593
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:12,604
and you'll be safe. Okay?

594
00:35:12,638 --> 00:35:13,940
<i>Farbranch. Farbranch.</i>

595
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:16,274
<i>Farbranch. Farbranch.
Farbranch.</i>

596
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:18,010
What's that?

597
00:35:18,044 --> 00:35:20,445
It's a map,
what does it look like?

598
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:21,647
Do you have a copy
of the map or the...

599
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:23,415
No, I don't have
a copy of the map.

600
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:24,717
Okay? It comes with me.

601
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:27,887
<i>Keep her safe.</i>

602
00:35:31,623 --> 00:35:32,992
Could I contact my ship there?

603
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:35,762
I need to warn them.

604
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:36,929
Yeah.

605
00:35:36,963 --> 00:35:39,364
<i>I have no idea. I don't know.
Shut up, Todd.</i>

606
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,568
Stay ahead of me.

607
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:56,916
I'm not gonna
hunt my own son.

608
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,416
I don't
want to hurt Todd.

609
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,720
I just need to know
about the girl's ship.

610
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:04,857
Now you come along
with us.

611
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:07,026
And you make sure
nothing happens to young Todd.

612
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:08,828
Just like you've been doing
all these years.

613
00:36:10,763 --> 00:36:11,931
Since he was a little boy.

614
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:13,565
- <i>Keep him safe.</i>
- Remember?

615
00:36:13,598 --> 00:36:15,968
<i>Keep him safe, Ben.
Keep him safe.</i>

616
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,938
<i>They'll kill him, Ben.</i>

617
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:20,840
You've gotta know
where they're headed, Ben.

618
00:36:20,873 --> 00:36:22,507
Before she warns
that ship of hers.

619
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:23,776
<i>Cillian, keep him
out of your head.</i>

620
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,545
<i>Our boy.
Kill him.</i>

621
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:27,579
Where're they headed, Ben?

622
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:28,815
<i>Cillian.
No, no, no. Listen to me.</i>

623
00:36:28,848 --> 00:36:30,482
- Think.
- <i>Think of me.</i>

624
00:36:30,515 --> 00:36:31,483
<i>They'll kill him.</i>

625
00:36:31,516 --> 00:36:33,753
<i>They'll kill him
in Farbranch. Farbranch.</i>

626
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:35,721
Farbranch.

627
00:36:44,462 --> 00:36:46,398
You take your time
burying him.

628
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:48,400
Then I need you in town
with everyone else.

629
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:52,071
- Cillian.
- <i>Ben.</i>

630
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,807
<i>Bye, Ben.</i>

631
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:58,476
<i>Keep him safe. Our boy.</i>

632
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:01,647
<i>Our boy. Keep him safe.</i>

633
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:08,988
Whatever happened to
"stay ahead of me", huh?

634
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,723
<i>Don't girls ever get tired?</i>

635
00:37:12,457 --> 00:37:14,492
<i>Been walking for hours.</i>

636
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:17,163
<i>Gosh, space girl is fast.</i>

637
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:18,898
<i>Damn, I'm tired.</i>

638
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:20,833
<i>Be a man. Be a man.</i>

639
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:22,134
<i>Don't let her know
you're tired.</i>

640
00:37:22,168 --> 00:37:23,970
<i>I know you're tired.
Don't be weak.</i>

641
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:25,771
<i>God, I hope this is the way.</i>

642
00:37:25,805 --> 00:37:27,439
<i>God, I hope
this is the right way.</i>

643
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:30,575
Hey, can you slow down a sec?

644
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:31,777
<i>She's gonna know
you're tired.</i>

645
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:33,846
<i>Who cares?
My arm's killing me.</i>

646
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,481
<i>Damn, my arms hurt like shit.
Shit, my arm hurts.</i>

647
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:37,582
<i>I'm tired.</i>

648
00:37:42,487 --> 00:37:44,023
<i>I'm gonna
get infected for sure.</i>

649
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:45,490
<i>Probably gonna die.</i>

650
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:51,163
<i>Shit. Knife.</i>

651
00:37:51,197 --> 00:37:52,530
<i>Something's coming.</i>

652
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:53,900
<i>Spackle.
Be a man.</i>

653
00:37:55,201 --> 00:37:57,203
Manchee, hey!

654
00:37:57,236 --> 00:37:59,171
Hey, hey!

655
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,807
You tracked us here!

656
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:05,912
This is Manchee.

657
00:38:05,945 --> 00:38:07,880
I guess
he's coming with us now.

658
00:38:07,914 --> 00:38:09,115
Come on, boy.

659
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:15,655
<i>I've never been this far
out of Prentisstown before.</i>

660
00:38:16,554 --> 00:38:19,058
<i>God, I hope this is
the right way.</i>

661
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:20,826
Do you know
where you're going, though?

662
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:23,663
Yeah. Definitely.

663
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:25,031
<i>Maybe.</i>

664
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:27,767
<i>Maybe, maybe, maybe.</i>

665
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,968
<i>Definitely.</i>

666
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:30,036
<i>Maybe.</i>

667
00:38:31,037 --> 00:38:32,905
Hey! Get those knives!

668
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:35,074
- Get as many as you can.
- Here.

669
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:37,509
Fresh batteries.
Give it here.

670
00:38:38,044 --> 00:38:39,779
<i>Fresh batteries.</i>

671
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:46,085
<i>I got this.</i>

672
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:47,153
Let's go already!

673
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,558
These ain't worked
in 20 years.

674
00:38:53,926 --> 00:38:55,761
Make 'em work.

675
00:38:55,795 --> 00:38:57,630
<i>"If one of us falls,</i>

676
00:38:57,663 --> 00:38:59,031
<i>"we all fall."</i>

677
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:01,634
<i>"If one of us falls,
we all fall."</i>

678
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,836
<i>"If one of us falls,
we all fall."</i>

679
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:05,237
<i>"If one of us falls,
we all fall."</i>

680
00:39:05,271 --> 00:39:06,138
<i>"If one of us falls,
we all fall."</i>

681
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:07,807
<i>"If one of us falls,
we all fall."</i>

682
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,010
<i>"If one of us falls,
we all fall."</i>

683
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:13,079
<i>"I am the circle,
the circle is me."</i>

684
00:39:13,112 --> 00:39:16,481
<i>Keep him safe, Ben.
Keep him safe.</i>

685
00:39:17,883 --> 00:39:19,719
<i>You can't control me.</i>

686
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:24,690
<i>"I am the circle,
the circle..."</i>

687
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:28,027
<i>"The rain fell
and the floods came</i>

688
00:39:30,062 --> 00:39:32,497
<i>"and the winds
beat against the house.</i>

689
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,802
<i>"And great was his fall."</i>

690
00:39:48,114 --> 00:39:49,915
Hey, Manchee.
Get out the water.

691
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,158
What was that?

692
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,626
<i>Lunch.</i>

693
00:41:10,696 --> 00:41:12,665
<i>Whoa. That's amazing.</i>

694
00:41:12,698 --> 00:41:13,799
What is that?

695
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,604
Hey, what else you got
in that bag?

696
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:25,010
<i>Wish I could remember which
color scales mean poisonous.</i>

697
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:29,882
<i>Probably doesn't matter
once you cook it.</i>

698
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:38,157
You know, that's actually
not bad at all.

699
00:41:41,894 --> 00:41:43,062
Come on, you gotta eat.

700
00:41:44,196 --> 00:41:45,197
Come on.

701
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,667
Just don't think about it.

702
00:41:53,105 --> 00:41:54,273
There you go.

703
00:41:56,909 --> 00:41:57,977
It's not bad, right?

704
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,014
Can I have
some more?

705
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:04,683
Yeah.

706
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:06,852
Thank you.

707
00:42:11,857 --> 00:42:14,860
Everything I've ever had
was prefabricated.

708
00:42:14,894 --> 00:42:16,028
What's that mean?

709
00:42:17,263 --> 00:42:18,797
Created by lab techs.

710
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:21,767
But you have fish
on Earth, right?

711
00:42:23,769 --> 00:42:25,070
I've never been to Earth.

712
00:42:25,104 --> 00:42:26,138
<i>What?</i>

713
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:28,007
You were born on the ship?

714
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,209
So, you're not from Earth?

715
00:42:30,242 --> 00:42:33,012
It took 64 years
to get from Earth to here.

716
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:34,980
I mean, you don't look
64 years old.

717
00:42:35,014 --> 00:42:36,982
<i>Yellow hair. Pretty.
Really pretty.</i>

718
00:42:37,016 --> 00:42:38,317
Please ignore that.

719
00:42:41,453 --> 00:42:43,155
My grandparents
were from there.

720
00:42:44,123 --> 00:42:45,291
Things started
to get hard

721
00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:47,326
and they wanted more
for their kids,

722
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,061
so they signed up
for the journey.

723
00:42:51,797 --> 00:42:53,432
64 years.
So they must have left

724
00:42:53,465 --> 00:42:55,201
before the First Wave
even got here.

725
00:42:58,437 --> 00:42:59,838
Why'd you come
all this way

726
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:01,407
if you didn't know
exactly what was here?

727
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:05,477
Why does anyone
look for a new place to live?

728
00:43:07,012 --> 00:43:08,747
They hoped things
would be better here.

729
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:11,450
But they didn't know
about the Noise.

730
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,892
So your parents
born on the ship, too?

731
00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:24,430
Are they still up there?

732
00:43:28,834 --> 00:43:30,202
<i>What is she thinking?</i>

733
00:43:34,173 --> 00:43:35,407
We should go.

734
00:43:40,012 --> 00:43:42,948
<i>Secrets. Secrets.</i>

735
00:43:42,982 --> 00:43:46,151
<i>Quiet. She's quiet.
No Noise, not right.</i>

736
00:43:46,185 --> 00:43:48,320
<i>She keeps secrets.
Secrets.</i>

737
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:50,356
<i>She keeps secrets.
Secrets.</i>

738
00:43:50,389 --> 00:43:52,424
I didn't ask for any of this,
just so you know.

739
00:43:53,826 --> 00:43:55,427
I didn't say you did.

740
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:58,030
Yeah, but your Noise said it.

741
00:43:58,063 --> 00:44:00,099
- What, my Noise?
- Yeah.

742
00:44:00,132 --> 00:44:01,800
It's just strange to see
everything you're thinking.

743
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:02,835
You know,
it's strange for me, too,

744
00:44:02,868 --> 00:44:03,737
not knowing what's
going on in your head.

745
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:05,437
<i>Not knowing
what you're thinking.</i>

746
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:08,540
I mean, I don't know,
you might not like my dog,

747
00:44:08,574 --> 00:44:09,875
or you'd wanna hit me
over the head

748
00:44:09,908 --> 00:44:11,110
with a rock
or something.

749
00:44:11,143 --> 00:44:13,145
Why would I do that?
You have the map.

750
00:44:16,515 --> 00:44:17,549
That's a good point.

751
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:21,353
And I like your dog.

752
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:34,266
What if
the preacher's right?

753
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,068
<i>What is this prick
tryin' to do?</i>

754
00:44:36,101 --> 00:44:37,269
<i>Find her.</i>

755
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:38,570
<i>You gotta do
the right thing.</i>

756
00:44:50,316 --> 00:44:52,484
So, you see in the
distance on the horizon,

757
00:44:52,518 --> 00:44:54,186
that Noise
in that tree line?

758
00:44:56,622 --> 00:44:59,024
That's Spackle Noise.
We gotta head further west.

759
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:02,895
They're aliens.

760
00:45:02,928 --> 00:45:05,197
Tryin' to wipe us out.

761
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,565
Aren't we the aliens?

762
00:45:06,598 --> 00:45:08,267
What does that mean?

763
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,836
They're native,
that means we're the aliens.

764
00:45:12,037 --> 00:45:14,006
They killed all the women
in my town,

765
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:16,075
including my mom.

766
00:45:16,108 --> 00:45:18,010
So, yeah,
they're the aliens.

767
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:26,885
It feels like
we've been walking all night.

768
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:31,890
How do you know
it's night?

769
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:34,026
It's never dark.

770
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,063
<i>Cold, shit.
Cold, cold, shit!</i>

771
00:45:38,097 --> 00:45:40,499
<i>Idiot. Idiot.</i>

772
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:43,068
<i>Ah, good.
She didn't see that.</i>

773
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:44,937
I saw that.

774
00:45:59,652 --> 00:46:01,654
The rain is colder
than I thought.

775
00:46:02,588 --> 00:46:04,356
You've never seen
rain before?

776
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,595
My father
told me about it.

777
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:17,369
<i>Sad.</i>

778
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:22,241
<i>She's sad.</i>

779
00:46:22,274 --> 00:46:24,276
<i>The hell am I gonna do,
she's probably hungry.</i>

780
00:46:33,385 --> 00:46:35,354
<i>How'd that get there?</i>

781
00:46:35,387 --> 00:46:37,256
<i>I'm proud of you, son.</i>

782
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:39,224
<i>Your mom would be, too.</i>

783
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:48,600
My parents are dead.

784
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:51,570
They got sick on the ship.

785
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:53,605
They knew they'd
never make it to New World.

786
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:02,214
I'm sorry.

787
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:08,655
They made me promise
I'd make it here.

788
00:47:09,455 --> 00:47:11,123
Find a better life.

789
00:47:13,425 --> 00:47:15,494
They gave it all up for me
to have this.

790
00:47:16,629 --> 00:47:18,731
It's not exactly
what I'd imagined.

791
00:47:21,266 --> 00:47:23,068
<i>Lonely, like me.</i>

792
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:25,537
Yeah, a little.

793
00:47:44,423 --> 00:47:46,291
What're you doing?

794
00:47:48,227 --> 00:47:50,395
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I'm sorry. Um...

795
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:51,698
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

796
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:53,298
I don't know what
I was think... I'm sorry.

797
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:55,300
I'm gonna...
I'm just gonna go.

798
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:57,302
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

799
00:47:57,336 --> 00:47:59,304
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

800
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:00,572
Manchee. Come on.

801
00:48:00,606 --> 00:48:02,407
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

802
00:48:04,376 --> 00:48:06,278
Manchee!

803
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,164
Hey.

804
00:48:42,414 --> 00:48:43,549
Hey.

805
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:48,086
Hey!

806
00:48:52,491 --> 00:48:54,226
I'm Viola.

807
00:48:55,127 --> 00:48:57,162
- What?
- I'm Viola.

808
00:48:59,364 --> 00:49:01,567
- I'm Todd.
- Todd Hewitt. Yeah, I know.

809
00:49:04,904 --> 00:49:07,306
<i>I'm Viola.</i>

810
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:08,741
<i>Viola.</i>

811
00:49:08,775 --> 00:49:10,309
<i>Viola.</i>

812
00:49:10,342 --> 00:49:11,678
<i>Viola.</i>

813
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:13,245
<i>I'm Viola.</i>

814
00:49:13,746 --> 00:49:15,147
<i>Viola.</i>

815
00:49:15,748 --> 00:49:18,150
<i>Viola.</i>

816
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:22,487
<i>Viola. I'm Viola.</i>

817
00:49:24,189 --> 00:49:25,324
<i>High voice.</i>

818
00:49:25,992 --> 00:49:27,694
<i>Viola.</i>

819
00:49:30,162 --> 00:49:31,764
Hey. Come back,
come back, come back.

820
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,901
Manchee.

821
00:49:34,934 --> 00:49:36,401
<i>Spackle. Spackle.</i>

822
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:39,338
What was that?

823
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:41,239
That was a Spackle village.

824
00:49:45,645 --> 00:49:47,714
Back!

825
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:49,649
Get down, get down, get down!

826
00:49:51,718 --> 00:49:53,518
<i>Todd, fight.
Come on, Todd. Be a man.</i>

827
00:49:53,552 --> 00:49:54,687
<i>Focus. Control your Noise.</i>

828
00:49:54,721 --> 00:49:56,355
<i>They killed my mom.
Stop doing that!</i>

829
00:49:56,388 --> 00:49:57,522
<i>Be a man! Control your Noise.</i>

830
00:49:57,556 --> 00:49:58,891
<i>They killed my mom.
Todd, stop!</i>

831
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:00,425
- <i>Shut up!</i>
- Be quiet.

832
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:01,560
I'm trying. I'm trying.

833
00:50:01,593 --> 00:50:02,662
<i>Stop. I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

834
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:04,262
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

835
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:06,365
No!

836
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:52,244
Todd, stop!

837
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,651
<i>I'mma kill him.</i>

838
00:50:58,685 --> 00:51:00,452
<i>I swear to
God, I'mma kill him.</i>

839
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:02,421
<i>Damn it.</i>

840
00:51:04,589 --> 00:51:06,926
<i>What am I doing?
Mistake.</i>

841
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:17,369
<i>The mayor said
you gotta kill him.</i>

842
00:51:17,402 --> 00:51:19,404
<i>Don't look at me like that,
gotta kill to survive.</i>

843
00:51:19,438 --> 00:51:21,373
<i>You don't know.
You don't know anything.</i>

844
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:25,510
It would've killed us.

845
00:51:25,544 --> 00:51:28,014
So your solution to everything
is to just kill it?

846
00:51:28,047 --> 00:51:29,716
I was protecting you.

847
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:33,385
It went for you,
not me.

848
00:51:33,418 --> 00:51:35,688
<i>They didn't want
to share their planet with us.</i>

849
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:38,691
<i>They killed all our women.
All our women.</i>

850
00:51:38,725 --> 00:51:40,625
Do you just believe
everything that guy says?

851
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,994
Our mayor
is a war hero.

852
00:51:44,063 --> 00:51:46,331
Doesn't mean you
shouldn't ask questions.

853
00:51:46,364 --> 00:51:48,034
<i>Idiot. You're such an idiot.</i>

854
00:51:48,067 --> 00:51:50,703
<i>Such an idiot.
Such an idiot, Todd.</i>

855
00:51:50,737 --> 00:51:51,971
I didn't say that.

856
00:51:59,511 --> 00:52:00,913
<i>Farbranch.</i>

857
00:52:05,852 --> 00:52:07,687
<i>Farbranch.
Farbranch?</i>

858
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:31,978
Is this Farbranch?

859
00:52:32,011 --> 00:52:33,545
It has to be.

860
00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:56,334
Hey.

861
00:52:59,806 --> 00:53:01,306
Grapes.

862
00:53:02,607 --> 00:53:03,843
Hey, wait up.

863
00:53:04,476 --> 00:53:05,645
Mmm.

864
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,738
This is weird.
Where is everybody?

865
00:53:32,772 --> 00:53:33,706
<i>Don't mention
Prentisstown.</i>

866
00:53:33,739 --> 00:53:34,740
<i>They'll kill him
in Farbranch!</i>

867
00:53:34,774 --> 00:53:36,709
<i>Just don't mention
you are from here.</i>

868
00:53:36,742 --> 00:53:39,411
<i>...kill him in Farbranch.</i>

869
00:53:39,444 --> 00:53:41,814
There are tools,
they must be around here somewhere.

870
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:51,123
Maybe the Spackle came.

871
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,662
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

872
00:53:56,696 --> 00:53:57,897
<i>Dog. Dog.</i>

873
00:54:01,634 --> 00:54:03,069
<i>That's a little girl.</i>

874
00:54:03,102 --> 00:54:05,570
<i>It's a little girl.
What is this place?</i>

875
00:54:05,604 --> 00:54:06,873
What are you doing here?

876
00:54:07,907 --> 00:54:09,374
Is this Farbranch?

877
00:54:10,176 --> 00:54:11,576
<i>Outsiders.</i>

878
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:13,045
Yeah.

879
00:54:15,848 --> 00:54:18,050
<i>She's so small,
another girl.</i>

880
00:54:18,084 --> 00:54:20,052
<i>I'm not the youngest.</i>

881
00:54:20,086 --> 00:54:22,121
<i>She doesn't have Noise.
Women have no Noise.</i>

882
00:54:22,154 --> 00:54:24,456
- <i>Supposed to be dead.</i>
- Stop that!

883
00:54:24,489 --> 00:54:25,825
<i>What is going on?
What the hell is going on?</i>

884
00:54:25,858 --> 00:54:27,559
Wait here.
I'll get the mayor.

885
00:54:27,592 --> 00:54:29,527
<i>What is this place?
There's women everywhere.</i>

886
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:30,930
<i>Little kids.
None of this makes sense.</i>

887
00:54:30,963 --> 00:54:32,430
<i>What the hell
is going on?</i>

888
00:54:32,464 --> 00:54:33,766
<i>Oh, my God.
It's a baby.</i>

889
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:37,036
<i>No Noise.
Women have no Noise.</i>

890
00:54:39,906 --> 00:54:41,874
<i>Oh, my God.
The mayor's a woman.</i>

891
00:54:41,908 --> 00:54:44,744
Last time I checked.
Where are you two from?

892
00:54:44,777 --> 00:54:45,678
<i>Control
your Noise.</i>

893
00:54:45,711 --> 00:54:47,445
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

894
00:54:47,479 --> 00:54:50,448
Okay, Todd Hewitt.
Where are you from?

895
00:54:50,482 --> 00:54:52,151
<i>Don't mention
you are from here.</i>

896
00:54:52,184 --> 00:54:53,585
Prentisstown.

897
00:54:53,618 --> 00:54:54,820
Prentisstown?

898
00:54:54,854 --> 00:54:56,722
Oh, my!
What are they doing here?

899
00:54:58,157 --> 00:54:59,491
They got no business here.

900
00:55:08,935 --> 00:55:10,202
Is it true?

901
00:55:11,203 --> 00:55:12,872
You're from Prentisstown?

902
00:55:15,641 --> 00:55:17,442
- Mmm-hmm.
- <i>Better be afraid, boy.</i>

903
00:55:18,911 --> 00:55:22,514
Well, any son of a bitch
stupid enough

904
00:55:22,547 --> 00:55:24,582
to come here from
Prentisstown gets the rope.

905
00:55:26,052 --> 00:55:27,153
<i>Oh,
this doesn't look good.</i>

906
00:55:27,186 --> 00:55:29,621
<i>Okay, they're gonna beat
the crap out of me now.</i>

907
00:55:29,655 --> 00:55:32,758
<i>This sucks.
Come on, Todd, be tough.</i>

908
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:34,660
<i>Think of something tough.
Birds, birds.</i>

909
00:55:34,694 --> 00:55:36,829
<i>No. No, that's not tough.
Come on, Todd.</i>

910
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:38,631
<i>Okay, come on then,
let's go.</i>

911
00:55:38,664 --> 00:55:39,899
<i>I think I can handle
three of you.</i>

912
00:55:39,932 --> 00:55:41,067
<i>I can take three. Four?</i>

913
00:55:43,202 --> 00:55:45,004
<i>Maybe the spit
was too much.</i>

914
00:55:46,872 --> 00:55:49,041
Mayor, you know the law.

915
00:55:49,075 --> 00:55:51,543
The law
don't apply to boys.

916
00:55:51,576 --> 00:55:54,113
You're from Prentisstown,
aren't you, Matthew?

917
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:55,613
<i>What the hell?</i>

918
00:55:55,648 --> 00:55:57,650
<i>I didn't know they
would really do it.</i>

919
00:55:57,683 --> 00:56:00,686
<i>The hell does that mean?
The hell does that mean?</i>

920
00:56:01,454 --> 00:56:04,256
You leave our town,
Prentissboy,

921
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,590
or you'll be sorry.

922
00:56:05,623 --> 00:56:06,524
<i>This guy is crazy.</i>

923
00:56:06,558 --> 00:56:09,261
There'll be no threats
from you, Matthew,

924
00:56:09,295 --> 00:56:10,595
or anyone else.

925
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,832
Now get back to work.

926
00:56:21,073 --> 00:56:22,641
You're welcome
to stay with me.

927
00:56:28,613 --> 00:56:29,782
I'll be watching you.

928
00:56:34,653 --> 00:56:36,789
Let's go get these bags
unpacked. Let's go.

929
00:56:36,822 --> 00:56:38,858
Move, get 'em unpacked, quick!

930
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:40,726
Charlie! Eli!

931
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,161
I want y'all
to gather some men,

932
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:43,295
find some food
for me and the mayor.

933
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:46,866
The rest of you get some rest.
Move your asses, let's go!

934
00:56:46,899 --> 00:56:48,734
Don't let them rest
too long.

935
00:56:48,768 --> 00:56:49,869
Yes, sir.

936
00:56:49,902 --> 00:56:52,604
That ship is flying at us.
It'll be here any second.

937
00:56:52,638 --> 00:56:55,775
<i>All around!
Sickness. Sick.</i>

938
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:56,809
<i>Sinner!</i>

939
00:56:58,177 --> 00:57:01,213
<i>Sickness all around.
Revealed to us.</i>

940
00:57:01,247 --> 00:57:02,782
<i>Angel brings judgment.</i>

941
00:57:02,815 --> 00:57:05,084
<i>Wickedness brings sickness
all around.</i>

942
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:07,753
<i>The wickedness of man
is great!</i>

943
00:57:07,787 --> 00:57:08,954
<i>His Noise!</i>

944
00:57:08,988 --> 00:57:10,656
You need to control
your Noise, preacher.

945
00:57:10,689 --> 00:57:13,325
- <i>The wickedness of sin.</i>
- You're scaring the men.

946
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,761
Embrace the gift
this planet gives us.

947
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:17,663
Truth.

948
00:57:17,696 --> 00:57:19,932
<i>Truth, the gift of Noise.</i>

949
00:57:19,965 --> 00:57:21,167
And face judgment.

950
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,234
<i>Judgment.</i>

951
00:57:22,268 --> 00:57:26,005
Oh, yeah?
This judgment of yours...

952
00:57:27,773 --> 00:57:30,910
Does it kill all of us
and spare only you?

953
00:57:30,943 --> 00:57:34,080
<i>"I'm the circle
and the circle is you."</i>

954
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:40,352
You hide your Noise
like a woman.

955
00:57:41,987 --> 00:57:44,657
- I consider that a compliment.
- It's not.

956
00:57:45,991 --> 00:57:48,227
Weakness rots from within.

957
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,196
Thank you for the sermon.

958
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:57,203
<i>I see your truth,
I know your truth.</i>

959
00:57:59,905 --> 00:58:02,108
Viola, you can
sleep in here.

960
00:58:05,244 --> 00:58:07,880
Todd, you and the dog can
sleep next door with my dad.

961
00:58:07,913 --> 00:58:09,281
I'm gonna see if I can
get you some clean clothes

962
00:58:09,315 --> 00:58:10,950
and the two of you
need to wash up.

963
00:58:10,983 --> 00:58:14,386
- I don't need clean clothes.
- Yes. Yes, you do.

964
00:58:20,893 --> 00:58:22,261
What are you doing?

965
00:58:23,028 --> 00:58:25,664
- Taking a bath, why?
- In your clothes?

966
00:58:25,698 --> 00:58:28,234
Yeah. These stink
as much as I do.

967
00:58:29,168 --> 00:58:30,669
That's good.

968
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:35,307
I never had
a hot bath before.

969
00:58:38,477 --> 00:58:41,147
I have to find a way
to send a message to my ship.

970
00:58:43,249 --> 00:58:44,850
Okay.

971
00:58:46,285 --> 00:58:47,786
Okay.

972
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,896
We're church settlers
trying to live a simple life

973
00:58:56,929 --> 00:58:58,330
so we let that machinery
go to ruin

974
00:58:58,364 --> 00:59:02,067
and got on with
the business of surviving.

975
00:59:02,101 --> 00:59:04,737
You have no way of
communicating with anyone?

976
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:05,738
We have no communicators

977
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:07,840
for any other settlement,
let alone beyond.

978
00:59:14,413 --> 00:59:15,848
Here are the clothes
you asked for.

979
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:16,782
Thank you, Julie.

980
00:59:16,815 --> 00:59:19,018
- How long they stayin'?
- Thank you, Julie.

981
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:22,755
Okay. Get.
This is not a zoo.

982
00:59:23,389 --> 00:59:24,423
Go.

983
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:32,031
New settlers coming,
it's big news.

984
00:59:32,064 --> 00:59:34,833
People are scared
of what they don't know.

985
00:59:38,103 --> 00:59:39,271
When does your ship land?

986
00:59:43,209 --> 00:59:46,278
System entry will be any day.
If I don't contact them soon,

987
00:59:46,312 --> 00:59:48,047
they might move on
to the next system

988
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,149
and I'll be stranded.

989
00:59:50,182 --> 00:59:52,318
<i>I hope they don't land,
and she's stuck here.</i>

990
00:59:54,253 --> 00:59:55,354
Sorry.

991
00:59:55,387 --> 00:59:57,156
I... I didn't mean
to think that.

992
00:59:59,191 --> 01:00:01,460
What you need to contact
your ship is in Haven.

993
01:00:02,394 --> 01:00:03,429
Haven?

994
01:00:03,462 --> 01:00:05,097
It's the first settlement.

995
01:00:06,332 --> 01:00:08,267
<i>Another town?
More people.</i>

996
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,035
You didn't just think
there were two settlements

997
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:11,303
in all of New World,
did you?

998
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:13,872
No, of course not.

999
01:00:13,906 --> 01:00:15,241
<i>Thought it was one.</i>

1000
01:00:17,876 --> 01:00:19,378
We'll leave in the morning.

1001
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:20,846
<i>I'd rather
stay with you, Todd.</i>

1002
01:00:20,879 --> 01:00:22,114
<i>I'd rather be
with you.</i>

1003
01:00:22,147 --> 01:00:24,283
<i>Kiss me, Todd.
Kiss me.</i>

1004
01:00:24,316 --> 01:00:26,852
No, wait. I didn't mean
to say that, I'm sorry.

1005
01:00:27,219 --> 01:00:28,287
Viola.

1006
01:00:44,536 --> 01:00:46,939
Men and women don't sleep
together in the same places

1007
01:00:46,972 --> 01:00:49,008
because y'all make
too much Noise.

1008
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:54,046
<i>I don't make as much Noise as
that, do I?</i>

1009
01:00:56,415 --> 01:00:59,551
- Does he do that all night?
- Uh-huh.

1010
01:00:59,585 --> 01:01:01,153
Make yourself comfortable.

1011
01:01:01,186 --> 01:01:04,189
<i>Foul ball!</i>

1012
01:01:04,223 --> 01:01:07,793
<i>Women, women, women!
Farbranch!</i>

1013
01:01:09,295 --> 01:01:11,196
They made it to Farbranch.

1014
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:12,531
- Get the men ready.
- Yes, sir.

1015
01:01:12,564 --> 01:01:16,502
<i>Sinner!
The Noise demands a martyr.</i>

1016
01:01:16,535 --> 01:01:18,604
Where're you going,
preacher?

1017
01:01:18,638 --> 01:01:20,439
<i>The angel waits!</i>

1018
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:22,574
I'll fetch the girl.

1019
01:01:22,608 --> 01:01:25,544
No. My men
can take care of that.

1020
01:01:26,545 --> 01:01:28,314
I don't want her
torn to pieces.

1021
01:01:29,281 --> 01:01:32,251
<i>Martyr! Judgment!</i>

1022
01:01:33,252 --> 01:01:35,387
Follow him at a distance.

1023
01:01:35,421 --> 01:01:36,889
Yep. Come on.

1024
01:01:36,922 --> 01:01:38,190
<i>She won't get away.</i>

1025
01:01:38,957 --> 01:01:40,292
<i>Sins!</i>

1026
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:46,031
<i>If I don't contact them soon,</i>

1027
01:01:46,065 --> 01:01:48,467
<i>they won't land
and I'll be stranded.</i>

1028
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,336
<i>She hates it here.</i>

1029
01:01:51,236 --> 01:01:54,273
<i>Don't blame her.</i>

1030
01:01:54,306 --> 01:01:56,608
<i>Gonna leave me
and go be with them.</i>

1031
01:01:58,544 --> 01:02:00,379
<i>I won't see her again.</i>

1032
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,229
- Can't sleep?
- No.

1033
01:02:17,262 --> 01:02:18,897
Yeah, me neither.

1034
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,242
What's that?

1035
01:02:32,411 --> 01:02:33,946
My mom's journal.

1036
01:02:36,348 --> 01:02:39,051
Ben must've put it in
my bag for me to have.

1037
01:02:40,386 --> 01:02:41,954
What's it say?

1038
01:02:41,987 --> 01:02:43,589
I don't know.
Doesn't matter.

1039
01:02:44,691 --> 01:02:46,358
You don't wanna know
about your mother?

1040
01:02:48,994 --> 01:02:52,164
She died when I was
a baby, so...

1041
01:02:52,197 --> 01:02:54,600
So? You can still know
what she was like.

1042
01:02:54,634 --> 01:02:56,268
<i>Dead, she's dead.</i>

1043
01:02:56,301 --> 01:02:58,170
That's what she's like.

1044
01:02:58,203 --> 01:02:59,471
I lost my parents, too,

1045
01:02:59,505 --> 01:03:00,939
you don't see me
yelling about it.

1046
01:03:00,973 --> 01:03:02,040
I'm not yelling about it.

1047
01:03:02,074 --> 01:03:03,108
<i>This is yelling!</i>

1048
01:03:03,142 --> 01:03:04,343
Sorry.

1049
01:03:07,346 --> 01:03:09,148
It's just
I would give anything

1050
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:12,151
to have something that kept
my parents alive for me.

1051
01:03:12,184 --> 01:03:13,419
Yeah, well,
maybe I would, too.

1052
01:03:13,452 --> 01:03:16,021
You do. You have it.
The book's right there.

1053
01:03:16,054 --> 01:03:17,489
- I can't.
- Why not?

1054
01:03:17,523 --> 01:03:19,258
Because I can't read,
Viola.

1055
01:03:25,464 --> 01:03:28,967
Aaron burned all the books
when we were kids.

1056
01:03:30,269 --> 01:03:33,071
He thought that being
born with the Noise

1057
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:35,541
was enough
of an education.

1058
01:03:35,574 --> 01:03:39,945
<i>Only Noise
can be light in the darkness.</i>

1059
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:43,449
I could read some to you
if you'd like.

1060
01:03:47,019 --> 01:03:48,020
Please.

1061
01:03:55,427 --> 01:03:57,429
It says "K.H."

1062
01:03:59,398 --> 01:04:01,166
Karyssa.

1063
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,568
It's beautiful.

1064
01:04:04,436 --> 01:04:06,706
Okay.

1065

What happened?

What's next,
what happened?

1114
01:06:30,016 --> 01:06:32,217
That's it,
that's her last entry.

1115
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:38,190
It wasn't the Spackle.

1116
01:06:40,459 --> 01:06:42,294
The men killed the women.

1117

<i>Men must kill.</i>

1118

<i>Here, men must kill.
Men must kill.</i>

1119
01:06:48,768 --> 01:06:50,302
<i>I'm gonna kill him.
I'm gonna kill him.</i>

1120
01:06:50,335 --> 01:06:51,503
<i>Unwanted. Weak.</i>

1121
01:06:51,536 --> 01:06:52,772
<i>Killed my mom.</i>

1122

<i>Do you just believe
everything that guy says?</i>

1123

<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

1124
01:06:54,606 --> 01:06:55,540
<i>Killed my mom
and killed all those women.</i>

<i>The mayor doesn't know</i>

1133
01:07:12,424 --> 01:07:13,425
<i>Todd!</i>

1134
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:19,297
<i>Give her up!</i>

1135
01:07:20,633 --> 01:07:22,167
<i>We don't need this.</i>

1136
01:07:45,858 --> 01:07:47,459
Leave it.
Leave all this.

1137
01:07:47,492 --> 01:07:48,326
Get the kids to the barn.

1138
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,194
Don't go in
without a weapon!

1139
01:07:49,227 --> 01:07:50,663
To the south!
Check the doors!

1140
01:07:50,697 --> 01:07:51,731
Go down
into the basement!

1141
01:07:51,764 --> 01:07:52,799
Nothin' left!

1142
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:56,703
Sit there. Wait inside.

1143
01:07:56,736 --> 01:07:59,604
You gotta go to your dad.
Bill, take your kid!

1144
01:08:00,505 --> 01:08:01,406
Close all the doors!

1145
01:08:03,776 --> 01:08:05,377
Move!

1146
01:08:08,513 --> 01:08:09,782
<i>Viola.</i>

1147
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:36,743
Hildy.

1148
01:08:36,776 --> 01:08:38,778
David.

1149
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:40,947
You have a lot of gall
coming here.

1150
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,348
The law says any
Prentisstown man we catch

1151
01:08:43,381 --> 01:08:44,884
gets the rope.

1152
01:08:45,852 --> 01:08:47,720
Funny.

1153
01:08:47,754 --> 01:08:50,757
I didn't see young Todd out
on the gallows as we rode in.

1154
01:09:00,365 --> 01:09:01,500
He here?

1155
01:09:02,869 --> 01:09:04,402
Read my mind.

1156
01:09:06,471 --> 01:09:08,473
We're simply here
for the girl.

1157
01:09:08,507 --> 01:09:09,942
We now have
a common enemy.

1158
01:09:11,778 --> 01:09:15,614
I'm not handing over a woman
to any man of Prentisstown.

1159
01:09:19,384 --> 01:09:21,453
She's not a victim,
she's a spy.

1160
01:09:23,522 --> 01:09:24,924
Come from a new ship,

1161
01:09:27,059 --> 01:09:29,662
here to steal
everything you have.

1162
01:09:29,695 --> 01:09:32,497
Your land,
the fields you toil and sweat over

1163
01:09:32,531 --> 01:09:35,701
endless day
after endless day,

1164
01:09:35,735 --> 01:09:38,104
but we're gonna take
their ship before it takes us.

1165
01:09:38,137 --> 01:09:39,672
And the good people
of Farbranch

1166
01:09:39,705 --> 01:09:42,041
are more than welcome
to join us.

1167
01:09:42,074 --> 01:09:44,342
But I need that girl
before she warns them.

1168
01:09:44,376 --> 01:09:45,711
Not this time.

1169
01:09:46,846 --> 01:09:48,613
You're a liar!

1170
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,968
Hello?

1171
01:10:16,809 --> 01:10:18,077
Hey.

1172
01:10:18,744 --> 01:10:20,612
It's okay.

1173
01:10:20,646 --> 01:10:21,948
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

1174
01:10:22,882 --> 01:10:24,382
Hildy sent me.

1175
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:26,819
<i>I'll get the girl,</i>

1176
01:10:26,853 --> 01:10:28,054
<i>bring her to Prentiss.</i>

1177
01:10:29,655 --> 01:10:31,489
I'll ask you once.

1178
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:34,727
Put down your weapons,
this isn't a fair fight.

1179
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,730
We'll show no mercy to anyone
who stands in our way.

1180
01:10:37,763 --> 01:10:39,531
Remember
who he is.

1181
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,035
Don't let him get
in your head.

1182
01:10:43,069 --> 01:10:46,072
<i>"I am the circle,
the circle is me."</i>

1183
01:10:46,105 --> 01:10:48,506
<i>We can't win.
Surrender.</i>

1184
01:10:50,142 --> 01:10:52,712
<i>Not worth the fight.
No choice.</i>

1185
01:11:01,486 --> 01:11:02,755
What is it?
What is it?

1186
01:11:02,788 --> 01:11:04,556
<i>Save her, save her. Viola.</i>

1187
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:12,031
The hell happened?

1188
01:11:15,801 --> 01:11:18,037
You ready?

1189
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,171
<i>Damn,
she kicked his ass.</i>

1190
01:11:19,205 --> 01:11:21,539
- Todd?
- Yeah, yeah, let's go.

1191
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:23,575
This way.

1192
01:11:30,917 --> 01:11:32,584
<i>We're comin' for ya!</i>

1193
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:46,431
<i>Angel!</i>

1194
01:11:48,067 --> 01:11:49,936
<i>Martyr! Judgment!</i>

1195
01:11:52,905 --> 01:11:54,539
<i>You cannot be saved!</i>

1196
01:11:56,175 --> 01:11:57,843
Drop it!

1197
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,114
Okay, okay.

1198
01:12:02,148 --> 01:12:04,050
<i>Sin rots the soul.</i>

1199
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:06,118
- <i>Weak.</i>
- Get down!

1200
01:12:08,955 --> 01:12:10,022
<i>Coward!</i>

1201
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:17,096
No, no!

1202
01:12:17,129 --> 01:12:19,265
Keep your head down!

1203
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:20,900
<i>I'm scared.</i>

1204
01:12:20,933 --> 01:12:22,802
<i>Is it Second Wave?</i>

1205
01:12:22,835 --> 01:12:24,602
<i>Finally got her.</i>

1206
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:26,806
<i>Got you now.</i>

1207
01:12:32,577 --> 01:12:35,014
This is your chance
to save the boy's life.

1208
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:38,117
Bring me the girl

1209
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:40,252
and I promise no harm
will come to your son.

1210
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,755
<i>You can save him.</i>

1211
01:12:43,222 --> 01:12:44,589
Where is he?

1212
01:12:45,858 --> 01:12:47,093
Right in there.

1213
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,162
Todd!

1214
01:12:50,196 --> 01:12:52,198
- <i>Ben. Is that Ben?</i>
- Son! Are you here?

1215
01:12:52,231 --> 01:12:54,532
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

1216
01:12:54,566 --> 01:12:56,035
Todd? Todd.

1217
01:12:56,469 --> 01:12:57,703
- Hey.
- Whoa.

1218
01:12:57,737 --> 01:12:58,771
Son.

1219
01:12:58,804 --> 01:12:59,939
Todd!

1220
01:13:01,974 --> 01:13:04,542
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

1221
01:13:06,846 --> 01:13:07,847
Ben...

1222
01:13:09,815 --> 01:13:11,183
I read the journal.

1223
01:13:18,024 --> 01:13:19,557
<i>I say we smoke him out.</i>

1224
01:13:19,591 --> 01:13:20,993
<i>He can't go nowhere.</i>

1225
01:13:21,427 --> 01:13:23,729
<i>No more games.</i>

1226
01:13:23,763 --> 01:13:24,964
Time's running out!

1227
01:13:24,997 --> 01:13:27,599
<i>She's gonna die.</i>

1228
01:13:28,868 --> 01:13:30,036
You've got one more minute!

1229
01:13:30,069 --> 01:13:32,604
<i>Shoot her out
so we can get her outta here.</i>

1230
01:13:34,907 --> 01:13:36,242
We couldn't do anything, son.

1231
01:13:37,176 --> 01:13:38,610
We tried.

1232
01:13:38,644 --> 01:13:41,113
But it was chaos.

1233
01:13:41,147 --> 01:13:44,683
The best we could do
was keep you safe.

1234
01:13:49,021 --> 01:13:51,623
How could you keep this
from me?

1235
01:13:51,657 --> 01:13:53,959
- No. No.
- My whole life you lied to me.

1236
01:13:53,993 --> 01:13:56,195
No, we thought
we could protect you.

1237
01:13:57,797 --> 01:13:58,931
That's not protecting me,

1238
01:13:58,964 --> 01:14:00,666
- that's lying to me.
- I'm sorry.

1239
01:14:00,699 --> 01:14:02,268
Let me protect you now.

1240
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:12,211
Let me go in there
and get the girl.

1241
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:13,646
I can get her out.

1242
01:14:14,046 --> 01:14:15,114
Hey.

1243
01:14:15,147 --> 01:14:16,916
Hey!

1244
01:14:16,949 --> 01:14:19,118
<i>I'm sorry, Pa.
I'm sorry.</i>

1245
01:14:27,193 --> 01:14:29,695
Whoa.
I got it. I got it.

1246
01:14:46,178 --> 01:14:47,680
<i>Where is she?</i>

1247
01:14:47,713 --> 01:14:49,782
<i>I don't trust him,
I don't trust him.</i>

1248
01:14:56,889 --> 01:14:59,058
Thank you, Ben.

1249
01:14:59,091 --> 01:15:00,793
I knew I could rely on you.

1250
01:15:20,112 --> 01:15:22,414
- <i>What's she gonna do?</i>
- Got you now, girl.

1251
01:15:22,448 --> 01:15:24,450
<i>What's she gonna do?</i>

1252
01:15:24,483 --> 01:15:26,285
Pleasure to see you again,
young lady.

1253
01:15:27,253 --> 01:15:30,322
I wish it was
under better circumstances.

1254
01:15:53,045 --> 01:15:54,380
<i>Todd Hewitt!</i>

1255

- <i>Preacher!
- Come on. Come on!</i>

1256
01:15:57,016 --> 01:15:58,450
Go! Come on!

1257
01:15:58,484 --> 01:16:00,386
<i>I have been
shown the river</i>

1258

<i>that is the water of life!</i>

1259
01:16:10,029 --> 01:16:11,330
Viola, get in the boat!

1260
01:16:15,034 --> 01:16:16,235
Get in the boat!

1261
01:16:16,268 --> 01:16:18,437
- Todd, I can't swim!
- You won't have to, get in!

1262
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:26,879
Come on!

1263
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:28,747
<i>Go, go. Go, go, go!</i>

1264
01:16:32,985 --> 01:16:34,253
<i>Todd Hewitt!</i>

1265
01:16:34,286 --> 01:16:38,224
<i>And he was thrown
into the lake of fire!</i>

1266
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:43,829
Hyah!

1267
01:16:47,066 --> 01:16:48,500
Hyah!

1268
01:16:58,811 --> 01:17:00,179
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

1269
01:17:01,847 --> 01:17:03,015
No, no, no, no, no!

1270
01:17:28,907 --> 01:17:30,109
Viola!

1271
01:17:34,179 --> 01:17:35,481
No!

1272
01:17:37,383 --> 01:17:38,417
<i>Martyr!</i>

1273
01:17:38,817 --> 01:17:41,020
Todd! Todd!

1274
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,792
Todd, Todd!

1275
01:17:52,931 --> 01:17:54,466
<i>Manchee!</i>

1276
01:17:57,102 --> 01:17:59,438
- Manchee!
- Todd!

1277
01:18:00,139 --> 01:18:01,840
Viola!

1278
01:18:03,075 --> 01:18:04,910
Viola! Swim to the boat!

1279
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:23,095
Grab my hand. I got you.

1280
01:18:24,997 --> 01:18:26,398
Grab the boat.

1281
01:18:27,599 --> 01:18:29,001
Come on.

1282
01:18:29,034 --> 01:18:30,302
Manchee!

1283
01:18:32,237 --> 01:18:33,472
Manchee! Manchee!

1284
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:35,507
Aaron! Aaron, don't!

1285
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:37,042
No!

1286
01:18:39,178 --> 01:18:40,279
Todd, no!

1287
01:18:40,647 --> 01:18:42,314
Todd, no!

1288
01:18:45,451 --> 01:18:46,885
Aaron!

1289
01:18:46,919 --> 01:18:49,388
No! No! No!

1290
01:18:50,289 --> 01:18:51,357
No!

1291
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:12,177
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt,</i>

1292
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:14,146
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

1293
01:19:14,179 --> 01:19:15,381
<i>Dead. I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

1294
01:19:15,414 --> 01:19:16,515
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

1295
01:19:16,548 --> 01:19:17,616
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

1296
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:18,984
<i>Gone, dead. I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

1297
01:19:19,017 --> 01:19:20,152
<i>He's dead. I'm Todd Hewitt.</i>

1298
01:19:20,185 --> 01:19:22,521
<i>Manchee. My Manchee's gone.
Dead. Stop!</i>

1299
01:19:22,554 --> 01:19:25,524
<i>Be tough. Crying's weak.
Stop! Todd, stop it!</i>

1300
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:28,026
<i>Be tough, be tough.
Manchee, Manchee.</i>

1301
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,529
<i>Be tough. Dead. Shut up, Todd.
Come on, be a man.</i>

1302
01:19:30,562 --> 01:19:31,964
<i>Everything dies.</i>

1303
01:19:37,102 --> 01:19:38,270
I'm so sorry, Todd.

1304
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,908
<i>It's just a dog.</i>

1305
01:19:50,983 --> 01:19:53,485
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt. Kill him.</i>

1306
01:19:53,519 --> 01:19:55,621
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I'm Todd Hewitt. Kill him.</i>

1307
01:19:58,123 --> 01:19:59,692
<i>Dead. Death.</i>

1308
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:05,931
Fine.

1309
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:16,575
Todd!

1310
01:20:18,243 --> 01:20:19,378
Todd!

1311
01:20:29,188 --> 01:20:31,023
This way
looks more built up.

1312
01:20:31,056 --> 01:20:32,991
It must be the way to Haven.

1313
01:20:40,365 --> 01:20:41,600
I've seen these,

1314
01:20:41,634 --> 01:20:44,002
on infrastructure plans
on the ship.

1315
01:20:44,036 --> 01:20:46,138
They're supports
for a monorail.

1316
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:15,501
<i>Stop! Be a man.</i>

1317
01:21:15,534 --> 01:21:17,402
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

1318
01:21:17,436 --> 01:21:18,604
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

1319
01:21:18,638 --> 01:21:20,773
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

1320
01:21:20,807 --> 01:21:22,709
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

1321
01:21:22,742 --> 01:21:24,543
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

1322
01:21:29,481 --> 01:21:30,650
I liked him.

1323
01:21:33,485 --> 01:21:35,153
Yeah, me too.

1324
01:21:36,288 --> 01:21:38,090
He was the best dog
I ever knew.

1325
01:21:39,826 --> 01:21:41,794
He was the only dog
you ever knew.

1326
01:22:08,721 --> 01:22:10,589
You're a good man,
Todd Hewitt.

1327
01:22:17,229 --> 01:22:19,164
I'm not gonna kiss you.

1328
01:22:20,198 --> 01:22:21,834
I wasn't thinking...

1329
01:22:41,153 --> 01:22:44,556
<i>"I am the circle
and the circle is me."</i>

1330
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:46,491
<i>"I am the circle...</i>

1331
01:22:48,427 --> 01:22:51,864
<i>"I am the circle
and the circle is me."</i>

1332
01:23:19,191 --> 01:23:21,393
It's an old
Expansion Class ship.

1333
01:23:21,426 --> 01:23:23,362
A lot like mine,
only first generation.

1334
01:23:24,931 --> 01:23:26,264
<i>Whoa.</i>

1335
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:34,172
Careful! This ship goes down
another three or four levels.

1336
01:23:34,206 --> 01:23:35,675
This is the wing.

1337
01:23:40,913 --> 01:23:43,315
This must be
what my family came here on.

1338
01:23:57,529 --> 01:23:59,364
Todd, look.

1339
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,976
<i>Gotta keep goin'.
Not far behind.</i>

1340
01:24:10,009 --> 01:24:11,309
We gotta keep moving.

1341
01:24:11,944 --> 01:24:12,979
We gotta get to Haven.

1342
01:24:13,012 --> 01:24:15,480
No, there isn't time.

1343
01:24:15,514 --> 01:24:17,582
There's an emergency
transmitter two floors down.

1344
01:24:17,616 --> 01:24:19,217
If it still works,
I can use it.

1345
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:28,260
You okay?

1346
01:24:28,293 --> 01:24:30,362
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

1347
01:24:34,667 --> 01:24:36,268
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1348
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:39,939
<i>Cool. This is cool.</i>

1349
01:24:39,972 --> 01:24:41,741
What's all this?

1350
01:24:41,774 --> 01:24:43,743
Cryo-chambers for horses.

1351
01:24:43,776 --> 01:24:45,310
There's a horse in here?

1352
01:24:45,343 --> 01:24:47,379
There were horses in here.

1353
01:24:47,412 --> 01:24:48,648
It's how they all got here.

1354
01:24:52,384 --> 01:24:54,286
That is so cool.

1355
01:24:55,722 --> 01:24:57,222
This way.

1356
01:25:03,328 --> 01:25:04,964
You're all right.

1357
01:25:25,084 --> 01:25:27,586
<i>Lost. She's lost.</i>

1358
01:26:16,535 --> 01:26:18,403
<i>I don't want her to leave.</i>

1359
01:26:18,436 --> 01:26:20,605
<i>She's gonna go home,
she's gone.</i>

1360
01:26:21,573 --> 01:26:22,574
Okay.

1361
01:26:23,176 --> 01:26:25,477
<i>Bye. This is goodbye.</i>

1362
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:27,579
<i>Ask her, go on.
Just ask her.</i>

1363
01:26:30,917 --> 01:26:31,951
No!

1364
01:26:33,085 --> 01:26:34,486
What?

1365
01:26:36,856 --> 01:26:38,724
The antenna's
broken off.

1366
01:26:44,396 --> 01:26:46,498
We were so close.

1367
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,135
If you get everything ready
down here,

1368
01:26:49,168 --> 01:26:51,369
I could probably climb it.

1369
01:26:51,403 --> 01:26:52,672
<i>Help her.</i>

1370
01:26:53,706 --> 01:26:55,540
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1371
01:26:56,843 --> 01:26:58,644
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

1372
01:26:58,678 --> 01:26:59,912
All right.

1373
01:27:09,722 --> 01:27:10,990
Boy's inside.

1374
01:27:12,825 --> 01:27:13,993
And the girl?

1375
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:17,596
I didn't see her.

1376
01:27:17,629 --> 01:27:19,397
Surround the ship
and wait for my order.

1377
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:27,807
<i>We gotta get her home.</i>

1378
01:27:31,811 --> 01:27:33,378
<i>Shit.</i>

1379
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:36,414
<i>Breathe.</i>

1380
01:27:36,849 --> 01:27:37,950
<i>Then go.</i>

1381
01:27:40,552 --> 01:27:43,689
Okay. I got it. I got it.

1382
01:27:43,723 --> 01:27:46,524
<i>Come on, Todd.
You got this.</i>

1383
01:27:49,195 --> 01:27:50,997
<i>Don't look down. Whoa!</i>

1384
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:52,665
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

1385
01:28:06,112 --> 01:28:07,512
<i>Get her home.</i>

1386
01:28:48,654 --> 01:28:51,023
<i>Closing in.
This is it.</i>

1387
01:28:51,057 --> 01:28:52,490
<i>I hope this works.</i>

1388
01:28:54,927 --> 01:28:56,062
<i>Please work.</i>

1389
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,070
<i>Sacrifice!</i>

1390
01:29:06,305 --> 01:29:07,539
Give up!

1391
01:29:07,572 --> 01:29:09,976
Todd Hewitt!

1392
01:29:11,677 --> 01:29:15,281
<i>Todd Hewitt!</i>

1393
01:29:15,314 --> 01:29:17,183
<i>How're we gonna
find him in there?</i>

1394
01:29:17,216 --> 01:29:18,985
<i>Todd Hewitt!</i>

1395
01:29:20,786 --> 01:29:23,189
Time to show yourself, son.

1396
01:29:23,222 --> 01:29:25,124
Or I'm gonna shoot Ben.

1397
01:29:25,157 --> 01:29:27,893
No! Don't listen
to him, Todd!

1398
01:29:33,598 --> 01:29:34,467
Let go!

1399
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:35,801
<i>You murderer!</i>

1400
01:29:35,835 --> 01:29:38,603
I showed those women no mercy.

1401
01:29:40,139 --> 01:29:43,676
I couldn't tell the voice
of God from the Noise.

1402
01:29:43,709 --> 01:29:45,543
<i>I am the sinner!</i>

1403
01:29:45,577 --> 01:29:47,545
<i>Kill me!</i>

1404
01:29:47,579 --> 01:29:49,115
Kill me.

1405
01:29:53,585 --> 01:29:55,587
<i>Purify my sin!</i>

1406
01:29:58,024 --> 01:29:59,624
Purify me!

1407
01:30:00,826 --> 01:30:03,229
<i>Kill me!</i>

1408
01:30:06,032 --> 01:30:07,666
<i>I am the sinner!</i>

1409
01:30:08,934 --> 01:30:11,937
<i>I am baptized with fire!</i>

1410
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:13,305
No! No! No!

1411
01:30:13,339 --> 01:30:15,341
<i>Atone.</i>

1412
01:30:15,374 --> 01:30:18,576
<i>Atone. Atone. Atone.</i>

1413
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:21,781
<i>Atone. Atone.</i>

1414
01:30:23,082 --> 01:30:25,684
<i>I am the sinner!</i>

1415
01:30:29,822 --> 01:30:31,290
<i>Atone.</i>

1416
01:30:58,751 --> 01:31:01,087
<i>I know what he did.
You're a murderer.</i>

1417
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,321
<i>Todd.</i>

1418
01:31:10,796 --> 01:31:11,897
Where is she?

1419
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:14,333
Let him go.

1420
01:31:15,668 --> 01:31:17,937
Todd, where is the girl?

1421
01:31:19,338 --> 01:31:21,340
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

1422
01:31:21,373 --> 01:31:22,741
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

1423
01:31:22,775 --> 01:31:24,076
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd...</i>

1424
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:25,311
No, wait!

1425
01:31:25,344 --> 01:31:26,679
Ben!

1426
01:31:29,815 --> 01:31:31,616
Ben!
You son of a bitch!

1427
01:31:32,885 --> 01:31:33,953
You're all right,
you're all right.

1428
01:31:33,986 --> 01:31:35,087
You're all right.
I'm right here.

1429
01:31:35,121 --> 01:31:36,722
- Okay? You're all good.
- I'm so sorry.

1430
01:31:36,755 --> 01:31:37,957
- I know, it's okay.
- I'm sorry,

1431
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:39,258
we shouldn't have lied to you.

1432
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:40,826
I know, it's all right,
it's all right.

1433
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,828
I'm here. I'm here.
I'm here. I'm here.

1434
01:31:44,763 --> 01:31:47,266
If you want a real long
goodbye with your father,

1435
01:31:47,299 --> 01:31:48,968
you should
give me the girl.

1436
01:31:49,001 --> 01:31:50,836
- I'm right here.
- We should've stood up to him.

1437
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:52,138
I know, I know.

1438
01:31:52,171 --> 01:31:54,406
Just relax!
Just lie down. Ben.

1439
01:31:56,876 --> 01:31:58,777
<i>Keep him safe, Ben.
Keep him safe.</i>

1440
01:31:58,811 --> 01:32:00,779
<i>Protect...</i>

1441
01:32:00,813 --> 01:32:02,681
That girl
is using you, Todd.

1442
01:32:03,315 --> 01:32:04,817
She hates you.

1443
01:32:06,152 --> 01:32:07,786
She hates your Noise.

1444
01:32:23,836 --> 01:32:24,870
<i>Where's my knife?</i>

1445
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:29,141
<i>Yes.</i>

1446
01:32:43,789 --> 01:32:45,991
Did you hear that?

1447
01:32:46,025 --> 01:32:48,427
She just called them!

1448
01:32:53,899 --> 01:32:57,469
Four thousand people
on their way to destroy us.

1449
01:33:00,272 --> 01:33:01,941
Are you happy now, Todd?

1450
01:33:03,008 --> 01:33:04,977
Huh? You think you won?

1451
01:33:12,785 --> 01:33:14,253
<i>I'm Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

1452
01:33:14,286 --> 01:33:15,854
You think
you can hide from me, Todd?

1453
01:33:15,888 --> 01:33:17,122
<i>Fight. Shut up.</i>

1454
01:33:17,156 --> 01:33:19,425
Been hearing your Noise
since you were born.

1455
01:33:26,298 --> 01:33:28,968
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt. Quiet.</i>

1456
01:33:29,001 --> 01:33:30,836

1459
01:33:38,043 --> 01:33:39,378
<i>Shut up!
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

1460
01:33:39,411 --> 01:33:41,247
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

1461
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,449
<i>I am Todd Hewitt.

<i>I am Todd Hewitt.
I am Todd Hewitt.</i>

1465
01:33:48,053 --> 01:33:49,288
<i>He killed my mom.</i>

1466
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:57,363
<i>Your Noise
is your power.</i>

1467
01:33:58,397 --> 01:34:02,067
<i>Your Noise could've been
your power, Todd.</i>

1468
01:34:02,101 --> 01:34:04,203
<i>Power! Noise.</i>

1469
01:34:04,236 --> 01:34:06,205
<i>Power.</i>

1470
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:10,876
<i>Could've been your power,
Todd. Noise.</i>

1471
01:34:12,945 --> 01:34:15,314
You're not a killer, Todd.

1472
01:34:17,916 --> 01:34:19,551
It's just not in your blood.

1473
01:34:20,919 --> 01:34:22,488
It's in mine.

1477
01:34:37,336 --> 01:34:39,505

1478
01:34:50,316 --> 01:34:53,585
<i>You taught those men to kill.</i>

1479
01:34:53,619 --> 01:34:55,988
<i>Because you couldn't stand
the thought of all those women</i>

for what you really are.</i>

1481
01:35:03,962 --> 01:35:05,464
And what is that?

1482
01:35:06,365 --> 01:35:08,000
<i>A coward.</i>

<i>A coward. A coward.</i>

<i>Coward! Coward!</i>

<i>Look

1489
01:35:20,112 --> 01:35:22,147
- <i>Kill to survive.</i>
- <i>Look at what you did!</i>

1490
01:35:22,181 --> 01:35:24,416
- <i>You murderer!</i>
- <i>Turn around!</i>

1491
01:35:25,617 --> 01:35:27,419
<i>You killed us all!</i>

1492

Todd.

01:35:50,509 --> 01:35:51,610
Todd.

1495
01:35:52,712 --> 01:35:54,613
Todd.

1496
01:35:54,647 --> 01:35:57,082
It's okay, I'm here. Todd.

1497
01:35:57,116 --> 01:35:59,084
No, no. I'm here.

1498
01:36:15,501 --> 01:36:16,969
They're here.

1499
01:36:28,748 --> 01:36:31,216
Get the hell out of here!
We gotta go. Run!

1500
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,551
We did it.

1501
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:36,155
No, no. I'm here.

1502

We did it.

1503
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:40,559
We did it.

1504
01:36:52,037 --> 01:36:53,673
<i>I'm alive.</i>

1505
01:36:57,376 --> 01:37:01,146
<i>Where am I?
I'm alive, I'm alive!</i>

1506
01:37:09,321 --> 01:37:11,557
<i>I'm alive. How am I alive?</i>

1507
01:37:15,494 --> 01:37:16,962
Hey.

1508
01:37:18,665 --> 01:37:21,967
<i>Viola. She's here.
Viola's here.</i>

1509
01:37:22,702 --> 01:37:24,336
Where else would I be?

1510
01:37:27,807 --> 01:37:29,676
You okay?

1511
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:32,077
Yeah.

1512
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:33,479
You've been out for days.

1513
01:37:37,483 --> 01:37:39,451
Where are we?

1514
01:37:39,485 --> 01:37:41,688
- My ship.
- <i>Ship.</i>

1515

<i>Her ship. Her ship?</i>

1518
01:38:04,409 --> 01:38:05,778
So you're staying?

1519
01:38:05,812 --> 01:38:08,046
Yeah.

1520
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,816
<i>They made me promise
I would make it here.</i>

1521
01:38:09,849 --> 01:38:12,150
<i>Find a better life.</i>

1522
01:38:12,184 --> 01:38:14,152
<i>It's not exactly
what I'd imagined.</i>

1523
01:38:16,388 --> 01:38:18,791
It's growing on me.

1524
01:38:18,825 --> 01:38:20,425
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

1525
01:38:21,861 --> 01:38:23,595
You think
it'll grow on them, too?

1526
01:38:25,364 --> 01:38:26,666
We'll show them.

1527
01:38:29,836 --> 01:38:31,403
<i>Is she</i>

1528
01:38:32,104 --> 01:38:32,972
