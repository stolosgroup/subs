2
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,142
Mr. Lansky,

3
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,854
why are the American authorities
after you?

4
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,610
Well, apparently some
newspaper man wrote

5
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,318
that I had 300 million dollars.

6
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,494
Is it true?

7
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,663
I wish I had a million dollars.

8
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,749
They accuse me
of making a president.

9
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,793
Now, I don't know Mr. Nixon
any more

10
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,086
than what I've read
in the newspapers.

11
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,461
They claim I have 50 percent
of Lebanon casinos,

12
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,543
50 percent of Monte Carlo.

13
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,220
Now how ridiculous
can we really get?

14
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,005
Mr. Lansky,
is there such a thing

15
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,883
as organized crime?

16
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,098
I have no knowledge
on the subject.

17
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,401
<i>Listen Eva,</i>

18
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,494
<i>I'm in Florida, honey.</i>

19
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,867
<i>Daddy's here for work.</i>

20
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,160
<i>What do they have here?</i>

21
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,789
<i>They have oranges and gators
and Mickey Mouse.</i>

22
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,212
<i>Next time we can go
and I promise.</i>

23
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,092
Okay Eva,
can you put your mama on?

24
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,509
Christie, Christie,
Christie, please,

25
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,261
I know that the check bounced.

26
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:24,850
Okay, but that's...

27
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,136
Okay. That's why I'm in Miami.

28
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,599
I'm going to do
some book signings.

29
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,560
Yeah, sure they are, they...

30
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,599
They're putting me
in a fancy hotel,

31
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,183
they're gonna give me the...

32
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,899
Christie, I know
my responsibilities, all right?

33
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,114
Look Christie,
I'm trying my best, all right?

34
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:44,657
Trying my best.

35
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,135
- David Stone.
- Mr. Lansky, it's a pleasure.

36
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,336
How was your trip?

37
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,047
Fine, thanks, umm.

38
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,297
Hope you don't mind,
I got a coffee.

39
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,749
You mind sitting down there?

40
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,558
Uh, yeah sure.

41
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,520
Thank you.

42
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,856
Hello, Mr. Lansky,
how are you?

43
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,402
Fine, doll.

44
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,272
How's your mother feel?

45
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,983
Ah, good days and bad, you know.

46
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,193
- It's a mission.
- Yeah, I know all about that.

47
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,778
What can I get for you, honey?

48
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,872
We'll do a couple of
Tom sandwiches.

49
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,246
Middle slice the fatty cut
and an assortment of pickles.

50
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,748
So, the usual.

51
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,579
I'll pick out the best ones.

52
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,754
Thank you.

53
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,668
I'd like you to remove that.

54
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,838
Okay.

55
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,883
You're from Pittsburgh.

56
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,638
You graduated on scholarship
with honors from Princeton.

57
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,978
You were on the crime heat at
the Fort Wayne <i>News-Sentinel</i>

58
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,025
before you started
writing books.

59
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,273
You've got a wife, Christina,
and two young children,

60
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,903
Eva and Jack.

61
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,825
I make it a point of knowing
who I associate myself with.

62
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,363
Mr. Stone,
old business habits never die.

63
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,123
It's a complicated thing,
isn't it? Marriage, children.

64
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:48,638
I, uh... I've been reading
some articles about you.

65
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,930
Forget all that.

66
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,724
I'm here to tell you
the real story.

67
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,885
All right, well, that's great,
cause I'm...

68
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,638
I'm hereto write the real story.

69
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,815
Four packs a day, 60 years.

70
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,735
I finally work up the courage
to quit.

71
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,563
A week later,
I go to see my doctor.

72
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,692
He tells me I'm dying.

73
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,785
As a writer, I thought you would
appreciate the irony in that.

74
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,954
I do. I'm just... I'm very sorry
to hear that.

75
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,657
My circumstances offer me
the privilege

76
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,243
to pick who I want
to tell my story.

77
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,078
Your book on Kennedy
paid you well?

78
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,209
- I did okay.
- It's been a few years

79
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,507
since lady luck visited you.

80
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,010
Yeah, well history
doesn't always repeat itself.

81
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,214
When I was a young boy,

82
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,808
I spent my days
at the public library.

83
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,143
I read everything

84
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,393
and I have a particular interest
in history.

85
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,818
People see the same thing
from different perspectives,

86
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,313
and that fascinates me.

87
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,690
But what do you want from this?

88
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,947
Why does David Stone want to
write a book about Meyer Lansky?

89
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,241
Oh.

90
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,750
Everything that I've read
in history about you

91
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,296
says you're a complicated man

92
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,045
and maybe I like stories about
complicated people.

93
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,050
And I think that your story,
the real story...

94
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,213
I don't think
it's been told yet,

95
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,681
and I don't think
it's about one man,

96
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,351
I think
it's about the 20th century.

97
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,014
That was quite a speech,

98
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,519
but you didn't answer
the question.

99
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,019
I need the money.

100
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,447
Ah, there it is, the truth.

101
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,525
When I die,
the book is yours to sell.

102
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,238
Until then, you will show
the manuscript to no one.

103
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,370
Anything I choose to tell you
is off the record

104
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,952
until I give you permission
to put it in the book.

105
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,167
Without my approval, what
you have is a work of fiction.

106
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,373
- I won't incriminate myself.
- Okay.

107
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,630
Any conversations
you have about me

108
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,302
outside of our meetings,

109
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,675
- I want to know.
- Sure.

110
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:58,100
Betray me...
and there will be consequences.

111
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,053
Are these terms
agreeable to you?

112
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,066
Yes, sir.

113
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,938
I hope our collaboration
will be a successful one.

114
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,841
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, Christie,

115
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,934
Christie, it's me.

116
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,593
<i>Hey. Oh, it's okay, baby,</i>

117
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,178
<i>Mommy's got you.</i>

118
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,430
You okay?

119
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,445
You don't sound okay.

120
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,142
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

121
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,646
<i>Jack's got a 103 and he's not
holding his food down.</i>

122
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,855
Take him to a doctor.

123
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,105
<i>Excuse me?</i>

124
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,573
<i>Of course
I took him to the doctor.</i>

125
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,738
<i>Listen, I can't do this,
okay? Not now.</i>

126
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,990
Christie, I got a...

127
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,912
I got the chance to write
a new book.

128
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,655
All right? And it could be...

129
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,823
<i>Oh, David, no.</i>

130
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,867
- Could be something really good.
<i>- Look,</i>

131
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,711
<i>David, I called your publisher.</i>

132
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,708
<i>They had no idea
you were even in Miami,</i>

133
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,665
<i>which means you are lying to me.</i>

134
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,216
<i>I can't do this,
I have to go.</i>

135
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,423
<i>You said you read some stories</i>

136
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,857
<i>about me in the papers.</i>

137
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,234
My reputation has a habit
of preceding me.

138
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,112
When they don't know you
they put labels on you.

139
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,819
Master Stock Manipulator.

140
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:45,124
America's most successful
casino operator in history.

141
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,450
Mob's accountant.

142
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,127
The Feds even leaked the story
to the press

143
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,046
about me having
300 million dollars

144
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,132
squirreled away.

145
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,921
If you find out
who's out there guessing,

146
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,468
please be sure to let me know.

147
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,753
- Yeah.
- You don't get to keep it,

148
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,426
call me
and I'll give you a piece.

149
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,928
Fair enough.

150
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,600
The labels, are they accurate?

151
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,307
It's your book.
You decide.

152
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,432
Okay, all right.

153
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,814
Okay.

154
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:14,270
Now, you strike me as a rather
obsequious guy, David.

155
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,897
Quick to please.

156
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,527
Never thought of myself
that way.

157
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,949
- You're separated.
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,618
What does your wife
think about that?

159
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,990
Did she find you that way?

160
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,989
We're here to talk about you.

161
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,573
We are not here
to talk about me, Mr. Lansky.

162
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,919
No, no, no. We have to talk
about you and me.

163
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,166
- You know, I was married also.
- Yeah?

164
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,842
Yeah, twice.

165
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,920
You know what they say,
can't live with them,

166
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:41,932
can't shoot them.

167
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,477
So where do we start?

168
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,884
Let's start
when you were a child.

169
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,810
Russia.

170
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,980
The only thing
I remember about Russia,

171
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,233
is one day me and my uncle
crossing a path

172
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,939
and some Cossacks
ordered my uncle

173
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,819
to open his potato sack.

174
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,776
And toss a potato up in the air.

175
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,407
My Uncle obeyed.

176
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,369
Tossed a potato into the air,

177
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:13,204
and the Cossack takes out
this fucking sword and swoosh.

178
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,124
He wasn't aiming for the potato.

179
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,127
He was aiming
for my uncle's hand.

180
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,259
Cut it right off.
Tough guys.

181
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,431
With swords.
We didn't have a sword.

182
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,097
That was the difference.

183
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,554
I never forgot that.

184
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,230
I promised myself I'd never
be that helpless again.

185
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:40,155
The next time I'll be the one
holding the knife.

186
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,982
That's the only thing Russia
ever gave me.

187
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,113
What I saw that day,

188
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,531
made me stronger,
it sharpened me.

189
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,830
I wish I knew where that
cocksucker was today,

190
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,757
I'll show him
who the tough guy is.

191
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,677
The real story starts
in America.

192
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,425
<i>By the time I was 10,</i>

193
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,973
<i>I was sharp as a shiv.</i>

194
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,142
<i>My mind was my escape</i>

195
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,440
<i>and more than anything, numbers,</i>

196
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,984
<i>numbers gave my world
some order.</i>

197
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,403
<i>And for a kid with that kind
of interest in numbers,</i>

198
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,278
<i>there was nothing as thrilling
as a dice game.</i>

199
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,404
<i>I would watch them play.</i>

200
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,362
<i>But oh boy, if my old man
found out that was how</i>

201
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,742
<i>I was spending my time...</i>

202
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,910
My father? Everything he did,
he did for us.

203
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,165
He was an honest man
earning an honest living.

204
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,411
There's nothing wrong with that.

205
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,913
He wasn't living his life.

206
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,417
His life was living him.

207
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,717
I guess that's what we do.

208
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,466
We measure ourselves
against our fathers.

209
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,473
And you?
What was yours like?

210
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,143
My father died when I was young.

211
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,355
That must have been hard.

212
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,942
So being an honest man.
Being an honest father.

213
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,147
Yeah.

214
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,407
Is that beneath you?

215
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,285
What I knew was that
life wouldn't wait for me.

216
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,059
<i>It all happened so fast.</i>

217
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,466
<i>I put down the nickel
my mother gave me</i>

218
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:24,793
<i>to pick up some bread.</i>

219
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:28,930
<i>In a matter of seconds,</i>

220
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,633
<i>my nickel was gone.</i>

221
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,602
<i>Can you imagine having to tell
my mother and father</i>

222
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,178
<i>why we couldn't eat that night?</i>

223
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,140
He took your money
and you just felt ashamed.

224
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,274
It was rage.

225
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,695
You ever feel that, David?

226
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,740
A rage so strong
it changes the path you're on?

227
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,527
Never felt anything like that.

228
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,908
There are people
in this world who will try to

229
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,582
make you believe that
they are better than you,

230
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,876
that they can win
at your expense.

231
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:03,833
Rage is a tool we use
to look those people in the eye

232
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,959
and prove them wrong.

233
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,510
That's what drove you to win
a! Dice?

234
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,759
It did much more than drive me
to win.

235
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,515
It drove me to control the game.

236
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,054
<i>I calculated the odds</i>

237
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,066
<i>and payoffs.</i>

238
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,854
<i>Watched how the probabilities
ebbed and flowed,</i>

239
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,561
<i>but something didn't make sense.</i>

240
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,647
<i>I knew something was going on,</i>

241
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,692
<i>something invisible
that no one else could see.</i>

242
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,031
<i>And then I saw it.</i>

243
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,170
<i>A blink of the eye,
a scratch of the ear,</i>

244
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,873
<i>I figured out what these guys
were doing.</i>

245
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,009
<i>They rigged the game.</i>

246
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,712
<i>It was the outsider.</i>

247
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,471
<i>He was the one
controlling the game.</i>

248
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,010
And isn't that what we all want,
David?

249
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,810
The only winners in gambling,
as in life,

250
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,857
are those who control the game.

251
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,730
I think that you have the smile
of a beauty queen, all right?

252
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,808
I do... no. I don't think that
they stick out.

253
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,528
I don't think that
there's a huge gap, but...

254
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,771
Look, if you think they're
gonna straighten out,

255
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,623
then what's the point
of getting braces, right?

256
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:53,782
<i>Mom's right.</i>

257
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,865
Yeah, about what?

258
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,570
<i>We can't afford it.</i>

259
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,872
<i>That's why you don't want me
to get braces.</i>

260
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,995
She say that?
Put your mama on. Eva? Hmm?

261
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,671
<i>She said she can't talk.</i>

262
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,037
What do you mean she can't talk?

263
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,258
Is she can't talk
or she won't talk?

264
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,500
<i>She said she's not talking</i>

265
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,344
<i>to you, Daddy.</i>

266
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,129
Give Mama a message, all right?

267
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,427
- Can you do that?
<i>- Okay.</i>

268
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,054
And you tell her that the reason
that Daddy's in Miami

269
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,977
is because of a man
called Meyer Lansky.

270
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,144
<i>Meyor Lasky?</i>

271
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,721
It's okay, she'll know
who that is.

272
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,899
And you tell her that Mr. Lansky

273
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,399
hired Daddy personally to
write a book about his life.

274
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,687
And every publisher's
gonna want it

275
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,855
and it's going to be
a best-seller.

276
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:36,986
And when it is, Daddy's gonna
fix your smile, all right?

277
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,536
<i>Okay.</i>

278
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,456
Because that's what daddies do.
Yeah?

279
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,203
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Okay.

280
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,451
Don't you worry
about your teeth.

281
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,458
All right, you go tell her.

282
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,704
<i>I love you, Daddy.</i>

283
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,922
Okay, bye.

284
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,922
Sorry.

285
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,725
You look like hell.

286
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,432
Yeah, I didn't get much sleep.

287
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,773
Problems at home?

288
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,112
Okay, umm.

289
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,699
- Okay, today...
- These problems you're having,

290
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,956
I hope they're not interfering
with your ability to work.

291
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,004
I'm here. I'm fine.

292
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,998
Good.

293
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,341
I want to talk
about Bugsy Siegel.

294
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,717
It's Ben Siegel.

295
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,095
Say that name again.

296
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,428
<i>Ben Siegel, Bugsy.</i>

297
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,136
<i>He and Lansky had a bootlegging</i>

298
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,229
<i>and gambling racket</i>

299
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,432
<i>known as
the Bugs and Meyer Gang.</i>

300
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,063
<i>They were more than partners.</i>

301
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,110
<i>They were like brothers.</i>

302
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,608
<i>Lansky handled the numbers.</i>

303
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,259
<i>Bugsy was the muscle.</i>

304
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,615
All right, Ben.

305
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,739
Get! Up! Come on.

306
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,527
I think he gets the point.

307
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,279
<i>The only thing Bugsy enjoyed</i>

308
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,077
<i>more than killing
was the ladies.</i>

309
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,450
<i>Or maybe it was
the other way around.</i>

310
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,300
Luciano is looking for somebody

311
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,382
to run his transportation for him.

312
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,021
We offer Lucky
a deal on his distribution

313
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,848
too favorable to turn down.

314
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,026
Maybe we take a loss on it.

315
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,488
A loss?
How's that makes sense?

316
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,317
We'll be getting in on
the ground up with Lucky Luciano

317
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,278
and it will supply liquor
for our own operation

318
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,658
at the same time.

319
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,912
Profit margins
are justified tenfold.

320
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,669
I did the math for you.

321
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:52,871
Yeah, I'm sure you did.

322
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,384
What do you think of that guy,
Rosen?

323
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,836
He's friendly.

324
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,841
Gets along with the clientele,
why?

325
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,263
He should lose the ring.

326
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,013
It's distracting.

327
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,307
Sends the wrong message.

328
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,353
Rosen, why are you
so fucking happy?

329
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,600
<i>Our operation</i>

330
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,818
<i>was expanding fast.</i>

331
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:16,986
I am winning big.

332
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,113
<i>We had to keep our books clean,</i>

333
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,615
<i>keep the authorities
off the money trail.</i>

334
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,111
<i>If you're on a leaky boat,
you plug the holes.</i>

335
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,996
You're over by 200.

336
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,328
It was a good day at the track.

337
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,581
Yeah? Explain the numbers to me.

338
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:42,505
Uh, I had 9,320
on the seven 31...

339
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:46,220
573 against the favorite.

340
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,685
But you heard Green Emerald
was a winner.

341
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,979
So you, what?
You sweeten the pot?

342
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,559
You got to admit it.
He is good.

343
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,320
Yeah, well, I couldn't lose.

344
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,909
What did I tell you?
Trust your memory.

345
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,658
I... I know, I just got a lot
of numbers to remember.

346
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,165
You know how many gambling rooms
I run in this town?

347
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,754
The fact that you don't know
puts us at an advantage.

348
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,544
You also got no idea
how much money

349
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,501
comes through that door
each day, do you?

350
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,180
You know why?

351
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,344
The only one who knows is me

352
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:31,060
and I keep that number
in my head.

353
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,441
But you do know the percentage
of our bets don't you?

354
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,731
- 10 percent.
- 10 percent win or lose.

355
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,856
That's what sustains
this business.

356
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,487
Jimmy, is there anything
else you want to tell us?

357
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,369
Who else is gambling
with our money, maybe?

358
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,907
I swear, Bugsy,
I don't know nothing.

359
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,285
Did you just call me Bugsy?

360
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,172
E...

361
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:04,590
Everybody calls you that,
at least when you're not around.

362
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,808
Well, now I'm confused.

363
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,803
Am I not standing here?

364
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,097
What am I?

365
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,558
Am I a figment
of your imagination?

366
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,733
No.

367
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,857
No, no, because
that's what you just said.

368
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,984
That's what people call me
when I'm not around.

369
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,441
But I'm right here.

370
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,954
Meyer, do you... see me?

371
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,739
I see you, Benny.

372
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,226
I'm going to ask you
one more time, Jimmy.

373
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,541
Is there anything else
you want to tell us?

374
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,843
- No, I...
- Don't lie to me.

375
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,390
Don't forget to breathe.

376
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,846
They say breathings good.

377
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,228
Okay.

378
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:04,521
Now, tell me what I wanna know.

379
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:13,656
Um, I, uh... I... I may have heard
something about a dealer

380
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,958
at your room on Allen.

381
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,497
I-I don't remember his name.

382
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,204
Well, let me jog your memory,
huh?

383
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,506
Rosen, his name is Rosen.

384
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,462
And what exactly
did he tell you?

385
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,015
He was tipping off some players.

386
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,593
I don't know anything else,
I swear.

387
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,305
Sit up.

388
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,353
Thank you, Jimmy.

389
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,060
It's very helpful for us,
you know.

390
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:49,073
Oh, at least you die
with a clean conscience, right?

391
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,279
Who?

392
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,745
You.

393
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,623
God dammit
Next time, not in my ear.

394
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,838
First time me and you
met and here comes little Meyer,

395
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,886
walking through the snow
like the wandering Jew.

396
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,554
And my guys, I mean,

397
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,506
there must've been like
six of us or something, huh?

398
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,599
- Seven.
- We ask him to

399
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,927
empty his pockets,
if he wants to cross the street,

400
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,354
Ask? I don't recall any asking.

401
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,688
We politely instructed him
to remove the contents

402
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:25,984
of his pockets.

403
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,400
<i>Charlie Lucky Luciano,</i>

404
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,481
<i>father of modern
organized crime.</i>

405
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,362
<i>He created the governing body
of the Mafia</i>

406
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,534
<i>known as The Commission</i>

407
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,783
<i>and the National
Crime Syndicate,</i>

408
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:39,241
<i>Confederation of Italian,
Jewish, and Irish Gangsters.</i>

409
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,996
And you know what he says to us?

410
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,837
"Go fuck yourselves,
you guinea bastards."

411
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:48,087
That's right and the balls
on this one, huh?

412
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,043
I swear he would have
fought all six of us

413
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,055
before giving up a penny.

414
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,927
So what do I do?
I let him go.

415
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,472
Kid as fearless as that
deserves to be rewarded.

416
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,720
How many times I've gotta hear
this story, huh, Lucky?

417
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,520
Eh, this story is like wine,
Benny.

418
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,434
Gets better with age.

419
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,148
I prefer whiskey.

420
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,478
The point is...

421
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:16,157
you and me, Meyer, Italian, Jew,
none of that matters.

422
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,863
What matters is the way
we see the world.

423
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,040
We fight our way in
from the outside.

424
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,874
That's right.

425
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:26,125
This distribution business
you proposing,

426
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,414
we got ourselves a deal.

427
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,970
I'll drink to that.

428
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,811
See that hat check girl?

429
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,566
See how she's jotting
everything down?

430
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,565
Who's coming, who's going,
who's talking to who?

431
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:54,823
That all goes to Lucky.
It's attention to detail.

432
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,953
That's what makes Lucky, Lucky.

433
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,285
I'm paying attention
to a different detail.

434
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,875
Be right back.

435
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,005
Have a seat.

436
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:21,809
This is my friend, Meyer.

437
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,479
Meyer, please meet
Anne and Louise.

438
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,772
Hello.

439
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,060
Now tell me something,
what are two lovely ladies

440
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,672
like yourself doing
in a place like this?

441
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,275
The sign outside said
it was a drugstore.

442
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,402
I needed some toothpaste.

443
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,082
So what are you guys,

444
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,915
professional gamblers
or something?

445
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,583
Oh! Us?
No. No, no, no.

446
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,289
Then what line
of business are you in?

447
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,129
Truck rentals.

448
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,551
Truck rentals?
What does that mean?

449
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,420
Means we rent trucks.

450
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,973
Anne, look.

451
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,556
It's that big cheese gangster
from the newsreels.

452
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,104
They say he murdered
his own cousin.

453
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,848
- Louise.
- What?

454
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,023
Hey, how's about I go
over there tell him to, uh,

455
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,030
come give you a good old kiss
on the lips.

456
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,572
Very funny.

457
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,536
Okay.

458
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,624
What the hell?
Is he really doing it?

459
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,998
Oh, my God,
he's looking right at us.

460
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,504
Let's get out of here.

461
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,044
I'm not going anywhere.

462
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:43,095
The man is a killer
and these guys are his friends.

463
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,853
They seem harmless.

464
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,024
Suit yourself.

465
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:04,616
So you're in the truck
rental business?

466
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,124
Cold?

467
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,303
You need a coat. Hm?

468
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,882
Are you going to buy me one?

469
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,811
Fur.

470
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,478
Mink.

471
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:45,824
Leather trim down to the knees.

472
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,997
And what will you do
with the rest?

473
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,463
This?

474
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,761
This I'm going to keep
for our future.

475
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,407
Not too cold?

476
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,541
It's refreshing.

477
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,545
Oh, it's cold.

478
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,460
You're, uh, crazy.
Would you like one?

479
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,838
Sure, why not.

480
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,973
Thank you. I'm Maureen.

481
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,515
I'm David.

482
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,444
You're a writer.

483
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,853
Yeah. How do you know that?

484
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,565
I hear you typing at night?

485
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,740
Yeah?

486
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,907
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

487
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,486
Yeah, the walls are pretty thin.

488
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,406
Mm-hm. Spy novels?

489
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,159
I'm just here doing research.

490
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,961
On women in swimming pools?

491
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,464
That's good.
You're quick.

492
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,375
Very quick.

493
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,012
What about you?
Are you on vacation?

494
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Something like that.

495
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,477
Doctor, are you telling us that
Buddy will have to wear a brace

496
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,057
the rest of his life?

497
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,779
If you'd like, I'd be happy
to recommend specialists

498
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,448
who are developing
a new treatment

499
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,616
for cerebral palsy.

500
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,569
Answer the goddamn question.

501
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,199
In my professional opinion, yes.
He will.

502
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,629
The doctor said
there was no chance

503
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,088
he would ever be normal.

504
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,177
And you couldn't accept that?

505
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,686
I wasn't about to let my son
become weak and vulnerable.

506
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,853
No.

507
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,690
Not if I could help it.

508
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,192
Why did that bother you so much?

509
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,279
Why do you think?

510
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,618
Would it not bother you to see
your own son go through his life

511
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,624
at such a disadvantage?

512
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,418
I couldn't accept the odds.

513
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,463
The odds?

514
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,632
It was a mathematical equation,

515
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,928
the proportion of those
afflicted versus those cured,

516
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,095
the rate at which
those afflicted

517
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,844
were able to walk again.

518
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,174
Iran the numbers to my head.

519
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,430
I made the calculations.

520
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,261
You thought
you could beat the odds?

521
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,981
Yes.

522
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,315
What about faith?

523
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,152
- Faith?
- Mm-hmm.

524
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,519
Maybe God wanted him
to be like that.

525
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,531
Who?

526
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:15,781
Hello, God, hello?
Hell-fucking-Io.

527
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,536
I ain't hearing anybody
answer me.

528
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,347
Maybe he's got nothing
he wants to tell you.

529
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:25,206
And he made that clear,
didn't he?

530
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:29,804
You okay?

531
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,551
Let's do this.

532
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,986
Come on you.

533
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,940
Shut up, Rosen..

534
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,409
Get down, come on, get down.

535
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,291
Please, don't do anything
to him, please!

536
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,544
Hey, hey, woah, woah, woah,
enough.

537
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,074
Hey, what the fuck
is she doing here?

538
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,333
Well you told me
to bring her down.

539
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,133
Please, please,
he's a good man.

540
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:16,136
He's a father.
We have three children, please.

541
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,637
- Oh, God.
- Get up.

542
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,560
Oh, here, this is for you.

543
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,974
Your husband has been stealing
from me for years, Mrs. Rosen.

544
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,485
A nickel at a time,
but nickels adds up.

545
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:32,941
Mrs. Rosen, you knew about this,
didn't you?

546
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,444
No.

547
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,532
It's okay.

548
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,160
This is a warning.

549
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:49,791
But if you ever mention what
you see here today to anyone,

550
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:55,972
you'll be putting your life
and your children's in danger.

551
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,468
- You understand?
- Mm-hm.

552
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,721
Get her out of here.

553
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,437
May I help you up, Mrs. Rosen?

554
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,394
Come on, here we go.

555
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,694
Don't worry about him,
he's okay.

556
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,361
Where were you?

557
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,786
She was a mess, boss.
I was trying to be delicate.

558
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,706
Never let your emotions dictate
your actions ever again.

559
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,813
So you left them fatherless?

560
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,477
Three children.

561
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,684
He left them fatherless.

562
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,028
Is that what you tell yourself,
so you can sleep at night?

563
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,675
No, I don't have to tell myself
anything

564
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,190
when I go to sleep at night.

565
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,826
It's the way we live.
It's business.

566
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,077
What do you want,
a fucking fairy tale, David?

567
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,158
Go home and write a fairy tale.

568
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,951
<i>I want you to write</i>

569
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,044
<i>a book about me.</i>

570
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,838
<i>Would that be
of interest to you?</i>

571
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,836
<i>Yeah, uh,</i>

572
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,633
<i>I'd be very interested in that.</i>

573
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,084
<i>Good, I'll need you</i>

574
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,096
<i>to come to Miami.</i>

575
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,222
<i>There's a coffee shop
not far from where I live.</i>

576
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,845
<i>Take down this address.</i>

577
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,477
Okay?

578
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,761
We need more resources.

579
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,189
You been at this how long,
Frank? 15 years?

580
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,641
You got all the surveillance
you asked for.

581
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,184
What else are you expecting
to find here?

582
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,780
The 300 million dollars that
Lansky has stashed away.

583
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,029
This guy, Stone, can really
open the door for us.

584
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,280
Opening the door?

585
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,786
There are no more doors to open,
Frank.

586
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,536
Tax evasion, contempt of court,
they threw it all away.

587
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,909
And no indictment.

588
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,746
Lansky's impenetrable.

589
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,706
But that was 10 years ago.

590
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,920
And where's he been
for the last 10 years?

591
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,544
Federal prison? No.

592
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,256
Collins Avenue walking
that little Shih Tzu of his

593
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,217
up and down the board walk
with a smug face.

594
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,226
It's an embarrassment, frankly.

595
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,313
- We can fix that.
- Oh, yeah and how's that, Greg?

596
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,477
Even if that money
is out there somewhere,

597
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,099
we don't have the budget
to keep digging holes

598
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,391
to know where to try to find it.

599
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,738
We're talking about the most
notorious gangster

600
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,155
in American history.

601
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,732
We're just asking
for a little rope.

602
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,787
A little rope, so you two can
hang yourselves, huh?

603
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,161
RJ, just consider it.

604
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,889
Hey, hey.

605
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,436
Hi.

606
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:36,313
I was, um, I was
in the neighborhood.

607
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,270
Come in, come in, yeah.

608
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,740
That's, uh,
I was about to take a break,

609
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:47,160
so we need some glasses.

610
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,328
I've only got these glasses

611
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,654
but I'm sure
I can think of something.

612
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,782
One second.

613
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:57,913
Hm.

614
00:36:58,508 --> 00:36:59,794
How's the book going?

615
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,462
- The book?
- Yeah.

616
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,759
Uh, struggling.

617
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,471
I'm guessing that's
a good thing, you know?

618
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:10,686
Uh...

619
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,284
This the guy you're writing
the book about?

620
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,680
Yeah.

621
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,442
Meyer Lansky?

622
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,191
That's him.
Here, sit down.

623
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,447
Should I know who that is?

624
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,151
Uh, he ran a lot of casinos.

625
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,987
So, if you're into gambling,
I guess, but, um.

626
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,742
Hey, I'm so sorry
about the mess.

627
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,744
Oh stop, I don't care.

628
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,498
That's my daughter.
She's really cheeky.

629
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,878
- Oh.
- And looks a lot like me.

630
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,960
Oh, she's pretty cute.

631
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,922
Yeah, and I got a picture
of my son somewhere,

632
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,475
but, uh, 18 months.

633
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,723
He looks like a bug.

634
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:59,187
But uh, here you go,
and don't worry, you know?

635
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,688
- Yeah, I noticed.
- Yeah, okay.

636
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,282
To your, uh,

637
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:09,989
to a vacation in paradi...

638
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,286
Sorry.

639
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,045
You were saying?

640
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,125
To umm...

641
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,013
To vacation in paradise,
I guess.

642
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,064
Hey, hey.

643
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,229
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

644
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,695
Were you unfaithful
to your wife,

645
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,914
is that why you broke up?

646
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,125
Then what was it?

647
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,173
I tried to give her a good life

648
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,876
and tried to make her happy,
but it wasn't enough.

649
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:13,428
Happy on whose terms?
Yours or hers?

650
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,729
I was as unfaithful
as they come.

651
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,561
The way I see it, you do
what you can and feel alive.

652
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,980
It's time I told you about
the years leading up to the war.

653
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:31,827
I thought you'd quit.

654
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,237
I keep a pack as a reminder.

655
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,664
You want to conquer
your weaknesses,

656
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,333
keep them in plain sight.

657
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,208
Speaking of which, how was she?

658
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,673
Who?

659
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,875
You still have lipstick
on your neck.

660
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,470
Don't you shower? Jesus.

661
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:56,846
So, Lucky was in jail.

662
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,768
<i>I wanted to get him
out of prison.</i>

663
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,560
How fast can we put together
an army of men?

664
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,811
Fast.

665
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,479
For what?

666
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,982
I want to put the fear of God
into them.

667
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,609
<i>- Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>- Heil</i> Hitler.

668
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,158
We call upon our legislators
to evict to the fact that

669
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:28,249
Jew is as alien in body,
mind, and soul,

670
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,589
and is more dangerous to us
than all the others

671
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,091
by reason of its
parasitic nature.

672
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,345
<i>- Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>- Heil</i> Hitler.

673
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,523
This is a private function.

674
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,828
My name is Sasha Klein.

675
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,123
My parents come
from Ludmir, Poland.

676
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,534
I'm Jew.

677
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,371
You got something to say to me?

678
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,497
Say it now.

679
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,128
Jewish scum!

680
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,849
I would rather
have killed them all.

681
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,396
Why?

682
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:16,983
To show the world that as long
as Meyer Lansky was around,

683
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,070
they could never do that
to us again.

684
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,243
Never.

685
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:35,299
Rabbi Weiss calls the act
shameful and deplorable.

686
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:38,595
The rabbi says
there is no difference

687
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,264
between these so-called
Jewish gangsters

688
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,930
and the Nazi hoodlums
they attacked.

689
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,975
The grocer refuses to
take my money.

690
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,856
People look away from me
and the kids

691
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,566
when we walk down the side walk.

692
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,745
Now they all know.

693
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,684
Paul, come.

694
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,056
Come.

695
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,646
Buddy, you too.

696
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,356
Leave your father alone.

697
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,525
You have some thinking to do.

698
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,363
Buddy.

699
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,446
Listen to your mother.

700
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,216
Mr. Lansky,

701
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,097
I'm Lieutenant Haffenden
of the B3 division

702
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,474
of Naval Intelligence.

703
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,023
As I'm sure you know,
the Germans are sabotaging,

704
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,272
and destroying our ships
all over the North Atlantic.

705
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,363
I've read the papers.
It's terrible.

706
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,066
The enemy is here on our shores.

707
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,567
It's only
a matter of time before

708
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,035
there's an attack on our soil.

709
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,121
We need to ferret out
German spies.

710
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,494
Like you got a problem
with the Sicilians.

711
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:34,620
Because the Sicilians got
a problem with people like you,

712
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:35,795
the authorities.

713
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,247
The Mafia controls
the waterfront.

714
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,208
Are you suggesting that
I'm affiliated with the Mafia?

715
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,635
I'm a businessman, Lieutenant.

716
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:43,762
Of course.

717
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,965
I'll find your spies,

718
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,018
but you got to
do me a favor first.

719
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,988
Mr. Luciano, State Department
has agreed to arrange

720
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,321
for your release from prison.

721
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,078
24 years left on my sentence,

722
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,037
14 before I'm even eligible
for parole.

723
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,044
Meyer.

724
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,342
I know you would do the same
thing for me.

725
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,262
What can I do to help?

726
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,643
They need you to set up
a meeting with Joe Socks.

727
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:36,973
Joe Socks?

728
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:40,436
Joe Lanza, local 16975.

729
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,987
United Seafood Workers Union.

730
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,157
I'll arrange for your boys
to get their union cards

731
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,905
and you can begin
your operation.

732
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,113
I was the connection between
the US and the waterfront.

733
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,665
There were German spies
working amongst us.

734
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,413
I extracted whatever
intelligence I could from them

735
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,165
on behalf of the Feds.

736
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,293
The fate of the country
depended on us,

737
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,794
and they're looking
to lock me up?

738
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,425
God bless America.

739
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,546
<i>I had my men on the docks</i>

740
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,845
<i>hunting Germans
up and down the shore.</i>

741
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:18,181
<i>We'd root them out
and have ourselves</i>

742
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,937
<i>a friendly conversation</i>

743
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,517
<i>in the language them cocksuckers</i>

744
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,898
<i>understood only too well.</i>

745
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,108
You got an address?

746
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,361
224 Main Street.

747
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:41,704
- Freeze, don't move.
- Get on the ground!

748
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:42,797
- Now!
- Don't move,

749
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:43,883
you're under arrest.

750
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,499
<i>We busted up a whole.</i>

751
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,127
<i>German intelligence network.</i>

752
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,929
<i>Blew the cover
on a group of spies</i>

753
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,758
<i>moving artillery, bombs,
and cash.</i>

754
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:56,349
<i>They were planning an enormous
attack on American soil,</i>

755
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,813
<i>but we stopped them.</i>

756
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,220
So, why would you defend
a country

757
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,647
whose government is devoted
to putting you behind bars?

758
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,025
I'm an American and a Jew.

759
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:09,862
The Germans wanted to destroy
both of those things.

760
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,614
So I wanted to destroy
the Germans.

761
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,366
- And I did.
- Okay. But why?

762
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,243
Why was it never
in the... in the press?

763
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,534
They could never own up to
the fact that somebody like me

764
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,336
could be capable of doing
any good in this world.

765
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:26,048
See, I believe this world
is made of shades of Gray.

766
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:28,092
It's never black or white.

767
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,012
So, you never felt compelled to
just set the record straight

768
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,759
and say, Meyer Lansky, patriot?

769
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,224
I think you found the title
of your book.

770
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:37,598
I'm asking you the question.

771
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,100
I never felt the need back then.

772
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,272
Why?

773
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,522
It was currency between me
and the United States.

774
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,900
I assumed that if I did favors
for the government,

775
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,697
they would always honor
my loyalty.

776
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:50,945
Right. And did they?

777
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,276
We haven't gotten to that part
of the story yet, David.

778
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:56,159
- Okay.
- United States?

779
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,119
They're not
who you think they are, David.

780
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,578
Mm. You're the wandering Jew
just like Lucky said, right?

781
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,878
That's me, the outsider

782
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,879
invited in from the cold
to warm my feet by the tire,

783
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,294
and then sent on my way again.

784
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,470
Yeah.

785
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,016
You know how that feels,
don't you?

786
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,389
Wait. What?

787
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,266
To be an outsider.

788
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,597
Your father didn't die, David,

789
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,398
he walked out on you
and your family

790
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:27,523
and you felt like an outsider
ever since in this world.

791
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,406
Yeah.

792
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,245
Look at us here.

793
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,951
Couple of outsiders sitting here
in a diner.

794
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,623
- Don't fucking lie to me.
- I swear on my life...

795
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,195
- That's bullshit.
- No.

796
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,049
Maureen, I am gonna ask you
one more fucking time,

797
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,472
- who fucking snitched?
- I don't fucking know.

798
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,215
I swear on my fucking life,
I have no idea.

799
00:48:58,227 --> 00:48:59,383
- That's bullshit.
- You okay?

800
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:00,551
- Who the fuck is this?
- We're just talking.

801
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:01,718
- What's the problem?
- Don't fucking lie.

802
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,886
- ...life, I have no idea.
- You're shaking.

803
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,730
- I'm not shaking.
- Hey. Take a hike, pal.

804
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,854
Everybody got a John fucking
Wayne here, huh?

805
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,605
Let me ask you a question, John.

806
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,188
- Are you fucking her?
- Jesus, Ray.

807
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,648
I don't think it's any
of your business, buddy.

808
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,492
I'll tell you
why it's my fucking business,

809
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,661
'cause she's got
a big fucking mouth.

810
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,613
- Fuck you.
- And if I can't trust her,

811
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,406
I can't trust any of her
fuck buddies either.

812
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,908
Don't disrespect her, okay?

813
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,114
You put your fucking
bag down, pal.

814
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,001
Ray, please don't do this.

815
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,297
Yeah, put your fucking bag...

816
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:32,754
God dammit.

817
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,923
You're a fucking asshole, Ray.

818
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,255
It's your fucking warning.
Keep your mouth shut.

819
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,845
He was busted for selling drugs.

820
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,063
Someone set him up.

821
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,228
I told a girlfriend of mine
I was in Miami

822
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:53,813
and she told him where I was.

823
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:58,986
So he showed up wanting to know
if I know who set him up.

824
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,321
Do you?

825
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,666
No.

826
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:08,453
I promise.

827
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,548
We all make mistakes.

828
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,133
Ray was one of mine.

829
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,976
Life is just full of
shades of Gray.

830
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,328
Okay.

831
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,911
All right.

832
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,705
She likes it rough, huh?

833
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,671
Who did that to you?

834
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:53,839
It's nothing.

835
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:55,207
Either you're gonna tell me
who did this

836
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,459
or I'm going to find out.

837
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,254
All right, well,

838
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,390
okay, you know
the woman that I've been...

839
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,635
Fucking?
I think that's the word for it.

840
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:11,023
Yeah, okay, um, well, I had to
break up a fight between her

841
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,727
and her ex.

842
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:14,936
I see.

843
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:19,692
Well, I wish you luck with all
your future sparring endeavors.

844
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,867
- Thank you, thanks.
- My pleasure.

845
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,820
Next time, hit him first.

846
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,575
Always hit him first.

847
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:30,626
Mr. Lansky,
you chose the losing side.

848
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:32,912
I'm a businessman.

849
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:37,045
We don't choose sides.

850
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,551
We choose opportunities.

851
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,096
Which is why I think
we can make a deal.

852
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,015
<i>Salvatore Maranzano,</i>

853
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,969
<i>boss of all bosses of
organized crime in New York.</i>

854
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,892
<i>Bootlegging, racketeering,
narcotics.</i>

855
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,815
<i>He called himself Little Caesar.</i>

856
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,273
I want to invest
in your copper joints.

857
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:03,489
See, the thing is, I built
my business from the ground up

858
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:08,372
and I prefer to keep it under
the same roof.

859
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:15,129
And frankly, Mr. Maranzano,
I don't need your money.

860
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:22,470
Yeah, I don't give a shit.
How's that? Look.

861
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,048
What if I offer you
an opportunity

862
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,054
to take Luciano's seat
in the council?

863
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,970
How would you propose
doing that?

864
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,186
You take Luciano out
and the seat's yours.

865
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,476
He'll never see it coming
from you.

866
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,609
You walk out now

867
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,402
or we pinch you and take you
down with the rest of 'em.

868
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:52,917
I have known Luciano
for a long time,

869
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:55,958
since we were children.

870
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,292
He's much more than an associate
to me.

871
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,626
I respect that.

872
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,888
But there can only be one boss,
and that's me.

873
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:07,928
It's about business.

874
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,734
I think you should make
the right decision here

875
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,511
and do the right thing.

876
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,809
We got a search warrant.

877
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,148
Hey, nobody move.

878
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:17,475
Nobody move! Hey!

879
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,684
What's all the commotion?

880
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,110
Go check it out, Marco.

881
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,700
Woah, woah, woah, calm down.
Put down your guns.

882
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,903
My boss is inside,
you go talk to him.

883
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,821
He knows your Captain.
It's going to be okay.

884
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,040
Everything's all right. Hey.

885
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:39,585
What took you so long?

886
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:40,790
Lot of stairs.

887
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:44,047
Double-crossing prick.

888
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:45,969
Make him feel it, Benny.

889
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,421
No. No.

890
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:48,597
- Come here.
- No.

891
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:54,224
Look at me, look at me
when you fucking die,

892
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,351
you double-crossing
sack of shit.

893
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,277
Oh, that's it.

894
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:04,574
Here you go.

895
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,783
They're gonna come after us now.

896
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,335
All of them,
with everything they got.

897
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,163
We'll already be in control by then.

898
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,549
I'm grateful for your loyalty, Meyer.

899
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,801
I want a seat at the council,
Charlie.

900
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,722
It's a new era,

901
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,720
what matters is
how I run my business,

902
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,427
not the fact that I'm a Jew.

903
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,886
You know, if it were up to me...

904
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,392
We'll be your executors.

905
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,773
You seen the numbers
we're doing in Saratoga.

906
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,606
No one runs an operation
like I do.

907
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:47,406
I got the best carpet joints,
Upstate, Jersey, Florida.

908
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,575
No, you don't gotta justify it
to me, Meyer.

909
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,868
Plus, I got the muscle to back
all of 'em.

910
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,289
And the revenue,
the revenue speaks for itself.

911
00:54:56,251 --> 00:55:01,621
I run it like a business.
Like Ford Motors, Coca-Cola.

912
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,915
You know, like US Steel.

913
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,129
I'll tell you what,

914
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,137
I'll do what I can
to convince the council

915
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:15,593
that you deserve a spot.

916
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:16,722
Hmm.

917
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,851
What about Benny?

918
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:20,942
Benny.

919
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,477
Benny's handling California
for us.

920
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,198
Why are you still awake?

921
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,870
How the hell
am I supposed to sleep?

922
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,119
Do you know what time it is?

923
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,209
Yeah, says the man who comes
and goes at all hours.

924
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:40,876
Mind your business.

925
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:42,713
Was out working.

926
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,379
Work.

927
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,082
It's always work with you.

928
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,056
Take a look around you.

929
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,219
All this shit.

930
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,217
Where do you think
it comes from, huh?

931
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,096
Maybe try showing
a little gratitude for once.

932
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,101
Gratitude?

933
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,267
The hell with gratitude,
you're a criminal.

934
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,620
What happened to you?

935
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,331
You're pathetic.

936
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,169
You think the neighbors
don't talk to you because of me?

937
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,544
I see in your eyes
what you do at night.

938
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:31,636
Who do you think you are
coming into our home

939
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:33,971
pretending to be a good man,
huh?

940
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,092
A father?

941
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,679
You think you're helping him!

942
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:40,724
Shut your mouth!

943
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,476
It's your fault.

944
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,734
It's your fault he's a cripple.

945
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,312
It's because of you,
it's all because of you!

946
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,284
It's called "judgement."

947
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,154
It's punishment
for what you've done

948
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,535
and how you live your life,
Meyer.

949
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:09,457
God is watching.

950
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,964
He's watching,
he's watching you, I know he is.

951
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:26,815
You believe that?

952
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:29,356
Believe what?

953
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,781
We get judged and punished
for the way we live our lives.

954
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:37,781
The choices we make,
that's what defines us.

955
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:40,871
I don't question
the choices I make.

956
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,039
Never?

957
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,241
I get the feeling sometimes
you don't question

958
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:45,952
the choices you make either.

959
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:48,666
Okay, let's talk
about those choices.

960
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,670
Tell me about Murder, Inc.

961
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,343
After Maranzano,

962
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,801
we needed the muscle
to consolidate our power.

963
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,591
I had the right people to do it.

964
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:03,723
Bingo.

965
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,013
<i>A group of nice Jewish</i>

966
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,390
<i>and Italian boys,</i>

967
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:10,350
<i>you know, the kind a girl
wants to bring home</i>

968
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,362
<i>to her mother.</i>

969
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,859
<i>Always willing to lend a hand.</i>

970
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,187
<i>"Murder, Inc."</i>

971
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,943
<i>That's what they called them.</i>

972
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,454
<i>There was Abe "Kid Twist" Reles,</i>

973
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,157
<i>"Tick-Tack" Tannenbaum,</i>

974
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:28,502
<i>Louis “Lepke” Buchalter,
an army of enforcers,</i>

975
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,706
<i>hired assassins,
a thousand hits between 'em,</i>

976
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,586
<i>they put contract killers
on payroll.</i>

977
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,544
<i>There were no rules
on how to kill.</i>

978
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,879
<i>As long as you got it done,
you got paid.</i>

979
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:44,635
<i>Most were shot, stabbed,
strangled, drowned, burned,</i>

980
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,062
<i>buried alive,
left to bleed dry,</i>

981
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,390
<i>all of 'em unrepentant,</i>

982
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,815
<i>cold-blooded killers.</i>

983
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,527
<i>And Lansky was their general.</i>

984
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:57,486
<i>Through sheer determination
and fearlessness,</i>

985
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,487
<i>Lansky finally got
what he wanted,</i>

986
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,661
<i>a seat at the table
sitting right beside guys like.</i>

987
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:07,458
<i>Joe Bonnano, Frank Costello,
Al Capone, Italian...</i>

988
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,700
- Meyer.
- To Meyer.

989
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:09,909
<i>...Jewish and Irish mob bosses</i>

990
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,252
<i>from across America.</i>

991
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,880
<i>Together, they formed
the largest organization</i>

992
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,674
<i>of crime the world
has ever known,</i>

993
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:18,135
<i>the National Crime Syndicate.</i>

994
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,816
I don't understand.

995
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,392
When they were
investigating Lansky,

996
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,270
no one bothered to look
at the old files?

997
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:39,865
Hey, we're talking 40 years
of transcripts, depositions,

998
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,487
surveillance reports.

999
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,698
That's a lot of material.

1000
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:45,780
Frank, look at this.

1001
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:48,328
It says he's still alive.

1002
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:56,040
Mr. Sims, I'm Special Agent
Frank Rivers with the FBI.

1003
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,217
I'd like to talk to you
about your association

1004
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,468
with Meyer Lansky.

1005
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:04,969
Never heard of him.

1006
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,769
I can make your life in here
a whole lot easier, you know.

1007
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,311
I'm gonna die in here.

1008
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:12,264
The hell are you gonna do
for me?

1009
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,099
Get me fresh soup?

1010
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:17,061
Well, Lansky sent you on a job
and you got caught

1011
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,355
and right now he's, uh...

1012
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,111
he's having
a pretty comfortable life,

1013
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,533
and you're stuck in here.

1014
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,486
You gonna pop him for me,
are you?

1015
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,786
I can put him away.

1016
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,864
Make it so his life's
not a whole lot different

1017
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:29,959
from yours.

1018
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,910
I'm looking for his money.

1019
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,962
He started stashing it away
back in the Murder, Inc. Days.

1020
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,756
So who was keeping the books
back then?

1021
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:40,334
- No money.
- What do you mean, "no money"?

1022
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,294
There's no money in murder.

1023
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:48,135
It wasn't a sustainable
business, not like a casino.

1024
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:50,640
There was money. Maybe he just
didn't tell you about it.

1025
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,808
He was stuffing the walls
with it.

1026
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,194
Then go ask the walls.

1027
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:01,568
You listen to me,
you piece of shit.

1028
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,863
The only reason you're in here
is because of that asshole.

1029
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:09,034
Well, now you can suffer
the rest of your time in here

1030
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:10,285
because of him, too.

1031
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,210
Geneva.

1032
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:15,713
Geneva?

1033
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,128
He had a money manager
in Geneva.

1034
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,097
What are you doing with that?

1035
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,910
What are you doing with it?

1036
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,542
FBI.

1037
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,248
Just tell...
Just tell me, tell me.

1038
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:02,549
Tell me, it's okay.

1039
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:03,751
What... what is it?

1040
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,753
Ray turned state's evidence,

1041
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:08,639
he made a deal with the Feds,
they reduced his sentence.

1042
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,423
And he named me
as one of his partners

1043
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:11,516
in his drug operation.

1044
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,344
So the Feds came to me
and they said that

1045
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,554
I would go to prison
if I didn't cooperate.

1046
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:16,649
Okay.

1047
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,474
So...

1048
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,396
So, how?

1049
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:21,768
To "cooperate,"
that's the word that they used?

1050
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,020
Get close to you.

1051
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:28,405
Okay, and then?

1052
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:31,411
Feed them information
from your files.

1053
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,495
Listen, David,

1054
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,707
everything that's been
happening between us is real.

1055
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,047
- You have to trust me.
- Trust you, trust you?

1056
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:45,341
- I know that sounds ridiculous.
- I have a family.

1057
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,604
What did... did you...

1058
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,853
- What'd you give 'em?
- Everything I could remember.

1059
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:05,567
The name of associates
and accomplices.

1060
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,564
They wanted me to write
everything down

1061
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,216
and give it to them
and that's what I did.

1062
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:12,031
Okay, what else did they want?

1063
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,738
What else they want
apart from names?

1064
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,572
They said you might have
information on money

1065
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,120
that Lansky laundered years ago.

1066
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,497
Money.

1067
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,132
Oh.

1068
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,796
<i>What are you doing with that?</i>

1069
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,579
<i>What are you doing with it?</i>

1070
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,661
<i>FBI.</i>

1071
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,748
<i>I'll tell you everything.</i>

1072
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,076
Okay, here we are again.

1073
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,224
- Morning.
- Can I help you?

1074
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,640
Special Agent Frank Rivers,
with the FBI.

1075
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,317
We're looking for a guest
of the hotel, Miss Duffy.

1076
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:51,361
She's in room 1-4-6.

1077
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:52,813
Miss Duffy's not here.

1078
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,073
Well, I'd like to look
in her room if I could.

1079
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,321
Suit yourself.

1080
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,131
But you're not going to find
anything there.

1081
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,737
- Room's empty.
- Empty?

1082
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,644
Miss Duffy checked out
late last night.

1083
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,457
How did you evade the Feds?

1084
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:10,668
Like how did you
and your business associates

1085
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,250
become so successful under
the scrutiny of the government?

1086
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:16,048
- Why are you whispering?
- Hmm?

1087
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:17,720
I can hardly hear you.

1088
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,933
How did you and
your associates...

1089
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,261
like, got very... very successful

1090
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:25,720
under the scrutiny
of the government.

1091
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:26,732
How did you do that?

1092
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,482
The way any legitimate
company does.

1093
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:33,483
We were making more money
than some Fortune 500 companies.

1094
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:36,691
We got assets to manage
and we had the best talent

1095
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,149
to manage them.

1096
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,405
You okay, David?

1097
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,954
You seem a little white
around the gills this morning.

1098
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:43,822
It was one of those nights.

1099
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,875
Not another one.

1100
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:50,587
Okay, so um, how'd you go about
doing all of that,

1101
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,539
changing your
business practices?

1102
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,594
'Cause I think that's what
everyone wants to know.

1103
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:57,674
I taught my associates that
there are benefits,

1104
01:06:57,764 --> 01:07:02,258
cost benefits of keeping a guy
that owes you money alive.

1105
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:05,640
Instead of goons, I said,
we ought to send accountants.

1106
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:09,890
Additional sum for
the cash reserve and profit

1107
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:13,603
should be passed along
to be put in the credit column

1108
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:15,437
of the ledger.

1109
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,092
There's a reason
I dropped out of school

1110
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,489
when I was 12.

1111
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,658
That guy made more money

1112
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,318
for Luciano
than all your twits combined.

1113
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:23,491
Come on.

1114
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:24,662
Any questions?

1115
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,286
In the early days,
a man owed you money,

1116
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,709
you would send goons
to break his body apart,

1117
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:33,630
<i>and if he couldn't pay,
he'd find an unfortunate end.</i>

1118
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,458
Now, rather than kill the guy,
we audit him,

1119
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,085
<i>crunch the numbers,</i>

1120
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,591
<i>make sure his business
turns a profit.</i>

1121
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,640
Now, Joe Schmo belongs to us.

1122
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,725
We own him.

1123
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:56,437
Why don't we go for a walk,
David?

1124
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:58,238
You look like
you could use some air.

1125
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,069
Come.

1126
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:08,366
Optimizing our resources,
restructuring our operations.

1127
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,121
This was a new world
for our associates.

1128
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,998
I think it was Henry Ford
that said that,

1129
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,252
"Business that makes nothing
but money is a poor business."

1130
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,342
Gambling and casinos
are to entertainment,

1131
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,137
what Ford's auto mobile
was to transportation.

1132
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:25,511
For some, there's no such thrill
as the toss of the dice.

1133
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:26,967
We catered to that need.

1134
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,143
Okay, you wake up
in the morning,

1135
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,391
there's car in your driveway.

1136
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:32,313
You didn't make a product.

1137
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:37,110
Henry Ford's product
wasn't the car.

1138
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,897
It was the freedom
the car gave to people.

1139
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,444
Freedom is what people wanted.

1140
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,827
Our product wasn't gambling
or the casinos.

1141
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,371
It was the world of excitement
and thrills.

1142
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,290
We built half the resorts
in this country,

1143
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:53,869
created thousands of jobs,
supported families.

1144
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:55,457
It was a product.

1145
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,671
That's why
it's all legalized now,

1146
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,519
why the government
has its finger in the pie.

1147
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,512
It was too valuable a product
to leave to criminals.

1148
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:16,308
- David, where's your car?
- It's over there.

1149
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,397
This fucker is following us.

1150
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:23,948
Can you fucking believe it?

1151
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,069
See if you could turn off
some place,

1152
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,572
make the first turnoff you can.

1153
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,127
- Here?
- Right over here.

1154
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,416
Son of a bitch.

1155
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,106
Right, so who is that?

1156
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:05,111
I thought maybe
you could tell me.

1157
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:08,735
I... I don't know.

1158
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:21,874
When you lose your money,
you lose nothing.

1159
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:24,756
When you lose your health,
you lose something.

1160
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:28,464
When you lose your character,
you lose everything.

1161
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:31,841
Remember that.

1162
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:15,014
Hey, woman in the room,
you seen her?

1163
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,104
She checked out.

1164
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,147
- She checked out?
- What's going on here?

1165
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:20,473
I don't want any trouble.

1166
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,810
I'm not giving you any trouble.

1167
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:26,818
The Do Not Disturb sign has been
on your door for a week.

1168
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,834
Okay, well, let's keep it
that way, all right?

1169
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:31,711
I'll pay you extra,
you let no one in my room.

1170
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:33,914
Fine.

1171
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:57,428
Let's talk about the shitstorm
of trouble you're in, Mr. Stone.

1172
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:58,853
Show him the pictures, Greg.

1173
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,061
This must have been fun, huh?

1174
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,232
Get a little taste of that.

1175
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,268
- Meyer Lansky has...
- You have fun taking these?

1176
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,812
- Did you have fun taking them?
- ...over 300 million dollars...

1177
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:09,146
Why are you show...
Why are showing me this?

1178
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,398
Listen to me. Lansky has

1179
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:13,201
over 300 million dollars
squirreled away somewhere.

1180
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,699
The government wants it and
we want your help finding it.

1181
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:18,699
I can't, I can't... I...

1182
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:21,160
And we could let it slip
to Mr. Lansky

1183
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:24,417
that you've been sharing his
secrets with an FBI informant.

1184
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,835
That's not gonna go well
for you.

1185
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:30,506
Look, we don't wanna go down
that road if we don't have to.

1186
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,467
We know you're just a writer
who was looking for a story

1187
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,038
who had the misfortune
to stumble into

1188
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:38,560
a decades-long investigation
into Lansky and Associates.

1189
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:42,727
So we're willing to offer you
a financial incentive.

1190
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,728
We'll make you a paid informant.

1191
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,727
We'll give you 150,000 dollars.

1192
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:49,770
Now that'll go along way
to take care of your family

1193
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:50,938
- and your money problems.
- I don't have any...

1194
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,612
- I don't need your money.
- David, we've been listening.

1195
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:56,536
You help us
or Lansky gets to you first.

1196
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:59,034
Now we can offer you
and your family protection

1197
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,125
and the money.

1198
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,375
The way I see it,
you don't have a choice.

1199
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:04,707
I'm gonna give you
my number here.

1200
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:07,664
You call us from a payphone
when you got something.

1201
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:11,459
Do the right thing here, David.

1202
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:34,320
You heard the joke about
this rabbi who got hit by a car,

1203
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,822
falls down,
the emergency ambulance comes,

1204
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:40,076
rabbi's laying on the floor,
the emergency worker runs over,

1205
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,749
says, "Rabbi, Rabbi,
are you okay?"

1206
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:46,077
The rabbi looks up at him
and he says, "I make a living."

1207
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,631
Okay, go ahead.

1208
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:52,049
A little levity here, you know.

1209
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,420
Money. Must have been pouring in
by now, right?

1210
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,266
That's right.

1211
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,645
<i>The gaming business in Cuba</i>

1212
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:05,767
<i>is no good,</i>

1213
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,024
<i>it's a free-for-all,
no regulations.</i>

1214
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,856
These men are making millions.

1215
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:19,828
Gambling in Cuba will soon be
under our control again.

1216
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:23,365
And President Batista
wants you to oversee it,

1217
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,745
Mr. Lansky.

1218
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:26,166
All of it.

1219
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,583
I appreciate the opportunity.

1220
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:34,634
I've always felt Cuba
is a land of enterprise.

1221
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,421
In America,
you might be an outlaw,

1222
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,099
but in Cuba
you are on the inside.

1223
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:52,935
You were making what,
10 million?

1224
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:57,070
Turned to 20,
and then 30 million.

1225
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,820
I was the biggest
casino operator

1226
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,777
this country had ever seen.

1227
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:03,329
You were legitimate, yeah?
You were above board.

1228
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:06,124
You had your license,
machines weren't rigged.

1229
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,325
Never.

1230
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,707
But they still consider you
part of the underworld.

1231
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,040
We weren't the underworld.

1232
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:16,843
We were the overworld.

1233
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:28,179
Go back to sleep.

1234
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,978
<i>When Batista gave Lansky</i>

1235
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,822
<i>control over Cuba's casinos,</i>

1236
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:40,400
<i>Lansky turned the country into
an international playground</i>

1237
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,360
<i>for gamblers
and pleasure-seekers.</i>

1238
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,287
<i>Criminal empire outside the US,</i>

1239
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,206
<i>it couldn't be touched
by law enforcement.</i>

1240
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,709
<i>The National Crime Syndicate
now owned</i>

1241
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,127
<i>the biggest gambling
corporation in the world.</i>

1242
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,376
<i>And Lansky was the CEO.</i>

1243
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,971
How you doin', huh?

1244
01:16:04,852 --> 01:16:05,933
How was the trip?

1245
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:07,687
Fine.

1246
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:12,022
How you doin', beautiful?

1247
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,270
Huh?

1248
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,441
Come on, let's go.

1249
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,519
You wanna go to the room?

1250
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:17,695
Come on.

1251
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,189
You put the nickel in.

1252
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,645
Just try.

1253
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,067
Right here?

1254
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:00,317
Pull that lever, hard.

1255
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:07,113
Slate-of-the-art slot and blend.
Silent bells, double jackpots,

1256
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:10,703
and we'll have the guys rig 'em
so they better our odds.

1257
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,409
Didn't Ben talk to you
about that?

1258
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:13,618
About what?

1259
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:17,288
I don't want
the machines rigged.

1260
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,045
Every casino in this town
rigs their machines.

1261
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:22,794
I'm not every casino.

1262
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:25,390
Yes, sir.

1263
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:30,343
Come on, go again.

1264
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:39,776
I'll be right back, Buddy.

1265
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:41,734
Keep at it.

1266
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:43,406
You, watch the kid.

1267
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,461
Mr. Yariv, sir.

1268
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,297
Mr. Lansky,
thank you for seeing me.

1269
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:05,469
Welcome to the Colonial,
Mr. Yariv.

1270
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:07,922
Please.

1271
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:09,762
Thank you.

1272
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:11,934
How can I help you?

1273
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:15,980
Mr. Lansky, I'm here on behalf
of Golda Meir.

1274
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:19,100
As you know, our people
have been slaughtered in Germany

1275
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:20,310
and across Europe.

1276
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:22,941
The Jewish settlement in
Palestine has been hard at work.

1277
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:24,898
- You need money?
- Yes.

1278
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:26,778
To purchase weapons.

1279
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,503
We are fighting for
the future state of Israel

1280
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,242
and for the survival of
the Jewish people, Mr. Lansky.

1281
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:35,667
Fighting, as in killing.

1282
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:47,091
We will do whatever it takes,
Mr. Lansky.

1283
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:52,258
You tell Miss Meir

1284
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,470
that she has
Meyer Lansky's support.

1285
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:59,231
I'd be happy to contribute
in any way.

1286
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:03,069
And I'm sure my colleagues here
share my feelings

1287
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,190
for the state of Israel.

1288
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:08,032
Moe, how much do you have
on you?

1289
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,492
It's the weekend take.

1290
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,328
Give it to him.

1291
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,501
Mr. Yariv here
is taking donations

1292
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,385
for the state of Israel.

1293
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:29,587
I am Italian.

1294
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:54,783
I'll make arrangements for more.

1295
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,207
On behalf of Golda Meir
and the Israeli people,

1296
01:19:58,294 --> 01:19:59,500
we are grateful.

1297
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,752
And we will not soon forget.

1298
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:15,008
If you need any weapons
or ammunition,

1299
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:16,554
you let me know.

1300
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:18,807
We hope you enjoy your stay
with us.

1301
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,854
Oh, I'm not staying
at the Colonial.

1302
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,650
Next time, I hope.

1303
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:42,501
We're hearing things, Meyer,
about Benny.

1304
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,545
What kind of things?

1305
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,800
That he's out of control,
kicking heads in,

1306
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:50,217
dating movie stars.

1307
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:52,757
He's lost his focus, Meyer.

1308
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,261
We gave him California,
we gave him Vegas,

1309
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:58,309
all's we get in return is grief.

1310
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:00,474
I'll talk to him.

1311
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:03,060
Envelopes are coming back
light, too.

1312
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:07,436
Listen, Lucky ain't happy, Meyer.

1313
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:12,406
Okay? You know, it ain't easy
for us coming to you like this.

1314
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,659
, Ben.

1315
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:20,119
I said... I'll talk to him.

1316
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:36,714
So, what are you gonna
do with your winnings, huh?

1317
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:41,227
Buy Mom a new fur coat,
just like you always do.

1318
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,469
Your mother...
Your mother, she's got

1319
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:43,892
plenty of fur coats.

1320
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:46,933
I'm gonna be just like you.

1321
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,611
I'm gonna get my wife
fur coats, too.

1322
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:58,035
Well, you can be whatever
you wanna be.

1323
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,573
You don't wanna be like me.

1324
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:12,337
Why?

1325
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:17,801
You just don't.

1326
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,402
I love you, you know that,
right?

1327
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:34,813
I love you, too.

1328
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:52,082
I never wanted my children
to follow in my footsteps.

1329
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:54,712
You know, I think about it
all the time.

1330
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:03,010
Do my kids see me as a...
man who tries his best

1331
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:04,810
or... or as a failure?

1332
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:07,267
It's complicated.

1333
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:11,066
Marriage, children,
you did your best.

1334
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:14,728
I trust you, David.

1335
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,822
You're gonna write
a hell of a book.

1336
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:27,951
Vegas. Flamingo.

1337
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:32,629
<i>We built that town, a paradise,</i>

1338
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:36,380
<i>but for us it turned out to be
our worst nightmare.</i>

1339
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:56,854
- Yeah.
- Benny.

1340
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,531
<i>Meyer, that you?</i>

1341
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,242
What time is it?

1342
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:04,366
It's a quarter after two there.

1343
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:06,196
Look, why don't you
hop on a flight

1344
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:07,208
and head out here?

1345
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:10,125
Oh, hey pal, listen,
I'd love to,

1346
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:11,993
but you know, Ginny's
got friends in town, right?

1347
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:14,497
So, probably not for me.

1348
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:19,961
Hey, I gotta tell you,
the women in this town, man.

1349
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:22,588
Meyer, you'd go crazy.

1350
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,011
I'm happy things are good
for you, Ben,

1351
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:27,469
but unfortunately,
we have to talk about something

1352
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:28,928
<i>not so pleasant.</i>

1353
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,395
Well, what is it?

1354
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:31,813
It's our investors.

1355
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:35,016
- They're not happy.
- What do you mean?

1356
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:36,439
Is there...
Did they tell you that?

1357
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:37,727
<i>Can you blame them?</i>

1358
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:42,279
The... materials are overpriced,
the construction is delayed.

1359
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:43,650
<i>Do you know how many people</i>

1360
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:44,823
<i>are undertaking this town?</i>

1361
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,029
I can't screw in a light bulb
without a city official

1362
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:48,910
and his goddamn maid
coming for a handout.

1363
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,740
- That's the deal.
<i>- The accounting is sloppy,</i>

1364
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:53,084
Ben, and sloppy accounting
leads to concern.

1365
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:54,878
Do me a favor.
Remind them that we own

1366
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:56,376
66 percent of this casino,

1367
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,878
which means we get to decide
who gets to be concerned.

1368
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:01,085
66 percent of nothing
is nothing.

1369
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,638
We have to put money back in
to cover the cash flow problem.

1370
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:10,060
Were you planning on talking
to me about this?

1371
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:11,856
Of course.

1372
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:14,091
Of course, I mean,
what'd you think.

1373
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,100
I wasn't gonna have that
conversation with you?

1374
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,943
How much are we talking about,
Ben?

1375
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:21,981
Half a million.

1376
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:25,610
Maybe another three
just to get us

1377
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:27,736
through a few months.

1378
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:32,454
I'll turn it around, Meyer.

1379
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,585
I know you will, Ben.

1380
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,418
That's what I told Lucky.

1381
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:44,044
I'm not gonna let you down,
I swear.

1382
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:47,514
I know, Ben.

1383
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,644
You're listening in on my calls?

1384
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:58,934
He's a bum.

1385
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:03,606
He's a burn and you know it.

1386
01:26:04,201 --> 01:26:05,817
It's not your concern, Anne.

1387
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,867
He's gonna get you killed.

1388
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,029
They'll kill you both.

1389
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:12,118
Bang, bang.

1390
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:15,163
Goodbye, Meyer Lansky.

1391
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,878
May he rest in peace.

1392
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:20,424
Father.

1393
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,460
Husband.

1394
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:25,715
Murderer.

1395
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:28,844
- Stay out of this.
- How about I jump, huh?

1396
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:30,015
Right off this balcony...

1397
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,257
- Don't be ridiculous.
- ...and save you

1398
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:32,269
all that trouble.

1399
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:34,099
Come on.

1400
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,520
Would make your day.

1401
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:39,854
Don't pretend like you care
for my well-being.

1402
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:44,731
All you care for is your money.

1403
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:48,359
It's your money, money,
money, money, money.

1404
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:49,534
- Your money.
- Enough!

1405
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:51,578
No!

1406
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:54,665
You murderer, you're a murderer!

1407
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,367
Get off! Liar!

1408
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:03,465
Get off me!

1409
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:04,758
No!

1410
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:06,760
Hey, call an ambulance.

1411
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,554
- No, Meyer!
- It's my wife.

1412
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,256
- No, Meyer.
- She's hysterical.

1413
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:11,431
No!

1414
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:12,757
- Meyer!
- There's something wrong...

1415
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:13,769
in her head.

1416
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,061
Just get a doctor here now!

1417
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,019
Well, goddamn.

1418
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:09,949
Meyer, oy.

1419
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:11,994
Look at this place.

1420
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:15,412
Nice, hmm.

1421
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:16,660
Are you kidding me?

1422
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,616
You're the king
of the goddamn domain.

1423
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:19,870
I'll tell you something, too.

1424
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:22,995
You breathe a little different
down here.

1425
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:27,508
- How's your flight?
- Ah, forget about that.

1426
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:30,214
Real question is, what do
we got lined up for tonight?

1427
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:32,217
Hmm.

1428
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:34,431
- Oh, boy.
- Come on.

1429
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:40,884
<i>Things have changed, Ben.</i>

1430
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:41,899
Look around you.

1431
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:46,561
There's too much money at stake
to be fucking around.

1432
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:49,654
We're not kids anymore.

1433
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:50,947
Yeah.

1434
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,029
You're right.

1435
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,036
I can't keep defending you.

1436
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:00,077
Especially if you don't show
any results.

1437
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,950
Is that what you're doin'?

1438
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,210
You're defending me?

1439
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:05,378
The Meyer I used to know,

1440
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:06,955
he would've stood up
for his pal.

1441
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:16,055
You know...

1442
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:19,559
there was never
an option for me.

1443
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:22,597
What was I gonna be,
a tailor's son,

1444
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:23,977
make eight bucks a week?

1445
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,518
But you could have
done anything.

1446
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,031
And I looked up to you
my whole life for that.

1447
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,661
But following you...

1448
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:48,914
I don't know, Meyer.

1449
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,124
I don't know
if it was worth my soul.

1450
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:56,756
'Cause I don't know
how to get that back.

1451
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:23,037
I'm aware that I was called here
today to bear witness

1452
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:29,881
to your decision
to kill my friend, Ben Siegel.

1453
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:33,379
Benny saved my life
on more than one occasion.

1454
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:40,432
I cannot sit here and
watch you condemn him to death.

1455
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:43,844
But he's been Robbin' from us, Meyer.

1456
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:47,355
I'm aware of
Benny's shortcomings.

1457
01:30:48,735 --> 01:30:55,402
I'm also aware that many of us
would not be sitting here today

1458
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:58,738
if it weren't for
Benny's pas! Loyalty

1459
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:03,030
and his willingness
to stick out his neck.

1460
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:08,327
If it's about money,

1461
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:12,214
I've agreed to make amends
for his past mistakes.

1462
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:18,088
If it's about honor,
I ask you,

1463
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:23,263
where is the honor
in killing a friend?

1464
01:31:33,947 --> 01:31:35,688
Why don't you step outside, Meyer?

1465
01:31:58,054 --> 01:31:59,636
In the matter of Bugsy Siegel...

1466
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:02,764
Aye.

1467
01:32:03,393 --> 01:32:04,393
Aye.

1468
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:06,597
- Aye.
- Aye.

1469
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:08,595
Aye.

1470
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:09,690
Aye.

1471
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:14,776
Aye.

1472
01:32:59,032 --> 01:33:00,147
Hello?

1473
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:01,575
<i>Daddy?</i>

1474
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,401
- Eva?
<i>- Yes.</i>

1475
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:08,447
Eva, what are you...
What are you doing up?

1476
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:09,997
What time is it?

1477
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,667
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

1478
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,249
"I couldn't sleep."

1479
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:15,750
Honey, you gotta get to sleep.

1480
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,539
Got school tomorrow.

1481
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:19,750
<i>But tomorrow is Saturday.</i>

1482
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:22,586
Okay.

1483
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:24,929
Where's your mama?

1484
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:27,007
<i>She went out.</i>

1485
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:30,101
She went out, out where?

1486
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:32,228
<i>With some man.</i>

1487
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:38,360
You know, these things...

1488
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:42,401
It's... that's what's
gonna happen, you know?

1489
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:50,573
<i>Daddy, do you still love Mommy?</i>

1490
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:55,077
Honey, I love you.

1491
01:33:58,174 --> 01:33:59,585
I love you.

1492
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:03,043
Mrs. Lansky.

1493
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:05,800
Who is it?

1494
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:08,090
It's Frank Rivers,
ma'am, we spoke on the phone.

1495
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:10,892
Oh, yes.

1496
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:12,935
I remember.

1497
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:14,273
Sit down.

1498
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:16,018
Thank you.

1499
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:23,773
You know, there's no way in hell
you're going to find

1500
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:25,653
that bastard's money.

1501
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:27,617
Why is that?

1502
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:31,113
My ex-husband, Meyer,

1503
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,950
he never let a dime
out of his sight.

1504
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,503
If I were you,
I would look to Cuba.

1505
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:47,300
That is where Meyer made
his first real money.

1506
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:50,766
I thought he lost everything
when Castro took over.

1507
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:53,640
You think he would
give all that money

1508
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:55,437
to a communist?

1509
01:34:56,608 --> 01:35:00,727
That Batista,
he trusted no one, only Meyer.

1510
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,904
He gave Meyer what Meyer wanted.

1511
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:08,154
And what was that?

1512
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:12,616
To turn that country
into the Monte Carlo

1513
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:15,039
of the Caribbean. Hm.

1514
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:19,999
If only it had lasted.

1515
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:22,547
Pfft.

1516
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,755
Here's one of his diets.

1517
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:32,720
Matza, sardine, Jello,
and Irish stew.

1518
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,096
- Blegh.
- Ugh.

1519
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:37,889
Hey, there's a Lansky associate
in Geneva.

1520
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:39,897
That might be our guy.

1521
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:42,400
Let's get Stone to run it
by Lansky.

1522
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:45,316
I got it, of course.

1523
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:48,740
Hey David,
I got a message for you.

1524
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:50,947
From Mr. Lansky.

1525
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,011
What... what do you want?

1526
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:16,389
I'm beginning to think
you're not taking me seriously.

1527
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:18,436
Hey, he's not even here.
I've got nothing.

1528
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,733
Man, I think we're done.
I think the book is done.

1529
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:22,056
- Listen to me.
- I think...

1530
01:36:22,068 --> 01:36:23,748
We're looking for an associate
of Lansky's.

1531
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,485
He goes by the name "Pinchas."

1532
01:36:26,489 --> 01:36:27,900
He's 81, all right?

1533
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:29,823
His mind's not that sharp.

1534
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:32,025
I think that some of the stuff
he's been saying is...

1535
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,360
It's a little incoherent.

1536
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:35,946
Trust me,
he'll remember this name.

1537
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,077
Find out who he is, okay?

1538
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:40,692
You've got a pen,
I'll write it down.

1539
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:43,290
Pink-ass,
that you could remember.

1540
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:54,089
Hello, David.

1541
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:55,423
Come in, come in.

1542
01:36:57,562 --> 01:36:59,642
<i>I didn't
feel like going out today.</i>

1543
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:01,221
<i>You want coffee?</i>

1544
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:02,796
<i>No, thanks, I'm fine.</i>

1545
01:37:07,155 --> 01:37:08,236
Is that your father?

1546
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,496
When Israel turned me down,

1547
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:20,699
all I could think about was
how embarrassed

1548
01:37:20,793 --> 01:37:22,249
he would have been.

1549
01:37:24,047 --> 01:37:25,754
I was always ashamed of him.

1550
01:37:26,883 --> 01:37:28,669
In my mind, he was weak.

1551
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:31,797
Busted his balls
earning pennies.

1552
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:36,214
He felt the same about me, shame,

1553
01:37:36,893 --> 01:37:39,305
for having a gangster for a son.

1554
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:49,026
I didn't go to his funeral,
my own father.

1555
01:37:51,783 --> 01:37:53,990
I don't have the power
to change my past,

1556
01:37:54,077 --> 01:37:57,445
I do have the power to change
the perception of it.

1557
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:02,161
Do what I ask
and you will be rewarded.

1558
01:38:04,337 --> 01:38:05,793
You will do what I ask.

1559
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:07,667
<i>Let's sit on the porch.</i>

1560
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:09,757
They're in the back now.
Switch over to two.

1561
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,700
- What's going on?
- We lost him.

1562
01:38:18,184 --> 01:38:19,515
He knows we're listening to him.

1563
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:21,134
Goddammit.

1564
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,266
There's a name that came up
in my research,

1565
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:29,267
someone named "Pinchas."

1566
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:33,907
Huh?

1567
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:36,525
Someone named "Pinchas"?

1568
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:41,033
You mean Sal Rosenstein.

1569
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:43,364
Tough son of a bitch.

1570
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:46,160
His entire family died at Dachau.

1571
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:49,378
After the war,
he moved to Switzerland,

1572
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,247
did some banking for me.

1573
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:54,042
Pinchas was my nickname for him.

1574
01:38:59,725 --> 01:39:02,763
Wanted Pinchas's identity.
Get a pen.

1575
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:05,807
Sal Rosenstein.

1576
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:09,273
Yeah, yeah.

1577
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,641
Put the money
in my wife's account

1578
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:11,984
and make sure they're safe.

1579
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:13,812
And leave my family alone.

1580
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:25,998
We found him.

1581
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:28,911
Who, Rosenstein?

1582
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:30,166
Yeah, he was in Geneva.

1583
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:33,377
- Where is he now?
- He died 48 hours ago.

1584
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:51,732
Yeah, what?

1585
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:52,980
<i>It's Rivers.</i>

1586
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:55,311
<i>Sal Rosenstein
was killed in a car accident</i>

1587
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:57,818
<i>- 48 hours ago.</i>
- Say again?

1588
01:39:57,909 --> 01:39:59,732
<i>I'm saying
that Lansky had him killed.</i>

1589
01:39:59,744 --> 01:40:01,200
<i>This is not a coincidence.</i>

1590
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:03,403
<i>I would advise you
to stop talking to Lansky.</i>

1591
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:18,589
Mr. Rivers,
as soon as you called,

1592
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:20,716
we started running a query
into our database.

1593
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:23,347
It appears Mr. Rosenstein
moved his money

1594
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:25,892
primarily to one place, Israel.

1595
01:40:25,978 --> 01:40:27,639
Rosenstein was Mossad.

1596
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:30,180
<i>We've got a paper trail
of laundered money</i>

1597
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:33,812
going in and out of Geneva
into Israel to a bank

1598
01:40:33,903 --> 01:40:35,234
called "Mekif."

1599
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:36,982
And you think that money
was Lansky's?

1600
01:40:37,073 --> 01:40:39,189
I think it's why Lansky wanted
to get into Israel.

1601
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:40,283
His money's there.

1602
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:49,282
Mr. Rivers, welcome to Israel.

1603
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:50,663
We've been expecting you.

1604
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:53,495
I will be taking you down
to the vault.

1605
01:40:58,261 --> 01:40:59,843
Here it is.

1606
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:01,882
Thank you.

1607
01:41:19,407 --> 01:41:20,693
Son of a bitch.

1608
01:41:20,783 --> 01:41:22,148
And God said to Abraham,

1609
01:41:22,243 --> 01:41:27,158
"Abraham, take your son,
your only son whom you love,

1610
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:30,832
Isaac, and sacrifice him
upon one of the mountains

1611
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,204
that I will tell you."

1612
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:36,626
And Abraham went forth
with Isaac to do just that.

1613
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:40,417
But perhaps what God
really wanted was for Abraham

1614
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:42,422
to say no.

1615
01:41:43,431 --> 01:41:46,719
We praise God now for those
who have departed this world

1616
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:51,136
as we stand for the Kaddish,
let us all stand.

1617
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:11,952
Mr. Lansky, Mr. Lansky.

1618
01:42:12,043 --> 01:42:13,158
David.

1619
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:15,372
Prayer for the dead, right?

1620
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,624
Kaddish.
Is that for your father?

1621
01:42:17,715 --> 01:42:19,501
Or was it for Sal Rosenstein?

1622
01:42:19,925 --> 01:42:24,044
Remember Sal Rosenstein?
Your friend Pinchas? He's dead.

1623
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:26,341
Yeah, he died in a car accident.

1624
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:28,889
I'm sorry to hear that.

1625
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:30,307
Three days ago.

1626
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:35,813
Are you suggesting
I had something to do with it?

1627
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,390
I just think
it's a bit coincidental,

1628
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:38,682
we were just talking about him

1629
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:42,358
and then... something terrible
happens to him.

1630
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:45,572
Maybe he's dead

1631
01:42:46,243 --> 01:42:48,154
or maybe they just think
he's dead.

1632
01:42:48,871 --> 01:42:50,032
Just tell me the truth.

1633
01:42:50,122 --> 01:42:52,489
You mean like the truth of
you speaking to the Feds?

1634
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:58,248
You betrayed me, David,
you broke my heart,

1635
01:42:58,339 --> 01:43:00,751
you made a deal with me
and you broke your word.

1636
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:02,252
Yeah, I did talk to them.

1637
01:43:02,343 --> 01:43:04,004
I did, yeah.

1638
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:06,093
You know why I did it?

1639
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:09,047
You call it "self-preservation,"
I think.

1640
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:11,473
Right, I had to do
what I had to do for my family.

1641
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:13,509
I stand by it.

1642
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:16,975
I forgive you, David.

1643
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:20,350
If you wanna hear
the rest of the story...

1644
01:43:21,237 --> 01:43:22,237
Why'd you forgive me?

1645
01:43:23,364 --> 01:43:24,695
'Cause I like you.

1646
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:28,609
You liked Sal Rosenstein, too.

1647
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:30,576
Not really.

1648
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:36,615
<i>And now you come to Israel,</i>

1649
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:37,627
<i>for what reason?</i>

1650
01:43:38,546 --> 01:43:40,913
You want to become
an Israeli citizen, Mr. Lansky?

1651
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:42,337
I do.

1652
01:43:43,259 --> 01:43:47,298
My association with Israel
stands many years back.

1653
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:49,587
I was born a Jew.

1654
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:52,257
<i>I have all my life
lived as a Jew.</i>

1655
01:43:52,351 --> 01:43:55,969
<i>I never changed my faith.</i>

1656
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:57,971
<i>My grandparents are buried here.</i>

1657
01:43:58,566 --> 01:43:59,897
<i>Why are the American</i>

1658
01:43:59,984 --> 01:44:01,566
<i>authorities after you?</i>

1659
01:44:01,652 --> 01:44:03,484
<i>They claim I have 50 percent</i>

1660
01:44:03,571 --> 01:44:05,061
<i>of Lebanon casinos,</i>

1661
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:06,863
<i>50 percent of Monte Carlo.</i>

1662
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:08,269
<i>Mr. Lansky, is there</i>

1663
01:44:08,325 --> 01:44:10,362
<i>such a thing as organized crime?</i>

1664
01:44:11,454 --> 01:44:13,161
<i>I have no knowledge
on the subject</i>

1665
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:16,743
<i>and I'd like to live
the remainder of my days</i>

1666
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:18,290
<i>in Israel.</i>

1667
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:30,921
I got a tip from a friend,
Golda Meir is lobbying Nixon

1668
01:44:31,015 --> 01:44:33,757
to supply Israel
with F-4 fighter bombers.

1669
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:35,466
What's that got to do with me?

1670
01:44:35,561 --> 01:44:37,143
The prime minister was told

1671
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:38,936
that in order for that deal
to go through,

1672
01:44:39,023 --> 01:44:41,731
she'd have to see to that
you leave Israel

1673
01:44:41,817 --> 01:44:43,148
and return to the US.

1674
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:46,695
State Department
is revoking your passport.

1675
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:48,897
You need to surrender
at the embassy.

1676
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:53,030
The Law of Return says
every Jew has the right

1677
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:55,991
to citizenship in Israel.

1678
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,698
There's nothing I can do.

1679
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:00,457
I'm sorry.

1680
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:03,127
After everything I did
for this country,

1681
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:06,581
after all I gave them
when they begged me for money,

1682
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:09,667
for weapons.
Doesn't she remember?

1683
01:45:09,762 --> 01:45:13,096
This is how they repay me,
making me the only Jew

1684
01:45:13,182 --> 01:45:15,890
in history to be banned
from his country?

1685
01:45:16,435 --> 01:45:19,097
How dare she?

1686
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:23,313
They've already arranged
for your return to the US.

1687
01:45:23,818 --> 01:45:25,432
They're charging you
with contempt of court...

1688
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:27,276
- Oh, my God.
- ...and conspiracy related

1689
01:45:27,363 --> 01:45:29,855
to your ownership
at the Flamingo Hotel.

1690
01:45:29,949 --> 01:45:31,405
I won't go back there.

1691
01:45:31,492 --> 01:45:34,234
I want you to help me
find a place,

1692
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:35,693
a country that will take me.

1693
01:45:36,497 --> 01:45:38,238
I have money.
Name the price.

1694
01:45:39,291 --> 01:45:40,827
I don't want your money, Meyer.

1695
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:42,996
I believe your people
have betrayed you.

1696
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,546
I'll say.

1697
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:57,662
And after all that, they
were never able to indict you.

1698
01:45:59,395 --> 01:46:02,387
The charges against me,
contempt of court,

1699
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:05,731
conspiracy, they were dropped.

1700
01:46:09,154 --> 01:46:10,770
You couldn't go back to Israel?

1701
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:17,903
The wandering Jew,
just like Lucky said.

1702
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,666
Have we arrived at the end
of my story?

1703
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:41,308
What about the money?

1704
01:46:50,571 --> 01:46:51,777
Hm.

1705
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:54,529
Come for a ride.

1706
01:47:37,326 --> 01:47:38,532
Buddy.

1707
01:48:30,254 --> 01:48:31,415
Gangster?

1708
01:48:35,801 --> 01:48:40,511
I'm an angel with a dirty face.

1709
01:48:50,733 --> 01:48:53,100
I think we're finished, David.

1710
01:48:54,278 --> 01:48:55,643
Go home.

1711
01:48:58,824 --> 01:48:59,824
To your family.

1712
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:03,905
Remember me.

1713
01:49:51,919 --> 01:49:53,759
<i>When all is said and done,</i>

1714
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:57,500
<i>how do we measure ourselves?</i>

1715
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,797
<i>If Lansky taught me anything,
it's that</i>

1716
01:50:02,137 --> 01:50:03,627
<i>there's only one measure
in this world</i>

1717
01:50:03,722 --> 01:50:05,338
<i>that truly matters.</i>

1718
01:50:07,392 --> 01:50:08,832
<i>We measure ourselves
through the eyes</i>

1719
01:50:08,894 --> 01:50:10,350
<i>of the ones we love.</i>

1720
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:23,564
<i>Somewhere on
a stretch of highway</i>

1721
01:50:23,659 --> 01:50:26,117
<i>between Miami and home,
it all made sense.</i>

1722
01:50:26,537 --> 01:50:28,995
<i>Lansky spent his life
trying to control the game,</i>

1723
01:50:29,665 --> 01:50:32,202
<i>but in the end,
he knew there was one game</i>

1724
01:50:32,292 --> 01:50:35,535
<i>that no one gets to control,
life itself.</i>

1725
01:50:36,213 --> 01:50:37,999
<i>And you can try
to beat the odds.</i>

1726
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:40,339
<i>But the house always wins.</i>

1727
01:50:41,552 --> 01:50:42,992
<i>Maybe all you need
every now and then</i>

1728
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:44,422
<i>is a winning streak.</i>

1729
01:50:51,687 --> 01:50:52,687
You wanted to see me?

1730
01:50:53,272 --> 01:50:54,433
Yeah, come on in, Frank.

1731
01:51:01,113 --> 01:51:02,729
We're shutting
the investigation down.

1732
01:51:03,532 --> 01:51:04,818
Wait, what?

1733
01:51:05,409 --> 01:51:07,491
- Why?
- It's over, Frank.

1734
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:13,576
Who's killing it?
The CIA?

1735
01:51:22,176 --> 01:51:24,292
Before your time, sonny boy.

1735
01:51:25,305 --> 01:52:25,304
