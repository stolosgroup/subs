<i>Soobesükütsa tüa

3
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:39,748
<i>A long time ago, it is said,
a monster came here.</i>

4
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,282
A white tail.

5
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,458
Sarii.

6
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,586
<i>Mahoinitü</i>.

7
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:03,154
I remember when
Father told me I was ready for <i>kühtaamia</i>.

8
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,739
My big hunt.

9
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,744
You were little.
So, Mother took you to gather medicine.

10
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,082
But Father and I,
we went up into the hills.

11
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,335
The rain was bad. Everything was wet.

12
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,963
We crawled through the mud
and my bowstring…

13
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,381
…got ruined and...

14
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,680
You were sleeping.

15
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,725
I was waiting for it to circle back.

16
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,311
Now you're gonna have to
cross the river to get it.

17
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,229
Whoa.

18
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,023
Don't get your bowstring wet.

19
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:40,942
Ta a be,

20
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,486
this morning in the sky,

21
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,823
I saw a sign. The thunder bird.

22
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,993
I've been practicing.

23
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,829
It's time. I'm ready for my <i>kühtaamia</i>.

24
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,915
You really think you're ready?

25
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,753
You wanna hunt something
that's hunting you?

26
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,162
<i>Petsü.</i>

27
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,962
- Trained him well.
- It's easy. He's smart.

28
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,256
Not every smart creature is easy to train.

29
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,429
- Is that for War Chief's bad knee?
- Mmm.

30
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,348
He's getting worse.

31
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,976
You didn't put orange <i>totsiyaa</i>.

32
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,566
Who taught you about orange <i>totsiyaa</i>?

33
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,526
You.

34
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,278
Hmm.

35
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,165
Your father left you that
to cut bread root with.

36
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,961
I almost got a deer with it.

37
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,672
Yeah. Well, we can't eat "almost."

38
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,053
My girl, you are good
at so many other things.

39
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,222
Why do you want to hunt?

40
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,850
Because you all think that I can't.

41
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,690
Ah!

42
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,401
In this wind, he brings home a red-tail.

43
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,822
You should have listened to my story.

44
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,825
Didn't think we had time for a nap.

45
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,036
<i>Posa</i>.

46
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,040
It's sharp enough.

47
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,377
Go get us some orange <i>totsiyaa</i>.

48
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,212
It see.

49
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,174
- <i>Hina</i>?
- A lion. It took Puhi.

50
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,342
We gotta find him.

51
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,943
You could get shot sneaking up like that.

52
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,655
Who's sneaking?

53
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,990
Who invited you?

54
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,451
We won't be gone long enough
to need a cook.

55
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,330
She should stay.

56
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,748
She tracks well.

57
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,543
And if we find Puhi alive,
she knows medicine.

58
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,467
You have to find that cat now.

59
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,219
- I will.
- I know.

60
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,263
'Cause you have to.

61
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,207
Oh, good. The dog found shit.

62
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,418
- We're not looking for wolves.
- It's not wolf.

63
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,045
You see that crushed bone?

64
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,255
That's lion scat.

65
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,258
And the cat that made it was big.

66
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,417
He's breathing.

67
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,378
<i>Petsü</i>.

68
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,009
So much could kill him.

69
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,887
It won't kill him.
Just cool his blood.

70
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,358
<i>Anaa. Anaa</i>.

71
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,007
Ta a be wants to stay and hunt.

72
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,032
Let's go.

73
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,326
- I'm coming with you.
- I can handle the lion.

74
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,952
No, it's not just the lion.

75
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:39,916
Why is Puhi alive? There's something
that scared the cat away from its den.

76
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,584
I've got this.

77
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,253
Stay with Puhi. He needs your help too.

78
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,383
We don't have time to waste talking.
We need to get him home.

79
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,593
<i>ManamÜsohi</i>.

80
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,034
<i>Üts'tü nü</i>.

81
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,703
<i>Tobo'ihupitü</i>.

00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,165
<i>Kee</i>.

83
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,449
The cold is good.

84
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,127
The medicine slows his blood.
If he gets warm, he'll bleed out.

85
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,630
Hey.

86
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,007
Do you want him
to be comfortable or alive?

87
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,092
<i>Mia</i>.

88
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,494
We don't have time to wait for you.

89
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,955
- Look.
- Could be bear tracks.

90
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:44,874
Maybe.

91
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,251
But that's a big bear.

92
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,254
And why was it on its hind legs?
And what skins a snake like that?

93
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,922
- We need to keep moving.
- No.

94
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,424
I have to warn my brother.

95
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,344
Paaka, go with her.

96
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,285
Naru, we don't need the torches.
They'll scare the cat.

97
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,955
We're in its hunting grounds.

98
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,581
Why'd you come back?

99
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,751
I found tracks, and they were huge.

100
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,170
I'm not frightened by a bear.

101
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,089
I don't think it was a bear.

102
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,509
I don't know what it was.
I've never seen anything like it.

103
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,220
It skinned and gutted a snake.

104
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,598
Well, whatever it was,
we're in the cat's den now.

105
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,600
We have to deal with it first.

106
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,810
Come on.

107
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,736
The lion won't think
that we're hunting it here.

108
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,991
It'll think it's hunting us.

109
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,370
We get some bait,
then climb up and wait for it.

110
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:52,168
A hunter doesn't wait. He hunts.
We could be here all night.

111
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,379
We could stalk the forest all night
and not find anything too.

112
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,340
If you're too afraid to hunt,
go back to camp where you belong.

113
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,717
We'll try it Naru's way.

114
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,679
We'll bait it,
then I'll lead the cat to you.

115
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,098
Wait.

116
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,227
It's time, Naru.

117
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,606
Your <i>kühtaamia</i>.

118
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,527
When the lion comes, you tell that thing,

119
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,155
"This is as far as you go.

120
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,491
No more. This is it."

121
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,705
It won't matter how sharp it is
if you're too afraid to use it.

122
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,253
You think you're ready?

123
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,631
You've never faced a lion.

124
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,636
Its mouth full of teeth like arrows,

125
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,308
ready to tear your flesh
and crush your bones.

126
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:40,442
When your brother comes back,
he and I will find the lion

127
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,778
and kill it.

128
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,645
Your brother carried you home.

129
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,775
Wha... What about the lion?

130
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,027
- Ta a be went after it.
- Okay.

131
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,362
I have to find him.

132
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,822
No, you need to rest.

133
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,325
<i>Ihka</i>.

134
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,661
Drink this tea.

135
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:15,913
<i>Ihka</i>.

136
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:29,677
Puhi survived
because of your medicine.

137
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:35,474
There's something else out there.
Ta a be needs my help.

138
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:42,773
If your brother needed you,
he wouldn't have brought you back here.

139
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:50,781
You think the reason for <i>kühtaamia</i>
is to prove you can hunt,

140
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,784
but there's only one reason.

141
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,329
To survive.

142
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,711
<i>Ta a be kima! Ta a be kima!</i>

143
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,098
- Naru.
- War Chief.

144
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,289
Naru.

145
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,582
Where are you going?

146
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,709
We did it.

147
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,878
No.

148
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,005
We didn't do it.

149
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,176
What do you think left those tracks
and skinned that snake?

150
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,427
And before I fell,

151
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,304
- I saw lightning in the trees.
- Naru.

152
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,266
- There's something else out there.
- And if there is, I'll get it.

153
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,559
We need to go back out.

154
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,186
- Far, beyond the ridge line.
- No.

155
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,106
- Okay. Well, I'll hunt alone if I have to.
- You can't.

156
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,403
- Do I need your permission, War Chief?
- It's not about permission.

157
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,489
You can't.

158
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,784
I had to carry you back.

159
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:46,915
I can hunt.

160
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,584
You're right.

161
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,170
We didn't do it.

162
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,131
I did.

163
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,720
You tried it. You just…

164
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,890
You couldn't bring it home.

165
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,133
If they don't see,

166
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,594
then show them.

167
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,930
<i>Kima</i>.

168
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,138
Next time, you're cooking.

169
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:33,363
<i>Kima</i>.

170
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,242
<i>Nüma'ai kima</i>.

171
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,247
We have to go find
whatever left those tracks.

172
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,624
<i>Ühkitsi</i>.

173
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,783
<i>Tasiwoo Atsabi, yütsü tsaaku.</i>

174
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:45,912
<i>Ürako taa ahpü yühmuku</i>.

175
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,274
Sarii?

176
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,524
There you are.

177
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,487
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

178
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,406
Your brother sent us to bring you home.

179
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,490
Where is he?

180
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,742
Searching for you
on the other side of the pass.

181
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,996
Where are you going?

182
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,917
- I saw it.
- Saw what?

183
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,836
I saw what left those tracks.

184
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,254
- The bear?
- There was a bear,

185
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,423
but there was something else,
and it was huge.

186
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,267
I couldn't see it until it was
covered in blood, but it looked like...

187
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,138
Like a <i>mupitsl</i>.

188
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,390
You saw a monster from a children's story?

189
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,393
It fought and killed a bear
with its hands, easily.

190
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,312
How come it didn't kill you?

191
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,941
Stop!

192
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:00,693
You're going home.

193
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,945
Enough!

194
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,640
<i>Aitü</i>.

195
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,361
You wanna leave? Then leave.

196
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,327
We're going home.

197
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,377
There's something out there.

198
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:06,342
Quit it!

199
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,179
Just sit.

200
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,683
You need a leash for your weapon?

201
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,151
Get some water.
We'll rest a minute. Stay together.

202
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,955
- What about Ta a be?
- He'll meet us back at camp.

203
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,742
I said stay together.

204
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,913
I gotta go take a squat.
You want me to do it here?

205
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:39,834
Water.

206
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,681
You should see your face.

207
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:39,101
What do you think
drove the possums our way?

208
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,399
Hey. Cut me loose.

209
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,235
Stay down.

210
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,476
Shh.

211
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,618
We have him.

212
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,416
No. He has us.

213
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,821
<i>Regardez ici</i>.

214
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,157
<i>Regardez ici</i>.

215
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,495
<i>Une femme?</i>

216
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,372
<i>Qu'est-ce qu'elle fait ici?</i>

217
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,958
<i>Je vais la porter</i>.

218
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,459
<i>Elle va nous ralentir</i>.

219
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:41,296
<i>Non. Par la façon qu'elle courait,
je crois qu'elle I'a vu.</i>

220
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,819
<i>C'est ton nouveau blonde, hein?</i>

221
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,617
<i>Dégagez-moi ce put a in de chien!</i>

222
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,162
Sarii?

223
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,122
<i>J'ai pas un bon sentiment avec ça</i>.

224
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,349
You killed the buffalo.

225
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,440
Ah…

226
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:47,756
<i>T'es fâchée?
Maintenant, tu vas payer.</i>

227
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,639
<i>On va voir qu'est-ce qu'elle sait</i>.

228
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,011
<i>- Parle, sale Raphael.
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici, hein?</i>

229
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:55,639
<i>- C'est un piège?
- Qu'est-ce qui se passe?</i>

230
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,523
What did you see?

231
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,859
I speak a lot of languages.

232
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,072
You are Comanche, yes?

233
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:17,119
<i>- Je vais la tuer.
- Non, non, non, non, non, non, non.</i>

234
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,121
<i>On peut toujours I'utiliser</i>.

235
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,747
Ah.

236
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,920
You should be helping us.

237
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:30,924
I think this creature is a hunter,

238
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,761
looking for the strongest beast.

239
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,514
What do you know?

240
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:41,977
It killed your whole party.

241
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,062
<i>Je vais la faire chanter</i>.

242
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:45,981
No.

243
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,483
It didn't kill everyone.

244
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,029
If you were smart, you'd help us.

245
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:56,450
<i>Sors le sauvage.
Sortez-lui de la sacrée boîte!</i>

246
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:00,579
What?

247
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:06,168
<i>D'une façon ou d'une autre,
tu vas nous aider.</i>

248
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:10,714
<i>Fais-le saigner</i>.

249
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:28,482
Are you hurt?

250
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,736
Oh, they tried.

251
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,086
<i>On n'aurait pas dû amener les chevaux</i>.

252
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,798
<i>Fais-les taire ou la bête ne viendra pas</i>.

253
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,718
Son of a bitch.

254
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,848
The thing the white men
are trying to catch…

255
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,184
…that's what you went out after?

256
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,436
It's what you were tracking?

257
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,604
Yes.

258
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,899
And that's what you chose for <i>kühtaamia</i>?

259
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,491
<i>Elle est où cette pute de bête?</i>

260
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:22,410
<i>J'ai faim et j'ai be so in de pisser</i>.

261
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:31,878
<i>Qu'est-ce qui arrive?</i>

262
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,362
<i>Oh, non, non, non.
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?</i>

263
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,384
<i>- Qu'est-ce qui arrive?
- Qu'est-ce qui arrive? Rambert!</i>

264
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,969
<i>Tire, Rambert!</i>

265
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:47,936
<i>Merde</i>.

266
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,199
I need to get me a horse.

267
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,581
<i>Il est là!</i>

268
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:12,961
- It's coming.
<i>- Il est là!</i>

269
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,717
<i>Orü posa kwitapÜ</i>.

270
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,968
Naru.

271
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,014
Can you get your side loose?

272
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,003
Naru.

273
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,132
We're the bait. He's coming for us.

274
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:03,470
No.

275
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,683
No. It doesn't want bait.
It doesn't hunt that way.

276
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:15,357
Before the trappers captured me,
it saw me.

277
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,192
It came right up to me

278
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,319
and then left.

279
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,241
It didn't think I was a threat.

280
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,999
You wanna know how I killed that lion?

281
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:37,504
Your plan. The tree.

282
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,130
You weakened it.

283
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:41,633
You had it, Naru.

284
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:47,681
You can see what I miss.

285
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,141
You always have.

286
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,728
I don't know that this thing
can be killed.

287
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,901
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

288
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,414
<i>Maintenant!</i>

289
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,715
Naru.

290
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:23,550
Naru!

291
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:26,177
<i>On I'a!</i>

292
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:52,162
<i>Salopard!</i>

293
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,271
What are you doing?

294
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,358
I have a plan. Get down.

295
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,881
Do you remember the flood
when we were young?

296
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,468
I saw a beaver that had its legs
pinned between two rocks.

297
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:34,597
The water was rising so fast,
it knew it was going to die.

298
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,768
So it chewed off its own leg.

299
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,603
<i>Tirez!</i>

300
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,063
<i>On va frapper les autres!</i>

301
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:44,858
<i>Tirez!</i>

302
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,501
It was worth it to the beaver…

303
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,086
Wait.

304
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,796
…losing its leg to be free.

305
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,590
Wait. Naru.

306
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,342
What are you doing, Naru? Naru, stop!

307
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,099
I'm smarter than a beaver.

308
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:20,310
Come on, we gotta go.

309
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,867
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go get us those horses.

310
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,411
I'll get Sarii.

311
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:24,082
<i>Écartez. Écartez-vous!</i>

312
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,420
<i>Hâtons-nous un peu</i>.

313
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,493
<i>J'ai be so in d'aide</i>.

314
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:04,038
<i>On peut rien faire pour eux.
Simplement on do it continuer d'avancer.</i>

315
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:05,331
<i>Et le chien?</i>

316
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:08,001
<i>J'aime le chien</i>.

317
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,128
<i>Ça goûte mieux que le castor</i>.

318
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,076
Sarii.

319
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,786
<i>Owehkimia, Ta a be.</i>

320
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,704
Go!

321
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,011
Help me! Help.

322
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,556
You have medicine?

323
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:41,863
Help me, and I'll show you how to use it.

324
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:43,448
Please.

325
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:47,410
Please.

326
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:10,308
Take the powder
and put it in the gun.

327
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:13,561
Not too little, not too much.

328
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:19,650
And then what?

329
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:23,112
Then you take the ball and the cloth.

330
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:25,990
Put it in the gun.

331
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,744
After that, take the stick you see there.

332
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:34,207
You put in the gun, uh, three, four times.

333
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,459
Here.

334
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:39,921
Last thing.

335
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:42,507
It's okay.

336
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,305
Put powder here.

337
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:54,393
Then pull that back and it will fire.

338
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:56,813
That's all?

339
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,695
Please. It hurts.

340
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:08,199
Please.

341
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,540
What is it?

342
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:34,517
What's happening? I'm freezing cold.

343
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,898
Please.

344
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:42,233
Don't leave me.

345
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,774
It can't see him.

346
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:30,776
Hey!

347
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,292
"Not too much, not too little."

348
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,602
<i>Isa'ai!</i>

349
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:20,367
We should go.

350
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,120
Ta a be.

351
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:25,664
Run, Naru.

352
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,583
It thinks I'm the threat.

353
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,544
This is as far as I go.

354
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:34,548
No more. This is it.

355
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:37,426
- No.
- Bring it home.

356
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:44,798
<i>Non! Ah, non! Non, arrête!</i>

357
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,050
<i>Put a in!</i>

358
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,070
You bled my brother.

359
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,115
So now you bleed.

360
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:13,619
<i>Idiote sauvage!</i>

361
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,125
You think that I am not a hunter like you.

362
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:28,926
<i>Tu ne sais même pas
I'erreur que tu viens de faire.</i>

363
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,637
That I am not a threat.

364
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,265
<i>Je vais mettre
une balle dans ton crâne.</i>

365
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:37,434
That is what makes me dangerous.

366
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:42,439
<i>Tu vas mourir, chienne!</i>

367
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:46,318
You can't see that I'm killing you.

368
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:05,838
And it won't either.

369
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:35,909
<i>Démon!</i>

370
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,079
<i>Non!</i>

371
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:21,426
<i>Petsü!</i>

372
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:19,484
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

373
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:20,569
Do it.

374
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:22,946
Come on, do it.

375
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:26,533
This is as far as you go.

376
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:28,368
No more.

377
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:31,621
This is it.

378
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,957
<i>Naru iku kima</i>!

379
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:22,756
<i>Arüka ikÜ! Arüka, Naru kima</i>.

380
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:24,257
<i>Naru kima</i>.

381
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:26,760
<i>Hina ma yaa</i>?

382
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:35,185
<i>Hina ma yaa</i>?

383
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,050
There is danger nearby.

384
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:09,135
We need to move
to easier protected ground.

385
01:29:10,305 --> 01:30:10,505
