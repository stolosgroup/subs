TIM:
<i>Time is a funny thing.</i>

5
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:07,536
<i>-When I was a kid...</i>
-YOUNG TIM: One.

00:01:07,578 --> 00:01:09,246
<i>-...the days lasted forever.</i>
-Two.

-TIM: <i>But the years...</i>
-Wait! Over here.

9
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,584
<i>-...well, they went by so fast.</i>
-Four.

10
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:15,461
-Five. Six.
-Tim, no peeking.

11
00:01:15,503 --> 00:01:16,796
TED SR.:
Yeah, no peeking.

12
00:01:16,837 --> 00:01:18,255
-TIM: <i>Before you know it...</i>
-Seven.

<i>-It even happened to me.</i>
-Nine.

15
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:23,594
Nine and a half. Ten!

16
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:25,805
Ready or not, here I come.
(grunts)

17
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:28,057
<i>My name's Tim, and this...</i>

18
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,059
<i>well, this is</i>

19
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:31,769
-(roars playfully)
-Run for your lives!

20
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:33,437
(laughing):
No fair, Dad. You peeked.

21
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,231
(laughter, squealing)

22
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:37,400
<i>-They call me a stay-at-home</i>

23
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:39,443
<i>...I hardly get</i>
<i>to stay at home.</i>

24
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:41,404
Buckle up, Templetons.

25
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:43,030
Ready?

26
00:01:43,072 --> 00:01:44,740
-Set.
-Go!

TIM:
<i>Now, some might say</i>

29
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:50,913
<i>I still have</i>
<i>an overactive imagination,</i>

30
00:01:50,955 --> 00:01:54,375
<i>but being a dad is</i>
<i>the coolest job in the world.</i>

31
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:56,043
<i>Bunch of cool jobs, really.</i>

32
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:57,670
(laughing)

33
00:01:57,712 --> 00:01:59,255
<i>Sometimes I'm</i>
<i>a race car driver.</i>

34
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,465
CAROL:
Whoo! Daddy-o Andretti!

35
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:02,967
TABITHA:
Yay, Templetons!

36
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:04,593
TIM (Southern accent):
<i>Well, and then sometimes</i>

37
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:06,178
<i>I'm the best darn cook</i>
<i>in the county</i>

38
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,471

-Come on, Pa, hit me.
-(burps)

-(Tina laughs)

41
00:02:11,642 --> 00:02:13,853
Whew, doggie!
And the house wins again.

-CAROL: Yay! -TABITHA: Woo-hoo!

43

-Spork.
-Spork.

-Spatula.
-Spatula.

46
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:25,698
Give my creature life!

47
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,492
-(growling)
-(Carol and Tabitha gasp)

48
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:29,994
She's alive!

49
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:32,288
TIM: <i>We have our ups,</i>
<i>and we have our downs.</i>

50
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,664
-(whimpers)
-No, no, no. Look. Look.

51
00:02:33,706 --> 00:02:34,957
-Lamb Lamb's okay. See?
-Yay!

52
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:36,792
TIM:
<i>But we always stick together.</i>

53
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,961
<i>-My wife, Carol.</i>
-It's a miracle!

54
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:40,921
TIM: <i>She's the</i>
<i>breadwinner of the family.</i>

55
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:42,840
-(applause) -Thank you.
You know what they say:

56
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:44,550
-"It's all about the dough."
-(laughter)

57
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:46,469
And I couldn't have done it
without my husband.

58
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,054
He really rose to the occasion.

59
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:50,306
-It's the yeast I can do.
-(cheering) -Yeah, Mama!

60
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:52,516
TIM:
<i>She brings home the bacon, too,</i>

61
00:02:52,558 --> 00:02:54,727
<i>while I keep an eye</i>
<i>on our new baby, Tina.</i>

62
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:56,729
<i>(chuckles):</i>
<i>But sometimes, feels like</i>

63
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:58,689
<i>she's keeping an eye on me.</i>

64
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:00,316
<i>-And Tabitha...</i>
-Thank you!

65
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:02,485
<i>...our little second-grader</i>

-(laughter)

67
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:05,446
Yay, Tabitha!

68
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:06,947
TIM:
<i>We're so proud.</i>

69

76
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,336
TIM: <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>they haven't changed much.</i>

77

<i>And as for</i>

78
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:24,340
<i>well, he grew up</i>

<i>him anymore.</i>-(toy squeaking)

80
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,761
-(phone rings)
<i>-But, hey, he always remembers</i>

81
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:31,222
<i>to send inappropriately</i>
<i>lavish gifts</i>

82
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:33,015
<i>-on special occasions.</i>
-(Tabitha squeals)

-OMG! Uncle Ted is the best!

TIM:
<i>All in all,</i>

<i>my life is pretty perfect.</i>

(yelps, gasps)

91
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,448
Good heavens.

92
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,617
I'll save you!

93
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,619
-Ha!
-(Tina screams, laughs)

94
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:55,204
Thanks, babe.

95
00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:56,622
Stay calm, Tabitha.

96
00:03:56,664 --> 00:03:58,082
I'm coming for you.

97
00:03:58,124 --> 00:04:02,086
I'm gonna save you
from the bubbling lava!

98
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:03,713
Dad, what are you doing?

99
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:06,132
Ew, gross. It went everywhere.

100
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:08,718
Come on, this is
the candy volcano of doom!

101
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,928
You used to love it.
(mimics explosion)

102
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,055
But I'm trying
to do my homework,

103
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:14,557
or I'm doomed.

104
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:16,309
Oh.

105
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,519
<i>Because if there's</i>

(gasps) Oh, no.

112
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:39,040
Good night, Dr. Hawking.

113
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,131
Carbon, boron, beryllium,
lithium, helium, hydrogen.

114
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:49,216
Nailed it.

115
00:04:49,258 --> 00:04:51,135
Boom shakalaka.

-TIM: Hey there, Tabitha.
-(Carol whoops, Tina laughs)

119
00:04:58,434 --> 00:04:59,935
It's <i>The Good Night Show.</i>

120
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:02,855
Live from your bedroom,
starring Dad and Mom.

00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:05,608
-And special guest, baby Tina.
-(laughing)

122
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,777
Good night, little Tina. Mwah!

123
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:09,570
Come back here, you.
(chuckles)

124
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:11,155
-Good night, Mom.
-Mwah!

125
00:05:11,197 --> 00:05:12,823
Good night, sweetheart.
Mama's gonna kiss you.

126
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:14,283
-Mama gonna kiss you.
-(Tim clears throat)

127
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:15,493
* Good night song *

128
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:16,994
-* With your dad... *
-What?

129
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:18,621
What? It's time for
your good-night song.

130
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:20,331
Oh, no, thanks.

131
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:22,708
I'm listening to white noise!

132
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,293
Helps me fall asleep!

133
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:26,462
(mimicking white noise)

134
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:28,673
Hey, what would you say

135
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:31,634
to me helping you rehearse
for the holiday pageant?

136
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:33,094
-(gasps)
-Yes! Right?

137
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:34,971
I can come to school with you,
and you can get

138
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:36,639
all your friends together,
and we can rehearse together,

139
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:38,641
go get some ice cream after.

140
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:40,726
-My treat.
-No! You can't do that.

141
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:42,770
Um, liability issues.

142
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:44,647
It's this whole thing.

143
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:46,983
Oh. Right, right.
(chuckles)

144
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:48,234
Right.

145
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:50,861
Whoa. How about your favorite
bedtime story?

146
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:52,780
You know, the one about...

147
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:54,865
Uncle Ted was
a magical talking baby.

148
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:56,909
There was a rocket
full of puppies,

149
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:58,911
-and you saved the world.
-(shushing)

150
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,329
It was a good story, wasn't it?

151
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:04,375
Well, it didn't really make
a lot of sense.

152
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,168
The jokes were good, right?

153
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,628
Mm.

154
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,672
-Okay. Um...
-Dad.

155
00:06:09,714 --> 00:06:10,965
(yawns)

156
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:13,342
My schedule is brutal tomorrow.

157
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:16,345
(grunting): Yeah. My schedule's
pretty brutal, too.

158
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:18,347
Oh, don't forget Lamb Lamb.

159
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:20,182
Good night, Lamb Lamb.

160
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:22,101
(kisses)
Good night, Uncle Ted.

161
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:24,937
I hope to grow up and be
a success, just like you.

162
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,231
Maybe we'll see you soon.

163
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,237
Good night, Tabitha.

164
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,241
Don't you think
I'm a little old for that now?

165
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,910
Uh, okay.

166
00:06:39,952 --> 00:06:42,455
I think it's time
we both grow up.

167
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:45,833
I look forward to greeting you
at the breakfast table.

168
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:54,133
Sweet dreams.

169
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:12,026
Hmm.

170
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,404
* *

171
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:23,746
Where has the time gone?

172
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:26,207
WIZZIE:
How should I know? (grunts)

173
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:29,001
-Wait, wait. I see light.
-(toy train tooting)

174
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:31,962
You, oh, out of my way.
(yells)

175
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:34,090
(gasps) At long last.

176
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:36,801
The sweet breath of freedom.

177
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:38,052
Wizzie?

178
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:39,762
You there,
what century is this?

179
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:42,098
(shudders)
Unhand me, vile ogre!

180
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:43,683
No, no, no, no.
Wizzie, it's me.

181
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:45,226
-It's Tim.
-(gasps)

182
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:47,186
Is it really you?

183
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:48,854
Come closer.

184
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:50,815
Let me see your face.

185
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:52,608
Closer.

186
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,694
Closer still.

187
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,529
Oh, Timothy.

188
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,780
It is you.

189
00:07:57,822 --> 00:07:59,490
Hey! What was that for?

190
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:01,701
You cast me into
eternal darkness

191
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:04,620
and wreaked havoc
on my circadian rhythms.

192
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:05,955
I'm sorry, Wizzie.

193
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:07,623
Hey, but you look great,
though.

194
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:09,834
Except for the arm, you mean.

195
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,127
(chuckles)
I didn't even notice.

196
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:12,545
-You thought it.
-I mean, I noticed it,

197
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:14,171
'cause I... you obviously
don't have an arm. I-I...

198
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:16,090
You would never treat
Lamb Lamb this way.

199
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:18,884
Well, I... I gave her
to my daughter, Tabitha.

200
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:20,678
You have produced
an heir, Timothy?

201
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,013
Two, actually.

202
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:23,556
Two? Let the bells ring!

203
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:24,932
(bells jingling,
alarms blaring)

204
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:26,600
-No, no, no. Wizzie, stop.
-Yes! Yes!

205
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:28,477
-Wizzie, shh! Quiet, quiet.
-It's a time for celebration!

206
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,479
No, no, no. It's not
the time for celebration.

207
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,189
-Wizzie, shh. Be quiet.
-What? What is it?

208
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:34,108
-What is it, Tim?
-I don't know.

209
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,943
-(alarms stop)
-I guess I'm just not feeling

210
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:38,070
very celebratory right now.

211
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:39,989
Oh?

212
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:41,824
Tabitha. (sighs)

213
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:45,995
Man, Wizzie,
she's growing up so fast.

214
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:48,039
It's like she doesn't even
need me anymore.

215
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,625
Yes, first, they start
spending less time with you.

216
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,085
TIM:
Mm.

217
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:55,296
Then they stop coming
to you for advice.

218
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:56,297
Exactly.

219
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,424
Soon, they take you
for granted.

220
00:08:58,466 --> 00:08:59,842
I guess.

221
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:01,802
-Then break your arm.
-What?

222
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:03,387
Then stuff you into a box!

223
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:05,348
Okay. Wizzie, you're...
you're not helping.

224
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:06,641
(Wizzie scoffs)

225
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:08,017
Okay, I'm just... I'm afraid

226
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:10,102
Tabitha and I
are growing apart,

227
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:13,189
like... like I did
with my brother.

228
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,899
Oh.

229
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,985
I thought we had
all the time in the world.

230
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:20,696
But you can't
turn back time, can you?

231
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:23,324
How dare you question my power!

232
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:26,744
-Turn back. Turn back.
-Oh, here we go.

233
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:29,372
-Oh, great wheel of li...
-Wait. (shushes)

234
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:31,207
-(Wizzie snoring)
-Did you hear that?

235
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:34,210
(gasps)
Never abuse the snooze button!

236
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:36,295
(shushes) It sounds like it's
coming from the baby's room.

237
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:38,297
What is it?
A creature of the night?

238
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,384
Witches? Is it the baying
of the hounds of hell?

239
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:42,718
Wizzie!

240
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,886
Don't go, Tim!

241
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:45,471
I can turn back time--

242
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:49,058
to the golden years,
when it was just you and me.

243
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,726
My good arm.

244
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,478
Don't open the door.

245
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,397
(fading in distance):
Remember last time!

246
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:56,941
(muffled voice
speaking indistinctly)

247
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:00,111
AUTOMATED VOICE: If you would
like to make a call,

248
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:01,612
please hang up and try again.

249
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:05,783
If you need help, hang up
and then dial your operator.

250
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:07,576
Thank you.

251
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:08,744
(whispers):
Hello?

252
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:10,329
If you would like
to make a call,

253
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:12,999
-please hang up and try again.
-Ah. Just my phone.

254
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,126
Get it together, man.

255
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,461
Oh, Tina, you little klepto...

256
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:19,547
Nighty night.

257
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:20,756
...maniac!

258
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:23,259
(rapid babbling)

259
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,427
Whoa!

260
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:27,179
Hi, Daddy.

261
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:29,265
T-Tabitha? Is that you?

262
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:30,516
(laughing)

263
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:31,934
(gasps)

264
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:33,978
(laughing):
You should've seen your face.

265
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,855
Oh, it's priceless.

266
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,356
You're... You... You-you...

267
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:39,775
(mock gasping)

268
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:41,277
You-you can talk?

269
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:43,446
Yep.
I'm in the family business.

270
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:46,115
(whispers):
It's a clip-on tie. (shushes)

271
00:10:46,157 --> 00:10:48,409
You see, Daddy,
BabyCorp is more of what I...

272
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:50,077
Oops.

273
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:52,455
Daddy, Daddy, come in.
Can you hear me?

274
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:54,081
-Daddy, do you read me?
-(Tim groaning)

275
00:10:54,123 --> 00:10:55,791
Daddy, how many fingers
am I holding up?

276
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,001
Thursday?

277
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:58,294
I should've given you
a warning.

278
00:10:58,336 --> 00:10:59,837
I forgot you were an old man.

279
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,339
(yells, spits)

280
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,340
Wait, wait.

281
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:04,216
-You're from BabyCorp?
-Yes.

282
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:06,218
BabyCorp is more of what I call

283
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,054
-a side hustle for me.
-Uh-huh.

284
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:10,139
The point is I'm all in
on the Templetons.

285
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:11,641
-Go, Templetons!
-Oh! Okay.

286
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:13,476
You guys really know
how to baby a baby.

287
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:15,061
-I mean, it's incredible.
-Oh, oh. (chuckles)

288
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:16,646
Not that's it's all five-star.

289
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:18,648
-I have to say, you got
a lot of issues. -Sure. Yeah.

290
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:19,857
We'll talk about that later.

291
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:21,275
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe this.

292
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:23,444
Hey, want to go scare
the crap out of Mom?

293
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:25,404
-Daddy, please stay focused.
-(chuckles) Oh.

294
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:26,947
(grunts)
Right, right, right.

295
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:28,658
There's a crisis at BabyCorp.

296
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:29,784
What is it this time?

297
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:30,826
(gasps) Kittens?

298
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:32,953
No. This time, it's even worse.

299
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:34,205
-Worse than kittens?
-Yes.

300
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:35,998
That's why I volunteered for

301
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,875
-this supersecret assignment.
-TOY: Mommy.

302
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,794
Ooh, I want to help.
What-what do you want me to do?

303
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:41,337
That's the spirit, Daddy.

304
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:44,173
-You are exactly who I need.
-Yes!

305
00:11:44,215 --> 00:11:45,966
To get Uncle Ted.

306
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:47,677
No. What?

307
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:49,178
What-What's with the face?

308
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,681
Daddy, BabyCorp can't wait
any longer.

309
00:11:51,722 --> 00:11:52,974
All the pressure's on me, Pop.

310
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:55,184
When I volunteered
for this gig,

311
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:57,103
I thought it would be easy.

312
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:58,688
But you two never
see each other.

313
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:00,272
It's so sad.

314
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:02,483
It's like, "F-minus.
See me after class."

315
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:03,693
(gargles)

316
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:05,027
Sad? Uh, yeah, maybe.

317
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:06,237
A little. I don't know.

318
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:07,655
Did you forget to call him?

319
00:12:07,697 --> 00:12:09,573
I noticed you can be
a little absentminded.

320
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:10,950
Sorry, what?

321
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:12,702
It's just that you tend
to procrastinate.

322
00:12:12,743 --> 00:12:14,870
-You have to get him here for
the holidays. -(line ringing)

323
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:16,163
-No, I'm not...
-(ringing stops)

324
00:12:16,205 --> 00:12:17,581
No, I'm not
gonna call him right now.

325
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:19,041
-Daddy, can't never could.
-No. -(line ringing)

326
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,418
Did you two have
a fight or something?

327
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,211
-No.
-But you're mad at him?

328
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:24,505
-Stop that. It's complicated.
-(ringing stops)

329
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:26,632
-Why? Do you need help using
your phone? -(line ringing)

330
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:28,384
-No, I don't need help
using my... -(ringing stops)

331
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:29,927
-Okay. What's the problem?
-(sighs) -(line ringing)

332
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:31,429
What's the issue?
Talk to me.

333
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,180
-There's no point, okay?
-(ringing stops)

334
00:12:33,222 --> 00:12:35,224
I call him. I invite him.
He never shows up.

335
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:37,226
He's always got a work meeting
or a business trip

336
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:38,894
or a conference call.

337
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:40,771
All he cares about is work.

338
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:44,734
But after a while, you...
you just stop trying.

339
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:46,944
-He's still your brother.
-(line ringing)

340
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:49,238
You were partners.

341
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,990
-Yeah, I guess sometimes
you just... -(ringing stops)

342
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:55,119
you grow up and grow apart.

343
00:12:56,912 --> 00:12:58,205
-(line ringing)
-(gasps)

344
00:12:58,247 --> 00:12:59,874
Daddy, don't say no.

345
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:01,292
What if everybody said no?

346
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:02,460
Nothing would happen.

347
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:03,878
Nothing would get
off the ground.

348
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,212
You got to wake up every day

349
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:07,006
and you got to say,
"Yes, yes, yes!"

350
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:10,426
Surprise me. Say yes.

351
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:11,594
(sighs)

352
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:12,470
(ringing stops)

353
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:15,097
This is really disappointing.

354
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:17,391
-And now I'm getting mad!
-It's late.

355
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:19,477
We can work on this
tomorrow, okay?

356
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:21,187
-(grunts)
-(toy squeaks)

357
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:24,106
Oh. Whoopsie.
Your little horsey fell off.

358
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:26,651
Another day won't hurt, right?

359
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:29,153
Good night, sweetie.

360
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:30,905
-(door closes)
-(scoffs)

361
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:33,491
(tape rewinding)

362
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:34,950
TIM (recorded):
Good night, sweetie.

363
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:36,786
-...horsey fell off.
-(rewinding)

364
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:38,454
Tabitha?

365
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,709
* *

366
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:53,302
(low rumbling,
objects rattling)

367
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:56,806
Huh?

368
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:58,683
(gasps, squeals)

369
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:14,740
* *

370
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:27,712
Uh, don't worry. I got it.

371
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:29,588
-(Tim yells, groans)
-Where is she? Where is she?

372
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,340
-Where's who? What?
-I came as fast as I could.

373
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:32,883
-Ted?
-I canceled all my meetings.

374
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:34,844
What are you doing here?
(grunts) Why are you yelling?

375
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:36,095
-Where's Tabitha?
-Tabitha?

376
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:37,513
-Where is she, Tim?
-CAROL: Ted.

377
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:39,181
Uncle Ted, you're here!
You're really here.

378
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:40,766
-Which arm is it?
Left or right? -Huh?

379
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:42,685
-Is it your fibula? Talk to me.
-Whoa.

380
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:44,353
-Good dilation. Open up.
-(groans)

381
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:46,272
-Say, "Ah." Are you okay?
-Wh-What are you doing?

382
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:47,565
-You look okay.
-Whoa.

383
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:49,358
Don't worry.
I'm fine, Uncle Ted.

384
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,694
-That's my girl.
-Woo-hoo.

385
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:53,321
Uh, wh-what brings you
into town?

386
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:54,697
Well, Tabitha fell
off her pony.

387
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:56,532
-She did?
-She did?

388
00:14:56,574 --> 00:14:57,533
I did?

389
00:14:57,575 --> 00:14:59,702
-Tim left me a voice mail.
-He did?

390
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:01,245
-I did?
-You did.

391
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:03,164
TIM (cobbled from recording):
Hello. This is your brother.

392
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:04,874
Help. Tabitha fell off horsey.

393
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:06,125
Good night, sweetie.

394
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,793
Well, that was unsettling.

395
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:11,380
I swear I didn't
leave that message.

396
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:14,467
-(coos)
-On... purpose.

397
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:15,593
I...

398
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:16,594
Butt-dialed?

399
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:18,095
(chuckles)
With my butt.

400
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:19,472
While I was talking
in my sleep.

401
00:15:19,513 --> 00:15:21,057
I do that sometimes.

402
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:22,683
You sleep-butt-dialed me?

403
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:25,770
-With my butt.
-(Carol chuckling)

404
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:29,190
I knew there must be a
perfectly logical explanation.

405
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:30,983
(chuckles)
And there it is.

406
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:32,902
-TED: Hmm. -All that matters
is that you're here.

407
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:35,112
-TABITHA: Woo-hoo! Yay!
-(Tina squeals)

408
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:36,572
-Absolutely. Uh, for now.
-(Tina giggling)

409
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:38,574
Uncle Ted, please stay
for Christmas. Please.

410
00:15:38,616 --> 00:15:41,243
Sorry, sweetie. I can't
do Christmas on the 25th.

411
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:43,496
But, Uncle Ted,
I missed you so much.

412
00:15:43,537 --> 00:15:45,247
<i>(echoing):</i>
<i>I missed you so much.</i>

413
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:46,916
<i>-I missed you so much.</i>
-Mm... wah!

414
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:48,876
TABITHA: <i>Don't you think</i>
<i>I'm a little old for that now?</i>

415
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,586
<i>(echoing): Don't you think</i>
<i>I'm a little old for that now?</i>

416
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:52,254
<i>Don't you think</i>
<i>I'm a little old for that now?</i>

417
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:54,298
(chuckles) Can I talk to you
in the kitchen?

418
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:56,676
Alone.

419
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:00,680
-TED: The baby, Tim?
-(shushes)

420
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:03,349
She's been sent from up there.

421
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:06,018
-Upstairs?
-That's right. BabyCorp.

422
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,563
So you're saying the voice mail
was some kind of call for help.

423
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:11,565
Yes! No.

424
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:14,485
She comes from a secret
corporation run by babies.

425
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:18,447
Tim, I'm gonna give you
the name of a doctor.

426
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:22,284
Roy Federman. Just tell him
I sent you, okay?

427
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:23,536
(hushed):
What are they saying?

428
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:25,037
We should give them
some privacy.

429
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,330
-Here you go.
-Ooh. Thanks.

430
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:27,665
TIM:
I'm not crazy!

431
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:29,417
You just don't remember.
Tell him, Tina.

432
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,751
-He... I...
-TED: She can't talk, Tim.

433
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:32,461
-TIM: Stop interrupting.
-(Tina groans)

434
00:16:32,503 --> 00:16:33,796
TED: Interrupting what?
I don't hear anything.

435
00:16:33,838 --> 00:16:35,965
Except your obnoxious voice.
You hear that.

436
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:38,134
I have a beautiful voice.

437
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:39,552
-(groans)
-TIM: Fine.

438
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:41,429
I can prove that
everything I'm saying is real.

439
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,805
-TED: Oh, yeah?
-TIM: Yeah!

440
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:43,806
Suck it, Ted.

441
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:44,849
I beg your pardon?

442
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,975
You, suck.

443
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:47,435
No, no, Tim. You suck.

444
00:16:47,476 --> 00:16:48,811
CAROL: Time to go buy
a Christmas tree.

445
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:50,521
But we already have
a Christmas tree.

446
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:52,732
-No, we don't. No, we don't.
-Yes, we do. Yes, we do.

447
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:54,317
Suck it, suck it, suck it,
suck it, suck it, suck it.

448
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:55,860
-Get that pacie out of my face!
-Excuse me.

449
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:58,988
I hate to interrupt,
but may I make a suggestion?

450
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,364
Why don't you both suck it?

451
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:02,325
-Ha! (whoops)
-(grunts)

452
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:04,118
(grunting)

453
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,120
-She can talk.
-A lot.

454
00:17:06,162 --> 00:17:07,288
(whoops)

455
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,914
Buckle up, boys.

456
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:10,541
(sucking rapidly)

457
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,835
(all screaming)

458
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:15,171
-TINA: Baby on board!
-(Tim whooping)

459
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:17,381
-That's what I'm talking about!
-(laughs) Woo-hoo!

460
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:19,800
(screaming)

461
00:17:21,177 --> 00:17:22,345
(sighs)

462
00:17:22,386 --> 00:17:24,889
* *

463
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:33,898
TIM:
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

464
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:36,359
(both grunt)

465
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,027
(yelps)

466
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:40,071
-Wow.
-(Tina laughs)

467
00:17:40,112 --> 00:17:41,697
(gasps)

468
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:43,032
I'm home.

469
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:44,325
TIM:
Yeah. See?

470
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:45,785
It's all real.

471
00:17:45,826 --> 00:17:46,869
TED:
Whoa.

472
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:49,038
Is that me?

473
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,791
TINA: If you're fishing for
a compliment, you caught one!

474
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:54,210
You are a legend in this joint.

475
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,711
A statue?

476
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:58,255
Well, I did single-handedly
save the company.

477
00:17:58,297 --> 00:17:59,799
Double-handedly.

478
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,217
(chuckling):
Right? We were partners.

479
00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:02,343
Really?

480
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:04,053
I don't see your statue.

481
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:05,680
I still love you, Daddy.

482
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:07,682
TIM:
They got the head size right.

483
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:08,975
(ding)

484
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,227
TED: Take it from me,
you have to be aggressive

485
00:18:11,268 --> 00:18:12,520
if you want to get ahead.

486
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:14,230
Climb that corporate ladder

487
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:16,899
-until you're the last baby
standing at the top. -TIM: Wow.

488
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:19,860
Actually, I prioritize
a good work-life balance

489
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:23,406
and a positive environment
where my ideas are valued.

490
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:25,574
(laughing)

491
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:26,951
Oh, you're serious.

492
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:28,828
You're funny, Uncle Ted.

493
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:31,080
I wonder why they didn't
mention that in your file.

494
00:18:31,122 --> 00:18:32,248
My file?

495
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:33,791
-You saw my file?
-(Tim sighs)

496
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,084
-Yep.
-What does it say?

497
00:18:35,126 --> 00:18:36,419
It says a lot.

498
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,838
-This is the Crisis Center.
-Whoa. Wow.

499
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:41,340
This is where we monitor
all threats

500
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:43,342
to babies around the world.

501
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:44,635
And Hawaii.

502
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:46,429
This is so cool.
This is so cool.

503
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,431
(roaring):
I'm Godzilla.

504
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:49,974
"Oh, run for your lives!
Run for your lives!"

505
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:52,351
-Why did we bring him?
-Daddy, get down from there.

506
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:55,104
-Aw. -We can play on it later
when no one is looking.

507
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:56,814
-What's the crisis?
-Yeah.

508
00:18:56,856 --> 00:18:58,441
Here we go.
What's the crisis, sweetie?

509
00:18:58,482 --> 00:18:59,859
Rusty, roll it.

510
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,777
(snores, whines)

511
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:03,779
He's new.

512
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:07,616
DR. ARMSTRONG (over speakers):
Just imagine, baby surgeons.

513
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:09,952
-(buzzer sounds) -Uh-oh.
-(babies giggling)

514
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:12,288
Or baby astronauts.

515
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,458
(singsongy):
Floaty, floaty, float.

516
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:18,794
Yes, babies are gonna
run the world one day.

517
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:22,048
And that day is coming
sooner than you think.

518
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:25,051
Hello. My name is
Dr. Erwin Armstrong,

519
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:27,637
founder of The Acorn Center
for Advanced Childhood.

520
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:29,597
Wait a minute, that's...
that's Tabitha's school.

521
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:31,974
Here at the center,
we believe babies

522
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:34,602
are the ultimate
learning machines.

523
00:19:34,644 --> 00:19:36,562
Isn't that right,
little Nathan?

524
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:38,731
-Yeah!
-(chuckles): Okay.

525
00:19:38,773 --> 00:19:40,316
They should use
their precious time

526
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:42,777
to develop faster, push harder.

527
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:44,195
-Hmm. -(Tim scoffs)
-Parents, they have the best

528
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:47,156
intentions, of course,
but they're not experts.

529
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:51,285
After all, the only thing
holding your child back is...

530
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:53,079
-you.
-KIDS: You!

531
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,790
This explains why Tabitha's
been pulling away from me.

532
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:57,708
-It's the school.
-ARMSTRONG: Everybody, wave.

533
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,293
-Bye, Mommy.
-KIDS: Bye, Mommy!

534
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:00,544
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye, Daddy!

535
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:03,172
(singsongy):
Sayonara.

536
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:05,257
Now, in the past six months,

537
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:08,260
these schools have been
popping up all over the world.

538
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:09,512
Uh, so what's the problem?

539
00:20:09,553 --> 00:20:11,180
The school is the problem.

540
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:12,640
Yeah. School is evil.

541
00:20:12,682 --> 00:20:14,850
No, Daddy,
not all schools are evil.

542
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:16,978
-It's just this one, okay?
-Okay.

543
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:19,105
If Armstrong's philosophy
keeps spreading,

544
00:20:19,146 --> 00:20:21,273
it could be
the end of childhood.

545
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:22,733
No.

546
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:25,069
Childhood was the worst
three years of my life.

547
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:26,654
That's so sad.

548
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:28,531
You probably just
didn't do it right.

549
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:29,824
-Huh?
-Aw.

550
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:32,076
But luckily, you get a do-over.

551
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:34,286
A second chance.

552
00:20:35,454 --> 00:20:38,958
BabyCorp has developed
a new super-duper baby formula

553
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,877
-that can turn a grown-up
back into a baby. -(baby coos)

554
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,213
We have it in cherry, grape,
orange and lime.

555
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:46,007
-For real?
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

556
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:47,967
-You want me to be a baby?
-Hey, it's what you do best.

557
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:50,094
So you can infiltrate
the school and find out

558
00:20:50,136 --> 00:20:52,805
what Dr. Armstrong
is really up to.

559
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:55,391
BabyCorp will
take care of the rest.

560
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:57,226
(whoops)

561
00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:58,894
(Tim gasps, laughs)

562
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:00,896
It's the perfect disguise.

563
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:03,858
And it only lasts
48 teensy-weensy hours.

564
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:05,651
Oh, I am in on the mission.

565
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:06,819
-Sorry, Pops.
-Ow.

566
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:08,696
-It's not your mission.
-Aw.

567
00:21:08,738 --> 00:21:10,740
"Warning:
may cause drooling, babbling,

568
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:12,575
"emotional outbursts,
fits of laughter,

569
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:16,579
loss of bowel control,
chubby thighs"?

570
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,415
I think some guys at my gym
take this stuff.

571
00:21:19,457 --> 00:21:20,541
(screams)

572
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,335
My texting hand!

573
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:24,670
-Even though it is your
daughter's school. -(screaming)

574
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:26,172
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

575
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:27,673
Daddy, no. Please stop.

576
00:21:27,715 --> 00:21:29,091
(glugs) Whoa!

577
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:30,801
(babbling rapidly)

578
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:32,720
What? It actually works.

579
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:33,929
(Ted straining)

580
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:35,765
-TED: It's mine!
-(yells)

581
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:37,600
-I'm better with
this kind of thing! -Oh!

582
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:39,143
(glugs, screams)

583
00:21:39,185 --> 00:21:41,437
And what kind of thing is that,
Flock of Seagulls?

584
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,272
-(both grunting)
-(record scratches)

-Everything!
-Gotcha!

587
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:49,945
You might feel very emotional,
have some mood swings.

Hey! (screams)

591
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:56,327
Ouch.
There's the awkward stage.

592
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:57,953
Now, the tea's hot, Connie.

593
00:21:57,995 --> 00:21:59,955
You always have to be
the hero, don't you?

594
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:01,874
What's that supposed to mean?
(grunts)

595
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,126
Never see him...
(frightened whimpering)

596
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:06,128
All of a sudden,
he shows up with a pony.

(screams) You're just jealous,
helmet head.

She's my daughter!

She's my niece. (screams)

It's not personal.

It's business, Leslie.

I have to cut this short.

00:23:15,406 --> 00:23:16,782
Um, upstairs now.

632
00:23:16,824 --> 00:23:18,200
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

633
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:19,660
-(both grunting)
-CAROL: Push it. No, no, pull.

634
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:20,786
-Go, go, go, go, go.
-Push it up.

635
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:22,371
-(grunts, whoops)
-Pull. No, okay.

636
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:24,457
-To the right.
-How come I have the heavy end?

637
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:26,375
CAROL: Because you're young
and strong, honey.

638
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:27,752
Little bit more.

639
00:23:27,793 --> 00:23:28,919
-Me first!
-(grunts)

640
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:30,212
-CAROL: Come on.
-Get off.

641
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:32,048
-Tim? Ted?
-Mom.

642
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:33,424
Get the cord. Get the cord.

643
00:23:33,466 --> 00:23:34,717
Get the cord,
get the cord, get the cord!

644
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,427
You just can't disappear.

645
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:37,762
You need a cover story.

646
00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:39,263
-TED: Ow!
-Oh, right.

647
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:40,389
My soft spot.

648
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:41,557
CAROL:
Where are you guys?

649
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,767
Uh, uh, tell her
you're packing.

650
00:23:42,808 --> 00:23:45,603
We're upstairs, uh, packing.

651
00:23:45,645 --> 00:23:47,063
-Packing? For what?
-(Tabitha yells)

652
00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:48,814
Ooh. You're going on
a brother bonding trip.

653
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:51,400
-We're going on
a brother bonding trip. -Ow!

654
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:53,027
Now?

655
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:54,695
But, Tim, your parents
are coming tomorrow.

656
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:56,405
They can help out.

657
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:58,282
Yeah, they could help out.

658
00:23:58,324 --> 00:24:01,202
What... No, you can't leave me
alone with your parents.

659
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:02,870
-(Tina yells, laughs)
-Oh, Tina!

660
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:05,539
(grunts)
What are you doing?

661
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:07,041
(both grunting)

662
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,251
All right, you know what?
You're going to baby jail.

663
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:11,087
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! -Tabitha!

664
00:24:11,128 --> 00:24:12,588
-CAROL: Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
-TABITHA: A little help here.

665
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,048
CAROL:
Honey, hold it up. Hold it up.

666
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,758
(deep voice):
This is Ted Templeton, a man.

667
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,468
You can go ahead and take off.
I have urgent family business.

668
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,679
-CAROL: To the right, honey.
-Yes, I have a family.

669
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,597
-Tim, I'm coming up there.
-(Tina gasps)

670
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:23,557
Yeah, we need to talk.

671
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,226
TABITHA:
Hey, Mom?

672
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:26,435
Oh! Tina!

673
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:27,853
(squeals, laughs)

674
00:24:27,895 --> 00:24:29,897
Put that down.
Put that down. Put that down.

675
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:31,273
-Put that down. Put that down.
-Tina!

676
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:34,110
-Put that down! Get back here!
-(laughing)

677
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:36,612
Tina, stop! (grunting)

678
00:24:36,654 --> 00:24:38,739
CAROL:
What has gotten into you?

679
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:40,449
-Time for us to go!
-(grunts)

680
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:41,951
-What? Now?
-TED: Yeah.

681
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:44,829
-My helicopter's double-parked.
-Bye!

682
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,998
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So soon? -Oh, no.

683
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,125
-(both scream)
-(wind whistling)

684
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:52,003
-(helicopter whirring)
-(panting)

685
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:55,172
What... Did they really
just leave?

686
00:24:55,214 --> 00:24:56,298
Yep.

687
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,175
-Hide!
-(Ted and Tim whimpering)

688
00:24:58,217 --> 00:25:01,220
(groans)
I got to lose this baby fat.

689
00:25:01,262 --> 00:25:02,847
(Carol sighs)

690
00:25:02,888 --> 00:25:04,974
Tina! What is your problem?

691
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:07,143
(Tina laughing)

692
00:25:07,184 --> 00:25:09,228
* *

693
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,732
CAROL: Now, you're gonna
wake up tomorrow

694
00:25:12,773 --> 00:25:14,358
and be good, Tina.

695
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,693
No more devil baby.

696
00:25:15,735 --> 00:25:16,986
Deal?

697
00:25:17,028 --> 00:25:19,322
-(coos)
-Okay.

698
00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:23,367
(both gasping for air)

699
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:24,535
(both scream)

700
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:25,786
Ew.

701
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:27,246
(both scream)

702
00:25:27,288 --> 00:25:29,498
-(chiming) -Thanks so much
for coming in, ladies.

703
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,833
Would you like some fruit?

704
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:31,876
Mm. Ow!

705
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:32,877
What was... Hey!

706
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:34,462
Uh, can we get on with this?

707
00:25:34,503 --> 00:25:36,672
(grunts, groans)

708
00:25:36,714 --> 00:25:38,341
I miss my teeth.

709
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:40,384
I've decided who's going
on the mission.

710
00:25:40,426 --> 00:25:41,635
Thank you. I accept.

711
00:25:41,677 --> 00:25:42,720
Both of you.

712
00:25:42,762 --> 00:25:44,263
-Yes!
-No.

713
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:46,015
BabyCorp wants to get
the team back together, huh?

714
00:25:46,057 --> 00:25:47,141
(laughs):
No.

715
00:25:47,183 --> 00:25:48,517
They think that's
a terrible idea.

716
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,685
Of course they do.

717
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:51,520
Well, I'm the boss, applesauce.

718
00:25:51,562 --> 00:25:54,523
And I think you two are better
together than you are apart.

719
00:25:54,565 --> 00:25:57,818
Well, I work alone--
or at least not with him.

720
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,862
Hey. There's no "I" in "team."

721
00:25:59,904 --> 00:26:01,864
Actually, there's no "U"
in "team," either,

722
00:26:01,906 --> 00:26:04,075
-but there is an "M-E."
-T-E-A-M...

723
00:26:04,116 --> 00:26:06,035
But teamwork doesn't seem work.

724
00:26:06,077 --> 00:26:08,412
Ah. If you want something
done right, do it yourself.

725
00:26:08,454 --> 00:26:10,956
-We're all in it together.
-Every man for himself.

726
00:26:10,998 --> 00:26:12,708
One is the loneliest number.

727
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,585
-The ayes have it.
-We the people!

728
00:26:14,627 --> 00:26:16,462
Aha!

729
00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:19,048
Oh. So sorry.

730
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,466
(whispers):
Okay. Good night.

731
00:26:20,508 --> 00:26:21,884
Whew.

732
00:26:21,926 --> 00:26:24,011
Guess we'll just have to
melt down your big old statue

733
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:25,888
and turn it into
participation trophies.

734
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,723
Please, no,
don't hurt my statue.

735
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:30,810
Now, we have secret intel

736
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:35,940
that Dr. Armstrong leaves his
office every morning at 11:15.

737
00:26:35,982 --> 00:26:37,441
You need to sneak in there,

738
00:26:37,483 --> 00:26:39,694
plant these
surveillance devices,

739
00:26:39,735 --> 00:26:41,737
and report back to me.

740
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:42,863
Oh, man, this is so cool.

741
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,031
(echoing over speaker):
Testing.

742
00:26:44,073 --> 00:26:45,408
* Strangers in the night... *

743
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:47,910
Now, I've arranged
for a school bus

744
00:26:47,952 --> 00:26:50,246
to be here at 8:00 a.m. sharp!

745
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:51,872
-Thank you, Connie.
-CONNIE: Nighty night.

746
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:53,374
Do not be late.

747
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:54,625
Got it.

748
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,585
Easy-breezy, taco-peasy, boys.

749
00:26:56,627 --> 00:26:58,462
Let's get some sleep!

750
00:26:58,504 --> 00:27:00,423
(snoring)

751
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:06,637
(coos softly)

752

* *

753
00:27:20,318 --> 00:27:22,486
CAROL:
Hey, what's the matter?

754
00:27:23,988 --> 00:27:25,239
TABITHA:
It's nothing.

755
00:27:25,281 --> 00:27:26,615
CAROL:
Oh, sweetie, don't worry.

756
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:27,950
I'm sure your dad will be back

757
00:27:27,992 --> 00:27:29,618
in time to see you
in the pageant.

758
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,995
TABITHA:
That's okay.

759
00:27:31,037 --> 00:27:32,371
CAROL: What?
Don't you want him to come?

760
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:34,957
-TABITHA: I guess.
-CAROL: Of course you do.

761
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:36,917
Now, go back to sleep.

762
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,336
TABITHA:
Good night, Mom.

763
00:27:38,377 --> 00:27:40,671
CAROL:
Good night, sweetie.

764
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,222

00:28:00,024 --> 00:28:01,484

<i>Don't you want him to come?</i>

767
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:03,402
-TABITHA: <i>I guess.</i>
-(gasping)

00:28:03,444 --> 00:28:04,695
(screams)

769
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:07,073
Don't you think I'm
a little old for that now?

770
00:28:07,114 --> 00:28:09,825
I think it's time
we both grow up.

771

00:28:14,372 --> 00:28:16,916
The trial of
Timothy Leslie Templeton

774
00:28:16,957 --> 00:28:18,334
is now in session.

775
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:19,710
-Ha! Leslie.
-(laughter)

776
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:21,837
Trial? Wait, what...
what are the charges?

777
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,172
Fraud.

778
00:28:23,214 --> 00:28:25,841
Claiming to be
the world's best dad.

779
00:28:25,883 --> 00:28:27,301
-But I never said...
-Exhibit A.

780
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:29,512
-Oh, come on. That was a gift.
-(gallery gasping)

781
00:28:29,553 --> 00:28:32,556
I suggest you let
your attorney do the talking.

782
00:28:32,598 --> 00:28:34,725
(gasps) Oh, no.

783
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:37,269
Back in my day, you had to
earn one of these babies.

784
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:38,562
-Dad, what? I did not...
-(gallery gasping)

785
00:28:38,604 --> 00:28:41,357
His best friend was
an alarm clock.

786
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:42,149
Mom.

787
00:28:42,191 --> 00:28:44,819
(groans) He broke my arm.

788
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,362
No, I didn't!
It was my brother.

00:28:53,953 --> 00:28:55,287
Whoa!

-What?!
-Daylight can't be saved, Tim.

No, really?
What, are we going sailing?

This pony hates me. Oh!

It's not that
she hates you, Tim.

853
00:31:01,622 --> 00:31:03,165
She just doesn't respect you.

Don't we, girls?

We're, uh...

We're, uh, rebooting
our relationship

00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:02,094
Whoa! (laughs)

00:34:02,136 --> 00:34:04,180
(Tim panting)

954
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:07,975
AUTOMATED VOICE: You've arrived
at your destination.

955
00:34:08,017 --> 00:34:10,394
-And with a minute to spare.
-(distant explosion)

956
00:34:10,436 --> 00:34:13,147
Oh. Huh.

957
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:14,315
I'll send them a check.

958
00:34:14,357 --> 00:34:15,441
(both chuckling)

959
00:34:15,483 --> 00:34:16,734
Oh, that was fun.

960
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:18,194
You did it.

961
00:34:18,235 --> 00:34:19,528
We did it.

962
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,280
I guess we did.

963
00:34:21,322 --> 00:34:23,115
I was talking about
me and Precious.

964
00:34:23,157 --> 00:34:25,117
-Oh.
-Isn't that right, baby?

965
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,327
Yeah. Right.

966
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:28,120
-Get down!

967

(kids chattering)

969
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,346
Whoa.
This place even looks evil.

970
00:34:45,388 --> 00:34:47,306
TED:
It's just a school.

971
00:34:47,348 --> 00:34:49,058
You're overreacting.

972
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,309
And so is BabyCorp.

973
00:34:50,351 --> 00:34:51,602
No, I'm telling you,

974
00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:53,521
this school is stressing
Tabitha out.

975
00:34:53,562 --> 00:34:55,272
Tabitha can handle it.

976
00:34:55,314 --> 00:34:57,400
She's a real chip
off the old block.

977
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:59,402
-Wait, who's the block?
-I'm the block.

978
00:34:59,443 --> 00:35:01,237
Well, you can't be the block.
I'm the block.

979
00:35:01,278 --> 00:35:02,738
Then start acting like a block.

980
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,573
Wh-What does that mean?
I'm the block.

981
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:06,450
-I've always been the block.
-Yeah. Not even close.

982
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:07,910
TIM:
All I do is block.

983
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:09,495
I wake up in the morning,
I block.

984
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:11,372
-(kids grunting)
-I go to sleep, blocking.

985
00:35:11,414 --> 00:35:13,749
-I'm the block.
-Tim, enough.

986
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:16,335
-I'm the block.
-No, you're not! Stop it!

987
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:17,628
-Shh.
-(whistle blows)

988
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,005
(chuckles) Sweet.

989
00:35:19,046 --> 00:35:20,464
Suckers.

-AUTOMATED VOICE: Children only

No crying is permitted
in the separation zone.

992
00:35:25,553 --> 00:35:27,096
Okay, looks like
we got to split up.

993
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:28,556
Good. I could use a break.

994
00:35:28,597 --> 00:35:30,683
-TABITHA: Bye, Mom.
-All right, bye, honey.

995

(gasps, yells)
There's Tabitha.

996
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,645
-I'll see you after school.
-Okay.

997
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:36,731
(window squeaking)

998
00:35:37,523 --> 00:35:39,442
TED:
Apparently, there's no "A"

999
00:35:39,483 --> 00:35:41,652
in "teamwork," either.

1000
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:43,154
All right, let's boogie.

1001
00:35:43,195 --> 00:35:44,989
(grunts) Not so fast.

1002
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:47,533
I'm blue. You're yellow.

1003
00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:50,161
(laughing): You're over there
in the choo-choo.

1004
00:35:50,202 --> 00:35:51,787
(raucous laughter)

1005
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:54,248
Aw. It's full of babies.

1006
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,666
Is it? I didn't notice.

1007
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:58,127
(laughing):
Just kidding. It's hilarious.

1008
00:35:58,169 --> 00:35:59,754
Uh, wait. Your tie's crooked.

1009
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:01,213
-(fingers snap)
-Okay, Tim, focus.

1010
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:03,966
We'll meet outside
Armstrong's office at 11:15.

1011
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:05,968
We'll sneak in,
and we'll plant the bugs.

1012
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,136
Are you focused?

1013
00:36:07,178 --> 00:36:08,346
Hey, what the...

1014
00:36:08,387 --> 00:36:10,389
-Oh, I am focused, all right.
-No, no.

1015
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:11,724
I'm not yellow. I'm blue.

1016
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:13,809
11:30. Stick to the plan.

1017
00:36:13,851 --> 00:36:14,852
11:15.

1018
00:36:14,894 --> 00:36:16,854
15. Got it.
The block is focused.

1019
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:19,690
-I'm blue! Aah! I'm blue.
-(babies laughing)

1020
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,652
Don't you understand?
I'm blue!

1021
00:36:22,693 --> 00:36:24,654
ARMSTRONG (over speakers):
Welcome, children.

1022

And <i>buenos días.</i>

1026
00:36:30,576 --> 00:36:34,497
Thank you for choosing
to be excellent.

1027
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:36,040
-Please don't touch me.
-(babies laughing)

1028
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:38,417
This is some
ridiculous mistake.

1029
00:36:38,459 --> 00:36:39,919
I'm blue! I'm blue!

1030

-Yes.

1032
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:48,511
TIM:
Hello.

1033
00:36:48,552 --> 00:36:50,304
Uh, hello.

1034
00:36:50,346 --> 00:36:52,014
Nice plant.

1035
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:54,517
This is
my emotional support plant.

1036
00:36:54,558 --> 00:36:56,352
Hi. I-I'm new here.

Said nihonium to the other
elements in the periodic table.

-Ooh.
-(laughter)

1039
00:37:02,525 --> 00:37:04,026
Okay.

1040
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:05,695
Can't sit here.

1041
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:07,530
Or here. Or there.

1042
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:09,031
(yells)

1043
00:37:09,073 --> 00:37:12,827
Seating position is
determined by class rank.

1044
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:14,954
We can't possibly
include your data,

1045
00:37:14,996 --> 00:37:17,373
given that the rigor
of your previous school

1046
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:19,291
is an unknown variable.

1047
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,543
-STUDENTS: Ooh.
-(laughs)

1048
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:22,169
-Sick burn, Nathan.

1049
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:23,421
-(groans)
-Ow.

1050
00:37:23,462 --> 00:37:24,547
Here.

1051
00:37:24,588 --> 00:37:26,716
-You can take my seat.
-(sighs)

1052
00:37:26,757 --> 00:37:29,176
I'm so proud of you.

1053
00:37:29,218 --> 00:37:31,178
I mean... thanks.

1054
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,680
Okay...

1055
00:37:32,722 --> 00:37:34,223
(school bell rings)

1056
00:37:34,265 --> 00:37:35,558
ARMSTRONG:
Good morning.

1057
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,976
STUDENTS:
Good morning, Dr. Armstrong!

1058
00:37:37,018 --> 00:37:39,353
(chuckles)
Very warm welcome. Thank you.

1059
00:37:39,395 --> 00:37:40,688
Huh?

1060
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,732
As you can see,
we've got a new colleague

1061
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:44,525
joining us today.

1062
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,027
-Ooh.
-Hello.

1063
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:47,820
New colleague, why don't you
introduce yourself.

1064
00:37:47,862 --> 00:37:50,906
Uh, my name's Ti... um, Marcos.

1065
00:37:50,948 --> 00:37:53,326
-Hmm.
-Marcos Lightspeed.

1066
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:55,911
Marcos Lightspeed.

1067
00:37:55,953 --> 00:37:58,497
Yeah. Colorful, characterful,
and I like it.

1068
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:00,124
-In any case...
-(gasps)

1069
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:02,752
-...welcome, Marcos,
to Blue Unit. -(gasps)

1070
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:04,545
Our most advanced class.

1071
00:38:04,587 --> 00:38:07,381
Ooh, this is rarefied air

1072
00:38:07,423 --> 00:38:08,716
-we're breathing.
-(groans)

1073
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:10,634
Here at The Acorn Center,
we believe

1074
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:12,720
that all competition is...

1075
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:15,264
STUDENTS:
Healthy competition.

1076
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:17,725
(babies yelling, laughing)

1077
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:20,144
(noisemakers blaring)

1078
00:38:23,814 --> 00:38:27,193
I'm trapped
in the dum-dum holding tank.

1079
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:30,571
(gasps)
I'm having a panic attack.

1080
00:38:30,613 --> 00:38:32,990
There must be
a way out of here.

1081
00:38:35,993 --> 00:38:38,120
Something doesn't smell right.

1082
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:40,247
(sniffs) Blueberry.

1083
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:41,999
(laughing)

1084
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,210
(whispers):
I have to get out of here.

1085
00:38:44,251 --> 00:38:45,461
Hi.

1086
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:46,962
Don't look at me.

1087
00:38:47,004 --> 00:38:48,964
-Okay.
-(baby laughing)

1088
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:51,258
And our first subject
today is...

1089
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,386
No fractions, no fractions,
no fractions. Whoa!

1090
00:38:54,387 --> 00:38:56,138
Particle physics.

1091
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,306
Yes! What?

1092
00:38:57,348 --> 00:38:58,432
Yes! (laughs)

1093
00:38:58,474 --> 00:38:59,934
Who knows which scientist

1094
00:38:59,976 --> 00:39:02,186
first theorized
that the universe has a limit

1095
00:39:02,228 --> 00:39:04,897
beyond which
the laws of physics break down?

1096
00:39:04,939 --> 00:39:06,482
(students clamoring)

1097
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:08,234
Wow. Everybody seems to know.

1098
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:11,737
-(sighs, gasps)
-Señor Lightspeed.

1099
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:15,282
Um, Dr. Flam... baisley?

1100
00:39:15,324 --> 00:39:18,160
-(buzzer sounds)
-Oh, that's the wrong answer.

1101
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:20,997
His brain sure doesn't move
at light speed.

1102
00:39:21,038 --> 00:39:22,164
(laughter)

1103
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,791
-ARMSTRONG: Uh, okay.
-I know, right?

1104
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,668
-Anybody else?
-Right here.

1105
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,086
-Max Planck.
-(bell dings)

1106
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:28,587
ARMSTRONG:
That's correct.

1107
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:30,006
Tabitha has set the bar.

1108
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:31,716
First one on the board.
Ding, ding, ding.

1109
00:39:31,757 --> 00:39:33,843
Way to go, Tabitha.

1110
00:39:33,884 --> 00:39:36,345
You're going down, Templeton.

1111
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:37,805
Bring it on, Nathan.

1112
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:39,015
Yeah, Tabitha. Get him.

1113
00:39:39,056 --> 00:39:41,559
ARMSTRONG:
Next subject.

1114
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,185
Ancient Greek.

1115
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:46,022
-STUDENTS: Opa!
-Oprah! (chuckles)

1116
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:48,190
-(laughter, babbling)
-Attention.

1117
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:50,067
Attention, everyone.

1118
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:52,778
Who wants to play Shawshank?

1119
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,280
-No!
-BABIES: Huh?

1120
00:39:55,114 --> 00:39:58,284
Who wants to go outside
and play?

1121
00:39:58,326 --> 00:40:01,412
-(cheering)
-Does that sound fun? Good.

1122
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:03,372
Now, anybody have any ideas?

1123
00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:04,707
-BABY: No!
-Come on, people.

1124
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:05,833
Think, think, think,
think, think.

1125
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,084
We need to think
outside the box.

1126
00:40:07,126 --> 00:40:08,544
-Oh, oh, oh! Me, me! Oh!
-You, Bo-Peep.

1127
00:40:08,586 --> 00:40:11,630
We can build a hot-air balloon

1128
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:13,591
out of Popsicle sticks
and bubble gum!

1129
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:14,925
(laughing)

1130
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:16,635
And how would it fly?

1131
00:40:16,677 --> 00:40:18,554
-Pixie dust!
-(laughing, cheering)

1132
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:20,097
Get back in the box, Bo-Peep.

1133
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:22,391
-All the way in?
-All the way in.

1134
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:24,602
-Yay! -Ooh. Uh, can we get
in the box, too?

1135
00:40:24,644 --> 00:40:26,646
-Can we? Can we?
-BABY: Glue.

1136
00:40:26,687 --> 00:40:28,606
I like glue.

1137
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:29,815
Who doesn't?

1138
00:40:29,857 --> 00:40:31,275
But we're trying
to brainstorm here.

1139
00:40:31,317 --> 00:40:32,568
Glue's good.

1140
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,278
(laughing wildly)

1141
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,073
-Think, think, think, think,
think, think... -(groans)

1142
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:40,242
...think, think, think, think,
think, think, think, think!

1143
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:41,744
Bingo.

1144
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:43,079
Next subject.

1145
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,748
X is equal
to the derivative of...

1146
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,041
-NATHAN: Ooh, me!
-Itself.

1147
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,709
ARMSTRONG:
Kudos for Tabitha.

1148
00:40:48,751 --> 00:40:50,211
Wow. You knew that?

1149
00:40:50,252 --> 00:40:53,547
The world's leading producer
of bauxite is...

1150
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:55,049
-NATHAN: Oh!
-Australia.

1151
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:56,425
ARMSTRONG: Once again,
Tabitha's on the board.

1152
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:58,678
-Very good. -Yes, Tabitha!
-(applause)

1153
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:00,304
We got 15 minutes, people.

1154
00:41:00,346 --> 00:41:02,473
The difference
in "try" and "triumph"

1155
00:41:02,515 --> 00:41:04,266
is just a little oomph.

1156
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:07,395
-BABIES: Oomph!
-Go big or go home.

1157
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:09,021
Okay. Going home.

1158
00:41:09,063 --> 00:41:10,815
-Let's pick up the pace.
-No!

1159
00:41:10,856 --> 00:41:13,859
Hand downs, Norma Rae.
This is my time.

1160
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:16,028
To be, or not to be?
Tabitha.

1161
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,613
-To be. -That's correct.
-(bell dings)

1162
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:21,617
Can anyone tell me
the horsepower of a 302 engine?

1163
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:23,452
-Uh, seven?
-(buzzer sounds)

1164
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:25,204
-ARMSTRONG: Oh, boy.
-Weak sauce, Nathan.

1165
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:26,789
-That was weak.
-(groans)

1166
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:28,040
Tabitha, do you have
an idea about that?

1167
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:30,626
300 horsepower
with a four-barrel carb.

1168
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:31,919
-(bell dings) -TIM: Wow.
-(groans)

1169
00:41:31,961 --> 00:41:33,796
-Her dad must be a genius.
-(applause)

1170
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:36,340
On my signal, unleash heck.

1171
00:41:37,133 --> 00:41:39,260
-Fire!
-(babies grunt)

1172
00:41:40,261 --> 00:41:42,847
-(babies cheering)
-Yes!

1173
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:46,183
-I found a cure!
-(cheering)

1174
00:41:46,225 --> 00:41:47,977
-(bell dings)
-Yes! Yes! She did it!

1175
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,186
She did it.

1176
00:41:49,228 --> 00:41:50,813
-(students gasp)
-(buzzers sounding)

1177
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:52,481
STUDENTS:
Marcos!

1178
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:54,775
I did it. I did it.

1179
00:41:54,817 --> 00:41:56,652
(babies cheering)

1180
00:41:56,694 --> 00:42:00,573
Remember, your size doesn't
determine your strength.

1181
00:42:02,116 --> 00:42:04,493
Well, so far,
it's Tabitha number one

1182
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:05,995
and everybody else last.

1183
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:08,664
-(cheering, applause)
-(groans, sobs)

1184
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:11,292
* *

1185
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:16,714
Psst. Hey, Tabitha.

1186
00:42:16,756 --> 00:42:17,965
You're really...

1187
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:20,593
-A geek. I know.
-No.

1188
00:42:20,634 --> 00:42:22,511
You're amazing.

1189
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:24,847
Oh. Thanks, Marcos.

1190
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:28,351
You'll be singing
a different tune at rehearsal.

1191
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:30,436
The wrong tune.

1192
00:42:30,478 --> 00:42:31,646
(both laughing)

1193
00:42:31,687 --> 00:42:32,938
You're so funny.

1194
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,649
Hilarious!

1195
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:39,695
And yeah, Templeton,
don't be late.

1196
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:41,405
-(laughs)
-(gasps) Late.

1197
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:43,532
-I'm late.
-ARMSTRONG: Next subject.

1198
00:42:43,574 --> 00:42:44,742
Yes!

1199
00:42:44,784 --> 00:42:46,702
(straining):
Just a little further.

1200
00:42:46,744 --> 00:42:49,830
(babies giggling, babbling)

1201
00:42:49,872 --> 00:42:51,040
Glue!

1202
00:42:51,082 --> 00:42:52,875
(yells, screams)

1203
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:54,043
-TIM: Excuse me.
-(engine revving)

1204
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:55,336
Yes, Marcos.

1205
00:42:55,378 --> 00:42:58,172
Can I have a hall pass?
I have to go.

1206
00:42:58,214 --> 00:43:00,716
ARMSTRONG:
Voilà. Feel free.

1207
00:43:00,758 --> 00:43:02,385
(scoffs) Now what?

1208
00:43:02,426 --> 00:43:04,178
-(grunts) Now what?
-(babies crying)

1209
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,805
Glue!

1210
00:43:05,846 --> 00:43:07,682
Glue is bad!

1211
00:43:07,723 --> 00:43:09,392
(whimpering)

1212
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:10,559
Glue.

1213
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:13,020
(gasps)
Glue is good.

1214
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:16,399
How to get to
the principal's office.

1215
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,900
Of course.

1216
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:20,820
You get sent
to the principal's office.

1217
00:43:20,861 --> 00:43:22,989
("It's Tricky" by Run-D.M.C.

-Booyah!
-(students gasp)

What's up, y'all?

1226
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,844
School is...

1227
00:43:44,885 --> 00:43:46,387
-stupid.
-(students gasp)

1228
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:49,140
(staticky): Listen, you know,
I acknowledge your anger.

1229
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:51,934
It's, uh, very, uh, feisty,
but please sit down.

-Okay. Uh, no.
-(students gasp)

1231
00:43:54,687 --> 00:43:57,440
Sitting is... stupid!

-He's such a bad boy.
-STUDENTS: Ooh.

All right. I'm afraid you can't
disrupt class any longer.

1238
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,334
Oh, no. Are we gonna have
a talk in your office?

No.

00:45:18,187 --> 00:45:20,064
Please come in. <i>Entrez vous?</i>

1267
00:45:20,106 --> 00:45:21,524
You're here.

1268
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:23,067
Oh, yes. I...

1269
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:25,277
I was expecting you.

1270
00:45:26,112 --> 00:45:28,197
I... (grunts, yells)

1271
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:29,198
(button beeps)

1272
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,534
I expected that you

1273
00:45:31,575 --> 00:45:34,620
would be expecting me,
so there.

1274
00:45:34,662 --> 00:45:38,165
Oh, and, uh, by the way,
I know why you're here,

1275
00:45:38,207 --> 00:45:40,209
-so, uh... so there.
-(button beeps)

1276
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:43,045
(chuckles) You do?

1277
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:45,339
-Mm-hmm. Yes, I do.
-(button beeps)

1278
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:47,049
-(whirring)
-Have a seat, please.

1279
00:45:47,091 --> 00:45:48,467
(grunts) Thank you.

1280
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:50,177
-You know what you are?
-Mm?

1281
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:54,557
You are, if I may,
extremely intelligent.

1282
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:56,058
Go on. (grunts)

1283
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,685
Uh, as a matter of fact,
I've been observing you.

1284
00:45:57,727 --> 00:45:58,853
(button beeps)

1285
00:45:58,894 --> 00:46:00,813
Spends time wisely. Check.

1286
00:46:00,855 --> 00:46:03,482
Makes good use of
classroom materials. Check.

1287
00:46:03,524 --> 00:46:06,068
Keeps hands to self. Check.

1288
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,611
Hey, forget
"works well with others."

1289
00:46:07,653 --> 00:46:10,740
You make others
work well for you.

1290
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:14,160
That's literally the title
of the book I'm working on.

1291
00:46:14,201 --> 00:46:16,412
No kidding.
You had no business

1292
00:46:16,454 --> 00:46:18,539
being in Yellow Level, did you?

1293
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:20,916
-It was sabotage.
-Sabotage. Exactly.

1294
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:23,502
Jealousy, fear. Hey, I faced
the same obstacles.

1295
00:46:23,544 --> 00:46:27,131
In fact, you know,
you remind me a lot of myself

1296
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:29,592
when I was your age,

1297
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:32,428
which is now.

1298
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:33,888
(grunts)

1299
00:46:35,848 --> 00:46:36,932
What?

1300
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:38,267
(laughs)

1301
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:41,604
Surprise, surprise.

1302
00:46:41,646 --> 00:46:44,106
What the frittata?

1303
00:46:44,148 --> 00:46:45,232
Well put.

1304
00:46:45,274 --> 00:46:47,693
He's a ba... You're a baby.

1305
00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:50,279
I repeat, you're a baby.

1306
00:46:50,321 --> 00:46:52,782
So surprised,
you said it twice. (chuckles)

1307
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:54,283
(laughs)

1308
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:57,787
Unfortunately, people are, uh,
not ready for a...

1309
00:46:57,828 --> 00:47:00,039
a baby in a position of power.

1310
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:01,582
Yet.

1311
00:47:01,624 --> 00:47:04,293
Remind me to get the number
of your muttonchop guy.

1312
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:07,129
You know, I could use
somebody like you.

1313
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:11,092
With a superior intelligence
like my own.

1314
00:47:11,133 --> 00:47:13,803
-Uh... really?
-Mmm.

1315
00:47:13,844 --> 00:47:15,221
Somebody who can, uh...

1316
00:47:15,262 --> 00:47:17,390
Mmm. (crunching)

1317
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:18,808
-Mmm. Yeah.
-(gasps)

1318
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:21,560
Truly comprehend
what I'm trying to accomplish.

1319
00:47:21,602 --> 00:47:24,313
-Well, you're looking at him.
-Bingo.

1320
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:26,524
Mmm. We have a secret level.

1321
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:28,192
Mmm.
For very special babies.

1322
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:29,694
Mmm. The best of the best.

1323
00:47:29,735 --> 00:47:30,945
Ah. The elite.

1324
00:47:30,987 --> 00:47:31,988
Beyond blue?

1325
00:47:32,029 --> 00:47:34,031
Oh, yeah. Way beyond.

1326
00:47:34,073 --> 00:47:36,033
Way beyond. Ooh.

1327
00:47:36,075 --> 00:47:38,160
Mmm. There's a meeting today...

1328
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:39,912
(slurps)
...after school.

1329
00:47:39,954 --> 00:47:41,455
Babies only.

1330
00:47:41,497 --> 00:47:44,333
We may be small, but we're
about to teach grown-ups

1331
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,711
a big lesson.

1332
00:47:48,087 --> 00:47:50,006
Mmm. Lolly?

1333
00:47:50,047 --> 00:47:51,340
-Okay.
-(school bell ringing)

1334
00:47:51,382 --> 00:47:52,883
Oh. Time for recess.

1335
00:47:52,925 --> 00:47:54,385
-Bye-bye.
-(button beeps)

1336
00:47:55,094 --> 00:47:57,138
(singsongy):
Sayonara....

1337
00:47:57,179 --> 00:47:58,723
(groans)

1338
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:01,517
(grunts)

1339
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:03,769
Well, I think that went well.

1340
00:48:04,895 --> 00:48:06,689
-TED (recorded): You're a baby.
-TINA: What?

1341
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:08,733
-I repeat, you're a baby.
-(scoffs)

1342
00:48:08,774 --> 00:48:10,943
Is he talking to me?
He better not be talking to me,

1343
00:48:10,985 --> 00:48:12,445
because I'll... Armstrong?

1344
00:48:12,486 --> 00:48:14,196
(chuckles)
You're right, Connie.

1345
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:15,740
He's talking about Armstrong.

1346
00:48:15,781 --> 00:48:17,533
-I don't know what has
gotten into her. -(gasps)

1347
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:21,203
-But she's acting strange,
Dr. Federman. -(laughing)

1348
00:48:21,245 --> 00:48:23,456
Isn't it a bit early
for terrible twos?

1349
00:48:23,497 --> 00:48:25,333
Is there terrible ones?
Is that a thing?

1350
00:48:25,374 --> 00:48:26,876
Oh, piano-playing bunny,
you slay me.

1351
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:28,461
Okey dokey.

1352
00:48:28,502 --> 00:48:32,798
We need some eyes on the prize,
visual confirmation here.

1353
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,091
(snoring)

1354
00:48:34,133 --> 00:48:36,344
Oh, Daddy.

1355
00:48:36,385 --> 00:48:38,429
If I were there,
I'd pinch you so hard.

1356
00:48:38,471 --> 00:48:40,306
(sleepily):
* Sail away, sail away... *

1357
00:48:40,348 --> 00:48:42,141
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Your time-out has concluded.

1358
00:48:42,183 --> 00:48:44,060
Sail away! What time is it?

1359
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:45,770
AUTOMATED VOICE:
It is time for recess.

1360
00:48:45,811 --> 00:48:47,813
I'm late, I'm late,
I'm late, I'm late. Come on.

1361
00:48:47,855 --> 00:48:49,815
(chuckling):
He'll understand, right?

1362
00:48:49,857 --> 00:48:51,651
(gasps) Okay.
Where is he? Where is he?

1363
00:48:51,692 --> 00:48:55,029
-Where is he? Uh...
-(kids chattering, whooping)

1364
00:48:55,071 --> 00:48:56,989
-Oomph! Yeah, baby!
-(cheering)

1365
00:48:57,031 --> 00:48:58,574
No, not my bows.

1366
00:48:58,616 --> 00:49:01,952
-But they're not your bows...
anymore. -(sobbing)

1367
00:49:01,994 --> 00:49:04,955
Yep, where there's crying,
there's my brother.

1368
00:49:06,582 --> 00:49:09,752

BABY (whispers):
Psst. Here you go.

1370
00:49:12,004 --> 00:49:13,547
BABY 2:
Cool.

1371
00:49:14,298 --> 00:49:16,634
(grunting):
Glue. Glue. Glue.

1372
00:49:19,553 --> 00:49:21,305
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, blue.
-Whoa!

1373
00:49:21,347 --> 00:49:23,099
Where do you think
youse going? You lost?

1374
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,100
Could you let me through,
please?

1375
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:25,559
No!

1376
00:49:25,601 --> 00:49:28,270
So, what, did you flunk
coloring class, kid?

1377
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:29,897
-(laughter)
-Really, guy?

1378
00:49:30,856 --> 00:49:32,608
Mmm, cherry.

1379
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:33,609
Go on.

1380
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:34,986
-Blues on the other side.

Let him through.

1382
00:49:36,362 --> 00:49:37,446
Okay, he's cool.

1383
00:49:37,488 --> 00:49:38,864
TIM:
See? I'm cool.

1384
00:49:38,906 --> 00:49:40,116
I'm cool.

1385
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:41,951
You failed me, Tim.

1386
00:49:41,993 --> 00:49:43,411
I was desperate.

1387
00:49:43,452 --> 00:49:46,122
I crawled.
I did things with glue

1388
00:49:46,163 --> 00:49:48,541
that I'm not proud of,
but I made it.

1389
00:49:48,582 --> 00:49:50,501
I made it all the way
to Armstrong's office,

1390
00:49:50,543 --> 00:49:52,503
and then where's Tim?

1391
00:49:52,545 --> 00:49:53,713
-I know. I...
-Where's Tim?

1392
00:49:53,754 --> 00:49:55,464
-I tried to...
-Where's Tim?!

1393
00:49:55,506 --> 00:49:57,341
-I was in the Box, okay?
-(babies gasping)

-TED: The Box?
-The Box?

1395

Glue.

1396
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,012
Yeah, that's right.

1397
00:50:01,053 --> 00:50:02,263
(whispers):
The Box.

1398
00:50:02,305 --> 00:50:03,639
Show a little respect.

1399
00:50:03,681 --> 00:50:06,559
See, Tim, this is why
I work alone.

1400
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,145
-(sighs)
-I'll succeed in the mission.

1401
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:10,688
You can take the pony home.

1402
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:13,065
The only thing
you're ever gonna succeed at

1403
00:50:13,107 --> 00:50:14,108
is being alone.

1404
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,318
-Fine.
-Fine!

1405
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,819
Fine!

1406
00:50:16,861 --> 00:50:18,321
I like ponies.

1407
00:50:18,362 --> 00:50:20,698
Aah! Thank you for sharing.

You are blowing it, Templeton!

Yeah, Templeton.

I'm trying.

NATHAN: Ugh! You always
come in a beat late.

1414
00:50:34,628 --> 00:50:37,089
I'm sorry, Nathan.
I'm doing my best.

1415
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:41,010
Your best is going to keep me
out of going to Juilliard.

1416
00:50:41,052 --> 00:50:42,970
-Yeah, Templeton.
-It's one, two, three

1417
00:50:43,012 --> 00:50:45,389
-and one, two, three.
-MEGHAN: One, two, three.

1418
00:50:45,431 --> 00:50:46,891
NATHAN and MEGHAN:
And one, two, three

and one, two, three
and one, two, three.

Are you kidding me?

00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:56,025
I just can't do it
right now, okay?

1423
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:57,485
I can't. I just can't.

1424
00:50:57,526 --> 00:50:59,654
-I'll do it tomorrow.
-MEGHAN: Seriously?

1425
00:50:59,695 --> 00:51:01,530
-(school bell rings)
-(kids cheering)

1426
00:51:01,572 --> 00:51:03,783
NATHAN: All right,
all right, all right.

1427
00:51:03,824 --> 00:51:06,202
See you at the pageant
tomorrow.

1428
00:51:06,243 --> 00:51:08,162
Beat it!

1429
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:15,961
MEGHAN: Oh, Nathan,
Nathan, let me do it.

1430
00:51:16,003 --> 00:51:17,338
Let me do it, Nathan.

1431
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,881
I want to sing the song.

1432
00:51:18,923 --> 00:51:20,216
No.

1433
00:51:20,257 --> 00:51:22,176
I want to see her fail.

1434
00:51:22,218 --> 00:51:23,886
Oh.

1435
00:51:23,928 --> 00:51:25,513
Pure genius.

1436
00:51:25,554 --> 00:51:27,723
-(laughing)
-(plays ominous chords)

1437
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:29,392
NATHAN:
I can't wait.

1438
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:30,935
-We'll see about that.
-(school bell ringing)

1439
00:51:30,977 --> 00:51:32,895
ARMSTRONG (over speaker):
Goodbye, children.

1440
00:51:32,937 --> 00:51:34,063
Sayonara.

1441
00:51:34,105 --> 00:51:35,398
Auf Wiedersehen.

1442
00:51:35,439 --> 00:51:36,565
Adieu.

1443
00:51:36,607 --> 00:51:38,526
<i>Adios, niños.</i>

1444
00:51:38,567 --> 00:51:40,069

1447
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:44,573
Oh, come on.

00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:46,659

Oh, my gosh.

1451
00:51:51,622 --> 00:51:55,042
-Stop what you're doing.
-(chatter stops)

1452
00:51:55,084 --> 00:51:56,419
I see a baby pony.

1453
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,254
-(screaming)
-(excited chatter)

1454
00:51:58,295 --> 00:51:59,797
I like ponies.

1455
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,090
STUDENT:
Oh, over there!

1456
00:52:01,132 --> 00:52:02,258
-Yes!
-(laughter)

1457
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:04,427
It's so cute!

1458
00:52:04,468 --> 00:52:06,220

(horn honks)

1460
00:52:12,518 --> 00:52:14,312
That's it? No hello?

1461
00:52:14,353 --> 00:52:16,355
-Not even a "Hi, Mom"?
-What?

1462
00:52:16,397 --> 00:52:18,232
-Hi, Tabitha!
-(gasps)

1463
00:52:18,274 --> 00:52:20,151
-Oh. Hi.
-(Tina coughs)

1464
00:52:20,943 --> 00:52:22,528
What?
You never told me you had

1465
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,405
an older sister
who could drive.

1466
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,906
Uh, that's my mom.

1467
00:52:25,948 --> 00:52:27,658
Tabitha, don't interrupt.
(chuckles)

1468
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,744
-Yeah, I'm a new friend
of Tabitha's... -Hey, stop.

1469
00:52:29,785 --> 00:52:31,787
-(mumbling)
-Oh, really?

1470
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:33,622
I-I mean, we just met.

1471
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:34,665
Well, what's your name,
new friend?

1472
00:52:34,707 --> 00:52:36,751
Stop. You're embarrassing me.

1473
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:39,086
-Marcos. Marcos Lightspeed.
-(horse neighs)

-Ow!
-CAROL: Tina!

1476
00:52:41,881 --> 00:52:43,299
-What is with you?
-(Tim chuckles)

1477
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:44,759
Cute kid.

1478
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,719
Well, I better get going
if I'm gonna walk those

1479
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:49,305
three and a half miles home...

1480
00:52:49,347 --> 00:52:50,681
in the snow...

1481
00:52:50,723 --> 00:52:52,308
without a jacket.

1482
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:54,143
Three and a half miles?

1483
00:52:54,185 --> 00:52:56,979
Three and a half, six--
somewhere in there. (chuckles)

1484
00:52:57,021 --> 00:52:59,357
Yeah, well, that TV dinner
is not gonna microwave itself.

1485
00:52:59,398 --> 00:53:00,775
TV dinner?

1486
00:53:00,816 --> 00:53:03,152
Yeah, I'm a latchkey kid,
so I eat whatever I want.

1487
00:53:03,194 --> 00:53:05,196
-Cartoons are my babysitter.
-(tires screech)

1488
00:53:05,237 --> 00:53:06,405
-No.
-Oh, yeah.

1489
00:53:06,447 --> 00:53:08,407
(scoffs)

1490
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:11,702
* Strangers in the night *

1491
00:53:11,744 --> 00:53:14,205
* Exchanging glances *

1492

* Lovers... *

1493
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:16,999
What is this?

1494
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:19,335
Some kind of prank?

1495
00:53:19,377 --> 00:53:20,670
Children can be so cruel.

1496
00:53:20,711 --> 00:53:22,129
-Hello.

Whoa. This is exactly like
Bill Gates' rec room...

1504
00:53:41,273 --> 00:53:43,734
but a little smaller.

What is all this?

1508
00:53:55,413 --> 00:53:57,665
Research and development?

1509
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,210
Product testing?

1510
00:54:02,837 --> 00:54:07,299
Huh. Something tells me
this isn't day care.

1511
00:54:08,342 --> 00:54:11,220
Boy, could I use
a spy camera right about now.

Thank you. (sighs)

Pretty impressive.

What do you think?

I know tuition is pretty steep,

ARMSTRONG:
Oh, that's a good question.

1545

-I taught babies to code.
-No.

1546
00:55:20,456 --> 00:55:22,416
ARMSTRONG: Yes. And you know
what they say about having

1547
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:24,627
an infinite amount of monkeys
banging on typewriters?

1548
00:55:24,669 --> 00:55:26,504
They will eventually
write Shakespeare?

1549

A-plus.
Oh, boy, you are smart.

Forever.

So why bother with a school?

1562
00:55:52,113 --> 00:55:54,615
You could go public
and make millions.

1563

Oh. (laughs)

Yeah, but some things are
more important than money.

Please don't say "love."

Mmm. Power.

1582
00:56:34,697 --> 00:56:35,698
He kicked me off the mission.

1583
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,657
He can't do that.

1584
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:37,700
Only I can do that.

1585
00:56:37,742 --> 00:56:38,909
You're back on the mission.

1586
00:56:38,951 --> 00:56:40,369
No need.
I have my own mission now.

1587
00:56:40,411 --> 00:56:42,663
What? What could be more
important than my mission?

1588
00:56:42,705 --> 00:56:44,874
Got to go. Lightspeed out.

1589
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:47,543
This is so great.
(chuckles)

1590
00:56:47,585 --> 00:56:49,128
Well, I hope you're hungry.

1591
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,838
Been so long since I've
used silverware. (chuckles)

1592
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,341
So, how'd you like
your first day?

1593
00:56:53,382 --> 00:56:54,717
Kind of intense.

1594
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:56,719
(chuckles):
Yeah. You'll get used to it.

1595
00:56:56,761 --> 00:56:58,262
-Even that Nathan kid?
-Nathan.

1596
00:56:58,304 --> 00:57:00,514
-Ugh. He's a mess.
-(chuckles): Yeah.

1597
00:57:00,556 --> 00:57:02,725
-He is such a square.
-A square?

1598
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:04,727
Uh, yeah, you know,
like a dork.

1599
00:57:04,769 --> 00:57:06,646
Dweeb. Nerdlet.
A real poindexter.

1600
00:57:06,687 --> 00:57:08,189
Lame-o. Dorkus to the max.

1601
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,024
(chuckles)
They used to call me.

1602
00:57:10,066 --> 00:57:12,526
-(chuckles) You're weird.
-I am?

1603
00:57:12,568 --> 00:57:14,570
Yeah, but in a good way.

1604
00:57:14,612 --> 00:57:16,072
(both chuckle)

1605
00:57:16,113 --> 00:57:18,658
So, why is the pageant
stressing you out so much?

1606
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:20,785
(groans)
I have to sing.

1607
00:57:20,826 --> 00:57:22,995
-So what?
-I don't know.

1608
00:57:23,037 --> 00:57:25,373
My whole family is
going to be there,

1609
00:57:25,414 --> 00:57:27,541
including my dad.

1610
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:29,085
Oh.

1611
00:57:29,126 --> 00:57:30,503
Right.

1612
00:57:30,544 --> 00:57:32,588
You're embarrassed of him?

1613
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:34,674
No. No, it's not that.

1614
00:57:34,715 --> 00:57:36,217
(Tim sighs heavily)

1615
00:57:36,258 --> 00:57:38,010
It's just, he's really good
at this kind of thing--

1616
00:57:38,052 --> 00:57:41,806
being creative
and using your imagination--

1617
00:57:41,847 --> 00:57:43,849
but it's hard for me.

1618
00:57:43,891 --> 00:57:46,102
I just want him
to be proud of me.

1619
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:47,436
You know?

1620
00:57:47,478 --> 00:57:49,438
(coos)

1621
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,439
Really?

1622
00:57:50,481 --> 00:57:53,150
Well, yeah.

1623
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:56,278
Um, who are
these extra plates for?

1624
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,114
-(doorbell rings)
-(whispers): Mom and Dad.

1625
00:57:58,155 --> 00:58:00,032
Hey, hey!
The key still works!

1626
00:58:00,074 --> 00:58:01,575
You guys should really
change the locks.

1627
00:58:01,617 --> 00:58:03,160
-Oh, you made it.
-Look who's here!

1628
00:58:03,202 --> 00:58:03,953
Mom and Dad.

1629
00:58:03,995 --> 00:58:05,121
TABITHA:
Grandma! Grandpa!

1630
00:58:05,162 --> 00:58:06,914
-TED SR.: There she is.
-(gasps)

1631
00:58:06,956 --> 00:58:08,416
-Come here, my little
tabby cat. -Yay! You're here!

1632
00:58:08,457 --> 00:58:10,501
-Look at how big you are.
-You're almost a teenager.

1633
00:58:10,543 --> 00:58:11,919
Can you vote yet?

1634
00:58:11,961 --> 00:58:13,170
TABITHA: Ten and a half
more years, Grandma.

1635
00:58:13,212 --> 00:58:14,422
Daddy, they're gonna
recognize you.

1636
00:58:14,463 --> 00:58:15,589
No, no. It's fine.

1637
00:58:15,631 --> 00:58:17,508
I've got the glasses. See?

1638
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:18,968
-TED SR. and TABITHA: Selfie!
-How do you do it again?

1639
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:20,261
Bring out the baby.

1640
00:58:20,303 --> 00:58:21,846
-Hide!
-Where are you hiding that baby?

1641
00:58:21,887 --> 00:58:23,264
No. Just be cool. Be cool.

1642
00:58:23,306 --> 00:58:24,807
-JANICE: There she is.
-TED SR.: Hello.

1643
00:58:24,849 --> 00:58:26,058
TED SR.:
Hey, who's the new guy?

1644
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,977
-That's Marcos.
-I gotcha.

1645
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:31,230
(babies clamoring)

1646
00:58:31,272 --> 00:58:33,566
Attention, babies. <i>Bienvenue.</i>

1647
00:58:33,607 --> 00:58:35,318
<i>Willkommen.</i>

1648
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,694
<i>Dobro pozhalovat'.</i>

1649
00:58:36,736 --> 00:58:39,447
-And namaste.
-(clamoring continues)

1650
00:58:39,488 --> 00:58:41,407
Uh, babies.

1651
00:58:41,449 --> 00:58:42,742
Hey, hey.

1652
00:58:42,783 --> 00:58:44,201
-No more screen time.
-(clamoring stops)

1653
00:58:44,243 --> 00:58:46,579
-(whimpering)
-ARMSTRONG: Listen.

1654
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,874
Believe it or not,
I used to be just like you.

1655
00:58:49,915 --> 00:58:52,501
-(cooing)
-Yes. I even had parents.

1656
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:55,921
Mine were child psychologists

1657
00:58:55,963 --> 00:58:58,424
who made me part
of an experiment.

1658
00:58:58,466 --> 00:58:59,675
Really?

1659
00:58:59,717 --> 00:59:02,345
They exposed me to 10,000 hours

1660
00:59:02,386 --> 00:59:05,931
-of Mozart, language lessons
and public radio. -Huh. Wow.

1661
00:59:05,973 --> 00:59:07,725
I hate public radio.

1662
00:59:07,767 --> 00:59:11,270
It was at that point I realized
I was smarter than my parents.

1663
00:59:11,312 --> 00:59:15,274
And with my first step,
I ran away from home.

1664
00:59:15,316 --> 00:59:17,526
-(babies moan sadly)
-Why?

1665
00:59:17,568 --> 00:59:19,362
They pushed me around.

1666
00:59:19,403 --> 00:59:21,530
I got told what to do
all the time.

1667
00:59:21,572 --> 00:59:22,698
(crying)

1668
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:25,743
But a single word
changed my life.

1669
00:59:25,785 --> 00:59:27,370
"No." Say it.

1670
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:28,704
ALL:
No!

1671
00:59:28,746 --> 00:59:30,706
-Take a nap.
-Nyet!

1672
00:59:30,748 --> 00:59:32,625
-Put on your coat.
<i>-Nein!</i>

1673
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:35,002
-Eat your vegetables.
<i>-Nahii!</i>

1674
00:59:35,044 --> 00:59:37,296
Are you gonna let grown-ups
push you around?

1675
00:59:37,338 --> 00:59:39,674
No, no! No, no, no!
No, no! No, no, no!

1676
00:59:39,715 --> 00:59:41,050
-Are you?
-Good God, no.

1677
00:59:41,092 --> 00:59:42,385
That's right.

1678
00:59:42,426 --> 00:59:45,388
Why do parents get to be
in charge, anyway?

1679
00:59:45,429 --> 00:59:47,807
They had their chance,
and what did we get?

1680
00:59:47,848 --> 00:59:51,978
Pollution, politics, wars.

1681
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:54,355
BABIES:
Ooh.

1682
00:59:54,397 --> 00:59:56,399
Not "ooh." "Boo."

1683
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,025
ALL:
Boo!

1684
00:59:58,067 --> 01:00:01,404
The only thing holding us back
is them,

1685
01:00:01,445 --> 01:00:03,072
but not anymore.

1686
01:00:03,114 --> 01:00:06,993
The moment that we've worked
so hard for is almost here.

1687
01:00:07,034 --> 01:00:08,160
-B-Day.
-(babies cheering)

1688
01:00:08,202 --> 01:00:09,412
-B-Day?
-B-Day.

1689
01:00:09,453 --> 01:00:11,539
-I'm this many.
-I'm this many.

1690
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,916
No, no, it's not...
it's not your birthday.

1691
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:16,794
It's the beginning
of the baby revolution.

1692
01:00:16,836 --> 01:00:18,629
-Yay, yay.
-(babies cheering)

1693
01:00:18,671 --> 01:00:21,298
And there'll be cake.
Cake for everybody.

1694
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,093
BABIES (chanting): Cake! Cake!
Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake!

1695
01:00:24,135 --> 01:00:25,720
-No more rules.
-(chanting continues)

1696
01:00:25,761 --> 01:00:27,596
<i>Oh là là!</i>

1697
01:00:27,638 --> 01:00:29,348
No more parents.

1698
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,599
Uh-oh.

1699
01:00:30,641 --> 01:00:31,767
Pew, pew, pew, pew!

1700
01:00:31,809 --> 01:00:34,270
Sayonara, Mama and Papa!

1701
01:00:34,312 --> 01:00:36,314
-Oh, this is bad.
-(chuckles)

1702
01:00:36,355 --> 01:00:38,232
All right, pep rally's over.

1703
01:00:38,274 --> 01:00:40,651
Your-your parents
are gonna pick you up.

1704
01:00:40,693 --> 01:00:41,736
(crying)

1705
01:00:41,777 --> 01:00:43,279
This is my life's work.

1706
01:00:43,321 --> 01:00:46,240
Oh, yes, 17 long months.

1707
01:00:46,282 --> 01:00:48,868
To... no more parents.
(laughs)

1708
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:50,536
Mmm. (gargles, slurps)

1709
01:00:50,578 --> 01:00:52,997
Cheers to the revolution.

1710
01:00:53,956 --> 01:00:55,666
-No. Nope. Nope.
-(Tabitha chuckles)

1711
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:57,543
-No. Oh, that's a keeper.
-TABITHA: Oh, Tina.

1712
01:00:57,585 --> 01:00:59,670
Oh, it's so cute.
What's the app called?

1713
01:00:59,712 --> 01:01:01,130
-It's called QT Snap.
-Oh.

1714
01:01:01,172 --> 01:01:03,090
-Show me how to download that.
-Everyone has it.

1715
01:01:03,132 --> 01:01:05,134
So, Marcos... Lightspeed?

1716
01:01:05,176 --> 01:01:06,761
-Is that what you said?
-Mm-hmm.

1717
01:01:06,802 --> 01:01:08,596
Sounds like a cartoon name.

1718
01:01:08,638 --> 01:01:09,805
(laughing)

1719
01:01:09,847 --> 01:01:11,641
-It really does.
-(laughs awkwardly)

1720
01:01:11,682 --> 01:01:14,602
Well, my parents,
they're a little wacky, so...

1721
01:01:14,644 --> 01:01:16,228
(slurping)

1722
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:18,981
Huh. It's like I know you
from somewhere.

1723
01:01:19,023 --> 01:01:20,358
I don't think so.

1724
01:01:20,399 --> 01:01:22,026
-That is a keeper, too.
-Hey. Hey.

1725
01:01:22,068 --> 01:01:24,070
-Doesn't he look familiar?
-I don't think I do.

1726
01:01:24,111 --> 01:01:25,529
Yeah, he looks just like Tim.

1727
01:01:25,571 --> 01:01:27,156
Yeah. You look like Tim.

1728
01:01:27,198 --> 01:01:29,367
-(coughs)
-Hmm? -Huh?

1729
01:01:29,408 --> 01:01:30,910
Except Tim didn't wear glasses.

1730
01:01:30,951 --> 01:01:33,079
Oh, that's right.
(scoffs)

1731
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,581
Huh. Well, how about that.

1732
01:01:35,623 --> 01:01:38,167
-(Tina sighs)
-Hey, where is Tim, anyway?

1733
01:01:38,209 --> 01:01:40,002
Tim and Ted are on a trip.

1734
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:42,213
-TED SR. and JANICE: Together?
-They're bonding.

1735
01:01:42,254 --> 01:01:44,298
-Well, that's about time.
-Yeah.

1736
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,509
I just hope Tim's back
in time for the pageant.

1737
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:48,010
-(Janice scoffs)
-(Ted Sr. chuckles)

1738
01:01:48,052 --> 01:01:50,972
Uh, why...
why wouldn't he be there?

1739
01:01:51,013 --> 01:01:53,015
-(laughs) Tim Time.
-Tim Time.

1740
01:01:53,057 --> 01:01:54,058
-JANICE: Oh. (chuckles)
-(Carol laughs)

1741
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,184
What's-what's Tim Time?

1742
01:01:55,226 --> 01:01:56,686
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

1743
01:01:56,727 --> 01:02:00,648
Well, Marcos, Tim Time
is like a black hole

1744
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:05,111
where things like reality
and being on time get lost.

1745
01:02:05,152 --> 01:02:06,570
-(Tabitha laughs)
-Oh.

1746
01:02:06,612 --> 01:02:09,365
Tabitha's father has
a very active imagination.

1747
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,117
Which is a good thing.

1748
01:02:11,158 --> 01:02:12,827
Yeah, that's a...
I'd say that's a good thing.

1749
01:02:12,868 --> 01:02:16,205
Oh, remember when he said our
boss was trying to kidnap us?

1750
01:02:16,247 --> 01:02:17,748
-He did?
-(laughter)

1751
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:20,334
TED SR.: Or that his baby
brother could walk and talk

1752
01:02:20,376 --> 01:02:22,003
but only when
we weren't looking.

1753
01:02:22,044 --> 01:02:23,337
(laughter)

1754
01:02:23,379 --> 01:02:25,256
<i>("William Tell</i>Overture"
playing)

1755
01:02:25,297 --> 01:02:28,134
(chuckling):
Wow. Turn around.

1756
01:02:29,677 --> 01:02:31,345
TABITHA:
That's so Dad.

1757
01:02:31,387 --> 01:02:34,056
You know, Ted was
quite a handful himself.

1758
01:02:34,098 --> 01:02:36,392
-Oh, he could be very...
-TED SR.: Uptight.

1759
01:02:36,434 --> 01:02:38,185
JANICE:
Mm. Yes. High-strung.

1760
01:02:38,227 --> 01:02:40,604
Oh. Remember the time
he sued us?

1761
01:02:40,646 --> 01:02:43,357
-(laughter)
-JANICE: Teenagers. Ugh.

1762
01:02:43,399 --> 01:02:45,609
He really looked up
to his big brother, though.

1763
01:02:45,651 --> 01:02:47,778
-BOTH: He did?
-JANICE: Oh, yeah.

1764
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,613
He wouldn't leave him alone.

1765
01:02:49,655 --> 01:02:51,240
Everything Tim did,
Teddy wanted to do.

1766
01:02:51,282 --> 01:02:52,783
-TABITHA: Really?
-Yeah.

1767
01:02:52,825 --> 01:02:54,910
-Tagalong Teddy, we called him.
-(Tabitha chuckles)

1768
01:02:54,952 --> 01:02:57,079
-JANICE: Well, not to his face.
-TED SR.: No, no.

1769
01:02:57,121 --> 01:02:59,332
Not to his face.
He was very litigious.

1770
01:02:59,373 --> 01:03:01,584
But you know what?
Your dad didn't mind.

1771
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:03,627
He was so proud
of his little brother.

1772
01:03:03,669 --> 01:03:05,463
-Oh, yeah.
-He loved showing him off.

1773
01:03:05,504 --> 01:03:08,174
TED SR.: Those guys did
everything together.

1774
01:03:08,215 --> 01:03:10,259
JANICE:
They were best friends.

1775
01:03:10,301 --> 01:03:12,011
-Just like you and me.
-(Tina giggling)

1776
01:03:12,053 --> 01:03:13,763
Right, Tina?

1777
01:03:13,804 --> 01:03:15,097
Best friends forever.

1778
01:03:15,139 --> 01:03:16,432
-Tickle monster!
-(Carol chuckles)

1779
01:03:16,474 --> 01:03:18,601
CAROL:
That's so sweet.

1780
01:03:26,317 --> 01:03:27,777
TABITHA:
And this is my closet.

1781
01:03:27,818 --> 01:03:29,612
-TIM: Oh, cool closet.
-And this is my bed.

1782
01:03:29,654 --> 01:03:31,572
-And this is my fish.
-(tapping)

1783
01:03:31,614 --> 01:03:35,326
-Hey, want to see something
really, really cool? -Sure.

1784
01:03:36,327 --> 01:03:38,287
I made this vocalizer
for Dr. Hawking.

1785
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:40,081
Hey, my old...

1786
01:03:40,122 --> 01:03:42,041
-What did you do?!
-Check this out.

1787
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:44,210
Say hello, Dr. Hawking.

1788

ROBOTIC VOICE:
Hell-l-l-l-l...

1789
01:03:47,171 --> 01:03:50,800
(grunts)
Um, he has performance anxiety.

1790
01:03:50,841 --> 01:03:52,218
Mm-hmm. Yep.

1791
01:03:52,259 --> 01:03:53,886
Oh, this is Lamb Lamb.

1792
01:03:53,928 --> 01:03:55,429
Hey, Lamb Lamb.

1793
01:03:55,471 --> 01:03:58,140
That's my galaxy model
right up there on my shelf.

1794
01:03:58,182 --> 01:04:00,351
My scientist of the week award.

1795
01:04:00,393 --> 01:04:02,228
-Wow.
-My geode rock collection.

1796
01:04:02,269 --> 01:04:03,813
And my telescope.

1797
01:04:03,854 --> 01:04:04,981
Sweet.

1798
01:04:05,022 --> 01:04:07,316
-Hey, cool guitar.
-Yeah.

1799
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:08,359
That's my dad's.

1800
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:10,236
Cool dad. (grunts)

1801
01:04:10,277 --> 01:04:11,529
Are you okay?

1802
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,823
Yeah, I'm a lot taller
in my mind.

1803
01:04:13,864 --> 01:04:17,034
Hey, if you want,
I can help you with your song.

1804
01:04:17,076 --> 01:04:19,328
No, you can't.

1805
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:20,997
-Your ears will bleed.
-Oh, please.

1806
01:04:21,038 --> 01:04:22,665
It'll be fun.

1807
01:04:22,707 --> 01:04:25,251
How about this one?
It's a classic.

1808
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:27,336
(sighs)
Do we have to?

1809
01:04:27,378 --> 01:04:29,672
Come on. Let's try.

1810
01:04:30,673 --> 01:04:32,425
Okay.

1811
01:04:33,467 --> 01:04:35,052
It's not gonna be good, though.

1812
01:04:35,094 --> 01:04:36,220
No judgment.

1813
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:37,763
We're just having fun.

1814
01:04:37,805 --> 01:04:39,890
(playing gentle melody)

1815
01:04:42,727 --> 01:04:46,772

* There's no place like home *

1816
01:04:46,814 --> 01:04:48,941
* For the holidays *

1817

ROBOTIC VOICE:
Please stop.

1818
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:54,530
-No, stop. Aah...!

(stops playing)

1821
01:04:58,659 --> 01:05:00,369
Good... try.

1822
01:05:00,411 --> 01:05:03,039
Ugh! I just get so nervous.

1823
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,041
(chuckles):
That's okay.

1824
01:05:05,082 --> 01:05:07,543
Listen, all you got to do

1825
01:05:07,585 --> 01:05:10,546
is imagine that
you're inside the song.

1826
01:05:10,588 --> 01:05:14,383
Everything in the lyrics
is actually happening to you.

1827
01:05:14,425 --> 01:05:17,553
And you can see the notes.

1828
01:05:17,595 --> 01:05:20,514
(playing "If You Want
to Sing Out, Sing Out")

1829
01:05:22,433 --> 01:05:26,103
TIM: * Well, if you want

high, sing high * -(whimpering)

Wow. That was so great.

No, you were so great.

01:07:48,913 --> 01:07:49,914
Weird kid.

1893
01:07:49,955 --> 01:07:51,624
JANICE:
Yeah, I don't like him.

1894
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:54,001
(guitar playing softly)

1895
01:07:54,043 --> 01:07:56,629
* Catch my eye *

1896
01:07:57,421 --> 01:08:00,091
* Take my hand *

1897
01:08:00,925 --> 01:08:02,593
* This bond is tighter
than we *

1898
01:08:02,635 --> 01:08:04,303
You go get 'em, Tabitha.

1899
01:08:04,345 --> 01:08:06,472
* Ever planned *

1900
01:08:06,514 --> 01:08:09,350
* Give me courage *

1901
01:08:09,392 --> 01:08:10,977
* So I can land... *

1902
01:08:11,018 --> 01:08:12,561
TINA: <i>Pick up, pick up,</i>
<i>pick up, pick up,</i>

1903
01:08:12,603 --> 01:08:14,063
pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up,

1904
01:08:14,105 --> 01:08:16,232
pick up, pick up, pick up,
pick up. Choo-choo!

1905
01:08:16,273 --> 01:08:18,567
Don't they understand
it's the fate of the world?

1906
01:08:18,609 --> 01:08:20,653
I've been on hold forever!

1907
01:08:20,695 --> 01:08:22,738
CHILD: All operators
are currently napping.

1908
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:25,282
I've been on hold so long
I got a tooth growing in.

1909
01:08:25,324 --> 01:08:27,743
Back in my day, we wrote memos.

1910
01:08:27,785 --> 01:08:29,370
That's cute and old-timey.

1911
01:08:29,412 --> 01:08:30,705
(scoffs)

1912
01:08:30,746 --> 01:08:32,748
TED:
I weep for the future.

1913
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:35,251
Do you want to talk about your
feelings now while I'm on hold?

1914
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:36,419
I can give you 20 minutes.

1915
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,712
No.

1916
01:08:37,753 --> 01:08:39,338
Let's get to the nut,
the nugget.

1917
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,840
What are you afraid of?

1918
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:43,300
Sharks, getting shot
in the head with an arrow,

1919
01:08:43,342 --> 01:08:44,719
and... the IRS.

1920
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,262
-That's it.
-There you go.

1921
01:08:46,304 --> 01:08:47,763
Was that so hard?
Baby steps.

1922
01:08:47,805 --> 01:08:49,765
Now, what about being lonely?

1923
01:08:49,807 --> 01:08:51,642
-I'm not lonely.
-Mm-hmm.

1924
01:08:51,684 --> 01:08:54,103
I'm just... alone.

1925
01:08:54,145 --> 01:08:55,604
There's a difference.

1926
01:08:55,646 --> 01:08:57,273
-I think it's time
you read your file. -(gasps)

1927
01:08:57,315 --> 01:08:58,899
-Ah-ah-ah-ah.
-Just give me.

1928
01:08:58,941 --> 01:09:00,318
Whoa. This is it?

1929
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:02,820
It's so thin.

1930
01:09:02,862 --> 01:09:04,697
YOUNG TIM:
<i>Dear Boss Baby,</i>

1931
01:09:04,739 --> 01:09:06,324
<i>I promise you this:</i>

1932
01:09:06,365 --> 01:09:09,035
<i>Every morning when</i>
<i>you wake up, I will be there.</i>

1933
01:09:09,076 --> 01:09:11,787
<i>Every night at dinner,</i>
<i>I will be there.</i>

1934
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:14,206
<i>Every birthday party,</i>
<i>every Christmas morning,</i>

1935
01:09:14,248 --> 01:09:15,708
<i>I will be there.</i>

1936
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:19,128
<i>Year after year after year.</i>

1937
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:24,091
<i>And you and I</i>
<i>will always be brothers.</i>

1938
01:09:24,133 --> 01:09:26,010
<i>Always.</i>

1939
01:09:26,052 --> 01:09:28,804
Makes me want to make
a sad face.

1940
01:09:28,846 --> 01:09:31,057
(toy train whistle blows)

1941
01:09:33,559 --> 01:09:35,811
We were just kids.

1942
01:09:35,853 --> 01:09:38,397
We didn't know anything
about the real world.

1943
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:40,941
And eventually,
you have to grow up.

1944
01:09:40,983 --> 01:09:43,194
Just because you grow up,
it doesn't mean

1945
01:09:43,235 --> 01:09:44,737
you have to grow apart.

1946
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:47,406
I don't know.
Maybe it's already too late.

1947
01:09:47,448 --> 01:09:49,408
TIM (grunting):
Hey.

1948
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:50,660
Sorry I'm late.

1949
01:09:50,701 --> 01:09:52,244
TINA:
Daddy!

1950
01:09:52,286 --> 01:09:53,454
Daddy, Daddy.

1951
01:09:53,496 --> 01:09:54,705
What's going on?

1952
01:09:54,747 --> 01:09:56,207
Uncle Ted really misses you.

1953
01:09:56,248 --> 01:09:58,584
-Isn't that nice?
-(toy train whistle blows)

1954
01:10:01,379 --> 01:10:04,173
So, hey, uh, what you doing?

1955
01:10:04,215 --> 01:10:05,633
Oh, I was, uh...

1956
01:10:05,675 --> 01:10:08,886
I don't know,
I was just working on this.

1957
01:10:08,928 --> 01:10:10,721
(gasps)

1958
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:15,935
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said at recess.

1959
01:10:15,977 --> 01:10:18,562
What happens on the playground
stays on the playground.

1960
01:10:18,604 --> 01:10:20,481
I was just worried
about Tabitha, you know?

1961
01:10:20,523 --> 01:10:21,857
She's your daughter. I get it.

1962
01:10:21,899 --> 01:10:23,567
This whole time,
I was thinking about

1963
01:10:23,609 --> 01:10:25,945
what I wanted
and not what she needed.

1964
01:10:25,987 --> 01:10:28,114
I think I finally got this
parenting thing figured out.

1965
01:10:28,155 --> 01:10:29,281
Gold star for you, Daddy.

1966
01:10:29,323 --> 01:10:30,950
-Keep it up, Pops.
-Yeah, well, about that.

1967
01:10:30,992 --> 01:10:34,078
Armstrong wants to get rid
of parents somehow.

1968
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,414
-Sorry, what? -He's planning
a baby revolution.

1969
01:10:36,455 --> 01:10:37,957
Ugh, come on.

1970
01:10:37,999 --> 01:10:40,209
Just when I got good
at this whole parenting thing.

1971
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:41,711
We got to stop him.

1972
01:10:41,752 --> 01:10:43,295
-Not we.
-You?

1973
01:10:43,337 --> 01:10:44,672
Neither one of us.

1974
01:10:44,714 --> 01:10:46,340
-BabyCorp is taking it
from here. -Ah.

1975
01:10:46,382 --> 01:10:48,509
So, what, they're gonna send in
the Baby SEALS or something?

1976
01:10:48,551 --> 01:10:50,052
-Looks like it.
-So you'll, um...

1977
01:10:50,094 --> 01:10:52,430
you'll be headed back
to your office.

1978
01:10:52,471 --> 01:10:54,724
TED: Uh, yeah.
Well, keep in touch, Tim.

1979
01:10:54,765 --> 01:10:56,559
Hello? BabyCorp?

1980
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,561
Thank goodness, BabyCorp.
Well, BabyCo...

1981
01:10:58,602 --> 01:11:00,813
(stammering):
Wha-What? What are you saying,

1982
01:11:00,855 --> 01:11:02,815
there's not enough evidence,
BabyCorp? I...

1983
01:11:02,857 --> 01:11:04,650
-Uh-oh. -So you're not
gonna do anything?

1984
01:11:04,692 --> 01:11:06,068
But, BabyCorp, I...

1985
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:07,778
Ugh. Well, then
we'll take care of it.

1986
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,572
You know what, BabyCorp?

1987
01:11:09,613 --> 01:11:10,990
I quit!

1988
01:11:11,032 --> 01:11:13,117
What a bunch of
diaper sniffers. (grunts)

1989
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:14,869
(whistle blows,
train powers down)

1990
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:17,079
Looks like we have to stop
Armstrong ourselves.

1991
01:11:17,121 --> 01:11:19,665
We're going rogue.
I like it.

1992
01:11:19,707 --> 01:11:21,334
-So the mission's back on?
-Yeah.

1993
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:24,128
If you two can put up with
each other a little longer.

1994
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:27,423
I suppose I can live with that.
Tim?

1995
01:11:27,465 --> 01:11:28,424
I think that's doable.

1996
01:11:28,466 --> 01:11:29,425
Yay!

1997
01:11:29,467 --> 01:11:30,885
Forced together again.

1998
01:11:30,926 --> 01:11:33,679
WIZZIE:
It's 8:45 p.m.

1999
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:35,765
TED:
Okay. Our clock is ticking.

2000
01:11:35,806 --> 01:11:38,893
We have to stop Armstrong
before the formula wears off.

2001
01:11:38,934 --> 01:11:42,313
Working as a team,
we will strike at the pageant.

2002
01:11:42,355 --> 01:11:43,606
Go, Tina.

2003
01:11:43,648 --> 01:11:45,941
Now, this top secret
document...

2004
01:11:45,983 --> 01:11:47,443
Sweetie, it's the program.

2005
01:11:47,485 --> 01:11:49,779
This top secret program reveals

2006
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:52,782
that Armstrong is scheduled
to address the audience,

2007
01:11:52,823 --> 01:11:55,868
which he will do right here
at the very end.

2008
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:58,496
We need someone backstage.
Tim, that's you.

2009
01:11:58,537 --> 01:12:01,165
How am I gonna get backstage
if I'm not in the pageant?

2010
01:12:01,207 --> 01:12:03,042
TED: My people will
take care of that.

2011
01:12:03,084 --> 01:12:03,876
(toy squeaks)

2012
01:12:03,918 --> 01:12:05,294
-Ah!
-Thank you.

2013
01:12:05,336 --> 01:12:06,462
-(chuckles)
-Thank you.

2014
01:12:06,504 --> 01:12:07,546
-No!
-Great.

2015
01:12:07,588 --> 01:12:09,632
-And... go.
-(laughing)

2016
01:12:09,674 --> 01:12:11,092
Glue.

2017
01:12:11,133 --> 01:12:12,968
(screams)

2018
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:15,304
ROBOT VOICE:
There, there. All better.

2019
01:12:15,346 --> 01:12:16,931
Awesome.

2020
01:12:16,973 --> 01:12:20,393
Now, I'll be your eyes
and your ears in the audience.

2021
01:12:20,434 --> 01:12:22,311
I can't let Mommy see me talk,

2022
01:12:22,353 --> 01:12:24,230
or she's gonna start
squealing and hugging me,

2023
01:12:24,271 --> 01:12:25,982
but these little doodads
will let you

2024
01:12:26,023 --> 01:12:27,817
understand my baby talk.

2025
01:12:27,858 --> 01:12:29,485
It's called a GAGA device.

2026
01:12:29,527 --> 01:12:30,861
-Aw, that's cute.
-Check it out.

2027
01:12:30,903 --> 01:12:32,154
(speaks gibberish)

2028
01:12:32,196 --> 01:12:33,406
(over GAGA):
Can you hear me, Daddy?

2029
01:12:33,447 --> 01:12:34,657
Also cute.

2030
01:12:34,699 --> 01:12:36,742
Meanwhile,
with my new purple status,

2031
01:12:36,784 --> 01:12:38,786
<i>I can stay close to Armstrong.</i>

2032
01:12:38,828 --> 01:12:40,830
Um, that's-that's an eyebrow.

2033
01:12:40,871 --> 01:12:42,832
-Oh. Sorry.
-Uh, no, that's, uh...

2034
01:12:42,873 --> 01:12:44,583
TED:
<i>When the moment is right,</i>

2035
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:46,210
<i>I'll implant a device.</i>

2036
01:12:46,252 --> 01:12:47,712
-Got it.
-Got what?

2037
01:12:47,753 --> 01:12:48,921
I mean, you've got this.

2038
01:12:48,963 --> 01:12:50,965
Go get 'em, tiger.
(chuckles)

2039
01:12:51,007 --> 01:12:52,925
-Oh, thank you, parents.
-(applause)

2040
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:54,343
Thank you. There's the...

2041
01:12:54,385 --> 01:12:56,345
There's the old enthusiasm
I like to see.

2042
01:12:56,387 --> 01:12:58,723
TINA: <i>This will</i>
<i>allow me to control his suit.</i>

2043
01:12:58,764 --> 01:13:02,184
<i>I can make Muttonchops</i>
<i>do whatever I want.</i>

2044
01:13:02,226 --> 01:13:04,061
(babbling)

2045
01:13:04,103 --> 01:13:06,480
TINA:
<i>I can make him dance.</i>

2046
01:13:06,522 --> 01:13:08,190
<i>I can make him prance.</i>

2047
01:13:08,232 --> 01:13:10,026
-Hey, no, no, no, no.
<i>-Including exposing himself</i>

2048
01:13:10,067 --> 01:13:11,861
<i>-to the audience.</i>
-(audience gasps)

2049
01:13:11,902 --> 01:13:14,655
-(screams) <i>-Every parent</i>
<i>will pull out their phone.</i>

2050
01:13:14,697 --> 01:13:17,033
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me!

2051
01:13:17,074 --> 01:13:19,660
The photos will spread
like a diaper rash.

2052
01:13:19,702 --> 01:13:21,537
Cut to our pizza party.

2053
01:13:21,579 --> 01:13:23,497
Boom! Bam! Poo! Poof!

2054
01:13:23,539 --> 01:13:24,707
Questions?

2055
01:13:24,749 --> 01:13:25,916
After Tabitha sings
her solo, right?

2056
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:27,418
After Tabitha sings.

2057
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:31,088
Now we just sit back, relax
and enjoy the show.

2058
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,883
(fanfare playing)

2059
01:13:33,924 --> 01:13:36,385
ARMSTRONG: Welcome, parents,
to our holiday pageant.

2060
01:13:36,427 --> 01:13:39,889
Remember, flash photography
in the auditorium

2061
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:42,558
is absolutely okay.

2062
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,353
Take a picture. Show your kids
that you love 'em.

2063
01:13:45,394 --> 01:13:46,896
Yippee!

2064
01:13:46,937 --> 01:13:48,272
Come on, Tim.

2065
01:13:48,314 --> 01:13:50,566
-You promised you'd be here.
-(man groans)

2066
01:13:50,608 --> 01:13:52,068
Oh, sorry. This seat is taken.

2067
01:13:52,109 --> 01:13:54,028
-Yep. Sorry.
-Oh, no. (mutters)

2068
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:56,280
-So sorry. I... Sorry.
-(man grunts, mutters)

2069
01:13:56,322 --> 01:13:58,407
-Sorry! I am so sorry.
-(speaking gibberish)

2070
01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:00,743
(over GAGA): Uncle Teddy,
are you in position?

2071
01:14:00,785 --> 01:14:02,119
The baby's in the cradle.

2072
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:04,789
-The baby's in the cradle.
-Mmm. (slurping)

2073
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:06,415
(speaking gibberish)

2074
01:14:06,457 --> 01:14:08,417
(over GAGA):
Papa Bear, can you read me?

2075
01:14:08,459 --> 01:14:10,044
The flake has landed.

2076
01:14:10,086 --> 01:14:12,129
Places! Places, everybody!

2077
01:14:12,171 --> 01:14:13,506
-Here we go. Here we go.
-Oh, my gosh.

2078
01:14:13,547 --> 01:14:15,424
-It's starting. It's starting.
-(sighs) Finally.

2079
01:14:15,466 --> 01:14:17,009
It's starting. It's starting.

2080
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:18,302
Yay!

2081
01:14:18,344 --> 01:14:20,429
-You're a big pageant guy, huh?
-No, no, no.

2082
01:14:20,471 --> 01:14:22,974
I'm not talking about the show.
I'm talking about B-Day.

2083
01:14:23,808 --> 01:14:25,184
B-Day?

2084
01:14:25,226 --> 01:14:27,561
Oh, yeah. It's already
in the parents' phones.

2085
01:14:27,603 --> 01:14:29,313
(coughs)

2086
01:14:29,355 --> 01:14:31,107
I taught babies to code.

2087
01:14:31,148 --> 01:14:33,818
TED:
Apps. They're writing apps.

2088
01:14:33,859 --> 01:14:36,028
But my next app...

2089
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:39,615
ooh, it's gonna change
the world forever.

2090
01:14:39,657 --> 01:14:44,286
QT Snap is the app that's going
to change the world forever?

2091
01:14:44,328 --> 01:14:47,289
Forever starts today.
(chuckles)

2092
01:14:47,331 --> 01:14:49,333
Uh, cool. (gasps)

2093

-KIDS: * It's wintertime *

2097

2098
01:14:59,176 --> 01:15:01,053

2099
01:15:01,095 --> 01:15:03,139

2102

* Doomed. *

2105
01:15:13,065 --> 01:15:14,650
This is kind of dark.

2106
01:15:14,692 --> 01:15:15,985
Did the kids just say
we're doomed?

2107
01:15:16,027 --> 01:15:17,987
What the heck are we watching?

2108
01:15:18,029 --> 01:15:20,072
-(camera clicks)
-(yelps)

2109
01:15:20,114 --> 01:15:21,824
Their brains are
turning to mush.

2110
01:15:21,866 --> 01:15:23,367
Months of hypnotic research
embedded

2111
01:15:23,409 --> 01:15:26,203
in the most user-friendly
photo app ever made.

2112
01:15:26,245 --> 01:15:27,830
Ooh.

2113
01:15:27,872 --> 01:15:29,915
Now all we need to do
is sit back, relax

2114
01:15:29,957 --> 01:15:31,667
and enjoy the show.

-Right.

2116
01:15:33,085 --> 01:15:35,212

We're, uh...

-And Hanukkah!
-(screams)

2126
01:15:52,938 --> 01:15:54,231
Your son is so talented.

2127

-Oh, so is yours.
-Liars.

2128
01:15:56,567 --> 01:15:59,028
Tina, come in.
B-Day is happening now.

2129
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:00,571
It's all in the phones.

2130
01:16:00,613 --> 01:16:03,574
Armstrong is using an app
to brainwash the parents.

2131

Okay, okay. Uh, there's a...

2134
01:16:09,497 --> 01:16:11,999
there's a big old
no-touchy switch backstage.

(speaking gibberish)

2136

(over GAGA): Daddy,
we have to pull the plug.

2137
01:16:15,086 --> 01:16:17,296
Daddy, come in.
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,

2138
01:16:17,338 --> 01:16:18,714
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

2139
01:16:18,756 --> 01:16:20,675
Ugh. He's not responding.

2140
01:16:20,716 --> 01:16:22,009
(panting):
Of course not.

2141
01:16:22,051 --> 01:16:24,178
-I'll do it myself.
-Stop!

2142
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:27,056
-(grunts)
-Theater kids only.

2143
01:16:27,098 --> 01:16:29,392
Oh, come on, nativity!

2144
01:16:29,433 --> 01:16:30,768
Look holier!

Hey, Tabitha.

Don't you worry, okay?

2149
01:16:38,192 --> 01:16:40,069
You're gonna be great.

2150
01:16:40,111 --> 01:16:42,363
Thanks, Marcos.
And thanks for all your help.

2151
01:16:42,405 --> 01:16:43,489
Anytime.

2152
01:16:43,531 --> 01:16:45,574
I feel like you really
understand me.

2153
01:16:45,616 --> 01:16:47,243
I'm so excited.

2154
01:16:47,284 --> 01:16:51,038
I can't wait to see the look
on my dad's face when I sing.

2155

MEGHAN:
Hey! You're on, Templeton!

2156

Wish me luck.

2157
01:16:55,292 --> 01:16:56,669
MEGHAN:
And break a leg.

2158
01:16:56,711 --> 01:16:58,212
Or two, for that matter.

Tim!

2163

-What? No. Why?

Armstrong's turning
the parents into zombies

so they'll do
whatever he wants.

showing up for things
all of a sudden.

2179

What's that supposed to mean?

You didn't even come
to my graduation.

2181

Ow! Which one?

2182
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:44,050
Business school, law school.
None of them.

2183
01:17:44,091 --> 01:17:45,801
You didn't even come
to my wedding.

2184
01:17:45,843 --> 01:17:47,553
-Which one?
-I only had one!

2185
01:17:47,595 --> 01:17:49,221
We had a deal, Tim.

2186
01:17:49,263 --> 01:17:51,140
You promised
you'd be there always.

2187
01:17:51,182 --> 01:17:52,725
Whoa. Where did you...

2188
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,353
-Breach of contract!

Whoa.

-Whoa!

How do you do there, fellas?

2193
01:18:02,943 --> 01:18:05,863

Nothing's gonna ruin my B-Day.

2194

Not even you.

2195
01:18:08,491 --> 01:18:10,326
-Oh, busted.
-Yeah, it was obvious

2196
01:18:10,368 --> 01:18:11,952
from the very, very beginning

2197
01:18:11,994 --> 01:18:14,622
that you two were
working together.

2198
01:18:14,664 --> 01:18:16,040
What gave us away?

2199
01:18:16,082 --> 01:18:18,334
Well, I'd say the bickering,

2200
01:18:18,376 --> 01:18:20,169
the, uh, petty disputes,

2201
01:18:20,211 --> 01:18:21,837
the jealousy.

2202
01:18:21,879 --> 01:18:25,007
You know, you two are brothers
in every single way.

2203
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:26,717
(hums a tune)

2204
01:18:26,759 --> 01:18:29,011
-Off to the Box they go.
-(ninja babies yelling)

2205
01:18:29,053 --> 01:18:31,055
What? No.
Not the Box. Not now.

2206
01:18:31,097 --> 01:18:32,682
Please.

2207
01:18:32,723 --> 01:18:34,684
Aw, it's just... it's too bad
that you're never gonna

2208
01:18:34,725 --> 01:18:36,852
have a chance to reboot
your relationship and...

2209
01:18:36,894 --> 01:18:38,813
-No!
-...and restore the closeness

2210
01:18:38,854 --> 01:18:40,189
that you once felt.

2211
01:18:40,231 --> 01:18:41,857
-Sorry about that.
-No.

2212
01:18:41,899 --> 01:18:44,110
-No, no, no, no. No!
-Adios, Marcos.

2213
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:47,196
* Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh... *

2214
01:18:47,238 --> 01:18:49,073
CAROL:
Oh, look, look. There she is.

2215
01:18:49,115 --> 01:18:50,241
There's our little angel.

2216
01:18:50,282 --> 01:18:52,159
-Oh! Tabby's in the tree.
-Ah! Oh!

2217
01:18:53,661 --> 01:18:55,871
* Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh *

2218
01:18:55,913 --> 01:18:57,665
* Ooh-ooh-ooh... *

2219
01:18:57,707 --> 01:19:01,002
(ninja babies
speaking gibberish, laughing)

2220
01:19:01,043 --> 01:19:02,712
(yells)

2221
01:19:02,753 --> 01:19:05,089
You had one job to do.

2222
01:19:05,131 --> 01:19:07,091
One job.

2223
01:19:07,133 --> 01:19:09,093
-Oh, no.
-The fountain.

2224
01:19:09,135 --> 01:19:10,761
It's flooding the room.

2225
01:19:10,803 --> 01:19:12,138
This isn't a time-out.

2226
01:19:12,179 --> 01:19:13,556
It's game over.

2227
01:19:13,597 --> 01:19:15,641
* Ooh-ooh *

2228
01:19:15,683 --> 01:19:17,977
* Ooh-ooh-ooh *

2229
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:20,771
(panting)

2230
01:19:23,357 --> 01:19:24,734
MEGHAN:
Psst.

2231
01:19:24,775 --> 01:19:28,362
It's one, two, three
and one, two, three.

2232
01:19:28,404 --> 01:19:30,614
-(gasps, pants)
-(piano playing)

2233
01:19:39,749 --> 01:19:42,251
* Catch my eye *

2234
01:19:42,293 --> 01:19:45,421
* Take my hand *

2235
01:19:45,463 --> 01:19:50,760
* This bond is tighter
than we ever planned *

2236
01:19:50,801 --> 01:19:53,137
* Give me courage *

2237
01:19:53,179 --> 01:19:55,598
* So I can land *

2238
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:59,143
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

2239
01:19:59,185 --> 01:20:03,230
* So together we stand *

2240
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:07,151
* Laugh and cry with me *

2241
01:20:07,193 --> 01:20:09,820
* Fly that high with me *

2242
01:20:09,862 --> 01:20:11,989
-* See the sunset
and the sunrise * -(gasping)

2243
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,659
-* The world looks so good
through our eyes * -Wow.

2244
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:19,664
* Like the moon
and stars at night *

2245
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:23,334
You're right. I blew it.

2246
01:20:23,376 --> 01:20:25,461
I ruined the mission.
(sighs)

2247
01:20:25,503 --> 01:20:27,380
And I'm a terrible father.

2248
01:20:27,421 --> 01:20:30,383
Hey, you did sort of
ruin the mission.

2249
01:20:30,424 --> 01:20:32,009
But you're a great dad.

2250
01:20:32,051 --> 01:20:33,469
No, I'm not.

2251
01:20:33,511 --> 01:20:35,096
I could never do your job.

2252
01:20:35,137 --> 01:20:36,681
I mean, you work
around the clock,

2253
01:20:36,722 --> 01:20:38,391
you can't even quit
if you wanted to,

2254
01:20:38,432 --> 01:20:40,017
and you don't even get paid.

2255
01:20:40,059 --> 01:20:42,395
Frankly, I don't see
how that's legal.

2256
01:20:42,436 --> 01:20:44,563
I was always jealous of you.

2257
01:20:44,605 --> 01:20:47,024
I wanted to be successful,
too, you know.

2258
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:48,359
Sure, Tim.

2259
01:20:48,401 --> 01:20:50,736
I made a lot of money...

2260
01:20:50,778 --> 01:20:52,863
but you made a family.

2261
01:20:53,948 --> 01:20:55,992
The truth is...

2262
01:20:56,033 --> 01:20:57,952
it's lonely at the top.

2263
01:21:01,288 --> 01:21:04,000
* Reach with me *

2264
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:07,336
* See the sky *

2265
01:21:07,378 --> 01:21:12,091
* I'll always be here
for the rest of your life *

2266
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:15,094
* Sail that ocean *

2267
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,513
* Find that sand *

2268
01:21:17,555 --> 01:21:21,100
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

2269
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:25,146
* So together we stand *

2270
01:21:25,187 --> 01:21:27,398
(kids vocalizing)

2271
01:21:30,568 --> 01:21:34,488
You know, I'm... I'm sorry we
don't see each other anymore.

2272
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:36,532
A very wise person
once told me,

2273
01:21:36,574 --> 01:21:38,367
just because you grow up

2274
01:21:38,409 --> 01:21:40,369
doesn't mean
you have to grow apart.

2275
01:21:40,411 --> 01:21:41,912
-Was it Tina?
-Oh, yeah.

2276
01:21:41,954 --> 01:21:44,874
(laughing): Oh, it is crazy
how smart she is.

2277
01:21:44,915 --> 01:21:47,126
It's like she looks
right into your soul.

2278
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:50,046
I'm sorry that I missed
your graduations.

2279
01:21:50,087 --> 01:21:52,757
I'm sorry I missed
your one wedding.

2280
01:21:52,798 --> 01:21:56,052
BOTH: I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you.

2281
01:21:56,093 --> 01:21:58,971
* Side by side *

2282
01:21:59,013 --> 01:22:01,641
* Hand in hand *

2283
01:22:01,682 --> 01:22:06,520
* We speak a language
no one else can understand *

2284
01:22:06,562 --> 01:22:09,482
-* Hear those cheers *
-(cameras clicking)

2285
01:22:09,523 --> 01:22:11,776
* Strike up the band *

2286
01:22:11,817 --> 01:22:16,280
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

2287
01:22:16,322 --> 01:22:23,496
* So together we stand. *

2288
01:22:26,165 --> 01:22:27,333
(chuckles)

2289
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,418
(panting)

2290
01:22:33,047 --> 01:22:35,049
(pants, whimpers)

2291
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:37,468
(one person clapping)

2292
01:22:39,178 --> 01:22:41,806
(hyperventilating)

2293
01:22:41,847 --> 01:22:44,100
(crying)

2294
01:22:44,141 --> 01:22:46,143
Oh, Tabitha.

2295
01:22:46,185 --> 01:22:47,603
(gasps) Gramps?

2296
01:22:47,645 --> 01:22:49,313
Nana? Mom?

2297
01:22:49,355 --> 01:22:50,481
Oh, no!

2298
01:22:50,523 --> 01:22:52,400
-(grunts)
-Oh, my gosh, Tabitha.

2299
01:22:52,441 --> 01:22:54,276
You did such a great job.

2300
01:22:54,318 --> 01:22:57,530
Well, that's just
horribly rude of you all.

2301
01:22:57,571 --> 01:22:58,864
Come on, everybody.

2302
01:22:58,906 --> 01:23:02,743
Uh, how about
a standing ovation?

2303
01:23:02,785 --> 01:23:05,705
-(laughs) Very good.
-(Tina gasps)

2304
01:23:05,746 --> 01:23:07,331
They're zombies!

2305
01:23:07,373 --> 01:23:09,041
We did it!

2306
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:12,962
-The baby revolution has begun.
-(babies cheering, laughing)

2307
01:23:13,004 --> 01:23:15,297
No more need for costumes.

2308
01:23:15,339 --> 01:23:17,216
(yells, laughs)

2309
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,427
Who wants cake?

2310
01:23:20,344 --> 01:23:21,804
Oh, my gosh.

2311
01:23:21,846 --> 01:23:24,390
ARMSTRONG:
Happy B-Day, everybody.

2312
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:26,434
Daddy, Uncle Ted.

2313
01:23:26,475 --> 01:23:28,019
Come in. Where are you?

2314
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:30,354
(crying)

2315
01:23:31,981 --> 01:23:33,983
* *

2316
01:23:34,025 --> 01:23:36,319
(door opens, closes)

2317
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,362
(sniffles)

2318
01:23:38,404 --> 01:23:40,364
TINA:
Here you go, sis.

2319
01:23:40,406 --> 01:23:42,908
Now, I already used this,
so I know it's safe.

2320
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:44,702
Thanks.

2321
01:23:46,078 --> 01:23:48,622
Wait. Are you t-talking?

2322
01:23:48,664 --> 01:23:50,624
(chuckling): I know.
It's pretty weird, isn't it?

2323
01:23:50,666 --> 01:23:52,877
(screams)
Oh, my gosh, you're talking!

2324
01:23:52,918 --> 01:23:54,337
It's an emergency.

2325
01:23:54,378 --> 01:23:56,672
I'm on a supersecret mission
from BabyCorp.

2326
01:23:56,714 --> 01:23:57,673
(gasps)

2327
01:23:57,715 --> 01:24:00,092
You mean Dad's stories
are true?

2328
01:24:00,134 --> 01:24:02,011
That's what the suit says.

2329
01:24:02,053 --> 01:24:03,220
How do I look?

2330
01:24:03,262 --> 01:24:04,639
No way!

2331
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,682
Now, I can't get ahold
of Dad or Uncle Ted,

2332
01:24:06,724 --> 01:24:08,601
so I need your help, big sis.

2333
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:10,227
Wait, wait.
Dad's here?

2334
01:24:10,269 --> 01:24:11,729
They've been here
the whole time.

2335
01:24:11,771 --> 01:24:13,689
-Where? -I don't have
much time to explain,

2336
01:24:13,731 --> 01:24:16,067
but Dr. Armstrong is a baby.

2337
01:24:16,108 --> 01:24:18,027
A very bad, bad baby.

2338
01:24:18,069 --> 01:24:21,906
Soon, the world is
gonna be our playground.

2339
01:24:21,947 --> 01:24:24,367
-Whee! (grunts) -("Push It"
by Salt-N-Pepa playing)

2340
01:24:24,408 --> 01:24:25,743
(laughs)

2341
01:24:25,785 --> 01:24:28,120
Now we can make parents
do whatever we want.

2342
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:30,247
Awesome! Yeah!

2343
01:24:30,289 --> 01:24:33,209
No more rules.

2344
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,920
Sayonara, Mama and Papa.

2345
01:24:35,961 --> 01:24:37,254
Yeah.

2346
01:24:37,296 --> 01:24:38,381
(babies laughing)

2347
01:24:38,422 --> 01:24:39,715
-Mom?
-Dad?

2348
01:24:39,757 --> 01:24:40,716
Grandpa?

2349
01:24:40,758 --> 01:24:42,426
Whoa. Are you kidding me?

2350
01:24:42,468 --> 01:24:44,553
We need to shut it down
before it goes global.

2351
01:24:44,595 --> 01:24:46,722
-ARMSTRONG: Yeah. (laughs)
-What are we gonna do?

2352
01:24:46,764 --> 01:24:48,975
Okay, we need to find
the big whatchamacallit

2353
01:24:49,016 --> 01:24:50,601
that controls
the parents' phones.

2354
01:24:50,643 --> 01:24:52,144
-The server.
-Yes. Yes.

2355
01:24:52,186 --> 01:24:54,313
Is there a big one
of those whatsits at school?

2356
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:55,898
Uh, let's see.

2357
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:59,068
Well, servers get really hot,
so you need air ducts.

2358
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:00,403
TINA:
Now you're thinking!

2359
01:25:00,444 --> 01:25:02,613
TABITHA:
Which intersect at the acorn!

2360
01:25:02,655 --> 01:25:04,949
-A-plus!
-Come on.

2361
01:25:04,991 --> 01:25:06,409
-This way.

01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:08,661
Opportunity knocks.

2363
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:11,247
First, we need to make
a quick pit stop.

2364
01:25:11,288 --> 01:25:14,583
AUTOMATED VOICE (distorted):
Your time has concluded.

2365
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:16,752
-(both panting)
-It looks like this is it, Tim.

2366
01:25:16,794 --> 01:25:19,088
Well, hey, at least we have

2367
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:22,758
these last final
precious moments together.

2368
01:25:23,968 --> 01:25:26,178
Precious. Precious!

2380
01:26:02,256 --> 01:26:04,300
That's my girl.

2381
01:26:04,342 --> 01:26:05,468
Thank you.

(sputters, spits)

2383
01:26:07,511 --> 01:26:08,721
(gasps) Tina?

2384
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:10,139
Tina, Tina, come in.
It's Daddy.

2385
01:26:10,181 --> 01:26:12,516
Daddy! Listen, we have
to shut down the server.

2386
01:26:12,558 --> 01:26:14,310
-It's in the acorn.
-Whoa.

2387
01:26:14,352 --> 01:26:15,978
This is so weird.

2388
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:17,271
I call shotgun.

2389
01:26:17,313 --> 01:26:18,356

BOTH:
Yeehaw!

2392
01:26:22,693 --> 01:26:24,487
Hold on to your chaps, pal.

2393
01:26:24,528 --> 01:26:25,571

-Whoa!

2394
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:27,865

01:26:31,202 --> 01:26:33,204
-(screams)
-Oh, no!

2396
01:26:34,205 --> 01:26:36,332
Glue! (laughs)

2397
01:26:36,374 --> 01:26:38,834
Yah! Pixie dust! Aha.

2398

01:26:49,553 --> 01:26:51,722
CREEPY GIRL:
Where'd I go?

2405
01:26:52,556 --> 01:26:54,850

-ARMSTRONG (over radio): What?

2415
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:12,618
Ah, ah, ah. No, no, no.

2416
01:27:14,328 --> 01:27:16,414
(whirring)

2417
01:27:16,455 --> 01:27:19,667
Now let's crack that big nut.
(grunts)

2418
01:27:20,543 --> 01:27:22,837
Oh, no.
It's about to go worldwide.

2419
01:27:22,878 --> 01:27:25,089
How are we gonna get up there?

2420
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:27,800
-Really?
-ARMSTRONG: Well, you got grit.

2421
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:29,427
I'll give you that.

2422
01:27:29,468 --> 01:27:31,470
Gumption, even. Very admirable.

2423
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,639
And yet, uh, annoying.

2424
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:35,891
Quite annoying. Yeah.

2425
01:27:35,933 --> 01:27:38,477
I'm gonna have to,
you know, uh, stop you.

2426
01:27:38,519 --> 01:27:39,729
Glue me, glue me, glue me.

2427
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:41,272
Precious, sic him.

2428
01:27:41,314 --> 01:27:42,606
You're too little and too late.

-Ah, ba-bad dog.

2430
01:27:44,775 --> 01:27:48,070
-Pets aren't allowed in school.
-Aah! Precious!

2431
01:27:49,572 --> 01:27:51,240
And you, my pudgy protégé.

2432
01:27:51,282 --> 01:27:52,575
Go, go, go, go! Move! Move!

2433

-I offered you the world.
-(both yell)

2434
01:27:54,618 --> 01:27:56,037
-We could have been partners.
-(groaning)

2435
01:27:56,078 --> 01:27:57,913
I've got something better
than a partner.

2436
01:27:57,955 --> 01:27:59,999
-I have a brother.
-Yeah!

2437
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:02,209
-(grunts) Let go.
-No, you let go.

2438
01:28:02,251 --> 01:28:04,420
Wow. Point taken.

2439

What? What's going on?

01:28:07,298 --> 01:28:09,508
(yelling)

2441
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:10,760
Hey, that's my leisure suit.

2442
01:28:10,801 --> 01:28:12,178
It looks better on her.

2443
01:28:12,219 --> 01:28:13,679
Hands up, diapers down.

2444
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:15,097
Things are about to get weird.

2445
01:28:15,139 --> 01:28:16,807
-Yeah, that's my girls!
-(Ted laughs)

2446
01:28:16,849 --> 01:28:18,768
-That's really Dad?
-Yep.

2447
01:28:18,809 --> 01:28:20,978
I said a lot of stuff
to that kid.

2448
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:22,772
Well, quite the family reunion.

2449
01:28:22,813 --> 01:28:24,231
Uh, the more the merrier.

2450
01:28:24,273 --> 01:28:26,400
-I say let's call your parents.
-TIM: Oh, no.

2452
01:28:27,818 --> 01:28:29,612
-Uh-oh.
-Okay.

2453
01:28:29,654 --> 01:28:31,947
Mommy and Daddy,
let's hug 'em-- to death.

2454
01:28:31,989 --> 01:28:33,866
Oh, don't worry about us.
Get to the server.

2455
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:35,785
-Go, Tina, go!

-Hey!
-You got this, Tina.

2458
01:28:40,706 --> 01:28:42,041
Get down from there.

Here. Stick around.
Stick around.

2463
01:28:49,632 --> 01:28:52,009
Uh, Tim, what do we do now?!

2464
01:28:52,051 --> 01:28:53,970
Don't move.
Maybe they won't see us.

TED:
They see us, Tim. They see us.

-TED: Really, Tim?
-(grunting)

01:28:58,516 --> 01:29:00,309
Oh. Hey, that's a little
too high now.

2469
01:29:00,351 --> 01:29:03,145
Don't look down.
Look straight ahead, okay?

2470
01:29:03,187 --> 01:29:05,022
(grunts, whimpers)

2471

-(buzzer sounds)
-It's locked.

2472
01:29:06,732 --> 01:29:08,484
Can I give you a hand?

2473
01:29:08,526 --> 01:29:09,777
Of course,
I mean that facetiously,

2474
01:29:09,819 --> 01:29:12,488
because the hand acts as a...
as a key.

2475
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:13,823
No, no. No, no, no.

No, no, no! No!

Don't do that.

01:30:41,327 --> 01:30:42,787
-(gasps)
-I'm back!

2520
01:30:42,828 --> 01:30:44,288
-Here we go.
-Come on.

2521
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:46,415
How about another round,
you tough guy? Come on!

2522
01:30:46,457 --> 01:30:47,833
Ow. Stop it.

2523
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:49,251
I still got these.
(grunting)

2524
01:30:49,293 --> 01:30:50,920
TABITHA:
You put my sister down.

2525
01:30:50,961 --> 01:30:54,131
B-Day will happen,
whether you like it or not.

2526
01:30:54,173 --> 01:30:56,425
-You shall not pass!
-(zombielike murmuring)

2527
01:30:56,467 --> 01:30:58,344
Uh, you shall not pass.

2528
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:00,054
No! Stop passing.

2529
01:31:00,096 --> 01:31:01,764
-(grunts)
-(fire alarm ringing)

2530
01:31:01,806 --> 01:31:03,015
Yeah, Dad!

2531
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:04,475
Way to go! (whoops)

2532
01:31:04,517 --> 01:31:06,602
-(alarm stops)
-(Tabitha gasps)

2533
01:31:06,644 --> 01:31:08,187
TABITHA:
That's it?

2534
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:10,481
That's right. Why? What?
The school's expensive.

2535
01:31:10,523 --> 01:31:13,609
-I had to cut costs someplace.
-(both grunt)

2536
01:31:13,651 --> 01:31:14,777
Oh, no. It's not working.

2537
01:31:14,819 --> 01:31:15,945
Did you pull it right?

2538
01:31:15,987 --> 01:31:17,279
How else you gonna pull it?

2539
01:31:17,321 --> 01:31:19,323
ARMSTRONG (laughs):
You'll see I'm right.

2540
01:31:19,365 --> 01:31:20,950
I'll show everybody.

2541
01:31:20,992 --> 01:31:24,120
The age of parents is over.

2542
01:31:24,161 --> 01:31:26,580
(babies cooing, murmuring)

2543
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,460
ARMSTRONG:
Yay, yay, yay. (sighs)

2544
01:31:31,502 --> 01:31:34,130
How about you watch me
have a little toast?

2545
01:31:34,171 --> 01:31:37,425
To the baby revolution
and to me.

2546
01:31:37,466 --> 01:31:38,884
(gasps)

2547
01:31:41,012 --> 01:31:42,930
-It's time for the
candy volcano... -Mmm, mmm.

2548
01:31:42,972 --> 01:31:44,807
-Oh, that's good.
-TABITHA and TINA: Of doom!

2549
01:31:44,849 --> 01:31:46,809
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

2550
01:31:46,851 --> 01:31:48,311
No, no, no! No!

2551
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:50,813
(yells)
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2552
01:31:50,855 --> 01:31:52,481
-No, no, no.
-Boom shakalaka?

2553
01:31:52,523 --> 01:31:54,150
-Boom!
-Don't do that!

2554
01:31:54,191 --> 01:31:56,444
-(crackling, sizzling)

(grunts)

2560
01:32:05,202 --> 01:32:07,038
No! Someone help me, please!

2561
01:32:07,079 --> 01:32:08,998
Tabitha, hang on!

2562
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,334
Ted, I need upsies-- now.

2563

2565
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,508
Dad, help me!

2566
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:20,634
Look at you.

2567
01:32:20,676 --> 01:32:22,511
You're smart. You're strong.

2568
01:32:22,553 --> 01:32:23,846
You don't need parents.

2569
01:32:23,888 --> 01:32:25,890
What can they possibly
offer you?

2570
01:32:25,931 --> 01:32:28,351
-How about unconditional love?
-(gasps, yells)

2571
01:32:28,392 --> 01:32:30,102
-That's what.
-No, no, no. No.

2572
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:32,313
-Sayonara.
-No, no, no. No. (screams)

-(grunts)
-(Armstrong screams, whimpers)

2574
01:32:36,567 --> 01:32:37,902
TIM:
Tabitha!

2575
01:32:37,943 --> 01:32:39,695

2577
01:32:41,697 --> 01:32:43,324
-I'm gonna fall!
-Tabitha!

2578
01:32:43,366 --> 01:32:44,533
Hang on!

2579
01:32:44,575 --> 01:32:45,910
(screams)

2580
01:32:45,951 --> 01:32:48,245
I got you. I got you.

2581
01:32:48,287 --> 01:32:50,081
(both sigh)

2582
01:32:50,122 --> 01:32:52,333
I got you, Tabitha.

2583
01:32:52,375 --> 01:32:54,960
(panting)

2584
01:32:55,002 --> 01:32:56,921
I got you.

2585
01:32:56,962 --> 01:32:59,465
That's my big brother.

2586
01:33:00,257 --> 01:33:03,260
Thanks, Marcos Lightspeed.

2587
01:33:05,304 --> 01:33:06,931
Mwah.

2588
01:33:07,765 --> 01:33:09,767
I thought we both
had to grow up.

2589
01:33:09,809 --> 01:33:12,228
Well, let's not
grow up too fast.

2590
01:33:12,269 --> 01:33:13,729
(sighs)

2591
01:33:13,771 --> 01:33:15,147
I love you, Dad.

2592
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:17,066
I love you, Tabitha Templeton.

2593
01:33:17,108 --> 01:33:19,276
Aw. You see that?

2594
01:33:19,318 --> 01:33:21,570
And you wanted
to take it all away.

2595
01:33:21,612 --> 01:33:23,072
-Where you going?
-Home.

2596
01:33:23,114 --> 01:33:25,950
You know, Doc,
childhood doesn't last forever,

2597
01:33:25,992 --> 01:33:27,827
but family sure does.

2598
01:33:27,868 --> 01:33:29,578
Uncle Ted! Heads up!

2599
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:31,372
-(screams, grunts)
-Woo-hoo!

2600
01:33:31,414 --> 01:33:33,749
We win! Get ready
to order some pizzas.

Mommy, Daddy,
I missed you so much.

01:34:18,044 --> 01:34:20,421
Ooh, ooh, ooh. Yay!

2619
01:34:20,463 --> 01:34:21,630

So soft.

2622
01:34:25,593 --> 01:34:27,011
Where are we going?

2623
01:34:27,053 --> 01:34:28,304
Not bad, Templetons.

2624
01:34:28,346 --> 01:34:30,056
Woo-hoo! Yay, Templetons.

2625
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:31,557
Yeah, mission accomplished.

2626
01:34:31,599 --> 01:34:34,727
And as a bonus,
we stopped Armstrong, too.

2627
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:36,270
-Huh?
-What?

2628
01:34:36,312 --> 01:34:39,148
My real mission was
getting you two back together.

2629
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:41,984
-A-plus! See me after class.
-(Tabitha chuckles)

2630
01:34:42,026 --> 01:34:43,736
Wait, so you never
actually quit?

2631
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:44,987
-Nope.
-Huh.

2632
01:34:45,029 --> 01:34:46,155
Well played.

2633
01:34:46,197 --> 01:34:47,490
I don't like to mix the two,

2634
01:34:47,531 --> 01:34:49,033
but I will say
it was never business.

2635
01:34:49,075 --> 01:34:50,576
It was always personal.

2636
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:51,952
You know what, kid?

2637
01:34:51,994 --> 01:34:54,246
You're the best boss
I ever had.

-Teddy.
-Teddy, you're here.

2642

-And look what you're wearing.
-Uh...

2643
01:35:03,589 --> 01:35:05,508
Sweetheart, I cried.

2644
01:35:05,549 --> 01:35:06,676
Then I went blank.

2645
01:35:06,717 --> 01:35:08,469
Oh, come on.
Every-Everyone get together.

2646
01:35:08,511 --> 01:35:10,346
This... We got to get this.
Here we go.

01:35:15,977 --> 01:35:17,812
* Divided we'll fall *

2652

Oh, I wish Teddy
could have been here.
