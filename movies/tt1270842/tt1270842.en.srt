OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,482
Hey, give it.

3
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:38,514
Naoko and Kizuki had been close
almost from birth.

4
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:45,563
Because Kizuki was my best friend,
the three of us did things together.

5
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,634
I lost. I'll pay for the game.

6
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,847
After Kizuki died,

7
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:12,728
there was a vague knot of air inside me.

8
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,689
I wanted to get away
from this town.

9
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,734
I wanted to begin a new life
where I didn't know a soul,

10
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,819
and forget everything.

11
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,759
The chain reaction
of unrequited love

12
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:48,806
and its tragic consequences
is the core of the story of Andromache.

13
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,937
We want permission to use
the remaining time to debate this.

14
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,860
The world is drowning in problems
more profound than Greek tragedy.

15
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,782
I can't imagine anything is more
profound than Greek tragedy,

16
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,784
but suit yourselves.

17
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:16,750
For a while after I moved to Tokyo,
reading was all that mattered to me.

18
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,837
My life felt like it was on hold,

19
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,882
as empty as the margins
of the books I read so avidly.

20
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,935
That's 1 ,900 Yen.

21
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:48,866
Watanabe, it's already 6:30 am.

22
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,830
Instead of staying up all night reading,
why don't you go to bed early

23
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,999
and just get up and
exercise with me?

24
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,804
Nagasawa.

25
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,057
Is it true you've slept
with a hundred girls?

26
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,934
Don't exaggerate.

27
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,812
More like 70, at the most.

28
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,939
I've only slept with one.

29
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,068
Come with me next time.

30
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,908
Don't worry, it's easy.

31
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,953
I had a definite interest in
the strange, complex aspects

32
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,081
of Nagasawa's nature,
along with his sophistication.

33
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:43,879
Excuse me.

34
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,928
Life is too short.

35
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,014
Don't waste valuable time reading

36
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,017
any book that has not had
the baptism of time.

37
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,022
Shall we make a toast?

38
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,901
He was both a spirit
of amazing nobility

39
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,904
and an irredeemably materialistic man.

40
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,085
I... I was sitting over there.

41
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,007
What are you doing in Tokyo?

42
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,095
What am I doing?

43
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,103
Let's walk a little.

44
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,984
Have you been well?

45
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,155
You don't talk much.

46
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,118
I can't say what I want to say well.
Sorry.

47
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,122
Don't worry.
I don't talk much, either.

48
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,222
Where are we?

49
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,227
Komagome.
We made this big circle.

50
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,529
You're really tough.

51
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,574
Surprised?

52
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,658
Yeah.

53
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,705
Can I call you?
This Saturday?

54
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,582
Of course.

55
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,775
Every Sunday,
we met and walked,

56
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,611
walking with no destination
in mind.

57
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,698
As if walking were a religious ritual
to heal our wounded spirits.

58
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,745
We continued to avoid
any mention of the past.

59
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,541
Certainly, Kizuki's name

60
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,669
never came up
in our conversations.

61
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,664
Can I look?

62
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:35,832
You can look.

63
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,753
It's cute.

64
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,756
Ready?

65
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,843
Oh, sorry.
Wait just a minute.

66
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,770
OK?

67
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,854
Go ahead.

68
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,819
For you.

69
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,655
For me?

70
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,781
Right

71
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,659
Thank you.

72
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,826
You're welcome.

73
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,787
Can I open it?

74
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,705
Of course.

75
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,859
I don't know.
It's stupid being 20.

76
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:51,866
I'm just not ready.
It feels weird.

77
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,787
Like somebody's pushing me
from behind.

78
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:59,791
I've got seven months to get ready.
I'll take my time.

79
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,836
You're so lucky, still being 1 9.

80
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,842
I think that people

81
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,848
should just go back and forth
between 18 and 1 9.

82
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,937
Go to 1 9 when 1 8 is over,

83
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,859
and back to 1 8 when 1 9 is over.

84
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:35,869
That way...

85
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:42,000
..things would be easier...

86
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,082
Is this your first time?

87
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:32,248
You didn't sleep with Kizuki? Why?

88
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,333
I'm sorry.

89
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,337
I shouldn't have asked.

90
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:36,372
I'm sorry. I have to go.

91
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,295
Will you call me again?

92
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,470
When her apartment manager
told me Naoko had moved,

93
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,306
I was stunned.

94
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,477
I wrote her a long letter and
sent it to her home in Kobe.

95
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,313
Wherever she was,

96
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:46,359
I was certain they would
forward it to her.

97
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,403
On your birthday,

98
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:55,409
I probably should not
have done what I did.

99
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,496
What I felt for you

100
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:03,334
was something I never
experienced before.

101
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,514
I need you to answer me.

102
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:22,270
At least let me know

103
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,356
whether I've hurt you or not.

104
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,364
Watanabe.

105
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,534
Trim your nose hair.

106
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:22,413
It's really dirty.

107
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,582
You know we're late.

108
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,335
I know. So what?

109
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,422
Hurry up. You're such trouble.

110
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:39,472
Hatsumi had a pretty good idea
that Nagasawa was sleeping around.

111
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,433
But she never
complained to him.

112
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,353
She was seriously
in love with him,

113
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,439
but she never made any demands.

114
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,490
Want to find some girls tonight?

115
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,497
Sure, let's go get them.

116
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,505
What the hell was that?

117
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,590
Really?

118
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,513
Yes, the elbow is
the least sensitive part of the body.

119
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:24,517
Hm, is that so?

120
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:13,607
Do your best. See you someday.

121
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,215
Please forgive me for not
answering sooner.

122
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:44,180
It took me a very long time
to be in any condition to write.

123
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:49,185
For now, I am not
prepared to see you.

124
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,065
After I moved out of my apartment,

125
00:28:55,150 --> 00:29:00,196
I came back to my family's house
in Kobe and saw a doctor for a while.

126
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,157
He tells me

127
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:08,204
there is a place in the hills outside
Kyoto that would be perfect for me,

128
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:12,291
and I'm thinking of spending
a little time there.

129
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,296
I feel grateful in my own way

130
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,174
for the companionship you gave me.

131
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,260
Please believe that much.

132
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,264
You are not the one
who hurt me.

133
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:34,146
I myself am the one who did that.
This is how I truly feel.

134
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,346
- You're Watanabe, right?
- Yeah.

135
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,350
Mind if I sit down?
Are you expecting someone?

136
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,311
Nobody's coming, please.

137
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,286
Have we met?

138
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,246
Euripides.

139
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,456
We just finished class, right?

140
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:49,263
Was your hair down to here
before summer break?

141
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,308
But over the summer...

142
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,440
Let me see your profile.

143
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,362
It looks good on you.

144
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,198
You really think so?

145
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,283
Yeah.

146
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:19,293
Hey, you're not a liar, are you?

147
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,338
I like to think of myself as honest.

148
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,309
Are you suntanned?

149
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:39,438
I spent the last couple of weeks
hiking around.

150
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,398
Alone?

151
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,275
Alone.

152
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,320
Do you always travel alone?

153
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,364
Yes, I do.

154
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,366
You enjoy solitude?

155
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,410
Nobody likes being alone that much.

156
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,330
I just don't go out of my way
to make friends.

157
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,291
It just leads to disappointment.

158
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:03,295
You can use that line if you
ever write your autobiography.

159
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,467
Are you teasing?

160
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,472
I love the way you talk.

161
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,391
My name's Midori.

162
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,314
Take your sunglasses off.

163
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,441
My eyes are tired today.

164
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,276
Lack of sleep?

165
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,361
A little.

166
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,572
Sorry I forgot about our lunch.

167
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,368
Did you wait there long?

168
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,579
It doesn't matter
I've got time on my hands.

169
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,332
A lot?

170
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,460
I wish I could give you some
to help you sleep.

171
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,422
That's sweet.

172
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,392
Come in!

173
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,519
Hello.

174
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,480
Welcome.

175
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,607
Hello. For you.

176
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,443
Thank you.

177
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,364
I'll water it.

178
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,410
Am I too early?

179
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,579
It's fine.

180
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,499
Hey, you have a bookshop downstairs.

181
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,462
It's been our bookshop
for thousands of years.

182
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,355
I'm glad you're enjoying
my cooking.

183
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,607
This is great.

184
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:51,570
You weren't expecting
much, were you,

185
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,615
judging from my looks?

186
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,286
So, your family's out today?

187
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,537
My mother's in her grave.

188
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,334
My sister's out driving
with her fiancé.

189
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,461
And then there's my father.

190
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,382
He went to Uruguay
in June of last year.

191
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,344
- Uruguay?
- Yes.

192
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:20,307
An old army buddy of his
has a farm there.

193
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:25,395
Suddenly he said he could make it there
and took off alone to Uruguay.

194
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:27,397
I see.

195
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:34,404
I'm sure losing his wife
was a real shock to him.

196
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:40,619
He told us, "I'm so angry.

197
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,584
"I would much rather have
lost the two of you than her."

198
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,379
He did?

199
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,507
We were stupefied, speechless.

200
00:34:54,425 --> 00:35:00,472
Still, it is wonderful for two people
to love each other that much.

201
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,601
Have you heard from him?

202
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,481
One postcard, in March.

203
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,442
But he didn't tell us much.

204
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,528
A postcard of a stupid donkey.

205
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,573
Give me a break!

206
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,632
I always thought, of course I'd be sad
if my parents died or went away.

207
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,469
But when it happened,
I felt nothing.

208
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:45,434
I don't feel sad or feel abandoned
or in any pain.

209
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,521
Do you think you weren't
loved very much?

210
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,523
Not enough.

211
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,569
Just once, I wanted to know
what it's like to get my fill of love.

212
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,448
What is love to you?

213
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:09,499
Let's say, I tell you I want to eat
strawberry shortcake,

214
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,586
and you drop everything
and run out and buy it for me.

215
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,548
And you come back out of breath and
give me the strawberry shortcake.

216
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:21,428
And I say,
"I don't want it any more,"

217
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,513
and I throw it out the window.

218
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,642
That's what I'm looking for.

219
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:31,605
I'm not sure that has anything
to do with love.

220
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,523
It does.

221
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,526
I want the man to say,

222
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,695
"You're right, Midori. It's my fault."

223
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,699
I have all the intelligence and
sensitivity of a donkey.

224
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,619
To apologise,
I'll get you something else.

225
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:50,624
What would you like?
Chocolate mousse? Cheesecake?

226
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,542
Then what?

227
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,544
Then I'll love him.

228
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:14,564
- Tired?
- It's not that.

229
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:19,653
It's just been a while
since I let myself relax completely.

230
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,620
I'm dating someone else.

231
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,751
Somehow, I knew that.

232
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,718
Do you love someone?

233
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,728
I do.

234
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:24,838
My doctor says it's time I began
having contact with people.

235
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:29,843
The only face I see is yours.

236
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:49,696
And there are some things that
I need to explain to you.

237
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,782
I can no longer avoid them.

238
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,786
It's almost four months
since I came here.

239
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,999
I've thought a lot about you
in that time.

240
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:11,885
I can sense the good feelings
you have for me.

241
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,804
They make me very happy.

242
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,808
If I have left a wound
inside you,

243
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:23,980
it is not just your wound
but mine as well.

244
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:28,735
If you stay on this road,

245
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,695
Dr Ishida will greet you.

246
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,864
Yes, I see. Thank you.

247
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,938
You must be Watanabe.
Call me Reiko.

248
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,817
Hello. Are you Naoko's doctor?

249
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,778
Naoko's doctor? Why?

250
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,864
He told me Dr Ishida
would greet me.

251
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,825
Oh, I see.

252
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,870
I teach music here,

253
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,873
so some people call me "Doctor".

254
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,920
But I'm just another patient here.
I've been here seven years.

255
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:40,974
Come in.

256
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,820
What a nice room.

257
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,907
My dorm room only has
a ceiling and a window.

258
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,911
I see. You sleep there, OK?

259
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:02,996
Of course.

260
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:08,001
Naoko and I have to work in the garden.
Do you mind waiting here?

261
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,878
Not at all.

262
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,924
I'll study my German
I have an exam next week.

263
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:22,849
Also, you're not allowed
to be alone with Naoko here.

264
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,977
You always have to be
with a chaperone.

265
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,937
That would be me.

266
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,899
You'll just have to put up with it.

267
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,025
That's fine.

268
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,863
I'll be off.

269
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,947
Sure.

270
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:02,972
- Good.
- Yeah, this peach is good.

271
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:09,020
When I said good,
I meant how you eat the peach.

272
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,105
What?

273
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,080
Sleeping?

274
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,040
No...

275
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,006
How are you?

276
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,096
I don't have much time.

277
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:48,143
I'm not supposed to be here,
but I snuck over.

278
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:55,108
Don't you hate my hair?

279
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,194
Not at all.

280
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,074
It's really cute.

281
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,080
But my mother
said it was awful.

282
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:19,132
I just had to see you.

283
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:25,054
I don't have anything
special to say,

284
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:31,102
but I wanted to get used
to seeing your face.

285
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:37,150
How long were you here?

286
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:07,096
Thank you so much for coming to see me
It makes me very happy.

287
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:14,187
But if being here becomes
a burden to you,

288
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,232
you shouldn't hesitate to tell me.

289
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,194
I won't be crushed.

290
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,242
I'll tell you honestly.

291
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,135
I have to go.

292
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:11,364
Watanabe, do you mind taking
a little walk?

293
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,597
Do you love me?

294
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,644
Yes.

295
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,525
I love you a lot.

296
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:03,632
Get up. I want to talk.

297
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:38,667
You asked me once why
I had never slept with Kizuki.

298
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,670
Do you still want to know?

299
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,718
I probably should know.

300
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,762
I think so, too.

301
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,640
The dead will always be dead,

302
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:55,768
but we have to go on living.

303
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:02,775
I wanted to sleep with Kizuki.

304
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,695
And he wanted to, too.

305
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,699
So we tried a lot.
But it never worked.

306
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,743
We couldn't do it.

307
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:17,832
I didn't know why then
and I still don't know why.

308
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:20,709
I loved him.

309
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:24,713
But it never worked.

310
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:31,804
I couldn't get wet.
I never opened to him.

311
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,807
It hurt too much.

312
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,771
We tried everything,
but it never worked.

313
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:43,816
So I...

314
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,819
used my lips

315
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,907
and my fingers for him.

316
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,744
I wish

317
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,832
I didn't have to talk about this.

318
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:06,755
But I can't help it,
I have to talk about it.

319
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,760
I can't figure this out alone.

320
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,807
When I slept with you,

321
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,854
I was really wet, wasn't I?

322
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:23,814
Yes.

323
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:30,863
That evening of my birthday,

324
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,866
I'd been wet since I saw you.

325
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,952
I wanted you to hold me.

326
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:41,790
I wanted you to take off my clothes
and touch me.

327
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:46,795
I'd never felt like that before.

328
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:55,888
Why?

329
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,975
How could that happen?

330
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,896
I mean,

331
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:08,776
I really loved Kizuki.

332
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:14,907
You mean, but not me?

333
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,910
I'm sorry.

334
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,829
But please understand,

335
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:28,837
Kizuki and I had
a truly special relationship.

336
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:34,969
We had

337
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,014
always been together,
from the age of three.

338
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:45,896
We talked about everything
and understood each other.

339
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,941
That's how we grew up.

340
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:56,031
The first time we kissed,
we were in sixth grade.

341
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,035
It was wonderful.

342
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:06,000
When I had my first period,

343
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,962
I ran to him and
cried like a baby.

344
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:13,966
We were that close.

345
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,015
After he died,

346
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:29,898
I just didn't know

347
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,860
how to relate to other people.

348
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,947
I didn't even know

349
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:40,117
what it means

350
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,912
to love someone.

351
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,967
Naoko!

352
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,988
Time to confess.

353
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:03,117
What were you two doing?

354
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,206
Going out at that hour,
coming back nearly naked.

355
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,130
I can't tell you.

356
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,970
We did it.

357
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,974
But it didn't work.

358
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,185
What do you mean?

359
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:37,025
Watanabe was too big for me.

360
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,197
He didn't fit inside me.

361
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:46,952
It's been seven years since
the last time,

362
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,163
so I was all stuffed up.

363
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:01,091
That was the dream
Reiko had,

364
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:04,178
the night before you came.

365
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,181
You dreamed about me?

366
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:12,060
It wasn't you,
it was just some man.

367
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:20,152
Don't forget,
we're not normal here.

368
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,238
Apparently not.

369
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,118
Do you want to sleep
with me?

370
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,164
Of course.

371
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,251
Can you wait?

372
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,296
Of course, I can wait.

373
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:29,137
Before that time comes,
I want to get a little better.

374
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,306
Will you wait for me
until then?

375
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,310
Of course, I'll wait.

376
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:40,232
Is it hard?

377
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:43,318
The soles of my feet?

378
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,154
Silly you.

379
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:53,161
If you're asking if I have an erection,
of course, I do.

380
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:58,292
Can you please stop saying
of course?

381
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,253
OK, I'll stop.

382
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,340
Is it difficult?

383
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,218
What?

384
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:12,180
Being hard like that.

385
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,266
What?

386
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,313
I mean, does it hurt?

387
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,192
Sometimes it does...

388
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,198
Shall I help you get rid of it?

389
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,287
With your hand?

390
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:38,248
Right.

391
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,365
It's warm.

392
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,247
You're good at that.

393
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,255
Be a good boy and shut up.

394
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:26,231
When did you get here?

395
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,441
A while ago.

396
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,450
Why are you so spaced out?

397
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:45,333
I'm a little tired from my trip.

398
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,475
Hey, Watanabe.

399
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,437
Do you have any idea
what I want to do, right now?

400
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,440
No.

401
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,359
I can't imagine.

402
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:16,406
I want to be lying down
on a big, wide, fluffy bed.

403
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:21,495
You're lying beside me
and slowly taking my clothes off.

404
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,372
So tenderly.

405
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,505
I'm spacing out,
feeling really nice.

406
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:36,343
Suddenly I come to my senses
and yell, "Stop it, Watanabe!"

407
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:40,430
Stop it, Watanabe. I like you.

408
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:45,477
But I'm seeing someone else.
I can't do this. Please stop.

409
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,022
But you don't stop.

410
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:54,152
Then you show it to me.
Your thing, sticking way up.

411
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,031
That's what you want to do, now?

412
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,242
That's right.

413
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:18,051
Do all the guys
in here masturbate?

414
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:21,221
Probably.
Can you talk more quietly?

415
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:24,141
Do they do it,
thinking about girls?

416
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:27,060
I kind of doubt anybody
masturbates thinking

417
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:30,147
about the stock market
or the Suez Canal.

418
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:33,024
Have you ever thought about me?

419
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,317
Hey, tell me!

420
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,156
When you weren't at school,
you were here.

421
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,157
Yeah.

422
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:43,160
Whenever I saw you,
you looked tired.

423
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,161
I did?

424
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:45,287
Why?

425
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,088
Daddy, it's me, Midori.

426
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,263
How are you?

427
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:10,228
Daddy, I have to go
and see the nurse.

428
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,148
I'll be right back, OK?

429
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:19,196
- Can you stay with him?
- Of course.

430
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:43,196
Hello?

431
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,242
My father died.

432
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:57,252
Is there anything I can do?

433
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:00,463
I'm fine, thank you.

434
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:05,427
I just wanted to let you know.

435
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,317
Don't come.

436
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:24,321
I hate funerals.

437
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:27,365
I don't want to see you there.

438
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:31,453
I get it.

439
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:52,349
Will you take me to a porn film?

440
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:57,437
Of course.

441
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,524
A really dirty one.

442
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:07,322
I'll find a good one for you.

443
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:16,373
My father should have gone
to Uruguay.

444
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,377
You're right.

445
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,508
Would you have come
to visit me?

446
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:29,427
Of course.

447
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:39,521
We might have had
lots of healthy babies there.

448
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,524
That's not a bad life.

449
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,529
You're so kind.

450
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,491
I'll call you again.

451
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:53,535
Sure.

452
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:24,542
What happened to your hand?

453
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:26,669
I just got hurt at work.

454
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:28,421
I see.

455
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,430
I passed...

456
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,433
The Foreign Ministry exam?

457
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,562
Congratulations.

458
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,483
You're going abroad, right?

459
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:52,445
The first year is training here.

460
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,697
Then I'll be abroad for a while.

461
01:14:56,534 --> 01:15:01,621
What are your plans for Hatsumi?
You'll be abroad for years.

462
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:04,541
What will happen to her?

463
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,627
That's her business, not mine.

464
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,464
What do you mean?

465
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:47,584
Look,

466
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:53,673
I'm not planning to marry anyone and
I made that perfectly clear to Hatsumi.

467
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:56,634
So...

468
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:03,641
If Hatsumi wants to marry somebody,
she should go ahead.

469
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:07,645
If she wants to wait for me,
she can.

470
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:10,732
That's what I mean.

471
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:22,619
You think I'm a shit, don't you?

472
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:23,703
Yes.

473
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:35,715
I'll bring her along next time.
Talk to her, I'm sure you'll like her.

474
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:37,675
It's a waste of time.

475
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,804
I'm too poor to go out with girls
from your school.

476
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,726
Don't be silly.
She's a nice, natural girl.

477
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,605
My school cafeteria has three lunches,
A, B and C.

478
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:54,651
A lunch is 120 Yen,
B is 1 00 Yen, C is 80 Yen.

479
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:57,695
When I eat the A lunch,

480
01:16:57,821 --> 01:17:00,657
everybody gives me dirty looks.

481
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,659
You still think I can talk to her?

482
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:04,661
Just meet her.

483
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:06,537
You don't have to screw her.

484
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,747
I should say not.

485
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:12,627
You can't do that,
she's still a virgin.

486
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:15,713
Watanabe's in love with a girl.

487
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:19,634
But he won't say a word about her.

488
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:20,718
Really?

489
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,763
But I'm not hiding anything.

490
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:27,684
It's just that the situation is
complicated and hard to talk about.

491
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:33,731
What a shame, we could have
gone on double dates.

492
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,733
We could have got drunk
and swapped.

493
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:38,695
- Don't be awful.
- Nothing's awful.

494
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:39,779
Right?

495
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:45,785
We swapped girls once.

496
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:52,834
Watanabe.

497
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:55,628
Did you?

498
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:58,840
Go ahead, tell her.

499
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:06,889
I'd like to hear that story
It sounds very interesting.

500
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,602
We were drunk.

501
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:15,732
That's all right,
I'm not blaming you.

502
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:19,819
I just want you
to tell me the story.

503
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,831
The two of us were drinking
in a bar

504
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:34,834
and got friendly with
this pair of girls.

505
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:39,797
They went to a junior college.
They were pretty plastered, too.

506
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:44,719
So anyway, we went to a hotel
and slept with them.

507
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,847
Nagasawa's room
was right next door to mine.

508
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:54,729
Nagasawa knocked on my door
in the middle of the night

509
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,898
and said we should
exchange girls,

510
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,734
so I went to his room,

511
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,819
and he went to mine.

512
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:10,953
Was it fun?

513
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,750
Not especially.

514
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,712
So why did you do that?

515
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:20,755
I suggested it.

516
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,882
I'm asking Watanabe.

517
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:28,930
Why did you do that?

518
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:35,812
Sometimes, I really want
to sleep with a girl.

519
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,816
You know, Watanabe...

520
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,832
I don't know
how complicated it is,

521
01:19:56,917 --> 01:20:00,962
but that kind of behaviour
isn't of your style.

522
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:07,009
It isn't right for you.
What do you think?

523
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:11,013
I feel that way, too, sometimes.

524
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:16,894
So why don't you stop?

525
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:19,772
Let me summarise.

526
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:24,777
Watanabe's got this girl he likes, but
can't get any because of complications.

527
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:27,864
So he tells himself sex is sex
and satisfies his needs elsewhere.

528
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:32,910
But if you really love her, shouldn't
you be able to control yourself?

529
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,037
Maybe so.

530
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:39,959
It's just a game.

531
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:46,048
Doesn't even count as cheating
Nobody gets hurt.

532
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,926
I get hurt.

533
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:51,929
Why am I not enough for you?

534
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:54,056
It's not that you're
not enough for me.

535
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:07,987
Hey.

536
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:14,827
What do you think about
Nagasawa and me?

537
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:17,914
It doesn't matter what I think.

538
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:27,924
It's all right.
Tell me exactly what you think.

539
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,097
If I were you, I'd leave him.

540
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,059
The way he lives,

541
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:44,023
it never crosses his mind
to make himself happy,

542
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:47,026
or to make others happy.

543
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:54,867
You seem like you could be happy
with just about anyone.

544
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:59,997
How did you end up with Nagasawa
of all people?

545
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:09,966
Things like that just happen.

546
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:14,095
There's not much you can
do about it.

547
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:21,060
You love him that much?

548
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:23,062
I do.

549
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:30,152
It must be wonderful,

550
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:34,156
to be so sure you love someone.

551
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:40,121
After Nagasawa
was posted to Germany,

552
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:43,916
Hatsumi married some man.

553
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:48,087
Then, two years later, she slit
her wrists with a razor and died.

554
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:33,966
Sorry about the other night.

555
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:35,968
Never mind.

556
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:39,055
I made up with Hatsumi.

557
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:41,223
I'm not surprised.

558
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:51,067
She told me you told her
to leave me.

559
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:54,153
Isn't that what you wanted me
to tell her?

560
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,240
Phone for you, Watanabe.

561
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,201
Excuse me.

562
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,374
Sorry I'm late.

563
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:09,293
What are you drinking?

564
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,295
A Tom Collins.

565
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,215
A whiskey and soda.

566
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,382
What happened?

567
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:18,344
I hurt myself at work.

568
01:24:19,262 --> 01:24:21,430
- Where were you?
- Nara and Aomori.

569
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:28,395
Had a hard time with the funeral?

570
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,316
No, we're used to them.

571
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,445
My sister and I have worked so hard,
we decided to do whatever we wanted.

572
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:40,407
I decided I'd take my boyfriend to Nara
and screw like crazy.

573
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,371
So, did you screw like crazy?

574
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:47,414
No, not even once.

575
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:52,294
My period started the minute
we got to our hotel room.

576
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:56,340
It's not funny
I was a whole week early.

577
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:58,384
It was pathetic.

578
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:02,346
Both he and I had been
about to explode.

579
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:06,433
So we had a big fight
and I haven't seen him since.

580
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:12,356
I came back to Tokyo
and then went to Aomori.

581
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,400
Have you ever been?

582
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:16,443
Never.

583
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:20,364
And, you know,

584
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:25,286
while I was travelling by myself,
I kept thinking about you,

585
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:29,498
wishing that you were beside me.

586
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:34,378
How come?

587
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:39,508
What do you mean, how come?

588
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:43,554
How come you were thinking
about me?

589
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:48,392
Because I like you. Why else?

590
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:50,561
What other reason is there?

591
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:54,440
But you've got a boyfriend.

592
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:57,484
You don't have to think about me.

593
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:03,532
Don't be so mean.

594
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:14,585
Watanabe, do you know
what I want to do now?

595
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:20,424
Come on. Remember where we are.

596
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:31,477
I never dreamed you'd
answer me like that.

597
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:59,546
Midori, answer the phone!

598
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:01,465
It's fine.

599
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:28,450
Are you seeing someone
in Tokyo?

600
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:31,578
No.

601
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:37,584
If you do, please tell me.

602
01:27:39,421 --> 01:27:40,504
Of course.

603
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:49,471
Oh, look.

604
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:19,668
But Reiko still doesn't eat much,

605
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:22,671
just smokes one cigarette
after another.

606
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:28,677
There isn't much gardening to do
at this time of year.

607
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:32,473
The birds and rabbits
are doing fine.

608
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:36,602
We hunt for mushrooms

609
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:39,605
and pick chestnuts to eat.

610
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:45,694
Every day, it's rice with
chestnuts or mushrooms,

611
01:28:46,529 --> 01:28:48,655
but it's so delicious,
I never tire of it.

612
01:28:57,624 --> 01:29:01,585
I get confused by most things

613
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:04,630
that come from the outside.

614
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,591
But your descriptions

615
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:10,677
of the world around you

616
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:14,723
give me wonderful relief.

617
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:18,644
It's so strange. I wonder why.

618
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:44,670
Midori sounds like
an interesting person.

619
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:46,713
Reading your letter,

620
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:51,677
I got the feeling she might
be in love with you.

621
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:19,746
Happy birthday.

622
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:22,666
I hope you have a happy year,

623
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:26,670
being 20 years old.

624
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:32,801
My own year of being 20
will probably end miserably.

625
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:38,807
I hope you can be happy
enough for me, too.

626
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:45,772
Reiko and I knitted
this scarf together.

627
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:49,651
The good half is Reiko's,

628
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:52,696
the bad half is mine.

629
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:27,856
Will you come and see me,

630
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:31,735
when it starts to snow?

631
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:40,929
No...

632
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:44,891
I can't...

633
01:32:46,853 --> 01:32:48,812
Please stop.

634
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:53,734
Please.

635
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:32,814
Why do you care for me?

636
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:39,029
You shouldn't be involved with me,

637
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:45,869
you should live your own life.

638
01:33:49,916 --> 01:33:50,999
But you're...

639
01:33:52,919 --> 01:33:54,878
You're wrong.

640
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:57,964
That's not what I think.

641
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:07,933
Don't you think
you're lying to yourself?

642
01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:18,902
Leave me alone.

643
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:25,909
It's what you should have done
on my birthday.

644
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:29,913
Don't touch me!

645
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:32,916
You are crazy!
Don't touch me!

646
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Calm down.

647
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:38,004
Go away! Don't touch me!

648
01:34:38,881 --> 01:34:39,798
Calm down.

649
01:34:39,882 --> 01:34:42,968
Your presence is painful!

650
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:45,929
Why don't you understand?

651
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:48,014
Naoko, calm down!

652
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:51,995
I'm thinking of leaving the dorm
and finding an apartment.

653
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:56,041
If I get more part-time work,
I can cover my expenses.

654
01:35:57,126 --> 01:36:00,128
How would you like
to live with me?

655
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:02,923
Thank you.

656
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:08,136
It makes me so happy
that you asked me that.

657
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:16,102
This isn't somewhere you should
stay too long.

658
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:21,066
Think it over.

659
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:27,113
I'm moving as soon as possible,
anyway.

660
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:33,119
Any time you want to join me,
you can.

661
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:40,126
Why can't I get wet?

662
01:36:43,005 --> 01:36:45,006
It only happened that once.

663
01:36:47,134 --> 01:36:49,135
Why can't I?

664
01:36:51,013 --> 01:36:56,059
It's only psychological.
Give it time.

665
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:59,062
Don't worry about it.

666
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:08,154
What if...

667
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:12,993
I never get wet again,

668
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:17,122
and can't ever have sex?

669
01:37:22,044 --> 01:37:25,213
Would you still be able
to love me?

670
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:30,093
At heart,

671
01:37:32,054 --> 01:37:34,055
I'm an optimistic person.

672
01:39:02,269 --> 01:39:06,272
I'll come back to see you
after I've moved.

673
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:10,193
Think it over, OK?

674
01:39:22,331 --> 01:39:23,331
See you.

675
01:40:52,338 --> 01:40:56,216
I thought I'd get out
of here before you.

676
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:03,306
Mind if I give you
a piece of advice?

677
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:05,433
Sure.

678
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:08,394
Don't feel sorry for yourself.

679
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:14,275
Only degenerates feel sorry
for themselves.

680
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:16,319
I'll keep it in mind.

681
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:23,493
It must have been difficult for you too,
waiting for her letter.

682
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:29,290
But this month has been
just as difficult for Naoko.

683
01:41:30,376 --> 01:41:33,378
She has slowly started
hearing voices again.

684
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:39,259
She has trouble just having
ordinary conversations now.

685
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:43,513
She doesn't want to see you
in her current state.

686
01:42:01,365 --> 01:42:02,407
Hey.

687
01:42:02,491 --> 01:42:04,367
I want to talk to you.

688
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:07,537
I have plans.

689
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:14,335
It won't take long
Just five minutes.

690
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:17,505
I don't want to talk to you, sorry.

691
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:32,020
To tell you the truth,
it's getting increasingly difficult

692
01:42:32,104 --> 01:42:34,230
to control Naoko.

693
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:39,027
I have to watch her constantly.

694
01:42:40,029 --> 01:42:42,071
The voices she's hearing
are getting worse.

695
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:47,076
She's shutting out the whole world,
going deep inside herself.

696
01:42:51,081 --> 01:43:11,226
Kizuki.

697
01:43:12,144 --> 01:43:13,228
Naoko!

698
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:21,277
Hey, Kizuki.

699
01:43:23,155 --> 01:43:26,241
Unlike you, I've chosen to live.

700
01:43:27,243 --> 01:43:30,203
And to live the best way I can.

701
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:34,082
I'm sure it was hard for you.

702
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:37,085
But it's hard for me, too.

703
01:43:37,253 --> 01:43:40,213
Because you killed yourself,

704
01:43:40,297 --> 01:43:43,132
leaving Naoko behind.

705
01:43:45,094 --> 01:43:47,303
But I will never abandon her.

706
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:51,224
The reason is, I love her.

707
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:56,104
I'm going to grow stronger.

708
01:43:57,189 --> 01:44:00,316
I'm going to grow up.

709
01:44:53,162 --> 01:44:54,203
Let's go.

710
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:21,272
I talked with him after I saw you
at the bar that night,

711
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:24,359
and I broke up with him.

712
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:34,285
I like you.

713
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:38,373
From the bottom of my heart.

714
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:43,419
But there's nothing
I can do right now.

715
01:45:46,423 --> 01:45:48,383
Because of her?

716
01:45:49,301 --> 01:45:50,343
Yes.

717
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:57,266
Tell me.

718
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:01,396
Have you slept with her?

719
01:46:03,315 --> 01:46:06,317
Just once, last year.

720
01:46:11,407 --> 01:46:13,449
Haven't you seen her since?

721
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:18,287
I saw her twice.
But we didn't do anything.

722
01:46:22,251 --> 01:46:23,334
Why not?

723
01:46:27,339 --> 01:46:30,258
Isn't she in love with you?

724
01:46:34,471 --> 01:46:39,434
That's hard to say.
It's really complicated.

725
01:46:41,311 --> 01:46:43,271
What I do know

726
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:47,233
is I have a certain responsibility

727
01:46:47,317 --> 01:46:49,485
which I can't just abandon.

728
01:46:51,321 --> 01:46:54,282
Even if she isn't in love with me.

729
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:01,372
Even if she isn't in love with you?

730
01:47:09,298 --> 01:47:10,506
I need time.

731
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:18,306
I am sorry,
but that's all I can say now.

732
01:47:34,531 --> 01:47:36,324
All right.

733
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:39,494
I'll wait.

734
01:47:43,373 --> 01:47:45,416
Because I trust you.

735
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:57,512
But when you take me,
take only me.

736
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:03,434
When you hold me,
think only about me.

737
01:48:06,396 --> 01:48:08,356
Do you understand me?

738
01:48:12,444 --> 01:48:13,569
Very well.

739
01:48:22,371 --> 01:48:23,496
And...

740
01:48:25,457 --> 01:48:29,585
you can do whatever you want to me,
but don't hurt me.

741
01:48:33,382 --> 01:48:38,386
I've already been hurt enough in my
life. I don't want to be hurt any more.

742
01:48:42,474 --> 01:48:44,517
I want to be happy.

743
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:56,404
Hold me.

744
01:49:53,712 --> 01:49:55,630
Naoko died.

745
01:53:12,702 --> 01:53:16,872
Nothing can heal
the loss of a beloved.

746
01:53:17,874 --> 01:53:22,628
No truth, no sincerity,

747
01:53:22,712 --> 01:53:26,799
no strength, no kindness
can heal that sorrow.

748
01:53:28,677 --> 01:53:30,678
All we can do

749
01:53:30,762 --> 01:53:34,890
is live through the sorrow
and learn something from it.

750
01:53:35,725 --> 01:53:40,729
But whatever we learn
will be of no help

751
01:53:40,856 --> 01:53:42,898
in facing the next sorrow
to come along.

752
01:55:16,826 --> 01:55:19,745
You were planning
to live with Naoko here.

753
01:55:20,747 --> 01:55:22,790
I need to wash up.

754
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:01,722
Please remember me forever.

755
01:57:02,807 --> 01:57:07,895
Please always remember
that I existed

756
01:57:08,772 --> 01:57:11,732
and was here by your side.

757
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:15,736
Will you promise?

758
01:57:21,951 --> 01:57:26,789
I promise
I'll always remember.

759
01:57:54,901 --> 01:57:57,778
What are your plans?

760
01:58:01,825 --> 01:58:03,784
I'm going to Asahikawa.

761
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:09,873
A friend from college
runs a music school there.

762
01:58:13,962 --> 01:58:15,838
Aren't you going to see

763
01:58:16,798 --> 01:58:18,882
your husband and daughter?

764
01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:33,981
Hey, Watanabe.

765
01:58:39,988 --> 01:58:43,991
Do people fall in love
in Asahikawa?

766
01:58:49,998 --> 01:58:53,959
Of course, there's no question.

767
01:58:56,963 --> 01:59:02,009
You should fall in love again.

768
01:59:07,932 --> 01:59:10,851
Can I ask you for something?

769
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:15,856
Yes, of course.

770
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:28,911
Sleep with me.

771
01:59:32,874 --> 01:59:33,957
Are you serious?

772
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:42,966
Yes, I think we should.

773
01:59:49,057 --> 01:59:51,058
I'll go take a shower.

774
02:00:55,039 --> 02:00:56,999
Are you really serious?

775
02:02:50,154 --> 02:02:54,074
I've got back
what I lost seven years ago.

776
02:02:55,243 --> 02:02:57,077
Thank you.

777
02:04:08,274 --> 02:04:12,194
You don't need to walk me
to the station, I'm fine.

778
02:04:12,278 --> 02:04:14,321
No, I want to.

779
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,159
I'm fine here.

780
02:04:22,163 --> 02:04:26,166
Asahikawa is a nice town.
I'll visit you some day.

781
02:04:30,171 --> 02:04:34,341
Please be happy.
For me and Naoko, too.

782
02:05:04,288 --> 02:05:05,372
Hello?

783
02:05:06,207 --> 02:05:09,209
It's me, Midori.

784
02:05:17,343 --> 02:05:18,385
Midori.

785
02:05:20,388 --> 02:05:22,389
I want to see you and talk to you.

786
02:05:31,399 --> 02:05:36,278
I want to start all over with you.

787
02:05:46,330 --> 02:05:48,415
There's nothing I want,
other than you.

788
02:06:04,432 --> 02:06:05,432
I love you.

789
02:06:17,361 --> 02:06:18,486
Where are you now?

790
02:06:21,449 --> 02:06:23,283
What?

791
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:26,453
Where are you now?

792
02:06:31,292 --> 02:06:34,377
I wonder where I am now.

793
02:06:39,383 --> 02:06:41,468
With each passing season,

794
02:06:42,303 --> 02:06:45,347
I grow farther away
from the dead.

795
02:06:47,308 --> 02:06:49,392
Kizuki remains 1 7.

796
02:06:50,353 --> 02:06:52,437
Naoko remains 21 .

797
02:06:53,356 --> 02:06:54,481
For eternity.
