00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:47,215
The legend of the ten rings

4
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:50,093
has been told for thousands of years.

5
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,433
Every generation,
the story grows.

6
00:00:56,599 --> 00:01:01,396
But at its centre
there is always one man.

7
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:16,953
Some say he found the rings in a crater
or stole them from a tomb.

8
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,542
They gave him the strength of a god,

9
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:26,212
and the gift of eternal life.

10
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:36,389
He could have used them for good.

11
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,979
But all he wanted...

12
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,856
was power.

13
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,485
He called his army The Ten Rings.

14
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:37,826
Over the centuries, they spread
into every corner of the world.

15
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,961
They moved in the shadows...

16
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,382
Toppled governments...

17
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,970
And changed the course of history.

18
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:17,490
He chased money and power
for a thousand years.

19
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:21,452
But he still wanted more.

20
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,543
Have you heard the legend of Ta Lo?

21
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:34,841
A hidden village with mythical creatures
and ancient magic.

22
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:39,971
Where people practise
a martial arts style from the gods.

23
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:42,015
I want to find it.

24
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,643
Of course. I'll send a scout
to explore the area,

25
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,438
and come back
with more information.

26
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,567
I want to go now.

27
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:17,342
The forest...

28
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,930
...is moving.

29
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,838
He had nothing left
on Earth to conquer.

30
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:04,472
That's when he came
for my home.

31
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,817
Where's the entrance
to Ta Lo?

32
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,862
You're not welcome
in our village.

33
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,574
You don't know who
you're talking to.

34
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,827
I don't care who you are.

35
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:30,373
Turn around now,
and I won't have to hurt you.

36
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,341
Is that all?

37
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:02,316
That was the first time
I met your father.

38
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,824
He was the last person
I thought I'd fall for.

39
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,579
But love had other plans.

40
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,543
Shang-Chi,

41
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,504
there's much more to know
about the legend of the rings,

42
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:27,466
but you'll learn about that
when you're older.

43
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:33,347
If Dad's rings were so powerful,
how did you beat him?

44
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:41,856
Where I'm from, we are empowered
by the magic of the Great Protector.

45
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,197
When you have the heart
of our dragon,

46
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,408
you can do some amazing things.

47
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:55,870
Can you still do those things?

48
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:01,959
I left those powers in Ta Lo
with our dragon,

49
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:05,588
but what I got in return
is so much better.

50
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,844
I want you to have this.

51
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,848
Whenever you feel lost,

52
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:19,018
this will help you
find your way home.

53
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,270
Can you remember that?

54
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:42,458
Okay.

55
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,604
Hello, sir,

56
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,065
welcome to the Fairmont...

57
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,567
I'm driving.

58
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:51,193
No, you're not... Katy.

59
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,237
Hey, hey, get back here.

60
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:54,363
Give me the key.

61
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:58,200
Please open the door.

62
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:00,828
Oh, my God.

63
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,955
- Get out.
- You get in!

64
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,081
Look, if happens
to this thing,

65
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,166
we're gonna be jobless

66
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,500
and in debt
for the rest of our lives.

67
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,753
Oh, come on. Nothing's gonna
happen to this car.

68
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,338
I'm the Asian Jeff Gordon.

69
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,672
I don't know who that is.

70
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,632
Most career wins
in all of NASCAR history?

71
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,301
Please get out of the car.

72
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,761
Shaun,

73
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,971
we've been friends
for 10 years, okay?

74
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:21,182
You know I'm not an idiot.

75
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,393
Please, get in. I'll go slow.

76
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,689
Katy, watch the...

77
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,405
<i>I knew Katy was trouble</i>

78
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:37,823
<i>the first day we met
in high school.</i>

79
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,075
I was getting picked on a lot,

80
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,077
for all the reasons
we all get picked on a lot.

81
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,953
Plus, I had just moved
to the US,

82
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,497
so I was struggling
with my English,

83
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,748
and I was on my way
to lunch one day

84
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,666
when this guy
who was like twice my size

85
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,751
yells at me
from down the hall,

86
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,127
"What's up, Gangnam Style?"

87
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,755
So I yelled back,
"I'm not Korean, idiot."

88
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:53,839
And I turn the corner,

89
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:55,549
and I see this guy
drop his backpack,

90
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,967
he's getting
all up in his face...

91
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,928
And right before he was about
to throw the first punch,

92
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:00,930
Katy comes out of nowhere,

93
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:04,350
steps right between us
and starts screaming the lyrics

94
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,851
to <i>Hotel California.</i>

95
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,019
What?

96
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,230
It's the art of confusion.
Works great on stupid people.

97
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,481
And that's how we met.

98
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,066
Then I pulled him
into the parking lot...

99
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,359
At which point she revealed

100
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,736
that she had also swiped
the keys to the guy's Mustang.

101
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,988
Yeah, we went on a little
joyride around the block.

102
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,532
And your wife
was in the car, too.

103
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,325
- That's true. You were.
- What?

104
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,827
I was just in the back seat.

105
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,911
That's a part of the car.

106
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,079
That's still
a part of the car.

107
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,789
How have you
never told me this story?

108
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:28,124
You know,
before she was a lawyer,

109
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,458
your girl was pretty wild.

110
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,293
Oh! What happened?

111
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,296
I grew up.

112
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,090
What's that supposed to mean?

113
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,174
Yeah, what's that
supposed to mean?

114
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,926
That maybe there's a point

115
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,970
where you're supposed
to stop going on joyrides

116
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:43,556
and start thinking about
living up to your potential.

117
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,224
Please tell me
you're kidding, Soo.

118
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:46,392
Look,

119
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,643
we're now living in a world

120
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,727
where at any moment

121
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,563
half the population
can just disappear.

122
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,566
Life's too short
and too fragile.

123
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,317
Katy, you're a valet driver

124
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,861
with an honours degree
from Berkeley,

125
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,280
and Shaun can speak,
like, four languages.

126
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,365
You've always been the most
talented people I know.

127
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,617
I just don't get why
you're scared

128
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,578
to actually use it
for something serious.

129
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,288
Wow.

130
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:10,875
You sound like my mom.
You also...

131
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,376
dress like her
a little bit, too.

132
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,503
Where's this from, Talbots?

133
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:16,505
We're not running
from adulthood.

134
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,966
How is it running to have jobs
that you actually like?

135
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,634
Yeah, that doesn't
even make any sense.

136
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,095
Did you think
valet parking is easy?

137
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,181
It's like the most
challenging job ever.

138
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,516
You need people skills,
driving skills...

139
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,226
Soo can't even
parallel park.

140
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:35,566
Well, it's almost midnight.
We got the early shift.

141
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,736
Should probably be
responsible, go to sleep.

142
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:40,613
Yeah, we can be responsible.
We can do that.

143
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,239
Or...

144
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:46,118
<i>Over,
sideways and under on a...</i>

145
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,496
<i>Take my horse
to the old town road</i>

146
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,580
<i>I'm gonna</i>

147
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,790
<i>Close my eyes</i>

148
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,626
<i>I don't wanna...</i>

149
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,661
Morning, Mrs Chen.

150
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,954
She's not ready yet.

151
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,789
Come have some joe
while you wait.

152
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,417
Katy, Shaun's here.

153
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,336
Yeah, Mom,
be there in a minute.

154
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,420
Ruihua,

155
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,006
you're supposed to be helping
your dad stock the shop.

156
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:44,343
Mom, I can't work on an empty
stomach, my legs get crampy.

157
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,886
Maybe Shaun can help him

158
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,180
instead of just showing up
every day to eat our food.

159
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,557
I'm happy to help.

160
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,434
No, it's Ruihua's job,
let him do it.

161
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,144
Waipo.

162
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,939
That seat's for Waigong.

163
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,108
Oh, sorry.

164
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:04,613
He's getting all his favourite things
this year for the Day of the Dead.

165
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,365
Are you sure
that Waigong's allowed to take

166
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,449
Funyuns and cigarettes

167
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,742
back to the afterlife?

168
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,578
He can take anything.

169
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,748
Last year I put a bottle of whisky
on his grave...

170
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:16,834
And it was gone the next morning.

171
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,422
I know you kids think it's silly.

172
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,299
We don't think
it's silly, Waipo.

173
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,968
We just know Waigong would've
wanted you to move on

174
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,136
and enjoy your life.

175
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,430
"Moving on"
is an American idea.

176
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,765
You're American, Mom!
Don't forget.

177
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,350
Shaun,

178
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:36,687
did my daughter apply
to any new jobs this week?

179
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,606
She really likes her job.

180
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,857
We both do.

181
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,941
Mm-hmm.

182
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,818
Waigong didn't move here
from Hunan

183
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,528
so you could park cars
for a living.

184
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,573
Well, on that note,

185
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,116
I think we're gonna
miss our bus.

186
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,242
Mm.

187
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:52,077
I'm sorry
for my unacceptable job.

188
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,537
And for staying out late
last night,

189
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,164
trying to enjoy my life.

190
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:57,499
But one day, I'll make you
proud, I promise.

191
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,043
I'm proud of you, sis.

192
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,670
Parking cars is super hard.

193
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,880
Thanks, bro.

194
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,214
Maybe one day you'll pass
your driver's test,

195
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,299
live the dream like me.

196
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:06,467
Come on, Shaun, let's go.

197
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,889
When are you two going
to get married?

198
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,265
Waipo, we're just friends.

199
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,977
All right. Go, go, go.

200
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,945
Look. Look at that.
Look at that girl.

201
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,031
She's writing a research paper
on a bus.

202
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,532
So?

203
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,034
That is exactly the daughter

204
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,869
my mom wishes
came out of her vagina.

205
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,581
I'm sorry about her.

206
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,167
How's it goin'?

207
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,507
Give me the pendant,

208
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,801
and no one gets hurt.

209
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,969
Do you know this guy?

210
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,098
I don't know what
you're talking about, dude.

211
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,810
- Hey! Get off of me!
- Whoa.

212
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,020
What is wrong with you,
asshole?

213
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,231
I don't want any trouble.

214
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:04,149
Then give us the pendant!

215
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,984
You have the wrong guy!

216
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,403
Does he look like
he can fight?

217
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,113
Come on, bro!

218
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,373
You okay?

219
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,932
Yo, what up, y'all?
It's your boy Klev,

220
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,767
comin' at you live on the bus.

221
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,227
I actually did take

222
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,146
a little bit of martial arts
as a youth,

223
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,107
so I'm gonna try and grade
this fight as we're goin'.

224
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,497
Holy shit.

225
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,125
Who are you?

226
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,016
You got this, bro!

227
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:23,979
My bad.

228
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:50,631
No, no, no!

229
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,217
Sorry.

230
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,094
What the hell's going on?

231
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,304
You really wanna talk
about this now?

232
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,021
Bus driver is down.

233
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,356
I'm not gonna handle this.

234
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,775
Every time I've tried to drive
a bus, I get yelled at.

235
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,046
Go, you freak!

236
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,683
Open the door, please!

237
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,105
The back is about to go.

238
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,316
On my signal,
make a hard right.

239
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,483
What signal?

240
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,389
Everybody to the front now!

241
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,100
Go! Go, go, go.

242
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,895
What's up, y'all? What's up,
y'all? What's up, y'all?

243
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,617
You and your sister
deserve what's coming.

244
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,060
Hold on, everybody!

245
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,311
Oh, God.

246
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,446
Oh, my God!

247
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,961
Sorry. Heh.

248
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,088
We make a good team.

249
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,870
Shaun. Hey.

250
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,622
You need to tell me
what the hell's going on.

251
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,374
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

252
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,209
- Macau.
- Macau?

253
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:57,586
Those guys are going
after my sister next,

254
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:58,670
and I have to
get to her first.

255
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:00,881
You have a sister?

256
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:02,049
Look, I know
this is confusing.

257
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,383
I'll explain it
when I get back, I promise.

258
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,468
No, no.

259
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:05,635
Hell no, dude.

260
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:06,970
This is bullshit!

261
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,473
I have been by your side
for half your life.

262
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,641
I get there are things you
never wanted to talk about,

263
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,185
and I never wanted to push.

264
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:16,354
But a guy with a freaking
machete for an arm

265
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,440
just chopped
our bus in half, Shaun!

266
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,233
Who the hell are you?

267
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,994
My sister sent me this
a few months ago.

268
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,330
I think it's the address
of where she's staying.

269
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:39,086
Those guys back there
were sent by my dad.

270
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,253
What?

271
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,631
If they hurt her...

272
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,429
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

273
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,060
Fine.

274
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,645
You can explain on the plane.

275
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,146
What?
No, Katy, you can't just...

276
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,023
You can explain
on the plane, Shaun!

277
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,132
<i>After my mom died...</i>

278
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,093
<i>my dad started my training.</i>

279
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,028
<i>From sunup to sundown,</i>

280
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,614
<i>I was taught every possible
way to kill a man.</i>

281
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:40,749
<i>By the time I was 14,</i>

282
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:41,833
<i>I could barely remember</i>

283
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,376
<i>what life was like
before she died.</i>

284
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,005
<i>That's how old I was</i>

285
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,965
<i>when he sent me
on my first assignment.</i>

286
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,803
<i>I was willing to do
anything he wanted.</i>

287
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:55,847
<i>If he asked me
to burn the world down,</i>

288
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:56,932
<i>I would've asked him...</i>

289
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,099
<i>Beef or vegetarian?</i>

290
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:01,645
We're all out of the chicken,

291
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,980
so I can only offer you
beef or vegetarian?

292
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:05,649
Um...

293
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:08,151
- Vegetarian would be great.
- Yeah, same.

294
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,319
- Okay.
- Thank you.

295
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,529
So...

296
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:14,074
Oh, we're out
of the vegetarian too.

297
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:15,867
Now we only have beef.

298
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,954
Beef. 'Cause that's all
you have, right?

299
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,330
- Okay, you'll have the beef.
- Yes.

300
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,414
- And...
- Beef.

301
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,458
- And the beef.
- Two beefs.

302
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:30,924
Did you go through with it?

303
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:40,976
I knew that I couldn't
go back to him, so I just...

304
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,062
ran.

305
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,361
I know this is a lot
to dump on you.

306
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,951
I'm sorry about your mom.

307
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,834
I should also probably mention

308
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:08,795
that my name's
not technically Shaun.

309
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,172
What?

310
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:13,216
What is it?

311
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,094
It's Shang-Chi.

312
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:17,804
Shaun-Chi.

313
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,347
No. Shang-Chi.

314
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,890
Shaun-Chi.

315
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,517
Shang.

316
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,685
- Shaun.
- Shang.

317
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,228
Shan.

318
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,397
S-H-A-N-G. Shang.

319
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,357
Shang?

320
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:30,525
Yeah.

321
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:33,903
You changed your name
from Shang to Shaun?

322
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,947
Yeah, I don't... Yeah.

323
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:37,615
I wonder how
your father found you.

324
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,200
Okay, I was 15 years old.
All right?

325
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:41,244
What is your
name change logic?

326
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,454
You're going into hiding.

327
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,955
- Okay.
- And your name is Michael,

328
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,874
you go on
and change it to Mishael.

329
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:48,084
That's not what happened.

330
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:49,419
It's like,
"Hi, my name's Gina.

331
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,463
"I'm gonna go into hiding.
My new name's Gina."

332
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:52,630
Can't hear you. I'm sorry.

333
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,299
Yeah, okay.
Oh, yeah, you can hear me.

334
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:38,927
Sign here to get in.

335
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,308
I'm looking for my sister,
Xu Xialing.

336
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,644
Have you heard of her?

337
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,606
This is the address she gave me.

338
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,195
Okay.

339
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,365
Seems like a nice fella.

340
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,367
And this elevator
is definitely up to code.

341
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,701
There's absolutely no chance
of it just falling off

342
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:04,786
the side of the building...

343
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:09,624
Bus Boy!

344
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,501
Uh...

345
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:15,046
Two million views
in three days, bro!

346
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,214
Damn, dude.

347
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:17,632
Oh, no.

348
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,718
And you're the driver!

349
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,347
Oh, my Chinese sucks.

350
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:25,682
Oh, all good.

351
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,392
- I speak A-B-C.
- Oh, great.

352
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,935
- I'm Jon Jon.
- Jon Jon.

353
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:32,105
Welcome
to the Golden Daggers Club.

354
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,774
Okay,
let's get you ready to fight.

355
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,025
Wait. What?

356
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,695
We're a multi-platform
global operation.

357
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,989
Every fight livestreamed
on the dark web.

358
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:43,658
Thousands of viewers
placing bets as we speak.

359
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,035
This is gonna take your brand
to a whole new level.

360
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,745
Think there's been
some sort of confusion.

361
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:49,080
I like your spike face.

362
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,165
Thanks!

363
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,916
Usually, you gotta
fight your way to centre ring,

364
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,042
but a viral star like you?

365
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,210
Front of line, baby.

366
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:55,795
I'm not here
to fight anybody. Okay?

367
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,422
I'm looking
for my sister, Xu Xialing.

368
00:29:58,965 --> 00:29:59,966
Never heard of her.

369
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,926
We just lost a fighter
at the last minute,

370
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,970
so you get the next slot.

371
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,103
Nice one, Helen.

372
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,731
Is he gonna be
fighting in one of these?

373
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:17,901
Oh, no, no, no. These are
like low-level fights.

374
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:22,322
You're gonna be
fighting up there.

375
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:37,629
That hurt, Emil.

376
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:39,756
You want me to show you
how it feels?

377
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:51,643
Wong! Wong! Wong!

378
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:54,479
Wong! Wong! Wong!

379
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,147
Go, Wong!

380
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:57,774
I always bet on Asian.

381
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,400
Oh, my God.

382
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,361
Yeah, look, I'm not
going up there, okay?

383
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:02,779
- I'm just trying to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

384
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:03,905
It's too late to back out now.

385
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,657
- You already committed, bro.
- What?

386
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,784
You signed
the contract, remember?

387
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:09,285
Your name's on the roster.

388
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:11,204
The bets are piling in.

389
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,414
- Really? What's our cut?
- Oh, it's huge.

390
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:14,582
It doesn't matter.

391
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:15,833
It matters.

392
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,711
Dude, I saw you
fight five assassins

393
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,755
and a giant Romanian
with a razor for an arm

394
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,215
on a moving bus.

395
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,591
This is just one guy.

396
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,219
Just do it.
Then we all get paid,

397
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:29,305
and then I'll help you find
whoever you're looking for.

398
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:30,974
Come on. You got this.

399
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,433
- You got this.
- Don't be nervous.

400
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,601
Thank you.

401
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:34,769
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

402
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,028
How's the jaw?

403
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:48,157
Maybe you'll start
controlling those punches

404
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:49,576
like we practised?

405
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:56,416
Love that guy.

406
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,377
Now take your shirt off.

407
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,838
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

408
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,257
<i>the fight we've all
been waiting for.</i>

409
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:07,135
<i>The incredible
viral sensation,</i>

410
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:11,264
<i>all the way
from San Francisco, USA,</i>

411
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:14,684
<i>it's Bus Boy!</i>

412
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,481
What happened to your shirt?

413
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,572
<i>And his opponent
for tonight,</i>

414
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:31,159
<i>it's Macau's
own fearsome killer...</i>

415
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:37,457
<i>Xu Xialing!</i>

416
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,504
Sister.

417
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:46,591
Wait, wait!

418
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,802
What are you doing?

419
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,561
I know you're upset.

420
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:00,229
But can you hear me out?

421
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:05,985
We don't have time for this.

422
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,579
<i>Ooh, that's gotta hurt.</i>

423
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:25,588
Can you please stop hitting me?

424
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:38,935
Stop it! I'm trying to help you!

425
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,729
Dad's coming for you.

426
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,652
I'm not fighting you.

427
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,905
You shouldn't have come back.

428
00:33:56,411 --> 00:34:00,331
Sometimes when I'm doing my forms...

429
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,626
I close my eyes,

430
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:07,797
and it's like I can feel her.

431
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,883
Do you ever feel like that?

432
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,721
No.

433
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,893
I know
what you're going there to do.

434
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,855
I don't know what
he's telling you, but Mom...

435
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,648
Mom's dead.

436
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,538
Please don't leave me here.

437
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:50,631
I'll be back in three days.

438
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,865
<i>Xu Xialing, you're amazing!</i>

439
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,700
<i>We love you, Xu Xialing!
Whoo!</i>

440
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,469
You run this place?

441
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,013
I own it.

442
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:43,768
Where'd you
get all that money?

443
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,437
Did you bet against me?

444
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,189
No.

445
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,108
Hi, Xialing. I'm Katy.

446
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,527
You're, like, such a badass.

447
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,861
Everything that you do is,
like, so cool.

448
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,196
That was really cool.

449
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:56,823
I like your pants.

450
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,825
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

451
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:01,744
What do you want?

452
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:04,163
The Ten Rings ambushed us
in San Francisco.

453
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,498
I saw the video.

454
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,041
They took my pendant.

455
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:09,752
They're gonna come
for yours next.

456
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:13,881
I don't know
what he wants with them,

457
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:15,508
but we both know
it can't be good.

458
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,806
You know what he said to me
when he left?

459
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:25,268
"I'll be back in three days."

460
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:27,770
And after three days,

461
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:30,022
I went to our mom's shrine
and waited.

462
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:34,402
Three days
turned into a week,

463
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,612
a week turned to a month,

464
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:38,948
and a month
turned to six years.

465
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:45,872
That's how long
it took me to realise

466
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,665
I didn't need him any more.

467
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,712
I built this place on my own.

468
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:56,841
I didn't need you then,
and I don't need you now.

469
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,553
Then why would you
send me the postcard?

470
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:02,388
What postcard?

471
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,064
I didn't send you this.

472
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:20,781
Is there a back exit?

473
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,366
Shaun.

474
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,995
Hey. Hey!
Hey, open up!

475
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,876
She's gone, dude.

476
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:49,644
What do we do?

477
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,228
What do we do?

478
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:52,563
Uh...

479
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:00,112
Come on!

480
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:07,203
Oh, hell no. Screw you!
I'm not doing this.

481
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,371
If we make it to the elevator,

482
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:09,664
we can hop in
on the next floor.

483
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:13,000
Katy, we're out of options.
We have to go now.

484
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,214
One, two, three.

485
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:21,467
Whoa.

486
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,262
Just head
straight for that elevator.

487
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:27,556
You got this.

488
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:41,028
I'll buy you some time.
Just keep going.

489
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:33,456
<i>On a dark desert highway</i>

490
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,125
<i>Cool wind in my hair</i>

491
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:46,260
Shaun!

492
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,515
Shaun! Shaun!

493
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:56,729
Oh, my God! Ohhh!

494
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:02,777
I'm coming!

495
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,283
Shaun!

496
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:11,619
Hang on.

497
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,123
Gotcha.

498
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:17,625
Shaun!

499
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:20,669
Katy!

500
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:46,570
You left us for dead!

501
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:50,616
Now you know how it feels.

502
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:11,011
What does
he want with the pendant...

503
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:18,727
Did America make you soft?

504
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:35,119
He has the pendant!

505
00:42:59,203 --> 00:43:00,204
I told my men

506
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:03,624
they wouldn't be able
to kill you if they tried.

507
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,335
Glad I was right.

508
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,677
I've missed you, my son.

509
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:20,349
Let's go home.

510
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:20,534
My son is home.

511
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:26,582
Take the girls to their room.

512
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:39,887
I've seen some really
scary stuff this week,

513
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:43,057
but your dad's on,
like, a whole 'nother level.

514
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:46,477
Is he gonna kill us?

515
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:51,398
Just nod. Don't talk.
He'll forget you're there.

516
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,817
That's how I survived.

517
00:44:54,902 --> 00:44:56,820
He always treat you like that?

518
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,908
Only after my mom died.

519
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:07,289
He said he couldn't look at me
because I reminded him of her.

520
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:11,085
I wasn't allowed to train
with the boys.

521
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:14,129
But I watched
everything they did

522
00:45:14,213 --> 00:45:16,256
and taught myself
to do it better.

523
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:19,968
When did you leave?

524
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:22,388
I ran away when I was 16.

525
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:25,432
As soon as I knew
my brother wasn't coming back.

526
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:29,353
You started an underground
fight ring in Macau

527
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:31,730
when you were 16 years old?

528
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,151
If my dad won't let me
into his empire,

529
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:37,694
I'm gonna build my own.

530
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,322
Hell yeah.

531
00:46:06,682 --> 00:46:07,683
Shang-Chi.

532
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:12,104
That's enough.

533
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:20,863
Have you been
practicing your English?

534
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:24,158
Yes.

535
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,830
You have to strengthen your
mind along with your body.

536
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:39,756
If you want them
to be yours one day,

537
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:43,844
you have to show me you're
strong enough to carry them.

538
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:02,946
How did you find me?

539
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,991
I always know
where my children are.

540
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,785
I gave you 10 years
to live your life,

541
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:10,162
and where did it get you?

542
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:17,252
Now it's time for you
to take your place by my side.

543
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:20,589
That's not gonna happen.

544
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,719
American girl.

545
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:27,012
Her name is Katy.

546
00:47:28,305 --> 00:47:29,973
What is your Chinese name?

547
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:35,270
Ruiwen.

548
00:47:36,313 --> 00:47:38,482
Names are sacred, Ruiwen.

549
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:40,651
They connect us
not only to ourselves,

550
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:42,528
but to everyone
who came before.

551
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:45,656
A funny story.

552
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:48,283
Some years ago,
a terrorist from America

553
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:49,785
needed a boogeyman

554
00:47:49,952 --> 00:47:52,579
to bring your country
to its knees.

555
00:47:52,746 --> 00:47:55,415
So, he appropriated
The Ten Rings.

556
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:56,500
My Ten Rings.

557
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:59,086
But because
he didn't know my actual name,

558
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:00,546
he invented a new one.

559
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:03,131
Do you know the name he chose?

560
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:06,510
The Mandarin.

561
00:48:06,677 --> 00:48:09,638
He gave his figurehead
the name of a chicken dish.

562
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,473
And it worked.

563
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,433
America was terrified.

564
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:15,894
Of an orange.

565
00:48:17,688 --> 00:48:18,981
The truth is,

566
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:22,025
I've had many names
throughout my life.

567
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:25,153
The Warrior King, Master Khan,

568
00:48:25,237 --> 00:48:27,364
the most dangerous man
on Earth.

569
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:31,743
For years, I thought that was
all I was meant to be.

570
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,457
But when I met their mother,

571
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:40,002
everything changed.

572
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:57,853
<i>She showed me a part of myself
I didn't know was there.</i>

573
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:03,483
<i>It was like I was seeing
the world for the first time.</i>

574
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:17,205
<i>She gave up everything
so we could be together.</i>

575
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:22,127
<i>And so did I.</i>

576
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:38,852
You know who's in there?

577
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:40,854
Say, "Hello, little sister!"

578
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:48,779
<i>After all those years,</i>

579
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:50,447
<i>I finally found something</i>

580
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:52,783
<i>worth growing old for.</i>

581
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:00,624
My real name is Wenwu.

582
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:04,044
She was the only one
who called me that.

583
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:07,506
And when she died...

584
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,053
I was lost for many years.

585
00:50:15,764 --> 00:50:17,766
But I'm not lost any more.

586
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:23,605
When you children ran away,

587
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:26,316
I was so desperate
to connect with your mother,

588
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:29,695
I threw myself back into
the studies of her village.

589
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:32,072
The legendary Ta Lo.

590
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:34,449
I wasn't able

591
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:36,785
to find the secret path
to the village entrance,

592
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:40,497
but I did find
what they are hiding.

593
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,583
There's a gate
deep in their mountains.

594
00:50:44,251 --> 00:50:46,920
Your mother
is waiting for us there.

595
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,508
I know this is a lot.

596
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:55,554
I might not have believed it
if she didn't tell me herself.

597
00:50:56,388 --> 00:50:58,014
What are you talking about?

598
00:50:58,515 --> 00:51:00,600
I was sitting right here
in this seat,

599
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:03,061
deep in my research...

600
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:06,148
and she spoke to me.

601
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,693
It was like
she was standing in this room.

602
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,696
I could feel her breath
on my cheek

603
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:14,740
and her hand on my back.

604
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:18,535
She told me she needs my help.

605
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:21,496
To do what?

606
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:24,666
To save her from her people.

607
00:51:27,836 --> 00:51:29,671
After we fell in love,

608
00:51:29,755 --> 00:51:32,466
your mother wanted us
to live in Ta Lo.

609
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,634
She asked permission
from the elders,

610
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:35,886
and they refused.

611
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:38,263
They said I wasn't worthy.

612
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:41,391
She would still be with us.

613
00:51:41,475 --> 00:51:44,102
We would all be
living there together.

614
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:46,605
Ta Lo did this to us.

615
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:51,026
They locked her behind
that gate to punish her.

616
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:56,698
Don't you see?

617
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:59,743
She's leaving clues for us.

618
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,369
She wants us to find her

619
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:04,289
and bring her home,
so we can be a family again.

620
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:07,834
Dad, Mom's gone.

621
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:11,129
She's not talking to you
from behind a gate,

622
00:52:11,213 --> 00:52:13,507
and she's not leaving
any clues for us.

623
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,847
Then what are these?

624
00:53:07,352 --> 00:53:11,022
The passage to Ta Lo
is guarded by a moving maze.

625
00:53:12,065 --> 00:53:15,193
But there's a direct path
through the forest

626
00:53:15,277 --> 00:53:17,362
that only opens once a year

627
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:19,447
on Qingming Jie.

628
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:22,951
To get through,
you need to know the route

629
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:25,412
and the exact time it opens.

630
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,459
Now I know both.

631
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:45,265
Three days from now,

632
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:47,809
we will rescue
my wife from her prison

633
00:53:47,893 --> 00:53:49,102
and bring her home.

634
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:57,444
This is why you're here.

635
00:53:58,361 --> 00:53:59,946
To help me
bring her back to us.

636
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,824
And what happens if they don't
let you open the gate?

637
00:54:04,451 --> 00:54:07,871
We'll burn the village
to the ground.

638
00:54:09,915 --> 00:54:10,916
What?

639
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:15,921
You can't just march
into our mom's village

640
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:17,422
with this bullshit.

641
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,299
I mean, do you have
any idea how insane...

642
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:25,639
Hey!

643
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:31,061
Where are you taking me?

644
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:34,731
When will you stop pretending?

645
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:38,610
Lock them up.

646
00:54:58,254 --> 00:55:01,424
It's okay, my dear.

647
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:12,519
We're all going to be
together soon.

648
00:55:21,111 --> 00:55:25,907
So, um,
pretty confused right now,

649
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:29,619
because, uh, initially
I thought your dad should

650
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:31,746
definitely see a therapist
for his delusions,

651
00:55:31,955 --> 00:55:35,542
but then that dragon
vomited a magical water map,

652
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:38,670
and now I have no idea
what's real.

653
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:43,425
Is what he said
about your mom's village true?

654
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:48,555
She used to tell us stories
about Ta Lo

655
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:49,639
when we were kids.

656
00:55:50,682 --> 00:55:54,894
A village in another dimension
full of magical creatures.

657
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:56,980
I thought
it was just a fairy tale.

658
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,775
What if Dad's right?

659
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:03,903
About Mom being locked
behind a gate

660
00:56:03,987 --> 00:56:05,947
by her own people?

661
00:56:06,114 --> 00:56:08,366
Crazier things
have turned out to be true.

662
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:11,745
Look, I don't know
what the hell is going on,

663
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,330
but if we don't find a way
to get to Ta Lo before him,

664
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:16,916
he's gonna destroy everything
that's left of our family.

665
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:22,088
This family was destroyed
a long time ago.

666
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,053
The hell was that?

667
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:30,305
Oh.

668
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,640
You're going
toward that noise?

669
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,455
"Wake Duncan
with thy knocking.

670
00:56:55,622 --> 00:56:58,583
"Oh, I would'st
though could'st.

671
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,293
"My deed 'twere best not..."

672
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:05,256
Oh, hello, loves.

673
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:07,842
What year is it?

674
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:10,720
Who are you?

675
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:13,014
Trevor? Slattery?

676
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:15,600
The actor from Liverpool?

677
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:17,519
Wait.

678
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:19,229
Are you the governor's kids?

679
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:21,523
I've been preparing
a monologue

680
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:23,274
for your homecoming dinner.

681
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,318
Oh. Where's she going?

682
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:26,653
Why are you down here?

683
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,780
Well, some time ago,

684
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,406
I was offered
the role of a terrorist.

685
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:32,867
I know, facile, trite,
I couldn't agree more.

686
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:34,953
But times were lean,
you know what I mean?

687
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,872
Anyway, the producer told me
he worked for the BBC.

688
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:39,499
But, ironic twist,

689
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:42,168
it turns out he, in fact,
was a terrorist,

690
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:43,837
and I wasn't playing
a character at all,

691
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:45,296
but what I now recognise to be

692
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,340
a rather unflattering portrait
of your father.

693
00:57:47,757 --> 00:57:49,509
We all got our just deserts.

694
00:57:49,676 --> 00:57:51,553
The producer
got blown up by Iron Man,

695
00:57:51,636 --> 00:57:53,304
and I served time
in federal prison,

696
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:56,307
which turned out
to be the best thing for me.

697
00:57:56,391 --> 00:57:58,810
I got clean,
I rediscovered my passion.

698
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:01,563
- Then my dad broke you out?
- Exactly.

699
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:03,815
- To kill you.
- Exactly.

700
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:06,901
But just as his men

701
00:58:06,985 --> 00:58:09,612
were tying me up
for my execution,

702
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:11,656
I launched into a performance
of my Macbeth.

703
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,366
"Whence is that knocking?
Wake Duncan

704
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:14,951
"with thy knocking.
I would'st though could'st..."

705
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:16,202
They couldn't
get enough of it.

706
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:18,788
I've been doing weekly gigs
for the lads ever since.

707
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:20,832
So you're like his jester?

708
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:22,667
I can give you a quick preview
if you like.

709
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,002
"Nuncle, nuncle, nuncle..."

710
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:26,462
Uh, thank you, Trevor.
I think we're okay.

711
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,506
Right now, we really just
need to find a way to...

712
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,008
What the hell?

713
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:31,217
What the... Oh!

714
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:32,343
- Whoa!
- What is that?

715
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:35,054
What's what?

716
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:37,015
- That! What is that?
- That! That! That!

717
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,685
You can see Morris?

718
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:41,853
Morris?

719
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:44,606
Oh, Morris!

720
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:47,108
They can see you! You're real!

721
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:50,320
All this time I thought
I was hallucinating him.

722
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:51,988
Oh, this is such fab news.

723
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,073
Where's his face?

724
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,368
He's a bit sensitive
about that.

725
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:00,205
Oh. Really?

726
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:03,458
Morris says he knows
who you are.

727
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:05,501
It talks... It talks to you?

728
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:07,128
If he didn't talk to me,

729
00:59:07,212 --> 00:59:09,047
I'd have gone mad yonks ago.

730
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:11,799
How would he know me?

731
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:14,802
He says he grew up
with your mum. In Ta Lo.

732
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:18,765
Apparently, your father picked
him up in some magic forest

733
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:21,643
on one of his expeditions
to find the entrance.

734
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:26,898
He wants you to take him home.

735
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:31,527
Believe me, buddy,
I would if I knew how.

736
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:33,238
According to my dad,

737
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,073
the path there
only opens once a year.

738
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:40,745
Oh.

739
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:44,540
Morris says he can guide you
there right now.

740
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:45,917
You can get through the maze

741
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,585
without waiting
for the path to open.

742
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:49,754
But, and it's a big "but,"

743
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:51,965
it's very dangerous.

744
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:53,132
How dangerous?

745
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:55,218
No one's ever
made it out alive.

746
00:59:55,385 --> 00:59:58,179
But Morris is 90% confident

747
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:00,098
he can guide us
through safely.

748
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:01,724
Oh.

749
01:00:01,808 --> 01:00:03,309
19%.

750
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:08,314
Look, I've done dumber things
with worse odds.

751
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:10,191
But even if
that chicken-pig is right...

752
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,360
...we're still locked
in your...

753
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:19,701
Whew!

754
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:23,955
How did you...

755
01:00:24,122 --> 01:00:26,541
Dad has a tunnel system
under the whole compound.

756
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,459
That's how
I escaped last time.

757
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:29,627
Oh.

758
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:31,754
This will take us
straight to the garage.

759
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:45,310
Oh, my God.

760
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:46,978
I kinda like this guy.

761
01:00:47,145 --> 01:00:48,980
Just head up that ramp
and through the front gate.

762
01:00:49,147 --> 01:00:50,273
Should be a straight shot.

763
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:52,066
Figure we got about
30 seconds until he...

764
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:53,234
Do you mind?

765
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:55,361
I get sick in the back.
Carsick.

766
01:00:58,573 --> 01:00:59,741
That's my car!

767
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,331
God damn it.

768
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:07,623
Hold on.

769
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,168
Is there another exit?

770
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:11,502
The other end of the garage.

771
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:13,171
But we need a fingerprint
to open it.

772
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:21,304
Incoming!

773
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,806
Shit!

774
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:47,163
What's happening
back there?

775
01:01:48,498 --> 01:01:49,582
Doing my best.

776
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:51,501
<i>Scan
hand print for gate access.</i>

777
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:53,878
- Hurry up!
- I'm trying!

778
01:01:56,214 --> 01:01:57,298
<i>Scan hand print
for gate access.</i>

779
01:01:57,382 --> 01:01:58,383
Shaun!

780
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,135
<i>Access approved.</i>

781
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:22,281
They will come back
once I bring her home.

782
01:02:24,117 --> 01:02:25,868
Prepare the men for war.

783
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:27,912
Yes, sir.

784
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:36,421
The first time
I witnessed pure artistry.

785
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:40,550
1968. <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

786
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:42,718
I was sitting in the cinema
next to my mum,

787
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:44,262
watching mastery

788
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:46,305
unfold before my very eyes.

789
01:02:46,472 --> 01:02:48,599
After the film, I asked her,

790
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:51,185
"How did they get those
monkeys to do those things?"

791
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:54,147
And she patted me on the head
and she said,

792
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:57,191
"It's not real, pet.
It's just acting."

793
01:02:57,358 --> 01:02:59,068
That's when I knew.

794
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:01,571
If they can teach
those monkeys

795
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:03,573
to act that brilliantly,

796
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,493
just imagine what I could
bring to the world.

797
01:03:08,077 --> 01:03:09,203
So you became an actor

798
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:11,289
because you thought
the monkeys were actually...

799
01:03:11,456 --> 01:03:14,125
Riding horses? I did. Yes.

800
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:15,877
When, in fact,

801
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,046
they were simply acting
as if they were riding horses.

802
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:21,424
I still can't get my head
round it, to be honest.

803
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:24,260
Good for you, dude.

804
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:28,264
You found your passion
and went for it,

805
01:03:28,431 --> 01:03:29,515
and eventually used it

806
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,642
to cripple the US government,
but whatever.

807
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:33,769
Yeah.
No, yeah, thanks.

808
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:35,855
Um, this is really cool
and all,

809
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:37,398
but how long
do we have to sit here?

810
01:03:37,565 --> 01:03:39,025
Morris is very clear.

811
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:41,486
The way through
is all about timing.

812
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:43,696
Okay, but how long
are we talking?

813
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,573
Like, hours? Days?

814
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,367
Friends,
I am but a transitory vessel

815
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:49,869
for the infinite wisdom
of a creature

816
01:03:50,036 --> 01:03:52,288
far more advanced than
we'll ever truly understand.

817
01:03:52,914 --> 01:03:54,540
What he sees, what he feels

818
01:03:54,624 --> 01:03:56,334
of this vast, unknown universe

819
01:03:56,501 --> 01:03:58,419
is beyond anything
our simple brains can...

820
01:03:58,503 --> 01:03:59,921
Oh. You can go.

821
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:01,380
What?

822
01:04:01,464 --> 01:04:03,257
Go. You can go. He says "go."

823
01:04:26,489 --> 01:04:27,949
You should speed up.

824
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:29,617
What? Why?

825
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:32,995
Katy, go, go, go!

826
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:38,084
Morris says,

827
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:40,044
- "Hard right on three."
- What?

828
01:04:40,211 --> 01:04:41,212
Two...

829
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:42,296
Hard right where?

830
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,756
Now.

831
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:52,306
And left.

832
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:58,312
It's all about staying
in the pocket.

833
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:00,147
- What pocket?
- We're in it now.

834
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:01,983
What happens if
we don't stay in the pocket?

835
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,150
The forest eats us.

836
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:04,777
Eats us? What does that mean?

837
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:06,487
He says it eats us.
Go left.

838
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:16,747
- Watch your back!
- Stay in the pocket.

839
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:18,499
- How close is it?
- Five metres.

840
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:20,418
- Stay in the pocket.
- What is that in feet?

841
01:05:20,585 --> 01:05:21,586
Really fricking close.

842
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:22,753
Stay in the pocket.

843
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,463
Will you just stop saying,
"Stay in the pocket"?

844
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:33,180
One last right,
then straight on to the end.

845
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,565
You might wanna hurry up.

846
01:05:42,732 --> 01:05:44,567
What do you think I'm doing?

847
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:47,236
We're not gonna make it.

848
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:51,991
I'm coming home, Mummy.

849
01:06:04,295 --> 01:06:07,256
Morris says,
"Great job, everyone."

850
01:06:08,674 --> 01:06:11,552
Now, all we have to do
is go through that waterfall,

851
01:06:11,719 --> 01:06:13,512
and we're pretty much there.

852
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:04,897
Bloody hell.

853
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:06,816
I think those birds
are on fire.

854
01:07:06,899 --> 01:07:09,276
Really? Oh.

855
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,779
Morris says it's normal.

856
01:07:11,946 --> 01:07:14,281
They're old mates of his.

857
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,192
That's a weird horse.

858
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,362
What's it looking at me for?

859
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:59,011
Hi there!

860
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,180
I am Xu Shang-Chi.

861
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:04,600
This is my sister, Xu Xialing.

862
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:07,311
We're Ying Li's children.

863
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:12,691
This is my friend, Katy.

864
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:16,487
Get in your car and go home!

865
01:09:16,654 --> 01:09:19,156
Please. You don't understand.

866
01:09:24,245 --> 01:09:25,496
Whoa.

867
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:26,997
Guang Bo!

868
01:09:28,374 --> 01:09:30,543
What are you doing?

869
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:33,337
Put down your weapons!

870
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:37,967
Shang-Chi.

871
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:39,552
Xialing.

872
01:09:39,718 --> 01:09:42,972
I'm your aunty Nan.

873
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:47,434
I've waited so long to meet you.

874
01:09:57,111 --> 01:09:58,737
You look like your mother.

875
01:10:06,579 --> 01:10:07,705
Hi, I'm Katy.

876
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:09,290
Welcome to Ta Lo, Katy.

877
01:10:09,373 --> 01:10:10,958
Oh, thank you.

878
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:19,258
Look who has found
his way home!

879
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:21,176
I'm not a threat.

880
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:23,470
Just an entertainer.

881
01:10:23,637 --> 01:10:25,222
Morris can vouch for me.

882
01:10:27,182 --> 01:10:28,559
We don't have much time.

883
01:10:29,018 --> 01:10:30,352
Our father is coming.

884
01:10:38,444 --> 01:10:41,405
Our people have been
here for over 4,000 years,

885
01:10:41,572 --> 01:10:44,366
preparing for something
we hope will never happen.

886
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:47,077
We are the keepers
of the Dark Gate,

887
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:49,622
sworn to protect this realm
and yours

888
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:52,291
from the evil
that's locked behind it.

889
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:55,336
Our dad is coming
here to open that gate.

890
01:10:55,878 --> 01:10:57,880
He thinks
you're holding our mom there.

891
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:00,674
Why would he think that?

892
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:02,051
She told him.

893
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:04,261
He says he can hear her
asking for help.

894
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,682
Is he wearing the rings?

895
01:11:08,849 --> 01:11:10,976
He hasn't
taken them off since she died.

896
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,521
What do they have to do
with all this?

897
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:20,527
The realm of Ta Lo
stretches far beyond

898
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:22,488
the shores
of our small village.

899
01:11:22,655 --> 01:11:26,325
We have cities that surpass
any in your universe,

900
01:11:26,492 --> 01:11:29,203
rich with culture and history.

901
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,372
Thousands of years ago,

902
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:34,792
all of our people
lived in peace and prosperity,

903
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:39,004
until the attack
of the Dweller-in-Darkness.

904
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,048
He came with his army,

905
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:44,176
devouring every soul
in their path,

906
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:48,013
and with each kill,
they grew stronger.

907
01:11:48,681 --> 01:11:51,225
After decimating
our largest cities,

908
01:11:51,392 --> 01:11:54,812
they were headed to
your universe to do the same.

909
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:58,357
The leaders of Ta Lo sent
their strongest warriors here

910
01:11:58,524 --> 01:12:01,735
to stop them from reaching
the portal to your world.

911
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:05,447
But our ancestors
were no match for them.

912
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:09,576
Until The Great Protector

913
01:12:09,702 --> 01:12:13,247
joined their fight
and turned the tide.

914
01:12:13,956 --> 01:12:16,959
Together, they pushed
the Dweller and his army

915
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:18,252
into the Dark Gate

916
01:12:18,419 --> 01:12:20,879
and locked it behind them.

917
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,260
Our people have guarded
that gate ever since,

918
01:12:26,427 --> 01:12:29,888
empowered by the magic
of The Great Protector

919
01:12:30,055 --> 01:12:32,349
and the gift that she gave us.

920
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:44,987
Dragon scales.

921
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:46,822
Makes very good armour.

922
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:50,993
Your father isn't the first
to come here

923
01:12:51,076 --> 01:12:52,327
to open the Dark Gate.

924
01:12:52,911 --> 01:12:55,164
Many have tried and failed
over the centuries,

925
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:57,666
and they all had one thing
in common.

926
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:58,834
They were lured here

927
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:01,045
by the voice of something
on the other side.

928
01:13:01,837 --> 01:13:04,715
A voice that promised them
their greatest desires.

929
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:11,346
So you think soul eaters
are talking to our dad?

930
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:15,476
They know The Ten Rings have
the power to break them free.

931
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:20,814
Oh.

932
01:13:23,442 --> 01:13:25,027
Here you go.

933
01:13:25,277 --> 01:13:26,278
Oh.

934
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,280
To the range.

935
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:31,492
What? Okay.

936
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:34,912
Um, looks like I'm gonna go
deliver some dragon arrows.

937
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,538
Oh, you're gonna deliver
some dragon arrows?

938
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:37,915
Yeah.
Make myself useful, you know.

939
01:13:38,082 --> 01:13:39,083
Thank you.

940
01:13:41,126 --> 01:13:42,836
Let's go see your mother.

941
01:13:57,518 --> 01:14:00,104
I just love how you guys know
exactly what you wanna do,

942
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:03,107
and you spend your whole life
getting really good at it.

943
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:04,858
I wish I was more like that.

944
01:14:05,025 --> 01:14:07,111
It's like every time I get
moderately good at something,

945
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:09,530
I just quit
and start something new.

946
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:11,615
But I just know my own limits,

947
01:14:11,782 --> 01:14:14,409
and I'm not gonna waste
my time chasing something

948
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:16,328
that will ultimately be
a disappointment for me.

949
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:17,454
That's not me.

950
01:14:17,538 --> 01:14:18,997
Guang Bo.

951
01:14:20,249 --> 01:14:21,583
Let her shoot.

952
01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:28,632
If you aim at nothing,
you hit nothing.

953
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:53,740
You were everything to her.

954
01:14:55,409 --> 01:14:57,870
She knew that one day
you would find your way here

955
01:14:58,036 --> 01:15:00,789
and asked me to prepare
something for your arrival.

956
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:25,272
After losing someone like her,

957
01:15:25,355 --> 01:15:27,983
it's easy to feel alone
in this world.

958
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,319
But you're not.

959
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:32,738
You are children
of this family,

960
01:15:33,322 --> 01:15:35,657
and I welcome you home.

961
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:05,145
You're not
in your father's house any more.

962
01:16:06,897 --> 01:16:11,026
In Ta Lo, we train as equals.

963
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:16,657
You've been in the shadows
long enough, my child.

964
01:16:36,051 --> 01:16:37,261
Guang Bo, you saw that?

965
01:16:38,011 --> 01:16:39,346
That was tight!

966
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:54,653
My mother was the only one
who could beat him.

967
01:16:56,238 --> 01:16:58,031
Show me how she did it.

968
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:06,790
No, sorry.

969
01:17:06,957 --> 01:17:08,542
Sorry. Offside, offside.

970
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:11,480
Your mother knew
who she was.

971
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,398
Do you?

972
01:19:19,423 --> 01:19:22,467
You are a product
of all who came before you.

973
01:19:23,427 --> 01:19:27,264
The legacy of your family,
the good and the bad,

974
01:19:28,056 --> 01:19:30,392
it is all a part
of who you are.

975
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:36,857
Stop hiding, nephew.

976
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:39,734
It only prolongs the pain.

977
01:20:12,184 --> 01:20:14,728
We'll be together soon.

978
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:22,152
Sir.

979
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:26,323
The men are ready.

980
01:20:27,365 --> 01:20:29,159
The passage will open at dawn.

981
01:20:30,118 --> 01:20:31,745
I'll prepare the vehicles.

982
01:20:55,894 --> 01:20:57,854
Lead with your breath.

983
01:20:58,313 --> 01:21:01,274
Look into your heart,

984
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:04,778
the light and the dark.

985
01:21:04,945 --> 01:21:09,032
To know yourself,

986
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:13,119
you must face them both.

987
01:21:28,218 --> 01:21:30,136
Your husband tried to destroy us.

988
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:33,390
The Iron Gang is here
to repay that debt.

989
01:21:34,015 --> 01:21:35,934
My husband is not the man
he used to be.

990
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:38,103
It doesn't matter.

991
01:21:39,354 --> 01:21:42,607
Your business with him has nothing
to do with my children.

992
01:21:45,527 --> 01:21:47,404
They can go,

993
01:21:47,571 --> 01:21:51,366
but someone has to pay.

994
01:21:56,037 --> 01:21:57,872
Xialing. Shang-Chi.

995
01:21:58,039 --> 01:21:59,040
Go inside.

996
01:21:59,165 --> 01:22:01,960
I'm going to talk to our guests.

997
01:22:07,966 --> 01:22:10,802
But you don't have your powers.

998
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:15,557
Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear.

999
01:23:37,806 --> 01:23:39,015
Mama.

1000
01:23:41,643 --> 01:23:42,811
Mama.

1001
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:02,539
Papa.

1002
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,884
She told me I could change.

1003
01:24:16,386 --> 01:24:19,639
That I could leave my past behind.

1004
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:24,561
But she was wrong.

1005
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:30,400
If I hadn't taken them off,

1006
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:35,280
those men wouldn't have
dared to do this.

1007
01:24:37,741 --> 01:24:40,493
And now they will pay for it.

1008
01:25:34,923 --> 01:25:35,965
Where's your boss?

1009
01:25:36,424 --> 01:25:37,425
I don't know!

1010
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:39,427
I swear I don't!

1011
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:42,597
Okay.

1012
01:25:55,944 --> 01:26:00,698
A blood debt has to be
paid by blood.

1013
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:03,326
Will you help me?

1014
01:26:33,273 --> 01:26:34,482
We found the man

1015
01:26:34,566 --> 01:26:36,651
responsible for killing
your mother.

1016
01:26:37,861 --> 01:26:40,947
It is your right
to finish this for both of us.

1017
01:26:42,073 --> 01:26:43,700
And when you return,

1018
01:26:43,867 --> 01:26:47,370
we will rebuild The Ten Rings
to what it once was.

1019
01:27:08,892 --> 01:27:10,518
Been looking
everywhere for ya.

1020
01:27:18,443 --> 01:27:19,652
You okay?

1021
01:27:24,032 --> 01:27:27,410
I'm not who you think I am.

1022
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:29,412
You already apologised
for that. We're good...

1023
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:31,539
That's not what
I'm talking about.

1024
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:35,043
Okay.

1025
01:27:36,628 --> 01:27:38,421
What... What is it?

1026
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:48,848
When my dad sent me to find
the man who killed my mom...

1027
01:27:51,559 --> 01:27:53,770
I told you
I couldn't go through with it.

1028
01:27:58,816 --> 01:28:00,318
I lied.

1029
01:28:04,572 --> 01:28:06,866
I thought that
I could change my name,

1030
01:28:07,033 --> 01:28:09,953
start a new life, pretend like
it never happened.

1031
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:11,329
But...

1032
01:28:18,252 --> 01:28:20,505
She would hate
the person I've become.

1033
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:29,430
Your dad trained you
to be an assassin

1034
01:28:29,514 --> 01:28:31,432
when you were seven.

1035
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:35,770
He sent you on a hit at 14.

1036
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:40,108
You realise how messed up
that is, right?

1037
01:28:43,736 --> 01:28:46,239
My mom is dead because of him.

1038
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,953
And now he's coming
to destroy her home.

1039
01:29:01,337 --> 01:29:04,590
A blood debt
has to be paid by blood.

1040
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:09,262
What are you saying?

1041
01:29:12,807 --> 01:29:15,018
I'm gonna do
what he trained me to do.

1042
01:29:21,024 --> 01:29:22,567
I'm gonna kill him.

1043
01:30:10,031 --> 01:30:11,032
He's here.

1044
01:30:23,377 --> 01:30:24,378
No!

1045
01:30:24,462 --> 01:30:25,713
You're not ready.

1046
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,924
She stays here.

1047
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:23,229
Are you here
to help the people

1048
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,773
holding your own mother
captive?

1049
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:27,775
She isn't back there.

1050
01:31:28,151 --> 01:31:29,152
You're being lied to

1051
01:31:29,235 --> 01:31:31,404
by a creature
who wants to destroy us all.

1052
01:31:32,864 --> 01:31:34,949
Is that what they told you?

1053
01:31:35,533 --> 01:31:38,161
I know my wife's voice.

1054
01:31:38,369 --> 01:31:40,913
I miss my sister
as much as you do,

1055
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,666
but this is not the way
to honour her memory.

1056
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:45,626
Did you honour her
when you turned her away

1057
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:46,711
from your gate?

1058
01:31:46,836 --> 01:31:49,338
You fool. We turned you away.

1059
01:31:49,505 --> 01:31:52,049
The sins of your past would have
destroyed this place.

1060
01:31:52,383 --> 01:31:56,679
Be careful how you speak to me,
young man.

1061
01:31:57,096 --> 01:32:00,892
I've lived ten of your lifetimes.

1062
01:32:02,435 --> 01:32:04,061
Let me pass.

1063
01:32:04,395 --> 01:32:06,439
We cannot do that.

1064
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:26,584
Burn it down.

1065
01:33:30,523 --> 01:33:31,649
Stop him!

1066
01:34:07,268 --> 01:34:10,271
Are you planning to stop me
all by yourself?

1067
01:34:14,608 --> 01:34:16,027
I'm not afraid of you.

1068
01:34:23,326 --> 01:34:24,535
Yes, you are.

1069
01:34:30,166 --> 01:34:33,586
You've spent
your entire life afraid.

1070
01:34:33,753 --> 01:34:35,796
Always running,

1071
01:34:35,963 --> 01:34:37,256
always hiding.

1072
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,648
You were there
when they came for her,

1073
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:56,984
and you did nothing.

1074
01:34:57,568 --> 01:35:00,446
You stood at a window
and watched her die!

1075
01:35:35,272 --> 01:35:36,982
She was gone
and we needed you.

1076
01:35:38,192 --> 01:35:41,404
But you chose those damn rings
over us.

1077
01:35:45,491 --> 01:35:46,992
You trained your son
to be a killer.

1078
01:35:48,202 --> 01:35:49,328
Is this what you wanted?

1079
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,389
Even if you could
bring her back,

1080
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:12,810
what makes you think she'd
want anything to do with you?

1081
01:36:38,419 --> 01:36:40,129
Save me.

1082
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:43,466
Save me, my dear.

1083
01:37:03,277 --> 01:37:05,154
Save me.

1084
01:37:05,613 --> 01:37:08,032
I'm coming, my love.

1085
01:37:49,615 --> 01:37:50,824
He breached the gate!

1086
01:37:55,287 --> 01:37:56,497
Those things
are gonna kill us all

1087
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,165
if we don't work together.

1088
01:37:58,332 --> 01:38:00,376
You think
I'm going to fall for that?

1089
01:38:00,543 --> 01:38:02,711
Your weapons are useless
against them.

1090
01:38:03,170 --> 01:38:04,797
We don't need your help.

1091
01:38:05,339 --> 01:38:07,591
We are the mighty Ten Rings,

1092
01:38:07,675 --> 01:38:09,093
and any...

1093
01:38:33,784 --> 01:38:36,370
We... We should work together.

1094
01:38:36,537 --> 01:38:38,581
Release them.

1095
01:38:38,747 --> 01:38:40,499
Release them!

1096
01:38:46,255 --> 01:38:47,548
What are they doing?

1097
01:38:47,715 --> 01:38:50,175
Stealing souls to
feed the Dweller-in-Darkness.

1098
01:38:50,301 --> 01:38:51,677
If it grows strong enough,

1099
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,178
it will break
right through the gate.

1100
01:38:53,345 --> 01:38:55,306
That was just the beginning.

1101
01:38:58,225 --> 01:38:59,518
It's too dangerous.

1102
01:38:59,685 --> 01:39:00,936
I have to help my friends.

1103
01:39:05,232 --> 01:39:07,234
Don't die.

1104
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:11,071
Everyone to the water now!

1105
01:39:11,155 --> 01:39:12,364
To the lake! Let's go!

1106
01:39:12,448 --> 01:39:13,657
Let's go!

1107
01:39:15,784 --> 01:39:17,828
Hey, where's your brother?

1108
01:39:17,995 --> 01:39:19,705
I was hoping you knew.

1109
01:39:27,588 --> 01:39:28,589
Save me.

1110
01:39:53,155 --> 01:39:56,075
Aim at the sky,
to win or die!

1111
01:40:09,838 --> 01:40:11,590
Deep breath.

1112
01:40:27,272 --> 01:40:29,733
Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear.

1113
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:33,070
You have the heart
of our dragon.

1114
01:40:33,862 --> 01:40:37,199
I will always be a part of you.
And your dad will too.

1115
01:40:37,825 --> 01:40:41,954
Take everything we've given you
and make it your own.

1116
01:40:59,221 --> 01:41:01,473
I'm so proud of you.

1117
01:41:05,811 --> 01:41:08,230
Our family needs you.

1118
01:41:09,648 --> 01:41:10,649
Go.

1119
01:42:04,787 --> 01:42:06,538
Draw.

1120
01:42:10,501 --> 01:42:11,835
Fire!

1121
01:42:39,238 --> 01:42:41,156
You have to stop your father!

1122
01:43:12,271 --> 01:43:14,398
She's not back there, Dad.

1123
01:43:15,858 --> 01:43:19,695
Get out of my way, boy.

1124
01:43:20,946 --> 01:43:21,947
No.

1125
01:44:25,761 --> 01:44:27,012
Calm down, mate.

1126
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:28,639
I'm not dead,
it's just a performance.

1127
01:44:28,805 --> 01:44:30,432
Now get down here
and play along.

1128
01:47:13,804 --> 01:47:15,555
I have to save her.

1129
01:47:17,265 --> 01:47:19,142
She's calling to me.

1130
01:47:22,646 --> 01:47:24,231
I wish that were true.

1131
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:28,735
Dad, please.

1132
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:32,989
Your family needs you.

1133
01:47:42,124 --> 01:47:43,875
Let me out!

1134
01:48:14,489 --> 01:48:15,574
Shit.

1135
01:49:58,176 --> 01:49:59,469
It's headed for the village!

1136
01:51:49,412 --> 01:51:51,873
If it gets our dragon's soul,

1137
01:51:51,956 --> 01:51:53,750
it will be unstoppable!

1138
01:51:56,795 --> 01:51:58,296
Aim for the throat!

1139
01:52:46,636 --> 01:52:48,430
You have to let me go.

1140
01:52:55,687 --> 01:52:57,230
Let go!

1141
01:52:59,149 --> 01:53:00,900
I'm not leaving you again.

1142
01:53:19,169 --> 01:53:20,462
Holy shit.

1143
01:53:52,619 --> 01:53:54,496
Go.

1144
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:03,666
<i>Tonight,</i>

1145
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:05,501
<i>we honour those
who gave their lives</i>

1146
01:56:05,585 --> 01:56:07,378
so we might see another day.

1147
01:56:08,921 --> 01:56:10,590
They were more than warriors.

1148
01:56:11,716 --> 01:56:15,136
They were our mothers
and fathers,

1149
01:56:15,303 --> 01:56:18,014
our sisters and brothers.

1150
01:56:19,182 --> 01:56:22,518
And though we will always
hold on to their memories,

1151
01:56:24,145 --> 01:56:28,691
tonight we release them
to rest with our ancestors.

1152
01:56:35,531 --> 01:56:37,325
Farewell, Dad.

1153
01:56:38,201 --> 01:56:39,827
Mum, we'll be okay.

1154
01:56:42,205 --> 01:56:43,998
A thousand years ago,

1155
01:56:44,457 --> 01:56:46,793
and a thousand years from now,

1156
01:56:47,543 --> 01:56:50,380
we will always be together.

1157
01:57:32,755 --> 01:57:34,424
<i>I seriously thought
we were going to die.</i>

1158
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:35,967
And I'd only learned
how to shoot a bow,

1159
01:57:36,050 --> 01:57:37,301
like, a day earlier,

1160
01:57:37,468 --> 01:57:38,594
now I'm on a battlefield,

1161
01:57:38,678 --> 01:57:40,972
killing all these Soul Suckers
with Shaun's aunty,

1162
01:57:41,139 --> 01:57:43,349
who's this awesome,
magical kung fu goddess.

1163
01:57:43,516 --> 01:57:44,934
And I'm hanging on
to The Great Protector

1164
01:57:45,017 --> 01:57:46,018
with my sister at this point,

1165
01:57:46,102 --> 01:57:48,104
trying not to get eaten
by the Mega Soul Sucker.

1166
01:57:48,271 --> 01:57:50,565
Oh, the Mega Soul Sucker
was such a nasty bitch.

1167
01:57:50,732 --> 01:57:52,233
Yeah. It was trying
to eat our dragon's soul.

1168
01:57:52,316 --> 01:57:53,317
Which would have
allowed it

1169
01:57:53,401 --> 01:57:54,444
to destroy
the entire universe.

1170
01:57:54,527 --> 01:57:55,528
Yeah.

1171
01:57:55,611 --> 01:57:56,779
I only had
one arrow left,

1172
01:57:56,863 --> 01:57:58,740
and all I could hear
in the back of my mind

1173
01:57:58,906 --> 01:58:00,366
was my mom's voice saying,

1174
01:58:00,533 --> 01:58:02,744
"Just take the shot,
you little mooch!"

1175
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:05,413
And so, I aimed
right for the Sucker's throat

1176
01:58:05,496 --> 01:58:07,415
- and I let her fly.
- She hit it dead on.

1177
01:58:07,749 --> 01:58:09,083
And then Shaun used
the Ten Rings

1178
01:58:09,167 --> 01:58:11,836
to do this crazy
Kamehameha fireball

1179
01:58:11,919 --> 01:58:13,463
that exploded the thing...

1180
01:58:13,546 --> 01:58:15,465
...and he saved the world.

1181
01:58:16,799 --> 01:58:19,635
Yeah, we, uh, lost
some good people that day...

1182
01:58:21,804 --> 01:58:23,139
but we made it.

1183
01:58:23,639 --> 01:58:25,016
We made it.

1184
01:58:26,726 --> 01:58:28,186
Are you done mocking me?

1185
01:58:28,394 --> 01:58:30,229
Oh, no. We're not mocking you.

1186
01:58:30,396 --> 01:58:31,773
So where is this sister
of yours?

1187
01:58:31,939 --> 01:58:33,858
She's back
at my dad's compound,

1188
01:58:33,941 --> 01:58:35,109
shutting down his operations.

1189
01:58:35,276 --> 01:58:36,861
Yeah, his dad was the head
of The Ten Rings

1190
01:58:36,944 --> 01:58:38,446
for the past thousand years.

1191
01:58:39,989 --> 01:58:42,033
Two weeks ago, you were
parking cars for tips,

1192
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:44,494
and you want me to believe
you're now saving the world

1193
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:46,454
from soul-sucking monsters?

1194
01:58:47,121 --> 01:58:48,372
I know, you're trying
to get me back

1195
01:58:48,456 --> 01:58:50,124
for what I said last time,
but I'm not gonna apologise...

1196
01:58:51,292 --> 01:58:52,627
...for speaking the truth
as a friend.

1197
01:58:52,794 --> 01:58:55,421
I really meant what I said,
and, in fact, I actually think

1198
01:58:55,588 --> 01:58:57,924
this whole bit you're doing
just further proves my point.

1199
01:58:58,090 --> 01:58:59,217
You guys are obviously...

1200
01:59:00,510 --> 01:59:02,136
- What?
- Shang-Chi.

1201
01:59:04,889 --> 01:59:06,182
Shang-Chi.

1202
01:59:07,266 --> 01:59:08,810
Uh... Here.

1203
01:59:08,976 --> 01:59:09,977
Present.

1204
01:59:13,689 --> 01:59:14,816
My name is Wong.

1205
01:59:16,067 --> 01:59:18,236
Yeah, I know, sir.
I'm a huge fan...

1206
01:59:18,402 --> 01:59:19,862
Do you have the rings?

1207
01:59:21,364 --> 01:59:22,824
Uh... Yeah, yes.

1208
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:25,952
Good. Let's go,
we have a lot to talk about.

1209
01:59:26,452 --> 01:59:27,537
You too.

1210
01:59:30,331 --> 01:59:31,332
Me too?

1211
01:59:34,544 --> 01:59:36,504
- I think we should...
- Yeah.

1212
01:59:36,587 --> 01:59:38,881
- Uh, we gotta go.
- Yeah.

1213
01:59:40,174 --> 01:59:43,594
I know this is, like, crazy,
but I'm gonna text you,

1214
01:59:43,761 --> 01:59:46,639
and we'll do this again.
Nice to see you, John.

1215
01:59:46,806 --> 01:59:48,683
I'll Venmo you for the...

1216
02:00:07,493 --> 02:00:09,662
<i>You was crusin' with your top down
Fourth of July</i>

1217
02:00:09,745 --> 02:00:12,623
<i>I was movin' down the block
We got caught at the light</i>

1218
02:00:12,707 --> 02:00:16,002
<i>Out my window
I was shooting my shot</i>

1219
02:00:17,086 --> 02:00:18,963
<i>Watching fireworks in the sky</i>

1220
02:00:20,006 --> 02:00:23,050
<i>I'm calling it now
I'm calling it now</i>

1221
02:00:23,175 --> 02:00:24,552
<i>I'm calling it now</i>

1222
02:00:24,677 --> 02:00:27,555
<i>You'll find love with me somehow</i>

1223
02:00:27,638 --> 02:00:30,349
<i>Yes, somehow
I'm calling it now</i>

1224
02:00:30,975 --> 02:00:34,145
<i>In the summers we let the top down
Soak up the light</i>

1225
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:37,273
<i>All I wanted was just to lock down
the love of my life</i>

1226
02:00:37,356 --> 02:00:40,318
<i>Nice and simple
like a midnight drive</i>

1227
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:43,946
<i>Watching fireworks in the sky</i>

1228
02:00:44,447 --> 02:00:46,991
<i>I'm calling it now
I'm calling it now</i>

1229
02:00:47,074 --> 02:00:48,743
<i>I'm calling it now</i>

1230
02:00:48,951 --> 02:00:51,954
<i>You'll find love with me somehow</i>

1231
02:00:52,121 --> 02:00:55,041
<i>Yes, somehow
I'm calling it now</i>

1232
02:00:56,918 --> 02:01:00,588
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1233
02:01:01,339 --> 02:01:06,093
<i>Every line, every word
every noun and verb can define you</i>

1234
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:12,725
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1235
02:01:13,726 --> 02:01:16,354
<i>You were shy
but you told me to pull over</i>

1236
02:01:16,437 --> 02:01:18,564
<i>And now I'm right behind you</i>

1237
02:01:19,607 --> 02:01:22,818
<i>We was movin' kinda fast
but the feeling was right</i>

1238
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:25,696
<i>We should cruise up to Nevada
Get married tonight</i>

1239
02:01:25,821 --> 02:01:28,950
<i>Life is simple
as long as you're in my life</i>

1240
02:01:29,951 --> 02:01:32,787
<i>Watching fireworks in the sky</i>

1241
02:01:32,912 --> 02:01:35,831
<i>I'm calling it now
I'm calling it now</i>

1242
02:01:35,915 --> 02:01:37,333
<i>I'm calling it now</i>

1243
02:01:37,416 --> 02:01:40,419
<i>You'll find love with me somehow</i>

1244
02:01:40,544 --> 02:01:43,673
<i>Yes, somehow
I'm calling it now</i>

1245
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,273
Hmm.

1246
02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:05,778
They don't match any artefacts
from our codex.

1247
02:02:07,154 --> 02:02:08,572
What do you think?

1248
02:02:08,656 --> 02:02:10,533
Mm, I'm not sure.

1249
02:02:12,827 --> 02:02:15,955
They're not vibranium.
Chitauri?

1250
02:02:17,373 --> 02:02:19,792
Not like any alien tech
I've seen.

1251
02:02:20,793 --> 02:02:21,919
How long did your dad
have them

1252
02:02:22,003 --> 02:02:23,504
before he gave them to you?

1253
02:02:24,714 --> 02:02:26,007
Um...

1254
02:02:26,090 --> 02:02:27,675
About a thousand years.

1255
02:02:27,967 --> 02:02:29,677
Their thermoluminescence
indicates

1256
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,095
they're older than that.

1257
02:02:31,303 --> 02:02:32,888
By a lot.

1258
02:02:33,139 --> 02:02:35,391
The first time
you used the rings,

1259
02:02:35,766 --> 02:02:38,185
we felt it in Kamar-Taj.

1260
02:02:46,902 --> 02:02:48,362
What is it?

1261
02:02:48,487 --> 02:02:49,947
A beacon.

1262
02:02:50,114 --> 02:02:52,033
They're sending
a message.

1263
02:02:53,743 --> 02:02:55,786
A message to where?

1264
02:02:58,330 --> 02:03:00,332
I'm so sorry.
I have to deal with this.

1265
02:03:00,541 --> 02:03:01,625
You can get my number
from Bruce.

1266
02:03:01,709 --> 02:03:03,127
It was so nice to meet you.

1267
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:07,339
Yeah, I...
I don't have her number.

1268
02:03:07,757 --> 02:03:09,925
She... She does this a lot.

1269
02:03:10,676 --> 02:03:12,887
Guys, stay safe.

1270
02:03:13,846 --> 02:03:16,098
Welcome to the circus.

1271
02:03:22,772 --> 02:03:25,316
I know this is a lot
to take in,

1272
02:03:25,483 --> 02:03:27,943
but you're gonna have
to start getting used to that.

1273
02:03:28,444 --> 02:03:31,489
From now on,
the trajectory of your lives

1274
02:03:31,655 --> 02:03:34,742
will be like nothing you've
ever experienced before.

1275
02:03:35,576 --> 02:03:37,578
And there's no going back.

1276
02:03:39,497 --> 02:03:41,665
You both have a long journey
ahead of you.

1277
02:03:42,458 --> 02:03:45,086
Go home, get some rest.

1278
02:03:47,129 --> 02:03:48,506
Yeah. That's a good idea.

1279
02:03:48,589 --> 02:03:51,634
Yeah. Yeah,
we probably should do that.

1280
02:03:53,135 --> 02:03:54,512
Or...

1281
02:03:57,056 --> 02:04:00,101
<i>Welcome to the Hotel California</i>

1282
02:04:01,936 --> 02:04:05,064
<i>- Such a lovely place
- Such a lovely place</i>

1283
02:04:05,231 --> 02:04:08,651
<i>- Such a lovely face
- Such a lovely face</i>

1284
02:04:10,402 --> 02:04:12,822
<i>Plenty of room at the Hotel California</i>

1285
02:04:15,407 --> 02:04:18,494
<i>- Any time of year
- Any time of year</i>

1286
02:04:18,661 --> 02:04:20,037
<i>You can find it here</i>

1287
02:04:22,123 --> 02:04:24,583
<i>Her mind is Tiffany-twisted</i>

1288
02:04:25,334 --> 02:04:28,337
<i>She got the Mercedes bends, uh</i>

1289
02:04:28,671 --> 02:04:34,385
<i>She got a lot of pretty,
pretty boys she calls friends</i>

1290
02:04:35,719 --> 02:04:40,808
<i>How they dance in the courtyard,
sweet summer sweat</i>

1291
02:04:41,851 --> 02:04:47,857
<i>Some dance to remember,
some dance to forget</i>

1292
02:04:48,482 --> 02:04:54,071
<i>So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine"</i>

1293
02:04:54,196 --> 02:05:00,786
<i>He said, "We haven't had
that spirit here since 1969"</i>

1294
02:05:01,495 --> 02:05:07,418
<i>And still those voices
