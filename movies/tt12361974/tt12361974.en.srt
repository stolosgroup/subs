1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,373
Um... But before you see
Justice League, I wanted to say

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:08,819
a huge thank you to all of the
fans that made this possible.

3
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:13,031
Your amazing and generous
support for AFSP,

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,108
your incredible passion for
this vision that you're about

5
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:21,374
to get a chance to see, and
that you made happen.

6
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:26,937
So on behalf of myself and
Debbie, thank you so much,

7
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:29,857
and check it out,
it's streaming now.

10
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,251
Alert the queen.

11
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:07,231
Hyah!

12
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:39,800
Bruce Vayne.

13
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,551
Bruce Wayne.

14
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:00,904
Talk.

15
00:10:02,197 --> 00:10:03,824
I believe there is a stranger.

16
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:06,618
Comes to this village
from the sea.

17
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:09,788
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

18
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:12,082
He brings fish.

19
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:13,917
He comes on the king tide.

20
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:15,127
That was last night.

21
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:24,136
You have eyes, so see.

22
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:25,846
Icebergs in the harbor.

23
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:28,974
It's four months since
the last ship got through.

24
00:10:29,057 --> 00:10:33,520
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.

25
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:43,989
There are enemies
coming from far away.

26
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:46,825
I need warriors.

27
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:50,579
This stranger, others like him.

28
00:10:50,704 --> 00:10:54,916
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

29
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:58,337
It's very important
that I see this man.

30
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:01,506
If this stranger exists,

31
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:03,925
he'll give him your message.

32
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,260
$5,000 American.

33
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:07,012
Look, I'll give you $25,000

34
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:10,223
to talk to this man
right now, outside.

35
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:27,240
How dare this dog
speak to us like children.

36
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:31,078
Ooh, magical man from the sea.

37
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:34,122
We are poor, not stupid.

38
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:35,957
Get out.

39
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,543
I'm sorry.

40
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:40,378
Can't do that.

41
00:11:40,462 --> 00:11:42,756
I'll leave after we've spoken.

42
00:11:47,427 --> 00:11:48,887
He said, "Get out."

43
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:09,699
Arthur Curry.

44
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:12,786
Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.

45
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,038
The Aquaman.

46
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:22,254
So, let me
get this straight.

47
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:26,133
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

48
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,051
Worked for 20 years in Gotham.

49
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:29,803
Oh, that shithole.

50
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,805
When the fight comes,
we'll need you.

51
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,349
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

52
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:36,560
'Cause I don't like you coming
here, digging into my business

53
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:39,312
and getting into my life.
I want to be left alone.

54
00:12:39,438 --> 00:12:41,022
Is that why you do this?

55
00:12:41,148 --> 00:12:42,649
Why you help these people out
here in the middle of nowhere?

56
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:43,984
I've read the stories.

57
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:46,361
Your good deeds
you think no one sees.

58
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:47,863
You'll join us.

59
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:49,990
"Strong man
is strongest alone."

60
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:51,533
You ever heard that?

61
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:53,118
You ever hear
of Superman?

62
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:54,870
He died fighting next to me.

63
00:12:56,163 --> 00:12:57,497
My point exactly.

64
00:12:57,664 --> 00:12:59,958
He believed
we were stronger together.

65
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,585
We owe it to him.

66
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,045
I don't owe anyone anything.

67
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:14,347
Dressed like a bat.

68
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:16,474
You're out of your mind,
Bruce Wayne.

69
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:46,106
Move over, Dusty.

70
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,956
My God, Master Wayne,
but this is cold.

71
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:49,544
Maybe we can catch
the next king tide in Jamaica?

72
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:51,880
Might be
a metahuman or two in Fiji.

73
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:53,673
Costa Rica's nice.

74
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,342
I found him.

75
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,347
He said no.

76
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,849
So the draft stands
at naught for two?

77
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,854
Maybe a man who broods
in a cave for a living

78
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:11,733
isn't cut out to be
a recruiter. Hmm?

79
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:33,088
That's $10, please.

80
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:12,335
Good morning, Miss Lane.

81
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,837
Jerry, hi.

82
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:16,506
Wow.

83
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:17,966
You don't miss a day, do you?

84
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:21,261
Like it here.

85
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:07,867
Excuse me.

86
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,537
Move!

87
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:22,924
Move it! Move it!

88
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:31,683
- No, mate, don't shoot!
- Move, move!

89
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,393
Get the fuck over there!

90
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:37,021
Move! All of ya!

91
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:49,534
Line them up
along the wall.

92
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:52,245
Keep them quiet.

93
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,831
- Keep quiet!
- Shut up! Shut up!

94
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:56,416
Shut them up too!

95
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:01,963
We'll be making
a statement shortly.

96
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:03,965
Until then,
if I see any movement,

97
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,217
you'll have a lot of dead kids
on your hands.

98
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:22,734
Should I take him?

99
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:24,485
Hold your fire.

100
00:20:25,945 --> 00:20:27,155
They've got kids in there.

101
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,825
Yeah,
he's not bluffing, chief.

102
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,244
St. Brigid's had
a school trip today.

103
00:20:57,185 --> 00:20:58,978
Quiet! Shut up!

104
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:06,527
Down with the modern world.

105
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:08,237
Back to the Dark Ages.

106
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,619
Quiet!

107
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:19,332
I said shut your fucking mouth.

108
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:35,139
Who are you?

109
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:38,226
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

110
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:40,728
Now, who are you?

111
00:21:40,853 --> 00:21:44,065
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists

112
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,650
who wanna turn back
the clock in Europe

113
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:48,194
- a thousand years.
- Boring. Why the hostages?

114
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:49,862
We have no demands.

115
00:21:49,946 --> 00:21:51,864
We're just stalling the police
while we do it.

116
00:21:51,948 --> 00:21:53,408
While you do what?

117
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:57,537
You're too late.
The countdown's already begun.

118
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,165
In a few minutes,
four city blocks...

119
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,545
...while the world watches.

120
00:23:45,144 --> 00:23:46,312
No!

121
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:48,356
Like lambs
to the slaughter.

122
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:39,031
I don't believe it.

123
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:40,324
Believe it.

124
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:18,779
Is everyone all right?
Are you okay?

125
00:25:18,905 --> 00:25:20,865
Good. It's okay.

126
00:25:20,907 --> 00:25:23,242
It's okay. It's over.
You can stand up.

127
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:24,577
It's all good.

128
00:25:24,744 --> 00:25:26,787
It's over now.
Are you okay?

129
00:25:26,913 --> 00:25:28,956
You okay? Good.

130
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:35,922
Are you okay, princess?

131
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,302
Can I be like you someday?

132
00:25:43,304 --> 00:25:45,932
You can be anything
you want to be.

133
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:50,353
Come on. Let's go.

134
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:34,271
Any changes today?

135
00:26:34,313 --> 00:26:35,898
No, my Queen.

136
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:39,443
The Mother Box has awoken,

137
00:26:39,527 --> 00:26:42,530
yet nothing has happened.

138
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:44,907
It has slept
for thousands of years

139
00:26:45,032 --> 00:26:46,993
since the First Age.

140
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:48,494
Why did it wake at all?

141
00:26:56,085 --> 00:26:58,129
This is the first time
it's gone quiet

142
00:26:58,212 --> 00:26:59,463
since the crack appeared.

143
00:26:59,505 --> 00:27:02,425
Maybe it's going back to sleep.

144
00:27:06,387 --> 00:27:08,306
Evil does not sleep.

145
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:11,017
It waits.

146
00:27:12,393 --> 00:27:14,520
Something is coming.

147
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,068
Prepare for battle!

148
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:49,263
Amazons,
on your marks!

149
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:50,765
Ready!

150
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:17,958
Defenders.

151
00:28:19,543 --> 00:28:24,215
They have failed 100,000 worlds.

152
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:25,883
They always fail.

153
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:32,473
I've come to enlighten you
to the great darkness.

154
00:28:32,598 --> 00:28:35,643
I will bathe in your fear.

155
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:39,647
Daughters of Themyscira,

156
00:28:40,773 --> 00:28:42,399
show him your fear!

157
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:45,027
We have no fear!

158
00:29:04,338 --> 00:29:05,965
Gather the legions!

159
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:08,092
Go with her!

160
00:29:08,175 --> 00:29:09,468
You must seal the cage!

161
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:11,929
- Go!
- Phillipus!

162
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:39,832
No!

163
00:29:52,344 --> 00:29:53,554
Behind you!

164
00:29:57,349 --> 00:29:58,726
Ahhh!

165
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:02,021
Epione.

166
00:30:03,814 --> 00:30:06,025
Honor us. It's right.

167
00:30:09,028 --> 00:30:10,237
Seal it.

168
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:18,162
Ready the hammers!

169
00:30:30,424 --> 00:30:32,510
Seal it now!

170
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:08,397
Guard it with your life.

171
00:32:08,522 --> 00:32:10,482
- Yes, my Queen.
- Keep it moving.

172
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:12,026
Hyah! Hyah!

173
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,152
Hyah!

174
00:34:56,607 --> 00:34:58,192
Got it! Go!

175
00:34:59,318 --> 00:35:00,611
Hyah!

176
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:25,260
Oh, noble Queen.
Why do you fight?

177
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,015
You can't save her.

178
00:35:30,098 --> 00:35:32,851
You can't save any of them.

179
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:40,150
The great darkness begins.

180
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:41,985
Amazons!

181
00:35:52,204 --> 00:35:55,040
Yes, we will find the others.

182
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:59,378
Draw!

183
00:36:01,547 --> 00:36:02,881
Loose!

184
00:37:00,772 --> 00:37:02,733
He's gone back to his universe.

185
00:37:02,816 --> 00:37:03,984
No.

186
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,822
He's gone to the lands of men

187
00:37:08,947 --> 00:37:12,117
to find the other two boxes.

188
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,287
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.

189
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:18,957
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

190
00:37:19,082 --> 00:37:20,626
Men won't know what it means.

191
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:23,045
Men won't.

192
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:26,173
She will.

193
00:37:56,828 --> 00:37:59,498
It's toxic.

194
00:37:59,665 --> 00:38:01,375
That's good.

195
00:38:22,354 --> 00:38:23,313
Go!

196
00:38:23,438 --> 00:38:25,691
Follow the scent
of the Mother Boxes.

197
00:38:25,816 --> 00:38:27,275
Find the missing two.

198
00:38:27,401 --> 00:38:31,321
Once they are found,
The Unity will be formed.

199
00:38:31,405 --> 00:38:34,366
This world will join the others.

200
00:38:36,118 --> 00:38:38,203
He will be pleased.

201
00:38:38,286 --> 00:38:41,373
He will see my worth again.

202
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:45,585
Hey.

203
00:38:45,711 --> 00:38:48,588
Anything on that kid
from the liquor store?

204
00:38:48,714 --> 00:38:50,215
Possibly.

205
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:53,051
"Possibly."

206
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:55,595
If I had a dollar
for every "possibly."

207
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:58,598
Yeah, it would make you
even more insufferable.

208
00:39:01,435 --> 00:39:04,229
Facial scan might have
got a hit on him,

209
00:39:04,312 --> 00:39:06,565
our disappearing man.

210
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:11,445
One Mr. Barry Allen
from Central City.

211
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,071
Might be another false positive,

212
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:14,531
you'll have to give me
a little time

213
00:39:14,614 --> 00:39:17,200
- to confirm.
- We don't have any more time.

214
00:39:18,744 --> 00:39:20,370
Master Wayne,

215
00:39:20,495 --> 00:39:22,956
you've been working
as if there's no tomorrow

216
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:24,166
to build this team

217
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,168
of people you can't even find.

218
00:39:26,293 --> 00:39:28,420
I found one.
I found two, including Diana.

219
00:39:28,503 --> 00:39:30,547
Just because Lex Luthor says

220
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,507
the planet's
in danger of attack?

221
00:39:32,632 --> 00:39:34,801
This has nothing
to do with Lex Luthor.

222
00:39:34,926 --> 00:39:36,261
It has to do with him.

223
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:40,390
I made a promise to him
on his grave.

224
00:39:40,474 --> 00:39:43,602
I spent a lot of time
trying to divide us.

225
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:47,272
I need to bring us together
and make this right.

226
00:39:47,397 --> 00:39:50,108
Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.

227
00:39:50,275 --> 00:39:54,446
No attacks.
No barbarians at the gate.

228
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:58,075
Maybe these barbarians
don't use a gate.

229
00:39:58,158 --> 00:39:59,826
Maybe they're already here.

230
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:05,624
Keep looking.
What else do you have?

231
00:40:44,538 --> 00:40:46,122
Lab's all yours, Howard.

232
00:40:46,248 --> 00:40:47,999
11:30.

233
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,584
Early night for you, Silas.

234
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:52,170
Yes, early night.

235
00:40:52,295 --> 00:40:53,505
Tell your family I said hello.

236
00:41:28,915 --> 00:41:30,542
What the...

237
00:41:34,254 --> 00:41:35,380
Jesus.

238
00:42:48,662 --> 00:42:51,456
The Arrow of Artemis.

239
00:42:51,581 --> 00:42:54,334
It will reach the lands of men.

240
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:05,136
Sky torch,

241
00:43:05,303 --> 00:43:06,972
hero beacon,

242
00:43:07,055 --> 00:43:08,598
scatter the darkness.

243
00:43:08,723 --> 00:43:12,310
Burn as you burned
in days before.

244
00:43:13,645 --> 00:43:17,482
Show her the darkness before
the daylight of history.

245
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:21,444
Warn my daughter
that war has come

246
00:43:22,779 --> 00:43:24,489
and protect her.

247
00:43:49,097 --> 00:43:51,516
Return to me, Diana.

248
00:44:29,888 --> 00:44:32,932
<i>What did you do
this weekend, Diana?</i>

249
00:44:33,058 --> 00:44:35,018
Nothing very interesting.

250
00:44:35,143 --> 00:44:37,812
That's all you ever tell us.

251
00:44:37,937 --> 00:44:41,316
What can I do?
I'm not that exciting.

252
00:44:41,441 --> 00:44:45,612
You might as well disappear
when you walk out of here.

253
00:44:50,116 --> 00:44:51,117
Again?

254
00:44:51,242 --> 00:44:53,328
- What is it?
- Now what?

255
00:44:53,453 --> 00:44:56,581
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.

256
00:44:56,664 --> 00:44:59,417
Now add to the list "arson."

257
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,712
<i>Yes, good morning</i>

258
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:04,297
<i>from the isle of Crete.</i>

259
00:45:04,422 --> 00:45:05,924
<i>As you can see behind me,</i>

260
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:08,259
<i>an enormous bonfire is burning.</i>

261
00:45:08,385 --> 00:45:10,720
<i>This fire has been burning
through the night.</i>

262
00:45:10,804 --> 00:45:12,138
<i>We're now into the morning</i>

263
00:45:12,263 --> 00:45:14,641
<i>and we are
at least five miles away.</i>

264
00:45:14,766 --> 00:45:18,061
<i>And we can still
see it burning as we speak.</i>

265
00:45:18,144 --> 00:45:21,439
<i>This has baffled locals and
government authorities alike</i>

266
00:45:21,564 --> 00:45:23,399
<i>here at this historical site</i>

267
00:45:23,483 --> 00:45:25,944
<i>of the so-called shrine
of the Amazons.</i>

268
00:45:26,111 --> 00:45:27,904
<i>Now, locals and government
officials are baffled as to</i>

269
00:45:27,987 --> 00:45:30,406
- <i>what may have caused this.</i>
- Invasion.

270
00:45:39,332 --> 00:45:40,458
Ryan.

271
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:41,835
- Hiya, Doc.
- Is the...

272
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,962
No damage to the electron-laser.

273
00:45:44,087 --> 00:45:46,339
- Uh, Dr. Silas Stone?
- Yeah.

274
00:45:46,464 --> 00:45:48,299
- Ryan Choi?
- That's us.

275
00:45:48,425 --> 00:45:50,635
Um, who did this?
Did they steal anything?

276
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,262
They took whatever was in here.

277
00:45:52,303 --> 00:45:56,391
That? Oh, that wasn't stolen.
Was it, Dr. Stone?

278
00:45:56,516 --> 00:45:59,144
No. That was misplaced
a while ago.

279
00:45:59,227 --> 00:46:03,273
Object 6-1-9-8-2. Department
of Defense Archives.

280
00:46:03,314 --> 00:46:05,483
- Mmm-hmm.
- What was it?

281
00:46:05,608 --> 00:46:06,568
I don't know.

282
00:46:06,693 --> 00:46:07,986
You don't know?

283
00:46:08,153 --> 00:46:10,155
I don't know, which was why
I was studying it.

284
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,906
What's your rank, Doctor?

285
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:14,200
Ryan, would you, uh,
do the honors?

286
00:46:14,325 --> 00:46:15,827
- Sure. Okay.
- Thanks.

287
00:46:15,952 --> 00:46:18,455
Civilian. STARLABS
is a private contractor.

288
00:46:18,538 --> 00:46:19,664
We work for the DoD.

289
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:22,625
We advise them on xeno-science.

290
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:24,377
"Xeno-science"?

291
00:46:24,502 --> 00:46:26,504
Alien technology.

292
00:46:33,428 --> 00:46:35,472
For example,

293
00:46:35,597 --> 00:46:37,223
the Superman ship.

294
00:46:45,565 --> 00:46:46,858
Eight people

295
00:46:46,941 --> 00:46:48,651
never signed out
of the lab last night, Doctor.

296
00:46:48,693 --> 00:46:49,903
Cleaning staff, guards,

297
00:46:50,028 --> 00:46:52,197
a few of
your research scientists.

298
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,239
They were abducted.

299
00:46:54,532 --> 00:46:55,658
Are you sure?

300
00:46:55,783 --> 00:46:58,161
Witness saw it all.
He escaped.

301
00:46:58,244 --> 00:47:01,748
He's here in quarantine now,
working on an ID sketch.

302
00:47:04,584 --> 00:47:09,047
Any idea who
or what that might be?

303
00:47:28,983 --> 00:47:31,152
The box isn't safe here.

304
00:47:33,613 --> 00:47:35,073
Victor,

305
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:37,367
they came looking for it
at the lab.

306
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:42,205
People were taken by some kind
of monster or something.

307
00:47:44,832 --> 00:47:46,918
You know a lot about monsters,

308
00:47:47,502 --> 00:47:49,003
don't you?

309
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:58,096
Especially how to make 'em.

310
00:50:57,942 --> 00:51:01,821
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

311
00:51:03,322 --> 00:51:06,784
My hull is breached.
I'm going down.

312
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:13,875
Mayday!

313
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,169
Is there anybody out there?

314
00:51:21,466 --> 00:51:22,508
Ahh!

315
00:51:56,501 --> 00:51:57,668
Whiskey.

316
00:52:06,636 --> 00:52:09,430
Tell him to respect
the storm next time.

317
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:19,816
It's on him.

318
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,757
King who would be man.

319
00:54:49,882 --> 00:54:53,344
Son of a human father
and Queen of the Seas.

320
00:54:54,095 --> 00:54:55,680
All the time I've wasted

321
00:54:55,846 --> 00:54:59,225
trying to keep the promise
I made to your mother.

322
00:55:01,185 --> 00:55:02,520
Are you finished,
old man?

323
00:55:02,603 --> 00:55:05,022
You never sleep
in the same place twice,

324
00:55:05,189 --> 00:55:08,109
yet you keep coming back here.

325
00:55:09,944 --> 00:55:11,904
I like it. It's quiet.

326
00:55:12,029 --> 00:55:13,906
It's your inheritance.

327
00:55:14,031 --> 00:55:16,242
You're the rightful king
of Atlantis.

328
00:55:17,243 --> 00:55:18,536
Our people suffer.

329
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:20,454
Your people.

330
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:24,208
A brutal, petty,
superstitious race.

331
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,502
Is the surface any different?

332
00:55:26,585 --> 00:55:28,754
Nobody calls me
King of the Surface.

333
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,008
What do you want, Vulko?

334
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:33,342
Guards near
the stronghold

335
00:55:33,384 --> 00:55:35,052
have been disappearing.

336
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:36,679
Snatchers from above.

337
00:55:36,762 --> 00:55:38,013
Talk to King Orm.

338
00:55:38,097 --> 00:55:39,515
- Your brother?
- Half-brother.

339
00:55:39,598 --> 00:55:42,977
He's trying to fan the flames
of war with the surface.

340
00:55:43,102 --> 00:55:45,688
He lies.

341
00:55:45,771 --> 00:55:48,024
The snatchers have come
from the dark place.

342
00:55:48,107 --> 00:55:50,568
They're looking for it.

343
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:55,031
The Mother Box
our people guard is not safe.

344
00:55:55,114 --> 00:55:57,616
Go to the stronghold
of Atlantis.

345
00:55:57,742 --> 00:55:59,243
Protect the box.

346
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:01,412
The time has come.

347
00:56:03,414 --> 00:56:05,541
Take up your mother's trident.

348
00:56:16,552 --> 00:56:20,431
You can't turn your back
on the world forever, Arthur.

349
00:56:21,223 --> 00:56:24,226
Above or below.

350
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,091
DeSaad.

351
00:56:55,132 --> 00:56:59,303
DeSaad! I call to thee.

352
00:57:08,145 --> 00:57:13,317
Steppenwolf,
have you begun the conquest?

353
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:16,487
This world is divided.

354
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,155
They are a primitive species.

355
00:57:18,322 --> 00:57:20,783
Unevolved and at war
with one another.

356
00:57:20,866 --> 00:57:23,619
Too separate to be one.

357
00:57:23,661 --> 00:57:26,163
Their free will
must be ripped from them,

358
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:28,165
like the other worlds.

359
00:57:28,249 --> 00:57:32,545
Given absolution
in one glorious belief,

360
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:34,421
to serve him.

361
00:57:35,047 --> 00:57:37,341
The Mother Boxes?

362
00:57:37,508 --> 00:57:40,469
I have found one of the three.

363
00:57:40,553 --> 00:57:43,138
The one that woke
and called to me.

364
00:57:43,222 --> 00:57:44,682
The other two still sleep,

365
00:57:44,807 --> 00:57:48,894
but the parademons
feel their presence.

366
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:50,479
They fly,

367
00:57:50,563 --> 00:57:53,983
they search, they take
prisoners who carry the scent,

368
00:57:54,066 --> 00:57:59,363
while I build a stronghold
in the name of his glory.

369
00:57:59,864 --> 00:58:01,740
Yes.

370
00:58:02,867 --> 00:58:06,704
Mighty Steppenwolf,

371
00:58:06,787 --> 00:58:11,458
who might have sat here
by the side of the great one.

372
00:58:13,252 --> 00:58:17,840
But undone by his self-pride.

373
00:58:19,049 --> 00:58:20,509
DeSaad...

374
00:58:21,427 --> 00:58:24,388
I fall before you.

375
00:58:24,513 --> 00:58:26,390
Let me make a plea to him

376
00:58:26,473 --> 00:58:28,392
that I may come home

377
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,604
after I take this world
in his name.

378
00:58:31,729 --> 00:58:34,231
You betrayed him.

379
00:58:35,399 --> 00:58:37,026
Your own family.

380
00:58:37,109 --> 00:58:39,320
I saw my mistake.

381
00:58:39,445 --> 00:58:41,906
I slaughtered those
who sought his throne.

382
00:58:42,031 --> 00:58:47,453
You still owe the great one
50,000 more worlds.

383
00:58:48,412 --> 00:58:50,539
He will hear your plea

384
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:52,958
when you pay your debt.

385
00:58:55,794 --> 00:58:58,964
The Mother Boxes
will be found and united.

386
00:58:59,965 --> 00:59:02,051
No protectors here.

387
00:59:02,176 --> 00:59:05,554
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

388
00:59:05,638 --> 00:59:09,558
This world will fall,
like all the others.

389
00:59:10,434 --> 00:59:12,394
For Darkseid.

390
00:59:15,397 --> 00:59:17,733
For Darkseid.

391
00:59:38,796 --> 00:59:40,714
You know,
I paid millions of dollars

392
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:42,466
for this building's security.

393
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:44,301
You got
your money's worth.

394
00:59:44,426 --> 00:59:46,887
Took me almost a minute
to disable it.

395
00:59:48,347 --> 00:59:49,765
Hi there.

396
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:52,518
A new toy?

397
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:55,562
Prototype troop carrier.

398
00:59:57,147 --> 00:59:58,607
I once knew a man

399
00:59:58,649 --> 01:00:01,276
who would have loved to fly it.

400
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,153
The best minds
at Wayne Aerospace

401
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,530
couldn't make it fly.

402
01:00:05,447 --> 01:00:07,116
But you can?

403
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:08,826
I have no choice.

404
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:11,745
I need more range
and I need more cargo.

405
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,956
I think
there's an attack coming.

406
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:15,833
Not coming, Bruce.

407
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,169
It's already here.

408
01:00:19,294 --> 01:00:20,963
From what I've learned,

409
01:00:21,005 --> 01:00:23,966
they are things
from another universe.

410
01:00:24,008 --> 01:00:26,343
They serve a dark power.

411
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:28,262
An old power.

412
01:00:28,387 --> 01:00:29,680
What do they want?

413
01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:33,851
To invade.
To conquer.

414
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:38,480
They came here once before,
long ago.

415
01:00:43,444 --> 01:00:45,821
<i>A great armada
appeared in the sky,</i>

416
01:00:45,904 --> 01:00:48,407
<i>laying waste
to all who opposed it.</i>

417
01:00:48,532 --> 01:00:52,870
<i>The leader of the invaders
was a being called Darkseid.</i>

418
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:57,958
<i>A name cursed and feared
in every universe.</i>

419
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:02,171
<i>Darkseid was met in battle
by Earth's defenders.</i>

420
01:01:02,212 --> 01:01:05,007
<i>The old gods, men...</i>

421
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:08,552
<i>Atlanteans before
their descent into the sea...</i>

422
01:01:10,721 --> 01:01:14,725
<i>Amazons before their betrayal
and enslavement</i>

423
01:01:14,808 --> 01:01:17,352
<i>and guardians from the stars.</i>

424
01:01:17,436 --> 01:01:19,354
<i>Their histories
had taught them</i>

425
01:01:19,438 --> 01:01:21,148
<i>not to trust each other,</i>

426
01:01:21,273 --> 01:01:23,359
<i>not to hope for an alliance.</i>

427
01:01:23,484 --> 01:01:25,694
<i>To fight apart.</i>

428
01:02:14,326 --> 01:02:17,371
<i>As Darkseid
waged war on Earth,</i>

429
01:02:17,496 --> 01:02:18,831
<i>he found a secret there.</i>

430
01:02:18,956 --> 01:02:22,751
<i>A power hidden
in the infinity of space.</i>

431
01:02:22,835 --> 01:02:24,336
<i>He called forth mystics</i>

432
01:02:24,461 --> 01:02:27,756
<i>who worshipped and controlled
three objects...</i>

433
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,258
<i>the Mother Boxes.</i>

434
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:30,926
Wait, wait, wait.

435
01:02:31,009 --> 01:02:31,802
"Mother Boxes"?

436
01:02:31,969 --> 01:02:35,055
Indestructible living machines,

437
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:38,016
<i>made from a science so advanced,</i>

438
01:02:38,142 --> 01:02:40,144
<i>it looks like sorcery.</i>

439
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:42,980
<i>To conquer, three boxes
have to synchronize</i>

440
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:46,275
<i>and join together
into The Unity.</i>

441
01:02:46,358 --> 01:02:49,486
<i>The Unity cleanses
a planet with fire,</i>

442
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:53,282
<i>transforming it into a copy
of the enemy's world.</i>

443
01:02:53,365 --> 01:02:57,202
<i>All who live
become servants of Darkseid.</i>

444
01:02:57,327 --> 01:03:00,289
<i>Alive but drained of life.</i>

445
01:03:00,372 --> 01:03:01,874
<i>Parademons.</i>

446
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:05,085
Amazons!

447
01:03:11,008 --> 01:03:12,551
With me!

448
01:03:41,872 --> 01:03:44,499
<i>But before The Unity
could synchronize,</i>

449
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:46,543
<i>the defenders of Earth attacked</i>

450
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:48,420
<i>and fought as one.</i>

451
01:03:48,545 --> 01:03:51,590
<i>Amazons alongside Atlanteans.</i>

452
01:03:51,715 --> 01:03:53,217
<i>Zeus and his son Ares</i>

453
01:03:53,342 --> 01:03:57,012
<i>alongside the guardians
from the sky.</i>

454
01:03:57,095 --> 01:04:00,349
<i>A golden Age of Heroes
fighting together</i>

455
01:04:00,474 --> 01:04:02,017
<i>to defend life on Earth.</i>

456
01:05:58,383 --> 01:06:01,219
<i>They did what no world
had ever done.</i>

457
01:06:01,345 --> 01:06:03,680
<i>Sent the enemies
back into the stars.</i>

458
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:09,853
<i>The three Mother Boxes
never synchronized.</i>

459
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:13,357
The Unity never came to pass.

460
01:06:13,482 --> 01:06:16,026
<i>But, in their retreat,</i>

461
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:19,237
<i>the boxes were left behind
on Earth.</i>

462
01:06:19,363 --> 01:06:23,325
<i>They grew weak.
Dogs without masters</i>

463
01:06:25,202 --> 01:06:26,703
<i>falling asleep,</i>

464
01:06:26,828 --> 01:06:29,206
<i>awaiting their return.</i>

465
01:06:29,331 --> 01:06:31,833
<i>Fading from the view
of the enemy,</i>

466
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:35,212
<i>anonymous
among a trillion worlds.</i>

467
01:06:51,978 --> 01:06:55,524
<i>The defenders of Earth
made a vow.</i>

468
01:06:55,565 --> 01:06:58,860
<i>Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.</i>

469
01:06:58,902 --> 01:07:00,779
<i>Each would enshrine and guard</i>

470
01:07:00,904 --> 01:07:02,698
<i>one of the three
sleeping Mother Boxes</i>

471
01:07:02,781 --> 01:07:06,576
<i>according to the rites
and rituals of their culture</i>

472
01:07:06,743 --> 01:07:09,246
<i>in case a box
should ever wake again</i>

473
01:07:09,413 --> 01:07:11,289
<i>to call out
to the planet Apokolips</i>

474
01:07:11,415 --> 01:07:13,083
<i>to return and conquer</i>

475
01:07:13,166 --> 01:07:17,170
<i>the only world
Darkseid had ever lost.</i>

476
01:08:32,996 --> 01:08:36,124
Something woke the box
my people guard.

477
01:08:36,249 --> 01:08:38,293
It called out
to the dark place...

478
01:08:38,418 --> 01:08:41,129
to one of Darkseid's conquerors.

479
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,132
The enemy is here.

480
01:08:44,216 --> 01:08:45,967
If he's here, where is he?

481
01:08:46,051 --> 01:08:48,178
He'll be searching
for the other two boxes.

482
01:08:48,303 --> 01:08:51,306
Hiding until he has all three.
Until he's ready.

483
01:08:51,389 --> 01:08:55,769
Then we have to be ready.
You, me, the others.

484
01:08:55,894 --> 01:08:58,980
They said the Age of Heroes
would never come again.

485
01:08:59,022 --> 01:09:00,649
No, it will.

486
01:09:00,732 --> 01:09:02,484
It has to.

487
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:07,864
The others.
Where are they?

488
01:09:29,761 --> 01:09:30,720
Am I late?

489
01:09:30,887 --> 01:09:33,390
No, I'm so late.
I'm very late.

490
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:34,975
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

491
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,851
Oh. No.

492
01:09:36,935 --> 01:09:39,896
Okay, bye. Okay.

493
01:09:40,021 --> 01:09:42,399
I'm so sorry.

494
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:43,859
I'm late.

495
01:09:49,114 --> 01:09:50,532
- Are you, uh...
- I'm...

496
01:09:50,615 --> 01:09:52,492
I'm so sorry I'm so late.
I didn't mean to be so late.

497
01:09:52,617 --> 01:09:54,202
I'm me and I'm here
and I'm so sorry I'm late.

498
01:09:54,286 --> 01:09:55,579
Essentially,
the bus didn't come,

499
01:09:55,745 --> 01:09:56,872
then the bus did come,

500
01:09:56,955 --> 01:09:57,914
but then there was
this old woman

501
01:09:58,039 --> 01:09:59,207
counting change for the fare,

502
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:00,625
like, nickel, penny,
nickel, penny.

503
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:02,419
Like, jeez Louise,
let this woman on the bus.

504
01:10:02,544 --> 01:10:03,670
She's 107 years old,

505
01:10:03,837 --> 01:10:05,380
these are some of her
last few moments of life.

506
01:10:05,505 --> 01:10:06,798
Resume.

507
01:10:06,923 --> 01:10:07,924
Resume.

508
01:10:11,094 --> 01:10:13,096
Come on.

509
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:16,725
Come on.

510
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,393
From the French, of course.

511
01:10:18,435 --> 01:10:21,605
<i>"Resume,"</i> I believe,
is a past participle of...

512
01:10:27,027 --> 01:10:28,695
Uh, wow. That's no good.

513
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,447
It's like, what lives
in my pocket, right?

514
01:10:30,572 --> 01:10:33,408
"Paper monster hungry."
Uh...

515
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:44,294
Come on. Supposed to be
friends now.

516
01:10:50,383 --> 01:10:51,968
Yes.

517
01:11:00,644 --> 01:11:03,146
Central City College,
I'm a criminal justice major.

518
01:11:03,313 --> 01:11:04,522
You said you had experience

519
01:11:04,648 --> 01:11:05,649
walking dogs.

520
01:13:46,101 --> 01:13:48,144
Oh, gosh,
I hope everyone's okay.

521
01:13:48,269 --> 01:13:50,939
See, in times of crisis,
for dog work,

522
01:13:51,022 --> 01:13:53,024
I always bring a meat snack.

523
01:13:53,149 --> 01:13:54,859
'Cause it makes them feel calm.

524
01:13:54,984 --> 01:13:56,778
'Cause you never know what's
going to happen in this city.

525
01:13:56,861 --> 01:13:58,321
I mean, oh, my gosh.

526
01:13:58,446 --> 01:14:01,241
Right? I start on Monday?

527
01:14:39,362 --> 01:14:42,198
You have been near a Mother Box.

528
01:14:43,241 --> 01:14:45,827
The scent is on you.

529
01:14:45,869 --> 01:14:47,328
Where is it?

530
01:14:47,412 --> 01:14:51,040
No son or daughter of Atlantis
will ever tell you.

531
01:15:05,847 --> 01:15:07,515
Our people have guarded
the Mother Box

532
01:15:07,599 --> 01:15:08,892
for thousands of years.

533
01:15:14,814 --> 01:15:17,734
I will never betray
my own people.

534
01:15:29,204 --> 01:15:31,748
You already have.

535
01:16:31,891 --> 01:16:34,811
<i>This was taken in
the deepest trench on Earth.</i>

536
01:16:34,936 --> 01:16:37,021
He must be an Atlantean.

537
01:16:37,146 --> 01:16:38,523
A water-breather.

538
01:16:38,648 --> 01:16:40,149
He was breathing air
when I talked to him.

539
01:16:40,233 --> 01:16:42,110
Mixed-blood, then.

540
01:16:42,193 --> 01:16:44,112
He said he'll fight with us?

541
01:16:44,195 --> 01:16:45,655
More or less.

542
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:49,325
More more or more less?

543
01:16:49,409 --> 01:16:50,451
Probably more less.

544
01:16:50,535 --> 01:16:52,620
- He said no?
- He said no.

545
01:16:52,704 --> 01:16:55,331
Atlanteans
can be tricky.

546
01:16:55,456 --> 01:16:58,376
My people went to war
with them once.

547
01:16:59,377 --> 01:17:01,337
I'm not sure we can trust him.

548
01:17:01,462 --> 01:17:02,588
Diana, if we're gonna do this,

549
01:17:02,714 --> 01:17:03,715
you're gonna need to be open

550
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,174
to more things that we didn't...

551
01:17:05,341 --> 01:17:06,509
you know...

552
01:17:06,592 --> 01:17:07,885
- I'm sorry. That's okay.
- Sorry. My fault.

553
01:17:08,011 --> 01:17:09,303
Don't worry about it.

554
01:17:09,345 --> 01:17:10,596
- Let's...
- It happens.

555
01:17:10,722 --> 01:17:12,140
so...

556
01:17:12,181 --> 01:17:13,850
This is the
third person.

557
01:17:13,933 --> 01:17:16,519
Disappears for 1/30
of a second here.

558
01:17:16,602 --> 01:17:18,229
One frame of video, see?

559
01:17:18,354 --> 01:17:21,024
Barry Allen. Central City.

560
01:17:21,107 --> 01:17:22,066
Go to him.

561
01:17:22,191 --> 01:17:23,735
I'll work on number four.

562
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:27,155
Organic and biomechatronic
body parts.

563
01:17:29,574 --> 01:17:31,784
He's a cyborg.

564
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,889
- Ready!
- Break!

565
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:09,739
Three...

566
01:18:09,822 --> 01:18:11,407
eighty...

567
01:18:12,325 --> 01:18:14,577
set... go!

568
01:18:27,423 --> 01:18:29,801
<i>Your son may be captain
of the football team</i>

569
01:18:29,926 --> 01:18:33,179
and a certified genius,
Mrs. Stone...

570
01:18:33,304 --> 01:18:35,473
Dr. Stone.

571
01:18:37,767 --> 01:18:39,769
...but that doesn't mean
he can hack into our system

572
01:18:39,936 --> 01:18:42,647
to change his friend's grades.

573
01:18:42,772 --> 01:18:46,609
Sarah's family
lost their house this year.

574
01:18:46,692 --> 01:18:49,404
How could that child
pass her classes?

575
01:18:50,696 --> 01:18:53,783
Victor helped her
'cause he's got a good heart.

576
01:18:53,866 --> 01:18:56,035
What did you do to help her?

577
01:20:20,036 --> 01:20:23,122
- Your father...
- Mom, Mom, don't.

578
01:20:24,624 --> 01:20:27,418
He got held up at the lab.

579
01:20:27,543 --> 01:20:30,755
Okay. He always does.

580
01:20:33,257 --> 01:20:34,550
He wanted to be here.

581
01:20:34,717 --> 01:20:36,677
You always say that.

582
01:20:36,761 --> 01:20:38,346
Ma, you gotta stop
making excuses for him.

583
01:20:38,387 --> 01:20:41,224
You're just as busy as he is,
but you still make the time.

584
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:45,269
He just has difficulty
showing it, but...

585
01:20:45,394 --> 01:20:47,563
I know he's proud of you.

586
01:20:47,688 --> 01:20:50,274
We both are, Victor.

587
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:53,569
Hey, hey, hey.

588
01:20:53,653 --> 01:20:56,739
With everything I know
you can do today,

589
01:20:56,864 --> 01:20:59,617
I can't wait to see
what you're gonna be tomorrow.

590
01:21:04,914 --> 01:21:06,832
<i>Dr. Stone,
I'm sorry,</i>

591
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:09,752
your wife didn't survive.

592
01:21:11,087 --> 01:21:13,589
I'm afraid
your son won't either.

593
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,230
I won't let you die.

594
01:21:32,275 --> 01:21:33,859
I won't allow it.

595
01:21:40,116 --> 01:21:41,909
I won't allow it.

596
01:21:45,329 --> 01:21:46,289
Victor.

597
01:21:47,623 --> 01:21:50,960
Victor, you're not
stuck in here.

598
01:21:51,085 --> 01:21:54,255
You still have a life
ahead of you.

599
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:58,092
Your mother would have
wanted you to live that life.

600
01:22:00,511 --> 01:22:02,138
If you were there,

601
01:22:03,472 --> 01:22:05,349
Mom would still be alive.

602
01:22:08,269 --> 01:22:10,146
All right, look,

603
01:22:11,314 --> 01:22:13,816
you don't have to give me
a second chance,

604
01:22:13,899 --> 01:22:15,693
but give yourself one.

605
01:22:17,528 --> 01:22:20,781
If you can't stand
looking at me,

606
01:22:22,325 --> 01:22:24,035
try listening.

607
01:22:52,438 --> 01:22:55,191
<i>What you can do now, Victor.</i>

608
01:22:55,358 --> 01:22:59,028
<i>Your physical strength is
just the tip of the iceberg.</i>

609
01:22:59,111 --> 01:23:01,906
<i>The tip of the tip.</i>

610
01:23:31,602 --> 01:23:33,896
<i>In the world
of ones and zeroes,</i>

611
01:23:33,979 --> 01:23:36,690
<i>you are the absolute master.</i>

612
01:23:36,816 --> 01:23:39,568
<i>No firewall can stop you.</i>

613
01:23:39,652 --> 01:23:41,904
<i>No encryption can defy you.</i>

614
01:23:42,029 --> 01:23:44,615
<i>We're all at your mercy, Vic.</i>

615
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:47,284
<i>From our power grids
to our telecommunications,</i>

616
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:49,453
<i>everyone's lives are controlled</i>

617
01:23:49,578 --> 01:23:52,581
<i>and dominated
by complex digital networks</i>

618
01:23:52,665 --> 01:23:57,086
<i>that will bend
without effort to your will.</i>

619
01:24:07,221 --> 01:24:08,889
<i>The fate of the world</i>

620
01:24:08,973 --> 01:24:11,976
<i>will literally
rest in your hands.</i>

621
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:21,777
<i>Its entire nuclear arsenal,</i>

622
01:24:21,861 --> 01:24:24,864
<i>you could launch with a thought.</i>

623
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:36,917
<i>The world's monetary systems</i>

624
01:24:37,001 --> 01:24:38,502
<i>and its complex interactions</i>

625
01:24:38,627 --> 01:24:41,589
<i>will seem as easy
to manipulate for you</i>

626
01:24:41,672 --> 01:24:43,340
<i>as a child's plaything.</i>

627
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:21,170
<i>The question...
No, the challenge</i>

628
01:25:21,921 --> 01:25:25,049
<i>won't be doing it.</i>

629
01:25:25,174 --> 01:25:27,301
<i>It will be not doing.</i>

630
01:25:27,384 --> 01:25:29,386
<i>Not seeing.</i>

631
01:25:31,263 --> 01:25:33,516
<i>It is the burden
of this responsibility</i>

632
01:25:33,641 --> 01:25:37,228
<i>that will define you
and who you choose to be.</i>

633
01:26:08,717 --> 01:26:09,802
<i>Now, make a wish.</i>

634
01:26:11,053 --> 01:26:12,930
<i>One more time.</i>

635
01:26:13,055 --> 01:26:15,558
<i>Good job. Wave to Grandma!</i>

636
01:26:15,683 --> 01:26:16,976
<i>Hi, Grandma!</i>

637
01:27:16,952 --> 01:27:18,245
What?

638
01:27:20,164 --> 01:27:21,999
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

639
01:27:23,042 --> 01:27:24,585
Oh, my God.

640
01:27:24,627 --> 01:27:26,420
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

641
01:27:31,717 --> 01:27:34,428
<i>Victor...</i>

642
01:27:34,511 --> 01:27:39,099
<i>Victor, these are the words</i>
and deductions of a scientist.

643
01:27:39,141 --> 01:27:41,477
<i>That's how I've been
speaking to you.</i>

644
01:27:42,102 --> 01:27:45,105
<i>Now,</i>

645
01:27:45,189 --> 01:27:49,652
<i>let me speak to
you from my heart, not as a scientist,</i>

646
01:27:49,777 --> 01:27:51,111
<i>as a father.</i>

647
01:28:05,417 --> 01:28:06,502
Hey.

648
01:28:07,711 --> 01:28:09,296
Hey, you!

649
01:28:24,937 --> 01:28:28,440
<i>Because you are
holding yourself back.</i>

650
01:28:28,565 --> 01:28:31,610
You're going in circles, man.

651
01:28:31,735 --> 01:28:34,071
Holding down
three dead-end jobs,

652
01:28:34,196 --> 01:28:35,322
going on four.

653
01:28:35,406 --> 01:28:36,865
Where do you even find the time?

654
01:28:37,032 --> 01:28:38,200
I make the time.

655
01:28:38,325 --> 01:28:39,618
- I just need one more gig...
- Barry.

656
01:28:39,743 --> 01:28:40,703
...then I'm gonna pay
for my own tuition.

657
01:28:40,786 --> 01:28:41,829
You can't.

658
01:28:41,954 --> 01:28:43,247
Like I always said
I would.

659
01:28:43,372 --> 01:28:44,707
You cannot keep
doing this to yourself.

660
01:28:44,873 --> 01:28:46,500
Okay. I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

661
01:28:46,583 --> 01:28:48,002
- Please, we have 10 minutes.
- And this is all to pay

662
01:28:48,085 --> 01:28:49,294
for a criminal justice degree,
huh?

663
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:50,421
Yeah.

664
01:28:50,546 --> 01:28:51,588
For what?

665
01:28:51,714 --> 01:28:54,633
Huh, let's see.
As I talk to my father,

666
01:28:54,758 --> 01:28:56,385
who's still in prison
for the murder

667
01:28:56,468 --> 01:28:57,886
of my mother,
which he didn't commit.

668
01:28:58,012 --> 01:28:59,930
Yeah, how did I get interested
in criminal justice?

669
01:29:00,055 --> 01:29:01,682
I can't remember.

670
01:29:01,765 --> 01:29:03,058
Oh, boy.

671
01:29:03,142 --> 01:29:05,477
This path has clearly
chosen me, Dad.

672
01:29:06,311 --> 01:29:07,563
Give me your hand, man.

673
01:29:12,901 --> 01:29:16,238
I want you
to listen to me, Barry.

674
01:29:16,405 --> 01:29:20,159
I want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.

675
01:29:25,914 --> 01:29:28,042
I want you to give all that up.

676
01:29:30,669 --> 01:29:34,047
And I want you to stop
coming to see me.

677
01:29:36,216 --> 01:29:39,386
I am a drag on your life.

678
01:29:44,767 --> 01:29:46,435
Okay. Um...

679
01:29:46,602 --> 01:29:50,064
Please don't ever
say that to me again.

680
01:29:50,189 --> 01:29:51,398
Please.

681
01:29:51,523 --> 01:29:53,066
Hey, you know what
criminal justice

682
01:29:53,150 --> 01:29:54,902
would be for me?

683
01:29:54,985 --> 01:29:59,782
My son not wasting his life.

684
01:30:01,116 --> 01:30:02,951
You can be
whatever you wanna be.

685
01:30:03,035 --> 01:30:04,453
You're brilliant, man.

686
01:30:06,955 --> 01:30:09,750
Absolute best of the best.

687
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:16,256
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City

688
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:18,175
for some old dude

689
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:21,470
who's not going anywhere.

690
01:30:21,553 --> 01:30:23,013
- Dad, that's not true.
- It's time.

691
01:30:23,138 --> 01:30:24,348
That's not true.

692
01:30:24,473 --> 01:30:25,933
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

693
01:30:26,016 --> 01:30:27,601
I want you
to make your own future.

694
01:30:27,643 --> 01:30:29,645
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

695
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:31,105
Open gate.

696
01:30:31,188 --> 01:30:32,689
Great.

697
01:30:36,193 --> 01:30:38,487
"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."

698
01:30:38,654 --> 01:30:40,197
Clear.
Close the gate.

699
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:36,336
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

700
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:37,921
You said that like it explains

701
01:31:38,046 --> 01:31:40,382
why there's a total stranger
in my place

702
01:31:40,549 --> 01:31:43,635
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

703
01:31:45,429 --> 01:31:47,431
Tell me about this.

704
01:31:51,393 --> 01:31:54,187
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,

705
01:31:54,271 --> 01:31:57,232
but who is definitely not me.

706
01:31:58,150 --> 01:32:00,027
Somebody... I don't know.

707
01:32:00,152 --> 01:32:02,029
Hippie, long hair.

708
01:32:02,154 --> 01:32:04,948
Very attractive Jewish boy.

709
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:09,119
Who drinks milk,
I don't drink milk.

710
01:32:09,244 --> 01:32:10,704
I know you have abilities.

711
01:32:10,746 --> 01:32:13,040
I just don't know what they are.

712
01:32:13,165 --> 01:32:14,208
My special skills

713
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:16,960
include viola, web design,

714
01:32:17,085 --> 01:32:19,922
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.

715
01:32:20,047 --> 01:32:23,759
Silica-based
sand quartz fabric.

716
01:32:23,842 --> 01:32:26,094
Abrasion resistant,
heat resistant.

717
01:32:26,261 --> 01:32:28,138
Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.

718
01:32:28,263 --> 01:32:29,890
It's what they use
on the space shuttle

719
01:32:30,015 --> 01:32:31,725
to prevent it from
burning up on re-entry.

720
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:34,603
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

721
01:32:35,812 --> 01:32:37,731
Look, man.
I don't know who you are,

722
01:32:37,814 --> 01:32:40,108
but whoever you're looking for,

723
01:32:40,192 --> 01:32:41,360
it's not me.

724
01:33:23,026 --> 01:33:24,945
You're the Batman?

725
01:33:25,028 --> 01:33:27,823
So, you're fast.

726
01:33:27,906 --> 01:33:29,574
That feels
like an oversimplification.

727
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,493
I'm putting together a team.

728
01:33:31,618 --> 01:33:33,662
People with special abilities.

729
01:33:33,829 --> 01:33:35,455
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

730
01:33:35,497 --> 01:33:37,749
Stop right there. I'm in.

731
01:33:38,834 --> 01:33:40,127
You are?

732
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:41,294
Just like that?

733
01:33:41,378 --> 01:33:42,671
Yeah.

734
01:33:44,464 --> 01:33:47,009
I need friends.

735
01:33:47,134 --> 01:33:50,387
Great. Great.

736
01:33:50,512 --> 01:33:52,723
Can I keep this?

737
01:33:52,848 --> 01:33:54,683
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

738
01:33:54,766 --> 01:33:56,476
and it seems
to manipulate space-time.

739
01:33:56,601 --> 01:33:58,020
I call it the Speed Force.

740
01:33:58,145 --> 01:33:59,855
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories

741
01:33:59,938 --> 01:34:02,816
so I am just a black hole
of snacks.

742
01:34:02,941 --> 01:34:05,402
I am a snack hole.

743
01:34:05,527 --> 01:34:08,405
How many people are
on this special fight team?

744
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:10,490
- Three, including you.
- Three?

745
01:34:10,574 --> 01:34:13,327
Against what?

746
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:14,953
I'll tell you on the plane.

747
01:34:15,495 --> 01:34:17,289
Plane?

748
01:34:17,414 --> 01:34:19,166
What are your superpowers again?

749
01:34:19,291 --> 01:34:21,043
I'm rich.

750
01:34:43,899 --> 01:34:45,859
Oh, Miss Prince, let me do that.

751
01:34:45,942 --> 01:34:48,904
No, that's okay.
I can do it myself.

752
01:34:49,071 --> 01:34:50,864
Would you like
to have some?

753
01:34:50,989 --> 01:34:52,407
Uh, no, thank you.

754
01:34:53,575 --> 01:34:56,036
If you put the water in first.

755
01:34:56,078 --> 01:34:59,498
- Of course.
- So we don't scald the tea.

756
01:35:02,292 --> 01:35:03,710
- Yes.
- Great.

757
01:35:03,794 --> 01:35:06,046
No, that's probably enough tea.

758
01:35:06,129 --> 01:35:08,423
All right.

759
01:35:08,548 --> 01:35:09,925
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?

760
01:35:10,092 --> 01:35:14,137
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

761
01:35:14,262 --> 01:35:17,265
I will.
I will, definitely will.

762
01:35:17,349 --> 01:35:19,559
Uh... What are you working on?

763
01:35:19,643 --> 01:35:21,478
It's a gauntlet

764
01:35:21,603 --> 01:35:25,399
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

765
01:35:25,482 --> 01:35:27,901
- Wow.
- Here, let me show you.

766
01:35:27,943 --> 01:35:31,154
We borrowed this from
the Kryptonian scout ship.

767
01:35:32,656 --> 01:35:34,074
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

768
01:35:34,157 --> 01:35:35,784
a fraction.
Thank you, thank you.

769
01:35:35,867 --> 01:35:36,910
Of course.

770
01:35:42,082 --> 01:35:43,667
Ah.

771
01:35:43,792 --> 01:35:46,795
Ah, now, let's see how that did.

772
01:35:46,878 --> 01:35:49,297
Ha! Yes.

773
01:35:49,422 --> 01:35:50,966
Not to be sneezed at.

774
01:35:51,049 --> 01:35:53,593
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

775
01:35:53,677 --> 01:35:55,470
It's Master Wayne's idea.

776
01:35:55,554 --> 01:35:57,806
Maybe you should work
on a lasso, too?

777
01:35:57,889 --> 01:36:00,767
- In black, of course.
- Oh.

778
01:36:07,524 --> 01:36:10,694
All right. Victor Stone.

779
01:36:26,751 --> 01:36:29,212
Something is not working.

780
01:36:29,337 --> 01:36:31,006
Mmm.

781
01:36:40,599 --> 01:36:43,059
Looks like you have a date,
Miss Prince.

782
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:43,286
Why are you looking
for me, Diana?

783
01:37:43,411 --> 01:37:44,704
You know who I am.

784
01:37:44,788 --> 01:37:47,040
I know more than you
can possibly imagine.

785
01:37:47,123 --> 01:37:50,377
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.

786
01:37:50,502 --> 01:37:51,711
The world does.

787
01:37:52,796 --> 01:37:54,756
Fuck the world.

788
01:37:56,132 --> 01:37:58,760
You've obviously
been through a great deal.

789
01:37:59,803 --> 01:38:02,889
I can't begin to imagine what.

790
01:38:02,931 --> 01:38:06,560
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

791
01:38:06,643 --> 01:38:08,478
Gifts?

792
01:38:08,603 --> 01:38:10,772
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?

793
01:38:10,855 --> 01:38:12,607
We need you, Victor.

794
01:38:12,732 --> 01:38:14,442
And maybe you need us.

795
01:38:14,526 --> 01:38:16,236
I don't need anyone.

796
01:38:18,446 --> 01:38:19,614
Not anymore.

797
01:38:19,698 --> 01:38:22,158
I told myself the same
for a long time.

798
01:38:28,832 --> 01:38:31,793
I lost someone I loved once.

799
01:38:34,546 --> 01:38:39,301
I shut myself off from everyone.

800
01:38:40,885 --> 01:38:43,805
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

801
01:38:46,224 --> 01:38:49,811
The truth is,
I'm still working on it.

802
01:38:49,894 --> 01:38:53,857
And if you asked to meet me...

803
01:38:53,982 --> 01:38:56,901
you're working on it, too.

804
01:40:08,306 --> 01:40:10,517
You were right
about the metal sample

805
01:40:10,558 --> 01:40:12,102
from the Superman ship.

806
01:40:12,227 --> 01:40:15,689
When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,

807
01:40:15,814 --> 01:40:17,399
look what happens.

808
01:40:26,449 --> 01:40:28,201
3.5 million kelvin.

809
01:40:28,243 --> 01:40:31,496
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.

810
01:40:31,621 --> 01:40:34,040
Hot, dense matter.

811
01:40:37,127 --> 01:40:39,963
You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.

812
01:40:40,088 --> 01:40:42,424
Exact words I said
to my prom date.

813
01:40:42,507 --> 01:40:44,134
She dumped me anyway.

814
01:40:44,259 --> 01:40:45,385
Yeah.

815
01:40:49,597 --> 01:40:50,723
Hey, Doc,

816
01:40:50,807 --> 01:40:52,392
do you think Batman is connected

817
01:40:52,434 --> 01:40:55,228
to the object
the CID is looking for?

818
01:40:56,146 --> 01:40:59,399
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

819
01:41:00,567 --> 01:41:01,776
No...

820
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:03,945
I don't.

821
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,899
Oh, Victor.

822
01:41:57,874 --> 01:41:59,959
All right! Let's go!

823
01:42:01,044 --> 01:42:02,378
Commissioner Gordon?

824
01:42:02,504 --> 01:42:03,546
Come on!

825
01:42:03,671 --> 01:42:04,839
Your messages.

826
01:42:04,964 --> 01:42:06,424
Hey, hey!

827
01:42:09,177 --> 01:42:11,679
Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.

828
01:42:11,805 --> 01:42:14,891
Half of Gotham's reality-challenged
community showed up.

829
01:42:15,016 --> 01:42:17,185
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.

830
01:42:17,268 --> 01:42:19,270
You were right, Ma.
Police Academy.

831
01:42:19,395 --> 01:42:21,231
What's wrong with dental school?

832
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:27,237
"Attacked by
a flying vampire."

833
01:42:27,362 --> 01:42:30,573
"Looked like a giant bat
with huge fangs."

834
01:42:30,698 --> 01:42:32,367
On a possibly related note,

835
01:42:32,450 --> 01:42:34,869
sketch of the suspect
in the abductions

836
01:42:34,994 --> 01:42:36,496
at the lab across the harbor.

837
01:42:36,579 --> 01:42:39,707
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like, Crispus.

838
01:42:39,874 --> 01:42:42,460
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here

839
01:42:42,585 --> 01:42:45,463
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

840
01:42:46,548 --> 01:42:47,632
I'll talk to him tonight.

841
01:42:47,757 --> 01:42:49,342
How, Jim?

842
01:42:49,467 --> 01:42:51,052
How do you think?

843
01:43:09,112 --> 01:43:10,530
Silas?

844
01:43:10,655 --> 01:43:11,864
Hey, hey.

845
01:43:11,948 --> 01:43:13,408
Hey, hey!

846
01:43:17,870 --> 01:43:20,415
- Oh, my goodness.
- Where's the cyborg?

847
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:21,583
His name is Victor.

848
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,253
We met, spoke.

849
01:43:26,087 --> 01:43:28,089
Give him time.

850
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:30,258
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

851
01:43:30,341 --> 01:43:34,137
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.

852
01:43:34,262 --> 01:43:36,598
- So, this is us.
- Yeah, this is us.

853
01:43:36,723 --> 01:43:38,057
Oh!

854
01:43:38,141 --> 01:43:40,935
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your...

855
01:43:41,019 --> 01:43:43,104
- Oh, sorry.
- That's your signal.

856
01:43:43,229 --> 01:43:44,689
That means we have to go now.

857
01:43:44,814 --> 01:43:48,526
- Yeah, that's what that means.
- It's so cool.

858
01:44:45,667 --> 01:44:47,418
Commander Mera, I told the king

859
01:44:47,543 --> 01:44:49,295
the perimeter guards were taken.

860
01:44:49,379 --> 01:44:50,922
He won't send reinforcements.

861
01:44:51,047 --> 01:44:53,633
He says all the reserves are
needed in the rebel regions.

862
01:44:53,758 --> 01:44:58,221
He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel.

863
01:44:58,346 --> 01:45:00,014
All right, take what men
we have left

864
01:45:00,139 --> 01:45:01,849
and form a phalanx
around the Mother Box.

865
01:46:41,783 --> 01:46:43,785
You can't escape.

866
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,621
I'm not trying to.

867
01:48:48,951 --> 01:48:51,287
Vulko told me
you would come.

868
01:48:51,412 --> 01:48:54,332
The firstborn
of beloved Queen Atlanna.

869
01:48:56,918 --> 01:48:58,252
Wait.

870
01:49:00,129 --> 01:49:01,339
Please.

871
01:49:04,884 --> 01:49:06,302
I knew her.

872
01:49:08,346 --> 01:49:10,640
Well, that makes one of us.

873
01:49:10,765 --> 01:49:12,600
My parents died in the wars.

874
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:15,895
She took me in.

875
01:49:15,978 --> 01:49:17,647
What a saint.

876
01:49:17,772 --> 01:49:19,899
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

877
01:49:19,982 --> 01:49:22,735
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep

878
01:49:22,818 --> 01:49:24,570
and never gave me
another thought.

879
01:49:24,612 --> 01:49:27,823
Your mother left you
to save your life.

880
01:49:27,949 --> 01:49:30,660
You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.

881
01:49:32,119 --> 01:49:34,330
What it cost her.

882
01:49:35,373 --> 01:49:37,708
But you're not
a defenseless child now.

883
01:49:39,877 --> 01:49:41,587
It would have been
her responsibility

884
01:49:41,629 --> 01:49:44,966
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.

885
01:49:45,633 --> 01:49:46,717
Now,

886
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,428
it's yours.

887
01:50:53,701 --> 01:50:55,036
Yes.

888
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:19,351
<i>Steppenwolf,</i>

889
01:51:19,477 --> 01:51:21,437
tell me what you've learned.

890
01:51:21,562 --> 01:51:24,065
Two boxes
found and awake.

891
01:51:24,231 --> 01:51:27,234
With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,

892
01:51:27,318 --> 01:51:30,571
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.

893
01:51:30,654 --> 01:51:33,199
Where is the third Mother Box?

894
01:51:33,282 --> 01:51:35,701
The parademons
sense its presence

895
01:51:35,743 --> 01:51:37,453
and search for the third.

896
01:51:37,578 --> 01:51:38,579
They have taken prisoners

897
01:51:38,704 --> 01:51:40,915
who carry its scent.

898
01:51:41,749 --> 01:51:43,376
Go.

899
01:51:43,459 --> 01:51:45,586
Interrogate the prisoners.

900
01:51:46,253 --> 01:51:48,089
Find the third.

901
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:51,884
They will tell me
what they know,

902
01:51:52,927 --> 01:51:55,679
or I will rip it from them.

903
01:52:38,806 --> 01:52:40,599
How many of you are there?

904
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:42,601
Not enough.

905
01:52:44,311 --> 01:52:46,730
Dozens of witnesses
all over Gotham.

906
01:52:46,856 --> 01:52:48,232
Description matches the suspect

907
01:52:48,357 --> 01:52:50,151
in the Metropolis abductions.

908
01:52:50,276 --> 01:52:51,444
Parademons.

909
01:52:51,986 --> 01:52:53,320
Okay.

910
01:52:53,487 --> 01:52:55,698
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

911
01:52:55,823 --> 01:52:57,199
At the lab.

912
01:52:57,324 --> 01:52:59,452
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

913
01:52:59,535 --> 01:53:00,619
So the eight may still be alive.

914
01:53:00,661 --> 01:53:01,662
Nine.

915
01:53:01,787 --> 01:53:03,664
Oh.

916
01:53:03,747 --> 01:53:06,500
The head of STARLABS
was taken tonight.

917
01:53:11,505 --> 01:53:14,175
Wow, okay.
So, another scientist.

918
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:15,551
So, how do we find him?

919
01:53:15,676 --> 01:53:17,219
There must be a nest nearby.

920
01:53:17,344 --> 01:53:21,640
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

921
01:53:21,724 --> 01:53:23,851
No discernable pattern
I can see.

922
01:53:23,976 --> 01:53:25,436
The lines on the map
don't converge.

923
01:53:25,561 --> 01:53:26,854
On land.

924
01:53:26,979 --> 01:53:28,397
These lead back
to Stryker's Island,

925
01:53:28,522 --> 01:53:29,648
between the two cities.

926
01:53:29,732 --> 01:53:30,816
These are air vents.

927
01:53:30,941 --> 01:53:32,401
They all lead down to the tunnel

928
01:53:32,526 --> 01:53:34,695
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.

929
01:53:34,862 --> 01:53:37,031
The nest could be there.

930
01:53:37,156 --> 01:53:39,116
Uh,
is he coming with us now,

931
01:53:39,241 --> 01:53:41,202
because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.

932
01:53:41,327 --> 01:53:42,786
I have something bigger.

933
01:53:43,913 --> 01:53:46,790
Do you really think that...

934
01:53:46,916 --> 01:53:50,503
Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?

935
01:53:50,544 --> 01:53:53,130
Oh. That's rude.

936
01:54:31,752 --> 01:54:33,796
We're close.

937
01:54:33,921 --> 01:54:36,090
The scent of the enemy.

938
01:54:36,715 --> 01:54:37,967
Of absence.

939
01:54:38,467 --> 01:54:40,094
Darkness.

940
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:42,096
Death.

941
01:54:42,263 --> 01:54:43,305
Where are we, Alfred?

942
01:54:43,430 --> 01:54:44,598
<i>Stryker's Island.</i>

943
01:54:44,682 --> 01:54:46,725
You should be directly under

944
01:54:46,809 --> 01:54:49,603
the venting tower
for the tunnel.

945
01:54:49,687 --> 01:54:51,063
<i>Now look to your left,</i>

946
01:54:51,146 --> 01:54:53,107
<i>you'll see a staircase
to the machine room.</i>

947
01:54:53,190 --> 01:54:55,776
<i>Thermal scan shows
a cluster of people there.</i>

948
01:54:55,901 --> 01:54:57,236
That's it.

949
01:54:57,361 --> 01:54:58,737
Let's go.

950
01:55:12,543 --> 01:55:15,296
Right.
Is there... Is there a plan?

951
01:55:16,797 --> 01:55:18,048
Either of you?

952
01:55:18,173 --> 01:55:20,217
Don't engage alone.

953
01:55:20,342 --> 01:55:21,635
We do this together.

954
01:55:30,519 --> 01:55:32,313
I heard about you.

955
01:55:34,023 --> 01:55:35,607
Didn't think you were real.

956
01:55:35,691 --> 01:55:37,276
I'm real when it's useful.

957
01:55:47,369 --> 01:55:49,121
I grow tired of your silence.

958
01:55:49,246 --> 01:55:51,623
Now tell me,
where is the Mother Box?

959
01:55:58,505 --> 01:56:00,674
Please. We have families.

960
01:56:00,799 --> 01:56:03,052
Then you have weakness.

961
01:56:03,177 --> 01:56:04,553
Steppenwolf.

962
01:56:04,678 --> 01:56:09,016
Okay, I'm guessing
that's the bad guy.

963
01:56:09,183 --> 01:56:10,351
Good guess.

964
01:56:10,476 --> 01:56:14,229
I'm really, really missing
Superman right now.

965
01:56:14,355 --> 01:56:16,315
Circle to the other side.

966
01:56:16,398 --> 01:56:18,776
We'll surround them
and surprise him.

967
01:56:23,072 --> 01:56:25,199
You have been near a Mother Box.

968
01:56:25,282 --> 01:56:26,867
The scent is on you.

969
01:56:26,992 --> 01:56:28,535
I don't know
what you're talking about.

970
01:56:28,702 --> 01:56:30,537
- Where is it?
- Leave him alone!

971
01:56:30,704 --> 01:56:33,040
He... He doesn't know.

972
01:56:36,585 --> 01:56:38,379
Wait, please, please!

973
01:56:43,801 --> 01:56:46,845
You carry
the scent, too. But stronger.

974
01:56:46,929 --> 01:56:49,223
I will die before I tell you.

975
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:51,433
You'll die if you don't.

976
01:56:51,558 --> 01:56:52,726
No!

977
01:57:01,819 --> 01:57:02,903
Victor.

978
01:57:03,028 --> 01:57:04,405
Kill them both.

979
01:57:07,908 --> 01:57:10,369
Ah, Amazon.

980
01:57:10,452 --> 01:57:13,122
But not like your sisters.

981
01:57:13,247 --> 01:57:14,373
Stronger.

982
01:57:45,404 --> 01:57:47,739
Amazon.

983
01:57:50,117 --> 01:57:51,618
Hold!

984
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:54,037
This one will be mine.

985
01:57:55,873 --> 01:57:58,375
I belong to no one.

986
01:58:12,181 --> 01:58:14,391
Guys, this is not together.

987
01:58:21,231 --> 01:58:22,649
Help get those people
out of here.

988
01:58:22,775 --> 01:58:24,943
I'll make sure these things
follow me.

989
01:58:34,828 --> 01:58:36,330
Everybody, move!

990
01:58:44,963 --> 01:58:46,507
A little quicker.

991
01:58:48,842 --> 01:58:50,135
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

992
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:53,013
I've got this. Keep moving.

993
01:58:54,848 --> 01:58:55,807
This way.

994
01:59:32,135 --> 01:59:33,720
The energy
is dissipating.

995
01:59:33,804 --> 01:59:36,306
<i>My gauntlet worked!</i>

996
01:59:36,431 --> 01:59:38,892
Celebrate later, Alfred.
I need the Nightcrawler.

997
01:59:38,976 --> 01:59:41,061
Thought you'd never ask.

998
01:59:41,144 --> 01:59:43,397
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

999
02:00:13,594 --> 02:00:14,553
Thank you, Alfred.

1000
02:00:14,678 --> 02:00:15,929
Don't mention it.

1001
02:00:38,785 --> 02:00:39,953
No!

1002
02:00:43,498 --> 02:00:44,499
Whew.

1003
02:00:47,628 --> 02:00:49,212
They're safe.
Get back to the tunnel.

1004
02:00:49,338 --> 02:00:52,674
Tunnel. Right.
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.

1005
02:01:04,436 --> 02:01:05,646
My turn.

1006
02:02:27,811 --> 02:02:29,479
Catastrophic failure
of all systems.

1007
02:02:29,604 --> 02:02:32,149
Are you all right, Master Wayne?

1008
02:02:32,274 --> 02:02:33,400
Are you all right?

1009
02:02:43,785 --> 02:02:47,581
You have the blood
of the old gods in you.

1010
02:03:01,845 --> 02:03:03,055
You okay?

1011
02:03:03,555 --> 02:03:04,765
Mm.

1012
02:03:04,890 --> 02:03:06,558
Wasn't sure you'd come.

1013
02:03:07,601 --> 02:03:08,810
You're my father.

1014
02:03:12,439 --> 02:03:13,440
Go.

1015
02:03:26,953 --> 02:03:28,121
No!

1016
02:04:13,375 --> 02:04:15,836
Relax, Alfred.
I'll take it from here.

1017
02:04:17,337 --> 02:04:19,339
Uh, do I know you?

1018
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:51,454
What are we under, right now?

1019
02:04:52,122 --> 02:04:53,498
Gotham Harbor.

1020
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:33,496
Who is that?

1021
02:05:58,772 --> 02:05:59,940
Come on.

1022
02:06:05,070 --> 02:06:06,363
Diana, get on!

1023
02:07:08,174 --> 02:07:09,718
What is it?

1024
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:18,893
Show me.

1025
02:07:58,099 --> 02:07:59,726
It is here.

1026
02:08:00,393 --> 02:08:03,521
On this world.

1027
02:08:37,263 --> 02:08:38,556
Sir, you're gonna
be in quarantine

1028
02:08:38,681 --> 02:08:40,058
for possible alien microbes.

1029
02:08:40,141 --> 02:08:41,935
U.S. government protocols
require that...

1030
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:45,063
I know the requirements.
I wrote them.

1031
02:08:49,526 --> 02:08:51,027
It called to him.

1032
02:08:51,152 --> 02:08:52,570
The Mother Box.

1033
02:08:52,654 --> 02:08:54,155
The one he already has.

1034
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:57,492
He has two. He took
the Mother Box from Atlantis.

1035
02:08:57,617 --> 02:09:00,120
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

1036
02:09:00,203 --> 02:09:01,496
If he doesn't already have it.

1037
02:09:05,041 --> 02:09:06,584
He doesn't have it.

1038
02:09:09,587 --> 02:09:10,880
I do.

1039
02:09:21,307 --> 02:09:23,435
Have you finished the conquest?

1040
02:09:23,518 --> 02:09:24,769
Not yet, DeSaad.

1041
02:09:24,853 --> 02:09:27,313
Then why do you summon me?

1042
02:09:27,439 --> 02:09:28,940
I bring news.

1043
02:09:29,065 --> 02:09:32,068
Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,

1044
02:09:32,193 --> 02:09:37,365
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

1045
02:09:37,490 --> 02:09:39,617
The Anti-Life Equation.

1046
02:09:39,701 --> 02:09:41,786
The key to controlling all life

1047
02:09:41,828 --> 02:09:44,330
and all will
throughout the multiverse.

1048
02:09:44,414 --> 02:09:47,667
He found it hidden on a
primitive planet, but before...

1049
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:50,628
The story of the defiance
is well-known.

1050
02:09:50,753 --> 02:09:53,423
I have found
the primitive planet.

1051
02:09:53,548 --> 02:09:55,550
The world that fought back.

1052
02:09:55,675 --> 02:09:57,635
It is Earth.

1053
02:09:57,677 --> 02:09:59,929
The Anti-Life Equation is carved

1054
02:10:00,054 --> 02:10:04,100
into the surface
of this very world.

1055
02:10:07,687 --> 02:10:09,230
Are you certain?

1056
02:10:09,355 --> 02:10:10,398
I have seen it.

1057
02:10:10,523 --> 02:10:13,735
I have looked with my own eyes.

1058
02:10:15,486 --> 02:10:16,488
Anti-Life.

1059
02:10:57,278 --> 02:10:58,947
My lord.

1060
02:11:00,406 --> 02:11:04,285
Oh, Steppenwolf.

1061
02:11:04,410 --> 02:11:08,581
My lord, I am
but your humble servant.

1062
02:11:08,665 --> 02:11:11,543
Can it be true
that you have found it?

1063
02:11:11,626 --> 02:11:14,462
I have, great one.

1064
02:11:14,587 --> 02:11:17,548
The lost world is Earth.

1065
02:11:17,674 --> 02:11:21,886
Anti-Life is here.

1066
02:11:21,928 --> 02:11:25,265
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,

1067
02:11:25,390 --> 02:11:28,560
synchronize The Unity, and
when this world is scorched,

1068
02:11:28,643 --> 02:11:32,021
I will come for my great prize.

1069
02:11:32,772 --> 02:11:35,942
You will come to Earth?

1070
02:11:36,025 --> 02:11:40,446
I have turned
100,000 worlds to dust

1071
02:11:40,571 --> 02:11:41,990
looking for Anti-Life.

1072
02:11:42,115 --> 02:11:45,493
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

1073
02:11:45,618 --> 02:11:48,788
I will stride across their bones

1074
02:11:48,871 --> 02:11:51,457
and bask in the glow
of Anti-Life.

1075
02:11:51,541 --> 02:11:54,335
And all of existence

1076
02:11:54,460 --> 02:11:57,755
shall be mine.

1077
02:12:01,301 --> 02:12:05,263
It shall be so, my master.

1078
02:12:09,475 --> 02:12:11,102
So cool.

1079
02:12:11,185 --> 02:12:14,147
From the outside, it looks like
this building was abandoned.

1080
02:12:17,567 --> 02:12:19,319
It wants to fly.

1081
02:12:20,528 --> 02:12:22,530
You talk to machines?

1082
02:12:22,655 --> 02:12:24,699
I speak
to intelligence.

1083
02:12:24,824 --> 02:12:25,992
This one's saying she can't fly

1084
02:12:26,075 --> 02:12:27,702
because of a software issue,

1085
02:12:27,827 --> 02:12:29,954
but I could fix it
with a little time.

1086
02:12:39,422 --> 02:12:41,966
There's a dark spot
in my data stream.

1087
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:44,510
I could feel
the other two boxes.

1088
02:12:44,594 --> 02:12:46,471
I know they're awake,

1089
02:12:46,554 --> 02:12:48,097
but I can't see where they are.

1090
02:12:48,222 --> 02:12:50,350
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.

1091
02:12:50,475 --> 02:12:52,518
Even if we knew,

1092
02:12:52,602 --> 02:12:55,855
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.

1093
02:12:57,857 --> 02:12:59,233
Maybe one.

1094
02:12:59,359 --> 02:13:01,778
Hmm, Superman.

1095
02:13:01,903 --> 02:13:03,571
As long as
the third box is asleep,

1096
02:13:03,696 --> 02:13:05,948
they can't see it,
only sense it.

1097
02:13:06,074 --> 02:13:08,326
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

1098
02:13:08,409 --> 02:13:09,827
No. That's just a strategy

1099
02:13:09,952 --> 02:13:11,913
to lose more slowly, not to win.

1100
02:13:12,038 --> 02:13:14,874
Remind me, are flamethrowers
not a thing?

1101
02:13:14,957 --> 02:13:16,042
Why don't we just destroy it?

1102
02:13:16,167 --> 02:13:18,252
Fire doesn't destroy the boxes.

1103
02:13:18,378 --> 02:13:20,296
They're an unknown form
of matter.

1104
02:13:20,421 --> 02:13:21,672
Oh, they love heat.

1105
02:13:21,714 --> 02:13:23,883
They absorb it,
hold it in their cores.

1106
02:13:24,008 --> 02:13:26,677
Well, you know
a lot about these boxes.

1107
02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:28,012
Makes you think.

1108
02:13:28,096 --> 02:13:30,723
Where'd you find the box,
Victor?

1109
02:13:30,848 --> 02:13:32,517
Are you trying to say something?

1110
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:34,352
Oh, I'm saying it.

1111
02:13:34,435 --> 02:13:36,729
How do we know you're not
working for them?

1112
02:13:38,439 --> 02:13:40,483
It's a long story.

1113
02:13:40,608 --> 02:13:42,443
You got somewhere else to be?

1114
02:13:49,826 --> 02:13:51,285
The Nazis found the box

1115
02:13:51,411 --> 02:13:53,746
at the end
of the Second World War,

1116
02:13:53,830 --> 02:13:56,916
buried under
an Italian monastery.

1117
02:13:56,999 --> 02:13:59,335
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

1118
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:02,380
They brought it back
to the States in '44.

1119
02:14:02,422 --> 02:14:06,717
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1120
02:14:06,759 --> 02:14:08,636
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives

1121
02:14:08,761 --> 02:14:10,513
for 70 years

1122
02:14:10,638 --> 02:14:14,142
till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.

1123
02:14:15,435 --> 02:14:17,937
A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection

1124
02:14:18,020 --> 02:14:19,188
between the ship...

1125
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:22,442
and 6-1-9-8-2.

1126
02:14:22,608 --> 02:14:26,279
He understood they were
both alien technologies.

1127
02:14:26,404 --> 02:14:28,448
Different civilizations,

1128
02:14:28,531 --> 02:14:31,576
similar properties.

1129
02:14:31,659 --> 02:14:35,079
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

1130
02:14:35,204 --> 02:14:38,666
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.

1131
02:14:38,791 --> 02:14:40,793
And so did.

1132
02:14:42,837 --> 02:14:44,005
Then...

1133
02:14:45,965 --> 02:14:49,010
I had an accident
that should've killed me.

1134
02:14:49,135 --> 02:14:52,346
But in an act of desperation
or madness,

1135
02:14:52,472 --> 02:14:55,057
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.

1136
02:15:11,032 --> 02:15:13,117
He unleashed an alien technology

1137
02:15:13,242 --> 02:15:16,037
he didn't fully understand.

1138
02:15:16,162 --> 02:15:18,831
He used that power
to keep me alive.

1139
02:15:22,335 --> 02:15:24,128
Alive...

1140
02:15:24,170 --> 02:15:26,339
but turned into this.

1141
02:15:29,008 --> 02:15:31,427
The box went back to sleep

1142
02:15:32,178 --> 02:15:34,096
and he never returned it.

1143
02:15:36,432 --> 02:15:38,851
That researcher was Silas Stone.

1144
02:15:40,436 --> 02:15:42,104
My father.

1145
02:15:45,358 --> 02:15:46,984
Wait,

1146
02:15:47,068 --> 02:15:50,363
your father saved your life
with one of these things?

1147
02:15:50,530 --> 02:15:52,865
Aren't they
psycho murder machines?

1148
02:15:53,032 --> 02:15:55,326
They're change machines.

1149
02:15:55,409 --> 02:15:58,579
The boxes don't think in terms
of healing or killing,

1150
02:15:58,704 --> 02:16:00,623
alive or dead.

1151
02:16:00,748 --> 02:16:03,167
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

1152
02:16:03,209 --> 02:16:04,961
regenerate, reinstate.

1153
02:16:05,086 --> 02:16:06,504
Reinstate?

1154
02:16:06,629 --> 02:16:08,047
A box has the power

1155
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:10,049
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

1156
02:16:10,216 --> 02:16:12,051
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter

1157
02:16:12,176 --> 02:16:13,302
can't be created or destroyed,

1158
02:16:13,427 --> 02:16:15,429
their relations just transform.

1159
02:16:15,555 --> 02:16:18,391
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

1160
02:16:18,474 --> 02:16:21,060
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

1161
02:16:21,185 --> 02:16:25,398
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

1162
02:16:27,275 --> 02:16:29,026
But a Mother Box...

1163
02:16:29,151 --> 02:16:31,529
...turns smoke
back into a house.

1164
02:16:37,368 --> 02:16:40,121
I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

1165
02:16:41,289 --> 02:16:44,083
Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.

1166
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:12,403
Who is it?

1167
02:17:12,987 --> 02:17:14,280
Martha.

1168
02:17:18,951 --> 02:17:20,286
Hi.

1169
02:17:22,038 --> 02:17:23,497
Hi.

1170
02:17:32,465 --> 02:17:34,050
I went to the <i>Daily Planet</i>

1171
02:17:34,175 --> 02:17:37,637
to finally pick up
Clark's things.

1172
02:17:39,055 --> 02:17:42,475
I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.

1173
02:17:45,144 --> 02:17:46,979
I lost the farm.

1174
02:17:48,314 --> 02:17:50,566
I'd been behind on
the payments for a while.

1175
02:17:51,901 --> 02:17:53,277
Truth is, the house is too big

1176
02:17:53,402 --> 02:17:56,113
for me to live in
by myself anyway.

1177
02:17:56,238 --> 02:17:59,158
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

1178
02:17:59,241 --> 02:18:01,369
for as long as you need.

1179
02:18:02,328 --> 02:18:05,247
Thank you, Lois.
That's very kind.

1180
02:18:06,624 --> 02:18:08,918
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

1181
02:18:09,043 --> 02:18:11,003
right by the diner.

1182
02:18:11,087 --> 02:18:12,505
I'm not here for help.

1183
02:18:13,673 --> 02:18:16,175
I'm here because

1184
02:18:16,300 --> 02:18:19,011
when I saw Mr. Perry,
he told me that

1185
02:18:20,221 --> 02:18:23,307
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.

1186
02:18:27,979 --> 02:18:29,647
I can't.

1187
02:18:36,404 --> 02:18:39,073
The whole world is mourning.

1188
02:18:40,366 --> 02:18:42,660
Grieving over a symbol.

1189
02:18:42,785 --> 02:18:47,039
Everywhere I go, everywhere
I look, I see that "S."

1190
02:18:47,957 --> 02:18:50,000
I hear what people say.

1191
02:18:50,084 --> 02:18:52,086
They talk like they knew him.

1192
02:18:53,087 --> 02:18:55,506
But they didn't know Clark.

1193
02:18:56,966 --> 02:18:59,260
And I can't stop them

1194
02:18:59,385 --> 02:19:03,764
and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.

1195
02:19:05,808 --> 02:19:08,227
You're the only one who knows.

1196
02:19:08,352 --> 02:19:11,063
Who feels what I do.

1197
02:19:12,106 --> 02:19:15,276
Burdened by a secret
on top of grief.

1198
02:19:18,237 --> 02:19:21,741
I came all this way
because I wanted...

1199
02:19:21,824 --> 02:19:23,784
because I wanted to see you.

1200
02:19:25,036 --> 02:19:27,037
Tell you...

1201
02:19:27,079 --> 02:19:29,165
I understand.

1202
02:19:30,916 --> 02:19:32,877
I...

1203
02:19:33,002 --> 02:19:37,047
will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

1204
02:19:40,676 --> 02:19:42,636
And I just miss him.

1205
02:19:43,804 --> 02:19:46,223
I miss him so much.

1206
02:19:52,772 --> 02:19:54,440
So do I, sweetheart.

1207
02:19:58,903 --> 02:20:03,783
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

1208
02:20:07,286 --> 02:20:10,164
There is something
you can do for me, honey.

1209
02:20:12,333 --> 02:20:14,710
Come back to the living.

1210
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:57,586
The world needs you, too, Lois.

1211
02:21:01,215 --> 02:21:02,550
<i>The dead are dead.</i>

1212
02:21:02,675 --> 02:21:04,677
The box brought Victor back.

1213
02:21:04,802 --> 02:21:06,262
Victor wasn't dead.

1214
02:21:06,387 --> 02:21:08,180
Life is either one or zero.

1215
02:21:08,305 --> 02:21:11,267
It's to be or not to be.
Not both.

1216
02:21:11,392 --> 02:21:13,018
Can you operate this box,
Victor?

1217
02:21:13,143 --> 02:21:14,436
Of course.

1218
02:21:14,562 --> 02:21:16,856
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

1219
02:21:16,939 --> 02:21:19,191
There's no telling
what's gonna happen.

1220
02:21:20,776 --> 02:21:22,361
Okay, but...

1221
02:21:22,528 --> 02:21:26,824
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

1222
02:21:26,866 --> 02:21:28,159
What do we have to lose?

1223
02:21:28,284 --> 02:21:30,744
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.

1224
02:21:30,870 --> 02:21:32,288
As soon as it wakes up...

1225
02:21:32,413 --> 02:21:34,874
...the enemy sees it, comes,

1226
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:37,501
activates The Unity.
The end.

1227
02:21:37,585 --> 02:21:39,920
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

1228
02:21:40,045 --> 02:21:42,214
to a bunch of genocidal
aliens. That's good to know.

1229
02:21:42,339 --> 02:21:44,717
Even if Superman could return,

1230
02:21:44,884 --> 02:21:47,011
who's to say
that he could defeat them?

1231
02:21:47,094 --> 02:21:49,096
The Mother Box did.

1232
02:21:49,221 --> 02:21:51,390
Victor's father
activated a Mother Box

1233
02:21:51,515 --> 02:21:54,351
more than a year ago
when Superman was still alive.

1234
02:21:54,476 --> 02:21:56,395
Didn't call out to Steppenwolf.

1235
02:21:56,478 --> 02:21:58,063
None of the boxes did.
Not until...

1236
02:21:58,188 --> 02:22:00,232
Not until Superman died.

1237
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:02,693
Not until Superman died.

1238
02:22:02,818 --> 02:22:04,778
It's like they were
afraid of him?

1239
02:22:04,904 --> 02:22:07,907
Yes,
they were afraid of him.

1240
02:22:10,951 --> 02:22:12,745
This is the only way.

1241
02:22:14,079 --> 02:22:18,250
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

1242
02:22:34,433 --> 02:22:36,435
Cross this one off
the bucket list.

1243
02:22:36,518 --> 02:22:40,522
Exhume Superman
from the grave. Check.

1244
02:22:42,191 --> 02:22:44,902
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?

1245
02:22:45,653 --> 02:22:46,946
We could.

1246
02:22:54,453 --> 02:22:56,288
He was my hero.

1247
02:22:58,832 --> 02:22:59,959
All right.

1248
02:23:03,504 --> 02:23:06,757
An Amazon
working with an Atlantean.

1249
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:08,008
Half-Atlantean.

1250
02:23:09,802 --> 02:23:13,013
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

1251
02:23:13,138 --> 02:23:17,268
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

1252
02:23:17,351 --> 02:23:20,187
I hate Atlanteans as much
as you Amazons do.

1253
02:23:20,312 --> 02:23:22,481
Hate is useless.

1254
02:23:25,651 --> 02:23:26,819
Yep.

1255
02:23:28,153 --> 02:23:29,780
No, thank you.

1256
02:23:34,201 --> 02:23:35,327
You know, my father told me

1257
02:23:35,452 --> 02:23:37,371
there's a saying in Atlantis...

1258
02:23:38,831 --> 02:23:41,125
"None are taken back
from the darkness.

1259
02:23:41,208 --> 02:23:42,418
"Not without..."

1260
02:23:42,543 --> 02:23:44,044
"Not without
giving one up in return."

1261
02:23:46,296 --> 02:23:47,881
We say the same thing.

1262
02:23:50,467 --> 02:23:52,219
How about that?

1263
02:23:52,344 --> 02:23:54,388
Wonder Woman.

1264
02:23:55,514 --> 02:23:56,807
What do you think, man?

1265
02:23:56,890 --> 02:23:59,685
You think she'd ever
go for a younger guy?

1266
02:23:59,810 --> 02:24:02,646
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1267
02:24:04,356 --> 02:24:06,400
Every guy's a younger guy.

1268
02:24:08,193 --> 02:24:09,278
Jesus.

1269
02:24:10,863 --> 02:24:12,656
Oh, Christ.

1270
02:24:14,908 --> 02:24:17,619
Oh, bloody...

1271
02:24:18,912 --> 02:24:19,997
Any luck?

1272
02:24:20,039 --> 02:24:21,415
If by "luck" you mean

1273
02:24:21,540 --> 02:24:24,334
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

1274
02:24:24,460 --> 02:24:26,670
then, no. No luck.

1275
02:24:27,421 --> 02:24:28,881
It's okay.

1276
02:24:28,964 --> 02:24:30,924
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

1277
02:24:31,050 --> 02:24:32,176
to the Kryptonian ship.

1278
02:24:32,301 --> 02:24:33,552
It's basically
an organic computer.

1279
02:24:33,677 --> 02:24:35,387
It can talk directly
to the Mother Box.

1280
02:24:35,554 --> 02:24:38,140
What? The way it talked
to Lex Luthor?

1281
02:24:38,265 --> 02:24:39,516
Something like that.

1282
02:24:39,641 --> 02:24:43,437
Huh.
What could possibly go wrong?

1283
02:24:49,943 --> 02:24:51,570
Master Wayne...

1284
02:24:53,447 --> 02:24:54,823
you did it!

1285
02:24:54,948 --> 02:24:58,494
You put the team together
to fight this war.

1286
02:24:58,619 --> 02:25:01,705
You've fulfilled your promise.

1287
02:25:01,789 --> 02:25:05,709
But to try to do that...
I mean...

1288
02:25:05,834 --> 02:25:08,754
your guilt's
overcome your reason.

1289
02:25:08,921 --> 02:25:11,048
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...

1290
02:25:11,090 --> 02:25:14,426
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly on faith,

1291
02:25:14,551 --> 02:25:16,929
not on reason.

1292
02:25:17,054 --> 02:25:21,392
But if you start playing with
this little box of tricks,

1293
02:25:21,517 --> 02:25:23,644
I mean, it could be
the end of everything.

1294
02:25:23,769 --> 02:25:26,730
How do you know
your team's strong enough?

1295
02:25:26,814 --> 02:25:29,358
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

1296
02:25:29,483 --> 02:25:31,276
then don't wave
the red cape at it.

1297
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:33,070
You do when it's this red cape.

1298
02:25:33,153 --> 02:25:35,447
This red cape charges back.

1299
02:25:50,087 --> 02:25:51,171
Okay.

1300
02:25:58,011 --> 02:26:00,514
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.

1301
02:26:00,639 --> 02:26:02,141
Everyone's clear, including you.

1302
02:26:02,307 --> 02:26:04,977
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

1303
02:26:05,060 --> 02:26:06,979
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

1304
02:26:07,062 --> 02:26:08,021
Absolutely.

1305
02:26:11,859 --> 02:26:13,110
- Thanks.
- Listen up, everyone.

1306
02:26:13,193 --> 02:26:15,821
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.

1307
02:26:15,946 --> 02:26:17,489
If you need
more medical attention...

1308
02:26:17,573 --> 02:26:21,493
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?

1309
02:26:21,577 --> 02:26:22,995
- Definitely not "A."
- Okay.

1310
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:26,165
Or... "B"?

1311
02:26:27,708 --> 02:26:29,084
Let me see "A" again?

1312
02:26:34,590 --> 02:26:37,885
Right. We should get dressed.

1313
02:26:39,845 --> 02:26:41,972
I'm always dressed.

1314
02:27:09,124 --> 02:27:10,209
ID?

1315
02:27:10,334 --> 02:27:11,627
ID.

1316
02:27:14,588 --> 02:27:15,881
Aye, aye.

1317
02:27:18,133 --> 02:27:19,509
"Aye, aye"?

1318
02:27:42,533 --> 02:27:43,784
Okay.

1319
02:27:43,909 --> 02:27:46,119
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

1320
02:27:53,168 --> 02:27:54,086
Doc!

1321
02:27:54,169 --> 02:27:55,629
They let you out of quarantine.

1322
02:27:55,754 --> 02:27:57,172
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

1323
02:27:57,297 --> 02:27:59,424
Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made

1324
02:27:59,550 --> 02:28:00,842
with the electron-laser.

1325
02:28:00,968 --> 02:28:03,095
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.

1326
02:28:18,068 --> 02:28:21,029
Victor, clear this place out.

1327
02:28:21,154 --> 02:28:22,489
Done.

1328
02:28:26,285 --> 02:28:28,996
<i>Code Red.
Contamination breach.</i>

1329
02:28:29,121 --> 02:28:32,332
<i>All personnel
evacuate immediately.</i>

1330
02:28:32,457 --> 02:28:34,751
Bio red five.

1331
02:28:34,835 --> 02:28:37,212
The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.

1332
02:28:37,337 --> 02:28:40,257
A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.

1333
02:28:40,340 --> 02:28:41,591
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1334
02:28:41,717 --> 02:28:43,760
All right, people,
shut it down. Let's go.

1335
02:28:43,802 --> 02:28:45,178
- Ryan, we just had it swept.
- We have to go, Doc.

1336
02:28:45,304 --> 02:28:46,638
Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1337
02:28:46,763 --> 02:28:48,098
- Let's go, Doc.
- Think about it.

1338
02:28:48,181 --> 02:28:49,266
Full base evacuation!
Everyone out!

1339
02:28:49,308 --> 02:28:51,393
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

1340
02:28:51,518 --> 02:28:54,479
<i>Remain calm and
proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

1341
02:29:00,861 --> 02:29:02,654
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

1342
02:29:02,779 --> 02:29:05,657
Go! Go! Everybody out!
Come on! Move!

1343
02:29:05,741 --> 02:29:07,492
Move! Come on! Go, go!

1344
02:29:07,576 --> 02:29:09,161
Everybody out! Go!

1345
02:29:29,348 --> 02:29:32,142
Yes! Gotcha!

1346
02:29:32,267 --> 02:29:35,062
Post Commander, this is
Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?

1347
02:29:35,187 --> 02:29:37,564
- <i>Go ahead, Dr. Stone.</i>
- This is a false alarm.

1348
02:29:37,689 --> 02:29:40,484
Someone has hacked into
the system. We must alert...

1349
02:29:50,452 --> 02:29:51,953
Victor.

1350
02:29:53,413 --> 02:29:55,916
<i>Dr. Stone, you there?
I don't copy.</i>

1351
02:29:56,750 --> 02:29:57,834
I was mistaken.

1352
02:29:57,918 --> 02:29:59,127
The alarm's legit.

1353
02:29:59,252 --> 02:30:00,921
Everybody out.
And nobody, I repeat,

1354
02:30:01,046 --> 02:30:03,840
nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.

1355
02:30:03,924 --> 02:30:05,300
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

1356
02:30:15,394 --> 02:30:17,062
Get the civilians out!

1357
02:30:17,187 --> 02:30:18,355
Let's go! Let's go!

1358
02:30:22,734 --> 02:30:23,902
- Everybody got out okay?
- I think so.

1359
02:30:24,027 --> 02:30:25,195
- Everybody?
- Yes.

1360
02:30:58,478 --> 02:30:59,855
This way.

1361
02:31:10,365 --> 02:31:13,118
It knows he's here.

1362
02:31:13,285 --> 02:31:15,412
Ooh, that's intense.

1363
02:31:19,791 --> 02:31:21,918
This is amazing.

1364
02:31:22,627 --> 02:31:23,795
This is crazy.

1365
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:25,839
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1366
02:31:25,964 --> 02:31:28,425
You two lunatics
better know what you're doing.

1367
02:33:54,279 --> 02:33:56,281
<i>Systems coming online.</i>

1368
02:33:59,034 --> 02:34:01,328
<i>Welcome, Victor.</i>

1369
02:34:01,453 --> 02:34:03,371
<i>Would you like
to assume command?</i>

1370
02:34:03,496 --> 02:34:04,456
I'm in.

1371
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:15,967
The ship says
the Mother Box is hostile.

1372
02:34:16,134 --> 02:34:17,677
I can override
the security protocols,

1373
02:34:17,802 --> 02:34:19,512
but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage

1374
02:34:19,638 --> 02:34:21,014
that Luthor's
power surges caused

1375
02:34:21,139 --> 02:34:22,265
to the primary capacitors.

1376
02:34:22,349 --> 02:34:23,308
English.

1377
02:34:23,475 --> 02:34:25,977
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

1378
02:34:26,102 --> 02:34:28,146
I might be able to do it.

1379
02:34:30,273 --> 02:34:32,233
I mean, I might be able
to jump-start it.

1380
02:34:32,359 --> 02:34:33,610
I don't like to break this rule,

1381
02:34:33,693 --> 02:34:35,487
but when I approach
the speed of light, I...

1382
02:34:35,570 --> 02:34:37,155
Look, crazy things
happen to time,

1383
02:34:37,322 --> 02:34:39,824
but if I do it, I create
massive electrical power.

1384
02:34:39,908 --> 02:34:41,701
I could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,

1385
02:34:41,826 --> 02:34:44,162
I can conduct a significant
electrical current.

1386
02:34:44,329 --> 02:34:46,998
I might be able to wake
the box, if that's...

1387
02:34:47,123 --> 02:34:48,792
still what we want?

1388
02:34:48,875 --> 02:34:50,377
It is. Do it.

1389
02:34:55,131 --> 02:34:56,466
Hey, Miss Lane.

1390
02:34:56,549 --> 02:34:57,342
Morning.

1391
02:34:57,509 --> 02:34:59,010
I didn't think you were coming.

1392
02:34:59,928 --> 02:35:01,513
One last time.

1393
02:35:18,446 --> 02:35:22,200
I see engines, so this must be
the end of the line. So I'm...

1394
02:35:22,367 --> 02:35:23,535
<i>I'm in position.</i>

1395
02:35:26,287 --> 02:35:28,873
<i>Ready to initiate
drop sequence.</i>

1396
02:35:28,957 --> 02:35:30,583
The Mother Box is ready.

1397
02:35:49,769 --> 02:35:51,688
The ship's begging me
not to wake the box.

1398
02:35:51,771 --> 02:35:53,690
<i>This action
is irreversible.</i>

1399
02:35:53,773 --> 02:35:55,108
It's afraid. It knows
Steppenwolf will come for it.

1400
02:35:55,233 --> 02:35:57,027
We know that already.
Continue.

1401
02:35:57,110 --> 02:35:59,738
<i>I strongly advise
against activation.</i>

1402
02:35:59,821 --> 02:36:01,489
Barry, I'm initiating
the countdown.

1403
02:36:01,614 --> 02:36:03,241
<i>This action
is irreversible.</i>

1404
02:36:03,408 --> 02:36:04,534
- Five...
- <i>Five...</i>

1405
02:36:04,617 --> 02:36:06,036
- Five...
- <i>Apokoliptian technology</i>

1406
02:36:06,119 --> 02:36:07,162
- <i>is hostile.</i>
- This is a bad idea.

1407
02:36:07,287 --> 02:36:07,996
No, it isn't.
Keep going.

1408
02:36:08,121 --> 02:36:09,080
Four...

1409
02:36:09,247 --> 02:36:10,707
- <i>Four...</i>
- Four...

1410
02:36:10,832 --> 02:36:12,250
<i>I strongly advise
against activation.</i>

1411
02:36:12,375 --> 02:36:13,585
- We need to abort, now.
- Just do it.

1412
02:36:13,752 --> 02:36:14,878
- Three...
- <i>Three...</i>

1413
02:36:14,961 --> 02:36:15,962
Three...

1414
02:36:16,087 --> 02:36:17,797
- Two...
- <i>Two...</i>

1415
02:36:17,922 --> 02:36:19,841
- Two...
- <i>This course is irreversible.</i>

1416
02:36:19,966 --> 02:36:21,259
- One.
- <i>One.</i>

1417
02:36:22,093 --> 02:36:23,511
One.

1418
02:36:23,636 --> 02:36:24,929
<i>This action
is irreversible.</i>

1419
02:37:53,935 --> 02:37:55,520
- <i>Victor?</i>
- No.

1420
02:37:56,521 --> 02:37:57,480
Go?

1421
02:39:27,987 --> 02:39:30,740
<i>The future
has taken root in the present.</i>

1422
02:39:30,865 --> 02:39:32,742
Get down!

1423
02:41:16,929 --> 02:41:18,514
He's back.

1424
02:41:45,166 --> 02:41:48,086
Something's wrong.
He's scanning us.

1425
02:41:50,254 --> 02:41:51,714
What?

1426
02:42:06,604 --> 02:42:07,772
Victor?

1427
02:42:08,981 --> 02:42:09,982
Victor?

1428
02:42:12,276 --> 02:42:14,153
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

1429
02:42:14,278 --> 02:42:15,905
It's my auto-defense system.

1430
02:42:15,988 --> 02:42:17,115
It senses danger.

1431
02:42:17,198 --> 02:42:18,449
Victor, no! Victor!

1432
02:42:18,574 --> 02:42:20,493
- I can't control it.
- Don't!

1433
02:42:32,672 --> 02:42:33,965
Kal-El, no!

1434
02:42:42,140 --> 02:42:44,434
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

1435
02:42:51,440 --> 02:42:54,110
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

1436
02:43:24,557 --> 02:43:28,477
Kal-El,
the last Son of Krypton...

1437
02:43:29,395 --> 02:43:31,689
remember who you are.

1438
02:43:33,232 --> 02:43:34,483
Tell me who you...

1439
02:45:09,453 --> 02:45:12,623
Let's go!

1440
02:45:19,630 --> 02:45:21,090
You should probably move.

1441
02:45:24,593 --> 02:45:25,761
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1442
02:45:25,845 --> 02:45:28,639
Get up.
Take cover back there. Go.

1443
02:46:20,608 --> 02:46:22,818
Please don't make me do this.

1444
02:46:55,393 --> 02:46:56,727
Clark.

1445
02:46:57,603 --> 02:46:58,896
Clark, no.

1446
02:47:10,408 --> 02:47:11,617
Clark.

1447
02:47:11,742 --> 02:47:13,577
No.

1448
02:47:13,744 --> 02:47:15,454
This world needs you.

1449
02:47:20,709 --> 02:47:22,044
Clark.

1450
02:47:22,169 --> 02:47:23,254
Clark.

1451
02:47:23,337 --> 02:47:25,423
Whoa! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

1452
02:47:26,924 --> 02:47:28,217
Clark.

1453
02:47:31,595 --> 02:47:33,055
Please.

1454
02:48:07,298 --> 02:48:08,340
Please.

1455
02:48:19,518 --> 02:48:20,811
Please.

1456
02:48:21,479 --> 02:48:23,606
Just go.

1457
02:48:23,689 --> 02:48:24,857
Yeah.

1458
02:48:25,566 --> 02:48:26,984
Let's go.

1459
02:48:59,517 --> 02:49:01,685
I'm so sorry.

1460
02:49:10,903 --> 02:49:11,987
Take cover!

1461
02:49:12,029 --> 02:49:14,657
- He's coming.
- The Mother Box.

1462
02:49:14,698 --> 02:49:15,950
Where is it?

1463
02:49:26,502 --> 02:49:27,837
Come on.

1464
02:49:28,587 --> 02:49:30,422
Come on.

1465
02:49:55,114 --> 02:49:58,867
<i>Attention,

02:49:58,993 --> 02:50:01,203
<i>Sector Four, Level Three.</i>

1467
02:50:01,287 --> 02:50:04,290
<i>Implement lockdown
procedures immediately.</i>

1468
02:50:32,776 --> 02:50:34,403
Give me the Mother Box.

1469
02:50:47,625 --> 02:50:49,126
No, no, no.

1470
02:50:51,587 --> 02:50:53,297
Dad, wait! Don't!

1471
02:51:33,587 --> 02:51:36,507
So begins the end.

1472
02:51:42,096 --> 02:51:43,514
Victor?

1473
02:51:45,808 --> 02:51:49,269
Vic... Whoa, Victor.
Are you okay, man? Come on.

1474
02:51:55,067 --> 02:51:56,402
Victor?

1475
02:51:57,569 --> 02:51:58,946
He's dead.

1476
02:51:59,071 --> 02:52:00,197
What?

1477
02:52:01,115 --> 02:52:02,449
My father.

1478
02:52:03,867 --> 02:52:07,329
I didn't save him. I couldn't.

1479
02:52:07,413 --> 02:52:09,039
Oh, my God.

1480
02:52:15,629 --> 02:52:17,673
His father's dead 'cause of us.

1481
02:52:17,798 --> 02:52:19,591
I told you waking that box
was a bad idea.

1482
02:52:19,717 --> 02:52:21,176
It wasn't a bad idea.

1483
02:52:21,301 --> 02:52:23,637
We needed Superman.
We still do.

1484
02:52:23,762 --> 02:52:26,223
Well, whatever
returned, it isn't Superman.

1485
02:52:26,306 --> 02:52:29,560
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.

1486
02:52:29,643 --> 02:52:31,186
It is him.

1487
02:52:31,228 --> 02:52:33,731
He recognized Lois Lane.

1488
02:52:33,897 --> 02:52:36,025
- Who?
- The woman he loves.

1489
02:52:36,108 --> 02:52:38,402
- He remembers her.
- Nah.

1490
02:52:38,569 --> 02:52:40,404
He went to her 'cause
she wasn't afraid of him.

1491
02:52:40,487 --> 02:52:42,197
It's called instinct, Diana.

1492
02:52:49,371 --> 02:52:51,248
Wait,
where did Steppenwolf go?

1493
02:52:51,373 --> 02:52:53,000
He's gone back to his base

1494
02:52:53,125 --> 02:52:54,668
to assemble the three boxes.

1495
02:52:54,793 --> 02:52:56,253
And we don't know
where his base is.

1496
02:52:56,420 --> 02:52:58,088
- Or how long until...
- Hours.

1497
02:52:58,172 --> 02:52:59,757
The boxes synchronize,
Unity forms,

1498
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:03,093
we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.

1499
02:53:03,177 --> 02:53:05,387
This is not your...

1500
02:53:07,556 --> 02:53:09,057
He knew.

1501
02:53:09,141 --> 02:53:10,684
He knew, he knew, he knew.

1502
02:53:10,809 --> 02:53:12,770
He wasn't trying
to destroy the box...

1503
02:53:12,853 --> 02:53:14,813
he was trying to superheat it.

1504
02:53:14,938 --> 02:53:16,190
He made the core
the hottest thing

1505
02:53:16,315 --> 02:53:17,441
on Earth outside
of a nuclear reactor.

1506
02:53:17,566 --> 02:53:18,567
Now, anything that hot
would have to...

1507
02:53:18,650 --> 02:53:19,860
Blink off the charts

1508
02:53:19,985 --> 02:53:22,112
on a thermal imaging system.

1509
02:53:22,279 --> 02:53:25,574
Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.

1510
02:53:25,657 --> 02:53:27,618
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite

1511
02:53:27,743 --> 02:53:29,912
to scan the Earth
for thermal anomalies.

1512
02:53:30,037 --> 02:53:31,413
I'm already on it.

1513
02:53:31,497 --> 02:53:33,499
I'm sorry.
You have a satellite?

1514
02:53:33,624 --> 02:53:34,917
I have six.

1515
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:36,251
Right.

1516
02:53:37,669 --> 02:53:40,089
Let's go find
the son of a bitch.

1517
02:54:04,363 --> 02:54:06,615
You brought us here.

1518
02:54:06,740 --> 02:54:07,866
You remembered.

1519
02:54:08,826 --> 02:54:10,494
This is home.

1520
02:54:12,246 --> 02:54:13,622
You spoke.

1521
02:54:17,668 --> 02:54:19,545
Did I not before?

1522
02:54:53,412 --> 02:54:56,206
Your mother got behind
on the payments.

1523
02:54:57,416 --> 02:54:59,585
She never told anyone.

1524
02:55:01,128 --> 02:55:02,921
I don't understand.

1525
02:55:06,049 --> 02:55:08,552
She's a proud woman, Clark.

1526
02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:12,931
Here.

1527
02:55:27,946 --> 02:55:29,615
She loved it here.

1528
02:55:40,292 --> 02:55:41,960
So did I.

1529
02:55:43,962 --> 02:55:45,505
So did I.

1530
02:56:11,073 --> 02:56:12,324
Wow!

1531
02:56:12,449 --> 02:56:14,117
This is awesome.

1532
02:56:14,284 --> 02:56:15,827
Brought some friends.

1533
02:56:22,334 --> 02:56:24,795
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

1534
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:27,547
Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.

1535
02:56:27,673 --> 02:56:29,967
- Alfred.
- Good day, ma'am.

1536
02:56:31,259 --> 02:56:33,428
Oh...

1537
02:56:36,390 --> 02:56:38,475
It's badass, Alfred.

1538
02:56:41,144 --> 02:56:43,689
Well, I'll put on the tea.

1539
02:56:43,814 --> 02:56:44,940
Great.

1540
02:56:45,065 --> 02:56:46,775
I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.

1541
02:56:49,486 --> 02:56:52,447
There's the
Mother Box, right there.

1542
02:56:52,489 --> 02:56:54,533
Go to visible spectrum.

1543
02:56:56,368 --> 02:56:58,495
Pozharnov.

1544
02:56:58,620 --> 02:57:01,498
Ghost city not far from Moscow.

1545
02:57:01,623 --> 02:57:02,874
It's been abandoned since

1546
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:04,376
the nuclear accident there
30 years ago.

1547
02:57:04,501 --> 02:57:05,794
Not even the army goes in.

1548
02:57:05,877 --> 02:57:07,295
Right, it's probably
so radioactive

1549
02:57:07,421 --> 02:57:09,464
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.

1550
02:57:09,506 --> 02:57:10,924
Not anymore.

1551
02:57:11,049 --> 02:57:12,801
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.

1552
02:57:12,884 --> 02:57:13,927
Zoom.

1553
02:57:17,764 --> 02:57:19,307
What the hell is he building?

1554
02:57:19,391 --> 02:57:20,851
The Unity's in there.

1555
02:57:20,934 --> 02:57:22,311
We'll attack from above.

1556
02:57:22,394 --> 02:57:25,105
Explosives won't
separate the boxes,

1557
02:57:25,230 --> 02:57:26,857
only strengthen their bond.

1558
02:57:27,024 --> 02:57:28,358
What?
So we can't blow it up?

1559
02:57:28,442 --> 02:57:29,985
Not from the outside.

1560
02:57:31,486 --> 02:57:34,406
I want to plug into
The Unity, one-on-one.

1561
02:57:34,531 --> 02:57:35,907
Fuse with it.

1562
02:57:36,033 --> 02:57:37,367
Weaken its bond from the inside

1563
02:57:37,534 --> 02:57:38,785
so we can break it back
into three.

1564
02:57:38,910 --> 02:57:40,996
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

1565
02:57:41,038 --> 02:57:44,750
You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.

1566
02:57:44,875 --> 02:57:47,377
These boxes together
are world destroyers.

1567
02:57:47,461 --> 02:57:48,837
A billion years old.

1568
02:57:48,920 --> 02:57:51,006
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses

1569
02:57:51,131 --> 02:57:53,550
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.

1570
02:57:53,633 --> 02:57:55,886
Just get me in and get me time.

1571
02:57:56,053 --> 02:57:57,179
You could die, Victor.

1572
02:57:57,262 --> 02:57:59,723
If I don't, we all die.
Period.

1573
02:58:04,311 --> 02:58:06,104
I got nothing left.

1574
02:58:11,401 --> 02:58:13,570
You wanted me
to use these gifts, right?

1575
02:58:16,490 --> 02:58:18,075
That's what I'm gonna do.

1576
02:58:18,241 --> 02:58:20,577
Okay. So...

1577
02:58:20,702 --> 02:58:22,370
if Victor wants
to try to save the world

1578
02:58:22,412 --> 02:58:23,955
by fusing with the doom boxes,

1579
02:58:24,081 --> 02:58:26,583
I say we put him
in the doom boxes.

1580
02:58:26,666 --> 02:58:29,544
But getting him in
means attacking that base.

1581
02:58:29,586 --> 02:58:32,047
Fighting the devil and his army

1582
02:58:32,130 --> 02:58:33,382
in hell.

1583
02:58:33,507 --> 02:58:35,550
I mean,
this guy's probably fought

1584
02:58:35,634 --> 02:58:37,886
hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings

1585
02:58:37,969 --> 02:58:39,638
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?

1586
02:58:39,763 --> 02:58:41,390
And we have to assume he's won.

1587
02:58:41,431 --> 02:58:43,183
I don't care
how many demons he's fought

1588
02:58:43,308 --> 02:58:44,601
in how many hells...

1589
02:58:44,726 --> 02:58:48,438
he's never fought us.
Not us united.

1590
02:59:38,697 --> 02:59:40,365
Take that as a "yes."

1591
02:59:40,490 --> 02:59:41,950
What?

1592
02:59:45,370 --> 02:59:46,663
The ring.

1593
02:59:50,333 --> 02:59:51,918
You're really back.

1594
03:00:25,368 --> 03:00:27,704
I have a second chance, Lo.

1595
03:00:29,748 --> 03:00:32,500
And I am not gonna waste it.

1596
03:01:30,517 --> 03:01:31,726
Are you really you?

1597
03:01:31,810 --> 03:01:34,229
I'm really me, Ma.

1598
03:01:51,621 --> 03:01:53,790
Listen, Ma.

1599
03:01:55,125 --> 03:01:57,294
They wanted me back
for a reason.

1600
03:01:58,962 --> 03:02:00,755
I need to find out why.

1601
03:02:20,692 --> 03:02:22,193
How's Victor doing?

1602
03:02:26,489 --> 03:02:29,326
You know,
wanted to be by himself.

1603
03:02:30,827 --> 03:02:33,955
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father

1604
03:02:34,039 --> 03:02:35,624
to go up against
the most powerful machines

1605
03:02:35,707 --> 03:02:37,083
in the universe.

1606
03:02:38,793 --> 03:02:40,337
It's not fair.

1607
03:02:42,005 --> 03:02:43,840
I thought you didn't care?

1608
03:02:45,216 --> 03:02:46,801
I never said that.

1609
03:02:59,564 --> 03:03:01,066
What is it?

1610
03:03:02,692 --> 03:03:04,736
Uh...

1611
03:03:04,861 --> 03:03:07,947
I had a dream,
like, I don't know,

1612
03:03:08,073 --> 03:03:10,659
almost like a premonition.

1613
03:03:10,784 --> 03:03:13,661
It was the end of the world

1614
03:03:13,745 --> 03:03:16,664
and Barry Allen was right here

1615
03:03:16,748 --> 03:03:20,877
and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key."

1616
03:03:23,421 --> 03:03:26,758
She is... to Superman.

1617
03:03:27,634 --> 03:03:29,678
Every heart has one.

1618
03:03:29,803 --> 03:03:31,888
I think it's something more.

1619
03:03:32,597 --> 03:03:34,724
Something darker.

1620
03:03:38,687 --> 03:03:39,688
Master Wayne.

1621
03:03:39,771 --> 03:03:41,940
Master Wayne!

1622
03:03:42,065 --> 03:03:43,983
You need to see this.

1623
03:04:07,257 --> 03:04:08,842
You fixed it.

1624
03:04:08,967 --> 03:04:10,885
It wanted to fly.

1625
03:04:11,928 --> 03:04:13,430
Flight is its nature.

1626
03:04:13,513 --> 03:04:14,931
Yours, too.

1627
03:04:21,396 --> 03:04:23,565
He'll be here, Alfred,
I know it.

1628
03:04:23,648 --> 03:04:25,900
What makes you so sure?

1629
03:04:25,942 --> 03:04:28,820
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

1630
03:04:50,759 --> 03:04:52,385
At last.

1631
03:04:54,095 --> 03:04:57,015
Prepare for his arrival.

1632
03:04:58,725 --> 03:05:02,979
My redemption is nigh.

1633
03:05:10,695 --> 03:05:12,280
Unite.

1634
03:05:17,452 --> 03:05:19,996
Synchronize.

1635
03:06:04,082 --> 03:06:05,542
The satellites revealed

1636
03:06:05,625 --> 03:06:07,043
he's created a defensive dome.

1637
03:06:07,210 --> 03:06:08,419
It's a design flaw.

1638
03:06:08,545 --> 03:06:10,713
Take out the tower,
the dome will fall.

1639
03:06:10,797 --> 03:06:13,007
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.

1640
03:06:13,091 --> 03:06:14,676
Right, probably
'cause he didn't think

1641
03:06:14,759 --> 03:06:16,886
anyone would be that nuts.

1642
03:06:17,720 --> 03:06:19,013
Bruce is right.

1643
03:06:19,055 --> 03:06:20,557
We've got to destroy
the defensive dome

1644
03:06:20,723 --> 03:06:23,184
so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.

1645
03:06:23,268 --> 03:06:25,061
What if the dome's
not destroyed?

1646
03:06:25,186 --> 03:06:26,563
It'll be destroyed.

1647
03:06:26,646 --> 03:06:28,523
Once Victor
is linked with The Unity

1648
03:06:28,606 --> 03:06:29,858
with Barry's help,

1649
03:06:29,983 --> 03:06:31,859
he'll break through
The Unity's defenses.

1650
03:06:31,943 --> 03:06:33,570
Remind me,
how's that again?

1651
03:06:33,653 --> 03:06:35,071
Uh, with the power of love.

1652
03:06:35,238 --> 03:06:38,199
- Barry.
- With a catastrophic energy surge.

1653
03:06:38,283 --> 03:06:39,534
Good.

1654
03:06:39,701 --> 03:06:41,411
You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted

1655
03:06:41,494 --> 03:06:43,913
to generate
a charge of that size.

1656
03:06:44,080 --> 03:06:46,249
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.

1657
03:06:46,332 --> 03:06:49,210
That force should propel him
inside The Unity.

1658
03:06:49,335 --> 03:06:51,296
And, Victor, it's all up to you.

1659
03:06:51,421 --> 03:06:54,632
Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.

1660
03:06:54,757 --> 03:06:58,469
Whew. We actually
finally have a plan.

1661
03:06:58,595 --> 03:07:00,346
We have a plan.

1662
03:07:15,445 --> 03:07:17,530
<i>The symbol</i>
of the house of El means hope.

1663
03:07:17,655 --> 03:07:19,782
<i>Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief</i>

1664
03:07:19,908 --> 03:07:23,911
<i>in the potential of every
person to be a force for good.</i>

1665
03:07:23,995 --> 03:07:25,413
<i>Clark...</i>

1666
03:07:25,496 --> 03:07:27,123
<i>That's what
you can bring them.</i>

1667
03:07:27,248 --> 03:07:28,625
<i>...you were
sent here for a reason.</i>

1668
03:07:28,791 --> 03:07:30,376
<i>You will give
the people of Earth</i>

1669
03:07:30,501 --> 03:07:32,545
<i>an ideal to strive towards.</i>

1670
03:07:32,670 --> 03:07:33,796
<i>And even if it takes you</i>

1671
03:07:33,963 --> 03:07:35,590
<i>the rest of your life,</i>

1672
03:07:35,673 --> 03:07:38,760
<i>you owe it to yourself to
find out what that reason is.</i>

1673
03:07:38,843 --> 03:07:41,596
<i>They will stumble,
they will fall.</i>

1674
03:07:41,679 --> 03:07:43,640
<i>You're gonna
have to make a choice.</i>

1675
03:07:43,806 --> 03:07:46,309
<i>They will join you
in the sun, Kal.</i>

1676
03:07:46,476 --> 03:07:48,311
<i>A choice
of whether to stand proud</i>

1677
03:07:48,478 --> 03:07:50,438
<i>in front of the human race
or not.</i>

1678
03:07:50,521 --> 03:07:54,067
<i>You will help them
accomplish wonders.</i>

1679
03:08:10,833 --> 03:08:15,463
<i>All the hopes and dreams
of Krypton live in you now.</i>

1680
03:08:15,505 --> 03:08:19,133
<i>I'm so proud of you, son.</i>

1681
03:08:19,175 --> 03:08:21,886
<i>Your mother and I
loved you.</i>

1682
03:08:22,011 --> 03:08:23,346
<i>Your mother and I knew</i>

1683
03:08:23,429 --> 03:08:25,598
<i>you would change the world.</i>

1684
03:08:26,891 --> 03:08:29,644
<i>Your heart was tested.</i>

1685
03:08:29,727 --> 03:08:32,438
<i>I know
it's been hard, Clark.</i>

1686
03:08:32,563 --> 03:08:35,525
<i>But you gave hope
to their world.</i>

1687
03:08:35,608 --> 03:08:38,986
<i>You need
to show them who you are.</i>

1688
03:08:39,070 --> 03:08:41,239
<i>Love them, Kal.</i>

1689
03:08:41,364 --> 03:08:43,658
<i>The way we loved you.</i>

1690
03:08:46,077 --> 03:08:47,328
<i>Fly, son.</i>

1691
03:08:48,204 --> 03:08:49,539
<i>It's time.</i>

1692
03:09:53,186 --> 03:09:54,479
I'm gonna take out that tower

1693
03:09:54,604 --> 03:09:56,522
and knock down that shield dome.

1694
03:09:56,647 --> 03:09:57,690
Whatever you see,

1695
03:09:58,983 --> 03:10:01,110
stick to the plan.

1696
03:10:02,612 --> 03:10:04,781
It's why I brought you together.

1697
03:10:44,654 --> 03:10:46,656
Bruce, pull back.
You're not gonna make it.

1698
03:10:49,534 --> 03:10:52,495
Just have to knock
a little louder.

1699
03:11:17,562 --> 03:11:19,021
Kill him!

1700
03:11:19,146 --> 03:11:21,899
Get to the carriage.
Defend The Unity.

1701
03:11:26,863 --> 03:11:28,155
Oh, shit.

1702
03:11:48,092 --> 03:11:49,468
The tower's down.

1703
03:11:51,012 --> 03:11:52,930
Do you read me?

1704
03:11:53,055 --> 03:11:54,307
Uh, yeah, loud and clear.

1705
03:11:55,224 --> 03:11:56,684
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1706
03:11:57,894 --> 03:12:00,730
<i>Bruce? Bruce?</i>

1707
03:12:00,813 --> 03:12:01,689
Get to the reactor.

1708
03:12:01,772 --> 03:12:03,274
I'll lure as many
of these monsters

1709
03:12:03,399 --> 03:12:05,401
- away from you as I can.
- What does that mean?

1710
03:12:08,279 --> 03:12:10,239
Don't worry about me.
Get to The Unity.

1711
03:12:12,992 --> 03:12:14,076
They're here.

1712
03:12:14,160 --> 03:12:15,411
<i>Bruce?</i>

1713
03:12:18,247 --> 03:12:19,707
Comm went dead.

1714
03:12:21,292 --> 03:12:22,668
Let's go.

1715
03:13:01,457 --> 03:13:03,459
Come on, follow me,
you damn insects.

1716
03:14:23,080 --> 03:14:24,582
<i>Critical damage.</i>

1717
03:15:04,455 --> 03:15:05,790
You really are outta your mind.

1718
03:15:32,566 --> 03:15:33,901
You're welcome.

1719
03:15:33,984 --> 03:15:35,528
My man.

1720
03:17:08,287 --> 03:17:10,039
Yeah, we got this.

1721
03:17:10,164 --> 03:17:11,373
You go do your thing.

1722
03:18:07,304 --> 03:18:08,889
I'm assuming you're Alfred.

1723
03:18:10,641 --> 03:18:12,017
Master Kent.

1724
03:18:13,852 --> 03:18:15,646
He said you'd come.

1725
03:18:17,022 --> 03:18:20,776
Now, let's hope
you're not too late.

1726
03:18:31,495 --> 03:18:33,872
Hey!

1727
03:18:41,797 --> 03:18:43,215
Remember me?

1728
03:18:45,676 --> 03:18:47,177
Round two?

1729
03:18:47,803 --> 03:18:49,096
Hell yeah.

1730
03:19:10,534 --> 03:19:11,994
Shall we?

1731
03:19:12,828 --> 03:19:15,080
Tell me, Amazon,

1732
03:19:15,205 --> 03:19:19,251
why did you
abandon your own sisters

1733
03:19:19,376 --> 03:19:21,962
only to cast your lot
with these creatures

1734
03:19:22,046 --> 03:19:25,507
clinging to their puny lives?

1735
03:19:25,633 --> 03:19:28,594
You weren't there
to protect them from me.

1736
03:19:28,719 --> 03:19:30,637
And, sadly, you could have.

1737
03:20:11,720 --> 03:20:13,430
Barry, I'm in position.

1738
03:20:32,116 --> 03:20:35,452
Okay.
I built the charge.

1739
03:20:35,577 --> 03:20:36,537
<i>You call it.</i>

1740
03:20:37,746 --> 03:20:39,581
Barry, on one.

1741
03:20:39,706 --> 03:20:41,917
Three, two...

1742
03:20:44,795 --> 03:20:46,547
Get the hell off me!

1743
03:20:46,672 --> 03:20:48,132
Victor!

1744
03:21:24,209 --> 03:21:25,836
Victor!

1745
03:21:29,548 --> 03:21:31,925
I watched your island burn,

1746
03:21:32,050 --> 03:21:35,637
your sisters
begging for their lives.

1747
03:21:35,804 --> 03:21:38,390
As did your mother.

1748
03:21:38,515 --> 03:21:39,475
Liar.

1749
03:22:05,083 --> 03:22:07,252
I can't maintain this!

1750
03:22:08,003 --> 03:22:09,171
Victor!

1751
03:22:31,193 --> 03:22:33,529
Victor, I can't hold this!

1752
03:22:40,035 --> 03:22:42,454
For Darkseid.

1753
03:22:46,458 --> 03:22:48,919
Not impressed.

1754
03:23:33,338 --> 03:23:34,506
All right.

1755
03:23:34,631 --> 03:23:36,258
Kal-El.

1756
03:24:14,504 --> 03:24:16,923
Barry, I'm connected
to The Unity.

1757
03:24:16,965 --> 03:24:19,134
I need the charge to get inside.

1758
03:24:40,989 --> 03:24:42,199
Barry?

1759
03:24:42,991 --> 03:24:44,785
Barry, are you okay?

1760
03:24:46,203 --> 03:24:47,287
<i>Barry!</i>

1761
03:24:47,412 --> 03:24:48,580
I got the wind
knocked out of me.

1762
03:24:48,705 --> 03:24:51,458
Need a few seconds, that's all!

1763
03:25:08,350 --> 03:25:10,894
Barry, where are you?
It's almost synchronized!

1764
03:25:11,019 --> 03:25:13,021
Okay, okay.

1765
03:25:13,146 --> 03:25:15,857
Oh, my God. Gotta heal, Barry.

1766
03:25:15,983 --> 03:25:17,693
Heal. Heal.

1767
03:25:43,552 --> 03:25:45,220
Barry!

1768
03:25:57,983 --> 03:25:59,735
It's too late.

1769
03:26:00,986 --> 03:26:02,529
Oh, no.

1770
03:26:06,742 --> 03:26:08,410
He's here!

1771
03:26:37,814 --> 03:26:39,065
Okay.

1772
03:26:39,191 --> 03:26:40,233
Just gotta go faster
than the speed of light.

1773
03:26:40,317 --> 03:26:41,401
Far beyond the speed of light.

1774
03:26:41,443 --> 03:26:42,611
You gotta break the rule, Barry,

1775
03:26:42,778 --> 03:26:44,821
and you gotta do it now.

1776
03:26:57,918 --> 03:26:59,628
Dad...

1777
03:27:03,340 --> 03:27:05,801
whatever happens,
I want you to know

1778
03:27:08,386 --> 03:27:10,555
your kid was one of them, Dad.

1779
03:27:13,517 --> 03:27:15,644
One of the best of the best.

1780
03:28:11,074 --> 03:28:13,660
Make your own future.

1781
03:28:20,083 --> 03:28:22,210
Make your own past.

1782
03:28:26,464 --> 03:28:30,302
It's all right now.

1783
03:29:17,140 --> 03:29:19,476
We've been waiting
for you, Victor.

1784
03:29:20,435 --> 03:29:22,646
My broken boy.

1785
03:29:24,814 --> 03:29:27,067
You don't have to be
alone anymore.

1786
03:29:27,108 --> 03:29:28,860
We'll be together again.

1787
03:29:36,534 --> 03:29:38,787
we can put it back, Vic.

1788
03:29:43,124 --> 03:29:45,377
Make you whole again.

1789
03:29:57,097 --> 03:29:58,848
I'm not broken.

1790
03:30:08,483 --> 03:30:10,527
And I'm not alone.

1791
03:30:27,210 --> 03:30:28,378
Superman!

1792
03:31:58,968 --> 03:32:00,929
I told you

1793
03:32:02,430 --> 03:32:05,100
Steppenwolf would fail.

1794
03:32:06,101 --> 03:32:09,771
Yes. Yes, you did.

1795
03:32:10,355 --> 03:32:11,648
My master,

1796
03:32:11,773 --> 03:32:15,568
now that the Mother Boxes
have been destroyed,

1797
03:32:15,610 --> 03:32:19,572
how will you retrieve
your great prize?

1798
03:32:19,656 --> 03:32:22,992
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.

1799
03:32:23,118 --> 03:32:28,039
And we will stop
at nothing to possess it.

1800
03:32:31,167 --> 03:32:32,794
Ready the armada.

1801
03:32:33,545 --> 03:32:36,047
We will use the old ways.

1802
03:35:00,149 --> 03:35:02,652
<i>Your father twice over.</i>

1803
03:35:09,742 --> 03:35:12,287
<i>Now, let me speak to you
from my heart,</i>

1804
03:35:12,370 --> 03:35:14,247
<i>not as a scientist,</i>

1805
03:35:14,289 --> 03:35:15,873
<i>as a father.</i>

1806
03:35:15,999 --> 03:35:19,252
<i>Your father twice over.</i>

1807
03:35:21,504 --> 03:35:25,091
<i>I brought you into the world
and back to it.</i>

1808
03:35:25,174 --> 03:35:29,429
<i>You can't imagine how proud
I am of who you are.</i>

1809
03:35:29,512 --> 03:35:31,222
<i>Have always been.</i>

1810
03:35:33,182 --> 03:35:34,642
<i>So many years with you I wasted.</i>

1811
03:35:34,726 --> 03:35:38,229
<i>So many wrongs
I've left un-righted.</i>

1812
03:35:40,648 --> 03:35:42,859
<i>Everything breaks, Victor.</i>

1813
03:35:42,984 --> 03:35:45,361
<i>Everything changes.</i>

1814
03:35:55,955 --> 03:35:58,166
I gotta go see my father.

1815
03:36:33,701 --> 03:36:35,578
<i>The world is hurt.</i>

1816
03:36:35,703 --> 03:36:36,788
<i>Broken.</i>

1817
03:36:36,913 --> 03:36:39,248
<i>Unexchangeable.</i>

1818
03:36:39,374 --> 03:36:41,250
Ship's all yours now, kid.

1819
03:36:41,376 --> 03:36:42,794
You're the boss.

1820
03:36:44,879 --> 03:36:48,174
"Ryan Choi,
Director of Nanotechnology."

1821
03:36:48,299 --> 03:36:49,884
That's your thing.

1822
03:36:50,468 --> 03:36:52,345
Uh, yep.

1823
03:36:52,428 --> 03:36:54,097
That's my thing.

1824
03:36:58,976 --> 03:37:03,231
<i>But the world's
not fixed in the past,</i>

1825
03:37:03,314 --> 03:37:04,399
<i>only the future.</i>

1826
03:37:06,150 --> 03:37:10,029
<i>The not yet. The now.</i>

1827
03:37:10,154 --> 03:37:13,699
Wow.
Must be 100, 150 feet.

1828
03:37:13,783 --> 03:37:15,243
Must be.

1829
03:37:16,411 --> 03:37:17,912
Big round table.

1830
03:37:18,037 --> 03:37:20,331
Six chairs, right there.

1831
03:37:21,457 --> 03:37:23,126
But room for more.

1832
03:37:25,461 --> 03:37:27,171
But room for more.

1833
03:37:28,214 --> 03:37:29,799
God help us.

1834
03:37:31,634 --> 03:37:33,803
<i>The now is you.</i>

1835
03:37:37,432 --> 03:37:38,724
What?

1836
03:37:38,933 --> 03:37:41,727
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1837
03:37:41,769 --> 03:37:44,313
But, uh, my foot's in the door.

1838
03:37:44,439 --> 03:37:46,107
This is like a "job" job?

1839
03:37:46,774 --> 03:37:48,025
"Job" job.

1840
03:37:51,612 --> 03:37:54,240
Your foot's in the door.

1841
03:37:56,534 --> 03:37:57,618
Isn't that a thing people say?

1842
03:37:57,785 --> 03:37:59,745
Your foot's in the door.

1843
03:37:59,829 --> 03:38:02,123
Yeah, that's something
people say, man.

1844
03:38:02,206 --> 03:38:03,833
His foot's in the door!

1845
03:38:03,958 --> 03:38:06,627
- That's my boy, right there!
- Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

1846
03:38:06,711 --> 03:38:08,004
Taught him nothing he knows.

1847
03:38:08,129 --> 03:38:09,255
- Yes!
- Dad, you're gonna

1848
03:38:09,338 --> 03:38:10,339
get maced again.

1849
03:38:13,718 --> 03:38:15,595
No stopping you now.

1850
03:38:17,638 --> 03:38:18,848
Thanks, Dad.

1851
03:38:18,973 --> 03:38:20,224
<i>Now.</i>

1852
03:38:20,349 --> 03:38:23,311
<i>Now's your time, Victor,
to rise.</i>

1853
03:38:23,436 --> 03:38:26,439
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

1854
03:38:26,522 --> 03:38:30,193
I just undid a mistake,
that's all.

1855
03:38:40,369 --> 03:38:43,414
How did you get the house
back from the bank?

1856
03:38:43,539 --> 03:38:45,500
I bought the bank.

1857
03:38:47,877 --> 03:38:50,463
Congratulations, by the way.

1858
03:38:50,546 --> 03:38:52,131
<i>Do this. Be this.</i>

1859
03:38:52,256 --> 03:38:57,470
<i>The man I never was.
The hero you are.</i>

1860
03:38:57,512 --> 03:38:59,847
<i>Take your place
among the brave ones.</i>

1861
03:38:59,931 --> 03:39:05,228
<i>The ones that were, that are,
that are yet to be.</i>

1862
03:39:37,802 --> 03:39:40,888
<i>It's time you stand,</i>

1863
03:39:44,559 --> 03:39:46,102
<i>fight,</i>

1864
03:39:48,646 --> 03:39:50,147
<i>discover,</i>

1865
03:39:54,735 --> 03:39:57,029
<i>heal, love,</i>

1866
03:40:00,533 --> 03:40:01,534
<i>win.</i>

1867
03:40:28,019 --> 03:40:29,854
<i>The time</i>

1868
03:40:29,979 --> 03:40:31,439
<i>is now.</i>

1869
03:40:40,615 --> 03:40:41,824
Ready?

1870
03:40:41,949 --> 03:40:43,075
Come on, Stevens.

1871
03:40:46,829 --> 03:40:48,289
All right,
let's keep it moving.

1872
03:40:50,041 --> 03:40:51,292
Keep going.

1873
03:40:52,960 --> 03:40:54,962
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

1874
03:40:58,507 --> 03:40:59,592
Luthor.

1875
03:41:04,430 --> 03:41:05,598
Open up two, Carl, please.

1876
03:41:14,732 --> 03:41:16,150
Luthor.

1877
03:41:21,030 --> 03:41:22,448
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,

1878
03:41:22,573 --> 03:41:24,367
or I'm gonna
have to come in there.

1879
03:42:52,913 --> 03:42:55,040
Ah, there he is.

1880
03:42:55,624 --> 03:42:56,917
Welcome aboard.

1881
03:42:57,001 --> 03:42:58,669
Care for a glass
of Gout de Diamants?

1882
03:42:58,794 --> 03:43:00,713
I was just celebrating
God's return.

1883
03:43:00,755 --> 03:43:03,257
Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1884
03:43:03,340 --> 03:43:06,010
I heard you were
a few clowns short of a circus.

1885
03:43:06,135 --> 03:43:07,678
I was, thank you,

1886
03:43:07,803 --> 03:43:10,055
until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me

1887
03:43:10,139 --> 03:43:12,266
find some much needed clarity.

1888
03:43:12,349 --> 03:43:14,685
Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat

1889
03:43:14,810 --> 03:43:15,770
free of charge.

1890
03:43:15,936 --> 03:43:17,730
Why the pro bono work?

1891
03:43:17,772 --> 03:43:19,565
It's personal.

1892
03:43:19,690 --> 03:43:22,735
Ah, let me guess,
an eye for an eye?

1893
03:43:24,653 --> 03:43:26,447
You said you had something
I'd want?

1894
03:43:26,530 --> 03:43:28,073
You'd better not be
wasting my time.

1895
03:43:28,115 --> 03:43:30,242
Ooh. And endure
your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

1896
03:43:30,326 --> 03:43:32,161
No, I wouldn't think of it.

1897
03:43:32,286 --> 03:43:33,496
Uh, I have too much to live for.

1898
03:43:33,621 --> 03:43:36,749
And more important things to do.

1899
03:43:36,874 --> 03:43:40,252
But if you want the Batman,

1900
03:43:40,377 --> 03:43:43,631
here is something
that can help you.

1901
03:43:44,965 --> 03:43:49,220
His name is Bruce Wayne.

1902
03:43:52,223 --> 03:43:54,725
Hmm. On second thought,

1903
03:43:56,852 --> 03:43:59,146
we do have something
to celebrate.

1904
03:44:00,022 --> 03:44:01,565
Good boy.

1905
03:45:05,880 --> 03:45:07,214
Clear.

1906
03:45:12,386 --> 03:45:14,221
How much further?

1907
03:45:15,264 --> 03:45:16,557
We're almost there.

1908
03:45:18,559 --> 03:45:20,269
Well, we need to hurry.

1909
03:45:20,394 --> 03:45:22,021
We can't be out in the open
much longer.

1910
03:45:22,104 --> 03:45:23,772
He'll come for us.

1911
03:45:26,609 --> 03:45:28,736
Let him come.

1912
03:45:28,903 --> 03:45:30,571
Let the bastard come.

1913
03:45:31,739 --> 03:45:33,991
I'll stab this through his heart

1914
03:45:34,116 --> 03:45:36,285
for what he did to Arthur.

1915
03:45:36,410 --> 03:45:38,537
I want to make him pay.

1916
03:45:39,914 --> 03:45:42,875
I understand how you feel, Mera.

1917
03:45:42,958 --> 03:45:45,628
You have no idea how I feel.

1918
03:45:45,753 --> 03:45:47,588
But we have to stick to the plan

1919
03:45:47,755 --> 03:45:50,132
to have any chance
to make this right.

1920
03:45:58,015 --> 03:46:01,518
Who have you ever loved?

1921
03:46:15,491 --> 03:46:18,786
<i>Au contraire,</i>
my little fish stick.

1922
03:46:22,414 --> 03:46:24,083
He knows exactly what it's like

1923
03:46:24,124 --> 03:46:25,918
to lose someone he loves.

1924
03:46:27,878 --> 03:46:30,297
You know, like, uh,

1925
03:46:31,340 --> 03:46:32,841
a father,

1926
03:46:34,259 --> 03:46:36,428
like a mother.

1927
03:46:36,512 --> 03:46:39,723
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

1928
03:46:41,308 --> 03:46:43,477
Like an adopted son.

1929
03:46:47,106 --> 03:46:48,774
Isn't that right,

1930
03:46:50,192 --> 03:46:51,777
Batman?

1931
03:46:54,989 --> 03:46:56,323
Maybe, in a way,

1932
03:46:56,407 --> 03:46:58,325
that smelly
old flounder is right.

1933
03:46:59,868 --> 03:47:02,621
Because how many
can die in your arms

1934
03:47:02,705 --> 03:47:04,456
before you grow numb to death?

1935
03:47:05,958 --> 03:47:08,711
That's not very careful.

1936
03:47:08,836 --> 03:47:12,631
And how many dead eyes
can you look into

1937
03:47:12,673 --> 03:47:15,551
before you die inside yourself?

1938
03:47:15,676 --> 03:47:19,388
I've been dead inside
a long time,

1939
03:47:19,513 --> 03:47:21,473
but even I have a limit.

1940
03:47:21,557 --> 03:47:23,392
And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will...

1941
03:47:23,517 --> 03:47:26,395
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

1942
03:47:26,520 --> 03:47:28,522
You won't kill me.

1943
03:47:29,231 --> 03:47:31,316
I'm your best friend.

1944
03:47:31,400 --> 03:47:35,821
Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around?

1945
03:47:37,865 --> 03:47:39,324
Anyway,

1946
03:47:40,409 --> 03:47:41,994
you need me.

1947
03:47:43,037 --> 03:47:44,788
You

1948
03:47:44,913 --> 03:47:47,750
need me to help you
undo this world

1949
03:47:47,875 --> 03:47:50,753
you created by letting her die.

1950
03:47:53,255 --> 03:47:55,215
Poor Lois.

1951
03:47:55,299 --> 03:47:58,093
How she suffered so!

1952
03:48:04,058 --> 03:48:06,226
I often wonder

1953
03:48:06,393 --> 03:48:08,187
how many alternate timelines

1954
03:48:08,312 --> 03:48:10,647
do you destroy
the world because...

1955
03:48:11,565 --> 03:48:13,192
frankly, you don't have

1956
03:48:13,317 --> 03:48:15,903
the cojones to die yourself.

1957
03:48:16,904 --> 03:48:18,447
Hmm?

1958
03:48:20,407 --> 03:48:21,575
So, as usual,

1959
03:48:21,700 --> 03:48:24,411
I'll be the bigger man.

1960
03:48:28,082 --> 03:48:29,666
A truce,

1961
03:48:30,375 --> 03:48:32,086
Bruce.

1962
03:48:34,421 --> 03:48:38,634
As long as you
have this card, a truce.

1963
03:48:41,512 --> 03:48:42,513
But all you have to do

1964
03:48:42,638 --> 03:48:43,722
is tear it in half

1965
03:48:43,847 --> 03:48:45,265
and I'm happy
to discuss with you

1966
03:48:45,391 --> 03:48:47,976
in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder

1967
03:48:49,645 --> 03:48:51,647
to do a man's job?

1968
03:48:55,025 --> 03:48:56,693
You know, it's funny

1969
03:48:56,819 --> 03:48:58,278
that you would talk about people

1970
03:48:58,362 --> 03:48:59,863
who died in my arms

1971
03:48:59,988 --> 03:49:01,740
because when I held Harley Quinn

1972
03:49:01,824 --> 03:49:04,410
and she was bleeding and dying,

1973
03:49:04,535 --> 03:49:08,247
she begged me
with her last breath

1974
03:49:08,288 --> 03:49:10,582
that when I killed you,

1975
03:49:10,666 --> 03:49:14,253
and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you...

1976
03:49:14,336 --> 03:49:16,171
that I'd do it slow.

1977
03:49:17,381 --> 03:49:19,508
I'm gonna honor that promise.

1978
03:49:49,997 --> 03:49:52,833
Oh. You're good.

1979
03:49:57,045 --> 03:49:58,714
You almost had me.

1980
03:50:17,941 --> 03:50:19,193
Where are we holing up?

1981
03:50:19,359 --> 03:50:21,820
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

1982
03:50:21,862 --> 03:50:24,823
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?

1983
03:50:24,907 --> 03:50:27,701
What do you think?

1984
03:50:33,624 --> 03:50:34,791
He's found us.

1985
03:52:03,797 --> 03:52:06,341
Can I help you?

1986
03:52:06,466 --> 03:52:10,095
I'm sure you know Darkseid
is not finished with Earth.

1987
03:52:10,137 --> 03:52:13,223
The Anti-Life Equation
is here somewhere.

1988
03:52:13,348 --> 03:52:16,351
We have to find it
before he does.

1989
03:52:16,476 --> 03:52:18,353
There's a war coming.

1990
03:52:18,478 --> 03:52:20,314
And I'm here to help.

1991
03:52:20,439 --> 03:52:22,649
I'm sorry, who are you again?

1992
03:52:22,774 --> 03:52:24,901
I've gone by many names

1993
03:52:25,027 --> 03:52:28,238
and taken many forms.
And like you,

1994
03:52:28,363 --> 03:52:31,033
I've realized I have
a stake in this world

1995
03:52:31,158 --> 03:52:33,910
and it's time
I started fighting for it.

1996
03:52:34,494 --> 03:52:35,829
Oh.

1997
03:52:37,205 --> 03:52:39,499
Well, we could
definitely use the help.

1998
03:52:39,666 --> 03:52:43,003
So, glad you're here.

1999
03:52:44,004 --> 03:52:45,130
You know, I never thought

2000
03:52:45,172 --> 03:52:46,381
I'd see the defenders of Earth

2001
03:52:46,506 --> 03:52:49,343
united and fighting as one.

2002
03:52:49,426 --> 03:52:52,095
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.

2003
03:52:53,305 --> 03:52:55,974
Your mother and father
would be proud.

2004
03:52:57,267 --> 03:52:58,393
I hope so.

2005
03:53:04,483 --> 03:53:07,402
Well, I'll be in touch.

2006
03:53:08,445 --> 03:53:12,532
Oh, and some have called me

2007
03:53:12,658 --> 03:53:15,035
the Martian Manhunter.

2008
03:53:22,626 --> 03:53:25,087
I guess I'll see you around.

2009
