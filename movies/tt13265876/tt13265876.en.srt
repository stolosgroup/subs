3
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:57,319
Hey.

4
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:01,122
New signal.

5
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:03,392
Hi, honey.

6
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,795
Yeah, just tell your sister,
I'll be home in about an hour.

7
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:08,063
We're just finishing
our round of golf.

8
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:11,333
I love you, too.

9
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,603
Hey!

10
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:15,371
Shut up and fight.

11
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,194
Fuck you, Rainsford.

12
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:40,696
See you in the next one, Mitch.

13
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,230
Yeah, if my luck runs out.

14
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:43,799
Hey, Rain Man, I got a question.

15
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,434
- Yeah?
- Who do you think you are?

16
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:47,202
- Hm.
- Think you can come here

17
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,472
and take my kill because you're
some big shot doctor.

18
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:50,840
I don't even want to be here.

19
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:52,608
Remember your father said to you
when he asked you

20
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:55,778
- to run his company?
- You're just too fucking slow.

21
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:57,380
You're gonna send me
back to rehab.

22
00:02:57,413 --> 00:02:59,549
Too fucking slow.

23
00:02:59,582 --> 00:03:02,451
That's... what?
What do you even mean by that?

24
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:06,556
- You know what, fuck you, man.
- Mm-hmm.

25
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:09,692
<i>Congratulations on another
win, Dr. Rainsford.</i>

26
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:12,595
The prey is already
in your trophy room.

27
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:15,831
My enthusiasm for your sport
is coming to an end.

28
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:19,602
<i>Perhaps you might enjoy being
the prey instead of the hunter.</i>

29
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:22,605
Don't mistake my boredom
for suicidal tendencies.

30
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:24,807
<i>You are a most valued client.</i>

31
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,544
Prove it.
Find me a real challenge.

32
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:12,253
Hey, sweetheart,
what's with the look?

33
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:15,891
You know these guys
are professionals, right?

34
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:18,527
They're going to make
your hunters see God.

35
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:21,664
They look like
gutter punk brawlers.

36
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,868
The last prey you sold me
didn't make it to midnight

37
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:27,670
on the first day.

38
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:29,739
Are you fucking blind?

39
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,907
These are the best ones
in the prison.

40
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:35,411
They're the best ones
in the whole Pacific Northwest.

41
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:36,912
See that one over there?

42
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:40,348
He's got more kills
than Shirley fucking Temple's

43
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:41,784
got curls.

44
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:43,853
The prey doesn't just need
to know how to kill.

45
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:46,522
They need to know how
to evade detection, to deceive,

46
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:48,758
to plant red herrings.

47
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,259
Not one of your prisoners
would pose a real threat

48
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,862
to the hunter.

49
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:04,205
What about this one?
Why have I never seen him?

50
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,841
You don't want that one.

51
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,944
Look, he used to be
something great.

52
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:10,680
He's at the end of his rope now.

53
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:12,548
His numbers are off the charts.

54
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:14,249
He's a fucking degenerate.

55
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:16,786
You don't know half the shit
that guy's done.

56
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,622
I don't trust him.
I can't trust him.

57
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:21,289
He's so dangerous
that we've kept him

58
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:23,859
in a sensory deprivation cell
since he got here.

59
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:27,697
He hasn't even talked to another
person in over seven years.

60
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,832
He's broken laws that
you haven't even thought of.

61
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:33,469
Escaped three prisons,
wanted in 47 states,

62
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:37,973
broken 21 bones,
in and out of jail.

63
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:41,644
Who the hell is Thomas Malone?

64
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:44,680
If you want your hunters to
have a fucking chance,

65
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:46,582
you don't want him.

66
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:12,975
Hey, buddy. Are you lost?

67
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:16,412
No, I'm right where
I want to be.

68
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:17,913
I read your file.

69
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:20,483
Holy hell, sir.
How are you still alive?

70
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:23,352
Come closer and I'll show you.

71
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:26,489
I'm literally a hologram.

72
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:29,558
I have never put myself
in a room with a killer.

73
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:31,393
I'm your only hope.

74
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:33,696
This is the end of the line.

75
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:35,364
Before they put you
in this cage,

76
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:37,733
you owed money
to the North Road 88s,

77
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:41,504
the Triad, La Nostra,
two cartels that I know of,

78
00:06:41,537 --> 00:06:44,607
a dozen West Coast loan sharks
and East Coast Shylocks,

79
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,944
the IRS, the CRA,
the FRS wants you dead.

80
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:50,546
I'm a popular guy.

81
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,915
How you stayed alive
this long is beyond me.

82
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:55,818
The luck of the Irish.

83
00:06:57,753 --> 00:07:00,356
It was a waste of time
coming here.

84
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:01,857
Enjoy the rest of her day.

85
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:04,059
You're coming on
a little strong.

86
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:08,531
Am I? Thomas Ernest Malone,
O-neg.

87
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:10,366
Fuckin' cop.

88
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,902
What kind of cop
dresses this good?

89
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:15,070
I'm a game master.

90
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:18,007
We have a private game set
for tomorrow.

91
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,909
It won't be broadcast.

92
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:22,111
I'll take my chances here.

93
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:26,515
Oh, whoop,
life without parole.

94
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:28,717
That's what you're facing.

95
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:31,787
Win, and I can guarantee
your freedom.

96
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:35,024
Maybe you could settle down,
visit the grandkids.

97
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:38,761
Great kids?
I don't have any grandkids.

98
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,729
Yes, you do. Two.

99
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:43,065
Your eldest son, Michael,

100
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:46,602
he and his wife welcomed
a pair of twins last year,

101
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:48,370
a boy and a girl.

102
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:53,676
They live up in a faraway
magical land called Vancouver.

103
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,613
Okay, I'm in.

104
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:04,553
But I want them taken care of.
I'm a grandfather now.

105
00:08:04,587 --> 00:08:05,621
Done.

106
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:09,558
This is an employee agreement.

107
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:11,560
You will sign
your rights to Apex,

108
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:15,831
a subsidiary of
Zaroff Megas Industries, LLC.

109
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:17,666
There's a box to write down
what you want to written

110
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,805
on your tombstone or a fun
anecdote a eulogy, perhaps.

111
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:26,475
Otherwise, sign and initial.

112
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:28,744
Even if you lose,

113
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:32,681
well, looking at the way
your life is headed,

114
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:34,984
death might be an upgrade.

115
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:17,012
<i>Welcome to Apex.</i>

116
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:21,717
<i>Where all your bloody delights
can be brought to life.</i>

117
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,661
<i>Leave the laws of man at home</i>

118
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:35,230
<i>and come dance
on the dark side.</i>

119
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:37,232
<i>For an unforgettable weekend.</i>

120
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:38,767
<i>No!</i>

121
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:46,308
<i>Apex, game on.</i>

122
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:59,721
<i>The hunters are arriving.</i>

123
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:01,990
<i>Their lodge will be on
the north side of the island,</i>

124
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:05,395
<i>so I recommend
staying away from there.</i>

125
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:07,863
<i>Apex is quite simple.</i>

126
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:11,800
<i>There are six hunters.
You are the prey.</i>

127
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:14,069
So what if I kill
all the hunters?

128
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:18,807
<i>That has never been done.</i>

129
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:21,110
<i>There have been some
accidents in the past,</i>

130
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:24,813
<i>but Apex has never
lost a hunter.</i>

131
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:27,349
<i>Some have been trained
by the best in the world</i>

132
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:33,155
Training and experience
are very different things.

133
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:34,790
<i>Precisely.</i>

134
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:38,961
<i>So what if I kill
all the hunters?</i>

135
00:12:38,994 --> 00:12:43,098
<i>Then it's game over,
red rover, you win.</i>

136
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:45,267
<i>On Apex Island,
there are no laws,</i>

137
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,103
<i>only winning and losing.</i>

138
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:49,771
You do these a lot?

139
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:51,407
<i>One per month.</i>

140
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:54,243
<i>And we have a wait list
for hunters longer than your...</i>

141
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:59,882
What's the price
for hunting humans?

142
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:02,284
<i>Depends on the rating
of the prey.</i>

143
00:13:02,317 --> 00:13:06,955
<i>10.9 to 11.
What to know how you rated?</i>

144
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:09,958
No.

145
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:12,861
<i>I expect the hunters
will underestimate you.</i>

146
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:15,797
Not exactly the smartest people.

147
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:18,834
<i>Each of them come here
for their own reasons.</i>

148
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:22,070
<i>Same as you, I suppose.</i>

149
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:24,907
<i>If the prey wins,
I take solace in knowing</i>

150
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,808
<i>I changed their life.</i>

151
00:13:26,842 --> 00:13:28,877
You're a real saint.

152
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:32,181
<i>I always saw myself as Gandhi.</i>

153
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:35,485
<i>Enlightenment through
blood sport.</i>

154
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:41,457
Hey, these hunters,
they like each other?

155
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,762
<i>Good luck, Mr. Malone.</i>

156
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,278
Lyle, my man.
What's up, playboy?

157
00:14:03,312 --> 00:14:06,882
Well, well, well,
they let you out of rehab.

158
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:08,817
Yep, the old man says
he'd let me back home

159
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,852
if I get a kill
before his birthday.

160
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:12,455
And speaking of your dad,
I've been trying to

161
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:14,056
get a hold of him.

162
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,757
He hasn't gotten back to me.
Is he all right?

163
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:16,992
I got this triple-A
investment on me.

164
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:18,827
- Yeah, yeah.
- He's gonna love this.

165
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,963
- I'll ask him to call you.
- It's a bull market, my friend.

166
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:22,064
No time like the present.

167
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,968
Fear not, fear God.

168
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:28,471
Fear only the women and wine.

169
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:30,772
For the Good Lord has delivered,

170
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:33,108
and I have arrived.

171
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:34,477
What's going on us, fuckos?

172
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,012
This fuckin' guy?
West, I want to refund, alright?

173
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:39,181
It's him or me.
Get me out of here.

174
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:40,849
Don't be such
a little wuss child.

175
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:42,251
Last time we did
an Apex together,

176
00:14:42,284 --> 00:14:44,019
you almost fucking
lynched me, you nut job.

177
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:46,822
Don't blame me for you
walking into one of my traps.

178
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:50,025
What kind of monster
lynches someone, Bishop?

179
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:52,861
Probably your ancestors.

180
00:14:52,894 --> 00:14:55,931
- Relax.
- Okay, easy. Whoa, whoa.

181
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:58,434
- Look at you, Bishop.
- Ooh, yeah.

182
00:14:58,468 --> 00:15:00,936
What are you benching nowadays?

183
00:15:00,969 --> 00:15:05,441
What does your mom weight?
Is it 220 or 240?

184
00:15:05,475 --> 00:15:07,943
280. She's back on
the Ben and Jerry's.

185
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:12,948
So what, you think the Rainmaker
is going to show?

186
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:14,816
I hope not.

187
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,185
Yeah, well, you couldn't win
even if your daddy paid for it.

188
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:19,455
Hey, man, at least
his businesses make money.

189
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,492
Yeah, exactly remind us,
how did you make

190
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:24,059
your fortune, Bishop?

191
00:15:24,092 --> 00:15:25,461
Oh, that's right.

192
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,463
You inherited
2 trillion from your brother.

193
00:15:27,497 --> 00:15:29,499
What do you got left,
a billion and a half?

194
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:31,933
Hm. No.

195
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,336
The markets, they...
they've gone...

196
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,904
Nobody knows.

197
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:38,441
Buy low, sell high.
Pretty easy, compadre.

198
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:40,410
If you learned to read,
you might have had a chance of,

199
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:43,045
you know, not pissing away
your whole family's fortune.

200
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:44,580
- You got such a big mouth.
- Easy.

201
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:48,216
- Not you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

202
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,053
Oh, and here I was hoping
for a much better class

203
00:15:51,086 --> 00:15:54,056
of hunter on this one.

204
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:56,091
Hello, Bishop.

205
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:57,560
Hello.

206
00:15:57,593 --> 00:16:00,162
Well, you'll get no better
than me, little Jeza.

207
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:03,366
Mr. Lyle.

208
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,033
-Milady.

209
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:06,868
And I don't believe we've met.

210
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:08,504
I'm, uh...

211
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:10,440
Well, the thing is, uh...

212
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:13,208
Please excuse the boy.

213
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:15,645
He's my mentally
handicapped manservant.

214
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:17,913
I purchased him from
an orphanage out in,

215
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:19,549
oh, Brooklyn, actually.

216
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,419
- Seriously.
- Tap out already.

217
00:16:23,453 --> 00:16:25,954
Hey, animals.

218
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:27,523
- Ah!
- Get off.

219
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:29,257
Carrion, you cunt.

220
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,094
I thought you got religion
or another wife

221
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:34,029
or some sort of shit like that.

222
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:36,932
You don't talk to me.

223
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:38,534
Ever.

224
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:40,168
You know,
if you got something to say,

225
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:41,437
why don't you look at me?

226
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,172
Carrion, play nice.

227
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:46,609
Okay. We're all friends here.
All right?

228
00:16:46,642 --> 00:16:48,343
We're all mates, except Ecka.

229
00:16:48,378 --> 00:16:50,613
Nobody really likes that guy.

230
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:52,114
Whoa.

231
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:53,383
Come on. Come on.

232
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,650
We doing this again? Guys.

233
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:56,318
- Got you.
- Hey.

234
00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:58,521
Come on.
Show me what we can do.

235
00:16:58,554 --> 00:17:01,256
You think you're strong,
but you're just tall.

236
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:16,171
Is that
the best you've got?

237
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:17,707
Is that it?

238
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:26,915
Dr. Rainsford.

239
00:17:48,704 --> 00:17:50,972
Let's begin.

240
00:17:56,344 --> 00:18:00,750
<i>My good hunters,
welcome to Apex.</i>

241
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:11,461
<i>Allow me to introduce
your toys for the weekend.</i>

242
00:18:11,494 --> 00:18:13,995
<i>Only the best for the best.</i>

243
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:17,467
<i>A weapon for every weapon
in this room.</i>

244
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,671
<i>State of the art, oiled,
and maintained</i>

245
00:18:21,704 --> 00:18:24,072
<i>by our team of armorers</i>

246
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,247
Ha-ha, very funny.

247
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,486
<i>Our à la carte offerings
include thoroughbreds,</i>

248
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,454
<i>mongrels, and dirt bikes.</i>

249
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:40,155
Remove them all.

250
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:41,791
- <i>Sir?</i>
- We don't want the prey

251
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:45,327
stealing another bike,
now do we?

252
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:47,262
Anybody got a problem with that?

253
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:53,803
Good.

254
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:58,407
Babe, time to
show us the turkey.

255
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:04,346
<i>You have the pleasure,
the honor of hunting one</i>

256
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,314
<i>Thomas Malone.</i>

257
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:08,183
Malone the mutilator?

258
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:10,118
Is he a special forces
or something?

259
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:12,655
A name like that
makes me think IRA or SAF.

260
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:13,823
This is going to be good.

261
00:19:13,856 --> 00:19:16,124
Oh, come on now,
show us his mug.

262
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:20,730
Who the hell is that?

263
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:23,331
He'll be dead the second
he slips and breaks his hip.

264
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:26,402
A little long in the back nine,
don't you think?

265
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:29,539
<i>Thomas Malone could be the
greatest prey any of you</i>

266
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:30,673
<i>have faced.</i>

267
00:19:30,706 --> 00:19:33,643
Him. Yeah.

268
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:36,379
<i>Typically the prey
is ex-special forces,</i>

269
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:41,517
<i>a Green Beret, a ranger,
but Malone, he's an ex-cop,</i>

270
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:44,520
<i>kicked off the force
for intemperance.</i>

271
00:19:44,554 --> 00:19:47,122
So he's been moonlighting
as a hit man?

272
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:48,791
What? What's the deal?

273
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:51,293
Yeah, it looks a bit more like
a mercenary, don't you think?

274
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:54,797
<i>No. No, he developed
a crippling gambling addiction</i>

275
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,232
<i>and lost custody
of his children.</i>

276
00:19:57,265 --> 00:19:58,868
All right. Listen.
Do we get a refund

277
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:01,437
if we kill this guy
within an hour?

278
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,772
<i>Certainly.</i>

279
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:05,708
<i>What I've failed
to mention is this.</i>

280
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:10,245
<i>Malone has defied death more
times than most Navy SEALs.</i>

281
00:20:10,278 --> 00:20:14,316
<i>He always happens to be in the
wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

282
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:17,553
Injuries.

283
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:19,655
<i>Broken ribs
and a compressed spine</i>

284
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:23,559
<i>from leaping off a building,
over 60 concussions.</i>

285
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:29,130
<i>Sole survivor of a train crash,
shot in the back at an airport,</i>

286
00:20:29,164 --> 00:20:31,132
<i>drove a car through a plane.</i>

287
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,802
- What?
- <i>But five years ago,</i>

288
00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:36,606
<i>he was convicted of murder
in a burglary gone wrong.</i>

289
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:39,542
<i>I could go on,
but we'd be here all night.</i>

290
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:41,744
<i>The man hasn't lived
an easy life.</i>

291
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:45,414
Okay, yeah, sure,
but my third wife's shih-tzu

292
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:47,783
looks like it has a better
bite than this guy.

293
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:50,686
This feels like elderly abuse.
Am I right?

294
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,690
<i>Pardon my French,
but the man is a motherfucker.</i>

295
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:56,726
<i>He defies every
basic testicle algorithm</i>

296
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,795
<i>used by the Apex
to select its prey.</i>

297
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:05,300
<i>Simply put, the universe
just can't seem to kill him.</i>

298
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,837
<i>Maybe some in this room can.</i>

299
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,941
Well, he hasn't met me yet.

300
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:13,241
To the hunt?

301
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:14,577
Ooh.

302
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,579
To the hunt.

303
00:21:47,843 --> 00:21:49,478
Hmm.

304
00:22:21,477 --> 00:22:23,379
Hmm.

305
00:22:23,412 --> 00:22:25,848
Well, fuck it.

306
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:30,953
Hey, it's my size.

307
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:33,489
At least I'll be comfortable.

308
00:22:42,832 --> 00:22:48,871
Now, judging by the wind speed,
the weather, climate,

309
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:51,040
I wonder if he'll go south.

310
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:52,808
Of course you do.

311
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:55,310
East.

312
00:22:55,343 --> 00:22:57,613
He has to know daylight gives
him better visibility.

313
00:22:57,646 --> 00:22:59,415
Maybe the old man's
got cataracts.

314
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:01,584
Is that even in the file?

315
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,923
Bright red?
Is you senile?

316
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:18,734
Hey, I got a question.

317
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:23,539
<i>You're coming through
loud and clear to all.</i>

318
00:23:23,572 --> 00:23:26,809
Can hunters kill other hunters?

319
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:31,380
<i>Technically, yes.</i>

320
00:23:31,413 --> 00:23:34,884
<i>There are no rules against it.</i>

321
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:36,786
Yeah,
that sounds like fun.

322
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:39,822
You a sadist?

323
00:23:39,855 --> 00:23:42,758
<i>The hunt ends
with the chorus of bells.</i>

324
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:46,362
<i>Trust me, you'll know it
when you hear it.</i>

325
00:23:46,395 --> 00:23:49,398
<i>You will have
a three-hour head start.</i>

326
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:51,433
<i>Good luck, Mr. Malone.</i>

327
00:24:27,536 --> 00:24:29,572
Welcome to Disneyland.

328
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,946
You really think you're going
to need those?

329
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,950
Why don't you mind
your own business?

330
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:17,519
Wow. Really?

331
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:19,588
Can you put your finger
on here for a second for me?

332
00:25:19,622 --> 00:25:20,956
- So funny.
- Just for a second.

333
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,791
- Just put it on for a second.
- So clever.

334
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:25,728
- Just... I'll show you.
- Don't touch me.

335
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:27,963
Ah! It's not ready yet.

336
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,836
The logical move is to work
together as a unit.

337
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:35,604
Let's lure them into a trap.

338
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:37,539
Jeza, Carrion.

339
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:39,108
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

340
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:40,609
No teams.

341
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:42,211
Yeah, how about everyone
for themselves?

342
00:25:42,244 --> 00:25:44,213
None of this team bullshit.

343
00:25:44,246 --> 00:25:47,950
Fine. Let him pick you off
one at a time.

344
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:49,919
Yeah, right.

345
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:48,043
Classic story of
hunter versus prey.

346
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:51,080
And who is that hunter?

347
00:26:51,113 --> 00:26:53,816
Lyle.

348
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:56,919
The efficient.

349
00:26:56,952 --> 00:26:59,722
No, that doesn't work.

350
00:26:59,755 --> 00:27:02,758
How about...

351
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:05,661
Lyle the fearless.

352
00:27:05,694 --> 00:27:08,063
Fuckin' bugs.

353
00:27:09,698 --> 00:27:15,571
He walks stealthily
through the forest,

354
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:18,841
checking the canopy
for something

355
00:27:18,874 --> 00:27:21,710
that might be lurking.

356
00:27:21,744 --> 00:27:23,946
Watch.

357
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:26,015
Moving.

358
00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:38,794
Where are you,
you little bastard?

359
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:53,976
What the fuck?

360
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:08,257
Oh.

361
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,726
Okay, West.

362
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:14,997
That better not leave a bruise,
or I'm suing your ass.

363
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:20,302
Prepare to die, skeleton.

364
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:28,310
Come on.

365
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:32,948
Oh, great. Piece of shit.

366
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:36,285
Okay, West.

367
00:28:36,318 --> 00:28:38,821
West, can I get a depot
out here?

368
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:42,224
Oh.

369
00:28:49,298 --> 00:28:50,666
Ah.

370
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:52,634
Invisible Depot now, huh?

371
00:28:52,668 --> 00:28:55,003
Yeah, safety issue.

372
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:59,775
That is going in my
3-star Yelp review.

373
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:14,857
Hey, West, does your
holographic ass

374
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,059
have anything other than water?

375
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:35,043
Oh.

376
00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:38,814
Now, that is
the taste of Mexico.

377
00:29:38,847 --> 00:29:41,984
Gracias!

378
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:46,155
Only the best
for an apex predator!

379
00:29:46,188 --> 00:29:50,692
I am king of the jungle
because I am afraid of sh...

380
00:29:52,227 --> 00:29:55,431
Oh, holy crap, Rainy.

381
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:59,034
Pretty light in
the loafers, huh?

382
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:00,370
What a hit?

383
00:30:00,403 --> 00:30:02,204
Why are you here?

384
00:30:02,237 --> 00:30:05,107
I, uh... I tracked him.

385
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,308
I think I think I saw him
coming this way.

386
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:08,844
No, I mean, on the island.

387
00:30:08,877 --> 00:30:11,146
Same as you.

388
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,017
No. No, not actually.

389
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:18,220
Here to hunt the prey,
you know, better myself.

390
00:30:18,253 --> 00:30:22,758
Plus I read in Forbes that
all the top CEOs do this shit.

391
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:24,993
So why are you here?

392
00:30:26,995 --> 00:30:29,831
Because
I want to be, okay?

393
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:31,401
What about you?

394
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:34,870
I'm here because I know
I can walk through

395
00:30:34,903 --> 00:30:37,172
the shadow of shadowed valley
of death and fear no evil

396
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:39,741
because I'm with me.

397
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:41,176
And through the trial
and tribulation,

398
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,212
I know I'll grow stronger.

399
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:45,781
You really...

400
00:30:45,814 --> 00:30:47,282
Excuse me?

401
00:30:47,316 --> 00:30:50,520
No, it's not complicated
on why you're here, bro.

402
00:30:50,553 --> 00:30:53,222
All right? You're a sick fuck.

403
00:30:53,255 --> 00:30:54,890
I'd stop talking if I were you.

404
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:58,026
Just embrace it, amigo.

405
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,429
No more words, Lyle.

406
00:30:59,462 --> 00:31:02,197
See, I'm here because
I'm a fucking warrior

407
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:05,167
and I was born to do this shit.

408
00:31:07,336 --> 00:31:10,038
I would bet my entire empire
on the fact

409
00:31:10,072 --> 00:31:12,040
that you wouldn't
pull the trigger on the prey

410
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:13,775
if you had the chance.

411
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:17,312
Yeah, whatever.

412
00:31:17,346 --> 00:31:18,414
Excuse me?

413
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:20,882
Nothing.

414
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:24,219
No, feel free to speak, Lyle.

415
00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:27,789
Okay, well, I say this with all
due respect and deference,

416
00:31:27,823 --> 00:31:32,060
but you are fucked in the head.

417
00:31:32,094 --> 00:31:33,829
We all know what you did.
So you...

418
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:37,866
You're not some... some paragon
of fuckin' excellence.

419
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:39,234
You killed your wife, bro.

420
00:31:39,268 --> 00:31:41,036
So you can save me
the sanctimonious

421
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:43,406
"Oh, I'm here to better
myself" bullshit.

422
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:47,009
And you can put that down.

423
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:52,114
Man, if this was the real world
and you and I got in the scrap,

424
00:31:52,147 --> 00:31:54,417
I'd tear your fucking
head off, bro.

425
00:31:56,386 --> 00:31:59,154
It's a good thing
we're not in the real world.

426
00:32:02,392 --> 00:32:04,826
Ah!

427
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,963
Fuck are you doing?

428
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:09,499
That?

429
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:11,900
Aah! Okay.

430
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:16,104
Hey, hey, hey, listen,
you win, okay?

431
00:32:16,138 --> 00:32:17,440
You win.

432
00:32:17,473 --> 00:32:20,476
Alright? You win.

433
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,545
I do win.

434
00:32:23,312 --> 00:32:25,515
That's all I do.

435
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,021
Hello, hello, Dr. King of Kings.

436
00:33:06,054 --> 00:33:08,491
He was like this
when I got here.

437
00:33:08,524 --> 00:33:12,094
I told you we should've
hunted together.

438
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:14,129
He certainly
didn't last long.

439
00:33:14,963 --> 00:33:16,599
Well, Lyle had it coming.

440
00:33:16,632 --> 00:33:19,669
Huh? Survival of the fittest.

441
00:33:19,702 --> 00:33:21,504
Is this your doing?

442
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:26,476
It is, isn't it,
you cheeky fuck.

443
00:33:27,577 --> 00:33:30,580
Have the rules changed?

444
00:33:30,613 --> 00:33:33,014
Who's the prey now?

445
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:39,087
When we get back to
the real world,

446
00:33:39,121 --> 00:33:41,524
I'm gonna ask you
to do me a favor,

447
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:44,560
and you're going
to do what I ask.

448
00:33:44,594 --> 00:33:47,463
Why would I ever say yes?

449
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:52,702
There's a difference between
what's right and what's legal.

450
00:33:52,735 --> 00:33:56,238
You don't want a guy like me
going around telling stories

451
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:58,340
about what you did.

452
00:33:58,374 --> 00:34:02,310
But don't worry,
I can keep a secret.

453
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:04,112
What secret?

454
00:34:04,146 --> 00:34:06,248
Well, that I was created
in God's image,

455
00:34:06,281 --> 00:34:08,451
the pinnacle of perfection.

456
00:34:08,484 --> 00:34:12,087
If God was a deaf, dumb,
blind, racist,

457
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,425
misogynistic, walking
case of Dutch, then sure.

458
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:18,494
You need to read
the Old Testament.

459
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:22,230
Zephaniah 3:8
is all that and more.

460
00:34:22,264 --> 00:34:24,467
- Hmm.
- That savage.

461
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,202
The prey must have store
his gun, right?

462
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:28,970
Should we worry
about this old man?

463
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:30,205
-Nah, he just got cocky.

464
00:34:30,238 --> 00:34:33,175
Turned his back at
the wrong moment.

465
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:38,013
Where'd you get that?
At the depot?

466
00:34:40,215 --> 00:34:42,083
Okay, just leave me alone.

467
00:34:42,117 --> 00:34:43,486
I don't want to help you
do that.

468
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,187
What did you just say?

469
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,457
Fight.

470
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,324
- Fuck off already.
- Fight.

471
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:50,493
You know, any time,
any place, pal.

472
00:34:50,526 --> 00:34:51,761
- Yeah, right now, huh?
- Fight.

473
00:34:51,794 --> 00:34:53,261
What are you at?

474
00:34:53,295 --> 00:34:54,630
Come on.

475
00:34:54,664 --> 00:34:56,198
- Shh, shh.
- Hey.

476
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:57,567
Prey's trying to get
in our head, man.

477
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,034
Look what he did to Lyle.

478
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,537
- Fuck, let's go.
- Quiet.

479
00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:11,213
Is there
something out there?

480
00:35:11,246 --> 00:35:13,749
Let's find out.

481
00:35:46,382 --> 00:35:48,216
All right. Here's what I think
we should do.

482
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,719
Shut up.

483
00:35:49,752 --> 00:35:52,320
We're going to go northeast.
Everyone start a grid.

484
00:35:52,355 --> 00:35:54,189
Don't let him get past you.

485
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:56,258
I'm going to go south
and force him out.

486
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,461
Oh, so you
can corner him? Piss off.

487
00:35:58,494 --> 00:36:01,263
Yeah, all for none
and none for all, right?

488
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:03,499
That's it.
I'll have his head by sunset.

489
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,501
Yeah, you ought
to take a wager on that.

490
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:08,471
Your head for his if you don't.

491
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:10,138
This is not the best
course of attack.

492
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:12,542
We should be
coordinating our efforts.

493
00:36:14,377 --> 00:36:17,613
Why don't you just let them
chase the little bastard?

494
00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:20,750
And then you might get a chance
to kill another one of us.

495
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:23,653
When we get back to lodge,
why don't you and I

496
00:36:23,686 --> 00:36:27,289
pour one out for Lyle?

497
00:36:27,322 --> 00:36:29,425
He did kind of deserve it.

498
00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:42,632
Fuckin' hell, man.

499
00:37:44,934 --> 00:37:46,836
You see what he did to Lyle?

500
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:48,638
- What, are you scared?
- What?

501
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:49,905
You want take a timeout?

502
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:52,475
Fuck that, man.
Lyle was one of us.

503
00:37:52,508 --> 00:37:54,443
This is going
in my trophy room, alright?

504
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:56,445
Come over here. He's here.

505
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:58,814
He left a trail even your
dumb ass can find.

506
00:37:58,848 --> 00:38:00,816
Uh, did you ever consider that

507
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,451
maybe you're walking
into a trap?

508
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:05,220
Well, you're here, too.
So what does that say?

509
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:07,690
Maybe I'm here
to look out for you.

510
00:38:07,723 --> 00:38:10,291
Fuckin' liar, men.

511
00:38:10,325 --> 00:38:15,564
You know, you killing the prey,

512
00:38:15,598 --> 00:38:17,466
it's not going to earn
the love of your father.

513
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,370
Don't start.
Don't start with that shit.

514
00:38:21,404 --> 00:38:25,306
You need a lot thicker skin
to survive in this world, son.

515
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,476
I'm dangerous, man.
I'm fucked in the head.

516
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,578
Broken beyond repair.

517
00:38:29,612 --> 00:38:31,580
According to psych
on the East Coast.

518
00:38:31,614 --> 00:38:34,650
Sure you are, boy. Sure you are.

519
00:38:34,684 --> 00:38:38,286
You think you're better than me?

520
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:40,723
Well, I know I am.

521
00:38:40,756 --> 00:38:44,760
I'm stronger, better looking.

522
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:49,365
I'm richer.

523
00:38:49,398 --> 00:38:50,700
For now.

524
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:53,234
I live for the day you go broke,
and it's coming.

525
00:38:56,706 --> 00:38:58,841
You live for the that
your daddy says

526
00:38:58,874 --> 00:39:00,843
he's proud of you.

527
00:39:00,876 --> 00:39:04,747
Guess what. That's not
going to happen any time soon.

528
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,882
I'll tell you what.

529
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:10,753
You can call me daddy
if you want to.

530
00:40:16,952 --> 00:40:19,455
Oh, fuck.

531
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:31,567
Christ, man, get up.

532
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,968
Use your strength.

533
00:40:44,647 --> 00:40:47,817
Well, you cocked that one up.

534
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,119
Oh, fuck.

535
00:40:50,152 --> 00:40:52,655
Use me as a human shield.

536
00:40:52,688 --> 00:40:55,424
Thank you for that.

537
00:40:55,457 --> 00:40:58,360
It wasn't like that, man.

538
00:40:58,394 --> 00:41:00,863
Just come down here
and help me up, man.

539
00:41:03,766 --> 00:41:05,668
Beg me.

540
00:41:05,701 --> 00:41:07,837
That's it. I'm done.

541
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,705
I'm done with this
fucking game, man.

542
00:41:09,738 --> 00:41:13,976
Just get me out of here and get
me back to the lodge, man.

543
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:17,513
You should crawl back.
It's a confidence builder.

544
00:41:17,546 --> 00:41:19,114
You know?

545
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:22,985
Didn't you learn about fortitude
and perseverance in rehab?

546
00:41:23,018 --> 00:41:27,089
Or I could just save you
the pain, end it for you.

547
00:41:28,624 --> 00:41:32,127
Fuck... fuck off and die, man.

548
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:34,530
Be easier for everyone.

549
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:39,468
Ah! Fuck!

550
00:41:41,003 --> 00:41:43,606
No, no, no. I'm not the prey.
You can't kill me.

551
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,608
Are you telling me
what to do now?

552
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:47,409
That's so pathetic.

553
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:51,780
You've always been
my little brother!

554
00:41:51,814 --> 00:41:54,149
What are you're
doing this to me?!

555
00:41:54,183 --> 00:41:55,784
I was there for you.

556
00:41:55,818 --> 00:41:59,588
You always, always did things.

557
00:41:59,622 --> 00:42:02,124
Driving crazy, right?

558
00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:05,427
I can't stand you.
I can't stand you.

559
00:42:05,461 --> 00:42:06,695
I tried to help you,
I tried to help you.

560
00:42:06,729 --> 00:42:15,638
I tried to save you.
I... I couldn't.

561
00:42:16,772 --> 00:42:18,574
What?!

562
00:42:18,607 --> 00:42:20,809
What?! What?

563
00:42:20,843 --> 00:42:22,645
Cutting them off?

564
00:42:29,652 --> 00:42:32,221
Why'd you let me do that?

565
00:43:47,262 --> 00:43:48,931
Watch it.

566
00:43:48,964 --> 00:43:51,233
You almost took off
my fucking head.

567
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:55,170
Is that your blood?

568
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,540
Ecka.

569
00:43:58,574 --> 00:44:01,543
The prey threw him
off the cliff.

570
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:05,814
Yeah, I tried to save him.

571
00:44:05,848 --> 00:44:09,718
But he almost vivisected
the poor sod.

572
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:11,987
Where's the body?

573
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:13,622
Why?

574
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:15,824
His father will pay for it.

575
00:44:15,858 --> 00:44:17,760
Give him a proper funeral.

576
00:44:17,793 --> 00:44:19,628
That's why.

577
00:44:19,661 --> 00:44:21,930
Hm.

578
00:44:21,964 --> 00:44:23,332
Well, it'd have to be
a closed casket,

579
00:44:23,366 --> 00:44:26,802
that's for sure.

580
00:44:26,835 --> 00:44:29,571
Slashed him to ribbons,
the prey did.

581
00:45:04,106 --> 00:45:06,942
I do win.

582
00:45:06,975 --> 00:45:08,777
That's all I do.

583
00:45:48,217 --> 00:45:50,986
A little early for
a celebration, isn't it?

584
00:45:55,425 --> 00:45:58,861
I tracked the prey to the
northeast corner of the island.

585
00:45:58,894 --> 00:46:02,097
He's savvy,
knows how to throw his scent.

586
00:46:02,131 --> 00:46:03,866
Whatever.

587
00:46:03,899 --> 00:46:07,136
We'll make him bleed for
what he did to Lyle.

588
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:12,107
A man like that never
should have come

589
00:46:12,141 --> 00:46:14,209
to a place like this.

590
00:46:15,144 --> 00:46:16,812
Oh?

591
00:46:16,845 --> 00:46:18,847
Poor Lyle.

592
00:46:23,952 --> 00:46:26,788
Your wife was
a really lucky woman.

593
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:30,058
Yes, she was.

594
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:44,374
Someone's going to have
to tell his family.

595
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:46,742
The prey did this?

596
00:46:46,775 --> 00:46:48,378
Bishop.

597
00:46:50,112 --> 00:46:51,813
Why?

598
00:46:51,847 --> 00:46:54,716
For fun.

599
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,453
Bishop doesn't
leave the island.

600
00:47:50,172 --> 00:47:52,207
Huh.

601
00:48:20,102 --> 00:48:22,271
This place ain't so bad.

602
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:44,594
Whoa.

603
00:48:55,103 --> 00:48:57,839
To fuck shit up...

604
00:48:57,873 --> 00:48:59,875
or not.

605
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:51,293
Mm.

606
00:49:51,326 --> 00:49:53,161
Hmm.

607
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,932
Oh, yeah.

608
00:49:56,965 --> 00:49:59,435
This is the good stuff.

609
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:01,970
<i>I wouldn't do that
if I were you.</i>

610
00:50:02,003 --> 00:50:04,172
<i>I would go easy on the berries.</i>

611
00:50:04,206 --> 00:50:06,241
<i>The fruit here bites back.</i>

612
00:50:06,274 --> 00:50:09,579
<i>This island was deemed
uninhabitable after the war.</i>

613
00:50:09,612 --> 00:50:13,315
<i>I picked it up for the cost of
a pair of red bottomed heels.</i>

614
00:50:13,348 --> 00:50:16,218
- For real?
- <i>For real.</i>

615
00:50:16,251 --> 00:50:19,121
<i>The constant bombardment
of tachyon radiation</i>

616
00:50:19,154 --> 00:50:21,424
<i>has mutated the berries,
imbued them</i>

617
00:50:21,457 --> 00:50:24,660
<i>with a concentrated
culture of viridis,</i>

618
00:50:24,694 --> 00:50:26,328
<i>a highly potent hallucinogenic</i>

619
00:50:26,362 --> 00:50:29,532
<i>also known
as psilocybin ayahuasca.</i>

620
00:50:29,565 --> 00:50:33,268
<i>You're about a trip
some serious balls.</i>

621
00:50:33,301 --> 00:50:35,538
It doesn't bother me.

622
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:38,608
<i>Can't wait until they kick in.</i>

623
00:50:38,641 --> 00:50:40,576
Are we in open waters?

624
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:44,312
<i>North of Japan, west of Hawaii.</i>

625
00:50:44,346 --> 00:50:46,248
<i>Six more hours to go, friend.</i>

626
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:49,685
<i>Just make it until sunset,
and you're in the clear.</i>

627
00:50:51,687 --> 00:50:53,723
<i>I thought it's fair to tell
you that Mr. Bishop</i>

628
00:50:53,756 --> 00:50:57,225
<i>has been declared prey
by the remaining hunters.</i>

629
00:50:57,259 --> 00:50:59,595
<i>Perhaps you want to team up
with him.</i>

630
00:50:59,629 --> 00:51:03,265
Yeah.
That won't be happening.

631
00:51:03,298 --> 00:51:06,436
<i>Some hunters do like
a fair fight.</i>

632
00:51:08,404 --> 00:51:11,474
I don't think you really know
what that means.

633
00:51:11,507 --> 00:51:14,510
<i>They don't play by the rules
in the real world.</i>

634
00:51:14,544 --> 00:51:16,712
<i>So why would it be
any different here?</i>

635
00:51:18,748 --> 00:51:23,453
Why don't you ask them
to face me one on one?

636
00:51:23,486 --> 00:51:25,388
No guns, no tricks.

637
00:51:25,421 --> 00:51:30,393
<i>That would be like asking
a jackal to stop eating meat.</i>

638
00:51:30,426 --> 00:51:33,496
<i>Did you like a gift
this morning?</i>

639
00:51:33,529 --> 00:51:37,265
<i>I'd like my lighter back,
please.</i>

640
00:51:37,299 --> 00:51:39,502
Well, why don't you
come and get it?

641
00:51:41,303 --> 00:51:46,375
<i>Six hours, Mr. Malone,
and then your free.</i>

642
00:52:06,529 --> 00:52:08,296
Shit.

643
00:52:15,438 --> 00:52:18,641
If order 90 million...

644
00:52:18,674 --> 00:52:20,175
No.

645
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:24,179
129 million in
Lyle MFG mediation stock.

646
00:52:24,212 --> 00:52:26,281
Confirm order.

647
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,351
Thank you, Lyle.

648
00:52:29,385 --> 00:52:31,119
Once word gets out
that you're dead,

649
00:52:31,152 --> 00:52:33,523
share price in your company
will skyrocket.

650
00:52:33,556 --> 00:52:36,626
You're going to make me a
billionaire by the time I'm 25.

651
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:39,094
Fuck, I love this game.

652
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:48,103
Fuck.

653
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:50,338
West?

654
00:52:50,373 --> 00:52:52,107
West?

655
00:52:54,209 --> 00:52:57,480
Hello, there.

656
00:52:57,513 --> 00:53:00,181
Didn't anyone ever tell you

657
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:03,519
you never smoke in the field.

658
00:53:03,553 --> 00:53:07,122
That's
so perfect there.

659
00:53:09,492 --> 00:53:12,361
Deactivate the mine.
Now, Bishop.

660
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:14,764
You know, if you weren't
so caught up on

661
00:53:14,797 --> 00:53:17,567
trying to make money off
Lyle's spilt blood,

662
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,268
you never would have been
standing there.

663
00:53:20,302 --> 00:53:22,237
A girl's got to eat.

664
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,109
I wonder what the hell
you're even doing here?

665
00:53:28,143 --> 00:53:31,112
Why'd you come to Apex?

666
00:53:31,146 --> 00:53:34,884
You're hunting
hunters' pocketbooks.

667
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:38,219
Little inside trading. Hm.

668
00:53:38,253 --> 00:53:42,391
Like I said...

669
00:53:42,425 --> 00:53:44,694
A girl's got to eat.

670
00:53:46,696 --> 00:53:49,599
Okay, just relax,
put the gun down, please.

671
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,835
You know I'm a friendly.

672
00:53:52,868 --> 00:53:54,503
Take one more fucking step,

673
00:53:54,537 --> 00:53:56,405
and you won't be getting
friendly with anyone again.

674
00:53:56,439 --> 00:53:58,908
There's no need to be mean.

675
00:53:58,941 --> 00:54:01,544
It's just you and I, Jeza.

676
00:54:01,577 --> 00:54:04,145
Nobody else.

677
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:06,882
Carrion? Rainsford?

678
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,684
Malone?

679
00:54:11,621 --> 00:54:13,556
Easy pickings.

680
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:15,524
You sure about that?

681
00:54:15,558 --> 00:54:18,728
I haven't been so certain
in my entire life.

682
00:54:18,761 --> 00:54:21,497
Well, we won't have to wait long
to find out.

683
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:22,732
You're fair game now.

684
00:54:22,765 --> 00:54:23,799
Oh?

685
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,368
Rainsford could take you.

686
00:54:25,401 --> 00:54:27,436
I'd pick him as my favorite.

687
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,704
Hm.

688
00:54:28,738 --> 00:54:30,473
You know what?

689
00:54:30,506 --> 00:54:32,842
You and I, we should team up.

690
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:35,544
We could take over the place.

691
00:54:35,578 --> 00:54:39,482
You, me, we could become
the next Rainsford.

692
00:54:39,515 --> 00:54:41,717
It'd be easy.

693
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:43,686
We'd be like little birds.

694
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:44,854
What the fuck are you doing?

695
00:54:44,887 --> 00:54:46,522
Just relax.

696
00:54:46,555 --> 00:54:48,189
What the fuck
are you doing?

697
00:54:48,223 --> 00:54:49,558
Just relax.

698
00:54:49,592 --> 00:54:50,693
Is this
some kind of seizure?

699
00:54:50,726 --> 00:54:53,462
What the fuck is this, Bishop?!

700
00:54:53,496 --> 00:54:55,731
You dance with the devil,
you best make sure that

701
00:54:55,765 --> 00:54:58,567
you put on your Sunday shoes.

702
00:54:58,601 --> 00:55:00,970
'Cause if you miss
that even once,

703
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:03,506
well, I tell you,

704
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:04,840
he'll own you forever.

705
00:55:10,245 --> 00:55:11,681
Now, that wasn't very nice!

706
00:55:11,714 --> 00:55:14,717
Deactivate this
fucking thing, Bishop.

707
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,586
Only way that that fucking thing
will be deactivated

708
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,422
is if I do it.

709
00:55:23,793 --> 00:55:25,728
Fine.

710
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:28,397
Let's come to an understanding.

711
00:55:28,431 --> 00:55:30,231
Like a deal?

712
00:55:30,265 --> 00:55:32,702
A bargain.

713
00:55:33,936 --> 00:55:35,838
Alright.

714
00:55:39,008 --> 00:55:41,242
You can trust me.

715
00:55:42,044 --> 00:55:44,914
Yeah?

716
00:55:44,947 --> 00:55:46,749
It's okay.

717
00:55:46,782 --> 00:55:48,918
Total control.

718
00:55:49,418 --> 00:55:50,720
You can have all of it.

719
00:55:51,787 --> 00:55:52,922
Oh, you fuckin' b...

720
00:55:52,955 --> 00:55:54,790
Hm.

721
00:55:54,824 --> 00:55:57,460
Yikes, old man.

722
00:55:57,493 --> 00:56:01,964
I don't think that's how
you start today going, huh?

723
00:56:01,997 --> 00:56:04,767
Well...

724
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,503
We may as well
get it over us. Hm?

725
00:56:09,538 --> 00:56:11,607
Let's get this show on the road.

726
00:56:16,412 --> 00:56:18,013
Beg me.

727
00:56:23,686 --> 00:56:25,354
Shoot me!

728
00:56:27,022 --> 00:56:28,958
You're not scared?

729
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:32,428
It's impossible to be scared
when you're already dead.

730
00:56:32,461 --> 00:56:33,796
If only.

731
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:36,065
I'm the youngest
out of six boys.

732
00:56:36,098 --> 00:56:38,768
Every one of my brothers,
they...

733
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:42,905
they all just wanted to chase
more, chase more money,

734
00:56:42,938 --> 00:56:45,908
more, more, more,
more, more, more, more.

735
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:49,545
Every single one of them died
of a heart attack.

736
00:56:49,578 --> 00:56:52,381
Jeza, you can't take
any money with you.

737
00:56:52,414 --> 00:56:56,919
So they're dead. I'm not.
I'm standing right here.

738
00:56:56,952 --> 00:57:00,923
And I'm going to live like
I'm already dead.

739
00:57:02,758 --> 00:57:04,894
Actually not a bad line.
I might steal that.

740
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:07,396
It's the truth.

741
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:09,732
Hmm? We're all dead.

742
00:57:11,634 --> 00:57:13,869
Even the lucky.

743
00:57:13,903 --> 00:57:15,504
Even the beautiful.

744
00:57:15,538 --> 00:57:16,539
Shakespeare?

745
00:57:16,572 --> 00:57:20,341
Mm. That was me.

746
00:57:22,845 --> 00:57:26,882
Okay, dead man, when we get back
to the real world,

747
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:29,652
you're signing over your share
of your family's estate to me

748
00:57:29,685 --> 00:57:31,854
to manage.

749
00:57:31,887 --> 00:57:33,823
Whatever makes you happy.

750
00:57:33,856 --> 00:57:36,358
Deal?

751
00:57:36,392 --> 00:57:39,595
- It's a bargain.
- Hmm.

752
00:57:40,696 --> 00:57:42,464
Good boy.

753
00:57:42,498 --> 00:57:44,500
Now stay.

754
00:57:46,902 --> 00:57:48,938
Psychotic bastard.

755
00:57:48,971 --> 00:57:50,873
Oh, come on!

756
00:57:50,906 --> 00:57:52,575
What the fuck is that, Bishop?!

757
00:57:52,608 --> 00:57:54,643
Quit fucking around!

758
00:57:54,677 --> 00:57:57,746
Looks like a couple
more detonators, don't it?

759
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,948
I... okay, okay, okay.

760
00:57:58,981 --> 00:58:00,783
Let me get my head...

761
00:58:00,816 --> 00:58:02,651
I need to get this clear.

762
00:58:02,685 --> 00:58:05,154
I put two land mines down.

763
00:58:05,187 --> 00:58:06,622
And I got two detonators

764
00:58:06,655 --> 00:58:10,392
So if I... we got
a 50/50 chance.

765
00:58:10,426 --> 00:58:11,894
If I hit one of
these detonators,

766
00:58:11,927 --> 00:58:13,996
one of us is going to go boom.

767
00:58:14,029 --> 00:58:16,632
Uh... so, yeah.

768
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:17,800
No, you wouldn't do it, Bishop.

769
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:20,502
Ah, yeah. Mm.

770
00:58:20,536 --> 00:58:22,972
What do you think hell's
service for dinner tonight?

771
00:58:23,005 --> 00:58:25,941
'Cause I would love
a little side of Jeza!

772
00:58:25,975 --> 00:58:27,843
Bishop, you are not
that psychotic.

773
00:58:27,877 --> 00:58:29,111
Okay? Don't do this.

774
00:58:29,144 --> 00:58:30,813
I what to do it!

775
00:58:30,846 --> 00:58:32,448
This is not the game anymore.
Okay?

776
00:58:32,481 --> 00:58:33,916
We're meant to be hunting
Malone, not each other.

777
00:58:33,949 --> 00:58:34,984
Please, for
the love of God, don't.

778
00:58:35,017 --> 00:58:36,552
- Are you sure?
- Bishop.

779
00:58:36,585 --> 00:58:38,420
Are you sure?
Because let's just find out.

780
00:58:38,454 --> 00:58:39,755
Don't do it.

781
00:58:39,788 --> 00:58:41,190
- Why don't we just find out?!
- Don't...

782
00:58:41,223 --> 00:58:43,759
Say hello to my bloodline
for me!

783
00:58:43,792 --> 00:58:45,561
Fucking c...

784
00:58:50,633 --> 00:58:52,701
Fuck this.

785
00:59:08,217 --> 00:59:10,920
Where'd she go?

786
00:59:13,622 --> 00:59:15,958
Jeza?

787
00:59:16,191 --> 00:59:17,860
Jeza?

788
00:59:20,763 --> 00:59:22,898
Huh.

789
00:59:40,215 --> 00:59:42,551
Empty.

790
00:59:42,584 --> 00:59:44,086
Fuck.

791
01:00:03,572 --> 01:00:06,809
West, give me a depot.

792
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,515
Give me a fucking depot!

793
01:00:46,148 --> 01:00:48,817
What the...

794
01:01:42,204 --> 01:01:43,739
Come on.

795
01:01:43,772 --> 01:01:46,041
I'm a little disappointed.

796
01:01:46,075 --> 01:01:49,144
West said that you're special,
but this was far too easy.

797
01:01:49,178 --> 01:01:50,979
You're running around the forest

798
01:01:51,013 --> 01:01:53,315
with an empty gun,
you old fuck.

799
01:01:53,348 --> 01:01:56,185
I bet you put all the bullets
in my back,

800
01:01:56,218 --> 01:01:58,821
you fucking
cock sucking bastard.

801
01:01:58,854 --> 01:02:00,956
I saw it in a movie once.

802
01:02:00,989 --> 01:02:02,858
Yeah, seems like you've been
around the block

803
01:02:02,891 --> 01:02:04,360
a few too many times.

804
01:02:04,394 --> 01:02:09,031
Motherfucker, I made the block.

805
01:02:09,064 --> 01:02:10,899
Yeah, step out.

806
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:13,335
Come on. Come on.

807
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:15,704
I don't want to be chasing
you around the forest.

808
01:02:15,737 --> 01:02:17,673
Couldn't be bothered.

809
01:02:17,706 --> 01:02:20,275
You didn't have to kill the kid.

810
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:23,345
Maybe, maybe not.

811
01:02:23,379 --> 01:02:25,981
How do you like being hunted?

812
01:02:26,014 --> 01:02:29,318
It's all about perspective. Hm?

813
01:02:30,018 --> 01:02:32,721
I'm as dangerous now
as I've ever been.

814
01:02:32,754 --> 01:02:34,923
And maybe an alliance.

815
01:02:34,957 --> 01:02:38,193
We could be even more
dangerous together than ever.

816
01:02:38,227 --> 01:02:39,328
Even the odds.

817
01:02:40,963 --> 01:02:43,098
I always bet on myself.

818
01:02:43,132 --> 01:02:46,301
That's the kind of bullshit
that the Rainmaker would say.

819
01:02:46,335 --> 01:02:50,139
That's the guy
that killed the blonde?

820
01:02:50,172 --> 01:02:52,207
You sly fuck.

821
01:02:52,241 --> 01:02:54,977
You were hiding
in the bushes, weren't you?

822
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:57,880
He doesn't look like
he's all that.

823
01:02:57,913 --> 01:03:00,949
Don't underestimate Rainsford.

824
01:03:00,983 --> 01:03:04,353
We want big game
hunting in Africa

825
01:03:04,387 --> 01:03:08,190
with nothing but steel machetes
and our gold balls.

826
01:03:08,223 --> 01:03:11,160
And we killed a dozen rhinos,

827
01:03:11,193 --> 01:03:14,129
and I'm not ashamed to say
that he got most of them.

828
01:03:14,163 --> 01:03:15,365
Hm?

829
01:03:15,398 --> 01:03:17,866
And what makes you think

830
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,403
that you could take out a man
who kills just as easily

831
01:03:20,436 --> 01:03:22,372
as he breathes?

832
01:03:22,405 --> 01:03:25,107
Yeah.

833
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,976
He sounds like
he's a force of nature.

834
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:30,145
I don't know if I can beat him.

835
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:33,849
And I wouldn't want him to know

836
01:03:33,882 --> 01:03:36,051
that I know his secrets.

837
01:03:36,084 --> 01:03:38,854
Now, what about you?

838
01:03:38,887 --> 01:03:41,391
You think you could take him?

839
01:03:41,424 --> 01:03:44,893
Kill me...

840
01:03:44,927 --> 01:03:46,762
that's game over.

841
01:03:46,795 --> 01:03:49,298
He goes back to his ivory tower,

842
01:03:49,331 --> 01:03:53,268
and you go back to that cave
that you crawled out of.

843
01:03:53,302 --> 01:03:58,941
But if it was me
and I thought I could beat him,

844
01:03:58,974 --> 01:04:01,176
I'd take my shot.

845
01:04:11,954 --> 01:04:13,523
About to go find out.

846
01:04:13,556 --> 01:04:16,792
Yeah, you go do that.

847
01:04:19,294 --> 01:04:23,966
You change your mind,
you know where to find me.

848
01:05:10,979 --> 01:05:12,548
Choose wisely.

849
01:05:20,322 --> 01:05:22,924
Well, look at you.

850
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:27,262
Sitting here at dark
all by yourself.

851
01:05:27,296 --> 01:05:30,332
Sippin' tea,
tinkering with his toys.

852
01:05:30,366 --> 01:05:32,134
You know, I'm really not
interested in learning

853
01:05:32,167 --> 01:05:34,269
if you can talk me to death.

854
01:05:36,038 --> 01:05:38,441
Well, before this gets
all primeval....

855
01:05:40,175 --> 01:05:41,977
...I propose a parlay.

856
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:43,979
Huh.

857
01:05:44,012 --> 01:05:45,981
All right.

858
01:05:46,014 --> 01:05:49,017
First, Ecka.

859
01:05:49,051 --> 01:05:50,085
Why?

860
01:05:50,118 --> 01:05:53,255
Lyle, why?

861
01:05:53,288 --> 01:05:54,490
Because I wanted to.

862
01:05:55,558 --> 01:05:58,126
Same.

863
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,630
No, no.

864
01:06:00,663 --> 01:06:03,031
No, I want it to.

865
01:06:03,065 --> 01:06:05,167
You had to.

866
01:06:09,171 --> 01:06:10,272
You ready?

867
01:06:10,305 --> 01:06:12,408
For a spot of dinner? Sure.

868
01:06:12,442 --> 01:06:14,109
What are you thinking?

869
01:06:14,142 --> 01:06:16,446
You're on the menu tonight,
old sport.

870
01:06:16,479 --> 01:06:19,615
Hm.

871
01:06:19,649 --> 01:06:22,351
Well, what am I going to do?

872
01:06:23,919 --> 01:06:25,655
Well, first, I think you'd
reach for that hunting knife

873
01:06:25,688 --> 01:06:27,390
that you just took over there.

874
01:06:27,423 --> 01:06:29,925
Maybe you can close the distance
before I get a shot off

875
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:31,361
with this rifle.

876
01:06:31,394 --> 01:06:32,462
You'll miss.

877
01:06:32,495 --> 01:06:34,430
I never do.

878
01:06:34,464 --> 01:06:36,532
Not from this range.

879
01:06:36,566 --> 01:06:38,333
But now that I've said that,
maybe you'll reach

880
01:06:38,368 --> 01:06:39,935
for that pistol because
you know that West always

881
01:06:39,968 --> 01:06:41,404
keeps them loaded.

882
01:06:41,437 --> 01:06:42,938
You're a good aim.

883
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:44,407
Maybe you'll get a shot off
before I do.

884
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,174
Maybe.

885
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:48,243
I'm just extrapolating
potential outcomes

886
01:06:48,276 --> 01:06:50,178
based on what I know about you.

887
01:06:50,212 --> 01:06:52,214
Well, then you should know
that consequentialism

888
01:06:52,247 --> 01:06:54,216
isn't my style.

889
01:06:54,249 --> 01:06:56,084
Huh.

890
01:06:56,118 --> 01:07:01,323
You see, you fancy yourself
some kind of agent of chaos.

891
01:07:01,357 --> 01:07:02,924
I find you're
rather predictable.

892
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:06,596
Says the most vanilla man
in the world.

893
01:07:06,629 --> 01:07:08,631
Maybe.

894
01:07:10,733 --> 01:07:13,001
You know,

895
01:07:13,034 --> 01:07:15,705
maybe I won't even use my rifle.

896
01:07:15,738 --> 01:07:17,707
It's too easy.

897
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,242
You're a strange bird, Rainy.

898
01:07:20,275 --> 01:07:22,344
You remember
that bullshit fundraiser

899
01:07:22,378 --> 01:07:24,414
that we did a while back?

900
01:07:24,447 --> 01:07:25,981
I remember your wife.

901
01:07:26,014 --> 01:07:27,617
She took me out back.

902
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:31,421
When I was doing up
my zipper, she...

903
01:07:31,454 --> 01:07:33,255
she warned me.

904
01:07:33,288 --> 01:07:36,692
She warned me about you.

905
01:07:36,726 --> 01:07:38,326
She said she was scared of you,

906
01:07:38,361 --> 01:07:42,432
said she was scared
of what you're capable of.

907
01:07:42,465 --> 01:07:46,569
She had every right to be scared
of you, didn't she?

908
01:07:49,137 --> 01:07:50,640
I do regret
what happened to her.

909
01:07:50,673 --> 01:07:52,642
Oh, yeah,
because you lost your temper.

910
01:07:52,675 --> 01:07:54,744
Or it was an accident?

911
01:07:54,777 --> 01:07:56,278
No.

912
01:07:56,311 --> 01:07:59,247
No, I just want to see
if I had it in me.

913
01:08:09,024 --> 01:08:11,026
You called for backup?

914
01:08:13,128 --> 01:08:15,498
Hello, Carrion.

915
01:08:15,531 --> 01:08:18,233
Are you ready to have
a little bit of fun?

916
01:08:18,266 --> 01:08:20,202
Hm?

917
01:08:20,235 --> 01:08:22,638
One versus two?

918
01:08:22,672 --> 01:08:24,607
All right.

919
01:08:26,308 --> 01:08:28,411
I love a good threesome.

920
01:08:30,045 --> 01:08:31,481
Blades and fists only.

921
01:08:31,514 --> 01:08:33,315
Uh, no.

922
01:08:33,348 --> 01:08:36,686
No, I think we should give him
a little bit of a chance.

923
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,688
You can do
what you want.

924
01:08:38,721 --> 01:08:40,790
I'm not going to fight him.

925
01:08:40,823 --> 01:08:43,091
I'm going to kill him.

926
01:08:45,126 --> 01:08:47,697
You want to kill me.

927
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:50,098
Then why did to bring...

928
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,175
Ooh.

929
01:09:17,627 --> 01:09:19,327
Jeza would love this.

930
01:09:19,362 --> 01:09:22,365
Yeah, Jeza won't be loving
anything right now.

931
01:09:25,133 --> 01:09:26,268
Where'd you get that?

932
01:09:26,301 --> 01:09:27,670
Where did you get that?!

933
01:09:27,703 --> 01:09:29,672
Jeza gave it to me.
Yeah.

934
01:09:29,705 --> 01:09:31,641
Pain is what I was
giving her, huh?

935
01:09:31,674 --> 01:09:33,409
You get what I mean?

936
01:09:33,442 --> 01:09:35,578
You sick
son of a bitch.

937
01:09:35,611 --> 01:09:37,613
What the hell did you do?

938
01:09:37,647 --> 01:09:39,214
Let's just say that
she had a date with

939
01:09:39,247 --> 01:09:41,450
one of my land mines.

940
01:09:41,484 --> 01:09:44,420
It ended with a bang!

941
01:09:44,453 --> 01:09:46,389
Where is she?!

942
01:09:46,422 --> 01:09:48,558
Where is she?!

943
01:09:48,591 --> 01:09:51,394
She's a little bit everywhere.

944
01:10:18,588 --> 01:10:21,424
Come on, motherfucker! Come on!

945
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:34,403
Here you go.

946
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:36,772
Who you calling vanilla?

947
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:41,510
I'll see you real soon.

948
01:11:05,266 --> 01:11:07,335
Huh.

949
01:11:10,906 --> 01:11:15,343
My kill, ergo, my trophy.

950
01:11:15,378 --> 01:11:18,514
You got a problem with that?

951
01:11:18,547 --> 01:11:20,583
Good.

952
01:13:30,412 --> 01:13:33,916
A lion in the savanna
catches a zebra.

953
01:13:33,949 --> 01:13:36,919
Do know what they call that?

954
01:13:36,952 --> 01:13:38,888
Lunch.

955
01:13:38,921 --> 01:13:40,689
Exactly.

956
01:13:40,723 --> 01:13:42,892
A hunt.

957
01:13:42,925 --> 01:13:47,830
A real hunt is when both hunter
and prey can reason to do this,

958
01:13:47,863 --> 01:13:51,367
and most crucially,
have the means and desire

959
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,936
to want to draw blood.

960
01:13:53,969 --> 01:13:56,405
What's your point?

961
01:13:56,438 --> 01:13:59,608
My point is...

962
01:13:59,642 --> 01:14:03,813
my heart is at ease
in a place like this.

963
01:14:03,846 --> 01:14:06,549
My senses are at 11.

964
01:14:06,582 --> 01:14:10,619
Each second is life and death.

965
01:14:10,653 --> 01:14:12,521
Out there, they have
a drug for everything,

966
01:14:12,555 --> 01:14:15,024
but none of that can make me
feel the way that I do in here,

967
01:14:15,057 --> 01:14:18,394
at complete peace.

968
01:14:22,031 --> 01:14:25,668
Well, there's something
more to it.

969
01:14:25,701 --> 01:14:28,771
We can both agree she deserved
a better death.

970
01:14:31,674 --> 01:14:35,678
What do you say
you and I go hunt down Malone.

971
01:14:35,711 --> 01:14:37,479
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere
with you.

972
01:14:37,513 --> 01:14:39,448
You're sick.

973
01:14:40,749 --> 01:14:43,052
So are you, Mr. Carrion.

974
01:14:43,085 --> 01:14:44,987
So are you.

975
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,022
In the real world,
they would call us monsters

976
01:14:47,056 --> 01:14:48,891
for what we do in here,
but we're not interested

977
01:14:48,924 --> 01:14:52,928
in the real world, now, are we?

978
01:14:52,962 --> 01:14:55,931
I just came here
to hunt a guy.

979
01:14:55,965 --> 01:14:57,867
Bullshit.

980
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,802
You're hoping in that moment
of death that you

981
01:14:59,835 --> 01:15:04,573
will feel alive again.

982
01:15:04,607 --> 01:15:07,877
Yeah, no disrespect, but you're
more fucked in the head

983
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:09,612
than anyone I've ever met.

984
01:15:09,645 --> 01:15:15,618
Oh, we both are, Mr. Carrion,
but we build empires.

985
01:15:15,651 --> 01:15:19,188
We cure cancer.
We put feet on Mars.

986
01:15:19,221 --> 01:15:22,524
But yet, we're still human,
and to be human,

987
01:15:22,558 --> 01:15:24,627
you have to reckon
with the Quixotic ideal

988
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:27,963
that we are good people.

989
01:15:27,997 --> 01:15:30,766
That the evil illness isn't
always gnawing

990
01:15:30,799 --> 01:15:32,201
at the edges of our mind.

991
01:15:32,234 --> 01:15:34,737
No, Mr. Carrion, we're not sick.

992
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:36,839
We are aware.

993
01:15:36,872 --> 01:15:38,841
We're hunters.

994
01:15:38,874 --> 01:15:40,576
It's the parade that is sick.

995
01:15:40,609 --> 01:15:44,513
It's the Thomas Malones
of the world that are sick.

996
01:15:44,546 --> 01:15:47,182
Look what he's doing to us.

997
01:15:47,216 --> 01:15:51,887
Pitting us against each other,
brother against brother.

998
01:15:51,921 --> 01:15:56,792
No, Mr. Carrion,
we must destroy Malone,

999
01:15:56,825 --> 01:15:59,695
or he will destroy us.

1000
01:16:02,197 --> 01:16:05,134
How about this?

1001
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:09,038
One dollar to the man
who takes Malone's head.

1002
01:17:15,237 --> 01:17:17,606
I hate forests.

1003
01:17:18,273 --> 01:17:20,009
Fuck nature.

1004
01:17:21,877 --> 01:17:26,248
Fuck dirt, hills.

1005
01:17:26,281 --> 01:17:28,884
Especially fuck trees.

1006
01:17:30,052 --> 01:17:31,653
Whew!

1007
01:17:33,756 --> 01:17:35,924
<i>I would go easy
on the berries.</i>

1008
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:39,161
<i>You're about your trip
some serious balls.</i>

1009
01:17:55,077 --> 01:17:57,212
Malone!

1010
01:17:59,948 --> 01:18:02,151
Come out of hiding!

1011
01:18:02,184 --> 01:18:04,820
Let's finish the game!

1012
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:32,014
Ugh!

1013
01:18:54,803 --> 01:18:57,806
No mas. Say it!

1014
01:18:59,174 --> 01:19:01,343
I want to hear you say it.

1015
01:19:01,377 --> 01:19:03,178
No mas.

1016
01:19:05,347 --> 01:19:06,815
N...

1017
01:19:06,849 --> 01:19:08,917
No...

1018
01:19:08,951 --> 01:19:10,886
No mas.

1019
01:19:12,988 --> 01:19:17,759
Oh, yeah, fuck. Yeah.

1020
01:19:17,793 --> 01:19:19,294
You're good.

1021
01:19:19,328 --> 01:19:21,029
Kid,
I'm better than good.

1022
01:19:21,063 --> 01:19:24,066
I'm bacon and eggs
on Sunday morning.

1023
01:19:28,337 --> 01:19:30,672
I never want to see you again.

1024
01:19:30,706 --> 01:19:31,907
Yeah.

1025
01:19:34,377 --> 01:19:36,145
I can live with that.

1026
01:19:38,046 --> 01:19:39,382
If I live.

1027
01:19:39,415 --> 01:19:42,284
Why the fuck
would you come here?

1028
01:19:43,819 --> 01:19:46,755
You get off on this?

1029
01:19:46,788 --> 01:19:49,191
I mean...

1030
01:19:49,224 --> 01:19:53,262
being this close to death
makes you feel...

1031
01:19:53,295 --> 01:19:55,365
alive.

1032
01:19:58,066 --> 01:20:00,302
What about you?

1033
01:20:00,335 --> 01:20:03,972
You're fighting pretty hard

1034
01:20:04,006 --> 01:20:08,043
to live, for a guy who doesn't
seem to really give a fuck.

1035
01:20:08,076 --> 01:20:10,279
I got a reason to live.

1036
01:20:10,312 --> 01:20:11,980
Oh, yeah. What's that?

1037
01:20:12,014 --> 01:20:14,283
Grandkids.

1038
01:20:14,316 --> 01:20:16,218
Two of them.

1039
01:20:16,251 --> 01:20:18,320
I wasn't a good father.

1040
01:20:20,255 --> 01:20:24,059
But maybe...

1041
01:20:24,092 --> 01:20:26,862
Maybe I can make good on this.

1042
01:20:26,895 --> 01:20:29,932
I got a kid. I got a kid.

1043
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,902
How old?

1044
01:20:33,936 --> 01:20:35,904
He's 4.

1045
01:20:37,906 --> 01:20:41,444
He's 4 years old.

1046
01:20:41,477 --> 01:20:44,012
This gun's too heavy.

1047
01:20:44,046 --> 01:20:46,014
What else you got?

1048
01:20:54,289 --> 01:20:56,359
Carrion, check in.

1049
01:21:05,067 --> 01:21:07,102
<i>Carrion, check in.</i>

1050
01:21:09,938 --> 01:21:12,107
Carrion?

1051
01:21:15,445 --> 01:21:17,946
Huh.

1052
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:20,249
West.

1053
01:21:20,282 --> 01:21:23,318
I'd like to buy
five mongrels, please.

1054
01:21:23,352 --> 01:21:27,256
Let's remind Malone who is
the hunter and who is the prey.

1055
01:21:52,347 --> 01:21:54,249
Whoo!

1056
01:22:05,395 --> 01:22:09,432
A life of luxury to the legend
who kills him.

1057
01:22:11,467 --> 01:22:13,902
I want my trophy.

1058
01:22:13,935 --> 01:22:16,872
I want him to know who he is.

1059
01:22:16,905 --> 01:22:22,311
Seal his destiny and bring me
the head of Thomas Malone!

1060
01:22:23,945 --> 01:22:27,383
Hey, you got anything real
that I can eat?

1061
01:22:27,417 --> 01:22:28,950
I'm starving.

1062
01:22:28,984 --> 01:22:30,420
Yeah, there's plenty.

1063
01:22:30,453 --> 01:22:33,021
Great. Where?

1064
01:22:33,055 --> 01:22:34,590
Where?!

1065
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,958
Back at the lodge.
There nothing in...

1066
01:22:45,934 --> 01:22:48,438
It's over?

1067
01:22:48,471 --> 01:22:49,505
I win?

1068
01:22:49,539 --> 01:22:51,139
Oh.

1069
01:22:53,308 --> 01:22:54,444
Mongrels.

1070
01:22:54,477 --> 01:22:57,879
What the fuck is a mongrel?

1071
01:22:57,913 --> 01:23:00,082
Hey! You hear me?

1072
01:23:02,284 --> 01:23:08,990
Sometimes hunters,
they use them to flush out prey.

1073
01:23:09,024 --> 01:23:11,394
And congratulations.

1074
01:23:11,427 --> 01:23:15,531
Rainsford's never use them
on a person before.

1075
01:23:15,565 --> 01:23:19,901
So, hey, that's something.

1076
01:23:19,935 --> 01:23:21,069
Yeah.

1077
01:23:21,103 --> 01:23:24,272
Yeah, I feel really honored.

1078
01:24:26,602 --> 01:24:29,204
This man, he's...

1079
01:24:29,237 --> 01:24:31,973
He's perfect.

1080
01:24:32,007 --> 01:24:34,544
West, I want more mongrels.

1081
01:24:34,577 --> 01:24:36,278
I don't give a shit.
Make them find them.

1082
01:24:36,311 --> 01:24:38,280
I don't care.
Just get me more mongrels.

1083
01:24:38,313 --> 01:24:40,182
Now!

1084
01:26:28,624 --> 01:26:30,526
Mr. Malone.

1085
01:26:31,794 --> 01:26:34,095
Well...

1086
01:26:34,129 --> 01:26:36,599
Fuck.

1087
01:26:36,632 --> 01:26:38,367
Where's Carrion?

1088
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:41,437
We came to an understanding.

1089
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:46,442
How unpredictable.

1090
01:26:48,276 --> 01:26:51,313
You truly are a specimen,
Mr. Malone.

1091
01:26:51,346 --> 01:26:54,115
Don't sell
yourself short.

1092
01:26:54,149 --> 01:26:56,852
You're a real piece of work.

1093
01:26:56,886 --> 01:27:00,523
Oh, you have no idea.

1094
01:27:00,556 --> 01:27:02,725
No, I think
I got you figured out.

1095
01:27:02,758 --> 01:27:04,192
Do you?

1096
01:27:04,225 --> 01:27:07,730
Your some kind of joy killer.

1097
01:27:07,763 --> 01:27:08,864
No.

1098
01:27:08,898 --> 01:27:11,767
I'm the pinnacle
of civilized man.

1099
01:27:11,801 --> 01:27:15,136
Civilized?

1100
01:27:17,673 --> 01:27:19,575
Christ.

1101
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:22,177
See, I hunt to learn
about myself,

1102
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:24,914
to reflect on why I am who I am.

1103
01:27:24,947 --> 01:27:30,586
All this time, I, uh, thought
that you were a super villain.

1104
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,655
Even better.

1105
01:27:32,688 --> 01:27:36,425
I'm an apex warrior.

1106
01:27:36,459 --> 01:27:38,226
You're an idiot.

1107
01:27:38,259 --> 01:27:42,163
Well, I control the largest
pharmaceutical company

1108
01:27:42,197 --> 01:27:43,566
this world has ever known.

1109
01:27:43,599 --> 01:27:46,301
I'm a trillionaire,
self-made, thrice over.

1110
01:27:46,334 --> 01:27:47,637
So?

1111
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:50,873
You're a rich idiot.

1112
01:27:50,906 --> 01:27:53,476
And an asshole.

1113
01:27:53,509 --> 01:27:56,379
I'm not going to lower myself
to argue with you.

1114
01:27:56,412 --> 01:27:57,780
Your destiny...

1115
01:27:57,813 --> 01:28:01,216
My destiny is to make sure
that you fuck off.

1116
01:28:01,249 --> 01:28:02,685
How crass.

1117
01:28:03,886 --> 01:28:06,922
You are my ultimate trophy.
You always have been.

1118
01:28:06,956 --> 01:28:09,525
I don't even think West knows
what you mean to me.

1119
01:28:09,558 --> 01:28:11,594
I got a question
for you, though.

1120
01:28:11,627 --> 01:28:12,862
How'd that tomb feel?

1121
01:28:12,895 --> 01:28:14,664
What about those cages?

1122
01:28:14,697 --> 01:28:17,366
Little claustrophobic
at times, tight?

1123
01:28:20,636 --> 01:28:24,740
I am going to hang your head
in my trophy case, forever mine.

1124
01:28:24,774 --> 01:28:26,475
My prey.

1125
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:30,311
One of us is not
leaving this island.

1126
01:28:30,345 --> 01:28:32,715
If you say so.

1127
01:28:32,748 --> 01:28:37,520
But remember,
I am Dr. Samuel Rainsford.

1128
01:28:37,553 --> 01:28:39,955
I am the future of my species.

1129
01:28:39,989 --> 01:28:43,826
I am an apex warrior!

1130
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:46,662
Did you rehearse that?

1131
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:49,230
That? No. Well, maybe.

1132
01:28:49,264 --> 01:28:53,669
The point is,
I've got you dead to rights.

1133
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:56,505
It is a statistical
impossibility that you survive

1134
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:57,973
and I don't.

1135
01:28:58,007 --> 01:29:01,410
So you're only logical choice
is to beg.

1136
01:29:01,444 --> 01:29:05,246
Beg me to let you live.

1137
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,917
Well, that's not
how I do things.

1138
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:09,919
Concede.

1139
01:29:09,952 --> 01:29:12,353
This ain't that kind of fight.

1140
01:29:43,819 --> 01:29:46,756
I do win.

1141
01:29:46,789 --> 01:29:48,557
That's all I do.

1142
01:30:00,436 --> 01:30:02,671
Ah!
